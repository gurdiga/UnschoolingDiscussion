&gt;Aliyah off to go wolf-tracking in Idaho this morning with the Wilderness <br/>
&gt;Awareness School<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, the send off began yesterday.  Packed more clothes than I can<br/>
&gt;possibly imagine her using; made sure she knows how to put up and take <br/>
&gt;down her<br/>
&gt;tent (will  still require help); got her a new knife.  She&#39;s taking her <br/>
&gt;violin, too<br/>
&gt;(it goes EVERYWHERE).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Her daypack must have weighed 20 pounds!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;What have you got in there, Ali?&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Books.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Nature guides?&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;No, don&#39;t need those.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I looked inside.  William McNeill&#39;s &quot;The Rise of the West&quot;; William<br/>
&gt;Saroyan&#39;s &quot;My Name is Aram&quot;; Thoreau&#39;s &quot;Walden&quot; (appropriate, I guess), <br/>
&gt;and... &quot;The<br/>
&gt;Collected Poems and Plays of T.S. Eliot.&quot;  And a journal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Eliot? , Ali, do you need all of those?&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Yes, I&#39;m in the middle of Murder in the Cathedral&quot; and it is a long ride.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  And then she started to recite &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Then we both got dressed up to go to hear Ustad Amjad Ali Khan (and his<br/>
&gt;teenage sons!) play the sarod at the University of Washington.  He looks <br/>
&gt;the same<br/>
&gt;as when I saw him 20 years ago (we actually look like twins.)  He&#39;s now <br/>
&gt;grayer.<br/>
&gt;So am I.  We both need some of that &quot;Hair Dye for Men&quot; (purple and <br/>
&gt;green).  Amjad<br/>
&gt;Ali Khan is the latest in along line of musicians from Gwalior dating back <br/>
&gt;to the<br/>
&gt;time of Akbar the Great (he played some of the music from his great, <br/>
&gt;great, great,<br/>
&gt;etc., etc. from the 16th century, too.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Aliyah decided to wear one of her South Indian performing outfits.  She<br/>
&gt;knew it was North Indian music, but she wanted to show it off again while it<br/>
&gt;still fits (and we don&#39;t have any performances coming up.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Concert was sensational!!! but only 3 1/2 hours long (in India, it would<br/>
&gt;have been at least 5 1/2).  Indian man comes over to Aliyah and asks, &quot;Do <br/>
&gt;you know<br/>
&gt;what you just heard?&quot; &quot;Yes, Rag Darbari.  Actually, it is the North Indian<br/>
&gt;equivalent of the Carnatic raga Kilvilley.&quot; Man walked away opened <br/>
&gt;mouthed, he was only trying to make polite conversation with the pale <br/>
&gt;skin.  Now I remember why she likes to write &quot;modal&quot; music.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Got up at 5:30 a.m. By the breakfast place, I see a berry bush.  &quot;What<br/>
&gt;kind?&quot; I  ask.  &quot;Salida(?) or Oregon Grape&quot;, she says.  (I believe her -- <br/>
&gt;last week<br/>
&gt;she brought home thimbleberries to make compote, and I had to ask her whether<br/>
&gt;they were edible too.)  So, &quot;edible&quot;?  &quot;Salida is not tasty&quot;, she says,<br/>
&gt;&quot;Oregon Grape&quot; is very bitter.  But very good for you if you get sick from <br/>
&gt;bad water.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve tried it.&quot;  (You can imagine my attempt to keep an interested, less <br/>
&gt;than overly concerned look on my New York face.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Our woods though have been invaded by poison hemlock.  Looks almost like<br/>
&gt;Queen Anne&#39;s Lace, so you have to be careful.&quot;  She laughs -- she knows <br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;likelyto eat ANYTHING which comes from the woods unless she gives it to me.<br/>
&gt;&quot;There&#39;s a beautiful purple-flowered member of the nightshade family, <br/>
&gt;too.  Quite<br/>
&gt;deadly.&quot; &quot;Oh,  well I won&#39;t eat it.&quot; I joke. &quot;No, the problem is people <br/>
&gt;pick flowers, and then put their hands in their mouths.&quot;  So I promised <br/>
&gt;not to pick any flowers in the<br/>
&gt;woods until  she got back. (I never do anyway!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Over breakfast, she informs me that a subspecies of Eurasian cuckoo<br/>
&gt;proves that birds can count. I bite: &quot;How?&quot; &quot;Well, as you know, they lay <br/>
&gt;their eggs<br/>
&gt;in the nests of other birds, who also feed the hatchlings. Can look pretty<br/>
&gt;funny, seeing a lark trying to feed a cuckoo. They can change the color of <br/>
&gt;their eggs<br/>
&gt;(not their size) to match those of the eggs in the nest.  But with this <br/>
&gt;subspecies,<br/>
&gt;for every one egg the cuckoo lays, she throws one of the other ones out of the<br/>
&gt;nest.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;Well, that only proves the cuckoo can count!&quot; I say.<br/>
&gt;&quot;Good point,&quot; she notes. (Win one for Dad!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;  So off she goes.  Jon Young, director of the Wilderness Awareness School<br/>
&gt;says, &quot;The only thing wrong with teenagers these days is the lack of large<br/>
&gt;carnivores.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess I&#39;ll find out.<br/>
