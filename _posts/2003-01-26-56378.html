&gt; I&#39;ve seen seemingly Hassidic Jews & Muslims smack their kids. I know<br/>
&gt; they are hassidim and muslims because of the way they were dressed<br/>
&gt; --this is NYC after all. To say that only protestants foster spanking<br/>
&gt; is disingenuous. I mean, come on, look at the catholic church. I<br/>
&gt; understand the point people are trying to make but really, the bible<br/>
&gt; belt is not the center of the universe. Much to Americans chagrin, NYC<br/>
&gt; is the center of the universe ;-) If it happens here, it happens<br/>
&gt; anywhere. Violence knows all genders, races and creeds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The point is that with some brands of conservative Christianity, it&#39;s de<br/>
rigeur, expected, and even put on a &quot;good Christina parents&quot; curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
I am not up on how Muslims feel about spanking, but if you check out Jewish<br/>
sites and read up on Jewish views on spanking, you will find that it is NOT<br/>
the sort of generally recommended (and often mandated!) practice it is with<br/>
some conservative Christian sects.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody ever said that only conservative Christians spank, but as far as I<br/>
know they are the only ones who&#39;ve made an industry from it.<br/>

<br/>
But I haven&#39;t seen anyone defending that point.<br/>
