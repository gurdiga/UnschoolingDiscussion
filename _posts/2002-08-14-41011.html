The opening page is a bit tedious - but the links are great as is<br/>
the newsletter/journal.<br/>

| Hey BJ,<br/>
| We had some interest going on the civil war a little over a<br/>

| We were lucky enough to have some homeschoolers do a &quot;geography<br/>

| on it, due to the fact that they were re-enactors of civil war<br/>
| times. </span></blockquote></div>
