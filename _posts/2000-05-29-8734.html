<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565337536">Hello everyone and thank you for the welcomes and feedback so far!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone on this list is familiar with &quot;The Indigo <br/>
Children&quot; by Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. I myself don&#39;t agree with <br/>
some of the disciplining methods that are suggested (such as time-<br/>
out), but I still found the book fascinating to read, esp. with <br/>
regard to ADD and other such labels and kids not accepting &quot;no&quot; for <br/>
an answer. Their website is www.indigochild.com. I would be really <br/>
interested to hear what you people think about it.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was on this list where someone else mentioned <br/>
www.awareparenting.com, which also happens to be one of my favourite <br/>
sites.<br/>
<br/>
Bye for now,<br/>
Nicoletta</div>
