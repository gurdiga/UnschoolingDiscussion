<div id="ygrps-yiv-996366811">Michelle Rafter, a reporter with the Industry Standard<br/>
(www.thestandard.com), is writing an article on unschoolers and the<br/>
Internet. She&#39;s interested in finding out some of the resources used for<br/>
unschooling children and if there any special web sites devoted to<br/>
unschooling. Do unschoolers just turn their kids loose on the Web and let<br/>
them explore, and could they unschool without the Internet? If you would<br/>
like to answer these questions and others about unschooling, please contact<br/>
Michelle by July 9, 2000 to arrange an interview.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231869646">Michelle Rafter, the reporter with the Industry Standard<br/>
(www.thestandard.com), contacted me to say that she has received an<br/>
overwhelming response and now has more than enough sources for her article<br/>
on unschooling. Please do not send her any more responses (I guess many of<br/>
us were in &quot;talkative&quot; moods this Fourth of July and had the free time to<br/>
respond!).<br/>
<br/>
If you passed the request message on to any friends, please pass this &quot;cease<br/>
and desist&quot; request to them as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and I hope everyone has a wonderful Fourth of July!<br/>
