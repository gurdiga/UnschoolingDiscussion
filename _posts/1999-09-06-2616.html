<br/>
<br/>
From an interesting perspective, I am reading my Unschooling messages just<br/>
now (and over the past week) intermixed with a pretty hot discussion that<br/>
is taking place on another list that I am on (an adoption list.)  There are<br/>
some folks who homeschool there (even 1 unschooler) some PS teachers,<br/>
social workers, families with kids in private school, families with kids in<br/>
PS, and many have varying degrees of faith and/or satisfaction in the<br/>
system(s) they use or have used.  I have included some excerpts below, as I<br/>
thought it might be interesting to add to our discussion here.  I also<br/>
wanted to hear some feedback on this conversation from a more like minded<br/>
forum.  <br/>
<br/>
There is one mother who homeschools so that her children will not learn<br/>
about evolution (!) and will be &quot;sheltered and protected.&quot;  Is there anyone<br/>
here who thinks that way?  I am afraid that her posts are perpetuating<br/>
stereotypes about homeschooling...<br/>
<br/>
From the Unschoolers there who are not us:<br/>
&quot;&lt;&lt; but they&#39;re still public schools, expecting all<br/>
kids to fit into the same sized/shaped hole, teaching to &quot;the<br/>
middle of the class&quot; so that the kids that are not as quick wind<br/>
up feeling dumb, and the very bright kids wind up learning how to<br/>
get good grades, rather than learning how to learn. &gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From a list member who is a PS teacher:<br/>
&quot;I just don&#39;t see this where I am. I teach in a wonderful district that has<br/>
some wonderful teacher who are very dedicated to reaching ALL students. I am<br/>
amazed at the hours they put into going to inservices to stretch themselves<br/>
to be better. In one week I have assessed all the students to know where they<br/>
are so when I call them back to read with me we can work on the skills that<br/>
they need. I see the low making great growth as well as the high. I have<br/>
never had trouble challenging the high and helping the low at the same time.<br/>
I know that there are many teachers with many styles but I haven&#39;t seen the<br/>
type of class where the teacher teaches to the middle for a long time. When<br/>
was the last time you went and observed at your local school? You might be<br/>
surprised at the improvement and change over the years.<br/>
<br/>
    I am seeing students in 2-3rd grade having great book talks about their<br/>
favorite authors. I am seeing them write creative stories and help each other<br/>
improve and edit their stories. I am watching my 2nd graders working as a<br/>
close group to solve problems and make our room a safe fun place. I hear them<br/>
learning to give compliments and solve the play ground problems and think I<br/>
could never reach them the way they reach each other. None of these type of<br/>
interactions could be done in a home school situations where they aren&#39;t<br/>
working with others their age. I know there are probably some positive<br/>
aspects to homeschooling, but there are also many things these kids miss out<br/>
on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From the same homeschool parent as the first one, above:<br/>
&quot;This has been addressed a few times already on this list, so<br/>
please forgive me for being repetitive.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooled kids don&#39;t *have* to miss out on anything. There are<br/>
homeschool groups that are quite large, I already mentioned the<br/>
one in my neighborhood with over 200 families actively<br/>
participating. There is a classroom full of kids of every age,<br/>
and that&#39;s just in my neck of the woods. They have facilities<br/>
where they do arts and crafts in a group situation once a week,<br/>
there&#39;s field trips (which many school districts just don&#39;t do<br/>
anymore) and group study, also on a weekly basis. There are also<br/>
extra-curricular activities. For the older kids, they study<br/>
together for the more difficult subjects, either with a parent<br/>
who has volunteered to teach the subject, or with a teacher hired<br/>
for that purpose. One large group even has dances and other<br/>
social activities for the older kids! Some districts will let<br/>
kids participate in extra-curricular activities, for those that<br/>
don&#39;t, there are community leagues.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, I&#39;m not trying to sell anyone on my option, although<br/>
like anyone else, I do like to dispel the myths. If nobody here<br/>
gave homeschooling a second thought, fine by me! But my decision<br/>
to homeschool my son wasn&#39;t a knee-jerk reaction, it was<br/>
carefully thought out, something my husband and I thoroughly<br/>
discussed. I had every preconceived notion about homeschooling<br/>
that I&#39;ve seen mentioned here, until my sister in law did it with<br/>
my nieces. And they succeeded beyond any expectation their<br/>
previous performance would have hinted at. I hate to say this,<br/>
but my sister in law was never a college level student, but she<br/>
did an excellent job, sent the girls to magnet schools once spots<br/>
opened up testing a grade level *ahead* of their age, socially<br/>
well adjusted, and quite happy with the experience. I decided to<br/>
look into homeschooling with a less prejudiced eye (not<br/>
suggesting anyone else here is prejudiced, just admitting I was).<br/>
I simply saw a chance to avoid what I saw as the pitfalls of<br/>
public (or even private) school education. I know it won&#39;t work<br/>
for everyone. I believe it will work just fine for us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From a homeschooling parent:<br/>
I am sorry, but there is absolutely nothing positive that my kids are missing<br/>
out on in my opinion.  I am not sure how you can offer this opinion if you<br/>
have not homeschooled or are not intimately involved with homeschoolers.<br/>
The quality or racial make-up of institutionalized schooling is not the<br/>
primary reason we have chosen to homeschool.  For our family, it is a<br/>
lifestyle choice.  We enjoy being together all day and functioning as a<br/>
family unit.  I like learning with my kids and being there when the<br/>
lightbulbs go off and they grasp a new concept.  We like being able to drive<br/>
across the country leisurely taking our classroom on the road at any time in<br/>
the year.  I like sleeping late or taking a whole day to browse an exhibit at<br/>
a local museum.  I love that my kids consider their siblings among their best<br/>
friends.  I love that my ten year old son can change a diaper with the best<br/>
of them and adores babies.<br/>
<br/>
I know that many people who don&#39;t homeschool love all these things too and I<br/>
know there are plenty of extremely close families that don&#39;t homeschool.  But<br/>
the main reason we do homechool is because we like the lifestyle that it<br/>
affords our family.  Even if I lived in a district with the number one public<br/>
school in the country or had access to the most prestigous private school in<br/>
the world, I would still homeschool my kids.<br/>
<br/>
From another parent:<br/>
This is such an interesting thread. Our children&#39;s education, plus who & what<br/>
influences their socialization and value system is definitely a highly<br/>
charged decision for a parent. I know it always was for me. I opted to take<br/>
the public school route for each of my four children.<br/>
All of my children have come into contact with excellent and caring teachers.<br/>
The last 2 more so than the first 2. Throughout the girls&#39; (my last 2) school<br/>
years, they were blessed with projects, activities and challenges that have<br/>
guided them into very successful young women. Writing and reading were<br/>
emphasized, and self thinking & discovery was encouraged. My oldest daughter<br/>
found a teacher who became a mentor to her and gave her hours of extra help.<br/>
Guided her toward scholarship money and funding for college. Helped her with<br/>
essays, resumes and spent time encouraging her.  She is now in her second<br/>
year at a local University and continues to succeed. My last daughter is now<br/>
a senior in h.s. and very involved in her school. Both girls became involved<br/>
in their schools (they went to different schools in the same district-their<br/>
choice) multicultural clubs and found a voice for their minority status--the<br/>
school system supported and encouraged this also. I would not have been able<br/>
to provide several aspects of their &quot;educational&quot; experiences & activities.<br/>
We were either very blessed, or very fortunate<br/>
not to have what I have heard as described as &quot;normal&quot; teenage rebellion.<br/>
There has been no skipping, bad grades, bad language, abusive, disrespectful<br/>
or irresponsible behavior or actions, uncaringness nor do they display a lack<br/>
of motivation. As parents we set the standard, but thankfully our school<br/>
system found ways to affirm and hold students to these standards also. But<br/>
ultimately it was our children&#39;s choice to create their own standards and I<br/>
am so proud of the choices each of them has chosen to make.<br/>
I know not all school systems are the same, nor do I believe all students<br/>
would benefit from public school--even a good one, but for our family it was<br/>
a good discision and isn&#39;t that our goal. I have never looked at decision,<br/>
private or public school as good, bad or better than another, but more what<br/>
is the goal and how can we best help our child to be a well rounded, caring,<br/>
loving and productive adult. There cannot possibly be one choice fits all<br/>
answer to this question.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I had already deleted some of the more (ahem) shall we<br/>
say...adamant? messages against homeschooling before I decided to turn to<br/>
this group for a little feedback regarding this discussion.  I should tell<br/>
you that I started the whole thing by asking why, in all their lamentations<br/>
about finding good quality and racially diverse schooling situations for<br/>
their cross-racially adopted children, nobody ever mentioned homeschooling<br/>
as an option.  Then I ducked and covered!  <br/>

I, personally, teach my children that, while the theory of evolution exists, <br/>
it is incorrect. For more info, you can check out the website: <br/>
www.answersingenesis.com. It addresses evolution vs. creation.  As any <br/>
parent, I do shelter my children with homeschooling: from abusive teachers, <br/>
foul language from fellow students, poor self-esteem, etc... I feel every <br/>
child should be sheltered from these things! As far as religious viewpoints <br/>
go, naturally we teach our children what we hold as truth. <br/>
