<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418924289">Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I will be starting to homeschool my son this summer.  He is 8 and has PDD.  I am interested in hearing how unschooling works for your son.  I have had doubts about whether Ryan will learn without some kind of teaching.  We were unschoolers until he was 6, when we got the diagnosis.  It took us a few months, but we eventually decided to try school.  At the time his behavior at home was difficult and it was a bit of a relief to have a respite.  He is so much more mature now, and I&#39;m have long tired of the schedules, the arbitrary homework (which is still very minimal as he is in first grade), the competition and &quot;socialization&quot; of public school.  I also have a &quot;typical&quot; daughter who is 10 and has never been to traditional school.  It&#39;s been hard to justify believing that school is good for Ryan when I wouldn&#39;t send Chloe there.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m wondering what sort of challenges your son is facing.  For Ryan, his biggest challenge is language.  He is talking like crazy, but still often misunderstood especially outside the family.  I think he will be able to learn to read, but it will take a while longer.  Luckily, he absolutely loves books and looks at them for hours sometimes.  This morning he was up early and I found him &quot;reading&quot; Go Dog Go.  It was so cool to see him saying the words from memory (not exactly but a good representation). .  I think that learning to read is the most important thing for him because he enjoys books so much.  I always knew he would be a late reader so that doesn&#39;t worry me.  I am a little worried about his lack of math skills (he can rote count but doesn&#39;t seem to get one to one correspondence).  Handwriting is a major challenge, so I will make keyboarding available to him when he wants it.  He has done some of this at school and he likes to send emails to grandparents, but of course he can&#39;t spell, so I have been doing the typing until we get to his name which he can do.  I feel that anything else he will acquire when he&#39;s ready and interested.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone out there have any tips for us?  I have read a lot of the posts at unschooling.com and a Sandra&#39;s website on special needs.  Can I really just let go with a child who is a slow learner?   Thanks for any advice!  Kristin<br/>
<br/>

Well, thank YOU, Mary, Sandra, Jennifer and others!<br/>
Not to be dramatic, but it&#39;s almost like I have been brainwashed (my son, <br/>
too)?<br/>
And yes, my 14-yr-old son has special needs (autism).  He does quite well <br/>
most of the time.  I have an 11-yr-old &quot;typical&quot; son, which makes me laugh to <br/>
use ;these labels, because of course he is special to me in his own way, too! <br/>
 You know, in so many words, we just want our life back.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate everyone&#39;s input,<br/>
Susan<br/>

<br/>
Kristin, you have come to the right place. BTW I doubt that anyone here<br/>
would agree with the label of &quot;late reader&quot; given the description of<br/>
your son&#39;s activities including typing his own name and seeking out<br/>
books for enjoyment. &quot;Slow learner&quot; is a label used by schools as a<br/>
convenient distinction also. The great thing about unschooling is the<br/>
letting go of all these labels.  Also, the hard thing about unschooling<br/>
is letting go of all these labels, even in your own thinking -<br/>
especially in your own thinking! I guarantee that you and he will still<br/>
need to deschool after two years(?) of  it.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I feel that anything else he will acquire when he&#39;s ready and<br/>
interested.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This sentence is the nutshell description of unschooling and applies to<br/>
all of us regarding everything including reading and math. Have faith<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Relax. ::Breathe:: Take a really good look at your son and appreciate <br/>
all the wonderful things he knows and can do *right now* in this <br/>
moment. This is Who He Is. Try not to compare him with anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Can I really just let go with a child who is a slow learner? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He learns as fast as he learns. It doesn&#39;t matter how it compares to <br/>
how quickly someone else learns. Help him find his own strengths and <br/>
talents. He has them inside, waiting to be discovered. (Unless you&#39;ve <br/>
discovered them already in which case, GO with those strengths!)<br/>
<br/>
IMHO your son will learn a lot about bieng slow and damaged <br/>
and &quot;different&quot; by being in school. With unschooling he can remain <br/>
whole. I&#39;ve seen it with my own kids.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

Professionals pressed him and that didn&#39;t help, did it?  Probably made things <br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let go&quot; as in ignore him? No.<br/>
&quot;Let go&quot; as in go toward him and with him where he is?  Absolutely.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kristin, thanks for starting the thread.  I have a &quot;birthed&quot; son &lt;g&gt; that I <br/>
currently homeschool, he has alway been homeschooled, who is 15.  But next <br/>
year I plan to bring home our adopted son, almost 10.  I let him stay in <br/>
school after his adoption (less than a year ago), because he loved school so <br/>
much...but this year has been awful.  He has been labeled with FAS, ADHD, <br/>
RAD, and who knows what else.  All I see is a child who was not nurtured for <br/>
the first 7 years of his life, who is still in soooo many ways a baby.  I am <br/>
looking forward to the relief from all the school stress and junk that comes <br/>
along with it.  <br/>
<br/>
We also have 2 foster sons, and unfortunately in our state foster children <br/>
have to be in public or private school.  I was told it may have made a <br/>
difference if I were a licensed teacher, but I only have a high school <br/>
education.  :o(  BUT...we are working on adopting them, and we are hoping <br/>
that over the summer we may be able to convince the judge that since we are <br/>
adopting them ANYWAY we may as well mesh them with the rest of the kids <br/>
education since the adoption will probably be final before the end of the <br/>
year.  <br/>
<br/>
ALL 3 adopt/foster boys have reading and math problems by the school&#39;s <br/>
standards.  But MIcheal (9) loves to play with rope and build intricate <br/>
pulley systems, and is constantly trying to reinvent the wheel.  Travis (12) <br/>
is an awesome artist, and can play almost anything he hears on a recorder.  <br/>
and Justin (10) is making wonderful progress in just PLAYING...for the first <br/>
year of him being here, because of past abuse/etc...he just sat around like a <br/>
bored adult when given toys.  Now he spends hours at the spring cleaning it <br/>
out, finding frogs, finding tadpoles, and he can&#39;t walk past the birdseed <br/>
container without scooping through it, putting some in the funnel, burying <br/>
his hands in it...it&#39;s great.  Can&#39;t wait for SUMMER!  <br/>

I hate labels too...I believe they are a way the school system justifies <br/>
treating kids unfairly and getting paid extra money to do so.  grrrrrr<br/>

I am just curious about how adoption and foster care has worked for <br/>
you.  I have always desired to do that at some point, however, I am <br/>
always concerned with ages and what the appropriate time to bring <br/>
someone in would be (related to the other children)?  I would love to <br/>
hear all about it.  Also, what a great gift, congratulations for <br/>
doing something so selfless!  You have my highest respect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think one thing that worked out (not intentionally) for us is that all 3 <br/>
boys are younger than our bio-children.  So no one was bumped out of their <br/>
&quot;place&quot; in the family.  Believe me, they all get on each other&#39;s nerves, but <br/>
each time it looked like they were possibly going home all my children were <br/>
heartbroken.  I also think, that my kids are awesome and are just the type of <br/>
young adults that are capable of putting other people first and realizing <br/>
that some kids are a heck of a lot less fortunate than we are.  I also try to <br/>
give them alone time with me,...sometimes I will take the girls shopping <br/>
alone with me, or something like that.  And a lot of freedom and time away <br/>
from home (spending the night at friends, going to the movies, etc) as a <br/>
break from the other kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Foster care and adoption is a full time job, it turns your life upside down, <br/>
and should never be taken lightly.  I don&#39;t believe most people becoming <br/>
foster parents are prepared for how hard it is.  Because of this, many foster <br/>
parents who cannot handle a kid, pass them along to another family, or a <br/>
shelter, or an institution.  This probably does as much damage to the kids as <br/>
the abuse or neglect they suffered.  In Sandra&#39;s tape on peaceful parenting <br/>
she talks about kids having to feel safe in their home to learn.  Can you <br/>
imagine the ultimate &quot;unsafe&quot; feeling of being be removed from a family, <br/>
school, community, at the drop of a hat?  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there are NEVER enough good foster homes...NEVER.  So if <br/>
your heart is in the right place, and you truly want more children, and <br/>
understand the hardships you may face, then by all means, look into it.  We <br/>
are with a private agency that gives us much more support.  The monthly <br/>
stipend is almost double what the state pays also, which always helps.  In <br/>
all 50 states, I believe, if a foster parent adopts a child now, the monthly <br/>
allowance is not taken away, it continues until the child is 18 or done with <br/>
college.  I believe this is one of the more brilliant things our government <br/>
has done :o) <br/>

I think you will be giving a wonderful gift to these boys if you can homeschool them.  It sounds like they will benefit immensely by being given free reign with their interests.  You are the one with the sheep too, right?  What a great thing for them to be raised on a farm and out in nature.  Good for you!! Kristin<br/>
