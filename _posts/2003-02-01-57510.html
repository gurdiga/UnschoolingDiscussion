<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341041094">One of the by-products of this lifestyle I&#39;m finding is that my kids <br/>
are suddenly aware that I am trusting them to make more <br/>
decisions than they used to. One of my kids (who is the <br/>
parent-pleaser of the group) keeps checking in with me to see if I <br/>
think they&#39;re doing okay. :) So sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, though, my dh went through a bit of the transitional <br/>
panic some of us have gone through at times. &quot;Can I say <br/>
anything to them?&quot; &quot;They&#39;re young.&quot; &quot;Isn&#39;t it okay to just &quot;parent?&quot;&quot; <br/>
&quot;What about common sense?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some of what we came up with I want to run by this group and <br/>
see what you think.<br/>
<br/>
I liked that Sandra said that if we are new to this lifestyle, we can <br/>
ease into it. Don&#39;t rush ahead of where we have peace and <br/>
confidence because then we can end up in chaos and anger <br/>
since we did something dishonestly.<br/>
<br/>
So we stopped to look at all the changes we&#39;ve made that we <br/>
feel just fine about:<br/>
<br/>
Limits off of X box and computer<br/>
Freedom to eat when you want to and no requirements to eat <br/>
what I made for dinner<br/>
No more school book work required (or done at all)<br/>
Household help is much more on a volunteer or &quot;ask for help&quot; <br/>
basis (So far everyone wanted to continue with the routines we <br/>
have so there are still predictable &quot;jobs&quot; but these re far more <br/>
flexible than they used to be even)<br/>
Phone calls and IM are open for whenever they want them<br/>
bedtimes are no longer set or firm<br/>
More movies<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things we are thrilled about:<br/>
<br/>
Kids are far more gracious to each other (and I already thought <br/>
they were pretty good!)<br/>
They are jumping up to help me any time I ask. Really. Amazes <br/>
me.<br/>
There&#39;s such a good spirit in the house.<br/>
Lots of conversations about the future, about right now, about <br/>
what they thought before and how they see things today.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s where we&#39;re at. Dh is feeling that he doesn&#39;t want his <br/>
13 yodd on the Internet after midnight. He wonders if he can say: <br/>
&quot;You know, I think these little guys really need to be in bed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told him as we talked that I believe we are earning the right to <br/>
offer our kids our opinions and even at times to suggest things <br/>
based on our experiences because they know that we aren&#39;t <br/>
simply imposing our view of life on them at every turn. Last night <br/>
when I suggested my dd get off the computer and we talked <br/>
about the Internet and chatting with strangers (again--we&#39;ve had <br/>
this discussion and she doesn&#39;t talk to strangers, but my dh <br/>
wanted to remind her of our concerns). She was fine with that.<br/>
<br/>
So am I right in assuming that because we are giving them room <br/>
to be themselves, to test out how to manage their lives with our <br/>
support, does it also hold that when some of the issues parents <br/>
do care about (where they drive, who they dte, how young and so <br/>
on) come up, we will be able to talk about these things and <br/>
come to shred consensus because we&#39;ve been considerate on <br/>
so many other levels?<br/>
<br/>
I also told my dh that if there is a specific place he is <br/>
uncomfortable with where we re, we all need to feel the freedom <br/>
to express it, to go slowly and to share the way the process if <br/>
affecting us as much as how it is affecting them. Does that <br/>
sound reasonable to you all too? Any cautions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
We tell our kids it&#39;s tacky to call others after 10:00 unless you know <br/>
they&#39;re up AND their parents are awake, or they  have a cellphone and TOLD <br/>
you to call them, or something similar.<br/>
<br/>
The few times someone has called here and woken us up (intending to get one <br/>
of the kids but calling after 11:00 or something I consider too horrible <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), either I or the kids tell them not to call so late.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So am I right in assuming that because we are giving them room <br/>
to be themselves, to test out how to manage their lives with our <br/>
support, does it also hold that when some of the issues parents <br/>
do care about (where they drive, who they dte, how young and so <br/>

come to shred consensus because we&#39;ve been considerate on <br/>
so many other levels?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think so.<br/>
<br/>
If she wants to date someone you don&#39;t trust, instead of thinking of her and <br/>
that boy, think back to any and every situation you know of prior to that <br/>
where a parent has just said &quot;NO, you can&#39;t go out with him,&quot; or worse:  &quot;No, <br/>
have no contact with him whatsoever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those things have not ended well very often.  <br/>
<br/>
Even if the child concedes, and even if it is the rare case in which the <br/>
child really never sees that person again and cuts off all contact, I think <br/>
the cost is the entirety of the relationship between the parent and child.<br/>
<br/>
So the best thing I can think of to do is to voice my concerns clearly, <br/>
remind the child that I love him (mine are &quot;hims&quot; so far in such matters) and <br/>
suggest outs for in case the situation does move toward my worries.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has a friend I don&#39;t trust.  I enjoy his company, usually, and he&#39;s <br/>
pretty bright, and I feel sorry for him, but he&#39;s reckless and a little <br/>
psycho.  Marty understands why I&#39;m concerned, and he&#39;s wary.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty had a female friend who was desperate for male attention.  <br/>
She was 14 and her dad was awful to her and she had two younger brothers she <br/>
was forced to take care of almost by herself (so she tended to abandon and <br/>
neglect them to spite her dad).  She WANTED a boyfriend, and was hanging out <br/>
in a larger group of teens.  I told five of those boys all together that she <br/>
was likely to need to get pregnant as a means of escape, and that they should <br/>
all be EXTRA careful not to be the tool of her escape from her house.<br/>
<br/>
But in neither case did I say &quot;Stay away from that kid.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And in both cases, they came to see my point and distanced themselves NOT <br/>
because of what I said, but because of things the other kid said or did.  <br/>
<br/>
Had I forbidden, they probably would have become sneaky or lied for the first <br/>
time in their lives.  <br/>
Or if they hadn&#39;t done that, they would have resented me for being mean and <br/>
unreasonable, and would have idealized that person.   As it is, I &quot;got my <br/>
way,&quot; and they see that they were given the freedom to see if maybe I was <br/>
wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I also told my dh that if there is a specific place he is <br/>
uncomfortable with where we re, we all need to feel the freedom <br/>
to express it, to go slowly and to share the way the process if <br/>
affecting us as much as how it is affecting them. Does that <br/>
sound reasonable to you all too? Any cautions?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds WONDERFUL.<br/>
<br/>
Your family has made more changes in a month than most families ever make in <br/>
a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Just as starting to unschool helps the parents and the children both <br/>
understand how natural learning CAN work, which makes more confident <br/>
unschooling easier, starting to trust kids with their life decisions will <br/>
make it easier to do more of that too.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds good in theory but I have to say things don&#39;t always go so smoothly. <br/>
My daughter was seeing someone I didn&#39;t care for. This was a second go <br/>
around as I gave the kid a second chance to prove me wrong. I wasn&#39;t wrong <br/>
and this time around was worse. I was worried and fearful of what could <br/>
possibly happen. My daughter didn&#39;t see any of it and finally, for my own <br/>
sanity, I put an end to the relationship. It was a family intervention with <br/>
no help on the part of the boyfriends family. And no it didn&#39;t go well at <br/>
all. She was real pissed for about a week and gradually things got better. <br/>
It took awhile but I can honestly say our relationship didn&#39;t suffer but for <br/>
a brief moment. Our relationship is actually better now than ever. I did <br/>
what I had to do and I would do it over again.<br/>

My daughter was seeing someone I didn&#39;t care for. . . . .I was worried and <br/>
fearful of what could <br/>
possibly happen. My daughter didn&#39;t see any of it and finally, for my own <br/>
sanity, I put an end to the relationship.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was a paragraph about you.<br/>
YOU didn&#39;t care for him and for YOUR own sanity...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m being too picky, and I&#39;m sure you could tell us exactly what your <br/>
concerns for your daughter were if you wanted to, but you said of the <br/>
&quot;intervention,&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And no it didn&#39;t go well at all. She was real pissed for about a week and <br/>
gradually things got better. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She might be &quot;real pissed&quot; forever.  Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It took awhile but I can honestly say our relationship didn&#39;t suffer but <br/>
for a brief moment.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you say honestly that you&#39;re sure she cut of the relationship with the <br/>
boy entirely?<br/>
<br/>
I had friends who pretended exactly what their parents wanted them to pretend <br/>
at home but did what their parents did NOT want them to do outside the house, <br/>
and used me and various other things/places/people as covers.  Because their <br/>
parents wouldn&#39;t allow them freedoms, they became sneaky and dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your situation with your daughter isn&#39;t like that at all.   <br/>
<br/>
But if your story stays in the archives without any comment, I would hate for <br/>
someone to say &quot;Yeah!  Good!  Another unschooler just laid down the law and <br/>
ran a boyfriend off, so I think I will do it too.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
No she wasn&#39;t and no she isn&#39;t now. We have talked. A lot. About that and <br/>
other things. She&#39;s actually glad now that he&#39;s gone and she&#39;s without him. <br/>
She does not like still the way it went down. Neither do I but I felt like <br/>
nothing else would get rid of him. And for everyone&#39;s sake hre, I did need <br/>
to have him gone. I was scared with him around. He didn&#39;t hit her but was <br/>
very abusive verbally. He was moody to the point where he was weird. He was <br/>
supposed to be on meds that he didn&#39;t take. It was a feeling I had. It was <br/>
something I heard him tell my daugher. It didn&#39;t set right with me and I was <br/>
actually afraid for her life and possible my other children. She didn;t want <br/>
to stop the relationship. A lot of it was her feeling sorry for him. He <br/>
wouldn&#39;t stop seeing her and his parents wouldn&#39;t help either. I felt like I <br/>
was in a corner.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Can you say honestly that you&#39;re sure she cut of the relationship with the <br/>
boy entirely?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She saw him once after we said no more. She spoke to him after on the phone <br/>
from school. We knew and she knew we knew. She finally ended that herself <br/>
after not being under his influence for awhile. She hasn&#39;t seen him at all <br/>
since that last time. She avoids him actually if she&#39;s in the area at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I hope your situation with your daughter isn&#39;t like that at all.<br/>
But if your story stays in the archives without any comment, I would hate <br/>
for someone to say &quot;Yeah!  Good!  Another unschooler just laid down the law <br/>
and ran a boyfriend off, so I think I will do it too.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I actually agree with what you said about voicing your concerns about <br/>
friends your children have. Giving them a heads up so to speak. This was far <br/>
beyond that. This was a second chance gone bad. My daughter has had quite a <br/>
few friends she was seeing that I wasn&#39;t crazy about. I never got involved. <br/>
This was different and sometimes, every once in a while, saying something <br/>
and standing back to watch isn&#39;t comfortable enough to let happen. That&#39;s <br/>
what happened here and I don&#39;t advocate at all parents jumping in with what <br/>
they like or don&#39;t. This was a whole different ball of wax. And in this very <br/>
possible extreme case, well worth what we did.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m actually glad you did. I don&#39;t read my posts after I post them and <br/>
therfore don&#39;t realize after the fact how something sounded. I don&#39;t want <br/>
anyone to think they should just jump in and stop relationships that they <br/>
don&#39;t care for between their children. I tried hard for quite a long time to <br/>
not do that. I just got to the point where I thought maybe I would be a <br/>
parent who lost a child and felt bad for not &quot;seeing&quot; something sooner. So I <br/>
took a chance and it ended well. Maybe all the other good parenting I had <br/>
done made up for the bad moment. Maybe I was just lucky. Either way, I have <br/>
my daugher back.<br/>
