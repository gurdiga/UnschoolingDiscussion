<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795659907">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m delurking to ask y&#39;all a favor. I am writing an article for the <br/>
September edition of  Home Education Magazine. It is on the idea of <br/>
DE-SCHOOLING; of a parent having to overcome their academic, <br/>
scholarly or teaching habits, in order to homeschool. I am looking <br/>
for feedback from other fellow homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that, despite its academic value, a graduate degree does <br/>
not necessarily lend itself for easy homeschooling. On the contrary, <br/>
it can become a hindrance in homeschooling practices; especially when <br/>
one is trying to follow the child&#39;s lead.  The practice of the <br/>
teacher, college lecturer, scholar or professor is to lecture, not to <br/>
create; to teach, not to play; to perpetuate a canon, not to open up <br/>
uncharted paths to learning.<br/>
<br/>
I put myself as an example: Given that my parents had me in school <br/>
already by the age of 3 and I finished with an ABD at age 30, that <br/>
means I spent 27 contiguous years in a school setting! Parenting and <br/>
homeschooling have been a DESCHOOLING experience and they will <br/>
probably continue to be for another 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
I am including a short questionnaire for those who would like to <br/>
share their experiences and/or opinions on the matter. Please reply <br/>
to me off list to <br/>

<br/>
1. How long have you homeschooled?<br/>
2. How many children do you have? How old are they?<br/>
3. Why are you homeschooling?<br/>
4. What is your homeschooling approach and/or style?<br/>
5. What is your educational and/or professional background?<br/>
6. Has your educational and/or professional background had any <br/>
influence over your homeschooling style?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for sharing your experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443074401">I know a woman you might want to talk with, but I don&#39;t know if she has <br/>
email.  I could ask her if she&#39;d be willing to talk with you on the <br/>
phone.  (Maybe they have email by now, not sure)<br/>
She got her teaching certificate way back when because she was planning to <br/>
homeschool any future kids and didn&#39;t know if it would be legal <br/>
otherwise.  She even worked as a principal.  She&#39;s always said her teacher <br/>
training was a hinderance in homeschooling.  Her three kids are grown now <br/>
and doing very well.<br/>
