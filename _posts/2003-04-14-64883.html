Hello Shyrley(sp?)<br/>
My son Tommy is 7.5 and my daughter is 1.5, it is a challenge, but also a <br/>
huge adventure. He is learning a lot about people and toddlers and diapers <br/>
etc. so I guess it is one big unschooling experiment! We are somewhat limited <br/>
by Lesley Ann&#39;s needs , but she is pretty portable, with breastfeeding and <br/>
all. We haven&#39;t missed out on much, we find it worth it, tho it is a shock to <br/>
go back, and I feel my age while chasing her around when we go places. Good <br/>
luck, I would dearly love to have one more, but my husband says he would only <br/>
visit me on weekends!! I guess that means no.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a 10yo, 3yo, 1yo. I was pregnant with the youngest when 10yo was in <br/>
3rd grade and 3yo was 1. When we moved, oldest stopped going to 4th grade, <br/>
and youngest was a baby, I decided that I was finished having babies. A LOT <br/>
had to do with my new homeschooling decision. I decided it was hard enough <br/>
homeschooling the 10yo with a baby and a toddler, and I don&#39;t want to start <br/>
over with another baby when the 3yo is kindergarten age. Homeschooling was so <br/>
important to me to focus on that it literally changed my future family plans. <br/>
<br/>
Just my experience. <br/>
