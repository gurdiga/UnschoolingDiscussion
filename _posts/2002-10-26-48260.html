 </span></blockquote>I had a performance tonight (Saturday) with my group GaiaWolf.  It&#39;s more <br/>
of a mixed bag of genres from world music to R&B to reggae to contemporary <br/>
acoustic.  GaiaWolf&#39;s mission has to do with promoting universal harmony <br/>
amongst species, so to that end we sing about wolves in Yellowstone, how <br/>
drought in the Serengeti affects the elephants who live there, peace, the <br/>
manatee, pilot whales, starting over, what the Statue of Liberty might say <br/>
if she could talk and tell us what she&#39;s been seeing, and on and on.  If <br/>
you&#39;d like to hear some of the music we do, you can listen for free at this <br/>
website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/192/ec_lorick__gaiawolf.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/192/ec_lorick__gaiawolf.html</a>  My <br/>
most favorite tune on there is Abby, Stay.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your instrument, Tia?  Do you perform often?<br/>
