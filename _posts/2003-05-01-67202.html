 </span></blockquote>It begins, I believe with the *having a child by her father* story ~ icky, <br/>
icky, icky<br/>
Much like the beginning of *A Time To Kill* ~ which is a worthwhile book, if <br/>
you can get past the 25 page rape story... I thought this book was well <br/>
adapted to the big screen... <br/>
