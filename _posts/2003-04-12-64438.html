<div id="ygrps-yiv-753481790">Shel Silverstein also wrote lyrics and collaborated on lyrics which<br/>
talked about drug use and sex and whatnot.<br/>
That&#39;s got to be evil.<br/>
<br/>
I Got Stoned and I Missed It<br/>
<br/>
I was sitting in my basement.<br/>
I just rolled myself a taste<br/>
Of something green and gold and glorious<br/>
To get me through the day.<br/>
Then my friend yelled through the transom<br/>
&quot;Grab your coat and get your hat son,<br/>
There&#39;s a nut down on the corner, <br/>
Givin&#39; dollar bills away&quot;<br/>
But I laid around a bit<br/>
Then I had another hit.<br/>
Then I rolled myself a bomber.<br/>
Then I thought about my mama.<br/>
Then I fooled around, played around<br/>
jacked around a while and then<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and it rolled right by.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned... oh me... oh my.<br/>
<br/>
It took seven months of urgin&#39;<br/>
Just to get that local virgin<br/>
With the sweet face<br/>
Up to my place<br/>
To fool around a bit.<br/>
Next day she woke up rosy,<br/>
And she snuggled up so cozy.<br/>
When she asked me how I liked it,<br/>
Lord it hurts me to admit,<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and it rolled right by.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned... oh me... oh my.<br/>
I&#39;m makin&#39; no excuses<br/>
<br/>
For the many things I uses<br/>
Just to sweeten up my relationships<br/>
And brighten up my day.<br/>
When my earthly race is over<br/>
And I&#39;m ready for the clover<br/>
And they ask me how my life has been<br/>
I guess I&#39;ll have to say,<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and it rolled right by.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it.<br/>
I got stoned... oh me... oh my. <br/>
