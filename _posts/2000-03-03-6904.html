&lt;&lt; The only solution I have thought of so far is to re-educate myself and then<br/>
 share what I am learning in the form of &quot;stories&quot;... and hopefully spawn an<br/>
 interest so that later on they will continue to add pieces to the puzzle as<br/>
 they present themselves in life.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi All, I would like to take a moment to introduce myself and then comment on <br/>
history. I am the unschooling mother of two in Portland Oregon. I love the <br/>
unschooling life and write about it extensively on my home page and in my new <br/>
job, the unschooling editor for Suite101. I am also a freelance writer and <br/>
own way to many pets:)<br/>
<br/>
For us, history is one of the easiest things of all to learn, we use books, <br/>
Like the Witch of Black Bird Pond, to get a feel for the time period. We also <br/>
use movies and further investigate whatever piques our interest. <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know you all and learning from this list:)<br/>
Teri<br/>
