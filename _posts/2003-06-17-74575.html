<div id="ygrps-yiv-154142367"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I will be the first to say that I very rarely send thank you&#39;s.  I used to do<br/>
&gt; that, and then a friend of ours (who was a friend of my husband&#39;s) told me not<br/>
&gt; to bother, bec. she doesn&#39;t expect that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m late on answering this one because I just got up and you guys had a<br/>
field day sending email while it was night over here!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But like so many other things, my answer on thank you cards is that &quot;it<br/>
depends&quot;.  There are people who don&#39;t expect cards, so they don&#39;t usually<br/>
get them from us.  (But they might if I feel like I want to write one!)<br/>
There are people who do expect cards, like the grandparents, and so they get<br/>
thank you cards from us.  I think something so little as cards is worth it<br/>
to keep the peace in the family.<br/>
<br/>
If someone gives a gift in person, then yes, I thank them in person.  But<br/>
(for an example) I coordinated food for a church baseball game this weekend,<br/>
and one person in particular took over an area and did a huge amount of<br/>
work.  I did thank her in person, but I also sent a card.  She made a huge<br/>
difference to me, and I wanted her to know I really did appreciate her hard<br/>
work. <br/>
<br/>
I remind Tim that it would be nice to send a thank you card to his<br/>
grandparents after he receives a gift from them.  (Remember, I live far away<br/>
from them.  I won&#39;t see them next week.)  Sometimes he&#39;s in the mood to<br/>
write a one-sentence note.  Often he dictates the note and then signs it.<br/>
Sometimes he asks me to write it and he draws a picture on it.  I don&#39;t make<br/>
him do it, but I do ask occasionally.  Sometimes it takes quite a while for<br/>
them to happen, because I don&#39;t insist on immediate action, but they do<br/>
eventually happen.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help?<br/>

Raine replies: Yes! Everyone&#39;s input was greatly appreciated! I see that much of it has to do with personal preference, and what we each expect. <br/>
It&#39;s wonderful to be able to pick sooooo many people&#39;s brains with one email (and to get such well thought-out responses)!<br/>
