<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632921911">I don&#39;t know if anyone remembers a discussion from awhile back that <br/>
was had over my daughter Megan being quite the little artist with the <br/>
walls of the house. At one point, I said that if the house had been <br/>
our own, I&#39;d let her have at the wall in one area and not worry about <br/>
it...but with everything going on at the time, just letting it be <br/>
wasn&#39;t an option (if you&#39;ll recall I was having monthly DSS visits <br/>
over other issues). <br/>
<br/>
Back when we lived in Bermuda, my Uncle Pete came to live with us for <br/>
about a year. His girlfriend Robin, now his wife, came to visit for a <br/>
couple weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Just before moving into our new apartment, we stayed with Uncle Pete <br/>
and Aunt Robin for a night. Robin and I had clicked right away when <br/>
we met years ago, and I&#39;m thankful to be living close enough to visit <br/>
more often.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling I think, but there is a point...when we went into the <br/>
entryway of their house, the sunporch, I found that the walls are <br/>
unfinished sheetrock with a few years&#39; worth of &quot;graffiti&quot; on them! <br/>
It was one of those projects that kept seeming to get forgotten to be <br/>
finished, and they&#39;ve decided NOT to finish them but rather keep the <br/>
artwork and such as it is! <br/>
<br/>
:-) Cool, huh?<br/>
