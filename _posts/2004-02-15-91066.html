<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771155874">Hi Everyone,<br/>
It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve posted on this list, but I recently joined<br/>
back up and have been reading for a couple of weeks.  I&#39;m enjoying my stay.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
My question:  There is an unschooling seminar, put on by Pat Farenga coming<br/>
to my state. Has anyone been to one of these before?  It cost $60 and that<br/>
is quite a bit to me.   I am very confident in unschooling so I am not<br/>
looking for someone to validate what I am doing.  I see learning in<br/>
everything the kids do.  But this opportunity doesn&#39;t come to Maine very<br/>
often.  If any of you have been to one of these, do you feel that you got a<br/>
lot out of it besides validation for unschooling?  Any other comments anyone<br/>
has to offer on the seminar?  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Angela<br/>

<br/>
I think you could make better use of that much money!<br/>
<br/>
And if you want to do a really cool thing, go to the conference near Boston <br/>
in August instead anyway, so you can see kids who haven&#39;t been to school (or <br/>
haven&#39;t been lately).<br/>
<br/>
If you were to see Pat Farenga&#39;s kids, I think you would see some who have <br/>
been to school (lately).<br/>
<br/>
But if you do want to go and hear him, it will probably be kinda fun and <br/>
inspiring, and it might be REALLY fun to find out he doesn&#39;t know much you don&#39;t <br/>
already know deep in your sould, but $60 is a lot to pay for that kind of <br/>
satisfaction. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The conference in Boston, though...   a trip with your family, seeing sights, <br/>
meeting people, hearing several different speakers, putting names and faces <br/>
to some of the people on this list...<br/>

<br/>
I would love to be able to go to the conference in Aug.  <br/>
I&#39;m &quot;working&quot; on my DH.  He says that he is supportive of <br/>
unschooling but, whenever I bring up going to a conference, he <br/>
always has some reason as to why we shouldn&#39;t go.  However, this is <br/>
one that I just might go to without him.  <br/>
<br/>
One question, my DD will be 3 by the time the conference rolls <br/>
around and I would need to bring her with me.  I am not comfortable <br/>
leaving her with people that I don&#39;t know (assuming that there is <br/>
some kind of daycare set up), would I be able to bring her to <br/>
the &quot;seminars&quot; with me?  She is really good as long as she has <br/>
something to keep her busy (crayons, or some quiet toys).  Just <br/>
wondering, in case I am able to make it, with or without my hubby.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825863829">Last year there was no daycare as I think you are envisioning it. I had Jayn<br/>
with me who was 3 at the time. She spent her time with me at some talks, in<br/>
the little kids playroom adjoining the main room (set up with crafts and<br/>
toys), with me hovering near the door and listening, with James (we switched<br/>
out a bit), playing with Heather (Shyrley�s daughter) to whom she was<br/>
instantly attached, playing in the funshop room with either us or someone<br/>
else she liked, or swimming with all of us. This year she will probably swim<br/>
even more � since she really can now. Personally I was glad to have James<br/>
with me to switch out (just like at home), but there were lots of parents<br/>
there singly with one or more kids, lots of full families, and lots of Moms<br/>
taking a break without their young kids. I�m sure every experience was<br/>
different, but no-one has come forward to say it wasn�t worth every penny<br/>
and every moment. There was a real sense of community with people keeping a<br/>
gentle eye out for any little one wandering about � but lots more freedom of<br/>
movement for the kids than the hotel was probably used to. I was so happy to<br/>
be there even if I did miss some talks and funshops due to being with Jayn.<br/>
For me the core of the experience is just being around the others, and<br/>
seeing the older children (my future in a way). The chatting groups in the<br/>
hallways, rooms and restaurants are just as valuable as the talks, IMO.<br/>
Expect really late nights ;) <br/>

Sandra,<br/>
Thanks for your response.  If several of you raved about the workshop I<br/>
might have gone to check it out.  But I&#39;ll probably just stay warm at home<br/>
and pay some bills with the money instead. ;0)  <br/>
 <br/>
I loved Teach Your Own, however. It&#39;s one of my favorite books to recommend<br/>
to people.  I was happy to see that the book was in print again, although I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen the new version yet, with the intro by Farenga.  I was really<br/>
happy to read that he was speaking in this state though, because far too<br/>
many people do school -at -home and just don&#39;t trust that their children<br/>
will learn anyways.  If what he says converts some school -at- homers to<br/>
unschooling, it&#39;ll be the best $60 they ever spent.  I however, don&#39;t need<br/>
to be converted.<br/>
 <br/>
With regards to the conference in near Boston. (What town is it actually<br/>
in?)  I hate to drive in Boston.  Taking the train might be an option<br/>
though.  It&#39;d be a great girl friend thing to do.  Leave the kids with the<br/>
hubbies and have a weekend out.  Taking my kids to the conference doesn&#39;t<br/>
really appeal to me because I don&#39;t think they wouldn&#39;t enjoy it.  I can see<br/>
them now, pulling on my leg saying, &quot;when are we going to leave?&quot;  LOL!<br/>
It would be so cool to meet some of the people on this list though.<br/>

Considering the number of kids running all over the place having an absolute<br/>
blast at the last one, both in and out of the funshops, I would bet that<br/>
this would not happen. It�s more like, �Do we have to go home yet?�  The<br/>
difference between this conference and any other one you have ever been to<br/>
(I am thinking of the few professional conferences I have attended in my<br/>
life) is beyond explanation. If they don�t come your experience will be more<br/>
immersive, but don�t stay away because you fear they won�t have fun. BTW the<br/>
conference is in Peabody.<br/>

on the outskirts enough for driving there not to be an issue.  I&#39;ve never<br/>

<br/>
This is something to consider. I guess most of the time when people did<br/>
become overwhelmed, or needed down time they were mostly retiring to their<br/>
rooms in the hotel � sometimes in small groups. Jayn visited with Heather on<br/>
the same floor a couple of times briefly. In addition to the kids engaged in<br/>
different activities in the main areas, there were always bunches traveling<br/>
in the elevators. Some were renewing old friendships from past conferences,<br/>
others making new connections or meeting up with online friends. I guess the<br/>
experience would be different if you weren�t staying at the hotel.<br/>

Oh, I would definitely stay in the hotel if we came.  The kids do love to<br/>
swim, so that would be nice.  Retiring to our hotel room for some quiet time<br/>
is a good idea.  Dh isn&#39;t really interested in going, although he would<br/>
probably come if he felt it was important to me.  I told him he could come<br/>
see all the unschooled kids and see the difference unschooled and schooled<br/>
kids and he replied that he never sees many schooled kids anyway and he<br/>
already believes in unschooling.  LOL!  We are a pretty content lot.  It<br/>
would be cool to meet all you folks though.  I will keep the week-end<br/>
written in on my calendar and see if it works out in the end.  <br/>
