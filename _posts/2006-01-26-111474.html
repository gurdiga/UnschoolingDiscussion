<div id="ygrps-yiv-103727572">&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In this day and age humans are on an instant gratification kick and<br/>
cannot seem to get their minds around gradual change.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are people in certain spiritual circles that believe we will<br/>
continue to use technology to make life easier and easier for all<br/>
humans. And it&#39;s being viewed as a good thing, because it will allow<br/>
for the end of poverty and when everyone has all of their needs met<br/>
with ease, people can focus on spiritual issues and how to solve human<br/>
relationship/community issues rather than worry about how to survive.<br/>
<br/>
So not even all spiritual and mindful people don&#39;t see all the<br/>
&quot;instant gratification&quot; as a problem, just another step in evolution.<br/>
I guess we all won&#39;t be around long enough to know.:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052488936">I&#39;m reading &quot;Midas World&quot; by Frederich Pohl.<br/>
<br/>
(From Amazon) &quot;When Amadeus Amalfi invented the Fusion Power Device,  <br/>
the earth blossomed, for when power is cheap so is everything else.  <br/>
Soon robots did all the work, and people had all the &quot;fun! fun! fun!&quot;  <br/>
But every pipeline has two ends, and despite the stunning triumph of  <br/>
technology, humanity&#39;s success with social engineering was no greater  <br/>
than it had been. Soon the robot factories began to bury mankind in  <br/>
luxury, and the New Poor were forced to spend their lives in frantic  <br/>
consumption so that their masters could live the Simple Life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Really really good book.<br/>

Please rephrase.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been getting a magazine called &quot;Enlightenment.&quot;  I didn&#39;t order  <br/>
it, so I don&#39;t know what caused it to show up.  Maybe it&#39;s a  <br/>
replacement for something else, as I&#39;ve subscribed to a couple of  <br/>
things that fizzled.<br/>
<br/>
This &quot;Enlightenment&quot; magazine has the same appearance, tone and  <br/>
urgency as weight loss or home decorating or fashion magazines.  It&#39;s  <br/>
about how to get enlightenment right now, and faster than your  <br/>
friends and neighbors, and then there are ads, so you can shop to get  <br/>
it cheaper or in a fancier box.   Probably it exists for the sake of  <br/>
the advertisers.  Fashionable yoga outfits, meditation pillows, new  <br/>
age music (recorded, never live)...<br/>
<br/>
People are RUSHING to slow down and to look marvelous doing it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to wash my clothes by the river.  I&#39;m eight or ten miles  <br/>
from a little muddy river anyway (The Rio Grande is politically and  <br/>
geographically important, but physically pretty puny).  I like my  <br/>
washer and dryer.  Perhaps it&#39;s sinful decadence, but my kids have  <br/>
clean clothes.  I LOVE running water that can be turned off with a  <br/>
faucet.  I&#39;m enamored of refrigeration.  Somewhere in there it leads  <br/>
to MUCH transportation of food between nations and continents, which  <br/>
seems sinful and wasteful and bad for the environment, and I do  <br/>
contribute to that when I buy grapes from Chile in the winter.   That  <br/>
has been going on for a long time, though, people importing spices  <br/>
and dried fruits and nuts from foreign places.  England isn&#39;t an  <br/>
orange-growing country but they&#39;ve had access to oranges for 600  <br/>
years or more.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s always someone ready to say the sky is falling and the world  <br/>
is ending and it&#39;s all our fault.  That has been going on since  <br/>
&quot;Biblical times&quot; as far as we know in our historically documented  <br/>
history, and probably in other cultures as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140612288">What I was muddling through with this thought, is that there seems to<br/>
be this idea floating around that if you are really &quot;enlightened&quot; or<br/>
living mindfully, you will disparage &quot;instant gratification&quot; (whatever<br/>
the hell that entails) and live the simple life.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that there ARE mindful, enlightened people that see<br/>
&quot;instant gratification&quot; as part of human evolution and that we will<br/>
continue to use technology to make our lives easier, and it&#39;s OK.:)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that&#39;s clearer.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People are RUSHING to slow down and to look marvelous doing it. &lt;g&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
You can attend a thousand Zen classes at a University and still not<br/>
understand it because it is something that is internal. You can have a<br/>
bunch of nice meditation products and still be angry. You can make a<br/>
big deal out of living simply and still miss all the beauty around you.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about the accoutrements (sp?) but the &quot;seeing with new eyes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Sorta like unschooling.<br/>
You can read all the books, you can talk to unschoolers, attend a<br/>
conference and join some lists. But until you GET IT at the internal<br/>
level, until there is trust and a willingness to extend that trust to<br/>
your children, unschooling is just a nice idea or philosophy to<br/>
discuss...nothing more.  For those that decide to learn to trust<br/>
themselves and their children, they soon find their lives a bubbly,<br/>
interesting swirl of natural learning.<br/>

<br/>
I figured that&#39;s what you meant. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If some zen master or guru is head of a monastery/retreat in the  <br/>
mountains somewhere, he might himself expect some instant  <br/>
gratification if he asks for tea for guests, or if he decides a  <br/>
visitor is being disruptive and needs to pack up and &#39;git.&#39;    There  <br/>
is practice, and then there is management.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of parenting is management.<br/>
Some of unschooling parenting is practice (in the spiritual sense).<br/>
<br/>
Someone can unschool without thinking of it in any spiritual way, but  <br/>
by being methodical in offering freedoms and in acting respectfully.   <br/>
It will work.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something else possible, though, where the methods and  <br/>
freedoms and respect can just become part of our organic selves, so  <br/>
that we aren&#39;t just acting respectfully of our children, but *being*  <br/>
respectful.<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe that&#39;s too controversial a statement for this list.  Some  <br/>
people might run away from it.)<br/>

Here are websites of Buddhist monastaries on four continents.  This  <br/>
isn&#39;t proof of approval of instant gratification, but it&#39;s something  <br/>
to consider.<br/>

<br/>
With unschooling, some people get it quickly.  Some people don&#39;t get  <br/>
it after even years of saying they&#39;re doing it (and trying to do it,  <br/>
but without the spark of &quot;OH!! I get it!&quot;).  Deschooling doesn&#39;t  <br/>
always do the trick, though it does for many people.<br/>
