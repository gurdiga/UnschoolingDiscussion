THANKYOU&gt;<br/>
I agree with you.  Every child is talented in their own way.  I am <br/>
very proud of my children - only one was *gifted* academically.  But <br/>
he wouldnt know where to start if he got a puncture......<br/>
I don&#39;t really care if my youngest dd, who I unschool, never goes to <br/>
university.  I would feel happier, however, if she would do something <br/>
more constructive than watch TV........ OK she doesnt watch TV all <br/>
the time - It always appears that every other unschooler is doing <br/>
something&gt;<br/>
The difference in her emotional state, the confidence and happiness <br/>
that shines through these days, is worth unschooling, even if she <br/>
never learns another thing!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; That&#39;s led us out of church <br/>
 and into a sort of spiritual no-man&#39;s land. We&#39;ve always been <br/>
 arts focused and open to culture, too which is somewhat less <br/>
 embraced in the homeschooling world we&#39;re in.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted you to know that there are others here, like myself, that have <br/>
undergone such a transformation!!<br/>
I was raised in a very legalistic conservative Christian church and have <br/>
totally rejected not only that, but conservative Christianity as a whole.<br/>
I relate to some of the New Age stuff, some Zen stuff, some Christian <br/>
stuff.....the more I study religion the more of a common thread I see among <br/>
many.<br/>
And the more I see the mind control aspects of certain religions.<br/>
Unschooling was really what burst the damn open so to speak, made me question <br/>
more than I ever had.  It&#39;s a hard thing to leave behind all that you were <br/>
taught was good and right growing up....but it&#39;s not hard to live the joyful <br/>
life now that I have left it  all behind. It was a weight of guilt and fear <br/>
that pervaded too much of my thought processes, what a relief to not see the <br/>
world through those lenses anymore.<br/>
Anyway.....I understand.<br/>
And I don&#39;t hang out with conservative Christians, although a few of my <br/>
friends are Christian, they aren&#39;t the damning condemning type.<br/>
We all enjoy HP, Yugio, Mage Knight, crass movies etc....:) <br/>
And if you took a cross section of my friends you&#39;d find an incredibly <br/>
diverse group...which is how I like it.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor asked me why many Christians seem to think their religion is right and <br/>
all others are wrong/false. So my questioning attitude has obviously rubbed <br/>
off!! :)<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

Julie, you&#39;ve been treated with harshness and disrespect.  This was wrong. <br/>
This is not what my fellow &quot;fundies&quot; would not willingly allow or tolerate.  If <br/>
you are ever within the range of Springfield, Missouri, please look us up <br/>
www.fieldtripsonline.org and I assure you this will not be the type of treatment <br/>
to expect.  Unfortunately, &quot;fundies&quot;, like myself are in the minority of what <br/>
you have seen.  I pray that you will be met with kindness, friendship, and love <br/>
from &quot;fundies&quot; that you have never dreamed you would meet.<br/>

spend my time with them.<br/>
