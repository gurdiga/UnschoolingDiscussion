<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096210250">&lt;&lt;unschooling pre-schoolers/kindergarteners&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First thing you want to do is not to think of your kid in terms of what<br/>
grade they would be in in school.  It just keeps you tied into that<br/>
mentality.  Think 3,4 or 5 year olds instead.  (I&#39;m not just being bossy, it<br/>
really does make a huge difference &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 that have never been to school (although they want to try it out in<br/>
the fall &lt;sigh&gt;).  Marsie is 7.  She is &quot;peri-reading&quot; and a hard worker.<br/>
She knows how to add, subtract, write her name, has quite a few sight words<br/>
all without any lessons whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Danny is 5.  He knows his numbers from working the microwave to make snacks.<br/>
He has ZERO interest in reading or writing but is a computer whiz....simply<br/>
because he has been turned loose with it.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle is 4.  She is a terrific artist and knew all her colors at 2.  She<br/>
counts but refuses to use 13 or 17 for some reason.  She is also amazing on<br/>
the computer.  She will say she wants to look at pictures.  She turns on the<br/>
computer....clicks through to digital family photos...clicks on the file she<br/>
wants...etc..<br/>
<br/>
I am one of those moms who basically tries to just stay out of her kids&#39;<br/>
way.  My kids (5) are sparking constantly with the occassional full-blown<br/>
forest fire of delight, learning, and excitement about something.  I work<br/>
hard to just try to keep up with things they are wanting to do.<br/>
<br/>
I have found unschooling to be much easier with the kids that have never<br/>
been to school actually.<br/>

Oops. I also forgot to mention (see? I really WAS tired! lol) that I have<br/>
local unschoolers to rely on and learn from, but none of them have younger<br/>
kids<br/>
and none of them homeschooled from the beginning. At least none of them that<br/>
unschool. I worry about being able to know what he needs and being able to<br/>
&quot;keep<br/>
up with him&quot; as he is pretty bright and seems like he is learning like a<br/>
weed, if that makes any sense. I think I&#39;m doing okay, right now, but I feel<br/>
like<br/>
I&#39;m stumbling blindly.<br/>
This is how things usually run:  When he asks questions about something, I<br/>
answer from what I know. If he still seems curious or asks more questions,<br/>
we<br/>
usually go to books we have around here (we have a lot). If that doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to<br/>
be enough or we don&#39;t have a book, we go to the internet and do a Google<br/>
search. (By the way, I found it extremely humorous to hear my 4 1/2 year old<br/>
ask a<br/>
question and then exclaim, &quot;You can do a Google! We can find it out on the<br/>
computer!! With a search!!!&quot; while he was practically dancing with<br/>
excitement!<br/>
LOL) This usually leads to &quot;philisophical&quot; type questions, and so far, we<br/>
haven&#39;t needed more. If he seems interested in something for more than a few<br/>
days,<br/>
we&#39;ll go to the library and take out a bunch of kids books on the subject.<br/>
I feel like I should have more &quot;sources&quot; for him, more information<br/>
available.<br/>
Personally, I am still tied up in &quot;is he equal or ahead of his grade/peers<br/>
academically&quot;, which I think came from the books I had on what happens at<br/>
each<br/>
age, like rolling over, sitting up, crawling, etc. I DON&#39;T transfer my<br/>
concerns<br/>
about him &quot;keeping up&quot; with him, nor do I even say anything out loud or<br/>
compare. I just look at the schedules of learning for grades, and try to<br/>
leave that<br/>
material around. Sometimes he gets interested in it, and sometimes he<br/>
doesn&#39;t. If he doesn&#39;t, I don&#39;t worry about it, I just put the stuff away<br/>
for laying<br/>
out later.<br/>
At any rate, I guess what I am asking for is some stories about unschooling<br/>
preschoolers/kindergardeners. We don&#39;t have to notify until he the September<br/>
after he turns 6, and I&#39;d like to feel a bit more comfortable that I&#39;m ...<br/>
capable? I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the word I want, but I want that confidence<br/>
before I<br/>
actually have to worry about the official &quot;now we are homeschooling&quot; thing,<br/>
so<br/>
that if I have any problems with my superintendent, I won&#39;t have the poor<br/>
confidence looming over my shoulder when I stand up for my rights.<br/>

I think this is where people get hung up a lot.  We still get nuts, seeing<br/>
our kids as extentions of ourselves.  WE judge them against other kids who<br/>
we see as extentions of thier parents.  And we worry about how others will<br/>
see us, judging us vicariously through our kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think establishing the boundary between us and our kids, seeing them as<br/>
whole individual people, rather than little satellites of ourselves.  One<br/>
thing that really helped me to do that was to get into &quot;the moment&quot; with my<br/>
kids, not thinking about anything but exactly what we are doing right now<br/>
and to be as emotionally and cognitively present as possible.  I became more<br/>
aware of the thought processes behind what the kids were doing.  It helped<br/>
me.<br/>

Hello Sang and others,<br/>
<br/>
   My name is Debi.  I have been on the list several months as a lurker,<br/>
this is my first post.  My children are on the younger side too.  Tyler is<br/>
8, Morgann 6 and Elliott 4, Nevada will be 1 on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of the same concerns as you and unfortunately not any answers.<br/>
I can offer only the comfort that you are not alone.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes (ok honestly quite often) feel this is so easy I must be doing<br/>
it wrong.  No struggles over what to do and what not to do...with deep<br/>
rooted memories of my own school experience, if you don&#39;t hate it and resent<br/>
practicing it over and over it can&#39;t be important.  I know this is not true<br/>
but sometimes the insecurities creep back up.  I wonder ( to myself) as you<br/>
do, &quot;How do they measure up with their peers?&quot;  We are the only unschoolers<br/>
in our homeschool group and it is sometimes hard to keep things in<br/>
perspective.  I hear stories of all these child prodigies and my 8 year old<br/>
still struggles to read.  I know in my heart I am doing what is best for my<br/>
kids.  So how do we gain the confidence?  I don&#39;t know.  I guess through<br/>
years of seeing our children grow and learn we will just relax.  I hope!<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know how other unschoolers have dealt with the insecurities.<br/>
My son Tyler loves to read and we read together all the time but he<br/>
struggles.   Also writing, I see kids he age writing volumes and we can&#39;t<br/>
string a sentence together.  Am I killing his future?  Will these things<br/>
improve without constant prodding?<br/>
<br/>
I know in my heart he has the rest of his life to learn to read and write<br/>
but only such a short time to be a little boy but I can&#39;t help but feel<br/>
inferior to the more traditional homeschooling moms.  I see improvement<br/>
everyday in all my kids.  I am blown away by the things they know.  They<br/>
have unschooled me a LOT.  Most of all they are happy.  They come in each<br/>
day dirty head to toe from a day of exploring.  We spend more time scrubbing<br/>
away dirt from their little bodies then we have ever spent in a workbook.<br/>
How do I relax about the basics and scrub away my insecurities?<br/>
<br/>
Sang,  one thing that has relieved my &quot; officially homeschooling&quot; anxiety is<br/>
telling myself the kids have always been unschoolers.  They learned to turn<br/>
over, get up on all fours, crawl, stand, walk and talk.  I watched and<br/>
marveled at this progression but I didn&#39;t teach them to do it.  The magic<br/>
official age doesn&#39;t change their ability to continue to learn and grow.<br/>
Children are amazing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185194614">&lt;&lt;This usually leads to &quot;philisophical&quot; type questions, and so far, we <br/>
haven&#39;t needed more. If he seems interested in something for more than a few<br/>
days, we&#39;ll go to the library and take out a bunch of kids books on the<br/>
subject.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some author was writing at length about the amazingly deep philosophical<br/>
issues that youngsters will bring up - was it Holt? Does anyone recall<br/>
better than me? I remember that one of the examples given was a tearful boy<br/>
asking close to, &quot;why is it selfish when one person changes the channel but<br/>
not selfish when four people are hogging the tv?&quot; because his visitors were<br/>
preventing him from seeing his favorite program.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;At any rate, I guess what I am asking for is some stories about<br/>
unschooling <br/>
preschoolers/kindergardeners. We don&#39;t have to notify until he the September<br/>
<br/>
after he turns 6, and I&#39;d like to feel a bit more comfortable that I&#39;m ... <br/>
capable? I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the word I want, but I want that confidence<br/>
before I actually have to worry about the official &quot;now we are<br/>
homeschooling&quot; thing, so that if I have any problems with my superintendent,<br/>
I won&#39;t have the poor confidence looming over my shoulder when I stand up<br/>
for my rights.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is 4.5. I think of her as 4.5. That is easier for me because I&#39;m from<br/>
Australia and children are not described as X graders, but by their age. As<br/>
a matter of fact I always find in confusing when I read &quot;A second grader was<br/>
suspended for ...&quot; - so how old were they? And I have trouble translating.<br/>
<br/>
If you are unschooling there are no grades. In your situation you are<br/>
deschooling yourself, as I still am, from the large number of years you<br/>
spent in the school system, which means renouncing your schoolish inner<br/>
language and thoughts. If you really want to get the full wonder of<br/>
unschooling, it is not enough just to bite your tongue around your son,<br/>
although that is a good start! I deliberately never look at any of those<br/>
schedules of learning, or seek out graded materials. Jayn has some workbooks<br/>
that grandparents have given her, that are in with her coloring books. I<br/>
also ignore the recommended age on some books and computer games, getting<br/>
what Jayn expresses interest in. When I get doubts, I hurry over to the<br/>
unschooling.com message boards or list archives for an injection of faith.<br/>
That is, unless Jayn removes those niggling concerns first by some wonderful<br/>
action that shows her personality and development!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How Children Learn&quot; by John Holt is specifically about the younger set - be<br/>
certain to get the latest edition of his books, which he annotated before he<br/>
died. There are places where he added basically, &quot;I don&#39;t believe that<br/>
anymore and I&#39;m sorry I wrote it&quot;. Just wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And the Skylark Sings With Me&quot; also has lots about when the girls were<br/>
little.  New homeschoolers often feel scared of authority. The actual<br/>
number/proportion of people harassed by the superintendents is very small.<br/>
Knowledge is power. Know the laws in your State, as you seem to. My personal<br/>
advice is to stay away from websites that trade in fear, like HSLDA often<br/>
does, and keep visible in your local support group.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I&#39;ve learned about writing and reading in the last couple <br/>
of years is that they way that they go about it in schools, or <br/>
perhaps even structured homeschooling can be backwards for many kids. <br/>
My son has a million stories in his head, but has a very difficult <br/>
time writing. His hand can&#39;t keep up with his head, and even typing <br/>
on the computer is too slow since he&#39;s still hunting and pecking. So <br/>
when he wants to write a story, most of the time he dictates it to me <br/>
and I either type or hand-write it for him. Someone told me that he <br/>
wasn&#39;t really &quot;writing&quot;, but I think that&#39;s totally bogus. If I was <br/>
incapacitated in an accident and became a quadraplegic, and I <br/>
dictated a novel and had someone else type it up, who would be the <br/>
author, me or the typist?? Writing (at least in the creative sense) <br/>
is the process of invention, not the act of making lines and circles <br/>
on paper. That will come along as motor skills progress to the point <br/>
where they can catch up with the brain. Ditto with reading - what&#39;s <br/>
more important - that kids have a love of great stories and can <br/>
imagine them in their heads, or that they learn to make sense of the <br/>
lines and sticks on the page by a certain age? There&#39;s plenty of <br/>
people out there in the world who *can* read, but don&#39;t want to. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my .02 would be that if he wants to write a story, help him <br/>
with the mechanics of it until his handwriting improves. Usually my <br/>
son will write the title page, or even start a story and I&#39;ll help <br/>
him finish it when he gets bogged down. As time has passed, he can <br/>
write more and more. It&#39;s still not easy for him, as it is for other <br/>
kids even younger than him, but he&#39;ll get it in his own time. To me, <br/>
it&#39;s more important that they love and are not frustrated by the <br/>
creative process.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know in my heart he has the rest of his life to learn to read and <br/>
&gt;write but only such a short time to be a little boy but I can&#39;t help <br/>
&gt;but feel inferior to the more traditional homeschooling moms. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are things you can do to reassure yourself - keep a journal, <br/>
keep a file of the stuff your kids write/draw/do, etc. Sometimes if <br/>
you&#39;re struggling with doubts, it helps just to sit down and look at <br/>
how they&#39;re learning, all on their own to do something like write <br/>
more clearly. Or to look at a journal of all the thing you do in a <br/>
day, week, or month. This can be helpful to do, even for a little <br/>
while, until you feel more comfortable just going day by day with the <br/>
knowledge that they&#39;re growing and learning all the time. I think <br/>
it&#39;s helpful to think of all the regular stuff that they learn how to <br/>
do with no instruction. Like look at your children&#39;s pictures. At age <br/>
2 or 3, people are big round circles with lines coming out the side <br/>
for arms and legs. By 4 or 5 or so, the people develop heads and hair <br/>
and belly buttons, fingers and toes. No one sits down with a child <br/>
and tells them that they need to stop drawing round people and start <br/>
making bodies, heads, hair, etc. They just do so, from observing the <br/>
world around them and constantly updating what they can do. This <br/>
organic process occurs with reading and writing too. As they learn <br/>
more words, they spell more of them correctly. As they begin to <br/>
notice grammar, they use it more efficiently in their writing. I <br/>
remember when my son discovered quote marks in books we read. All of <br/>
a sudden, his writing was filled with quotes. <br/>
&quot;Boom!&quot;, &quot;Bang!&quot;, &quot;Wow&quot; he said. was one line I remember. Ditto when <br/>
he discovered exclamation marks. They figure these things out, one at <br/>
a time, the same way they add in belly buttons and hair to drawings. <br/>
If you start to just pay attention to it, you&#39;ll see the growth <br/>
happen before your eyes.<br/>

this year.  I guess I&#39;d look at it like this:  You ARE homeschooling or not <br/>
schooling NOW and he is &quot;learning like a weed&quot; you said, so there&#39;s your <br/>
confidence boost.  And don&#39;t worry about the official &quot;now we are homeschooling&quot; <br/>
because that&#39;s just red tape that other people want to put you through, not <br/>
because they CARE, but because it&#39;s their job to make you fill out papers and make <br/>
your life difficult and to instill fear in you.  Somebody on this very list <br/>
told me not to look so far in the future that I feel overwhelmed and that little <br/>
tidbit helped me immensely because that&#39;s exactly what I was doing.  I was <br/>
thinking of all this stuff that he should know or will he know and high school <br/>
and college and it took that one sentence to make me realize he&#39;s only 6!!!  <br/>
We&#39;ll learn together and cherish every moment.  Twelve years from now is <br/>
irrelevant, the here and now is spectacular, even when we&#39;re too pooped to appreciate <br/>
it right then.<br/>

when they are involved in something, because they dive into stuff with <br/>

when I do get that moment to &quot;really&quot; see what they are doing or even something I <br/>

all. I do fear the authority in this area, basically because there is a <br/>
history of it. The school system actually notified CSB of &quot;abuse&quot; in my unschooling <br/>
friend&#39;s home because she was homeschooling AND protesting giving the super <br/>
more info than was required by law. Fortunately, CSB saw things as they were <br/>
and she was spared TOO much hassle, but I have had a healthy fear of CSB long <br/>
before we had decided on homeschooling, due to our alternate beliefs and ways of <br/>
raising our child/children. I am quite paranoid about them, in fact, so much <br/>
so that it keeps me quiet about sharing much of any information about <br/>
ourselves with anyone. You know how the general popluation is: different is bad. Other <br/>
than THAT, I worry about pretty much nothing! LOL<br/>

<br/>
  Since I started unschooling I&#39;ve gotten over my math insecurities by realizing that math isn&#39;t equations on a page, it&#39;s patterns and sequence, logic and reasoning, real life stuff that no one can go without learning. The basics have nothing to do with the codes school children are taught to write down (most often without understanding). So what about writing? This was the subject I was comfortable with but it was only a few nights ago that I realized worrying about spelling and grammar and structure would get me nowhere. It&#39;s the same thing as math, that stuff is just the language, the code for what writing REALLY is. Writing is really about storytelling. It&#39;s really about telling jokes and family stories and making up tales on the fly. It&#39;s about becoming adept at relating compelling events and drawing others into what you are relating or imagining. The actual physical act of writing stuff down happened thousands upon thousands of years after humans had already become master storytellers and developed complicated myths, beliefs and legends. Why should we be assuming that all of a sudden the physical act is the more important matter? <br/>
    Anyhow, tell stories (real and fantastic), tell jokes, share gossip (the nice stuff), listen to all of his stories and jokes, make language about living not about a struggle with a pencil and your child won&#39;t be able to help but want to master the skill that will let him share his own ideas and stories with others. Maybe it will come later than most kids when he does begin to write, but he&#39;ll likely have a whole lot more to write about. <br/>
      School has spent so many years trying to hitch the cart up in front of the horse. We unschoolers are finally learning the way it should be done.<br/>

&quot;exit&quot;<br/>
when we are trapped in our &quot;parents&#39; ways of parenting&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all try real hard to not always think in terms of teaching. It<br/>
really will help the unschooling go along smoother. By not thinking about<br/>
teaching, you will be able to see learning happening all the time for your<br/>
son. Something that he&#39;s doing for him, not because of you.<br/>
<br/>
And I was wondering what your son could possibly be doing to embarrass you?<br/>
When I go out I often have all 3 younger children with me. They are 9, 8 and<br/>
3. They can get oh so goofy and silly and wound up when out. I can&#39;t say<br/>
I&#39;ve ever been embarrassed by them though. They&#39;re kids!! That&#39;s what kids<br/>
do. And they happen to be loud kids so most of what they say is well heard!<br/>
My 3 year old was walking down the aisle of Walmart the other day and loudly<br/>
announced that &quot;oh oh, I&#39;m about to fart!&quot;<br/>

Hi Sang,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been away for a while, which is why I didn&#39;t respond earlier. I have 3<br/>
young kids--6, 5 and almost 4. This is my second year of *officially*<br/>
unschooling, though I feel it&#39;s a natural extension of my parenting and, in<br/>
a sense, something I&#39;ve just been doing all along.<br/>
<br/>
Please, feel free to check out my website (link below), which has several<br/>
pages and a link to my blog. I&#39;ve got lots of stories there about what *our*<br/>
unschooling looks like on a daily basis and how it translates into schoolish<br/>
learning. You might find it helpful--or not! *g*<br/>
