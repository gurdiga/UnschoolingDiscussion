<div id="ygrps-yiv-353912301">&lt;&lt;How is unschooling working out for a communist in Texas?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that things are going great.  We are doing much better than<br/>
when the kids were in school.  We lived in a very economically segregated<br/>
area of Houston and the kids had a hard time understanding the &quot;haves and<br/>
have nots&quot; of the world.  It was just foreign because all their friends were<br/>
just like them.<br/>
<br/>
Now our friends come from all walks of life and economic levels.  The kids<br/>
are even starting to verbalize how unfair it is that one family (a wonderful<br/>
loving giving family)whose father is garbage man (very necessary job) has 10<br/>
people living in a trailer house and another family (also nice) whose father<br/>
is a scout for a professional baseball team (not to necessary for society at<br/>
large) has a huge house and pool for 3 people.<br/>
<br/>
Its not the kind of stuff people talk about at the local ps  LOL.<br/>
