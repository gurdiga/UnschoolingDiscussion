<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114629337">Well I just read today about this find from 2000. I think they said Montana <br/>
and it was put on display this summer. A duck bill dinosaur that was <br/>
mummified. My point is that they are dating it back 77 million years. Now I <br/>
understand totally how science can be off and wrong and all. But being off <br/>
millions and millions of years???? If there is such evidence for a young <br/>
earth, why wouldn&#39;t the scientists at least try to compromise in their <br/>
thinking some to maybe come to a reasonable conclusion. They say that this <br/>
fossil was embedded in very wet mud from a river bank and I&#39;m thinking flood <br/>
here. But when I saw when it was dated back to, well I&#39;m not sure again what <br/>
to think. It would be nice, whether people believe in the bible or not, that <br/>
we could come to at least a conclusion about our earth itself. I know I&#39;m <br/>
asking a lot but I would think with all the evidence that people say exists, <br/>
a group would be able to scream it all out and reach a conclusion instead of <br/>
having two totally different scenarios.<br/>

Religiourtolerance.org quotes a poll which found that 99.6% of <br/>
scientists believe in evolution and the earth being billions of years <br/>
old. In non-american countries (yes, they do exist....) belief in <br/>
evolution and old earth is something like 97%.<br/>
<br/>
So its not really two groups as such. More like, the majority and a <br/>
tiny portion of American fundamentalists.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always astounded that young-earthers comeup with such <br/>
fantastical explanations that are much more far out than old <br/>
earth/evolution. Some of the explanations are even more non-<br/>
believanble than an invisible diety.<br/>
I once tried to explain the principles of Occams razor and <br/>
radioactive isotrope dating to a fundie. His eyes glazed over and he <br/>
said &#39;Oh that&#39;s philosophy and that&#39;s Satanic.&#39;<br/>
His mind was so narrow he could have squeezed though insect <br/>
screening :-)<br/>
<br/>
This is really my first exposure to Christian fundamentalism and as <br/>
a person who questions everything I find the lack of critical thinking <br/>
strange and somewhat disturbing. If you don&#39;t question things you <br/>
turn into a drone. Someone who believes everything they hear. A <br/>
McPerson.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t think that religiour people should try and label religious <br/>
beliefs as science. Religion encourages faith, science is all about <br/>
questioning and not assuming that something is True.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533240488">I doubt that we can ever make a definite decision unless we can go back in time, and only if we can then verify that we have actually gone back in time, which is a whole &#39;nother cundundrum.<br/>
<br/>
It is an interesting idea for an in depth study.  Someone wondered, and I can&#39;t find the original post so I&#39;m writing it here, about whether they should study the origins of the earth from a creationist or an evolutinary position.  Why not both?  Look at both critically.  Write to different scientist and religious leaders with your questions.  Compare.  Contrast.  Slice and dice.  This could be a study of their whole hs years... What a paper they could write at the end if they chose to stay with this.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of pursuing both ends.  <br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann, who feels as if she has been a pain through this whole thing and somewhat doubts that people actually have a good take on her own position....<br/>

quickly find a different poll.  However, here are a few web sites <br/>
that show what creation scientists believe, including one that <br/>
addresses how  many scientists could be wrong.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is frustrating, and wrong-headed.  We should all be open to new <br/>
ideas, though not believing them without testing them out.  I suspect <br/>
there are a lot of people who believe in evolution that are very <br/>
closed-minded and unwilling to entertain any thought of a creator God.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Christopher Columbus read the Bible and deduced that it <br/>
described a round earth (which it does).  He set out to sail around <br/>
the world to India to tell them about Jesus.  He landed on some <br/>
islands and called them the West Indies.<br/>
