<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have NEVER been sorry about friends I&#39;ve met through  musical activities.<br/>
&gt; Either I&#39;m prejudiced and think all the brightest people are musicians, or<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s something about the mind-workings of musicians that makes them easier<br/>
&gt; for me to understand and get along with.    That&#39;s easy to expect from others<br/>
&gt; who are very physical, or very verbal, or intuitive.  It&#39;s not that I want to<br/>
&gt; do music with  my musician buddies all the time, or even to LISTEN to<br/>
&gt; similarly-shared music, but it&#39;s something about the way they see the world<br/>
&gt; and organize their thoughts that resonates with me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Am I imagining this?  Can anyone else shed light on it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm.  I have a lot of my musically-inclined friends who aren&#39;t musicians<br/>
for a living.  Their brains work in a way that resonates with mine.  But my<br/>
husband, who is my closest friend, plays the cd player, and that&#39;s it.  He&#39;s<br/>
fairly tone-deaf.  <br/>
<br/>
And professional musicians tend to drive me absolutely wacko.  Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
that we&#39;re tuned on the same wavelength, and so there&#39;s static?<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the musicians I grew up with went into the sciences (medicine,<br/>
mainly) rather than music.  I wonder if it&#39;s logic but with room for<br/>
personal expression that appeals in both those areas.  Therefore, as a<br/>
scientist of sorts yourself, Sandra (experimenting with education), that<br/>
same mindset appeals to you?<br/>
<br/>
Interesting thread.<br/>
