My comments: <br/>
<br/>
Think of the whole month of December as &quot;Christmas.&quot;  Think about whether you are correct that they will be disappointed.  Think about whether it might be useful not to shield them from this disappointment (if they are disappointed) -- it seems like a pretty harmless and useful way of figuring out whether they like their presents now or later.  Maybe they like them now, maybe later!  Have one small and special present that you don&#39;t wrap until Christmas (maybe a game the whole family could play?) <br/>
<br/>
Get out all the presents (already opened) and put them back under the tree Xmas eve, so that all the presents they have gotten are all there Xmas morning, reminding them of what they received. <br/>
<br/>
Last Christmas my daughter (then 5)  opened some presents on Christmas day and some didn&#39;t get opened for nearly a week.  She played with each one as it was opened.  She likes to open birthday presents in front of the giver as each child arrives at her party - rather than waiting for some &quot;present opening&quot; time. <br/>

<br/>
I think it should be a simple matter of &quot;if then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IF you want them out you have to leave them alone until Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
If they open them, I would keep them all hidden until time and tell them why.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just put boring stuff there like socks and pajamas and if they open <br/>
them get them to wrap them back up and leave them alone.  Practice gifts. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; but everytime i set one down they are opening them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I can&#39;t imagine a kid just opening a gift I said not to open.  <br/>
But mine have been used to gifts under the tree being basically part of the <br/>
decorations each year and they&#39;ve never even sneaked into one.   Marty likes to <br/>
shake them so we put bells and cans of rocks and stuff in his to disguise real <br/>
sounds.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746494519">Why not ask the kids if they would like you to keep a few back?  Otherwise I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it.  My 7yo had dug through my closet and<br/>
found her birthday gifts.  She knew exactly what she was getting and i knew<br/>
she knew.  I simply wrapped them up anyway and put them out for her on her<br/>
birthday.  She opened them happily.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Personally, I can&#39;t imagine a kid just opening a gift I said not to open.<br/>
But mine have been used to gifts under the tree being basically part of the<br/>
decorations each year and they&#39;ve never even sneaked into one.   Marty likes<br/>
to<br/>
shake them so we put bells and cans of rocks and stuff in his to disguise<br/>
real<br/>
sounds. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been Christmas shopping for qute a few weeks already. Mostly for the 3<br/>
younger kids. They don&#39;t ask for much but what they ask for is specific and<br/>
I want to be sure to find it for them. So anyway, all the gifts are<br/>
unwrapped in my closet kind of hidden. Mostly just so whenever they are<br/>
around and open the closet doors, they won&#39;t see anything. The kids never go<br/>
looking. They are all very much into the surprise of the day, no matter what<br/>
they day is. I try and start to wrap the gifts around a week before<br/>
Christmas and lay them under the tree. I can&#39;t ever remember saying &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
open the presents.&quot; It&#39;s just taken for granted that they are Christmas<br/>
presents and it isn&#39;t Christmas yet.<br/>
<br/>
And Sandra I love the idea of disguising the gifts with sound. Every year<br/>
Joe takes great pleasure in guessing what we got him before he opens it. He<br/>
almost always guesses right. A few rocks or bells should do the trick!!<br/>

Joseph is like that when we go somewhere. He doesn&#39;t like to not know where<br/>
we&#39;re headed. So I usually tell him and not the others. They like the<br/>
surprise and he&#39;s happier knowing what&#39;s in store for us. But when it comes<br/>
to presents, he doesn&#39;t want to know. And I always tease Tara about getting<br/>
her something or coming home swinging bags saying I bought her more<br/>
presents. She&#39;ll whine and ask what they are. I&#39;ll ask her if she really<br/>
wants to know and she doesn&#39;t, she hates to find out ahead of time. She once<br/>
went snooping when she was little, found a Lite Brite we were getting her<br/>
and was all upset until christmas. She had other things of course but just<br/>
didn&#39;t like the idea that she saw something early. She said she never<br/>
snooped after that! Of course I never heard about it until years later!<br/>

I don&#39;t understand however:  How is laying gifts out and then <br/>
telling them to not open them giving them true freedom? I know that <br/>
you aren&#39;t telling me to do so, but I would like to know how that <br/>
worked for your family.  I thought by laying the gifts out and <br/>
letting the kids decide to open them or not was giving them the <br/>
truest form of freedom and respect.  But as you read I am torn b/c I <br/>
can foresee 2 very let down children on xmas morning when that tree <br/>
has only 1-2 gifts maybe instead of 10-15 or however many I can <br/>
afford.<br/>
Thanks for any insights.  By the way have been enjoying your columns <br/>
over at the website.<br/>

<br/>
Well, that is what I thought.  However since I am new to unschooling <br/>
and relaxed parenting, it is kinda like the video game issue.  I <br/>
think since they have never had gifts under the tree waiting there <br/>
till xmas, it&#39;s a temptation they can&#39;t resist.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-688455355">That sounds just like my son.  He cannot handle delayed <br/>
gratification and wants what he wants NOW!  The conservative <br/>

have been lurking and learning here on and off for about a year. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432950032">See I am totally disagreeing on this issue.  I am trying to get my <br/>
kids to learn to grow and make their own decisions now that we have <br/>
moved away from a conservative background with a school in the box <br/>
attitude.  I have been hs for about 7 years now with only the last <br/>
year being unschooled and way more relaxed parenting.  I no longer <br/>
fuss about bedtimes, food issues, clothing, etc.  Every day I am <br/>
getting better.<br/>
<br/>
My main point was I told them they could do what they want with the <br/>
gifts. I am just a little worried they will be utterly disappointed <br/>
on xmas day.  But I want them to make their own way and decisions.<br/>
<br/>
I would never tell my husband what he could or couldn&#39;t do, i.e. <br/>
needing my permission.  And I am trying to do the same with my kids.<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t disrespecting me.  I believe they are just setting <br/>
themselves up for a sadness come that &quot;special&quot; morning.  But maybe <br/>
after so many years of having to wait, they will truly find in <br/>
themselves the desire to wait.  <br/>

In my eyes the gifts became theirs the minute I bought them for them.<br/>

Christmas Eve. (We do half and half - about half the presents Christmas Eve <br/>
in the German way, and the other half in the morning.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I get then that the issue is not so much whether they will be <br/>
disappointed but whether you will be ready to deal with their <br/>
disappointment. Still, the only way all of you will know whether it <br/>
will be a disappointing experience of not is by going through it. So <br/>
this may be or may not be a disappointing XMAS.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to keep in mind is that by altering the way you are handling <br/>
this day you are altering tradition. I&#39;m not talking about a social <br/>
tradition but what is considered a tradition in your family. So I think <br/>
what you might need to take into consideration is tradition. What kinds <br/>
of new traditions can you think up? Since you are ready to give up the <br/>
suspense, in what other way can you bring it into the day? Is this <br/>
something you think your family would be into?<br/>
<br/>
Then, no matter what they may be in for a downer. Change can do that to <br/>
ya. The thing to remember is that change and the disappointment that <br/>
might come with it are OK. When you boiled it down to the bone, a <br/>
tradition is a practice. When you  start a new practice, just as any <br/>
newbie, you will have more misses than hits. But as the cliche goes, <br/>
practice makes perfect. This may not be a perfect XMAS but maybe next <br/>
year will.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, this whole deschooling / unschooling experience has been rife <br/>
with ups and downs for my husband and I. Our kids? Not at all. They <br/>
take our cues from us. Like with the patience thing. Thing1 (Evan) is <br/>
the NOW guy, way more than the little one who is 3 1/2. Of course, used <br/>
to drive me up the wall until after being here for a while and going <br/>
back to yoga, I got that patience is not just a quality one is born <br/>
with, it&#39;s a skill one develops with practice. So every time he gets <br/>
testy because it is not NOW, I remind him (and myself) that what he <br/>
needs is to practice patience. He&#39;s into sports and is learning guitar <br/>
so he understands how much better he gets at things after practicing. <br/>
He hates to hear and yet he smiles because he now takes it as a <br/>
challenge.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you guys may want to take this XMAS as a &quot;practice run&quot; for <br/>
next year. I know, it sounds utterly moronic but that&#39;s the point. If <br/>
you are doing something completely different might as well go all the <br/>
way in the silly department --- a good does of levity might be just <br/>
what you need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335193389">&lt;&lt; And Sandra I love the idea of disguising the gifts with sound. Every year<br/>
 Joe takes great pleasure in guessing what we got him before he opens it. He<br/>
 almost always guesses right. A few rocks or bells should do the trick!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A tradition we&#39;ve had in my family ever since I can remember (my dad started<br/>
it) is to write a clue on each present so we can try and guess what they<br/>
are-so it&#39;s fun to have everything wrapped for awhile so we can sit around<br/>
the tree and ponder what might be in each of the packages. Of course, the<br/>
more cryptic the clue, the better, and we often try to disguise things with<br/>
stuff like rocks and bells too, and wrapping small gifts in big boxes, etc.<br/>
It seems every Christmas there&#39;s at least one that&#39;s got me *totally*<br/>
stumped and we then get to go back and &quot;figure out&quot; the clue once we&#39;ve<br/>
opened the gift.<br/>

own choices.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes they don&#39;t truly understand the consequences of their actions<br/>
and they&#39;d want us to help them. For instance they might want to play in the<br/>
street but they wouldn&#39;t want us to allow them to get hit by a car. They may<br/>
want to hit the dog with a stick, but they wouldn&#39;t want us to allow them to<br/>
get bitten. They&#39;d want us to step in with superior understanding of the big<br/>
picture when they aren&#39;t capapable of grasping it.<br/>
<br/>
You know they&#39;ll be majorly disappointed on Christmas so they really do want<br/>
your help to get them what they want (surprise and lots of presents on<br/>
Christmas).<br/>
<br/>
I think unconsciously you&#39;re treating Christmas as a time to open up the<br/>
door to the toy store. And your unfortunate role is to block their access to<br/>
the door until Christmas day. That seems cruel so it does seem like a better<br/>
choice to let them get the presents as you buy them.<br/>
<br/>
But as others have pointed out, you&#39;ve cut yourself out of the picture. It&#39;s<br/>
a trap that most people fall into with gift giving. It becomes all about the<br/>
recipient getting what he wants and not about the opporunity for the gift<br/>
giver to make someone happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And that&#39;s the source of your dilemma. If your husband found you the perfect<br/>
present, would you want him to treat the gift as yours as soon as he bought<br/>
it? Doing so eliminates his role of being able to *present* it to you. If it<br/>
becomes yours as soon as he buys it, then he becomes more of a conduit that<br/>
changes money into something you want. You might as well buy it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
By setting gift giving up as an opportunity to get, it eliminates that &quot;true<br/>
spirit&quot; that people always decries is missing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that it&#39;s wrong to create a getting opportunity, it&#39;s just that<br/>
you&#39;ve discovered some of the consequences.<br/>

I&#39;ve been Christmas shopping for qute a few weeks already. Mostly for the 3<br/>
younger kids. They don&#39;t ask for much but what they ask for is specific and<br/>
I want to be sure to find it for them. So anyway, all the gifts are<br/>
unwrapped in my closet kind of hidden. Mostly just so whenever they are<br/>
around and open the closet doors, they won&#39;t see anything. The kids never go<br/>
looking. They are all very much into the surprise of the day, no matter what<br/>
they day is. I try and start to wrap the gifts around a week before<br/>
Christmas and lay them under the tree. I can&#39;t ever remember saying &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
open the presents.&quot; It&#39;s just taken for granted that they are Christmas<br/>
presents and it isn&#39;t Christmas yet.<br/>
~~~<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s exactly how it is in my house.  Over the years, one or two of them <br/>
have peeked.  It REALLY ruins it for ME when they do that.  Opening them ahead of <br/>
time has the same effect for me.  I really want that all-together time when <br/>
there&#39;s wrapping paper *everywhere* and the oohs and aahs and the thank-yous <br/>
and the just-what-I-wanteds!<br/>
<br/>
Gift giving is an agreement between two people.  You just don&#39;t open gifts <br/>
unless the giver agrees to it.  That&#39;s why kids (anyone) opening the presents <br/>
without asking just really feels like a punch in the stomach to me.  <br/>

You wrote so clearly and were very helpful. Thanks.<br/>
We are already starting a new tradition.  We decided we are going to <br/>
spend the whole day at home.  Normally, we would rush through gifts, <br/>
pack up and head to 2 families.  Not this year.  This is going to be <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391534249">-=-I know that I am really new here and I am probably mistaken.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand however:  How is laying gifts out and then <br/>
<br/>
telling them to not open them giving them true freedom?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to define &quot;true freedom&quot; and explain why that&#39;s the crux of this <br/>
topic?<br/>
<br/>
I can probably guess. I might guess wrong, but I think you&#39;ve read what we&#39;ve <br/>
written about specific things, like not forcing kids to read, letting them <br/>
choose their own books; not forcing kids to eat, letting them choose their own <br/>
food; not making kids go to bed at some arbitrary early hour; letting them <br/>
choose this&#39;n&#39;that about how and where to sleep; not forcing them to turn the TV <br/>
off, letting them choose what they watch, and extrapolating from that something <br/>
about &quot;true freedom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have a lot of choices in their lives.  They have so many choices it <br/>
might look like &quot;true freedom&quot; to someone who&#39;s used to controlling or being <br/>
controlled or being around a lot of controlling other-families who justify <br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s never been a time I&#39;ve said to my children &quot;I don&#39;t care what you <br/>
do.&quot;  I always care.  I LOVE to know what they&#39;re doing and why they&#39;re making <br/>
those decisions.  They love to know mine too.   It&#39;s part of learning how to be, <br/>
learning what decisions aren&#39;t so great, learning to live in the world in a <br/>
smoothe way so that we can enjoy it and those around us are having a good time <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I thought by laying the gifts out and <br/>
<br/>
letting the kids decide to open them or not was giving them the <br/>
<br/>
truest form of freedom and respect.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you should practice this freedom and respect stuff with things that <br/>
really don&#39;t matter, like whether they eat at one table or another, whether <br/>
they wear the blue jacket or the fuzzy one, or try it without a jacket until they <br/>
get too cold and come back for the jacket.<br/>
<br/>
There should be things to learn from choices, and opening gifts too soon and <br/>
spoiling a holidy might cause them to learn their mom didn&#39;t plan ahead very <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; By the way have been enjoying your columns <br/>
<br/>
over at the website.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s got to be different when  a family makes a big decision to change <br/>
directions instead of just starting with attachment parenting and moving on <br/>
to unschooling a few years later.    I don&#39;t recommend a moment in ANYbody&#39;s <br/>
life when they say &quot;I don&#39;t care what you eat&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t care when you go to <br/>
sleep.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Just like getting lots of gifts instead of one big one, if you say &quot;sure,&quot; <br/>
&quot;okay,&quot; &quot;yes&quot; to lots of requests for watching a movie late or having cake for <br/>
breakfast or them playing another half hour on the swings and you can just read <br/>
a book in the car nearby, then they get TONS of yes, and permission, and <br/>
approval.  If you throw your hands up and say &quot;Whatever,&quot; that&#39;s a disturbing <br/>
moment of mom seeming not to care instead of mom seeming the provider of an <br/>
assortment of joyous approvals.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; My main point was I told them they could do what they want with the <br/>
<br/>
gifts. I am just a little worried they will be utterly disappointed <br/>
<br/>
on xmas day.  But I want them to make their own way and decisions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you shouldn&#39;t have told them that.<br/>
<br/>
You can say &quot;I thought this was a good idea, but it turns out I made a <br/>
mistake.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to model what to do when you mess up.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t &quot;make their own way and decisions&quot; about traditional holidays if <br/>
you don&#39;t show them the traditional way.  Maybe if they said they just didn&#39;t <br/>
want to do Christmas at all anymore, you could let them have their way about <br/>
that.  Last year Holly and Keith decorated the tree without me (I couldn&#39;t get <br/>
up the stairs yet, at that point; I was in the den with a broken leg).  She put <br/>
on flower fairies she had made, and angels.  That was all.    That&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to give them leeway and decision making without just giving <br/>
them power to screw it all up, which is probably NOT power they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My kids aren&#39;t disrespecting me.  I believe they are just setting <br/>
<br/>
themselves up for a sadness come that &quot;special&quot; morning. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s entrapment, on your part, I think.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you MEANT to give them enough rope to hang Christmas, but you <br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve taken our kids to Disneyland.  Holly&#39;s 9th birthday.  It costs money.  <br/>
If we had given the kids that money to hold, in advance, and said &quot;You can <br/>
spend it if you want, but it&#39;s the Disneyland money,&quot; they might have, being <br/>
little, spent it.  If they did, and then we said, &quot;Oh, we can&#39;t go to Disneyland <br/>
now; you spent the money,&quot; that would be cruel.<br/>
<br/>
Some things we need to take care of so the kids still have them.  Wrapped <br/>
gifts, Disneyland money, their bikes and game systems, their favorite clothes, <br/>
etc.   I hate when I hear a mom say &quot;I told him if he left it in the driveway it <br/>
would get ruined/run over/frozen/stolen, and he left it there anyway.&quot;    She <br/>
could have saved that sorrow, but chose not to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In my eyes the gifts became theirs the minute I bought them for them.<br/>
<br/>
Tina&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then you&#39;re doing something foreign to me and I can&#39;t advise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031116959">Oh, I do care.  And they know I care. We talked about what it might <br/>
be like xmas am with no presents.  I meant true freedom as letting <br/>
them find out consequences on their own. I pointed the <br/>
disappointment,etc. out but they wanted to try it.  I&#39;ve always even <br/>
in my &quot;old life&quot; said either yes or no or let me think about it for <br/>
an hour then I&#39;ll tell you what I think.  Never whatever.  Probably <br/>
should&#39;ve never used the word &quot;true&quot;.  Sorry.<br/>
We started out really slowly over a year ago changing our life and <br/>
it has progressed from little issues to this big xmas one.<br/>
But like I said a couple of posts ago, that maybe you haven&#39;t got to <br/>
yet, it has been about 12 hours now that they have left 2 presents <br/>
alone.  To me that&#39;s a good sign that maybe they have been thinking <br/>
about what we talked about.<br/>
