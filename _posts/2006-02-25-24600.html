<div id="ygrps-yiv-668127871">Does anyone have any tips on unschooling/homeschooling as a single <br/>

Thanks for any ideas.<br/>

Do you have any family that would be willing to take care of your kids  while <br/>
you work?<br/>
Can you find any way to work out of your home and hire a responsible teen  or <br/>
college student to help you for the hours you work?  Can you move in  with <br/>
another unschooling family or maybe another single mom?<br/>
 <br/>
My kids were also 7 and 4 when I became a single parent.  My sister  cared <br/>
for them and I bought a house next door to her.  I had to work  full-time the <br/>
first year and then part-time for the next couple of years but was  always able <br/>
to keep them either with me or next door with my sister.  They  are now 16 and <br/>
12 and I&#39;ve been remarried for several years.  <br/>
 <br/>
Other possibilities I thought of were to find a college student who needed  a <br/>
place to live and work hours when they were available to take care of your  <br/>
kids.  I moved across the country in order to live by my sister and I  thought <br/>
it was the best decision I could have made considering the  circumstances at <br/>
the time. <br/>
 <br/>
Not sure of your situation but if you are in a relationship with their  <br/>
father, I&#39;d exhaust every avenue including therapy and even sharing a house as  <br/>
friends before I&#39;d consider leaving.  I could have done that but didn&#39;t  even <br/>
consider it as an option at the time.  I guess I&#39;d just suggest that  you be very <br/>
creative and open to all possibilities. <br/>
