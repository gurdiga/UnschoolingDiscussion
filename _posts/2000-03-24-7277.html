This sounds absolutely fascinating!  Did you have to do it differently than <br/>
you would for chicks?  What did you do with the peacocks after they were <br/>
hatched?  I&#39;d love to know more!<br/>

Basically it is the same....
<br>We hatched out two the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog killed one by
accident (I forgot about those long necks sticking out)&nbsp;&nbsp; and
we took the other one back to it&#39;s mom who had hatched the others so it
wouldn&#39;t be alone.&nbsp; Then we hatched out 3 more.&nbsp;&nbsp; One was
killed when it was several months old...I think it was sick and it wandered
off, and we couldn&#39;t get it in at night, something got it.&nbsp; Then one
died..compacted crop..I think it was poke berries.&nbsp; So we have one
left.&nbsp; He is our pet.&nbsp;&nbsp; His name is Peaky.&nbsp; He thinks
he lives at the house even though we try to convince him he is supposed
to be at the barn.
<br>So, that is probably more than you wanted to know.&nbsp; I really think
he is neat.&nbsp; Sometimes he is a pest..like when I&#39;m trying to plant
and he keeps helping!&nbsp; :)

Sonia,
<br>It has been a great experience for my kids, and for us too.
<br>We bought baby chicks the first few times, but we had full grown chickens
we had bought.&nbsp; So, we have a coop and a pasture for them when they
grow up.
<br>For the eggs you need an incubator until they hatch, and then a brooder
(the box with shavings) for the chicks until they get a bit bigger, then
you should have a place to move them outside.
<br>We have been very lucky to have to experience lots of animals because
we have lots of space to have them.
<br>Yep, we do have a pet peacock.&nbsp; He lives in the barn.&nbsp; But,
he thinks he should live up at our house.
