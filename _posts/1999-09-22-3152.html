<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118371208">Hello all, <br/>
    I am writing with a situation currently occuring in my home, hoping for <br/>
some reassurance or ideas (or both!!).<br/>
    Both of my kids (ages 8 & 6) have spent the last week just playing, <br/>
usually with legos. They lack interest in much else. They are certainly <br/>
involved in their play but it worries me that they have no other interests. <br/>
We took our weekly trip to the library but after that, they have no interest <br/>
in the books (aside from the one I am reading to them nightly, &quot;Ramona The <br/>
Pest&quot;).<br/>
    Has anyone else experienced this kind of lull? Do I just wait it out?? <br/>
This unschooling thing is all new to me and I want to jump in and take <br/>
control!!! Somebody stop me quick!!!<br/>
    Thanks to all, Lori in TX</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088414854">It is so easy to say just relax.  I believe it.  When my children are fighting<br/>
like cats and dogs and seem to just dig in keep on doing it I long for days of<br/>
just playing with legos.<br/>
<br/>
I really do think that children come to the things they need in their own good<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Playing with legos is great and involves planning, focus, concentration,<br/>
persistence, and all sorts of other very desirable qualities which are much more<br/>
important than any &quot;content&quot;.  Being engaged fully in something is what is<br/>
important.  Those qualities will be used for whatever the person needs as they<br/>
grow older.  They will be the best judge of that.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and .....relax.<br/>

<br/>
Good News!!! Your kids aren&#39;t &quot;in a lull&quot;, they&#39;re hard at work -- it&#39;s just<br/>
a challenge for you to be able to see it that way right now.  For you and<br/>
everyone else who finds LEGO to be play instead of work (also read:<br/>
learning), may I suggest a visit to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.weirdrichard.com/zero.htm">http://www.weirdrichard.com/zero.htm</a> ,<br/>

I don&#39;t have any answers for you,  but I understand.....I get concerned<br/>
about my 7.5 yo.  She still seems to get on &#39;boredom&#39; kicks....wants to do<br/>
things only if I&#39;ll do them with her...wants to have a playmate with her(the<br/>
neighborhood gang is in school).  I&#39;d feel better if she had some interest,<br/>
like legos,  but she piddles and watches TV.  We do limit TV some if I think<br/>
the youngsters are watching too much....but not as a punishment - I just<br/>
tsake it as my &#39;wake up&#39; call to plan more outings or things to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037446542">I have my doubts also. Sure, Lego is educational but isn&#39;t it stretching is a bit too far? The world is much richer than even the most elaborate structures built from those blocks. There are stars, books, DNAs, clouds, fish in the ocean, do I need to go on? How will a day after day after day of playing (OK, lets call it learning) through Lego introduce a child to the wonders of the world? If unschooling means child led education a child has to know what paths there are. Sitting at only one thing (whatever that would be at this age) does not seem to be a very natural way to learn about the world. If it were so I do not think our spices would be able to survive. I thought one needs to know her/his options before choosing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448278241">Don&#39;t let the superintendent&#39;s agenda be yours.  Remember this: all of that car<br/>
stuff can be translated into educationalese and teacher-speak which will satisfy<br/>
the most brainwashed &quot;standards&quot; fanatic.  The cult of educators can be appeased<br/>
with a little bit of this and a little bit of that, a dash of jargon, a pinch of<br/>
hyperbole and a long-winded convoluted way of putting things.  You tell I&#39;ve<br/>
done time in school myself.<br/>
<br/>
As for grandparents ......argh! give it up.  They are for the most part, beyond<br/>
our reach... their sons and their daughters are beyond their command .....their<br/>
old road is rapidly fading..... There I knew Bob Dylan would be there when I<br/>
needed him.<br/>

Play is what kids (who are fortunate) get to do to sort out the world.<br/>

it sounds like you need to work on deschooling your expectations (as we<br/>
all do at times).  I know I do when my sons spend hours digging in dirt,<br/>
day after day afer day...we go to the park, and my younger son spends over<br/>
an hour, lying on his stomach, under a bridge, patiently scraping away<br/>
tiny bits of soil.  I sit there and thint that there are at least 8<br/>
varieties of oak trees surrounding us.....let&#39;s do something<br/>
educational......and then he points out to me that there are tiny<br/>
variations in the dirt....some is from rock, some is from decaying matter,<br/>
some is more clay......uh....to me, dirt is dirt, and only means a bigger<br/>
ring arouund the tub, grit in my bed, and more laundry.....but someone has<br/>
to know about the different kinds......even if it is a 3 yo.<br/>

at the long term without having to focus on achieving externally and <br/>
artificially imposed standards. We can read all day long in our jammies if we <br/>
want to(until our voices give out). When my mother and grandmother were both <br/>

tomorrow or even the next day.we are raising happy, healthy individuals whose <br/>
light continues to glow.<br/>
 play is the work of children(and adults, too, only the kids know it and <br/>
we&#39;ve forgotten).  Your kids are doing exactly what they need to do. So be <br/>
gentle with yourself--<br/>
 relax and enjoy, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732608071">I have a cousin -- my age (49) and sharing the same first name.  We were<br/>
always being compared -- I being the academic one.  He didn&#39;t read until<br/>
he was 10.  Was considered learning disabled, and stuck in the &quot;dumb<br/>
kids&quot; class (I don&#39;t even remember hearing the term &quot;learning disabled&quot;<br/>
in the late 50s!)  Couldn&#39;t do math.  Couldn&#39;t spell.  Couldn&#39;t sing.<br/>
Couldn&#39;t draw.<br/>
<br/>
He played with blocks. Endlessly.  Always the same thing.  Making<br/>
tunnels.  Little ones, big ones, short one, curvy ones, straight ones.<br/>
Always tunnels.  Drove his mom (who was not particularly supportive)<br/>
crazy.  When he got to be 12, he started to ride the New York City<br/>
subway system.  Days at a time.  Played hookey from school.  Truant.<br/>
Where was he?  On the subway.  Befriended some of the drivers.<br/>
<br/>
Barely graduated high school (still could barely read).<br/>
<br/>
Today, he is not only an engineer, but designed and built the 3rd<br/>
largest underground railway system in the United States.  He is called<br/>
to consult around the world.<br/>
<br/>
Still doesn&#39;t read much.  Never addresses a large public audience.<br/>
Still goes to new towns in faraway countries, and instead of seeing the<br/>
sights, rides their underground railways, making friends with all the<br/>
conductors.  For him, these are the sights.  Married, 3 wonderful<br/>
children.  Has legos in his office.<br/>

&gt;&gt;      &gt; Hello all,<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt;     I am writing with a situation currently occuring in<br/>
&gt;&gt;      my home, hoping<br/>
&gt;&gt;      for<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt; some reassurance or ideas (or both!!).<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt;     Both of my kids (ages 8 & 6) have spent the last<br/>
&gt;&gt;      week just playing,<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt; usually with legos. They lack interest in much else.<br/>
&gt;&gt;      They are certainly<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt; involved in their play but it worries me that they have<br/>
&gt;&gt;      no other<br/>
&gt;&gt;      interests.<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt; We took our weekly trip to the library but after that,<br/>
&gt;&gt;      they have no<br/>
&gt;&gt;      interest<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt; in the books (aside from the one I am reading to them<br/>
&gt;&gt;      nightly, &quot;Ramona The<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt; Pest&quot;).<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt;     Has anyone else experienced this kind of lull? Do I<br/>
&gt;&gt;      just wait it out??<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt; This unschooling thing is all new to me and I want to<br/>
&gt;&gt;      jump in and take<br/>
&gt;&gt;      &gt; control!!! Somebody stop me quick!!!<br/>

parents are wonderful, loving people who have different views now than I<br/>
do. I suppose I can only hope that my son develops a strong sense of<br/>
himself as well someday. (He is already pretty opinionated!)<br/>

I have a friend who is going to the GWS conference this weekend. (We were<br/>

sounds wonderful!  i wonder what you are expecting of them?  play is their <br/>
work, remember?  they are immersed in learning and expanding their brains-- <br/>
my kids did the same thing...  only it was dress up play.  i loved it...  <br/>
when they were so into it and then we would read togther, too-- that&#39;d be <br/>

I encourage you to cut back on the amount of time *you* spend playing with <br/>
the cars, or looking at the cars, and find something that you enjoy more to <br/>
do with your time.  (I know many moms don&#39;t have a lot of free time, but <br/>
grabbing some of it and persuing your OWN interests is part of the whole <br/>

This doesn&#39;t happen much lately because my son likes to seek me out to talk<br/>
about his projects or play with him, or just to watch him play on the<br/>
computer! In between I try to tackle some housework. I have been trying to<br/>
do something of interest to me on occasion, even if it is rolling pennies<br/>
and sorting or organizing things. Sometimes my son will join in and ask<br/>
questions. It&#39;s hard to even think of what it is I would do with real free<br/>
time...hmmm...<br/>

just discuss possibilities when they ask questions.  We have a variety of <br/>
books that help answer a variety of questions, of course.  Sometimes they <br/>
want to know more than I can give with my limited knowledge, sometimes they <br/>
don&#39;t.  For me, the key is helping them keep their natural curiosity - asking <br/>
questions and being able to search out answers.  <br/>
