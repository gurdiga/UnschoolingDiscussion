<div id="ygrps-yiv-919904709">&lt;with the man on the bench.  He said to me, &quot;My mom scared me.&quot;  I said,<br/>
&quot;She was worried about you because you wandered off.&quot;  He just looked at<br/>
me and said, &quot;No.  She doesn&#39;t care about me.  She doesn&#39;t even care<br/>
whether I grow up.&quot;  I didn&#39;t know what to say to him.  He was about<br/>
four.  She didn&#39;t look at him again until she was ready to go home.&gt;<br/>
That kind of stuff kills me. I just think of some of my closest friends who prayed and prayed for a child and had trouble conceiving (or one friend who&#39;s baby died in her arms, born at 27 weeks) and I just can&#39;t understand how someone could treat their own child  with such carelessness. Sad, really sad! Kelli<br/>
