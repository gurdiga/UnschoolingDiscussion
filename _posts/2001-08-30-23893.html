<div id="ygrps-yiv-932006244">My turn to think about these and answer them (this is fun)....Dawn<br/>
<br/>
1.  He&#39;s a midget and uses his umbrella to push the top button.<br/>
2.    The man and his son are in 2 different accidents at different times of <br/>
the year.  The father that died is the local priest.<br/>
3.    The whites of his eyes<br/>
4.    They were playing pretend and it was neither of their birthdays in the <br/>
first place.<br/>
5.    You don&#39;t have to line up the covers with the corners.<br/>
6.    The poison was put in after he left the party.<br/>
7.    All women are called Eve in Heaven and all men Adam???<br/>
8.    One is adopted.<br/>
9.    The man is speaking in a foreign language that sounds to the barman <br/>
like he&#39;s asking to see his gun.<br/>
10.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;   1. There is a man who lives on the top floor of a very tall building.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Everyday he gets the elevator down to the ground floor to leave the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   building to go to work. Upon returning from work though, he can only <br/>
&gt; &gt;travel<br/>
&gt; &gt;   half way up in the lift and has to walk the rest of the way unless it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;   raining! Why?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   2. A man and his son are in a car accident. The father dies on the <br/>
&gt; &gt;scene,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   but the child is rushed to the hospital. When he arrives the surgeon <br/>
&gt; &gt;says,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &quot;I can&#39;t operate on this boy, he is my son!&quot; How can this be?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   3. A man is wearing black. Black shoes, socks, trousers, jumper, gloves <br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   balaclava. He is walking down a black street with all the street lamps <br/>
&gt; &gt;off.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   A black car is coming towards him with its light off but somehow <br/>
&gt; manages <br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   stop in time. How did the driver see the man?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   4. One day Kerry celebrated her birthday. Two days later her older twin<br/>
&gt; &gt;   brother, Terry, celebrated his birthday. How?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   5. Why is it better to have round manhole covers than square ones?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   6. A man went to a party and drank some of the punch. He then left <br/>
&gt; &gt;early.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Everyone else at the party who drank the punch subsequently died of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   poisoning. Why did the man not die?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   7. A man died and went to Heaven. There were thousands of other people<br/>
&gt; &gt;   there. They were all naked and all looked as they did at the age of 21. <br/>
&gt; &gt;He<br/>
&gt; &gt;   looked around to see if there was anyone he recognized. He saw a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and he knew immediately that they were Adam and Eve. How did he know?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   8. A woman had two sons who were born on the same hour of the same day &gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the same year. But they were not twins. How could this be so?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   9. A man walks into a bar and asks the barman for a glass of water. The<br/>
&gt; &gt;   barman pulls out a gun and points it at the man. The man says &#39;Thank <br/>
&gt; &gt;you&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and walks out.<br/>
