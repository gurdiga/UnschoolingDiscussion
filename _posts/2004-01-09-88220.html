<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341841210">Two days before Christmas we came home from shopping to see a dugite<br/>
disappear behind a bench in my husband&#39;s workshop/smoking room. This room is<br/>
an enclosed area at the side of the house. We shut the kids and dog in the<br/>
house and two hours later (after much searching and mess making) we found<br/>
the snake. It was about a metre long, and angry!<br/>
<br/>
Last year I ripped up the kids chore charts and relaxed a bit about the<br/>
state of the house. The result has been a rodent problem and lots of area in<br/>
the kid&#39;s rooms for spiders and snakes. I&#39;ve spent the last week<br/>
decluttering and keeping the floors as clear and clean as possible.<br/>
<br/>
My dilemma is that I cannot keep the house as clean and tidy as it needs to<br/>
be without help and still have time to spend with the kids. My husband is<br/>
really worried about one of the kids being bitten and wants the house to be<br/>
tidy but doesn&#39;t want that responsibility to fall solely on me. He helps<br/>
when he can but is pretty tired at the end of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas for &#39;enlisting&#39; the kids help and getting them to be responsible<br/>
for some of their mess without returning to chore charts and punishments?<br/>
What would you do in this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a highly venomous snake also known as the western brown snake, pretty<br/>

<br/>
This is encouraging Stepheny. I&#39;ll just keep asking (nicely) and reminding<br/>
them I need help and hope it works for me. Bringing money into the equation<br/>
might increase productivity too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying really hard to find a balance between caution and fear. I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s fair to our fears onto our kids but I do want them to be mindful<br/>
of the dangers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After the discussion of natural consequences a few days ago, this would be <br/>
a perfect example. If don&#39;t keep the house clean, we may have poisonous <br/>
snakes and other undesirables coming in. unfortunately this is one of the <br/>
more dangerous ones.<br/>
<br/>
My first saucy thought was &quot;move to Nova Scotia.&quot;  More helpfully, how old <br/>
are your kids? Have you talked to them about the problem and the results? <br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure my 11 and 8 year olds would do more housework if it meant <br/>
keeping poisonous animals out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
If the biggest problem is food attracting the vermin, then it might be easy <br/>
to confine food to certain areas that can be cleaned up frequently.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you have just recently torn up the chore charts etc., <br/>
your kids may think anything you do to get them to help out is coercion. <br/>
You may have to do a lot of talking.<br/>

Julie, I didn&#39;t know what a dugite was until you said snake and I&#39;m interested.  What type of snake is that?  <br/>
<br/>
We are having the same problem with the relaxing on the kids and chores and it is overwhelming.  I finally had to say I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do it myself and would you mind doing this or that.    It is working, and I also pay them when they can.  I told them they would be responsible for their own clothes, meaning getting them to the hamper to be washed, helping with folding and drying.  The oldest on is 14 and she will go straight to the sink and wash dishes with no problem at all, and most things she is like that with.  When I read you had a dugite I knew I didn&#39;t want one of those what ever they were, LOL.  I have started putting things away in bins, and when they ask for something I tell them it is in storage and they can go look if they want it.   I also made a list of things to do today and couragesly asked one of the kids to write something down on it and then cross it off because I had done it, ya know like Frog and Toad... got a big smile for that one.  I&#39;ll be praying.  Stepheny<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833999685">LOL  Luddite popped into my mind when I read it, so I likened dugite to the rhyming word and kept picturing some Walt Whitman looking transient who had renounced holes (&quot;dug&quot;) or something, crouching behind the bench. It was quite a humorous image!<br/>
<br/>
Julie, I know what you mean, though not to your extent! Southern Maryland, where we live, is _very_ wet and humid, and we have bugs like you might find in the rain forest! &lt;g&gt; Seriously, we have wolf spiders here that rival tarantulas--they are the largest spiders I have ever seen outside of captivity (and I DON&#39;T like spiders!). I also became an &quot;expert&quot; on cockroaches this spring because I was finding some in my house. Turns out that they were, thankfully, wood cockroaches that don&#39;t infest homes but often find their way into homes during wet springs, and we had the wettest year on record last year. Our family room is the basement of our split level home, so this is where the bugs come in.<br/>
<br/>
I pretty much just say to the kids that we need to pick up and vacuum fairly regularly if we don&#39;t want bugs. They&#39;ve found them often enough that they understand that bugs and spiders will hide under their dress-up clothes, etc. They don&#39;t much like that!  My kids are really very good about helping to do a quick pick up so that I can run a vacuum as long as I am there helping them. I don&#39;t have them put everything back in its &quot;proper&quot; place (once in a while for sanity we do a real clean up), and they know they can put whatever it is they are playing with or working on up on a piece of furniture while I vacuum. My youngest says constantly, &quot;you done now mama?&quot; and as soon as I am, they all jump down and run like wild things, shouting &quot;yeah, we can run, we can run!&quot;  because the floor is not all cluttered with sharp little toys. So there are upsides to picking up, and it doesn&#39;t have to be whole sale or stressful or anything. With everyone working together it takes maybe 15 minutes to pick up and vacuum--not too big a deal.<br/>
<br/>
I think the key is to enlist their help by explaining your reasons and fears. They might have some really good ideas too that you hadn&#39;t thought of. I&#39;m a big fan of presenting problems or issues as something for the whole family to deal with--the process is very productive and everyone owns the outcome. Dh and I might talk about things first by ourselves, depending upon the magnitude of the situation, but before we do anything we present to the kids and get their input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619047013">Jules, I was also thinking about snakes coming in the house this morning on my way taking my son to work.  I had a green snake of a pretty good size just slither into the house one day as I was standing there with the door open.  My son started saying snake, snake! and I didn&#39;t realize it until it was wrapping itself around my feet. Ugh!  That feeling never goes away for sure.  I don&#39;t know why he came in, sometimes they just do make it in there and I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t want to be.  It could have been just a mistake on his part.  I know that my  laundry room makes me nervous sometimes as I have a doggie door and I know that only doggies don&#39;t use them.  There was a woman that had been bitten on the wrist because a poisonous snake had decided to sit in her dirty laundry that was on the floor in front of the washer.  So I will be cautious out there and did buy hampers for the clothes rather than have them bunched up on the floor.  I will be happy if the kids can get their clothes in them, also that they would sort it on the way there too ROFL, I can dream.  Here in FL we can bring home nasty roaches just by coming in with groceries as they hide in bags and boxes so I have someone spray every month and step up on getting rid of them when I see them.  We also had some rodents not to long ago, I don&#39;t think they came in because we are messy, but once I noticed them I stepped up on keeping kitchen clean and trash out until we (kitties and me) got rid of them.  Just my thoughts.  Stepheny<br/>

<br/>
What would you do in this situation? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d get all the kids to help in each room, have good music on, say everything <br/>
needs to be moved or picked up every-so-often so you don&#39;t get mice and <br/>
spiders.   <br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re going out or going to bed and there&#39;s stuff where it can&#39;t safely <br/>
be, ask them to pick it up before they go to bed.   Help them if you&#39;re there.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re talking about an immediate need and a reality, not just kids needing <br/>
to &quot;do chores&quot; because their parents and grandparents did &quot;and look how good <br/>
they turned out&quot; kind of removed-from-reality stuff.   It&#39;s not just kids being <br/>
made to keep a house looking as though the family has servants to clean it <br/>
because the mom wants to impress a friend or relative they hardly know.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I finally had to say I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do it myself and would you mind <br/>
doing this or that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone ever recommended telling kids &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll do it <br/>
all myself,&quot; so sometimes when I hear the problems being caused I&#39;m curious as <br/>
to how it was presented.   <br/>
<br/>
But just as with school, if kids were &quot;made to work&quot; and it was considered <br/>
something to be avoided, their first instinct will be to avoid it, and maybe the <br/>
more pressure and work there was when it was required, the longer and more <br/>
intensely they&#39;ll want to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
But not cleaning all the time isn&#39;t the opposite of making a horrible mess on <br/>
purpose.  <br/>
<br/>
If kids (not the person whose post is quoted up above, but general kids in <br/>
general) are celebrating freedom by MAKING messes, that&#39;s not productive at all, <br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t claim &quot;unschooling&quot; if kids are purposely pouring sodas out in <br/>
the van or anything LIKE that.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the issues we&#39;ve ever discussed here, I think the housework and chores <br/>
is the most marginal of all to unschooling, and I&#39;m a little nervous at the <br/>
effect.  Maybe something Joyce alluded to is true, that there are more advanced <br/>
levels of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
If a family shows up here who&#39;s still doing school at home and wants to <br/>
unschool, maybe the talk about food and chores and bedtimes is just going to <br/>
overwhelm and confuse them.  Because there CAN be unschooling in a family where kids <br/>
also have chores and bedtimes and have to clean their plates.   I don&#39;t <br/>
personally think it will have the depth or benefit, ultimately, as a house where <br/>
the children&#39;s preferences and freedoms have high priority, but it could still <br/>
absolutely be, in homeschooling terms, unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If a family quits all their routines and the kids go crazy eating candy and <br/>
watching TV because they never got to before, but the parents still don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; <br/>
unschooling and so are still pressing &quot;schoolwork,&quot; what a mess THAT is going <br/>
to be.   It&#39;s not just carts before horses, it might be climbing into the <br/>
cart and hopping up and down before they&#39;re even sure what a horse is.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that&#39;s not happening.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t guess this is a problem particular to unschooling, though.  Some <br/>
people dress like skaters without getting wheels of any sort.  I&#39;m just concerned <br/>
for the effect on confused families, and the reputation of unschooling, and <br/>
the clarity and peace of the list.<br/>

<br/>
But logic and honesty aren&#39;t unfair.<br/>
<br/>
My mom, who had grown up in Texas, used to tell us if we ate in our rooms, <br/>
the rooms would be full of ants and mice.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in Texas, but not in northern New Mexico.   <br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s what to do about ants:  Feed them at their nest, and they won&#39;t <br/>
hike into the house for food.  (Someone taught me that about camping.  As soon <br/>
as you camp, if there&#39;s an ant bed nearby, give them more than a weekend&#39;s <br/>
worth of food.  They&#39;ll be ecstatically busy at their own mound and leave you <br/>
entirely alone.)<br/>
<br/>
So if what&#39;s being said is honest and true, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coercion, it&#39;s <br/>
persuasion, and persuasion is a good skill to have.<br/>

The kids&#39; rooms have not yet had any vermin problems of any sort, but it does <br/>

thinking due to life experience?  I am at the tail end of raising 6 boys, the <br/>
oldest will be 31 next month, all 4 of the older boys went through the ps system <br/>
with the exception of 1 year we hs&#39;d with 5 of them. We came to hsing as a <br/>
lifestyle later in the game, our youngest 2 were about 7 and 10 when we pulled them <br/>
out of school. That was 5 years ago and it has been a gradual journey to <br/>
unschooling, I knew about unschooling and felt that was the path we were heading <br/>
towards but allowed myself the time I needed to let go. We always take summer <br/>
off and just never went back in the fall, it just happened, I never even <br/>
thought about it until recently.<br/>
<br/>
However, I find that I am able to grasp a whole lot of what I am reading here <br/>
and have been reading in the archives and that in very many ways we are <br/>
already living it. I think this is because first of all I think a lot, maybe too <br/>
much, LOL but also that having lived both sides, that of having kids in school <br/>
and now out of school and having just lived through raising 4 kids to adulthood <br/>
already I am better able to look back and see where so many things I worried <br/>
about or thought I had to do something about was really never in my control <br/>
anyhow. (It was an illusion)<br/>
<br/>
I have learned along the way that often if I just shut up things go OK and I <br/>
don&#39;t have to do anything about it. That was a hard lesson to learn but one <br/>
that is priceless. For example yesterday my 16yros came to me and told me he had <br/>
given it a lot of thought and he wanted to return to school next year. A few <br/>
years ago I would have been devastated but for some reason that has changed. <br/>
We talked about it a little, I mean I really don&#39;t want him to go but he had <br/>
some good reasons and so I asked him what grade he wanted to be in, he answered <br/>
11th. So, I told him what he would need to do to be able to enter that grade <br/>
in our school district and he set off to start.<br/>
<br/>
My 12yros and I had some errands to run and were gone most of the day. When <br/>
we got back I asked the 16yro how it was going and he told me upon further <br/>
thought he won&#39;t be going, after all he can drive soon and make friends and find <br/>
girls that way. So many things have been working out this way if I just let it <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want this to end up sounding ooey gooey I just wanted to share my <br/>
thought.<br/>

doing this or that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a particular attitude I had myself, not something someone told me.  I think.  The process of deschooling may be where this came in because at one time chores were a part of our school... I hate writing this because it is like so stupid now. LOL.  So deschooling would involve getting rid of chore charts etc. and then after a while things start getting put back where they were but in a different perspective.  That is the way I&#39;m seeing it now.  After going to the Live and Learn Conference, reading lots about unschooling I gradually saw that &quot;Hey they are not doing absolutely nothing&quot; and it just kind of dawned on me.  They are doing more in a different light, everything is learning, interaction with the kids not the I am the teacher you are the student.&quot;  I actually know some parents that have a separate school room to go to..... and some kids have to call their parents Mrs so and so because that makes it more official.  I could never do that and have always been called undisciplined and the kids would be better off in school etc.  So I basically keep to myself, this group and a friendly relaxed homeschool support group.  I got the kids alot of games for Christmas, and I just love how things are going here in our home.  I have one interested in Shakespeare and poetry, another that loves penpaling and such, and their interests are just jumping by leaps and bounds.  I thank everyone for their input on this list.

I don&#39;t think anyone ever recommended telling kids &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll do it <br/>
all myself,&quot; so sometimes when I hear the problems being caused I&#39;m curious as <br/>
to how it was presented.   <br/>

because they can make their own kinds of messes.   <br/>
<br/>
Right my point exactly.  And so I had to help them catch them.  And you are right pretty darn icky.  One of them was too big for the cat but he got it anyway and then let it go to play with it!  Well we got em and that doesn&#39;t mean their cousins wouldn&#39;t move in.  Here in Fl with the too wet one min, too dry the next creatures are running from/too water constantly.  Living in mobile homes allows them access to places I don&#39;t want them.  I stuffed steel wool in a hole under the sink hoping they would eat it or get the message and they just moved it~ Ok enought about all that LOL  Stepheny<br/>

I think you have a valid point.  This is a trap we fell into when we first<br/>
released the controls after unschooling for a couple of years.  I had been<br/>
told over and over that kids would learn to self-regulate on things if I<br/>
would just be patient.  I thought that meant that I should completely back<br/>
off and the kids would stop doing &quot;insane&quot; things.  Example:  The kids<br/>
wouldn&#39;t quit jumping on my bed, even though I asked them not to and<br/>
explained why (old mattress, old bed, no money for that right now, etc.).  I<br/>
felt that if I kicked them out of my room, they weren&#39;t &quot;self-regulating&quot;.<br/>
I was regulating them by punishing them by kicking them out of my room when<br/>
they jumped on the bed..  And I had been told over and over that punishment<br/>
was counter-productive.<br/>
<br/>
It took a while for me to find the difference between punishment and<br/>
consequences due to lack of personal responsibility.  I finally came to the<br/>
principle of &quot;not doing harm&quot; and that has helped me understand where the<br/>
line is.  But it is, I think, a progession, a maturing into unschooling.<br/>

I have been thinking about this.  I wonder if when people suddenly let loose<br/>
of all the controls and aren&#39;t sure where that line between punishment and<br/>
consequences due to lack of personal responsibility is, if perhaps the kids<br/>
start to act out resentments toward the parents.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of how you might treat a bossy older brother who suddenly had no power<br/>
over you anymore.....I can see where kids might act out in ways that perhaps<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t if they had always been raised in freedom and respect.<br/>

My first encounter with a palmetto bug is so funny now.  In the motel I was staying at I heard a rustling in bags I had by the door.  I thought it was a mouse at first, and then the darn thing came out and looked at me.... and I said you are no mouse.  Well I thought I would be alright, I would just make sure it stayed on the floor and didn&#39;t get on me or the kids......but no it climbed the wall.  I ran out of the room to tell the manager that there was a creature in my room.  He asks me if its a cockroach,  Like none I&#39;ve ever seen!  It took him 3 or 4 times hitting it with my ked to kill it.  I thought I was cured, and then the giant grasshopper..... 7 years later I was living here.  The weather is beautiful, and the kids are amazed at how far I&#39;ve come.  If its in my house, it doesn&#39;t belong in here, thats it.  Stepheny<br/>

thought that meant that I should completely back off and the kids would stop <br/>
doing &quot;insane&quot; things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is where I am with my 3 and 4 year old.  I am unsure of how to let my <br/>
children make choices, without them going &quot;insane.&quot;  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it <br/>
is not that I never let my children make choices, it is just that I know I <br/>
also am too controlling in certain areas.  I also do timeouts with my <br/>
children, and do not want to do that anymore as I do not think it helps.  My <br/>
main worry is that my children will just not listen to me anymore if I do <br/>
not impose my own consequences.<br/>
<br/>
For example, let&#39;s say that my children are having a bath and one is <br/>
purposely bothering the other one.  Before, I would ask my child what was <br/>
wrong, why they were doing that, etc.  I would encourage the one being <br/>
bothered to ask the other one to stop or see if they could work something <br/>
out together.  If the behaviour did not stop, I would tell the one doing the <br/>
bothering that they would need to stop or I would take them out of the bath. <br/>
  So this is a parent-delivered consequence, right?<br/>
<br/>
Now if I did not take the child out of the bath, what would I do?  It isn&#39;t <br/>
fair to the child who is trying to play and is continually being bothered.  <br/>
And if I don&#39;t do anything about it, will my children see me as being <br/>
somebody they don&#39;t need to listen to?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you - I am trying to figure out the right balance for situations such <br/>
as these.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I finally had to say I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do it myself and would you <br/>
&gt;mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing this or that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think anyone ever recommended telling kids &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll do<br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt; all myself,&quot; so sometimes when I hear the problems being caused I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;curious as<br/>
&gt; &gt; to how it was presented.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But just as with school, if kids were &quot;made to work&quot; and it was <br/>
&gt;considered<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; something to be avoided, their first instinct will be to avoid it, and<br/>
&gt;maybe the<br/>
&gt; &gt; more pressure and work there was when it was required, the longer and <br/>
&gt;more<br/>
&gt; &gt; intensely they&#39;ll want to avoid it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But not cleaning all the time isn&#39;t the opposite of making a horrible <br/>
&gt;mess<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of all the issues we&#39;ve ever discussed here, I think the housework and<br/>
&gt;chores<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the most marginal of all to unschooling, and I&#39;m a little nervous at<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; effect.  Maybe something Joyce alluded to is true, that there are more<br/>
&gt;advanced<br/>
&gt; &gt; levels of unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If a family shows up here who&#39;s still doing school at home and wants to<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschool, maybe the talk about food and chores and bedtimes is just <br/>
&gt;going<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; overwhelm and confuse them.  Because there CAN be unschooling in a <br/>
&gt;family<br/>
&gt;where kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; also have chores and bedtimes and have to clean their plates.   I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; personally think it will have the depth or benefit, ultimately, as a <br/>
&gt;house<br/>
&gt;where<br/>
&gt; &gt; the children&#39;s preferences and freedoms have high priority, but it could<br/>
&gt;still<br/>
&gt; &gt; absolutely be, in homeschooling terms, unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If a family quits all their routines and the kids go crazy eating candy<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; watching TV because they never got to before, but the parents still <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&quot;get&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling and so are still pressing &quot;schoolwork,&quot; what a mess THAT is<br/>
&gt;going<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be.   It&#39;s not just carts before horses, it might be climbing into <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cart and hopping up and down before they&#39;re even sure what a horse is.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I hope that&#39;s not happening.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t guess this is a problem particular to unschooling, though.  Some<br/>
&gt; &gt; people dress like skaters without getting wheels of any sort.  I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt;concerned<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the effect on confused families, and the reputation of unschooling,<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the clarity and peace of the list.<br/>

How about talking to the kids about the problems?  They might want to help if <br/>
they understood the seriousness of the situation. You can also ask for help <br/>
with specific chores and work with a kid or two using this as talking time.  <br/>
This only works with my kids if I make sure that I&#39;m really asking and respect <br/>
if they are busy.  <br/>

alive in the wild. As in my back yard under the bush while I was raking and<br/>
disturbing where they were. And let me tell you they were about as big as<br/>

the ants at a certain time during the year. They drive me nuts!!!!! But<br/>

I see punishment as spanking, grounding, withholding privileges or allowance.<br/>
<br/>
If someone jumps on the bed and you want them to stop, saying &quot;Stop jumping <br/>
on the bed&quot; isn&#39;t punishment.   It&#39;s you defending your property and the peace <br/>
of your room.   <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So you would see &quot;stop jumping on the bed&quot; as a consequence maybe?  (You <br/>
didn&#39;t give an example, so I&#39;m guessing.)<br/>
<br/>
I just see it as an expression of preference which could get stronger, ro a <br/>
physical removal if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe (still guessing and speculating) if a child was raised with &quot;If you <br/>
don&#39;t stop I&#39;ll spank you&quot; and then the spanking stops, they might celebrate by <br/>
doing what they used to avoid to avoid spankings.<br/>
<br/>
If so, though, that proves the point that spanking is a bad way to help <br/>
children learn how to act and why.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s defending your child&#39;s right to have peace and safety in the bathtub.<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;STOP IT,&quot; not even &quot;see if you can work it out, because bathtubs <br/>
are slippery and dangerous and it&#39;s not a place to be rough.<br/>
<br/>
But can they take separate baths?<br/>
<br/>
If they want to take a bath together and they&#39;re not getting along, could you <br/>
do scissors/paper/stone to see who finishes first, and who has to get in <br/>
later?<br/>
<br/>

somebody they don&#39;t need to listen to?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Worse.  The one being picked on will see you as someone who won&#39;t defend her <br/>
from harm.<br/>
<br/>
But between nothing and punishment are lots of creative, compromise <br/>
possibilities.  Maybe you could sit in there with them and invole yourself in some kind <br/>
of play situation, or just conversation to distract them while they finish. <br/>
<br/>
Holly likes for me to make a fire while she&#39;s in the bathtub in winter.  So I <br/>
make er &quot;a nest,&quot; a couple of towels laid out in front of the fire for her to <br/>
sit on, and the remote control nearby.  <br/>
<br/>
Another bathtub idea is to have music or a story.  We put a boombox on the <br/>
counter in the bathroom sometimes.   Marty always takes showers now, but when he <br/>
was a play-in-the-bath guy he had some favorite tapes or CDs to listen to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867161035">Well, in my home (6, 5 and 3.5) where they all take tubs and play together all day long, I deal with this issue often. I pretty much handle it the way you&#39;ve described below, though I try to figure out what &quot;bother&quot; means. If it means my little one is poking, pulling, hitting, taking things away, then he gets removed if he can&#39;t be redirected. There is nothing about unschooling that says one person should be allowed to do whatever they want to do, which is, I think, what Sandra was getting at. As a parent, I have an obligation to protect my children, even from each other if need be. Sam&#39;s right to extend his fist stops at someone else&#39;s body--in this country and in my unschooling home. But it also does not mean that I hit him, send him to his room alone, call him bad names, or any number of other punitive things. Removing from the situation is not punitive, in my mind, if it is done in a firm, but loving way.<br/>
<br/>
But, if &quot;bothering&quot; means that he wants to play too just not by the other&#39;s rules, then that&#39;s not really bothering in a sense that needs to be stopped, know what I mean? It&#39;s an impasse where they need to figure out a solution that can meet everyone&#39;s needs. If it&#39;s an imaginative game, then the rules need to get renegotiated to include everyone in the game, not just the people who were there first. This isn&#39;t a blanket statement, by any means; I can easily imagine scenarios in which the person&#39;s rules should be honored. But, this would end up coming out in a renegotiation, I would hope.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, the other day my kids were playing with their Imaginext pirate ship and Julia had her Disney princesses up in the crow&#39;s nest. Sam came over to play and began knocking them out with his pirate, which upset Julia. The ship belongs to all of them, so in my view, it&#39;s not fair if the girls are always making the rules for the games and the only way Sam can play is to play by their rules. He&#39;s not really &quot;bothering&quot; them if he is trying to play in a legitimate but different way. They need to find a way to play that accommodates all of them. Of course, one gets into the quagmire of having to decide what constitutes &quot;legitimate,&quot; which is why negotiation and rational exchange is so important.<br/>
<br/>
This is the way it works in my house anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  But also an appropriate one.  You are also the mother of the child<br/>
being bothered.  I think this is where the &quot;no harm&quot; principle comes in.  My<br/>
kids do what they want as long as they are not causing harm.  Pestering<br/>
someone who has asked them to stop is causing harm.<br/>
<br/>
I think a very gentle way to handle it might be something like:  &quot;I think<br/>
you will need to take a bath later.  Let&#39;s get your clothes on and I will<br/>
read you guys a story while your sibling finishes her bath.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t harsh....It solves the problem....It doesn&#39;t leave child number 1<br/>
feeling awful....It doesn&#39;t leave mom feeling like a shrew.<br/>

Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What would you do?<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &quot;This is a trap we fell into when we first released the controls after<br/>
&gt; unschooling for a couple of years.  I had been told over and over that<br/>
kids<br/>
&gt; would learn to self-regulate on things if I would just be patient.  I<br/>
&gt; thought that meant that I should completely back off and the kids would<br/>
stop<br/>
&gt; doing &quot;insane&quot; things.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is where I am with my 3 and 4 year old.  I am unsure of how to let my<br/>
&gt; children make choices, without them going &quot;insane.&quot;  Don&#39;t get me wrong,<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; is not that I never let my children make choices, it is just that I know I<br/>
&gt; also am too controlling in certain areas.  I also do timeouts with my<br/>
&gt; children, and do not want to do that anymore as I do not think it helps.<br/>
My<br/>
&gt; main worry is that my children will just not listen to me anymore if I do<br/>
&gt; not impose my own consequences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example, let&#39;s say that my children are having a bath and one is<br/>
&gt; purposely bothering the other one.  Before, I would ask my child what was<br/>
&gt; wrong, why they were doing that, etc.  I would encourage the one being<br/>

&gt; out together.  If the behaviour did not stop, I would tell the one doing<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; bothering that they would need to stop or I would take them out of the<br/>
bath.<br/>
&gt;   So this is a parent-delivered consequence, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now if I did not take the child out of the bath, what would I do?  It<br/>
isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; fair to the child who is trying to play and is continually being bothered.<br/>
&gt; And if I don&#39;t do anything about it, will my children see me as being<br/>
&gt; somebody they don&#39;t need to listen to?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you - I am trying to figure out the right balance for situations<br/>
such<br/>
&gt; as these.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; If kids (not the person whose post is quoted up above, but general<br/>
&gt; &gt;kids<br/>
&gt; &gt;in<br/>

productive<br/>
&gt; &gt;at all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I wouldn&#39;t claim &quot;unschooling&quot; if kids are purposely pouring sodas<br/>
&gt; &gt;out<br/>
&gt; &gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the van or anything LIKE that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;I think you have a valid point.  This is a trap we fell into when we<br/>

back<br/>
&gt; &gt;off and the kids would stop doing &quot;insane&quot; things.  Example:  The kids<br/>
&gt; &gt;wouldn&#39;t quit jumping on my bed, even though I asked them not to and<br/>
&gt; &gt;explained why (old mattress, old bed, no money for that right now, etc.).<br/>
&gt; &gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;felt that if I kicked them out of my room, they weren&#39;t<br/>
&quot;self-regulating&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was regulating them by punishing them by kicking them out of my room<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; &gt;they jumped on the bed..  And I had been told over and over that<br/>
punishment<br/>
&gt; &gt;was counter-productive.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It took a while for me to find the difference between punishment and<br/>
&gt; &gt;consequences due to lack of personal responsibility.  I finally came to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;principle of &quot;not doing harm&quot; and that has helped me understand where the<br/>
&gt; &gt;line is.  But it is, I think, a progession, a maturing into unschooling.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I finally had to say I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do it myself and would you<br/>
&gt; &gt;mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing this or that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think anyone ever recommended telling kids &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; &gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all myself,&quot; so sometimes when I hear the problems being caused I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;curious as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to how it was presented.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But just as with school, if kids were &quot;made to work&quot; and it was<br/>
&gt; &gt;considered<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something to be avoided, their first instinct will be to avoid it, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;maybe the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more pressure and work there was when it was required, the longer and<br/>
&gt; &gt;more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; intensely they&#39;ll want to avoid it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But not cleaning all the time isn&#39;t the opposite of making a horrible<br/>
&gt; &gt;mess<br/>
&gt; &gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of all the issues we&#39;ve ever discussed here, I think the housework and<br/>
&gt; &gt;chores<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the most marginal of all to unschooling, and I&#39;m a little nervous<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; effect.  Maybe something Joyce alluded to is true, that there are more<br/>
&gt; &gt;advanced<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; levels of unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If a family shows up here who&#39;s still doing school at home and wants<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unschool, maybe the talk about food and chores and bedtimes is just<br/>
&gt; &gt;going<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelm and confuse them.  Because there CAN be unschooling in a<br/>
&gt; &gt;family<br/>
&gt; &gt;where kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; also have chores and bedtimes and have to clean their plates.   I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; personally think it will have the depth or benefit, ultimately, as a<br/>
&gt; &gt;house<br/>
&gt; &gt;where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the children&#39;s preferences and freedoms have high priority, but it<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; &gt;still<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; absolutely be, in homeschooling terms, unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If a family quits all their routines and the kids go crazy eating<br/>
candy<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; watching TV because they never got to before, but the parents still<br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;get&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling and so are still pressing &quot;schoolwork,&quot; what a mess THAT<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt;going<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be.   It&#39;s not just carts before horses, it might be climbing into<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cart and hopping up and down before they&#39;re even sure what a horse is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope that&#39;s not happening.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t guess this is a problem particular to unschooling, though.<br/>
Some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people dress like skaters without getting wheels of any sort.  I&#39;m<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt;concerned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the effect on confused families, and the reputation of<br/>
unschooling,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the clarity and peace of the list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594120350">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So you would see &quot;stop jumping on the bed&quot; as a consequence maybe?  (You<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; didn&#39;t give an example, so I&#39;m guessing.)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*******************************************<br/>
Actually, the way it would work is:<br/>
<br/>
I am doing something in my room and a couple of the kids wander in.  One<br/>
starts jumping on the bed which they have been told many times not to do and<br/>
why.  I would say &quot;Remember, don&#39;t jump on the bed.  It is old.&quot;  The kids<br/>
hop off but within about 2 minutes it starts again.  I say &quot;Stop jumping on<br/>
the bed&quot; and it stops but soon starts again.  I say &quot;You need to leave now.<br/>
I&#39;ve asked you several times to stop jumping on my bed and you keep doing<br/>
it.  I&#39;ll be out in a minute.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To me, I had inflicted a punishment.  It certainly wasn&#39;t a natural<br/>
consequence,,,,was a logical one, but still it came from me.  So I thought I<br/>
was somehow missing the unschooling/respecting your child/let them learn to<br/>
self-regulate boat.<br/>
<br/>
It took a while for me to get the &quot;you are free to live your life as you see<br/>
fit as long as you are not causing harm to others&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I see that the kids were causing harm (not respecting my property as I<br/>
had respectfully asked them to) and so I had the right to infringe on their<br/>
freedom to the point that it was no longer infringing on mine.<br/>

&gt; -=-I was regulating them by punishing them by kicking them out of my room<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; they jumped on the bed..  And I had been told over and over that<br/>
punishment<br/>
&gt; was counter-productive.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I see punishment as spanking, grounding, withholding privileges or<br/>
allowance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone jumps on the bed and you want them to stop, saying &quot;Stop<br/>
jumping<br/>
&gt; on the bed&quot; isn&#39;t punishment.   It&#39;s you defending your property and the<br/>
peace<br/>
&gt; of your room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-It took a while for me to find the difference between punishment and<br/>
&gt; consequences due to lack of personal responsibility. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I just see it as an expression of preference which could get stronger, ro<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; physical removal if necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe (still guessing and speculating) if a child was raised with &quot;If you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t stop I&#39;ll spank you&quot; and then the spanking stops, they might<br/>
celebrate by<br/>
&gt; doing what they used to avoid to avoid spankings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If so, though, that proves the point that spanking is a bad way to help<br/>
&gt; children learn how to act and why.<br/>
