hi,
<p>i just ran across this book called&nbsp; <u>body rolling: an experiential
approach to complete muscle release</u> by yamuna zake and stephanie golden
( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.bodylogic.com/">http://www.bodylogic.com/</a> ).&nbsp;&nbsp; i&#39;ve read part of it and i&#39;m
going to order the balls and try it out.&nbsp; the book is written for
bodyworkers but, with the aid of a book on anatomy (if you don&#39;t possess
this knowledge already:), i find it very accessible.&nbsp;&nbsp; one thing
is this book is not &#39;dumbed down&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp; anyway i just thought you
might want to find an alternative approach to releasing muscle tension.&nbsp;&nbsp;
i for one cannot afford a chiropractor on a regular basis (though my experience
has always been positive) and the philosophy of this books is for people
to learn a technique which they can: one, have immediate results; and two,
become self-healing and not become dependent on a practitioner.
