<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243616644"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Homeschool mystery solved!!!<br/>

&gt; The only family I know that does school-at-home with ease is the one that<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; featured in the following vignette:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5yo says &quot;yuck&quot; to squash for dinner.  Father makes 5yo eat the entire<br/>
&gt; family&#39;s servings of squash.  Mother proudly states that none of the kids<br/>
&gt; have said &quot;yuck&quot; in the 18 years since.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While this story is interesting, the question I still have is &quot;How?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Did he beat the child to get him to eat a tub of squash?<br/>
<br/>
If a parent whips out a spelling workbook and the child balks, what happens?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Come one, it&#39;ll be fun.&quot;<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do it or lose your allowance/toy/whatever.&quot;<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
The beatings begin?<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t get it.<br/>

Nance:<br/>
It reminds me of the MANY parents who claim that their children &#39;learned&#39; to<br/>
stop biting people because they (parents) bit the child back!   (I hear it<br/>
lots.....since so far 3 of 4 have been biters)<br/>
    &quot;well,  when Courtney bit me,  I bit her back,,,,,,,that tught<br/>
her.....she never bit again&quot;<br/>
People swear this......I cannot believe it to be true.....some wierd<br/>
justification that they are &quot;good&quot; parents is all I can figure.<br/>
