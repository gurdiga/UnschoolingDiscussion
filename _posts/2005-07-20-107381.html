<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607121351">Dear Group - I posted this on two other groups, so I apologize if <br/>
you&#39;re reading this again.  I am new to the unschooling e-mail <br/>
groups and am needing some feedback.  I signed up a while ago, but <br/>
am just now starting to read a little bit.  I am not new to <br/>
unschooling, but at times find that I still struggle with my need to <br/>
control things.  I&#39;m growing all the time in this life philosophy <br/>
and so appreciate all the help that is out there!  Sandra - thanks <br/>
so much for your website - it is incredibly helpful!!!  My dd is <br/>
VERY sensitive (Elaine Aron) and VERY spirited and introverted (Mary <br/>
Kurcinka) and we love and honor that about her.  However, when it <br/>
comes to things like cavities and dentists, my creative abilities <br/>
are stretched!!!  Thanks in advance for your help! :)<br/>
<br/>
*****original message*****Robyn - Thank you so very much for sharing <br/>
your story.  Your journey was difficult but I truly believe that you <br/>
and James both handled it with open hearts.  You listened to your <br/>
child, and honored your child, while responding to the very real <br/>
concern for her health.  <br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group.  I am not new to unschooling, although I <br/>
won&#39;t pretend to have it all worked out.  It is a journey of growth <br/>
for me - truly, for our whole family.  Your story resonates deeply <br/>
with our family as my daughter has two visible cavities right now, <br/>
and I&#39;ve been letting it go because she DOES NOT want to go to the <br/>
dentist.  So we haven&#39;t gone.<br/>
<br/>
She had visible cavities in her teeth within 6 months of when they <br/>
came in (two of her teeth virtually came in with cavities) and at <br/>
the time, we had her knocked out and had procedures done on her that <br/>
just about broke my heart.  She was around 18 mo. when we finally <br/>
had her teeth fixed.  It took me a long time to come to a place <br/>
where I knew she had to have it done.  She had two front teeth that <br/>
were so decayed that the dentist had to re-build them with some sort <br/>
of filling material.  These were two of her front teeth.  She also <br/>
had 4 other cavities that were filled at that time.  It was VERY <br/>
difficult as we didn&#39;t have a dentist that I trusted at that time.  <br/>
I did a ton of research, and against a lot of pressure to wean her, <br/>
we went an alternative route with homeopathy, natural products, <br/>
etc.  That worked very well for a time.  It has only been recently, <br/>
when she has chosen to not brush her teeth regularly, that I&#39;ve seen <br/>
any new problems with her teeth.  I do not want to ever force her to <br/>
brush, but I do explain to her regularly why it is important.  We <br/>
are very creative, and her dolls brush, our imaginary friends brush, <br/>
etc., and many of these techniques work some of the time - but of <br/>
course, since she has a choice, there are many times that she just <br/>
doesn&#39;t brush.  <br/>
<br/>
We have taken her back to the dentist 3 times, just for check-ups <br/>
(the same one, which I&#39;m realizing was probably not a good plan) and <br/>
Emmy has been great about going, and she&#39;ll get in the chair, but <br/>
WILL NOT let anyone near her mouth.  I, too, have probably spent too <br/>
long trying to talk her into just letting someone look at her teeth, <br/>
(10 minutes or so) rather than just grabbing her up and taking her <br/>
home.  The last time, I left with the understanding that the dentist <br/>
truly thought I was stupid for letting my child &quot;rule&quot; me and she <br/>
really thought I should force Emmy to submit, rather than give her a <br/>
choice.  I left realizing that we needed a new dentist, and my new <br/>
plan has been to pick 3 or 4 and have Emmy &quot;interview&quot; them.  I do, <br/>
however, keep procrastinating making the appointments because she <br/>
just doesn&#39;t want to go.  We read books about it (there is a great <br/>
one from the Dora character that is very descriptive about going to <br/>
the dentist), we play dentist, and she has been to my appointments <br/>
numerous times.  <br/>
<br/>
As a little background, Emmy is VERY sensitive and VERY spirited, <br/>
and we love that about her.  At 4 1/2 she still doesn&#39;t like groups, <br/>
and doesn&#39;t like other children around her unless she has been <br/>
around them many, many times and knows who they are.  Even then, she <br/>
only enjoys one-on-one with other kids - not kids in a group, even <br/>
if she knows them.  It takes her quite a while to feel safe enough <br/>
in any new situation for her to reach out a little bit, let alone <br/>
have someone she doesn&#39;t know look at her teeth!  But as these <br/>
cavities get bigger, I get more and more worried.  Especially as I <br/>
do know that cavities in the teeth mean that there is a level of <br/>
bacteria in her body that her little system constantly has to <br/>
fight.  There is just no way at 4 1/2 that she can understand some <br/>
of the ramifications of all that.  And I really don&#39;t want to let it <br/>
go to the point that she has an emergency situation, like you have <br/>
had with Jayn.  My heart just goes out to your family, and I honor <br/>
so much how all of you have handled this difficult situation.  We <br/>
don&#39;t force her to do anything, and I won&#39;t start now, but at the <br/>
same time, I&#39;m stumped as to how to get her to understand how <br/>
important this is.  One of her cavities now is like a big crack in <br/>
her tooth, and is completely black. <br/>
<br/>
I would truly love any suggestions that anyone has on how to get my <br/>
darling girl to understand how important it is that she get these <br/>
cavities fixed before they become much more serious.  I haven&#39;t yet <br/>
tried letting her interview different dentists, but your story has <br/>
helped me see that I need to trust that the Universe is bringing me <br/>
a little nudge and I need to get it done.  Thank you, and I welcome <br/>
any and all suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Warmest Regards,<br/>
Beth & Emmy :)</div>
