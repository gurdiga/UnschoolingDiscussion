<br/>
We&#39;re down in Kenmore - on Lake Washington&#39;s northern shores... It seems<br/>
I&#39;ve seen your name somewhere else... on the WHEN list?<br/>

&gt; If you don&#39;t mind my asking, what part of WA are you in?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m in Vancouver.  Moved recently from Olympia.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just curious,<br/>

Hope you&#39;re enjoying WA state.  We were very happy when we were finally able<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-104332999">Yes we are... enjoying WA state, I mean. For some reason, I&#39;ve wanted to<br/>
live up here in the Pacific NW since I was in my twenties. I&#39;m not sure<br/>
exactly when or why the urge began. My husband grew up in Seattle, and moved<br/>
to CA in his twenties, and didn&#39;t want to leave the sunshine and return to<br/>
the rain. But one thing led to another and here we are, and both of us are<br/>
very glad we&#39;re here.<br/>
<br/>
... does kind of crack us up (&#39;scuse the pun) that we had to leave &#39;quake<br/>
country&#39; (where I&#39;ve only been in one big one (and not that many little<br/>
ones!)) in order to experience a shaker like the one we just had!<br/>
<br/>
Return &#39;home&#39;... did you grow up here, leave and return also?<br/>

Oh, that is a riot!  Now we know who to blame...you must have brought it<br/>
with you!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Return &#39;home&#39;... did you grow up here, leave and return also?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Essentially, yes...I was raised in the NW (Montana, Utah, Idaho and WA).  DH<br/>
was raised here in Olympia, born in Bremerton.  We met and married in<br/>
Olympia, then the military and other career adventures took us all over the<br/>
world (Texas, Nebraska, Japan, Colorado, Oregon, Utah, WA and DH spent 2<br/>
years in Qatar which is a small country in the Middle East (we remained<br/>
stateside and sent him on his own!)).  20+ years later we were finally in a<br/>
position to choose where we wanted to live and chose western WA.  His new<br/>
job brought us to Vancouver, but it&#39;s close enough to family that we&#39;re<br/>
satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was raised in and around Olympia.  My great grandparents were some<br/>
of the early Olympia settlers.<br/>
<br/>
DH&#39;s parents were both born and raised in Bremerton.  His remaining<br/>
grandmother still lives there.<br/>
