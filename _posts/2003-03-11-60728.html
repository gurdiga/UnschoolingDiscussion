<div id="ygrps-yiv-78415878">This is something that is happening to my family that I have never <br/>
seen discussed on these boards.<br/>
Our neighbors have lived across the street from us for 9 years. Our <br/>
kids have grown up together and we have taken vacations together etc. <br/>
Suddenly, since our son turned 13, they have decided that he is a <br/>
teenager, so their kids are no longer able to spend the night at our <br/>
house as there is no telling what our son might do to them. The <br/>
father in this family has memories of doing some things at this age <br/>
like trying to sneak and see his sister naked, pressuring his sisters <br/>
friends to &quot;do stuff&quot;, etc. and thinks our son will do things like <br/>
that too. My husband says it never occurred to him to do anything <br/>
like that when he was 13, or ever for that matter, and I have 2 <br/>
brothers that say they never did anything like that either. My son is <br/>
a very kind, quiet, decent guy, and we are deeply offended that <br/>
anyone would think him capable of such a thing. He feels condemned by <br/>
these people, and we have to see them everyday, right in front of us. <br/>
It is making me feel so ill that they look at my child with such <br/>
contempt, just because he became a teenager. This may have something <br/>
to do with the fact that they have gone extreme &#39;Christian Right&#39; in <br/>
the last few years, and now think that they are above others in the <br/>
neighborhood. It doesn&#39;t concern me what their beliefs are, and we <br/>
have looked on with great amusement at their hipocracy, and the <br/>
things they justify in the name of G_ _. I just never thought that it <br/>
would come to haunt my family. The problem is, as much as I would <br/>
like to write them off, our children still want to be friends. Their <br/>
children want to be at our house all the time. I fear them. Who knows <br/>
what ridiculous assertion they will apply to my family next? I can&#39;t <br/>
even look at them (the parents)without becoming angry. I am losing <br/>
sleep over this. Any suggestions on how to not let these people <br/>
poison our life?  Cindi</div>

Hey, it&#39;s your house.  They don&#39;t have to let their kids spend the night, but <br/>
they can&#39;t change your rules while the kids ARE there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
Let it go.  Lots of people fear adolescent boys.  Often it&#39;s personal trauma <br/>
(like your neighbor&#39;s guilt).  I worked with another English teacher named <br/>
Miss Pfiester.  &quot;Feester.&quot;  I kid you not.  Her name was Esther Pfiester.  <br/>
She had been a teacher when I was a kid too.<br/>
<br/>
We were teaching 9th grade English, both of us.  If a boy hit puberty and got <br/>
tall and hairy, she wanted him OUT of her room.  I kinda liked them at that <br/>
gawky age, personally, and had no fear.  I used to trade her.  If someone <br/>
really didn&#39;t like my class and would rather go to hers where they just did <br/>
what the book said, copy this exercise with the proper verb form, circle the <br/>
nouns, stuff like that, they&#39;d go.  I&#39;d trade her a girl or a still-childlike <br/>
boy for her bigger hairier boys.  And often the boy was happy to be in my <br/>
more busy, less predictable classroom because part of his problem was needing <br/>
to move and twitch and look out the window.  No problem for me.<br/>
<br/>
Boys ideally DO get bigger and they become men.  Some people will fear that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any suggestions on how to not let these people <br/>
poison our life? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Philosophy.<br/>
Use them as an example of how not to be.  Smile, look at the sky, breathe, <br/>
and be glad your kids are cool and that the neighbor kids like them and your <br/>
house.<br/>

   We have &quot;people&quot; like this in our neighborhood also.  Thanks to <br/>
the heavily wooded area we live in, we do not have to look at them, <br/>
only hear them once in awhile. We have had run-ins with them over <br/>
their dogs coming over and trying to get in to bother our animals. <br/>
Our property is all fenced and cross-fenced so our animals are all <br/>
contained and safe. Even our four dogs stay in behind fences and <br/>
gates but do get to run around our property only.  Their dogs run <br/>
loose and if you even dare to say anything to them about it (we have) <br/>
they go nuts and act and use very &quot;un-Christian&quot; language, even in <br/>
front of their kids . . . what an example to them. HA! &quot;Haughty <br/>
Toads&quot; (a Balinese book) they certainly are.<br/>

making messes where ever he went and the family was rude about it. After a <br/>
couple of months, the rest of the neighbors started to work some &#39;natural <br/>
consequences&#39; on the rude neighbor!<br/>
<br/>
Some of the not-rude neighbors started catching the dog and repeatedly <br/>
brought him to the pound (sometimes twice in 24 hours!), putting the dog in <br/>
the &#39;dog drop kennels&#39; which are available at night.  It was never <br/>
discussed it on the street except to say,&quot;I hear Shadow was in the pound <br/>
again last night&quot; and never left names at the pound, so the rude neighbor <br/>
couldn&#39;t retaliate.  The inconsiderate neighbor had to cough up more than a <br/>
hundred bucks each time to get their dog back.  After a while, they started <br/>
keeping their dog closer to home.  Too expensive in the long run to be an <br/>
inconsiderate neighbor.  ...and I think the Humane Society enjoyed the <br/>
increased revenues while they lasted.  Everyone won.<br/>
<br/>
Nevermind it&#39;s not safe for the dog to go running around loose.  They could <br/>
get hit by a car!<br/>

  Thats what we do.  We&#39;ve already had it happen more than once here, and I won&#39;t let it happen again.  There is no telling what story they might concoct in order to drag him through the mud.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve had experience with this from another neighbor who accused my son of hitting theirs with a baseball bat, when in fact he was riding a bike without a helmet in our driveway and wrecked.  They successfully got money out of our home owners insurance after they ran him to the hospital in an ambulance and filed a police report (3 hours AFTER the incident).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719074107">That brings back nightmares to me. My brother went to deliver a birthday<br/>
invitation one day to some neighbors of ours when we were kids. We lived<br/>
in the country and he rode his bike over there. He was probably 5 years<br/>
old or so. The family dog followed him. While there their dog and our<br/>
dog started fighting. The father of this family got out a gun and shot<br/>
our dog. Boy, did this start big neighbor issues. The guy could have<br/>
shot a kid as easily as he hit the dog. Scary.<br/>
