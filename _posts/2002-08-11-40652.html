&gt; knows from a book or from what others have told him<br/>
&gt; but not from his own experience.  Someone who is not a<br/>

First, are you quoting someone else or yourself?<br/>
<br/>
Next, Have you heard of John Holt? I met John, heard him speak, read all his<br/>
books and have a lot in common with him (similar school/same college,<br/>
similar interests. I can say with deep conviction that he transformed my<br/>
life with his writings about education and children in general, even though<br/>
he never married and had no kids.<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s a guy they call Pope John who seems to know a little about<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate many of your posts, but I don&#39;t get this one.<br/>
