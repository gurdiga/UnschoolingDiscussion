&gt; &lt;&lt; My kids like candy like the next kid, but they don&#39;t crave it, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; nag for it and eat it as a treat. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids like candy less than &quot;the next kid,&quot; it seems.<br/>
&gt; Other kids come here, see it, and get excited because it&#39;s limited at their<br/>
&gt; house, but our kids mostly leave it sitting around because they don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s as good as other things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine eat more &quot;junk&quot; (candy, chips, etc.) than I&#39;m sure<br/>
healthy-eating-advocate parents would find comfortable. But they don&#39;t<br/>
regard it as a treat or leap on it when I bring it home, it&#39;s just part of<br/>
the landscape.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters know they can have ice cream for breakfast if they want it.<br/>
Mikey (5) invariably chooses a bagel or toast. Brit (8), her mother&#39;s<br/>
daughter, doesn&#39;t eat until she&#39;s been up and around for several hours.<br/>
<br/>
Brit considers green salads a treat and when we&#39;re out of lettuce that&#39;s the<br/>
first thing she wants me to put on the shopping list. And she&#39;s currently<br/>
going through a binge of sandwiches four times per day.<br/>
<br/>
Both have free access to soda, neither tend to choose it. Mikey likes water,<br/>
both like milk.<br/>
<br/>
I have asked them, and they are agreeable, to eat a multi-vitamin every day.<br/>
They&#39;re healthy, happy, fewer tooth problems than I had at their age.<br/>
There&#39;s still a lot of Christmas candy left in the bowl.<br/>
