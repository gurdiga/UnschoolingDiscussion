&gt; Prayer is not begging. Prayer is doing what&#39;s good and right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If God is &quot;omniscient&quot; as we are told, then do we really need to tell God<br/>
&gt; our needs, or ask for favors?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Ned, <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you don&#39;t.  Maybe prayer for you is living; as you suggest above, it&#39;s<br/>
doing what&#39;s good and right.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with<br/>
doing what&#39;s good and right, mind you!  But yes, I need to pray.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t think that prayer is about begging God for favors, nor do I<br/>
think that it&#39;s telling God what God already knows.  Prayer is about ME.  If<br/>
I never stop to think, to be quiet, to sit and &quot;be&quot; in the presence of God,<br/>
which to me is praying, I am not right with myself or God.  As my husband<br/>
says, I become a human doing instead of a human being.<br/>
<br/>
If that sounds a lot like meditation, you&#39;re right.  But there&#39;s another<br/>
element of it for me, and that&#39;s talking to God.  Yea, I believe that God<br/>
does already know.  (But sometimes my husband does, too, and I talk to him!)<br/>
If I believe that God is great and a wonderful power in my life, then surely<br/>
in my prayers it makes sense to stop and say thank you.  (If I believe that<br/>
your posts are useful, I say thank you to you, too, right?  Why not God?!)<br/>
Why ask God for something?  Because it surely doesn&#39;t hurt to ask.  I find<br/>
peace in asking God to be with someone in need, in telling God my fears and<br/>
asking for his peace, and things like that.  Does God give me everything I<br/>
ask?  Of course not.  I don&#39;t give my son everything he asks for, either.<br/>
Somethings aren&#39;t the right thing for us, whether or not we can see that at<br/>
the time.   But prayer is important to me, and to many other folks as well.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
