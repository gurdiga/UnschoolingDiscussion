 Weird.  What good does it do for a baby to identify birds?  What good would <br/>
 it do a child in New Mexico to identify a cardinal, unless just for fun?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the program that guy started (you know the &quot;teach your baby to <br/>
read&quot; guy) called &quot;teach your baby encyclopedic knowledge&quot; or something like <br/>
that.<br/>
I looked into it many years ago (silly me) and couldn&#39;t believe the <br/>
flashcards and memorization stuff they were pushing on little babies!! It was <br/>
ridiculous.<br/>
All so the kid could recognize different birds, names of things and <br/>
definitions.<br/>
It&#39;s all about the parents, not the child.<br/>
They feel oh-so-good when little Johnny can show off his incredible knowledge.<br/>
Only problem is, if you can look it up in an encyclopedia, why does the kid <br/>
need to memorize it at all? How silly.<br/>
Sick people.<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

the four math facts by looking at random dot pictures.  Looks like a head <br/>

started those pictures you have to stare past to actually see the form <br/>
through all the muck.  Ah well, I&#39;m rambling again...<br/>
