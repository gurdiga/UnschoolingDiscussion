 </span></blockquote>Our internet service provider filters all our email for viruses <br/>
BEFORE sending it to our inbox.  They always notify us if <br/>
something had a virus in it so we could notify the person.  I have <br/>
not received notification that anything you have send had a virus, <br/>
so I think you are OK.<br/>
