<br/>
I know. . . .   I know from the depths of my  being.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Those statements bothered me.  The substance of them didn&#39;t bother  me, but <br/>
the form did--not grammatically or logically, but philosophically and  in terms <br/>
of physiology.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then we come up against language.<br/>
 <br/>
Had you said &quot;I believe that...&quot; it would&#39;ve been  softened.<br/>
And had I not grown up in an atmosphere in which people knew things  because <br/>
in the depths of their beings they knew it was true, my little  &quot;alert&quot; lights <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go off.<br/>
 <br/>
And that comes to the two questions:<br/>
 <br/>
-=-1) How come knowing these things I sometimes find it so hard to  implement <br/>
them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything you listed has to do with theory and practice of attachment  <br/>
parenting and unschooling.  That&#39;s cool with me!  As stated, they  are ideals <br/>
almost in the realm of virtues (and when we live by principle  instead of rules, <br/>
that IS in the realm of philosophy/belief, and so the best  we can do is <br/>
approach our ideas as nearly as we can).<br/>
 <br/>
You were really stating principles that make logical sense to you,  things <br/>
you intellectually believe to be viable and true, and probably things  you&#39;ve <br/>
seen work with your own children and others.   That&#39;s  legitimate, and that&#39;s <br/>
how beliefs become convictions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-2) As I know these are right am I being conceited or as I  believe just <br/>
more aware than those who do not.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re more aware of the topics you&#39;re discussing, I think.  You&#39;re  <br/>
focussing your thought and energy and BEing on being that kind of  parent.  It&#39;s the <br/>
looming in the forefront of your awareness.   That&#39;s not a bad thing.  But in <br/>
many people&#39;s lives something else is  looming at the forefront.  (And then in <br/>
some people&#39;s lives, nothing much  looms, they play on a flatter field, <br/>
emotionally.  Fervor isn&#39;t one of  their emotions.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Besides thinking about attachment parenting, and before that and during,  <br/>
I&#39;ve also spent a lot of time talking/thinking/writing/debating (kinda same  <br/>
stuff we do on the discussion list and other such places) about virtue and  <br/>
belief, so this all jumped out at me.   In that area, I&#39;ve come to  believe that <br/>
there are three levels of &quot;belief&quot;:  an idea, a theory and a  conviction.<br/>
 <br/>
An idea doesn&#39;t have to be original, but can be something we&#39;ve borrowed to  <br/>
try out, to think about, to hold as possibly worth believing.   Then  if it <br/>
works we believe it, but we need to really wear it around, ride it, sleep  on <br/>
it, try it out in different environments, test it.  If it stands up to  all <br/>
other beliefs it meets and still seems true and best, and if we have  experienced <br/>
good results and find no reason to abandon the belief for something  we think <br/>
is better, then it becomes a conviction.  We are convinced.<br/>
 <br/>
Those are all words to try to describe levels of confidence that I think  are <br/>
combinations of logic and biochemistry.  Is something a calm belief or  an <br/>
agitated, nervous belief?  Does it flow deep and still like a conviction  or <br/>
does it hop around like little idea?  Does it ask little questions  inside us all <br/>
the time like a belief?<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a place inside the brain (recent research has shown) where fervor  <br/>
and religious experience live, are formed, react, &quot;spark.&quot;  As with other  <br/>
biochemical things, science is just newly discovering and unravelling what&#39;s up,  <br/>
but when there is a deep personal experience/feeling/thought involving a  <br/>
person&#39;s relationship to the rest of the universe, that&#39;s the part of the brain  <br/>
that&#39;s stimulated (so people are attempting to clarify and prove and examine  <br/>
more closely).<br/>
 <br/>
When someone is emotionally and in other ways invested in something as big  <br/>
as life to them, they get that feeling of just knowing deep in their  being.<br/>
 <br/>
That leads to love and religion.   That wasn&#39;t your question, but  that might <br/>
be part of your answer.<br/>
