I make soap using vegetable shortening and lye.  It&#39;s the easiest recipe<br/>
I&#39;ve found and I&#39;ve never had a problem with saponification or<br/>
seperation.  I don&#39;t use essential oils or fragrance mainly because I<br/>
can&#39;t find them anywhere.  They&#39;re too expensive for me to order<br/>
online.  They might have instructions on the oils for usuage.  The<br/>
following is the best web site I&#39;ve come across when it comes to soap<br/>
making.  Very helpful.<br/>

&gt; So, we&#39;re kinda settled in.  I&#39;m just reading messages on the website<br/>
&gt; - I don&#39;t have time to get everything yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NEwayz, my son and I are going to try to make soap.  But, I do not<br/>
&gt; have access to any books on soap making (I can&#39;t read Japanese very<br/>
&gt; well - and they don&#39;t have any soap making books in English at the<br/>
&gt; library), and we can&#39;t order anything on the web without paying $50+-<br/>
&gt; for shipping - which takes about a month anywayz.  SO, I know the<br/>
&gt; basics - like add lye to heated vegetable oil (I think I&#39;ll use<br/>
&gt; grapeseed) and when it starts to thicken, add fragrance (I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; use a few essential oils), but I don&#39;t know how much to add, and hear<br/>
&gt; that could be dangerous.  So, if anyone knows the details - have<br/>
&gt; experience with adding essential oils, etc. please e-mail me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
