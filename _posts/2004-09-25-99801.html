<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182887368">One thing I notice in homeschooling circles is the tendency to evaluate kids based on the <br/>
&quot;extraordinary.&quot; We want proof or something that we are exceeding expectations rather <br/>
than just living.<br/>
<br/>
I also notice a tendency of adults to want kids to do exceptional work, hobbies and <br/>
personal activities as a way of validating that we have &quot;great kids.&quot; I&#39;m wondering, though, <br/>
if the real truth is that most people don&#39;t achieve notable stuff. They are mostly working to <br/>
have a life that is financially independent (they can support themselves and not rely on <br/>
parents otr the government) and they have hobbies or activities they enjoy on the side.<br/>
<br/>
Why are we so bent on achieving &quot;greatness&quot; and most of us just aren&#39;t going to?<br/>
<br/>
Why do we &quot;hound&quot; our kids to do more than they do?<br/>
<br/>
I see this in school kids often. Parents aren&#39;t content that the kids are going to school and <br/>
in after school sports. How do they spend their free time? Are they doing anything else <br/>
important? Or personal?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty tired of it. I feel like we e3xpect so much of kids and rarely appreciate them just <br/>
as they are.<br/>

do, when they are following their own passions, AS greatness for them. <br/>
But I don&#39;t see us pushing them to be notable achievers.<br/>
<br/>
But it just happens that kids given time and support to follow their <br/>
passions do often seem to BE notable achievers in the sense that they <br/>
have the time to DO things when they are young, while most other kids <br/>
are busy with the inanities that school imposes on them.<br/>

<br/>
This is a really interesting idea to explore.<br/>
<br/>
Years past I&#39;ve seen sportscasters interviewing cross-country ski racers <br/>
from the U.S. and their approach is &quot;Aren&#39;t you disappointed to come in <br/>
17th?&quot; when the skier, who might be the first person from the U.S. ever <br/>
to compete in this event says &quot;No, I&#39;m just so thrilled to be at the <br/>
Olympics, but then the interviewere acts disbelieving.<br/>
<br/>
Our culture is set up strangely where only the one person who gets the <br/>
gold medal is entitled to be briefly happy and everyone else is expected <br/>
to be disappointed.  Yuck.  Those are terrible odds.<br/>
<br/>
** Why are we so bent on achieving &quot;greatness&quot; and most of us just <br/>
aren&#39;t going to?**<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the best way to have &quot;wonderful&quot; kids is to expand our own sense <br/>
of &quot;wonder&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Probably we need to erase our Win-Lose mental patterns and replace them <br/>
with alternative visions that don&#39;t require one person to &quot;lose&quot; in <br/>
order for another to feel a sense of accomplishment.  Focusing on the <br/>
ideas of self-improvement and doing one&#39;s personal best are a part of <br/>
this change.  But there are probably more profound possible changes that <br/>
I can&#39;t see.<br/>
<br/>
The biological drives that tell us that we would die for our children <br/>
are possibly the reason that we feel in our guts that our children are <br/>
&quot;exceptional&quot;.  And maybe some people want external validation for that?<br/>
<br/>
** I see this in school kids often. Parents aren&#39;t content that the kids <br/>

<br/>
Are they driven by a desire to get their children into Harvard or other <br/>
competitive colleges, maybe?<br/>

*******************<br/>
I was at a Debate Club that a bunch of homeschooled families put together a  <br/>
few years ago. Julian loved it. It wasn&#39;t rigid or anything, and the kids had <br/>
a  blast.<br/>
 <br/>
We were at the library where it took place, and Julian was helping to set  up <br/>
the heavy tables. For some reason he&#39;d taken off his shoes. Well, the table  <br/>
fell on his foot, and he was almost crying.<br/>
 <br/>
One of the moms (an UNSCHOOLING mom, yet!!!) sighed, and mentioned that she  <br/>
didn&#39;t tend to coddle her kids, especially if they were upset by something <br/>
that  was their own fault, anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
I responded with something like, &quot;Oh, we always coddle him when he&#39;s upset  <br/>
or gets hurt. I guess that&#39;s just us!&quot; She rolled her eyes, I took care of my  <br/>
boy.<br/>
 <br/>
I still coddle him, even when he&#39;s not upset. I like to.  And he often  <br/>
coddles other people. I&#39;m definitely pro-coddling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770906077">My oldest (now 20) didn&#39;t go to college.  I have offered to help her  get in, <br/>
get the paperwork rolling, buy books she thinks she needs, search  for <br/>
scholarships, etc, but at this time she  has no interest.  I&#39;m so  glad that she <br/>
KNOWS she doesn&#39;t want to go!<br/>
 <br/>
She works at a family owned Mexican Restaurant, makes REALLY good money and  <br/>
loves everyone she works with, including her boss.   She now speaks  fluent <br/>
Spanish.   Her boss (a single mom) just bought a beautiful old  funeral home and <br/>
is fixing it up, and Mandy loves to help her out.  Most of  them spend their <br/>
time off together, and the owners close the restaurant many  times a year for <br/>
holidays, and throw parties for the employees.  She is  really, truly happy <br/>
and has no desire to move up to &quot;bigger and better&quot;  things.  I wish I was so <br/>
sure of myself at her age!<br/>

spending the night, too. First off, I don&#39;t blame Wyl for not wanting to go, since <br/>
Grandma and Grandaddy have an enormous amount of (seemingly pointless) rules. <br/>
Plus, he adores his family and loves spending time with us-how many public <br/>
school parents would give their eyeteeth for one day a month of that?! But, the <br/>
last time it came up (phone conversation), my mother told me that we shouldn&#39;t <br/>
allow him to change his mind. (One time, he agreed to spend the night about a <br/>
week before the &quot;date&quot;, and then, a few days beforehand, he decided he really <br/>
didn&#39;t want to, after all) She told me we were teaching him to &quot;manipulate&quot; <br/>
Dave and I, and teaching him to play &quot;mind games&quot;!!! Like she (or anyone else <br/>
for that matter!!)&#39;s never changed her mind about anything!! He&#39;s almost 5 1/2, <br/>
for crying out loud-he hasn&#39;t a concept of mind games-well... that may have <br/>
less to do with age than with never having been shown the example of it, but <br/>
nonetheless... I just don&#39;t know what to do with my parents (especially my <br/>
mother) sometimes... it seems the more we &quot;let go&quot; of our ridgidness, the more <br/>
controlling she becomes. She even had the gall to complain to me that I was <br/>
&quot;undermining her authority&quot; (over catsup, for crying out loud!!) one day when we were <br/>
over there... well, even if &quot;authority&quot; were important to me-its not HER <br/>
authority that Wyl should be attuned to-it would be the parent&#39;s authority... <br/>
Ugh... That&#39;s a whole other story I wont&#39; get into, now...<br/>
At any rate, you have my empathy-and I&#39;m right there with you in your <br/>
perplexity on this kind of stuff... :~)<br/>

Hmmm, yeah, &#39;undermining her authority&quot; eh?  That&#39;s so absurd a thing <br/>
to say at all, but to a grown woman with a son of her own?  You could <br/>
always pack up and leave -- or bring your own condiments next time.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
My step-dad doesn&#39;t at all get how we parent, but he usually doesn&#39;t <br/>
say anything about it to me.  However, we were over one time and there <br/>
was a package of crackers laying on the coffee table.  My DS (maybe 4 <br/>
at the time) had already asked my mom for a snack and she gave him some <br/>
of those crackers.  I don&#39;t remember who laid them on the table (but is <br/>
was not my SD).  Anyway, DS was done and wanted more crackers so he <br/>
started to take a few more out of the package and my SD said to him <br/>
&quot;Hey!  Who said?  You didn&#39;t ask.&quot;  Huh?  I said that he doesn&#39;t need <br/>
to *ask* to eat and that my mom had already given him some of those.  <br/>
SD then said to my DS, &quot;What do you say?  You can&#39;t have any more <br/>
unless you say &#39;please&#39;.&quot;  I told him no he doesn&#39;t *have* to say <br/>
please and that he was going to eat the damn crackers without begging <br/>
for them.  Ooooh, that really burned me.  Poor DS was so confused as to <br/>
why his Papa wouldn&#39;t just let him have some more crackers.  ::sigh::<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053276470">Tracy , <br/>
 <br/>
I totally relate to your story about your stepdad.  I have to deal with the same thing with my in laws as well as my mother.  Thanksgiving was a disaster last year for my oldest who was also four.  The in laws were on his case for everything.  I really like the part when they leave breakables out and then get mad at the kids for wanting to play with them.  My mother is constantly trying to correct the behavior in my kids that she thinks needs work.  It&#39;s almost like they all can&#39;t stand the way my husband and I parent and they all have the attitude that as long as the kids are under their roof, they will act the way the in laws and mother want them to.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve basically reached the conclusion that everyone is a critic when it&#39;s not their child and they don&#39;t live your life all day.  Some of my childless friends are even critics.  &quot;When we have kids, we&#39;re not going to let them to that&quot;  is their mantra.  I feel like saying, you haven&#39;t even been up all night with a newborn yet, shut up!  LOL<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Hmmm, yeah, &#39;undermining her authority&quot; eh?  That&#39;s so absurd a thing <br/>
to say at all, but to a grown woman with a son of her own?  You could <br/>
always pack up and leave -- or bring your own condiments next time.  ;) &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Pam.  Seems EHO wasn&#39;t quite what we were looking for... <br/>
Nike&#39;s been all over the NBTS communities, but if I recall <br/>
correctly, Wiki was kind of a mystery compared to the typical forum <br/>
set-up.  I&#39;ll suggest she go over and look at it again.  No UD-type <br/>
BB for the grown kids here at Yahoo! or elsewhere?  It&#39;s such an <br/>
encouragement to hear about Kirby and Mandy&#39;s pursuits sans <br/>
the &quot;higher&quot; academic scene.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nothing short of amazing to learn that my sixteen years of <br/>
studying Spanish by the book in school could&#39;ve been more profitably <br/>
and enjoyably spent working in a good Mexican restaurant!  LOL You <br/>
know, we actually suggested that idea to our older kids years ago <br/>
when we frequented a local Chinese restaurant and became friends <br/>
with the owner.  She brought over her parents from the homeland to <br/>
help her out with the business while her husband studied at the <br/>
nearby university and they were also conversing with us (as our <br/>
friend translated) at the table.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying for years to help my oldest stepson shed his public <br/>
school ideals of &quot;success&quot; and focus on what he loves best.  I <br/>
noticed the similarities between his interests, not to mention his <br/>
appearance, and Kirby&#39;s when they were younger.  Brandon wore his <br/>
dark brown hair long when he was seventeen, too.  He didn&#39;t have <br/>
near enough time to deschool highschool before feeling pressured to <br/>
join the world of community college in order to please his parent<br/>
(s).  <br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t last very long, and this kid is still struggling to <br/>
figure out how to live the conventional life five years later.  The <br/>
saddest part for me is that he&#39;s decided that the military is his <br/>
only option now.  I asked him if he knew there was a war on... now I <br/>
know how my parents felt when my big brother volunteered for Vietnam <br/>
after dropping out of highschool.  That was the beginning of a <br/>
downhill spiral for the next twenty years.  Brandon also feels like <br/>
a failure, at school, at work, at family life, and we haven&#39;t been <br/>
able to convince him otherwise.  Such a waste of good talent!  <br/>
<br/>
He sees anything that doesn&#39;t promise to make him big bucks as <br/>
nothing more than a hobby, and the army is making him all kinds of <br/>
promises I don&#39;t expect them to keep.  Everyone in my family has <br/>
served in some branch of the military and not one of them came away <br/>
from it better for the experience.  Only my husband gained a <br/>
marketable skill from the Navy, but the &quot;free&quot; training was not <br/>
worth the price he paid (six years of bondage to the sea and a <br/>
broken marriage, etc.)  <br/>
<br/>
Anway, I sent him a link to Sandra&#39;s latest article on Kirby now <br/>
that he&#39;s come of age -- I keep thinking something will hit home and <br/>
it will click for him sooner or later.  Perhaps I should have <br/>
controlled my urge to tell Brandon to relax and enjoy life a little <br/>
when he was at that turning point and, like Kirby, he would have <br/>
naturally practiced what his mom wanted to preach without any <br/>
prompting.  &#39;Tis a puzzlement... shall we dance?  Talk about a <br/>

<br/>
Brandon was sixteen that year and he was headed to Hawai&#39;i to join <br/>
his mom at her new station in Pearl Harbor.  She & his stepdad had <br/>
big plans to homeschool him and his two younger brothers while they <br/>
were on an adventure in Paradise.  We had hooked &#39;em up with Earl <br/>
Gary while they were in Maine preparing for the trip the year prior, <br/>
and Brandon was quickly becoming disenchanted with the highschool <br/>
routine.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, all their big plans fell through not long after they <br/>
arrived on base.  The younger kids got put back in school for some <br/>
reason and their dad went back to work while Brandon was left home <br/>
to fend for himself.  They were trying to set up &quot;school at home&quot; <br/>
and Brandon was at a loss as to how to explain unschooling to them <br/>
(he&#39;d only homeschooled with us for a year when he was about <br/>
twelve.)  <br/>
<br/>
Bud didn&#39;t have enough courage to defy their workbook mentality, nor <br/>
enough self-direction to find something interesting to do on the <br/>
islands while everyone was wasting their own opportunities 9-5 -- so <br/>
he came home after Christmas, hair much longer & down in the dumps <br/>
about his plight in life.  Spent a few months hanging out, but he <br/>
was anxious to get out and DO something, but what??  Decided to cut <br/>
his hair and try flipping burgers and I bit my tongue, not because <br/>
it wasn&#39;t a &quot;worthy&quot; occupation, but because I knew he had no real <br/>
interest in it.  <br/>
<br/>
Soon moved on to cashiering at the local market, and I wished him <br/>
the best... then finally some older friends talked Brandon into a <br/>
program at the local community college that promised a &quot;secure <br/>
future&quot; -- red flag.  He was determined to try the conventional <br/>
path, no matter what, and be a &quot;success&quot; in the *normal* sense of <br/>
the word.  It ain&#39;t happened yet, and now he&#39;s back with his mom and <br/>
stepdad again trying to meet the weight requirements to join the fun <br/>
in Iraq.  I&#39;m guilty of sending *Häagen-Dazs* thoughts his way... so <br/>
shoot me!</div>

<br/>
This is not to say that that&#39;s not a success, but in each of these particular <br/>
cases (two for sure and one I haven&#39;t talked to him for a few years) it seems <br/>
to be that they would rather just sign up with someone who would train and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131696055">oh sweet revenge (in a nice way). my sil had no children and she was the <br/>
worst critic of how i raise my dd. the whole family pretty much thinks i&#39;m <br/>
nuts but that is another story. anyway my sil had a baby 2 years ago and <br/>
everyone was yelling at her to do this don&#39;t do that etc. she was so <br/>
confused she didn&#39;t even want to hold the baby (so sad). when we were there <br/>
visiting i told her to stop listening to everyone else. just smile at them <br/>
and nod and then do whatever you want. i told her she is the mother and no <br/>
one would do a better job than her if she would just listen to herself. it <br/>
was the first real connection we had made in the 10 years of me marrying <br/>
into the family. well fast forward and she is standing up to the family left <br/>
and right. she does things her way and &quot;spoils&quot; her boy just like i think <br/>
she should.<br/>
bonus.. she never tries to tell me what i&#39;m doing wrong now because she is <br/>

&gt;Tracy ,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I totally relate to your story about your stepdad.  I have to deal with the <br/>
&gt;same thing with my in laws as well as my mother.  Thanksgiving was a <br/>
&gt;disaster last year for my oldest who was also four.  The in laws were on <br/>
&gt;his case for everything.  I really like the part when they leave breakables <br/>
&gt;out and then get mad at the kids for wanting to play with them.  My mother <br/>
&gt;is constantly trying to correct the behavior in my kids that she thinks <br/>
&gt;needs work.  It&#39;s almost like they all can&#39;t stand the way my husband and I <br/>
&gt;parent and they all have the attitude that as long as the kids are under <br/>
&gt;their roof, they will act the way the in laws and mother want them to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve basically reached the conclusion that everyone is a critic when it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;not their child and they don&#39;t live your life all day.  Some of my <br/>
&gt;childless friends are even critics.  &quot;When we have kids, we&#39;re not going to <br/>
&gt;let them to that&quot;  is their mantra.  I feel like saying, you haven&#39;t even <br/>
&gt;been up all night with a newborn yet, shut up!  LOL<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm, yeah, &#39;undermining her authority&quot; eh? That&#39;s so absurd a thing <br/>
to say at all, but to a grown woman with a son of her own? You could <br/>
always pack up and leave -- or bring your own condiments next time. ;)&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s where it originated... He (being 5 years old) was pouring his <br/>
own catsup onto his plate and in my mother&#39;s opinion (and probaby my dad&#39;s, <br/>
too-but he wouldn&#39;t have made a fuss) he poured too much (maybe 2 heaping <br/>
tablespoons, max). She started in on how &quot;if he couldn&#39;t pour a reasonable amount, <br/>
next time he couldn&#39;t pour his own catsup, that someone else would have to pour <br/>
it for him&quot;-I was stunned! Its smooshed tomatoes, for crying out loud! $2 a <br/>
bottle on sale! So, I calmly and reasonably-toned, smiling gently, said, &quot;Well, <br/>
how about if we buy you guys&#39; next bottle of catsup?&quot; She looked daggers at me <br/>
and got up and left the table! (Which is saying a lot for my mother, who likes <br/>
to clean the leavings from everyone else&#39;s plates when they&#39;re full)<br/>
So, after we finished, I went in to where she was to appologise for offending <br/>
her (I had no clue what the hell had offended her at the time), and explain <br/>
that I thought that&#39;s what her &quot;manners/criteria&quot; would demand in reparation of <br/>
the &quot;waste&quot; of catsup. That&#39;s when she blew her top at me (away from Wyl&#39;s <br/>
site and hearing) that I was undermining her authority with Wyl-especially when <br/>
I explained the differences in our ideals-catsup is just not that important to <br/>
me! Neither is $2!! She went into this long tirade on how sometime in the <br/>
future catsup might not be so &quot;plentiful&quot; and cheap, and then what would we do?! <br/>
Gee, I don&#39;t know-deal with it when and IF it ever happens? Cripes, he&#39;s not <br/>
stupid. Nor can I ever forsee catsup being that important to me. We usually <br/>
only use it at her house, once a week, anyhow.<br/>
After that sunk in, I had this almost uncontrolable urge to go buy the big <br/>
bottle of catsup, get a paperplate (at home) and joyfully empty the damn thing <br/>
onto the plate with gusto and joy!! I thought that might be a little spiteful, <br/>
and not sure what message it would send to Wyl, so I just relished that little <br/>
thought in my head for weeks! :~D<br/>
Now, she&#39;s feeling it necessary to tell me what it is we&#39;re &quot;teaching&quot; Wyl-or <br/>
what he&#39;s &quot;learning&quot;-example: when he agreed to spend the night at grandma <br/>
and grandad&#39;s house one night (my folks), and then, later in the week, changed <br/>
his mind. My mother is telling me we should &quot;force him to stick to his original <br/>
decision&quot;, because by letting him change his mind, he&#39;s learning how to <br/>
&quot;manipulate people&quot;! Ummm... couldn&#39;t he be learning how to make the right decision <br/>
in the FIRST place? Learning to know his own mind? Yeah, like my mother has <br/>
never changed her mind in her life... Sorry, all-didn&#39;t mean to get off on a <br/>
rant-my mother just gets my dander up. And this is just the teeny-est tip of the <br/>
iceburg! Okay, going to go calm down, now... :~D<br/>

Your mother is not thinking logically - does she realize how insane it<br/>
sounds to talk about future catsup supplies at all? The only reason this<br/>
topic of conversation could be remotely reasonable is if you worked in the<br/>
food supply industry. My mother is often illogical also - and was even<br/>
before her brain aneurism 2.5 years ago. Years past she used to be convinced<br/>
that the USSR was going to physically invade the USA at any moment and<br/>
literally have soldiers marching in to every town to &quot;take over&quot; running it.<br/>
I said to her, &quot;do you realize what a huge logistical task it would be to<br/>
just take over the daily organization of 250 million unwilling victims?&quot; She<br/>
just wasn&#39;t thinking it through. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;After that sunk in, I had this almost uncontrolable urge to go buy the<br/>

week, changed his mind. My mother is telling me we should &quot;force him to<br/>
stick to his original decision&quot;, because by letting him change his mind,<br/>
he&#39;s learning how to &quot;manipulate people&quot;! Ummm... couldn&#39;t he be learning<br/>
how to make the right decision in the FIRST place? Learning to know his own<br/>
mind? Yeah, like my mother has never changed her mind in her life... Sorry,<br/>
all-didn&#39;t mean to get off on a rant-my mother just gets my dander up. And<br/>
this is just the teeny-est tip of the iceburg!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn isn&#39;t very good at holding up her end of a deal yet either. I&#39;m sure<br/>
she will be eventually. I expect disappointment was coloring your mother&#39;s<br/>
reaction in that case. I hope she doesn&#39;t see it as a lost opportunity to<br/>
get Wyl alone and fix some of the dangerous damage you are doing to him? <br/>
<br/>
My mother is wrong (from my point of view) about how to handle almost<br/>
everything. She was wrong in her parenting when I was young, wrong (in the<br/>
sense of producing sadness and anger) in many of her dealings with my<br/>
stepfather, and she is usually wrong now on those occasions when she makes<br/>
her parenting/marriage ideas known. Her paradigm is that it is the wife and<br/>
mother&#39;s job to control, direct and &quot;improve&quot; the basic character of the<br/>
husband, child or any one else she may come into contact with. Then the<br/>
methods she chooses for that basically wrong endeavor are additionally just<br/>
plain ineffective and ...wrong. <br/>
<br/>
When she starts critiquing on the phone, I end the conversation at once. I<br/>
only see her once a year. They usually come at Christmas; this year they<br/>
came in September for reasons of their own that are unclear to me (my dad<br/>
has a lot of leeway in when he schedules his annual 4 week vacation). I<br/>
suspect that they are trying to manipulate us into spending Christmas with<br/>
them. My dh won&#39;t travel at Christmas, he has an aversion to crowds at the<br/>
best of times. They know this. He would travel to visit prior to or<br/>
following the actual holidays instead. We make this offer every year, but<br/>
the date is magical to them. <br/>
<br/>
My mother has become such a fragile shadow of her former self. She mostly<br/>
sits and just watches. When she makes criticisms I have to stop myself from<br/>
reacting in the same vigorous manner that I used to when she was fully alert<br/>
and competent. Sadly it seems like the part of her personality that has<br/>
remained strongest is that which is most unpleasant. She has become<br/>
reluctant or unable to make any simple decision - like what to order from<br/>
the menu. Jayn was so gentle and caring of her, helping her sit or stand,<br/>
guiding her around obstacles, speaking in a sweet little voice. Then Mum<br/>
would try to show disapproval for some perfectly innocuous behavior like<br/>
jumping on a chair, by refusing to hug her goodbye. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn didn&#39;t seem to notice. She is the most forgiving, optimistic, &quot;see the<br/>
good in you&quot; person I know. She will look for the good inside every<br/>
disappointment with the phrase &quot;Well at least we can.....&quot; She is completely<br/>
convinced that even past death her Grandpa Jim and Grandma Paula still love<br/>
her, despite the fact that the former&#39;s indifference has only been exceeded<br/>
by his late wife&#39;s vindictiveness.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that my mother has been reduced to her current state. When she was<br/>
well she still was the victim of illogical fears (like a kidnapping in<br/>
Houston would be a reason for me never to leave the house in Los Angeles),<br/>
but then logic could be used to counter them, and she was much more able to<br/>
express that which was good and loving and playful in her towards Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing helpful, just some thoughts sparked.<br/>

topic of conversation could be remotely reasonable is if you worked in the<br/>
food supply industry.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking one day at a burger joint when they gave us a handful of <br/>
disposable ketchup packets that I bet as much ketchup is thrown away as actually <br/>
eaten in the U.S., which is probably fine.  It&#39;s tomato-based salt and sugar, <br/>
kind of, I think.  Vinegar.  It&#39;s &quot;a sauce.&quot;  It&#39;s not &quot;a food.&quot;  It&#39;s really <br/>
REALLY not &quot;a big deal.&quot;<br/>

I agree with her lightly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Yesterday I watched a lot of Wooster and Jeeves, while working on new sets of <br/>
Thinking Sticks.    Several times characters said that someone (a valet or <br/>
potential wife) &quot;might be able to make something of him&quot; (usually about Wooster).<br/>
<br/>
My mother in law is grumpy that Keith cared more about how I wanted him to be <br/>
than the way she wanted.   But she did a huge job on her own husband. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yes I can vouch for that. One day quite awhile ago Joe went to Burger King<br/>
and we all had it at home. Later after everything was cleaned up, I caught<br/>
my mom in the kitchen snipping open all the ketchups packs from the bag and<br/>
putting them into the ketchup bottle. She really only stopped because she<br/>
was embarrassed when my oldest and I saw her doing it and laughed. We<br/>
weren&#39;t trying to be mean, but it was really a funny sight. It was the<br/>
depression warp with her too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610979226">So that got me to thinking...Assuming a 12 oz. bottle of ketchup, that ketchup is going at $10 something a gallon!  I&#39;m paying $2 a GALLON for  diesel for my car.  <br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
 <br/>
LOL I had to wonder where she&#39;s buying her catsup, or how big a bottle is $2!  I picked up a 24oz bottle last week for 88 cents at WalMart.   More like $4.50 a gallon, but you&#39;re right still more than twice the price of the diesel for my car, too!  And we buy a lot of catsup (I almost never eat the stuff, but dh and boys live on it!).  When the boys over-serve it -- and when don&#39;t they? -- I just scoop what&#39;s left off the plate and back into the bottle.  At least I put it in the fridge at home.  You&#39;d be amazed at how rare it is for restaurants to refrigerate catsup -- and that&#39;s after they consolidate bottles. For that reason alone, the only way we eat catsup away from home is in to go packs.<br/>

Not just the Depression, but WWII for some folks.  My inlaws grew up in Hawaii, with dusk-to-dawn blackout curfews, and all sorts of rations.  My mil actually washes and re-uses ziplok bags, as well as ever plastic container for things like margarine.  I think she also re-uses aluminum foil when she can.<br/>

My mother was born in 1934 to a reasonably affluent Brisbane family. She<br/>
lived in Townsville in Queensland, Australia during much of WWII - with<br/>
major US military presence and tank traps on the beaches. As an adult she<br/>
traveled much of the world as an entertainer including behind the iron<br/>
curtain Czechoslovakia when I was a toddler. Finally she came to the US to<br/>
live in 1980, at which time she developed her unusual fear of the Red Menace<br/>
- shortly before the Soviet Union collapsed.<br/>
