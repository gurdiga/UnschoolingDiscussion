<div id="ygrps-yiv-558663731">I&#39;m posting this hoping that one of you has some information I can share with a friend on the issue of &quot;handedness&quot; in children.<br/>
<br/>
My friend has her son enrolled in a Montessori school right now and they have been having some problem behavior issues with him.  The head instructor was telling Lindsay that Kai didn&#39;t seem to have a hand preference, he even changes from one hand to another for most tasks.  She says it may be causing him frustration and suggested that they begin encouraging him to use one hand or the other for each task.<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan hasn&#39;t shown a hand preference yet either and seems adept at using both.  I&#39;ve never given it a thought and figured he would be double blessed to have full use of both.  My first instinct is that this woman is full of &quot;hooey&quot; and that saying things like, &quot;Maybe you can draw/paint/build with just one hand this time.&quot; is stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very interested to know what you wise ones might know on this subject.<br/>

&lt;&lt;My first instinct is that this woman is full of &quot;hooey&quot; and that saying<br/>
things like, &quot;Maybe you can draw/paint/build with just one hand this time.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like hooey to me too. I&#39;m wondering exactly what kind of frustration<br/>
this boy seems to be having. Could be that if the teacher is having a<br/>
problem with him not preferring one hand to another, he&#39;s sensing that and<br/>
that&#39;s where his frustration is coming from. Not being left to do what he<br/>
wants how he wants to! I don&#39;t see how making a child chose a hand is a good<br/>
thing. He&#39;ll find his way and do what works best.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph used both at a young age and then definitely became a lefty. If there<br/>
was ever a time when something in particular frustrated him, we would ask if<br/>
maybe he wanted to try it the &quot;other&quot; way. So he was able to decide for<br/>
himself which way worked best. And sometimes, in sporting things, right<br/>
worked and sometimes it was left. Everyone except for one nephew is right<br/>
handed in both our families. If I just assumed Joseph would be a righty too,<br/>
that wouldn&#39;t have been any better than if I never let him try right handed<br/>
things because he was obviously a lefty.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499454724">&lt;&lt;The head instructor was telling Lindsay that Kai didn&#39;t seem to have a <br/>

encouraging him to use one hand or the other for each task.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds to me like a woman pulling at straws.  She thinks he *may* be <br/>
frustrated?  Yes, she sounds full of &#39;hooey&#39;.  Is there any basis for her <br/>
believing his ambidexterity is frustrating him?  Sounds like it is <br/>
frustrating HER.<br/>
<br/>
My Lauren is left handed.  She has been since birth, although it appeared <br/>
that she was ambidexterous.  She still uses both hands while writing.  When <br/>
one hand gets tired, she switches.  I&#39;ve heard this is more common in left <br/>
handed people than in right.  When my grandmother used to *encourage* her to <br/>
use her right hand, she would become frustrated and irritable.  My guess is <br/>
that Kai&#39;s teacher is probably pushing the *wrong* hand and causing him <br/>
frustration, rather than he being frustrated by not having a *chosen* <br/>
handedness.  Left to his own accord, he will choose the hand that works best <br/>
for him at the right time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this helps any, but if he were my child, I&#39;d make it clear <br/>
that whatever hand he chooses is HIS choice.  It is very damaging to <br/>
children who are left handed to be forced into being *right*.  If he was a <br/>
solid right handed kid, I&#39;m sure she would have other judgements as to the <br/>
reasons behind his frustrations.  Unless he expresses frustration in his <br/>
handedness, how is she to know?  This used to be a wide spread problem &#39;back <br/>
in the day&#39;.  I thought people were over that by now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169141208">JP is ambidextrous because he sucks his right thumb.   He uses his right hand <br/>
unless he is sucking his thumb, then he just uses his left hand.    When he <br/>
needs both hands, sometimes he does get frustrated because his instinct is to <br/>
have his thumb in his mouth.   He is &quot;weaning himself&quot; from sucking his thumb <br/>
now because his thumb got very raw, cracked, peeling, sore.   We put desitin on <br/>
it and he has not sucked it in 2 days.   In a way, he is glad his thumb is <br/>
sore, because he has been wanting to stop sucking it, and this is a very natural <br/>
deterrent.   Now, when it heals up, who knows, he may start sucking it again<br/>

alone until *he* chooses which hand he prefers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s that way.  He picks something up with a near hand and might or might <br/>
not switch.<br/>
<br/>
He writes left-handed and played hockey right-handed.<br/>
<br/>
Keith, his dad/my husband, is more left-handed.  He does SCA combat, <br/>
lefthanded.  But one year he was bored and decided to spend the winter fighting <br/>
right-handed.  That happens when they lose use of an arm during a tournament anyway, <br/>
and so it&#39;s worth practicing.<br/>
<br/>
Months passed, of every-week fighter practice.  Guys joined.   Spring came <br/>
and there was a real tournament, and Keith fought left handed.  Those who&#39;d <br/>
known him a long time were not surprised.  Those who&#39;d met him that year were <br/>
stunned.  He was good enough to be scary with the &quot;wrong&quot; hand.   I remember one <br/>
guys standing up really straight like a meercat and saying &quot;Why is he fighting <br/>
left handed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone said, &quot;Because he IS left handed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t mean to be devious, he just had a project going. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty says <br/>
left:<br/>
boffers (swordish play)<br/>
shooting games (remote control, left)<br/>
paintball he can&#39;t remember which hand  (Thought, and says &quot;oh yeah, it was <br/>
lefthanded&quot;)<br/>
eats<br/>
<br/>
right:<br/>
throws a ball<br/>
plays hockey<br/>
drinks right-handed<br/>

<br/>
Cup in right hand, spoon in left, he can eat faster.<br/>

She probably has a box to check on an evaluation form, or is trying to figure <br/>
out where to seat him at a table, or in a left-handed desk or right.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been with a lefty and had a lefty  kid for years and years, and I still <br/>
forget about restaurant seating (not to get into a booth next to a lefty&#39;s <br/>
left elbow) and I set the table for righties always, and I hand things toward <br/>
their right hands and they reach out with their left.   Spatial is NOT my skill.  <br/>
Keith says don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s so used to righties he compensates without <br/>
really thinking about it.<br/>

I feel a little guilty not being more hospitable and aware, but there it is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am so glad to hear this, I thought my two girls were the only ones who bat <br/>
left handed and then throw right handed.  When they were little and first <br/>
playing T-Ball we had to look extra hard to find tiny gloves for lefties (they <br/>
both wrote left handed, ate left handed) then we noticed they would catch the <br/>
ball in their glove, throw off the glove and throw the ball with the same hand.  <br/>
Of course at first it was fine for T-Ball.  As they grew older and competition <br/>
increased it was too time consuming and just ODD.  <br/>
<br/>
So luckily we figured out with the oldest, bats left throws right, get her a <br/>
regular right handed glove.  <br/>

I can say that I&#39;ve had more than one teacher conference when they were <br/>
little about this, telling me that it was &quot;best&quot; for them if I made them choose one <br/>
or the other.  I didn&#39;t, they chose on their own and are happy with doing <br/>
something&#39;s left handed and some things right handed.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t switch off and use each hand equally or interchangeably so that <br/>
isn&#39;t truly ambidextrous is it?<br/>
<br/>
My boys are right handed, never using the left or even tried.<br/>
<br/>
Myself and Dh are both right handers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880161953">This child is about 4 or so? At that age, Patrick still routinely ate with <br/>
both hands - if I gave him a spoon and a fork he&#39;d have one in each hand <br/>
alternating bites. :) He didn&#39;t completely settle on his left for eating till about <br/>
six or seven, I think. He seemed quite happy switching around so we just let <br/>
him be, we&#39;d even set the table with his utensils above his plate in the middle, <br/>
not wanting to bias the process. :) He just turned 11. He eats left, writes <br/>
left, mouses right, bats and throws and golfs right. I wonder if he&#39;s a lefty <br/>
or righty at Lego?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand - he also used to switch hands for writing and drawing, but <br/>
at 6 or so he was getting pretty frustrated with his skills so we did <br/>
encourage him to play around with implements to see if he could figure out if one <br/>
hand or the other seemed more comfortable and easier, and then to practice with <br/>
that hand. He settled on the left pretty quickly after that.<br/>
<br/>
On the third hand &lt;g&gt; I can&#39;t believe in handedness frustration causing <br/>
behaviour issues in unrelated areas. And if the teacher is saying it &quot;may&quot; be <br/>
causing him frustration she&#39;s blowing smoke, she&#39;s uncomfortable watching him <br/>
switch back and forth. If HE were frustrated nobody would have to guess about it. <br/>

<br/>
Seems to me he put the glove on his stump as he pitched, then slipped his<br/>
hand into the glove to be ready for the ball to be batted (or thrown) back.<br/>
He&#39;d catch the ball, tuck the glove under his arm as he pulled the ball out<br/>
and threw it.<br/>
<br/>
(Obviously a different situation, but reminded me of it.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655259057">I&#39;m mostly ambidextrous but there are certain things in which I have to use a particular hand.  For example I write (much better) with my left hand and can only bowl with my right.  My husband thinks it&#39;s so weird that I can use hand and/or power tools with either.  For some reason I have always referred to myself as being left-handed.  I have a (true) left-handed sister and everyone else in our large family is right-handed.  I tried to learn to write with my right hand when I was about 8 after being teased in school (surprise) but decided it wasn&#39;t worth it.  <br/>
Years ago someone mentioned to me that it was not a hereditary factor, might be fun to research.....<br/>

  Some kids are ambidextrous.  My uncle was.  I think they should let him alone until *he* chooses which hand he prefers.<br/>
