&gt; you might want to try soy &quot;nut&quot; butter. It&#39;s 100% nut free, but tastes just<br/>
&gt; like peanut butter. I have 2 w/peanut allergies (1 life threatening) and<br/>
&gt; they do fine w/it. You can find it at Trader Joes and other supermarkets.<br/>

What brand of soy butter?<br/>
I&#39;ve only been able to find one brand and it tastes like um, well crap.<br/>
I can&#39;t have peanut butter because of kidney stone problems so I&#39;ve been<br/>
using almond and cashew.<br/>
<br/>
Nanci ... Cashew and almond....<br/>
Would those be ok Nanci? or is it an allergy that includes all nuts?<br/>
