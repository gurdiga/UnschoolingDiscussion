 Oddly, my son went through a period where he wanted quite difficult math<br/>
 workbooks and the more &quot;interactive&quot; ones bored him.  He wanted row after<br/>
 row of math problems.  So, I got him a workbook and he worked through the<br/>
 pretests until he hit one that he got fewre than 90% correct.  Then he<br/>
 started on the chapter, skipping what was easy, and spent a few weeks<br/>
 &quot;doing math&gt;&quot;  I say it is odd because I HATED math and just can&#39;t see<br/>
 someone enjoying doing it that way.  He&#39;d finished with that stage for<br/>
 now. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Dawn, all I have to say is, COOL . . .  Isn&#39;t it amazing what our kids do on <br/>
their own. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m leaving Math-U-See for Carolyn, my 6 year old.  She hates it.  <br/>
Hates the manipulatives, refuses to use them.  Hates the worksheets too.  I&#39;m <br/>
taking a big gulp here.  Emily, my 11 year old, has done so well at using <br/>
Math-U-See at her own speed, learning things in areas where she felt only <br/>
failure in public school.  But Carolyn is so different.  She mastered skip <br/>
counting by 5&#39;s, 10&#39;s and 2&#39;s, and addition with nine.  Now she wants nothing <br/>
to do with addition with 8.  So, we&#39;ve dropped it.  I don&#39;t put out the books <br/>
for her anymore.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who pray, I would so appreciate your prayers for my family <br/>
during a very difficult time.   I have a growth in my leg that I hope to have <br/>
some answers to later this week.  It has prevented me from  being my usual <br/>
active self with my children.  And, my husband&#39;s sister passed away last <br/>
weekend.  We saw her at Christmas and my oldest is having a really difficult <br/>
time with this.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;  My problem is that everytime we get the workbooks <br/>
 out it reminds me of school.  It doesn&#39;t bother the kids at all.  It&#39;s just <br/>
 MY problem.  sigh...   School sure does leave long-lasting marks on those of <br/>
 us who have been through it.  <br/>

Well, just think, maybe your kids won&#39;t have that negative connotation in <br/>
their minds when they see a workbook or textbook or any sort of book when <br/>
they are grownups and trying to offer opportunities for their children to <br/>
learn.  They will be even more free than you are.  That&#39;s progress!  <br/>
