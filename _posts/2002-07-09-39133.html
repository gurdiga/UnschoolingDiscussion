<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361490046">BRENDA said, &quot;But how do I get them beyond the &quot;teach me&quot; mentality <br/>
to learn themselves?...&quot;  And one reply was<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Maybe you could say you&#39;re the coach, and they need to do there <br/>
violin-related things each week besides playing it some (don&#39;t <br/>
say &quot;practicing,&quot; say &quot;play your violin during the week,&quot; and then it <br/>
won&#39;t be homework, it will be the coach reminding them to DO).&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of the &quot;think system&quot; from The Music Man  it <br/>
actually worked, remember??  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
PAM:  I can remember wanting to know how to play &quot;Fur Elise&quot; on the <br/>
piano so badly, but it was in the 3rd Suzuki book.  I quit lessons in <br/>
the middle of the 2nd book and never did learn to play that.  If a <br/>
teacher had &quot;taught&quot; me (allowed me to learn?) that piece, or if <br/>
someone had encouraged me that I COULD play if I tried to plunk <br/>
through it who knows if I&#39;d have kept with the piano?  Maybe someday <br/>
I&#39;ll take it up again  =-(<br/>
