<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385713793">In many places, immunizations are no longer required, but the schools will not tell parents this.  Tell her to ask for an immunization waiver, and if they refuse, ask her doctor to write a letter about it, and call the health department about the routine of waivers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874753575">Brenda, <br/>
<br/>
In Calif. you simply turn over the form they give you to list their shot<br/>
records and there is a small box that says that you can sign there if you<br/>
consider yourself exempt for personal or religious reasons. No one ever<br/>
turns over the form to see that it is there because if you immunize you<br/>
simply sign the front portion. I would imagine most if not all states<br/>
have this waiver...she just has to keep asking for it.<br/>
