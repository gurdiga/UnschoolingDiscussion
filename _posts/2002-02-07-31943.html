<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457961514">Corina, how wonderful and exciting for you!  I don&#39;t think we need to<br/>
tell them to sound it out.  Sometimes when we say bossy stuff like that,<br/>
we are telling them how to read, instead of letting them be free to<br/>
figure their own way to do it.  It might be helpful to show them how to<br/>
sound out by syllable at a time when they are not in the middle of<br/>
reading.  But maybe their brain wants to do it a different way?  Anyway,<br/>
it&#39;s polite to give someone information when they ask for it.  When my<br/>
kids say, &quot;What is this word?&quot; I tell them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271756766">hi!<br/>
<br/>
I have a thought, or a question, or something :)<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (now 11) started reading sponutaneously (to quote Montesorri).  No sounding out, no figuring, no nothing.  Just started reading.  And hasn&#39;t stopped since. 3 years of reading and he now reads &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, anything!  When he did come across a word he didn&#39;t know, I just gave it to him, didn&#39;t ask him to &quot;sound it out&quot; or anything.  He knows phonics (kids pick that up naturally, I believe)<br/>
<br/>
Well...now my youngest 2 aged 5 and 7 have decided to read!  I&#39;ve known for a while that they had the pre-reading skills because we read constantly around here.  They&#39;d do things like &quot;hey mom, moon and monkey start with the same letter!&quot; and they know to read left to right.<br/>
<br/>
So we went to the library and picked out BOB books.  They&#39;re very simple - Mat. Mat sat. Mat sat on Sam. etc.  My 7 year old started sounding out the words!  I was very impressed!  He read the books sounding out all the words.  When he came to &quot;the&quot; and &quot;and&quot; I just gave him the words.  My 5 year old appears more like his older brother.  When he comes to word he doesn&#39;t know he might sound the first sound and then just goes with what he thinks.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so here&#39;s the question.  I have always believed that making children sound out words was cruel and took away from the enjoyment of reading.  YET...my 7 year old seems capable of working it out himself and actually enjoys it.  Should I say &quot;sound it out&quot;?  Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m just so excited about this!  See, unschooling works!  I just want to walk up to people who don&#39;t always give me such an easy time and say &quot;Look, they can read!  They know phonics!  They never touched a workbook or went to school and listen to a teacher say a is for apple.  Let&#39;s draw 314 of them!&quot; LOL<br/>

I would probably say, &quot;If you need anyhelp let me know&quot; and then wait for<br/>
them to ask.<br/>
You might also want to ask, &quot;How do you want me to help you?&quot;<br/>

I think a change in the wording would take it from *making*, to <br/>
offering.<br/>
Like &quot;Do you want to try and sound it out?&quot;.<br/>
I do that with my son <br/>
only occasionally, because his answer is usually &quot;no&quot;  (he just wants <br/>
quick information).  But, if he enjoyed it, he would probably say yes <br/>
and try it more often.  No pressure either way.<br/>

<br/>
My dd sounds out and is learning to read phonetically. Her choice.  Its the <br/>
only<br/>
way that makes sense to her. She doesn&#39;t like the bob books because its too<br/>
much like memorization to her and she feels that she doesn&#39;t really know how<br/>
to &quot;read&quot; the word she just remembers the text.  My next child appears to<br/>
be more of a visual whole word learner.  She has also told me that she only<br/>
likes to learn words when she is using them herself  (writing valentines for<br/>
instance).  If she can&#39;t use it or doesn&#39;t currently need it she thinks its<br/>
ridiculous to study/practice it.  Well, okie then &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some children learn to read phonetically, and some are sight readers.  My<br/>
firstborn and I are sight readers and seldom misspell a word; once we&#39;ve<br/>
seen it we have it for life.<br/>
<br/>
My younger son has to sound out words phonetically to figure them out.  I<br/>
say, whatever works for the child should be used.  If your child likes to<br/>
sound them out, and is auditory enough to need that style of learning, go<br/>
for it!<br/>

say, &quot;You know, you could try to sound it out if I&#39;m ever not right <br/>
here. Do you want me to show you how?&quot;  Sometimes he let me sound it, <br/>
sometimes not.<br/>
It seems to walk the line pretty well I think, but then he is a <br/>
