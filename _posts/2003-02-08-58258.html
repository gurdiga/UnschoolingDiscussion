 </span></blockquote>These people have been to my house numerous times, and know I have very<br/>
poor reception and no cable due to our location. They chose to come<br/>
anyway. <br/>
And I was just using Thanksgiving as an example because it occurred with<br/>
more than one person. But some guests come, and it doesn&#39;t matter what<br/>
season it is, they have to watch some kind of sports on tv, or can&#39;t miss<br/>
their reality show, or whatever. I guess my point was more along the<br/>
lines of people not just being able to visit with people. I would never<br/>
think of accepting an invitation to someone&#39;s house, to go and read a<br/>
book by myself in the corner. That is just plain rude. I guess maybe if<br/>
sports watching was more of an inclusive social event, I would be more<br/>
accepting of it. Whenever it has involved my family, it has always been a<br/>
*children leave the room*, *total silence for fear of missing a play*<br/>
kind of thing. And it is only fun (if you want to call screaming<br/>
obscenities at the tv fun) for the couple of people actually interested<br/>
in it. You are welcome to disagree, but in my opinion sports are taken<br/>
way too seriously at gatherings that should be festive, and if you are<br/>
grumpy because the place that you knowingly *chose* to be does not have<br/>
tv available, then yes, it has a hold on you.<br/>
