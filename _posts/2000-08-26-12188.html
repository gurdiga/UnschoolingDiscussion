 </span></blockquote>Wow, Michelle, that turns everybody upside down!  It is so hard dealing with <br/>
a new baby and your other child&#39;s behavioral issues at the same time!  <br/>
Especially when I bet a lot of those behaviors are a direct result of having <br/>
the new baby in the house.  I promise things will get better.  But it will <br/>
take time and consistency.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s my biggest problem, too.  I really have to pay attention to my voice, <br/>
even now.  There are still times when my son tries my patience -- that will <br/>
never go away, I&#39;m sure -- but it has gotten easier.   Even if a calm voice <br/>
is not second nature, I&#39;ve tried to make it a habit to stop and think before <br/>
I say anything (the old count to 10 trick).  <br/>

consistency, it works.  You guys are going through a really trying time, <br/>
right now.  But, as the bible says, this too shall pass.  If you have any <br/>
questions or problems, I can give you some ideas to try.  Just let me know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re so kind.  Funny thing is, since we started homeschooling three years <br/>
ago, I find that I am much more willing to try new things.  That led to a <br/>
willingness to try new ways of relating to my children.  After all, <br/>
homeschooling and especially unschooling are huge new ways of relating, <br/>
right?  But, I am also much more opinionated, so I tend to tell everybody <br/>
what I think, including how to raise their children &lt;grin&gt; so please forgive <br/>
me if I sound too stident.  <br/>
