<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898092924">No Sandra, here&#39;s the difference:<br/>
<br/>
I say, &quot;This is what works for me.  If what you are doing is not working<br/>
you might want to think about it but if you found something that works<br/>
for you, I&#39;d love to hear about it even if I won&#39;t be able to use it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While you seem to being saying, &quot;Your problems would all go away if you<br/>
would just do what I do.&quot;  You never acknowledge that other people may<br/>
have different needs than you, that other children may have problems<br/>
your&#39;s don&#39;t.  That anyone else could possible have found a way of doing<br/>
things that works as well as yours.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no discord in my household and very happy kids.  They have free<br/>
reign over their food intake (with the exception of allergens - which may<br/>
or may not be restricted depending on the point of development.)  But,<br/>
because I had to step in and limit certain foods at certain times, and<br/>
because I have had to step in and take control of the TV with my OCD son,<br/>
you assume that my family if chock full of badness.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly hope you respect the individuality of your children more than<br/>
you respect the individuality of those on this list with you.  I never<br/>
said you were nuts.  I never even said you way can&#39;t work.  I&#39;m sure it<br/>
does work for some.  And I&#39;m equally certain that you are doing a<br/>
disservice to those for whom it can&#39;t work for one reason or another by<br/>
suggesting that they just aren&#39;t doing it right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331379157">Sandra:  I do believe I grasp what you&#39;re talking about in giving children<br/>
choices in their food selection.  This has worked splendidly in our<br/>
household in general.  BUT my daughters condition required her NOT to eat<br/>
some foods...regardless of thier level of healthiness and whether or not<br/>
they were available.  She could choose a healthy diet and still jeapordize<br/>
her well-being.....even her life.  She does not even have the option to<br/>
experiment with how things make her body function and feel.  People coping<br/>
with a child&#39;s nut allergies have even a tougher road to hoe than our<br/>
daughter.  Especially during the toddler/pre-school years.<br/>
<br/>
Overall,  I agree and understand the principle.  And &quot;follow your tasebuds&quot;<br/>
was not the best choice of words. I&#39;m trying to unschool myself in this<br/>
area,  as a matter of fact. Using the book Outsmarting Your Female Fat Cell,<br/>
which basically promotes being in touch with your body&#39;y food cravings and<br/>
desires....and when they are satisfied,  even I gravitate toward a balanced<br/>
healthy diet over the long haul.<br/>
<br/>
For those who have trouble understanding the concept....Penelope Leach<br/>
offers a good discussion in Your Baby And Child.<br/>
<br/>
Susan<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Should she simply follow her taste buds,<br/>
she could still get into trouble..... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When kids are allowed free choice, they don&#39;t go by taste buds.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s seeming impossible for some people to begin to grasp what we&#39;re talking<br/>
about.  Kids who have free choice eat protein, vegetables, fruit.  Not ONLY<br/>
those, but they eat all kinds of food, by choice.  And when it has been<br/>
choice (because they become hungry for all kinds of foods--the body balances<br/>
itself), they have no aversions to any foods they&#39;ve been forced to eat.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The biggest problem in discussing the idea of control in general is that<br/>
most people begin with the socially implanted idea that control is the norm.<br/>
It&#39;s what children need. So someone suggesting &quot;I have come to the<br/>
conclusion that control works for my kids,&quot; is really a reinforment of the<br/>
social norm.<br/>
<br/>
The idea many are working towards is to throw away that idea and begin with<br/>
a new base of operations, a new norm: the idea that control isn&#39;t necessary,<br/>
that children will self-regulate when given the freedom to do so.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s from that point that we can begin modifying for our specific family&#39;s<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
Getting to that point, though, isn&#39;t just a matter of replacing one thought<br/>
with another. The idea that adults know what is better for children than<br/>
children do is deeply ingrained in us. The children-must-be-controlled<br/>
messages of society that we&#39;ve been immersed in from the time *we* were<br/>
infants make it very easy to look at a child indulging in video games or<br/>
junk food for a couple of months, to see the changes in his personality and<br/>
come to the conclusion that he can&#39;t regulate himself and, therefore, must<br/>
be regulated from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve begun from the perspective of no control is necessary, it isn&#39;t<br/>
helpful to suggest to someone whose norm is control who is searching for<br/>
reinforcement that in such-and-such a particular instance control is<br/>
necessary that yes, sometimes control is neceessary.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that has been suggested, that parents know what&#39;s best for their<br/>
kids, doesn&#39;t fly. If that were so, then the only people needing<br/>
psychiatrists would be those who have chemical imbalances or didn&#39;t have<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is that we, as a society, don&#39;t respect kids. It&#39;s portrayed<br/>
as perfectly normal that kids will occasionally protest against what we feel<br/>
is best for them. So we can easily be feel that &quot;something that works&quot; can<br/>
be something that makes the child miserable (until, presumably, they&#39;re old<br/>
enough to &quot;see the light&quot;) but protects the child from something we feel<br/>
might happen or might become permanent.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s helpful to begin from the norm of respecting our children. To<br/>
treat them in terms of helping them grow as we would a close friend. We too<br/>
often see it perfectly normal to treat our chldren in the name of &quot;love&quot; in<br/>
ways that would have our friends avoiding us like the plague.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve begun from the perspective that respect is a given and concluded<br/>
that a special needs child needs someone to step in to help him learn to<br/>
respect himself, then it isn&#39;t as helpful to the mother of what is more<br/>
likely an average child to have the idea of disrespect as a normal tool<br/>
reinforced. She&#39;s already got that every where she turns.<br/>

<br/>
I firmly respect your opinion here BUT.....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve considered myself an unschooler for 11 years now, ever since I <br/>
first read John Holt and decided my oldest was not ever attending <br/>
traditional school. <br/>
<br/>
Over the years, I have had this idea forced on me on nearly every <br/>
unschooling list I&#39;ve been on. I&#39;ve been called a control freak <br/>
because I expect my children to make their beds and brush their <br/>
teeth. My parenting has been attacked and I&#39;ve been told I certainly <br/>
must not bea &quot;real unschooler&quot;. Now I&#39;m not saying that you are doing <br/>
this, Joyce. I believe I understand the message of your post - With <br/>
ideas about how to force and control children so readily available, <br/>
it is important to put other messages out there (am I hearing you <br/>
correctly?). I just want to voice an opinion that says please don&#39;t <br/>
narrowly define unschooling for me. For me, I know that experience <br/>
plays a big part in life. For me, my experience is SOMETIMES more <br/>
important, more vital than the opinions of my children. But I share <br/>
it with them rather than lay down the law. This has been a life long <br/>
effort of building a relationship and trust where my word means <br/>
something to them. I do know more than they do in many areas but my <br/>
trust in them bleeds through and affects both of our decisions. BUt <br/>
if push came to shove, I am the parent and the authority in the <br/>
household. I&#39;ve been known to force or manipulate to get kids off a <br/>
plateu or to move them beyond a comfort level they&#39;ve stayed at a bit <br/>
too long. I&#39;ve pushed them into activities that exposed them to ideas <br/>
they thought they wouldn&#39;t like because I knew/felt there was value <br/>
(and most of the time I was right). I consider these nudges to be <br/>
parenting responsibilities. I&#39;ve helped my kids get over fears and <br/>
opened their eyes to differences of opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
For some, I know I don&#39;t live up to the title &quot;unschooler&quot;. But for <br/>
me, it is a term still evolving and not one I&#39;m always comfortable <br/>
with. Life-learner feels so much better. And if these nudges and <br/>
authority keep me from the select group, so be it. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesn&#39;t feel attacking, Joyce. I&#39;m not wanting to oppose <br/>
your views but you reminded me of some previous situations in the <br/>
unschooling community that I wanted to address.<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve pushed them into activities that exposed them to ideas<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ve done similar (though I would say encourage would describe it<br/>
better, like suggesting how about trying it for 10 or 15 minutes and if you<br/>
don&#39;t like it we&#39;ll do something else -- which she is free to turn down).<br/>
<br/>
But just because children sometimes (or even usually) end up liking it<br/>
doesn&#39;t make it right to force them to do something they don&#39;t want to. I<br/>
think a good litmus test of behavior is would we behave this way towards a<br/>
friend? Would we want our husbands to treat us and think about us that way?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For me, I know that experience<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps the way we parent would look the same. Perhaps I&#39;d even look like a<br/>
control freak next to you ;-) Control is in my nature and I have to<br/>
constantly be aware to avoid acting in the way that comes most naturally to<br/>
me. (Discussing it at great length helps me be more aware. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think the difference, though, is the point of view. I see my daughter&#39;s<br/>
opinion and autonomy as the most important and, if I override her, it&#39;s an<br/>
abberation. The way you&#39;ve stated it implies giving your children permission<br/>
to do as they see fit with you exercising your perogative to step in when<br/>
you see fit.<br/>
<br/>
(Which is an observation and not intended as an argument that my way is<br/>
better. Not that I couldn&#39;t argue it if someone wanted to discuss it! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BUt <br/>
&gt; if push came to shove, I am the parent and the authority in the<br/>
&gt; household.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is your choice. If you choose it because it&#39;s easiest and most<br/>
efficient for you it&#39;s hard to argue. But many of us can effectively argue<br/>
that it isn&#39;t *necessary* in order for kids to become adults that other<br/>
people will like being around.<br/>
<br/>
I *think* a few people can pull it off. They can be authoritarian and their<br/>
children can still feel they&#39;re respected. But I also think there are far<br/>
more people who only think they are respecting their children. (And I&#39;m not<br/>
accusing you. Only you can know.) And I also think there are far more people<br/>
who don&#39;t care whether they&#39;re respecting their children or not, but see a<br/>
good parent&#39;s job as molding kids into the people they are supposed to be,<br/>
being aware that children will naturally resist.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the problems is that control comes naturally to most people.<br/>
It&#39;s part of society. It&#39;s how most of us were raised. If it&#39;s working for<br/>
you, I think it&#39;s *not* the control that&#39;s working but the respect. There<br/>
are *plenty* of examples of authoritarian parenting that turn out sneaky and<br/>
wild kids. So it can&#39;t be the control that&#39;s the determining factor in how<br/>
kids turn out.  Describing how you control your kids will only reinforce<br/>
people&#39;s belief that it is the control that&#39;s the deciding factor and<br/>
central issue. But, I strongly believe, it&#39;s the respect that is the most<br/>
important factor and central issue and that doesn&#39;t get discussed enough.<br/>
It&#39;s always treated as an optional side dish. Or something that&#39;s so obvious<br/>
it needn&#39;t be discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps put it this way: if you had this natural flair for making textbooks<br/>
exciting and your kids ran to listen to textbooks from 9-11 every morning,<br/>
would it be helpful to new unschoolers to describe your use of textbooks for<br/>
2 hours in the morning as unschooling? It&#39;s not the part that looks like<br/>
standard schooling that needs described to help people break out of their<br/>
school think. It&#39;s the parts most people don&#39;t understand like parents being<br/>
enthusiastic themselves about learning.<br/>
<br/>
I think this list, and the message boards even more so, can provide people<br/>
with the opportunity to challenge their thinking. If someone doesn&#39;t want<br/>
the challenge, they can pass it by. If someone feels they&#39;ve already<br/>
challeged themselves enough and come to conclusions that are more in line<br/>
with standard thinking, they can pass it by. But I do think having that<br/>
opportunity available to challenge standard thinking for people who are<br/>
trying out unschooling *is* important. It&#39;s a lot easier for people who<br/>
don&#39;t agree with the challenge to ignore it than it is for people who don&#39;t<br/>
realize standard thinking can be questioned to seek it out.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of places to share authoritarian parenting advice. There are<br/>
lots of places where parents can just go share what they do with each other<br/>
and everyone will cyber-nod and say &quot;That&#39;s nice, this is how I do it,&quot;<br/>
where no one will ask anyone to consider why they made the choices they did<br/>
nor challenge them to defend them.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, one of the problems is that some people separate unschooling and<br/>
parenting and others see it all as just life. For those who unschool<br/>
learning and whose parenting is by conscious choice more controlling, I can<br/>
see how they would feel they were seen as &quot;less than&quot;. It&#39;s easy for someone<br/>
to see their unusual use of textbooks as confusing to new unschoolers so<br/>
they&#39;d probably not mention it much. But if someone sees parental authority<br/>
in life issues as much a part of unschooling as someone who doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s<br/>
natural to feel attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Some who come to this list don&#39;t want to talk about unschooling parenting<br/>
(for want of a better phrase). They only want to talk about how to unschool<br/>
learning better. They want parenting to be whatever you feel comfortable<br/>
with and a respectful exchange of parenting ideas. (And some would like<br/>
unschooling to be whatever you feel comfortable with too, but that won&#39;t fly<br/>
for long ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So, is the answer for those of us who feel the challege is important to keep<br/>
quiet? Is the answer for those who see the challenge as a personal attack on<br/>
their own ability to think for themselves to keep quiet? Personally I know I<br/>
needed the challenge when I first started reading about homeschooling so<br/>
I&#39;ll need to keep challenging in order to provide that opportunity to others<br/>
like me. :-) I figure if someone doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t care to question what they<br/>
do or feels they&#39;ve questioned themselves sufficiently they can skip it. But<br/>
if they enter in, they won&#39;t escape questioning ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hope this doesn&#39;t feel attacking, Joyce.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all :-) I think the problem is that some people see a challange as an<br/>
attack. I often see attacks as a challenge ;-) Of course if the attack is<br/>
just an attack and they&#39;ve no interest in discussing then it&#39;s just boring!<br/>
(None of which is intended personally to anyone, just general observations<br/>
of good discussions and bad.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not wanting to oppose<br/>
&gt; your views but you reminded me of some previous situations in the<br/>
&gt; unschooling community that I wanted to address.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I suspect it will keep happening everywhere in unschooling since there<br/>
will always be people who &quot;unschool&quot; parenting and some who don&#39;t. I just<br/>
think it&#39;s valuable for the discussion to be available for those who get<br/>
intrigued by the questioning of what they always assumed was a given.<br/>
