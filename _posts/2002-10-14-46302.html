<div id="ygrps-yiv-700505441">I am new to this board, having just heard about it at the SC Schools <br/>
Out Support Conference.  On the way home I had an incredible moment <br/>
of realization that I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
At the conference, two adult unschoolers where discussed.  The first <br/>
was a young man, who at 18, decided he wanted to attend college.  He <br/>
took the necessary steps, got into the college of his choice where <br/>
he was on the deans list through out, graduated and is currently <br/>
following his passion.   I have to say I liked this story.  It was <br/>
what I wanted to hear.  Since reading my first John Holt book, two <br/>
years ago, I fell in love with unschooling.  My kids had been trying <br/>
to show me this all along but it took reading the book for it to <br/>
click.  I knew it was for us, BUT I really wanted their educational <br/>
journey to include college.  I felt it was important for our society <br/>
and for growth and development.   Later at the conference, we were <br/>
told about a young woman who, at 19, traveled across the country, <br/>
found an apartment, a job and was taking some classes.  At <br/>
orientation for her new job she was mistaken for a 30 year old <br/>
because of her poise and confidence.  I thought this was a nice <br/>
story too.  Later that day, my sister was talking about a family <br/>
friend.  He was publicly schooled, did what was expected, high <br/>
grades, etc.  He went on to college where he maintained a high GPA.  <br/>
He did this by dropping any class he wasn&#39;t going to succeed in, <br/>
giving no thought to the class, just the grade.  He now lives at <br/>
home with his mom, she thought that was best, works the same job he <br/>
has had since high school and has no plans to leave.  They <br/>
constantly fight and bicker, yet his fear of failure paralyzes him <br/>
to experience life.  After mulling over all of this a bit, it <br/>
finally hit me!!! I don&#39;t want my children to go to college, I want <br/>
my children to live life and pursue their passions.  If that <br/>
includes a trip to college, fine, if not just as fine!  Now many of <br/>
you may be saying `duh&#39; about now:) but this was huge for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that some of the speakers and organizers of the conference <br/>
frequent this board.  I wanted them to know how they had touched <br/>
me.   It was so wonderful to be surrounded by people that love and <br/>
respect kids and young adults.  It was refreshing and reaffirming.   <br/>
I can&#39;t thank them enough for what they have given me and this was <br/>
just one example.  I had many other such moments, too many to <br/>
describe.  <br/>
<br/>
Quick background for me, I have two girls almost 3 and almost 5.  We <br/>
have been enjoying our unschooling journey since birth and look <br/>
forward to many enjoyable years ahead. <br/>
