&lt;&lt; My apologies. I should have looked it up my own self.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok Heidi.<br/>
 It&#39;s that kind of stuff, taken for granted that I find common in Bible <br/>
literalists. They want to stick their fingers in their ears and sing loudly <br/>
to avoid hearing what facts you have that disprove anything they believe.....<br/>
It&#39;s sad, and very unthinking of them. :)<br/>
But you&#39;re going straight to hell in a handbasket for seeing TRUTH, right in <br/>
front of your eyes. It baffles me a little...but then I just remember I was <br/>
SO like that for a large part of my life.<br/>
I didn&#39;t know squat about the Bible until I got away from those type of <br/>
people.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
