<br/>
This kind of statement is plainly aggressive and judgmental, but of course later on you&#39;re going to say that you didn&#39;t mean anything by it... In my dictionary, that&#39;s simply not taking responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
You can be all defensive you want, the fact is that if you guys don&#39;t want to see what&#39;s going on in this list most of the time (only a few here KNOW *what unschooling is all about* and the rest of us mortals have no clue and can be ignored or ripped apart - and of course there&#39;s the ones that don&#39;t say anything), it means you are not objective at all or are simply opting for an easy denial mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s your choice, but there&#39;s no need to give us your cheap psychoanalysis here. And I&#39;d suggest you &quot;bet your life&quot; on things you really know for sure, instead of other people&#39;s personalities and &quot;hidden&quot; motivations.<br/>

<br/>
What I meant by that statement is : I think it&#39;s possible posters who are<br/>
quick to<br/>
 feel injured and claim they have been attacked are probably suffering<br/>
 from low self esteem.    I tried to be as clear as possible.  I tried to<br/>
say what I meant. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s possible very sensitive people may not have the same ability<br/>
to cope with dissenting opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
***You can be all defensive you want, the fact is that if you guys don&#39;t<br/>

are simply opting for an easy denial mechanism.***<br/>
<br/>
There are more than a few people here who know what unschooling is all<br/>
about, and they&#39;re here to help others find out.   No one wants to hurt<br/>
anyone here.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone really disagrees on a point concerning unschooling,  how<br/>
should they respond?  <br/>
<br/>
If I hear someone say they know their child is a natural learner and will<br/>
learn to read in their own time, but they must be told what to eat and<br/>
watch on TV, why wouldn&#39;t it be ok to point out that natural learners can<br/>
learn to listen to their own bodies needs, and make responsible decisions<br/>
as well?    <br/>

Well, from my point of view, it was nice that when Sandra wanted to<br/>
respond to the idea behind my &quot;short order cook&quot; comments, she took the<br/>
time to say something like -- &quot;now this isn&#39;t aimed at Betsy, but....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, it may not be easy to remember to say this every time, and it<br/>
does clutter up the post a bit.<br/>

Yol, some of us have been involved in these kinds of discussions for a long <br/>
time.  This list is relatively new.  The discussions about unschooling <br/>
aren&#39;t.   Three or four times a year someone will show up and be a bundle of <br/>
defensive anger.  Deb&#39;s seen it often.  If you haven&#39;t seen it much, please <br/>
withhold judgment on Deb&#39;s voluntary, free (you said &quot;cheap) summary theories.<br/>
<br/>
If you will save your post and re-read it in a couple of years, I think <br/>
you&#39;ll see that Deb had a legitimate point.<br/>
<br/>
There is another pattern.  Those who are often so disruptive and defensive <br/>
sometimes aren&#39;t committed to unschooling and end up going to eclectic or <br/>
unit studies or something.<br/>
