<div id="ygrps-yiv-679517662">Tina thanks for a very thoughtful message.  I have been reading the thread<br/>
about computers and wondering a lot about the ups and the downs of their<br/>
infuluence on our children.  I know my 7 yo son **loves** them and it can<br/>
get a little obsessive and litterally take over his imagintion for periods<br/>
of time.  What disturbs me is the loss of other imaginative activities (real<br/>
activities as opposed to elecronic simulations... )  (now i am going to get<br/>
it)<br/>
We had resorted to imposing time limits.... recently we have decided this<br/>
restriction may have been making things worse... and so at a family meeting<br/>
we arrived at the idea of allowing constructive activities any time, and<br/>
allowing games for a half hour per 2 computer hours logged on &quot;constuctive&quot;<br/>
activities.<br/>
But I still share your concerns about the losses inherent in encouraging<br/>
computer literacy.  I agree as well the only thing to do is strive for a<br/>
balance and be sure to prestent lots of alternative opportunites to use<br/>
&quot;real&quot; materials.<br/>

&gt; computers, computers... thoughts<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are relatively new to the world of computers and world wiiiiiiide<br/>
&gt; web.  I noticed in my own first forays, which were in using the word<br/>
&gt; processor and a little networking, that my thought process was decidedly<br/>
&gt; different when I wrote on the computer than when I wrote with a pen.  My<br/>
&gt; fingers, although not rapid like a pro&#39;s are fairly fast because of<br/>
&gt; piano playing, so the words can actually slip out faster than what my<br/>
&gt; brain is accustomed to in my pen writing.  I found this both exciting<br/>
&gt; and disconcerting. I  noticed that sometimes it was just a little too<br/>
&gt; easy to type a lot of words without my usual contemplation, again which<br/>
&gt; could be either good or bad, I suppose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like words.  I started to think that perhaps the possibility of a glut<br/>
&gt; of meaningless words might actually obscure any truth there might be in<br/>
&gt; my communicating.  I&#39;ve  read some thoughtful writings from literary<br/>
&gt; figures who are wary of this same thing.  Many writers do their work in<br/>
&gt; long hand and then edit on the computer.  One well-respected and<br/>
&gt; seasoned fiction writer recently said that he could tell within the<br/>
&gt; first few paragraphs if a book was actually created on the computer or<br/>
&gt; written by hand, and has yet to be proven wrong.  He bemoans this new<br/>
&gt; ability we now have to spew out many words very fast, and the resulting<br/>
&gt; proliferation of not-very-well-written books.<br/>
&gt;      I have been thinking also about highschool teachers who only accept<br/>
&gt; assignments completed on computer word processing, graphics and other<br/>
&gt; programs.   When I heard about this and thought about it, I came to the<br/>
&gt; conclusion that I would probably do the opposite -- I would want to see<br/>
&gt; the physical manifestation, in all its awkwardness and/or flowing<br/>
&gt; beauty, of a student&#39;s thought process and creativity as written with a<br/>
&gt; pen or pencil, with drawings and lines on a piece of paper.  But maybe<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just old ...<br/>
&gt;      Yes, computers are a part of this reality now, and they are a<br/>
&gt; powerful tool.  I am wondering, though, about creativity and all those<br/>
&gt; zillions of  little spaces and thoughts and ideas that don&#39;t fit into<br/>
&gt; the paradigm of one program of another.  I know my daughter can be<br/>
&gt; creative with MSPaint, and I&#39;ve had fun with it too, but the creativity<br/>
&gt; is within extremely limited parameters.  Is it okay for a child to type<br/>
&gt; e-mail messages and stories on the computer if she doesn&#39;t want to learn<br/>
&gt; to write with a pen?   I don&#39;t know.  I know that we have spent less<br/>
&gt; time smelling tempura, getting our hands all mucky with clay, smearing<br/>
&gt; oil pastels and making our creative picture letters for friends and<br/>
&gt; family.  So I worry that forms of communicating and thinking and working<br/>
&gt; through things that don&#39;t lend themselves to digital electronics may be<br/>
&gt; used less and less.  Not a good thought.  But reveals the need for a<br/>
&gt; balance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess I am trying to be careful about this world of computers, while<br/>
&gt; at the same time appreciating the access it has given me to information<br/>
&gt; and worlds I otherwise wouldn&#39;t know about, etc.   I am hoping that the<br/>
&gt; computer world will evolve through the input of the most brilliantly<br/>
&gt; creative minds around -- probably unschoolers, who value diversity,<br/>
&gt; autonomy, process, and all the rest ...<br/>
