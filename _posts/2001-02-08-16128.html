&lt;&lt; I know that sounds awful, but it could be worse.  I&#39;ve read (online) of<br/>
 schools that  make the children be silent at lunch time.  Unbelievable!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Read online? It happened at my daughter&#39;s school as well as the school I <br/>
briefly taught at (although at that second school it was rarely enforceable). <br/>
It was a punishment for previous rowdy days. When I was in elementary school, <br/>
many years ago, we had a stop light on the cafeteria wall. Green = talk in <br/>
normal voices. Yellow = whisper. Red = silence.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing was, I loved it! <br/>

I have seen that as a policy in a school I visited.  Elementary---eat in <br/>
silence, wait for the others at your table to be through, all dismissed in <br/>
batches to go play.  Yuck.</div>

I doubt if you misread it. It&#39;s similar, in my mind, to the eliminatrion of <br/>
recess and even PE. The need to have this complete control over the behavior <br/>
of the kids, all in the name of education? competition? reducing stress on <br/>
staff?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670794155">When my son was in ps Kindergarten, he was given<br/>
detention 6 times for talking at lunch. He never<br/>
stayed after, I wouldnt allow my 5 year old to be<br/>
punnished like that, but I saw alot of kids in<br/>
detention for tiny infractions- running, talking, etc.<br/>
