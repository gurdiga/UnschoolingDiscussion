Hmmm...just checked and it&#39;s not on ours (even did a week-long search and it&#39;s not coming on within the next week).  We have Dishnetwork, so that&#39;s probably the difference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to get the DVD, anyway, to get the special features, to see how it was made.  That&#39;s what we kept asking eachother during the movie, &quot;How did they DO that??&quot;<br/>

Oh, I&#39;m sorry.  I could record it for you but it would just be vhs, not<br/>
nearly as nice as a DVD. <br/>
<br/>
I liked hearing about your sons interest in birds. (Happy Birthday Jake!)<br/>
 Dylan is very interested too and saved his money for nice binoculars.  <br/>
There is a WMA about thirty miles from us and we go there often.  There<br/>
was a colony of American White Pelicans there for the first time this<br/>
summer. There were reports of several new colonies in western Montana<br/>
this year.   I&#39;m glad we were so close to one. <br/>
<br/>
This valley we live in was contaminated by heavy metals from mine<br/>
tailings and fallout from copper smelting.   It&#39;s only been in the last<br/>
ten years or so, wildlife is returning here after extensive (and ongoing)<br/>
Superfund reclamation.   We can hike to the rookery and see fifteen Great<br/>
Blue Herons on the roost and Bald Eagles, Osprey and assorted shorebirds,<br/>
ducks and geese.   <br/>
<br/>
Dylan is a Magpie fan too.  We&#39;ve had a lot this year and their getting<br/>
bolder about being in town.  We watched one trying to break open some<br/>
walnuts we set out one day.  He picked one up and hopped along the tops<br/>
of the picket fence to the gate with a stone path beneath it.  He aimed<br/>
and dropped it, then flumped down to see if it had cracked open.  He did<br/>
that several times and when he couldn&#39;t get it open he took it to the<br/>
eave of the house and dropped it from there.  After awhile he&#39;d banged it<br/>
around enough to get it open.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see your post Anne, I loved reading your birding<br/>
adventures. <br/>

You, too, Deb...and I&#39;m imagining Jake and Dylan starting up some<br/>
unschooling bird-watching thing!<br/>
<br/>
Cool! <br/>
<br/>
Connections:  Among these posts about unschooling bird-watchers, I also<br/>
received my Bird Watcher&#39;s Digest newsletter!<br/>
<br/>
OH!  I was on our back deck yesterday, reading, and a female hummingbird<br/>
came within a foot of me, sucking the nectar out of my sad summer flowers..<br/>
I had taken down the feeders since I haven&#39;t see any hummers lately, but<br/>
after watching this amazing bird so close to me, I ran inside and filled one<br/>
up again!  They&#39;re much more enjoyable to observe when they are by<br/>
themselves and not being nasty defending their territory (it&#39;s the males<br/>
that are nasty to the females, though...the females are only nasty to each<br/>
other, not the males).<br/>
<br/>
One more special sight I wanted to share from our river...we saw an osprey<br/>
dive into the river and pick up a fish.  As it flew back up and gained<br/>
altitude, a bald eagle appeared and started attacking the osprey.  After a<br/>
few hits, the osprey dropped the fish, and the bald eagle swooped down and<br/>
caught it!  That osprey did his best to get his fish back, but the eagle won<br/>
the battle!  THAT was an incredible sight...and how fortunate we were to be<br/>
right there to be able to witness it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770477852">Oh, that is SO COOL! I&#39;ll never forget the time I watched a hawk <br/>
chasing down a falcon with something in its talons. It looked like <br/>
the hawk was gonna get the falcon...but he dropped whatever it was, <br/>
and the hawk swooped it out of the air and they parted. And another <br/>
time, hawks: two males, battling it out IN THE AIR, over territory, I <br/>
must assume. Or maybe over the female who was flying nearby. <br/>
Redtails, those were. They came so close to the ground in their <br/>
tussle, the loser nearly bought it. <br/>
<br/>
I love raptors. SO GLAD DDT was outlawed, so there was a chance for a <br/>
comeback for them.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>
