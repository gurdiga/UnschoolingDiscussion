&gt; when <br/>
&gt; I do it) or set ground rules early (which is hard when you don&#39;t have them <br/>
&gt; for your own and your kids might not understand) or limit the number of <br/>
&gt; children <br/>
&gt; at your house to a couple at a time (which seems to punish your own children <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; too).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I look forward to &quot;hearing&quot; creative ways others deal with this. Sometimes <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; still is a bit of an issue here, especially with DH, I just mostly raise my <br/>
&gt; eyebrows at them and it stops anymore trips to the cupboard or fridge or <br/>
&gt; freezer. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has been a problem here in the past. We have the &quot;neighborhood <br/>
pool&quot;---so we are the summer hang-out (besides, we&#39;re the &quot;cool&quot; parents). After one <br/>
HORRIBLE summer---five boys & two girls here from 9:00 am to dark two <br/>
snacks/day---and often lunch and supper---and VERY often overnight as well---we sent a <br/>
nice letter to all the parents. We explained how much we had spent the last <br/>
summer on snacks and drinks. We were one girl short (moved), so there were 6 <br/>
guests. They each were in charge of the snack and meals that day. They could have <br/>
the children show up there at their homes for scheduled lunches and suppers or <br/>
they could send it here in the mornings with the child.<br/>
<br/>
Worked out great.<br/>
