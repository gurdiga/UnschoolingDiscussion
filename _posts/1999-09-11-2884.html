<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598146007"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Then oldest daughter was typing and decided she wanted to learn proper<br/>
&gt;keyboard placement of her fingers - so I wrote her some exercises to start<br/>
&gt;off with.  We will see how that goes.  Anyone know of a good source for her<br/>
&gt;to use in this endeavor?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi there Laraine, <br/>
<br/>
We have used  ..All the Right Type...by Ingenuity Works (see<br/>
www.ingenuityworks.com)<br/>
You can order it from the US through...720 Olive Way, Suite 1020, Seattle,<br/>
WA 98101-3874 (there is also a Canadian addie if anyone needs it)<br/>
<br/>
It is a fun program. When they are teaching new finger placement...they<br/>
show the hands coming up on the screen keyboard and how to position fingers<br/>
...ie. for Q the little finger on the left hand keeps moving there on the<br/>
keyboard. <br/>
And there are games to play and etc. It is good for any age. ALso there is<br/>
a race down a river with a rower. The better and faster  you type the<br/>
faster  your rower goes. I get a kick out of that one!!<br/>
HAve fun, <br/>
Brooke <br/>

We use Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.  My 5 year old even uses it.  All my<br/>
kids (except the little guy) know proper placement of fingers now and<br/>
like the games you can play on Mavis Beacon.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are a BUNCHA typing programs out there.  Maybe there is a<br/>
web site with reviews of them all.  Now THAT is what I would like to<br/>
read -- a comparison of the many programs.<br/>

all splat on the floor in the grocery checkout program.<br/>

LOL.  I&#39;ve also got a five year old that&#39;s wired that way.  He loves the <br/>
unexpected and does everything backwards, just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
(OK, he wears underwear backwards because he wants the superhero picture to <br/>
be in the front.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-688524062">Looking for typing programs. . . I downloaded some freeware and trialware<br/>
from places such as (off the top of my head)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.softseek.com">http://www.softseek.com</a> and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.download.com">http://www.download.com</a><br/>
(may need to look under education titles, though it is probably listed<br/>
elsewhere too)  I tried a few on my 10/11 year olds (I already know typing<br/>
and don&#39;t know if I could&#39;ve learned this way) and they kinda like them.<br/>
Haven&#39;t returned many times to them yet. . . it&#39;s left to be seen if they<br/>
keep it up.<br/>
