<div id="ygrps-yiv-515194947">I am watching a news story on a professor at Harvard. He teaches students who <br/>
know to work with numbers and so on and shows them the world they may not <br/>

I love this guy! He says his kids get into Harvard by doing what the teachers <br/>
want rather than the teachers allowing them their own direction. <br/>
A good show if your on the time delay. It&#39;s on 7-8pm.<br/>

to be in real education, not just schooling!  JJ<br/>

Thanks for the tip.  I almost never watch 60 minutes but had to <br/>
watch tonight based on what you said.  I had never heard of him <br/>
before but I loved watching him.  :-)  He is just the kind of <br/>
teacher/professor who would have driven me nuts (then and probably <br/>
even now)!  Not to know exactly what was expected of me during class <br/>
and on tests?  Oh, what to do?!  I love that he&#39;s at Harvard, of all <br/>
places.  He might just broaden the horizons of some of his students.<br/>

P.S. My 2.5 year old found the arrow on the Fed Ex truck before I <br/>
did! </span></blockquote></div>
