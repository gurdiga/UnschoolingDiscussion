&lt;&lt; what is/was the point of diagramming sentences beyond the obvious grade for<br/>
the assignment/know it for the test thing?  Has *anybody* EVER used this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have, but then I never learned to diagram the REALLY crazed 35 word 19th <br/>
century sentences.  I know people used to.  <br/>
<br/>
The modern-day solution seems to be to have grammatical experts (editors) or <br/>
to just make shorter, simpler sentences.<br/>
<br/>
In a context in which long, complicated sentences are preferred, sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s possible to lose sight of what the subject was, and what tense and voice <br/>
it&#39;s all in, and a diagram is a way to splay it all out and find missing or <br/>
mis-matched parts.  It&#39;s &quot;showing all your work,&quot; grammatically.<br/>
<br/>
I think a large part of why it has fallen by the wayside is that it&#39;s only <br/>
useful to a very small percentage of people.   But in the interest of <br/>
discipline and conformity, the English school system was teaching Latin and <br/>
English.   With diagramming, they could show them in parallel.  It created a <br/>
kind of common denominator, or common base-system to analyze English grammar <br/>
in the same way they were Latin.<br/>
<br/>
Latin is what&#39;s known as a dead language.  It&#39;s fixed as it is, because it&#39;s <br/>
not spoken by any native speakers.  It&#39;s good to know for <br/>
historical/linguistic purposes (for people so inclined) and for those who <br/>
want to translate or read medieval legal texts, or pre-medieval historians, <br/>
or for those who need to work at the Vatican.  It was required of medical <br/>
students and pharmacists into the second part of the 20th century, mostly out <br/>
of tradition, and so that they could more readily understand the names of <br/>
medicines and body parts and procedures (although LOTS of those are in Greek <br/>
and not Latin, which points to the history of medical research and scientific <br/>
inquiry.  The reason given, though, which seems to me to be the least of the <br/>
purposes was because prescriptions were written in Latin.  It was partly the <br/>
medieval trades guild tradition, to keep their stuff arcane and to require <br/>
lots of hoop-jumping to get in.  It also enabled doctors to share their <br/>
research in Latin, but I think it&#39;s been a long time since researchers wrote <br/>
up their findings in Latin to share.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a snob-appeal, a class-protection, in England (and somewhat in the <br/>
U.S.) about &quot;having Latin.&quot;   Except for its uses in understanding <br/>
similarities in some European languages, though, it&#39;s a bit like the stars on <br/>
the first star-bellied sneetches, only it takes a lot of work and nobody is <br/>
born with it.  No native-speaker advantage for anybody.<br/>
<br/>
Dissecting English was traditionally required, because they were doing the <br/>
whole &quot;nominative case&quot; kind of lingo for so long (trying to make English fit <br/>
Latin&#39;s grammatical rules, and having specialized grammatical terms to baffle <br/>
the uninitiated--not the original purpose, but the ultimate result.<br/>
<br/>
If we totally reject the lingo and the analysis, then only a specialized few <br/>
will be able to polish language to a long-term, respectable, publishable <br/>
level.  But it&#39;s probably always been that way anyway, school just pretended <br/>
it was something everyone NEEDED to know.<br/>
<br/>
English, being a living language, changes and grows, and so attempts to <br/>
fossilize an early 19th century form failed.  It&#39;s called &quot;prescriptive <br/>
grammar,&quot; trying to solidify English and make it &quot;sit; stay.&quot;   The business <br/>
of charting the language as it exists and as it changes and describing what <br/>
native speakers DO say and write is &quot;descriptive grammar.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People with no special interest in the intricacies of language don&#39;t need to <br/>
diagram sentences any more than I need to dissect a horse and learn where all <br/>
the nerves and muscles are.  That&#39;s for veterinarians who plan to need to <br/>
know how to put a horse back together someday.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Latin is what&#39;s known as a dead language.  It&#39;s fixed as it is<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just as a little side note, it says in Uncle John&#39;s Bathroom Reader that the<br/>
Vatican actually added some new words to Latin and published an 18,000 word<br/>
dictionary in 1991, Lexicon Recentis Latinitas. (18,000 new words or 18,000<br/>
words total?) I&#39;m assuming these words were decided by committee rather than<br/>
actual use so new words don&#39;t make Latin any less dead.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s part of what Uncle John listed. Most of them are phrases cobbled<br/>
together from I assume existing Latin words, but there were a couple of what<br/>
I assume are new words.<br/>
<br/>
AIDS: syndrome comparati defectus immunitatis<br/>
<br/>
babysitter: infantaria<br/>
<br/>
carburetor: aeris benzinique mixtura (I can&#39;t imagine why the Vatican feels<br/>
a burning need to discuss carburetors in Latin)<br/>
<br/>
Christmas tree: arbor natalicia<br/>
<br/>
cellulite: cellulitis<br/>
<br/>
discotheque: orbium phonographicorum theca<br/>
<br/>
fax: exemplum simillime espressum<br/>
<br/>
hypnotherapy: hypnotherapia<br/>
