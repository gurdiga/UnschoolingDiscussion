<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767868775">Hi all...<br/>
<br/>
I took my boys (7 and 3) to the library today and remembered why I usually <br/>
leave them with their dad when I go pick out books.<br/>
<br/>
The older one found a chapter book and a &quot;Sports Illustrated for Kids&quot; and <br/>
started nagging to leave.<br/>
<br/>
The younger one tried to scoop up all the little Beatrix Potter books and <br/>
was dumping them everywhere. He threw a couple of them at me and they went <br/>
flying past my head to land in front of a startled library worker.<br/>
<br/>
Next he made a game of heading out the door by himself, sometimes with, <br/>
sometimes without a book yet to be checked out.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually he was careening around the library making high-pitched whining <br/>
noises and crashing into the chairs of people using the computers.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we were there more than 30 minutes. I did manage to get a <br/>
couple dozen books for us to read this week. But I was thinking back to my <br/>
own childhood, where my mom would go find her own books, and let me and my <br/>
brother loose in the children&#39;s section, which I recall enjoying!<br/>
<br/>
I know there are lots of bookworms on this list... hope your library visits <br/>
are more peaceful. Mine will be, since the guys are staying home next time!<br/>
<br/>
Annette<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396539118">I&#39;m new to the list.  Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Annette&#39;s post left me smiling and remembering many trips to the library<br/>
with my one and only son.  He was very busy, like her boys, and not really<br/>
interested in helping me select books, though he loved to be read to once<br/>
we got home.  It has only been in the last year (since he turned 10), that<br/>
library trips are relatively peaceful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986954890">What about not having a goal of gretting books but of working with <br/>
the kids in the Library? Can you take only one child at a time?  Then <br/>
instead of looking for books let them pick a few an read them there <br/>
to help them see the calm side of the library.<br/>
I know it took us a while before we could go with out it being nuts.  <br/>
Last week he got too hot and went to sit outside, he is only 5! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653171310">Annette, your kids sound like mine!  One library we go to has a large area <br/>
full of things for kids to do, and I really enjoy it, bc it does give me a <br/>
chance to look w/o worrying about my kids too much.  It is a small place, and <br/>
I always know where they are.  The other library we sometimes go to is <br/>
bigger, and has a smaller area for kids.  It is always difficult if we go <br/>
there, and I usually end up feeling embarrassed.  The next time your kids <br/>
have to go with you, you can think of me being red faced too :)  .  Let&#39;s <br/>
just keep in mind, with a little more time, and patience-- these kids will <br/>
grow up, and mature.  My boys are 5 and 3-- and the 3yo is truly the more <br/>
difficult of the two.  He is so fascinated with all of the computers the <br/>
library has, and wants to see how the copymachine works, then wants to push <br/>
the rolling step stool around...I know what you mean about leaving them with <br/>
Dad. :)  Keep your chin up, for this ,too, will pass!                           <br/>

Well, I thought you were describing us at the library -- a couple of years <br/>
ago.  It will get better.  But I think you have a great plan in the meantime <br/>
-- and what a neat excuse to get a break for yourself -- &quot;well, you know I <br/>
have to go to the library.&quot;  Think I might try that one even though I don&#39;t <br/>
need to!<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
