<br/>
Live Free Learn Free is a print magazine for relaxed homeschoolers <br/>
and unschoolers in which to share ideas, stories, and experiences. <br/>
All material is written by those who home educate - both parents and <br/>
children. It is an inclusive magazine, not only for and by <br/>
experienced homeschoolers, but also for and by those just starting <br/>
down the path. It embraces those who are radical in their <br/>
unschooling methods and those who are less so.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for parents and children involved in home education <br/>
to contribute material to the magazine. Live Free Learn Free strives <br/>
to bring home educating families together by publishing articles, <br/>
stories, poems, letters, reviews, and other items written by <br/>
home/unschooling parents and children.<br/>
<br/>
We prefer contributions written in the first- or third-person (I/we <br/>
or she/he/they) to those written in the second-person (you). <br/>
Submissions focused on the readers&#39; own experiences most closely <br/>
reflect the spirit of the magazine.  There is no requirement for <br/>
word length. Simply say what you have to say.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d like to receive, on an ongoing basis, articles or letters about <br/>
what works (or doesn&#39;t work) for you as home educators: lifestyle <br/>
choices (such as bedtimes, chores, meals, etc.), curriculum/non-<br/>
curriculum choices, resource reviews, etc., as well as glimpses into <br/>
the days and ways of an unschooling family. This is a recurring <br/>
section of the magazine. Tell us what it means to you to be an <br/>
unschooler. What obstacles have you encountered? What advantages <br/>
have you discovered? This area of the magazine has a very broad <br/>
focus, so tell us what&#39;s on your mind! For those who need a bit more <br/>
inspiration, here are a few topics we&#39;d like to cover in upcoming <br/>
issues:<br/>
