and I get uncomfortable when the temp rises above about 75F. And <br/>
I neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed snow.<br/>
Getting away from the traffic hell here and the Stepford mentality <br/>
would be a secondary benefit.<br/>
DH announced we need to spend another two years in the States <br/>
before I can go home. It seems such a long time :-(<br/>
