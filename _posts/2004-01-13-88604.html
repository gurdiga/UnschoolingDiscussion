<div id="ygrps-yiv-6294167">Was hoping to start a new discussion regarding The Continuum Concept, which <br/>
I am sure many of you have read.  I have been reading the posts here for a <br/>
week or so, and at first did not grasp the concept of &quot;unparenting&quot; (heh heh <br/>
I like that term now).  I DO understand unschooling, but had not considered <br/>
the fact that my children could indeed make their own choices with bedtimes, <br/>
food, etc., and end up not watching TV all day and eating sugar.  Well, <br/>
after a few days of reading, a little bell went off inside my head and I <br/>
realized that this IS the continuum concept in a industrialized society.  <br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;did&quot; the continuum concept with my children as babies, and have seen the <br/>
wonderful results.  Then, as they started to get older (they are 3 and 4 <br/>
now), I did not know how to incorporate the CC into our lives and decided <br/>
that it was impossible in our society.  Now after reading these posts, it <br/>
seems to me that unparenting/unschooling IS it.  I always remember in the CC <br/>
the part where the man did not force the boy to follow him into the woods to <br/>
go hunting (if I remember correctly), because if the boy did not WANT to <br/>
follow the man he would lose all sense of himself (I don&#39;t think I am <br/>
explaining myself well, but I hope you know what I am attempting to get at <br/>
here).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in these past few days I have taken off restrictions regarding TV, <br/>
food, and bedtimes.  These last few days have been the first time since my <br/>
children were babies that I felt like I was connected to them again and am <br/>
seeing them in that same CC way I used to when they were babies.  For awhile <br/>
I really felt like I had lost that connection where I could see them as <br/>
&quot;people&quot; and not just &quot;kids.&quot;  I also feel such a tremendous amount of <br/>
relief that I am not a &quot;bad&quot; parent because I don&#39;t make my kids eat some <br/>
allotted amount of vegetables or something.  Anyway, I will stop as I feel <br/>
like I am rambling, but I was hoping I will get some feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846361512">The hunting example made lots of sense to me. For my husband that example <br/>
alone was the beginning of his unschooling understanding rather than the &quot;because <br/>
I said so come on you&#39;ll have fun NOW&quot; mode.<br/>
<br/>
The ages of your children IMO are wonderful.  Around 3-4 was when my daughter <br/>
would have explored the &quot;testing me&quot; stage (she&#39;s 4.5).  We never really went <br/>
into that stage because she knew I wasn&#39;t standing with my shield saying NO.  <br/>
My oldest (now 12) did attend school for 2 years but I have always been <br/>
behind him 100% and he has always known he had first say if something was not ok <br/>
with him.  Oh coarse this just irritated his school as they had no manipulation <br/>
over him and were forced to be genuine. <br/>
<br/>
Just my babbling thoughts this evening.<br/>
<br/>
By the way I see their are several new to this list.<br/>
Welcome to the list.  I am Laura D from Maine and Mom to Dustin 12 , Cassidy <br/>
4.5 , Nicholas 20 mo and EDD of Zachary Tyler 5/03/04.<br/>

Just as a side note, I&#39;ve never read the word unparenting used in anyway<br/>
except disparagingly. We *are* parenting. We&#39;re just doing it more<br/>
respectfully :-)<br/>
<br/>
Though you might call it un-&quot;conventional parenting&quot;!<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Parenting&quot; as used by some people means &quot;kneejerk parenting,&quot; being <br/>
controlling without really looking at why, putting the rules and schedules ahead of <br/>
the children&#39;s realities.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re sharing here is mindful parenting, coming from awareness and <br/>
principles and compassion and joy.<br/>
