<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117057914">THanks...I plan to.  I did lay down for a bit and feel a bit better but I promise I&#39;ll try to keep my mouth shut on the serious issues until I get some serious sleep!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to put together a fitness/nutrition plan for me.  I have gained another 7 pounds in the last 2 weeks.  UGH!  I&#39;ve got to do something or I&#39;m going to morph.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m already swimming, but I want to add weight training (or yoga or pilates), and a nutrition plan.  So, I&#39;m looking stuff up.<br/>

&gt; You are one of the people I will probably burst into tears over when I see<br/>
&gt; you at the Conference. That&#39;s what I kept doing last year anyway.<br/>
&gt; So glad you&#39;re going to be there.<br/>
