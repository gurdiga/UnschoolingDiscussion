<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522323590">I have been doing A LOT of reading lately.  I&#39;m currently engrosed <br/>
in, &quot;Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow: Discovering Your Right <br/>
Livelihood,&quot; by Marsha Sinetar.  Obviously, maybe, I wasn&#39;t reading <br/>
this necessarily in the frame of mind relating to unschooling.  So, I <br/>
was pleasantly surprised when I came across this quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think it was a terrific blessing that I had no schooling.  What <br/>
happens to kids when they go to school?  All  those years under that <br/>
system, they lose their way once they go there.  The one thing I kept <br/>
hold of was my individuality.  I&#39;m an individual if there ever was <br/>
one.  There are many people like me...but there is no other me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought this worth sharing and definately think the book worth <br/>
reading, if you are interested.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m in grad school right now and my professor opened summer session by saying that <br/>
school (especially high school) robs kids of their identities and leaves them emotionally <br/>
and physically exhausted. He said he prefers &quot;C&quot; students. They usually have their own <br/>
interests, work harder, talk more in class and are more interested in life. &quot;A&quot; students are <br/>
afraid to take risks and only learn to store information in their short term memories. Often <br/>
they have no idea what they want to do after college, can&#39;t identify interests and end up in <br/>
lower paying jobs. <br/>
