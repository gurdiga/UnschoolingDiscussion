<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570427980">Well my oldest&#39;s boyfriend has a place of his own. So you know what that means now. Not spending all their time here like they use to. Her car will hopefully be ready in another month or less so you know what that means to!<br/>
<br/>
I must say I&#39;m having some feelings about all this. Not sure what it is or why. I&#39;m not worried about Tara. I&#39;m not concerned about the playing house thing. Well not sure if that&#39;s the right word. It is bothering me some. I think it&#39;s just the fact that this is another stage in her growing up, or maybe growing out? Tara knows I&#39;m a little apprehensive about it. She said she would stay home if I didn&#39;t want her to go. I&#39;m not going to do that. I kind of feel bad about talking to her because she knows how I feel now. So as much as she wants to go, she also wants to stay but I think only because she thinks I want her to. Is all this making sense?<br/>
<br/>
I just want some reassuring words that I will get through this. I guess I just wasn&#39;t ready for the steady house play so soon. At least I think that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong.<br/>

  I&#39;m probably being dense, Mary, but is she going to move in with him <br/>
or you&#39;re just thinking that they&#39;ll have a whole lot of privacy now <br/>
that they didn&#39;t have before or ??<br/>

Oh heavens I&#39;m sorry. I feel like you guys know Tara and I don&#39;t have to<br/>
explain much!! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not figuring she&#39;ll leave home or dump school or her job or anything<br/>
like that. Just that she&#39;ll have so  much more ability to leave and hang out<br/>
away from home. Tara&#39;s always been one to hang here and have her friends<br/>
here. So her being gone is what will be different. I guess it&#39;s not really<br/>
the whole lot of privacy thing that bothers me. I mean she&#39;s gone to GA with<br/>
him before and I was okay with that. I think it&#39;s just the whole growing up<br/>
playing house more frequently deal that has me feeling a bit, I don&#39;t know,<br/>
maybe old??!! This is my first one growing up and even though she hasn&#39;t<br/>
gone anywhere, I&#39;m feeling some pangs here of something.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I can SO relate, Mary. My oldest is 18 - she has a serious boyfriend<br/>
who is 23 (also an unschooler, by the way). She drove the 900 miles up<br/>
to Oregon where she&#39;s been for the past week and a half - seems like<br/>
MONTHS.  She&#39;ll be home Friday. I miss her. But she&#39;ll be leaving again<br/>
toward the end of the summer and will be traveling all over the<br/>
country, including staying at her boyfriend&#39;s apartment in another<br/>
state. I&#39;m right there with you -- first-born kid growing up - it can<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh Pam, you can understand. Now I feel bad for you!! Thankfully Tara gets<br/>
really homesick so she won&#39;t be travelling anytime in the near future. I<br/>
think I would be a wreck. Then again, if the child is living and loving it,<br/>
we&#39;ve really done our job haven&#39;t we??? Sounds like you raised one great<br/>
confident kid there.<br/>
