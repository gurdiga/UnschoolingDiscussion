<div id="ygrps-yiv-674799779">My husband has had good results helping some of his clients to give up coffee by slowly switching to a coffee substitute. So, instead of 2 cups of coffee a day, you take a cup with half coffee/half herbal coffee, then one cup of coffee and one of Teecjino, and so on.  Our favorite is called Teechino and it&#39;s pretty yummy with milk and a little sugar. You can find it at the health food stores.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you are on the right constitutional remedy (as you probably are), your addictions will go away in time. The tricky part with coffee in particular is that it can easily counteract homeopathy, but your homeopath can assess that.<br/>

Yankee Candles has a really good smelling candle called Hazlenut <br/>
coffee.  Maybe if it&#39;s the smell you love you could just light the <br/>
candle in the mornings?  <br/>
<br/>
I can stay away from coffee, although I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to <br/>
turn down a good cup of swiss mocha cappachino.  What I&#39;m addicted to <br/>
is chocolate and coke.  I just don&#39;t understand how someone could <br/>
have a bag of anything chocolate in their house and not have it eaten <br/>
in a day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405854580">I know there is a way, I just don&#39;t want to :-)<br/>
<br/>
I love the taste, the smell, the consistency, the everything of a <br/>
good cup of coffee. I will not drink just anything. No road-kill <br/>
coffee for me --you know the kind that sits in the burner for hours <br/>
at a time, YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
I did a &#39;detox&#39; for about three weeks  ---stopped dairy, wheat, eggs, <br/>
coffee, sugar, refined starches. Yikes! The migraine was brutal. The <br/>
one thing I missed was my morning cup of coffee. I do not do wheat, <br/>
eggs and cow products because they make me ill but that coffee with <br/>
my powdered goat milk, that is sacred!  Actually, if I do not have my <br/>
powdered goat milk, I just go without.  So I know I can go without <br/>
but, do I really want to? Nah!<br/>
