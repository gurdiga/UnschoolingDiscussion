<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618720702">As I was reading everyone&#39;s posts on growing up I was reminded of something <br/>
my almost six year old daughter said a couple of days ago.  I was folding <br/>
laundry and Lily my dd was sitting quietly nearby.  She suddenly looked up at <br/>
me with tears in her eyes and said  &quot;I think I&#39;m growing up too fast, Mama&quot;.  <br/>
I told her that she is growing up, but there&#39;s still a lot of time left for <br/>
her to be a little girl.  She said &quot;when exactly will I be full grown&quot;?  <br/>
&quot;Full grown&quot; was such a funny way to say it, and for a moment I almost <br/>
laughed aloud.  I managed to supress my laughter, only to find my own eyes <br/>
filling with tears.  Tears for what?  I guess for the reminder that Lily WILL <br/>
grow up - all my babies will -  and that childhood is really too short.  <br/>
Before Lily walked off that day she said &quot;I don&#39;t want to grow up&quot;.  I said <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want you to either, baby&quot;.  Then in all her six year old wisdom she <br/>
said &quot;so, I won&#39;t&quot;!  And that was that.  Good enough for me.<br/>
