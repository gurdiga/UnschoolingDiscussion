<div id="ygrps-yiv-844849846"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;However, I do think it is helpful, in this world of words typed on a <br/>
&gt;&gt;screen, to use words such as &quot;special needs&quot;, because otherwise we would <br/>
&gt;&gt;have to type out some lengthy description/disclaimer each time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how I&#39;ve always approached it too. But these last few days have made <br/>
me re-evaluate that thought. When I use the old special needs tag I&#39;m <br/>
thinking of kids with behaviors. Those who are extreme or quirky or <br/>
sensitive. The kinds who would indeed receive those nebulous alphabet soup <br/>
labels in school. What I wan&#39;t considering were those dear kids who have <br/>
absolute physical needs that are so different. Kids with seizures or down <br/>
syndrome or FAS.<br/>
<br/>
I still believe in my absolute truth that trusting and understanding these <br/>
kids is the path to take. I believe that schools and regimentation and <br/>
absolutes are harmful to any being&#39;s psyche. But I wonder if I should know <br/>
more about these kids physical limitations before I answer so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I think *my* truth can be shared and fit into each child&#39;s <br/>
puzzle of a world and used however it will fit.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now I&#39;m rambling. ;-) Just thinking out loud.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I do have faith that what I am doing is the right way to help my kids each <br/>
&gt;&gt;keep and explore their own unique way of being in this world, but it still <br/>
&gt;&gt;helps to hear from the other end of the age spectrum that yes, this is <br/>
&gt;&gt;true.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this  *is* tue. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
