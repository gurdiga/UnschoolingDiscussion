<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954512298">ok i&#39;ve got to throw in my 2cents. (why isn&#39;t there a cents sign on the<br/>
keyboard!!??)<br/>
i complain cause my dh likes to stay up late!!<br/>
if i had it my way, i would stay up late and get up early.<br/>
but i enjoy my bed to much, and my sleep.<br/>
maybe when i&#39;m old, seems like older people don&#39;t need as much sleep or<br/>
rhtey just have insomnia.<br/>
my dh likes to stay up and &#39;unwind&#39; even when he has to get up real<br/>
early. and i&#39;m sayin&#39;honey you need to get some sleep.<br/>
anyway.....<br/>
Deborah, who would like to join the ranks of nite owls but would also<br/>
catch the early worm and doesn&#39;t do either one!</div>

I think I heard the same study, on the evening news awhile back.  There was <br/>
even one high school in Minn? that was pushing back the school start time <br/>
because of this.  I think they only pushed it back to 9:30am, but at least <br/>
they moved it in the right direction for tired teens.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My teenager entered puberty at 11ish. She slept more between 11-13 than she<br/>
ever did as an infant.  She also went through 4 whole shoe sizes. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Now, she&#39;s always been a night owl.  She never ever sleeps before 1 am.<br/>
These days she&#39;s living an enviable life.  She left one of her jobs, which<br/>
left her with just teaching karate for a few hours each week.   That&#39;s gas<br/>
and insurance money, but that&#39;s about it.  She has a very large circle of<br/>
friends and she spends more time away from home than here.   All of her<br/>
friends seem to stay up until 3amish, sleep till noonish, work in the<br/>
afternoon to early evening, then hang together until 3 again.   Her schedule<br/>
would kill me. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I bet you could tie the *dropout* rate to kids who just do not function well<br/>
early in the morning.  I do remember there being an article in Psychology<br/>
Today about teens and the need to begin classes later. The article is at<br/>
least 4 years old.<br/>

There&#39;s a High School in Washington state that was set up after the study was <br/>
done.  They kids begin school at like 2 or 3 pm and finish at 8 pm.  It&#39;s <br/>
really great for the night owls and has tons of one on one instruction.  New <br/>
