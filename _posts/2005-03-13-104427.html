<div id="ygrps-yiv-398465020">This evening I was reading over the  standardized test that I will be giving my 10 year old daughter as per state requirements.... and one of the questions asked what country Tokyo was in. I said to my husband - I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll know that one. So later he asked &quot;hey Brianna, what country is Tokyo in?&quot; and her answer had the tone of &quot;duh&quot; &quot;Japan. I learned that from Gilligan&#39;s Island.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love it!<br/>

That is cool.  I&#39;ve had a similar thing happen when my daughter and I <br/>
played the Which Way USA boardgame (which isn&#39;t as fun as the Top <br/>
Secret Adventures board game, lol).  There are a lot of trivia <br/>
questions in it and I was surprised at how many she knew.  A LOT of <br/>
them she knew because of things she&#39;d seen on tv.  <br/>

I added this to the Gilligan&#39;s Island Collection, which had another cool  <br/>
addition recently.  One of the interviewees in a book about why people  became <br/>
scientists had a Gilligan&#39;s Island riff, and gave me permission to quote  it <br/>
there.  Anne Ohman was the one who was reading the book and found  it.  Check <br/>
that out!<br/>

And Heather, I bet that might&#39;ve been the episode where the WWII pilot  was <br/>
downed there and didn&#39;t know the war was over, and told Ginger she was  <br/>
&quot;goo&#39;rooking.&quot;  If so, I mention that one in my Gilligan bit (also on that  page).<br/>
 <br/>
COOL!<br/>
