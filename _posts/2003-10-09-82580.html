<div id="ygrps-yiv-461159309">**and perennial favorite, Max and<br/>
Ruby (Nick Jr.) which I really do not like much and am constantly<br/>
subverting with my remarks about why I don&#39;t like Ruby&#39;s behavior.**<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen the cartoon, but Max and Ruby are the protagonists in <br/>
several books by Rosemary Wells.  We had some of her toddler books, like <br/>
Max&#39;s Bath, and loved them very much.  (Maybe I&#39;m too much like Ruby. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; in all her bossy glory.)<br/>
