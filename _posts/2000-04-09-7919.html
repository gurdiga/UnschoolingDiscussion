discussion going on at the moment as to whether &#39;corrupt&#39; american spellings<br/>
should be accepted in schools and in national examinations. The reason this has<br/>
arisen is because, so they say, kids are being exposed to the &#39;corrupt&#39; spellings<br/>
through spending so much time on the internet!<br/>
<br/>
So keep on spelling it &#39;colour&#39; Bridget - so Michelle and Brooke and I can see<br/>
the corruption working in reverse!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246790176">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;lol... now *that* writing looks like my child#2&#39;s<br/>
attempts at written communication! yikes...Which is<br/>
why I&#39;m convinced that, much as we&#39;d like to hope,<br/>
spell checkers and calculators can&#39;t do it all. There<br/>
are some basic skills that are helpful in knowing<br/>
(spelling, adding & subtracting) to name a few. My<br/>
oldest was &#39;taught&#39; these things by me. My youngest<br/>
has not been. Which child is doing better overall<br/>
(emotionally, academically)... the one taught the very<br/>
basics. And I say this with sadness because I consider<br/>
myself a rabid supporter of unschooling and follower<br/>
of John Holt. I wonder if we&#39;re missing the boat<br/>
sometimes by taking his words to the extreme. I wonder<br/>
if that&#39;s what he really meant.I don&#39;t know.....<br/>
Sarah&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

There are so many factors in life that could count for<br/>
the differences between your children. Even if you<br/>
parent your children in exactly the same way the<br/>
differences in their personalities makes them<br/>
*perceive* the parenting differently. Their brains are<br/>
different and work differently. You may have found<br/>
that if you had done the exact same thing with both of<br/>
them that nothing would be different now. I suppose<br/>
it&#39;s a question that we&#39;ll never know the answer to.<br/>
Also what do you mean by &quot;doing better&quot;? In what way?<br/>
Maybe the one who isn&#39;t &#39;doing as well&#39; is better at<br/>
other less academic things, does that make those<br/>
activities less valuable? And maybe he&#39;ll come into<br/>
his own academically as he matures. I think we are so<br/>
conditioned as a society to think that academics are<br/>
the be all and end all of education that we forget<br/>
about the myriad of other possibilities. I firmly<br/>
believe that a child  will get the &#39;basics&#39; he needs<br/>
all on his own as they become relative to his<br/>
interests. Trusting in the process is the hardest<br/>
part. And I should know because I regularly go through<br/>
periods of doubt and uncertainty. Oh good! I guess<br/>
that means I&#39;m normal and healthy?! :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (emotionally, academically)... the one taught the very<br/>

with one other?  <br/>
If you&#39;re ready to believe that learning is a natural process, like<br/>
growing, then you must realize that the process happens at a different<br/>
rate and time for everyone.  <br/>
All people do not learn, or need to learn, *all* the same things at the<br/>
same time or rate.<br/>
The problem is not in the child, but in the comparing of one individual<br/>
to another.<br/>
Being compared *academically* to a sibling who is perceived by everyone<br/>
as *doing better*  would have emotional consequences.  <br/>

By &quot;doing better&quot; I mean socially, academically, emotionally, physically, ...... you name it. One has to wonder if she would hold a better self image if she had also gotten the basics to begin with rather than being nearly 11 and still struggling to read, unable to do math *whatsoever* and have not a single friend because she doesn&#39;t know how to socially interact with kids her own age.  I know that&#39;s something I couldn&#39;t teach her but I *could have* taught her how to tell time, count to 100, etc so she wouldn&#39;t be embarrassed to *be* around other kids her age.  Kids are cruel and the ones who know these things often times make fun of the kids who don&#39;t. I remember hearing the neighbor kid comment, &quot;you mean you *cant* tell *time* yet?!!&quot;  <br/>
By giving her the basics I could have avoided situations like that and imo she wouldn&#39;t be the insecure kid she is today.<br/>

stated that she doesn&#39;t know how to do these things and it bothers her? If<br/>

teach) the concepts to her? again if so, is she not understanding them at<br/>
all? and then again if so, maybe that would be the time to find outside<br/>
resources to help her learn these concepts.<br/>
If she has never expressed an interest in learning these things, maybe she<br/>
is developmentally unready to learn these concepts and might need some extra<br/>
reassurance that this is OK and she will have materials available to her<br/>
when she is ready to learn them.<br/>
Another thought I had was that my dd spends the majority of her time with<br/>
other home/unschooled kids who are much more understanding of learning<br/>
differences and pace. From them she receives validation that she is<br/>
progressing at her own pace rather than in comparison to others her age.<br/>
Maybe getting your DD more involved with other homeschooled kids on a<br/>
regular basis would help against the hurt of neighborhood kids.<br/>
Maybe she would be more comfortable in a group of mixed age or kids younger<br/>
than herself. that may allow her a little more leeway in the social<br/>
development. area.<br/>

  Yes, she has... crying... often.<br/>
<br/>

  so, then have you sat down and explained (I like this word better than<br/>

<br/>

  She gets sooo frustrated and when she goofs up *one* time, she angrily storms away.  I&#39;ve tried a million different approaches. I&#39;ve talked with a psychologist/friend and she feels dd could use some counseling.  We have not taken that step yet, though.  I&#39;m just now (after a few months) able to get her to even entertain the idea of seeing outside help from the medical community.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe getting your DD more involved with other homeschooled kids on a<br/>

  Maybe she would be more comfortable in a group of mixed age or kids younger<br/>

  development. area.<br/>
<br/>
  Good suggestions and we did try them. One of the kids gave her some grief over not being able to read yet and that was the end of that. :( She refused to go back to the park days.... said she hated them and never liked going in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
  As to &quot;doing better&quot; - I have to ask than whom? than her sister who is a<br/>

<br/>
  Yes, I know but then, do you *ever* step in and *do* something? I mean, hind-sight is 20/20. If I had *known* that this child would have such problems now because of not learning this stuff whenever she felt like it, I&#39;d have done something about it sooner. I would have pushed a little. But I didn&#39;t ... I did the very unschooling &quot;let her do it when she&#39;s ready.. leave her alone&quot; thing and now, I&#39;m not so sure it was the *right* thing to do for *THIS* child. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>on <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is really true. I remember onnce when a friend of Cacie&#39;s<br/>
who was 15 at the time asked how to spell a word that Cacie knew how to<br/>
spell (and spelling is not her strong suit). He was okay with it, she<br/>
didn&#39;t think less of him (although she was proud that she could help him)<br/>
and nobody thought less of him. She has friends who are 9 and 10 who are<br/>
just learning to read and write, and friends who are 9 who are just<br/>
learning to calculate simple arithmetic problems. It just doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
matter. When she&#39;s with schooled kids, it&#39;s usually during soccer or<br/>
drama, and she&#39;s pretty good at both of those things (she has a lot more<br/>
time to practice :-) and the times that her writing and spelling have<br/>
come up during dramam class - no one has ever mentioned them to her, but<br/>
she has felt self-conscious - it has become quickly apparent that her<br/>
acting skills are what really matters in that setting.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah, you&#39;ve said that your duaghter can&#39;t tell time or count to 100 and<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any friends. I don&#39;t think most of Cacie&#39;s friends know<br/>
whether she can do those things or not - no one has ever asked.  In other<br/>
words, I&#39;m not sure having friends around her age  (and I&#39;m assuming that<br/>
you don&#39;t mean exactly her age, but within  few years) has anything to do<br/>
with those skills. Learning how to get along with other kids requires a<br/>
unique set of social skills, and I think that as unschooling parents, we<br/>
can help our kids learn them when they clearly seem to want to. It&#39;s<br/>
harder, because they&#39;re really more unwritten, but when we moved here a<br/>
few months ago I watched as Cacie came to a big park day full of kids and<br/>
really used some pretty sophisticated skills to hook up with some other<br/>
kids. It looked pretty random but she clearly had a strategy when you<br/>
watched closely... I was impressed, and it&#39;s something I couldn&#39;t have<br/>
done at her age.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I was wondering about is what has your daughter been<br/>
doing for the past 10 years, then. You&#39;ve talked about what she can&#39;t do,<br/>
but what she can she do? For a while, my brother was quizzing Cacie on<br/>
spelling and stuff every time he saw her, so we talked about what she did<br/>
know and worked out a plan, so when he asked her how to spell some word,<br/>
she asked him the name of Odysseus&#39; son. :-) It worked like a charm...<br/>
and my brother is a pretty nice guy, clueless but nice, so he pretty<br/>
cheerfully admitted that he didn&#39;t know and that was about the end of<br/>
quizzing.<br/>

DD can sing her heart out and dance like crazy. She is wonderful with animals (we now have seven). She&#39;s a natural when it comes to style (she&#39;s got looong legs so I can even see her modeling one day). <br/>
So for the last 10 years she&#39;s been singing and dancing and putting on performances for me and her Dad. She&#39;s been playing with the animals as if they were her playmates (they never criticize).<br/>

education is based on &#39;linear&#39; thinking so only some people excel.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your child needs to learn differently? Most of us learn by a <br/>
combination of two or three ways of seeing the world. (Physical, Musical, <br/>
Graphical etc.)<br/>
And if she is very creative, MOST likely she won&#39;t be a great linear <br/>
learner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696648329">Elissa and Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
I think I understand what you are both trying to say.  AND I think I<br/>
agree with both of you.  Yes, in a perfect world a child should not have<br/>
to be pushed into learning.  But, we don&#39;t live in a perfect world.  It<br/>
sounds to as if the 11 year old in question needs a little push to help<br/>
her believe she can do it.  My son is nearly ten an he is just now<br/>
learning to read.  He only very recently learned to tell time on an<br/>
analog clock.  Six months ago he truly believed he could not do it -<br/>
either thing.  My mother convinced him otherwise.  He needed her to<br/>
believe in him enough to make him believe too.  She did that by never<br/>
giving up.  She lives next door and he goes there for a few hours a day. <br/>
She worked with him and helped him learn.  <br/>
Now she helps the older two with math at their asking - they both want to<br/>
take the ACT in February.  <br/>
But the thing about individuality is that Wyndham would never have been<br/>
able to ask for help.  He didn&#39;t understand that help was possible.  And<br/>
I think that was partly the effect of his sister&#39;s never needing any help<br/>
with stuff like that.  He saw them learning everything by themselves and<br/>
thought he should be able to and since he couldn&#39;t it was his problem.<br/>
But that&#39;s what should be the good thing about unschooling . . . we are<br/>
free to figure out for ourselves what our children need.  Two of mine<br/>
don&#39;t need encouragement to learn, the third did.  <br/>
And the original thought on this thread was that there are some &quot;basics&quot;<br/>
that all should know.  Maybe that should say most should know?  I do<br/>
think that nearly every child needs to learn (eventually)  to read and<br/>
maybe do some basic math - adding and subtracting.  I think most will<br/>
learn with no trouble and little help.  Beyond that, I don&#39;t think there<br/>
is any &#39;core&#39; knowledge that everyone needs.  I don&#39;t need to know what a<br/>
logarhythm is and my dh does not need to know what a past participle is.<br/>

&gt; &gt;By &quot;doing better&quot; I mean socially, academically, emotionally, <br/>
&gt; physically,<br/>
&gt; ...... you name it. One has to wonder if she would hold a better <br/>
&gt; self image<br/>
&gt; if she had also gotten the basics to begin with rather than being <br/>
&gt; nearly 11<br/>
&gt; and still struggling to read, unable to do math *whatsoever* and <br/>
&gt; have not a<br/>
&gt; single friend because she doesn&#39;t know how to socially interact with <br/>
&gt; kids<br/>
&gt; her own age.  I know that&#39;s something I couldn&#39;t teach her but I <br/>
&gt; *could<br/>
&gt; have* taught her how to tell time, count to 100, etc so she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; embarrassed to *be* around other kids her age.  Kids are cruel and <br/>
&gt; the ones<br/>
&gt; who know these things often times make fun of the kids who don&#39;t. I <br/>
&gt; remember<br/>
&gt; hearing the neighbor kid comment, &quot;you mean you *cant* tell *time* <br/>
&gt; yet?!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;By giving her the basics I could have avoided situations like that <br/>
&gt; and imo<br/>
&gt; she wouldn&#39;t be the insecure kid she is today.<br/>
&gt; &gt;jmo<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sarah<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; In reading the above, a thought struck me. Has she ever come to you <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; stated that she doesn&#39;t know how to do these things and it bothers <br/>
&gt; her? If<br/>
&gt; so, then have you sat down and explained (I like this word better <br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; teach) the concepts to her? again if so, is she not understanding <br/>
&gt; them at<br/>
&gt; all? and then again if so, maybe that would be the time to find <br/>
&gt; outside<br/>
&gt; resources to help her learn these concepts.<br/>
&gt; If she has never expressed an interest in learning these things, <br/>
&gt; maybe she<br/>
&gt; is developmentally unready to learn these concepts and might need <br/>
&gt; some extra<br/>
&gt; reassurance that this is OK and she will have materials available to <br/>
&gt; her<br/>
&gt; when she is ready to learn them.<br/>
&gt; Another thought I had was that my dd spends the majority of her time <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; other home/unschooled kids who are much more understanding of <br/>
&gt; learning<br/>
&gt; differences and pace. From them she receives validation that she is<br/>
&gt; progressing at her own pace rather than in comparison to others her <br/>
&gt; age.<br/>
&gt; Maybe getting your DD more involved with other homeschooled kids on <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; regular basis would help against the hurt of neighborhood kids.<br/>
&gt; Maybe she would be more comfortable in a group of mixed age or kids <br/>
&gt; younger<br/>
&gt; than herself. that may allow her a little more leeway in the social<br/>
&gt; development. area.<br/>
&gt; As to &quot;doing better&quot; - I have to ask than whom? than her sister who <br/>
&gt; is a<br/>
&gt; different age (and person)? Than mass-schooled kids who are held to<br/>
&gt; ridiculous standards, than who? I am learning in my unschooling <br/>
&gt; journey that<br/>
&gt; it is not always the fastest, strongest, cleverest, most outgoing,<br/>
&gt; articulate, highest test scorers that are the most &quot;successful&quot;. I <br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; learning to change my definition of success, my notions of how <br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt; learn and grow. It is a difficult journey, more so for us (the <br/>
&gt; parents) than<br/>
&gt; for the child. We have many years of mass-schooling ideas in our <br/>
&gt; heads with<br/>
&gt; which we have to come to terms. We truly are the ones who have to <br/>
&gt; learn to<br/>
&gt; &quot;think outside the box&quot;. Our kids just have to be themselves  - we <br/>
&gt; are the<br/>
&gt; ones who have to get  out of the way!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-305734303">Ya know, she might be like son #3.  He has a real low tolerance, o.k., so no<br/>
tolerance at all, for learning.  He has to know thing instantly and I don&#39;t<br/>
mean in a short period of time, I mean in nano-seconds!<br/>
<br/>
So, he loves math.  He &quot;got&quot; math instantly.  he loves sports.  He &quot;got&quot;<br/>
sports instantly, all the rules, all the moves, everything.  He likes<br/>
science because it didn&#39;t take much effort on his part to &quot;get&quot; the<br/>
theories.<br/>
<br/>
But he HATES reading because he couldn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; all the principles without<br/>
having to sit still and actually work at it.<br/>
<br/>
It is just the way he is built.  No sense agonizing over it, we just go with<br/>
the flow.  It is the same with his current job.  He will be the first person<br/>
to be a supervisor under the age of 18 since this business was established<br/>
in the 50s.  He was born with people skills, so people love being around him<br/>
and that has gotten him two employee of the month awards in less than 9<br/>
months.  Again something that has never happened in the past.  He is rarely<br/>
frustrated by out of control customers.<br/>
<br/>
But in learning areas his frustration level is in the basement.  Don&#39;t ask,<br/>
I haven&#39;t been able to figure out the logic here either &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, my suggestion would be to use the music angle.  If she is like son #3,<br/>
if the foundation you work from is something that is something they really<br/>
want or enjoy, then the rest will follow.  For example, rythm is math.<br/>
Learning temp calls for counting.  Beat calls for learning fractions.<br/>
Learning to read music (not lyrics) would progress to reading the lyrics<br/>
which would further the reading and writing goal.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and maybe she is an auditory learner???  There are CDs (both to play on<br/>
a CD player and for the computer) for learning music.  Maybe that is an<br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
Am I clear as mud as usual???<br/>

&gt; Thanks for your post, Elissa. I&#39;ll section it out to respond:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   In reading the above, a thought struck me. Has she ever come to you and<br/>
&gt;   stated that she doesn&#39;t know how to do these things and it bothers her?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Yes, she has... crying... often.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If<br/>
&gt;   so, then have you sat down and explained (I like this word better than<br/>
&gt;   teach) the concepts to her?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Yes, more than once... lots of times.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    again if so, is she not understanding them at<br/>
&gt;   all? and then again if so, maybe that would be the time to find outside<br/>
&gt;   resources to help her learn these concepts.<br/>
&gt;   She gets sooo frustrated and when she goofs up *one* time, she angrily<br/>
storms away.  I&#39;ve tried a million different approaches. I&#39;ve talked with a<br/>
psychologist/friend and she feels dd could use some counseling.  We have not<br/>
taken that step yet, though.  I&#39;m just now (after a few months) able to get<br/>
her to even entertain the idea of seeing outside help from the medical<br/>
community.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Maybe getting your DD more involved with other homeschooled kids on a<br/>
&gt;   regular basis would help against the hurt of neighborhood kids.<br/>
&gt;   Maybe she would be more comfortable in a group of mixed age or kids<br/>
younger<br/>
&gt;   than herself. that may allow her a little more leeway in the social<br/>
&gt;   development. area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Good suggestions and we did try them. One of the kids gave her some<br/>
grief over not being able to read yet and that was the end of that. :( She<br/>
refused to go back to the park days.... said she hated them and never liked<br/>
going in the first place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   As to &quot;doing better&quot; - I have to ask than whom? than her sister who is a<br/>
&gt;   different age (and person)? Than mass-schooled kids who are held to<br/>
&gt;   ridiculous standards, than who? I am learning in my unschooling journey<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Yes, I know but then, do you *ever* step in and *do* something? I mean,<br/>
hind-sight is 20/20. If I had *known* that this child would have such<br/>
problems now because of not learning this stuff whenever she felt like it,<br/>
I&#39;d have done something about it sooner. I would have pushed a little. But I<br/>
didn&#39;t ... I did the very unschooling &quot;let her do it when she&#39;s ready..<br/>
leave her alone&quot; thing and now, I&#39;m not so sure it was the *right* thing to<br/>
do for *THIS* child.<br/>
&gt;   ~~~OR~~~~<br/>
&gt;   will all of this experience lead her *to* her dreams of being a rock<br/>
star????????<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Yes, I know but then, do you *ever* step in and *do* something?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course! If my child is in immediate danger than I would step in. If she<br/>
can&#39;t read at 11 (and my dd may not) then I would look, listen adn discuss<br/>
some possible reasons, I would check if she has any physical reasons for not<br/>
reading, I would probably then a.) take her to a specialist for a physical<br/>
or emotional  problem or b.) relax. Children do things in their own time. I<br/>
would take that as a mantra and repeat it constantly.<br/>
  I mean, hind-sight is 20/20. If I had *known* that this child would have<br/>
such problems now because of not learning this stuff whenever she felt like<br/>
it, I&#39;d have done something about it sooner. I would have pushed a little.<br/>

****IMPO, I think unschooling IS right for every child. Because IMPO, it is<br/>
facillitating my child&#39;s desire to learn. It is not a method of<br/>
homeschooling. It is not even to me an educational philosophy, it is a<br/>
lifestyle philosophy.<br/>
My suggestion about all this is to do just a few things.<br/>
1. Have her see a therapist that SHE likes and is willing to talk to. Who<br/>
cares if you consult with 10, sometimes it takes a while to find the right<br/>
one.<br/>
2. Suggest to her that she may enjoy learning some of these basic skills<br/>
from someone outside of the family, an older HSer, a college student or<br/>
beloved family friend.<br/>
3. Try some smaller HS activities<br/>
4. (and most important) BREATHE. She&#39;s only 11 and she&#39;s only &quot;behind&quot; if<br/>
she is viewed that way by those who love her and have her best welfare at<br/>
heart. Keep on telling her that she WILL get this stuff one day, it may take<br/>
some creativity but you will help and support her and give her as much time<br/>
as she needs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a very similar situation with my daughter who is 12. . . turns out she <br/>
needs help in those areas from other people. . . she and I just clash in <br/>
those situations (I guess mainly math at this point). I take responsibility <br/>
for the situation because of not being clear myself when we first started <br/>
&quot;school&quot;. She does fine with other people explaining things, except when it <br/>
is a person who doesn&#39;t have the amount of patience she needs. So we have <br/>
found other people where she can get what she needs when she wants it.<br/>

has wanted to be a singer, and actually has the talent to do it. We have at <br/>
times dragged our feet, because she was so young, and wanting to be in &quot;show <br/>
business&quot;, feeling it was passing her by. As time goes on, her voice gets <br/>
better and better, to where she brings people to tears when she sings. She <br/>
had backed off on it a bit. . .is really into dogs now and has a job at a dog <br/>
training place, but has started talking about singing again. She goes back <br/>
and forth. She was ridiculed at times as well, about math, and such, but now <br/>
has a great group of unschooler friends who just don&#39;t see people as <br/>
&quot;behind&quot;, so its not an issue anymore. Do you think she would like an email <br/>
pal Sarah? I can ask Lelia first, but I know her, and I am sure her answer <br/>
would be yes. Let me know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561360509">Alrighty, donning flame proof suit here.  Maybe some of the acceptance has<br/>
to do with the part of the country one lives in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought back and can only come up with two negative comments about<br/>
homeschooling and they weren&#39;t that bad.  Youngest kidlet handled it well<br/>
and left some folks with mouths hanging open and with a tad more knowledge<br/>
than when they arrived at the grocery store.  And once when I was first<br/>
homeschooling (there was an unschooling name then) but that one was a hoot<br/>
and I shamelessly egged it on.  Me bad &lt;g&gt;  But, hey, I was only 20 at the<br/>
time.  Guess the stick it to uptight, bigoted racists had already started<br/>
perculating in my gray matter &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In an uptight, rabid Southern Baptist area, perhaps folks and thus their<br/>
children are more critical and less accepting of things and people that are<br/>
&quot;different.&quot;  More into my way or the highway judgements???<br/>

&gt;Yes, I do. But when that child&#39;s lack of academics rolls over and has an <br/>
&gt;affect on her social life, what then? Children can be cruel, not even <br/>
&gt;realizing it. The only kids who *don&#39;t* point out these &quot;academic <br/>
&gt;differences&quot; are the cousins whose parents have been warned by me that <br/>
&gt;this is a hot button and to try to explain it to their kids to be kind <br/>
&gt;,etc.  Should a parent go to all perspective playmates and their parents <br/>
&gt;and say, &quot;look.. my child can&#39;t do xxx so please don&#39;t bring these things <br/>
&gt;up. No board games that involve math, please... she can&#39;t keep up. Oh! and <br/>
&gt;no reading games... can&#39;t do  that, either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If these parents and their children are willing to try to accomodate her, <br/>
maybe they could play the same games in partners, with someone helping with <br/>
the reading and math.  Who knows, maybe that&#39;s the way she&#39;ll learn to read <br/>
and do math.  Or you could play the games with her until she&#39;s comfortable <br/>
with them.  A lot of games only require a little bit of reading, which <br/>
could almost be memorized, like Monopoly.<br/>

mistake.  It backfired.  But he didn&#39;t want to learn then.  Because he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to, it was hard for him, and then he decided he couldn&#39;t.  I <br/>
had to back off and let him do it his own way and in his own time.  He <br/>
still doesn&#39;t read well at 14, but he definitely doesn&#39;t want any <br/>
help.  (Both family and out of family help have been offered.)<br/>

a big way.  I&#39;m not going to say he never will, because he certainly is <br/>
bright enough.  But he&#39;s a physical kid.  He&#39;s into sports.  He builds <br/>
things like bike trails and ramps.  He&#39;s good at fixing things.  (His <br/>
friends ask for his help fixing bikes, and he&#39;s been going to the bike <br/>
store to use some of their tools.  I think he&#39;s made a good impression on <br/>
them and may eventually get hired there.)  He&#39;s a good worker.  (He just <br/>
finished working full time for his dad for a few weeks.  Rod said his work <br/>
habits were quite good.)  He knows how to do at least one trade (tree <br/>
planting) that would put food on his table or put him through <br/>
university.  He also knows that he doesn&#39;t want to do that for a <br/>
living.  How many 14 year olds have that?<br/>

&gt;By &quot;doing better&quot; I mean socially, academically, emotionally, physically, <br/>

&gt;nearly 11 and still struggling to read, unable to do math *whatsoever* and <br/>
&gt;have not a single friend because she doesn&#39;t know how to socially interact <br/>

&gt;*could have* taught her how to tell time, count to 100, etc so she <br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be embarrassed to *be* around other kids her age.  Kids are cruel <br/>
&gt;and the ones who know these things often times make fun of the kids who <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t. I remember hearing the neighbor kid comment, &quot;you mean you *cant* <br/>
&gt;tell *time* yet?!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;By giving her the basics I could have avoided situations like that and imo <br/>
&gt;she wouldn&#39;t be the insecure kid she is today.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe.  More likely, the kids would just find something else she didn&#39;t <br/>
know and bug her about that.  My friend&#39;s daughter used to get called <br/>
stupid by the neighbourhood kids because she didn&#39;t go to school.  Then <br/>
they&#39;d turn around and get her to do their homework for them.  These were <br/>
the same kids who once argued for ages with her about how long a century <br/>
was.  They were adament that it lasted 10 years!.......sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I think the suggestion about finding things she does know in order to quiz <br/>
them back might be useful.  She probably knows at least a few things that <br/>
they don&#39;t.<br/>

  I had a very similar situation with my daughter who is 12. . . turns out she <br/>
  needs help in those areas from other people. . . she and I just clash in <br/>
  those situations (I guess mainly math at this point). I take responsibility <br/>
  for the situation because of not being clear myself when we first started <br/>
  &quot;school&quot;. She does fine with other people explaining things, except when it <br/>
  is a person who doesn&#39;t have the amount of patience she needs. So we have <br/>
  found other people where she can get what she needs when she wants it.<br/>

And this is why I hesitate taking her to a psychologist and treating this as any other physical illness as was pointed out earlier today. I had to give it some thought, but when she&#39;s got a sore throat, off we trot to the doc.. I can *see* the red streaks in the throat, feel the temp., etc. With dd&#39;s social/emotional/intellectual situation, though... who&#39;s to say it&#39;s broken and needs fixing? Me? I often times think so, but then a day comes along and I think, no.. she&#39;s fine... it&#39;ll all work out. Lovemary, I&#39;m so glad to know you have a child like this, too. It gives me a bit of reassurance that it *is* ok and even though the lack of some skills has an effect on other areas in her life, they may just impact her in a positive way.<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt; I still am in need of that parenting manual if anybody finds one :-)<br/>
