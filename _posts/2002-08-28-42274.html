&lt;&lt; One day I was <br/>
watching the video with him and heard the following &quot;Thomas and Henry felt <br/>
sorry for James but they teased him anyway.&quot;  Well, I don&#39;t want my son to <br/>
learn that it is ok to tease people no matter what the circumstances.  For a <br/>
while, I took the videos away.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly watched a Shari Lewis video the other night she hadn&#39;t seen.  Kirby <br/>
used to watch it all the time, and it ended up on a high shelf.  It was 101 <br/>
Things for Kids to Do (or some such).<br/>
<br/>
Even in a video that was all little magic tricks and science tricks and math <br/>
tricks, with nobody onscreen except Shari Lewis herself and sometimes one <br/>
sock puppet, Holly was still surprised at the amount of insult.  Little <br/>
stuff, but Holly&#39;s not used to it.  Saying something or someone was &quot;dumb&quot; or <br/>
&quot;silly.<br/>
<br/>
For Shari Lewis, who was probably born in the 1920&#39;s, it was so mile as to be <br/>
sweet.  Here she is, doing a video for children, having spent large chunks of <br/>
her life doing children&#39;s television programming, and yet Holly thought it <br/>
was teaching bad habits to kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think Holly was right.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I just didn&#39;t like her show but never knew why.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was little and she came back on TV after a long hiatus (maybe to <br/>
raise her child(ren)?), Kirby and Marty liked &quot;Lamb Chop&#39;s Play Along,&quot; and I <br/>
liked the music, but I frequently would point out that it was too bad Lamb <br/>
Chop wasn&#39;t nicer to Charlie Horse, or whatever it was.<br/>
<br/>
Same with other shows they watched.  We discussed the characters on Muppet <br/>
Babies, that they&#39;re living in isolation from adults and the outside world, <br/>
and so have to fantasize and they often get it wrong because they&#39;re always <br/>
just in &quot;the nursery.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I guess that was an unschooling way to watch Muppet Babies!)<br/>
<br/>
Ninja Turtles.  One of them, Raphael, was hot-tempered, and that was part of <br/>
the plot.  He had a hard time being calm and patient.  So sometimes if such a <br/>
problem arose, that was an example given.   Michaelangelo seemed goofy, but <br/>
he was always aware of being honorable.  <br/>
<br/>
Having talked about characters like that when they were little, it was no <br/>
stretch or change to do the same for dramas and musicals and sitcoms.<br/>
<br/>
I used to turn West Side Story off, casually, sometime while Anita was out <br/>
looking  for Tony.   Years passed.  One day I wasn&#39;t in the room and the show <br/>
played out.<br/>
<br/>
ooops.<br/>
<br/>
Holly says there was a bit on &quot;Friends&quot; in which Phoebe is watching &quot;Old <br/>
Yeller&quot; with some people, and at some happy fade, she says &quot;The End!&quot; and <br/>
gets up happily.   The rest, Holly says, are surprised, and it turns out her <br/>
mom had always turned it off at that point. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Did you do this discretely? or did you talk about it. Did she ever ask why when she figured it out at a later date?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d just distract them or change the tape discretely.  It wasn&#39;t just Holly, <br/>
the boys didn&#39;t know either!   At that point in the movie it&#39;s getting to be <br/>
chatty anyway, more subtle and verbal, and there aren&#39;t anymore great songs <br/>
left.  <br/>
<br/>
As soon as she saw it she knew why she&#39;d never seen it.  It didn&#39;t upset her <br/>
at that point.  By then she knew all the songs and had a nice picture of Tony <br/>
and Maria having a little bus ride and living happily ever after (if even <br/>
that).<br/>
