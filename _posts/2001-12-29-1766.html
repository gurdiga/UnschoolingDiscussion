Shoe polish on a rag, sandpaper, and clays are often used for aging things. <br/>
Sometimes just scraping things around in the dirt does wonders. &lt;G&gt; For stuff <br/>
that has to wash clean again, spray in hair color (streaks &#39;n tips) works, <br/>
though you might have to call around to beauty supply and costume places to <br/>
find some brown or tan.<br/>
