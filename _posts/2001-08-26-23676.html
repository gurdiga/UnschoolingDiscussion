<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936239247">Hi all you Mommies out there!<br/>
Every week I make a menu for dinners for the week and then make my<br/>
grocery list.  (don&#39;t think I&#39;m miss organization, &#39;cause I&#39;m very far<br/>
from it)  Anyway......each Sunday night I am trying to finish filling in<br/>
the menu with something interesting and that my kids will eat.<br/>
So.....(to make a long story short)  I keep thinking...I&#39;m sure there<br/>
are other Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s out there struggling with sort of the same<br/>
dilemma.<br/>
I&#39;d love to compile recipes shared by all of us of our most successful<br/>
recipes, meals, snacks ect....  It would be nice to maybe add this to<br/>
the unschooling site, but maybe this is really not unschooling, but then<br/>
what isn&#39;t.  Or, I would just like to compile a recipe book of<br/>
favorites.<br/>
Would anyone like to share recipes?  Maybe an email list of recipe<br/>
sharers....easys, quick recipes that is....  :)<br/>
I mean we have to spend hours making legos ya know....  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sure don&#39;t . . .doesn&#39;t sound like something a Cajun recipe would be. . . <br/>
mixing hush puppies and crawfish. Most everything that is Cajun starts out <br/>
with sauteing some onions, bellpepper, and maybe celery, possibly adding <br/>
garlic. So if I were doing what you are talking about, I would start out with <br/>
that, then adding the crawfish after the vegetables are soft, then maybe <br/>
adding that along with some cheese to the hush puppy mix and frying that up. <br/>
And of couse, adding seasoning. You know what though, I will look in some of <br/>
my recipe books and see if I see anything.<br/>
