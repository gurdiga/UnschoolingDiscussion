Okay, I know.. its better to hold your toungue than to start an issue.. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly how I feel toward my mother, Kolleen.  That&#39;s why I am <br/>
raising my children in almost exactly the opposite way she raised me.  <br/>
She made lots of mistakes, and I&#39;m sure I make some too, but I consider <br/>
myself a far superior mother than she is/was.<br/>
