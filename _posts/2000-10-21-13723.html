<div id="ygrps-yiv-749635571">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Cheryl.  I am married with a grown son and a 5yo son.  I joined <br/>
the list a week or so ago.  I was hoping you all could give me some <br/>
advice on something.  We&#39;ve been working hard the last two months on <br/>
ds&#39; Halloween costume.  It started with dh making a sword for ds and <br/>
then ds just had to have armor.  So I looked into how to make maille <br/>
armor and have made him a coif (hood) and hauberk (shirt).  Dh made a <br/>
shield and is just finishing up whatever that is that looks like a <br/>
sun dress with slits and goes over the maille.  Anyway, ds will <br/>
definitely wear the outfit for Halloween, and we are thinking about <br/>
him wearing it for the Renaissance festival coming up.  We have never <br/>
been to one, so I was wondering if anyone dresses up for these <br/>
things, and if so, would it look strange if he were dressed for it <br/>
and the parents weren&#39;t.  Have any of you ever been to one?  Can you <br/>
tell me what it&#39;s like?  I would love to hear the stories and could <br/>
use any advice.  Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>

It would not be weird for the kid to dress up and not the parent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been to some.  They&#39;re like big fantasy/medieval/Renaissance-style malls <br/>
(outdoors) with lots of stuff  for sale and street performers.  There will <br/>
probably be activities (booths involving skill maybe, or things to climb or <br/>
ride) and such.  Most attendees don&#39;t wear costumes but all the participants <br/>
do.<br/>

I have been to the Ren. Fes at Viz Caya, in Miami for the past two years.  <br/>
Hundreds of people dress up for this one.  I haven&#39;t been to any others, but <br/>
this one is truly elegant.  There is even a living chess game, and they <br/>
always incorporate dance and sword play to show the period.  Schools come by <br/>
the bus load and all the kids and even the teachers are dressed in costume, <br/>
but, as many people are as are not!  Let me see if I can send the addy. &lt;A <br/>

Festival at Vizcaya&lt;/A&gt;   I don&#39;t know if this will work for you, but if not, <br/>
just try www. Vizcaya, or some such combination of Ren , Fes and Viz Caya.  <br/>
Anyway, you will love it, it is in March I think, about when they all are <br/>
around here! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981094677">We went to a festival in Massachusetts last month. I was not dressed in <br/>
costume, however some other homeschoolers were. My son (age 7) didn&#39;t have <br/>
on a costume, but then wished he did once we got there because his two <br/>
friends, although not in full costume, had homemade shields and swords. As <br/>
long he feels comfortable in his costume, then I would think a 5 yo would <br/>
enjoy going in his outfit. The actors walk around in character and they <br/>
addressed our children, who had swords and shields, as &quot;young knights&quot; and <br/>
involved them in the drama once they saw that the kids were in costume. I <br/>
think the people working there like having young kids with whom to interact <br/>
because they still have a sense of wonder. The day we went, there were <br/>
busloads of older school kids who were heard to be rude and offensive to <br/>
the actors. My only suggestion would be to avoid going on a weekday when <br/>
there might be lots of kids who are there but are not interested in being <br/>
there. It makes the performances more enjoyable when you don&#39;t have to sit <br/>
in front of people saying &quot;this is lame&quot; or &quot;this stinks&quot;! Fortunately, our <br/>
children didn&#39;t receive any negative comments regarding their swords and <br/>
shields from other &quot;guests&quot;. I don&#39;t know if other fairs and festivals have <br/>
different atmospheres, but I hope your visit is lots of fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332311722">Thank you to everyone for your replies to my questions about the fair.  After <br/>
reading all the responses, we&#39;ve decided he will wear the light stuff and <br/>
we&#39;ll leave the rest at home, including the sword.  I found a web site for <br/>
the fair here with information on all the performers and offerings.  We are <br/>
so looking forward to this experience!  Thanks again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you.  We&#39;ll take it and leave it in the truck if they don&#39;t allow it.  <br/>
It&#39;s not a toy, but it&#39;s not sharp, either, so I guess we&#39;ll see what they <br/>
think.  <br/>
