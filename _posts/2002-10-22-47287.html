&gt; Showing my dog ignorance here.<br/>
&gt; The only thing I really know about dogs is they steal your pillow and<br/>
&gt; push you out of bed if they can.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our Jack Russell does not want us out of bed, we warm it up nicely for her.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I have always liked Spaniels.  Is it rude to just say Spaniels without<br/>
&gt; saying Springer, Cocker, etc?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. Also not rude to say you like retrievers or terriers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I like that size range and personality.   Although my sister had a<br/>
&gt; Brittany Spaniel, he was a little bigger.<br/>
&gt; His name was Rodney and if you said ---would you rather be neutered or a<br/>
&gt; dead dog--- he would fall over with his tongue hanging out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL! We&#39;ve always pointed our finger, gun-like, and said, &quot;Bang!&quot; as the<br/>
command for &quot;play dead&quot; but I like your sister&#39;s better!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a Basenji.  These dogs were not a good idea.  I have a Shi tzu.<br/>
&gt; Ditto.<br/>
&gt; I end up with any dog or cat that other people, the people in their right<br/>
&gt; minds, don&#39;t want.  And they all live to be 45 and they all have some<br/>
&gt; kind of mental problem.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only 45? &lt;g&gt; Basenjis are unique, that&#39;s for certain. You have to like that<br/>
particular personality (and noise). I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband wants a Golden Retriever, he has the name picked out already.<br/>
&gt; My son wants a Basset Hound, he writes poetry about them.   My city says<br/>
&gt; two dogs and that&#39;s it, so for now I don&#39;t have to worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Goldens are practically perfect from birth -- some chewing stages to go<br/>
through, but other than that they wrote the obedience manual. They are<br/>
limited in their intelligence, but brilliant within those limits (no NASA<br/>
scientist knows more about trajectory than a Golden).<br/>
<br/>
Basset Hounds are marvelous sweet dogs who drool like fountains (and then<br/>
shake their heads so that drippy foamy drool is glooping from everything in<br/>
your house -- there are dry mouthed Bassets but you can&#39;t always tell from<br/>
puppyhood which ones they are!) and the other thing to know about Bassets<br/>
(and any scenthound) is that once they put their nose to the ground and<br/>
catch a scent trail to follow, every brain cell they have is devoted to that<br/>
and they will not see the oncoming truck about to mow them down, nor hear<br/>
you calling &quot;come back!&quot; so don&#39;t rely on their obedience training to keep<br/>
them safe -- they&#39;re not so much disobedient as they are so totally focused<br/>
they just can perceive anything but The Trail.<br/>
