YES!<br/>
I don&#39;t feel as if anything these people do in their personal lives is any of <br/>
my business. They are harassed daily by the media and the things done to them <br/>
would be ILLEGAL if they were done to us.<br/>
How is it that a persons career choice, which puts them in the public view, <br/>
somehow waives their right to a private life?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768484516"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I don&#39;t feel as if anything these people do in their personal lives is any of<br/>
&gt;my business.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone really thinks it&#39;s anyone&#39;s business but the people <br/>
involved, as in, something we have or could have influence over.  What I do <br/>
think is that we, as human beings, react negatively to things happening to <br/>
other folks that we would not want to happen to ourselves (ie, be abandoned <br/>
in a most-public manner by our spouses, have a daughter kidnapped, etc) so <br/>
in a feeling of solidarity with the injured party, we admonish the doer of <br/>
the negative actions and the negative action itself in story-form.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of us yearns somewhat for the story-teller mode of information <br/>
in transmitting social mores, responsibilities and &#39;warnings&#39; to each <br/>
other.  Actors and other media darlings are well-known, and so the stories <br/>
that surround them are more easily accessible (and retained?) than would be <br/>
a story about my cousin Steve, who nobody&#39;s met or is interested in.<br/>
<br/>
In another way, what some media darlings do in their personal lives where <br/>
it transects professional lives, *does* affect &#39;my business&#39;.  (ie, putting <br/>
personal &#39;buddies&#39; into positions of authority where they can do great <br/>
harm.)  When that happens, you can be sure that I make it my business and <br/>
actually try to have influence over what is going on (or make some noise <br/>
about it at least!)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They are harassed daily by the media and the things done to them<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like what?<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any legal harassment that could happen to them that would <br/>
not also be legal if it happened to little-old-me.<br/>
