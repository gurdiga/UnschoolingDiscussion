<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063984363">****Hi, Kate --  I thought we had a pretty good concentration of<br/>
unschoolers<br/>
in CA.  I live in a windy area in the SF East Bay.  Where are you?  Do<br/>
you want to rattle this list and see if you can shake out more<br/>
unschoolers near you?<br/>

Hi Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
Pam Soorshian (sorry for the spelling Pam) hooked me up with some<br/>
unschoolers about 1/2 and hour from us.  But in my town (which is small)<br/>
I can find no others and I have looked.  So, while it&#39;s nice to have<br/>
some within 1/2 an hour from us (who already know each other and I&#39;m<br/>
shy, but trying to make friends ;-) ), it would also be nice to have<br/>
some in town.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were born in the North Bay (Santa Rosa) and I miss the<br/>
atmosphere up there.  I don&#39;t however miss the traffic.  The town that<br/>
I&#39;m in is on the ocean between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, it&#39;s<br/>
windy here most of the time.  Any one else in Lompoc?<br/>
