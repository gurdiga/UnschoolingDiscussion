<div id="ygrps-yiv-807081349">We have two boys, five and seven. They are both big fans of computer games,<br/>
in particular the Age of Empires series. I&#39;m a fan too, both for my own<br/>
enjoyment, and for the unusually empowering and rich environment they offer<br/>
the boys to learn in. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When this interest began, we were pretty strict about screen time. We<br/>
haven&#39;t had broadcast TV in our house since the kids were born, and we&#39;ve<br/>
limited combined viewing in the day to a couple of hours. Recently, with the<br/>
help this list and other reading, we&#39;ve thawed quite a bit, and within the<br/>
last month or so we&#39;ve left the use of the computer and TV to their own<br/>
judgment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While I realize we may be in the deschooling phase of this process, we are<br/>
having a couple of issues that are difficult to live with.  First, I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed a deep irritation that surfaces after playing for an extended period<br/>
of time (I see this in myself, when I play, as well). This has a poisonous<br/>
effect on the household. In particular, the two of them share a computer,<br/>
and the different approaches we&#39;ve tried for switching between them (one<br/>
game each, one hour each, with a timer) have been rather screechy. The games<br/>
tend to be immersive and engaging, which makes it hard to separate from<br/>
them. Also, our ds5 is not really understanding fairness and sharing yet,<br/>
nor does he understand the different rates time passes when you&#39;re playing<br/>
vs. waiting, so he&#39;s difficult to reason with.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Further, our ds5 has very little interest in anything else, which of itself<br/>
I&#39;ve come to accept for various reasons, but it severely cramps the flow for<br/>
the rest of us, especially when only one adult is present. We&#39;ve tried<br/>
making alternatives enticing to him, but this hasn&#39;t been successful thus<br/>
far. He&#39;s pretty intransigent.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on either of these?<br/>

If you can&#39;t afford 2 computers (and many can&#39;t) then you need to help the kids decide whats fair. I tried the &#39;play as long as you want&#39; thing but one kid would hog the computer (often to be mean to the other 2) so we sat down and talked about it together. the 3 of them decided that for a fast paced game, turn taking every hour was reasonable but for slower games like AoE then 2-3 hours was a good time length that meant all of them could get a good play during a day. This holds for me too. I get allocated time.<br/>
  Over the years its worked pretty well although there&#39;s still arguments over whether you forfeit a turn if you leave early to watch TV or somesuch but they negotiate around the rules they set themsleves.<br/>
  We now have 2 computers for the 6 of us which makes it a bit easier but the eldest is saving up for one now as she wants to be on MSN 24 hours a day to chat to her friends so that was ticking off the boys.<br/>
  Most kids over 5 can negotiate these things with a parents help so that everyone is happy but if arguments start then it needs looking at again. for instance, H went back to school so the 3 of them decided it was fair that when she got in at 5pm from school (and she leaves at 7am) she gets 2 hours computer time straight away cos the boys go on all day.<br/>
  Of course theres still some arguing because I have 4 very strong willed children who aren&#39;t wonderful at compromise but on the whole they sort it out amongst themselves now and only call on me when negotiations have stalled.<br/>
  I reckon I could now get a job with the UN ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They started by watching their nine year old cousin play, but quickly picked<br/>
up the mechanics. Strategy is a work in progress - they still play AI at the<br/>
beginner&#39;s level, so it&#39;s relatively easy. But they do some pretty darn<br/>
clever things at times, and I&#39;ve learned a thing or two from them. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to the usual flash games, they had played Zoo Tycoon before, but<br/>
I don&#39;t think they found that much easier. The mechanics are the hard part<br/>
for getting started.<br/>
<br/>
AOE and its sequels are very well designed. I was a child guinea pig of Alan<br/>
Kay, who advocated self directed learning with computers in the early 70s.<br/>
Ever since I&#39;ve been a big fan of rich empowering environments, and AOE<br/>
truly fits the bill, allowing them to take the game in many directions. My<br/>
ds7 is a designer by nature, very sensitive to conflict and tension. His use<br/>
of the game is the scenario designer, where he gets to build little worlds<br/>
that his brother sometimes plays. Ds5, who is now infamous here no doubt, is<br/>
a swashbuckler, and loves to build huge armies he can crush his opponents<br/>
with. And of course, at the beginner&#39;s level, he can.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend your dh playing with them, at least for a long while.<br/>
Too tempting to kibbitz. Better would be to let them discover the world<br/>
themselves, and offer pointers only when asked.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  My boys started the first Age of Empires game at 7 and 5. The 5 yo found it hard at first and would watch his brother and older sister play. He&#39;d aso watch me play Jedi Knight and Half Life and offer advice. Through watching anf then having a go he learnt very quickly. 5 yo&#39;s are amazing in how fast they pick up stuff, much more amazing than those commercials for lame toys would have you believe.<br/>
  He&#39;s now 10 and much better at me than strategy games. But I can beat him on multiplayer Jedi Knight ;-)<br/>
