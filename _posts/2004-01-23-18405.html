&gt;how to help the younger brother who can never beat<br/>

&gt;about keeping Kyle&#39;s feelings in mind, but he is <br/>
&gt;very competitive and does not want to let his little<br/>
&gt;brother to win. I try to play with Kyle several times<br/>
&gt;a day so that he can beat me, but I feel so bad for<br/>
&gt;him sometimes...he gets frustrated and calls himself<br/>
&gt;a loser.   It has gotten so Kyle goes through phases<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of not wanting to play anything<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;with Jason..card games, board games, they even fight<br/>
&gt;over winning cooperative board games!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With my boys, we throw games in there with chance<br/>
components.  If the game is all or mostly chance, you<br/>
cannot win by being older and more skillful.  That<br/>
gives Alex (5) a chance to shine and be the winner<br/>
sometimes against Thomas&#39; (7) greater experience. <br/>
Thomas is hyper competitive too, and throws a fit when<br/>
he loses, so it can be tricky.  Train dice is a good<br/>
one, it&#39;s special dice with train engines and cars on<br/>
the different sides, and you get varying points for<br/>
varying combinations, or any dice games like that. <br/>
I&#39;ve seen a game I want to get called Basket Full of<br/>
Pigs, or something like that, where you throw little<br/>
rubber pigs instead of dice.  Sometimes I will also<br/>
just play a game with Alex when Thomas is otherwise<br/>
occupied, and let Alex win if he wants to.  <br/>
<br/>
I have another related problem also, if anyone has<br/>
experience, or advice to offer.  I would LOVE to stand<br/>
aside and let the boys work out their differences when<br/>
it comes to their disagreements when they are playing.<br/>
 The only problem is that Thomas has impulse control<br/>
issues and other issues that lead most confrontations<br/>
to get violent.  As soon as Alex starts getting loud<br/>
in a conflict, asserting himself, Thomas hits or kicks<br/>
him.  He usually feels badly about it, and shouts out<br/>
an apology as Alex runs off crying to get comfort from<br/>
us.  We&#39;ve talked to him about it a lot of times, too<br/>
many times, and talked to Alex about coming to get<br/>
help earlier if he feels threatened, or tried other<br/>
solutions.  Nothing has really worked so far.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas, because of his neurological issues, has a hard<br/>
time learning from cause and effect, and is not easy<br/>
to reason with either.  If I hear a conflict<br/>
escalating, I try to go talk with them about it. <br/>
Often it is because Thomas took a toy of Alex&#39; or that<br/>
Alex was playing with, and won&#39;t give it back.  We try<br/>
to talk to him about empathy (how would you feel...)<br/>
and all sorts of things.  We try to talk about<br/>
compromises, and about violence not being an ok way to<br/>
express his needs here, and so on and so forth. <br/>
Basically it all ends up feeling like we are policing<br/>
him, which I hate.  <br/>
<br/>
Thomas still will almost never give up the toy in<br/>
question, and most of the time does not even seem to<br/>
be hearing us talk to him.  He basically has the<br/>
toddler mentality right now (If it&#39;s yours, it&#39;s mine.<br/>
 If you are doing something cool with it, it&#39;s mine. <br/>
If I want it, it&#39;s mine.  If I used to have it, it&#39;s<br/>
mine.  etc)  He will just keep repeating &quot;But, I want<br/>
it.&quot; or  &quot;I think it&#39;s cool.&quot;  Or somethng similar, as<br/>
though that is a justification for his behavior.  Alex<br/>
is actually bigger than Thomas by a good amount of<br/>
weight and height, but he is a very gentle and<br/>
sensative person and does not like to resort to<br/>
violence, even to defend himself.  I certainly don&#39;t<br/>
think he should have to, on a daily basis, with his<br/>
own family.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have a child that is non-neurotypical<br/>
(as Anne calls it, thanks Anne for that) who is not<br/>
respecting, and is even abusing, a sibling like this? <br/>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I am really<br/>
tired of the battles, and of feeling like the Toy<br/>
Police, and of Alex acting helpless and being abused. <br/>
I don&#39;t want Alex to learn that we have to fight his<br/>
battles for him either.<br/>

You absolutely positively HAVE to protect your little one from your bigger <br/>
one.  You CAN&#39;T leave them to work things out.  That teaches the older one that <br/>
might makes right, and the younger one that you don&#39;t mind if he&#39;s victimized.<br/>
<br/>
We have a situation in one of our groups where a 3 yo with Down&#39;s syndrome <br/>
cannot resist the 12-18 month olds that are around him.  He is only about an <br/>
inch taller than the babies and he is driven by some impulse to put headlocks on <br/>
these toddlers.  Sometimes he wails away on their heads.  He wraps his arms <br/>
around their faces and squeezes with his fingers in their eyes, etc.  It&#39;s <br/>
horrible and frightening for the babies.  It&#39;s impossible yet for him to remember <br/>
to &quot;touch gently&quot; each time, and the babies&#39; mothers have finally asked that he <br/>
be taught not touch at all.  So what we do is have an adult stand between him <br/>
and the babies as much as possible, or engage him or carry the babies when <br/>
necessary.  <br/>
<br/>
I think your older child has to be prevented from hurting your younger child, <br/>
and if that means you sit with them or near them when they&#39;re together, or <br/>
you tote the younger one with you when you leave the room, then you just do it.<br/>
