I don&#39;t know how I could help anyone thinking about unschooling if they<br/>
couldn&#39;t see into my life and as much as it&#39;s possible from an e-mail<br/>
list,  see that the words I type are lived out here first, with a genuine<br/>
kid. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Deer Lodge, Montana.   Anyone can come and visit. . . .   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deb, I rearranged my Typical Days page just to make a special place for the <br/>
post that quote&#39;s from.  It was beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Last week the reason I was quick to say &quot;This is not a TCS list&quot; is that one <br/>
of the principles of the TCS people is that they refuse to share information <br/>
about their children.  They won&#39;t even tell you age and gender.   For me, <br/>
that&#39;s not helpful.  For me, that&#39;s suspect.<br/>
<br/>
Their justification for the policy is that it&#39;s disrespectful to the children <br/>
to share information about them when they&#39;re not old enough to consent (or <br/>
something like that).<br/>
<br/>
If my husband shares personal information about me with his friends at work, <br/>
I don&#39;t mind.  He IS married, and the stories DO involved his life.  I talk <br/>
about my husband to my friends, and here.  I don&#39;t tell the most obnoxious <br/>
things he ever does or badmouth him, but if he really irritates me, I might come to <br/>
the point that I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to mention it.   If he goes crazy and <br/>
tears up the house, I&#39;ll tell you guys right after I tell the police and the <br/>
insurance company.   (Self-inflicted damage to the structure is probably not <br/>
covered.)  But I fantasize and I digress into that fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
This is my work.  The time I put into helping other people appreciate natural <br/>
learning, and help them be independent of the fear of **curriculum**  <br/>
(oooooh....) is the work I&#39;m doing at this point in  has her diplomas and degrees in <br/>
a box with Tick Toys and I have something around here in a box or filing <br/>
cabinet somewhere, what&#39;s important in THIS office (as it were) is that we are <br/>
doing well with our children, and working on doing better.  So the paper I have on <br/>
the cyberwall is stuff like this:<br/>

There&#39;s a picture of my kids.  It&#39;s two years old now.  They look about the <br/>
same but Kirby&#39;s hair is shorter.  Fluffy early Beatlish-looking.<br/>
