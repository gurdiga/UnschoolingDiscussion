What about Blake Boles&#39; College Without High School?  Has anyone read that? College, as of now, is a major draw for my friend&#39;s dd.<br/>

Does anyone have any other thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580525442">I’d definitely recommend College Without High School – of all the articles I’ve seen  shared with skeptical husbands, the interview with blake is one of the only ones that resonates, often.  here’s the interview, if she wants to start with that instead of a book:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074078908">The book that my 15yo really loves is The Day I Became An Autodidact by<br/>
Kendall Hailey.<br/>
<br/>
Pam S. mentioned  that her daughters had like it, so I went ahead and<br/>
purchased a used copy. My daughter (Anna) loves it so much that she went<br/>
through a period of carrying it around with her. She read it when she was<br/>
14yo, and it&#39;s still in her stack of favorite books that she keeps by the<br/>
side of her bed. I bought our used copy through Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
Anna also liked the Teenage Liberation Handbook, but I think the Kendall<br/>
Hailey book was more inspiring for her.<br/>
<br/>
Blake Boles&#39; book would be a good one to share with a skeptical spouse -<br/>
it&#39;s very logistical and (I think) written for someone new to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara B<br/>
