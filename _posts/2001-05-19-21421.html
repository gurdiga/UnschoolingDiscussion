<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296385965">Hi, thanks for your reply, it&#39;s good to know that I am not the <br/>
only &quot;crazy&quot; person who likes to know anything and everything there <br/>
is to know about what I will be getting myself into through <br/>
parenthood.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if there are still people left in South Africa that <br/>
practice  Elimination Communication,  the problem is that many of the <br/>
rural people have been so westernized that they think it is some kind <br/>
of status symbol to do the stupid things we do.  Like not <br/>
breastfeed,  not sharing sleep, etc etc.  Most of these people are <br/>
giving their babies bottles nowadays and pushing them around in <br/>
strollers!!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway I have also read that disposable diapers could possibly be <br/>
connected to certain cancers in the reproductive organs as well as <br/>
infertility later on.....????<br/>
 <br/>
Hugs,<br/>

Welcome Annelize,<br/>
I am a lot like you in that I start reading and learning about <br/>
something I<br/>
want to do far before the time I am doing it.  The only things I can <br/>
think<br/>
of to do with disposable diapers and from what I have read, the study <br/>
isn&#39;t<br/>
confirmed, but that they cause the temp. in the diaper to be 1 -2 <br/>
degrees<br/>
hotter than cloth and therefore can cause low sperm count in baby <br/>
boys.<br/>
Then of course there is the environmental factors.  Most people who <br/>
use<br/>
disposable do not remove the b.m.&#39;s from the diaper when they throw <br/>
them<br/>
away and they, along with the plastics, go to the land fills causing<br/>
possible diseases or ground water contamination.  I used cloth for <br/>
both my<br/>
kids with no problem.  I did occasionally use disposable but I felt <br/>
really<br/>
guilty when I did.  Of course the cost was an issue too.  I have not <br/>
heard<br/>
of elemination timing but suspect that is what tribal people of <br/>
Africa might<br/>
have done.  I don&#39;t know how well it would work in this culture.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, Annelize, I have several friends who do practice elimination <br/>
timing.  And yes, there are many dangers associated with use of <br/>
disposable diapers, not the least of which is the dioxin which is <br/>
formed through their use, or the gel stuff that&#39;s in the ultra <br/>
absorable ones which is toxic.  <br/>
<br/>
The use of cloth diapers and/or elimination timing is so much more <br/>
natural and satisfying, and is not at all hard to manage.  A lady on <br/>
another of my email lists has written a book about it.<br/>
