<div id="ygrps-yiv-444209131">Hi Everyone!<br/>
Since the list has been a bit slow...I&#39;m guessing because so many are<br/>
attending the conference this weekend....I thought I would ask a silly<br/>
little question.<br/>
<br/>
Do people have any fun traditions for celebrating not going back to school?<br/>
I have seen a couple of people mention picnics or something and was hoping<br/>
others would share.<br/>
<br/>
The local homeschool group I&#39;m involved in will be having a pancake<br/>
breakfast/swim party tomorrow.  My boys are really excited about it.  We<br/>
usually go out to breakfast as a family on the first day that the PS kids go<br/>
back to school.  But this was the first year that someone in the group<br/>
offered to host a breakfast party (Thank you Dominique!)  We definitely<br/>
thought that celebrating with our group of friends and swimming (as all the<br/>
PS kids and some of the &quot;school-at-homers&quot; settle into theirs desks) would<br/>
be more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo....what are your fun plans or traditions?<br/>
<br/>
Namaste,<br/>
