&gt; her. I don&#39;t even know where to begin finding a modeling class (do they offer <br/>
&gt; classes or is it all pageants?) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you just want your daughter to get the chance to learn some basics of <br/>
modeling, the classes are sometimes OK for building self confidence.  But <br/>
remember, the modeling schools are businesses...the more classes you take from them, <br/>
the more money they will make.  They&#39;ll tell anyone they have a shot at <br/>
becoming a real model to get them in the door and charge hundreds of dollars to put <br/>
together a portfolio.  A lot of what modeling schools teach are somewhat <br/>
outdated too.<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty, if someone &quot;has it&quot; (the look a reputable agency is looking <br/>
for) the agency itself will &quot;teach&quot; the child/adult how to stand, pose, etc. <br/>
once they sign them on.  I knew a couple of kids growing up that professionally <br/>
modeled and were in commercials.  None of them went to a modeling school but <br/>
instead took ballet or some sort of dance class to help with poise, grace, and <br/>
posture.  A couple also took acting classes and were in drama at school.  They <br/>
were told often as kids how photogenic they were and that they should model, <br/>
so their parents spent a hefty amount of money getting pictures done by a <br/>
photographer that KNOWS what he&#39;s doing (you&#39;d need to find one that knows how to <br/>
put a portfolio together and has done it for a while) and they sent one or 2 <br/>
pages of photos to real agencies and just waited.  One girls parents hired an <br/>
agent (they had money to burn) and that helped her get her foot in the door.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;d stay away from the modeling schools and instead go for dance <br/>
or some sort of theater club/class.  If you know someone that models <br/>
professionally, ask to see his/her portfolio.<br/>
