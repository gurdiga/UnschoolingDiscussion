<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All...back to pocket change subject..I really 
liked the idea of as many reg. chores as your age...that seemd to work out real, 
well, as we started it here(as that was his average already)&nbsp; He&#39;s 
four....picks up his room, waters the dog(givers him water) , brings dirty 
glasses from other rooms into kitchen so I can wash them etc.&nbsp;, and picking 
up things he&#39;s left around..i.e.&nbsp; dirty clothes, toys 
etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then above that I will pay him 10 cents, or whatever 
depending on the chore, and how hard it is.&nbsp; He just started this kick on 
money..as I though it would be a good way for him to learn counting, and money 
handling, adding subtracting, etc......he takes hi money to the store, and finds 
something within the let&#39;s say 99 cent range, then purchases at the register 
himself......gets change, etc......thing is he spends it as soon as he gets it, 
often, and I &#39;d like to teach him to save it, or encourage him to.&nbsp; SO he 
can see the value of waiting patiently , and earning something he really 
wants......but I&#39;v e left it up to him..my parents never thought it was 
appropriate to discuss financial matters, or things of that sort with children, 
and I wish to be more open with him on that subject, cause turns out my husbands 
parents weren&#39;t that sharing with information on the financial note either, and 
it has taken us years to figure out how the financial world works.....much debt, 
intimidation, and such..so now that we have grown past that I feel it is 
beneficial in teaching the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of money..how to save......etc, now 
while he&#39;s young, so it won&#39;t hit him so hard as it did us.&nbsp; So he is 
confortable..but I also want him to understand the value of money.....and how 
much he has contributed in order to obtain it, so he can get an idea of how hard 
people work to get the things they need.&nbsp; But he carries much more than 
change in his pocket....lots of little gadgets....hehe..he&#39;s my little 
hero.&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle</font></div></html></div>
