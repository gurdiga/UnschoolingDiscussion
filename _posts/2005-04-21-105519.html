<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779429186">Hello all. As of now my 3 brothers-in law live with us. We just <br/>
snatched the 13 year old out of school because we felt it was a waste <br/>
of time and energy on all ends. He&#39;s basically a functioning <br/>
illiterate in reading words and math. He&#39;s basically in the 3rd grade, <br/>
not the 7th. We&#39;re starting from the basics, which is a benefit of not <br/>
being drug around in school when you can&#39;t keep up. <br/>
<br/>
What we are running in to is that he lacks motivation no matter how we <br/>
show him. He continues to space out and not focus. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723343882">Latoya - I looked back at your posts from a few months ago, to double <br/>
check that you were not then interested in &quot;unschooling&quot; - but were <br/>
looking for curriculum materials. Is that still the case? If so, there <br/>
are other places you could get better advice about curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;ll get here will be ideas of how to help them regain their <br/>
lost love of learning (ALL kids had it when they were preschool age) <br/>
NOT by teaching them, but by supporting their interests and letting <br/>
them &quot;deschool&quot; for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Are you asking the same questions elsewhere? On this list, the topics <br/>
you have brought up with be discussed and debated, but you won&#39;t get <br/>
the answers you&#39;re looking for, I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that I want to run you off, you&#39;re welcome to stay and I think <br/>
you&#39;d benefit from it - I&#39;m just thinking that you&#39;re going to be <br/>
disappointed because you&#39;re not going to get what you want from this <br/>
list as far as actual curriculum recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
Or - maybe I&#39;m off-base and you&#39;re now more interested in how to <br/>
support the boys&#39; interests and help them learn, not through doing <br/>
school at home, but by developing their own passions, living a natural <br/>
life together, having conversations, playing games, watching tv and <br/>
movies, and going interesting places, and so on?<br/>
<br/>
If so, you&#39;re going to have to be patient and stop focusing on getting <br/>
them up to grade level and all that. Your focus would be on having a <br/>
good life together, feeling accepted and good about themselves, <br/>
enjoying what they spend their time doing, exploring more of the world <br/>
than they&#39;ve been exposed to, perhaps. You never know what might spark <br/>
an interest - it could be dog training or cake decorating. WHEN they <br/>
have healed and filled their needs for family and love and safety and <br/>
good health and they truly feel supported and cared for - when you all <br/>
are having a GOOD time together, living a life of joy - then they will <br/>
develop interests and passions for learning. If you continue to force <br/>
it now, they&#39;ll always think of learning as something they were coerced <br/>
into doing and something they can be &quot;free&quot; of doing - something they <br/>
can &#39;escape from.&#39; Sad way to think of learning. It can be different!!<br/>

 <br/>
We can help you, but you need to back up and stop and start a new way for  it <br/>
to work.  We honestly, truly, can help you and your brother in law to a  more <br/>
peaceful productive place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He&#39;s basically in the 3rd grade, <br/>
not the  7th.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
If you took him out of school, he&#39;s not in any grade.  The sooner you  forget <br/>
grades and numbers and scores and curves and just deal sweetly and  lovingly <br/>
with HIM as a human, the better in all ways.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- We&#39;re starting from the basics, which is a benefit of not <br/>
being  drug around in school when you can&#39;t keep up. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
????<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s had the basics in school.  Leave him alone for a while.  He  needs to <br/>
recover.  It&#39;s like he&#39;s been in a long, long car wreck and you&#39;re  wanting him <br/>
to jump out and WALK.  WALK FASTER.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-What we are running in to is that he lacks motivation no matter how we  <br/>
show him. He continues to space out and not focus. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
If it didn&#39;t work at school BEFORE he was wounded, why do you think doing  it <br/>
again at home will do anything besides wound him worse?<br/>
 <br/>
Give him a vacation from anything schoolish at all for a long time.   One <br/>
month for each year he was in school.  JUST vacation.  Like a  Saturday.  <br/>
Everytime start in on &quot;basics&quot; or anything LIKE school, start  that count over.  But <br/>
make sure he has things he likes, like magazines with  lots of photos if he <br/>
likes that or comic books, DVDs/videos, video games,  computer access; play <br/>
cards with him, take him to movies, to restaurants he&#39;s  never been to before, to <br/>
public parks he hasn&#39;t seen (do you have a dog who  needs to play chase?), to <br/>
malls or stores, just SEE things and be places that  are not in any way <br/>
whatsoever like school.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Student&quot; isn&#39;t a good term for this list.  Think of him as a person,  not as <br/>
&quot;a student.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s poetry, math, history, sociology, psychology, right off the <br/>
top of my head with just drumming and rap music. Yes, math. Ever check <br/>
out musical notation - all those quarters and halves and wholes and <br/>
dotted notes and such. A half note in one time signature is a <br/>
different pace than a half note in another. He may not be writing out <br/>
equations, but he&#39;s understanding that concept and counting the beat <br/>
if he is drumming. Rap is all about the rhyme and rhythm and that&#39;s <br/>
poetry and literature. But beyond all this, if you&#39;re wanting to start <br/>
to &#39;get&#39; unschooling, start looking outside the subject labelled boxes <br/>
and look at the interconnectedness of life.</div>

Debra&#39;s right.<br/>

Here are some connectedness things about Gilligan&#39;s Island and  Elvis:<br/>

 <br/>
If you could do (or even think) similar things about drumming or music,  <br/>
you&#39;d start to see what we mean by going WITH his interests and desires rather  <br/>
than against them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You need to stop showing him.  Stop trying to &quot;teach&quot; him.  He isn&#39;t<br/>
stupid, he isn&#39;t lazy.  He&#39;s tuning you out because you are trying to<br/>
do the same thing to him that school did.<br/>
<br/>
Learning and motivation are intrinsic.  You cannot motivate someone<br/>
else to learn something they are not interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t only work for kids who are motivated to learn. <br/>
Unschooling is what heals the unmotivated ones.  You can&#39;t wait get to<br/>
unschooling later, after you have somehow motivated him through<br/>
coercive tactics.  <br/>
<br/>
You have to start unschooling NOW if you want him to heal and be<br/>
motivated later.<br/>
<br/>
He loves rap and drums.  There is your language arts and math, if you<br/>
need to think of it in those terms, and your history and science and<br/>
social studies/current events, too.  He&#39;s interested in the bling<br/>
bling?  There are your economics and money/life skills courses.<br/>
<br/>
But I strongly suggest that you drop those terms.  Unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>
about taking Life and chopping it up into subjects.  Let it just be<br/>
rap and drums.  <br/>
<br/>
When you are making dinner, are you thinking to yourself, &quot;wow, I am<br/>
using chemistry and physics and math and language arts&quot;?  Nope.  You<br/>
are thinking, &quot;Yum, we get to have tuna casserole for dinner!  My<br/>
favorite!  It brings back such nice memories...&quot;  Does it matter when<br/>
you double the recipe if you use the 2/3 cup or the 1/3 cup twice?  Nope.<br/>
<br/>
Drop the school crap.  If you aren&#39;t willing to do that, then I am not<br/>
sure why you are posting on an unschooling list anyway.  There are<br/>
thousands of other lists that will tell you how to apply coercive and<br/>
manipulative means to achieve YOUR goals for the boy.  They won&#39;t ever<br/>
be his goals.<br/>
<br/>
He will be motivated to learn those basics as he desires to get more<br/>
information about the things he is interested in, and needs those<br/>
basics to acquire that information.<br/>
