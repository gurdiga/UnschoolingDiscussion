<div id="ygrps-yiv-214523593">We had our first Unschoolers meeting yesterday and I had a blast. <br/>
I think there were 16 kids running around my house playing while <br/>
we chatted and laughed.<br/>
It was great to meet other Unschoolers here in NoVA as I was <br/>
beginning to think everyone was a Pod Person :-)<br/>
<br/>
This will become a regular thing if anyone else wants to come or is <br/>
in the area.<br/>

How did you get the word out to other unschoolers in your area?  I guess I&#39;ve thought of the library,  but not alot of other ideas.    <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m trying to figure this out,,,,,<br/>

Would like to do the same thing here.<br/>
