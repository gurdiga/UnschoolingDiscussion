<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709054062">Since Lord of the Rings has been mentioned several times lately, I thought <br/>
I&#39;d ask....does anyone know of good illustrated editions of these books? I <br/>
read them in high school (and college and adulthood over and over!) and just <br/>
text was fine with me, but my son is 10 and loved Tolkien&#39;s illustrations in <br/>
the edition of the Hobbit we just finished. I have looked at Barnes and Noble <br/>
and other bookstores and also online, but I have yet to find any editions <br/>
with illustrations other than the maps. Does anybody know where I can find <br/>
illustrated books?? Thanks.<br/>

Don&#39;t know about illustrated editions of the books themselves, but <br/>
the conceptual artists (who have worked on Tolkein stuff for <br/>
years) for the films are Alan Lee and John Howe.  We have a <br/>
HarperCollins hardback edition of The Hobbit, illustrated by Alan <br/>
Lee (ISBN 0-261-10330-x)  We got it in with an introductory <br/>
offer from a book club.  It&#39;s beautiful.  Don&#39;t know where we&#39;re <br/>
going to keep it!<br/>
<br/>
Have a poke round the HarperCollins website (whatever that is <br/>
but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find it) and see what there is :-)<br/>

<br/>
We have the old calendars from the 1970&#39;s (not all of them, but several) with <br/>
the Hildebrandt brothers illustrations, and so they&#39;re adjunct but not in the <br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
A young friend of mine lately read the Lord of the Rings and told me that <br/>
there was nothing original in there.  I HOOTED loudly and would&#39;ve spewed if <br/>
I&#39;d been drinking anything, and then realized she was born in the 1980&#39;s and <br/>
by then Tolkien&#39;s universe had spawned hundreds or thousands of copycat <br/>
books, games, movies, cartoons, etc. and sure enough, it had been so <br/>
thoroughly mined for a dozen years before my friend ever hit the planet, that <br/>
there was not a speck of that series that was news to her.<br/>
<br/>
I was apologizing even before I could take another breath, because I realized <br/>
that from her point of view it was not only longer than she needed to read to <br/>
come to things that others had told more recently, less tediously, etc., but <br/>
that taken out of its own temporal and social context, it just wasn&#39;t as big <br/>
a thrill.<br/>
<br/>
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, it *was* the thing to be reading, <br/>
and although it wasn&#39;t designed to do so it aided the cross-cultural social <br/>
engineering going on among young people at the time.  Steeped in visions of <br/>
cooperation between different kinds of beings, and identifying the evil <br/>
politicians with the hoard-guarding, smoke-breathing bad guys... well it was <br/>
a balm on the already-unfolding socio-political business of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Tolkien was a linguist and loved English folklore, and so for those of <br/>
us interested in fairy tales and ballads, there were elements visible, and <br/>
the naming of the elves vs. the orcs and others was a model (a charicature, <br/>
but with legitimate bases) of western Indo-European linguistic differences.<br/>
<br/>
And for those of us who had been being made to read too much 18th and 19th <br/>
century literature, it was nice to read a full-out fantasy which was also so <br/>
beautifully composed.  <br/>
I don&#39;t blame kids today if they&#39;d rather see the movie than read the book.  <br/>
I won&#39;t say a word of shame.  It&#39;s hard going, those books.  But there are <br/>
passages that make me catch my breath.<br/>
<br/>
An elf rider is scoffing at the idea of &quot;halflings&quot; (hobbits, in this story, <br/>
but halflings in English before that) and says to Gimli and Aragorn/Strider:  <br/>
&quot;Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A man may do both,&quot; said Aragorn, &quot;For not we but those who come after will <br/>
make the legends of our time.  The green earth, say you?  That is a mighty <br/>
matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another passage I was going to look for, hobbits going done a river <br/>
in a canyon, with a stunning description, but I already got sucked into the <br/>
book again and I have things to do when kids wake up, so must go.<br/>
