Sometimes what is more damaged by spanking a child is<br/>
the trust between parent and child not so much the<br/>
child themselves although that is obviously up for<br/>
debate here too.<br/>
Imagine yourself as a child loving and trusting, even<br/>
adoring this &quot;big person&quot; in your life who so far has<br/>
nurtured you and kept you safe in every way. Now<br/>
imagine that same person inflicting physical pain on<br/>
you for not knowing any better,for making a mistake,<br/>
for testing the world around you.<br/>
It seems very sad to me...<br/>
Yes you still love and adore that big person but do<br/>
you ever really trust that they won&#39;t hurt you? I<br/>
somehow doubt that.<br/>
We can say we don&#39;t remember the sadness and<br/>
humiliation of the spankings we recieved as children<br/>
all we want but the relationship between ourselves and<br/>
our parents changed from that first strike on. Trust<br/>
me it did.<br/>
