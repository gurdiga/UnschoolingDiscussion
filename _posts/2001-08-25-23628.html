<br/>
All my friends who are professional artists and graphics people use computers <br/>
except one--the one who only does sculpture.  Even some who are doing all <br/>
calligraphy and illumination have a website to keep records of what they&#39;ve <br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
My niece was homeschooled all but the first few years. She watched Mark <br/>
Kistler on PBS for years.  She&#39;s nearly seventeen now.  She got to meet him <br/>
this summer and was thrilled.  But here&#39;s what that, and Sonic the Hedgehog, <br/>
and some Anime videos, and bopping around on the internet led to for Gina:<br/>

<br/>
I told her she had misspelled &quot;intelegent&quot; wrong and she consciously decided <br/>
to keep it that way.  Very interesting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For those who choose not to go see the art, here&#39;s an excerpt from the intro:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 16 years old. Yeah, yeah, so half the people on the net claim to be a 16 <br/>
year old girl. Well I really happen to be one! ~shock!~ And get this, most <br/>
people out there think I&#39;m a guy, because I usually play Role Play Games as <br/>
male chatacters in Yahoo!&#39;s chat rooms. <br/>
So I&#39;m the 16 year old girl pretending to be a 40 year old man out there! HA! <br/>
Things aren&#39;t always as they seem, now are they? <br/>
<br/>
Well, now I have totally confused you as to who or what I am. Mission <br/>
Accomplished! <br/>
So, now, down to business! <br/>

My sister (an artist herself) showed my ds how to scan his pencil <br/>
drawings into the computer and then tweek them. He changes sizes, <br/>
colors, erases lines, adds shading, etc.  All sorts of amazing <br/>
things. He loves this and will work on a drawing for days making <br/>
multiple versions.  He can then include them in his web pages, send <br/>
them to friends, adds them as backgrounds for our computer, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not &#39;artistic&#39; but these two have a great time.  She recently <br/>
moved in with us, so my ds is overjoyed.  He&#39;s got his own resident <br/>
art teacher. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also an ebook editor and does web design.  She taught him HTML <br/>
coding last year and he coded and put up his own web page.<br/>

&lt;&lt; In general I find that Broderbund (the<br/>
maker of Kid Pix) makes easier to use software than MS does.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly is just at this moment playing the first Broderbund game we ever <br/>
bought--Playroom.  I was just telling her the shocking story of how it cost <br/>
$50 new and was the first computer game we ever bought.  Lately we&#39;ve bought <br/>
a newer KidPix on CD for $5, and a newer Zoombinis for $15 from Scholastic.   <br/>
She was surprised.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I remembered to tell her she&#39;s playing the upgraded version.  The $50 <br/>
original was in black and white.<br/>
