&lt;&lt; It&#39;s difficult to find that sense of community for our families.  Or am I <br/>
 just looking in the wrong places??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think you are looking in the wrong places.  I think you are <br/>
absolutely right, being away from extended families and the increasing <br/>
dangers in our world is making AP harder on parents.  It is definitely more <br/>
difficult....How does everyone balance their own needs with that of their <br/>
children.  BTW, the  basic requirement of being an attached parent is <br/>
&quot;parents get to know their child on the deepest level by responding <br/>
sensitively to the baby&#39;s needs.  The parents then become uniquely qualified <br/>
to make choices for their family based on what works best for their <br/>
particular baby, rather than relying on the advice of outside &quot;experts&quot;.  <br/>
Trusting and listening to your baby/child-trusting and listening to <br/>
yourself.&quot;  This is quoted from documentation from Attachment Parenting <br/>
International-information sheet.<br/>
