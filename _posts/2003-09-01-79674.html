<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031726389">Oh, and last night, after all this discussion all day about my kids <br/>
not helping, my 18 year old was standing over by the vacuum, and I <br/>
asked him if he would plug it in because I needed to vacuum the area <br/>
rugs, and he said, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;  (shock, bewilderment)...... I tried <br/>
to hide my shock and just said &quot;Thank you, that&#39;s very nice of you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Then my 13 year old came out and asked if I&#39;d take him to the store <br/>
to get a slurpee, and I said I didn&#39;t have any money, and he said, &quot;I <br/>
do, I&#39;ll buy you one if you want.&quot;  How sweet.  He is the one who <br/>
always volunteers to put gas in the car when we are broke.  <br/>
<br/>
But he doesn&#39;t volunteer for chores.  So, one is generous with his <br/>
time, the other generous with his money.  Each to his gifts.<br/>

asked to &quot;review&quot; the  SC conference, and below is my essay.<br/>

Resource Review:   the 2003 Live and Learn Unschooling Conference, <br/>

Fish swim, birds fly, people learn.     (paraphrased from john holt)<br/>
<br/>
Hello.  My name is cris and I&#39;m a radical unschooler.  There.   The <br/>
second public utterance of my addiction to freedom.  (the first was <br/>
my introduction at our SOS planning meeting) You are all witnesses to <br/>
my coming-out.  I know some of you have suspected for a while, but <br/>
have been cautious about broaching the subject, knowing the possible <br/>
flood of evangelism you might unleash!  Well, now you&#39;ve asked for <br/>
it, so here it comes...<br/>
<br/>
I have admitted to being an unschooler, and a radical one.  If you <br/>
don&#39;t know what unschooling is, Google it!!  (Google is the <br/>
homeschooler&#39;s best friend!!)  I&#39;ll tell you here what being <br/>
unschoolers means to us, then, when you Google it, you can revel in <br/>
all sorts of interpretations, and hopefully figure out what&#39;s going <br/>
to work for you, cuz I KNOW you all will want to become unschoolers, <br/>
too!   (In case you haven&#39;t noticed, I am an evangelist of <br/>
unschooling).  So...<br/>
Remember how you learned how to walk? Nobody sat you down at your <br/>
first birthday and said &quot;Now you will learn to walk&quot;  and gave you a <br/>
worksheet on the anatomy of your legs and back and the  physics of <br/>
putting one foot in front of the other.  They held your hands and <br/>
murmured encouraging words.  You WANTED to get somewhere and when <br/>
your body was ready, you walked. <br/>
Remember how you learned how to talk?  Nobody sat you down  at your <br/>
second birthday and said &quot;Now you will learn to talk&quot; with taped <br/>
conversations to listen to, or worksheets on the alphabet and <br/>
phonetics.  You heard other people talking, you watched them talk to <br/>
each other, you paid attention when mama talked to you, you WANTED to <br/>
relate and communicate, you imitated what you saw and heard, you made <br/>
noises <br/>
that caught people&#39;s attention, and when your brain was bursting with <br/>
desire,  you talked.<br/>
Remember how you learned to ride a bike?   Nobody sat you down at <br/>
your sixth birthday and said &quot;Now you will learn to ride a bike&quot;  <br/>
with a  textbook with questions at the end of each chapter that you <br/>
had to answer in order to prove that you had &quot;learned&quot; how your body <br/>
and the bike work together and the physics of gears, and the biology <br/>
of eye-hand-middle ear-legs-feet coordination.  You watched other <br/>
people do it, you WANTED to do it so much you could taste it, you got <br/>
on it while someone held it, murmuring encouraging noises, and you <br/>
took off.  And when you fell, there were comforting arms and more <br/>
encouraging noises so you got back on and tried again.  And again.  <br/>
And again.   And you rode away into freedom.<br/>
You, and your children, learned all this by your DESIRE and your <br/>
loved ones&#39; support.<br/>
Unschoolers keep on learning this way.  Every minute of every day is <br/>
a &quot;learning experience&quot;.   As children we are like sponges, joyfully <br/>
absorbing everything our senses come into contact with, our brains <br/>
and bodies bursting with desire to know and feel and connect and see <br/>
and relate and hear and do and experience.  Our unschooling children <br/>
make their own judgements about how to use their time and energy, <br/>
learn to know <br/>
themselves deeply without other people&#39;s values and opinions coloring <br/>
their perceptions.   As unschooling adults we model that life is <br/>
learning by continually exploring our inner and outer environments,  <br/>
that everything in the world has something to teach us, that we all <br/>
have different styles of learning.  As unschooling parents we offer <br/>
our children hands to hold and murmuring voices of encouragement when <br/>
they feel unsure,  arms to comfort them when they fall,  answers to <br/>
questions, and access to sources for the answers we don&#39;t know,  we <br/>
say no as little as possible, and try always to say yes.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is living life in the great wide world.   It&#39;s trusting <br/>
our children, respecting their selfhood, knowing that they can and <br/>
will find and learn what they need to be their authentic selves right <br/>
now, and to grow into the authentic adult humans they are meant to be.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, I&#39;m supposed to be saying something about the conference, <br/>
aren&#39;t I?!   Hmmm...<br/>
I went to the conference to meet some people whose thoughts on <br/>
homeschooling and unschooling I have admired and used to strengthen <br/>
my convictions.  What I learned there is:  that I AM NOT ALONE in my <br/>
convictions, in my &quot;radical&quot;-ness (radicality?), in my questioning of <br/>
societal norms, in my trust in my children, in my trust in myself, in <br/>
my addiction to freedom, in my hopes of changing the world, and that <br/>
it&#39;s good and it&#39;s right and it works.<br/>
So y&#39;all need to plan and budget for the Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>
Conference in 2004, cuz it&#39;s going to be held in Peabody MA, so <br/>
the &quot;it&#39;s too far&quot; excuse won&#39;t work.  Go and be baptized into <br/>
freedom.  <br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
Live long and prosper.<br/>
May the force be with you.<br/>
Namaste.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105354703">That was wonderful!  I have been looking for a good way to explain to my<br/>
in-laws (my MIL was a substitute teacher for many years) Would it be ok If I<br/>
sent this along to them?<br/>
