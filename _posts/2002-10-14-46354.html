<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002550304">Hiya, Folks!<br/>
<br/>
Liam and I just got home after two days of driving from the SOS Conference <br/>
in South Carolina.  I&#39;m bushed!  There were 803 new messages in my inbox!<br/>
<br/>
The conference was just fantastic!!  Being in a space with so many <br/>
like-minded, unschooling, kid-respecting people was a dream come-true for <br/>
me.  I wish there were a way to have an IRL community with these folks <br/>
rather than only this virtual community, but this wonderful virtual <br/>
community definitely fills a great need.  Without it, I&#39;d never have met <br/>
all those wonderful folks and had this great adventure with Liam driving <br/>
nearly 1600 miles.<br/>
<br/>
Sleepyhead (A.K.A. Liam) has just informed me that he must have a story so <br/>
I&#39;ve gotta cut this message short.  I just want to quickly say that my hat <br/>
is off to all the folks who pulled together the conference, to the <br/>
presenters who managed to do some fancy footwork when the schedule needed <br/>
to be rearranged, to all the kids and their parents who were all just <br/>
wonderful folks to be around, and to Sandra who I am so glad I got to <br/>
meet.  I&#39;ll never forget Sunday, October 13th because I got to meet her and <br/>
tell her what a great influence she has been in my life (and Liam&#39;s life, <br/>
too!).<br/>
<br/>
Note to Ren and kids:  We miss you guys!  If you ever want to go to the <br/>
other Florida, there&#39;s a little home there with your name on it (it&#39;s <br/>
definitely larger, though, than the Clarion Town House&#39;s room 562!).<br/>
<br/>
I gotta go!<br/>
<br/>
Love to all!!!<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>
