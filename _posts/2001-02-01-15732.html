&gt; Well I have been absent in recent months due to a series of illnesses.  I<br/>
know this topic has been discussed before, but I need help.  A good friend<br/>
is telling me to look into FMS, as she thinks I am a prime candidate for<br/>
such a diagnosis.  I really am starting to feel like some kind of<br/>
hypochondriac because I always seem to be sick.<br/>
<br/>

I think I could have wrote that post!  I doubt that I will be any help, as I<br/>
am still trying to solve my health issues, but I totally empathize.  I, too<br/>
am an infrequent poster, by the time I read the posts I&#39;ve accumulated, I&#39;m<br/>
usually too tired or &#39;fuzzy-headed&#39; to write any meaningful replies.  I do<br/>
have a Rheumatologist, that would probably be the specialist to see for<br/>
Fibromyalgia.  I have many of the symptoms of FMS, but I don&#39;t respond to<br/>
the particular pressure points that are used for a diagnosis.  My symptoms<br/>
come & go, and I have a history of autoimmune disease since early childhood.<br/>
For awhile Lupus seemed to be the concern, but again I don&#39;t meet all the<br/>
qualifications for that dx.  I do have &#39;positive&#39; lab results for some<br/>
autoimmune disorders, but I don&#39;t have the symptoms that match those.  I&#39;m<br/>
supposed to have an MRI to check for MS, as soon as my insurance gives the<br/>
okay.  Another thing I&#39;ve read about is hormone problems, such as<br/>
progesterone deficiencies, but that&#39;s of course out of the mainstream, and<br/>
I&#39;m not sure who to trust for alternative work anymore.  I originally was<br/>
seeing a Nurse Practitioner in practice with a Homeopathic MD, their<br/>
suggestion was Prozac!  What has helped me is Cranial Sacral therapy, I&#39;ve<br/>
just started again, used it last year and I went into a &#39;remission&#39; of<br/>
sorts, don&#39;t know if it was related to the CST or not, but I&#39;m convinced it<br/>
did something.<br/>
<br/>
And the guilt feelings!  When I&#39;m laying on the bed totally wiped out, and<br/>
my  4 yr old is saying &quot;Play with me Mommy&quot;, oh that&#39;s the worst part of<br/>
all.  Like I said, no answers, but lots of understanding........ Let me know<br/>
if I can be of any other assistance.<br/>
