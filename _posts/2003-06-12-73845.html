Thanks, haven&#39;t seen them yet.  We need some to quote Pink Floyd {got <br/>
me in the mood and I&#39;m listening to them now } Need some for <br/>
unschooling Bumperstickers that say &quot;We Don&#39;t Need No Education, We <br/>
Don&#39;t Need No Thought Control&quot; &lt;EG&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you seen the movie? It&#39;s a bit extream and deep {I like extream <br/>
and deep LOL} But the WHOLE album is a tribute of why we treat our <br/>
kids with respect and stay away from &quot;grounding&quot; them out in to <br/>
something &#39;we will be proud&#39; of. <br/>
My sister {who is 10 years older then me} had the album and I have <br/>
listened to it for a LONG time {12 or so?}. Interesting enough this <br/>
is also the sister that turned out to be a .. you guessed it.. a <br/>
school teacher. With all the qualities she once rebelled against.<br/>
