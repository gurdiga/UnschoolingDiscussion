<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053364867">I am having a problem.  I have 4 kids, 9, 6, 3 and 15 months.  After having my fourth and last baby I am finding it VERY DIFFICULT to school my kids at all.  Just when I get started the baby wakes up, or he and my 3 year old get into all the teaching materials that we are using for our lesson. My kids seem to learn better in the morning which is fine but I am a night person so trying to get up and functioning early is hard. I know there are many families with various age kids but how do you do it?  I am really finding myself being more stressed every time I try to do a lesson because I am struggling with the littler ones. I give the 3 year old her stuff, which is hard because she cant read yet.  Then I am running back and forth answering questions for the 6 and 9 year old all while trying to keep the baby out of EVERYTHING!!!   PLEASE HELP!!!!  Plus it doesn&#39;t help that my mom and husband are on my case because I am not &quot;teaching&quot; my kids.  I don&#39;t usually have an issue with this but it is REALLY getting on my nerves.  <br/>
ANY suggestions would be greatly appretiated.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Tyra</div>

 </span></blockquote>Kids learn all the time.  Do you mean that they are more able to sit still and do their lessons in the morning?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are teaching though.  You are doing lessons with teaching materials.  Perhaps you could do more field trips and hands on activities.  Are you looking to unschool, or are you looking for homeschooling with lessons, advice?_,_._,___   <br/>
