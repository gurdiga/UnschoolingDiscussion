<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077776179">Whenever I try to put a name on our journey, I always come back to<br/>
&quot;Life&quot; or Living life... That is the best way to describe what we do as<br/>
a family.  But, when you give someone this answer, they look at you a<br/>
bit funny.  It guess it isn&#39;t supposed to be fun, or real, or<br/>
interesting ect...  It should be drudgery and difficult.  Hmmmm....<br/>

You guys can vote all you want to, and you can vote to re-name &quot;dog&quot; but once <br/>
a term is entrenched in a culture it&#39;s very hard to change and probably not <br/>
worth it.  The word&#39;s over 20 years old, and there it sits.<br/>
<br/>
You can call your OWN behaviors and activities whatever you want, but when <br/>
you end up talking to other unschoolers at some point you&#39;ll have to say <br/>
&quot;same as unschooling&quot; to facilitate communications.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376531509">Hmmmm, true.<br/>
I have never, ever classified our type of homeschooling.  But, after knowing us,<br/>
everyone says, well, you are basically an unschooler.  I just say yes, and then<br/>
smile.<br/>
I don&#39;t care what it is called...we just &quot;do our thing&quot;.<br/>

***Other homeschoolers used to ask me what curriculum we used. I answered,<br/>
&quot;The Wing-It&quot;.<br/>
Then I&#39;d explain that we&#39;re unschoolers. &quot;Why would you *do* that?&quot; they<br/>
would ask with barely masked horror. &quot;It fits our lifestyle&quot; I&#39;d reply,<br/>
smiling. That would generally scare them off. I wasn&#39;t really trying to<br/>
frighten them, but I figure if they&#39;re really interested they&#39;ll come back<br/>
to ask more questions. Some do, most don&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would be tempted to tell people that we &quot;do that&quot; because we want our<br/>
kids to have a passion for learning that lasts a lifetime and no mental<br/>
scar tissue.  (from painful forced learning experiences)<br/>
