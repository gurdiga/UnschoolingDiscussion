plans don&#39;t even remotely involve the parents getting them there.  One <br/>
question I always ask my boys is this some place that you would approve of <br/>
Cait going?  That usually stops them in their tracks.  They are very <br/>
protective over their sisters and over each other really.  If the response is <br/>
&quot;no, she&#39;s too young&quot;, then I say, well then you might want to ask Sarah if <br/>
she wants to go with you (dd23).  If they still think it&#39;s not a place for <br/>
their sisters, they are much more likely to examine the reasons why they <br/>
don&#39;t feel it&#39;s appropriate for the girls and when they express those <br/>
concerns, I just tell them those are the same concerns I have about you <br/>
going/doing whatever it is that bothers me.  Many times they will just not do <br/>
it because now, since it&#39;s THEIR thoughts on the not so good aspects of it, <br/>
it&#39;s easy to see why it&#39;s not such a good idea.  Before they were probably <br/>
hearing only the reasons for going/doing whatever it is because a friend or <br/>
friends told them how great it was going to be.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard sometimes to be a parent, I know.  Just try to keep telling <br/>
yourself when it is hardest to love them and their thoughts and actions, it&#39;s <br/>
also probably when they need loving the most.<br/>
