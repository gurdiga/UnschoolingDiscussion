<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004341736">I have a very sick 11 year old upstairs right now and I got to thinking<br/>
about something...<br/>
<br/>
This same child missed 20 days of school the first half of this year (our<br/>
attempt to get away from the rigidity of homeschooling that we didn&#39;t need<br/>
anyway!) because she was sick so often.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time she&#39;s been sick since Feb. when we started<br/>
homeschooling again.<br/>
<br/>
Since she has less exposure to all those germs, she&#39;s been much healthier!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also not getting punched in the face anymore either.<br/>
<br/>
I think reasons of health are some of the best reasons that our children are<br/>
better off at home!!<br/>

I wish I wish.....I am jealous of all the things that my children will have<br/>
that I did not, especially not having to ever deal with the ps system.  In<br/>
many ways I am still the terrorized and wounded child, learning to heal<br/>
myself.  When you add dysfunctional parents to the dysfunctional school<br/>
system and throw in a sickly and anemic child with chemical imbalances (me)<br/>
it makes for a very scary and lonely way to grow up.  You daughter makes me<br/>
want to cry for joy.  From your description she could be me, except that<br/>
nobody cared enough to try to save me at 11.  My first deep breath was when<br/>
my wonderful husband reached into the freezing river of my life and pulled<br/>
my head above the water.  My husband is my &quot;Knight in Shining Armour&quot; who<br/>
has rescued me from being a slave to my past and all their baggage, and<br/>
enabled me to turn my face to today, and tomorrow.  To love and to Life.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed Be,<br/>
