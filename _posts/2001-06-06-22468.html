&lt;&lt; Are y ou saying that if while bicycling a paved road,   you or your child <br/>
hit a<br/>
 pebble and take a tumble,  you would  be upset because you would consider the<br/>
 ensuing broken arm  or  cut on knee requiring either a butterfly bandage or 3<br/>
 stitches to be &quot;severe&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
 My use of &quot;carried away&quot;  refers to defining and usage of the word &quot;severe&quot; ,<br/>
 not to  the emotional action one might feel for ANY  &quot;boo-boo&quot;  suffered by<br/>
 one&#39;s babies---whether occurring on public or private property.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    From what I read the person wasn&#39;t ON the &quot;prime&quot; property. This &quot;prime&quot; <br/>
property would need a hell of alot of clean up to be &quot;prime&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
    We weren&#39;t talking pebbles we are talking dog bites here. I have been <br/>
chased,bit at and hit  by dogs while cycling. It is in no way OK w/ me. It is <br/>
a mazing to me that people do not take responsibility for their dogs. <br/>
<br/>
   This is not &quot;normal&quot; to have 20 some dogs that run wild and hunt their own <br/>
food. let alone some one was injured by one of them or more (don&#39;t know how <br/>
many she encountered).<br/>
<br/>
    I just think it is uncalled for to pick apart the word severe in this <br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
    Have you ever been bit or even chased by a dog intent on harming you?<br/>

 Just a note.  I don&#39;t know how this became a child that was injured (not by<br/>
 you Vicki, by others) but it was an adult that was walking on their property<br/>
 in the original news report.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
    Re check the top Lynda. This was from Vicki asking about you or your <br/>
child. So now we are into generalities not the case we were speaking about.<br/>
<br/>
    Sorry how backwards this copy is but, it&#39;s too early to think for this <br/>
computer illiterate. :o) <br/>

&lt;&lt; &quot;Those children are my children, not wards of the state. The state needs to<br/>
 learn its place and that is not in family business. It is up to them to<br/>
 explain their behavior to everyone because it affects us all. May the<br/>
 public demand some answers. May the family be protected for ever and ever.<br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;May they (the state) be punished for their imposition. But may affairs of<br/>
 the heart be the purview of love within the home, and may they never be<br/>
 confused. The Constitution of the United States of America supports this<br/>
 premise.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
   Released by her lawyer. Key.<br/>
<br/>
   After reading both posts and I will continue to read about this, it sounds <br/>
like a both sides covering and making this a public decision. Who&#39;s side are <br/>
you on sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
   I don&#39;t get how it would be thier property free and clear if they were <br/>
back in taxes and the State claimed it for back taxes. Then it was sold as <br/>
usual in these cases. How is it the McGuckin&#39;s property free and clear. Did <br/>
they pay their back taxes? Did they go through the proper channels once they <br/>
got behind and neglected to pay? I am sure w/ their extenuating circumstances <br/>
(ill father) they could have worked something out.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ll have to keep up w/ this one.<br/>
<br/>
   I just don&#39;t buy into either sides story completely yet. Something is up <br/>
w/ this attorney IMO b/c I doubt the state of Idaho will screw around after <br/>
the major troubles w/ the Randy Weaver case. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Just to put things in perspective, lets discuss<br/>
 Northern Idaho.  Lost of wilderness and resort areas,<br/>
 tiny communities where everyone knows everyone else. <br/>
 The police are small town cops who know and care about<br/>
 their neighbors.  They knew this family.  They did not<br/>
 arrive with guns to kick in the door of the house and<br/>
 drag out screaming children.  The arrived, spoke<br/>
 calmly with one of the older boys for a time, and he<br/>
 proceeded to run into the house shouting &quot;GET THE<br/>
 GUNS!&quot;  and they let all the dogs loose on the<br/>
 oficers.  The dogs had been locked in the basement via<br/>
 a legal order to restrain them because of their wild<br/>
 hunting and endangering neighbors.  They had probably<br/>
 told him that his mother had been taken into custody<br/>
 would be my guess.<br/>
 <br/>
 About that woman the dogs attacked, I should have said<br/>
 the attack was serious and not necessarily the wounds.<br/>
  Luckily she was rescued by a Sheriff happening along,<br/>
 who was also attacked and bitten despite firing his<br/>
 weapon to scare them off.  ANY dog attack,<br/>
 particularly pack attacks is not fun or minor.<br/>

was in my head about Idaho but I couldn&#39;t bring it out properly. Also I can <br/>
not say enough how I know families like this who train their children to use <br/>
guns and the attitude that is instilled. <br/>

There have been several similar cases over that last couple of years in and<br/>
around this area.  The difference this time is that the family didn&#39;t give<br/>
up and just move off the property or sell out for pennies on the dollar.<br/>
<br/>
Free and clear means they owned the property free and clear, no mortgages.<br/>
The government taxes property each year but that has nothing to do with the<br/>
property being &quot;free and clear.&quot;  If the husband hadn&#39;t been ill they could<br/>
have taken a loan out on the property but they couldn&#39;t get anyone to do<br/>
that either.  The county wasn&#39;t interested in helping, the county was only<br/>
interested in getting the property into the hands of a developer in order to<br/>
increase the tax base.<br/>
<br/>
The county is currently being investigated and, and I believe one lawsuit<br/>
has been filed.  I also understand from dil&#39;s brother (he lives not far from<br/>
there) that neopotism is part of this--someone in government has relatives<br/>
that are part of the folks that want to develope all this lake front<br/>
property.<br/>
