&lt;&lt; Why would a university make you take courses that were irrelevant to your <br/>
degree?<br/>
It would be like my neuroscience degree asking for a couple of courses in <br/>
fine art and English litereature! &gt;&gt;<br/>

Seeing as how there are 170 unread pieces of mail in my queue (not counting <br/>
what came in in the past hour), this might all have been answered, but here <br/>
is the answer:<br/>
<br/>
Liberal Arts<br/>
<br/>
Universities don&#39;t want to have graduates who are ignorant.  So a tech school <br/>
degree can be very limited to just what you need to be a welder or a <br/>
glassblower of scientific tubes and special beakers, or a repairer of one <br/>
particular brand of cash register.  But a neurosurgeon has a university <br/>
degree, and in the U.S. that&#39;s probably going to mean English literature.<br/>
<br/>
When I went to UNM I slid through in a lax season (following the Viet Nam war <br/>
protests in which a student was bayonetted by the national guard and many <br/>
were tear gassed, and the semester ended abruptly a week before finals), and <br/>
wasn&#39;t required to take a foreign language nor math.  <br/>
<br/>
The requirements were raised the year after I left.  <br/>
<br/>
So I have &#39;college lite&#39; (though I had enough credits for three full minors, <br/>
so it wasn&#39;t numbers, it was hoops-not-jumped).<br/>
<br/>
Brits are different.  They think they invented it or something.  (But I think <br/>
probably the French beat them to it &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819274708">My dh nearly didn&#39;t get his BS in physics due to poor spelling (in the <br/>
early &#39;80&#39;s). At the time in California, you had to pass an essay exam <br/>
(handwritten, of course, no spell-check) and didn&#39;t pass it due to <br/>
spelling. It cost him an extra semester to retake it, and could well <br/>
have cost him the degree.<br/>
