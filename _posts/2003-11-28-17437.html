<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018305808">I finally got some pictures to post.  We are number 50 out of 50 <br/>
photos.  I got more pictures in my digital camera but the batteries <br/>
died before I could upload them.  These pictures came from one of <br/>
those cell phones that take pictures.  They don&#39;t take great pics, <br/>
but at least the battery didn&#39;t die.<br/>

PS, there is an empty album with my name on it because I couldn&#39;t <br/>
figure out how to do it at first.</div>
