<br/>
If those sound like your electric company, you might be able to get a free <br/>
VSH tape of a long-out-of-print late-&#39;50s Disney cartoon called Donald in <br/>
Mathemagicland.  I saw it (a short version, probably) in a theatre when I was a kid. <br/>
 We&#39;ve rented it from Hollywood Video, but it&#39;s not available for sale or <br/>
I&#39;d&#39;ve bought one.  But while I was looking, I found this.  <br/>
<br/>
It has a VERY fun section on pool tables and angles and fancy pool shots.<br/>

Wow, I loved this as a kid and I know my own little math-hound would <br/>
love it too, but we&#39;re on the west coast. If anyone lives in one of <br/>
these areas and isn&#39;t interested in getting this tape for themselves <br/>
and wouldn&#39;t mind ordering one, I&#39;d be more than willing to pay for <br/>
shipping, etc. I&#39;d love to see it again, but the price from Disney <br/>
is $50!<br/>
