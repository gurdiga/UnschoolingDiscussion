<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221067832">Hi again all,<br/>
<br/>
A Japanese newspaper carried this interesting story yesterday about the <br/>
promotion of &quot;overseas development assistance&quot; in Japanese school <br/>
curriculums.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds nice on the surface, but there is one glaring omission: Japan has <br/>
come under heavy fire in years past for the way its ODA is &quot;distributed&quot; <br/>
to so-called underdeveloped nations around the world.<br/>
<br/>
More often than not, the Japanese government grants this ODA to projects <br/>
that Japanese corporations are involved in overseas. And guess what: Lots <br/>
of those Japanese corporations working in those poorer countries have <br/>
contracts directly or indirectly with the Japanese government. Many <br/>
people in and outside Japan have been blasting the Japanese government <br/>
for this practice for years.<br/>
<br/>
Funny how these kinds of facts conveniently get omitted from news stories <br/>
-- and classroom curriculums as well.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese Education Ministry&#39;s motivation for pushing ahead with this <br/>
dubious curriculum in public schools becomes apparent in the last <br/>
paragraph of the story.<br/>

MATERIALS TO TEACH KIDS ABOUT NATION&#39;S ODA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Foreign Ministry has produced educational materials designed to help <br/>
children better understand the role Japan plays in funding aid programs <br/>
through official development assistance, and has distributed the <br/>
materials to 3,000 primary schools nationwide.<br/>
<br/>
Subtitled &quot;To Make Everyone Smile,&quot; the materials are a 22-minute video <br/>
and a teacher&#39;s booklet, and is designed for sixth-grade students, <br/>
ministry officials said.<br/>
<br/>
The video discusses Japan&#39;s economic recovery after World War II and <br/>
international assistance given to Japan after the Great Hanshin <br/>
Earthquake in Kobe. It also focuses on the difficulties facing developing <br/>
countries, which account for about 80 percent of all the nations of the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that ODA from Japan, the largest ODA contributor, has been used <br/>
to build bridges and schools in many countries is also explained in the <br/>
video.<br/>
<br/>
Following the advice of schoolteachers, the video also contains a number <br/>
of quizzes. The booklet accompanying the video gives three examples of <br/>
how to use the material in the classroom, the officials said.<br/>
<br/>
With the nation in the grip of a prolonged economic recession, some have <br/>
criticized the giving of massive amounts of ODA. However, one teacher who <br/>
used the materials in class said that, by using the material, students <br/>
came to think of Japan as a good country and could take pride in being <br/>
Japanese.<br/>
