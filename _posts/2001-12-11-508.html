Remember when you were a kid, around Mother&#39;s Day or Father&#39;s day, and asked <br/>
your parents &quot;When is Children&#39;s Day?&quot;  Remember what they said?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everyday is Children&#39;s Day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, when Julian asked (when he was about 5), we set a date, and now, every <br/>
year, we have a Julian Day. It&#39;s cool, because it&#39;s different than a <br/>
birthday. We recognize what he&#39;s especially interested in and do a special <br/>
activity, and there&#39;s a gift. The gifts are less likely to just be toy kinds <br/>
of things, and more connected to who he is. For example, this past year he <br/>
got a kayak. The gift isn&#39;t always that expensive, but it always reflects <br/>
something important about him or his interests. <br/>
<br/>
We also have Mother&#39;s Day (for me) and Beffy-Boo Day ( for Beth). And he <br/>
celebrates Father&#39;s Day with his dad.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re just party kinda people :)<br/>

I&#39;ll think about incorporating a special day for each of them, besides their birthday. They would love it.<br/>
