<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045668520">***Sometimes a fart is truly hilarious.  During a prayer at a funeral it <br/>
would not be, no matter HOW gloriously it would echo on that wooden pew in <br/>
that vaulted church. Sandra***<br/>
<br/>
ROFL!!  I just have to share this!  A few weeks ago, my best girlfriend and  <br/>
went to Walmart in the midle of the night...alone!!!  We were in the toy <br/>
dept. and found the whoopie cushions.  Now, I don&#39;t normally find farts all <br/>
that funny...I have a husband that ruined THAT a loooong time ago &lt;snicker&gt;. <br/>
  But Beth laughs at them even when she is home alone and lets one slip.  <br/>
So, she dares me to hide the whoopie cushion under my armpit and walk around <br/>
the store &#39;farting&#39;.  Talk about feeling like a kid again!  So, I took her <br/>
up on it!<br/>
<br/>
Oh MY Garsh!  It was the funniest thing in the world!  I haven&#39;t let loose <br/>
(pun both intended and not &lt;g&gt;) like that since I was a kid!  Here we are, <br/>
two 28 yr old mothers of 10 combined, walking around Walmart making fart <br/>
noises.  I would even hike up my leg right in front of people.  Imagine the <br/>
stares!!!  She was cowering behind anything she could! LOL  So, just to make <br/>
it even MORE fun, I start squeezing and turn around and yell, BETH!!!  Oh, <br/>
she just died.<br/>
<br/>
On Easter, we were telling our families about it and her Dad couldn&#39;t <br/>
believe *I* would DO something like that!  My very conservative aunt was <br/>
just horrified.  Then, my cousin Anna, her daughter, starts laughing and <br/>
says, &quot;Golly Mom, I wish YOU would do fun stuff like that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, it&#39;s fun NOT to be such a mom all the time!<br/>

Now I am ROFLMAO!!  Okay, now you really have to visit!!  7 kids at <br/>
your age, bless your heart.  I am as old as you with 2 and will <br/>
complain about my load no longer..LOL!  Thanks for the story,  I <br/>
usually do not find Fart jokes funny, but I love goofy stuff.  I <br/>
would have been on the floor in the store, you are lucky you were not <br/>
with me!!<br/>
