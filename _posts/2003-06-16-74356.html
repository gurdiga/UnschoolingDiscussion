you into staying. NOW they&#39;re being jerks because they&#39;re really, really sad. <br/>
Neither is behavior you&#39;d expect from adults, but it does come from feelings. If <br/>
you can keep feeling happy you&#39;re going, and try not to punish them for <br/>
having been jerks, eventually they&#39;ll adjust and stop. They were mostly jerks <br/>
because that&#39;s what they know what to do, and they need and love you. <br/>

Where in NH are you moving, and from where?<br/>
