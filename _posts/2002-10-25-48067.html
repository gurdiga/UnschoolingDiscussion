&lt;&lt; Train &#39;em up to not feel the pain that we are inflicting on them. Break &#39;em<br/>

<br/>
I have seen the phrase &quot;break their wills&quot; used in reference to young <br/>
children many times.  Not lately.  But lots, in things written in the 60&#39;s <br/>
and before.<br/>
<br/>
So to the person whose mom told her she had loved her just the same as <br/>
[daughter] loved [grand daughter], I don&#39;t think so.  I think in 1950 if you <br/>
had a baby in the U.S. and you were Christian, especially Protestant, <br/>
especially Bible Belt, that you almost had no choice but to spank.  The <br/>
people around you wouldn&#39;t tolerate non-conformity.  And if babies were born <br/>
bad, sinful, and the first job was to break their wills, then what was left?  <br/>
Not a loveable child.  A broken child.<br/>
