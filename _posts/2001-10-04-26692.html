<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382384634">About math Sandra wrote &quot;its just naming ideas you already had&quot;.......I<br/>
absolutely love this and couldn&#39;t agree more.<br/>
<br/>
I always thought I just didn&#39;t get math or science.  The whole physics thing<br/>
threw me......then I watched Bill Nye and went Duh.  I understood physics<br/>
very well just didn&#39;t use the same words to describe things that the text<br/>
books did.  As soon as I realized that, I realized that could be true of so<br/>
many things....that I or the kids understood the concept in the real world,<br/>
just not the way that it is dissected in a &quot;curriculum&quot;.  Now I feel like<br/>
the world has opened up to me.<br/>
