I loved your email.  How proud you must be!  I have a 5 yr. old boy and hope <br/>
to see that sort of responsibility from him when he gets older.  I am still <br/>
researching all of the ways of homeschooling, so far I&#39;ve at least withdrawn <br/>
him from public school, which I did in Dec.  Through this list, I&#39;m hoping to <br/>
learn all I can about unschooling.  That is basically what I&#39;m doing now, but <br/>
it&#39;s more because I feel he&#39;s too young for anything more, at least as far as <br/>
structurism and curriculum go.   Sounds like you are doing a wonderful job, <br/>
don&#39;t forget to give yourself a big pat on the back.  :O)<br/>

Thanks for sharing your story! I needed to hear that today. I just got <br/>
drilled by my mom who thinks its &quot;horrible&quot; that I am &quot;letting&quot; my kids learn <br/>
&quot;nothing.&quot; She argued that with no curriculum they &quot;can&#39;t possibly be <br/>
learning a thing.&quot; It&#39;s so discouraging to not have her support. I feel <br/>
reassured after hearing your day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986819042">Oh my goodness. You&#39;ve hit a nerve here  :-)  I used to be one of the &quot;kill<br/>
your tv&quot; types. Where we used to live we got two channels without any cable,<br/>
and one of them was KCTS. Fine, they watch a couple shows a day, maybe a<br/>
movie thrown in there. They&#39;ve never been the kind of children that just sit<br/>
and do nothing for hours on end because they are watching the tv. Then,<br/>
after we got up to our new house and realized that you get NO reception here<br/>
without a huge antennae on your house or cable, we subscribed to cable. It<br/>
was so overwhelming at first, I cancelled it. No channels. The kids voiced<br/>
that they really did wish to see some of the shows they used to like. One of<br/>
them being a nature show, another being a KCTS show, just really neat things<br/>
that they wanted to see. SO, I got the cable hooked back up, and they do<br/>
fine with it. I have always monitored what they watch, as well as how long<br/>
they watch it for, and now when the show they want to watch is over, they<br/>
will just get up and turn off the tv. I just love it when they do that, I<br/>
think they have learned control and moderation.  I&#39;ve asked for so much<br/>
advice on this, and tried different &#39;things&#39; to really make an issue out of<br/>
regulating the tv, but my kids LOVE to read and will read for HOURS on end,<br/>
and play and work in their garden and do so many other things that I just<br/>
don&#39;t see the tv as being a problem anymore. Well, it&#39;s not a problem as<br/>
long as what they are watching is of good quality.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

 trying to do so with my boys that are 5 and 3.  &gt;&gt; snip<br/>
<br/>
I have always monitored the amount and quality of TV the kids watch for the <br/>
following reasons: 1. There are some things I consider harmful/inappropriate. <br/>
2. There are ususally better things to do. 3. Too much TV tends to get on my <br/>
nerves. This is particularly hard on my 10yoss, since he watches unlimited TV <br/>
and movies at his mom&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;- what kinds of things do you do on any given day, <br/>
 and how you engage your kids.  For example, do some of you leave materials <br/>
 around  for your kids to &quot;discover&quot;? Do you blend a bit of homeschooling <br/>
 structure into your unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m no expert, but here&#39;s what I do with my 9yodd. I leave out some things I <br/>
think she&#39;ll be interested in, and I usually take her current or recent <br/>
interests into consideration.  I sometimes make suggestions, which she takes <br/>
me up on about 75% of the time. I try to let her figure out how to use her <br/>
own free time, so she doesn&#39;t get stuck in the &quot;there&#39;s nothing to do&quot; <br/>
mentality which I had at that age. I used to have 3 structured hours in the <br/>
morning, but I find she does just as well without it. One thing I find really <br/>
gets my daughter&#39;s interested in something new and different is seeing *me* <br/>
interested and involved in it. This works well for things that she might not <br/>
otherwise be drawn to on her own. <br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

I limit my kids&#39; tv-viewing and computer use pretty strictly! Most days the <br/>
both are not in use at all. If they want to use either, I tell them their <br/>
chores have to be done plus extra and they feel like it is useless-what?extra <br/>
chores?!-and give up and think of something to play-card game, board game, <br/>
chess, dressup, figures, etc. <br/>

&gt; I have a lot to be proud of lately. Last Friday, my children did an act in<br/>
&gt; the Oregon homeschoolers Talent show. They are 9 and 10. My daughter was<br/>
&gt; scared to death, even cried before the show. (they are clowns) They have been<br/>
&gt; training the last year with a professional clown. I was not going to force<br/>
&gt; her to do the show, but I just behave calmly, like nerves are a part of<br/>
&gt; performing, which they are. Her brother was ready to go on and would have<br/>
&gt; been crushed had she decided not to. Plus, I knew she would have been<br/>
&gt; disappointed in herself if she hadn&#39;t. Well, they did it and the Triumphed!<br/>
&gt; (it wasn&#39;t a competition) But they were flawless... I was so proud of both of<br/>
&gt; them, but to be afraid like that then with a lift of the chin, do it<br/>
&gt; beautifully!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then today, I got up early to write and by 11 I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. I<br/>
&gt; went to bed and left the instructions that they could work on any type of<br/>
&gt; project they liked but had to clean the mess and no TV. I wondered briefly<br/>
&gt; what kind of shape the house would be in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I woke to the smell of Chocolate chip cookies. Upon sleepy investigation, I<br/>
&gt; realized that they had not only baked the cookies(perfectly) but had cleaned<br/>
&gt; the mess and the living room! WOW!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am so proud of them, they used problem solving skills, cooperation,<br/>
&gt; reading, math, and basic living skills, all without a single worksheet nor<br/>
&gt; any direction or cohersion from me:) LOL<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998686443">Hi Karen;<br/>
<br/>
I know lately there has been considerable discussion regarding the many <br/>
pitfalls of television.  I am keenly aware of the potential problems<br/>
associated with too much or inappropriate television viewing but I am<br/>
putting forward my voice in favour of supervised and<br/>
intelligently-managed TV.  I know when I grew up in the &#39;60&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s<br/>
my parents were VERY strict with my siblings and me with TV.  I learned<br/>
from that.  I am very pleased to see the amount and extent of<br/>
educational and informative programming that exists today.  When I was a<br/>
kid &quot;good TV&quot; was pretty much restricted to Jacque Cousteau specials. <br/>
Our family entertainment budget is spent on attending the occasional<br/>
Ballet or Symphony performance and cable hook-up.  Thankfully in my city<br/>
we have an EXCELLENT library program and our weekly visits to the local<br/>
library involve free rentals of choice videos.  Our family takes full<br/>
advantage of PBS programming (my science component on our unschooling<br/>
basically revolves around Magic School Bus and Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br/>
Kratt&#39;s Kreatures is another great program and we are regular viewers of<br/>
the Discovery/Learning/History channels. It&#39;s also unbelievable what my<br/>
kids have picked up geography/anthropology/social studies-wise with the<br/>
Food Network!!!  So my kids do watch a couple of hours of TV every day. <br/>
And I think it has been extremely valuable.  Often their curiosity has<br/>
been perked by some subject from a program they&#39;ve seen and we follow up<br/>
with research at the library thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
As well, we do have books galore, art supplies and various recycled<br/>
materials about the house that the kids have an outlet when the creative<br/>
juices flow.<br/>
<br/>
I think every homeschooling family has an individual resource that makes<br/>
their situation unique.  I know of at least a half dozen professional<br/>
teachers who unschool and obviously they have a talent their children<br/>
can benefit from.  I am a freelance photographer and get an assignment<br/>
every couple of weeks.  I&#39;ve been very fortunate to bring my children<br/>
along on just about every assignment and as a result they have been<br/>
exposed to every imaginable individual in the community. They are now<br/>
10yr, 7yr and 18mo.  They&#39;ve met artists, inventors, scientists,<br/>
newsmakers, celebrities, authors, sports personalities, younameit.  I<br/>
think that experience alone is enough to give them a well-rounded<br/>
educational background and get them thinking about what intrigues and<br/>
stimulates them.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I haven&#39;t bored you with too much information about us!<br/>
<br/>

 I am so proud of them, they used problem solving skills, cooperation, <br/>
 reading, math, and basic living skills, all without a single worksheet nor <br/>
 any direction or cohersion from me:) LOL &gt;&gt;<br/>
and they did all this without waking you up too!  Now this part<br/>
I like LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160868866">&lt;&lt; I was wondering if you or any one else on this list monitors<br/>
 and limits the amount of tv watched in your home on a daily basis.  I am<br/>
 trying to do so with my boys that are 5 and 3.  &gt;&gt; snip<br/>
<br/>
I, too, monitor my dd&#39;s watching of the box.  We&#39;ve found that she&#39;ll sit<br/>
for hours in front of the tv sometimes almost in a trance.  (I&#39;d worry, but<br/>
she&#39;s that way about reading and other things as well.)  She watches HGTV,<br/>
Animal Planet, TLC, Discovery Channel, Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune and Who<br/>
Wants to Be a Millionaire.  This occurs maybe a total of 2-3 hrs per week<br/>
every 2 weeks or so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290770419">hi,<br/>
<br/>
we have only one kid,  i just miscarried or we would be having more.  rene&#39;<br/>
(our 4 1/2 yo) was hoping for 3 sets of twins (2 boys, 2 girls, and 1 boy & 1<br/>
girl) lol,  but he&#39;s accepted the possibility of us not having anymore rather<br/>
well ( i&#39;m now 40 and i have an autoimmune disease that just won&#39;t leave :)<br/>
<br/>
on socialization, our son had virtual no socialization because we had just move<br/>
here (c.tx) from n.ca a few months before he was born and didn&#39;t really have<br/>
any friends, then i got sick (3 years ago rene&#39; was 20 months) and because our<br/>
extended family lives 1500+ mile away he doesn&#39;t spend much time with them.  we<br/>
just joined the local hs group last september and we go to park days once a<br/>
week the rest of our time we hang together.  our focus has been on book<br/>
knowledge rather than nature and physical activities because of my physical<br/>
situation.  rene&#39; doesn&#39;t seem to be suffering though i&#39;ve felt guilty for the<br/>
first 2 1/2 yrs of my illness now it&#39;s just our life and we&#39;re here to have fun<br/>
with exactly what we have and for the most part we do (though self pity does<br/>
rear its ugly little head from time to time:)<br/>
<br/>
i can see what your saying about cable i would be like your son &lt;g&gt;  we&#39;ve<br/>
never gotten it because there are too many shows (though i wish i could pick<br/>
only one or two channels then maybe i would reconsider it).  we really rely on<br/>
tv which doesn&#39;t make me happy but we make the best of it and have fun doing<br/>
it.  there are pros and cons to everything.<br/>

I understand about the guilt thing.  One of the biggest struggles I&#39;ve had <br/>
with my lupus is dealing with the constant guilt about not being able to do <br/>
everything I would like to do with the kids.  In my head, I know better but <br/>
in my heart I still feel like I&#39;m letting them down.  I have to remind myself <br/>
to snap out of it often.  My DH reminds me if I forget!  LOL  It sounds like <br/>
you have a good perspective on it now.  You&#39;re right though, that ugly self <br/>
pity does appear once in a while.  I usually let myself wallow in it for a <br/>
short time until it becomes too maudlin and then I feel better for quite <br/>
awhile.    Chocolate is enormously helpful.  <br/>

<br/>
my dh does the same for me &lt;g&gt;  its taken a long time for me to accept this as<br/>
really happening because i had pretty fixed ideas about my life, and what<br/>
parenting and hs would be like and getting sick and incapacitated at 37 didn&#39;t<br/>
figure into it:) flexibility is important but a certain degree of indulgence<br/>
both emotional and physical really help lol.<br/>
