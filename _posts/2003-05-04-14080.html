<div id="ygrps-yiv-916447665">Holly has probably had breakfast by now - it&#39;s 9 am on the west coast.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed rice and tofu for breakfast.  Good with a little soy sauce or toasted & salted sunflower seeds.<br/>
<br/>
French toast or toast with peanut butter instead of syrup or other sweet topping.<br/>
<br/>
Leftovers from recent dinners.<br/>
<br/>
Any food that would normally be thought of as lunch or supper food.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe check out a macrobiotic cook book for some ideas for something different for breakfast.<br/>

know this sounds weird, but it&#39;s really good:  oatmeal (or other <br/>

Clearly you are good at thinking outside of the box -- even when the box<br/>
is tall and cylindrical. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

for as long as I can remember!  Actually my ds Sam was our early bird <br/>
and he usually was up and had eaten a bowl of cereal before any of us <br/>
were out of bed.<br/>
We never bring lunch to our park days because we meet at noon and we <br/>
have all just finished breakfast!  Everyone else shows up with <br/>
lunches.<br/>
I bring a snack and drinks.  <br/>
