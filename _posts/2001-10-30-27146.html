<div id="ygrps-yiv-821489895">I find your responses fascinating!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t/didn&#39;t many of us have kids waking and crying about planes flying<br/>
in the sky, asking questions like why is our country bombing another<br/>
country, why did this happen to us, why are so many people losing their<br/>
jobs now, is our country the best country in the world, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
How do you answer them and what sources do you use for your<br/>
information?  I can certainly understand that you may have limited (or<br/>
no) interest in personal opinions posted but I think we can all learn<br/>
from the sources referenced.  And as we learn more, we may even be able<br/>
to answer our children&#39;s questions with better information which must<br/>
have something to do with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, you could just pick and choose what to read here by subject<br/>
line.<br/>

&gt; &gt; When I joined this list, I thought that we would be talking about<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling!  How silly of me........I cannot believe there are so<br/>
&gt; &gt; many here<br/>
&gt; &gt; who think so badly of our country!  In many countries, you would<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; this choice.  Of course this country is not perfect, but YES, it is<br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; far<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best country in the world.  Every other nation and country in<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; world<br/>
&gt; &gt; recognize this fact, this is why after only a couple hundred years<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; existence, we are a super power.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Could we please cut this thread and get back to the reason we all<br/>
&gt; here<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the one subject we can mostly all agree on, Unschooling!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
