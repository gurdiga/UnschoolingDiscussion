pictures in my mind before seeing the movie. I also tried to read books to <br/>
the kids before they saw the movie for the same reason, but I never made a <br/>
big deal out of it. I certainly didn&#39;t forbid it.<br/>

&gt;Tolkien before she could drive a car.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, my older son, the one who was in the middle reading group in <br/>
grade two, read The Hobbit a few months after I took him out of school. He <br/>
wasn&#39;t 8 yet. (And he still doesn&#39;t have his driver&#39;s license at 25.) Come <br/>
to think of it, *I* read those books when I was about 14, so you know two <br/>
more. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told Noah&#39;s story here. He had really poor fine motor <br/>
control. He had a choice that year (grade 2). He could take his time and <br/>
really make his work neat . . . and get in trouble for not finishing on <br/>
time, or he could get it finished on time . . . and watch the teacher throw <br/>
it into the wastebasket for being messy. I took him out of school at <br/>
Christmas. At the time he never read for pleasure, only if it was required. <br/>
They had watched the video of Charlotte&#39;s Web that last day at school. <br/>
After school I handed him the book, thinking he might enjoy the original <br/>
illustrations. He read almost the whole book that afternoon and evening. <br/>
The evening part was at a noisy party we went to. This is the kid who <br/>
couldn&#39;t concentrate in class. He read another couple of books at that <br/>
level, then read The Hobbit and started Fellowship. His teacher had *no <br/>
idea* that he could read that well because he couldn&#39;t handle the written, <br/>
prove-you-read-it, work.<br/>
<br/>
I came as close as I could to unschooling him with my unsupportive ex <br/>
breathing down my back until the beginning of grade 4. At that point I was <br/>
8 months pregnant, and the ex threatened me with court if I didn&#39;t put him <br/>
back in school. I couldn&#39;t see how I was going to manage a court case with <br/>
a nursing infant, and Noah didn&#39;t want me to fight it anymore, so I put him <br/>
in school. After a year he went to live with the ex. I often wonder how he <br/>
would have turned out if he hadn&#39;t gone back to school. In my opinion he <br/>
was beginning to thrive at home. As it is, he lives in a tent in the bush <br/>
and dumpster-dives for a &quot;living&quot;. He got as far as grade 9 before dropping <br/>
out.<br/>

Hi, Sandra --<br/>
<br/>
Parents that I know that are insisting on &quot;books before movie&quot; are <br/>
reading the Tolkien books to their kids.  But still it is quite controlling.<br/>
<br/>
(I personally think that I want to read Master and Commander before I <br/>
see the Russell Crowe movie, but I reserve the right to change my mind <br/>
if I suddenly find a babysitter.)<br/>
<br/>
My parents read the 4 Tolkien books to me when I was nineish.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
read the books to my son, but we enjoyed the movies a lot (watching them <br/>
at home because we are easilly scared.)  My son has even decided that <br/>
he&#39;s old enough to watch the third movie in the theater.<br/>
<br/>
We are counting the days until Return of the King comes out in December. <br/>
(Or will be -- we&#39;ve been counting down the days until Halloween.  It&#39;s <br/>
today!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, he watched the Harry Potter #1 movie before I read him any of the <br/>
books, and he still wanted all the books read to him 4 or 5 times.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think the movie version affected his enjoyment of the books at <br/>
all, um, unless it increased his enjoyment.<br/>

I read The Lord of the Rings at 13. Skived off school for 2 days to <br/>
finish it. Didn&#39;t learn to drive till I was 23. Heather read LoTR at <br/>
7-9. She can&#39;t drive either and hates cars.<br/>

<br/>
Both Harry Potter and LOTR are careful on the visuals, and so for me it makes <br/>
the books easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
I had pictures in my head from Lord of the Rings as a teen, but they were <br/>
very vague pictures. Then there were the Hildebrandt calendars and posters.  That <br/>
helped some.  But I like Peter Jackson&#39;s artistic vision.  I just think he <br/>
should have left Faramir as honorable and intelligent as he was in the book.  <br/>
Still, he LOOKED marvelous! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter reads much more merrily for me now with the actors&#39; faces and <br/>
voices in my head.<br/>

unfortunately inherited a tendency toward paranoia and/or <br/>

me right now. He was into a really paranoid spell, and I wasn&#39;t buying into <br/>
it. I didn&#39;t say that what he thought was happening wasn&#39;t. I just didn&#39;t <br/>
get all worked up about it as though it was. His dad did. So right now <br/>
