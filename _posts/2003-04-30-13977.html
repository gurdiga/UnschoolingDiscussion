<div id="ygrps-yiv-925354212">I have recived this on a few list i belong to. So I couldnt resit <br/>
resending it to you. <br/>
When I first got it it was after we had just got two rabbits. I got <br/>
the franic phone call at work  to inform me that one of my  male <br/>
rabbits had  a baby  showing  and  or it had a sudden growth my 18 <br/>
year old was in tears and my husband  didnt know what to do and  my <br/>
12 year old and 18 year old ran it up to my work wanting me to close <br/>
the store and run them to the vet,in the middle of a convence store I <br/>
had  a lesson in rabbit anatomny  with the vet on the phone.( Just to <br/>
note when a male rabbit gets to warm and or excited there testie <br/>
drop.) how ever the  other &quot;male&quot; was a female and we had little  <br/>
babie lops.<br/>
  So when  I got this in  a list that night or the next i  was laffin <br/>
so hard I woke my hubby up. <br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Overview: I had to take my son&#39;s hamster to the vet. Here&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>what <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; happened: <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there <br/>
 </span></blockquote>was <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;something wrong&quot; with one of the two hamsters he holds <br/>
 </span></blockquote>prisoner in <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; his <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; room. &quot;He&#39;s just lying there looking sick,&quot; he told me. &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; serious, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dad. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can you help?&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I put my best hamster-healer statement on my face and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>followed him <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying <br/>
 </span></blockquote>on his <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;back, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do. &quot;Honey,&quot; I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>called, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&quot;come <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; look at the hamster!&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Oh my gosh,&quot; my wife diagnosed after a minute. &quot;She&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>having <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; babies.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;What?&quot; my son demanded. &quot;But their names are Bert and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ernie, Mom!&quot; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I was equally outraged. &quot;Hey, how can that be? I thought we <br/>
 </span></blockquote>said we <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; want them to reproduce,&quot; I accused my wife. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their <br/>
 </span></blockquote>cage?&quot; she <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; inquired. (I actually think she said this sarcastically!) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;No, but you were supposed to get two boys!&quot; I reminded her, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(in my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth <br/>
 </span></blockquote>together). <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Yeah, Bert and Ernie!&quot; my son agreed. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Well, it&#39;s just a little hard to tell on some guys, you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>know,&quot; she <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; informed me. (Again with the sarcasm, you think?) By now the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>rest of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>deciding <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; make <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the best of it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience, I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>announced. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;We&#39;re about to witness the miracle of birth.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;OH, Gross!&quot;, they shrieked. &quot;Well, isn&#39;t THAT just Great!; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>what are <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>my wife <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wanted <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to know. (I really do think she was being snotty here, too. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you?) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked <br/>
 </span></blockquote>like a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tiny <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; foot <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. &quot;We <br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; appear <br/>
&gt; &gt;to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; making much progress,&quot; I noted. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Its breech,&quot; my wife whispered, horrified. &quot;Do something, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dad!&quot; my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; son urged. &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; Squeamishly, I reached in and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>grabbed the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; foot <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; when <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it next appeared, giving it a gingerly tug. It disappeared. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;several <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more times with the same results. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Should I call 911?&quot; my eldest daughter wanted to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>know. &quot;Maybe they <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could talk us through the trauma.&quot; (You see a pattern here <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;females <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in my house?) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s get Ernie to the vet,&quot; I said grimly. We drove to the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>vet <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with my son holding the cage in his lap. Breathe, Ernie, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>breathe,&quot; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; urged. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think hamsters do Lamaze,&quot; his mother noted to him. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(Women <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can be so cruel to their own young. I mean what she does to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>me is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; one <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thing, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but this boy is of her womb, for God&#39;s sake.) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; little animal through a magnifying glass. &quot;What do you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>think, Doc, a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; c-section?&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I suggested scientifically. &quot;Oh, very interesting,&quot; he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>murmured. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>moment?&quot; I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; gulped, <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nodding for my son to step outside. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Is Ernie going to be okay?&quot; my wife asked. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, perfectly,&quot; the vet assured us. &quot;This hamster is not in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>labor. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, that isn&#39;t EVER going to happen... Ernie is a boy.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;What?&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;You see, Ernie is a young male. And occasionally, as they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>come into <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; maturity, like most male species, they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>um....um....masturbate. Just <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;way <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; he did, lying on his back.&quot; He blushed, glancing at my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wife. &quot;Well, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; know <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; what I&#39;m saying, Mr.Cameron.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; We were silent, absorbing this. &quot;So Ernie&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>just...just...Excited,&quot; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; my wife offered. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Exactly,&quot; the vet replied, relieved that we understood. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>More <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; silence. Then my viscous, cruel wife started to giggle. And <br/>
 </span></blockquote>giggle. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; then <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; even laugh loudly. &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; I demanded, knowing, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but not <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; believing <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;flawless <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manliness. Tears were now running down her face. &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt;just...that...I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; picturing you pulling on its... its...teeny little...&quot; she <br/>
 </span></blockquote>gasped <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; air to bellow in laughter once more. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;That&#39;s enough,&quot; I warned. We thanked the Veterinarian and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hurriedly <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car. He was <br/>
 </span></blockquote>glad <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; everything <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; was going to be okay. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;I know Ernie&#39;s really thankful for what you&#39;ve done, Dad,&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he told <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; me. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Oh, you have NO idea,&quot; my wife agreed, collapsing with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>laughter. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2 - Hamsters - 10 bucks... <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
