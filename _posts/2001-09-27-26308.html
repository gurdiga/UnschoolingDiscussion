&gt; I&#39;m so glad you brought up that point. I still struggle with this  one.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I keep <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; getting the fear/feeling that I&#39;m supposed to be sending my son to  all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; group stuff that we can afford. Like I&#39;m harming him by us being <br/>
 </span></blockquote>together and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not sending him away for other activities. Even though he seems very <br/>
 </span></blockquote>happy.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And comments from family like &#39;it&#39;s a fine line between mother and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>smother&#39; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sure don&#39;t help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brenda<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I felt that guilt (for about five minutes) then my kids made it very<br/>
clear that they did not care whether they &#39;socialized&#39; with other kids or<br/>
not.  If there is a hermit gene, we have it.  My dh and I were both<br/>
loners in school, so we are not surprised by their attitudes about<br/>
hanging out with other kids.  What has been a pleasant surprise is the<br/>
fact that the girls have the ability to chat with perfect strangers of<br/>
any age.  They don&#39;t just hole up and become wallflowers when we are out.<br/>
 We go to museums and science centers together alot, sans group, and they<br/>
will often pick up conversations with the people working there, with<br/>
other parent, with other kids, etc.  I think that is because they have<br/>
not been forced into those artificial age segregated play groups.<br/>

homeschool group.  We tried a few and my kids like doing stuff but are<br/>
just as happy doing it with just us.   Rachel is 16, Jenni is 14 and they<br/>
would never dream of wanting to go back to school.  I think a lot depends<br/>
on the type kid you have (they are all different) and only you can answer<br/>
that question.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not exactly the opposite POV.  Your kids are happy mainly relating to <br/>
family members.  They don&#39;t seem to need much contact outside the <br/>
family.  Mine does, and the available contacts all go to school.  Hence his <br/>
desire to go to school.  My point was more that if a kid needs that kind of <br/>
outside contact, you might want to try to arrange it with other <br/>
homeschoolers if you&#39;re hoping to hs all the way through.<br/>
