<div id="ygrps-yiv-874113941">&quot;Its seems that some of the most popular books out thier about<br/>
homeschooling that talk mostly about kids that are gifted (atleasts<br/>
thats how I percieve it).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure who originally wrote this.  But reading it raised two<br/>
questions in my mind:<br/>
<br/>
First, to what books are you referring?  I&#39;m scouring the globe<br/>
(metaphorically speaking) for books on homeschooling that aren&#39;t so<br/>
limited to the mid-curve that they&#39;re utterly useless for my gifted<br/>
son.  I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve not yet ventured into the &quot;family memoir&quot;<br/>
sub-genre; I&#39;ve been focussing my attention on those that are written as<br/>
guides, or collections of tips, or resource directories, as collecting<br/>
enough material to keep a rich environment at his ever-changing level is<br/>
more relevant to me than reading about someone else&#39;s experience at the<br/>
moment.  The books I&#39;ve seen are packed with tips on &quot;age appropriate&quot;<br/>
activities that are not the least appropriate for him--either because he<br/>
can&#39;t physically perform the indicated action until he&#39;s long past being<br/>
interested in the intended lesson, or because he&#39;s just not engaged by<br/>
what&#39;s aimed at the sensibilities of a child 2-3 times his age.  They<br/>
prominently feature &quot;developmental timetables&quot; that resemble nothing<br/>
that will EVER happen in this house.  They burgeon with guidelines on<br/>
how to reinforce information in which he is just becoming deeply<br/>
interested by referencing &quot;everyday&quot; concepts which are familiar to a<br/>
child at the &quot;right age&quot; for learning X, Y, and Z. . .but totally<br/>
foreign to my son, who already knows X, has a reasonable grasp of Y, and<br/>
is doggedly pursuing an understanding of Z without benefit of said<br/>
reinforcement.  The books I most often see lauded as indispensable on<br/>
homeschooling mailing lists typically prove to hold little utility for<br/>
us, BECAUSE my son is gifted.  My observation up to this point has been<br/>
that the literature (even when it purports to cover the full spectrum)<br/>
is heavily weighted toward children in the middle ranges of the IQ<br/>
chart, and that anyone whose child(ren) fall into that range has a much,<br/>
much broader pool of relevant resources on which to draw.  I would truly<br/>
LOVE to get a booklist from you that would alter that perception.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, what makes you so sure the kids mentioned in those books are<br/>
gifted?  I mean, do their authors say, &quot;Sarah, a gifted nine-year-old,<br/>
has learnt to play Mozart on the violin. . .&quot;, or are you assuming that<br/>
Sarah MUST be gifted in order to have done so?  If the latter, I&#39;m<br/>
somewhat confused.  If you&#39;re going to assign the title &quot;gifted&quot; to<br/>
every high achiever, doesn&#39;t that guarantee that, definitionally, no<br/>
non-gifted child will ever BE a high achiever, no matter what they do,<br/>
and, therefore, that every book that mentions achievement WILL be about<br/>
a gifted child?  It sounds like circular logic to me.  If the books ARE<br/>
about gifted children explicitly, well, O.K., so why feel inadequate?  I<br/>
don&#39;t remember the basketball coach at my old highschool ever looking<br/>
out at a room full of 5&#39;10&quot; and under sophomores who couldn&#39;t hit a<br/>
three-point shot to save their lives and saying, &quot;If I don&#39;t produce an<br/>
NBA all-star in this group, I&#39;ll know I&#39;m a rotten coach.&quot;  I doubt<br/>
reading a biography of Shaquille O&#39;Neal would make him do so.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that your true complaint has nothing to do with giftedness, but<br/>
is about achievement and the pressure to achieve, which is an ENTIRELY<br/>
different, and at best tangentially related, issue.  Moreover, the<br/>
pressure seems to be something you&#39;re generating yourself, which<br/>
certainly can&#39;t be blamed on those who homeschool gifted kids or those<br/>
who write about them.  Those books (whatever they may be) which inspired<br/>
your complaint trouble you because you compare your child(ren)&#39;s (and by<br/>
extension your own) ACHIEVEMENT to that of the children (and parents)<br/>
mentioned in them.  So, don&#39;t.  I know that may seem flippant, but it&#39;s<br/>
just a straightforward acknowledgment of the only solution to the<br/>
problem.  You decide what you concentrate on.  My son will not excel in<br/>
everything.  He will not even ever dip into most things--no one could.<br/>
Such is the nature of our world, so richly diverse that a hundred<br/>
lifetimes will not permit us to experience its every facet.  Do I weep<br/>
that he might never be a banana farmer?  Does it trouble me that he may<br/>
have been born without the capacity to someday stand as one of history&#39;s<br/>
greatest pearl-divers?  Do I worry that I must be a poor mother and a<br/>
worse teacher if he reaches adulthood lacking the skills to be a<br/>
snakecharmer?  Of course not.  He&#39;s him, and entirely sufficient in<br/>
himself.  If I teach him that, and help him acquire the skills to make<br/>
his life what he wants it to be, I will have done an unimpeachable job<br/>
of raising AND teaching him, no matter what he does or doesn&#39;t achieve<br/>
in the eyes of others.  And they can write all the books they want about<br/>
anything they want without altering that simple fact.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658359744">A Child&#39;s Work by Nacy Wallace: Describes not genius<br/>
children but much more advanced at an early age<br/>
children than mine so far. 4 yr old Vera &quot;writing&quot;<br/>
poems independently. Both children fairly young being<br/>
musically gifted. <br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling for Excellence by the Colfaxes: 3 of<br/>
their for son&#39;s went Harvard or Yale can&#39;t remember.<br/>
<br/>
The Skylark Sings with Me by David: One child learned<br/>
to play the piano at 2yrs. Another has been suggested<br/>
to be gifted.<br/>
<br/>
I have yeat to read except in GWS about normal<br/>
everyday kids. BUT and I say a big but I don&#39;t really<br/>
like labeling it that.<br/>
<br/>
I really like Howard Gardner&#39;s (used to be 7 but) 8<br/>
intelligences. I think Thomas Armstrong wrote a book a<br/>
little more accessible for me about the intelligences.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I would love is maybe we could do a thread on our<br/>
kids if you feel like sharing about what they are<br/>
doing. Maybe if we get others looking from the outside<br/>
we might see what our children are doing from another<br/>
perspective. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am looking to the future to much. I have young<br/>
 kids. I am very pleased with unschooling. I actually<br/>
want my kids to be unconventional. I will probably<br/>
have harder time with it if they want to be a doctor.<br/>
Not really but yes.<br/>
<br/>
I get giddy watching my kids learn. Yesterday dd asked<br/>
her dad &quot;what is 3+3+3+3 make?&quot; Dad paused for a bit<br/>
then dd had her own answer &quot;I know is 6+6.&quot; So here is<br/>
my 5 yrold learning the basics of math without any<br/>
instruction. <br/>
<br/>
I know yesterday she did so many things that was<br/>
&#39;learning&#39; / what would have been &#39;instructed<br/>
learning&#39; in a school in about 1 hour. Yet I also know<br/>
she is learning every minute things I don&#39;t even see.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Samantha<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi! I&#39;m new to this list, but just wanted to comment....Books or articles by<br/>
unschoolers do often mention all the great things/learning that the children<br/>
are doing. However, this seems to me to be a natural result of interacting<br/>
with your children and really seeing them - I know that if I am doing this,<br/>
then  I *am* amazed at all my children learn/do/are interested in. But if I<br/>
fall victim to the curriculum monster, I then focus on what they can&#39;;to do,<br/>
their messy handwriting or poor spelling, that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
So, if I was writing about my children in my unschooling cap, I guess they<br/>
*would* sound gifted because I am enjoying them and  perceiving them as<br/>
interesting people.  They are the same - it is my perception that is<br/>
different! Oh, does this make sense? :-)<br/>
