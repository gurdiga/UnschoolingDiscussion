<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439031921">Hi, Folks!!!  Look, I&#39;m a totally sleep deprived person, having been in the <br/>
recording studio all week this week and having only gotten no more than 3 <br/>
hours of sleep each night all week and mostly only 2 hours (like this <br/>
morning).  I&#39;m gonna get some sleep tonight and that will be a good thing, <br/>
but in the meantime, I saw today&#39;s &quot;Dear Abby,&quot; and one item begs a <br/>
response from an informed person whose neurons are firing and not all soggy <br/>
and damp.  I have pasted the unfortunate thing here.  Swallow whatever your <br/>
drinking now so you don&#39;t spit your beverage out all over your keyboard and <br/>
monitor.   Ready?  Here goes:<br/>

<br/>
DEAR ABBY: I am an 11th-grade girl, and I need your advice on what to tell <br/>
my parents when my report card comes in June. My GPA has dropped big-time <br/>
since the last one, and they have both been nagging me to study harder.<br/>
<br/>
My mom and dad don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like for me at school. Keeping my <br/>
grades up has become more difficult because I don&#39;t have the motivation to <br/>
immerse myself in the mandatory curriculum. I have no need whatsoever for <br/>
those boring academic requirements.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I&#39;m good at is art -- drawing and painting -- and I can do <br/>
that on my own. Sometimes I wonder why I need high school at all. I&#39;d love <br/>
to have a break from it. How can I clue my parents in to what I&#39;m all <br/>
about, Abby? -- FRUSTRATED TEEN IN VERMONT<br/>
<br/>
DEAR FRUSTRATED TEEN: I suspect your parents are going to know what you are <br/>
all about once they see your report card. Every student, at one time or <br/>
another, has had the same feelings. But the smart ones accept the reality <br/>
that in order to succeed and be independent, they must, at the very least, <br/>
have a high school (or equivalent) diploma. The time to get it is now. So <br/>
buckle down in your senior year and lift your grade point average. Art <br/>
schools require well-rounded students.<br/>

I wish one could write directly to &quot;Frustrated Teen&quot; and her &quot;Frustrating <br/>
Parents.&quot;<br/>
