&lt;&lt; I&#39;m in south FL and the only naked people I see aside from my house is an <br/>
 occasional naked baby at the beach for about 30 seconds while the parent is <br/>
 changing it. Meaning out of bathing suit into clothes. Other than that, no <br/>
 naked kids aren&#39;t a regular sight around here. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Come on up to Northern Florida Mary...Jalen is usually naked at the beach!!<br/>
Mostly, if they want to run nude, it&#39;s done at home though.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m very surprised there&#39;s no more nudity in FL. Really! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well it&#39;s illegal here just like everywhere else, but I do see nekkie <br/>
toddlers here and there.<br/>
 I always see thongs or topless women at the beach, EVERY summer. So I don&#39;t <br/>
see how southern FL could be that different from where I am. But that&#39;s not <br/>
technically nekkid.<br/>

Well we have quite a stretch of beach we frequent here where we live. I have <br/>
never seen a topless woman or a child *running around on the beach* naked. I <br/>
have seen it at the nude beach I frequented years and years ago and also at <br/>
South Beach which caters more to the out of country tourists who may very <br/>
well be use to that where they live. But the stretch of beach where you can <br/>
do that is limited and marked. I have seen thongs on the beach but not <br/>
really that many.<br/>
