&lt;&lt; Having an oldest child who was also<br/>
<br/>
absent-minded was one of the best things for that part of our marriage.  It<br/>
<br/>
made us both realize that dh&#39;sabsent-mindedness wasn&#39;t something voluntary -<br/>
<br/>
it was just part of him.  And I relaxed about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to accuse Keith of giving me a dirty look and he would deny it.<br/>
<br/>
Within the first hour of Kirby&#39;s life, I apologized to Keith, because this <br/>
tiny newborn baby had given me the very same dirty look.  It was just a look, a <br/>
face-at-rest or -thought look that Keith really didn&#39;t mean, but I might not <br/>
have believed it ever if Kirby hadn&#39;t had it.<br/>
<br/>
Holly rarely procrastinates.  Kirby does.  Marty does some and some.  Holly <br/>
reminds Marty of lots of things.<br/>

a son? What&#39;s the difference?<br/>

other. Sandra and others gave examples of themselves both reminding and <br/>
being reminded.<br/>
