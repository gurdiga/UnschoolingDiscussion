<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274828345">Thanks to the folks who offered suggestions and advice last night with the <br/>
confounding mystery affliction that JP had.   The Dr said it was just jock <br/>
itch.  I pointed out that all the information I read stated that jock itch is <br/>
usually not on the penis or the scrotum... JP has this rash all over his <br/>
scrotum and the base of his penis.   Doc said that its USUALLY not in those <br/>
areas, but he still felt like it was just an external fungal problem.   <br/>
Lotriminn AF to the rescue!   He&#39;s been creamed up and  now we are hoping it <br/>
starts to clear up soon.   After the Dr diagnosing him with jock itch, I <br/>
started thinking.. .. Well, we WERE at the Beach last week.. JP DID sit <br/>
around in wet swimming trunks a lot.. He DID sit in wet sand for long periods <br/>
of time.. Hmmm,  yeah.. sounds about right for &quot;jock itch enviroment&quot;.. LOL.. <br/>
He does have very sensitive skin, I guess I was just freaked out because I <br/>
was relating the allergy/cold symtoms and his fever to the groin area <br/>
problem.. In reality, the two were not related at all.  His allergies are <br/>
clearing up too, so all in all, he&#39;s feeling much better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236587477">Glad it was minor.  I had athlete&#39;s foot lately for the first time ever, had <br/>
NO idea what it was, and thought I was dying of leprosy or who knows what.  <br/>
Keith and Marty calmly said, &quot;Oh yeah.  That,&quot; and brought me medicine which <br/>
worked.<br/>

<br/>
Anything that calls the white blood cells to work on it leaves the rest of <br/>
the body more vulnerable, so I figure in a way the two could be related.  Maybe <br/>
he wouldn&#39;t have gotten that if he hadn&#39;t had the cold.  <br/>
<br/>
Fever blisters, for example, aren&#39;t caused by having colds directly, but if <br/>
you HAVE cold or flu, your normal preventative resources aren&#39;t at full power.<br/>

none of the men/boys in my family have ever had jock itch.  But a young man that <br/>
I go to school with, we finished up our final project today and I was telling <br/>
him about the &quot;rash ordeal&quot; and he was like Mary and Keith with the atheletes <br/>
foot.. He said, yep, that sounds like jock itch, very matter of fact and no <br/>
big deal.  I thought, heck, you could have saved me the Dr bill.. lol<br/>
