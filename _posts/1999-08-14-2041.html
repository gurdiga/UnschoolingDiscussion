  We too bring home usually 30+<br/>
books from the library every couple of weeks, plus CD-ROMs and music CDs.  I<br/>
usually look for a few specific books from our running list, and then gather<br/>
the rest randomly.  I enjoy browsing through the<br/>
recently-returned-but-not-back-on-the-shelf-yet carts of our library Debbie</div>
