stick around to see the good days....and there&#39;s some good stuff sprinkled in <br/>
between the religion posts.If you just hit your delete key and be patient I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520344787">At the risk of breaking the two week lurk rule, I would like to say that I am so glad to see &quot;off topic&quot; discussions are allowed here. I am on some lists where the slightest stray from the purpose of the list is scolded and I hate that.<br/>
I&#39;ll shut up and lurk now:)<br/>
