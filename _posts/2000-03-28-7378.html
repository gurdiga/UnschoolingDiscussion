<div><font size="2">Dear fellow Home/unschoolers,&nbsp;&nbsp; This topic is very 
important to our familiy , too.&nbsp; I think it was Brooke that mentioned the 
barage of advertisement in New Zealand. Well, we here in the states are also 
Bombarded with&nbsp; advertising.&nbsp; Unfortunately even our PBS is picking up 
corporate sponsers, and doing more and more advertising.&nbsp; It really gets to 
me, personally the quality or should I say LACK OF in our television 
programming..especially on the other 4 channels we get..it is surprising to me 
the types of shows they show during daytime, and family time for viewing.&nbsp; 
The constant disrepect of women &amp; all people, and war &amp; fighting &amp; 
toy advertising...is outrageous. We have limited, and supervised viewing, simply 
because we don&#39;t want the exposure to things that are alterior to our goals in 
teaching our child Love &amp; respect.&nbsp; We Do however find much enjoyment 
in a vast array of programming on PBS.&nbsp; They just have alot of great shows, 
and programs.&nbsp; But we do not get cable or anything, and pbs is actually the 
ONLY channel we watch.&nbsp; Occasionally we rent a movie...but that&#39;s about 
it.&nbsp; We don&#39;t even have a color t.v. We have a very ancient, and small 
black and white.....My husbands Mother sent us a huge T.V. as a gift once..we 
were so glad to get rid of it....we gave it away...we really didn&#39;t want this 
huge box in our home, taking up all that space, and time.&nbsp; We often go days 
without turning&nbsp;our t.v. on at all.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want my son to be 
desensitized, or myself&nbsp; for that matter.&nbsp; But I Just Love Dragon 
Tails.(LOL)&nbsp;I think the most rewarding and educational activities we do is 
go to the woods, and hike or have&nbsp; picnic, and camping &amp; 
gardening.&nbsp; These are the things that foster a Love of the environment, 
that I see in our son so much...like the other day, when we went outside in the 
backyard, and he sais..&quot; I love the grass, I love the sky, I love the 
trees...Isn&#39;t it beautiful, MOM?&quot;&nbsp; Now That&#39;s quality 
programming&nbsp;:grins: Michelle</font></div></html></div>
