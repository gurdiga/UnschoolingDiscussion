<br/>
I&#39;ve also been focusing on some garbage in my life lately. blch.<br/>
<br/>
however! I got my hubby a GPS unit for his b-day, and we&#39;re going to <br/>
start Geo-cacheing. Gonna be fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522526922">We started geocaching a few months ago and it has been great.  The kids love<br/>
finding the treasure and they actually want to go for hikes now!  We also<br/>
just got some travel bugs and will be releasing them sometime soon.  It&#39;s<br/>
really fun to look for geocaches while traveling because it gets you out to<br/>
places you might not have seen otherwise (even works in your own home<br/>
town!).<br/>
<br/>
Happy geocaching!<br/>

It&#39;s free and no start up except for a stamper and maybe a compass. You go<br/>
hiking and find little boxes with stampers inside that others hide. You<br/>
stamp your stamper in the book to show you were there and stamp their<br/>
stamper in a book of your own to show what you found.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105489824">You can get a pretty good GPS unit for about 100 dollars.  For me it was my<br/>
Christmas gift from my husband, but the whole family enjoys it.  You also<br/>
need to bring little trinkets to trade if you want to take trinkets from the<br/>
cache.  We haven&#39;t bought any of these.  Doesn&#39;t everyone have tons of<br/>
little things like superballs, happy meal toys, matchbox cars and other<br/>
interesting items lying around?    Also, many times the kids trade something<br/>
they picked up at an earlier cache.  It&#39;s mainly a chance to get out and<br/>
have fun.  I did happen to find a few caches in our town that were easy to<br/>
find without a GPS, before we got it.  You can check your area at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocaching.com/">http://www.geocaching.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
The caches are rated based on difficulty and there are some that you can<br/>
find in a few minutes, others require math or take you to several sites on<br/>
the way to the real cache.  I think using the GPS is really cool though and<br/>
has lead to many wonderful discussions here.<br/>

I do believe there will be both geocaching and letterboxing funshops at <br/>
this year&#39;s Live and Learn Conference. One more wonderful reason to attend!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They are in 3D, but your x,y position has a much better resolution.  (I<br/>
believe on the order of a few meters, while the altitude is 10s or 100s<br/>
of meters.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571620658">That&#39;s great!  Before we got the GPS we were able to find some in our town<br/>
because there is a series of geocaches that are placed at public works of<br/>
art.  By reading the description we could figure out which art it was and go<br/>
looking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197553800">You know what I think would be fun? To get the general area via GPS, then <br/>
follow physical clues to the cache. Some of the cache info on the site has <br/>
physical clues. Some, just the co-ordinates.<br/>
<br/>
Like &quot;Park at N41*476.57&#39; W 111*067.33&#39; then look for the triple trunk.&quot; <br/>
stuff like that. Once you get there, knowing what to look for.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in the middle of a triple cache right now. Could take us a couple of <br/>
days to find, but WHAT FUN!<br/>
