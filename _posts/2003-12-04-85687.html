<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577434540">I don&#39;t post here often--I mostly just lurk & learn.  But I have to <br/>
tell someone about something my 13yo daughter did yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
She takes a Theater class at a local community theater.  The teacher <br/>
is also a school teacher and all the other girls in the class go to <br/>
school.  The teacher gave pairs of girls situations to practice  <br/>
improvisation.  Each girl played a mother or teenager in a situation <br/>
such as the daughter bringing home a bad report card, or coming home <br/>
late.  When the other girls took their turns,the &quot;mother&quot; would come <br/>
in and immediately start yelling at the &quot;daughter&quot;, usually without <br/>
asking any questions, the immediately coming up with all sorts of <br/>
punishments for her.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter&#39;s turn came, she was to be a mother coming home very <br/>
tired from a long day at work to find her daughter watching TV and <br/>
the house a mess.  My daughter came on stage, carefully looked <br/>
around, and asked her &quot;daughter&quot; if the &quot;dog got out again?&quot; and <br/>
proceeded to tell her daughter not to worry about it, that she&#39;d <br/>
clean up. (so she didn&#39;t BLAME the daughter, she asked questions to <br/>
find out what happened, and she offered to clean up) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the teacher thought of that.  I just sat there and <br/>
smiled!  I feel like I must be doing something right.  Too bad there <br/>
weren&#39;t any other parents there.  The others just drop their kids <br/>
off.  I don&#39;t understand that, as I really enjoy watching the class.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is long, but it made my day.<br/>

&lt;&lt; When my daughter&#39;s turn came, she was to be a mother coming home very <br/>
tired from a long day at work to find her daughter watching TV and <br/>
the house a mess.  My daughter came on stage, carefully looked <br/>

<br/>
A couple of years ago Holly was in an improve class once and the teacher <br/>
talked to me and Keith about it afterward.  She was laughing.  The situation was <br/>
about being in trouble about grades or something, and Holly had made some <br/>
punishment about having to eat spinach (just guessing from things she had heard).  <br/>
The teacher had asked her if her parents had ever punished her by making her <br/>
eat spinach, and she said &quot;No, I LIKE spinach.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So the teacher was amused but baffled, and when she told us about it I <br/>
reminded her Holly had never gotten any grade, good or bad, and we didn&#39;t have <br/>
punishments.<br/>
<br/>
It was, of course, like speaking a foreign language.  <br/>
<br/>
I was surprised at how many of their situations for dialogs and situations <br/>
were school-related.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       Yes, that fits our experience, too. Try finding a book of dramatic <br/>
monologues or scenes for children and teens that isn&#39;t full of schooly settings, <br/>
dialogue and thinking! I&#39;ve looked at dozens in the past couple of years (and <br/>
we are in a very artsy college town with more than our fair share of <br/>
bookstores, libraries, and human resources.)<br/>
<br/>
       It&#39;s almost as if we&#39;ve created an artificial reality for kids, <br/>
all-consuming and complete in every detail. <br/>
<br/>
       I guess I should just be grateful that as unschoolers we escape living <br/>
in that reality ourselves, but it still annoys me that &quot;School World&quot; has <br/>
been so successfully promoted as the &quot;real world&quot; that WE as unschoolers <br/>
supposedly shelter our children from!  JJ<br/>
