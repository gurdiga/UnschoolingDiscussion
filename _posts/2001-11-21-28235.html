<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251517271">Anyone else watch Dateline last night?  Well, here&#39;s some new topics to sink<br/>
your teeth in.<br/>
<br/>
1)  If you prostitute your children&#39;s lives, do you have the right to<br/>
complain when you don&#39;t like parts of their lives making headlines?  By<br/>
that, I don&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t have the right to be unhappy about it.  I<br/>
mean you don&#39;t have the right to whine, snivel, complain and shed some tears<br/>
over it on national television.<br/>
<br/>
2)  For those that run daycares or have foster children:  How long would it<br/>
be before CPS/CWS appeared on your doorstep (remember these are mainly 3 and<br/>
4 year old) if someone called in and said or they saw as a sound bite on the<br/>
nightly news that a) you had removed all the handles from the windows of the<br/>
bedrooms of 8 children, all of which are on the second floor and then hidden<br/>
the handles; b) children standing on top of toys that are as tall or taller<br/>
than the railing on a second floor balcony; c) children running around with<br/>
knives (not butter knives, sharp knives); d) children playing Cirque du<br/>
Soleil from the chandelier; e) children running around unsupervised through<br/>
road construction; f) mom taking a switch away from a small child saying,<br/>
&quot;that&#39;s only for mommy and daddy to use.&quot;?  And a dozen other things but I<br/>
blanked half of them out I was so floored by it all.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Since they made a few references to homeschooling these children, how<br/>
soon before we get some backlash from the media over the grinning fool<br/>
talking about &quot;the Bible says &#39;spare the rod, spoil the child&#39;&quot; as an excuse<br/>
for using a switch on toddlers when asked about discipline.<br/>
<br/>
4) And, speaking of controlling parents and potty training, anyone else<br/>
notice mommy dearest thunk the little boy back on the potty chair when he<br/>
got up to leave it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952705895">I don&#39;t have a problem is you choose to do that with your children.  Not<br/>
something I would do &quot;to&quot; my kids.  However, if you make the choice and take<br/>
the money, I do have a problem with whining because your kids end up in<br/>
headlines.  Or maybe it was the whole thing with daddy sitting there with a<br/>
silly grin on his face saying the bible tells him to use a switch on his<br/>
kids and it was down hill from there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456872927">About the parents of the septuplets living off their kids:<br/>
<br/>
Though its true the parents have gotten all sorts of corporate charity,<br/>
according to Dateline the father was a stay-at-home dad (helping to take<br/>
care of the kids and traveling around giving talks) for only a year and a<br/>
half. The income from the talks was erratic, he felt unfulfilled, and his<br/>
wife was tired of having him around the house feeling that way, so after<br/>
that time he got a job in some factory. Just wanted to keep the so-called<br/>
record straight. (I wonder why he feels more fulfilled working in a factory<br/>
than doing half the work of caring for seven four-year-olds and one older<br/>
child, only two of whom are in part-time school, but thats part of the big<br/>
questions about why mens work is valued more than womens work.)<br/>
<br/>
About the four-year-old septuplets climbing up high and so on:<br/>
<br/>
I wasnt especially alarmed about their climbing. My two-year-old climbs<br/>
like that. I couldnt see how sharp the knives were, so dont know whether I<br/>
d let him run around with them. Couldnt really tell whether the kids<br/>
standing on the table were actually trying to swing on the chandelier or<br/>
just swinging it back and forth. I missed the road work scene. I think that<br/>
if you invited camera crew into almost any house with small children in it,<br/>
they could splice together some pretty alarming-looking stunts. If that<br/>
footage wasnt possible to record, Id wonder whether the parents werent<br/>
holding back too much of that youthful daring. Maybe the proof is in the<br/>
pudding  with seven kids having reached the age of four years, theres been<br/>
only been one broken finger and one set of stitches. Not such a bad record,<br/>
compared to what Ive heard around the neighborhood from parents with just<br/>
one kid in their care.<br/>
<br/>
About the mothers whining and sniveling on TV because some in the media<br/>
have questioned whether it is a good idea to bring into the world children<br/>
who may be disabled (two of the septuplets have cerebral palsy):<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be saying that once youve sold your privacy to the media, you<br/>
can no longer react to what they say about you and your family. To me, it<br/>
seems worse to sell your privacy plus your right to express yourself than to<br/>
just sell yur privacy.<br/>
<br/>
About the references to spare the rod, spoil the child:<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you. As someone who struggles not to hit my son, it always<br/>
bothers me to see people who dont struggle with it at all, but instead<br/>
consider it a duty. I feel compassion for any parent living with septuplets,<br/>
and could understand if they struggled not to hit and lost that struggle on<br/>
occasion, but I hate it when they simply feel completely justified in doing<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
About the more general question of whether they were right to take fertility<br/>
drugs, or to carry all seven babies to term:<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, I guess I prefer adoption.<br/>
<br/>
Overall:<br/>
<br/>
I didnt catch the beginning of the segment, so I may have missed key<br/>
points.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798061141">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
For everyone getting worked up about the Dateline show I think it&#39;s <br/>
important to remember that the show specializes in just that. They are <br/>
another form of sensationalism. Of shocking for <br/>
entertainment in the guise of information. <br/>
<br/>
They have their angle on every story and carefully control what they <br/>
show for maximum effect. Not for unbiased reporting or investigative <br/>
journalism. It should come with a disclaimer- &quot;this <br/>
show is for entertainment purposes only&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally find it entertaining. Obviously I&#39;m in the minority <br/>
because it&#39;s still on the air. I don&#39;t have any problem with anybody <br/>
else watching it. I think they realize it&#39;s manufactured <br/>
to a degree.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that the show would want to capture an honest picture <br/>
of how the family is. I am not claiming the family is made of saints <br/>
(or actually to know anything about them at all), only that we cannot <br/>
know their whole situation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just like the doctor with the spot story. It is hearsay used to <br/>
promote the reporter&#39;s story. There may or may not be any actual facts.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of arguing about the family, or doctor&#39;s, facts we could <br/>
remember that we will never know the facts. We will know our own <br/>
experiences with similar situations of course, that&#39;s <br/>
probably what the discussion is really about. It is helpful to share <br/>
them as facts in your personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s knock off the defensiveness, sarcasm, name calling, and all that <br/>
because it gets the list nowhere. <br/>
<br/>
All that lead by example stuff is true, we&#39;re not going to get someone <br/>
to change their mind about corporal punishment by suggesting they&#39;re on <br/>
the wrong list. Give examples of how other <br/>
ideas work for your family, without calling the hitter a boob. People <br/>
are open to change/new ideas when they feel safe to voice their <br/>
concerns and get help. Whacking them with righteous <br/>
indignation will not change anyone&#39;s mind.<br/>
<br/>
Now if everyone who is mad about anything I just posted can reply with <br/>
a thoughtful alternative view if they really disagree with the general <br/>
idea of what I&#39;ve said. No personal accusations, <br/>
name calling, sarcasm, slightly paranoid ego trips (taking this as an <br/>
attack on only yourself), or defending ghosts (those who are offended <br/>
but haven&#39;t spoken for themselves out of fear). <br/>
<br/>
Kathy B.<br/>
having perhaps committed all the sins she now rails against.<br/>
<br/>
ps- any hate stuff (anywhere in life) really is unproductive. It boils <br/>
down to not taking others so personally because their words, and <br/>
actions are all about them, not you. You are free to follow <br/>
your own life. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a mysto book that has some interesting ideas. Take what ideas <br/>
may interest, chuck the rest as hooey if you like. No, I don&#39;t work for <br/>
amazon. It&#39;s just a one link way to describe the <br/>
book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130598120">Well, the context of the switch was what bothered me and it is a button.  I<br/>
freely admit that.<br/>
<br/>
the other thing that bothered me was the father&#39;s generally feeling that<br/>
dangerous acts by small children are funny.  I guess if they were my kids I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have tall toys that I know they will climb on sitting next to the<br/>
railing of a second story balcony.  AND if I did, I certainly wouldn&#39;t stand<br/>
by and watch as the tv crew filmed when they did climb on the toys.  I&#39;d<br/>
distract the child so he would climb down and then move the toy.  The father<br/>
had just finished telling a story about them hanging out the upstairs<br/>
windows when they were two and how far it is to the ground<br/>

Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Topics From Dateline<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; About the parents of the septuplets&#39; &quot;living off their kids&quot;:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Though it&#39;s true the parents have gotten all sorts of corporate charity,<br/>
&gt; according to Dateline the father was a &quot;stay-at-home dad&quot; (helping to take<br/>
&gt; care of the kids and traveling around giving talks) for only a year and a<br/>
&gt; half. The income from the talks was erratic, he felt unfulfilled, and his<br/>
&gt; wife was tired of having him around the house feeling that way, so after<br/>
&gt; that time he got a job in some factory. Just wanted to keep the so-called<br/>
&gt; record straight. (I wonder why he feels more fulfilled working in a<br/>
factory<br/>
&gt; than doing half the work of caring for seven four-year-olds and one older<br/>
&gt; child, only two of whom are in part-time school, but that&#39;s part of the<br/>
big<br/>
&gt; questions about why &quot;men&#39;s work&quot; is valued more than &quot;women&#39;s work&quot;.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the four-year-old septuplets climbing up high and so on:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wasn&#39;t especially alarmed about their climbing. My two-year-old climbs<br/>
&gt; like that. I couldn&#39;t see how sharp the knives were, so don&#39;t know whether<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &#39;d let him &quot;run around&quot; with them. Couldn&#39;t really tell whether the kids<br/>
&gt; standing on the table were actually trying to swing on the chandelier or<br/>
&gt; just swinging it back and forth. I missed the road work scene. I think<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; if you invited camera crew into almost any house with small children in<br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; they could splice together some pretty alarming-looking stunts. If that<br/>
&gt; footage wasn&#39;t possible to record, I&#39;d wonder whether the parents weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; holding back too much of that youthful daring. Maybe the proof is in the<br/>
&gt; pudding - with seven kids having reached the age of four years, there&#39;s<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; only been one broken finger and one set of stitches. Not such a bad<br/>
record,<br/>
&gt; compared to what I&#39;ve heard around the neighborhood from parents with just<br/>
&gt; one kid in their care.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the mother&#39;s &quot;whining and sniveling&quot; on TV because some in the media<br/>
&gt; have questioned whether it is a good idea to bring into the world children<br/>
&gt; who may be disabled (two of the septuplets have cerebral palsy):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You seem to be saying that once you&#39;ve sold your privacy to the media, you<br/>
&gt; can no longer react to what they say about you and your family. To me, it<br/>
&gt; seems worse to sell your privacy plus your right to express yourself than<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; just sell yur privacy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the references to &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot;:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree with you. As someone who struggles not to hit my son, it always<br/>
&gt; bothers me to see people who don&#39;t struggle with it at all, but instead<br/>
&gt; consider it a duty. I feel compassion for any parent living with<br/>
septuplets,<br/>
&gt; and could understand if they struggled not to hit and lost that struggle<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; occasion, but I hate it when they simply feel completely justified in<br/>
doing<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the more general question of whether they were right to take<br/>
fertility<br/>
&gt; drugs, or to carry all seven babies to term:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I dunno, I guess I prefer adoption.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Overall:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t catch the beginning of the segment, so I may have missed key<br/>
&gt; points.<br/>

&gt; &gt; At 09:41 AM 11/21/01 -0800, you wrote:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyone else watch Dateline last night?  Well, here&#39;s some new topics to<br/>
&gt; sink<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;your teeth in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;1)  If you prostitute your children&#39;s lives, do you have the right to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;complain when you don&#39;t like parts of their lives making headlines?  By<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that, I don&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t have the right to be unhappy about<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;mean you don&#39;t have the right to whine, snivel, complain and shed some<br/>
&gt; tears<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;over it on national television.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; More details would help those of us who didn&#39;t watch it.  I have no idea<br/>
&gt; &gt; what the context is here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2)  For those that run daycares or have foster children:  How long<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;be before CPS/CWS appeared on your doorstep (remember these are mainly<br/>
3<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;4 year old) if someone called in and said or they saw as a sound bite<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;nightly news that a) you had removed all the handles from the windows<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bedrooms of 8 children, all of which are on the second floor and then<br/>
&gt; hidden<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the handles; b) children standing on top of toys that are as tall or<br/>
&gt; taller<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;than the railing on a second floor balcony; c) children running around<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;knives (not butter knives, sharp knives); d) children playing Cirque du<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Soleil from the chandelier; e) children running around unsupervised<br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;road construction; f) mom taking a switch away from a small child<br/>
saying,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;that&#39;s only for mommy and daddy to use.&quot;?  And a dozen other things<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;blanked half of them out I was so floored by it all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;3)  Since they made a few references to homeschooling these children,<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;soon before we get some backlash from the media over the grinning fool<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;talking about &quot;the Bible says &#39;spare the rod, spoil the child&#39;&quot; as an<br/>
&gt; excuse<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;for using a switch on toddlers when asked about discipline.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Who *are* these people?  You&#39;ve definitely got me wanting to know more<br/>
&gt; &gt; about all this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839406804">One last thought, on safety and the reactions of social workers:<br/>
<br/>
The reference I heard to a knife (I probably missed something) was when the<br/>
older sister complained to the mother, about one of the septuplets, that he<br/>
got the knife and he was using it to cut the bag open (Im paraphrasing).<br/>
The mothers response was to take the four-year-old by the arm and tell him<br/>
very seriously that he was not allowed to get anything off the counter or<br/>
out of the cabinets. (Wow, Id hate to restrict my sons activities that<br/>
severely when he gets to be four!) It wasnt clear to me whether this was to<br/>
be followed by one of the spankings the father talked about at some other<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
I think social workers, if concerned that a certain activity was dangerous,<br/>
would be likely to excuse the parents as long as they were forbidding it -<br/>
even if the forbidding wasnt working. Something like, I told him not to<br/>
climb up there, he disobeyed me and fell, so his broken arm/leg/back is not<br/>
my fault.<br/>

&gt; &gt;nightly news that a) you had removed all the handles from the windows of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;bedrooms of 8 children, all of which are on the second floor and then<br/>
hidden<br/>
&gt; &gt;the handles; b) children standing on top of toys that are as tall or<br/>
taller<br/>
&gt; &gt;than the railing on a second floor balcony; c) children running around<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt;knives (not butter knives, sharp knives); d) children playing Cirque du<br/>
&gt; &gt;Soleil from the chandelier; e) children running around unsupervised<br/>
through<br/>
&gt; &gt;road construction; f) mom taking a switch away from a small child saying,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;that&#39;s only for mommy and daddy to use.&quot;?  And a dozen other things but<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt;blanked half of them out I was so floored by it all.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3)  Since they made a few references to homeschooling these children, how<br/>
&gt; &gt;soon before we get some backlash from the media over the grinning fool<br/>
&gt; &gt;talking about &quot;the Bible says &#39;spare the rod, spoil the child&#39;&quot; as an<br/>
excuse<br/>
&gt; &gt;for using a switch on toddlers when asked about discipline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who *are* these people?  You&#39;ve definitely got me wanting to know more<br/>
&gt; about all this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486168893">I think it&#39;s wrong to give social workers the power to take children <br/>
that they have now.  Accidents can happen and there are vastly <br/>
different views of what a parents&#39; role is, as we all know very <br/>
well!  Legally, we need to respect parenting styles that are <br/>
different than our own. Whether or not we believe a parent should <br/>
spank a child should be irreleveant legally.  We can debate the issue <br/>
with the parent on a personal level, but not threaten to send a <br/>
social worker to take the child!!!  If we do that, pretty soon <br/>
they&#39;ll be sending social workers to take other children because they <br/>
don&#39;t have a bed time or don&#39;t know how to read when they&#39;re 9.  <br/>
Freedom is a wonderful thing when we actually exercise it. <br/>

<br/>
Although my first response is to say YES, they should be able to &#39;rescue&#39; <br/>
a child... I had to reconsider the options...<br/>
<br/>
Then at what point would any of my choices as mother be at risk. Is my <br/>
son going to be taken away for vaccinations? homeschooling? alternative <br/>
healing methods? family bed?<br/>
<br/>
If I am to be allowed MY freedoms, I need to allow other people theirs.<br/>

Until Corporal Punishment is outlawed altogether, its not my right to <br/>
take someone elses privilege away.<br/>

vaccinations&#39; and of course I&#39;m never lectured about the kids that <br/>
actually DIED from them or damaged, or the who caught Polio from the <br/>
vaccine.<br/>
<br/>
There has been, and always will be the ones that go overboard. At this <br/>
point, we &#39;shouldn&#39;t make the whole class stay after for one person&#39;s <br/>
judgement&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
We can make the punishment EXTREMELY severe for the ones that are caught <br/>
and allow as much support possible for the kids willing to step forward.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The long term effects of spanking isn&#39;t loving at all. I hope you take <br/>
the time to read Murray A. Straus, Ph.D.: Demystifying the Defenses of <br/>
Corporal Punishment before standing firmly with family old-wives tales <br/>
and/or cultural habits.<br/>
<br/>
Changing outlooks midstream does NOT make you a bad parent. Not informing <br/>
yourself of all available facts and a good amount of other people&#39;s <br/>
opinions and experiences CAN thwart the growth of a family and their <br/>
decendents. <br/>

<br/>
Of course, after one is well informed, their choice (within the limits of <br/>
the law) should be respected.<br/>

reports twice now, I think they abuse their power.  BUT . . . the <br/>
flipside . . . the same agency that took seriously a report that my <br/>
son heard voices and was only eating lettuce, had 21 reports of abuse <br/>
on a single father who was subsequently shot in the head by his 13 <br/>
year old son who felt he had no where to turn when the father pulled <br/>
the gun out and said something to the effect that it was one or the <br/>
other then passed out.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is incompetence within the agency coupled witha <br/>
need to &quot;look&quot; productive.<br/>

I personally don&#39;t see how anyone can strike another<br/>
person &#39;out of love&#39;. IMO the two just don&#39;t mix. The<br/>
most extreme example of this (that I&#39;ve seen) was in a<br/>
show I saw a few years ago while visiting my mother.<br/>
The father explained that hands were not for hitting<br/>
so that&#39;s why he used a rod (and he had different<br/>
sizes for different ages!). While he was using the rod<br/>
he would be saying to the child &quot;This hurts me more<br/>
than it hurts you and I&#39;m only doing this because I<br/>
love you&quot;. These were his exact words. Talk about<br/>
sending mixed messages! I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t<br/>
remember the man&#39;s name who said them. I can&#39;t<br/>
remember what the show was or anything else about it,<br/>
but these words will be with me forever, they were<br/>
just so creepy.<br/>
