&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;LOL!&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Not really, but sometimes I think the get more harm than good from playing<br/>
&gt; with some kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please go on, Sandra.<br/>
How DO people cope with this?  Avoiding the neighbors isn&#39;t an option for<br/>
us.  We live in Army housing, 18 apartments to a building, 26 buildings in<br/>
the complex.  There are 23 children in my building, 21 of whom are 6 and<br/>
under.  It&#39;s a zoo.  (BTW, my son is almost 6)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t schedule my son to only play with unschoolers; I haven&#39;t met any in<br/>
Germany yet.  I can&#39;t even just play with homeschoolers; there are only<br/>
about 10-15 families in the 1-hour radius that our homeschool support group<br/>
covers.  I believe all are school-at-home (I keep my mouth shut!).  And, the<br/>
only folks we see most days are military; my German is weak, and<br/>
homeschooling is illegal in Germany, anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
My son only likes to play with a few of the kids in the building, but they<br/>
create real problems sometimes.  I know they&#39;re constantly after my son<br/>
about why he doesn&#39;t go to school, why he reads so much, why he&#39;s so wierd<br/>
(he&#39;s very quiet, and doesn&#39;t often do what &quot;everybody&quot; is doing), etc.  We<br/>
reap problems from this often in the form of nightmares.  I keep him at home<br/>
a fair bit, and schedule activities out when possible (the Army doesn&#39;t<br/>
offer us much, and it&#39;s usually with the same kids.).  But I also worry the<br/>
child has to have friends!<br/>
<br/>
Ideas, anybody?  I have to go home in a month or so, and deal with it again!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Please go on, Sandra.<br/>
How DO people cope with this?  Avoiding the neighbors isn&#39;t an option for<br/>
us. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Fortify the kids with answers.  Do role playing so they know good answers, if <br/>
the kids aren&#39;t coming up with their own.<br/>
<br/>
Invite those other kids over so that you know them.  Less will happen behind <br/>
your back if they&#39;re in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the kids yourself that it&#39;s okay that your son doesn&#39;t go to school.  <br/>
Say it in a merry, happy way and they&#39;ll maybe be a little jealous, but <br/>
they&#39;ll back off him if they know that YOU know that they were getting on him.<br/>
<br/>
If they won&#39;t be nice, don&#39;t let them play.<br/>
<br/>
Those are all bits and pieces I&#39;ve used repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually we&#39;ve come to have other homeschooling families in our lives, and <br/>
some we&#39;ve known since La Leche League days.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday there were several kids here after a play they had all gone to.  <br/>
Including the one who had been in the play...17g, 16b(x2), 15b (x2), 14b, <br/>
13b, 13g, 10g  and they played games, told jokes, ate ice cream, three went <br/>
home and the rest stayed over.  But Kirby asked at one point how long he and <br/>
the 17 yr old girl had known each other.  She was two and he was four months <br/>
when our families became friends.  She&#39;s an unschooler.  Of that batch listed <br/>
above, only one goes to school, and he likes it a bunch (because of band, <br/>
orchestra and Japanese).<br/>

I&#39;m not sure how to instill this in a nother, but my girls are weird <br/>
with a capital WEIRD.  The revel in it.  When someone tells them they <br/>
are strange, they say &quot;Thanks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one thing you can do to help is find him some &#39;heroes&#39; and <br/>
explore how they were thought of in theri day.  Einstein was a geek, <br/>
Bill Gates a nerd, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think finding that sense of self-identity I was speaking of in <br/>
the sexuality thread is what helped my girls the most with this issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846958917">Hey Brenda,<br/>
I am a Navy wife, we live on base here in Camp LeJeune. <br/>
My son is 9. He reads a lot, LOVES to watch Discovery, PBS and the TLC.<br/>
He only likes to play with his friends, &quot;Alex, DJ and Bookie&quot; when HE<br/>
feels like it. He takes social things in &quot;very small doses.&quot;<br/>
In the beginning they didn&#39;t understand this AT ALL. They came to the<br/>
door and asked if he can play and he says &quot;no or yes.&quot;<br/>
They have come to terms with his different attitude and his talks about<br/>
science and the things he enjoys that his friends typically don&#39;t think<br/>
about.<br/>
I have heard them say, &quot;Zechie is smart.&quot; They sort of think of him as a<br/>
novelty!<br/>
My son looks different too. He has very long hair, like an Indian. He<br/>
chooses not to cut it and I&#39;m okay with it as long as it&#39;s neat when we<br/>
go somewhere. <br/>
As for grades; when asked &quot;What grade are you in.&quot; he says, &quot;What<br/>
subject are you referring to?&quot;<br/>
He also says, &quot;I&#39;m homeschooled and I&#39;m 9 years old I&#39;m not  in a<br/>
grade.&quot;<br/>
That ends that. <br/>
My girls deal with quite a bit of social pressure by the pre-teens and<br/>
teens here, especially when it comes to clothing. But they are learning<br/>
to be different and to accept the diversity! If anything, they are<br/>
confident in our lifestyle and see the lack of time that the<br/>
neighborhood children have with their parents or their personal<br/>
interests.<br/>
