<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499602035">Thank you Barb, my biggest thing is that I&#39;m just plain scared to drive with<br/>
4 kids all by myself.  Plus I don&#39;t like to drive and get sleepy headed<br/>
after 3-4 hours.  I get too many what-if&#39;s going on in my head and talk<br/>
myself out of it, but I haven&#39;t wanted to travel to a conference this much<br/>
before either..lol.  So we will see.  Hopefully hubby can come with me and I<br/>
won&#39;t have to worry about driving, but, the more I read here, the more I<br/>
want to go, and I know the kids would love it.  We got a tv last big trip<br/>
(hubby with us) and they watched videos too, they loved it...smoothest trip<br/>
we ever had.  When&#39;s the deadline for the family rate?<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
Tammy,     I&#39;ve done a lot of travel with just me and my boys. Book on tape,<br/>
sing-a-longs, snacks, and a few small new Dollar Store toys can make a trip<br/>
a lot easier on my guys when they were little. We&#39;ve seen and done a lot.<br/>
Need ideas just ask. :-) <br/>
