<br/>
How about a direct request?  As in, &quot;I&#39;m going to clean up the stuff in the<br/>
living room.  Could you please help me do it?&quot;  I usually state that *I&#39;m*<br/>
going to do such and such, and would ds or dh please help.  It&#39;s more fun<br/>
with someone else.  We toss things to each other, whoever&#39;s closer to where<br/>
it goes.  I also dish out liberal doses of, &quot;Wow, the house looks GREAT!<br/>
Thanks for your help.&quot; when we&#39;re done.<br/>
<br/>
If I want the house clean, then I need to go clean it.  That&#39;s not<br/>
martyrdom, but the bottom line.  My dh will clean, but his tolerance for a<br/>
mess is more than mine.  Do I want to wait until it bothers him, or could I<br/>
ask him to help with it now?  My choice.<br/>
<br/>
When all else fails, I pick up the cordless phone and call a friend to chat.<br/>
I tend to pick up clutter while I&#39;m on the phone!  :)<br/>

I also use a cleaning method that involves a lot of throwing, typically<br/>
throwing things halfway across the room into open bins.  Sitting on the<br/>
floor and throwing stuff is a lot easier on the joints than repeatedly<br/>
bending over and straigtening up to straighten up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really what&#39;s important to you and making the time to do what matters. <br/>
I have a 17 year old who pretty much cleans up after herself. I do all <br/>
laundry though and occasionally glasses and plates from her as well. The <br/>
other three are 8, 7 (today) and 2. They DON&#39;T clean up after themselves <br/>
regularly without me asking. Then there&#39;s my husband who is just as bad as <br/>
the 2 year old!!! It&#39;s important to me to have a clean neat house. On any <br/>
given day, you can walk in here and find order. Sometimes toys are on the <br/>
floor but very rarely looking like a tornado. The kids rooms on the other <br/>
hand do look like that. I have a hard time seeing it, but it&#39;s their rooms <br/>
and I bite my tongue a lot. I do need to be able to get into a room in the <br/>
dark at night without killing myself. So I ask for at least a path. We can <br/>
all live with that. I also need to vacuum in there occasionally. More the <br/>
two girls room than my sons. The baby takes food in her room that she shares <br/>
with her sister so crumbs abound. I need to vacuum the rug at least every <br/>
other day. The girls are good and I usually get in there every day. My son <br/>
is a different story. I get in there with the vacuum once a week if I&#39;m <br/>
lucky. His floor is scattered with bits of paper and games he&#39;s making. It <br/>
bothers me but I live with it. He needs to clean tomorrow as we are having a <br/>
house  full and he knows he can&#39;t play with kids in there as there is no <br/>
floor room left. The playroom is mostly mine to clean. Only because it <br/>
bothers me to see it messed. It&#39;s a playroom so the kids don&#39;t need it neat. <br/>
Neither does my husband. I do. Therefore I clean it. Most of the time, kids <br/>
pitch in when they see me cleaning. Sometimes I ask, sometimes not. The <br/>
youngest will say no to helping, the others don&#39;t. I breeze through the <br/>
house often picking up every chance I get. That way it&#39;s not overwhelming. <br/>
My mom can&#39;t stand to talk to me because she can&#39;t keep up with me. I&#39;m <br/>
constantly from one room to another taking care of whatever needs taking <br/>
care of. That&#39;s not just cleaning but dogs, cats and kids as well. It&#39;s what <br/>
I do and what I do well and it&#39;s important to me. Just because someone <br/>
thinks someone else will see there house as messy is no reason to frett over <br/>
what it looks like. If it&#39;s a problem, then just do it. If not, it will get <br/>
done eventually.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Mary, I like what you have to say about &quot;what&#39;s important to you and <br/>
making time to do what matters.&quot; My mom&#39;s not a housekeeper and I <br/>
grew up in sloppy (to say the least) surroundings. It was &quot;an issue&quot; <br/>
in my childhood. Now that I&#39;m taking care of a house of my own, I <br/>
keep it tidier than my mom did. Not because she taught it to me, <br/>
though. The place just gets to a certain point and I go &quot;aaaaagh!&quot; <br/>
and pick up, just to save my sanity. This happens frequently. my <br/>
mom&#39;s place is still very cluttered, but not trashed like it was (no <br/>
kids to help it along!) My mom isn&#39;t as bugged by clutter as I am, <br/>
and so I do more picking up than she does. <br/>
<br/>
This comes back to that modeling thing, too. I can&#39;t imagine my own <br/>
self going ahead and picking up around the place, as a kid, just <br/>
because my mom asked me to. My kids do, though. Why? Because they see <br/>
me doing it. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s it. And me as a kid, NOT picking <br/>
up...well, if I never saw my mom doing that...My daughter has a <br/>
friends whose house is pretty messy, and her mom has a real hard time <br/>
getting her kids to pick up. In homes where things are pristine all <br/>
the time, I bet the kids pick up as they go, not ever letting a mess <br/>
develop...because their moms do it that way, and they&#39;re learning <br/>
from her model.<br/>
<br/>
The difference here, between my mom and Sheila is...that Sheila is <br/>
spending all this time with her kids. I grew up in an atmosphere <br/>
of &quot;benevolent neglect&quot; where my most common after school memory is <br/>
my mom napping on the couch with a book over her face, and us <br/>
watching TV OR... trashing the house! She loved us, and we were fed <br/>
and clothed, but our parents really didn&#39;t do things with us. Took us <br/>
to various lessons and sports events and the like, but play with us? <br/>
Visit? Do a project with us? nah.<br/>
<br/>
Sheila says her kids are creative and energetic, ...I bet anything, <br/>
Sheila is herself creative and energetic, and always into cool things.<br/>
Gee, I&#39;d trade a clean house for an attentive, fun mom any day, if <br/>
that&#39;s the trade-off.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi</div>

Exercises for Mindful Parenting<br/>
<br/>
With these meditative techniques,<br/>
<br/>
raising children can be<br/>
<br/>
a spiritual practice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
by Myla and Jon Kabat-Zinn<br/>
<br/>
1. Try to imagine the world from your child&#39;s point of view, purposefully<br/>
letting go of your own. Do this every day for at least a few moments to<br/>
remind you of who this child is and what he or she faces in the world.<br/>
<br/>
2. Imagine how you appear and sound from your child&#39;s point of view, i.e.,<br/>
having you as a parent today, in this moment. How might this modify how you<br/>
carry yourself in your body and in space, how you speak, and what you say?<br/>
How do you want to relate to your child in this moment?<br/>
<br/>
3. Practice seeing your children as perfect just the way they are. See if<br/>
you can stay mindful of their sovereignty from moment to moment, and work at<br/>
accepting them as they are when it is hardest for you to do so.<br/>
<br/>
4. Be mindful of your expectations of your children and consider whether<br/>
they are truly in your child&#39;s best interest. Also, be aware of how you<br/>
communicate those expectations and how they affect your children.<br/>
<br/>
5. Practice altruism, putting the needs of your children above your own<br/>
whenever possible. Then see if there isn&#39;t some common ground, where your<br/>
true needs can also be met. You may be surprised at how much overlap is<br/>
possible, especially if you are patient and strive for balance.<br/>
<br/>
6. When you feel lost, or at a loss, remember to stand still and meditate on<br/>
the whole by bringing your full attention to the situation, to your child,<br/>
to yourself, to the family. In doing so, you may go beyond thinking, even<br/>
good thinking, and perceive intuitively, with the whole of your being, what<br/>
needs to be done. If that is not clear in any moment, maybe the best thing<br/>
is to not do anything until it becomes clearer. Sometimes it is good to<br/>
remain silent.<br/>
<br/>
7. Try embodying silent presence. This will grow out of both formal and<br/>
informal mindfulness practice over time if you attend to how you carry<br/>
yourself and what you project in body, mind, and speech. Listen carefully.<br/>
<br/>
8. Learn to live with tension without losing your own balance. In Zen and<br/>
the Art of Archery, Herrigel describes how he was taught to stand at the<br/>
point of highest tension effortlessly without shooting the arrow. At the<br/>
right moment, the arrow mysteriously shoots itself. Practice moving into any<br/>
moment, however difficult, without trying to change anything and without<br/>
having to have a particular outcome occur. Simply bring your full awareness<br/>
and presence to this moment. Practice seeing that whatever comes up is<br/>
&quot;workable&quot; if you are willing to trust your intuition. Your child needs you<br/>
to be a center of balance and trustworthiness, a reliable landmark by which<br/>
he or she can take a bearing within his or her own landscape. Arrow and<br/>
target need each other. They will find each other best through wise<br/>
attention and patience.<br/>
<br/>
9. Apologize to your child when you have betrayed a trust in even a little<br/>
way. Apologies are healing. An apology demonstrates that you have thought<br/>
about a situation and have come to see it more clearly, or perhaps more from<br/>
your child&#39;s point of view. But be mindful of being &quot;sorry&quot; too often. It<br/>
loses its meaning if you are always saying it, making regret into a habit.<br/>
Then it can become a way not to take responsibility for your actions.<br/>
Cooking in remorse on occasion is a good meditation. Don&#39;t shut off the<br/>
stove until the meal is ready.<br/>
<br/>
10. Every child is special, and every child has special needs. Each sees in<br/>
an entirely unique way. Hold an image of each child in your heart. Drink in<br/>
their being, wishing them well.<br/>
<br/>
11. There are important times when we need to be clear and strong and<br/>
unequivocal with children. Let this come as much as possible out of<br/>
awareness, generosity, and discernment, rather than out of fear,<br/>
self-righteousness, or the desire to control. Mindful parenting does not<br/>
mean being overindulgent, neglectful, or weak; nor does it mean being rigid,<br/>
domineering, and controlling.<br/>
<br/>
12. The greatest gift you can give your child is your self. This means that<br/>
part of your work as a parent is to keep growing in self-knowledge and<br/>
awareness. This ongoing work can be furthered by making a time for quiet<br/>
contemplation in whatever ways feel comfortable to us. We only have right<br/>
now. Let us use it to its best advantage, for our children&#39;s sake, and for<br/>
our own.<br/>

&gt; Book Description<br/>
&gt; More than five million children are currently taking<br/>
&gt; Ritalin as a result of<br/>
&gt; being diagnosed with attention deficit disorder<br/>
&gt; (ADD). In some school<br/>
&gt; districts, 20 percent of the students are medicated,<br/>
&gt; lining up each day at the<br/>
&gt; nurse&#39;s office to receive their midday dose. With<br/>
&gt; such staggering numbers, one<br/>
&gt; would think there is indisputable evidence that ADD<br/>
&gt; exists and that Ritalin is<br/>
&gt; the ideal way to treat it. But the exact opposite is<br/>
&gt; true. The ADD Hoax is an<br/>
&gt; in-depth look at the crime being committed against<br/>
&gt; our children--children who<br/>
&gt; are &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADD and then exposed to the<br/>
&gt; effects of Ritalin, a drug<br/>
&gt; with massive distribution that is matched in volume<br/>
&gt; only by the number of<br/>
&gt; uncertainties surrounding it. This up-to-date book<br/>
&gt; chronicles the ADD hoax and<br/>
&gt; gives parents and other concerned people the<br/>
&gt; necessary ammunition to fight this<br/>
&gt; epidemic of mistreatment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895772162">Barb, <br/>
I am in the middle of reading a book by Myla and Jon Kabat-Zinn as we speak.<br/>
If fact, I was just thinking I could go and pick it up AND it is the book<br/>
that those quotes came from.  It is good.  It is called &quot;Everyday Blessings,<br/>
The inner work of mindful parenting.&quot;  It is a book that I need to have some<br/>
semblance of quiet to absorb though.  The kids are busy building houses<br/>
underneath the kitchen chairs, taping construction paper to the rungs with<br/>
doors and windows cut in it, so they are fairly quiet.  Might be a good<br/>
time.  I like having a list like that I can print out and tack up somewhere<br/>
to read often.  Thanks Barb!<br/>

about.<br/>
<br/>
When my children were little I cleaned when they were asleep, even if it took <br/>
me until morning to scrub everything, when they woke up it was perfect again. <br/>
 I wanted to not miss a single minute of being with them.  <br/>
<br/>
Even now with them being older, I don&#39;t think they see me really clean, I do <br/>
that when no one is home or everyone is in bed, STILL!<br/>
<br/>
They do see me cook but they don&#39;t offer to take part in that...  maybe <br/>
that&#39;s part of the problem, they think elves do it at night and the elves <br/>
haven&#39;t been visiting THEIR rooms lately!<br/>
<br/>
My youngest has no over taken TWO bedrooms that are both piled high with who <br/>
knows what...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe after all these years of mothering it&#39;s time to change some things!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your post, it was very enlightening.<br/>

that&#39;s the trade-off.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree whole heartedly on that one. You can be anal and so crazy about <br/>
what&#39;s important to you that you do forget about others. When you have <br/>
children, you can&#39;t do that. I try hard to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen. <br/>
Occasionally it does, but I still work on that. Believe it or not, my <br/>
husband and children have helped me to ease up on what I see as a mess and <br/>
what actually is. (can you imagine me worse?!)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I always seem like I&#39;m running around here. Every spare minute <br/>
that the kids are eating or doing creepy crawlers is time for me to run and <br/>
clean or straighten or wash something. It&#39;s what I&#39;ve grown accustom to <br/>
doing. That&#39;s also why my husband calls me during the day to make sure I <br/>
stopped to eat. I don&#39;t have time for it because it&#39;s the kids first and <br/>
then the animals and then the house. I&#39;ll inconvenience myself all day long <br/>
for my kids, they won&#39;t be in this house and little forever. Then I&#39;ll <br/>
probably wish they were around to mess things up so I&#39;ll have something to <br/>
do in my old age without them. Then again, I&#39;ll still have Joe. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

Exercises for Mindful Parenting<br/>
<br/>
With these meditative techniques,<br/>
<br/>
raising children can be<br/>
<br/>
a spiritual practice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
by Myla and Jon Kabat-Zinn<br/>
<br/>
1. Try to imagine the world from your child&#39;s point of view, purposefully<br/>
letting go of your own. Do this every day for at least a few moments to<br/>
remind you of who this child is and what he or she faces in the world.<br/>
<br/>
2. Imagine how you appear and sound from your child&#39;s point of view, i.e.,<br/>
having you as a parent today, in this moment. How might this modify how you<br/>
carry yourself in your body and in space, how you speak, and what you say?<br/>
How do you want to relate to your child in this moment?<br/>
<br/>
3. Practice seeing your children as perfect just the way they are. See if<br/>
you can stay mindful of their sovereignty from moment to moment, and work at<br/>
accepting them as they are when it is hardest for you to do so.<br/>
<br/>
4. Be mindful of your expectations of your children and consider whether<br/>
they are truly in your child&#39;s best interest. Also, be aware of how you<br/>
communicate those expectations and how they affect your children.<br/>
<br/>
5. Practice altruism, putting the needs of your children above your own<br/>
whenever possible. Then see if there isn&#39;t some common ground, where your<br/>
true needs can also be met. You may be surprised at how much overlap is<br/>
possible, especially if you are patient and strive for balance.<br/>
<br/>
6. When you feel lost, or at a loss, remember to stand still and meditate on<br/>
the whole by bringing your full attention to the situation, to your child,<br/>
to yourself, to the family. In doing so, you may go beyond thinking, even<br/>
good thinking, and perceive intuitively, with the whole of your being, what<br/>
needs to be done. If that is not clear in any moment, maybe the best thing<br/>
is to not do anything until it becomes clearer. Sometimes it is good to<br/>
remain silent.<br/>
<br/>
7. Try embodying silent presence. This will grow out of both formal and<br/>
informal mindfulness practice over time if you attend to how you carry<br/>
yourself and what you project in body, mind, and speech. Listen carefully.<br/>
<br/>
8. Learn to live with tension without losing your own balance. In Zen and<br/>
the Art of Archery, Herrigel describes how he was taught to stand at the<br/>
point of highest tension effortlessly without shooting the arrow. At the<br/>
right moment, the arrow mysteriously shoots itself. Practice moving into any<br/>
moment, however difficult, without trying to change anything and without<br/>
having to have a particular outcome occur. Simply bring your full awareness<br/>
and presence to this moment. Practice seeing that whatever comes up is<br/>
&quot;workable&quot; if you are willing to trust your intuition. Your child needs you<br/>
to be a center of balance and trustworthiness, a reliable landmark by which<br/>
he or she can take a bearing within his or her own landscape. Arrow and<br/>
target need each other. They will find each other best through wise<br/>
attention and patience.<br/>
<br/>
9. Apologize to your child when you have betrayed a trust in even a little<br/>
way. Apologies are healing. An apology demonstrates that you have thought<br/>
about a situation and have come to see it more clearly, or perhaps more from<br/>
your child&#39;s point of view. But be mindful of being &quot;sorry&quot; too often. It<br/>
loses its meaning if you are always saying it, making regret into a habit.<br/>
Then it can become a way not to take responsibility for your actions.<br/>
Cooking in remorse on occasion is a good meditation. Don&#39;t shut off the<br/>
stove until the meal is ready.<br/>
<br/>
10. Every child is special, and every child has special needs. Each sees in<br/>
an entirely unique way. Hold an image of each child in your heart. Drink in<br/>
their being, wishing them well.<br/>
<br/>
11. There are important times when we need to be clear and strong and<br/>
unequivocal with children. Let this come as much as possible out of<br/>
awareness, generosity, and discernment, rather than out of fear,<br/>
self-righteousness, or the desire to control. Mindful parenting does not<br/>
mean being overindulgent, neglectful, or weak; nor does it mean being rigid,<br/>
domineering, and controlling.<br/>
<br/>
12. The greatest gift you can give your child is your self. This means that<br/>
part of your work as a parent is to keep growing in self-knowledge and<br/>
awareness. This ongoing work can be furthered by making a time for quiet<br/>
contemplation in whatever ways feel comfortable to us. We only have right<br/>
now. Let us use it to its best advantage, for our children&#39;s sake, and for<br/>
our own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474067723">Since it is sunday and the paper is so big...Have you made rolled up<br/>
tubes and built dome houses (with triangles) and such? It&#39;s a lot of fun.<br/>
Cover it and you could take it outside and cover it with snow to make an<br/>
igloo. Masking tape to hold the tube together. We used duct tape to join<br/>
them together. Now if we&#39;d only get enough snow. I was thinking about<br/>
covering with trash bags and putting snow ( a little) over it all. Oh well<br/>

I can usually find things.  It looks like mounds and piles, but I know <br/>
generally what&#39;s in them.  It&#39;s sad, but I&#39;ve given up thinking I&#39;ll grow out <br/>
of it.  I&#39;ll probably grow out of remembering what&#39;s where, though.  <br/>

I wouldn&#39;t want my children to think back and think I chose housework over them. <br/>
   The dirty dishes will always be there,  the kids,    nope!               Run out of dishes, yes they need to be done;  run out of clothes, yes they to be done.                              <br/>

is a non-putter-away-of-things-when-she&#39;s-finished, just like my mom. <br/>
Even though she&#39;s seen me put things away when finished, and she will <br/>
do so when I ask her...but wouldn&#39;t if she weren&#39;t asked. She just <br/>
