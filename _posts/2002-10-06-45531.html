&lt;&lt; I disagree.  I think children are very powerful.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How? In what way is a child powerful unless the adult in their life confers <br/>
that power to them.<br/>
Legally? Nope. Hardly any protection unless there is obvious abuse or <br/>
neglect. Not what I&#39;d call power.<br/>
Physically? No. They are hugely dependant physically until they get to be <br/>
older children at least.<br/>
Mentally? While incredibly wise and intelligent I wouldn&#39;t say they are <br/>
powerful mentally.  A person can brainwash a tender mind and twist it because <br/>
of that wonderful natural trust a child has. Not powerful. Beautiful, but not <br/>
powerful.<br/>
Unless the adult gives the power....then they do have it.<br/>

&lt;&lt;   My Mother is<br/>
 an expert at frustrating children.  She does it so they don&#39;t even know she<br/>
 is doing it.  She is an excellent teacher.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So let me get this straight. I want to be sure I understand this correctly.<br/>
You think that by your mother PURPOSELY frustrating children, it helps make <br/>
her an excellent teacher????<br/>
Wow. That flies in the face of natural learning. Frustration is going to <br/>
happen in life quite naturally without lame adults trying to add to it.<br/>
I never learned much while frustrated....do much better after I calm down and <br/>
try a new tact.<br/>
So am I understanding your view correctly? Or did I misunderstand completely?<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I do not ever remember feeling<br/>

Of course you did. Your parents gave you that power. Is that why you&#39;re <br/>
having such a hard time understanding that most children do not have that <br/>
same feeling? Because most children are not raised that way.<br/>
We are advocating just that type of parenting. But it baffles me why a person <br/>
would not be able to understand that most children don&#39;t have that kind of <br/>
power given to them by the adults in their lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012550708">Liz, I am having a very hard time understanding.  Now this could just be<br/>
my diminished mental capacity caused by my diet, so I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>

<br/>
*And yet there was a difference-a very vital difference. Elizabeth Murray had <br/>
learned an important lesson-that there was not one law of fairness for childr<br/>
en and another for grown-ups. She continued to be as autocratic as ever-but <br/>
she did not do or say to Emily anything she would not have done or said to <br/>
Laura had the occasion called for it.* <br/>
<br/>
I love that paragraph. Although I wish Aunt Elizabeth had learned the lesson <br/>
a bit further and not have been autocratic anymore, either. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
The kids and Darin and I were watching a movie the other night called *Lloyd* <br/>
(I think) It was all about the preteen set, in school and their relationships <br/>
with peers and other adults. Moly was just shocked at how children are <br/>
treated in school. Of course the movie exaggerated some points, but the <br/>
message was clear. How children learn and are treated in school isn&#39;t fair or <br/>
nice. She kept looking at Darin and me with big eyes. At the time, we were <br/>
laughing and reminiscing about how this or that person reminded us of one <br/>
teacher or another. (the PE teacher was exactly like one of mine in grade <br/>
school) After the movie was over she asked if that was really how things are <br/>
in school. Darin, who had a mostly good school experience said *well <br/>
sometimes but not usually* but I told her that although many things were <br/>
exaggerated to be comical, the idea and message of school was right on.<br/>
