<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974828785">Does anyone have any opinions on Suzuki music lessons.  My 4.5 yod has<br/>
expressed an interest  in learning the violin, so I&#39;m considering Suzuki,<br/>
although the closest school is about a 45 min. drive away and she would<br/>
need to go twice/week.  Any input would be appreciated.<br/>
