&lt;&lt; I thought of this too when I read this paragraph -- but I didn&#39;t know it <br/>
<br/>
had been set to music. It comes from Gibran&#39;s book &quot;The Prophet&quot;. Very <br/>
<br/>
cool. (it&#39;s actually longer than this - does the song have the entire <br/>
<br/>
verse, or is this where it stops?) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t cut and paste from the page without glitching the e-mail, but here&#39;s <br/>
a link to it:<br/>

across the very same in the book I was reading...!!!<br/>
