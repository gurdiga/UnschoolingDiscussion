<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591804960"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve lost some friends over my children&#39;s freedom.  People don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; always want their kids to know how good their lives could possibly<br/>
&gt; be.  It *is* sad.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter&#39;s closest friend has said she&#39;ll stay away if they get cable TV.<br/>
It just amazes me that so many people think they can insulate their kids<br/>
from the popular culture and that it&#39;s a good idea.  And I&#39;ve *been* there.<br/>
(thinking it&#39;s a good idea)<br/>
