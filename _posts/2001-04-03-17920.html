<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234206222">Well, I have been guilty of said comment and have received quite a few of<br/>
them as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think your take on the comment is from a very negative point of view and<br/>
not how most folks mean them.  Not agreeing with folks is not a bad thing<br/>
and most of the comments are, IMHO, simply a statement of surprise that one<br/>
agrees with someone that one normally considers oneself to polls apart from.<br/>
I don&#39;t think the comments are made as a compliment, backhanded or<br/>
otherwise, or as a slam, simply a statement of sometimes cheerful<br/>
wonderment.  Kind of a &quot;wow, son of gun, whaddaya know about that&quot; sort of<br/>
expression.  And in some cases a &quot;wow, that&#39;s koooolll&quot;<br/>

&gt; This is a little rough and subject-changing, so people might want to skip<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s not about vegetarianism, it&#39;s about interpersonals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; someone whose name I hope you&#39;ve already forgotten (because I don&#39;t want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be personal at all, so be polite and don&#39;t look back at prior posts)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; Amazing! I agree with you on something, Sandra.<br/>
&gt; ;-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never understand why people say this to me.  It&#39;s pretty much an insult<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; is offered as a compliment.  It&#39;s an abiding mystery.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not grumpy about it since it happens so very often, but please<br/>
consider<br/>
&gt; in future situations that it&#39;s not really as nice as it would be to say &quot;I<br/>
&gt; agree&quot; without the added &quot;this time you don&#39;t suck.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have people write &quot;I usually don&#39;t agree with you, but...&quot;<br/>
&gt; or &quot;Although I rarely agree with you, this time...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since it might not happen to you guys much either (on either end), it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; probably a rare thing which might not recur for a long time, but please<br/>
&gt; consider it for the future.<br/>
