<div id="ygrps-yiv-931192127">Hi<br/>
<br/>
My name is Cathi and I have a 12ds(13 in August any suggestions on <br/>
Rite of Passage I saw you all talking about) and a 7dd.  We have been <br/>
HSing in MD now for 6 years officially.  We have decided to try more <br/>
unschooling but I&#39;m not 100% sure how this works or if we can do it.  <br/>
My concerns are that I am single, work 3 - 12hr shifs/wk and for the <br/>
last month and a half my children have done nothing and I mean <br/>
nothing even if I lock the T.V. all they do is sleep or fight.  Now <br/>
my dd will draw and she gets P.E. with neighbors kids after school <br/>
hours but my ds is not motivated to do anything he might pu a book <br/>
but doesn&#39;t finish it part of this I know is his depression over his <br/>
father(visits maybe 1/mo). I&#39;m hoping to join this oversight group in <br/>
my area to help prepare my s for high school.<br/>
 <br/>
Are there any good resouces of ideas for these age groups?<br/>
How do I motivate them?<br/>
How do I keep on track of their education?<br/>
How do I get them to finish what they start?<br/>
How do I get them started?<br/>
Any suggestions in discipline?<br/>
<br/>
O.K. That&#39;s all I can think of right now<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Cathi</div>

SOON you need to step away from the school in your head.<br/>

<br/>
Is he going to go to public high school?  The best preparation for that is <br/>
public mid-school or Junior High.   Is that really your goal for your son  To be <br/>
prepared for high school?<br/>

    What I&#39;m saying is that I know some unschoolers, some have been  <br/>
for years some just started but either way these children for the <br/>
most part don&#39;t even touch the TV except if they are watching <br/>
something about what they are learning about.  They have these <br/>
wonderful projects that I hear about, see and/or they present to our <br/>
group.  I have asked the mothers and they say it&#39;s the child, not <br/>
them, asking to learn about whatever.  Reverse Psychology haven&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
      &quot;gets P.E.&quot;? in other words she moves her body, my son on the <br/>
other hand unless ordered will not move from the TV.  When he does <br/>
it&#39;s usually for no more than 1/2 hour and he&#39;s back again &quot;Nobody&#39;s <br/>
home,  They had to leave, Can I/We play PS here/his house, Nobody <br/>
wants to play w/me...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is he going to go to public high school? The best preparation for <br/>
that is public mid-school or Junior High. Is that really your goal <br/>
for your son To be prepared for high school?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
     No public school is not our goal in fact my family has been on <br/>
me the last few months about a diploma, SAT&#39;s, College... I have been <br/>
trying to gather information to satisfy them but they don&#39;t <br/>
understand HSing.  My son was in K and that was enough for him.  2 of <br/>
his HSing friends are going to Middle and HS this fall he&#39;s upset but <br/>
informs me that NO I DON&#39;T WANT TO GO BACK!.(dd wants to)<br/>
The oversight I refer to helps the parents and child to put what has <br/>
been done in a &quot;portfolio&quot; to <br/>
present to a high school if that is what you want or a college.  At <br/>
the end of the year that have a graduation ceremony with diploma...if <br/>
that is what the family wants to do.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Thank-you for the resouces I&#39;m going to get on them right away.<br/>

<br/>
How will they know &quot;what they are learning about&quot; until it presents itself?<br/>
I think you mean they only turned the TV on if a program had been listed that <br/>
was a resource for an academic subject they had on their list to study.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not unschooling at its wild and vibrant best.<br/>
<br/>
Just accidently, Marty came upon a PBS show on Viking ships and how they&#39;re <br/>
dated.  It was wonderful!  Sunday morning when I was the only one here, I had <br/>
something on the DVD player for noise, and I was in the next room.  My show <br/>
ended, the TV kicked in and there was that Viking ship show again, so I got to <br/>
hear the good parts as review.  Marty learned a ton.  I&#39;ve cared about those <br/>
ships for years, and still learned some things I didn&#39;t know at all, because they <br/>
were new things, new archeological finds.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They have these <br/>
<br/>
wonderful projects that I hear about, see and/or they present to our <br/>
<br/>
group.  I have asked the mothers and they say it&#39;s the child, not <br/>
<br/>
them, asking to learn about whatever. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t ask to learn.  They just learn.  They will ask questions when <br/>
they need help, but they come across things and the second they&#39;re discovering <br/>
what it is they have heard, opened, read, seen, they learn about that thing.  <br/>
They either move toward it (stay, explore) or they move away (smaller <br/>
interest, busy), but they know then more than they knew AND they know where to find <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Reverse Psychology haven&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
tried that approach yet maybe it will work, my luck it&#39;ll backfire. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try tricks.  Just make them a rich nest of input and love them and BE <br/>
with them, talk to them, sing with them, make sure they have new things to <br/>
touch/see/hear/taste/smell and they will learn.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
      &quot;gets P.E.&quot;? in other words she moves her body, my son on the <br/>
<br/>
other hand unless ordered will not move from the TV.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You mean she plays?  Runs?  Dances?  Swings?  Slides?  Rides bikes?<br/>
<br/>
Think of those things as what they are.   They have their own real names, <br/>
because they&#39;re real things. They&#39;re not &quot;P.E.&quot;  (For the foreigners on the list, <br/>
that&#39;s the school abbreviation for &quot;physical education.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;my son on the <br/>
<br/>
other hand unless ordered will not move from the TV.  When he does <br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s usually for no more than 1/2 hour and he&#39;s back again &quot;Nobody&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
home,  They had to leave, Can I/We play PS here/his house, Nobody <br/>
<br/>
wants to play w/me...&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could take your son for a long walk, a hike in the hills, a bike <br/>
ride, or get a new dog toy and take your dog to play.  Maybe he&#39;d like to take <br/>
an intro ice skating class to see if he likes that, or tennis.  Why should it <br/>
be HIS job or the neighbor&#39;s job to find something interesting that&#39;s physical? <br/>
 If you&#39;re going to take responsibility for your children&#39;s learning in a way <br/>
that will satisfy compulsory education laws, that is YOUR job.   And if you <br/>
do your job in a way that makes him want to be with you and makes him feel he&#39;s <br/>
having fun, not &quot;doing P.E.&quot; by the clock, things will go better ten ways, <br/>
right then.<br/>

I don&#39;t know whether I listed these before, but maybe for the benefit of <br/>
anyone who joined the list over the weekend, here are some things you might want <br/>

 Unschooling   - Triviality: Textbooks For Unschoolers <br/>
 <br/>
Sandra Dodd  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;So you don&#39;t use books?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 Like fingernails on a chalkboard (something my children might never <br/>
experience) that question breaks into a calm day from time to time. By books many <br/>
people mean school-style text books designed for one subject area, one school <br/>
year, one level. They mean school books. <br/>
<br/>
 Even when I know they mean school books I say, &quot;Yes, we use lots of books.&quot; <br/>
By then, my nervous system has relaxed from the unexpected screech of the <br/>
realization that some people think that unchoolers somehow have houses devoid of <br/>
books. <br/>
<br/>
 School-trained adults (like me) have developed an internal school year, and <br/>
in the fall we might pine for school supplies and new books. I have a <br/>
suggestion for new unschoolers who feel the book-buying imperative coming upon them, <br/>
or for experienced unschoolers who have been given money for &quot;supplies&quot; or <br/>
whose relatives want ideas about what to buy. The good news is there are hundreds <br/>
of these books. The better news is you can find them used almost anywhere. <br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m talking about collections of trivia. These are gold and diamond mines <br/>
for unschooling. I&#39;ll name some books we&#39;ve played with to good advantage, but <br/>
there are many out there at used book stores and garage sales, or on the <br/>
shelves of your friends and relatives, and probably some right under your nose. <br/>
<br/>
 I have a few personal favorites the kids haven&#39;t yet discovered: The Voice <br/>
of the Middle Ages in Letters, Royal Anecdotes and Eyewitness to History. Some <br/>
people might be &quot;tsking&quot; at this moment that those are not trivia books, but <br/>
they are! They are snippets of the best parts of some obscure situations about <br/>
which a whole book or chapter might never be written. They&#39;re books about real <br/>
things and people and places, but they don&#39;t have to be read from beginning <br/>
to end. In fact, there&#39;s no reason to read the whole book. It makes more sense <br/>
to flip through, open randomly, play with the index. Mine are all filled with <br/>
sticky notes, marginal marks, and folded corners. <br/>
<br/>
 Then there are things to read to children at odd moments, when they&#39;re <br/>
eating, when we&#39;re sitting in waiting rooms, driving in the van, or reading someone <br/>
to sleep. How to Do Just About Anything, published by Reader&#39;s Digest, has <br/>
been a guessing game on van trips. I start reading the instructions for making <br/>
or doing, and the kids and my husband shout out guesses, getting progressively <br/>
closer until they know, and I start another one. Sometimes they want me to <br/>
finish what I was reading even though they&#39;ve guessed. Shish kebabs, short <br/>
circuits and shower curtains are all on one page! Now that&#39;s educational. <br/>
<br/>
 Brewer&#39;s Dictionary of Phrase & Fable has snippets from songs, stories, <br/>
riddles, mythology, and literary references which came into public use with a <br/>
vengeance. Their entry for Nine Man&#39;s Morris has the game board illustrated, with <br/>
instructions for play. The &quot;Whitsun Morris Dance&quot; mentioned in Henry V can be <br/>
illuminated for your whole family with this book, as can a few thousand other <br/>
common linguistic details of everyday life. <br/>
<br/>
 So what is trivia, then? For school kids, trivia is (by definition) a waste <br/>
of time. It&#39;s something that will not be on the test. It&#39;s &quot;extra&quot; stuff. For <br/>
unschoolers, though, in the wide new world in which everything counts, there <br/>
can be no trivia in that sense. If news of the existence of sachets ties in <br/>
with what one learned of medieval plagues in Extraordinary Endings of Practically <br/>
Everything and Everybody, there are two pointers which tie microbiology to <br/>
European cities in the Middle Ages, and lead to paradise-guaranteed pilgrimages <br/>
to Rome. Nowadays sanitation and antibiotics keep the plague from &quot;spreading <br/>
like the plague.&quot; [Note: Extraordinary Endings... and Extraordinary <br/>
Beginnings... might not be suitable for young children who read well. Read-aloud can <br/>
avoid some topics that might not be ideal for pre- teens.] <br/>
<br/>
 Looking around my office for another book to name, I see Fowler&#39;s Modern <br/>
English Usage. Trivia!? Well if there isn&#39;t going to be a test, the history of <br/>
the word &quot;paraphernalia&quot; is as interesting as the death of Billy the Kid. There <br/>
are minotaurs and griffins in there , just for flipping through! <br/>
<br/>
 The edition of The New York Public Library Desk Reference we have might be a <br/>
little outdated, but the rules of ice hockey haven&#39;t changed, nor the way in <br/>
which one addresses a letter to the Pope, nor the date of the discovery of <br/>
Krypton. (Some of you thought it was just a Superman thing, didn&#39;t you? <br/>
Nope--1898, the year before aspirin.) <br/>
<br/>
 We have a quiz book on New Mexico. You can find one for your state too. We <br/>
challenge our adults friends in front of the kids and the kids can&#39;t wait to <br/>
know enough to play. I won dessert at a restaurant once knowing how many <br/>
counties there were and the kids were in awe. <br/>
<br/>
 Stephen Biesty&#39;s cross-sections books, David MacCaulay&#39;s The Way Things <br/>
Work, any &quot;What to Do With the Kids...&quot; kinds of books, question/answer books like <br/>
The Star Wars Question and Answer Book about Space, all will fill your kids <br/>
with more questions than they had before they opened the books. This is good. <br/>
This is not school-good, but it&#39;s unschooling-good. Parents don&#39;t have to know <br/>
the answers, they just need to be on the lookout for a source to come along. <br/>
<br/>
 Doing the Days might be a good intro book for those afraid to embark upon <br/>
the sea of trivia. (Look up the history of the word &quot;embark.&quot; Any word history <br/>
book will enthrall your whole family.) It&#39;s a set of activities divided by days <br/>
of the year, designed to encourage thinking and doing in children. I never <br/>
pay attention to the dates, much, just mine it for trivia! <br/>
<br/>
 2201 Fascinating Facts is well worth the dollar I paid for it, and The Book <br/>
of Fascinating Facts by Encyclopaedia Britannica is worth the whole $13 I paid <br/>
for it on sale at Toys &#39;R Us because it has over 350 pages of colored <br/>
pictures. Life-size photo of a human stomach, a 1930&#39;s typewriter with the paper half <br/>
typed and legible in it, and singing cowboys. Every one of those leads us to <br/>
pull out another book, or a record, or to go dig in the garage. <br/>
<br/>
 Visual dictionaries, books of birds, mammals, local flora, the dictionary, <br/>
encyclopedia, atlas, almanac--these books can be used by the hour or by the <br/>
half minute. There is no time wasted when children are thinking, asking <br/>
questions, fitting new information with what they already have, and all the while <br/>
smiling and laughing. Have fun! <br/>

  people might be &quot;tsking&quot; at this moment that those are not trivia books, but <br/>
  they are! They are snippets of the best parts of some obscure situations about <br/>
  which a whole book or chapter might never be written. They&#39;re books about real <br/>
  things and people and places, but they don&#39;t have to be read from beginning <br/>
  to end. In fact, there&#39;s no reason to read the whole book. It makes more sense <br/>
  to flip through, open randomly, play with the index. Mine are all filled with <br/>
  sticky notes, marginal marks, and folded corners. <br/>
<br/>
  Then there are things to read to children at odd moments, when they&#39;re <br/>
  eating, when we&#39;re sitting in waiting rooms, driving in the van, or reading someone <br/>
  to sleep. How to Do Just About Anything, published by Reader&#39;s Digest, has <br/>
  been a guessing game on van trips. I start reading the instructions for making <br/>
  or doing, and the kids and my husband shout out guesses, getting progressively <br/>
  closer until they know, and I start another one. Sometimes they want me to <br/>
  finish what I was reading even though they&#39;ve guessed. Shish kebabs, short <br/>
  circuits and shower curtains are all on one page! Now that&#39;s educational. <br/>
<br/>
  Brewer&#39;s Dictionary of Phrase & Fable has snippets from songs, stories, <br/>
  riddles, mythology, and literary references which came into public use with a <br/>
  vengeance. Their entry for Nine Man&#39;s Morris has the game board illustrated, with <br/>
  instructions for play. The &quot;Whitsun Morris Dance&quot; mentioned in Henry V can be <br/>
  illuminated for your whole family with this book, as can a few thousand other <br/>
  common linguistic details of everyday life. <br/>
<br/>
  So what is trivia, then? For school kids, trivia is (by definition) a waste <br/>
  of time. It&#39;s something that will not be on the test. It&#39;s &quot;extra&quot; stuff. For <br/>
  unschoolers, though, in the wide new world in which everything counts, there <br/>
  can be no trivia in that sense. If news of the existence of sachets ties in <br/>
  with what one learned of medieval plagues in Extraordinary Endings of Practically <br/>
  Everything and Everybody, there are two pointers which tie microbiology to <br/>
  European cities in the Middle Ages, and lead to paradise-guaranteed pilgrimages <br/>
  to Rome. Nowadays sanitation and antibiotics keep the plague from &quot;spreading <br/>
  like the plague.&quot; [Note: Extraordinary Endings... and Extraordinary <br/>
  Beginnings... might not be suitable for young children who read well. Read-aloud can <br/>
  avoid some topics that might not be ideal for pre- teens.] <br/>
<br/>
  Looking around my office for another book to name, I see Fowler&#39;s Modern <br/>
  English Usage. Trivia!? Well if there isn&#39;t going to be a test, the history of <br/>
  the word &quot;paraphernalia&quot; is as interesting as the death of Billy the Kid. There <br/>
  are minotaurs and griffins in there , just for flipping through! <br/>
<br/>
  The edition of The New York Public Library Desk Reference we have might be a <br/>
  little outdated, but the rules of ice hockey haven&#39;t changed, nor the way in <br/>
  which one addresses a letter to the Pope, nor the date of the discovery of <br/>
  Krypton. (Some of you thought it was just a Superman thing, didn&#39;t you? <br/>
  Nope--1898, the year before aspirin.) <br/>
<br/>
  We have a quiz book on New Mexico. You can find one for your state too. We <br/>
  challenge our adults friends in front of the kids and the kids can&#39;t wait to <br/>
  know enough to play. I won dessert at a restaurant once knowing how many <br/>
  counties there were and the kids were in awe. <br/>
<br/>
  Stephen Biesty&#39;s cross-sections books, David MacCaulay&#39;s The Way Things <br/>
  Work, any &quot;What to Do With the Kids...&quot; kinds of books, question/answer books like <br/>
  The Star Wars Question and Answer Book about Space, all will fill your kids <br/>
  with more questions than they had before they opened the books. This is good. <br/>
  This is not school-good, but it&#39;s unschooling-good. Parents don&#39;t have to know <br/>
  the answers, they just need to be on the lookout for a source to come along. <br/>
<br/>
  Doing the Days might be a good intro book for those afraid to embark upon <br/>
  the sea of trivia. (Look up the history of the word &quot;embark.&quot; Any word history <br/>
  book will enthrall your whole family.) It&#39;s a set of activities divided by days <br/>
  of the year, designed to encourage thinking and doing in children. I never <br/>
  pay attention to the dates, much, just mine it for trivia! <br/>
<br/>
  2201 Fascinating Facts is well worth the dollar I paid for it, and The Book <br/>
  of Fascinating Facts by Encyclopaedia Britannica is worth the whole $13 I paid <br/>
  for it on sale at Toys &#39;R Us because it has over 350 pages of colored <br/>
  pictures. Life-size photo of a human stomach, a 1930&#39;s typewriter with the paper half <br/>
  typed and legible in it, and singing cowboys. Every one of those leads us to <br/>
  pull out another book, or a record, or to go dig in the garage. <br/>
<br/>
  Visual dictionaries, books of birds, mammals, local flora, the dictionary, <br/>
  encyclopedia, atlas, almanac--these books can be used by the hour or by the <br/>
  half minute. There is no time wasted when children are thinking, asking <br/>
  questions, fitting new information with what they already have, and all the while <br/>
  smiling and laughing. Have fun! <br/>

Yes!  And if it&#39;s too expensive, you don&#39;t have to send me a copy, though I <br/>
really enjoyed getting the one I DID get, and put it in its little file folder <br/>
lovingly.  So if you CAN send a copy of the newsletter I&#39;d really appreciate <br/>

  It&#39;s a newsletter I produce for my homeschooling community. I&#39;ve been doing it for a few years. The name is gastfreundschaft. German name for an Australian newsletter, a little confusing I know!<br/>
<br/>
   I read a book a while ago by Henri Nouwen, a Dutch priest and part of the book was about hospitality. He wrote about friendship and seeing it as  a safe place we create where people can come and be free to be themselves, to be accepted and ministered to while they have need. A friendship that doesn&#39;t try to possess but will allow them to come and go in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
  Gastfreundschaft is the German word for hospitality and a german friend explained that it is the opening up of your home to someone and treating them not only as an honoured guest but as a part of the family. An all I have is yours kind of attitude.<br/>
<br/>
  So I guess I wanted the newsletter to be that for my homeschooling friends.<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry, rather long winded explanation but it&#39;s a pretty weird name!<br/>
