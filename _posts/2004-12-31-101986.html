<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993148284">Well after reading for a couple of weeks, it does seem that although I had <br/>
been planning to homeschool my 3 1/2 yo son JJ I have actually been <br/>
unschooling him all along. He started showing an interest in reading about 6 <br/>
months ago and although everybody else in our lives has suggested that it is <br/>
entirely too early to begin. WE DID IT. He enjoys recognizing letters and <br/>
learning to write things. It is fun for him to see letters and his name in a <br/>
note from Santa.<br/>
So, here is where the problems comes in.<br/>
1. JJ has been marked as &#39;advanced&#39;; I was lucky to have graduated high <br/>
school.<br/>
2. We do not get the support of our family and friends because they think <br/>
only &quot;those crazy people you here about&quot; home/unschool their children AND go <br/>
to church (shreeekk)<br/>
3. Although I think it is the right thing for my family, I have been known <br/>
to only see things from my prospective and go blind to the rest of the <br/>
world.<br/>
4. Quite frankly: We are poor!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please offer any advise, suggestions anything would be great. It would be <br/>
nice to know somebody heres me and understands what I am struggleing with<br/>
