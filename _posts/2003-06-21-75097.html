 PS  can we start a new topic on laundry weaning and how to promote it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Move to a third floor condo with a basement laundry room?  My son helps me <br/>
bring stuff down when I need to do more than one load at a time.  He watches. <br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s a load of his stuff, he folds and hangs and puts away.  And he <br/>
likes putting the quarters in!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m waiting to see if he&#39;ll find a full basket in his closet, or need <br/>
underwear one day, and decide to go down on his own.  <br/>
