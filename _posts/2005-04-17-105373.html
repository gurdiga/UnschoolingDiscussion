<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452712571">This is so nice.  Thank you for taking the time to write it and for sharing it with us.  I would love to share it with others and am hoping that is OK.  I will share the entire article with Pam&#39;s name attached.  Please let me know if that is not OK.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is natural for people to learn�each in their own way. It is natural <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for children to want to understand the world around them. They also <br/>
want to join the adult world and become competent and capable adults <br/>
themselves. They&#39;ll strive for this in their own natural ways. <br/>
Unschooling parents work on creating a home environment that supports <br/>
their children&#39;s natural desire to learn and grow.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is such a nice summary.  I heard something on the radio the other day about some educator or educational program working to &quot;teach kids how to learn&quot;.  It about gagged me.  We can model ways to gather information, but we do not need to teach kids how to learn.  They are born with that ability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A true unschooling slogan is, &quot;Life is learning, learning is life.&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschoolers simply do not think there are times for learning and times <br/>
for not learning. They don&#39;t divide life into school time or lesson <br/>
time versus play time or recreation time. There is no such thing as <br/>
&quot;extracurricular&quot; to an unschooler�all of life, every minute of every <br/>
day, counts as learning time and there is no separate time set aside <br/>
for education.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I try to explain this sometimes when I&#39;m asked if we homeschool during summer vacation or what kind of schedule we keep for homeschooling.  That paragraph says it well.  I like this especially: Unschoolers simply do not think there are times for learning and times for not learning.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If what we mostly want is for our children to respect us <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and to adopt our beliefs and goals, unschooling may not be for us.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does &quot;respect&quot; really belong with the rest of that sentence?  Although I don&#39;t think of living with my children in terms of &quot;raising them to respect me&quot;, it seems as though a childhood based on being respected would result in an adult child who respected his/her parents, even if the child ends up NOT adopting our beliefs and goals.<br/>
