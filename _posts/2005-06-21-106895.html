<div id="ygrps-yiv-217535434">What I&#39;d like to know is, where were the adults in all of this? every camp <br/>
I&#39;ve ever been at, either as a child or an adult, had counsellors and <br/>
directors. Every tent had a counsellor with it. The description of what <br/>
happened to this boy makes me sad. I&#39;d be completely surprised if he wanted <br/>
to go back, and if he didn&#39;t want to go, I&#39;d NEVER make him, especially <br/>
after learning about this abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, he had a loving, accepting family to come home to and recover? <br/>
That experience has the potential of hurting him deeply and lastingly. Seems <br/>
like it already has, since he never told anyone about it until packing time <br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
Poor kid. Hug him for me, will ya?<br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidiC who had her share of teasing, too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They&#39;re teasing HIM?  Or they tease others and he doesn&#39;t like  it?  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t clear to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Him, and these incidents happened last year at summer camp, he<br/>
&gt;sometimes holds things in and they build-up and come out all at once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  It was when we were packing he confided a few stories to me. Example,<br/>
&gt;Last year while at camp, he had gottten his feet wet and his shoes<br/>
&gt;bled a blueish color onto his socks, he took his wet socks and shoes<br/>
&gt;off to put by the campfire to dry and some other scout threw them in<br/>
&gt;the fire claiming they were a &quot;biohazard&quot;. And then he earned the<br/>
&gt;nickname trenchfoot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At this particular camp the tents are built up on 2 by 4 frames to<br/>
&gt;keep the rain out, when he entered a tent to hang out with some other<br/>
&gt;boys One scout demanded he get out because he was exceeding the weight<br/>
&gt;limit and was sure to bust the floor.(He is about 25 lbs overweight,<br/>
&gt;according to &quot;charts&quot;  he&#39;s healthy and it doesn&#39;t affect his ability<br/>
&gt;to do anything so I feel it is no big deal)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And the one that really got me, one of the scouts took his pikachu<br/>
&gt;pillow, slit it open strung it up to a tree and beat on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And the clincher, He got stuck in a tent alone, (2 cots per tent and<br/>
&gt;an odd number of boys) got frightened in the middle of the night, went<br/>
&gt;into another tent and slept on the floor when he awoke nearly the<br/>
&gt;whole group then called him sissy boy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777160201">At boyscout camp, an adult can only share a tent with their own child.<br/>
He is getting much better about not holding things in, when he tells<br/>
me of these things he&#39;s mainly afraid it will hurt me, Maybe I told<br/>
him one to many times that when he hurts I hurt. When they get sick ,<br/>
or injured I tell them I hurt more when they are sick than when I<br/>
myself were sick, And that I wish I could take their pain for them.<br/>
And the sweet thing is it has rubbed off and they tell me and their<br/>
dad the same thing. I explained to him that I want him to share his<br/>
pain with me , that it is my job to help him through it.<br/>
<br/>
As for my parents , they are the most awesome unschooling grandparents<br/>
I could wish for. They do not expect my boys to talk only when talked<br/>
to and honor elders no matter what  etc, My sons and their Pap are<br/>
more like best friends , he talks to them like equals and treats them<br/>
that way as well. My father-in-law is another story, I am glad he<br/>
lives a few states away and only seems them a few times a year. And my<br/>
mil is no longer involved in our lives (she&#39;s only 5 mins away)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow you can all be releived He has decided to quit !  And i feel<br/>
great about it, was unsure at first, because scouting is supposed to<br/>
build character blah blah blah, then I woke up and realized how<br/>
completely stupid I was  Thanks for letting me know !!!<br/>
<br/>
Bear with me I&#39;m still deschooling <br/>

What a LOT of people, mostly male, seem to mean by &quot;build character&quot; is  <br/>
learn to suck it up.  Learn to find your place in the hierarchy of bullying  <br/>
males.  Will you be a leader?  A bully yourself?  An invisible  person?  A victim?  <br/>
A lackey or gofer?  Find your place and  develop the character to stay there.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m very negative right now about this &quot;Character&quot; business, particularly  as <br/>
regards military bullying and bullies in general who use being in the  <br/>
military as a justification for very bad behavior.  Or maybe they joined  the <br/>
military where Very Bad Behavior can be useful and accepted.<br/>

I don&#39;t think this is limited to males thinking this. It&#39;s rampant <br/>
in society. I&#39;ve seen a lot moms feel this way toward how their <br/>
sons &quot;cope&quot; with these difficult situations. It&#39;s very sad to me.<br/>

up on the concept of &quot;character.&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the military has a corner on the bullying market. Nor <br/>
do I think that &quot;Very Bad Behavior&quot; is useful or accepted there.  I <br/>
don&#39;t consider these fair or accurate statements, Sandra.  No <br/>
biggie, just wanted to point that out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222906941">Gotta comment on this one:  Headline from Stars and Stripes on June 22, 2005<br/>
�Marine blames rape partly on 50-cent beer�private gets 15 years as defense<br/>
cites boredom, base�s cheap brew�  Very Bad Behavior, no real<br/>
justification�only a lame ass attempt at such.  My prolactin-befuddled brain<br/>
is not capable of comprehending the reality of this situation.  A grown man,<br/>
or at least a pretty old boy, who has so little character as to commit rape,<br/>
and then to blame it on cheap beer�disgusting.  I have lots of fuzzy<br/>
thoughts on how this relates to bullying and boy scout camp, but can�t seem<br/>
to get them to gel long enough to get them down in writing�<br/>
<br/>
I mostly just wanted to second Sandra�s negative feeling about bullies and<br/>
character.  I know lots of good men who happen to be Marines, but some of<br/>
the Marines I know or just encounter in passing do behave badly.  I wonder<br/>
if they were bullies, boy scouts, or both.<br/>

They&#39;d be bullies or behave badly whether or not they were Marines, is my  <br/>

I mean, sheesh, if you&#39;re willing to behave badly in an environment as  <br/>
strict and disciplined as the Marine Corps, you&#39;re hopeless anyway.<br/>
