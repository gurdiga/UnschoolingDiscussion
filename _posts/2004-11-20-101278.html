HSLDA will go to court <br/>

my <br/>
children are adopted<br/>
Is there some sort of threat currently with this? I can&#39;t see how this could <br/>
happen once an adoption is finalized. Is this something that HSLDA is saying <br/>
could happen?<br/>

 </span></blockquote> The state of NJ has legislation pending which would make it illegal to <br/>
homeschool adopted children for whom it pays a support subsidy.  This subsidy is <br/>
paid to adoptive parents for special needs children or children adopted as <br/>
sibling groups, or children over 6 when adopted.  This I know from my state <br/>
legislators.   HSLDA has told me they will fight this. <br/>
<br/>
  If you have auto insurance, health insurance etc., why not legal insurance? <br/>
 This is how I look at the HSLDA.  This is the first year that I have joined <br/>
and I feel much better that I did before.  Also, as I understand it, their <br/>
purpose is to keep the states governments from taking our freedoms and really <br/>
with that as its mission they can&#39;t handle divorce cases.  That was disappointing <br/>
to me because when I got divorced my ex made it an issue, but I understand <br/>
the HSLDA&#39;s position.<br/>

to offer their services to the public, not only to their own members. <br/>
Your payment does not buy you legal insurance. If it did, you&#39;d have an <br/>
insurance policy. You don&#39;t, because it is not legal insurance. You&#39;ve <br/>
simply contributed to the organization and you get NO voice in how your <br/>
money is spent, either.<br/>

doesn&#39;t stop you from getting sick, and HSLDA doesn&#39;t guarantee that <br/>
if you aren&#39;t following your state laws they will represent you.  <br/>
<br/>
Even though you joined, it doesn&#39;t mean they have to represent you <br/>
if CPS comes knocking, or the Board of Education.  It isn&#39;t a <br/>
binding contract.<br/>

If you refuse to read *all* the information available, then you <br/>
aren&#39;t getting a balanced picture, and there&#39;s really no point to <br/>
this thread.  Unless you are open to hearing what people have to <br/>
say, and searching for yourself to see if they are right, you are <br/>
only getting one side of the story.<br/>
<br/>
I used to belong to HSLDA, but learned what they were about and <br/>
decided I didn&#39;t like their scare tactics and the fact that <br/>
membership dues were used to further partisan non-homeschooling <br/>
political agendas.  I homeschool legally in my state, and have no <br/>
fear of legal action.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are familiar with your state laws, are participating with and <br/>
communicating with other homeschoolers, most situations can be <br/>
handled without any legal intervention.  And if you do need a <br/>
lawyer, there are lawyers who are familiar with homeschool laws that <br/>
don&#39;t work for HSDLA.  The Rutherford Institute, for example, or <br/>
those listed at A to Z&#39;s Home&#39;s Cool site.<br/>
