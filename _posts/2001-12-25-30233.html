you would opt not to choose any?<br/>
<br/>
Have you read any of Neil Zimmer&#39;s books on the history of vaccinations?<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK, tetanus, from specific companys are the only one worth getting.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your choices,<br/>

  I think you showed amazing restraint in your conversation. Personally I <br/>
  like to point out all the people that die from the vaccines. I also point <br/>
  out that each cost of a vaccine has a percentage that goes into a fund <br/>
  for restitution to the parents of the children that die from it (although <br/>
  many parents can&#39;t claim it since its very hard for them to prove it was <br/>
  vaccine related death.)<br/>
<br/>
  I also point out that all the cases of disease that are caused by <br/>
  vaccines (the only Polio cases that exists in the world today are from <br/>
  vaccinations) and back when I had money *laugh* I used to send them one <br/>
  of Neil Zimmer&#39;s books on vaccinations.<br/>
<br/>
  When pushed in conversation, I also point out how vaccines don&#39;t keep <br/>
  kids safe, they just keep the symptoms from showing. Their poor little <br/>
  bodies stop fighting and it turns into something a lot nastier sooner or <br/>
  later in life. I&#39;m sure a lot of ADD is from vaccination poisoning.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for helping to support a movement to keep our children safe.<br/>
<br/>
  regards,<br/>
  kolleen<br/>
<br/>
  btw: this is a tough issue because there are one or two vaccines that are <br/>
  safe. For example there is a company that makes a great tetanus vaccine <br/>
  (I can get the name if anyone is interested). YET some states require <br/>
  either a)religious b) medical. Very few states also allow c) conscious <br/>
  choice.<br/>
<br/>
  This puts parents at a disadvantage that want to vaccinate for one (lets <br/>
  say at the age of 5 for tetanus only) and not for any others. Which means <br/>
  parents then have to go &#39;underground&#39; to make their choices.<br/>
<br/>
  Tis a sad thing in my heart that our children are not our children when <br/>
  it comes to things like this, yet something like spanking is legal. Oh, <br/>
  I&#39;ll never understand it all.<br/>
