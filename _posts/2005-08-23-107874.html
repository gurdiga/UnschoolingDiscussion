<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868647306">Oh, and also this, because it&#39;s where I try to distinguish between <br/>
productive uses of parental judgment and non-productive, fwiw.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I understand the argument about not blaming but I don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s <br/>
beneficial to not judge a hurtful action as hurtful. I don&#39;t believe it <br/>
is beneficial to pretend that a hurtful action is playful. I&#39;ve posted a <br/>
couple of times about how important I think it is to not only to help <br/>
someone meet a need but to help them find productive ways to express <br/>
those needs. Part of helping them do that requires an ability to <br/>
distinguish between desirable and undesirable, acceptable and <br/>
unacceptable alternatives, which cannot be done without judgment.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that judgment itself can be used either positively or <br/>
negatively, productively or unproductively. To help a child sort through <br/>
different choices and their effects on others by using our judgment to <br/>
discern better and worse choices, that&#39;s a productive use of our <br/>
judgment. To label a child cruel, lazy or stupid based upon a choice is <br/>
a very unproductive use of our judgment.&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it can be done fairly and thoughtfully, or it can be kneejerk and <br/>
nonsensical.   <br/>
Maybe that&#39;s what you mean by &quot;productively or unproductively.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people have good judgment and some don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Not-good-judgment is probably not &quot;unproductive,&quot; it just doesn&#39;t produce <br/>
positive results.<br/>
And probably you&#39;re talking about positive results with helping kids learn <br/>
how to figure out on their own how to make better decisions in the future.<br/>
<br/>
One way to look at the role of someone (anyone--friend, teacher, parent) who <br/>
is helping another person improve behavior is to see them in the role of <br/>
coach.   Coaches need to see how a person does, advise for the next time, and watch <br/>
them again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve coached adults because of having apprentices and students within that <br/>
context.   <br/>
One of the meanest things I could have done would have been to be <br/>
&quot;non-judgmental&quot; when they were depending on me to advise them on doing better.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a phrase I don&#39;t like used in fundamentalist Christian circles:   <br/>
&quot;Hate the sin; love the sinner.&quot;   They mean to suggest that it&#39;s good to accept <br/>
the human being (and his money, and his potential to be saved) while condeming <br/>
the sin.    Problem is, there IS no sin without the sinner.    There is no <br/>
crime without a criminal.    People talk about unconditional love, and I know <br/>
that on the extreme end love can have TOO many restrictions and conditions, but <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean that someone should love someone (even her own child or her <br/>
husband) just as much no matter what he does.   <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a related question.   Do actions reflect on the person who <br/>
acts?    Yes.   They reflect on his morals, his abilities, his sensitivity, his <br/>
awareness, his courtesy, knowledge, and all kinds of things.   Some people <br/>
don&#39;t care about all those aspects of the person.   Some care about none <br/>
whatsoever.   Some care about all of them together.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom doesn&#39;t know or care that her chld&#39;s actions are socially <br/>
unacceptable, that makes her socially unacceptable too, and the two of them socially <br/>
unacceptable to that group or individual making the judgment.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty complicated. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
This sparked rules vs. principles in my mind.  How can  you live a principle <br/>
based life without using judgments?  Aren&#39;t the  principles based on common <br/>
judgments?  What are they called in sociology  circles....mores?<br/>
 <br/>
When helping a child to see what better choices they could or  could have <br/>
made, the conversation should usually come back to the  principles.  We don&#39;t <br/>
have to place a judgment on the actions as &quot;good&quot; or  &quot;bad&quot;.  They&#39;re smart <br/>
enough to figure out that depending on circumstances  the same action could reverse <br/>
their judgment of a particular  behavior.   The point is application of the  <br/>
principles.<br/>
 <br/>
These thoughts aren&#39;t fully formed, but I&#39;ll think about it  some more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right.<br/>
<br/>
Last week Marty was feeling kind of sick, like mild cold or flu.   He missed <br/>
three days of work.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a long story but the first day he didn&#39;t quite get the message to his <br/>
boss that he wasn&#39;t coming, and when he/boss called to see what happened to <br/>
Marty, I had to say he was gone with a friend.    It&#39;s one of my personal <br/>
wounds/guilts that if you&#39;re too sick to go to work you shouldn&#39;t &quot;earn the privilege&quot; <br/>
(leftovers from early childhood) of doing anything fun that day.   So I was <br/>
embarrassed and grumpy with Marty.<br/>
<br/>
The second day he was still only kind of sick, called in, and perked up <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
The third day he was unquestionably sick, called in, and his boss was sick <br/>
too (but at least couldn&#39;t blame Marty for contagion).<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, it&#39;s a flexible-hours job.   Marty could go in anytime and stay as <br/>
long as he wanted to, but he&#39;s a schedule-loving kind of guy so goes noon to <br/>
five four days a week.<br/>
<br/>
But the point of the story is that on the second day Marty, knowing I had <br/>
been so unhappy with him the day before, came and asked me if I thought he should <br/>
go.    Instead of giving im a yes or no answer, I went through all the <br/>
concerns I could think of that Marty should consider.     <br/>
He works alone lately, so coughing wasn&#39;t going to be a problem.   <br/>
He&#39;s a really fast worker usually, so one slow day wasn&#39;t going to hurt much.<br/>
Did Mike have deadlines or was it a routine week?<br/>
Was Marty in danger of hurting himself or making mistakes from being sick?<br/>
Was Marty disliking the job and so feeling sick out of avoidance?   (No, he <br/>
said he liked it, but the reason I brought it up is that not having years of <br/>
school experience, Marty might not have known, I figured, that some kids dislike <br/>
school to the point that it does make them physically ill when they wake up <br/>
and realize it&#39;s time to go there.)<br/>
I mentioned lightly (reminders) reliability and integrity, and being honest <br/>
with himself. <br/>
<br/>
He called his boss and asked him about deadlines and pressing need, and there <br/>
weren &#39;t any.   So based on that, Marty decided to stay home.   And I didn&#39;t <br/>
mind, because he had given his boss a chance to persuade him to come, or to <br/>
say &quot;no problem.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
I was judgmental partly because of memories of being prevented from going to <br/>
a girl scout or 4-H meeting the evening of a day I had missed school.   Those <br/>
memories are not as well dissected and cataloged as the school memories <br/>
themselves, and so I found a pocket of unresolved childhood   resentment and <br/>
very-minor trauma, and I knew it was personal and I told Marty it was.   <br/>
<br/>
Keith had advised me from work not to try to make him go or shame him, but to <br/>
remind him he had a commitment and shouldn&#39;t make his decision too lightly.<br/>
<br/>
That complex situation, and the fact that Marty came and asked me to help him <br/>
decide whether to go, was the result of years of me helping him decide rather <br/>
than dictating what he must and couldn&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
If I could somehow have said or felt that it made no difference one way or <br/>
the other whether Marty went to work, or that it made no difference how sick he <br/>
was or whether he had succeeded in getting the message to his boss, then my <br/>
advice wouldn&#39;t be worth a damn.   On what basis could I advise if I had removed <br/>
all basis of comparative thought?<br/>

&quot;Socially acceptable&quot; reminds me of math curriculam. Each user sees <br/>
their formula as the right one.. <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking how lots of people deal with situations in different <br/>
ways. Children are different. What works for one family may not be so <br/>
simple a solution or right for that matter. What one family see&#39;s as <br/>
a principal another may not. <br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers we are respecting our children&#39;s freedom to be who <br/>
they are(without harming another). This reminds me of the post last <br/>
year when a mom had said <br/>
how some children at the playground were forbidden from walking on <br/>
the rock wall. In that situation no harm was taking place. In this <br/>
conversation to fit in or not burn a bridge does the unschool parent <br/>
forbid the wall climbing to fit in?...... In the older children <br/>
thought i was thinking how older children expand play and creativity <br/>
past the toddler stage. When mixed with differing ages it can be a <br/>
challenge to accommodate everyone. Who needs to tweak/conform?<br/>

Some of the talking I&#39;ve done has been to point out when others are <br/>

happened.    (Less and less as the years go on, whether more practice on my kids&#39; <br/>

(water, sunscreen, a question about when we need to go, asking him to get <br/>
something from the car or help me pack up) and casually mention it seemed like the <br/>
other kid wasn&#39;t having very much fun, and was everything okay, and see if <br/>

Sandra&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I was reading this topic in the same thought.. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
When I wrote older ages I was thinking about the mix in ages in my own  home. <br/>
Beyond that the mix of my 4 and going places that doesn&#39;t always fit all  <br/>
ages. I try to meet or go places where each of my children will have a friend or  <br/>
a item they like to play with. That&#39;s a challenge...<br/>
I was thinking for instance (as i try to respond to this) my 16 mo is  trying <br/>
to shut the tv off while my 3 yr old is putting his hand over the button  to <br/>
stop the 16mo from turning the tv off. How I *tried to explain to the 3 yr  <br/>
old (a very sensitive lil guy) that if he didn&#39;t panic (something we are working <br/>
 on bc he has a speech delay) about the tv being shut off that the 16mo would <br/>
 move on. In this case knowing both children I did not feel that drawing  <br/>
attention to the 16mo and letting him know that it&#39;s a big deal to us bc he  will <br/>
pick up on that. He did move on and will soon loose interest in  the tv going <br/>
on and off as the other kids did..  The tv was just moved to a  lower <br/>
location for safety reasons so it&#39;s location and situation are better than  Cameron <br/>
climbing the coffee table to get to it.<br/>
 <br/>
 If I understand correctly it would be socially unacceptable for this  to <br/>
take place in someone else&#39;s home. I agree. That said my kids know that  someone <br/>
else home isn&#39;t theirs and it&#39;s just not an issue. They are more  interested <br/>
in friends and new surroundings UNLESS it&#39;s my MIL&#39;s because it&#39;s all  <br/>
breakable and she freaks out so we just don&#39;t go as often while they are  lil. <br/>
 <br/>
I think the topic has come up in the past about bigger families. The  <br/>
challenge with having several children is that the solutions are not always the  same <br/>
or as easily solved. Our children all play together so sometimes it can be  a <br/>
challenge to keep the play fun for all.  <br/>
The 13 yr old goes faster on the bikes so the middle two sometimes get  <br/>
frustrated. They enjoy playing together and it&#39;s not always pretty but they  are <br/>
learning as they go. <br/>
 <br/>
The train table is in the tv room now and that has had it&#39;s challenges  with <br/>
the 16mo,3 and 5 yr old playing at the same time not to mention that the  dog <br/>
also wants a train...<br/>
I have learned as each child came that what was natural in my  parenting <br/>
required much more creativity everyday.<br/>
 <br/>
For the oldest he is generally gone playing with his friends during the  <br/>
day,playing runescape, im&#39;ing,on the phone etc... We are both night owls so I  <br/>
nurse Cameron to sleep in my bed(only way he will sleep) and when daddy comes  <br/>
down with Nicholas I go up stairs with the 13 yr old and play cards or just  <br/>
talk. Sometimes the 5 yr old plays also but mostly she likes her late night  <br/>
movies. Then back down and hopefully hubby is still awake for some adult  <br/>
conversation that wasn&#39;t finished after dinner.<br/>
 <br/>
Socially acceptable in a larger family with age gaps was my thinking.  Away <br/>
from home just isn&#39;t a concern bc my kids enjoy other kids also. Other  <br/>
children with many rules and no freedom, limits friendships but those are not  the <br/>
friends my children seek out.<br/>

&gt; Socially acceptable in a larger family with age gaps was my thinking. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah.   Sorry, I guessed a wrong direction.<br/>
<br/>
I finally have kids old enough to get away from one another on their own and <br/>
also old enough to want to hang around together on their own.   It&#39;s <br/>
WONDERFUL.   I think if they&#39;d been schoolkids, a 19 year old wouldn&#39;t hang out with a <br/>
13 year old, and maybe neither would hang out with the 16 year old, but in <br/>
various combinations they do, and happily.   Or they don&#39;t, and contentedly.<br/>
<br/>
The principle we have here which came up again last week when Kirby did <br/>
something to be funny and it made Holly scream her painful (to us) scream is &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
only playing if everyone&#39;s playing.&quot;     Kirby had taken a bite out of her <br/>
food after she said &quot;don&#39;t get my food.&quot;   He did it knowing he had a new one to <br/>
replace it with, and he did it to get a laugh out of visiting kids.   But <br/>
Holly SCREAMED and was too upset to eat, and Kirby thought that was a stupid <br/>
response, and I talked to both of them separately and neither could be immediately <br/>
soothed.   <br/>
<br/>
But from a bigger perspective, within an hour or less Kirby had apologized, <br/>
and what we discussed will probably help them both do better in future <br/>
situations with each other or anyone else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My version of this recently has been the general evaluative advice &quot;If <br/>
you&#39;re having fun but someone else is upset it&#39;s gone from playing to <br/>
taunting.&quot; We&#39;ve had lots of conversations recently about &quot;taunting&quot; <br/>
both because of shows and books and real life. It seems one of those <br/>
recurring words recently--it happens lots in school settings of shows <br/>
and books.<br/>

I was  thinking for instance (as i try to respond to this) my 16 mo is  <br/>
trying  <br/>
to shut the tv off while my 3 yr old is putting his hand over the  button  to <br/>
stop the 16mo from turning the tv off. How I *tried to  explain to the 3 yr  <br/>
old (a very sensitive lil guy) that if he didn&#39;t  panic (something we are <br/>
working <br/>
on bc he has a speech delay) about the tv  being shut off that the 16mo would <br/>
move on. In this case knowing both  children I did not feel that drawing  <br/>
attention to the 16mo and  letting him know that it&#39;s a big deal to us bc he  <br/>
will <br/>
pick up on  that. He did move on and will soon loose interest in  the tv <br/>
going <br/>
on  and off as the other kids did..  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t expect a 3 yo to understand that at all.  I&#39;d scoop up the  baby <br/>
and distract him for a little while, then, when no one was using the TV,  I&#39;d <br/>
take him in there and let him press the button as many times as he  wished.  I <br/>
might ask my 3 yo to ask me to come get the baby instead of  holding his hand <br/>
over the button, though.<br/>
 <br/>
If the baby was so intent on pressing that button that he screamed and  cried <br/>
when I scooped him up, I&#39;d find him another TV or other button to push  that <br/>
had similar excitement.<br/>
