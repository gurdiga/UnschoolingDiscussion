     Totally agree with this!  I find that SO much sexism still exists today <br/>
with regard to housework.  No matter who we get together with, it seems like <br/>
the women are in the kitchen doing the food preparation and the men are <br/>
sitting around talking or watching TV.  If it&#39;s a barbecue, then for some <br/>
reason, the men can stand around it and flip stuff over but the women still <br/>
have to bring together the meal as a whole.<br/>
     My husband is almost always in the kitchen with me helping and my sons <br/>
are often in there, also.  Many people we know actually feel sort of sorry <br/>
for him because he does things like cook or wash dishes (as evidenced by <br/>
comments like, poor Matt...).  Or they act like it&#39;s extraordinarily generous <br/>
of him to help with these things by saying things like, WOW, that&#39;s so great <br/>
that he COOKS.  I know it&#39;s supposed to be a compliment to him but sometimes <br/>
I think, why aren&#39;t they saying to him, WOW, that&#39;s so great that Lucy <br/>
COOKS...And women do it as much or more than the men do.  <br/>
     My kids help with every single aspect of keeping things going in this <br/>
house and the three oldest have all changed diapers quite a lot, too, when <br/>
the situation called for it.  I figure maybe their marriages and families <br/>
will be a lot healthier because of this.  At least we&#39;re sending out five men <br/>
into society who don&#39;t have that form of sexism.<br/>

<br/>
     It is great in a sense but isn&#39;t it just as great that a mom homeschools <br/>
or cooks or organizes something in the house, etc.?  I remember one time when <br/>
my sister was working full time and came home really sick from work; her <br/>
husband cooked that night, something he rarely did, and his mom happened to <br/>
call (a really nice person, not any weird mother-in-law situation going on) <br/>
and she kept saying, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s so NICE that he made dinner for you.&quot;  <br/>
     I do believe that it can be a form of sexism to act like it is <br/>
extraordinary for a husband to do something and ordinary for a wife to do it.<br/>
