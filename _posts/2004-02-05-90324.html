<div id="ygrps-yiv-606870157"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;highschool (aprox. 100 high school students). He has now decided that<br/>
&gt;he wants to just &quot;finish&quot; school at home and get on with &quot;real<br/>
&gt;life&quot;.<br/>
&gt;   He tests at 11 grade level. He just turned 16, but is quite mature<br/>
&gt;for his age. He wants to learn Blacksmithing and welding as<br/>
&gt;his &quot;career&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve been school-at-homing him?<br/>
So graduate him already...or have him unschool blacksmithing.<br/>
Voila.  Problem solved.<br/>
<br/>
Yours isn&#39;t the only unschooling teen who&#39;s into hot metal and fire.  I&#39;ve <br/>
a 14 year old son and we&#39;re building a forge out of an old semi-truck brake <br/>
drum (or whatever it&#39;s called.)  Anyone have a squirrel-cage blower they <br/>
don&#39;t need anymore? (grin)  And, we just got our first Mig welder <br/>
(harborfreight.com, about $200.)  We&#39;re going to need it to weld the legs <br/>
onto the forge body... and weld the blower onto the bottom of the <br/>
drum.  Next on the wish list is an oxy/acet set with a cutting tip or two <br/>
(plasma cutters are too expensive.)  (sigh/grin)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been making chainmail on his own and next year will teach &#39;chainmail&#39; <br/>
to some interested 5th graders.<br/>
<br/>
After the forge is up and functional, he wants to start knifemaking, mostly <br/>
swords.  Folded metal and such.  I have the feeling it&#39;s going to require a <br/>
much larger forge, but at least we&#39;ve helped him get started.<br/>
<br/>
Look, you&#39;re not alone.  Just do it and don&#39;t worry about it so <br/>
much.  Support him.  Encourage him.  There&#39;s a farrier (horseshoes) around <br/>
here who makes more than $200 each time he shoes a horse.  I&#39;m sure he <br/>
pulls in six figures easy and everyone says he loves his work and does a <br/>
great job.  Believe that your kid won&#39;t starve and he might just love what <br/>
he ends up doing.  What a life!<br/>
