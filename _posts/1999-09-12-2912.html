<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481045373">Ok I have a major question for all of you that know the laws  just a<br/>
thought,  how in this country are millions of kids dropping out of school?<br/>
are their parents taken to court?<br/>
what about all of the pregnant girls that choose to drop out and care for<br/>
their children?<br/>
what do they go thru in order to drop out?  do their parents have to send in<br/>
papers saying they are been homeschooled? do they have to be tested each<br/>
year and report to the state until they are 18?<br/>
now consider this, if the answer is no they do not, they just drop out no<br/>
questions asked (they are just a bad seed )  couldn&#39;t we then send our high<br/>
schoolers to school for a month or so and have them drop out and be free<br/>
from the entire system? and have them still homeschool and continue on the<br/>
way we homeschool without the hassle of sending in papers?  now I know you<br/>
couldn&#39;t have them drop out of homeschool, that would be to obvious, but<br/>
what about dropping out of public school?<br/>
does anyone know the answers to these questions?<br/>
does anyone know the how old you have to be to get your ged?<br/>
does anyone know how these kids just drop out?<br/>
how does one graduate early from homeschool?<br/>
why are homeschoolers required to report to the state  until the child is 18<br/>
and ps kids can graduate when they are 17? what about my child who started k<br/>
when she just turned 5 the day school started and will be  17 when her class<br/>
graduates from highschool?  what if my child was held back in ps  for a<br/>
year, do I consider her in that lower grade  or the grade of the children of<br/>
her own age?  and how does that work out?<br/>
just some thoughts to ponder for the day!!<br/>
from Tanya and Mary Ellen who think that if the state is willing to just let<br/>
kids drop out and claim they are just bad then why would they care that they<br/>
are at home learning????<br/>

<br/>
The following is Washington State Law:<br/>
<br/>
All schools are REQUIRED to:<br/>
   Notify parents after their student&#39;s first unexcused absence.<br/>
   Schedule a conference with parents after any second unexcused absence in a <br/>
month <br/>
    File a petition in juvenile court after five unexcused absences in a <br/>
month or 10 in one school year.<br/>
<br/>
If found in violation of the school attendance laws, parents, guardians <br/>
and/or students may be required to&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Pay $25 in fines for each day of unexcused absence from school<br/>
  provide community service at the child&#39;s school<br/>
  participate with the school and the child in a supervised plan for the <br/>
child&#39;s attendance at school<br/>
  attend a conference or conferences scheduled to analyze the cause of the <br/>
child&#39;s absences.<br/>
<br/>
The following are valid excuses for absences and tardiness, and will be <br/>
recorded as &quot;excused absences&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Absences due to illness, health conditions, family emergency, religious <br/>
purposes or weather conditions that result in transportation services being <br/>
cancelled in a student&#39;s service area.  <br/>
<br/>
2. Participation in school-approved activities with the authorization of a <br/>
staff member.<br/>
<br/>
3. Absences for parental approved activities with the authorization of the <br/>
school principal<br/>
<br/>
4.  Absences resulting from disciplinary actions or short term suspensions.<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s what I find ridiculous....<br/>
<br/>
The bit about transportation being canceled.  Here it&#39;s so wet that when we <br/>
have a winter freeze and it thaws, the put all these weight restrictions on <br/>
the roads.  Which effectively shuts done the school buses running on the <br/>
smaller back roads.  Because it&#39;s so wet, the roads will literally collapse <br/>
with the thaw and under the roads turns to mush.   They can run on the main <br/>
roads...  But, if you&#39;re in the boonies, you&#39;re screwed because <br/>
transportation wasn&#39;t cancelled, you just don&#39;t get the bus.... It&#39;s a huge <br/>
deal here when it happens because 90% of the parents have to take their <br/>
children to school and the line pulling up to any school is like a 30 minutes <br/>
to the front door.  Everyone is an hour late for work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they are dead serious about this attendance policy here.  I have <br/>
friends that pulled their kids out because of it.  In one instance they <br/>
nailed one friend on the $25 a day fine thing for 7 days (she made less than <br/>
$600 a month) and she couldn&#39;t afford to send the kid to school anymore...  <br/>
The kid would hide out in the barn till her mom left and then miss the bus <br/>
and go back home.  They were drawing up the papers to have her do community <br/>
service (the parent, not the kid) at the school for 3 days a week for four <br/>
months, as if she didn&#39;t have to work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-697978093">&lt;Ok I have a major question for all of you that know the laws  just a<br/>
thought,  how in this country are millions of kids dropping out of school?&gt;<br/>
by ceasing to go<br/>
&lt;are their parents taken to court?&gt;<br/>
it is possible<br/>
&lt;what about all of the pregnant girls that choose to drop out and care for<br/>
their children?<br/>
depends on how old they are<br/>
&lt;what do they go thru in order to drop out?&gt;<br/>
When I dropped out my mom signed a paper and that was it. (WA state)<br/>
 &lt;do their parents have to send in papers saying they are been<br/>
homeschooled?&gt;<br/>
mine didn&#39;t, just signed me out<br/>
 &lt;do they have to be tested each year and report to the state until they are<br/>
18?&gt;<br/>
not in WA or OR or ID (places I have lived)<br/>
&lt;now consider this, if the answer is no they do not, they just drop out no<br/>
questions asked (they are just a bad seed )  couldn&#39;t we then send our high<br/>
schoolers to school for a month or so and have them drop out and be free<br/>
from the entire system?&gt;<br/>
Theoretically<br/>
 &lt;and have them still homeschool and continue on the way we homeschool<br/>
without the hassle of sending in papers?&gt;<br/>
if  that is what you state allows, if that is how you did it before they<br/>
went to ps I would imagine sending them to ps wouldn&#39;t change that.<br/>
 &lt; now I know you couldn&#39;t have them drop out of homeschool, that would be<br/>
to obvious, but<br/>
what about dropping out of public school?&gt;<br/>
obvious? what is the point of these questions?<br/>
&lt;does anyone know the answers to these questions?&gt;<br/>
some of them<br/>
&lt;does anyone know the how old you have to be to get your ged?&gt;<br/>
I got mine at 16 in Oregon<br/>
&lt;does anyone know how these kids just drop out?&gt;<br/>
their parents let them or just don&#39;t care or they just do it<br/>
&lt;how does one graduate early from homeschool?&gt;<br/>
just do it.<br/>
&lt;why are homeschoolers required to report to the state  until the child is<br/>
18<br/>
and ps kids can graduate when they are 17?&gt;<br/>
what kind of police state are you living in?<br/>
&lt; what about my child who started k<br/>
when she just turned 5 the day school started and will be  17 when her class<br/>
graduates from highschool?  what if my child was held back in ps  for a<br/>
year, do I consider her in that lower grade  or the grade of the children of<br/>
her own age?&gt;<br/>
grades are arbitrary, meaningless, forget them.<br/>
 &lt;and how does that work out?&gt;<br/>
just fine and dandy from where I stand<br/>
&lt;just some thoughts to ponder for the day!!&gt;<br/>
thanks for the pondering fodder.<br/>
&lt;from Tanya and Mary Ellen who think that if the state is willing to just<br/>
let<br/>
kids drop out and claim they are just bad then why would they care that they<br/>
are at home learning????&gt;<br/>
because the state has to power trip over something. If they don&#39;t look busy<br/>
folks might realize they aren&#39;t necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-436458467">&lt;&lt;&lt;The following is Washington State Law:&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow! I guess the laws in WA have changed quite a bit in the past 15  years.<br/>
I don&#39;t recall there ever being a problem with missing too many days except<br/>
not completing class time. My best friend missed plenty of days and I don&#39;t<br/>
think her parents even knew about it. Is it hard to hs there now? I pulled<br/>
my step son out of school in 1992 and there didn&#39;t seem to be a problem. I<br/>
filed a paper with the district office and proceeded to use the school at my<br/>
convenience for 3 months until I re-enrolled him.  Well, anyway, Idaho is<br/>
nice.<br/>

No, hs laws haven&#39;t changed since the 80&#39;s<br/>
