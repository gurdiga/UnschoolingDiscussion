&lt;&lt; I just have this desire to make him &quot;whole&quot; again, and<br/>
 I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a reasonable or attainable<br/>

I SO understand what you mean. I feel that way about Trevor sometimes, like <br/>
all the damage totally changed who he is.<br/>
But that&#39;s just it. He is who he is. Right now, today. I can&#39;t wave a magic <br/>
wand like you wish for.....I can only accept who he is, with all the <br/>
experiences that make him who he is.  Sure, he might be a different person <br/>
than if I&#39;d unschooled from the beginning. But I love the person he is.<br/>
And I do believe that by giving him his freedom, just as you have with your <br/>
ds, they can know themselves fully again. Not be at odds with what others are <br/>
saying they &quot;should&quot; be. Just be themselves. And that&#39;s all we can do......<br/>
I understand the regret. But we can only go forward and love that amazing <br/>
person that they are now, and watch as they unfold into the person that they <br/>
will  become tomorrow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834695752">Ren, I know you&#39;re right ... it&#39;s just tough not to<br/>
feel a little guilty. Especially because of Andrew&#39;s<br/>
&quot;behavior problems&quot; in school. His self-esteem got<br/>
pretty wounded, I believe, because he was so<br/>
out-of-place in that environment.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful he is where he is now, though. And you&#39;re<br/>
right. I just have to look forward and press on. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651487215">&lt;&lt;I see the damage yet today&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ren, I totally agree.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest 2 went to school, one for a year and a half, one for 3 months and<br/>
then we did school at home for a year.  They are much more stifled, for lack<br/>
of a better word, in the way they approach problems.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 youngest have never had any type of lessons and they explore the world<br/>
in a much different way, much more enthusiasm, more originality....<br/>
