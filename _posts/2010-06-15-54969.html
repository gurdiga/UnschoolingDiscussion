<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844124091">I have a sense of how you all may respond to this but I need to get more insight because something doesn&#39;t sit right with me in reguards to how I see this concern.<br/>
My oldest son 8 does not like to follow instructions a lot of the time.  He is not completely unrulely but in many situations where there is a definate leader and where there are rules to follow he will respond rather reluctantly or defiantly.  He seemed to be enjoying Boy Scouts for the most part until one day when we were at a park where the activities were very structured. The kids couldn&#39;t do this until they explained this, you could not ride around freely on your bike, had to wear shoes, etc.  He got put off because he thought he should be able to play when he wanted and did not enjoy being told what to do.  This particular troop was through a Catholic Church and most of the boys go to the catholic school. They all seem to fall in line when needed.  (I was hoping others coul also talk about their scouting experiences and how it related to unschooling.)  He can sometimes argue points that he is very obviously wrong on and get very excited about it.  I think there was a tread recently that addressed that. I guess when he finds something that he definately wants to be part of he will follow the rules?  I guess it is better not to give him too many directions and let him just watch and learn on his own terms?  I still have conflict with in myself reguarding the more Christian, follow the higher power, hierachy way of doing things and what I get from unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543220022">My son is also in Cub Scouts. What I do is I am always there with him , some times even by his side, to facilitate<br/>
and help him.<br/>
 He needs me there to explain why or help him follow the &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>
I don;t just sit there and let him just deal with it. <br/>
He needs me.<br/>
He does not want to get frustrated. He wants to participate and have fun with the other kids.<br/>
There has been times I had to get him out of the room or situation to talk to him and calm him down.<br/>
Its always been his choice to go. If he does not want to go  he can stay home.<br/>
There are also two parents that are pretty good to help him out if I am not around and I always ask them for help.<br/>
 My son MD does follow what they ask mostly but he gets so excited sometimes that he spaces out and just plays <br/>
or does not even listen to what people are saying until you get his attention and he hears your words.<br/>
Most of the time is when he wants to help out or just go ahead and do the activity.<br/>
Helping out is his favorite but the other kids want to help too.<br/>
When he is excited he sometimes  cannot hear them  as he is not focused on things around him but in what he is doing or wants to do.<br/>
Ok this was hard to explain and I don&#39;t know if I was clear enough.<br/>
<br/>
So MD wants to be there and do the activities so I am by his side helping him achieve that,<br/>
he needs me less and less as he gets older and more mature. He is the youngest in his Den but <br/>
he enjoys it and we have fun.<br/>
I also make sure he has eaten well and had a drink before going as that can make a big difference.<br/>

I think you should coach him to know what they expect and why, and  <br/>
make recommendations of how he might manage to be cooperative. I doubt  <br/>
he WANTS to have difficulties with other people.<br/>

go and follow the rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wearing shoes, doing the activities in the order planned by the leaders, <br/>
riding his bike only when and where allowed - those don&#39;t seem at all <br/>
unreasonable for a boy scout event.<br/>
<br/>
He should decide whether the fun is worth going along with the rules. It <br/>
isn&#39;t really fair to the people doing all the work and volunteering <br/>
their time, otherwise. If you want a program that runs differently, then <br/>
you can volunteer to run one. I ran girl scout troops for many years <br/>
just so I could set them up in the more flexible way I wanted. When <br/>
Rosie was in a troop, though, with a different leader (who was VERY <br/>
rules-oriented and controlling), she chose to stay involved and deal <br/>
with it because of what she was getting out of it, herself.<br/>

<br/>
We recently (2 days ago) completed a camp for a couple of unschooling<br/>
families where the kids had different activities they could do. None of the<br/>
children were &#39;by the rules&#39; type. My husband conducted the adventure<br/>
activities, since I was busy with N.<br/>
<br/>
He is NOT an &#39;unschooly type&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
His feedback on the whole thing (one set of parents in particular) was &quot;This<br/>
kind of a thing works better without parents emphasizing choices<br/>
unnecessarily and choices that diminish the potential experience&quot; In his<br/>
opinion, there was no need to micro-analyze the &#39;do or not&#39; of things<br/>
without an idea of what the experience was like, once the decision to attend<br/>
was made and he thinks it was dysfunctional. He thinks, the children would<br/>
have felt better supported if the parent helped them find ways that they<br/>
could work with the rules of the environment rather than see if they were<br/>
comfortable or not and offer withdrawal.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere in life, there are conditions. Visiting people, hobby classes,<br/>
scouts, camps, jobs, family, friends.... It is part of being functional in<br/>
any group to be able to adapt to its conditions if necessary. It seems,<br/>
signing on for something defines the &#39;necessary&#39; for my husband. He feels<br/>
strongly that it is important the child learn to &#39;go with the flow&#39; unless<br/>
the circumstances are somehow invasive or impossible. I see this as a give<br/>
and take. Negotiations can happen. Also the &#39;learning to go with the flow&#39;<br/>
need not happen right now, or at every instance there is a conflict. But, as<br/>
a larger pattern, sure, I think its important that there are increasing<br/>
instances of attempting to adapt if the desire to belong exists.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see as much of an issue as he did, but I do share his observation<br/>
that there was constant attention and inquiries as to comfort, which<br/>
probably magnified the smallest discomfort by verbalizing it and fixing a<br/>
&#39;position&#39; on it at first awareness. Perhaps we are more used to stretching<br/>
boundaries, but it seems to me that any new experience involves moving out<br/>
of the familiar and it is likely not going to help the learning process if<br/>
support entails either withdrawal, breaking norms or leaving to own terms.<br/>
<br/>
My impression now is that living in an environment with very few rules, the<br/>
children genuinely had no clue how to cope with rules imposed by people they<br/>
didn&#39;t already know well enough. It wasn&#39;t so much as they didn&#39;t want, as<br/>
it was a whole new array of considerations beyond what they were used to.<br/>
The support they got was in terms of checking on their comfort and offering<br/>
options of not doing the activity or persuading the instructors to let them<br/>
do what they wanted. I think of it now, but it didn&#39;t occur to me then. They<br/>
literally had no previous experience of being responsible for their actions<br/>
in an environment that deemed some of them appropriate and others not. It<br/>
would have helped if we could have supported them through the process of<br/>
working out the importance/significance of them, or even if we could simply<br/>
have provided encouragement and caring that made stretching boundaries like<br/>
that easier.<br/>
<br/>
Though honestly,it didn&#39;t seem like the end of the world to me. Some<br/>
opportunities are more suited to adaptation than others *shrug*. This wasn&#39;t<br/>
the only one. There were likely many opportunities closer to their comfort<br/>
zone if the lives of the kids were seen as a continuity than a snapshot in a<br/>
camp.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how it goes with parents unfamiliar with the challenge of the<br/>
unfamiliar (yikes! talk of convoluted), but a possibility seemed that there<br/>
could be ways to discover how to learn to find new balances in changed<br/>
environments. Of course, its easy for me to see possibilities when I neither<br/>
conducted the activities nor participated in them. Perhaps, in the<br/>
situation, I might have made many choices that seemed excessively safe to<br/>
the point of closing off new experience. I don&#39;t know, but this is very<br/>
alive in me right now, as a parent, member of a community and as an<br/>
experiential learning facilitator.<br/>

You wrote, &quot; Perhaps we are more used to stretching boundaries, but...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I think you meant (but am not positive) that &quot;we&quot; would include  <br/>
everyone in this discussion, but the &quot;they&quot; would be your husband?   <br/>
(And other evil-doers?  *joking*)<br/>
<br/>
If I volunteer to run a music session (which I have and I do  <br/>
sometimes), I&#39;m not interested in accommodating the special mom- <br/>
supported oddities of any particular participant.   There is an  <br/>
implied &quot;if-then&quot; when someone volunteers to run an activity, and  <br/>
&quot;we&quot; (the queen of England, an editor, or someone with tape  <br/>
worms?) ...   And *I* really, truly, don&#39;t want to spend any of the  <br/>
short time scheduled to me to do something with a group on trying to  <br/>
persuade an unschooling mom that it&#39;s really NOT okay for her darling  <br/>
child to do whatever noisy,  distracting thing he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
IF someone thinks playing a piano with a skateboard is fine, then that  <br/>
person needs to purchase a piano for that purpose.  Do it at home.   <br/>
Some things should be kept at home, or at least done with one&#39;s own  <br/>
equipment.  It&#39;s okay for Pete Townshend to bust up his own guitar  <br/>
(kind of wasteful and irritating to some people, including the Fender  <br/>
company, I think), but it&#39;s really not even NEARLY okay for him or for  <br/>
anyone else to bust up one of MY guitars.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is a way to parent that not many people are familiar with.<br/>
It involves a lot of discovery since the context for balance isn&#39;t<br/>
likely to be clear until a bit more awareness and experience is<br/>
underway.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that really helps us avoid getting into things that Karl<br/>
isn&#39;t ready for is to talk about what he might encounter beforehand.<br/>
He has often opted out (not always) of things that he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
do. We have gone home rather than disrupt others. I have definitely<br/>
talked with him about it right then and there too if it looks like he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to be there after all. And absolutely, if he&#39;s hungry or<br/>
thirsty, and I haven&#39;t provided for that then I find some place that<br/>
has something for him nearby (example from this summer: he was thirsty<br/>
at the park, so we took a short break at a gas station a block away<br/>
for a drink and a bathroom visit).<br/>
<br/>
I typically deal with safety concerns in the moment but they are more<br/>
like reminders of how to be safe than options of whether or not to be<br/>
safe! I forgot about safety all the time when I was a kid and I don&#39;t<br/>
think that&#39;s at all unusual. Sometimes reminders were annoying if they<br/>
were very frequent or more detailed than I wanted, and that&#39;s<br/>
definitely true of Karl too.  When he was younger, he was perfectly<br/>
happy with more frequent safety reminders and now that he&#39;s older of<br/>
course that&#39;s changing. :)<br/>

<br/>
Oops. Actually, the we was my husband and I, as relatively veteran in the<br/>
outdoors. Even with an infant, we weren&#39;t at all anxious about things like<br/>
coping and comfort. We simply paid attention, and lived in the moment. Baby<br/>
was smiling all through (except power outages till we fanned him). I imagine<br/>
that if I was anxious, I&#39;d have less flexibility - both to allow new<br/>
experiences in as well as to resolve issues with all my resources at hand.<br/>
<br/>
So that &#39;we&#39; was about the ones with experience living in the physical<br/>
conditions and &#39;they&#39; was those new to them.<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, in other ways, it did pan out like you said.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462160375">If my kids want to go the the pool at the Athletic  Club ( where we are members) one of  the rules is <br/>
no running around the pool.<br/>
They can run around at a friends pool or their cousin&#39;s pool<br/>
but at the Athletic Club there are rules that we need to follow.<br/>
 Same with Cub Scouts.<br/>
 or any other activity or  place that we may go.<br/>
 Just today I had a hard time at the post office with the kids.<br/>
Next time I will find a way to go without them. Its just too much for them right now.<br/>
 I confess I lost it and we had a talk in the car.<br/>
We then went to a pet store since our Gold Fish is sick and we are trying to find out what it<br/>
going on.<br/>
I asked them if they wanted to go home and I would come back to do it and they could be home<br/>
playing but they both chose to go and we had a great time there.<br/>
Of course pet shops are way better for kids than the lame post office waiting in line and all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would depend a whoooooole lot on the specifics of kids and parents and situation and teacher. There have been any number of times I&#39;ve gone with Mo or Ray to some class or group ready to pack up and go at a moment&#39;s notice if she or he wasn&#39;t comfortable with the experience - because with either of them &quot;uncomfortable&quot; could become &quot;meltdown&quot; and that wouldn&#39;t be fun for anyone involved. <br/>
<br/>
Just this past weekend I brought Mo (8) to a yoga class with me, ready to leave if she wasn&#39;t comfortable with the situation. Of course, knowing my kid as I do, I also did a whole lot of prep-work: packed a bag with a dozen other things for her to do, brought a set of special yoga props and cards, and checked in with the teacher. That kind of proactivity is a good idea if you know in advance that your kid tends to have difficulties in group or class situations. It lets you have more options than &quot;break the rules or leave&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Then again, I also don&#39;t really use the sort of continual checking-in process that Vidyut describes - I stay focused on my kid in the moment if the situation seems to call for that, and maybe that&#39;s a key difference. I don&#39;t *have to* check in because I&#39;m right there, seeing the interest or withdrawal or discomfort and ready to offer another option before things get to the &quot;uncomfortable&quot; point, without making a big deal about it all.  <br/>

now it is just overall confusing.<br/>
<br/>
But - if you go there, you can look at the left-side menu and at the <br/>

when you&#39;re stuck waiting in lines, sitting at the doctor&#39;s office, or <br/>
on a car drive.  We played most of these at the Life is Good Conference <br/>
and they were really fun.<br/>

Feel free to play around with the rules of any games to make them more <br/>
suitable for your family, of course.<br/>

<br/>
And what might end up happening is, you would likely not feel so much like volunteering anymore if you felt your gear would be mistreated, and then everyone else who wanted to participate in the sessions would miss out.  When someone facilitates something things go a lot more smoothly when they feel confident that those around them will be behaving respectfully and appropriate to the situation.  Things like cubscouts are volunteer as well.</div>

How often does he get to go to the park?   How often does he get to play with other kids?   If a trip to the park with other kids (which is pretty exciting!) only happens during Boy Scouts, maybe he needs more opportunity for play and park outside of Scouts.   Maybe some kind of play group would be better for him right now.    <br/>
<br/>
There was a homeschooled kid used to come to Dylan&#39;s Karate class who only wanted to play.   He lived way out of town and didn&#39;t get to play with other kids.   When he got to Karate, where there were a bunch of kids, following instructions was too much for him to cope with. <br/>

actions. For example, a child finding a new activity difficult will likely<br/>
be scared to attempt it. One possibility is to cue in to that fear and offer<br/>
withdrawal. Another is to change the activity to eliminate the fear<br/>
*changing the very nature of what is being attempted*. What seemed natural<br/>
and empowering (also commonly done in camps) to both of us, but we didn&#39;t<br/>
see playing out was to remain aware of the fear, offer support and encourage<br/>
trying out to whatever level the child could attempt without getting<br/>
excessively scared/overwhelmed. In our experience, it is a common factor of<br/>
stretching boundaries - becoming aware of the uncertainty of the desired new<br/>
experience and learning to adapt. I think it is a valuable learning for life<br/>
whether it is about rules or adventure.<br/>
<br/>
We found that making the least discomfort significant and offering immediate<br/>
choices (without knowing what the experience would feel like) seemed to<br/>
lessen the child&#39;s tolerance for the unfamiliarity. For example, my husband<br/>
observed that it was usually the parent diverting the child&#39;s attention with<br/>
inquiries as to comfort. If I ask you if you are comfortable right now, you<br/>
are likely to become aware of whether the chair under your bottom feels<br/>
wholly comfortable or not, which didn&#39;t matter till I asked. Not to mention<br/>
that it kept pulling the child out of the &#39;flow&#39;, which is something that<br/>
allows a child to be engrossed and overcome minor inconveniences in the<br/>
pursuit of learning.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is important to deny comfort for learning, but I do think<br/>
that it is healthy to go beyond absolute comfort when one finds something<br/>
interesting. It is what enables us to be functional in anything that isn&#39;t<br/>
solely focused on us.<br/>

I&#39;m not saying you should adapt the class or stretch it to meet other kinds of needs if you&#39;re not comfortable doing that! more that this is something for parents to think about before trying a class or club or group even with a child who doesn&#39;t adapt in typical ways. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783586584">My family is involved with a 4-H program (gardening) that meets both inside and outside.  The first time or second time we met, the black flies were biting and ds (8 yrs) decided he would go inside (we had bug nets, but no repellent on).  While I made a trip to the car with my toddler, one of the leaders told him everyone inside that they had to go outside.  My son went along with this, but was upset.  He did not talk to her about it and didn&#39;t tell me until the program was over.  Later he said that he didn&#39;t want to go back for the next meeting because he was afraid that he would be told he would have to go outside.  I talked to him about different ideas in case he still might come (some of the range of ideas were: stay at Daddy&#39;s work while the rest of us go, participate only in inside activities, not go at all, go after black fly season, wear bug repellent and long pants and sleeves and a bug net, etc).  I also called the leaders ahead of time to explain that he didn&#39;t want to participate in the outside part at all if he felt uncomfortable about the bugs and asked if it was okay if he came and only participated in the inside parts of the program.  I thought I should ask them for permission since  what he might want to do might differ from what was expected and anticipated and also I wouldn&#39;t want my son to influence others to stay inside if the group is doing outside activities.  Turned out that the leaders were understanding.  When it came time to do some outdoor activities, they asked him if he wanted to do specific things, but didn&#39;t push it.  Li seemed comfortable with this too.  He did opt to do some things outside and thankfully the bugs were much less bothersome.  Laurie</div>

<br/>
My concern is that as he gets older it will get even harder for him to do group activites. He rarely joins in a group activity when there is an opportunity, and turns down anything I suggest. My 7 year old has no desire for any group activity either but he is very engaged with lots of interests. Whereas I can see my 7 year old accepting a rulebound group at some point, when it is a way to pursue an interest, I feel I might be unwittingly narrowing my 5 year olds options.<br/>

wants to be with you more? Find out. If he can&#39;t tell you, keep  <br/>

him to love just &quot;one&quot; thing, passionately. Perhaps he hasn&#39;t found it  <br/>

We can&#39;t see into the future on what will be harder or easier for our  <br/>
kids. We can help them right now, where they are, with what they want  <br/>
and like. We can show them what&#39;s good and fun about group activities  <br/>
and they can chose. We can be okay with their wanting to pursue more  <br/>
solitary interests.<br/>

When your neighbor said that her son&#39;s teachers would have a hard job  <br/>
&quot;breaking&quot; your son, that would&#39;ve been a good time to reassure  <br/>
yourself that you&#39;re doing right by your son. So he won&#39;t be &quot;broken&quot;.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning to get along in society, knowing when to go along and when to <br/>
step out of line, those are important skills for everybody. But they <br/>
don&#39;t need to be learned in structured group activities. That is not the <br/>
only option.<br/>
<br/>
Within a family there is going to have to be give and take if <br/>
everybody&#39;s interests and needs are going to be honored. Being part of a <br/>
family IS being part of a group activity.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent thinks a kid isn&#39;t getting a good sense of how to behave in <br/>
a group, maybe they just aren&#39;t getting out much? Every time we go to <br/>
the movies, for example, my kids were learning to be considerate to <br/>
others (either by me coaching them or by the rude examples of others). <br/>
We often did little one-time things - like sitting and watching a demo <br/>
at a science museum. They even learned to raise their hands when they <br/>
wanted to respond to a question.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, unschooled kids are far more likely to question <br/>
authority and to assume something is okay for them to do and to just <br/>
stop doing something if they aren&#39;t interested in continuing it.  This <br/>
can come across as undisciplined to people who expect kids to be quite <br/>
obedient and unquestioning.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in what Vidyut&#39;s husband thought - I agree that I&#39;ve seem <br/>
some of that, too, where it seems like the parents are overly <br/>
uncomfortable with their kids having a hard time with something. To <br/>
constantly ask if a kid wants to stop or if they need help or does that <br/>
hurt or is this too hard, etc., seems like it has to be undermining to a <br/>
kid&#39;s confidence. I&#39;ve seen parents remind a kid three or four times <br/>
within in an hour, &quot;You don&#39;t have to do this if you don&#39;t want to.&quot; <br/>
This happens when they see their kid struggling or feeling frustrated, <br/>
but I&#39;ve seen parents anticipate that before it has actually happened.<br/>
<br/>
I think most unschooled kids probably know they don&#39;t have to do it. The <br/>
parents are reacting to their own experience as a child who knew they <br/>
DID have to do whatever they were given to do. Again, no hard and fast <br/>
rule. I can imagine a child who might feel pressured and need to hear <br/>
that it was okay to stop, but I agree with Vidyut and her husband that <br/>
kids also need some support for sticking to something, too, not <br/>
too-quick encouragement to give up.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we did do group activities - storytime at the library, tours <br/>
with our homeschooling group - that weren&#39;t ongoing commitments and we <br/>
could just leave if things weren&#39;t working out well. That is the kind of <br/>
thing I&#39;d recommend starting with when kids are little and sticking with <br/>
for kids who have a harder time in groups. There are zillions of <br/>
opportunities like that.<br/>

<br/>
We also did a lot of group activities when Senna was little. We did  <br/>
gymnastics, riding, naturalists club, pottery class, dance class,  <br/>
family camp, beach days, gym days, park days, field trips. Some of  <br/>
those were totally optional, a few were regularly-scheduled things.  <br/>
When Senna had difficulty in some of the optional situations, we  <br/>
should have left and we didn&#39;t. That was my fault. There are a few  <br/>
things I regret about our early homeschooling/unschooling life:  <br/>
expecting her to act like every other kid; not leaving when things  <br/>
weren&#39;t working out well for her; and going to too many group  <br/>
activities that she was not ready for nor interested in. I tried to  <br/>
make her into someone she wasn&#39;t, when if I&#39;d taken it more slowly and  <br/>
mindfully, I would have been more open to other ways to help her in  <br/>
those situations.<br/>
<br/>
As she&#39;s gotten older, Senna (15)  knows what&#39;s expected in group  <br/>
situations and yet still struggles at times. She has that &quot;hair- <br/>
trigger&quot; emotional response we&#39;ve talked about. She generally knows  <br/>
how to deal with that, but sometimes still needs assistance. In any  <br/>
case, she most often chooses time with a few friends over group  <br/>
settings. She is sociable with adults, a good friend, and fun to be  <br/>
with. *And* she&#39;d most often rather have alone time to work on her  <br/>
games, sculpting, reading and socializing on Facebook &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
My dd doesn&#39;t have many rules in her home environment and never has, really, but she&#39;s very well aware of rules in the rest of the world. We don&#39;t live in a bubble. Shops and libraries, cars and cinemas all have rules. She&#39;s tried a few classes here and there and its not the rules she objects to (its being treated the way most adults treat children). When she visits friends and relatives with or without a parent she&#39;s very comfortable with following other people&#39;s rules. <br/>
<br/>
My stepson struggles more with rules - he has more baggage around them. He&#39;s had years of school at home and public school and living with his bio mom who has lots and lots of rules and shoulds so when he runs into a rule its still sometimes his first impulse to fight against it. To some extent that depends on where he&#39;s been and what he&#39;s been doing recently - when he&#39;s here or hanging out with his adult friends he&#39;s more easy going about other people&#39;s rules, but when he&#39;s been visiting his mom or relatives or working for someone with lots of rules he gets testy and resistant.<br/>

Would that be a crisis? He might find the sorts of structured group activities for kids difficult, but not the same sorts of activities done with friends, or in a less structured environment - or even in a structured environment for adults. My 8yo, who dislikes being treated the way people treat children, enjoys going to group activities for adults, for instance. She also enjoys group activites when the participants are unschooling kids ;)<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of things I don&#39;t do as a planned group activity that I enjoy doing solo, or with friends - sports is a good example. I learned to loathe team sports in school and thought I was terrible at them, only to discover I&#39;m really more ept than I knew. When I play with a group of friends, my natural abilities come out much more strongly than in a class or competitive environment. <br/>

fact, because they&#39;ve chosen to opt in, knowing there are rules, they <br/>
are FAR more likely to follow rules than the rest of the kids, <br/>
typically. Mine are frequently still surprised by how other kids try to <br/>

<br/>
On the other hand, my kid are fairly sensitive to being barked at or <br/>
talked to in a demeaning manner and by far THE most common reason <br/>
they&#39;ve opted out of activities has been that the adult in charge wasn&#39;t <br/>

This describes my younger daughter to a T. Actually both daughters, but the<br/>
older one (now 14yo) will put up with irritating adults occasionally if she<br/>
has to tolerate them to be with her friends  - for her, friends sometimes<br/>
outweigh the adult BS factor.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter went for three months of first grade, and then we<br/>
homeschooled, moving to unschooling after a couple of years. She&#39;s now 12<br/>
years old. She&#39;s always refused to do group sports or swim lessons or camps<br/>
because she doesn&#39;t like the way the adults treat the kids.But she does play<br/>
the violin pretty seriously and loves violin lessons and orchestra. And<br/>
she&#39;s an enthusiastic member of a youth theater company. Both activities<br/>
with a lot of rules.<br/>
<br/>
When she and her older sister were in Girl Scouts I first volunteered as the<br/>
extra parent, and then became the co-leader. Between the two of them I did<br/>
Girl Scouts for six years. I was that involved so that I could influence the<br/>
troop&#39;s activities and help a kid (not always mine!) if they were having a<br/>
hard time. We&#39;re still friends with many of those girls, thought we don&#39;t<br/>
see them much as they&#39;re all in school and everyone&#39;s busy.<br/>

Good point!  And if it&#39;s hard for a young child to do group  <br/>
activities, how much harder would his life be if he were in school?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an unschooling issue, really; it&#39;s a compassion issue.<br/>
<br/>
Some adults don&#39;t like to go out in public.  Most of them suffered  <br/>
through school trauma and taunting that probably have made their adult  <br/>
situation much worse.<br/>
