<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605997931">Hi Susan, <br/>
The symptoms your son is experiencing before doing something new sounds like an anxiety type disorder (he could have this in addition to learning dificulties). I&#39;m no expert, but my dd10 has similar symptoms and we suspect she has obsessive compulsive disorder. These  type of panic symptoms are very uncomfortable for them, and apparently they can get help to free themselves.  A website that has checklists to help you find out if that could be happening with your son is www.adaa.org . <br/>
It took some thinking and reading about this, and a little anxiety on my part, before consulting a therapist. She has now started to see an LCSW. Part of my anxiety was about homeschooling, but it hasn&#39;t been an issue. Look at all the activities you&#39;ve described your son doing:you&#39;re not isolating him! And this is just someone to consult with, you can find someone else if you&#39;re not happy. Maybe have one appt. for you just to talk to the therapist so you aren&#39;t talking about him or school or whatever in front of him.  <br/>
We are just beginning down this road, so maybe someone further along has more answers, but you could just begin by addressing this part of your son&#39;s life- then investigate more about other learning differences. I have some more resources, you can e-mail me privately if you&#39;d like. <br/>
