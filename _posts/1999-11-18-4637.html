In reply about the dog seizures I read in the April 1999 issue of The<br/>
Whole Dog Journal that a daily dose of a 1/2 teaspoon of dolomite will<br/>
do the trick.  You may also want to consider feeding your pets a raw<br/>
food diet.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/1158/animals.htm">http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/1158/animals.htm</a>  <br/>
This is an excellent site!!<br/>
You may even want to reconsider the yearly pet vaccinations.  My breeder<br/>
just sent me an article on this issue, which was very enlightening.  <br/>
I hope that you find this helpful!<br/>

&lt;&lt;I haven&#39;t even introduced myself.... and I don&#39;t really know if this<br/>
is<br/>
the <br/>
right list to ask this question.... =) So please don&#39;t be angry with<br/>
me if <br/>
its not..... <br/>
I have a dog that is having seizures.... not very often though. The<br/>
last <br/>
one was over 2 months ago and very short. He just had one, and it lasted <br/>
for like 2-3 minutes.... is there anything anyone can suggest???<br/>
Herbs, <br/>
oils????<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
