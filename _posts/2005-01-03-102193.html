<div id="ygrps-yiv-942960827">Curious for some advice about how you detected it. I am well aware of the over-diagnosis <br/>
of ADD and have resisted this diagnosis for one of my kids for years. But I am at a point <br/>
where the teen&#39;s personal viewpoint must be taken into account and so we are looking into  <br/>
whether or not this is something he is dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
Was there specific testing you went through? Did you go through a GP or a Psychiatrist? <br/>
Did you choose to use meds? How did the therapy for ADD work for you as an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for advice,<br/>
Julie B</div>
