<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369835696">Hiya.<br/>
I&#39;m fourteen years old, I live in Minnesota an hour or so west of <br/>
Minneapolis and I attend the Minnetonka Middle School West. <br/>
<br/>
Tell you the truth, I&#39;d rather not. I want nothing more to get out of <br/>
that little yellow building and write myself a book and see where that <br/>
takes me. My mother doesn&#39;t understand however, she can&#39;t imagine <br/>
someone teaching themselves, it feels like she ignores the proof I put <br/>
in front of her eyes. <br/>
<br/>
This relationship has grown increasingly frustrating. I can&#39;t do much <br/>
anything but try to get away from it whenever I can. It&#39;s to the point <br/>
where I&#39;ve realized my family is no different from anyone else, I&#39;m <br/>
just as likely to love or hate them and lately, all I can do is hate <br/>
my parents and wish my elder siblings could do more for me.<br/>
<br/>
The real problem is I&#39;m plain no good at math and no one can make me <br/>
try harder at their way, I&#39;m done with the schools way, I&#39;d like to <br/>
learn in a more practical manner. That&#39;s pretty horrifying to my <br/>
mother.<br/>
<br/>
So really what I want to know from the adults on this website, what <br/>
made you decide to take your kids out of school? If anyone can give me <br/>
a way out of all this I&#39;d appreciate it more than you could imagine. <br/>
Another thing I&#39;d like to do is put together peoples stories and make <br/>
a quote log of things to convince the average person unschooling is <br/>
sensible. E-mail me or something... I don&#39;t know I just think there <br/>
must be something I can do.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883564391">My kid asked me and as he was 4 at the time and I wasn&#39;t too impressed with<br/>
school, I thought, why not.  He&#39;s 5 now and I&#39;ve met tons of people that do<br/>
this and that is what keeps me here - that could help your mom - can you<br/>
find a local homeschooling list, even if not unschooling, some unschoolers<br/>
are on homeschooling lists.<br/>
 <br/>
Find a group that meets in for park days even if the kids are under 10, some<br/>
of them will have been doing it for 5 years and that&#39;s worth something.<br/>
 <br/>
Get some books - John Holt - Growing without schooling, Pat Ferenga did the<br/>
last book - here&#39;s the website - www. &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com">http://www.holtgws.com</a>&gt; holtgws.com <br/>
Sandra Dodd - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
 <br/>
Lots of resources out there! :)  Hunt on Amazon.com for some books.<br/>
 <br/>
If your family is not open to home or unschooling, check out getting a GED<br/>
to free yourself from school. :)  Not as hard as it sounds.  Get the book<br/>
and study on your own over the summer - show them you can reach your goals,<br/>
if you want to do that as a goal.<br/>
 <br/>
Or write a book anyway.  What are you doing this summer? :)<br/>
 <br/>
My folks told me over and over again that writing was nice, but that I&#39;d<br/>
never make a living. Maybe, maybe not, but write if you must. I got into<br/>
computer, paid better and still I came back to writing. Now I write computer<br/>
courses, teach online and just wrote a computer book.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe eventually I&#39;ll shake off all their layers of worry to be able to<br/>
write a real book.<br/>
 <br/>
Remember, no one can imprison your mind unless they let you.  So, I was<br/>
weak. :)  Still working on it. :)<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, math is cool in some places, when it makes sense. :)  A good teacher<br/>
can make all the diff.<br/>
 <br/>
If your folks truly won&#39;t let you try something like unschooling, go the<br/>
other way.  Can you take a course at the local community college?<br/>
 <br/>
Being among others who are there because they want to be not have to be and<br/>
who think a different way can help you clear your mind and determine your<br/>
direction.<br/>
 <br/>
Take a writing or a math course, or both.  Your best and worst! :)  If you<br/>
don&#39;t like the math course, DROP it!  It&#39;s not you!  It&#39;s them.  Math does<br/>
make sense. Many math teachers do not (no offense to any math teachers, some<br/>
are good). :)<br/>
 <br/>
Summer is coming up.  WRITE THAT BOOK!  Take a class.<br/>
 <br/>
I wrote my computer book in 3 months - could have been faster if I wasn&#39;t<br/>
lazy, but that&#39;s just me - as you see, I am verbose. :)<br/>
 <br/>
Take care, feel free to write! :)<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270209533">Have you read the &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace llewelyn?<br/>
<br/>
Also - even if they won&#39;t agree and you&#39;re stuck in school - try this <br/>
other book by the same author -  &quot;Guerrilla Learning: How to Give Your <br/>
Kids a Real Education With or Without School&quot; by Grace Llewellyn. Maybe <br/>
your parents would read it? Maybe it&#39;ll give you ideas of how to <br/>
convince them to consider unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646205844">Oh, dear.  We are in Mn, a bit north of you by a couple of hours, but <br/>
you are not alone here!  Try the unschoolingmn yahoo group-- lots of <br/>
good people there, maybe you could connect with someone near you, let <br/>
your parents meet with those parents??  Ask one or both of your <br/>
parents to drop online in there and maybe some of us could answer any <br/>
concerns??  Invite them to this group, too.<br/>
<br/>
Also, our state has a great (and especially the cities) alternative <br/>
school system, if your parents can&#39;t help you get out.  I attended the <br/>
Ridgedale Alternative school when it was at the Y (still is?), which <br/>
is still school, but less of it ;)<br/>
<br/>
Do read the Teenage Liberation Handbook.  I am not a teen and my kids <br/>
are not teens, but there is a wealth of help and wisdom to find in <br/>
there.  This October, Grace Llewellyn (the book&#39;s author) will be in <br/>
Minneapolis at the Minnesota Homeschooler&#39;s Alliance <br/>
(www.homeschoolers.org) fall conference.  Bring them there.  My first <br/>
attendance to the MHA conference was earth-shattering-- I sat in on a <br/>
panel discussion for unschooling and immediately knew that was what I <br/>
had to do for my girls!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to you!<br/>
