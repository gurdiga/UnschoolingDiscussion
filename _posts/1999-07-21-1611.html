<div id="ygrps-yiv-659113332">Hi Andi and all!<br/>
Andi asked me to tell her about our trip, but I thought you all might like to <br/>
hear about it!<br/>
<br/>
Gettysburg was so cool.  We went up in 400 ft tower and viewed the entire <br/>
battlefield.  We went on a 2 hour bus tour with a guide that described the <br/>
whole battle for us.  We drove the battelfield ourselves and got out of the <br/>
car and stood on some momentous spots in history.  We stood right on the ver <br/>
spot where General Reynolds (Union) felll as he led the Iron Brigade on an <br/>
attack on the edge of what is now called Reynold&#39;s Woods.  We took a 2 hour <br/>
train ride during which the Confederate Army took over the train and held us <br/>
prisoner!<br/>
<br/>
As you walked down the streets, many people were dressed in period costume <br/>
and answering questions from the public.  We saw a house with over 150 bullet <br/>
holes in it fired by the federal army at a confederate sharpshooter in an <br/>
upper window.  We drove past a house where a cannon ball was still lodged on <br/>
the side of it.  We saw a barn were a cannon ball was shot clear through it, <br/>
literally, you could see straight through the barn to the otherside!  We saw <br/>
the home of Jenny Wade, the only civilian casulty in Gettysburg.  She was <br/>
making bread in her kitchen when she was hit in the back by a stray federal <br/>
bullet.<br/>
<br/>
The re-enactments were really something.  I even began to cry.  I am very <br/>
sensitive and really get wrapped up in things that I see.  I feel things very <br/>
deeply.  The sounds of the cannons and guns, the soldiers yelling out <br/>
commands, the men falling to the ground.  All very emotionally moving.  I <br/>
would encourage anyone who has a chance to see a re-enactment to do so.<br/>
<br/>
And the cemetary was very humbling and saddening.  We saw the spot where <br/>
Lincoln had given the Gettyburg Address dedicating the cemetary in memorium <br/>
of the soldiers who fell there.  We were too tired to walk up and touch it by <br/>
that time :-(<br/>
<br/>
Now how is that for studying history!!!!!  I never learned that much about <br/>
Gettysburg in school!!!<br/>
<br/>
When we got back home we rented the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and got goosebumps <br/>
when we saw the soldiers standing and fighting, and living where we had stood <br/>
just a couple of days before.  And TLC and the History channle ran segments <br/>
on the Battle of Gettysburg for a couple of weeks after.  That just <br/>
enthralled us even more.  And the boys were more readily willing to watch the <br/>
movie and segments after we had actually been there.<br/>
<br/>
We were there on the actual dates of the battle, July 2 & 3, 1999.  the <br/>
battle was over three days, July 1,2, & 3, 1863.  So the town was done up and <br/>
ready to re-live its past.  So many of the homes there now were there during <br/>
the Civil War.  And I, as an architecture freak, had a hayday just looking at <br/>
the houses and buildings.<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful memory and good knowledge we now have!  I will definitely <br/>
hit the road more this year to live and learn history on the road (the best <br/>
way i think).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199020536">You know,  your e-mail brought back vivid memories of my family&#39;s (the one I<br/>
was born into) trip to Gettysburg when I was a child.  The train ride...and<br/>
being &quot;attacked&quot; during it is my favorite part!!<br/>
Thanks for that e-mail!!! :-)     Susan<br/>

What a great way to learn about history.  If you&#39;re in the mood to make more<br/>
trips like this, I can strongly recommend Williamsburg (including Jamestown,<br/>
Yorktown and Carter&#39;s Grove), Plymouth Plantation, and Concord and<br/>
Lexington.  The first year we were homeschooling, we visited Concord and<br/>
Lexington in the summer and Yorktown in the fall. Within a few months, the<br/>
kids saw where the Revolution began and ended.  To this day (four years<br/>
later), I think they know more about aspects of American history than do a<br/>
lot of adults.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, since you liked the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, you might want to take a look<br/>
at the novel from which it was taken, &quot;Killer Angels&quot;.  The movie is very<br/>
true to the book but couldn&#39;t really be as good because the novel has so<br/>
many special qualities that don&#39;t transfer to film. It&#39;s my absolutely<br/>
favorite book, I think I&#39;ve read it at least ten times!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865888710">Don&#39;t forget Shakertown!  It&#39;s a Shaker village.  The Shakers were celibate<br/>
by religious practice,  and, thus,  died out!  But you can see where Shaker<br/>
style furniture...and Shaker bread comes from,  among many other things!<br/>
<br/>
BTW,  we&#39;re planning a trip to Sarasota in Sept.    Anybody know of sites<br/>
near there?   There&#39;s a museum called Gee Whiz,  which we can get into using<br/>
the reciprocal agreement on our museum pass.  Anybody have a review?<br/>

 but it seems like I&#39;ve heard something about some part of it being open to <br/>
the public....anybody know anything else about it???<br/>
