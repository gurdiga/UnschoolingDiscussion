<div id="ygrps-yiv-548776137">Hi Kristine,<br/>
It was me who bought up the unschooling handbook. That is what it is called<br/>
and amazon.com has it.  It isn&#39;t very expensive and the information is<br/>
awesome!!!! I also love the John Holt Time to Learn or something along those<br/>
lines.<br/>

Someone mentioned an unschooling handbook and I was wondering if I could get<br/>
<br/>
some feedback about books to read about unschooling.  I realize there may be<br/>
<br/>
one BIG BOOK that turned things around, if so I&#39;d like to read it.  <br/>
Otherwise, additional &quot;top unschooling book&quot; recommendations are very much <br/>
appreciated!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
