&gt; It seems to me that the most appropriate and timely political action<br/>
&gt; would be to call the White House and your senators and say that any<br/>
&gt; retaliation against other countries should makes sure to avoid innocent<br/>
&gt; civilian casualties.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Avoid? We can try. Guarantee? There is no way to make sure of this, short of<br/>
doing nothing at all (and that will just make the innocent civilian<br/>
casualties Americans instead).<br/>
<br/>
I do not in any way believe that doing nothing at all will appease our<br/>
enemy, or make them just leave us alone. I don&#39;t know many people who DO<br/>
believe that.<br/>
<br/>
We can make sure we take every reasonable step to go after only military and<br/>
terrorist targets. We can&#39;t make sure no innocent civilians get killed.<br/>
<br/>
We will make mistakes, large and small, in the coming war. We will be guilty<br/>
of gross stupidity and even occasionally outright malice by individual or<br/>
some groups of American soldiers. We will be trying to kill terrorists who<br/>
many not and probably will not hesitate to hide behind women and children.<br/>
<br/>
War isn&#39;t pretty, nor is it clean, nor is it possible to make it &quot;only about<br/>
the bad guys&quot; and nobody else.<br/>
<br/>
War is hell, and we&#39;d better brace ourselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762914461">I wasn&#39;t looking for an argument, or a lecture.  I was simply passing on a<br/>
post  that I received on another list.  A gas station in a nearby town was<br/>
set on fire last night because a Muslim works there.  I was happy to have<br/>
the links provided so that I could voice my feelings to our representatives.<br/>

<br/>
Did you want to post something to a list with hundreds of people on it and <br/>
not get any feedback?  If feedback is bad, why should we have a mailing list <br/>
at all?<br/>
<br/>
I think senators and representatives know all the stuff that was in that <br/>
letter and much, much more, and that sending form letters is never going to <br/>
be 1/10 as effective as personal, individual, thought-out messages.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my opinion. <br/>
