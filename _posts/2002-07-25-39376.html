<div id="ygrps-yiv-170355004">Our child was diagnosed with ADD and learning disabilities. We have spent <br/>
hours and hours tutoring him and working with him individually.  After <br/>
three years of special help, he still can&#39;t spell to save his life.  Well, <br/>
I finally got smart.  After being reassured by learning specialists umpteen <br/>
times that he was not dyslexic, I decided to take him for an eye exam at <br/>
the University of Houston Eye Institute, despite the fact he&#39;d had previous <br/>
eye exams in school.<br/>
<br/>
Lo and behold, he is very far sighted.  He&#39;s been struggling to compensate <br/>
for years, and eeked by.  Had we known three years ago, he&#39;d have had quite <br/>
a different experience in school, and probably would have been reading <br/>
quite well by now, and his whole attitude toward school would have been <br/>
quite different.<br/>
<br/>
Before you accept any learning disability diagnosis, get the vision and <br/>
neurology checked.<br/>
