&lt;&lt; Hi Ren.  I tried looking at pensacolaunschoolers.com and received an <br/>
 error message.  Perhaps the address isn&#39;t correct?  Thanks.  Donna in <br/>
 Florida. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s correct. And I was just there today, so I&#39;m very sure it&#39;s up and <br/>
running properly. I bet there was just a busy server or something.<br/>
If you spelled it exactly like you did here at this post, it should work. Try <br/>
again and let me know if you have any problems! <br/>

I&#39;m pretty quiet on the list, but just want you to know that I&#39;m thinking of you! (My mother just went through a direct hit from Frances.)  I hope your family is safe! <br/>
Take Care,  Tess<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720941999">Ren, you are also on my mind as well as everyone in your area. We&#39;ve <br/>
been through many hurricanes and during the last big one, we said <br/>
we&#39;d leave the next time....big meaning large cat 3 or worse. <br/>
Flooding is so nasty and it creeps in just when you think the worst <br/>
is over. I can only hope you and your family are in a safe place. <br/>
