<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128019556">What has the &quot;mom-directed&quot; learning looked like up until now? (don&#39;t answer---just think about it)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s been all about keeping her at grade level---or it&#39;s equivalent due to her limitations, then of COURSE she seems behind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about seeing her Where She Is Now. She may *always* be mentally five years old. That&#39;s just fine. She will always be *with* you, so she really will never have to worry about what time it is or when Easter is or how long she has to wait to leave. She&#39;ll never need to be able to buy groceries alone---you&#39;ll always be by her side and helping. She&#39;ll never need to know to add two more place settings---just HAND her two more. Forget the reading. Buy books on tape: that way you can *all* enjoy them together!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She should never be put in the position to usher if she cannot DO it. That should be true for EVERYTHING. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let her do what she *can*. Help her do what she struggles with. And DO everything else *for* her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re setting goals way too high for her (worrying about what other children her age can/cannot do). She CAN&#39;T do things most other children her age can do. Quit comparing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bet you&#39;ll see her doing *more* as soon as you stop worrying. Not *lots* more, because a lot is probably out of her ability range. But *more* is certainly a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just accept that you will always have a five year old living with you. A five year old who cannot deal with money or time or ushering. It&#39;s OK.<br/>
