<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281748292">Please Septemeber please oh please.<br/>
We&#39;re planning to move home to England at the end of Sept and I&#39;ll never make <br/>
it back to the US :-(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What a move--way exciting!  You&#39;ll know it&#39;s really happening when that semi <br/>
parks those big ol&#39; shipping containers in your street....Good Luck!<br/>
<br/>
Can the conference taped--dvd, video, or CD/cassette if it&#39;s not already <br/>
offered?<br/>
Better yet, I lobby for a live feed real time internet video conference/hook <br/>
up with write in interaction from around the world!  Then everyone interested <br/>
could attend!<br/>
<br/>
