<div id="ygrps-yiv-560778737">&lt;&lt;Thanks everyone for sharing. I can see I really need to talk to some<br/>
breeders.<br/>
 You are right...we got him at a pet shop. we were told they were no<br/>
different than breeders just less expensive.hmmmm!  I can see that we<br/>
will want to pay for quality.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good breeders, those who breed for the love of the species, do so for<br/>
temperament foremost.  I&#39;ve heard a lot of stories where someone got a<br/>
real gem at the local pet store but it&#39;s a chancier endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do any breeders ship? and is it an arm and a leg? what price might we<br/>
be talking for two rats? I don&#39;t know the different breeds so I can&#39;t say<br/>
I am particular. I go more for the personality......I guess except when I<br/>
go to the pet store huh? LOL!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most good breeders do not ship, it&#39;s hard on the ratties and it&#39;s WAY<br/>
expensive if they do.  If you do some research you&#39;re sure to find a<br/>
rattery near you.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;breeds&quot; it&#39;s really more a matter of color, hair type and<br/>
ears.  They are basically the same except that the breeders have helped<br/>
to single out the ones with good temperament.  The differences are<br/>
genetic mutations and if they are not responsibly bred it can mean<br/>
producing poor little ratties with severe health problems.<br/>
<br/>
There are curly haired rats called &quot;rex&quot;, if you double the genetic trait<br/>
you get a &quot;hairless&quot; rat.  There are tailless rats but breeders don&#39;t<br/>
recommend letting the females breed since the mutation can also mean a<br/>
lack of the muscles needed to give birth.  We have decided that we want<br/>
&quot;dumbos&quot; the next time, their ears are located a bit farther down the<br/>
sides of their heads.  This gives them a very cute appearance and doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to affect them adversely health wise.<br/>
