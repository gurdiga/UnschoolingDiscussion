<div id="ygrps-yiv-577925412">Someone on my regional list brought this link saying it might be of  <br/>
interest.   It&#39;s about researchers who showed members of an Amazon  <br/>
tribe (wait... they &quot;tested them&quot; with) pictures of shapes and asked  <br/>
them which was was &#39;ugly&#39; (meaning different, and they could&#39;ve said  <br/>
different), and showed them something else that mapped an area, with  <br/>
shapes, and asked a question about which was different.  So by that  <br/>
test they&#39;re claiming the natives &quot;know geometry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My response is below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s interesting, and says more about the researchers than about  <br/>
the native tribe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What they did had to do with language and mapping, with  <br/>
correspondence.  Yet because there were shapes involved they wanted  <br/>
to call it geometry.<br/>
<br/>
I would have been more impressed if they had themselves figured out  <br/>
in the tribe&#39;s language and culture how they use relationships and  <br/>
angles.<br/>
<br/>
If the study helps unschoolers and the promotion of natural learning  <br/>
that&#39;s great, and it&#39;s interesting, but it&#39;s not a very good study as  <br/>
math goes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing that.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here wants more ideas about mathematical concepts in  <br/>
natural ways, or if you have more things to add when you&#39;ve looked,  <br/>
