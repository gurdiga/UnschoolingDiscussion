I think  it is important for all who object to the public school or private <br/>
school  <br/>
education, however, to strive for unity.  Not in beliefs but in  purpose.  <br/>
Without the great numbers of homeschoolers and the  political watchdog of <br/>
Homeschool Legal Defense, I believe that our liberty  to be able to provide <br/>
the kind of <br/>
education that we want for our children  would be in jeopardy.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s NO mystery why homeschooling has the stigmas of far-right, submissive,  <br/>
unsociable creationists. It&#39;s BECAUSE of the high profile of H$LDA and its  <br/>
followers.<br/>
 <br/>
These people DO keep their children sequestered from the mainstream----on  <br/>
purpose! And are happy to be quoted in similar articles whenever possible. They  <br/>
are recreating their own version of school at home----and beating the  <br/>
schools at their own game! They revel in testing and proudly show off high  test <br/>
scores. The mainstream reads about their lack of socialization every  few weeks <br/>
in the paper, sees tv specials about them sitting around the kitchen  table, <br/>
and watches the news of these people killing their children. <br/>
 <br/>
We are ALL painted with the same brush if we align ourselves with them. The  <br/>
mainstream is already scared and spooked by them. Their views on evolution and <br/>
 Halloween and Harry Potter become OUR views. We and our unschooling become  <br/>
targets for ridicule and more laws restricting our liberties. Our children are <br/>
 seen as oppressed and lacking in social skills. People post here every few  <br/>
months about the socialization question BECAUSE of them!<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s extremely important for us to distance ourselves from these  <br/>
people as much as possible. They are endangering our legal rights to unschool  <br/>
with all their pushing of accountability and testing. They don&#39;t want us  <br/>
representing them any more than we want them representing us----and  their numbers <br/>
are larger----and they&#39;re louder. <br/>
 <br/>
Unity will only send us further into their black hole.<br/>

  AMEN!!   <br/>
  Harks back to 60s and 70s  when so many groups wanted to hide their own beliefs and needs in the guise of &quot;unity&quot;.    Just meant that they swapped one oppressor for another. <br/>
<br/>
  These HSLDA  folk are NOT our friends or protectors and they do NOT   believe in freedom for anyone.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am sorry that Christian people made you feel so unloved and rejected.  That <br/>
is very unfortunate because whether we agree with someone or not that is no <br/>
reason to reject them as a person.  Often Christians forget that.  <br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
As for the HSLDA, I was recently introduced to them and I speak from my own <br/>
experience.  When I thought that I might need an attorney to fight for my <br/>
rights  to homeschool, they were ready to help and no one questioned me about my <br/>
faith.  It didn&#39;t come up in the discussion at all.<br/>
<br/>
You ask me to ask myself questions like am I an unschooler before I encourage <br/>
unity.  Forgive me, but I don&#39;t understand why.  I am learning to unschool my <br/>
children.  But what has that to do with the fact that whether I homeschool or <br/>
unschool, I face opposition to doing things differently from the status quo.  <br/>
If I don&#39;t have my children in school, I am looked at as &quot;different&quot; and <br/>
therefore &quot;suspect&quot; and so are you.  So there is our common ground.  With mutual <br/>
respect for each other&#39;s rights to be different and who we are we can stand <br/>
united when our rights are challenged by those who want us to enroll our children <br/>
in school.<br/>

But,  anyway, people here go to CHEA&#39;s convention because it is so big - <br/>
of the  hundreds of speakers, people can avoid the extremists and often <br/>
there are  those who are offering great information mixed up with the <br/>
others. They  even have &quot;Christian unschooling&quot; talks - it isn&#39;t all <br/>
Abeka and so  on.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
But if they have 8,000 people show up (Christian or NOT), then they can  say, <br/>
&quot;See? Our numbers are HUGE!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It makes it *look* as if &quot;they&quot; outnumber the rest of us! True or  not---it&#39;s <br/>
the *appearance* of large religious homeschooling base.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right.<br/>
<br/>
AND - even those who are Christian are very very often not in agreement <br/>
with HSLDA&#39;s political stances (or theology).<br/>
<br/>
Also - many of the people who join HSLDA do not agree with either their <br/>
theology or politics, but think they are buying legal insurance or <br/>
supporting provision of legal help to other homeschoolers who need it.<br/>
<br/>
Many people who are not at ALL the kind of uber-Christians who give <br/>
homeschooling a bad name do join HSLDA. Often that is because their <br/>
local or state group IS headed up by people who support HSLDA and they <br/>
make membership mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
I really honestly think that these extremists are a small percentage of <br/>
the total homeschooling population. They&#39;re loud and demanding and <br/>
pushy and vocal and agitators and they garner &#39;followers&#39; who do their <br/>
bidding without really thinking things through for themselves and THAT, <br/>
to me, is the real problem.<br/>
<br/>
I think those types exist on the other end of the homeschooling <br/>
spectrum, too, though. And they gather followers, too, who stop <br/>
thinking for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
We all have to be vigilant that we check out facts for ourselves and <br/>
don&#39;t just repeat stuff we&#39;ve heard from others.<br/>
