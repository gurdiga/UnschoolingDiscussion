<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108833029">I&#39;ve got the B-Hag article for anyone interested in reading it. Just <br/>
send me an email (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jbogart@...">jbogart@...</a>) and I&#39;ll attach it as a <br/>
word doc.<br/>
<br/>
Footnotes to article: Interestingly, my daughter has moved on <br/>
from her Jane Austen plans. She and her brother did attend a <br/>
Vintage Dance ball in full costume and performed all the dances <br/>
beautifully. The co-op we go to even hired a vintage dance <br/>
teacher and a swing dance teacher based on my kids promotion <br/>
of the dances.<br/>
<br/>
But she is now interested in learning foreign languages, <br/>
studying psychology and reading lots of classic literature. So <br/>
she&#39;s moved on from dance, but still shows bigtime enthusiasm <br/>
for what drives her. She continues to act in Shakespeare plays.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s interest in computers has continued unabated and he&#39;s <br/>
figured out how to spend two-to-three periods a day with the <br/>
computer teacher at the local high school. He&#39;s also completed <br/>
two very primitive computer games using Visual Basic (which he <br/>
taught himself).<br/>
<br/>
The rat lover of the family is the one wanting to be an animal <br/>
trainer, so you can see that that interest continues to drive him <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought you&#39;d enjoy an update to go with the article if you <br/>
end up reading it.<br/>

P.S. For women who want to discuss B-Hags with other women, <br/>
I have a website www.trapdoorsociety.com where we share our <br/>
own learning adventures and B-Hags. (We also have &quot;l-hags&quot; for <br/>
those littler more manaeable sized goals).</div>
