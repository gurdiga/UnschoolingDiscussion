<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150564505">-=-my son just turned 14. He is now eligible to get a job, a <br/>
driving learner&#39;s permit etc. I feel like the whole world is<br/>
opening up to him and I am secretly eager for him to dive in-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could compose a letter to send to a business or two this summer, <br/>
proposing that after school starts maybe your son could have a part-time job as <br/>
part of his homeschooling (as a &quot;co-op&quot; or whatever else forays into <br/>
real-world jobs are called in school parlance in your area).  Being homeschooled, his <br/>
schedule could be really flexible, and depending what your state child labor <br/>
laws say, you could declare a school-year schedule that makes those days days <br/>
off, if the co-op plan wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
But in Kirby&#39;s case he was offered the job because when he was 12 and 13 he <br/>
hung out there and was helpful.  He&#39;d volunteer to help clean up, or fold <br/>
flyers, or move furniture, and he ended up organizing the Pokemon tournaments <br/>
because he had a knack for remembering all the rules and being able to explain them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your son could hang out at the bookstore and offer to file or dust or <br/>
clean the storage room or I don&#39;t know what.<br/>
