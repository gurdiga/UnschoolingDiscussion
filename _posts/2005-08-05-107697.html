<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039031389">Well I think I have discovered one reason why Alfie Kohn is invested in<br/>
school education:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Each time I visit such a classroom, where the teacher is more<br/>
interested in creating a democratic community than in maintaining her<br/>
position of authority, I&#39;m convinced all over again that moving away from<br/>
consequences and rewards isn&#39;t just realistic -- it&#39;s the best way to help<br/>
kids grow into good learners and good people. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The above paragraph is the conclusion his article �Discipline is the Problem<br/>
not the Solution� at his website.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Evidently he believes that children need help to grow into �good learners�.<br/>
<br/>
This is part of the old paradigm of adults taking credit for creating and<br/>
developing what Unschoolers consider the natural faculty and capacity<br/>
inherent in human beings � the driven ability to learn constantly. If this<br/>
is one of his core beliefs, Unschooling would look rather unappealing to<br/>
him, neglectful of this important educational task.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well if schools could do that, they&#39;d be taking a giant step in a good <br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s starting with the assumption that there is school and school is good, <br/>
isn&#39;t he?   But school can be better?   It would be better if schools could <br/>
encourage learning rather than extinguish all desire.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t kill you, they didn&#39;t give you life (in the creating life <br/>
from nothingness way) but if they COULD have killed you and didn&#39;t, they kinda <br/>
sorta gave your life back.<br/>
<br/>
School can kill what children need to grow into good learners.<br/>

<br/>
Someday maybe he&#39;ll find out that it&#39;s the total lack of any possibility of <br/>
the death of good lifetime learning!<br/>
