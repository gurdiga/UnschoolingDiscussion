        -- Views from the world of learning in Japan --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[Second Section of 6 May 2000 Edition]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re still with us here, thanks for sticking around!<br/>
<br/>
We continue on to the second feature of our KnoK NEWS double report this <br/>
time: a wrap-up of our Q & A on homeschooling in Japan by Tomiko Kugai, a <br/>
respected Japanese homelearning parent and advocate.<br/>
<br/>
This Q & A has its roots in a Japanese-language listing that Ms. Kugai <br/>
compiled in 1997 to help introduce the homelearning environment to the <br/>
slowly but steadily rising number of Japanese families seeking <br/>
alternatives to school. With Ms. Kugai&#39;s cooperation, KnoK NEWS has <br/>
recently translated, expanded and updated that original Japanese Q & A <br/>
list into English. We share the latter part of that listing with you now.<br/>
<br/>
Kugai, along with her partner, Mr. Junichi Ono, and their 14-year-old <br/>
daughter, Momo, have been homelearners for more than six years. Kugai <br/>
also heads a support group called &quot;Home Schooling Network - Himeji&quot; in <br/>
the city of Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, western Japan. (The group&#39;s <br/>
Japanese homepage is at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2h.biglobe.ne.jp/~hsn-hime/">http://www2h.biglobe.ne.jp/~hsn-hime/</a> )<br/>
<br/>
Kugai&#39;s family and homelearning activities have been reported on Japanese <br/>
TV, as well as in Japanese newspaper and magazine articles. The Kyoto <br/>
Shimbun, a major metro daily newspaper in the Japanese city of Kyoto, <br/>
just last month carried a few articles on Kugai and other regional <br/>
homelearning activities; the stories came across as supportive of <br/>
home-based learning in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
You may remember that in Part 1 of our Q & A listing, sent out about a <br/>
month ago, we introduced some of the basic questions being asked by <br/>
Japanese families about homelearning. We also touched upon some of the <br/>
general legal issues concerning home education (i.e., It is *not* against <br/>
the law for children to learn at home in Japan).<br/>
<br/>
Part 2 of our Q & A listing by Tomiko Kugai covers topics that are more <br/>
specific to Japan, such as *fu-toko* (avoiding school), and the <br/>
educational challenges young homelearners in Japan may face as they get <br/>
older.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned last time, we hope to take a deeper, more comprehensive look <br/>
in the future at legal and other issues as they relate to homelearning in <br/>
Japan. For now, however, we offer this Q & A overview in the spirit of <br/>
honest, open information-exchange and networking.<br/>
<br/>
                           *   *   *   *<br/>
<br/>
          *  Q & A ON HOMESCHOOLING IN JAPAN -- Part 2  *<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q-12: EXACTLY HOW DO FAMILIES IN JAPAN GET STARTED IN HOMESCHOOLING? WHAT <br/>
KIND OF STEPS DO THEY HAVE TO TAKE?<br/>
<br/>
A-12: In many cases in Japan, families start out homeschooling through <br/>
*fu-toko* (school avoidance) on the part of their child: Parents think <br/>
their child has a problem, so they go through counseling and prepare to <br/>
send the child back to school through so-called corrective facilities <br/>
[kyosei shisetsu], such as an &quot;adjustment guidance room&quot; [*teki-o shido <br/>
kyo-shitsu*] at school, a municipal &quot;child consultation center&quot; [jido <br/>
sodan-jo] or a &quot;free school&quot; program.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there are those exceedingly few parents in Japan who <br/>
are finding a problem with the methods of school itself, and they go on <br/>
to choose learning at home as a way to raise their children. In such a <br/>
case, the homeschooling child&#39;s name will continue to be listed on the <br/>
school register in Japan, so there would be no need to individually <br/>
notify the local board of education. Once parents have notified officials <br/>
at the school of their child&#39;s desire to learn at home, that is generally <br/>
sufficient in many cases.   <br/>
<br/>
There is also a slowly rising number of households in Japan that are <br/>
choosing homeschooling from the very beginning. Here, too, there are no <br/>
fixed procedures in Japan for dealing with homeschooling, so many <br/>
homeschooling parents find it easier at this stage to go through the <br/>
formal motion of registering with the school, and then inform school <br/>
officials at that time of the child&#39;s intent to learn at home, instead of <br/>
at school.      <br/>
<br/>
Q-13: WHAT HAPPENS IF A FAMILY IN JAPAN INTENDING TO HOMESCHOOL RECEIVES <br/>
NO COOPERATION FROM EDUCATION/SCHOOL OFFICIALS? WHAT RECOURSE DOES THE <br/>
FAMILY HAVE?<br/>
<br/>
A-13: It used to be that a child in Japan who didn&#39;t show up for school <br/>
would not be moved up a grade or would not be allowed to graduate -- but <br/>
this was for *fu-toko*, not for homeschooling in particular. And even <br/>
then, such actions by a school against *fu-toko*, for the most part, are <br/>
rarely taken nowadays. There are the occasional cases of a school <br/>
principal -- usually one who possesses little understanding of the matter <br/>
-- making such threatening statements, but the Ministry of Education is <br/>
telling school officials these days to refrain from such actions. If a <br/>
homeschooling family finds itself facing such a situation, it can -- with <br/>
the backing of a support group, for example -- obtain the actual facts <br/>
from various areas in Japan and present that information to the school <br/>
principal during discussions. (Taking the case to a local board of <br/>
education in Japan usually proves futile, and unfortunately no other <br/>
official organization exists to mediate such matters between a family and <br/>
school.)<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether or not there are restrictions on graduation, it is <br/>
still possible for a child to proceed to a higher school level by taking <br/>
and passing tests sanctioned by the Education Ministry, such as those for <br/>
graduating from middle school [*Chu-gaku Kentei*] and entering university <br/>
[*Dai-gaku Kentei*].     <br/>
<br/>
Q-14: ARE THERE ANY COURT CASES IN JAPAN BEING HEARD AT PRESENT ON THE <br/>
SPECIFIC ISSUE OF HOMESCHOOLING?<br/>
<br/>
A-14:  There are none at present, as far as I know.<br/>
<br/>
Q-15: AUTHORITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES TEND TO CONFUSE HOMESCHOOLING WITH <br/>
&quot;CHILD NEGLECT&quot; OR &quot;CHILD ABUSE.&quot; IS THIS A PROBLEM IN JAPAN TOO?<br/>
<br/>
A-15: There is always the possibility of such confusion occurring. But <br/>
where homeschooling itself is concerned in Japan, the relevant <br/>
authorities for the most part don&#39;t make it a point to come to the home <br/>
and check on things. So there doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
Q-16: HOW MANY HOMESCHOOLING SUPPORT GROUPS ARE THERE THROUGHOUT JAPAN?<br/>
<br/>
A-16: There are about 10 independent support groups in Japan, like &quot;HSN <br/>
Himeji,&quot; that have no religious affiliation. Many families in Japan are <br/>
also registered with &quot;free schools&quot; such as Tokyo Shure that have <br/>
homeschooling support programs, and with overseas schools like Clonlara <br/>
in the United States. There are other Christian-affiliated support groups <br/>
in Japan too.   <br/>
<br/>
Q-17: WHAT IS A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A &quot;TYPICAL HOMESCHOOLER&quot; LIKE IN <br/>
JAPAN? ARE ALL HOMESCHOOLERS THE SAME?<br/>
<br/>
A-17: Homeschooling differs with every home. In our family, for instance, <br/>
homeschooling is centered around our child&#39;s interests. So, excluding <br/>
time for meals and household chores, our child herself decides how each <br/>
day is spent. She reads books, paints pictures, cooks, does workbooks, <br/>
watches TV -- it changes with her interests and moods. Once a week, she <br/>
goes to the library and checks out books. We as a family also participate <br/>
in our support group functions, do some shopping, go to the movies. So we <br/>
spend a lot of time outside as well.<br/>
<br/>
Q-18: WHAT IS THE OFFICIAL STANCE OF JAPAN&#39;S MINISTRY OF EDUCATION ON <br/>
HOMESCHOOLING? HOW DOES THAT STANCE AFFECT HOMESCHOOLERS&#39; DAILY LIVES?<br/>
<br/>
A-18: The Japanese government has issued no official opinion on <br/>
homeschooling one way or the other. The ministry did, in 1992, issue a <br/>
statement on *fu-toko* [school avoidance] to the effect that: &quot;As any <br/>
child is likely to turn to avoiding school at any time, children need not <br/>
be forced to return to school.&quot; This signaled the government&#39;s apparent <br/>
recognition that to continue pushing school avoiders to go back to school <br/>
could worsen an already serious problem. Following this statement by the <br/>
ministry, school officials nationwide have generally softened their <br/>
stance on children who avoid school.<br/>
<br/>
As for those who homeschool: Though there may be exceptions, the ministry <br/>
for the most part does not interfere in the daily lives of homeschooling <br/>
families at present, neither encouraging nor discouraging such activities.<br/>
<br/>
Q-19: WHAT HAS JAPANESE MEDIA COVERAGE OF HOMESCHOOLING BEEN LIKE?<br/>
<br/>
A-19: The Japanese mass media have been covering homeschooling in Japan <br/>
as an issue since around 1993. At first, many news stories focused on how <br/>
to remedy the rising numbers of &quot;school-avoiding children.&quot; But recently, <br/>
media coverage in Japan has been treating homeschooled children&#39;s own <br/>
personalities and self-determination more seriously; as such, media <br/>
stories these days are introducing homeschooling in Japan as a new <br/>
learning alternative to school.    <br/>
<br/>
Q-20: HOW DO THE RELATIVES, NEIGHBORS AND COMMUNITIES OF HOMESCHOOLING <br/>
FAMILIES IN JAPAN REACT TO HOME-BASED LEARNING?<br/>
<br/>
A-20: Among those people who are actually familiar with homeschooling <br/>
families or are aware of the educational growth of homeschooled children, <br/>
there seems to a broadening of understanding, though it is hard to say to <br/>
what extent. (This, of course, may also depend on the region in Japan. <br/>
There seems to be little interference in homeschooling matters in urban <br/>
areas, anyway.)  <br/>
<br/>
Q-21: DON&#39;T HOMESCHOOLED CHILDREN NEED A DIPLOMA OF SOME KIND TO GET INTO <br/>
UNIVERSITY? DO THEY STILL NEED TO TAKE JAPAN&#39;S INFAMOUS UNIVERSITY <br/>
ENTRANCE EXAMS?<br/>
<br/>
A-21: There are two ways to enter college or university in Japan: by <br/>
graduating from high school or by passing the Education <br/>
Ministry-sanctioned university entrance test (*Dai-gaku Kentei*). It is <br/>
not necessary to graduate from primary school, middle school or high <br/>
school to TAKE the *Dai-gaku Kentei*. It should be noted, however, that <br/>
passing this test would merely qualify a person to take university <br/>
entrance exams; a homeschooler wanting to enter a university would still <br/>
have to take the entrance exams of the university she/he wanted to get <br/>
into, just like other applicants.<br/>
<br/>
Q-22: ARE JAPANESE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACCEPTING HOMESCHOOLED <br/>
&quot;STUDENTS&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
A-22: If a homeschooler passes a college&#39;s or university&#39;s own entrance <br/>
exams, there would be no problem getting in. There is no special system <br/>
set up for homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Q-23: DO HOMESCHOOLERS IN JAPAN HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO GET <br/>
SATISFACTORY JOBS? CAN THEY SURVIVE IN THE COMPETITIVE JAPANESE JOB MARKET?<br/>
<br/>
A-23: We don&#39;t know much about this area yet, since the homeschooling <br/>
movement in Japan is rather young and the numbers of children being <br/>
raised through homeschooling are comparatively few in Japanese society. <br/>
Even so, it can be said with some certainty that lots of homeschooled <br/>
children in Japan are broadening their capabilities and that they have an <br/>
abundance of will to try things.<br/>
<br/>
Academic record is still regarded as important for fighting it out in the <br/>
Japanese job market. But just because somebody is a homeschooler doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean the roads to higher education are closed in Japan: Former &quot;school <br/>
avoiders&quot; go on to graduate from university and do well as adults in the <br/>
business world; many of them work in a variety of fields as newspaper <br/>
reporters, teachers and so on. And of course, there are many working <br/>
people who have never been to college.<br/>
<br/>
For homeschoolers, it is their own efforts and abilities that count most. <br/>
Many people who choose homeschooling tend to place a higher value on <br/>
whether or not they are playing the leading role in their own lives, or <br/>
whether or not they are truly happy, rather than on social success or <br/>
fighting to victory in competition.  <br/>
