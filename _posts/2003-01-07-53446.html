&lt;&lt; My dad ran on ahead to alert the rangers to get a rescue operation going.<br/>
 He wanted to help more, but they said he&#39;d done enough climbing that day.<br/>
 Later we heard that the man died in the helicopter on the way to the<br/>
 hospital. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is SO sad. I am always very in tune to the news when I hear of <br/>
mountain/rock climbing accidents since we love it so very much.<br/>
It rates just below mowing your lawn on a list of dangerous activities though.<br/>
We were shocked by the latest Mt. Hood story (same mountain Mark fell off) <br/>
about the climbers falling and then the rescue helicopter crashing. The <br/>
footage was surreal.<br/>
Those climbers fell very near to where Mark did, the helicopter crashed right <br/>
where part of his fall was. Freaky.<br/>
But it&#39;s an awesome activity...I miss the mountains.<br/>

complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

loved finding ways to climb up a short cliff when we were camping, but I<br/>
never liked being where a fall was potentially fatal.  My grandfather<br/>
climbed a lot in the alps before they left Germany in the 20&#39;s and then he<br/>
and my dad climbed in the Sierra.  My dad mis-judged a talus slope when he<br/>
was in his early 20&#39;s I think, on Banner or Ritter, I forget which.  He<br/>
almost made it to the edge, jumping from boulder to boulder, but  ended up<br/>
with his head between two boulders.  All that happened was he lost the outer<br/>
part of his ear.<br/>
