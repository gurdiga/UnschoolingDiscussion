When and  where is the next live and learn conference? Is it going to <br/>
be on the east  coast again? We live about an hour from Columbia SC, <br/>
and about 3 hours  from ATlanta, GA. I really think it would do both <br/>
my husband and me some  good to be around other people who have been <br/>
unschooling longer than we  have.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, Nisha, you blew it missing teh two in Columbia! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The next is in Pensacola----unless Ivan was too damaging. The next year is  <br/>
in St Louis. It&#39;ll be back on the east coast (DC area maybe?) in 2008<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m still in Columbia, though----and probably will remain here for the next  <br/>
eight to ten years! Ugh!<br/>
 <br/>
I had a bunch of unschoolers from the Greenville area here last week. And I  <br/>
went to Hendersonville, NC last weekend with a bunch of unschoolers (and <br/>
relaxed  homeschoolers). The NCUnschoolers have weekly (and sometimes  more!) <br/>
get-togethers----as do the GAUnschoolers, but not as  often. We&#39;ll be at LEAF <br/>
(_www.theleaf.com_ (http://www.theleaf.com) ) next weekend. And I think  we&#39;ll be <br/>
having a bunch of unschoolers here again in Nov or Dec----whole  families. <br/>
 <br/>
Where are you? Contact me off-list, and we&#39;ll see when we can get  together.<br/>

I just bought the 1st issue via Paypal and really enjoyed it.<br/>
Guess I&#39;ll have to sub to it and Learning Life magazine. Those along <br/>
with this list and periodic contact with Tuck should help me keep true <br/>
to ds&#39;s wish to unschool.<br/>
