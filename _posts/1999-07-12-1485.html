<div id="ygrps-yiv-405632079">Dear Kathie,<br/>
All kids are different. But , my two cents worth....<br/>
I have 8 and 10 year old daughters.<br/>
The 10 year old is just getting into the real-life dramas..like the<br/>
historical effects of war, hatred and the damage it can inflict over<br/>
decades and centuries, etc. Two years ago , she did not even want to read<br/>
the Narnia series because she found it &#39;mean, scarey, &quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think all children need time to find a comfort zone with the seedier to<br/>
the more horrific things in life. Maybe your daughter is trying to tell you<br/>
that it is not the right time for her to deal with this???  Give her a list<br/>
of other activities/field trips you might organize together and see if<br/>
there is something on the list that makes her come alive with interest. <br/>
<br/>
Save the very important lessons from the Holocaust until she is ready.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion, <br/>

&gt;I just joined this loop after hsing for a couple of years... my girls are 5, <br/>
&gt;7 and 1...  I have a question for anyone open to answer it...  In our <br/>
&gt;homeschooling support group one of our contributions to the group is to plan <br/>
&gt;an activity/field trip per semester.  I really want to plan one on the <br/>
&gt;Holocaust for a variety of reason... I&#39;m sensing indifference from my 7 year <br/>
&gt;old, at just the beginning of my research... this infuriates me... I&#39;m being <br/>
&gt;unrealisitic  (kick me.. I know!  :-) But this is important to me and I <br/>
&gt;believe she needs to know about this. Perhaps with further research it may <br/>
&gt;pique (sp?  right word even?) her interest...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thoughts...?  Comments?<br/>
