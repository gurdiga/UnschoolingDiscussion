<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866660614">I also live in a small town (in very Northern CA). The<br/>
local paper had an article about halloween and there<br/>
were quite a few comments from parents who said they<br/>
were not going to let their kids trick or treat<br/>
because they&#39;re afraid they might get anthrax<br/>
poisoning! I mean REALLY! Who is going to come up here<br/>
in the back of beyond and poison a bunch of little<br/>
kids? The fear and paranoia is getting just a tad<br/>
(sarcasm) out of hand in my opinion.<br/>
