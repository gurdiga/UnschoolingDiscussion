<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096662586">I have purchased several violins over e-bay.  Of course, it is buyer<br/>
beware.  The first thing you need to find out is whether she needs a<br/>
full-size or a 3/4 size.  (most 10 year olds need a 3/4 -- though it is<br/>
easier to get a pleasing sound out of the larger size.) On ebay, you&#39;ll<br/>
often find Glaesel (the German Glaesels are the best) or Knilling 3/4<br/>
sizes -- they aren&#39;t great, but they are dependable (and always<br/>
resellable) and should cost between $100 and $200.  (Don&#39;t buy the<br/>
Palatinos or Larks -- they look good, but the sound is awful).<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (now 11) has been playing since she was 2, and has bought<br/>
instruments at auctions which have turned out great -- if you go that<br/>
route, you have to assume that you&#39;ll need to take it to a violin shop<br/>
to get it adjusted into best playing condition.<br/>
<br/>
My other advice (for what it is worth, and which goes in the opposite<br/>
direction), is spend some extra money and let her truly pick out the one<br/>
she wants (and have it checked out before buying.)  (On 3/4 sizes,<br/>
you&#39;ll be reselling it when she needs a full-size later anyway, so<br/>
you&#39;ll basically get your money back, and it&#39;s a lot cheaper than<br/>
renting.)  People often make the mistake of saddling beginners with<br/>
inferior instruments because they are inexpensive, not recognizing that<br/>
for the beginner (especially given the technical hurdles of the violin<br/>
in particular), getting a good sound early is what hooks them -- the pro<br/>
or advanced amateur can get sound out of an inferior instrument, but the<br/>
beginner needs all the help she can get.<br/>
<br/>
(if you want, I&#39;ll e-mail you my book chapter on beginning music,<br/>
including our experience with violins, just let me know if you can<br/>
accept Word attachments -- don&#39;t want to clutter up the list.)<br/>

we got one for our 11 yo dd by asking everyone we knew. One friend&#39;s son <br/>
takes violin lessons and one of her other students outgrew hers, so we bought <br/>
it for $75.  <br/>

<br/>
Besides watching want ads, several of my friends around here have located <br/>
various musical instruments used by contacting school music teachers at <br/>
schools where they have band/orchestra programs.  Sometimes the schools are <br/>
actually selling their older instruments, but if not, I find that music <br/>
teachers usually know where to shop for bargains and best buys in your <br/>
particular area.  I have found many little dealers that operate out of their <br/>
homes that I would have never known about except through music teachers.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
