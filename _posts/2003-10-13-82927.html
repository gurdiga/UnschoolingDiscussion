(HOMESCHOOL-ABUSE/GONZALES, Pierce, Walters) (EVENING NEWS for<br/>
10/13/03<br/>
air)<br/>
(NATS - SCHOOL BUS ON COUNTRY ROAD) bus<br/>
The school bus never stopped at the secluded trailer on Hickory<br/>
Crossroads<br/>
here in rural North Carolina...because for five years Nissa and Kent<br/>
Warren<br/>
homeschooled their children. Then County workers got an anonymous tip:<br/>
better check on those kids.<br/>
(SOT/.TOM LOCK/JOHNSTON COUNTY D.A./T1/1 24 30) THIS IS ONE OF THOSE<br/>
CASES<br/>
THAT WILL ALWAYS HAUNT ME. (2433)<br/>
For weeks, the parents tried to keep social workers OUT...until the<br/>
day<br/>
detectives and District Attorney Tom Lock were called IN.<br/>
(SOT DA TOM LOCK /T1/approx 1 03 31) I WAS STUNNED AT THE SQUALOR<br/>
THAT I<br/>
SAW. // THERE WAS ROTTING FOOD // ANIMAL FECES ON THE FLOOR // (VG)<br/>
IS THIS<br/>
A LOCATION WHERE YOU COULD EXPECT SOMEBODY COULD BE LEARNING LESSONS<br/>
AND<br/>
GOING TO SCHOOL?// (LOCK) I CAN&#39;T IMAGINE ANYONE LIVING IN A<br/>
RESIDENCE LIKE<br/>
THIS.<br/>
A faded sign on the wall reads: &quot;SO THIS ISN&#39;T HOME SWEET HOME:<br/>
ADJUST.&quot;<br/>
(GFX) In the bedroom, fourteen-year-old Brandon had committed suicide<br/>
with a<br/>
rifle...after killing his brother Kyle and sister Marnie. (END<br/>
GFX) Their mother discovered the bodies.<br/>
(SOT/neighbor/f-1/151115) SHE STOPPED ME IN THE ROAD. SHE SAID MY<br/>
CHILDREN<br/>
ARE DEAD.<br/>
Nissa Warren told a detective she&#39;d &quot;rather God had them than Child<br/>
Protective Services.&quot;<br/>
(GFX) It turned out the Warrens had homeschooled before-- in Arizona--<br/>
where<br/>
they were convicted of child abuse. An investigator there wrote: &quot;The<br/>
children are tortured physically and emotionally.&quot; (END GFX) That&#39;s<br/>
information North Carolina school officials are not required to<br/>
collect.<br/>
(OC OUTSIDE NC STATEHOUSE ) SINCE IT BECAME LEGAL IN NORTH CAROLINA<br/>
IN 1985<br/>
THE NUMBER OF HOME SCHOOL STUDENTS HAS JUMPED, FROM JUST A FEW<br/>
HUNDRED TO<br/>
MORE THAN 50-THOUSAND BUT THERE&#39;S BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF<br/>
STATE<br/>
EMPLOYEES OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM-JUST THREE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE.<br/>
(SOT/MARCIA HERMAN-GIDDENS/NC CHILD ADVOCACY INSTITUTE/T4/44115) I<br/>
THINK<br/>
THERES SO LITTLE SUPERVISION THAT THEY REALLY ARE NOT PROTECTING<br/>
THOSE KIDS.<br/>
(4123)<br/>
Marcia Herman-Giddens is on the state task force that reviewed the<br/>
Warren<br/>
case. (GFX) The conclusion: home school laws &quot;allow persons who<br/>
maltreat<br/>
children to maintain social isolation in order for the abuse and<br/>
neglect to<br/>
remain undetected.&quot; (END GFX)<br/>
(SOT/MARCIA HERMAN-GIDDENS/NC CHILD ADVOCACY INSTITUTE/T4/42020) THEY<br/>
DELIBERATELY KEEP THEM OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE BECAUSE THE CHILDREN DO<br/>
HAVE<br/>
INJURIES THAT ARE VISIBLE AND THEY DON&#39;T WANT THEM TO BE SEEN.<br/>
(2030)<br/>
(SOT/HAL YOUNG/NORTH CAROLINIANS FOR HOME EDUCATION/T3/3 15 31) I<br/>
DON&#39;T SEE<br/>
A CONNECTION BASED ON ONE VERY TRAGIC UNFORTUNATE CASE. (1536)<br/>
Hal Young, an advocate for homeschool parents says most are loving<br/>
and doing<br/>
a very good job.<br/>
(SOT/HAL YOUNG/NORTH CAROLINIANS FOR HOME EDUCATION/T3/3 1536) I<br/>
DON&#39;T SEE A<br/>
CONNECTION THAT WOULD SAY THIS IS WHERE THE GOVT NEEDS TO STEP IN.<br/>
THIS IS<br/>
WHERE THE GOVT NEEDS TO COME TO YOUR HOME, COME INTO YOUR LIFE...<br/>
(NATS/f-1/152132 NISSA WARREN OUT OF COURTHOUSE DOOR) NISSA SWATS AT<br/>
REPORTER<br/>
The Warrens were acquitted of child abuse charges but spent 45 days<br/>
in jail<br/>
for failing to secure a firearm. Through their attorney declined they<br/>
requests for an interview.<br/>
(SOT/JONATHAN BREEDEN/ ATTORNEY FOR NISSA AND KENT WARREN T2/2 19 51)<br/>
ALL<br/>
THEY EVER ASKED WAS THAT THEY BE ABLE TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN IN THE<br/>
MANNER<br/>
IN WHICH THEY FELT WAS APPROPRIATE.<br/>
Tomorrow, how children nationwide have been put in danger, even<br/>
killed,<br/>
while homeschooling. In Smithfield, North Carolina, this is Vince<br/>
Gonzales<br/>
for Eye on America<br/>
