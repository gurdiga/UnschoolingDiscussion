<div id="ygrps-yiv-169994058">I&#39;m having a really hard time letting go right now.  My 4 yr. old ADHD<br/>
son is very bright, but some of his little friends who are in preschool<br/>
are already reading little words and my boy just isn&#39;t interested in<br/>
reading, writing, coloring, anything considered &quot; quiet activities&quot;. I<br/>
have this internal tug-of-war going on, going back and forth between<br/>
wanting to try and make him participate in these &quot;quiet&quot; activities, or<br/>
just letting him do his own thing.  We do read books before bed, and he<br/>
does enjoy that wind down period, but he&#39;d really rather be jumping on<br/>
the couch !  Am I just rushing things, feeling the pressure of societies<br/>
expectations,   or should I be trying to calm him down and get him<br/>
interested in these things?Thanks, Sus</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, you are rushing things. He&#39;s 4. My goodness when we were kid there<br/>
wasn&#39;t 4 year old K or preschool  or kindergymnastics.<br/>
<br/>
The old age of entrance to school was 7-8 and there were very good reasons<br/>
for choosing that age.  If you read the child development material almost<br/>
every theory has a major break/growth phase starting 7.  Our children begin<br/>
to think abstractly, they begin to be aware of others outside of themselves.<br/>
And of course the age is not tied directly to sheer time, as each child will<br/>
have his or her own personal time table.<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 children and I&#39;ve had young 4&#39;s and mature 4&#39;s.   I had one son who<br/>
only began to speak after he was 4.  I have two daughters that could have<br/>
argued before the Supreme Court by 4. Your son will sit down and do quiet<br/>
activities at some point.  He won&#39;t still be jumping on the couch when he&#39;s<br/>
a grandfather.  At least it&#39;s not likely.<br/>
<br/>
Let him be the 4 year old he is.<br/>

Funny how doubts hit us at all ages.  Some of my close hsing friends are <br/>
more structured than I am and their children are already doing some<br/>
early reading (6 1/2 yr olds).  My dd has pretty much taught herself<br/>
everything she knows about the alphabet and writing, but is not ready<br/>
for reading and is not interested yet in learning all the rules that go<br/>
with reading.  My dd is very bright, outgoing and a leader.  I have<br/>
no fear she will do this on her own in her own time.  Try not to compare,<br/>
I know its hard.  I have heard good things about Better Late than<br/>
Early by the Moores.  Have&#39;t read it myself but plan too. Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-112533800">&lt;&lt;worries about how kids spend their time&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really used to worry that the kids wouldn&#39;t &quot;turn out right&quot;.  Now I<br/>
don&#39;t.  Looking back, I realize that when I was worried I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot;<br/>
unschooling, although I thought I did.  I still wanted the kids to fit some<br/>
mold, some idea in MY head about what success looks like.  I was still into<br/>
controlling who they were and who I wanted them to be.  I didn&#39;t see them as<br/>
fully human, but rather some kid shaped larvae that would morph someday into<br/>
a full person.<br/>
<br/>
It took a while but I now see my kids as fully human with all the rights<br/>
that entails (including the right to make mistakes and to live in ways that<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t choose).  Does this mean that I am a hands-off parent?  Not at<br/>
all.  I work with the kids daily (and with myself and dh) on how to live<br/>
together lovingly, how to be respectful and supportive of each other.<br/>
<br/>
The way I was able to work through my doubts was to ask myself constantly<br/>
&quot;what would I want to happen if it were me, would I want someone to say that<br/>
to me, would I want someone to help me with that&quot;?  I started to see how I<br/>
treated the kids so much differently than I did adults.  I gave them very<br/>
little slack for mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Like the controller thing on another thread, I would have made the kid pay<br/>
for the controller....but when I got aggravated at the dog for barking all<br/>
night, rapped on the window too hard and put my hand through it, the last<br/>
thing I wanted was a lecture.  Dh simply laughed and we bought a new window.<br/>
I haven&#39;t put my hand through one since.....Apparently I learned my lesson<br/>
without anyone having to teach me one.  I now know kids do too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610379698">&lt;&lt;preparing them for adulthood&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t have any idea what their adulthood will be like.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I wanted to be a vet because I loved animals.  I hated<br/>
school because it was boring.  Everyone told me how hard it was to get into<br/>
vet school so I gave that idea up.  Then I just decided to float and go<br/>
about the business of hating school.  I graduated and worked at the 5 and<br/>
dime.  I was bored with that so I decided to go to college to have more time<br/>
to play with my friends.<br/>
<br/>
I found out that I loved college literature and became a Lit major.  Found<br/>
out that you can&#39;t easily make a living as a Lit major and changed to<br/>
psychology.  Enjoyed it.  Got a Master&#39;s and worked for a decade and came to<br/>
loathe it ( I figured when I wanted to scream &quot;Quit whining&quot; at my clients<br/>
it was time to hang it up) so I quit to stay home with my kids.  I<br/>
discovered that I liked karate, got a black belt and now teach some classes<br/>
of my own.  I discovered that I love hanging out with dairy goats.  I spend<br/>
massive amounts of time learning from books, on-line, chatting with friends<br/>
about how to raise them holistically.  Stuff that goes against everything<br/>
you learn in vet school.  My goal is to some day have my own dairy.<br/>
<br/>
If I am still (at 39) learning about myself and my changing interests, how<br/>
can I pretend to know what is best for my kids?  I am not living the life<br/>
that anyone thought I would (My mom has confessed that she thought I would<br/>
be in the Witness Protection program as an adult), including myself.  But I<br/>
am happy.  I want no more and no less for my kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>About a month ago, my 11 yo son was trying to kill a fly on the window with<br/>
his hand, and I guess he didn&#39;t know his own strength because his hand went<br/>
right through the window! It scared him more than anything. He happened to<br/>
be home alone at the time and called me on the cell phone crying after it<br/>
happened. I think he was very sorry and felt really bad that he broke the<br/>
window. I think he was afraid that dh or I would be mad at him and even make<br/>
him pay for the damages. Well, I responded very calmly and told him I knew<br/>
it was an accident. We never once mentioned him paying for a new window.<br/>
Luckily, dh is very handy and was able to take the sliding glass window out,<br/>
buy and new piece of glass and install it all himself. He did get a very<br/>
nasty cut on his finger, though. :-/ But my son helped him through the<br/>
project to show that he was truly sorry. I think my son learned his lesson<br/>
and will be very careful when killing flies on a window in the future!<br/>
