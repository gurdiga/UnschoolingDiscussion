<h4>The White&#39;s</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285747514">Okay, I need to put a new slant on the kid rant thread.  I agree that you<br/>
need to talk to a child who is at your house a lot about rules of the house<br/>
& explain to them how you expect them to behave.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is my husband&#39;s nieces.  We go on vacation with his family every<br/>
year for at least a week.  Usually my in-laws pick the nieces up & bring<br/>
them for the whole week although their Dad (my husband&#39;s brother) usually<br/>
only comes for a day or so.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that these girls, especially the oldest one, are very sneaky,<br/>
dishonest and manipulative.  The oldest&#39;s favorite thing in the world is<br/>
getting someone else in trouble or making someone else cry.  She has NEVER<br/>
been disciplined at all, there has NEVER been any consistancy in her life.<br/>
The few times Grandma and Grandpa came close to providing it they backed off<br/>
because &quot;poor little thing has it so hard since the parents are divorced and<br/>
Mom is on Prozac&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My son is the same age (7) as they are (8 and 7).  He has wised up<br/>
considerably and spends way too much time trying to &quot;change&quot; them.  I don&#39;t<br/>
worry too much about him because he doesn&#39;t like to be around them anymore.<br/>
BUT, my daughter (3)loves to go off into a room alone with them, especially<br/>
the older one.  She picks up way too much bad stuff, just in a week.  It<br/>
just makes me very nervous.  The older one acts inappropriately also, doing<br/>
things like talking about genitalia and sex.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I tell our kids in front of the girls & in front of<br/>
Grandma/Grandpa and their Dad that the girls are not our kids, we can&#39;t<br/>
control their behavior, but we can control our own kids&#39; behavior & they<br/>
will not act that way.  We also make a point to do lots of just our family<br/>
stuff away from the others, but we can&#39;t do too much of that as it is a<br/>
large family vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Since we are not in my home, I don&#39;t feel like I can make the house rules.<br/>
I can only make the rules for my children & not allow them to play with the<br/>
others if the rules are not followed.  Sometimes this is so-so effective<br/>
since the nieces have learned that we will not include them or play with<br/>
them if they act ugly.  I told the older one last year when she began crying<br/>
because my son would not play with her that I was not surprised and she<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be either.  I asked her if she treated her friends at school the<br/>
way she treats my children.  When she said no I asked her did she understand<br/>
now why my son didn&#39;t like her?  Would her friends at school like her if she<br/>
treated them the same?  I think she got it.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  Vacation time is quickly approaching.  Unfortunately I am<br/>
always the only Mother there, if you don&#39;t count Grandma.  I welcome any<br/>
ideas to keep my children safe and happy and to keep my relationship with my<br/>
in-laws in tact (it&#39;s a good one).  They have a very blind-side with these<br/>
girls & I know talking to them won&#39;t help.  As the only Mom there I&#39;m<br/>
expected to do a lot for the nieces that I would not elect to do otherwise.<br/>
When I am alone with them, away from the rest of the family, they do<br/>
understand what my rules are and they follow them pretty well.  It&#39;s when we<br/>
are all together that the problems start happening because the nieces know<br/>
they can get away with it.  HELP!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Cindy</div>
