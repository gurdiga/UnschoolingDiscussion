<div id="ygrps-yiv-888049213">I&#39;m behind on digests but for the record my 10 YO daughter also does not want to take showers/baths. She does not smell sweaty yet but I can tell and her hair gets real oily, which she doesn&#39;t like. But she doesn&#39;t mind it enough to wash it. It&#39;s very long and hard to brush out which makes it harder. But she won&#39;t hear of cutting it and won&#39;t let me help.... :~)<br/>
She says what she doesn&#39;t like about showering is that she might miss something fun. What works for us is if I sit in there when she starts and read to her. I don&#39;t have to read to her for the whole shower. Maybe a book on tape would help for the boys who don&#39;t want mom there. <br/>

****************************************<br/>
One thing that works with the oily hair (I have fine lightish blonde hair <br/>
that looks greasey the day after I wash it) is to sprinkle powder on a brush, <br/>
then brush normally. It doesn&#39;t look freshly washed, but doesn&#39;t look oily. And <br/>
if the powder is scented, it makes it smell good too.<br/>
