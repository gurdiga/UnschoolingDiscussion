<div id="ygrps-yiv-218004062">I&#39;m over in the Tri-Cities.  My 10yod is also in Girl Scouts.  Although I<br/>
have reservations about some parts of the program, my dds are currently<br/>
enjoying it.  Our troop is mulit-age and has 4 leaders, all of whom<br/>
homeschool (the leaders that is, half of the kids in the troop go to<br/>
school.)<br/>
<br/>
My brother lives in Woodinville.  My mom is living in an apartment there<br/>
right now, but is getting ready to move back to Gig Harbor.<br/>
