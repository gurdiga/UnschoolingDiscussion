<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407785983">Well...to back up a bit...We&#39;re currently involved with social services thanks to a dispute with a neighbor who seems to think her chidlren are perfect and mine aren&#39;t, and that&#39;s I&#39;m an awful parent. My three year old is an escape artist, who was aided by a broken lock on the door this past summer to be able to slip outside un-noticed. She brought him back into our yard a couple times. Once he snuck out behind Sarah as she went to a friend&#39;s house and got all the way down the street before she realized he was following her and brought him home. Neighbor saw this. <br/>
 <br/>
We hadn&#39;t fixed the door lock becuase we&#39;re in military housing. We&#39;d had a work order in for months asking to have it fixed. It wasn&#39;t really a problem until summer when we could no longer keep the big doors shut/locked. We didn&#39;t have airconditioning units at that point in the summer. <br/>
 <br/>
When you live in military housing they can be pretty awful if you fix something without their permission, let alone change something at the same time (ie: move the locks higher on the doors). So we were waiting for THEM to come do it. We can&#39;t afford to replace two doors.<br/>
 <br/>
Well, when the complaint was made and the investigator came, we decided we&#39;ll eat the cost of the doors and we moved the locks higher and fixed the broken one. <br/>
 <br/>
Turns out though that other things became an issue, among them the fact that a notedly reputable doctor in town has an issue with me (I had spanked one of my children while in her office and she decided I had &quot;very poor&quot; interaction with my children..this being a doctor who didn&#39;t know us, had never seen us, and didn&#39;t pay a darn bit of attention to my sick child who nearly ended up in the hospital because she was more focused on threatening ME than with my sick child). ANYWAY...our homeschooling has also become an issue. <br/>
 <br/>
The school said she&#39;s behind in grade level and they are concerned as to if we are really doing anything here at home. The school reported me to DSS when Sarah was in kindergarten because we wanted her off the ADHD medications because they were harming her, and because we didn&#39;t want her tested for Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, Oppositional-Defiance Disorder, or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (symptoms of which only manifested while on the medications). <br/>
 <br/>
I have just received a letter from my lawyer basically saying I&#39;m screwed if I don&#39;t follow along with DSS and accept a parent-aid into the home and that I need to, at least while involved with DSS, do as much academic work as I can to prove that she&#39;s grade level, etc. because if they take me to court he doubts unschooling will hold up and she could be forced back into government school. <br/>
 <br/>
SIGH....any advice? Now instead of just my husband saying we have to do more academics, my lawyer and DSS are saying it....&quot;grade level&quot; is BS and we all know it..but still..it&#39;s their rules vs. my principles. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745173239">&lt;&lt;Any advice?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So throw some fun stuff out in front of your kids.  Join in with them and<br/>
have a ball.  Do crafts, go to museums, bake cookies, etc..  At the end of<br/>
each day, write it up in education-ese.<br/>
<br/>
Also would suggest an alarm for the doors, the kind they use in homes for<br/>
the elderly or impaired, that let you know if someone has &quot;left the<br/>
building&quot;.<br/>

I think having your children taken from you would be way, WAY worse on your <br/>
kids than pushing some academics for a while.  Get one of those &quot;Comprehensive <br/>
Curriculum&quot; workbooks from Sam&#39;s for her grade level and do a page or two in <br/>
each section once a week.  Do some of them for her if it&#39;s too much.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your lawyer doesn&#39;t know much about MA case law concerning homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried MHLA (Mass Home Learning Association http://www.mhla.org)?<br/>
<br/>
They have a email list: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/masshomelearningassoc/<br/>
<br/>
In MA we aren&#39;t required to keep them at grade level and there is wording in<br/>
Charles that allows for unschooling. I wouldn&#39;t take a stand to prove a<br/>
point, but I&#39;d find out exactly what the can and can&#39;t ask to see. DSS<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be involved in their education, only in neglect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Doctors and teachers (and certain others) in MA are required by law to<br/>
report anything that suggests child abuse. I don&#39;t know exactly what the<br/>
penalties are but they aren&#39;t taking the law lightly.<br/>
