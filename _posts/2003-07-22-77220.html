<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727142988">Our street may not be near as busy as yours as we live in somewhat of a <br/>
country setting but I do understand how stressful speeding cars can be esp with <br/>
little ones. I finally went out and bought one of those green people with the <br/>
orange flag that says &quot;Slow Children.&quot; I even stood at the end of my dw letting <br/>
people know I was there and some I even pointed at and said please slow down. <br/>
They prob. only herd me say PL..... or maybe some please but they knew what I <br/>
was doing. The ones with children have slowed down.<br/>
<br/>
 One teen across the street actually sped up but a week later she bounced <br/>
herself off a couple guardrails on the highway. She is fine and has a new car she <br/>
was on the cell phone..huh? Its a law too.<br/>
I also when coming down our road I make a point not to go over 35 esp if I <br/>
have a speeder behind me. They can learn from my example...I hope. Laura D<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We live on a very busy street (especially in the summer with all of <br/>
the tourists) in Gloucester MA. I think about that street all the time. We have <br/>
a great big back yard but the only way to get to our cars is to go outside the <br/>
front way, right next to all of those cars racing down the road. Now, when I <br/>
say I think about this often, I mean it!<br/>
