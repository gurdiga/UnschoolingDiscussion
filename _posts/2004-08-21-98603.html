That&#39;s what I meant.  The student dentist hyped me on<br/>
xylitol *however* in gums that contained xylitol,<br/>
sorbitol was also an ingredient.  At least what I<br/>
found in Fred Myers.  And, I came to the conclusion<br/>
that it was the sorbitol that I had a reaction to. <br/>
Does anyone know if there is a gum that has xylitol<br/>
but no sorbitol?  Also, I still believe it is the act<br/>
of chewing and not the ingredient xylitol alone that<br/>
helps with the bacteria.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, the Dr. Greene link was interesting as it linked<br/>
xylitol with decreasing ear infections. (My 1 year old<br/>
has one in each ear right now *sigh*)<br/>
