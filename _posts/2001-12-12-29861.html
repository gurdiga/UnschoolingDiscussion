<div id="ygrps-yiv-39284477">I have 3 kids and a husband who want a dog...We are talking about <br/>
surprising them with a puppy for Easter or maybe for their summer <br/>
birthdays, when the weather will be nicer and they&#39;ll be able to play <br/>
around with him outside a lot.  Dh thinks a golden lab would be nice.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago we had a dog and although we loved him, he was untrainable. <br/>
 Some lady found him and put a free ad in the paper.  He had either <br/>
been abandoned or possibly even born wild.  Whatever the case was, he <br/>
never really was a good housedog.  I couldn&#39;t rely on him to go <br/>
outside to go to the bathroom, couldn&#39;t keep him in the yard without <br/>
chaining him up (because he would jump the fence or squeeze out of the <br/>
smallest spaces, even under the botom of the fence.  Once he even <br/>
opened the gate.  He did damage in neighbors&#39; yards.  In the house, he <br/>
would jump up on the table and eat the food (once he took an entire <br/>
meatloaf off of the table...)<br/>
<br/>
The point of the story is that I want to know ahead of time what the <br/>
plan is for training this puppy.  I want a puppy who can stay inside, <br/>
who won&#39;t jump on the table or counters and steal food, won&#39;t knock <br/>
over the garbage cans, and won&#39;t go to the bathroom in the house.  I <br/>
want a puppy who the kids can take out in the yard to play with and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831689164">Do you have a large yard?  Labs like lots of exercise and generally stay<br/>
puppyish until they are between a year and 18 months old.<br/>
<br/>
When we had the kennel and showed dogs we found that generally speaking that<br/>
females were easier to housebreak and were less inclined to have wanderlust.<br/>
<br/>
Also, regardless of gender, neuter them as close to 6 months as your vet<br/>
recommends for you individual dog.  That also usually has a calming effect<br/>
on male dogs (cuts down the urge to &quot;travel&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
You also might want to consider an older dog that is already housebroke.<br/>
Most breeds have a rescue group that could help you in that area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-650084860">I agree with everything Lynda said. You may want to get a good book on the<br/>
subject and read first about how you want to handle your new puppy. Or find<br/>
a trainer and audit some classes if they&#39;ll let you. Don&#39;t rely just on what<br/>
you&#39;ve done before. Any book or source that tells you to punish the puppy,<br/>
throw away (don&#39;t donate it, we don&#39;t want those things back in<br/>
circulation!) Karen Pryor&#39;s book &quot;Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog,&quot; while older, is one<br/>
of the best theory books around. It&#39;s not a practical training manual, but<br/>
it does outline behavioral conditioning principles very well. Can be used<br/>
with husbands and children too! :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are good areas on the web and in books on selecting a puppy.<br/>
Read them and go with a hard heart and a clear eye. What I mean is that it&#39;s<br/>
easy to pick the first one who comes bounding up to you and chews on your<br/>
shoe. Or, you get the shy, coughing runt with red eyes because you feel<br/>
sorry for her. Don&#39;t be afraid to look at more than one litter. If possible,<br/>
don&#39;t take the kids with you (it&#39;s a surprise, so probably not, right?)<br/>
because it&#39;s very hard to walk away when your kids have that look! Put the<br/>
puppy through the puppy personality tests found in books or websites (can be<br/>
used with older dogs too) and spend time with them. And I second the mention<br/>
of adopting an older dog. Personality is set, they&#39;re either housebroken or<br/>
not, and they&#39;re so grateful! (Isn&#39;t that what Benjamin Franklin said about<br/>
older women?)<br/>
