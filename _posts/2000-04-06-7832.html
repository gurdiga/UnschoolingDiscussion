<div id="ygrps-yiv-105260628">yay Kim! I love breastfeeding, did so easily and my children all nursed till<br/>
at least two years of age and I am heartily sick of breastfeeding fanatics<br/>
making other women who have valid and personal reasons for the choices they<br/>
make, feel inferior, ignorant and/or lazy!!<br/>
What a luxury it is to be able to choose how to nourish our children when<br/>
millions of women throughout the world are watching helpless as their<br/>
beloved children starve to death! God, the pettiness of this flaming<br/>
&quot;discussion&quot; is mind-boggling! May I respectfully suggest that some of these<br/>
breastfeeding zealots spend their time and energy (they obviously have<br/>
plenty of both) to campaign to force the US Govt to label all baby formula<br/>
sold in the Third World with the logo &quot;breastfeeding is best&quot; as many women,<br/>
in the Third world are feeding their babies improperly prepared formula ie.<br/>
using dirty, polluted water under the misapprehension that this is far<br/>
SUPERIOR to breastmilk. How come &quot;informed choice&quot; only applies to people<br/>
who vote for the legislators in the US???<br/>
Again, thanks Kim for your two cents worth of compassion and clarity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Brooke</div>
