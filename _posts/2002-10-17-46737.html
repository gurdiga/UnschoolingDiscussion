 </span></blockquote>I agree, it is hard to decide which language to learn. Personally, I think a <br/>
small knowledge in either French or Spanish would be good. If you know one or <br/>
both of those it is easy to go into countries with similar languages and <br/>
*kind of* understand what they are talking about. I think if you are going <br/>
into business it would be a good idea to know either Japanese or Chinese. It <br/>
is my personal opinion that people should be at least bilingual. I also think <br/>
that when going to a country where you don&#39;t speak the language that you <br/>
should carry and USE one of those English to _____ dictionaries. I speak <br/>
Spanish, it helps me in the area I live in. I know a tad of Farsi, but I <br/>
don&#39;t hear it often, nor do I have the occasion to speak it so I am limited <br/>
to basic words. (left over from when we used to live in Iran) I can <br/>
follow/stumble along in German and I converse nicely in Swedish. (Only <br/>
because my Great grandma didn&#39;t speak anything else. &lt;g&gt;) I really think it <br/>
is important to know how languages work. Sometimes even if I don&#39;t speak a <br/>
language I can get a good idea of what people are saying. Darin gets a kick <br/>
out of going somewhere with me where people maybe speaking something other <br/>
than English. We went to an Italian restaurant in Chicago years ago and the <br/>
owners spoke Italian. I don&#39;t speak Italian, but I could tell Darin what <br/>
(most) was being said. I guess, I am just lucky. But I still feel strongly <br/>
that people should know one other language other than their own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684111995">I think it&#39;s a good idea that people learn more than one language, although <br/>

<br/>
Our instructor uses some korean language during class, so we understand a<br/>
few words spoken. I can write and read hangul a little, I can usually figure<br/>
out what something says. My son speaks it better than he can write it, there<br/>
are charcters and you have to know what sound the characters stand for, then<br/>
when its spoken it has it own unique sound. We learned to read and write<br/>
Hangul from the web and from one of our instructors who is fluent in it. He<br/>
wrote our names out for our uniforms and thats when it started : ) we just<br/>
took it from there and learned on our own, then when the other insructor<br/>
comes to class he will see what we know.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed too, that sign language is just like spoken words in the<br/>
sense that get a type of slang, my SIL teaches it and when she sees us do it<br/>
she will correct saying thats &quot;slang&quot; so I guess its like anyother language<br/>
: )<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
 &gt; Has anyone learned much of an eastern<br/>
&gt; language with a totally different alphabet?  (Tami, do you also read and<br/>
&gt; write in Hangul-Korean, or just speak it in taekwondo?)  I&#39;m interested to<br/>
&gt; know how it is, learning a whole different system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I agree that sign language can be helpful, especially the invented<br/>
&gt; kind!  I use that every day!  But it&#39;s not called *American* Sign Language<br/>
&gt; for nothing; ASL, which is the one taught and used in the states is<br/>
&gt; different from what many other folks use worldwide.  Why that is, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know, though.<br/>

I can pick out a *few* words in Spanish, both hearing it and reading it. <br/>
However, I&#39;m positive I couldn&#39;t carry on a conversation, translate for <br/>
others (fluently), or write more than a few words at a time. My kids have a <br/>
Spanish computer game that they used to play from time to time, but I think <br/>
they&#39;ve outgrown the style of the games technique. Ren has almost always <br/>
been interested in learning Spanish, but in high school they put her in a <br/>
french class that she got very little out of.<br/>
<br/>
We live in SW.MO, and in *parts* of it there are pockets of <br/>
Spanish-speaking people, but not where we&#39;re at. So there&#39;s no real rush to <br/>
learn it, since we rarely come in contact with them. We&#39;re not even <br/>
suggesting that the kids *need* to learn a 2nd language other than english. <br/>
No big deal --to us.<br/>

I lived in a Russian (then Soviet) immigrant community a looooooong time ago. <br/>
 I remember talking with an old woman once while shopping.  She was looking <br/>
for anbesol and I couldn&#39;t figure out what she meant - kept thinking it was <br/>
some Russian word I didn&#39;t know.  When we resolved that she said that she&#39;d <br/>
been told by her grandchildren that she should learn some English because <br/>
that&#39;s what everyone spoke around her.  She said that she knew everyone in <br/>
the store spoke English, but when they got home, they all spoke Russian!  <br/>
She&#39;d left the Soviet Union after world war II.<br/>

Sweden when she was in her early 20&#39;s. She tried to learn English but was <br/>
made fun of. Lucky for her she moved to Lindsborg, Ks, a Swedish town and she <br/>
never had to learn. I never heard her speak any English, she refused. On my <br/>
Dad&#39;s side; his Mom and her siblings came from Belgium. When his uncle went <br/>
to his first day of school, he couldn&#39;t speak English and the teacher told <br/>
him he wasn&#39;t allowed to talk until he learned English. He never went back. <br/>
He never learned English either. He did become very successful, owning lots <br/>
of land in the Kansas City Area. Now many of my Aunts and Uncles are rich <br/>
because of him. My own Grandma (his sister) had a hard time learning English, <br/>
she dropped out of school after completing 8th grade. She only went for three <br/>
years here in America. She became a Nanny for a couple here in Topeka and met <br/>
my Grandpa, he is the one who taught her to speak English. <br/>
I think this attitude of learn English or don&#39;t live here can be damaging to <br/>
people seeking that fabled land of plenty dream. While I agree that learning <br/>
the language of the country you live in is a good thing, I don&#39;t think it <br/>
should come with an either or *else* attitude.<br/>

I never said learn English or get out. But if you are working and supposedly <br/>

me off in search of someone who is willing to help do what they are being <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233649259">Hi,<br/>
I think it&#39;s more useful and meaningful to learn a language when you will be <br/>
using it.  I took Spanish in high school and never used it outside of class <br/>
until after college.  I worked at a daycare and there was a 4yob adopted <br/>
from Guatamala(I think).  He had limited Enlish skills.  I would ask/tell <br/>
him something in English and then repeat it in Spanish (at least what I <br/>
could remember).<br/>
I took French in college (for something different and since I only knew 1 <br/>
phrase and it wasn&#39;t very nice).  Never used it again, unless reading <br/>
&quot;Madeline&quot; books to my children.<br/>
I learned some American Sign Language and fingerspelling.  That was useful <br/>
when I worked with handicapped kids who used sign and talking to a college <br/>
classmate who was deaf and blind.<br/>
I learned some German before a trip to Germany about 3 years ago.<br/>
Each time (except for high school Spanish) I chose to learn the languages <br/>
for my own purposes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;But if they&#39;re obviously doing &quot;okay&quot; that way, then what&#39;s the <br/>
&gt;problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt; As long as they can communicate with their circle, then that&#39;s all that<br/>
&gt; &gt; matters. IMO&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Because their small circle extends out to my circle. Some of them <br/>
&gt;actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; get hired at stores and do fine just ringing something up, but God <br/>
&gt;forbid<br/>
&gt; &gt; you have a question, you have to actually go find someone else to help <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; because they can&#39;t even do that. A very large mall in  a prominent<br/>
&gt;community<br/>
&gt; &gt; nearby has an awful lot of business from South Americans. For some <br/>
&gt;reason,<br/>
&gt; &gt; instead of hiring bilingual, they only hire people who can speak <br/>
&gt;spanish.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s when I get bothered. That at when I call a business on the phone<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; get someone who has no idea what I&#39;m saying. I don&#39;t go to Little Haiti <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt; &gt; Little Havana to do business because I&#39;m obviously at a disadvantage. <br/>
&gt;But<br/>
&gt; &gt; where neighborhood people shop and speak English is another thing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I lived in Alaska I worked in a shop owned by a Japanese couple.  He<br/>
spoke English well, he&#39;d learned it in school and used it when he<br/>
attended college in the US.  She spoke some but I was always able to<br/>
understand her or figure out what she meant.  <br/>
They held an open house, when their business was new, and invited their<br/>
friends from the large Japanese community in Anchorage.  Myself and my co<br/>
worker were the only people who didn&#39;t speak Japanese there.<br/>
All the specialty candies and cookies and beverages had come from Japan<br/>
and I couldn&#39;t read any of the labels.   We were serving guests at the<br/>
party and you can imagine how difficult it was to figure out what they<br/>
wanted and keep everyone happy.   I was totally immersed in a different<br/>
culture and language.  It was amazing and confusing and overwhelming and<br/>
it was only for a few hours. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I had a kind of new understanding after that of what it must be like to<br/>
leave everything you know behind and start over in a new place where you<br/>
don&#39;t even speak the language.<br/>
Fusako was embarrassed by her English and tried not to speak it for fear<br/>
of saying something wrong and offending someone.  She socialized mainly<br/>
with other Japanese speaking people because that&#39;s what was familiar and<br/>
where she felt at ease.   When she did speak English there were always<br/>
comments about it and it embarrassed her.  People can be pretty stupid<br/>
and it&#39;s never easy to talk to stupid people even when you can speak<br/>
their language.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think she felt it was her duty to become fluent, although she<br/>
actually did.  I think she was just trying to live her life like all of<br/>
us try to.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to live in Portland, OR and there are a lot of Spanish speaking<br/>
people there.   There are lots of migrant workers in the summer and they<br/>
live and work with fellow Spanish speakers and taking all the time and<br/>
effort to become fluent is probably not workable option for them.   Most<br/>
everyone I met though, could speak a little English.   I never had<br/>
trouble understanding the cute boys.&lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992775004">*** Lucky for her she moved to Lindsborg, Ks, a Swedish town and she <br/>
never had to learn. ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been there!!  We spent the night in a motel in Lindsborg in 1996. <br/>
What a beautiful little town, cobbled streets, lot&#39;s of tall people!   We<br/>
bought Swedish salsa there, never heard of it before or since, but it was<br/>
good!  I&#39;m trying to remember if that was where we went to the muscle car<br/>
museum?  Nice town.<br/>
