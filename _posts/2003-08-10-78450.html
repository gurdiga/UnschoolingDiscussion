<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I first visited AOL&#39;s homeschooling forum it was very intimidating. <br/>
&gt; All<br/>
&gt; these people who knew so much and could spot the least little bit of off<br/>
&gt; thinking and weren&#39;t afraid to point it out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I read and read and read. When I was done with the message boards I read<br/>
&gt; the archives, going back 3 or 4 years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After that it was like I&#39;d actually been on the list for 3 or 4 years.  I<br/>
&gt; knew the people, I knew the topic. Which made it very easy to post.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me, too. I really, really read and read. I read &#39;til my eyes watered---came <br/>
back and read some more. I don&#39;t think I missed one archive---just read and <br/>
read and read. When he light went off in my head, it was GLORIOUS! And THEN I <br/>
started posting, as if I were a &quot;regular&quot;---but by then I *felt* like it!<br/>
<br/>
Now you can&#39;t shut me up----well, Joyce or Helen *could*. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
