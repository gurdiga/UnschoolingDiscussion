Subject: Home Schooled Students: Admission & Financial Aid<br/>
<br/>
Due to recent and growing interest by colleges across the country<br/>
regarding applicable federal laws and regulations governing the admission<br/>
requirements and granting of financial aid to home schoolers, Home School<br/>
Legal Defense has been corresponding with numerous colleges on this<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
By way of introduction, Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) is a<br/>
non-profit advocacy organization established to defend and advance the<br/>
constitutional right of parents to direct the education of their children<br/>
and to protect family freedoms. Through annual memberships, HSLDA<br/>
currently has nearly 70,000 member families united in service together,<br/>
providing a strong voice when and where needed. Each year, thousands of<br/>
member families receive legal consultation by letter and phone, hundreds<br/>
more are represented through negotiations with local officials, and dozens<br/>
are represented in court proceedings. The National Center for Home<br/>
Education, foua division of HSLDA, networks state-wide organizations in<br/>
all 50 states for rapid response to federal issues, monitors and lobbies<br/>
for pro-home school and parental rights bills and serves as a clearing<br/>
house of major home school research.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since the home school Amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1998<br/>
(which was drafted by HSLDA&#39;s Senior Counsel, Chris Klicka) was passed by<br/>
Congress, the rules and guidelines for colleges have changed. However,<br/>
these new changes have taken time to reach most colleges, and many are<br/>
still unaware of the new law and its impact. For this reason, Chris Klicka<br/>
of HSLDA has drafted a memo outlining these changes for the benefit of all<br/>
college admission and financial aid officers. You can read a copy of this<br/>
memo by visiting our website at:<br/>

<br/>
Further, HSLDA has just release the results of an informal survey of 971<br/>
colleges conducted last year. The purpose of this study was (1) to<br/>
establish what colleges and universities currently require of home school<br/>
applicants, (2) to compare those requirements to HSLDA&#39;s Recommended<br/>
College Admission Policies, and (3) to encourage colleges and universities<br/>
to loosen unnecessarily restrictive home school admission requirements and<br/>
adopt the HSLDA&#39;s Recommended College Admission Policies. To view the<br/>
results of this study and HSLDA&#39;s Recommended Policies, go to:<br/>

ranking of the 513 colleges which responded to the survey, based on their<br/>
current policies. HSLDA is open to extending the survey and continuing to<br/>
update the results for those colleges who were not able to participate in<br/>
the original survey or whose policies have changed since then. For more<br/>

then the second time (after I restarted the computer) all I could get was a<br/>
black screen with a bunch of beautiful indigo lines on it. Nice, but not<br/>
what I expected to see. <br/>
<br/>
Could anyone else access this site to read the report???<br/>
<br/>
Let me know please,<br/>
