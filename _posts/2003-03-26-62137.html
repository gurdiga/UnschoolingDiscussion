&lt;&lt; Hi, Right up my alley.<br/>
 I&#39;m on week 7 or 8 of pertussis - and I was vaccinated, so don&#39;t let the <br/>
 docs tell you that vaccinations will protect everyone.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know SO many people that were immunized that ended up getting diseases they <br/>
were immunized against, so she shouldn&#39;t blame herself at all.<br/>
In fact, the Pertussis vaccination is one of the worst for causing severe <br/>
problems, so she may have saved them suffering or brain damage for all she <br/>
knows.<br/>
Dose those kids up with HERBS right now. Google Pertussis and natural <br/>
remedies and see what comes up.<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
