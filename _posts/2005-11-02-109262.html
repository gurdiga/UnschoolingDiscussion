<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058000223">We have our Halloween Pictures now :)  Nathaniel was a dragon and <br/>
Madeleine was a unicorn.  You can see pictures of their costumes at <br/>
www.naturallynhkids.com/pb/wp_6a878265.html.  This was the first year <br/>
that Nathaniel seemed to have a sense of what was happening.  After a <br/>
few houses, he would call out as he turned to leave, &quot;Bye ... Happy <br/>
Halloween.&quot;  Madeleine would then call cheerfully as we walked <br/>
away, &quot;Bye ... bye ... bye ... bye ... bye ... bye ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The earlier part of the day was rather exhausting!  My in-laws <br/>
insisted on having us drive to their house so they could see the kids <br/>
in their costumes.  Of course, they only had limited times available <br/>
in their schedules.  So, we ended up going over in the early <br/>
afternoon and then waiting for the city&#39;s events to start.  The kids <br/>
enjoyed the hay ride, story time, and face painting.  The pictures <br/>
with Big Bird and Cookie Monster were too overwhelming.  We also <br/>
ended up waiting in line for 20 minutes at the fire station.  That <br/>
would have been fine if there had been fire engines inside to explore <br/>
but it was just a food line for pizza, which my kids couldn&#39;t eat <br/>
anyway.  So, that was a bit frustrating.  Also, we had just spent 10 <br/>
minutes waiting in line for the hay ride.  This was compounded by the <br/>
fact that the family waiting behind us were not very understanding <br/>
with their 2-year-old who was having a hard time waiting in line, <br/>
especially since his dad insisted that he was not to be held.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun seeing a lot of families we know all dressed up in <br/>
costumes :)<br/>
