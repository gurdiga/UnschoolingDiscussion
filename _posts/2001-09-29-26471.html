<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037175955">Hi folks,<br/>
I&#39;m hoping to get some input/support/help with a situation we&#39;re in. I have <br/>
my son&#39;s permission to share the following with you.<br/>
<br/>
We are in our fourth year of homeschooling/unschooling. My 12 year old son is <br/>
going through a hard time right now. His father, who is VERY active in his <br/>
life, announced this summer he is getting married at the end of October to a <br/>
woman he&#39;d known four days. My son, partner and I know her better, as she is <br/>
a close friend of a close friends of ours, and we all actually like her a <br/>
lot, but my son is still understandably freaked out. It was a long summer in <br/>
some ways, with his dad acting like a jerk to all of us, being pissed that we <br/>
weren&#39;t all delighted for him, blaming, etc. (My son&#39;s dad is one of my best <br/>
friends, and we have mostly gotten along forever. He also spends more time <br/>
with our son than most dads who live with their kids.) <br/>
<br/>
My son has also just hit puberty and is NOT happy about it. It feels like <br/>
another thing he&#39;s out of control about. He&#39;s stressed about the World Trade <br/>
Center events because even the WORLD seems out of control. In the last year <br/>
he lost two beloved pets, and the two left are quite old. His grandmother has <br/>
an ongoing battle with cancer. You get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, Julian expressed interest in doing an IQ test. I asked if he <br/>
wanted a professional, &quot;official&quot; thing, or just something casual, and he <br/>
said something casual was fine. I happened to find something on the web, <br/>
offered it, and he did it. I was not surprised to find that he scored <br/>
extremely high. He was.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out that he&#39;s always thought he was average or possibly slightly below <br/>
in intelligence. (I had no idea that he believed this about himself. It was <br/>
something he kept pretty carefully hidden.) I think much of this comes from <br/>
having highly motivated friends who also have a certain amount of &quot;attitude&quot; <br/>
about their own intelligence, and from some bad early school experiences. <br/>
This basically objective information about himself (not so much a number, but <br/>
the fact that according to the test he scored higher than 98% of people <br/>
taking the test) feels good to him, but is also scary...it makes him have to <br/>
incorporate new knowledge of himself. (Not only is he not average or a little <br/>
below, but  probably pretty far above. Again, not a surprise to US...but <br/>
certainly to HIM.)<br/>
<br/>
So...we&#39;re trying to help. First, he has asked to see a counselor for a <br/>
little while, and we&#39;re going to do that. Second, he feels that he wants a <br/>
little more structure. We talked about unschooling, and both agreed that we <br/>
think continuing to unschool is best...He wants to learn what he wants, in <br/>
his own ways...BUT he wants more nudging to do things, more structure, etc.  <br/>
He has a problem with self-motivation and wants help. He feels it will help <br/>
him feel safer, and like things are less out of control.<br/>
<br/>
SO... How does one incorporate more structure into unschooling, at the <br/>
child&#39;s request? I am NOT the world&#39;s most structured person anyway, and he <br/>
has no idea how he wants it to look. I think ANYTHING coming from me would <br/>
help at this point, because I think he wants to feel taken care of and in <br/>
control. How do I help find a structure for us that still lets him be in <br/>
control of his life and learning? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Kathryn<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do you have the books that come with encyclopedias (World Book or Book of <br/>
Knowledge), a paperback or two that&#39;s basically the outline of a curriculum?  <br/>
If so, maybe just set that in his lap.  Or there are online versions too.  <br/>
SOMEWHERE (if anyone here knows, please spill the URL!) there is an online <br/>
curriculum you can plug your kid&#39;s name into and it creates a checklist and <br/>
keeps track of what&#39;s marked completed.   Some of the structured-moms on <br/>
another list I&#39;m on were talking about it and I looked at it, but nobody <br/>
seemed to have kept the address later.<br/>
<br/>
Does he know or like the &quot;What your xth grader needs to Know&quot; series?  Maybe <br/>
he could work through those, marking off what he already knows but reviewing <br/>
it, and finding other sources/resources for the sections he doesn&#39;t feel he <br/>
totally knows.  That could keep him busy for a year, and feeling very <br/>
structured.<br/>

might feel the need for more structure now... <br/>
<br/>
How about creating something that&#39;s structured, but still allows him to<br/>
have a lot of choices? Like, maybe find a booklist (the one in the<br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook is nice) and having him choose and read a<br/>
book every couple weeks, or a short story every week? Handwriting might<br/>
also be good, I can&#39;t remember the name of the program I saw, but it<br/>
started withregular print and slowly worked into italic... a lot of folks<br/>
I know find handwriting sort of soothing when they&#39;re stressed, it&#39;s kind<br/>
of mindless...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113862781">Hi Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this could be as simple as a weekly(or monthly) meeting to discuss<br/>
goals.  He can create goals, write them down, set deadlines, etc...with or<br/>
without your help.  If he has a written plan, you will be able to look at it<br/>
to see if he needs *nudging*.  This would work with any interest he wants to<br/>
pursue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689612632">I don&#39;t think I understand this completely.( I&#39;m slow )  Is he only<br/>
looking for structure in a few things or a regular sit down - every day -<br/>
all subject - curriculum?  <br/>
Since you said he agrees unschooling is still the way to go, I&#39;m thinking<br/>
it&#39;s just one or two things he&#39;s interested in structuring?<br/>
<br/>
My biggest thought here is, maybe he just wants you with him.  Right<br/>
there WITH him as he does - whatever.  If he&#39;s feeling uncertain about<br/>
life, maybe it&#39;s not so much a structure thing as it is an assurance<br/>
thing.  I only bring this up because my own son went through something<br/>
like this after the death of his grandfather.  <br/>
If this isn&#39;t it, sorry about side tracking. <br/>
<br/>
Well, if it&#39;s math or English maybe you could look for a math club or a<br/>
book club or young writers club that would meet regularly.  Maybe there<br/>
are some on-line?  Or, what about those unit studies I seem to see<br/>
everywhere on every topic.  Maybe you could find some on things that<br/>
interest him.   My son likes to do the Dell math puzzles and logic<br/>
problems that are published like a magazine once a month.  <br/>
<br/>
He could get a book of science experiments and work his way through.  Or<br/>
Zoobooks,  they now publish curriculums for certain issues.  Probably<br/>
after you look at a few of them you could make up your own. <br/>
<br/>
Is it Cobblestone that publishes all kinds of magazines for kids?  They<br/>
are usually available at the library and they are on such topics as<br/>
social studies, culture, science etc.  He could create his own unit<br/>
study.  Yes, they publish Calliope, Faces, Odyssey, and Cobblestone (<br/>
just found the ad ) They sell these to schools so I bet they have<br/>
curriculums for certain issues too.  <br/>
<br/>
Writing in a journal?  Might have therapeutic qualities too.  <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just guessing and thinking here.  I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s having a<br/>
hard time.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks, Kathryn<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a couple of thoughts.  Is it possible he is looking for more<br/>
structure FROM you because he feels so out of cantrol and doesn&#39;t know<br/>
how to get back in control?  I mean most of what you said is really out<br/>
of his control, maybe he feels like he can&#39;t do anything right now<br/>
without help.  If that is the case, maybe you just need to set a few<br/>
schedules for the family and he would be okay.  <br/>
It does not sound like he wants help with WHAT to study.  You seem to be<br/>
saying his problem is in the when and if to study realm.  At the risk of<br/>
getting jumped here yet again, maybe what you need to do is make up a<br/>
list of what are appropriate amounts for a day or week as a guideline,<br/>
which is what we did here.  If you discuss with him while making up the<br/>
list, he will feel a part of the process without having to feel sole<br/>
responsibility for it.  <br/>
If he really is asking for help choosing WHAT to study, I can&#39;t help much<br/>
as I&#39;ve never really had to face that.  My girls heve NEVER wanted help<br/>
with the &#39;what&#39;!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Bridget<br/>
<br/>
ps - One other thing - tell him IQ tests are meaningless in the real<br/>
world.  He should not let a good score make him feel superior in<br/>
intellect because all that test tested was one little type of thought<br/>
process.  It can not test how well he knows literature, or if he<br/>
understands the internal combustion engine well enough to fix it, or how<br/>
well he can play the piano, or how good he is at building furniture, or<br/>
whether he understands the concepts that rule our physical universe.  My<br/>
dh and I both score really well on IQ tests (usually in the MENSA level).<br/>
 And neither of us thinks they are worthwhile.  <br/>
<br/>
OO  oo  00   oo   OO   00   oo  OO  oo  00  oo   OO  00  oo  OO  oo  00  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722572066">I remember. And that post also stated that the<br/>
informal test was benificial to Julian&#39;s perception of<br/>
himself. I don&#39;t really see anything wrong with it<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
But, in Bridgette&#39;s reply, she took time to point out<br/>
some dangers of placing too much value on a &quot;high&quot; IQ.<br/>
And she also included a statement as to what she<br/>
percieves her own and her DH&#39;s (IQ)to be. And that<br/>
they have validated this with repeated testing.<br/>
(&quot;tests....&quot;usually&quot;).  She is a bright lady.  I bet<br/>
she gets the point.  If IQ scores are not &quot;worthwhile&quot;<br/>
one doesn&#39;t go out of the way to state what they might<br/>
be. One omits that information. <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of descriptions of what intelligence<br/>
may or may not be....and they are all interesting, but<br/>
not the last word....<br/>
<br/>
I think it is fortunate that it was helpfull to the<br/>
young man to look in that particular mirror and see<br/>
such a nice reflection. Glad his Mama helped him do<br/>
it. I don&#39;t think he is in danger (from what she<br/>
described of him) as being in any danger of<br/>
self-aggrandisement. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>IMHO, IQ testing can be helpful in finding out and<br/>
accepting the ability to grasp concepts.  I have an IQ<br/>
of 120, and I find that I can understand things a lot<br/>
quicker than others whose IQ isn&#39;t as high.  While it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that I am better or &#39;more intelligent&#39;,<br/>
it has made me realise that I have the ability of a<br/>
quick mind.  It was brought home to me the other day,<br/>
I have a girlfriend who had a head injury last year,<br/>
and some of the things that i percieve as simple, she<br/>
just cant get her head around.  Her son is in school,<br/>
and she often rings me up to check that what she<br/>
thinks his homework is saying is actually what it is,<br/>
and sometimes she just hasnt a clue, when it to me is<br/>
very simple.<br/>
So tests like IQ and memory testing can have its<br/>
place, although, I have to admit you have to be in the<br/>
right place emotionally (sometimes) to comprehend just<br/>
what the test is saying, eg, i am dumb, but I have a<br/>
high IQ.  Is htere other stuff going on the  brain, <br/>
that is taking up resources?  That was my problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533008941">Julz, I suspect your &quot;IQ&quot; mesures higher than what you<br/>
posted, in some areas, such as compassion. Only that<br/>
isn&#39;t in the ratings. <br/>
<br/>
Your friend with the head injury may still have an<br/>
intact IQ and have other cognitive difficulties. Head<br/>
injuries are odd sometimes. She does still have good<br/>
sense.  She calls you for help.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it can.<br/>
I think anyone who&#39;s still attached to or ashamed of or even thinking about <br/>
their IQ scores should read Howard Gardner&#39;s _Frames of Mind_ or anything <br/>
else about multiple intelliences, and get over it.<br/>
<br/>
IQ tests don&#39;t measure musical ability, and absodamnlutely cannot and will <br/>
not even ever give a single &quot;extra point&quot; to interpersonal skills.  <br/>
<br/>
Being good at vocabulary and formal math don&#39;t make good humans, good moms, <br/>
or even great employees or college students!  It&#39;s a scam and an abuse.  The <br/>
harm buries any slight benefits.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321421217">what helped my kids when they felt this way is a write and wipe board <br/>
hanging in the diningroom, I list things that need done around the <br/>
house there all the time so my kids decided to list all the things <br/>
they felt they should do for the week on there, now they just made <br/>
like a list I want to do 5 workbook pages and play oregon trail for a <br/>
while read a book stuff like that and that may be all he needs, but <br/>
it is all self created without your real imput!<br/>
 he can choose to do it or leave it!<br/>
I think that by giving him an acctual curriculum he will  think he <br/>
HAS to know all of that stuff and not feel as free to choose what he <br/>
wants where as if he makes a list of things he would like to <br/>
investigate, read or work on he has done all of the coosing freely <br/>
without anyone elses idea of what a  12yo needs to know! thus more <br/>
self satisfying!<br/>
hope this helps!<br/>
