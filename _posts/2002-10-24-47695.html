&gt; really too small for them, and 5 rats is really too much for us. We<br/>

and Rhia. They are delightful pets. We got 15 the first time and 12, the <br/>
second from two breeders in Florida for a homeschool &quot;class&quot; I hosted over a <br/>
year ago.<br/>
<br/>
 The kids each got two-three female rats to train. They learned the most <br/>
amazing things!<br/>
<br/>
Several of the kids made their own cages (ours is made of shelving with a <br/>
plastic tray bottom). It was less than $50 to build---and it&#39;s a condo.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.Mary! Watch out for us rat lovers! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I have seen a few pics of homemade cages, some with plans, on the<br/>
internet.  Would you be interested in the urls?  Lanora is always<br/>
searching sites for info on rats and she could tell me where to find the<br/>
pages, I&#39;ll write them down and send them on if you&#39;re interested.<br/>

the urls would be great. thanks for sharing ideas....it may have been<br/>
just testing. I am afraid I have been much more used to hamsters &quot;biting&quot;<br/>
and may have mistaken this behaviour. I was told by the pet shop guy that<br/>
rats were great pets. less likely to bite than hamsters,guinea pigs<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814056955">Is this any kind of hamster cage? We have 3 plus some play things that all hook together. One is plastic, about the size and shape of an aquarium. It has a built-in hidey-hole underneath the exercise wheel, and a tube that leads up into a spiral kind of toy thing. A tube leads from that into a maze that&#39;s approximately two feet long and a foot wide, 4 inches high. There is another tube going up into a spiral toy in the middle of that. Then there&#39;s a tube that goes in to a wire cage that resembles a bird cage but that has three different levels and two &quot;houses&quot;, and that has a big round ball thing wired to the side of it. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that all made sense! LOL It takes up about 5 feet long-ways when set up. <br/>
<br/>
I can definitely deal with a smart critter! The hamsters seemed pretty dumb to me! :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Bird cage&quot; would have to be three feet tall. Levels would need to be big <br/>
enough to comfortably hold two rats. Rats are a lot bigger than hamsters. But <br/>
fancy rats are smaller than wild or feeder rats.<br/>
<br/>
Wood is not the best idea for rat cages although I have seen it done well.<br/>
<br/>
You can google &quot;fancy rats&quot;, &quot;fancy rat breeders&quot;, &quot;rat health&quot;, etc. Someone <br/>
here mentioned The Rat Lady---that&#39;s how she&#39;s known. She has an excellent <br/>
website as well as a book. <br/>
<br/>
Our rats cost maybe $10 each? But we bought a mess of them---all pet quality <br/>
from show breeders. They come in delightful coat colors and <br/>
combinations---hooded, Bershire, lilac, champagne, even marked like Siamese <br/>
cats---Beautiful! They have satin, rex, teddy bear coats--and even hairless. <br/>
They even have tailless for those who are sqeamish about tails, but since <br/>
they perspire through their tails, theyr&#39;e not recommended for hot areas of <br/>
the country. The cost may be higher in different parts of the country or <br/>
according to the color or show quality. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823107509">My husband made a really nice cage for our snake. Didn&#39;t use any plans, just <br/>
kind of winged it. Figured out how big he wanted it and got some pressed <br/>
wood for the sides and back and bottom. He used wire for the tops and front <br/>
and put latched on it. He even covered the bottom with some stick on vinyl <br/>
tiles to make it easier to clean. Pretty easy.<br/>

I tried finding the web sites I mentioned, I kept getting dumped off my<br/>
server.  I went to &quot;google&quot; and put in &quot;fancy rat breeders&quot; and &quot;pet<br/>
rats&quot; and got a LOT of results.  Many of the ratty lovers with web sites<br/>
have a &quot;my cages&quot; page and those who built their own usually have a<br/>
description of how they did.<br/>
<br/>
There is a site...www.martinscages.com...who sells rat cages.  They are<br/>
very reasonable and come in &quot;powder coated&quot; which is better for rats too.<br/>
