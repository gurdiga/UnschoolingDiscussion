I was a teacher and may go back to that if need be.  It&#39;s unfortunate, but it <br/>
may happen at some point.  I would try other things first.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Teaching classes to homeschoolers in your area - we have lots of teachers in <br/>
our area and they hold coop classes. Not boring old reading writing and <br/>
&#39;rithmatic but Evirothon, forensics, Anatomy & Physiology, art, Math Olympiads.<br/>
Sylvan Learning centers(this one would probably consist of evening hours so <br/>
you don&#39;t have to miss homeschool activities and an actual paycheck)<br/>
Subbing - good if you have someone to watch/play with your little one on <br/>
short notice<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s is what I think about: I like to think of unschooling as &quot;Living life <br/>
as if school does not exist&quot; How would I earn money if school was NOT an <br/>
option? (For us it isn&#39;t)<br/>
There are way more choices between the choices of <br/>
Unschooling and broke&lt;------&gt;School and regular 9-5 job (or in your case 7:35 <br/>
- 2:40 LOL)<br/>
