<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924025252">I am not so sure that thumbsucking is related to nursing...my 6 yo son (the one<br/>
with the hair twirling habit) still uses a pacifier to go to sleep (and if he gets<br/>
really upset or tired during the day. Jason nursed until he self-weaned at around<br/>
2.5 yo (actually caught me off guard, he just started skipping days and then one<br/>
time nursed for a minute, kind of giggled and then never wanted to nurse again).<br/>
I also have a friend who nursed her dd for over 3 years who did not give up <br/>
her pacifier until this year (I think she is 9)<br/>
<br/>
My youngest (will be 3 in Feb) is still nursing, but he never took a pacifier. I tried<br/>
to get him too because he absolutely *hated* his car seat and it would have made car<br/>
trips much easier. He does like to chew on them occasionally, mainly because he sees<br/>
Jason with them. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think that the suck need is stronger in certain kids....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re right Stephanie. It&#39;s just a stronger need in some children.  <br/>

<br/>
What other traits do those kids have?  <br/>
My friend Katie is an artist.  Physical stuff--sculpture, metalwork, <br/>
three-dimensional.  She doesn&#39;t sing nor much like music.  She used to <br/>
comment (not in a positive way) that my kids were always SINGING.  She wanted <br/>
it quieter so she could read or sculpt with paper or aluminum foil or <br/>
whatever she could reach.<br/>
<br/>
But Holly and Marty, the shirt-sucking kids (there would be a little place <br/>
right in the middle of the neck band where the cloth was stretched and broken <br/>
through) don&#39;t have that.  Holly wants tags out of her clothes; Marty cares <br/>
not a bit.  Both are jockish (as a common trait, compared to Kirby) but <br/>
Marty&#39;s not competitive.  Strong and agile, but passive.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a pattern.  But would the sucking maybe be part of a greater <br/>
package of bodily &quot;talent&quot; or traits?  Is it part of being introverted?  (N<br/>
one of these kids are totally shy, but they do like to be alone sometimes.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, Jason is one of  *the* most extroverted kids I know. He *hates* to be alone.<br/>
His favorite thing is to go to his friend Eric&#39;s (or have Eric come here) and play<br/>
from 11am to 7 or 8 pm. He thrives on interaction with people. We went to the ocean<br/>
for 2 weeks at the end of the summer and between the fact that it rained the first<br/>
week we were there and that he did not have much interaction with other kids while<br/>
we were there, by the end of the  two weeks, he was miserable (and acting accordingly).<br/>
The worst possible thing for him is to be alone. We have been having lots of talks about<br/>
how it is ok to be alone (and that mommy does need some time alone!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116356177">Oh...forgot to mention that Jason is very sensitive with clothing...we cut the tags out<br/>
of his shirts, he wears his socks inside out (so the seams don&#39;t bother him), he will not<br/>
wear socks with terry cloth inside (which means that I pretty much buy girls white bobby <br/>
socks), he will not wear jeans and we really had a hard time finding pants for him when<br/>
he outgrew the cotton ones this year. He does not like the tops of his pants to touch his<br/>
shoes (so I pin then up) and his shoes have to be double tied and the ends and loops<br/>
can not touch the soles of his shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Besides this, he is actually a pretty laid back little kid...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thats a good question.  For Jon Phillip.. he is the most atheltic and <br/>
coordinated child I have. He learned to ride a bike ( w/o training wheels) at <br/>
barely 4.  He is very creative and imaginative.   He is very funny and <br/>
bright.   He can be soooo sweet and loving and considerate ( and he can be a <br/>
real pill too, as Ive described earlier)   He is the most attached child Ive <br/>
had.  He still sleeps with us at 7 and half.   He really likes to be &quot;babied&quot; <br/>
, carried sometimes, held and cuddled etc. But, he is also very independent <br/>
when he wants to be.  He is very friendly and outgoing and gets along well <br/>
with others.  He sort of the risk taking, &quot;i&#39;m invincible&quot; type ( recall the <br/>
flaming stick in the eye and the recent wax head incident)  <br/>
<br/>
  My amatuer psychoanalysis/gut feeling is that he is a natural thumb sucker <br/>
and he continues to suck his thumb happily at home because he hasnt gotten <br/>
any negative feedback from his immediate family.   BUT, I think the shirt <br/>
chewing came as a replacement for the thumb sucking when he started school.  <br/>
He DID get some negative feedback, mostly from his evil witch teacher who <br/>
told him she would cut off his thumb if he kept sucking it ( which I didnt <br/>
find out til MUCH later)   Of course she said it in a joking ,not really <br/>
serious tone,  (in her description, that is)    Anyway, he didnt start the <br/>
shirt chewing til he was in Kindergarten.  I think it was Ren who also <br/>
noticed that maybe the shirt chewing is the &quot;public&quot; equivalent to the thumb <br/>
sucking at home or other comfortable places.   I really think that JP sucks <br/>
his thumb and chews his shirt as a coping mechanism.  And, that is OK with <br/>
me.  If that is what helps him relax and feel content, I think he has the <br/>
right to do it.    I think I mentioned earlier that I am a bit concerned over <br/>
knowing when HE wants to quit and it becomes a habit he wants to break, and <br/>
how to help him break it.  I guess I will deal with that when the time comes.<br/>
