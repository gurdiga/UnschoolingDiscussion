&gt;Yes, and I think it&#39;s the definition of unschooling that&#39;s the hang up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If we define unschooling as child led learning then we can say that<br/>
&gt;unschooling won&#39;t work for every child. The environment might be lacking.<br/>
&gt;The parent might not know how to interact with the child, for instance an<br/>
&gt;adult who was bookish might be less inclined to give her kinesthetic child<br/>
&gt;the freedom to use his body as much as he needs, not being able to perceive<br/>
&gt;that as learning. Child led is only a part of the picture.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But if we define unschooling as how children *naturally* learn then we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;say unschooling won&#39;t work because it&#39;s the same as saying children can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think one of the stumbling blocks with unschooling and learning<br/>
&gt;disabilities is that there isn&#39;t a large enough community of unschoolers of<br/>
&gt;LD kids. All the research is oriented towards kids who are expected to learn<br/>
&gt;what is taught in school, with the goal of hopefully getting them into<br/>
&gt;school. The research supports that being taught through particular methods<br/>
&gt;is what various LD kids need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But does that research apply to helping LD kids learn naturally? Helping<br/>
&gt;them become themselves rather than products to be fed to colleges or the<br/>
&gt;workforce?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If we begin with the premise that kids don&#39;t need taught then the quest is<br/>
&gt;to find ways to help kids learn what they want to learn, not learn what we<br/>
&gt;think they should learn in the time we think they should learn it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For instance there are ways of helping dyslexic people read. But if those<br/>
&gt;ways involve coercion, regardless of how authoritative someone is, then<br/>
&gt;perhaps it&#39;s a good idea to look at the goals they are imposing on the<br/>
&gt;dyslexic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I copied the whole damn thing again. Because its worth reading and <br/>
rereading. And it probably would be great for me to keep it on my <br/>
pasteboard and use it as a standard response to a good portion of <br/>
questions around here. Seriously, no joking. No ill will towards the <br/>
question askers.<br/>
This is a great piece of work on unschooling. Especially the <br/>
environmental part.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is what I meant by the root of what all the talk about &#39;problems&#39; is.<br/>
The kids are holding (or being held) up to some sort of basic standard. <br/>
Albeit grandma, neighbors or other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Figure out your kids learning style, become or get one of those people, <br/>
allow the environment to be nurturing and caring with a democratic <br/>
flavour to the house and let your kid learn whatever they want.<br/>
