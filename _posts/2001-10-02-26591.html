<div id="ygrps-yiv-349853157">Really, I find all radio personalities to be &quot;rude&quot; in that they cut off <br/>
anyone who disagrees with them and don&#39;t let them finish their thought even, <br/>
no matter what side of the aisle they are on. What I do find useful in <br/>
listening to them with my daughter is we get these great jumping off points <br/>
for wonderful conversations. <br/>
