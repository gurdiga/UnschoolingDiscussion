<br/>
yes, we DO look like a bunch of *prunes* from having been out in the sun so<br/>
much &lt;G&gt; ... we&#39;re now swimming @ night b/c the water is TOO HOT during the<br/>
day, just glad we don&#39;t have to worry about getting the boys up/ready for<br/>
SCHOOL!!!   we&#39;ve enjoyed watching the stars pop out every evening and the<br/>
bats eating their late night *snacks* (hehe, sounds like an old Hitchcock<br/>
movie, doesn&#39;t it???)  ...<br/>
<br/>
as a matter of fact, our weatherman said the high that&#39;s been sitting over<br/>
Tx for the past few days is from ARIZONA ~~&gt;&gt; sooooooooo PULEEZE TAKE IT<br/>
BACK!!!  lol ...<br/>
<br/>
Pris ~&gt; who&#39;z fanning herself as she types :I<br/>
WARNING: I cannot be help responsible for the above, as apparently my cats<br/>
have learned how to type ...<br/>

&gt; Sorry Pris... I have no sympathy for you as we live in Tucson, AZ<br/>
&gt; where that &quot;dry heat&quot; they keep talking about is at 100 degrees today<br/>
&gt; and we&#39;ve had this weather since the end of April this year.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; one of the reasons we are moving to Colorado next year as I cannot<br/>
&gt; stand another summer indoors.  The swimming pool gets a bit old and I<br/>
&gt; will get even older looking if I stay out in the sun too much longer<br/>
&gt; (LOL)<br/>
