&gt; How &#39;bout I start you off with asking you to share some of your experience<br/>
&gt; in balancing the needs/interests/desires of your six youngsters....with <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; own needs.<br/>
&gt;     I am personally falling into a burnout phase and hoping to prevent a<br/>
&gt; full- blown problem here.  I&#39;ve had several viruses in the past six weeks.<br/>
&gt; I am zapped of energy and sleep deprived.  I am finding myself not enjoying<br/>
&gt; much....though I try to focus on the moments of laughter and joy.  Dh works<br/>
&gt; excessively....he comes home tired and,  well,  without much energy to<br/>
&gt; contribute.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello Susan,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the welcome.  <br/>
<br/>
About the balancing act you reference.  Admittedly, my own needs oft times do <br/>
get placed on the back burner.  It is a good thing I am not an overly needy <br/>
person!  As someone else mentioned elsewhere on this list, the kids stay <br/>
small for such a short  season.  I am willing to roll with it - but then, <br/>
today is a GOOD day!  lol<br/>
<br/>
By nature, I am a meticulous person.  I like things &#39;in order&#39; and done &#39;my <br/>
way&#39;, in the home.  Out of necessity however, the Lord has made some changes <br/>
in me as the demands (with a capital &#39;d&#39;) of our household have increased.  <br/>
Now, while I still like things in order around here, I have become more <br/>
&#39;relaxed&#39; and more willing to be attentive and open to the &#39;eb and flow&#39; of <br/>
our household.  This applies to home learning, too.  If something important <br/>
doesn&#39;t get done, we&#39;ll try again tomorrow.  Thank heaven for - TOMORROWS!<br/>
<br/>
I am also fortunately, the high energy type.  There is NEVER a dull moment <br/>
around here.  However, I know what it is to be sleep depraved, too.  No <br/>
laughing matter.  I say, just hang in there and this season shall pass, too.  <br/>
Perhaps even as soon as in just a few days...  My suggestion when you have <br/>
been so ill as of late would be - put all else aside and just get some rest.  <br/>
There is no need afterall to fully sap yourself over school and house <br/>
cleaning or anything else.  Just take a deep breath and relax.  Sounds like <br/>
you need an in-home vacation - some R & R.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, are you blessed to have any older children who could help with simple <br/>
needs around the house, especially in this hard time of yours?  This to me is <br/>
to be termed &#39;basic life training&#39; in our home.  The kids here mean ALOT when <br/>
it comes to the little details around the house - especially when mom is out <br/>
of commission for what ever reason.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of encouragement...<br/>
~ Lisa<br/>

<br/>
Lately, I&#39;ve had some hormonal imbalances (hysterectomy as soon as I <br/>
work up the nerve) and one of the things it has affected is my eating <br/>
needs.  I used to be able to go for at least two days on practically <br/>
nothing but nibbles.  All of a sudden I can&#39;t do it anymore.  I get <br/>
REALLY cranky if I don&#39;t eat often enough - like three times a day.  <br/>
So the running mantra in the house now is, &quot;Get that woman a <br/>
Twizzler, STAT&quot; or &quot;Get that woman a Gummie Bear, STAT&quot;<br/>
Of course what I really need is real food but that is there way of <br/>
telling me to eat.  <br/>
