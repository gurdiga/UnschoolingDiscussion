one this year was great but only scratched the surface of what I think<br/>
is a pivotal concept in Unschooling life. It would be great if there<br/>
were more time allotted to it.<br/>

together in the room.  I wasn&#39;t comfortable speaking up the way it was, and<br/>
it was hard to hear what other people were saying.  ~Rue<br/>
