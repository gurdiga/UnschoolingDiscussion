I don&#39;t stretch to pretend to know or believe what I don&#39;t know or believe.<br/>
There&#39;s no good reason to.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s &quot;stretch&quot; involves faith, then that is NOT &quot;reason,&quot; by <br/>
definition.<br/>
<br/>
If people bypass or overcome the definition of &quot;reason&quot; and base their <br/>
beliefs or actions on faith or teachings or traditions instead of &quot;reason,&quot; <br/>
then theys should find other ways to discuss that than telling people around <br/>
them not to consider them &quot;unreasonable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d avoid any word with the root of &quot;reason&quot; in such discussions, if I were <br/>
trying to justify a faith-based premise.<br/>

conclude that creation is not valid is a stretch as well, there is not<br/>
enough evidence for this.  Of course, it is my opinion, just as it is the<br/>
opinion of others that the evidence points to a &quot;big bang&quot; type of<br/>
evolution.<br/>

If a person says to me, &quot;If you believe in God and/or creation just admit<br/>
that you have no good reason to do so.  Admit that &quot;faith&quot; is based<br/>
purely on emotion and that you have no right to see reason in any of it,<br/>
then I&#39;ll accept and respect you.&quot;, I cannot accommodate them.  If I<br/>
truly believed that there was no evidence for my belief in God and the<br/>
validity/authority of the Bible then I could admit that faith is a blind<br/>
adherence to propaganda but I don&#39;t.<br/>
