<div id="ygrps-yiv-932612390">Margaux associates Schuyler and family with waffles too!  At the last conference, we met their family in town and we went to a waffle bar sidewalk window and Margaux, of course, got the chocolate dipped waffle which she STILL remembers.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just the other day, I was talking about their family and Margaux, a couple of hours later asked me to make her waffles!  AND that same day waffles came up in conversation WITH Schuyler!<br/>
 <br/>
Schuyler most definitely needs those delightful waffle makers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602844254">That looks like fun and those look like very cool waffles. I like waffles, do you like waffles? <br/>
<br/>
How very sweet to know that even though I wasn&#39;t there, I was thought of and there in people&#39;s minds. <br/>
<br/>
Very sweet. <br/>
<br/>
Syrupy, possibly. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446916846">When Julie gets to visit, she&#39;ll take the waffle makers back to your  <br/>
house.  That was the plan...<br/>
I was afraid snow would keep people from driving to Santa Fe from  <br/>
Colorado (Raton Pass, on I-25, is closed sometimes), but it was snow  <br/>
in London that kept Julie Daniel from being there.  Her plane couldn&#39;t  <br/>
leave.<br/>
