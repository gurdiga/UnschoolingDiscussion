<div id="ygrps-yiv-495307677">Hi Amy and Pris,<br/>
<br/>
This is only my own experience. My 20+ years of experience with my chronic asthma includes 24/7 medication, sometimes steroids (oral and/or inhaled) and a few midnight trips to the ER. How did I go from being terrified of running out of medicines to now not taking any at all? Food allergies. I found that I am super allergic to milk ( I drank 5 glasses a day) and when I stopped milk for good, I was able to taper off my meds. That is of course not the<br/>
answer for everyone. There are many sources of info you and your doctor can research. Food rotation and elimination diets are tough but free and relatively risk free. I thought food allergy was a load of hooey, till I really got into it and discovered alot about what I crave and what makes me ill. They are unfortunately the same things. Very typical of food allergy. If there&#39;s a food you just can&#39;t live without, that&#39;s your prime suspect.<br/>
<br/>
For more info read &quot;Is This Your Child?&quot; by Dr. Doris Rapp, and any other good books you find. Unfortunately skin testing doesn&#39;t always tell the whole story and lots of doctors think food allergies are a bunch of nonsense. You can research, keep food diaries, try elimination and rotation diets and see for yourself. One thing it does take is time/energy/patience. I spent probably 6 months fighting the milk thing till I was free of my attacks, and<br/>
probably another 6 months to taper off my meds. I was on alot of meds and was getting worse till I started getting rid of milk. I was at my wit&#39;s end. The doctor just kept increasing the meds and I just kept feeling worse. I guess that&#39;s when I really decided to give the food allergy research thing a try. I&#39;m so glad I did, it was like sprouting wings. I didn&#39;t have to take lots of meds 24/7 anymore.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it for the asthma reply, I hope you can find some alternatives that can stop the cause of your asthma instead of only treating the symptom. I know asthma is different for everyone and that the triggers can be complicated. I just wanted to share what helped me. Good luck,<br/>

P.S. I still screw up, I still eat dairy sometimes and get sick. It&#39;s a chemical addiction, but that&#39;s a whole other book. Some researchers are finding links between brain chemistry imbalances and food addiction and alcoholism. (Luckily I never drank, but it was a problem in my grandfather&#39;s life) Where certain foods provide soothing chemicals to the brain that for some reason some people&#39;s bodies do not supply on their own. Some have linked the over<br/>
consumption of these foods to obesity and eating disorders. The foods that soothe and balance their brains also make them fatter and sicker and increasingly unable to make the missing chemicals themselves. Maybe for some overeating is just a matter of willpower and exercise, while for others it&#39;s brain chemistry and over consuming foods you don&#39;t really want anyway. Most overweight people I know have tried their whole lives to work hard and lose the<br/>
weight by healthy eating and exercise, feeling miserable about the one part of their lives that is so out of balance and socially condemned. Some of the brain chemicals that are missing are very powerful and your brain will do anything- including getting fatter -to get them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647407724">UGH, SO TRUE!!!  food allergies are often the culprit of asthma flair-ups<br/>
... unfortunately, I&#39;m allergic to everything *airborne* and I also suffer<br/>
from eczema  but thankfully, that&#39;s under control ... I take allergy shots<br/>
twice a week but these don&#39;t help, either ... my ds installed new carpet in<br/>
her house she was completely restoring last fall and w/i hours of visiting I<br/>
ended up in the er w/ a severe asthma attack ... ugh ...  my seasons<br/>
literally run all year long; mountain cedar from Oct - Jan, oak and whatever<br/>
else is blooming during the spring, summer grasses, ack, lets not forget<br/>
about CIG.SMOKE/car fumes/dust/molds/dustmites, too, the list goes on and<br/>
on; cleaning fluids/purfume/cats/dogs/horses/anything w/ dander ... that is<br/>
also so true about drinking LOTS OF WATER!!!  I&#39;m diabetic (juv) and I<br/>
religiously drink 1 gal per day to quinch my thirst but also to stay<br/>
rehydrated!!!<br/>
<br/>
*bummer* but my allergist and pulmonary specialist love me ... &lt;NO LOL&gt;<br/>
Pris ~&gt; now, where&#39;z my inhaler :L<br/>
