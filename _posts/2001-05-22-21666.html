<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182147501">maybe we should pay you a dollar to bang the doctor&#39;s head on the wall?.... sorry if that was rude. Seriously I read the article and was personally offended at the idea of my children being bored at home and needing public school for stimulation.<br/>

  *disclaimer: Kathy, I understand you said you didn&#39;t agree with everything<br/>
  in the article, so I am picking on the good Dr., not you*<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, I just spent the day with a bunch of relatives who said things like,<br/>
  &quot;1st grade is the most important year&quot; and, &quot;We&#39;re going to pay her a dollar<br/>
  a day over the summer if she does a 1/2 hour of writing&quot;, so maybe this<br/>
  article annoyed me more than it usually would have :), but...this man<br/>
  seriously stated that the ages of 3-6 serve the developmental purpose of<br/>
  preparing children for school, that we should make sure our kids are the<br/>
  same SIZE as the other children in their class, and that not sending your<br/>
  kids to school deprives them of the stimualtion they need to mature!  He<br/>
  also assumes that if the kids don&#39;t go to kindergarten, they&#39;ll be in<br/>
  preschool anyway.  I&#39;m going to go bang my head against the wall for a<br/>
  while.  Anybody want to pay me a dollar to do it?  ~Rue<br/>

  I found this article interesting .... though of course I don&#39;t agree or<br/>
  espouse everything that was said.  But, it is interesting to see that even<br/>
  those contemplating sending their children to a traditional school setting<br/>
  are considering the issues of &quot;school readiness&quot; and developmental<br/>
  readiness.<br/>
