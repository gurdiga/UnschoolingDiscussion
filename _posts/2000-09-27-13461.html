<div id="ygrps-yiv-284815705">Help!<br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooler of 3 children (7-1/2, 6 & 3) with one due in March!!  I <br/>
am going through some unbelievable funk about this whole thing right now.  I <br/>
am tempted to throw in the towel and send them off to ps.  Why?  I&#39;m not <br/>
quite sure.<br/>
<br/>
All I know is that I want the best for them and I am questioning if I am <br/>
providing that for them.  I love the freedom of unschooling, but there is <br/>
also something chaotic about it and it is a very difficult concept to <br/>
explain to family & friends.   My kids have been telling people that they do <br/>
nothing for school.  You can guess the reaction by all to that!!<br/>
<br/>
This is my SOS to all of you who know what this like.  I need as much <br/>
support and suggestions as possible.  Since I am the only &quot;unschooler&quot; that <br/>
I know personally, I am in need of the experience and wisdom from all of <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your support and kind words...<br/>
<br/>
Losing it in Illinois,<br/>
Chris<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947739611">Been there, done that!!  As I&#39;m sure many of the list have.  Take a deep<br/>
breath & relax.  Over the summer, just before school was to start, my mil<br/>
hit me pretty hard that dd should be in school.  That really made me start<br/>
questioning what I was teaching her & her brothers.  Then DH took the kids,<br/>
while I attended a seminar, to a historical museum twice & art museum once<br/>
over a two day period.  Later he told me how impressed he was at their<br/>
ability to interact with the staff & tell him things about the exhibits<br/>
before he mentioned them.  DS 4 told him a display was clay, they both<br/>
mentioned the media used for different pictures.  They told him things about<br/>
the prehistoric animals as he was reading to himself.  They&#39;ve picked up so<br/>
much just not exactly what their age level gets in ps.  He was very pleased<br/>
with the new way (unschooling) since he sees the kids having so much fun &<br/>
learning too.  For us that&#39;s right.  My inlaws haven&#39;t mentioned a word<br/>
since ps started without my kids.</div>
