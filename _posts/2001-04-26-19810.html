<div id="ygrps-yiv-849926785">Has anyone heard of this?  The info was sent to me by a local homeschool group list that I&#39;m on.  I am leary about any legislation that gets the schoolies/government more into our life and this seem like an opening for them to jump right in.  I would also like the gov to stop taking so much money, not give it back to me like some gift I&#39;m being rewarded with.  Any comments or has anyone heard of this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346067209">so according to this bill, we would be eligible for a $1000 per qualifying child tax credit for educational expenses incurred in homeschooling our children, including computers and software? How much documentation is required? This bill is in committee right now. Has anyone heard further information? Of course if it is approved as a tax credit, you don&#39;t have to file for it.<br/>
