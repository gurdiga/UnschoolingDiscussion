&lt;&lt; It was entirely hypothetical and rhetorical.  There is no skinhead rally.  <br/>
It <br/>
 was an example. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really can&#39;t see how a child raised the way we&#39;re describing here would <br/>
EVER want to be at an event like that.<br/>
My children love all people with no regards to color or culture. They are <br/>
interested in other cultures, they&#39;ve NEVER been taught that ours is the end <br/>
all be all of countries and that white skin is better than any other.<br/>
That&#39;s like saying the red in the rainbow is the only good color and all the <br/>
others are ugly and awful.<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t make any sense to them. All the rainbows colors are what make it <br/>
beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
People that end up at skin head rallies are either not nurtured and loved at <br/>
home enough or taught the prejudice at home.<br/>
I just can&#39;t see it coming from a loving family that truly respects and <br/>
honors their child.<br/>
We have a couple of neighbor kids that spend almost every day over here.<br/>
I can&#39;t see my children one day saying &quot;I hate Trai and Shay because they&#39;re <br/>
black Mom.&quot; It isn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
And if it did?<br/>
I would NEVER be party to anyone wanting to promote hatred and intolerance.<br/>
Whether they&#39;re my kids are not, I have personal boundaries.<br/>

(Kristen?) had a situation she&#39;s uncomfortable with and posted for help <br/>
without elaborating.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old was &quot;into&quot; the Goth look for a while. Not MY favorite, but I <br/>
didn&#39;t shame or ridicule. I even bought him his own eye-liner and nail <br/>
polish. I secretly HOPED this would be over soon---and it was. I&#39;m guessing <br/>
that, had I treated him as many parents I know would have, he&#39;d STILL be <br/>
doing it. It lasted less than six months (six LONG months! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Most of the &quot;unusual&quot; or &quot;outside the norm/traditional&quot; things he tries are <br/>
short-lived. Experimentation. He&#39;s very up front about it all. No &quot;hiding&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If Kristen would be more specific, maybe we could give better advice.<br/>

I didn&#39;t realize it until I moved to the South, but they&#39;re still going <br/>
strong.<br/>
A bit quieter than in the 30&#39;s since the law is NOT going to support burning <br/>
crosses and such now. Thank goodness.<br/>
When I first moved down to this area, I saw a huge rally being advertised in <br/>
the paper. <br/>
It was all I could do to not turn around and head back North at that <br/>
point....I wanted to stand on the rooftops and scream &quot;What is WRONG with all <br/>
of you?&quot;<br/>
They aren&#39;t a very vocal or loud presence, I haven&#39;t heard anything about <br/>
them since that advertisement five years ago. But I know they&#39;re around, <br/>
skulking and slithering under the rocks from whence they came.<br/>

Trevor does the black nail polish once in a while. I think the fascination is <br/>
already worn off though. I don&#39;t like the look, but I smiled and said <br/>
&quot;whatever you like, it&#39;s YOUR body&quot; and his Dad is extremely protective of <br/>
his kids wearing and looking like whatever they choose.<br/>
Because of that, he knows that he can play with these looks and have a <br/>
supportive environment.<br/>
I feel that ideas are the same. If he wanted to mess around with dangerous <br/>
ideas, he knows he doesn&#39;t have to hide it, he can talk to us AND he values <br/>
our input.<br/>
Kids that get &quot;sucked into&quot; groups or ideas are perhaps over sheltered or <br/>
have been shamed so much they just want to fit in ANYWHERE.<br/>
I don&#39;t have kids that are needy that way.<br/>
They are very sure of who they are, I doubt some pervasive thought or group <br/>
is going to &quot;suck&quot; them anywhere.<br/>

<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>
<p><small><time>16 Apr 2003, at  9:31am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128670248">Kristen, I have been thinking about your question.  With a 24 yo<br/>
son who navigated successfully through the teen years and a true<br/>
devotee of teens, I think that in dealing with peer pressure or a<br/>
desire to do something undesirable to the parents, the key is to<br/>
be specific and concrete - and ready to listen to why you are<br/>
wrong.  That has to build on the relationship and the<br/>
conversations you have already had of course.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 8, my mother told me I could leave any time.  Now sit<br/>
back down and pick up your jaw.  It was the best and most loving<br/>
thing imaginable, because what she told me was that any<br/>
&quot;obedience&quot; was a matter of choice.  At 8 it was quite likely<br/>
that I could manage reasonably well on my own in many ways.  I<br/>
think she was wrong, but she had been told the same thing at 8,<br/>
when perhaps it was accurate.  The point she was making and that<br/>
I took from the conversation to raise our kids has been  that<br/>
listening to parents is a choice that they are free to make or<br/>
not..  That is a bottom line truth you can&#39;t get around, whether<br/>
or not you say so openly.  For me knowing that I was free - and<br/>
telling our kids explicitly that they were free to chose how<br/>
heavily to weigh our opinion is very beneficial honesty.  You<br/>
have to be worth listening to - not hip or permissive or blind,<br/>
but clear headed and reasonable and articulate<br/>
<br/>
For example - with no warranty that any specific discussion was<br/>
had with any particular child, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Drugs and alcohol - perfectly normal and acceptable behavior.<br/>
The drive to intoxication is found even in rats.  Arrest records<br/>
suck; some drugs have serious and immediate consequences for some<br/>
people.  From there it was very easy to get to the place that he<br/>
and his friends were perfectly welcome to drink at our house,<br/>
provided they brought a toothbrush (no DUI&#39;s allowed, that<br/>
endangers others with your choice).  The couple of friends he had<br/>
who would drink to excess if given a chance didn&#39;t get invited<br/>
back for the all night gaming sessions and band jams - they<br/>
tended to throw up or pass out and not be any fun.  Pot similarly<br/>
should not be smoked on the lakeshore in the well known drug<br/>
selling spot.  One is likely to score an arrest.  Come home, but<br/>
preferably smoke it outside; the smell lingers.  Do not use any<br/>
intoxicant often enough that you are in the habit of living in an<br/>
altered state or that your normal state is overly concerned with<br/>
funding intoxication.  Be aware of your sources for illegal<br/>
drugs - remember their interest is in their profits, not your<br/>
pleasure.  They are marketing just as seriously as the Saturday<br/>
morning cartoon advertisers.  If you want something very<br/>
seriously illegal along those line, let me or Dad get it for you;<br/>
we really are more worldly wise as to risks and how tos (2<br/>
lawyers are like that, LOL).<br/>
<br/>
Generally illegal activities - the &quot;malum in se&quot; is &quot;malum&quot;<br/>
whether or not prohibited.  The &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; should<br/>
generally be avoided as a general respect for legitimate<br/>
authority.  Specific cases are open for full exploration.  Thus,<br/>
at 13 I taught him to drive. Not because I was a fan of illegal<br/>
driving, but because we live in the middle of no where.<br/>
Violating the age restriction on driving was balanced with a<br/>
personal safety issue of being able to skeedaddle if needed.<br/>
<br/>
Bad Company/&quot;Losers&quot; - Where you spend your time develops your<br/>
habits and determines a lot of your future.  Don&#39;t use a<br/>
chocolate cake mix hoping for oatmeal cookies.  Investigate<br/>
everything you like, but do not neglect to evaluate what you<br/>
investigated.  The shaved head phase of teenaged-ness only lasted<br/>
one hair cut cycle, thank God.  I never thought he would be a<br/>
skin head at any serious level, but the reaction he got from<br/>
folks who looked at his scalp and jumped to conclusions sealed<br/>
the fate of any such romantic/limited world view.  A corollary to<br/>
that is do not do anything permanent and irremediable until you<br/>
have a chance to step away and evaluate what you have<br/>
investigated.  The first night at the pool hall is not the time<br/>
to have a snake tattooed on your forehead.  You&#39;ll have time<br/>
enough for that and will not be &quot;forbidden&quot; to go back and get<br/>
it, if you still want it.<br/>
<br/>
Sex - Good stuff.  you&#39;re gonna love it.  It&#39;s a decision you<br/>
have to make.  We believe the following and offer the following<br/>
examples as evidence.<br/>
<br/>
and so on - you just have to be very clear in your own mind what<br/>
you believe and why - then don&#39;t lose brand credibility by taking<br/>
untenable positions.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My best friend and I were discussing this last night.  Admittedly, I <br/>
was a bit taken aback by an 8 yr old wearing a bra in public.  BUT, <br/>
once we started talking, I gained a whole new perspective. We (bgf <br/>
and I) went to high school with a girl named Michelle, who dressed <br/>
like a boy and went by the name Mitch in school.  She even used the <br/>
boys restroom, all of it.  Most people didn&#39;t even know she was a <br/>
girl, so I assume the teachers even called her Mitch.  Not sure <br/>
though as I never had a class with her, we just rode the bus to and <br/>
from school together.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we started talking about Michelle and if she were our own <br/>
child, if we would allow her to use a men&#39;s restroom in public.  <br/>
Eventually, we both agreed we would.  (This ended up being about a 2 <br/>
hour conversation.)  I recall seeing a show on Maury Povich about <br/>
transvestites/transsexuals and one mother/son couple really amazed <br/>
me.  The mother completely accepted her son as a woman.  Called her <br/>
by her feminine name and introduced her as her daughter.  It had <br/>
been over 10 years since she had seen her &#39;son&#39; and the purpose of <br/>
the show was for the moms to see their boys again.  She cried like a <br/>
baby when he walked out in a suit.  He was ok with that.  They both <br/>
looked at it like this mother had lost her son, almost like he had <br/>
died and she now had a daughter.  She viewed them as two different <br/>
people.  He knew she accepted him now as a woman but let her grive <br/>
the loss of her son.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, my point is this... I&#39;m NOT suggesting an 8 yr old that <br/>
wears a bra is gay nor wants to be a woman.  BUT, what if in the <br/>
future, he does??  I don&#39;t see how stifling his needs now will ever <br/>
help him, or his relationship with his parents or anyone for that <br/>
matter.  Maybe he simply wants to be like his Mom!  Obviously, he is <br/>
very well grounded and self confident, otherwise he couldnt take the <br/>
flack he gets in public and occasionally from his best pal.  <br/>
<br/>
Our children need to feel love and acceptance from us at every <br/>
moment in their lives.  I would not allow my child to use drugs <br/>
because our golden rule has been, &#39;so long as it doesn&#39;t harm <br/>
yourself or others&#39;.  My brother died from a heroine overdose, it <br/>
was the first time he used it.  My children are very aware of that, <br/>
as Mike only passed away a year ago.  I do struggle with whether or <br/>
not I should allow my 12 year old to dye her beautiful blonde hair <br/>
black and hot pink, but I&#39;m working on it and have not said no, I <br/>
just havent said yes yet!.  I think we all, as parents, have <br/>
our &#39;ideals&#39;, our wishes for our children.  But they are not us.  <br/>
They have to carve their own path and we must follow them with our <br/>
arms and hearts open wide.  Sometimes, it just takes a different <br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to think about.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;Now this I haven&#39;t heard of. I have 2 boys, and I think I am pretty cool<br/>
  with some of the things they have done. Both boys when young tried<br/>
  girl stuff like makeup, barbies, even using balloons to show off a pair<br/>
  of boobs. Glad you are dancing to your own music. I know I would not<br/>
  purchase a bra for my son at any age, nor let him wear it in public.<br/>
  No judgement bashing here from me, I just haven&#39;t heard this one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have to agree with this one also. This made me start to think about things<br/>
  that wouldn&#39;t be okay for my child to do out in public. This would<br/>
  definitely be one of them. Just doesn&#39;t seem the same as colored hair or<br/>
  nail polish. My son had dolls and still does. My girls have boy things to<br/>
  play with also. This just seems way different than that too. Not at all in<br/>

We had a neighbor who came to our house and played dress-up.  Always the <br/>

I used to think he was destined to grow up gay.  He loved Judy Garland and <br/>
The Wizard of Oz. (Stereotype, but some are built on something real! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
After reading about Eddie Izzard now and talking to some other people, maybe <br/>
he just loved costumes and wanted to explore what female stuff was like, and <br/>
think about it without it having ANYTHING to do with sexual preference.<br/>

At the HSC conference they had different MCs each hour for the (three or four <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375159046">Hmm...I think what I have written may be confusing. I mean that some cross dressers are simply people that like to cross dress. Some are gay.<br/>
As your son is comfortable w/ all of this and you&#39;re comfortable - what&#39;s the problem??<br/>
<br/>
As for self defense, I think every child should be able to defend him/her self. That&#39;s common sense in this world.<br/>

Good luck w/ him.<br/>

Sorry your feelings are hurt just because someone doesn&#39;t understand. It&#39;s<br/>
not the group. You&#39;ve had what, a whole two people not get it? Youve&#39; had<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Basically, my point is this... I&#39;m NOT suggesting an 8 yr old that<br/>
wears a bra is gay nor wants to be a woman.  BUT, what if in the<br/>
future, he does??  I don&#39;t see how stifling his needs now will ever<br/>
help him, or his relationship with his parents or anyone for that<br/>
matter.  Maybe he simply wants to be like his Mom!  Obviously, he is<br/>
very well grounded and self confident, otherwise he couldnt take the<br/>
flack he gets in public and occasionally from his best pal. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with people being different in sexual preference or gender<br/>
differences. I would support my children in any and all of these. Some<br/>
people do know at a very young age that they are different in those ways,<br/>
some don&#39;t until they get older. That&#39;s a matter of a different lifestyle<br/>
too. Not just putting on a dress and going out. It entails much more than<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to really talk about it more because it&#39;s someone here who has a<br/>
child doing what we are talking about. I don&#39;t want her to feel wrong in a<br/>
decision that she feels right about. I also don&#39;t wnt her thinking I&#39;m<br/>
judging her.<br/>
<br/>
I was simply saying I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with that. And I&#39;m not so sure<br/>
that those who say great no problem would actually be comfortable with it<br/>
either if it was their child. It&#39;s easy to be real supportive in e-mails<br/>
just likes it&#39;s easier to disagree and argue with someone not really there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054898580">I have watched many shows on this, the most recient one on the Discovery channel. They were talking about how hard these people have it and why on earth these people would put themselves through these things if they didn&#39;t feel they needed to do it.Also they have just reciently done research on self-identified Transgender and {being somewhat brief because I&#39;m no expert} there is a certin look - under the microscope- to a male&#39;s brain and a female&#39;s brain. Well of the very few they have done there is still dramatic evidence that in an transgender their brains show the opposite sex features rather then their own. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://content.gay.com/people/trans_gazebo/tg_research_000814.htmlJust">http://content.gay.com/people/trans_gazebo/tg_research_000814.htmlJust</a> some food for thought.Tracy   <br/>
  &lt;&lt;I recall seeing a show on Maury Povich about <br/>
  transvestites/transsexuals and one mother/son couple really amazed <br/>
  me.  The mother completely accepted her son as a woman.  Called her <br/>
  by her feminine name and introduced her as her daughter.  It had <br/>
  been over 10 years since she had seen her &#39;son&#39; and the purpose of <br/>
  the show was for the moms to see their boys again.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

down.  As you well know, it is easy to feel like you are being <br/>
attacked for your feelings, beliefs, words, etc.  Correct me, <br/>
please, if I am wrong, but your post sounds quite sarcastic towards <br/>
her for simply stating her feelings were hurt.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the key is to realize we don&#39;t ALL have the same beliefs, <br/>
feelings or thoughts and some things are going to rub us the wrong <br/>
way, you know?  The best thing we can do is honestly portray our <br/>
feelings and needs and let those go who simply don&#39;t get it.  What <br/>
else can we do?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009565337">And I&#39;m not so sure<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that those who say great no problem would actually be comfortable <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; either if it was their child. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not so sure they wouldn&#39;t!  Yesterday, I would have had a <br/>
problem with it.  But, as I said, last night, I gained a new <br/>
perspective.  Just because we allow our children to do or not do <br/>
certain things, doesn&#39;t always mean it makes us comfortable!  It <br/>
drives me nuts that my daughter wants to wear black pants and a long <br/>
sleeve black shirt outside when it&#39;s 90 degrees.  *I* want her to <br/>
wear shorts because that it what *I* find comfortable.  She&#39;s not <br/>
me.  *She* may not even be comfortable, physically, but to her, the <br/>
*look* is what matters right now.  So that&#39;s what we go with.  <br/>
<br/>
If we are truly on the path of following our children&#39;s leads, of <br/>
allowing them to follow their *own* leads, find what&#39;s right for <br/>
THEM, then we can&#39;t smother them with what makes us &#39;comfortable&#39;.  <br/>
That is our own issue, not theirs.  I was simply trying to offer an <br/>
example of a situation to let your mind wander somewhere that <br/>
perhaps it had not.  Offering a new perspective.  I wasn&#39;t implying <br/>
that you had to agree with it.  Nor am I trying to force you to feel <br/>
comfortable with it.  That is a decision you have to make for <br/>
yourself.  Isn&#39;t that the point of this list?  To obtain <br/>
information?  To find another way?  I&#39;m not asking for anyone to do <br/>
it my way, I&#39;m just offering my thoughts for you to take and run <br/>
with or delete and forget.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
