First, Christine, there are discussions in the discussion area at <br/>
www.unschooling.com about convincing husbands, and there might be something there that <br/>
would help.<br/>
<br/>
And Denzel Washington, in Crimson Tide, is WONDERFUL.  And his best buddy in <br/>
the story is played by Viggo Mortensen (lately more famous as Aragorn), who <br/>
plays his whole part doing nothing more physical than ironing his uniform.  Very <br/>
still acting.  Much eye flash and face twitch, and for those who like <br/>
military cleanface and short hair better than long hair and beard (which always <br/>
baffles ME, but hey, I like Robin Williams for having hair EVERYWHERE and for being <br/>
brilliant secondarily &lt;g&gt;), then that&#39;s a good Viggo role.  He&#39;s usually <br/>
hairier.<br/>
