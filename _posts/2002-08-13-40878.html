<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349614713">Hi! It&#39;s the new kid again!  I was wondering if any of you subscribe <br/>
to scienceathome magazine.  It was previewed and reccommended in HEM.<br/>
The available website given in the issue doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>
www.scienceathome.com<br/>
Do you know anything about it?  Address?  Is it worth it?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Was the money worth the magazine?  Do you happen to have an old <br/>
address laying around?<br/>
thanks<br/>

Hi TIna,<br/>
I would say to #1, not here. (If the kids had requested to renew then I<br/>
would say Yes. I thought it was very cool but I love &quot;science&quot;.<br/>
I don&#39;t have an address since we just moved and brought nothing extra to our<br/>
1 1/2 bedroom apartment!<br/>
I bet if you google it, you&#39;ll find one!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have no idea how expensive this magazine is, since I have never seen it.<br/>
However, we&#39;ve enjoyed Click, and now it&#39;s older brother, Ask, both from<br/>
Cricket Magazine Group.  They&#39;re among my son&#39;s favorite magazines,<br/>
evidenced by the ever-growing pile of them he can&#39;t possibly give up.  All<br/>
of Cricket Mag. Group&#39;s magazines run about $35/year, I think, but we have<br/>
the grandparents handling the subscription, and they renew it for Christmas<br/>
each year. <br/>

Elissa,<br/>
Thanks again.  I&#39;ll try some search engines.  My two like science but <br/>
I am sick of trying new stuff and wasting the money.  <br/>

Nice to meet ya!  I&#39;ve heard of those magazines and I do believe my <br/>
library carries them.  That always saves money but of course you <br/>
either have to photocopy stuff or make do without.  I&#39;ll see if I can <br/>
try a copy at the library.<br/>
