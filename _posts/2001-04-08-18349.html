That must have been embarrasing, Sandra!  <br/>
<br/>
My almost 5 year old dd was bitten by my very own dog I had for eight years <br/>
before, when she was almost 1 year old.  Right in the face.  It immediately <br/>
got infected, and we spent three long, scary, miserable days in the hospital. <br/>
 I got rid of my dog soon after that.  I loved him, but she came first.  And <br/>
I had always been very careful with them both.  She just got too close to his <br/>
food while crawling, and it took one second to happen.  I also was bitten by <br/>
a dog on the leg when I was ten.  I&#39;ve adopted that &quot;don&#39;t run, but stand <br/>
there and hold your ground over any animal&quot; philosophy and attitude when <br/>
faced in an outside animal situation.  I feel that balanced animal safety, as <br/>
well as balanced people safety are very smart things to teach our kids. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, there are dog bites due to aggression issues, and dog bites due to<br/>
fear issues. This guy isn&#39;t at all aggressive or vicious - that would be<br/>
a different story - he&#39;s just gets triggered and bites out of fear, and a<br/>
second later he remembers where he is and feels quite bad and slinks<br/>
outside. I used to teach kids with emotional disabilities, and this dog<br/>
reminds me of a lot of those kids.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie has always been pretty good at relating to kids like this, too.<br/>
<br/>
Putting him in another room when we come over would be kind of hard,<br/>
since we&#39;re living in their guest house. He has become a floor dog<br/>
instead of a couch dog for now, though. <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t know how &quot;evolved&quot; Cacie is, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what it&#39;s<br/>
about. She said she still likes him but not as much as she did before,<br/>
which is understandable.  She is still angry at him for doing this, even<br/>
though I think she understands why he did it. It has tied in really well<br/>
with our recent discussions on people doing what they think is right and<br/>
good, but what is really wrong and bad. She puts both Judas and the WTC<br/>
terrorists in that same category...<br/>
