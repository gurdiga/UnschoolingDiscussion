<div id="ygrps-yiv-940441001">I like screenit.com (or is it screen-it.com) for detailed movie reviews.  It<br/>
explains exactly what each incident is that would be considered violent,<br/>
sexual, scary, etc.  Then the parent is able to decide if that particular<br/>
thing might be a concern for their own child, rather than going on general<br/>
descriptions of a movie that is &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;lots of sex&quot;.<br/>

I was told the first Lord of the Rings was incredibly violent and we missed<br/>
our chance to see it on the big screen ~ I watched the video and kicked<br/>
myself!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127672874">I wouldn&#39;t let my kids see Lord of the Rings (after<br/>
seeing it myself) because I thought it was just too<br/>
intense.  After reading this list for awhile, I<br/>
reconsidered and last week we got the video out.  They<br/>
LOVED it!  My eight year old said:  &quot;Mommy, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
scary at all because I know that&#39;s not something that<br/>
would ever happen to me.  It&#39;s not like real life.&quot;<br/>
They are at this moment watching it again.  My 11 year<br/>
old went out and bought the book and is half way<br/>
through it--certainly something I was never able to<br/>
read myself!<br/>
