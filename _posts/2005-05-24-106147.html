&gt; What makes that &quot;the reality&quot;?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Why 18?  You could stop supporting him sooner.  You<br/>
&gt; could stop  supporting <br/>
&gt; him now.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; What magical thing will happen at 18?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was expected to support myself at 18 (with much less<br/>
guidance than he will receive from me), and his 18th<br/>
birthday is the limits of the total support I can<br/>
offer him as I have not yet earned great amounts of<br/>
money, although I will continue to be able to offer<br/>
him partial support beyond 18. I took a cut in income<br/>
in order to homeschool him, closed a daycare, arranged<br/>
part-time work which works, but when he is 18 or<br/>
thereabouts I will need to work full time again. so,<br/>
if he still lives with me he will need to contribute<br/>
to the whole household as an adult at that point.<br/>
obviously this will not be a sudden transition, but a<br/>
gradual one, I expect.<br/>
