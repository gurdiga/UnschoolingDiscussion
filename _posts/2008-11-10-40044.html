<br/>
Why would a person not follow her principles?   The result of not  <br/>
following ones principles is cognitive dissonance, or other discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
When someone believes a thing is right, but does something different,  <br/>
she will have natural feelings of discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with the fascinated but unschooling- <br/>
rejecting correspondent.  Maybe it seems right, but she doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
to do it.  This was just discussed on this list a day or two ago,  <br/>
about why people wouldn&#39;t unschool, if they really understood it.)<br/>
<br/>
Principles are not rules by another name. People have claimed that,  <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t make sense.  If someone breaks a rule, there can be a  <br/>
punishment or they get a citation or they lose a job or their check  <br/>
bounces, or whatever.    If someone violates a principle, that&#39;s in  <br/>
the realm of belief and feeling.<br/>
