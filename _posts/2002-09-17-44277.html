&gt;<br/>
&gt; WHY?<br/>
&gt; What state are you in?  Who needs to &quot;approve&quot; your keeping your son in an<br/>
&gt; environment which is good for him?<br/>
<br/>

parents rights to raise and educate their children. And if you are poor or<br/>
disabled or in anyway less than &quot;perfect&quot; parents (I am both poor and<br/>
disabled) they will come and take your kids and give them to someone who<br/>
will turn them into non feeling zombies.<br/>

But I have about three more weeks until I have their blessings. I hate it.<br/>
It makes me ill. It hurts inside to know that I am sending my child to a<br/>
place I know is not good for him but I don&#39;t want to lose him and I have no<br/>
idea, short of Maria&#39;s posts about GA, what other states are like, but here<br/>
DSS and the schools have absolute power. You have to go by their rule. You<br/>
know what they say... &quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Welcome to the list!<br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Sandra. And you are right, school is his only problem. I can&#39;t run<br/>
but tickle fights work wonders when a kid is too wound up to sit in a chair.<br/>
Take care.<br/>
<br/>
Brightest Blessings,<br/>

I just wanted to flag this and repeat this.  I think it is clear, from<br/>
actions of &quot;the state&quot; in Vermont and in California that single moms,<br/>
disabled moms, and parents with non-mainstream religious beliefs are the<br/>
most likely people to face a major challenge to their homeschooling.  I<br/>
think it&#39;s important that all homeschoolers close ranks and defend each<br/>
other&#39;s rights.<br/>
<br/>
I like that quote from the American Revolution &quot;I we do not hang<br/>
together, we shall assuredly all hang separately.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I think it&#39;s B. Franklin.)<br/>
