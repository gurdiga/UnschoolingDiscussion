 A Conversation Between Friends<br/>
 We are sitting at lunch when my friend casually mentions that she<br/>
 and her husband are thinking of &quot;starting a family&quot;. &quot;We&#39;re taking a<br/>
 survey,&quot; she says, half-joking. &quot;Do you think I should have a baby?&quot; &quot;It<br/>
 will change your life,&quot; I say, carefully keeping my tone neutral.  &quot;I know,&quot;<br/>
 she says, &quot;no more sleeping in on weekends, no more spontaneous <br/>
vacations....&quot;<br/>
 But that is not what I meant at all. I look at my friend, trying to decide<br/>
 what to tell her. I want her to know what she will never learn in childbirth<br/>
 classes.  I want to tell her that the physical wounds of child bearing will<br/>
 heal, but that becoming a mother will leave her with an emotional wound<br/>
 so raw that she will forever be vulnerable.<br/>
 I consider warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without<br/>
 asking &quot;What if that had been MY child?&quot; That every plane crash, every<br/>
 house fire will haunt her. That when she sees pictures of starving<br/>
 children, she will wonder if anything could be worse than watching your<br/>
 child die. I look at her carefully manicured nails and stylish suit and think<br/>
 that no matter how sophisticated she is, becoming a mother will reduce her to<br/>
 the primitive level of a bear protecting her cub. That an urgent call of <br/>
 &quot;Mom!&quot;<br/>
 will cause her to drop a souffle or her best crystal without a moment&#39;s <br/>
 hesitation.<br/>
 I feel I should warn her that no matter how many years she has invested in<br/>
 her career, she will be professionally derailed by motherhood.  She might<br/>
 arrange for childcare, but one day she will be going into an important<br/>
 business meeting and she will think of her baby&#39;s sweet smell.  She will<br/>
 have to use every ounce of her discipline to keep from running home, just<br/>
 to make sure her baby is all right.<br/>
 I want my friend to know that everyday decisions will no longer be routine.  <br/>
 That a five-year-old boy&#39;s desire to go to the men&#39;s room rather than the <br/>
 women&#39;s at McDonald&#39;s will become a major dilemma. That right there, in the <br/>
 midst of clattering trays and screaming children, issues of independence and <br/>
 gender identity will be weighed against the prospect that a child molester <br/>
 may be lurking in that restroom.  However decisive she may be at the office, <br/>
 she will second-guess herself constantly as a mother.<br/>
 Looking at my attractive friend, I want to assure her that eventually she<br/>
 will shed the pounds of pregnancy, but she will never feel the same about<br/>
 herself. That her life, now so important, will be of less value to her once<br/>
 she has a child. That she would give it up in a moment to save her <br/>
offspring, <br/>
 but will also begin to hope for more years -- not to accomplish her own <br/>
 dreams, but to watch her child accomplish theirs.  I want her to know that a <br/>
 cesarean scar or shiny stretch marks will become badges of honor.<br/>
 My friend&#39;s relationship with her husband will change, but not in the way <br/>
she <br/>
 thinks. I wish she could understand how much more you can love a man who is <br/>
 careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to play with his child. I <br/>
 think she should know that she will fall in love with him again for reasons <br/>
 she would now find very unromantic.<br/>
 I wish my friend could sense the bond she will feel with women throughout <br/>
 history who have tried to stop war, prejudice and drunk driving. I hope she <br/>
 will understand why I can think rationally about most issues, but become <br/>
 temporarily insane when I discuss the threat of nuclear war to my children&#39;s<br/>
 future.<br/>
  I want to describe to my friend the exhilaration of seeing your child learn <br/>
 to ride a bike.  I want to capture for her the belly laugh of a baby who is <br/>
 touching the soft fur of a dog or a cat for the first time.  I want her to <br/>
 taste the joy that is so real, it actually hurts.<br/>
 My friend&#39;s quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my <br/>
 eyes. &quot;You&#39;ll never regret it,&quot; I finally say. Then I reached across the <br/>
 table, squeezed my friend&#39;s hand and offer a silent prayer for her, and for <br/>
 me, and for all of the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this <br/>
most <br/>
 wonderful of callings. The blessed gift of God and that of being a Mother.<br/>
