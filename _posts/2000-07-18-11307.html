Just another thought, I have a mother&#39;s helper who comes twice a week, she&#39;s <br/>
15 years old and plays with the kids while I work or clean up or cook dinner <br/>
or whatever.  She is great with them and they love her.  This could be <br/>
another way to go.  I actually pay her $4 an hour which my best friend says <br/>
is too much, but I want to keep her and know that she&#39;ll be there when I need <br/>
her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160419658">yeah, i&#39;ve been thinking about this.  i think they&#39;d do more for a <br/>
helper than for me, sad isn&#39;t it.  but i mentioned it to dh tongiht and <br/>
he said that they didn&#39;t do too bad last night.  as if i was <br/>
challenging his domain or something....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245485865">Didn&#39;t we just finish talking about this? I guess it&#39;s a subject that never <br/>
goes away!<br/>
<br/>
I still think the basic problem is too much stuff! Stash half of those toys <br/>
in boxes in the garage and see how long before anyone asks for them!<br/>
<br/>
My secret weapon, though, is that every two weeks I have a team of <br/>
housekeepers in. Yes, I hire housekeepers. I could pay a sitter and clean <br/>
the house myself, but I personally loathe cleaning, so I&#39;d rather pay the <br/>
housekeepers and take the kids to the park. Admittedly, this costs money, <br/>
but we think it&#39;s worth it. This way we know that the basics -- bathroom, <br/>
clean sheets, kitchen -- get done every two weeks (yes, our standards are <br/>
rock-bottom!) and also, the night before they come, we all pitch in and <br/>
organize the clutter. The cry is, &quot;put your stuff away or the &#39;ladies&#39; will <br/>
and then you&#39;ll never find it!&quot;<br/>
