&gt;For some reason I was reminded of that case where the ex-wife killed her <br/>
&gt;ex-husband and his new wife.  Bamberek or something like that.  Tapes of her <br/>
&gt;phone calls and phone messages were used in court against her.<br/>

house that she built with her ex.  She also escaped for a time, and was<br/>
recaptured in Canada where she was working as a waitress.  There were a lot<br/>
of holes in the prosecution&#39;s case, however, and she is still making<br/>
appeals.  There was a lot of public sentiment behind her among those who<br/>
were following the trial.  There are also a lot of questions surrounding<br/>
the fact that her ex was a former police officer and there was something<br/>
(bad) going on between him and his former colleagues.  Also the gun that<br/>
was in her possesion and was entered into evidence as the murder weapon was<br/>
not the same type of gun that killed her ex.  Lots of unanswered questions<br/>
there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think mostly due to the fact that the prosecution&#39;s case had so many<br/>
holes in it, and it seemed like their key witnesses were the very people<br/>
who ought to be additional suspects.  Also, they did not look at any other<br/>
suspects at all, regardless of the poor case against her, they just ran<br/>
with her &quot;assumed&quot; guilt, which smacks of being contrary to our justice<br/>
system&#39;s theory of &quot;Innocent until proven Guilty.&quot;  Does anyone remember<br/>
the headlines (and the song they were playing on the radio) when she<br/>
escaped from Prison  &quot;Run, Bambi, Run!&quot;  ??<br/>

Hey, just jumping in here, but there was another case, sounds just like this, <br/>
the woman was convicted and is in jail, they made a movie about it.  So maybe <br/>
these two are being confused?<br/>

I just watched a show about this case.  Unless I totaly misunderstood I <br/>
thought she was acquitted and released not too long ago.  She never admitted <br/>
guilt and even the law enforcement people interviewed believe she was falsely <br/>
convicted and railroaded by a &quot;good ole boy&quot; system.  She had been a cop at <br/>
one time and filed discrimination charges.  She had to quit due to the <br/>
harassment she got after that.  It wasn&#39;t a big stretch that she wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
fair treatment once she was accussed of the murder.  The show did an outline <br/>
of the evidence and it was really clear that they didn&#39;t have a case.  The <br/>
mark left on the body from the gun barrel wasn&#39;t even close to the size of <br/>
the one they say she used to kill her husband&#39;s ex.  There were a lot of <br/>
other details but even if she DID do it they certainly didn&#39;t have the <br/>
evidence to convict.<br/>

interview from the prison) and she seemed pretty self-centered and <br/>
unremorseful.  (I can&#39;t remember the name, though.)<br/>

Lauri Bembenek also was convicted, so I heard a lot about this case...but not <br/>
for awhile.  <br/>
After her much publicized run to Canada (yes, I remember the song!), &quot;Bambi&quot; <br/>
did have her sentence reduced to either manslaughter or Murder II (I can&#39;t <br/>
remember which) and was released from jail because of time served.  She has <br/>
been out of jail for several years now, and is currently living in Washington <br/>
state, according to my dh, who read an article about her several months ago.<br/>
She has never admitted her guilt.<br/>
