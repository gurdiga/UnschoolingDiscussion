 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re in Columbia, South Carolina. <br/>
<br/>
It IS scary at first. <br/>
<br/>
After you have deschooled yourSELF, *then* it&#39;s freeing. Until then, you&#39;re <br/>
still just bound up in that school/society brainwashing.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not a better way to GET to that point than to attend a conference. <br/>
There you can see unschoolers and their parents, hear inspring speakers, and ask <br/>
dozens of questions. You come away with a whole new outlook on learning and <br/>
children and unschooling. It&#39;s life changing! <br/>
<br/>
Trust me!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t trust me---ask others! Or go to the website and read the testimonials!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy it? Almost guaranteed! It&#39;s a lot of fun--even if you refuse to learn <br/>
anything about unschooling! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you (and your friend) then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476944676">Hi. I&#39;m from the Atlanta area as well and am so glad to see someone else from round here.   I don&#39;t know anyone locally who is unschooling.  I am also bringing a friend to the conference who is not an unschooler.  At first I hoped she would be persuaded by what she sees and hears at the conference but I am realizing that she wants to do more of an eclectic method with some curriculum everyday.  And it is O.K.  She and I both still think she will get a lot out of the conference.  I am thinking it might be a good thing to have stored in her brain for if the curriculum isn&#39;t working in the future.  How long have you been unschooling?  I just started a few months ago but am completely convinced.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi. I&#39;m from the Atlanta area as well and am so glad to see someone else <br/>
&gt; from round here.   I don&#39;t know anyone locally who is unschooling.  I am also <br/>
&gt; bringing a friend to the conference who is not an unschooler.  At first I <br/>
&gt; hoped she would be persuaded by what she sees and hears at the conference but I <br/>
&gt; am realizing that she wants to do more of an eclectic method with some <br/>
&gt; curriculum everyday.  And it is O.K.  She and I both still think she will get a lot <br/>
&gt; out of the conference.  I am thinking it might be a good thing to have stored <br/>
&gt; in her brain for if the curriculum isn&#39;t working in the future.  How long <br/>
&gt; have you been unschooling?  I just started a few months ago but am completely <br/>
&gt; convinced.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are quite a few coming from the Atlanta area. I&#39;ll be sure to introduce <br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
This year we&#39;ll have your hometown and state on the nametags so that you can <br/>
find others from your neck of the woods. HUGE crowd from North Carolina last <br/>
year. And more than one from California *this* year!!!<br/>
<br/>
As for the &quot;c-word&quot; users: even if they insist on using a curriculum after <br/>
attending the conference---their eyes will be opened to how children learn and <br/>
what joy there is to be found in learning withOUT coersion. So maybe their <br/>
children&#39;s lives will be just a little more joyful and a little less <br/>
school-oriented. It&#39;ll be good for them! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

outside the box.  Even if unschooling isn&#39;t what they are leaning towards it <br/>
lets people know that there is an alternative.  There are so many people out <br/>
there that have no clue about unschooling.  All they know is the &quot;school at home&quot; <br/>
model that seems to be everywhere and marketed so well.  <br/>
<br/>
I spoke with a group of new homeschoolers last night and, even though I <br/>
believe none will be unschooling, I think just hearing me speaking alongside <br/>
someone who is curriculum oriented made them think a little and there were some good <br/>
questions asked.  I believe it just helped them to see someone who has a <br/>
different perspective.  Maybe started them thinking.<br/>
