<div id="ygrps-yiv-144246981">&quot; He came downstairs, ate one and then made<br/>
a big glass of ovaltine with fresh goat milk.  Go figure.  I will continue<br/>
along this pleasant vein and see where it goes.&quot;<br/>

Sounds nice. I think you&#39;re definitely on the right track here!  I understand about the wastefulness issue..it bugs the heck out of my dh. But our response is if you are done with something, please offer it to someone else or save it for later. They don&#39;t throw any food away without checking to see if I&#39;d like to save or eat it first. Problem solved. No pressure to finish what you eat. I have worked with Sierra to encourage her to take multiple small portions rather than one whopping portion she can&#39;t finish...but it&#39;s the same idea. It&#39;s your food, and you eat what you want of the item.<br/>
<br/>
On the same note, my 10y.o. Jared weighs around 60 lbs. and is 56.5 inches tall. Very similar to your ds. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unhealthy...it&#39;s genetic. People in third world countries survive (yes, malnutritioned of course) on much less than the carbs your ds is getting. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s getting more nutrition than you think. With kids, it&#39;s a good idea to look at the whole week, not a single day.<br/>
<br/>
Jared is super thing, his veins stick out (but then so do mine, and I&#39;m NOT overly thin) is very pale and not so physically gifted at this point. He is drawn to the simple carbs most of the time, but when we gave him 100% freedom without the worry and pressure, he became SO much better at listening to his body.<br/>
Last week we were all having pizza for dinner and Jared didn&#39;t want any (ACK!), he was craving vegetables. He asked me to cut up an apple and cook some carrots or broccoli for him instead. I happily obliged but couldn&#39;t resist asking him if he&#39;d like some pizza now. NO. He needed veggies and fruit. I&#39;ve NEVER known a kid that would turn down pizza for veggies!! Blew my mind, even after years of freedom it&#39;s shocking what kids will do when they are in control of their own choices.<br/>
We also went out to Olive garden this week, where Jared ordered salad and breadsticks and turned down both chicken fingers and pizza. Wow. I actually WANTED him to eat something higher fat/protein content, but I do trust him to listen to his body.<br/>
He&#39;s fine, your ds is fine. Just keep on trusting and making those yummy snacks available.<br/>
