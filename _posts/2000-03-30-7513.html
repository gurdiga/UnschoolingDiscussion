<h4>The White&#39;s</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379179934">Hi all,<br/>
Again I am behind on reading of my digests, maybe I should unsubscribe to a<br/>
couple...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wanted to say that when my son was 5, almost 6 he learned to read<br/>
relatively quickly and easily.  I used Ruth Beechick&#39;s A Home Start in<br/>
Reading (one of her 3 easy books) and the Bob books.  I began with his name<br/>
and introduced letter sounds from his name, then other words.  A few days<br/>
later he read the 1st Bob book.  He liked feeling masterful of reading as he<br/>
was able to read a whole book by himself, all the way through.  He would<br/>
read 1-3 Bob Books a day from the 1st set (blue box).<br/>
<br/>
He read a book a day in the 2nd set (red box) and began reading other things<br/>
like Mercer Mayer&#39;s Little Critter Books, etc.  By the time we got to the<br/>
3rd set (yellow box) we never finished.<br/>
<br/>
Once he began reading confidently I began finding &quot;real&quot; books for him to<br/>
read (about 4-5 weeks later).  No more &quot;phonics&quot; and never any controlled<br/>
readers.  He was so excited about reading for himself it was easy to keep<br/>
him excited because he loves &quot;real&quot; books.  He&#39;s now 7 & is reading 3rd-4th<br/>
grade level.  I know that the most important thing by far is for the child<br/>
to be ready.  Mine was or I would have waited.  If he had trouble or fussed<br/>
at the task we would have stopped and waited.  But the timing was right for<br/>
him & the Bob Books were a great kick-off! I would recommend them to anyone<br/>
whose wants to try a relaxed approach to learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the easy readers he liked were Geoffrey Hayes books (Otto & Uncle<br/>
Tooth Adventures) like The Secret of Foghorn Island--I think there are only<br/>
4 of these.  He liked the Mr. Putter & Tabby books and Henry and Mudge.  Now<br/>
if my youngest wakes from her nap before we are finished with a chapter in<br/>
the Hobbit, or Harry Potter, he picks up the book & continues on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck & enjoy the Bob books!<br/>
