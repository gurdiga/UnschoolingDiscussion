<div id="ygrps-yiv-13003806">I am a crafty person myself.  But I like practical<br/>
crafts.  I don&#39;t like crafts that create a &quot;something&quot;<br/>
which is then just a piece of garbage or kitchy piece<br/>
of brick-a-brack.  I like crafts like knitting,<br/>
crochet, scrapbooking (which very practically uses the<br/>
pictures that are hiding in boxes in the closet),<br/>
woodworking and others of that nature.  Most of the<br/>
crafts in all the kids&#39; craft sites/books and other<br/>
sources create useless garbage mostly.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s a good thing that I feel that way,<br/>
because my kids hate crafts.  They love to cut and<br/>
paste, paint and play with modeling dough and other<br/>
things, but they HATE crafts.  They don&#39;t want to<br/>
follow steps of make any cute little napkin holder or<br/>
decorated pencil jar or something.  If they feel<br/>
&quot;crafty&quot; I always just let them have free reign with<br/>
the craft supplies.  If I am making gifts for others<br/>
for some occassion, I just make them, and the kids can<br/>
lend a hand at some point in the process if they feel<br/>
like it, or not.<br/>
<br/>
My older boy is a perfectionist too and very hard on<br/>
himself.  He has the I-CAN&#39;T&#39;s a lot too, usually<br/>
realted to things that he thinks he cannot do to his<br/>
exacting standards yet or when he is tired or<br/>
impatient.  I know he is independent enough to<br/>
eventually find that *WE* don&#39;t do things to meet his<br/>
exacting standards and to begin insisting on doing it<br/>
all himself.  He already does that about some things. <br/>
So I am not worried about it.<br/>
