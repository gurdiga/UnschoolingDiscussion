<div id="ygrps-yiv-718670919"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have a problem with the neighbor girl.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have really enjoyed this discussion, first because the responses have been <br/>
realistic and not mean-spirited but sensitive, and second because I have <br/>
neighbor-kid problems in my neighborhood too -- kids that turn up <br/>
constantly, are too old for our kids, have to be told to go home at dinner, <br/>
wait in the driveway while we eat... aarrgh! And furthermore, of course, you <br/>
never see a parent. Not that you&#39;d probably want to.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my main rule is that kids I don&#39;t like can&#39;t come in the house. My <br/>
excuse is, &quot;I just cleaned,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m getting ready to clean.&quot; Second, if <br/>
anyone gets hurt, I just start telling the visitor (regretfully, as someone <br/>
already suggested) that they are too old to play with my kids. It can take a <br/>
dozen times of saying this, as apologetically as possible, before they give <br/>
up and quit coming over. If you are kind about it, I think they take you at <br/>
your word and don&#39;t get their feelings hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I hold my kids responsible for their own behavior. If they get in <br/>
trouble by &quot;following the crowd,&quot; then there are consequences. The fact that <br/>
other people act like idiots is no excuse for them to do so. I think you can <br/>
tell them, &quot;Yes, I know Johnny&#39;s family lets him wander the neighborhood <br/>
alone, curse and play Nintendo all day. I&#39;m sorry but in our family, we <br/>
don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, it works. I signed my ds up for a karate class when he <br/>
was 6. I soon discovered that many people consider karate to be a form of <br/>
therapy for little boys with discipline problems. I was worried my ds would <br/>
get nothing out of the class, or worse, be corrupted. I was wrong. He was <br/>
attentive despite the occasional ruckus around him and got a lot out of the <br/>
class.<br/>
