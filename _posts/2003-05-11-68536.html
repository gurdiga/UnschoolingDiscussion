<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please send good thoughts my way - I can&#39;t find dh&#39;s passport, and<br/>
&gt; Jayn&#39;s birth certificate, although my &quot;papers&quot; are where I thought I<br/>
&gt; left them. I remember deciding months ago to take them out of the<br/>
&gt; stationery storage box and put them ????? for safe keeping..but what did<br/>
&gt; I then do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll send you good thoughts for finding things, but if it&#39;s any reassurance,<br/>
$50 will get your dh a new passport and probably about $10 will replace the<br/>
birth certificate from the registrar of birth&#39;s office.<br/>
<br/>
I try to think of how easy to replace things are that I lose, because then I<br/>
relax and find them.  It&#39;s like they&#39;re laughing at me that I DO care, and<br/>
when I don&#39;t care, they get offended and jump up in sight again! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
How true is THAT!  I lost my Visa a few weeks ago and finally gave up and <br/>
figured I&#39;d find it some day.  (Knew it was in the house, taken by little <br/>
sticky fingers. &lt;g&gt;)  I lost my money a couple of days ago.  Yesterday, my <br/>
grandfather brought me $300 to replace it in the meantime and guess what?  <br/>
Found it!  Oh and found the visa card while looking for the money last <br/>
night.  Odd.<br/>
