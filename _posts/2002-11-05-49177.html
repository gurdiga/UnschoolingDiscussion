<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989329906">If we are raising our children to be life long learners filled<br/>
with curiosity about and joy in  the world, shouldn&#39;t we be able<br/>
to engage in discussions about topics without labeling those who<br/>
disagree with tags that are derogatory, ad hominen, and<br/>
essentially free of factual content?<br/>
<br/>
Folks who claim to &quot;know&quot; better things about abortion than the<br/>
sites that have been represented - bring on your facts, don&#39;t<br/>
just drop hints that facts exist - abandon your name calling.<br/>
People who are sure about the demerits of those who view the<br/>
history of the world in one way, can you come up with something<br/>
to support your claims, other than un-referenced statements that<br/>
confuse passion with probity?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t much care what conclusion folks (in a generic sense) come<br/>
to about topics of religion or morals; salvation is sorted out at<br/>
a higher pay grade than mine.  It does trouble me that as<br/>
proponents of the right and duty of parents to nurture our<br/>
children, we can&#39;t get past childish name calling on topics that<br/>
are certainly worthy of discernment and debate.</div>
