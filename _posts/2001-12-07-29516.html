<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165422672">&lt;&lt;your take on the ending&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw Gabriel as a symbol of Jonas&#39; soul, his humanity, his self.  Jonas had<br/>
been separated from his trueness by the utopian culture and had to struggle<br/>
through the journey to return to himself.  What allowed him to complete the<br/>
difficult journey was the leap of faith (jumping on the sled) that he<br/>
already at some level knew would be required.<br/>
<br/>
By loving his soul, struggling through the pain, having faith, he was able<br/>
to become whole again.<br/>
<br/>
What was y&#39;all&#39;s take?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132227759">&lt;&lt;the people he left behind were left to cope with a situation&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but I think it is because no one can make the journey of self-healing,<br/>
self-actualizing for anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, remember at the very end of the story when Jonas sees the<br/>
lights and thinks he senses it also from the place he left behind...or<br/>
perhaps it &quot;was just an echo&quot;.  It makes me think of how our actions are<br/>
like pebbles thrown in a pond...the ripples may well spur someone on toward<br/>
their own journey.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Remarkably so Julie. When we first moved here, my daughter decided she would <br/>
go to school. We looked around quite a bit and found one as suitable to <br/>
unschooling as we could find. . . a very small Montessori. We became friends <br/>
with the family but had sort of fell out of touch lately. Yesterday, the mom <br/>
found me via unschooling.com message boards, which she is reading <br/>
voraciously, trying to figure out a solution for her daughter who is <br/>
absolutely miserable in school. She told me yesterday, she felt as though I <br/>
was an answer to her prayers, and how it was no accident we met a couple of <br/>
years ago. She needs someone to help her on this journey, and I am so <br/>
grateful to have that opportunity. Her daughter needs to see other girls her <br/>
age who are &quot;normal&quot; (not sure if I can classify Lil as that LOL, she says. . <br/>
thats true) and are leading an unschooling life, although at this point, they <br/>
aren&#39;t too sure what that is, based on things she has said. I am sure after <br/>
reading the message boards she will get a clearer picture. I think she <br/>
searched unshcooling because she had heard me mention it. Anyway, we never <br/>
know whose lives our words may touch. ..  pretty cool!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143173767">When I am most exasperated and hear myself yelling at my wonderfully boisterous children (when I am not in the same mood :)), I remember a story my mom told me and a story my dad told me. First mom&#39;s:<br/>
<br/>
She has been the cantor at her church for more than 25 years -- everyone there knows her beautiful voice. She loves to watch couples get married, bring their babies to be baptized, and then grow up themselves. One Sunday last year, she sat in front of a family with three young children, all of whom were wiggly and giggly. Mom almost reminded the young mother that the church had a &quot;cry room,&quot; but she remembered trying to get through an hour with 4 little ones, so she opted not to say anything. At the end of mass, the woman reached up to mom, touched her on the shoulder, and said, &quot;Petie, I know you don&#39;t know me, but I have come here every Sunday for three years. I have always enjoyed your singing. You are special because you have never said anything but kind things to me and my children. We are moving today and I just wanted to say good by and thank you for your patience.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Dad&#39;s story:<br/>
<br/>
In Vietnam, he was training paratroopers and jumped with them regularly into training drop zones. One time, the winds were high, he was heavier than the lighter South Vietnamese men, and he landed high up in a tree. As he was struggling to get himself untangled, he heard footsteps approaching. He saw a lone figure and suspected that it was a North Vietnamese scout. He tried to reach his sidearm, but it and his arm were pinned to his side. He had intended to shot the man. Dad held his breath and waited for the slow-moving man to get past. Suddenly, the man looked up and saw dad. In an instant, dad recognized him as a South Vietnamese follow officer who was trying to find him to help him back to safety. Whenever dad told this story, he always got quiet as though the magnitude of the choice he had been willing to make, but thankfully had been unable to, washed over him anew.<br/>
