<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263985670">We &quot;handle&quot; this like we do everything else. We trust Lelia&#39;s judgment. . she <br/>
is 12 and a half. She is at a party tonight with other unschoolers, from her <br/>
age up to age 18 I believe. There is a young man she has a crush on who is <br/>
16, who is coming over tomorrow. They might go get a bite to eat. . .her <br/>
choice. We have always talked about everything and still do. We take each day <br/>
as it comes and try to learn from all the experiences that come our way. I <br/>
would not begin now to try and control her actions by saying no dating until <br/>
such and such an age, or anything of that nature. <br/>

The love that you withhold is the pain that you carry - from lifetime<br/>
to lifetime.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959562763">Oh, alright. Honestly? I nearly croaked when my oldest got her first kiss. It took every ounce of restraint for me to not interfere but you can bet, I was *dying* to!  DD could sense my discontent and I could tell that the more I acted that way, the worse it got. So, I had to fake liking the guy and welcome him with open arms. It was extremely hard but I did it &lt;g&gt;. Well, ... the guy practically lived over here... ate his meals here (whad&#39;dIlooklike? A restaurant?!) Anyway, all he wanted to do was snuggle and watch MTV &lt;sigh&gt;. DD *finally* got sick of it and sent him packing after 3 weeks. (yeah!!) When I asked her why they broke up, she said he was totally boring and too possessive. <br/>
Had I continued on my first course of showing my disapproval, I shudder to think what would have happened. Luckily, I butted out and things went the natural course.<br/>
IMO you should remain neutral as much as possible. If there&#39;s something you dislike about the girl, if you can possibly point out these qualities without alienating him, that might help him come around to your way of thinking.<br/>

<br/>
  I want to ask the list about how they approach the subject of dating and &#39;the <br/>
  first kiss&#39;.  My oldest is 12 and has gone a few times to another girl&#39;s <br/>
  house with a group of kids who are all 13.  It is usually about 4 girls and 2 <br/>
  boys.  He says they play on the computer and talk and goof around.  I know <br/>
  that girls are starting to have crushes on him, but 12 is too young!  Girls <br/>
  mature faster then boys, since I remember being one once.  How do I handle <br/>
  this subject?!  Please respond with advice and stories I can learn from.  <br/>
  Thank you!<br/>
