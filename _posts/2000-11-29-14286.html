<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516880749">John, <br/>
<br/>
Honestly it must look like I&#39;m waiting for you to post something, but after I <br/>
wrote what&#39;s below, I think I realized what the irritation is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; ...[Berman]  points out that out of 158 countries we are 49th in literacy,<br/>
 that 60 percent of our population has never read a book of any kind, that<br/>
 the number of truly educated individuals in America may amount to less than<br/>
 5 million people, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope his definitions of &quot;literacy&quot; and &quot;a book&quot; and &quot;truly educated&quot; are in <br/>
there and that they&#39;re not as irritating as this excerpt.<br/>
<br/>
Where would this never-read-a-book 60 percent have volunteered their <br/>
information?  It sounds like alarmist writing, and no doubt the guy hopes <br/>
lots of readers will believe anything that has numbers.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Truly educated&quot; is a bomb which would probably take out a fair number of <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen but can&#39;t quote some humorous &quot;stats&quot; about stats.   Something like <br/>
80% of readers believe 95% of anything that contains at least 5% statistics.  <br/>
<br/>
=======================<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now I know what I&#39;m bristly about.  <br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling and unschooling are enough of a socio-political project for me. <br/>
 (FOR ME, not for just anyone.)   I have resented the *many* times I&#39;ve <br/>
gotten alarmist e-mail or been included rhetorically with &quot;pro-life&quot; and <br/>
creationist science and right-wing politics just because my kids weren&#39;t in <br/>
school.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe the sky is falling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that if the sky WERE falling that homeschooling would be the <br/>
platform from which to catch and reposition it.  <br/>
<br/>
So when all radical alternative politics are offered up as part of the <br/>
unschooling buffet [and yes, I know that there&#39;s nothing in the world from <br/>
which people can&#39;t learn, including maybe/I hope even this e-mail right <br/>
here], I feel really crowded and made to eat what I don&#39;t want to eat.  <br/>
<br/>
In case other people are feeling crowded, it seems worth pointing out <br/>
sometimes that there is an extreme-rhetoric coating on some basic truths <br/>
which can make it taste like the sky is going to fall before lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Some people see homeschooling as a part of a conservative, religious <br/>
return-to-[recreated/fantasy]-Godly-roots lifestyle and they think they <br/>
invented it and they own it.  Some people see homeschooling as a part of an <br/>
alternative, interplanetary-village new-age blossoming of immediate effect.  <br/>
It&#39;s like the Age of Aquarius with terrorist agents.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to see homeschooling as a range of options for families to use, <br/>
and it concerns me when a homeschooling information source aligns itself too <br/>
closely with a packaged set of unrelated beliefs one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably temperamental and philosophical difference in point of <br/>
view depending on the age of the parents and the ages of their children and <br/>
the number of years they&#39;ve homeschooled, too.  When I was young I really <br/>
wanted to reform education totally from within.  I was so young I didn&#39;t know <br/>
how big it was altogether, and what it really meant to have mortgages and to <br/>
be five years from retirement, and how many peripheral industries (cafeterias <br/>
and their providers of equipment and goods; schoolbus drivers and their <br/>
training seminars...) were between me (thousands of us, not me alone) and <br/>
change.  <br/>
<br/>
I neither want to be invited to abortion clinic protests nor be expected to <br/>
be vegan.<br/>
I neither want to have to sign a statement of faith nor to have to admit <br/>
whether I voted for Nader.  I want to share how children can learn and how <br/>
families can incorporate unschooling with confidence.  I&#39;m interested in pure <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So having made my protest here, I&#39;ll try to back off John as much as possible <br/>
and to shush up when something reminds me of something which has been really <br/>
unpleasant socially in the past.   But please remember I&#39;m not the only one <br/>
here, and that others will come in the future, with the same sensibilities.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for expressing something I too feel irritated and bristly about!<br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too, but perhaps this is something we all have to arrive at? Is it possible to<br/>
become a wise old woman when you&#39;re young? Or in John&#39;s case, well, sorry John,<br/>
but I doubt you&#39;ll ever be quite that - old yes, (I hope so), wise, maybe, but<br/>
woman - even with a sex change op, not quite &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I really enjoy it when you do this here, and on the message boards :-) I<br/>
really like the way sometimes you make me nod vigourously in agreement, sometimes<br/>
I reel back, but always you make me think, and always I know that you are saying<br/>
what you think without compromise.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t shush up - you tend to say what I&#39;m trying to think, and it is so<br/>
much easier when I&#39;m puzzling away about why/what/how I feel about something to<br/>
just shrug and say &#39;well, I&#39;ll just wait for Sandra to say it, and then I&#39;ll<br/>
know&#39;. And even if I disagree with you, by the time you&#39;ve had your say I know<br/>
exactly what I think!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659459767">John&#39;s original post was, as far as I could tell, a sharing of an <br/>
activity he did with his family. I agree with you that we should focus on <br/>
sharing about our families and their learning. I don&#39;t feel that anyone is <br/>
pushing his/her point of view most of the time. Although once in a while it <br/>
feels that way when someone is highly opinionated. Let&#39;s all try to learn <br/>
from each other and refrain from long reactive posts if possible. <br/>
