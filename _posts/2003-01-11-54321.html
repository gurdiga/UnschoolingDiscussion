<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358350101">Dillon (10) aspires to be a Celtic/bluegrass fiddler.  He has been taking &quot;violin&quot; lessons for about 2 years and doing pretty good.  We&#39;ve changed teachers twice(the first time our choice, then that teacher stopped teaching so the school assigned us a new teacher).  He never complains about going to his lesson, but he never touches his fiddle outside of class anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the question.  Can you give me more info about the type of things Holly practices?  What book is she using, what CD&#39;s are her &quot;required&quot; listening.  Dillon is never asked to listen to anything, but his teacher is Asian and frankly doesn&#39;t know anything about roots music.  She is very good with Dillon and is more than willing to teach his music that we bring to her.  Luckily his dad loves roots music and Dillon listens daily to all sorts of fiddlers and other musicians.  <br/>
<br/>
I  just talked to Dillon about his lessons the other day.  He says that he wants to keep going to lessons although he feels that practicing is too much like a chore (I remind him rather than force him).  I&#39;ve tried to find a fiddler to teach him with no luck (although we live in the Blue Ridge Mtns).  Dad takes him to shows and introduces him to the musicians (Dad is a taper and knows lots of them that way).  Dillon even asks me why I think fiddling feels like a chore.  I&#39;ve asked him what he thinks, I&#39;ve offered ideas and reinforced that learning to fiddle is his choice and I will do what I can to make it work for him.  But that if he has tired of it or changed his mind it&#39;s okay to stop.  <br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Here&#39;s the question.  Can you give me more info about the type of things <br/>
Holly practices?  What book is she using, what CD&#39;s are her &quot;required&quot; <br/>
listening.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a bluegrass book with CD.  It&#39;s in her room and she&#39;s still asleep, <br/>
but I bet it can be ordered online.   She also has a Suzuki book/CD, and two <br/>
that her teacher made.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing about the beginning bluegrass thing is they are in easy keys.  <br/>
But the music is written out in regular musical notation.<br/>
<br/>
Her teacher uses another kind of very easy to read notation that shows string <br/>
and finger.  So far since they&#39;re doing everythign in whatever key you get <br/>
naturally on a violin (G?  F?  something not C), it&#39;s simple to read.    I <br/>
even read some yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a dance society there?  Something like a contradance club or <br/>
squaredance club with live music?  That might be the place to go to hear live <br/>
music and maybe find one of the musicians who might at least let him jam on <br/>
something that&#39;s going to be easy and in his key.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a group here called Fiddlekids and they do all play-along stuff, so <br/>
they do the same songs always and forever, and newer kids join in on what <br/>
they can, and as they get better can play it all.  Holly hasn&#39;t done that.<br/>
<br/>
There is a &quot;slow jam&quot; here once a month which we were going to start going <br/>
to, but then I broke my leg.  Maybe next month.  There are other jam sessions <br/>
which zip along full speed, but there&#39;s one specifically easy and <br/>
particularly welcoming to kids.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to a violin shop or any music shop (if you&#39;re near a city with such <br/>
things) you could ask them for something with a CD in it that&#39;s easy enough <br/>
for beginners.<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t remember to post the name of Holly&#39;s book, remind me.  <br/>
