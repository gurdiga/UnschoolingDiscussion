<div id="ygrps-yiv-914964926">Wed like to invite unschoolers to join our new group @ <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingFOTR/_">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingFOTR/_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingFOTR/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingFOTR/)</a>    <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling Families  on the Road is for families that work/live/play/learn <br/>
while on the road, whether  they&#39;re full time, part time, or those that wanna <br/>
be. We&#39;re hoping  this can be a forum for unschoolers to discuss topics related <br/>
to traveling, cool  sites to visit, finding employment on the road, sharing <br/>
cool stories and even to  make real life connections. <br/>
We would also like to  welcome unschooling families who are not on the road <br/>
but would like our  traveling members to stop by for a visit.  A network of <br/>
like minded  families and a touch of home mean so much when familiar faces are  <br/>
scarce. <br/>
Thanks!  I hope this was appropriate to post this here. If not, I apologize <br/>
in advance.  :)<br/>

makes me feel special cause I get to hug  myself.<br/>
