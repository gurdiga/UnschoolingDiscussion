<div id="ygrps-yiv-409568890">Hi Sandra and Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I have a question to ask about unschooling and discipline.....<br/>
<br/>
What are your views with which what is the best form of discipline to use or<br/>
not use with your child while unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I ask this because lately while visiting with a few of what is left of our <br/>
schooled&quot; friends (My middles son in particular is having trouble &quot;letting<br/>
go&quot; of his one last &quot;schooled friend&quot; David) I noticed that their mother<br/>
when they got into trouble would spank them and send them to the corner. Now<br/>
me personally, I do not believe in that and never have because I do not<br/>
believe in shaming a child into compliance, I always treat my childre3n with<br/>
respect and do not really consider this an effective way of being with<br/>
children......so I was curious as to your views on this Sandra and everyone<br/>
and as to what if anything I should say to her. She is considering<br/>
homeschooling and I have been speaking to her about unschooling as of late,<br/>
but the happening of this type of discipline the other day at her house just<br/>
really upset both me and my kids, as that is not how I treat my children, so<br/>
I was wondering what everyone&#39;s thoughts were on the matter?<br/>
<br/>
And Sandra, do you have any info about this very subject on your website<br/>
that I might be able to refer her to?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the help! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133272636">Hi it&#39;s me again!<br/>
<br/>
Opps! I forgot to clarify something in my last post......<br/>
<br/>
What I meant to say was that my girlfriend was using this form of discipline<br/>
on HER children while my kids and I watched, not her doing this to my<br/>
children. When I re-read my post, it did not sound right, so I wanted to<br/>
clarify it! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
I  just talk to them.<br/>
<br/>
Not &quot;just&quot; talk to them, but the principles of keeping kids safe in their own <br/>
home extends to all of the kids.  So if Holly is harrassing Marty, I want to <br/>
arrange for Marty to have some Holly-free space, but I don&#39;t want to turn <br/>
around and disturb Holly&#39;s peace.   (That example is fresh as it&#39;s happened twice <br/>
in two days that I had to extract Holly from Marty-space.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a rough one.  Depends how much you want to maintain the friendship.  I <br/>
would probably write her a letter and give to her in writing so she can&#39;t <br/>
interrupt or explain away or misinterpret what you said to her.    I think I <br/>
would lean on the idea that it&#39;s upsetting for your son to see it, and maybe she <br/>
could just avoid it, especially if your son&#39;s presence had anything to do with <br/>
it.  (Like if she&#39;s being tough on her kids for his sake, somehow; not <br/>
thinking of a good way to say what I&#39;m imagining.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896082578">Thank you Sandra for the website info and for the suggestion. You <br/>
are right a letter might be best in this case. I would like to try <br/>
and still be friends with her especially since she is still weighing <br/>
the unschooling issue herself for her kids and herself. <br/>
<br/>
But you are right, I do not value this type of behavior being shown <br/>
in front of me or my kids, so I think a leter to her might just work <br/>
and also giving her the website info too, that just may open her <br/>
eyes to see when spanking and sending your child to the corner just <br/>
is wrong and why and that there are many many other effective ways <br/>
to handle it. The website info has been a great help, I have been <br/>
reading it off and on all day! :) I even joined Pam&#39;s No spanking <br/>
yahoo group too! Did not know she had one! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the websites again and if anyone else has any other ideas <br/>
too, please let me know. I am open to any and all suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
