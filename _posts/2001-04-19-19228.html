 </span></blockquote> I am getting these attachments too.  <br/>
I am also getting a little box that keeps coming up telling me my <br/>
computer has commited an illegal act - usually on Johanna&#39;s posts <br/>
(but not always)<br/>
I dont know a great deal about the workings of computers - so this <br/>
could just be coincidental.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a virus detector thing on the computer, and it has not <br/>
detected any virus.<br/>

<div>I got an error message with one of Johanna&#39;s e-mails too.&nbsp; My computer 
asked if I wanted to view the message in plain text instead and that worked 
fine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I know it won&#39;t guarantee that I won&#39;t get a virus, but I don&#39;t open 
attachments, even from people I know, unless there is introductory text that 
makes sense to me.</div>

large proportion of incoming perceptions.<br></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586977208">Hi everyone. I was hit with a bad computer virus last Wednesday and my<br/>
computer was toast until just this morning. I am sorry if anyone else got<br/>
the virus by attachments sent through my email.<br/>
As you all know by now, it was a fast moving one. I tried to stop the<br/>
messages from going out, but 3 got by me before I could disable it. I&#39;m<br/>
sorry.<br/>
