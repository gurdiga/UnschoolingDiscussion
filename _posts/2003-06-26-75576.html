&gt; homeschool in the unschooling way, but I&#39;m a single mom and I have a <br/>
&gt; job that I love now.  So, I&#39;ve been thinking about starting <br/>
&gt; an &quot;unschool&quot; for my son and other children whose parents would like <br/>
&gt; to homeschool, but cannot do so on their own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone else tried to do this?  Sudbury Valley Schools seem to be <br/>
&gt; the closest, but I don&#39;t want to do anything that big and there are <br/>
&gt; none in my area.  I just want to create an unschooling community <br/>
&gt; learning center for a small number of children.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have any suggestions, ideas, or warnings for me, let me know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My best friend&#39;s family has been involved in a Sudbury school near Hartford, <br/>
CT (which is desperately looking for students, by the way, in case you know of <br/>
anyone!), which started up last fall.  They would tell you it&#39;s the most <br/>
wonderful and horrific thing they&#39;ve ever done. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s wonderful because they have a small group of kids who were sad that <br/>
school ended last week. Nick (my friend&#39;s son) is the happiest he&#39;s ever been. <br/>
When my friend, Melissa, was talking about the school possibly having to close, <br/>
her reaction to the possiblity of Nick&#39;s having to go back to public school (he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to homeschool) was &quot;When will he have time to learn anything?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The horrific part is that it&#39;s really HARD to start a school or program. (By <br/>
the way, apparently most of the Sudbury schools across the country, other than <br/>
the first, are small and always scraping by looking for students.) It&#39;s hard <br/>
to find kids, it&#39;s hard to work out money issues, it&#39;s just hard!<br/>
<br/>
If you like I can connect you with my friend and she&#39;ll be able to answer <br/>
more questions. <br/>
