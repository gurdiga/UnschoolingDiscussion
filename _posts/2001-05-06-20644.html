<br/>
I would like to explain the whole biblical spanking thing, just so we <br/>
can get that over with.  I have a website about it, but I will post the <br/>
gist of it here.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to say that, I WAS a born-again Christian for 20 <br/>
years.  I was fed all their doctrine and pretty much believed it.  <br/>
Finally, because of basic doctrinal flaws and misteaching,  I no <br/>
longer call myself Christian, though I believe in God and still <br/>
worship him/her in my own way.  One of the basic things I cannot <br/>
tolerate in a religion of Love is the hurting of other people.  <br/>
<br/>
God does not ever harm us.....he/she allows us to learn from the <br/>
consequences of our own actions.  This is how I raise my children, <br/>
and this is why I believe people have to go through hard things in <br/>
their lives....to learn the lessons they specifically came here to <br/>
earth to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
Read the first five books of the Bible, which we call the Books of <br/>
Law or the Torah.  This is the Law which God gave to Moses and <br/>
which he intended the children of Israel to live by.  What is <br/>
mentioned in these five books about childrearing and discipline? <br/>
<br/>
Deuteronomy 1:39 says &quot;And the little ones that you said would be <br/>
taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad--<br/>
they will enter the land.  I will give it to them and they will take <br/>
possession of it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
From this we learn that young children do not know good from bad. <br/>
 Their actions are not intentionally defiant or disobedient.  The <br/>
reason these children could enter the land is that they were <br/>
considered guiltless.  They were not held accountable for any <br/>
wrong actions.<br/>
<br/>
Deuteronomy 6:6-9 says &quot;These commandments that I give you <br/>
today are to be upon your hearts.  Impress them on your children.  <br/>
Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along <br/>
the road, when you lie down and when you get up.  Tie them as <br/>
symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.  Write <br/>
them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This passage injoins the parent to give verbal instruction to their <br/>
children, and to use every opportunity to impress God&#39;s commands <br/>
upon them.  He also encouraged us to give our children visible <br/>
reminders of God&#39;s expectations and promises. <br/>
<br/>
Deuteronomy 21:18-21 says &quot;If a man has a stubborn and <br/>
rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not <br/>
listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall <br/>
take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. <br/>
 They shall say to the elders, &#39;This son of ours is stubborn and<br/>
rebellious.  He will not obey us.  He is a profligate and a drunkard.&#39;  <br/>
Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death.  You must <br/>
purge the evil from among you.  All Israel will hear of it and be <br/>
afraid.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This passage is instruction given to parents whose GROWN child <br/>
has become a profligate and a drunkard.  A profligate was <br/>
someone who spent all his money on riotous living, like the <br/>
Prodigal Son of Luke 15:11-32.  The purpose of the stoning was not <br/>
to change the behavior of this adult child, but to purge evil from the <br/>
house of Israel.  The parents said that their discipline had not <br/>
changed his behavior, so now he had to be punished.  That<br/>
is the difference between discipline and punishment.  A child is <br/>
disciplined while there is still hope of him changing.  Punishment is <br/>
a final judgement of God against a person when there is no longer <br/>
any hope of changing his heart.  Punishment is not a form of <br/>
discipline, and this stoning is not an example of discipline.  In<br/>
discipline, we show grace to the child.  In punishment, God shows <br/>
justice. <br/>
<br/>
As parents, we are required to show to our child the same grace in <br/>
discipline that God has shown us.  Since we no longer live under <br/>
the Old Law, punishment is something we leave to God when all <br/>
our efforts to discipline have failed. <br/>
<br/>
Think about this father and mother in the example above.  They <br/>
knew that stoning would end the life of their child.  No matter what <br/>
a child has done, a mother always loves her child and wants the <br/>
best for him.  Before taking their child to the elders of the city, they <br/>
would have tried every possible loving method of discipline.  They<br/>
would not have taken their child there if there had been any hope <br/>
that he would change.  Knowing that children are often impetuous <br/>
in their youth, but often grow out of this as they mature, they would <br/>
have brought the child up until he was an adult, always hoping he <br/>
would heed their discipline and change.  Only when he was an adult<br/>
would such an extreme measure be taken.  This kind of treatment <br/>
would never have been given a child. <br/>
<br/>
These three passages constitute everything God said to the <br/>
children of Israel specifically about parenting.  You will<br/>
notice that while they are told to discipline, spanking or the use of <br/>
the &quot;rod&quot; is not mentioned anywhere in the books<br/>
of Law.  Parents were allowed to decide individually what kind of <br/>
discipline was best for their special and unique<br/>
child.  The were NOT taught that spanking was required. <br/>
<br/>
Christians who maintain that spanking is manditory discipline for <br/>
children are applying a one-size-fits-all approach to parenting which <br/>
is in contradiction to Proverbs 22:6.  In this passage, the original <br/>
text indicates that we are to parent children according to their God-<br/>
given inborn design.  We are to respect their individual differences<br/>
and train them accordingly.  Spanking is not necessary or <br/>
desirable in most cases where discipline is required, and is <br/>
certainly not mandatory to good Christian parenting. <br/>
<br/>
Many Christians point to Hebrews 12:5-6 which says &quot;My son, do <br/>
not make light of the Lord&#39;s discipline, and do not lose heart when <br/>
he rebukes you, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and <br/>
he scourges everyone he accepts as a son.&quot;  The writer of <br/>
Hebrews was quoting Proverbs 3:11-12 which makes this same <br/>
statement.  They point to the word &quot;scourges&quot; (also translated <br/>
disciplines, chastises) and say that this is the same kind of<br/>
scourging Paul received when he was beaten, perhaps the same <br/>
kind of scourging Jesus received before he was<br/>
crucified. <br/>
<br/>
There are two ways you can take this passage, literally and <br/>
metaphorically.  If you take the passage literally, you<br/>
are saying that you believe that each child should be physically <br/>
scourged and beaten in the same way Paul and Jesus were.  <br/>
These beatings often resulted in a bleeding and bruised body for <br/>
the recipient.  I don&#39;t believe that those who advocate spanking <br/>
would say that children ought to receive this kind of scourging, <br/>
which would be physically damaging to the child.  So we are forced <br/>
to conclude that this passage is used metaphorically. <br/>
<br/>
God doesn&#39;t actually beat us up with a whip; he does use the <br/>
circumstances of our lives to discipline us.  This is<br/>
what he expects us to do with our children as well.  There are <br/>
many creative and effective ways of guiding children<br/>
toward right behavior without using spanking or any other form of <br/>
discipline that would hurt them. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
A Definition of &quot;Discipline&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My way of defining discipline is simply that it is a framework which <br/>
provides motivation for right behavior.  Once the frame of a house is <br/>
set upon the foundation, the builders are pretty much committed to <br/>
a particular shape and style of house.  While our foundation is, of <br/>
course, Jesus Christ, the framework which we use to shape the <br/>
house is called Attachment Parenting. <br/>
<br/>
When a child is parented according to attachment parenting <br/>
principles, he has learned to trust his parents because<br/>
of their consistently sensitive care of him.  He intuitively trusts what <br/>
they say, and is easier to discipline.  The<br/>
discipline is based upon their intimate relationship, and his <br/>
dependence upon it.  When there is a &quot;break&quot; or<br/>
disruption in the attachment relationship caused by the child&#39;s <br/>
behavior, he is highly motivated to re-establish the<br/>
security and intimacy of that relationship.  He does not like the <br/>
feeling of having physical or psychological space<br/>
put between him and the parent.  He will change his behavior in <br/>
order to come back into a right relationship with<br/>
the parent, which means he can once again enjoy the physical and <br/>
emotional comfort and security that this<br/>
relationship provides. <br/>
<br/>
This is exactly what God does when we sin.  He does not leave us <br/>
in the sense that he stops caring for us, but he<br/>
does break fellowship with us until we have repented.  This is what <br/>
we as parents should do.  We still continue to<br/>
care for the needs of our child, but we withdraw fellowship from <br/>
him.  This is so uncomfortable for him emotionally<br/>
that he quickly seeks to change his behavior and repent. <br/>
<br/>
Trust is based upon the meeting of physical needs.  A child who <br/>
does not trust his parents to take care of him will<br/>
not respect their guidance and discipline either.  By not using <br/>
attachment parenting principles, parents are forced<br/>
into a position where they must use more aggressive disciplinary <br/>
techniques. <br/>
<br/>
When a child misbehaves, the first question to ask is, &quot;What need <br/>
does my child need that I have ignored or<br/>
overlooked?&quot;  or &quot;What aspect of our shared relationship has been <br/>
violated? <br/>
<br/>
Some researchers believe that over 50% of the adults currently <br/>
incarcerated in prisons are there as a direct result of<br/>
disturbed attachment relationships or complete attachment breaks <br/>
during childhood.  Each person needs to be part<br/>
of a healthy, shared attachment relationship to develop normally.  <br/>
Spanking is one avenue for introducing attachment breaks into the <br/>
internal working model, though it is not the only avenue.  When a <br/>
child is spanked, even though the rest of his experiences with his <br/>
parents are positive, an unknown element has been introduced into<br/>
his world which causes him to question his parents.  Spanking <br/>
causes the child to feel disrespected on a very basic level.  This <br/>
effects different children in different ways, depending on their <br/>
individual temperaments.  You never know how it is going to effect <br/>
your particular child. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, with so many other effective disciplinary methods, <br/>
spanking is undesirable and rarely needed.  Also, since spanking <br/>
was not specifically commanded in the Law of Moses, it was not <br/>
something God expected them to do.  Remember that the Law was <br/>
considered perfect, and those who followed it perfectly (which is no <br/>
one, of course) could be considered right with God.  If God didn&#39;t <br/>
think spanking was necessary for the parent to be a &quot;good parent&quot; <br/>
or didn&#39;t think it was necessary for the child, then why do we say <br/>
that it IS necessary, since God never wrote a word about it?<br/>
<br/>
Since the New Testament is based upon disciplining with grace, <br/>
spanking would not be in harmony with New Testament teaching. <br/>
<br/>
One final verse which often gives parents trouble is the verse &quot;He <br/>
who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful <br/>
to discipline him&quot; (Proverbs 13:24).   The word &quot;rod&quot; is used in <br/>
various ways in scripture, and in the original Hebrew there were <br/>
eight to ten different meanings for the word.  The pole that <br/>
shepherds used to guide their sheep along the road was called a <br/>
rod.  It was not used to hit the sheep, but to guide them as they<br/>
walked and keep them on the road.  This would correspond to the <br/>
framework we talked about earlier.  It is simply a guide.  The <br/>
shepherd also had a large club called a rod which he used to drive <br/>
away predators, but it never was used to hit the sheep.  God also <br/>
spoke of the &quot;rod of my mouth&quot; which he used for discipline also.  <br/>
In short, the rod was any article or method used to guide, teach, or <br/>
discipline.  It did not have to be a physical method, either, or<br/>
God could not have used his mouth as a rod. <br/>
<br/>
The verse is correct in that, if you do not provide discipline for your <br/>
child, he will learn to behave badly.  But the rod in this verse is not <br/>
specifically referring to spanking, but to any disciplinary method <br/>
which gets the job done. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Many parents prefer spanking because it&#39;s quick and easy, and <br/>
gets the behavior stopped right away.  But children learn through <br/>
modeling, and though spanking does show the child that you <br/>
disapprove of this behavior, it does not teach what is right behavior. <br/>
 We can find a similar analogy with the Old and New Testaments.  <br/>
In the Old Law, there was a standard, and people were expected to <br/>
live by the standard.  Just because people knew the Law and that <br/>
they would be punished for disobeying it, that did not keep the <br/>
people from disobeying.  In the New Testament, we are given the <br/>
Holy Spirit to empower us to live righteously.  Yet, we expect our <br/>
children to obey with only the threat of punishment to keep them <br/>
from sinning.  If it did not work in the Old Law, it will not work<br/>
now.  Indeed, we have been given a more excellent way.  We need <br/>
to teach them from the standpoint of an inner knowledge of <br/>
rightness rather than an externally imposed law.  We need to teach <br/>
them to be Spirit-led believers, notPharisaical lawkeepers.  Most <br/>
importantly, we need to model grace to them in every encounter we <br/>
have. <br/>
<br/>
Briefly, I would like to talk about the Proverbs 23:13-14 which says,<br/>
&quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with the <br/>
rod, he will not die. Punish him with the rod and save his soul from <br/>
death.&quot;  Once again, the word punishment is used in this passage, <br/>
so we know that this passage was talking about an action which <br/>
was a last resort type of thing.  It was very physically painful and <br/>
would NOT have been applied to anything but a grown child.  Also, <br/>
these verses were NOT part of the Law of Moses, but were added <br/>
much later.  They were supposedly wise sayings from a king.  <br/>
However, for much of the history of the Jews these sayings were <br/>
not available, and they were not required to adhere to them as part <br/>
of the Law.  So while some people may like these sayings, the <br/>
Jews were not required (by God) to adhere to them as part of the <br/>
perfect nature of the Law, although certainly, the Jewish leaders <br/>
may have tried to bind this man-made commandment upon the <br/>
people.  Indeed, anyone who knows anything about the Jews know <br/>
that they loved to write commentaries on the scripture, giving their <br/>
own interpretation and binding that upon people.  I look at this <br/>
verse as just one of those commentaries.  <br/>
<br/>
So, there are NO verses in the Law of Moses or the New <br/>
Testament which in any way lead us to believe spanking is <br/>
acceptable.  And the commentaries on the law are just <br/>
that....commentaries, and open to interpretation.  I believe the <br/>
commentaries, and especially the books of poetry (Job, Psalms, <br/>
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon) are wonderful books, <br/>
but not divinely inspired, simply wisdom literature written by wise <br/>
individuals.  They had much to say that was valuable, but they <br/>
were not speaking for God in all cases.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that clears up the confusion.  Thanks.<br/>
