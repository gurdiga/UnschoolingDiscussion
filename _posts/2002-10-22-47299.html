&gt;disrespectful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the above two comments are skirting around a key point. Sure, <br/>
it is fine, desireable, and utopian (heavenly?) to want everyone to <br/>
get treated respectfully.  But human beings are self-centered enough <br/>
by nature that it will not happen that way.  Recognizing that, human <br/>
beings throughout history have formed societies of some sort (am I <br/>
missing any exceptions, except hermits and perhaps hobos?).<br/>
<br/>
These societies tend to create or evolve expected behaviors and <br/>
hierarchies.  &quot;Back to the Future II&quot; showed an idea of what our <br/>
society could be like in 30 years if we continue on track from 1985.  <br/>
I took that movie as portraying everyone looking out for him/her self <br/>
and the strongest/most selfish being on top.<br/>
<br/>
To counter that self-centeredness, I believe that many societies came <br/>
up with a respect-for-age hierarchy.  Though by no means perfect, it <br/>
at least gave the leadership to the more experienced people: the <br/>
adults.  Within adulthood, it gave leadership to the experienced <br/>
elderly.  Along parallel lines, societies used to award respect to <br/>
those in authority (mayors, judges, police officers, professionals in <br/>
their field such as doctors, lawyers, used car salesmen (well, you <br/>
get the idea), governors, and presidents.  <br/>
<br/>
If we now raise children to ignore those hierarchies, but we do not <br/>
come up with better ones to replace them, we are leaving our society <br/>
open to anarchy (I suppose that means no one respects anyone else in <br/>
case of a tie or disagreement).  Again, if we all got along perfectly <br/>
we would not need this.  But we don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I have an opinion on why the hierarchies of age/experience and <br/>
leadership have worked in the past, but I will leave those to another <br/>
post if anyone is interested (or ask me offline).  <br/>

We&#39;re raising our kids to believe (as we do) that Anarchy (not to be <br/>
confused with chaos) IS a better system of government. Unfortunately, there <br/>
are just WAY too many people on the planet to make it work. If somehow we <br/>
could get the &quot;big government&quot; out, and a *very* small one in, and let <br/>
states be autonomous unto themselves (see &quot;Constitution&lt;g&gt;), and run each <br/>
state by consensus/anarchy, more people would be happier (IMO). Anarchy is <br/>
about everyone in that *community* being heard (i.e. MORE respect than <br/>
democracy), not less. Like I said though, I don&#39;t see this being <br/>
implemented until there&#39;s a *drastic* reduction in population, via some <br/>
sort of major, earth-changing catastrophe :(<br/>

OK, that explains it for me.  I suppose you are using definitions 1a <br/>
and 1c of anarchy, rather than the 1b and 2 that I was using:<br/>
 ANARCHY<br/>
  1a. having no ruler<br/>
  1b. a state of lawlessness or political disorder due to the absence <br/>
of governmental authority<br/>
  1c. a utopian society made up of individuals who have no government <br/>
and who enjoy complete freedom<br/>
  2. absence of order<br/>
  <br/>
I would agree with you that this would be excellent if it were <br/>
possible, and agree also that a small federal government with <br/>
autonomous states is both desireable and constitutionally correct.<br/>
<br/>
I would disagree about the population being the hindrance, because I <br/>
don&#39;t think the world is (yet) filled up and because it should be <br/>
able to work (if correctly implemented) with any number of people <br/>
divided up into autonomous states.  However, obviously with just 5 <br/>
people (or so) on the whole earth, things would run a lot smoother <br/>
because no one would be envious of another&#39;s resources, and maybe <br/>
that is what you meant.<br/>
