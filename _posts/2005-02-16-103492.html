<div id="ygrps-yiv-495313944">The year Montana abolished the speed limit we took a trip to Arkansas.  <br/>
We were really careful not to speed because we were sure some crusading<br/>
officer would see our MT plates and think we thought we could drive any<br/>
speed we wanted.  Hot shot out-of-staters. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as we crossed the state line from OK into Arkansas we missed a<br/>
speed limit sign and got pulled over. <br/>
<br/>
The patrolman&#39;s name was officer Crusader.  No kidding. He didn&#39;t ticket<br/>
us. He just asked a lot of questions about where we were going and told<br/>
us to slow down.  He was nice, but honestly, officer Crusader?!<br/>
<br/>
Montana has a speed limit again.  I mostly comply. <br/>
