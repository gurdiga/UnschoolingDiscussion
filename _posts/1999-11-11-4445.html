<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326957959">I understand the point Nancy is making about plots but there have been <br/>
some great movies that don&#39;t really have a &quot;bad guy.&quot;  One of my favorite is <br/>
Little Women.  I love the book and the movie.  Also, The Secret of Roan <br/>
Inish.  Then there are some that have some people who don&#39;t treat others as <br/>
they should but are still not the evil villain type.  I love The Black <br/>
Stallion.<br/>
    For older kids, there are movies like What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape, Sense <br/>
and Sensibility, Fried Green Tomatoes, A Walk in the Clouds, Driving Miss <br/>
Daisy...there are so many; these are just some I love.  I don&#39;t tend to think <br/>
in terms of &quot;kids&quot; movies as they get older.  People are surprised that my <br/>
kids (all boys) like movies like these but I think most boys will if they <br/>
just get a chance to be exposed to them rather than having parents assume <br/>
they won&#39;t like them.<br/>
   I like kids to see movies that help foster empathy in them for the many <br/>
varieties of the human condition.  I do wrestle with the violence issue <br/>
myself because there are movies and stories I love that do have violence (The <br/>
Last of the Mohicans, for example).  I have allowed my older kids to see <br/>
these (ages 11 and 15) but sometimes I wonder if they would be better off if <br/>
they had never seen ANY form of violence.  They saw Cry Freedom, about the <br/>
apartheid situation in South Africa (specifically about Steven Bico) and I <br/>
felt like that story had a lot of value.  I do want them to have a sense of <br/>
outrage at injustice.  But it&#39;s a hard issue for me.  <br/>
    There are also movies and shows that I am even MORE ambivalent about like <br/>
X Files, yet I still allow my older ones to watch.  I know the show myself <br/>
and can understand the appeal for them but I&#39;m torn.  Not easy issues....<br/>
