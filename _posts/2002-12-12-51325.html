<div id="ygrps-yiv-304630377">A question: To what degree do you think this applies to 3-year-olds, without <br/>
siblings (used to all the attention she wants, plus extra!!)? Our little one <br/>
can be remarkably sharing, caring, loving.....or bossy, demanding, nagging, <br/>
whiny.....Do others with more experince at this think it&#39;s a 3-year-old <br/>
thing, or is there more we could be doing to help her understand how to be <br/>
more considerate? <br/>

little reasoning with a 3 year old.  They are self centered and self absorbed <br/>

somewhat.    Children model the behavior they see.. She will learn to be <br/>
considerate of others by seeing the adults around her showing consideration <br/>
to her and to the other people they interact with.  Thats all you need to do <br/>
to help her understand manners and courtesty..  She&#39;ll learn by what she <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715178124">Teresa: Thanks for the response. I think it&#39;s easy to forget our very verbal <br/>
little one is only 3 sometimes, and when I read from so many posters about <br/>
the consideration their kids show for others, I start to wonder if we should <br/>
be doing something differently...You&#39;ve made me think, though, and all in all <br/>
I&#39;d say our Kalie is headed in a good direction. :) One thing that comes to <br/>
mind is her &quot;excuse me, excuse me, excuse me&quot; when she interrupts - just <br/>
because it&#39;s delivered every 2 minutes or so, at increasing volume and <br/>
constantly, all through the day, doesn&#39;t detract from her effort! *smile* And <br/>
you&#39;re right - she picked this up on her own, by listening to others. <br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;ll just carry on! Thanks!<br/>

Well at 3 or 4, I don&#39;t see that as a big deal. I mean at that age, they do <br/>
indeed want you to stop right away and pay attention to what they have to <br/>
say or show you. And if they are understanding that an excuse me means just <br/>
that, I would give it to them. I have no problem with excusing myself from <br/>
what I&#39;m doing or who I&#39;m talking to when my 2 year old does it. Pretty much <br/>
anyone I would be speaking to would understand and if they didn&#39;t, they&#39;re <br/>
probably not important anyway. Until the child is old enough to get what it <br/>
means, as in the world doesn&#39;t stop but I&#39;m being polite for something real <br/>
important, I would let them come first.<br/>
<br/>
My two middle children are soon to be 7 and 8 and are just now getting it <br/>
and really only excuse themselves for something they feel is really <br/>
important. Now what is important to them right now won&#39;t be the same as the <br/>
important stuff to my 17 year old. Just like what the 2 year old sees as <br/>
important now also.<br/>

<br/>
I had too many adult friends who didn&#39;t understand.  Most of them just aren&#39;t <br/>
hanging around anymore! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always a problem that moms-at-home are seen as available anytime, being <br/>
unemployed and all.  But one thing I took to heart from La Leche League, <br/>
seeing it modelled by the leaders, was that children come first, before <br/>
meetings, before adult discussons, because their needs are immediate and the <br/>
adults should be mature enough to wait thirty seconds.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a couple of times I&#39;ve stated it, and a hundred I&#39;ve just <br/>
reminded myself quietly, that when I&#39;m with my homeschooled children I AM at <br/>
work, and others who want my time can&#39;t take precedence over my very real <br/>
job, which is having my children home for a myriad of good reasons.  And <br/>
training them not to interrupt adults has never been in my top hundred <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
At a party a few months ago at a party where families with kids were (the <br/>
birthday of a one-year-old who nearly hadn&#39;t survived a way-preemie birth), I <br/>
saw the mom of a three year old shame him directly and harshly for needing <br/>
her while she was talking to an adult.  She bent down and said &quot;I AM TALKING <br/>
WITH AN ADULT AND YOU WILL WAIT.&quot;   He really needed something, so I just <br/>
helped him myself.  When she had finished her conversation, she didn&#39;t even <br/>
look around to see if he still needed something.  He wasn&#39;t as important as <br/>
she was.  His need for his mother was much smaller than his mother&#39;s need to <br/>
chat.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids won&#39;t learn to respect others from being disrespected.<br/>

time. .. I dont know why my sister spelled it that way.. Her name is Karen, <br/>
maybe that why she wanted to use the &#39;K&quot;  &quot;shrug&quot;  Its a pretty name either <br/>
way your pronounce it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789754863">This is pretty much what we do with Kalie, too. At 3, if we don&#39;t give her <br/>
the floor, she takes it *grin* and no one else can speak anyway, because of <br/>
all the loud &quot;excuse me&#39;s&quot; flying around in the air. The really frustrating <br/>
part can be during meals, but while we occasionally try to tell her that <br/>
&quot;Daddy is trying to tell a story&quot; or something similar, we realize she hasn&#39;t <br/>
seen Daddy all day (usually), and just has a lot of really important things <br/>
to say! <br/>
<br/>
We used to enjoy when she was about 2 1/2, and if we grownups were talking to <br/>
each other, but not directly to Kalie, we&#39;d hear, &quot;I want to be part of the <br/>
conversation, too!&quot;. And so we&#39;d assure her she was, and try to draw her in a <br/>
bit. We&#39;ve always treated her like the person she is - it makes me sad when I <br/>
see so many parents ignore what their little ones have to say. I always stop <br/>
an adult conversation myself if someone else&#39;s child interrupts and is <br/>
ignored - just like I would stop it for an adult in the same situation. If <br/>
something is private, I always thought it should be discussed privately - why <br/>
is it that so many people (my mom, my sisters) insist that children aren&#39;t <br/>
listening and can&#39;t understand?? <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; that, I would give it to them. I have no problem with excusing myself from <br/>
&gt; what I&#39;m doing or who I&#39;m talking to when my 2 year old does it. Pretty <br/>
&gt; much <br/>
&gt; anyone I would be speaking to would understand and if they didn&#39;t, they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; probably not important anyway. Until the child is old enough to get what it <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; means, as in the world doesn&#39;t stop but I&#39;m being polite for something real <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; important, I would let them come first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My two middle children are soon to be 7 and 8 and are just now getting it <br/>
&gt; and really only excuse themselves for something they feel is really <br/>
&gt; important. Now what is important to them right now won&#39;t be the same as the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; important stuff to my 17 year old. Just like what the 2 year old sees as <br/>
&gt; important now also.<br/>

&gt; There have been a couple of times I&#39;ve stated it, and a hundred I&#39;ve just <br/>
&gt; reminded myself quietly, that when I&#39;m with my homeschooled children I AM <br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; work, and others who want my time can&#39;t take precedence over my very real <br/>
&gt; job, which is having my children home for a myriad of good reasons.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is such a wonderful thought! This is the very reason we have caller ID, <br/>
and I don&#39;t answer the phone a lot, but no one gets it when I say I&#39;m busy <br/>
with my daughter. &quot;I AM at work&quot;! Thanks for stating this so clearly - I love <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A  few months ago at a party where families with kids were (the <br/>
&gt; birthday of a one-year-old who nearly hadn&#39;t survived a way-preemie birth), <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; saw the mom of a three year old shame him directly and harshly for needing <br/>
&gt; her while she was talking to an adult.  She bent down and said &quot;I AM <br/>
&gt; TALKING <br/>
&gt; WITH AN ADULT AND YOU WILL WAIT.&quot;   He really needed something, so I just <br/>
&gt; helped him myself.  When she had finished her conversation, she didn&#39;t even <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; look around to see if he still needed something.  He wasn&#39;t as important as <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; she was.  His need for his mother was much smaller than his mother&#39;s need <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; chat.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This mother&#39;s behavior disgusts me. I see it all the time, this exact <br/>
scenario, and I have to say it makes me physically uncomfortable when I see <br/>
someone treat their child in a manner that seems so rude and abusive. <br/>
Children really want so little - why can&#39;t they have it, if it&#39;s within our <br/>
power? Thank you for taking care of this little boy&#39;s needs - I would hope <br/>
someone would be as generous with my 3-year-old if I were not with her (which <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine anyway!).<br/>

<br/>
Probably I was more sensitized to her behavior because we were there to <br/>
celebrate the survival of a multiply-near-lost child, and it seems that maybe <br/>
for those few hours she could have been more grateful to have her healthy <br/>
three year old able to walk over, hop and pull on her.  She should have <br/>
hugged him and cried for joy.<br/>

with their 2 yo! I have a lot of friends who insist on keeping a whiny<br/>
toddler waiting because &quot;they have to learn&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
And my all time &quot;favorite&quot; was at a playgroup one time...I had sat down <br/>
on a chair, only to have a sweet little 2 yo girl come up and say, &quot;excuse <br/>
me&quot; polite as could be because she had been sitting there a minute before and <br/>
I hadn&#39;t noticed. As I started to get up to move and tell her I am sorry, <br/>
her mom rushed over and told me that I didn&#39;t have to move because &quot;Children <br/>
must always defer to adults&quot;. My jaw just about hit the ground. I was so <br/>
caught off guard that I did not say anything other then to say that it was <br/>
ok, apologize to the little girl and take a different seat. I had never had <br/>
anyone put it so blatantly...after thinking about it for awhile, I wish that <br/>
I had said something to the mom about what an unhealthy thing this was to teach <br/>
a child, especially a girl. Talk about setting her up to be taken advantage of, <br/>
or even worse abused. If she is taught by her parents that she is less important then<br/>
others, how will she learn to respect herself or stand up for herself?<br/>
<br/>
So sad...<br/>

<br/>
I was wondering how much of that exists in my own lineage (back up to Texans, <br/>
and southerners before that).   There was certainly the kids&#39; table at <br/>
Thanksgiving (which makes sense for the kids, too, because the big table was <br/>
boring), and kids didn&#39;t sit when adults needed to sit, but that&#39;s still true <br/>
at my house today--not by training or reminder, but when there&#39;s any number <br/>
of kids and several adults, the kids take off to do better things than sit <br/>
and talk.<br/>
<br/>
To have it laid out as a rule instead of the kind of default rule nearly <br/>
shocked me.  But  maybe because it was a public place and not a home.  Seems <br/>
in public places rules are off.  Except busses.  Busses I still expect kids <br/>
to let adults sit.    But it&#39;s courtesy, not &quot;a rule.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Within the SCA we use the word &quot;defer&quot; a fair amount, and there&#39;s a lot of <br/>
&quot;deference&quot; to rank and office.  But in regular dealings with people I rarely <br/>
even think of that term.<br/>
