<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431219701">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
If you want to dig into some fascinating history, Time-Life Books has a<br/>
&quot;What Life Was Like&quot; series.  The other day I picked up a volume published<br/>
this year called:  &quot;What Life Was Like During the Age of Reason: France AD<br/>
1660-1800.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At that time, France was the most powerful nation in Europe and arguably the<br/>
world.  There is a large section on the Sun King (Louis the XIV) who reigned<br/>
for 72 years!  The book also covers the other royals, great thinkers,<br/>
artists, authors, musicians, etc. during that period.  The book traces the<br/>
events which led to the French Revolution and finishes with the rule of<br/>
Napolean Bonaparte.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few entertaining passages from the book:<br/>
<br/>
 On the adolescent king, Louis the XV:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The king&#39;s innermost thoughts and feelings might stay secret, but nothing<br/>
else about him did.  Virtually every aspect of his daily life was a public<br/>
spectacle, conducted under his courtiers&#39; fascinated gaze.  On some<br/>
occasions even the contents of his chamber pot became a subject for public<br/>
discussion.  The whole court, for instance, worried when their young<br/>
sovereign suffered an unpleasant bout of constipation.  Everyone applauded<br/>
when the royal physician announced that he had administered a laxative,<br/>
which, he declared, had caused &quot;a charming evacuation.&quot; pg. 27.<br/>
<br/>
On the ritual of the king going to bed:<br/>
(Note: this may sound ridiculous to us in 1999, but I&#39;d be willing to bet<br/>
that some of the ways people court favors and &quot;get ahead&quot; today will sound<br/>
just as ridiculous to future generations.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At night, the last act in the ritual drama of the royal day, the &#39;coucher,&#39;<br/>
was played out when His Majesty retired--officially, though not always<br/>
literally--for the night.  As in the morning, access to the State Bedchamber<br/>
was a heatedly sought-after privilege.  Inside the room itself, lifelong<br/>
enmities could be kindled between those who jockeyed for positions that<br/>
would bring them closest to the person of the king.  But only princes of the<br/>
blood and the holders of a few exalted offices--the Grand Chamberlain, the<br/>
First Gentleman of the Bedchamber, or the Grand Master of the Wardrobe--were<br/>
deemed worthy to hand the monarch his nightclothes.<br/>
<br/>
No prize was more avidly pursued than the right to hold the royal<br/>
candlestick and light the king&#39;s way to bed.  When everyone else was shooed<br/>
out of the State Bedchamber, only the recipient of this honor--chosen<br/>
nightly--was allowed to remain.  A shrewd courtier could use this moment of<br/>
unprecedented intimacy to make an impression, stand out from the crowd, and<br/>
ingratiate himself with his royal master.  It was an assignment coveted by<br/>
any ambitious nobleman, for the king granted favors only to people he knew.&quot;<br/>
pg. 28-29<br/>
