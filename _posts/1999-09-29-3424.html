<div id="ygrps-yiv-13852900">Howdy all!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how it happened but my 2 hs kids Brandon(7) and Kaela(5),<br/>
who have never been to a public school, need to be &#39;deschooled&#39; or<br/>
however you would say it.  Both of them think that if they are not doing<br/>
their textbooks or workbooks they are not &quot;doing &#39;school&#39;&quot;, especially<br/>
Kaela.    Brandon loves unschooling.  He learns so much on his own, but<br/>
he feels like he&#39;s not &quot;doing &#39;school&#39;&quot;.  I guess it is my fault they<br/>
feel like this.  For the last 2 yrs I have been hsing through the school<br/>
system (K-8 homestudy).  We had a wonderful teacher who would come out<br/>
to our house once a week and check Brandon&#39;s work.  He loved her!  And<br/>
Kaela was looking forward to having her come to the house to spend 1 on<br/>
1 time with her, too!  But this year I decided to try something<br/>
different and now I have my 5yr old thinking she isn&#39;t &#39;doing school&#39;<br/>
unless she has worked in her workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
How can a 5 yr old know what &quot;school&quot; is all about if she&#39;s never been?<br/>
She&#39;s never even been to preschool!  I guess this is the bad part of<br/>
kids teaching one another, huh?<br/>
