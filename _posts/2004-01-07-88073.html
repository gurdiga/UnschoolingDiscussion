<div id="ygrps-yiv-168937561">&lt;&lt; I would love to hear from anyone who has teenagers who are unschooling<br/>
 who <br/>
are doing cool things. They need not to be terrified of speaking in public, <br/>
and <br/>
need to be planning to attend the Unschooling Conference in August <br/>
(www.LiveandLearnConference.org) .  I have PLANS... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sigh...we aren&#39;t coming this year. Sorry. I&#39;m not sure what would count as cool things, Trevor is rather focused on video gaming as of late. He&#39;s beaten every Zelda game ever created so far...that&#39;s pretty cool.:)<br/>
Guitar is another focus, he&#39;s playing better every month, and never, ever been asked to practice once in his life. He positively loves his lessons with a very unschoolish kind of teacher that helps him learn any songs he&#39;s interested in.<br/>
He&#39;s really good at Yu-gi-oh, but so are a lot of kids. <br/>
The coolest thing about Trevor (to me) is how he knows SO much about a lot of different topics, especially things to do with technology. It never ceases to baffle me when he goes into detail about some new advancement or discovery that I know nothing about!<br/>
I&#39;m not sure any of that counts as anything dazzling to anyone else.<br/>
But if you want me to write real life accounts I&#39;d be happy to help. Sounds like you need real live teens though. Wah!<br/>
