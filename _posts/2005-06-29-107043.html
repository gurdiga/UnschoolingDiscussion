Subject: ABC TV would love to talk to you about unschooling<br/>
Date: Mon, 27 Jun 2005 19:23:52 -0400<br/>
From: &quot;Heather Teta&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:heather.teta@...">heather.teta@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To Whom It May Concern,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Heather Teta and I&#39;m working with ABC Television on several<br/>
of<br/>
our upcoming shows.  We&#39;re looking to feature unique families on our<br/>
shows<br/>
this season and when I came upon your website I knew you would be a<br/>
great<br/>
resource.  I was recently told about Unschooling and I find the<br/>
philosophy<br/>
fascinating - I truly think that it&#39;s a lifestyle that most of America<br/>
has<br/>
not really been exposed to and one that most would find very<br/>
intriguing.<br/>
So, I&#39;m asking for your help.  I would love to send an e-mail about<br/>
our<br/>
shows and the families that we&#39;re looking for to your database - or<br/>
even<br/>
have you post or distribute our information at your discretion.<br/>
Essentially<br/>
we&#39;re looking for two parent families with children ages 4 and older<br/>
that<br/>
might want to participate in our programs and educate America about<br/>
unschooling and the impact it&#39;s had on their children.  I would love<br/>
to<br/>
discuss this with you further so please call or give me a number where<br/>
I may<br/>
reach you at your convenience.  Hopefully I&#39;ll hear from you soon!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

Educate America about unschooling?  Yeah, right.  More like mock  and make <br/>
fools of unschoolers.  <br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;ve never watched an episode of Wife Swap -- or any of the other &#39;reality&#39; shows popping up everywhere in recent years -- so I have to ask what would make any show built on that premise &#39;fine?&#39;  I just don&#39;t get the whole reality TV craze -- I&#39;ve not seen anything even remotely &#39;real&#39; in any of the previews or snippets I&#39;ve seen from these shows.  They&#39;re more like train wrecks or freak shows, premiering the very worst of base behaviors, showcasing just how treacherous folks can be when the opportunity to &#39;win&#39; money is dangled in front of them.<br/>
 <br/>
The whole idea that a Mom would leave her kids and husband at the mercy of a complete stranger and a camera crew for two weeks for any reason is just beyond me.  To let anyone associated with that show be responsible for presenting unschoolers to the world sound like a huge risk of being outed as nutcases.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was contacted by a producer for Wife Swap about a year ago (something to do with the <br/>
fact that I skateboard in my living room). The guy tried to convince me this would be a <br/>
great thing, it would promote my book, and that they would pay me $5,000 to do it.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Five thousand dollars?&quot; I replied. &quot;Well, that just might cover the first month of <br/>
psychotherapy my family will need afterward...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when I told my TV-avoiding son and husband about it, they responded: &quot;What? <br/>
You turned him down?! Let&#39;s do it!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sigh...<br/>

I&#39;ve watched Wife Swap -- even enjoyed some -- but I still wouldn&#39;t call it a fine show from the standpoint that I don&#39;t feel the kids in the family have any choice about it happening.  Sure, some of the parents might actually get input from their kids, but I seriously doubt most do.  The lives of these children are totally disrupted...told they must follow the rules of the new mom....at what cost?<br/>

Our house is too small fortunately, but I think that the biggest challenge<br/>
for the poor woman who came here would be getting past James&#39; protective<br/>
instinct - he would arrange to be home for the whole time - that is one<br/>
thing for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure Sylvia was being pretty darn ironic in her categorization. <br/>
