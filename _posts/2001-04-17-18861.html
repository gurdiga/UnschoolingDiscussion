<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806361866">Last summer we moved to another county within the same state (FL).  At the time I didn&#39;t bother notifying the school officals of either county because our former county was very easy to get along with.<br/>
<br/>
Some points here for those not familiar with FL statues:  We maintain a portfolio with a log of activities, titles of items read, and samples of student produced materials.  And once a year we either participate in the county&#39;s testing, have a certified teacher test our children, or have a teacher evaluate our children (we opt for the final choice, of course).  The state has the right, with 15 days written notice, to review your child&#39;s portfolio.<br/>
<br/>
Our former county sent out 3 letters a year; 1. telling us when and where the county testing was, 2. reminding us when they would like us to have our evaluation results submitted, and 3. a letter confirming that the test/eval results were received and acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
THE POSSIBLE PROBLEM...<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to change counties until I found out more about the new one.  I figured that if they were harder to get along with we could use a family member&#39;s address in our old county.  From what I&#39;ve heard so far, I may have been right on.  We met up with a homeschool group that has PE at the park once a week (don&#39;t ask why they need to have PE, my kids do gymnastics in the living room, but the younger likes the playground and the older likes their games).  The parents were all talking about the end of the year testing and I found out that the county tells everyone that this is required.  When I mentioned the state law does not require this, one parent responded that she had never read the law (duh!).<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m getting at here (finally) is that if the county is doing this, then what else.  I called the county office to ask about homeschooling and the woman on the other end said the requirements were too lengthy to go over on the phone.  Huh?  This is FL.  I just gave the run down of the state law in one paragraph.  She said she could send me a &#39;registration package.&#39;  No &#39;registration&#39; is required in the state, only a letter of intent with the children&#39;s names, birthdate, and physical address.<br/>
<br/>
Do I stay with our previous county and chance getting caught - and even if I do, what could anyone do, we ARE still on record with someone???  Or do I chance it with the new county?  I don&#39;t want to lay low and home no one notices us.  Our younger wants to play t-ball and our 9 year old and me are wanting to start a 4H club.  So were are not the type to hide in the woods, although that thought has crossed my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Well????????????</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927434053">I live in FL as well, and have found out just how uninformed most counties <br/>
are as far as the law is concerned.  Which county do you live in?  My <br/>
advice would be to go ahead and register in that county, print out a copy <br/>
of the law (the six requirements are usually enough) and keep it handy <br/>
along with any letters you might have received from your previous county (I <br/>
have mine on my fridge, ready to grab at a moments notice).  There is a <br/>
Florida home education law group at Yahoo which I belong to that helps <br/>
those with counties that have no clue get one real fast :).  These folks <br/>
know the law and if you have trouble just post it to the list and they will <br/>
help.  If you need anything else just holler :).<br/>

<br/>
I would get their registration packet, but any item they request which the <br/>
law doesn&#39;t require, put &quot;not required&quot; in the blank, and staple that copy of <br/>
the laws to it.<br/>
<br/>
Or fill out the forms.  Get them notarized,  but don&#39;t mail them in.  Keep a <br/>
photocopy.  If they ask for your forms, give them a photocopy of your copy.  <br/>
They&#39;ll think they lost it the first time.  You&#39;ll have registered (late, on <br/>
demand).  <br/>
