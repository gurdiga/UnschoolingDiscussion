&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dear Friends,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    The following is something I wrote for another list a few weeks ago.  It<br/>
&gt; is about my son, Colton, who is 9 1/2.  I thought it might speak to the<br/>
&gt; hearts of moms who have kids growing up way too fast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    This is perhaps a tacky story to tell you, but if I can&#39;t vent to my<br/>
&gt; kindred spirits I will surely go mad.  We have noticed some changes in<br/>
&gt; Colton<br/>
&gt; lately.  He has been emotional and moody.  He can spit out his words with<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; speed of an auctioneer.  He can captain a debating team.  He can hold my<br/>
&gt; hand<br/>
&gt; one minute and be rolling his eyes at me the next.  Bud and I have wondered<br/>
&gt; what is going on with him.  We have even gone so far as to ask, &quot;OK, so who<br/>
&gt; are you, REALLY?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    I finally have it figured out.  I can sum up the changes in one single,<br/>
&gt; horrifying word...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    ...puberty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s how the mystery was solved.  As Colton was about to take a shower<br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; night, I heard him yank back the shower curtain.  Then he yelled for my<br/>
&gt; help.<br/>
&gt;  I ran up to his bathroom to find him naked as the day he was born (only<br/>
&gt; considerably taller), clutching the shower curtain rod in his hands.  This<br/>
&gt; was nothing new to me because I&#39;ve experienced it too; the rod will fall<br/>
&gt; right off the wall if you pull too hard on the curtain.  While I was putting<br/>
&gt; the curtain rod back up, I smelled an unmistakable odor.  Was it really?<br/>
&gt; Could it be?  YES, it was.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    SWEAT!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    It didn&#39;t take long to pinpoint where the odor was coming from, since I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; just had my shower.  I congratulated Colton on growing up, found him a stick<br/>
&gt; deodorant in a manly &quot;cool breeze&quot; scent and told him how to use it.  Then I<br/>
&gt; set the deodorant on his bathroom counter, right next to the bottle of hair<br/>
&gt; gel which has recently taken up residence.  Yes, Colton is now *styling* his<br/>
&gt; hair, whereas six months ago he rarely combed it.  He wears it in a style I<br/>
&gt; think of as &quot;shiny bedhead,&quot; but my son assures me this is &quot;cool.&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t know, as I haven&#39;t been cool in 400 years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    Intellectually, I knew my son was growing up.  But I don&#39;t think with my<br/>
&gt; head, I think with my heart.  And my heart is several years behind.  So if<br/>
&gt; you see me this week, give me a comforting hug.  Here is how you will<br/>
&gt; recognize me: there will be tears in my eyes and I&#39;ll be holding Colton&#39;s<br/>
&gt; old<br/>
&gt; teddy bear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Blessings,<br/>
&gt; Carol<br/>

You know...here is one good thing about what you all are going through....&nbsp;
Those of us with younger kids are suddenly fine with the jelly all over
the counter (and dripping down the cabinets), and the huge pile of pillows,
blankets and babies in the hall where two of them slept last night, and
the huge piles of dirty clothes that aren&#39;t really dirty, and the wet towels
on the bathroom floor, and the fact that I had two kids in my bed last
night...again.
<br>So, thanks from me and the other mother&#39;s with little ones, who sometimes
get overwhelmed and forget they really are going to grow up, and we are
going to miss all this chaos.
