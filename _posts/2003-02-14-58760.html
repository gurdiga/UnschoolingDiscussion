&lt;&lt; And let&#39;s give that over-taxed mom of <br/>
 the special kid a break when maybe her fingers fly a little too fast <br/>
 in defensive-mode on the keyboard when someone suggests that her kids <br/>
 tantrums are her fault. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No one said &quot;it&#39;s your fault&quot;.....it was suggested that genetics OR modeling <br/>
MAY be to blame.<br/>
I don&#39;t see how a person could feel it&#39;s their fault for genetics, even tough <br/>
it technically is. We aren&#39;t exactly in control of that, why would it make a <br/>
person feel blamed? sheesh.<br/>
And I think most all of us would admit to modeling some bad behavior to our <br/>
children at some point, or not modeling the best way to deal with certain <br/>
things. <br/>
I don&#39;t see why that would make a person ballistic. But hey, I guess it&#39;s <br/>
harder for some to admit their weaknesses.<br/>
I&#39;ve certainly seen some rotten behavior from my children that looks EXACTLY <br/>
like one of the traits I&#39;ve modeled for them...another reason to be more <br/>
aware.<br/>
And there has been story after story from parents here that are dealing with <br/>
special needs children.<br/>
So there&#39;s plenty  of first hand experiences being shared.<br/>
<br/>
And some of us that don&#39;t have incredibly difficult children just might have <br/>
experience with it anyway.....<br/>
I have experience with a brother that has FAS, was diagnosed with severe ADD <br/>
and is in and out of the prison system.<br/>
I have friends and family with very highs needs/intense personalities.<br/>
Just because a person does not have a child of their own with the exact same <br/>
difficulties, does not make them an idiot unworthy of contributing to the <br/>
discussion!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; This is a perfect example of exactly why the special needs label is so <br/>
 worthless here. When people talk about how the established facts change <br/>
 - I bet they are thinking about the more nebulous kinds of diagnoses - <br/>
 like ADD or ADHD or &quot;learning disabled.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and I thought it was made very clear in earlier posts that we were <br/>
discussing  these nebulous labels as NOT being true disabilities.<br/>
What Debbie was describing are very real disabilities.<br/>
But unschooling is STILL the answer in my opinion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I am tired, exhausted actually, of posting to this list.  You guys can <br/>
have a big old celebration that I am outta here.     But, being the stubborn <br/>
bull headed person that I am (yeah, I, AM things.. and NOT the lists of <br/>
derogatory insults I&#39;ve been accused of being)  <br/>
<br/>
I am well aware that lots of folks have misdiagnosed their children  with <br/>
&quot;nebulous labels&quot; But for you to say &quot;these nebulous labels as NOT being true <br/>
disabilities&quot; is downright ridiculous.  Its a slap in the face to parents who <br/>
children REALLY ARE ADHD or LD.  You can pretend these conditions don&#39;t <br/>
exist, but it certainly doesn&#39;t help anyone deal with &quot;what the hell ever&quot; <br/>
you want to call them.  There are physiological aspects of these disorders.  <br/>
You know, that brain scan, CAT scan, MIR, medical research stuff they do????? <br/>
   It&#39;s not that every child diagnosed with &quot;these nebulous labels&quot; is just <br/>
an active, high strung, high needs kid. Yeah, some of them are. but some of <br/>
them REALLY TRULY have malfunctions in their brains that they cannot control. <br/>
   Its like saying. Oh, that kid could hear if he just tried hard enough. OR <br/>
more often on this list.. &quot;that kid could hear if his parents just did the <br/>
right things to help him&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have mercy on the next poor soul who tries to join this list.. I already see <br/>
a few newcomers whom I expect won&#39;t last long.  No need to reply to this.. <br/>

You know, that brain scan, CAT scan, MIR, medical research stuff they do????? <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can do brain scans on everyone.  If a large percentage of people have <br/>
similar traits, that doesn&#39;t make it &quot;a disorder.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is probably the best thing you can do for kids with the traits <br/>
you&#39;re discussing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;   It&#39;s not that every child diagnosed with &quot;these nebulous labels&quot; is just <br/>

them REALLY TRULY have malfunctions in their brains that they cannot control. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And?<br/>
It doesn&#39;t change that letting each of them learn in his own way at his own <br/>
pace is a great way to handle it!   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Its like saying. Oh, that kid could hear if he just tried hard enough. OR <br/>
more often on this list.. &quot;that kid could hear if his parents just did the <br/>
right things to help him&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
An LD or ADD kid can learn fine if parents don&#39;t try to play school with him.<br/>
<br/>
A deaf kid can learn fine if communication is established with him and <br/>
someone helps him learn in his own way at his own pace.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
From before any one person joins until long after, replies to a discussion <br/>
list like this are for the benefit of all the readers (1100 on this list?) <br/>
not just for one person.<br/>

<br/>
It *is* probably the best choice for allowing an already restricted (by his <br/>
body) child the ability to learn and do and experience what he can out of <br/>
life without arbitrary schoo/society imposed restrictions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if no one minds, I&#39;ll reply to the ideas stated here, and not the <br/>
poster, here or not. Just like I always do. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;But for you to say &quot;these nebulous labels as NOT being true disabilities&quot; <br/>

<br/>
I think those letters are absolutely disabling conditions if a child is in <br/>
school. Whatever brain pattern and temperment those kinds of kids came into <br/>
the world with have been proven not to fit with the school model. Those kids <br/>
will indeed need help getting through a regular school day.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...when you take school out of the picture, when you try to custom make a <br/>
life towards helping a particular child live in their world and their body, <br/>
then it&#39;s not a disabling factor in their life. It&#39;s just  their life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;You can pretend these conditions don&#39;t exist, but it certainly doesn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shifting our perceptions and strongly held beliefs is hard. Each one of us <br/>
here has done it to a certain degree. I think that sharing story after story <br/>
of how school given labels stopped mattering after a certain time out of <br/>
school are very helpful. JMHO based on years of observation, experience and <br/>
feedback.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;There are physiological aspects of these disorders. You know, that brain <br/>
&gt;&gt;scan, CAT scan, MIR, medical research stuff they do?????&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never heard of a physiological test for LD,ADD, ADHD, or DIS. <br/>
Everything I&#39;ve seen is always a symptom checklist. Can anyone elighten me?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It&#39;s not that every child diagnosed with &quot;these nebulous labels&quot; is just <br/>
&gt;&gt;an active, high strung, high needs kid.&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope. They&#39;re just kids. They&#39;re just Conor and Casey and Roxana and Jake <br/>
and Kirby and.....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Yeah, some of them are. but some of them REALLY TRULY have malfunctions in <br/>
&gt;&gt;their brains that they cannot control.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If we want to say they can&#39;t control anything, they why bother trying? <br/>
They&#39;re just kids. Let&#39;s not write them off just yet.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is such a true statement.  My nephew was labeled ADHD, and he did have <br/>
all the classic symptoms that come with the label.  But he was sooo into <br/>
electronics a few years back.  Loved to take apart telephones and radios and <br/>
put them back together.  I got my hands on an old erector set for Christmas <br/>
and he loved that.  No directions just making things on his own.  So creative <br/>
and passionate.  He has always had his own &quot;junk pile&quot; his parents did allow <br/>
that.  He collected scraps from everything to put into new &quot;inventions&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
The school system was another story, of course he didn&#39;t fit into that mold.  <br/>
Couldn&#39;t sit still for hours couldn&#39;t finish reports on time, etc., etc.  But <br/>
his parents were so convinced that school had the answers.  He is now in high <br/>
school.  Believes himself to be stupid and the family and school are working <br/>
toward training him to hold a job at McDs.  <br/>
<br/>
He could have been so much more, he was/is such a caring intelligent <br/>
individual.  He just wasn&#39;t allowed to follow his passion because it <br/>
interfered with his education.  It stood in the way of him learning long <br/>
division by age 18.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someday he will rediscover that passion that the system took away.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My nephew, Erik, had all the issues you describe and more. School was hell <br/>
and they had social services involved because the administrators were so <br/>
convinced of this child&#39;s inherant &quot;badness.&quot; With his mother&#39;s support, he <br/>
homeschooled high school and then opted out completely at 16. Took him years <br/>
to come out of his funk. He thought he was stupid. He&#39;s brilliant. He <br/>
thought he had no talent. He&#39;s an accomplished artist. He was dark and goth <br/>
and pierced and depressed.<br/>
<br/>
I talked to his mom yesterday. At 19 he has just been accepted to study at a <br/>
Buddhist retreat Northern CA. He has found himself again. It&#39;s inspiring.<br/>
