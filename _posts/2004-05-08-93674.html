<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968145133">Hello,<br/>
Just wanted to add a little clarification.<br/>
Pin worms (fecal-oral route) can only come from human exposure.  (You can&#39;t get it from animal feces.) One usually gets it from other kids. Each species has its own. Same with lice BTW.<br/>
Ringworm, a fungus, usually in cool dark places.  Likes hair follicles and hairshaft.  It would not be very happy on your feet.  Most common carrier are kittens/cats (in my area).  It is usually self-limiting.  People with suppressed immune systems /sensitive skin are at highest risk. <br/>
Roundworms and Hookworms have larvae stages that are sometimes found in animal feces (even wild animals).  They can penetrate the skin, travel through the body and cause problems because humans are not the natural host.  This is very, very rare however. <br/>

And the pinworm eggs are very sticky. Which makes it easy for someone around<br/>
infected people to get them and ingest them. Another good argument for<br/>
washing hands. I&#39;ve never know anyone with pinworms but I hear it&#39;s actually<br/>
quite common.<br/>

It is actually happy on your feet. But only *athlete&#39;s feet*!!!!!!<br/>

Both of those can also be ingested as well.<br/>
