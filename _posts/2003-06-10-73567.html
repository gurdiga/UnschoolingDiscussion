<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704977812">&quot;Enthusiastic, imaginative, will help anyone with a problem, <br/>
improvise rather than prepare in advance, high spirited, may <br/>
procrastinate, may overlook relevant details, may overextend, <br/>
often a spokesperson for values relating to people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No wonder we ENFPs rack up the highest number of posts on <br/>
bulletin boards and email loops! LOL This description is so <br/>
accurate to me (as I sit in an office surrounded by checks, <br/>
papers, CDs, books and clutter on all surfaces). I&#39;d much rather <br/>
write emails to people in need than deal with those &quot;relevant <br/>
details.&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
My favorite famous ENFP is Bono, from U2. He&#39;s a crusading, <br/>
idealistic, artistic, performer!<br/>
