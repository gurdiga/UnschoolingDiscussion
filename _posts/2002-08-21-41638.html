<div id="ygrps-yiv-683738180">&lt;&lt;&lt;I frankly don&#39;t care if you sit on the couch all day and watch TV, its your business not mine. My only thought is what about the kids. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just a word about reading and tv......<br/>
My son had all the help in the world to learn to read.  He was in school 1/2 year in kindergarten, homeschooled a year ( we used 100 Easy Lessons), then he went back to school for last half of 1st grade and all of 2nd, and 3rd.  (He will not return to school unless he chooses to go.)  He &#39;learned&#39; to read on his own by watching tv.  Yes, .....tv.  Last summer(he was 8) he wanted to know when his favorite shows would be on so he learned to read the TV Guide channel.  I was so surprised!  He still doesn&#39;t like to read books, unless it&#39;s to his younger sister at her request, but he will read magazines such as &quot;Outdoor Life&quot;, and any comic book he can get his hands on.  Due to his poor reading skills in 2nd grade, the school put him in an afterschool program to help him with reading for 3rd. Well, since he taught himself during the summer, he had surpassed his other &#39;remedial&#39; classmates and is now an excellent reader.  He is very proud of that story!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son, Liam, is also learning to read by watching TV.  I had turned on the <br/>
closed caption feature of the TV because I couldn&#39;t catch the lyrics to a <br/>
song on one of the shows he was watching and he and I wondered about <br/>
them.  I had left the CC feature on and forgot about it.  I had turned it <br/>
off when my husband had rented a video and he found the CC <br/>
distracting.  Sure enough, Liam complained that it was off and wanted it <br/>
back on.  He likes to watch certain tapes over and over again, and he is <br/>
recognizing words (like &quot;pleasure&quot;) from seeing the words as they&#39;re spoken <br/>
on his favorite Power Rangers tapes (he knows the dialogue by heart).  He <br/>
also loves for me to read to him, and while he is no reader right now, I <br/>
have no doubt at all that he will be when he is ready to be; this list has <br/>
shown me over and over again what the meaning is of &quot;live and let live.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I had forgotten about doing that!  My daughter 6 1/2 is still very unsure about her reading skills and that would be an easy way to help her out a little.  My son liked to have that on when he was younger also but we haven&#39;t in a while because it&#39;s sometimes too distracting for me......thanks for reminding me about that Marji!<br/>

Lions&quot; on PBS.<br/>
<br/>
I just love that show.  It was very gentle and entertaining and there <br/>
was never any mention of school.  And the family LIVES TOGETHER IN THE <br/>
LIBRARY!  How cool is that?!<br/>

Well, some days that has been &quot;all&quot; we do - except its usually vidoes of our choice, not TV. Since unschooling &quot;in full&quot; from January on, my kids have just needed time out - and have been filling up on videos and computer games. And you would be surprised at what the yare learning, at the relationship we are building together, at what the videos and games lead to...Even if they didn&#39;t lead to anything, just the positive time spent together, the snuggling time, the enhancement of our relationships , makes it worthwhile....Leonie<br/>

throat and that any more reading that night would have to be done by <br/>
him.  (As far as she knew, he wasn&#39;t yet reading.)  He picked up the (hard) <br/>
book and started reading.  When she looked at him in shock and asked him <br/>
when he had learned to read he said, &quot;I only just figured out that I could.&quot;<br/>
