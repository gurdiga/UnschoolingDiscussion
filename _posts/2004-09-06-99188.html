<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806066218">&lt;&lt;And, I seem to have a secret respect for book-learning <br/>
and a secret disrespect for unschooling (at least the media-drenched <br/>
parts).  And these attitudes are tied to my ankles like a noisy string <br/>
of tin cans.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any comforting words?  Or, perhaps, a virtual kick in the pants? &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t find the original of that, just the really cool responses.  <br/>
<br/>
I did want to add that I have plans for a page about the problem of book <br/>
worship.  I love books myself, and I try to fight that snobbery and prejudice <br/>
which is so unfounded about their value over other things.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Look at the bottom.  <br/>
That (and it partly embarrasses me) is the image I have on my main <br/>
unschooling page.  I like the idea.  It&#39;s a colored-up (by me) version of a traditional <br/>
(I think) piece of art I&#39;ve seen in other versions over my life, of knowledge <br/>
shown as a tree growing with its roots in and around a book.  I have since I <br/>
was a teenager had bookplates with that art from Antioch books (so if I make <br/>
this a review maybe I&#39;m not so deeply into copyright violation if it is their <br/>
special art).<br/>
<br/>
I can understand book worship as an early medieval thing, when a book was <br/>
handwritten and nobody would bother unless the information contained were <br/>
extremely valuable.  But nowadays...   that gateway is long gone.  And I know Bible <br/>
literalists (some were my relatives) who worship the Bible (King Jame&#39;s <br/>
Version) itself as their one physical link to God, and as the literal, actual word of <br/>
literal, actual God, as though it were a personalized autograph.  (Brother <br/>
John Quincy: love ya, but I&#39;d kill ya in a heartbeat, God)  [My uncle who was a <br/>
Baptist preacher was named John Quincy, and he was my dad&#39;s youngest brother, <br/>
and you probably don&#39;t have to guess hard what my maiden name was.]<br/>
<br/>
So I think that for some people the awe of universities and higher degrees <br/>
and caps and gowns and of the Bible and of people who can read Greek and Latin, <br/>
all that gets wadded up in a knot of brain cells that flash &quot;books are <br/>
awesome&quot; and put all else in shadow. <br/>
