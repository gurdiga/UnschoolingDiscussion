<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208244335"><p>What would help your daughter feel more secure in her ability to say no? Ask your daughter. Would it help to &quot;make a rule&quot; that all playdates happen only at your house, never at the other girl&#39;s? Would it help to &quot;make a rule&quot; that they can&#39;t play behind closed doors?<br><br>&nbsp;I&#39;m putting &quot;make a rule&quot; in quotes because while it certainly would be a rule, it would be something you and your daughter are agreeing on as a way for her to feel more comfortable playing with this friend. Your daughter doesn&#39;t have to say why there&#39;s a new rule - it&#39;s entirely plausible to most kids that parents come up with weird new rules at random, or because of something they saw on tv or read in a magazine.</p></div>
