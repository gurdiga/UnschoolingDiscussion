group has a time set aside for us to play there on the gymnastics stuff, but<br/>
there used to be a school group there before us. When it was time to go,<br/>
they blow whistles and line the kids up and stuff. Well, one day this kid<br/>
was just melting down, about 6 years old. He was yelling &quot;I *hate* having to<br/>
do what you say! I *hate* going back to school&quot;, etc. and the teacher looked<br/>
at all of us adults standing there and must&#39;ve thought we would be allies.<br/>
He started telling the kid &quot;Well, you just have to do this. That&#39;s the way<br/>
it is.&quot; and he stated &quot;All kids have to do this.&quot; and he looked at me and<br/>
said &quot;Isn&#39;t that right?&quot; as if I would back him up. I just said &quot;Don&#39;t look<br/>
at any of us, our kids are homeschooling.&quot; Boy did he look frustrated. It<br/>
*is* sad that so many kids have to deal with the lies that this stuff is<br/>
necessary.<br/>

<br/>
That is just too funny.<br/>
<br/>
One of the nicest things I&#39;m finding about homeschooling is <br/>
the &quot;Heck, we can always do it tomorrow&quot; change in life attitude.  <br/>
Ok, that does explain why the pile of laundry is as tall as the seven <br/>
year old, but....we are all so much more relaxed.<br/>

That&#39;s happened with me, but with my own kids, not others.  The biggest was <br/>
the karate teacher, when Kirby was little, one day saying &quot;Well just like <br/>
school, sometimes you have to...&quot; and I was shrugging and shaking my head <br/>
slowly behind Kirby&#39;s back where the teacher could see me.  Kirby was looking <br/>
blankly at him.   So seeing that regular example didn&#39;t apply, he started <br/>
another trail, and said &quot;But even with homeschooling, you have to be prepared <br/>
for tests and...&quot; and I&#39;m shaking my head behind the kid again.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t have any leverage whatsoever in using &quot;this is just another of the <br/>
many things you HAVE to do.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
So he had to figure out how to inspire Kirby with REAL reasons!  (And he did, <br/>
and Kirby&#39;s still at that school and really liking it.)<br/>
