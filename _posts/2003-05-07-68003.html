I&#39;m thinking they believe kind of as (U.S.) Presbyterians do, but I could be <br/>
wrong.<br/>
You can look presbyterian up online.  There are lots of comparative religions <br/>

<br/>
Church of England is &quot;Episcopal&quot; here.<br/>

Yeah...you&#39;re almost as bad as the Catholics...maybe as bad;  but,  on<br/>
