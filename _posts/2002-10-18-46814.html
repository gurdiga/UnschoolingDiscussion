<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889092266">I&#39;m struggling with my 9 year old daughter, and her behaviors.  It is <br/>
usually bad attitude or disrespect.  Yelling, door slamming, refusing <br/>
to do something she&#39;s asked.  (Brushing her teeth, remember?)<br/>
<br/>
I had posted earlier in the week, regarding some of the same issues.  <br/>
I got lots of don&#39;t ask her to do anything, bribe her to do things or <br/>
go places, brush my teeth with her - (she&#39;s not 3, she&#39;s 9.  This <br/>
game won&#39;t work with her), etc.  Ugh!  I am still frustrated, having <br/>
not yet found a solution that works for me/us.<br/>
<br/>
I feel there should be consequences to her actions.  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
listening to her be disrespectful and rude, then take her for an ice <br/>
cream 5 minutes later.  It seems as though I would be rewarding her <br/>
inappropriate behavior.  &quot;Oh sure honey, you can have a sleepover, <br/>
even though you screamed at me, and slammed your door!  In fact, have <br/>
2 friends over!&quot;  :)<br/>
<br/>
There are certain, reasonable behaviors I expect.  I&#39;m not talking <br/>
about making the bed, chores etc.  I&#39;m getting over the messy room, <br/>
I&#39;ve asked her to close the door.  I get stressed to go into a messy <br/>
room, so I just won&#39;t go in - problem solved.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about kindness and respect.  I don&#39;t care if we&#39;re <br/>
unschooling, homeschooling, or public schooling, she doesn&#39;t need to <br/>
be disrupting the family, and disrespecting or hurting anyone.  (We <br/>
are unschooling and loving it, by the way!)  :)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t pretend she isn&#39;t doing it, or ignore it.  I can&#39;t bribe her <br/>
not to do it.  She&#39;s a very bright 9, I can&#39;t trick her into it.  <br/>
<br/>
The only solution I see, is consequences.  Let her know up front what <br/>
the consequences will be, maybe even have HER come up with them.  <br/>
Then she knows.  Then she&#39;s making the choice.  <br/>
<br/>
Need more advice!  <br/>
Thanks in advance.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297204827">I think people yell when they feel like they are not being heard.   I<br/>
think she&#39;s frustrated and slamming doors because you&#39;re not hearing her.<br/>
 <br/>
Nine is still nine, she&#39;s a kid, not a grown up.   She may not yet know<br/>
all the ways to tell you with words how she&#39;s feeling.  She&#39;s doing her<br/>
damndest to communicate with you and YOU are the one who&#39;s not getting<br/>
it.    She doesn&#39;t want to feel bad.  She doesn&#39;t want you to feel bad<br/>
about her.  <br/>
You have to listen to her.  You have to listen to what she can&#39;t say. <br/>
She is really trying to reach you.  You have to be the one with enough<br/>
maturity to decode her message.<br/>
<br/>
In you&#39;re first post you referred to her as gifted and then you said she<br/>
feels bad when violin doesn&#39;t go perfectly.   She might be having an<br/>
impossible time living up to everyone&#39;s expectation of a gifted daughter.<br/>
 <br/>
You should think about this.<br/>
Does she feel like you expect a certain standard from her?<br/>
Does she feel like she has to be perfect to get your approval?<br/>
Does she feel that if she fails she&#39;s let you down?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how such a label can be helpful to a child in any way.  I<br/>
think it can be hugely oppressive.  Maybe you should work on getting rid<br/>
of that whole gifted thing and see if that helps.  <br/>
<br/>
Children need the freedom to make mistakes without feeling like they&#39;ll<br/>
lose their parents love.  If you punish her for getting angry or<br/>
frustrated, she may think you&#39;re withholding affection because you&#39;re<br/>
disappointed that your &quot;gifted&quot; daughter failed to do something<br/>
perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
There may be some benefit to quiet communication about what upsets her.  <br/>
Ask what you can do to make her feel happier.  She might not know at<br/>
first, but keep talking about it when things are calm.   Kids learn about<br/>
expressing emotion like they learn everything else, on their own<br/>
schedules.  It takes time.<br/>
<br/>
People talk to kids about respect a lot.  But if a child never personally<br/>
receives respect it&#39;s hard to know how to give it.  Think about how much<br/>
respect she gets as a member of your family and see if you are<br/>
demonstrating the kind of consideration you&#39;d like her to have for you. <br/>
These things can be reciprocal.   <br/>
<br/>
I hope you go back and read some of the responses to your other post.  <br/>
Someone who is upset and frustrated doesn&#39;t need to be punished, they<br/>
need love and understanding.  She needs you to help her cope with her<br/>
strong emotions and she needs to know you love her no matter what. <br/>
Punishment accomplishes neither of those things. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing here is that frustration IS the natural consequence of<br/>
continual disappointment.  Anger IS the natural consequence of being<br/>
misunderstood or treated unfairly.  She knows all about consequences. <br/>
You want to set her up with unnatural consequences (punishment) and you<br/>
will only make it worse, and asking her to help you treat her unfairly is<br/>
a terrible idea.   Kids hurt themselves all the time over emotional<br/>
problems and I don&#39;t think you want to go there.   She should NOT be made<br/>
to punish herself so YOU can claim it was her choice. <br/>

<br/>
There are consequences for parental actions too, and it&#39;s likely that her <br/>
behavior is in response to the way she has been treated thusfar.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
listening to her be disrespectful and rude, then take her for an ice <br/>

<br/>
Seems maybe, by the messages many of us got growing up, and by the <br/>
justifications teachers and parents used for being separate from  us.<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion was not about ice cream itself (and it wasn&#39;t my suggestion) <br/>
but about being with your daughter, being her partner and her defender, <br/>
instead of her judge and her antagonist.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The only solution I see, is consequences.  Let her know up front what <br/>
the consequences will be, maybe even have HER come up with them.  <br/>
Then she knows.  Then she&#39;s making the choice.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids in psych studies have come up with worse &quot;consequences&quot; than adults in <br/>
many cases.  Saying if she names her own punishment that it&#39;s her doing is <br/>
not right either.  If someone has a choice between being hit with a paddle or <br/>
a belt, that&#39;s not much choice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that you were planning to hit her.  I&#39;m saying that your <br/>
decision that there will be punishment is the big decision.  Letting her <br/>
decide the detals doesn&#39;t make the punishment her doing.<br/>
<br/>
Men who abuse their partners say &quot;I told her what would happen if she didn&#39;t <br/>
come home on time.  It&#39;s HER fault I hit her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t pretend she isn&#39;t doing it, or ignore it.  I can&#39;t bribe her <br/>
not to do it.  She&#39;s a very bright 9, I can&#39;t trick her into it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was nine my mother threw away a set of little child psychology <br/>
pamphlets.  I had found them and was reading them and she said no, and hid <br/>
them.  Next time she was gone I got them aain to see what was so powerfully <br/>
worth hiding.  It was some Art Linkletter booklets about stages of child <br/>
development.  My mom was afraid if I read those I would know more than she <br/>
did and be able to trick her and get my way.  So rather than reading the <br/>
books and thinking about what that meant in our relationship and how she <br/>
could maybe use research to be a better mom, she threw the books away.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds from what we&#39;ve read here that you&#39;ve decided she&#39;s a bad girl and <br/>
she&#39;s acting out the role you&#39;ve given her.  If you don&#39;t want to be closer <br/>
to her or model more loving behavior or loosen up on your expectations, then <br/>
you will cling to your problem and probably make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s only nine.  It&#39;s not too late to baby her a little and earn her trust <br/>
and love and real respect.  There is something she&#39;s trying to express by <br/>
being rude.  She&#39;s not happy for some reason.  Making her more unhappy won&#39;t <br/>
solve your problem.  It won&#39;t make you happier either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433198672">Are you saying that you never provide consequences or &quot;punishments&quot; <br/>
for inappropriate behaviors?  Would you let your children, for <br/>
instance, swear at an adult, or punch holes in your walls if <br/>
they &quot;needed&quot;  or &quot;wanted&quot; to?  What about tattoos, piercings or <br/>
shoplifting?  When do you finally step in?  I am curious as to who <br/>
runs your household, you or the children?  When they are adults, will <br/>
they know how to deal with &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;restrictions&quot; in their job, or <br/>
life?  Or will they just do what they please, never considering <br/>
anyone else?  There will certainly be consequences when he tells his <br/>
boss, &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned in an earlier posting that she is gifted, because she <br/>
seems to have a problem with perfection.  Most everything comes very <br/>
easily for her, so when something DOESN&#39;T - she flips.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how to deal with it.  I have had SO many talks with her, <br/>
encouraging her, explaining how well she&#39;s doing, and even the <br/>
professional musicians don&#39;t do it perfectly... etc etc to make her <br/>
understand, and to STOP being so hard on herself.  When she&#39;s <br/>
practicing, I continually tell her how well she&#39;s doing (even when it <br/>
isn&#39;t perfect!)  She is loved unconditionally, and she knows that.   <br/>
<br/>
Just a FYI - I had a few people email me OFF LIST, with actual <br/>
SUPPORT, in agreement with reasonable consequences.  They didn&#39;t want <br/>
to post publicly, for fear of people attacking them for their views. <br/>
<br/>
Very interesting...<br/>

practicing, I continually tell her how well she&#39;s doing (even when it <br/>
isn&#39;t perfect!) We&#39;ve talked about how everyone has strengths and <br/>
weaknesses, that everyone is different.  <br/>
<br/>
Before she started taking the violin, we didn&#39;t know if that, too, <br/>
would come easily.  We talked about how if she wanted to do it, she <br/>
could.  She can do anything she puts her mind to.  We talked about <br/>
how she may have a &quot;gift&quot; for music, it might come easily, or she <br/>
might not, and she would have to work a bit harder.  Either way, if <br/>
she put forth the effort, she could do it.  <br/>
<br/>
She is loved unconditionally, and she knows that.  She knows she can <br/>
give it up at any time if she wants, she has the freedom to choose.<br/>
<br/>
The violin was one example.  My husband just asked her to please run <br/>
downstairs and turn off the tv, because we were all getting settled <br/>
down for bed.  She simply didn&#39;t feel like it, so she huffed, and was <br/>
rude.  She simply didn&#39;t want to be bothered.  That is often the <br/>
reason.  &quot;Oh honey, would you put that in the trash instead of <br/>
leaving it on the counter?&quot;  might result in stomping, or even <br/>
yelling.  &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot; she&#39;ll rant.  <br/>
<br/>
Different kids have different personalities.  Some are more &quot;strong <br/>
willed&quot; than others.  Some are very agreeable to everything, mine is <br/>
not.  <br/>

than you do, but maybe I can offer some suggestions for what they&#39;re <br/>
worth. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you can pinpoint *why* she is acting the way she is?  I know <br/>
in our family, we had a major breakthrough in doing this.  My 5 year <br/>
old was constantly beating on his 9 yo sister and messing up her <br/>
projects.  I finally figured out that he was doing it because he <br/>
wanted someone to play with, and when she was busy doing her own <br/>
thing, he acted out to get attention from her.  Now I know that I <br/>
need to give him a little more attention throughout the day and it <br/>
has cut down on the picking on his sister.  For us, this was a HUGE <br/>
breakthrough.  <br/>
<br/>
Once in awhile lately my daughter has been talking to me just a <br/>
little bit cocky.  I think it&#39;s hormones kicking in.  Usually all I <br/>
have to do is look at her and honestly tell her that it makes me sad <br/>
when she talks to me like that.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102797039">Thanks, Sheila, the nicest post yet!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I THINK I have it pinpointed, in that it seems to be a perfection <br/>
issue.  Since most things come very easily for her, when something <br/>
DOESN&#39;T, she doesn&#39;t know how to deal with it.  We&#39;ve talked about it <br/>
on numerous occasions.  She agrees that because most things come so <br/>
easily to her, she feels &quot;stupid&quot; when she can&#39;t do something.  Logic <br/>
tells her she&#39;s not really stupid, but she&#39;s so frustrated at the <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
I have tried so hard to encourage her, and to make her feel better <br/>
when she&#39;s feeling frustrated.  Her mood can switch like a <br/>
lightswitch when she gets frustrated from something.  She can go from <br/>
happy-go-lucky to hostile.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be playing the violin, and I&#39;ll tell her how nice it sounds, <br/>
and she&#39;ll get frustrated anyway, because it wasn&#39;t perfect.  I&#39;ll <br/>
tell her it sounded great to me, but that doesn&#39;t help.  I&#39;ll ask her <br/>
what SHE thought was wrong, and she might say it was too fast or <br/>
slow, so I&#39;ll suggest she try it again, or something like that.   I&#39;M <br/>
GOING TO!  She&#39;ll yell.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to help her when she&#39;s frustrated, but I&#39;m not sure how.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be happy until she DOES play the song perfectly, <br/>
so trying again seems the only option.  I have suggested she put it <br/>
away for awhile, and try later (a fresh start), but she gets mad at <br/>
that too.  She&#39;s upset with herself, about her playing, but lashes <br/>
out at anyone around.  I&#39;ve tried ignoring her attitude, but it&#39;s no <br/>
better.  <br/>
<br/>
But, her attitude can come, often, from not wanting to be bothered.  <br/>
Not wanting to contribute.  Not wanting to make an effort.  Ho hum.   <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe if you can pinpoint *why* she is acting the way she is?  I <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; in our family, we had a major breakthrough in doing this.  My 5 <br/>
year <br/>
&gt; old was constantly beating on his 9 yo sister and messing up her <br/>
&gt; projects.  I finally figured out that he was doing it because he <br/>
&gt; wanted someone to play with, and when she was busy doing her own <br/>
&gt; thing, he acted out to get attention from her.  Now I know that I <br/>
&gt; need to give him a little more attention throughout the day and it <br/>
&gt; has cut down on the picking on his sister.  For us, this was a HUGE <br/>
&gt; breakthrough.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once in awhile lately my daughter has been talking to me just a <br/>
&gt; little bit cocky.  I think it&#39;s hormones kicking in.  Usually all I <br/>

sad <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983301918"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Are you saying that you never provide consequences or &quot;punishments&quot; <br/>
&gt; for inappropriate behaviors?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never.   If my son experiences consequences to some action they are the<br/>
natural consequences. <br/>
He doesn&#39;t have inappropriate behaviors.  He behaves exactly as he is<br/>
able to in any situation.   <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Would you let your children, for <br/>
&gt; instance, swear at an adult, or punch holes in your walls if <br/>
&gt; they &quot;needed&quot;  or &quot;wanted&quot; to?  What about tattoos, piercings or <br/>
&gt; shoplifting?  When do you finally step in?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So here&#39;s the deal.   He doesn&#39;t.   He treats other people well because<br/>
he&#39;s always been treated well.  <br/>
If he did swear at an adult I would think he had a good reason to.  I<br/>
can&#39;t even imagine him punching anything.  He doesn&#39;t even like sparing<br/>
in Karate class.   He can&#39;t legally get a tattoo but he doesn&#39;t want one.<br/>
 I did offer to pierce his ears with some deer mouse ear tags we got from<br/>
a biologist but he declined.  He wouldn&#39;t dream of taking something that<br/>
isn&#39;t his, in fact the problem seems to be that he keeps giving his stuff<br/>
away.   I don&#39;t &quot;step in&quot;  because I&#39;m IN all the time.  I&#39;m right here. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am curious as to who <br/>
&gt; runs your household, you or the children? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We all live peacefully together.  Really.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When they are adults, <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; they know how to deal with &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;restrictions&quot; in their job, <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; life? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect so.  My son is ten.  He follows rules at his Dojo.  He follows<br/>
rules of games.  He&#39;s nice to people, he&#39;s walks on sidewalks instead of<br/>
in the street.  He seems to know what&#39;s what. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Or will they just do what they please, never considering <br/>
&gt; anyone else?  There will certainly be consequences when he tells his  <br/>
&gt; boss, &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope he always has the freedom to safely do as he pleases, but I don&#39;t<br/>
worry that he won&#39;t have consideration for others.  He&#39;s a very<br/>
considerate person right now.  He cares about how we feel and he looks<br/>
after his friends.   <br/>
If one day he tells his boss &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;  there probably will be<br/>
consequences.  The consequence that his boss says -do it any way-, or<br/>
-you&#39;re fired- are natural consequences.   There are consequences like<br/>
not having a pay check, not being able to pay bills, etc, those are<br/>
natural.   I don&#39;t picture him having to stay in his room for a week or<br/>
have his Playstation taken away...  <br/>
   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I mentioned in an earlier posting that she is gifted, because she <br/>
&gt; seems to have a problem with perfection.  Most everything comes very  <br/>
&gt; easily for her, so when something DOESN&#39;T - she flips.  She doesn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; know how to deal with it.  I have had SO many talks with her, <br/>
&gt; encouraging her, explaining how well she&#39;s doing, and even the <br/>
&gt; professional musicians don&#39;t do it perfectly... etc etc to make her  <br/>
&gt; understand, and to STOP being so hard on herself.  When she&#39;s <br/>
&gt; practicing, I continually tell her how well she&#39;s doing (even when <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t perfect!)  She is loved unconditionally, and she knows that.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the post didn&#39;t apply to your real situation then there are no<br/>
consequences if you disregard it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just a FYI - I had a few people email me OFF LIST, with actual <br/>
&gt; SUPPORT, in agreement with reasonable consequences.  They didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want <br/>
&gt; to post publicly, for fear of people attacking them for their views.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s their option.  No one has to discuss ideas here, it&#39;s not a<br/>
requirement.   <br/>
But I still don&#39;t see how made up punishment is a reasonable consequence<br/>
and I won&#39;t be offering support in favor of punishment of any sort.  I<br/>
think supporting kids is much better.  And if a person is going to hold<br/>
views then they might as well be able to explain them and stand up to<br/>
whatever the argument is against them, if they&#39;re worth holding.   If<br/>
they&#39;re not worth holding then throw them out and get some new ones.  <br/>
That&#39;s how we learn. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does she? Wouldn&#39;t you be disappointed she quit? I&#39;m sure she would feel<br/>
that even if you didn&#39;t say it. I always just *knew* when my parents were<br/>
disappoimted with me. Even when nothing was said or done to show it. I was<br/>
disappointed with myself and felt like I let them down.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The violin was one example.  My husband just asked her to please run<br/>
&gt; downstairs and turn off the tv, because we were all getting settled<br/>
&gt; down for bed.  She simply didn&#39;t feel like it, so she huffed, and was<br/>
&gt; rude.  She simply didn&#39;t want to be bothered.  That is often the<br/>
&gt; reason.  &quot;Oh honey, would you put that in the trash instead of<br/>
&gt; leaving it on the counter?&quot;  might result in stomping, or even<br/>
&gt; yelling.  &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot; she&#39;ll rant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t asking her to do it for you (turn off the TV) the same as her not<br/>
wanting to do something (throw something away) to make your life easier?<br/>
That&#39;s where the Why do *I* have to always... comes from. We ask our<br/>
children to do things for *us* all the time. They are not supposed to argue<br/>
or say no. They are not to get angry or refuse.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Different kids have different personalities.  Some are more &quot;strong<br/>
&gt; willed&quot; than others.  Some are very agreeable to everything, mine is<br/>
&gt; not.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have both. My more agreeable child (ds13) gets tired of being ask<br/>
sometimes. He tells me so and I try doing better myself. I try harder to not<br/>
take advantage of him. Balance. It&#39;s hard sometimes but I try to be more<br/>
mindful of this and it works wonders.<br/>
<br/>
My other ds (8yo) lets me know first that he doesn&#39;t want to. This sometimes<br/>
set me off. We both get loud. That&#39;s were he has gotten this too. My ds have<br/>
not fallen far from the tree so to speak. I try to back off more and give<br/>
him *all* the info of why I&#39;m asking. If I tell him my reasons first and not<br/>
just ask or demand he is much more agreeable. Interupting his play, TV,<br/>
activites is also a major factor too. I react the same. I really have a hard<br/>
time when anyone, including dh, interupting my reading and trying to absorb<br/>
something. I&#39;m getting better just by knowing I have a problem with it. I&#39;ve<br/>
adjusted and work on it daily. We are a work in progress and I have to<br/>
remember that. <br/>
<br/>
Your daughter is only 9. She is very aware of disappointment and<br/>
expectations. From her parents and in herself. She is trying her hardest to<br/>
sort all this out. I know I have trouble soemtimes too and I&#39;m 42. It&#39;s not<br/>
easy figuring it all out. With you being aware of your behaviour helps. You<br/>
are the only one you can change. Look within and you may be surprised at the<br/>
answers you find. I know have.<br/>
<br/>
Deb your post was helpful to me to remind me to listen better and keep<br/>
working on myself. Thank you for that. I needed the reminder.<br/>

&gt; know how to deal with it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think learning about ourselves, our personal beings, can be as<br/>
complicated a task as learning to read or play violin.  I think it just<br/>
may take some kids longer to understand their own emotions.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have had SO many talks with her, <br/>

&gt; weaknesses, that everyone is different. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not a perfectionist and I can&#39;t offer any suggestions on this<br/>
personality type, but I think some of the earlier posts addressed this<br/>
and maybe those people will have more thoughts for you. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Before she started taking the violin, we didn&#39;t know if that, too, <br/>
&gt; would come easily.  We talked about how if she wanted to do it, she <br/>
&gt; could.  She can do anything she puts her mind to.  We talked about <br/>
&gt; how she may have a &quot;gift&quot; for music, it might come easily, or she <br/>
&gt; might not, and she would have to work a bit harder.  Either way, if <br/>
&gt; she put forth the effort, she could do it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s just plain hard to struggle with something.  Adults have<br/>
difficulty with frustration, I don&#39;t think we can fairly ask children to<br/>
know all the coping skills.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She is loved unconditionally, and she knows that.  She knows she can  <br/>
&gt; give it up at any time if she wants, she has the freedom to choose. <br/>

&gt; yelling.  &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot; she&#39;ll rant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has she been asked to do more around the house since her brother came? <br/>
Could she be feeling like the three year old is being, well, babied,<br/>
while she has to do more to help you?    Sandra talked about taking the<br/>
time to baby her some, maybe she needs that.  My niece needed more time<br/>
being the baby when her little sister came.  <br/>
 &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot;  sounds like she really feels she&#39;s not<br/>
being treated fairly.  If she feels that way, could you talk about why?  <br/>
Do you ask her to do more than she&#39;s ready to maybe, or are you asking<br/>
when she&#39;s busy with something else.? Can you give her the option to do<br/>
it when she&#39;s finished?  <br/>
A policy that has worked around here is that when I want something done, <br/>
when *I* want it,  I do it.  Everyone sort of operates that way,  and<br/>
when one of us does need help, it doesn&#39;t feel like a chore to help<br/>
because we haven&#39;t be hounded about doing stuff.  <br/>

out the violin, you casually go do some project in another part of <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve found that when it&#39;s something that directly affects my <br/>
daughter, she&#39;s more than willing to help.  If she&#39;s having friends <br/>
over, she&#39;ll clean up so they have a clutter free area to play.  If <br/>
she wants to make a special meal and the measuring cup she wants is <br/>
in the sink, she&#39;ll wash it.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to be guilty of relying on her, as the oldest child, to run <br/>
and do things for me all the time. She was my little errand girl.  <br/>
Please run and get me a diaper for the baby.  Please go put this in <br/>
the mailbox for me.  Please go get your brother a shirt.  Then I sat <br/>
back (after reading a lot of posts on this list!) and thought about <br/>
how I&#39;d feel in her situation.  <br/>
<br/>
So now, if I&#39;m running late and one of the boys aren&#39;t dressed, I <br/>
might say, &quot;Honey, I&#39;m really running late and he&#39;s not even <br/>
dressed.  Do you have time to get me a shirt for him?&quot;  That&#39;s the <br/>
same way I&#39;d ask my husband for help.  Very rarely does she turn me <br/>
down, but once in awhile she&#39;ll say, &quot;Can you wait until I finish <br/>
__________&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m kind of in the middle of a game&quot; or &quot;Mommy, I&#39;m <br/>
SOOOO tired!&quot;  I&#39;m learning to accept it.  And I&#39;m trying not to ask <br/>
her to run and get me stuff unless I am really stuck or really <br/>
overwhelmed.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also learning to often do things that she asks me to do.  Like <br/>
today she has friends over and she was so excited and having such a <br/>
good time.  She wanted some food warmed up and asked if I would do it <br/>
for her and bring it to her.  There was a time when I would have <br/>
said, &quot;You&#39;re capable of getting that yourself&quot;, but then I thought <br/>
of all the times I was exhausted at the end of the day and asked her <br/>
to go get me something because I couldn&#39;t bare the thought of walking <br/>
down the steps one more time.  I realized how important having these <br/>
friends over is to her and then happily got her the food and brought <br/>
it to her.  <br/>

dinner isn&#39;t right. Something you are doing doesn&#39;t turn out to be what you<br/>

to practice to get better. We just are.<br/>
    Acknowledging that she is frustrated and letting it go at that may help.<br/>
Have you read Faber and Mazlishs&#39; book How to Talk so You Kids will listen,<br/>
Listen so your kids will talk? (That title&#39;s not quite right) I was an eye<br/>
opener for me. Just acknowledging and not adding suggestions helped too.<br/>
Sometimes we just want to be heard. Not necessarily asking for an answer.<br/>
    Also I thought that maybe she could practice alone to go over it over<br/>
and over privately. I&#39;ve heard of kids that don&#39;t want to show how they can<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have in the past.  I&#39;m trying to leave the past behind.  &lt;g&gt;  Using<br/>
punishment just set us up as adversaries.  I&#39;m still wearing the results.<br/>
<br/>
Would you let your children, for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; instance, swear at an adult, or punch holes in your walls if<br/>
&gt; they &quot;needed&quot;  or &quot;wanted&quot; to?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son has actually told *me* I shouldn&#39;t swear so much.  If he did swear at<br/>
an adult, I suspect it would be because the adult was acting like an ass.<br/>
He&#39;s generally polite and respectful with adults.  I&#39;ve never been faced<br/>
with wall punching, but I guess I&#39;d offer something to punch that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
hurt him, like a pillow.  I think maybe he&#39;d catch the attempt at humour and<br/>
chill.<br/>
<br/>
What about tattoos, piercings or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shoplifting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My step-daughter was telling my son the other day that he should get a<br/>
tattoo.  (Thanks, Emily!)  He didn&#39;t say anything.  I just said that before<br/>
he ever gets a tattoo, he should consider how it&#39;s going to look when his<br/>
skin is old and wrinkled.  That said, my grown daughter has a couple of<br/>
really nice tattoos.  Piercings?  I have pierced ears.  Why should I be<br/>
telling him whether he can or can&#39;t.  They grow over if he decides he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like them.  Oh, I have said that he&#39;ll be responsible for his own<br/>
dental work if he gets his tongue pierced, because I&#39;ve heard of so many<br/>
people who have ended up with chipped teeth or broken fillings because of<br/>
them.  So far (at 15) he isn&#39;t interested.<br/>
<br/>
If he ever shoplifts, I hope he gets caught the first time and has to<br/>
experience society&#39;s consequences.  I shoplifted candy bars when I was ten<br/>
and never got caught.  I felt so guilty that I stopped for a number of years<br/>
but got into it again as a teen.  I&#39;m glad I got caught fairly early on and<br/>
was scared into never doing it again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I mentioned in an earlier posting that she is gifted, because she<br/>
&gt; seems to have a problem with perfection.  Most everything comes very<br/>
&gt; easily for her, so when something DOESN&#39;T - she flips.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how to deal with it.  I have had SO many talks with her,<br/>
&gt; encouraging her, explaining how well she&#39;s doing, and even the<br/>
&gt; professional musicians don&#39;t do it perfectly... etc etc to make her<br/>
&gt; understand, and to STOP being so hard on herself.  When she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; practicing, I continually tell her how well she&#39;s doing (even when it<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t perfect!)  She is loved unconditionally, and she knows that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you have these talks with her when she&#39;s in the middle of her<br/>
frustration, or when she&#39;s calm and not frustrated about anything?  If she<br/>
isn&#39;t calm, she isn&#39;t going to hear you or be able to open up.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids don&#39;t want to hear how well they&#39;re doing at something from their<br/>
parents, especially when they&#39;re perfectly aware that it isn&#39;t as good as<br/>
they want it to be.  Maybe you could focus more on the improvement you<br/>
notice in her playing.  Could you tape her playing regularly, so she can<br/>
listen several months later?  How do you phrase your comments about her<br/>
playing?  Do you just tell her she&#39;s doing well, or do you find specific<br/>
things about her playing that she really *does* do well and comment on<br/>
those?  For instance, if she&#39;s had trouble with the rhythm in a particular<br/>
piece, you could notice the times she gets the rhythm right.  What does her<br/>
music teacher have to say about it?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a FYI - I had a few people email me OFF LIST, with actual<br/>
&gt; SUPPORT, in agreement with reasonable consequences.  They didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to post publicly, for fear of people attacking them for their views.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Very interesting...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If people aren&#39;t happy with this list, then maybe they should find a list<br/>
they&#39;re happy with.  It works for me, and a lot of other people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698310231"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; She is loved unconditionally, and she knows that.  She knows she can<br/>
&gt; give it up at any time if she wants, she has the freedom to choose.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe she doesn&#39;t believe you?  A friend on another homeschooling list had<br/>
that problem with her daughter.  When the girl seemed unhappy and frustrated<br/>
with piano after a year or two, they made it clear that it was her choice to<br/>
continue or not.  They mentioned off and on over several years that she<br/>
didn&#39;t have to play, that they wouldn&#39;t be disappointed.  She told them<br/>
years later that she didn&#39;t believe them, that she &quot;knew&quot; they wanted her to<br/>
continue.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The violin was one example.  My husband just asked her to please run<br/>
&gt; downstairs and turn off the tv, because we were all getting settled<br/>
&gt; down for bed.  She simply didn&#39;t feel like it, so she huffed, and was<br/>
&gt; rude.  She simply didn&#39;t want to be bothered.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Was she the one who left it on?  If not, why should she do it when she<br/>
wasn&#39;t the person who left it on or the person who wanted it off?  If she<br/>
was the one who left it on, was she in the middle of something?  Would it<br/>
have been ok for her to do it when she was finished, and does she know that<br/>
she has that option?<br/>
<br/>
That is often the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; reason.  &quot;Oh honey, would you put that in the trash instead of<br/>
&gt; leaving it on the counter?&quot;  might result in stomping, or even<br/>
&gt; yelling.  &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot; she&#39;ll rant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder if humour would help here.  You could do something like describe<br/>
how that counter is going to look if everyone just leaves their trash on it.<br/>
You could have the pile heaped up all the way to the ceiling.  My point is<br/>
that it&#39;s up to you rather than her to change the tone of your interactions.<br/>
She&#39;s too young and inexperienced to be able to figure out how to change it.<br/>
<br/>
From your various posts, I get the feeling that she doesn&#39;t *yet* have much<br/>
&quot;emotional intelligence&quot;.  She doesn&#39;t know how to label, describe, and deal<br/>
with her strong emotions.  Something my daughter has done with her kids is<br/>
to constantly give them words for talking about their feelings.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
always easy, but she really looks hard for the feelings that might be behind<br/>
the behavior and then labels them.  For instance, when I was visiting them<br/>
today, my two year old grandson was getting into a lot of bad behavior,<br/>
hitting and kicking, knocking stuff over, just being generally obnoxious.  I<br/>
was reading to his older sister.  Heather said to him, &quot;Kaelin, I wonder if<br/>
you&#39;re feeling left out.  I wonder if you need someone to read to you or<br/>
play with you.&quot;  He looked up, nodded his head, and went over to her for a<br/>
snuggle.  Problem solved for now.  Obviously it&#39;s going look different with<br/>
a nine year old, but you might find that it helps to spend a lot of time<br/>
talking about feelings when they aren&#39;t running really high.<br/>

&gt; GOING TO!  She&#39;ll yell.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe instead of telling her how good it sounds to you, you could ask her<br/>
how she felt about it, what she wants to improve the next time.  Maybe you<br/>
could talk to her about just working on one aspect of her playing at a time.<br/>
Maybe today she could just work on the rhythm, or just the phrasing.  Maybe<br/>
she could spend one (short) practice period working on that bit where her<br/>
fingers get all tangled up.  Does her teacher give her advice about<br/>
practicing?  My first horn teacher didn&#39;t, and I never really knew *how* to<br/>
practice.  My next teacher was very specific about practice techniques.  For<br/>
instance, for that bit where the fingers get all tangled up, take it slowly<br/>
enough to play it perfectly, just one short section.  Make sure you start<br/>
slightly before the hard part and go through to a little bit past it,<br/>
otherwise you get tripped up getting into and out of the passage.  Then<br/>
speed it up a little at a time.  Does she have a metronome?  I often work<br/>
with one, and just keep notching the speed up one click at a time.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I want to help her when she&#39;s frustrated, but I&#39;m not sure how.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be happy until she DOES play the song perfectly,<br/>
&gt; so trying again seems the only option.  I have suggested she put it<br/>
&gt; away for awhile, and try later (a fresh start), but she gets mad at<br/>
&gt; that too.  She&#39;s upset with herself, about her playing, but lashes<br/>
&gt; out at anyone around.  I&#39;ve tried ignoring her attitude, but it&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She can&#39;t hear you when she&#39;s upset.  Can you have these talks at some other<br/>
time?  Maybe when you&#39;re doing something else together, you could bring up a<br/>
story about how you sometimes get really frustrated when you&#39;re sewing or<br/>
something like that.  Talk about how you&#39;ll keep going after one or two<br/>
mistakes, but if you keep making mistake after mistake, you realize that<br/>
it&#39;s time to take a break or quit for the day.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; But, her attitude can come, often, from not wanting to be bothered.<br/>
&gt; Not wanting to contribute.  Not wanting to make an effort.  Ho hum.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does she see you and your husband deciding to do something and then keeping<br/>
at it, making an effort, when it gets hard?  Are you sure she&#39;s aware that<br/>
that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing?  Do you ever talk about how hard some things are<br/>
for you, especially things that maybe look to her like they must be easy?<br/>
Has she had a chance to experience the satisfaction of succeeding at<br/>
something that took more effort than things usually do for her?  Maybe you<br/>
could look for opportunities for her to experience something like that.<br/>
<br/>
You see, not using punishments can look like the parents aren&#39;t doing<br/>
anything, but in many ways it&#39;s harder.  Much more effective in the long<br/>
run, but harder in the meantime.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093699702">Hey, I know you have received lots of ideas and I&#39;m not an unschooling expert or even have a nine year old, but I would like to share some thoughts of you.<br/>
<br/>
First of all I honestly don&#39;t think punishment is going to solve your problems. She will end up feeling more resentful and more angry. She sees her behaviour from an entirely different perspective, and I&#39;m quite sure from where she is looking, she does not need punishment. I&#39;ve never came across a child that feel punishment was fair and they deserved it. I did not endure many punishments as a child, but I do remember once, funny enough because my father thought I was disrespectful to my mother, and even though I probably was at the time, I still today feel he was wrong to punish me.<br/>
<br/>
She sounds angry, upset, and frustrated to me, and I think she might need some space. Space to be on her own, space to get upset without someone trying to make her feel better, space to be frustrated and work it through.<br/>
<br/>
We have to remember that our children do not act in isolation. They act and react to us. We live within a family system, where each part affects the next part. Her behaviour is a reaction to what she perceives from you, and you reacting to it, keeps it alive and going. I can see that with my children - whenever I&#39;m having a bad day, they react to me in a similar pattern.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a nine year old, but I do have a nine year old niece, and I think this might not be the easiest age for them. Nine year olds are moving into a new development phase and they are enduring all kind of changes, that are bound to leave them frustrated and confused. I also believe some girls might experience hormonal increases and everyone know how difficult those hormones can make life.<br/>

No, not lying.  I think it sounds wonderful, and I tell her so.  I <br/>
don&#39;t just praise her when it is 100% perfect, thus pushing the <br/>
perfection issue.  To me, it DOES sound beautiful.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; She is loved unconditionally, and she knows that.  She knows she <br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; give it up at any time if she wants, she has the freedom to <br/>
choose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does she? Wouldn&#39;t you be disappointed she quit? I&#39;m sure she would <br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; that even if you didn&#39;t say it. I always just *knew* when my <br/>
parents were<br/>
&gt; disappoimted with me. Even when nothing was said or done to show <br/>
it. I was<br/>
&gt; disappointed with myself and felt like I let them down.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The violin was one example.  My husband just asked her to please <br/>
run<br/>
&gt; &gt; downstairs and turn off the tv, because we were all getting <br/>
settled<br/>
&gt; &gt; down for bed.  She simply didn&#39;t feel like it, so she huffed, and <br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; rude.  She simply didn&#39;t want to be bothered.  That is often the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reason.  &quot;Oh honey, would you put that in the trash instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; leaving it on the counter?&quot;  might result in stomping, or even<br/>
&gt; &gt; yelling.  &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot; she&#39;ll rant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t asking her to do it for you (turn off the TV) the same as her <br/>
not<br/>
&gt; wanting to do something (throw something away) to make your life <br/>
easier?<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s where the Why do *I* have to always... comes from. We ask our<br/>
&gt; children to do things for *us* all the time. They are not supposed <br/>
to argue<br/>
&gt; or say no. They are not to get angry or refuse.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Different kids have different personalities.  Some are <br/>
more &quot;strong<br/>
&gt; &gt; willed&quot; than others.  Some are very agreeable to everything, mine <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have both. My more agreeable child (ds13) gets tired of being ask<br/>
&gt; sometimes. He tells me so and I try doing better myself. I try <br/>
harder to not<br/>
&gt; take advantage of him. Balance. It&#39;s hard sometimes but I try to be <br/>
more<br/>
&gt; mindful of this and it works wonders.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My other ds (8yo) lets me know first that he doesn&#39;t want to. This <br/>
sometimes<br/>
&gt; set me off. We both get loud. That&#39;s were he has gotten this too. <br/>
My ds have<br/>
&gt; not fallen far from the tree so to speak. I try to back off more <br/>
and give<br/>
&gt; him *all* the info of why I&#39;m asking. If I tell him my reasons <br/>
first and not<br/>
&gt; just ask or demand he is much more agreeable. Interupting his play, <br/>
TV,<br/>
&gt; activites is also a major factor too. I react the same. I really <br/>
have a hard<br/>
&gt; time when anyone, including dh, interupting my reading and trying <br/>
to absorb<br/>
&gt; something. I&#39;m getting better just by knowing I have a problem with <br/>
it. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; adjusted and work on it daily. We are a work in progress and I have <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; remember that. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your daughter is only 9. She is very aware of disappointment and<br/>
&gt; expectations. From her parents and in herself. She is trying her <br/>
hardest to<br/>
&gt; sort all this out. I know I have trouble soemtimes too and I&#39;m 42. <br/>
It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; easy figuring it all out. With you being aware of your behaviour <br/>
helps. You<br/>
&gt; are the only one you can change. Look within and you may be <br/>
surprised at the<br/>
&gt; answers you find. I know have.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I THINK I have it pinpointed, in that it seems to be a perfection <br/>
&gt; &gt; issue.  Since most things come very easily for her, when <br/>
something <br/>
&gt; &gt; DOESN&#39;T, she doesn&#39;t know how to deal with it.  We&#39;ve talked <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; on numerous occasions.  She agrees that because most things come <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; &gt; easily to her, she feels &quot;stupid&quot; when she can&#39;t do something.  <br/>
&gt; Logic <br/>
&gt; &gt; tells her she&#39;s not really stupid, but she&#39;s so frustrated at the <br/>
&gt; &gt; time.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I think the most effective way to deal with it is to deal with <br/>
&gt; the frustration rather than punishing. I&#39;m sure we all know <br/>
families <br/>
&gt; with kids who have lousy relationships with their parents and <br/>
they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; always &quot;grounded&quot;.  Their parents are always yelling at them.  They <br/>
&gt; get punished a LOT.  The goal should be to get to the heart of the <br/>
&gt; issue, not to keep punishing her.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; She&#39;ll be playing the violin, and I&#39;ll tell her how nice it <br/>
sounds, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and she&#39;ll get frustrated anyway, because it wasn&#39;t perfect.  <br/>
I&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; &gt; tell her it sounded great to me, but that doesn&#39;t help.  I&#39;ll ask <br/>
&gt; her <br/>
&gt; &gt; what SHE thought was wrong, and she might say it was too fast or <br/>
&gt; &gt; slow, so I&#39;ll suggest she try it again, or something like that.   <br/>
&gt; I&#39;M <br/>
&gt; &gt; GOING TO!  She&#39;ll yell.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What if you stopped commenting?  What if, when you see her getting <br/>
&gt; out the violin, you casually go do some project in another part of <br/>
&gt; the house and let her to work out her violin frustrations herself?  <br/>
&gt; If she comes looking for you and asking for help, then give it, but <br/>
&gt; maybe she just needs to work this out for herself? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But, her attitude can come, often, from not wanting to be <br/>
&gt; bothered.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Not wanting to contribute.  Not wanting to make an effort.  Ho <br/>
&gt; hum.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found that when it&#39;s something that directly affects my <br/>
&gt; daughter, she&#39;s more than willing to help.  If she&#39;s having friends <br/>
&gt; over, she&#39;ll clean up so they have a clutter free area to play.  If <br/>
&gt; she wants to make a special meal and the measuring cup she wants is <br/>
&gt; in the sink, she&#39;ll wash it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used to be guilty of relying on her, as the oldest child, to run <br/>
&gt; and do things for me all the time. She was my little errand girl.  <br/>
&gt; Please run and get me a diaper for the baby.  Please go put this in <br/>
&gt; the mailbox for me.  Please go get your brother a shirt.  Then I <br/>
sat <br/>
&gt; back (after reading a lot of posts on this list!) and thought about <br/>
&gt; how I&#39;d feel in her situation.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now, if I&#39;m running late and one of the boys aren&#39;t dressed, I <br/>
&gt; might say, &quot;Honey, I&#39;m really running late and he&#39;s not even <br/>
&gt; dressed.  Do you have time to get me a shirt for him?&quot;  That&#39;s the <br/>
&gt; same way I&#39;d ask my husband for help.  Very rarely does she turn me <br/>
&gt; down, but once in awhile she&#39;ll say, &quot;Can you wait until I finish <br/>
&gt; __________&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m kind of in the middle of a game&quot; or &quot;Mommy, I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; SOOOO tired!&quot;  I&#39;m learning to accept it.  And I&#39;m trying not to <br/>
ask <br/>
&gt; her to run and get me stuff unless I am really stuck or really <br/>
&gt; overwhelmed.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m also learning to often do things that she asks me to do.  Like <br/>
&gt; today she has friends over and she was so excited and having such a <br/>
&gt; good time.  She wanted some food warmed up and asked if I would do <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; for her and bring it to her.  There was a time when I would have <br/>
&gt; said, &quot;You&#39;re capable of getting that yourself&quot;, but then I thought <br/>
&gt; of all the times I was exhausted at the end of the day and asked <br/>
her <br/>
&gt; to go get me something because I couldn&#39;t bare the thought of <br/>
walking <br/>
&gt; down the steps one more time.  I realized how important having <br/>
these <br/>
&gt; friends over is to her and then happily got her the food and <br/>
brought <br/>
&gt; it to her.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Are you saying that you never provide consequences or &quot;punishments&quot; <br/>
for inappropriate behaviors?  Would you let your children, for <br/>
instance, swear at an adult, or punch holes in your walls if <br/>
they &quot;needed&quot;  or &quot;wanted&quot; to?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others have responded, and I KNOW we as a group have been attacked <br/>
in this same sarcastic way periodically over the years.<br/>
<br/>
My children have never sworn at an adult.  When Kirby was thirteen and found <br/>
out his friend Zandra was dead and he had already missed the funeral, he <br/>
kicked a hole in the wall.  I didn&#39;t &quot;let him.&quot;  She was not only a customer <br/>
and gamer at the store were he worked, but her sons were his age, and the <br/>
whole family was great.  Then the boys had to go and live with other <br/>
relatives.  People just thought he knew.  She was already buried.  Cancer.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt he&#39;ll ever punch a hole in  a wall again.  <br/>
<br/>
Now where in there would punishment have been appropriate or helpful?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What about tattoos, piercings or <br/>
shoplifting?  When do you finally step in? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is worded in so antagonistic a way it&#39;s hard to see you WAY way over on <br/>
the far horizon.<br/>
<br/>
Much of tattoo/piercing/shoplifting in children is out of neediness for <br/>
respect and attention, and out of having power.   Since my children are not <br/>
emotionally needy, not trying to impress classmates or bullies, and they have <br/>
ways to get stuff when they need it, they&#39;re not doing those things,   They <br/>
have calm, strong identities.<br/>
<br/>
Their friend Eric goes to school and he&#39;s the only pierced-faced on in their <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt; I am curious as to who <br/>
runs your household, you or the children? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, you&#39;re not curious.  You&#39;re insulting.<br/>
You&#39;re assuming children &quot;run our households.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What runs our household is a set of considerations:  Keeping a roof over our <br/>
children&#39;s heads, providing them a safe and interesting life as far as we <br/>
can, being loving and compassionate within our means, etc.   When the people <br/>
in the house have mutual goals and when they&#39;re helping each other accomplish <br/>
smaller personal goals, it doesn&#39;t look much like the traditional father as <br/>
principal, mother as teacher, children as sinful grubs scenario that many <br/>
structured homeschooling families prefer.<br/>
<br/>
Since it&#39;s a different paradigm, questions about the OLD paradigm don&#39;t <br/>
translate across very well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When they are adults, will they know how to deal with &quot;rules&quot; or <br/>
&quot;restrictions&quot; in their job, or <br/>
life? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know many grown unschoolers now.   They just keep coming!  My oldest is <br/>
sixteen and has had the same job for two years.  He came in at 3:00 a.m. last <br/>
night, came to check on me, and went to sleep.  He has to be at work at 9:00. <br/>
 I asked my husband to check at 8:15 to make sure he was awake.  At 8:00, <br/>
Keith came down and said Kirby was up already.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has always loved rules.  Rules of games, procedures for remembering <br/>
which kid&#39;s turn it was to sit in the front, or to go with dad alone to the <br/>
store, when they were younger and we had some little turn-taking things.   He <br/>
is a really good teacher of the games at their store.  Once a week he teaches <br/>
the beginning kids&#39; class at the dojo where he&#39;s gone since he was nine.  He <br/>
knows, respects, and passes on the rules for behavior in the dojo, the forms <br/>
of the exercises, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is a really good host, when other kids are over.  He&#39;s thoughtful and <br/>
aware.  I remind him sometimes, checklist style, if he has overnighters to <br/>
make sure they know where bathrooms and breakfast foods are in case they&#39;re <br/>
up first, and to make sure there are enough sheets and pillows out and <br/>
available for when they start dropping here and there on futons and couches.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is a rules fiend.  She wants rules followed to the letter.  She&#39;s just <br/>
that way.  She likes her little ponies lined up in some sensible (to her) <br/>
fashion, and rearranges them periodically by how their manes are combed, or <br/>
the order she got them in, or those her cousin Gina has, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of natural restrictions on life.  Making them up would be <br/>
counter-productive to their living NOW in the real world.  School claims to <br/>
prepare people for the real world,  My kids didn&#39;t need that preparation, <br/>
having never &quot;left&quot; the real world to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or will they just do what they please, never considering anyone else?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They never have done that before, so I can&#39;t imagine why they would start <br/>
when they were grown.  They&#39;re very considerate.  Because they have been <br/>
shown much consideration.  Because they live surrounded by consideration, <br/>
they think that is just how things should be between people.<br/>
<br/>
If they lived surrounded by shame and false &quot;consequences&quot; they would learn <br/>
to think that&#39;s how life should be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There will certainly be consequences when he tells his boss, &quot;I don&#39;t want <br/>
to&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It depends what the thing is and how he says it.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby goes to staff meetings and almost always brings up something the boss, <br/>
owner and manager had all overlooked in planning the meeting, or his <br/>
brainstorming proposals are taken and made into policy, or a Magic tournament <br/>
is rearranged following his reminders about logistics and time constraints.   <br/>
<br/>
Some jobs have yucky things a kid just might not be willing to do.  They can <br/>
make adult decisions about whether to negotiate, buck up, or just change <br/>
jobs.  They can make better adult decisions if they&#39;ve been making decisions <br/>
all along.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I mentioned in an earlier posting that she is gifted, because she <br/>
seems to have a problem with perfection.  Most everything comes very <br/>
easily for her, so when something DOESN&#39;T - she flips. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perfectionism isn&#39;t much of a gift.<br/>
Being called gifted is no gift at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When she&#39;s practicing, I continually tell her how well she&#39;s doing (even <br/>
when it <br/>
isn&#39;t perfect!)  She is loved unconditionally&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;I have had SO many talks <br/>
with her, <br/>
encouraging her, explaining how well she&#39;s doing&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those talks don&#39;t seem to be helping.  Maybe ease off them for a while and <br/>
try a new direction.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Just a FYI - I had a few people email me OFF LIST, with actual <br/>
SUPPORT, in agreement with reasonable consequences.  They didn&#39;t want <br/>
to post publicly, for fear of people attacking them for their views. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Very interesting...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would not live my life in a way I couldn&#39;t defend publically.  If my <br/>
reasons weren&#39;t sound and workable, I would do something else.  <br/>
<br/>
We could find you some lists to be on where EVERYONE would agree with you.  <br/>
That&#39;s not necessarily support.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m offering is actual support in finding a better way to live with your <br/>
daughter.  If your way was working you wouldn&#39;t be bringing these questions <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Pam&#39;s argument that &quot;reasonable consequences&quot; is a euphemism for &quot;punishment&quot; <br/>
is exactly true.<br/>

I have slowly learned this with both my daughter (9, if that matters) and <br/>
wife.&lt;g&gt; During the heat of frustration, sometimes (most times?) the <br/>
*worst* thing I could do was offer suggestions. Once I learned to just let <br/>
them vent and calm down, without me adding comments, things started being <br/>
less stressful for all involved. Then after all the venting was over, I <br/>
would share similar situations of *my* frustration getting the better of <br/>
me, and that made her (my DD) feel better knowing it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; to get <br/>
frustrated sometimes.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Deb L AGAIN said something profoundly simple and true:<br/>
<br/>
The school model has parents and children separated.<br/>
The cultural model which sets children apart as lesser beings separates them <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is so different the old phrases just don&#39;t work.<br/>
I can&#39;t &quot;step in&quot; where I already am.<br/>
<br/>
La Leche League and attachment parenting both have things very easy to <br/>
experiment with for families who began early on to live mindfully with their <br/>
children.   One is the idea that if a child weans him or herself, he will <br/>
have quit exactly when he needed to, but if he&#39;s weaned against his will, he <br/>
will have remaining needs.  And if a mother lets a child be with her, right <br/>
in her lap, riding on her back, sleeping with her, he will bravely go away <br/>
more easily than one who is always being sent away and being made to be alone <br/>
to &quot;encourage independence.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t encourage independence, it creates a <br/>
gap between parent and child.  It keeps a child needy.<br/>
<br/>
Children who know their moms will be loving when they come back are braver <br/>
about venturing out because it is their choice to go and they will be <br/>
welcomed back.<br/>
<br/>
When a little child is exploring a park, it&#39;s better for the mom to follow <br/>
him around and stay close enough that he can come to her or she can help him <br/>
if he falls or gets stuck.  Too many moms I see want to sit and be <br/>
comfortable, and so they limit the child&#39;s movements for their own benefit.  <br/>
But they *say* it&#39;s for the child&#39;s safety.  <br/>
<br/>
A loving attitude toward babies and toddlers makes it easier for the mom to <br/>
continue to be loving.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I learned from attachment parenting, and I tried it with all <br/>
three of my kids and it worked well.  I still know lots of the teens Kirby&#39;s <br/>
age we met when I first went, and they, too, are calmly confident.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447346163">&lt;&lt;&lt;Once in awhile lately my daughter has been talking to me just a <br/>
little bit cocky.  I think it&#39;s hormones kicking in.  Usually all I <br/>
have to do is look at her and honestly tell her that it makes me sad <br/>
when she talks to me like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Sheila&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son is 9 1/2 and we have had trouble with &#39;ugly&#39; comments from him when he is angry/upset.  I usually remind him that I don&#39;t speak to him that way and I would appreciate it if he didn&#39;t speak to me like that.  It is sometimes helpful to remind him to change his tone and wording.  Especially if he is just angry about a toy/project/game and not frustrated with me.  Now, this doesn&#39;t always work but just a suggestion for you.  :) <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have tried this between ourselves actually.  We have been together since we were in high school so our relationship has grown along with us.  When he would speak to me in an ugly way, when I knew that I wasn&#39;t the one he was actually angry with, I would gently ask him if he wanted to &#39;rephrase that comment?&#39;  and he did the same to me when I was a little ...... how shall I say.....bitchy.  It helped us a lot to give each other another chance to say something without causing anger and/or hurt feelings.  Of course, we still can have a great argument/disagreement with each other.  Rephrasing for us is just a &#39;helper&#39; when we are having a bad day, grumpy, etc.... and not actually irritated with each other.  <br/>

I&#39;ve been whimpering and occasionally yelping the past few days, because of <br/>
my broken leg.  It&#39;s not attention getting, it&#39;s involuntary response to real <br/>
pain.  Sometimes someone will come and ask me if I need help.  I don&#39;t <br/>
usually need help.  Sympathy&#39;s nice.  But I wouldn&#39;t want anyone else to take <br/>
over and tell me when to sit, when to put my foot up higher or whatever.  I&#39;m <br/>
going okay.  Its frustrating, but other people shouldn&#39;t try to manage the <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
Being easily frustrated as a kid about music practice and other things (art, <br/>
sewing, remembering things/names/numbers), I think what would have helped me <br/>
in a situation like the frustrating violin practice would be for my mom to <br/>
have put a bowl of ice cream near me and smiled and gone back away.  Or maybe <br/>
&quot;Do you want to go to the store with me and finish practicing later?&quot;   Maybe <br/>
three ten minute sessions would be better for her than a solid half hour.<br/>

I didn&#39;t help her. Not in the least. The repercussions were extreme and I <br/>
firmly believe I hurt more than I helped. I helped us at the time because <br/>
she was more obedient and quiet. She was not a happy kid and later it came <br/>
back to haunt us all. I did what I thought was best at the time. I knew no <br/>
better. I had two little ones at the time that were watching their older <br/>
sisters every move. I just wanted her to stop before they started slamming <br/>
and talking back fiercely too. When I know better, I do better.<br/>
<br/>
I know better now.<br/>
<br/>
Know why? Because I&#39;ve done it both ways. A lot of people responding have <br/>
been homeschooling/unschooling since their kids were born or very little. My <br/>
oldest has always, even now been in the school system. My views on how <br/>
children were to be treated has changed. I&#39;ve done it the wrong way and now <br/>
the right way.<br/>
<br/>
Although the others are only soon to be 8,7 and now 2, I don&#39;t see what I <br/>
did in my oldest even at these ages. When people say they don&#39;t see their <br/>
kids doing those things at those ages, even though we can&#39;t ever really say <br/>
for sure, I believe them whole heartedly. It does make a difference in what <br/>
we do and how they react. I KNOW this to be true.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never too late. My oldest is almost 17 and every day we work on the <br/>
damage that&#39;s been done in the past. We&#39;re doing a great job. She&#39;s a great <br/>
kid. A really great kid. And when I honestly let her know that every minute <br/>
of the day, no matter how she was acting, she started to believe it too. <br/>
When I started to show her the respect and consideration and trust I asked <br/>
for from her, I started to get it back. It didn&#39;t happen over night. It&#39;s <br/>
not easy to do. Sometimes we really don&#39;t see what we&#39;re doing wrong with <br/>
our kids. We love them so much, we can&#39;t possibly think of what we feel is <br/>
right is harming them. A lot does. Listen to what they are saying. Listen <br/>
very carefully. When the kids are feeling a certain way, it&#39;s because they <br/>
are &quot;feeling&quot; it. We have no right to play that down by saying &quot;I&#39;m not&quot; and <br/>
&quot;No you don&#39;t&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not true.&quot; It&#39;s what they really feel. Help them <br/>
with that. Read a book, read 10 books. You&#39;ve got some really good <br/>
suggestions for books here. Read them twice if you have to.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t punish her and don&#39;t make her decide what you should &quot;do&quot; with her. It <br/>
might help you now, it won&#39;t help her at all. Trust me on this one. My <br/>
daughter was close to losing it all because I didn&#39;t try hard enough to <br/>
understand and really help her. Listen to what people are saying here. I <br/>
don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve heard off list, but I do hear what is being said <br/>
here. They are right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421252621"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Being easily frustrated as a kid about music practice and other things<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(art,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sewing, remembering things/names/numbers),<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was wondering what kind of response might be helpful to 5 yr old who was<br/>
frustrated & angry at her art class because she felt that everyone else&#39;s<br/>
sun was better than hers!?!  I acknowledged that she was frustrated, and<br/>
asked her how she wanted it to be different. She cried a little, but<br/>
wouldn&#39;t talk anymore about it. She also recently lost her mind after her<br/>
sister who is 3 yrs older beat her in a running race.  I held her (along<br/>
with our 4 month old, who was in the sling), and said it was hard, and tried<br/>
to comfort her.  She jumped up and screamed and raced around trying to hit<br/>
her sister. I know having a new baby is adding to her frustration, but I&#39;m<br/>
at a loss of what to do. I did talk later on about how frustrating things<br/>
can be, but I don&#39;t actually think I&#39;m helping her.<br/>
