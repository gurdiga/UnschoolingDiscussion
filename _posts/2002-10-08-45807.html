<br/>
Those of you familiar with my writing know that most of the time I tend to <br/>
focus on the political side of education. I often hesitate to focus on the <br/>
things we do that would actually fall under the &quot;homeschooling experience&quot; <br/>
label for a couple of reasons. As my daughter grows older it is <br/>
increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to make a distinction between <br/>
her education and her life. I have also found it rare for one method or <br/>
resource to work the same for all children and families thus I am hesitant <br/>
to suggest that one book or another would be a good one for you.<br/>
<br/>
Today I would like to talk about this concept of education as a part of <br/>
life. Sometimes when I describe my daughter&#39;s education as being another <br/>
aspect of life, it is interpreted to mean that we simply wait for things to <br/>
happen that can be classified as educational. In fact, many times in <br/>
discussions with home educators -- and I am sure you have witnessed this -- <br/>
individuals will attempt to prove how various life skills can be &quot;counted <br/>
as school&quot;. This is especially true when a parent new to homeschooling <br/>
expresses concerns regarding the ability to insure their child receives a <br/>
comprehensive education.<br/>
<br/>
But in the rush to reassure and calm the fears, an important point is <br/>
missed completely and a great disservice is done to the individual <br/>
expressing concern. The choice to educate a child at home generally means <br/>
that for one reason or another the school idea did not work for the child. <br/>
Since it did not work, it makes little sense to replicate any part of the <br/>
school system. Many times it is assumed that as long as you don&#39;t set up a <br/>
classroom in your home and follow a rigid schedule you have successfully <br/>
avoided following the school model. However, I would suggest that as long <br/>
as we are justifying any activity by drawing comparison to the school model <br/>
of education we aren&#39;t doing a very good job at getting away from the <br/>
school mentality.<br/>
<br/>
I think you will agree that there are a wide variety of skills that are <br/>
necessary or important to our children before they go off on their own. <br/>
Many times the acquisition of these skills would not require formal <br/>
curriculum or even books, but rather are learned through and by actual <br/>
experience. Often we will &quot;teach&quot; skills and impart knowledge to our <br/>
children without lesson plans and in a very natural way as the child needs <br/>
or shows an interest in a particular area or topic. In our home, cooking is <br/>
a good example of this.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has helped me in the kitchen in one way or another since she <br/>
was only nine months old. She is almost ten now and capable of preparing <br/>
many things, and for the most part with little assistance. Since I have <br/>
always enjoyed cooking, I am very pleased that my daughter also enjoys it, <br/>
and look forward to many years of baking scrumptious things together. This <br/>
learning has been and will continue to be accomplished as a part of life; <br/>
however, I do not think of cooking in terms of school. I don&#39;t describe the <br/>
various activities I participate in as &quot;educational&quot;, nor do I justify the <br/>
time my daughter spends cooking by categorizing it by subject such as <br/>
science, math and/or reading which then can &quot;count as school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem with the reassurances that living life may be counted as <br/>
school is that often this is presented as being enough for all children. <br/>
Reassurances often include some form of the statement that &quot;children learn <br/>
what they need to learn when they need to learn it&quot;. I do not dispute this <br/>
statement, and in fact, am quite supportive of this point of view. However, <br/>
relying only upon this leaves out those things that, as parents, we may <br/>
feel are necessary and important. I often say that educating a child is <br/>
simply another aspect of raising him and there will be times, even in <br/>
education, when you may require your child to do things they would not <br/>
choose on their own. Let me clarify that I am not advocating creating an <br/>
environment where the child is being forced to &quot;learn&quot;, which I believe is <br/>
impossible anyway. However, there will be topics that you as a parent will <br/>
consider a necessary part of your child&#39;s education. For example, it is <br/>
important to me that my daughter read good books. I do not subscribe to the <br/>
belief that reading is good regardless of the quality and content of the <br/>
material. As a result, there are books I will not purchase and I carefully <br/>
select reading material for her. I do not assign reading nor do I tell her <br/>
when, where, and how she should read. I simply provide the materials that I <br/>
approve of and don&#39;t buy the ones that fall short of my criteria. Some <br/>
books I purchase may sit on our shelves for as long as six months before <br/>
she becomes interested; others never quite make it to the bookshelf at all.<br/>
<br/>
Education is one aspect of raising our children. I believe that the <br/>
language we use to express our ideas regarding life with our children and <br/>
parenting decisions, and every nuance of that language, warrants careful <br/>
examination so that it will reflect our beliefs as accurately as possible. <br/>
As parents who have chosen to accept and exercise completely our <br/>
responsibilities toward our children, it is important that the words used <br/>
do not imply guidance from or validation of the school model. Our children <br/>
are not in school, and there is no reason to categorize their activities <br/>
according to school-defined and determined terms. You, the parent, must <br/>
define a child&#39;s education, determined by what you believe is important. <br/>
And most definitely_not_according to what can be &quot;counted&quot; as school.<br/>
