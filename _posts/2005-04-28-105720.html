<div id="ygrps-yiv-108905430">Sorry I know this was not the subject line, but I&#39;m on digest and I can&#39;t  <br/>
remember what the darned subj line was! : )<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not Presbyterian, but I haven&#39;t rejected it. I never  was  <br/>
Presbyterian.<br/>
I&#39;m not vegan.  I don&#39;t want to study it to  decide whether to reject  it.  <br/>
I&#39;m happy eating what I&#39;m  eating.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If the way someone lives seems like Buddhism to you and  all you think  <br/>
they&#39;re lacking is the label, how many times would you  suggest to them that <br/>
what  <br/>
they were calling mindfulness was the same  as Zen Buddhism, and why were <br/>
they  <br/>
rejecting  Buddhism?<br/>
 <br/>
Okay...I shouldn&#39;t be saying anything because I feel SO out of my league  <br/>
w/all of you eloquent writers, but HECK, I&#39;m going to anyway :)<br/>
 <br/>
To me talking about NCP to a radical unschooler would be more like - seeing  <br/>
someone who is growing their own vegetables organically and then  you telling <br/>
them how you do that too, AND that you found out how to  make your own compost <br/>
to improve your soil in your organic garden.  Does  that make any sense?  <br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;re not opposing things, but they&#39;re not the same thing, but they can  <br/>
work _together_ well to make the garden produce even better.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people w/vegetable gardens might not want to take that extra  step, or <br/>
feel their soil produces great vegetables just the way they&#39;ve always  done <br/>
things, and that&#39;s fine.  They&#39;ll still be eating delicious organic  vegetables.<br/>
 <br/>
Okay...I don&#39;t know if that makes any sense to anyone except me  -LOL...see!  <br/>
that&#39;s why I&#39;m not writing articles or posting much on these  lists &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Some of us have been told (in AOL forum days) clearly that  others&#39; <br/>
feelings  <br/>
were their own damned problem, and that coercing a  child for ANY reason was <br/>
just  the evillest thing ever.  And if a  person&#39;s life decisions will all <br/>
hinge  <br/>
on non-coercion, there it  is.<br/>
 <br/>
...AH, so that&#39;s it.  Sounds like  someone who didn&#39;t interprety/practice NCP <br/>
the same way I interpreted  it!  I can see if someone came here spouting that <br/>
kind of language that  it&#39;d turn you off.  If that had been the way I was <br/>
introduced to it, I  wouldn&#39;t have found it attractive or useful ONE BIT, nor <br/>
would I have wasted one  minute of my time by investigating it further!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  Pressing things to meld and blend won&#39;t work  when one group says &quot;no  <br/>
personal examples&quot; while the other is saying  &quot;avoid theoretical and <br/>
hypothetical  <br/>
questions and stories.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
...Which is why I still say &quot;forget the  lists...buy the BOOKS&quot; :)    <br/>
 <br/>
I, and many others, are only saying  that NCP (as well as TCS & NVC) are good <br/>
tools to use for some radical  unschoolers.  I think they&#39;re especially <br/>
helpful to help change deeply  ingrained habits & learn to communicate in helpful, <br/>
mindful and generally  positive ways.   So if you&#39;re a veteran radical <br/>
unschooler...yes, I  can certainly understand perfectly that you might not need those <br/>
 tools!  <br/>
 <br/>
But I&#39;m a relative newbie of 2  years w/a 6 year old DD.  I was raised by <br/>
very authoritarian  parents and tend to be a very controlling person (or used to <br/>
be...I&#39;m  working on it).  So, I consider myself to be a radical unschooler  <br/>
who uses ideas from all of the above in my Life Toolbox.  And I&#39;m  happy that <br/>
I&#39;ve found those tools that help me be a better Mom & wife  & friend :)<br/>

Well that&#39;s a forceful yet honest analogy.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve shown my  tomatoes online in word and photo and in person for years and <br/>
years, and when  I&#39;m criticized by someone who won&#39;t even confirm they HAVE <br/>
tomatoes, it&#39;s  irritating. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It might be a fine way to grow tomatoes.  But it&#39;s a THEORY about  growing <br/>
tomatoes.  The tomatoes have to want to grow.<br/>
 <br/>
If figure if I put seeds in the ground and water them and make sure the  bugs <br/>
don&#39;t get the seedlings and the cats don&#39;t dig them up and the plants keep  <br/>
reaching up and getting bigger and start growing tomatoes, they might&#39;ve wanted <br/>
 to be growing!  I will coerce any horn-worm the hell out of my tomato  patch.<br/>
 <br/>
(Had actual tomatoes last year; won&#39;t bother this year.  Have actual  kids <br/>
this year, still!  <br/>

I really need a newer photo on the Kirby page. He&#39;s had short hair now for  <br/>
nearly two years, and by short I mean too short to tie back, but not  &quot;short.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
I have no reason to think that&#39;s even their goal. <br/>
The only goal I could ever see for sure was that the kids would grow up  <br/>
believing that no one had the right to coerce them to do anything.  And  that&#39;s <br/>
not even reasonable, let alone true.<br/>
 <br/>

hammer.<br/>

And how wasteful of energy to talk about it so vaguely if it IS a fantastic  <br/>
way to improve family relations and help children grow up whole and thoughtful <br/>
 and happy.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s probably just the stress with the move and all. I can totally <br/>
understand the points of view being expressed. I think TCS offers some <br/>
valuable tools, same with NVC, though the scripted nature of that makes <br/>
me a bit crazy. I came to Unschooling and embraced it when my kids were <br/>
pretty young as, in part, a natural extension of AP and LLL philosophies <br/>
that I&#39;d already been practicing.<br/>
<br/>
I discovered TCS within the next 6-12 months of that, thanks to my 3rd, <br/>
highly autonomous child. It offered some very helpful approaches with a <br/>
kind of &quot;how-to&quot; curriculum that was absent from Unschooling in the <br/>
beginning for me. But, at the same time, I found it lacked the <br/>
*practical* how-to offered by e-lists like this one. Reading the two <br/>
together was helpful in my journey, and I see the Venn diagram aspect <br/>
Robyn points to.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I always say I practice TCS-lite. Very few people talk about the <br/>
rigors of TCS philosophy applied to multiple children, which I&#39;ve found <br/>
personally frustrating. I do my best to parent respectfully and <br/>
non-coercively, but the realities of life with several children, which <br/>
I&#39;m happy to talk about in detail (check it out on the AU list or my web <br/>
pages), often demonstrate the futility of life without any kind of <br/>
coercion whatsoever. I can&#39;t get that to happen with children who have <br/>
different temperaments, different needs and a similar need for proximity <br/>
to me. The practicalities fall short of the ideals.<br/>
<br/>
For me, my family and the reality of the individual/ group needs is the <br/>
most important thing--more important than a philosophy or abstract <br/>
ideal, for sure--and that is the biggest difference as I see it between <br/>
RU and TCS. One puts family first, the other philosophy.<br/>

One complaint about the &quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot; label is that it  implies <br/>
that other people didn&#39;t take them seriously.   And the main  proponent of <br/>
the philosophy only had one child, when the website was set up  (though maybe <br/>
she had another later or something; I didn&#39;t follow the  story).  And the photo <br/>
of her with a handgun (in England) was replaced  with some other photo after a <br/>
while.  <br/>
 <br/>
Theoretical stuff seems fine for childless people and academics.   For <br/>
single, childless academics, it&#39;s perfect!  Parents helping other  parents, <br/>
though--that holds a special value and attraction.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes I envision my children as parents, and sometimes as  spouses. I <br/>
like to think of Kirby being a really nice husband, and of Marty  being a fun <br/>
dad.  If I &quot;trained&quot; them by word, example and practice to  believe that their <br/>
rights and wishes were above all, I don&#39;t think they would  have the ability to <br/>
shift, adjust and balance various people&#39;s needs in the  moment.  Sometimes <br/>
one person is needy or vulnerable, sick or tired or  hungry.  Sometimes they&#39;re <br/>
so hungry they don&#39;t want to eat  anymore.  At that moment, they need to be <br/>
persuaded to eat more than I  need to be defending my right to have my way <br/>
without coercion about  something.  Even the theoretical examples sometimes seemed <br/>
other-worldly  to me, and cartoonish.  There seemed to be no room for <br/>
generosity or  selflessness or neediness or emergency measures.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think my kids will be good parents.  I think they would be better  parents <br/>
right now than most of the adults I&#39;ve met in my life (as parents, at  the <br/>
time they really WERE parents).  I don&#39;t think NCP&#39;s principles would  have <br/>
produced these &quot;results.&quot;  And that&#39;s not to say I am or have been a  coercive <br/>
parent; I&#39;m not.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think they&#39;re quite different things that seem similar in some lights,  <br/>
from some angles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209742571">I am wanting to say how much I appreciate this conversation on TCS/NCP.  My <br/>
experience and gut reaction, more with NVC, after trying very hard to use it <br/>
for over a year with my family of 3 children, is almost identicle to every <br/>
point mentioned so far, mainly by Pam and Sandra.  It is very affirming to <br/>
read their thoughts, because I was never able to quite honor my gut reaction <br/>
enough to get that clear about it.<br/>
<br/>
The NVC books are very, very convincing - and I was (almost, not quite) <br/>
believing that I must not be doing the NVC right, because it was impossible <br/>
to do with 3 kids!  Parents of one child looked at me like I just didn&#39;t get <br/>
it.  Three children, all with different needs at any one time - and during <br/>
NVC days, a trip to the grocery store was impossible.  It simply couldn&#39;t <br/>
happen, because the negotiating of 4 different people&#39;s needs took too long <br/>
to get at a mutually satisfactory solution!    And, if it&#39;s that hard to <br/>
learn, I&#39;m never going to get it right in time to reap any benefits from it. <br/>
But, suggestions on this list could make a difference in the peace in my <br/>
home within minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken and applied some points from NVC, especially looking for <br/>
alternative solutions during &quot;conflict&quot; to meet as many needs as possible <br/>
that before, I would not have even thought of.<br/>

<br/>
I think when the goal is doing better, and approaching a kinder,  gentler <br/>
life, there can be immediate success.   <br/>
 <br/>
One conversation (in the ancient AOL homeschooling forum days) was a  wrastle <br/>
about whether compromise was good, and the NCP response was that  compromise <br/>
is wrong and bad.  Asking someone to compromise was  coercion.<br/>
 <br/>
While I really enjoy discussing the precise meanings of words and their  <br/>
histories, I was unimpressed by people totally twisting the meaning of word,  and <br/>
since the term was in the name of the &quot;group&quot;/philosophy (nonCOERCIVE...),  <br/>
for them to have made up a whole new meaning for it and all kinds of rules was  <br/>
just irritating.<br/>
 <br/>
Coercive meant what they wanted it to mean, it seemed.  And they  wanted it <br/>
to mean pretty much everything the unschoolers were  recommending.  But they <br/>
weren&#39;t recommending anything better or clearer  or more useful.<br/>

That&#39;s exactly what I found -- the ideas sound great in theory, and I&#39;m sure it can work well in families where you have one child and parents committed to respecting the child&#39;s wishes.  Add another child or two, and there are just times when one child&#39;s desires have to take a backseat to a sibling&#39;s desires or feelings, with the result being that someone has to be coerced into doing something they didn&#39;t choose.  And that&#39;s not a bad thing.  Learning to defer to others in our families, both as a child and as an adult, is a necessary thing, and it&#39;s one of the benefits of having siblings.<br/>
