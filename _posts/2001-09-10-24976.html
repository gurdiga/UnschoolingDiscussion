<br/>
They don&#39;t need to be constant or countless, but the other end of that scale <br/>
is a mom who hasn&#39;t taken her kids anywhere for two months and yet is grumpy <br/>
that unschooling isn&#39;t working, or that her kids are watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
Using the world as your classroom doesn&#39;t mean leaving the kids stuck at home <br/>
without any outside exposure.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in between is a good balance point for each family.  I agree there <br/>
can be too much &quot;outside&quot; (and I&#39;m definitely not guilty; if anything I don&#39;t <br/>
get my kids out enough now that they&#39;re older), but there can ABSOLUTELY be <br/>
too little.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is an interesting post.  I agree that there is the possibility of<br/>
doing too much.  I think there is a fine line between allowing your child<br/>
autonomy over his/her education and allowing your child autonomy over<br/>
you.  Or maybe it is a wide grey area, with each child falling at a<br/>
different place.  I do think that some children can be left completely<br/>
alone in a house full of really cool stuff and they will not use any of<br/>
it and others will make the most of it.  Most of them will fall in<br/>
between somewhere.  But ultimately, if you love and respect your kids you<br/>
will find that midpoint that gives them control over themselves without<br/>
having control over you.<br/>

&gt;  I don&#39;t really agree with some of your feelings that a<br/>
&gt; unschooling moms role is to constantly involve her children in<br/>
&gt; countless excursions and fun activities.  Children need to be left<br/>
&gt; alone as well. They need to use their own abilities to entertain<br/>
&gt; themselves.  Distractions and entertainment come in many forms. While<br/>
&gt; a mother who keeps her kids busy with activity is using a more<br/>
&gt; sensory approach then TV or video games it is ultimately steering<br/>
&gt; children in the mothers chosen direction.  I am definitely not saying<br/>
&gt; that you should sit around the house all day but I also don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; that running all over the place trying to keep kids &quot;busy&quot; is the<br/>
&gt; answer.  There are a LOT of homeschooling/unschooling moms who do<br/>
&gt; this and I just don&#39;t agree...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tara, I completely agree with you (and I&#39;ll wager most unschoolers here do,<br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
My posts on activities may have been confusing -- I was trying to get across<br/>
that if there is consistently nothing more interesting than TV (and TV is<br/>
pretty interesting to most humans) that that is what a child will do. I<br/>
didn&#39;t mean for everyone to be constantly on the move. :)<br/>
<br/>
Boredom is, IMHO, a vital part of unschooling. From boredom comes the<br/>
motivation to do amazing things.<br/>
