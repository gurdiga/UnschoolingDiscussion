<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735376589">Hi Annette,<br/>
Y&#39;know, my MIL has diabetes and trouble digesting food and I have been telling her like forever that eating more raw foods would benefit her greatly.  But some doctor told her some time back that she shouldn&#39;t eat too many raw foods!  I couldn&#39;t believe it!  But then I found out that most doctors are required to take only one nutrition class.  <br/>
Several years ago, my DD and I became vegetarians for a few years and for a whole year we were vegans!  I can&#39;t believe I actually went a whole year eating no animal products whatsoever!  And of course that means a lot of raw fruits and veggies.  Except soy beans, you can&#39;t eat a raw soy bean!  But alas, my DH and my younger DD were/are carnivores through and through and we succumbed! :/  But I do remember my DD was always tired and pale as a vegan.  Perhaps it is time to revisit our vegetarian days again, only with a bit more planning!  I remember having a lot more energy as a vegetarian (not vegan). And dust off the ole&#39; juiceman juicer!<br/>

I admit that a whole raw diet is very difficult for many.  I also think that almost everyone would benefit from MORE raw foods in the diet and more careful selection of the foods that are not raw.  Those that initially benefit more from the raw foods are those whose digestion is somehow impaired - the extra enzymes are nothing short of miraculous.  When I consume raw foods, the difference is amazing.  As soon as I consume a cooked food item (still no sugar, preservatives, coloring, or processed food) I am sleepy and take naps!  I hope that taking higher amounts of raw foods will eventually restore more balance to my digestive system so that eventually the cooked foods will not register such a draw on my digestive enzyme production.  <br/>
