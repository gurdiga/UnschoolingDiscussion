&lt;&lt; Sometimes when Liam and I are out on a hike, we&#39;ll sing those three songs <br/>
 (&quot;If I Only Had a Brain/a Heart/the Noive&quot;) followed by &quot;We&#39;re Off to See <br/>
 the Wizard&quot; and we&#39;ll do the dance steps (complete with a few steps in the <br/>
 wrong direction and the pointing thing).  What fun! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You know Marji, I&#39;m really glad I met you. I now have this wonderful visual <br/>
of you and Liam in the woods singing and dancing. It&#39;s SO fitting. How <br/>
sweet.....sigh.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482729012">Thanks, Ren!  You made my day.  Someday maybe we could follow the Yellow <br/>
Brick Road together, all (wait, let me count).... 7 of us.  :-)  And anyone <br/>
else who&#39;d like to come.  It&#39;d be performance art!<br/>
<br/>
Marji, missing you, Ren, and the young &#39;uns, and everyone else more than ever!<br/>
