<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188633824">I really need your help.  My daughter, in her final year at Rutgers, is<br/>
doing a paper on Homeschoolers...that&#39;s all I know about it. She herself was<br/>
homeschooled for the last three years of highschool.  She would like to talk<br/>
with Highland Park NJ homeschoolers of all ilks.  If anyone is from Highland<br/>
Park, and would like to participate, or knows someone from Highland Park who<br/>
may be interested, please have them mail me at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hindar@...">hindar@...</a><br/>
putting HIGHLAND PARK in the subject heading.  Please add a contact number. <br/>
My daughter will be in touch with you.  If someone has responded and I<br/>
missed it, I apologize. I have been ill for the past two weeks.  Found out I<br/>
had bronchitis....<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann <br/>
