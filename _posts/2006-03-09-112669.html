<div id="ygrps-yiv-548406831">This reminds me of something...<br/>
We used to live near Mt. Vernon, and we&#39;d go often.  One time, they were<br/>
doing a &quot;food&quot; focus...it was pretty cool... lots of realistic looking fake<br/>
colonial food.  They handed out a recipe for Martha Washington&#39;s Christmas<br/>
Cake.  I don&#39;t guess I brought it with me  to Japan...too bad.  If I recall<br/>
correctly, it used a dozen eggs, a ridiculous amount of flour and some odd<br/>
spices.  But this is what I remember, and loved:  at the end, the directions<br/>
were &quot;bake until done&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
My MIL and I cracked up at this, and it&#39;s become a footnote to all of our<br/>
family recipes.<br/>
<br/>
Tami, looking forward to re-visiting Mt. Vernon, and other fun places in the<br/>
land of dead white men.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>small-town-Ontario,<br/>
  Canada.  It was for some kind of self-saucing pudding and it called for<br/>
  butter the size of an egg.  I suspect the recipe was handed down through<br/>
  generations and was written before eggs were graded for size &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Martha Washington&#39;s Great Cake<br/>
<br/>
(One of Mrs. Washington&#39;s favorite recipes)<br/>
Take 40 eggs and divide the whites from the yolks and beat them to a  <br/>
froth. Then work 4 pounds of butter to a cream and put the whites of  <br/>
eggs to it a Spoon full at a time till it is well work&#39;d. Then put 4  <br/>
pounds of sugar finely powdered to it in the same manner then put in  <br/>
the Yolks of eggs and 5 pounds of flour and 5 pounds of fruit. 2  <br/>
hours will bake it. Add to it half an ounce of mace and nutmeg half a  <br/>
pint of wine and some fresh brandy.<br/>
<br/>
Notes on making Martha Washington&#39;s Great Cake:<br/>
<br/>
In making the great cake, Mount Vernon&#39;s curatorial staff followed  <br/>
Mrs. Washington&#39;s recipe almost exactly. Where the recipe called for  <br/>
5 pounds of fruit, without specifying which ones, 2 pounds of  <br/>
raisins, 1 pound of currants, and 2 pounds of apples were used. The  <br/>
wine used was cream sherry. Since no pan large enough was available  <br/>
to hold all the batter, two 14 layers were made and stacked (note:  <br/>
the original was one single tall layer). The layers were baked in a  <br/>
350 degree oven for 1.5 hours. Should be iced with a very stiff egg- <br/>
white based icing, flavored with rosewater or orange-flower water.<br/>

<br/>
10 eggs<br/>
1 pound butter<br/>
1 pound sugar<br/>
1 1/4 pounds (20 ounces) flour<br/>
1 1/4 pounds (20 ounces) fruit<br/>
2 1/2 teaspoons ground mace<br/>
2/ 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg<br/>
2 ounces wine<br/>
2 ounces French brandy<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br/>
Separate egg whites from yolks and set yolks aside. Beat eggs whites  <br/>
to the &quot;soft peak&quot; stage. Cream butter. Slowly add the beaten egg  <br/>
whites, one spoonful at a time, to the butter. Add sugar slowly to  <br/>
egg whites and butter — again, one spoonful at a time. Add egg yolks.  <br/>
Add flour, slowly. Add fruit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337096889">This looks like it..I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t imagine &quot;bake until done&quot;-- but<br/>
even if I did, it still makes me laugh!<br/>
<br/>
At Mt. Vernon, they had a &quot;replica&quot; of said cake, and it was bigger around<br/>
than a large pizza, and about 7&quot; high.  My MIL and I have been planning to<br/>
try the updated version of Martha&#39;s recipe, but we always get sidetracked<br/>
making something else, which mostly involves chocolate.  Yumm....<br/>
<br/>
I just remembered that I have one of those late 40&#39;s early 50&#39;s &quot;take good<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was just telling Holly the other day that cake recipes used to say  <br/>
to test with a straw.<br/>
Now they say toothpick.  But people used to use &quot;broomstraw,&quot; and if  <br/>
they didn&#39;t live where there were clean living sticks, they might (I  <br/>
have seen it) just pull one right off the broom.   Seems yucky now,  <br/>
but when I was a kid I didn&#39;t think about it much, because at that  <br/>
point I could smell cake.<br/>
<br/>
For bread pudding they say stick a knife in deep and if it comes out  <br/>
clean it&#39;s done.  WIth cakes it&#39;s some thin, dry stick.<br/>
&quot;Until done&quot; isn&#39;t so crazy, if you know the test method.<br/>
<br/>
In the Middle Ages they used to bake in &quot;coffins,&quot; which were  <br/>
temporarily-built things, basically a crust that they didn&#39;t intend  <br/>
for you eat.  So a pie could be HUGE, and would be in a big flour and  <br/>
water and oil pan, and you could build a lid for that and &quot;fasten it&quot;  <br/>
as edges of pie crusts are fastened, but when it&#39;s all baked, you  <br/>
just spoon out the insides and let the coffin become pig food, or  <br/>
maybe if enough of the juice is in it, the top and sides could be  <br/>
eaten by the beggars who might come by, or kitchen help.  But the  <br/>
very bottom would have cinders in it and ashes, because of the way  <br/>
the ovens worked (like the adobe hornos of the Rio Grande valley, or  <br/>
some pizza ovens and kilns.  The fire is built right inside, and then  <br/>
when it&#39;s hot, the fireplace is cleaned out quickly, the food put in,  <br/>
and a door closed/made/fastened on.  Those coffins could be  <br/>
attractive or not.<br/>

  She watched it burn, waiting for the toothpick she had dumped in the raw batter to rise miraculously from the cake. :)<br/>

That is one great story!<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps she was generalizing from the Butterball turkeys.  Maybe they  <br/>
have something like this in the southern hemisphere or in Europe, but  <br/>
American Thanksgiving Technology developed a turkey with an  <br/>
indwelling thermometer.  When the turkey is done, the plastic inside  <br/>
part of the thermometer pops out.   Just like that toothpick didn&#39;t. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You can buy a cake tester from Pampered Chef similar to what you&#39;ve<br/>
described, though probably thinner.  I have one and it works very well (and<br/>
it&#39;s longer than a toothpick, so it doesn&#39;t get lost in a loaf pan).<br/>

get a disk out of a computer if the tray doesn&#39;t open by itself or  <br/>
the kind of tool you use to hang Christmas ornaments (other  <br/>
permutations of partly-straightened-out paper clips).<br/>
<br/>
Paper clips are easier to come by here than broomstraws or  <br/>
toothpicks, but I never thought of using one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-249275222">I love this list...how to unschool my kids and where to get a new  <br/>
cake tester (or some creative alternative), all delivered to my  <br/>
mailbox in one handy package.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an unschooly thought related to this. I don&#39;t shop  <br/>
recreationally, haven&#39;t for years. I only go shopping when I need to  <br/>
and spend as little time as possible doing it. The downside to this  <br/>
is that when I want something that isn&#39;t the sort of thing you shop  <br/>
for regularly, I have no idea where to look and often can&#39;t find it!  <br/>
If I&#39;d accepted one or two of the many invitations I&#39;ve received to  <br/>
Pampered Chef parties over the years, I&#39;d probably have been the  <br/>
proud owner of a new cake tester years ago. It really can be an  <br/>
impediment not to have browsed around, as I often don&#39;t have any idea  <br/>
what&#39;s available out there.<br/>
<br/>
One more example: I&#39;m a fat woman. I have a friend who is also very  <br/>
fat, and she dresses beautifully. I asked her once where she buys her  <br/>
clothes, and she said she gets them all over the place. She shops  <br/>
regularly, and her lover also shops a lot, and they both just pick up  <br/>
anything they find that will fit Joann and look good, whenever they  <br/>
find it. I am always needing, say, a pretty dress for a party and not  <br/>
being able to find the right thing in the two days I have to look.  <br/>
But Joann would have one hanging in her closet already. It might have  <br/>
been the only halfway-decent thing available all year at Tent Dresses  <br/>
R Us, but because she or her lover browse through there regularly,  <br/>
they found it. Knowing what&#39;s available in the market--and what  <br/>
prices are like--is valuable information that I often don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
I often think of this when someone around me is getting on an anti- <br/>
shopping, anti-fashion, anti-consumption rant.<br/>

I bought Holly a t-shirt online just yesterday.  She wanted a Mario t- <br/>
shirt, and in looking for one (found dozens of good ones), I came  <br/>
across a Meat Loaf &quot;Bat out of Hell&quot; t-shirt and she wanted that way  <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
We could&#39;ve looked at every item in the mall and never found any of  <br/>
those, but we would&#39;ve needed to eat lunch, and been tired and grouchy.<br/>
<br/>
Links from those t-shirt sites led to an interesting blog by a Duck  <br/>
Hunt fan, and to some information on My Little Pony art, and  <br/>
different artists&#39; renditions of Thor (cartoon character Thor) which  <br/>
for Holly is a tie-in with the movie Adventures in Babysitting, which  <br/>
has one of the actors from Rent, which is her current favorite musical.<br/>
