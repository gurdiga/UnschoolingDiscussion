school guarantees that you will be able to make a living (not).<br/>

This reminds me of a conversation I had with my husband last night.  The company he works for gives a small, but significant in this rural area, scholarship every year to a graduate from the local high school.  He is involved in the process of choosing the recipient this year & was commenting on how dismal all of the candidates are and mostly was surprised that although most of them had 3.4+ averages at school, they only scored about 650 on the SATs.  <br/>
<br/>
This sparked a great conversation about success & how public school&#39;s idea of success is all about numbers (including $$&#39;s) and the process of &quot;teaching&quot; kids and testing them only keeps them from learning how to think for themselves.  That&#39;s why they have trouble in college, no one is babysitting them thru an assignment.  No one offers a list of ideas when a paper is due.  Suddenly, they are required to think for themselves and without a parent on hand to make sure they make it to class.  LOTS of kids change majors many times, spend 5 or more years trying to get a degree all the while having a great time spending their parent&#39;s money.  It&#39;s no wonder they don&#39;t know what kind of job interests them, or what kind of classes might be fun.  And it&#39;s no wonder that they get upset when their first job is one that makes them unhappy, because they&#39;re working where their friends work and still following the crowd rather than their own interests.  <br/>
<br/>
Most kids raising in schools don&#39;t really know what they are interested in without someone telling them, even if that someone is the crowd.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Unschooling has changed me in so many ways!  Since we became &quot;unschoolers,&quot; my husband and I have examined what our children must do for us to approve of them.    Will we love our children more if they grow up to do a job that carries a lot of social clout?   We think it&#39;s more important for them to find work that brings them joy.  But that isn&#39;t something we are shooting for &quot;when they grow up.&quot;  It&#39;s what our lives are based on right now.  What others see as their play, we see as their work.   <br/>
<br/>
My husband is a lawyer with successful side businesses.  Is he a better person, or more important, than our friend who is a welder?   Or is my husband more important than I am--because I am not employed anywhere?   What do your children need to do to be &quot;good enough&quot;  for you and your husband?<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed reading Barbara Sher&#39;s book &quot;I Could Do Anything:  If only I Knew What it Was.&#39;&#39;   It really opened my eyes about how our expectations can affect our kids.<br/>

cheers up little kids who are sitting in the baby seats of carts,  <br/>
bored and tired of the store.  He runs to get things people have   <br/>
forgotten or couldn&#39;t find.  He helps the clerks, and brings in the  <br/>
carts.  It&#39;s good exercise, he sees all kinds of people, and he&#39;s  <br/>
doing things that are directly and immediately helpful to other  <br/>
people who have chosen to be there and who appreciate someone  <br/>
friendly and useful.<br/>
<br/>
Things like that should pay better. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 21 year old daughter goes to a university full time and works half  <br/>
time. She&#39;s a senior and is majoring in Recreation and Leisure  <br/>
Studies. Her goal is to run her own fine arts camp for adults and  <br/>
kids. She is president of the Recreation Students Association and is  <br/>
earning certificates in &quot;Outdoor Education,&quot; &quot;Event Planning,&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;Environment and Land Management,&quot; along with her bachelor degree.  <br/>
Last weekend, she was the honored guest at the California State Parks  <br/>
and Recreation Association annual conference. They gave a breakfast  <br/>
in her honor and she was also honored at a dinner banquet. They gave  <br/>
her a check for $1,500 - the largest scholarship offered by the state  <br/>
association. She brought me a copy of the speech someone gave about  <br/>
her and it ended with, &quot;If any of you have job openings in your  <br/>
cities or organizations, I have three words of advice: Hire this girl!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She works 20 hours per week at an after-school child care program  <br/>
where she was originally hired as a teacher&#39;s aide and was soon  <br/>
advanced to be an actual teacher.<br/>
<br/>
She lives at home because she can and because she is fine with living  <br/>
with her family - not in a big rush to get away. She&#39;s paying for a  <br/>
lot of her own college expenses and for all of her own personal  <br/>
expenses, like clothing and gas for her car. We never really  <br/>
discussed that - but when she had her own money, she just started  <br/>
handling those things herself. We pay for her car insurance. She&#39;s  <br/>
saved several thousand dollars and intends to use that when she does  <br/>
move out. She&#39;s planning to go to graduate school, so she might live  <br/>
at home for a couple of more years. Or, she might go to grad school  <br/>
somewhere else and move out then. No hurry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753886167">You can look at www.grownwithoutschooling.com can&#39;t say they were all<br/>
radically unschooled but they are grown homeschooling types.  Wendy<br/>
Priesnitz&#39;s daughter I beleive was what we might call &#39;raddicaly&#39;<br/>
unschooled.  I couldn&#39;t find info specifically on her -quickly- but<br/>
you could follow this link <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifemedia.ca/wendy/bio.html">http://www.lifemedia.ca/wendy/bio.html</a> to<br/>
find the information I&#39;m sure.  Her daughter was an author or<br/>
journalist -I think- I know that somewhere there is a write up on her<br/>
on either the Life Learning or Natural Life magazine websites.<br/>
<br/>
Also in all the reading I&#39;ve done the thing that stands out for me is<br/>
not the &#39;impresiveness&#39; of the ocupations these unschooled children<br/>
have chosen but the &#39;rightness&#39; of the ocupations for them.  The<br/>
satisfaction of acheiving what they desire.  The fact that most have<br/>
seemed to, well not allways &#39;known&#39; exactlly what they want, but at<br/>
least have the ability to recognise what doen&#39;t work and move on to<br/>
something different.  None of the stories have expressed regret at a<br/>
large block of wasted time -like a year or ten- while the person tried<br/>
to live up to the expectations of others.  <br/>
