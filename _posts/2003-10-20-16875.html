<div id="ygrps-yiv-599108601">Heh . . .  The game Set has been mentioned a number of times, so I <br/>
googled & ebayed for it . . . but of course &quot;set&quot; is such a common word <br/>
. . .<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me a clue on maybe the maker of the game so that i can <br/>
narrow the search?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
(And thank you so much for all your advice about the Scrabble!!  I am <br/>
feeling much more confident about how I want to play games with him . . <br/>
