<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853320895">You generally need to either set up your own non-profit or work with a local<br/>
bank.  Big banks usually can&#39;t be bothered unless you are talking big bucks.<br/>
Locally owned banks will usually have a trust department that can help set<br/>
up a trust fund that will handle the fund for you.<br/>
<br/>
There are also organizations such as we have locally (Humboldt Area<br/>
Foundation) that handle these things on a regional level.<br/>
<br/>
You could also check with United Way to see if there is someone/thing local<br/>
that could help you.  Or perhaps the Lion&#39;s Club or one of the other clubs<br/>
would help.<br/>
<br/>
We have run memorial funds through all of these various organizations so<br/>
that we wouldn&#39;t have to go to the trouble and expense of setting up a<br/>
non-profit.<br/>
