<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211885166">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
We currently have no animals.  So I was reading with intrigue the thread on<br/>
putting animals to sleep.  I remember once having a conversation with my<br/>
mother when I was about 7 and telling her that I wouldn&#39;t be putting her in<br/>
a cemetry or anything like that as I would be burying her in the back garden<br/>
in a trash bag, just like she did to our cat!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes given my mother&#39;s negative attitude towards what DH and I are<br/>
doing with our kids, at 44 this still seems like a good idea!!!<br/>

I don&#39;t see that you mentioned death up above, so I guess that wasn&#39;t a <br/>
pre-requisite to the burial in a trashbag.<br/>
<br/>
My mother and I have exchanged kindly a few kindly letters lately.  She lives <br/>
maybe eight miles away.  I haven&#39;t been there.  She wrote me to let me know <br/>
my half brother stole all her money and her cash card.  We knew he was in <br/>
town, because he went to the emergency room and charged it to us. If he shows <br/>
up at my house, I have a fantasy of him joining our cats.   Not the live ones <br/>
asleep on the couch.<br/>
<br/>
He was a sweet little boy, but he&#39;s an evil 30 year old man.<br/>

when he calls.  She has no money to give him but it bothers her that he only <br/>
calls every 5 years or so and he begs for money.  I try to be there for her <br/>
so she has someone to talk to and listen to her but I have no point of <br/>
reference and no suggestions to make it easier.  I only hope that I help my <br/>
being a sounding board.  It is so sad.<br/>

extra acreage they&#39;re not using?<br/>
<br/>
My ex-mother-in-law, the retired schoolteacher, began again on Julian&#39;s dad <br/>
about how horrible homeschooling is, and that, apparently, I am lying about <br/>
Julian&#39;s not being required to be tested. (Also, if Perry, Julian&#39;s dad, <br/>
really wants to stop the war, he should go to law school.) <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so sad to me that she disapporoves so much of her son, who is really a <br/>
very good, succesful person. Also, that in her being so convinced that <br/>
homeschooling is horrible and Julian couldn&#39;t be learning anything, she <br/>
communicates to him that she doesn&#39;t value anything that Julian is doing. I <br/>
just keep wondering...has she ever TALKED to this kid???? <br/>
<br/>
Sigh....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good plan. mY mother-in-law arrives Wednesday. When can we have her plot ready?<br/>
I&#39;m dreading it :-(<br/>
FIL is coming too. Just think, a high school physics teacher (MIL) and a university<br/>
lecturer(FIL) both of whom think academia is the ultimate in human existance and if you<br/>
don&#39;t have a degree you are stupid and not worth diddly.<br/>
Best get that Xanax prescription filled....<br/>

I guess she would be deceased.  I hadn&#39;t thought about that part much.<br/>
Maybe your brother would like to join my mother......<br/>
