<div id="ygrps-yiv-918730875">This being Election Day and all, I thought I&#39;d ask who has &quot;Kids&#39;s<br/>
Vote&quot; in their state?  (Where they provide ballots for children at the<br/>
polls and announce the kid vote winners on the 6pm news).  We didn&#39;t<br/>
in NY or LA, but did in NC and MD.<br/>

My son would be insulted by &quot;Kids Vote.&quot;  He&#39;s fairly radical. &lt;g&gt;  He<br/>
thinks kids should be able to vote and believes he&#39;s being denied his<br/>
constitutional right.   If he was on the Simpsons right now the<br/>
&quot;independent thought alarms&quot; would be screaming. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m giving my vote to Dylan this year.  I&#39;ll sign in at the polls and<br/>
once were in the booth he can fill out the ballot.   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s always come with me to vote and they give kids ballots to fill out<br/>
if they want them, but there&#39;s no count of kid votes here as far as I<br/>
know. <br/>
<br/>
Did anyone watch the Dead Ringers Election special?   Very funny!<br/>
