<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126451465">Hi Kim<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty newly committed to unschooling myself, but I can give you <br/>
advice that I always give parents who ask me (been homeschooling for <br/>
eight years) That advice is: take a whole entire year to just be with <br/>
your kids. Don&#39;t make them do any academics at all, but answer any <br/>
questions they have and do things with them. Don&#39;t worry whether <br/>
they&#39;re learning anything or not. Just be with them. With regular <br/>
homeschooling, the first year after they come home, playing with <br/>
them, hanging out with them, doing stuff together, or letting them do <br/>
their own thing, re-establishes your relationship with them. That is <br/>
the MOST important thing. MUCH MORE important than academics.<br/>
<br/>
Others on this list will have advice for you, I know it ;) Read! John <br/>
Holt! unschooling.com articles! and let your kids do their thing, <br/>
enjoying them, pulling them into your world, dwelling in their world <br/>
with them. I would say this to you even if you weren&#39;t thinking of <br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s an important first step.<br/>
<br/>
peace, HeidiC<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725792988">First, read everything on Sandra&#39;s site.  www.sandradodd.com<br/>
Next, read everything at www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
THose two should answer just about every questions you have or might have.<br/>
<br/>
When we first started our unschooling process I was a little sneaky in my <br/>
answers to my husband.  He&#39;s not all that thrilled with the idea of <br/>
homeschooling but he lets me make those decisions because he trusts me.  Now <br/>
UNschooling?  He&#39;d flip before I&#39;d ever even get a chance to explain, so I&#39;m <br/>
draggin him to the conference in SC and THEN I&#39;ll really let him in on it.  <br/>
&lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today, my 4, 5 and 6 yr olds played the games on the Harry Potter DVD.  One <br/>
game is all comprehension questions from the movie.  If you get them right, <br/>
you open the chamber of secrets, in a nutshell.  When he asked what they <br/>
did, I said they worked on their comprehension skills.<br/>
<br/>
We also went grocery shopping and they helped me find the price per ounce on <br/>
many items so we could save a buck.  I told him they worked on math and <br/>
consumer skills.<br/>
<br/>
We read several books including one about the Amazon and one about Chris <br/>
Columbus.  History and science.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s there, you just have to look to see it.  None of those things were <br/>
&#39;intentional&#39;, they just naturally happened.  My 5 yr old picked the Amazon <br/>
book because the pictures were cool.  I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to explain the <br/>
video games...:)<br/>
<br/>
Just keep erading and absorbing and watching your kids.  Relax, go to the <br/>
park, bake, read together.  You will be amazed!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134954209">Kim, <br/>
<br/>
Before we began each step I would read snips from the Internet that explained <br/>
what I felt he needed to know. My husband doesn&#39;t listen long and often has <br/>
one eye on the TV so I read and hopped he herd something I said. He did.<br/>
<br/>
Every one thought we HS&#39;ed but really we deschooled and then Unschooled. Not <br/>
many people know what Unschooling is here so I never botherd to explaine <br/>
unless someone asked what we do all day. I will not tell them we work in <br/>
workbooks I refuse to lie to satisfy someone else&#39;s thoughts for what are <br/>
&quot;saposta be doing&quot; in their little world. <br/>
So far when people ask they are actually impressed and say wow I wish I could <br/>
have done that. They look at my son and say gee your a lucky boy.<br/>
Let them deschool if dh asks tell him that you read that deschooling will <br/>
help them in the process. Once you are done deschooling he will be relaxed <br/>
also and you should be able to move right into Unschooling. That&#39;s how I did <br/>
it.<br/>
