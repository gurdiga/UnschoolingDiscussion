<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391355798">Hi Lisa,<br/>
It could be that he feels that because his brother asks so many questions<br/>
that he doesn,t have the opportunity to ask his or that he doesn&#39;t need to<br/>
ask his. You hear about this kind of  thing with babies, when they talk late<br/>
because the older siblings do all the talking for them. Perhaps you could<br/>
set aside a time daily or weekly and ask him if he has any questions. You<br/>
could also have him keep a journal and questions might pop up in his daily<br/>
reflections. Of course if this isn&#39;t the reason, then these things may or<br/>
may not make a differnce. Just a suggestion.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling Question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi all! I have a question that has been concerning me about my kids. I<br/>
have a<br/>
&gt; 9 1/2yr. old son and a 7yr. old son. My 9 yr old will ask me every<br/>
question<br/>
&gt; under the sun about everything in life. Together we find and search out<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; answers to all his questions (and sometimes he reads and searches for<br/>
answers<br/>
&gt; by himself). But, my 7 yr. old never asks us any questions about anything.<br/>
He<br/>
&gt; loves dinosaurs and big trucks. He does a lot of dinosaur digging in the<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; yard and he plays with his trucks most of the day. He looks at picture<br/>
books<br/>
&gt; but doesn&#39;t yet read. I haven&#39;t pushed him in anyway to learn anything.<br/>
But,<br/>
&gt; yet he asks us no questions about anything. Is this strange or normal or<br/>
&gt; what? Is it because he learns in a different way? Should I be concerned or<br/>
&gt; just let things be? Any suggestions? I would appreciate some advice about<br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
&gt; Lisa H.<br/>
