I had an idea, not really solid, but wanted to toss it out there and see what <br/>
you all thought. <br/>
I was thinking it would be fun to have a little memento of each <br/>
unschooling.com persons state that they&#39;re from ( or specific location).<br/>
I could bring some sand and shells from the beach, or other interesting <br/>
article to signify Pensacola.  I could take home a box with little goodies <br/>
from all these other places and an image of a face to go with it, that would <br/>
be really cool!!!<br/>
I also thought it would be fun to trade with other artists.<br/>
Is there something you make that would be fun to trade for?<br/>
Just a thought. Maybe it&#39;s too much work, I was just rolling this around in <br/>
my head and wanted to know what other&#39;s would think about it.<br/>

As usual we agree.<br/>
I can bring something from Maryland AND West Virginia since we will be in<br/>
between both.<br/>
MMmmm. Bluegrass and steamed Blue Crabs!!!<br/>
I&#39;m really not sure that I can fit a whole band and bushel in my carry-on. I<br/>

That&#39;s a neat idea you have, Ren, but you have it so easy with sand and<br/>
shells.<br/>
Let&#39;s see...what could I bring from AZ?<br/>
Little pieces of fallen cholla cactus?<br/>
Mesquite bean pods which native american indians used to grind into flour?<br/>
Little branches of creosote bush?<br/>
Prickly pear cactus candy?<br/>
I&#39;d have to think more about this.<br/>

I like to make those little rock paintings - when I have time and when I&#39;m<br/>

for the raffle, that would be WONDERFUL! <br/>
<br/>
Everyone will also get canvas &quot;goody bags&quot;. You may certainly bring something <br/>
from home, well-packaged, that we could stuff in the bags. <br/>
<br/>
I will have some way for AlwaysLearning and Unschooling.commies (love that!) <br/>
to be identified. PLEASE put your info (screen name) on the registration <br/>
forms.<br/>

group. We live in upstate SC so it&#39;s an easy drive for us. I am SO <br/>
excited! I get to come to an unschooling conference, which is <br/>
something I&#39;ve never done, I get to meet Sandra and others whose <br/>
stuff I&#39;ve been reading for years and who have been such a great <br/>
influence on our homeschooling lives, I get to room with three <br/>
friends who are some of my favorite people in the world, and I get to <br/>
be there without husband or son for a couple of days (they&#39;re going <br/>
camping), which is something I haven&#39;t ever done either. I don&#39;t see <br/>

I ran into Dee (can&#39;t remember her last name) from the<br/>
University of Georgia&#39;s ecology Lab last week and she<br/>
gave a plug for your Conference!  There were a lot of<br/>
people at her presentation who had questions so I<br/>
didn&#39;t get a chance to ask her what she was doing at<br/>
the conference, and then later when I did get to speak<br/>
with her I forgot to ask! Those senior moments are<br/>
getting more frequent!!<br/>
<br/>
She did a cool class for our homeschool group on the<br/>
scientific method and paper airplanes.  My boys have<br/>
been making planes, modifying them, etc. all week!  It<br/>
is amazing how much science kids can learn from paper<br/>
planes! She also brought alligators with her and other<br/>
reptiles and amphibians.  <br/>
<br/>
I am going to see if I can get a group of us moms to<br/>
come up for the conference.  Do you have a webpage?  I<br/>
know you probably already posted, but I am so busy<br/>
that sometimes I just scan the posts.  <br/>

discussing it this weekend. She has so many great ideas! Hard to choose!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
