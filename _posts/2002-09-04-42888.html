<div id="ygrps-yiv-299122919">Ren,  I don&#39;t know you very well yet but from what I&#39;ve read you&#39;ve always had good suggestions.  I bet you won&#39;t have a problem at all,  Go Get Them!!  <br/>
I wish I had the same courage to do that,  in my community I don&#39;t know of any unschoolers yet.  So I would love to post something on the bulletin board at the library or something like that, but I&#39;m feeling still a bit green.  We have so many conservative thinkers up here!  It&#39;s hard enough for me to convince my dh and the rest of my family, that we are doing the right thing, let alone a whole group of people.  Maybe in a few months...I have a pretty big mouth so it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for me.  I just know I want to have all my answers down to all questions!  <br/>
Thanks Ren for your advice, keep it up!<br/>

I attended a Christian homeschool conference a couple of years ago. The talk <br/>
of &quot;gentle discipline&quot; interested me. Well, I got to walk out on this one. <br/>
The talk was anything but gentle, all about &quot;spare the rod and spoil the <br/>
child&quot;. The man told stories of his wonderfully behaved and respectful <br/>
children. Personally I think they were scared to death. Daddy didn&#39;t hesitate <br/>
to bring out the belt. He had to use it on his grown son &quot;just to remind him <br/>
not to talk back to his wife&quot;. &quot;I taught him better&quot;. <br/>
Besides leaving the talk, I put my complaints in writing. Plus they had one <br/>
less participant the next year. I never realized how hypocritical Christians <br/>
can be. I&#39;m Christian and certainly don&#39;t act that way. Interesting in how <br/>
some interpret Christ&#39;s teachings. <br/>
The other part that turned me off was in the exhibit hall. One of the <br/>
exhibitors was selling chore charts that had a place for &quot;appropriate <br/>
punishment&quot; for not doing the chore. Spanking with a switch/paddle was a <br/>
frequent choice. This lovely little girl was telling me about the chart. She <br/>
didn&#39;t think anything about the spanking. &quot;It makes me a better person; it&#39;s <br/>
for my own good&quot;. ACK!<br/>
<br/>
Ginny, glad I walked out<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that the majority of Christian homeschoolers are rude, or spank <br/>
your kids types, (many are. but then many non-Christians are rude and spank <br/>
their kids, so it isn&#39;t exclusive.) but I do think that the majority of <br/>
Christians (or anyone who homeschools for a religious reason) use a <br/>
curriculum because they  have a philosophy on accountability, and seem to see <br/>
unschooling as not being very accountable. And they seem to think that one <br/>
reason unschooling isn&#39;t right is because you aren&#39;t accountable. Then again, <br/>
I know of Christian Unschoolers too, so is that an oxymoron? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well there are Christian homeschoolers who homeschool for religious reasons<br/>
and homeschoolers who are Christian who homeschool for the same reasons that<br/>
concern nonChristians.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling along with wifely submission, courting, head scarves and so on<br/>
and so forth is becoming a sort of strongly urged direction in many<br/>
fundamentalists Christian circles to protect the kids from secular/evil<br/>
ideas. So there&#39;s a greater percentage with that type of thinking among<br/>
homeschoolers than outside of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that perhaps make the fundamentalist Christians seem more<br/>
prominent is that since they have a common religious and educational goal,<br/>
they tend to form strong support groups. But your run of the mill<br/>
homeschooler (Christian or non) is just interested in their kids and helping<br/>
them learn and there just isn&#39;t that same passionate drive and need to form<br/>
support groups. We nonfundamentalist Christian homeschoolers may be greater<br/>
in number but we&#39;re just not banded together!<br/>
<br/>
(Though in some areas of the country the fundamentalist Christians are<br/>
overwhelmingly dominant.)<br/>
