&lt;&lt; Why can&#39;t I just play the piano and SUCK but love it??  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Hey, *I* do that!!!<br/>
<br/>
Right now I have a little pump organ, probably from WWII.  I play hymns and <br/>
Clementi sonatas and easy Bach stuff.  When they go off the end (too high a <br/>
range) I just jump down an octave until it will fit again, and if I make <br/>
mistakes I don&#39;t care, and I play really loud, and I don&#39;t practice the hard <br/>
parts and then I walk away smiling.   It&#39;s like running just for fun, without <br/>
a destination, without a witness, without timing yourself.  It&#39;s like <br/>
swinging on a swing, or playing a game.<br/>
