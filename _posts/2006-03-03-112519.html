<div id="ygrps-yiv-833800895">Just a reminder -- the 9th nonsectarian InHome (formerly HOUSE)<br/>
Homeschool Conference will kick off one week from tomorrow, March 10<br/>
and 11 at the Sheraton Chicago Northwest in Arlington Heights,<br/>
northwest of Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is always my yearly shot in the arm to help me know I&#39;m doing<br/>
the right thing and am still on track.&quot;<br/>
                                    -- Past conference attendee<br/>
<br/>
The conference will include over 150 children&#39;s and 70 adult<br/>
workshops. Featured speakers this year will be Patrick Farenga<br/>
(Growing Without Schooling), Penny Gardner (Charlotte Mason Study<br/>
Guide), and Robin Schneider (Teaching Science Skills at Home without<br/>
being a Rocket Scientist).<br/>
<br/>
The Vendors Hall (over 50 Vendors), as always, is open to the<br/>
public. Check their websites at:<br/>
