<div id="ygrps-yiv-147348471">I recently decided that I was not really comfortable with saying that I am <br/>
a &quot;homeschool&quot; or an &quot;unschooler&quot;  I think the former leads people to think <br/>
that I &quot;school&quot; at home, which I don&#39;t, and the latter makes them look at me <br/>
strangely.  I have found myself using the word &quot;home-educater&quot; and then I see <br/>
people actually thinking a moment to try and figure out just what that might <br/>
be.  But if I really think about it, I am really a &quot; home- education <br/>
co-creator&quot; because it really is a partnership with my daughter not a <br/>
teacher-student relationship.    But I think if I said that, I might get <br/>
those strange looks again!  I guess in the end, I just don&#39;t like labels.  I <br/>
really don&#39;t like defining myself or who I am or what I do .  I just am.  And <br/>
almost any day with no notice at all, who I am might change.  And that&#39;s the <br/>
way I like it.  Jackie</div>
