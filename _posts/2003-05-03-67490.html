 </span></blockquote>Thank you, David.  Interesting article.  I&#39;ll give the idea a try. <br/>
<br/>
And by the way, I enjoyed your recent HEM article about the &#39;head thru your <br/>
interlocked arms&#39; thingy.  I can do it too!  I figured most people could do <br/>
it, til I asked some hsing moms one day and I was the only one who could.  I <br/>
do have long arms though.  It was fun!<br/>

&quot;It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>
of freedom.&quot;<br/>

Remedial Education&quot;.) There are summer schools being required all <br/>
over the country, but they can&#39;t do it by September 1, we&#39;ll have to <br/>
leave the rest of the moms back.<br/>
