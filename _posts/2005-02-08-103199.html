<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351508805">My sister is ready to try homeschooling!!!!!  She&#39;s just moved to <br/>
Memphis and the mid-school her son attends is toxic.  <br/>
<br/>
I visited the HSLDA site to get the basics, and she could do this, <br/>
but I&#39;m hoping to find local contacts for her.  She&#39;s not online <br/>
yet -- later this month she will be -- so I told her I&#39;d help her <br/>
find some local contacts.  My first thought was to see if anyone I <br/>
already know is in TN.<br/>

Thanks, Karen!  I just called her and gave her the names & numbers.  I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be calling them any moment now.  She just contacted the school district office and was first told she&#39;d need to ask permission for a waiver of the August deadline.  She replied to them that she&#39;d talked to someone who told her that since there&#39;s a 30 day deadline for newcomers to enroll in public school, she also had 30 days to register as a homeschooler.  At which point the contact said, &quot;okay, that makes sense -- I&#39;ll send the package to you.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Let me say, for my sis this is huge -- she&#39;s not the most pro-active of people, and often will take No for an answer.  <br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;d called the phone voicemail number for a group listed at TNHomeed.com as the Memphis Area Home Educators and reached a recording saying it was a non-published number followed by a busy signal, so she was worried about finding someone.  From what I found online, it looks like most of the groups are church-based -- she&#39;s pagan/wiccan, so she really needs an inclusive group.<br/>

MHEA is a Christian group, fyi.<br/>

She doesn&#39;t have to register with the school district.  She can  register <br/>
with a church related school.  Mary Jo can help you with all  that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789996482">this is what I was talking about last week. You can register with the <br/>
local board of education wherever you live, but you have to meet certain <br/>
requirements. There are a few Church related schools that do not require <br/>
you to sign a statement of faith. do check out the TnHomeEd website, it <br/>
has a lot of good info, including what schools do not require a <br/>
statement of faith.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640634125">Thanks, everyone, for all the ideas and links.  Sunny (my sis) got a call back from Mary Jo, with the Memphis unschoolers group, and was very happy to hear it&#39;s not as bad as she&#39;d feared to homeschool in TN.  The group has several outings/events coming up, so they&#39;ll show up for some of those activities and find their way around.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am just so happy for her kids -- the description of their experiences in Memphis schools was a nightmare, and they only enrolled on Jan 21.  I&#39;m so pleased she&#39;s doing this for them, and of course thrilled to have them also homeschooling.  I&#39;ve always thought she&#39;d make a great homeschooler -- and if she spends enough time with unschoolers, she&#39;ll see how easy it all can really be.<br/>

Some do, some don&#39;t.  The ones that don&#39;t usually don&#39;t require  testing, <br/>
either.  There are far more restrictions on you if you are going  through the <br/>
school district, and there&#39;s some discussion about whether high  schoolers have <br/>
to take the benchmark exams that public school kids take.  A  parent also has <br/>
to have a 4 year degree to homeschool a high schooler, but not  through a <br/>
church school.  <br/>
 <br/>
It all depends on how she wants to play the game.  It&#39;s good to know  all <br/>
options.  I second the recommendation for _www.tnhomeed.com_ <br/>

She&#39;s found that there&#39;s a pagan/wicca group there actually organized as a legal church there in Memphis, and is hoping to connect with them and find out if there are any homeschoolers there as well.  <br/>
 <br/>
She and I&#39;ve heard from three different folks who recommended Home Life Academy, so she&#39;s probably going to go with that option.  The whole parent education thing is also a question for her, because she got her GED, so she wasn&#39;t sure if that was considered to be a &#39;real&#39; high school diploma for TN&#39;s purposes.  <br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;ll figure it all out.  They&#39;ve only been there three weeks, she could just as easily announce she&#39;d decided to move back to Ft. Worth, disappear for a month or two (she has family there, too) and come back under the radar.  She&#39;s managed to connect with unschoolers there, so I&#39;m confident she&#39;ll do just fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586843807">Well, the church still has to be willing to set up a Church Related School under TN law, and from what she can tell Summerland Grove hasn&#39;t done anything like that.  She is very happy to have found them, tho, since she&#39;s been affiliated with the UU-CUUPS in the past, but there&#39;s not one CUUPS group (don&#39;t know if there are UU&#39;s there) in the entire state of TN.  <br/>
 <br/>
This is a major move for them -- her dh is Ft. Worth born & bred, all his family are there.  She&#39;s been in Ft. Worth for 14 of the last 20 yrs.  All their friends are in Ft.Worth, and they have no family nearby (for the first time in their lives) in Memphis.  So, she&#39;s there in a very Christian place, with hostile schools, no friends and not even any family to turn to. This whole school issue could have really overwhelmed her (she tends to overwhelm easily) but instead she&#39;s turning it into a real triumph for her family.<br/>

Yeah, and there are some serious requirements, including accreditation  stuff <br/>

There ARE people in Memphis who can be like family.  I hope she finds  them.<br/>
