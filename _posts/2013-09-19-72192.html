I understand being 16 I was there once although she don&#39;t believe it, I also understand she is in a very hard spot now but with directly saying it she and her boyfriend put themselves in this situation now I am pulling my hair out an have stressed how she really needs some sort of diploma but is refusing to do anything to help herself.

what I have been expecting my daughter to do for schooling during the day......my concern is everything she &quot;learns&quot; is not documented and I have nothing to show for an evaluation or if the school district wants to review her files not sure how to handle that-=-</span></div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue',

63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;">It looks to me like there was no deschooling for the child or the mom. &nbsp;Deschooling can&#39;t start until expectations or schooling learning are dropped, for months. &nbsp; &quot;Nothing to show&quot; means the mom hasn&#39;t learned to see learning where it is.</div><div

Roboto;">And VERY often a parent beleive she is required to document more than she actually needs to. &nbsp;So clinging to that fear and belief can keep unschooling from working.</div><div

unschooling. &nbsp;Netflix about subjects, ditto.</div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif,

about anything in the whole world. &nbsp;Let information flow, and connections will begin to build up.</div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63,

href="http://sandradodd.com/math">http://sandradodd.com/math</a> (but look at games, and puzzles, and mystery stories, and all kinds of logic as math. &nbsp;If you can&#39;t see that yet, you the mom

Roboto;">It&#39;s not fair or accurate to say you&#39;ve been unschooling for a year if you&#39;re still wanting her (at 16) to be playing math games so you can document it.</div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;"><br></div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;">There must have been factors already in play that caused you to want to take her out of school, or to stop using a curriculum. &nbsp;Unschooling isn&#39;t the problem (especially since it seems not to have had an opportunity to take hold.</div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;"><br></div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;">But the hard part: &nbsp;pregnancy</div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;">This might be a hard time to learn to be partners, because there&#39;s a danger of biological conflict if you try to own her and control what she does now, and how.</div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;"><br></div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;">I recommend being as nurturing as you can be, and giving her opportunities to make choices, all the while looking seriously at how you can better understand unschooling. &nbsp;It&#39;s going to take over a year for either of you to recover from schooling, and tehre is something pressing and overwhelming happening in the middle of it all. &nbsp;</div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;"><br></div><div style="margin:0px;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;">If you haven&#39;t already, subscribe to Pam Laricchia&#39;s intro to unschooling. &nbsp;Slowly, read each one twice (not right in a row—a few hours or a day later. &nbsp;Let those ideas percolate through you, patiently and openly.</div><div

It is equal to a GED. It just required parental consent for those under 18. See if you have something like that where you live. I am so happy that I did not waste anymore time in school and I think the &quot;diploma&quot; helped my Mom not worry as much about what I did next. So I got to &quot;unschool&quot; the rest of my life. :) And now I am unschooling my own kids with passion. </span></div><div><span style="">I hope you find peace and less fear. </span></div><div><span style="">Good Luck ! :) <br></span></div><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote type="cite"><div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1426148371ygrps-yiv-1549234550ygrp-text"><div><br></div>
