<div id="ygrps-yiv-35502663">My grandson is left handed - we saw that when he was just a baby.<br/>
We have never made an issue of it, but once in a while I will<br/>
notice that he is using his right hand  (eating, writing).  He<br/>
can only use scissors right handed!!  I bought him left-hand<br/>
scissors, and they don&#39;t work for him.  I think he is semi-ambi.<br/>
Anyway, I say all that to say that I think it is important to not<br/>
make any kind of issue over it - they have to do what seems natural<br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
I sit facing him when we are working with paper and pencil work.<br/>
He is just 1st grade and prints - and for the most part has done<br/>
well in drawing his letters the &quot;proper&quot; way.  I gave him a printing<br/>
guide that has the arrows showing the way to draw the letters, but<br/>
left it up to him.<br/>
<br/>
It is funny - my facing him while we work - I get mixed up which is<br/>
my right and left hand!!!  *grin*   Of course, maybe I can&#39;t blame<br/>
that for my own confusion - I am probably having some of those<br/>
&quot;Senior moments&quot;!!!<br/>
