not working weekends any more any way...could happen. I&#39;d have to get on <br/>

(6 and older) to do. Not sure a bout the little ones. My kids are going to spend<br/>
the day with their Pops and Nana and GG (their great grandmother) since my dad lives<br/>
about 10 mins away and my grandmother will be down to visit.<br/>

I think there is an email on at mhea.com...you could ask them.<br/>

<br/>
BTW, where is the conference in SC? Is there anything else exciting around<br/>
there? Hubby is thinking about making it into a road trip (I am still<br/>
trying to convince him that the conference would be fun too, but we will<br/>
see...he just keeps rolling his eyes...)<br/>

guessing that you signed up for the unschooling session?<br/>
<br/>
It should be fun. This is my first conference. And although it does not have<br/>
the same great lineup they have in SC, there are still some good looking <br/>
sessions. Plus I save on shipping for my order from Fun Books!<br/>

<br/>
I just need to figure out logistics...mainly trying to figure out how to get my kids<br/>
into the car that early in the morning (we would probably need to leave pick you up<br/>
around 7:30am - still game??)<br/>

I&#39;m 5&#39;2&quot;. Brown, short hair. average weight.  You should be able to <br/>

We could color coordinate.  All wear the same color shirt....<br/>

SC?! I&#39;m having trouble making plans for 3 days from now, and you ask me <br/>
about AUGUST?! Who knows! Seriously, I&#39;d love to, but my life right now <br/>
is in terrific flux and we currently have no source of income, so that <br/>
just seems incredibly far away to me.<br/>
