<div id="ygrps-yiv-961263489">Regarding Danielle&#39;s comments from Friday about sending the Native <br/>
American&#39;s to Carlisle, PA...<br/>
<br/>
We recently seen a movie entitled The Education of Little Tree.  I <br/>
remember thinking when the authorities hauled Little Tree off from the <br/>
family he loved to go to white man&#39;s school, I wonder how many <br/>
unschoolers have seen this and made the connection of the similarity <br/>
with unschooling.  Otherwise the movie gives a great view into what the <br/>
kids went through.<br/>

Thanks for inadverdently reminding me, Danielle!<br/>

biographical and turned out to be entirely fabricated.   I would say &quot;fictional&quot; but it <br/>

I can understand how it being fiction instead of a bio, when it was  <br/>
portrayed as such, being a scandal and very disappointing to a lot of  people.  But <br/>
the story itself is still a very, very sweet story.  It&#39;s  such an UNSCHOOLING <br/>
story.  Whether it&#39;s real or fake, it&#39;s still a story  that shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
missed...I liked the movie too.  The grandfather is  played by James Cromwell, the <br/>
guy who played the farmer in &quot;Babe.&quot;  I  really like him, and the woman who <br/>
plays the grandmother (Tantoo Cardinal) and  it makes me sad that they did such <br/>
good work, but a lot of people won&#39;t see it  because of the Scandal (they <br/>
didn&#39;t know at the time it was made, from what I  understand.)<br/>
 <br/>
FWIW, I think it&#39;s worth a read and a peek.<br/>

Asa Earl Carter, Writer / Fraud<br/>
     •      Born: 4 September 1925<br/>
     •      Birthplace: Anniston, Alabama<br/>
     •      Died: 7 June 1979<br/>
     •      Best Known As: Author of The Education of Little Tree<br/>
<br/>
 Asa Carter was a speechwriter for Alabama politician George Wallace<br/>
<br/>
 in the 1960s, but gained more fame in the &#39;70s and &#39;80s as novelist Forrest <br/>
Carter, whose book &quot;The Education of Little Tree&quot; was a bestseller. The book <br/>
purported to be an autobiographical account of growing up in Tennessee with <br/>
Cherokee grandparents. First published in 1976 (and re-issued in 1986), it was <br/>
considered by many to be an instant classic of Native American literature. After <br/>
Carter died (from injuries he got in a 1979 fistfight), it was revealed that <br/>
he was, in fact, Asa Earl Carter, a former radio announcer and Ku Klux Klan <br/>
member, and that his &quot;autobiography&quot; was a work of fiction.<br/>
<br/>
 Carter also wrote Gone To Texas (1973), which became the Clint Eastwood <br/>
movie The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s from answers.com<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/asa-earl-carter">http://www.answers.com/topic/asa-earl-carter</a><br/>
<br/>
And they have other links, one of which lead to this:<br/>
<br/>
 Asa Carter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Determined to &quot;outnigger&quot; the opposition in his 1962 bid for governor, George <br/>
Wallace turned to the politics of race with a new fiery speechwriter, Asa <br/>
Carter. Carter, a right-wing radio announcer and founder of his own Ku Klux Klan <br/>
organization, was a man with a dark, troubling past. &quot;He had a long history of <br/>
violence, in fact, it’s not an exaggeration to call him something of a kind <br/>
of psychopath,&quot; says Wallace biographer Dan Carter. Asa Carter had shot two men <br/>
in a dispute over money just a few years before joining Wallace’s campaign, <br/>
and his Klan group shared his volatile temperament. &quot;In one eighteen-month <br/>
period,&quot; recounts Dan Carter in his George Wallace biography, &quot;his followers <br/>
joined in the stoning of Autherine Lucy on the University of Alabama campus, <br/>
assaulted black singer Nat King Cole on a Birmingham stage, beat Birmingham civil <br/>
rights activist Fred Shuttlesworth and stabbed his wife, and, in what was billed <br/>
as a warning to potential black ‘trouble-makers,’ castrated a <br/>
randomly-chosen, slightly retarded black handyman.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Political observers noted a new punch in Wallace’s stump speeches during the ‘<br/>
62 campaign, and Carter was credited for the change. &quot;[Asa Carter] was this <br/>
little quiet guy who always looked like he needed a shave,&quot; remembers Alabama <br/>
journalist Wayne Greenhaw. &quot;He was a hell of a writer. I mean, he knew how to <br/>
put words together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With Wallace’s victory in 1962, Carter was charged with writing a memorable <br/>
inaugural speech and he leapt at the chance to make history. &quot;He worked on that <br/>
thing for two or three weeks,&quot; says Dan Carter, &quot;holed up in a hotel room, as <br/>
one of his friends said, chain-smoking one cigarette after another. And when <br/>
he got through, he came to see George Wallace. He handed him the speech. And <br/>
he took his finger and pointed to one line. And he said, &#39;Read it -- <br/>
segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever -- that&#39;s the line people are <br/>
gonna remember,&#39; he said.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And Wallace picked it up,&quot; says Alabama journalist Bob Ingram, &quot;and looked <br/>
at it and said, &quot;I like that line. I like it, and I’m going to use it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Carter proved valuable to Wallace’s administration and continued to draw his <br/>
paycheck during Wallace’s first term in office. &quot;Asa Carter was a most <br/>
integral part of the George Wallace organization,&quot; remembers Wallace’s former finance <br/>
director Seymore Trammell. &quot;He was a man that had connections, good <br/>
connections with the underworld, you might say. He was our go-between between the <br/>
governor and with the Ku Klux Klan. He could keep those people quiet, or either he <br/>
could get them to be very disturbed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Carter’s speechwriting services reached national audiences again when Wallace <br/>
stood in the schoolhouse door of the University of Alabama, barring two <br/>
African American students from entering. All the major networks would carry Wallace’<br/>
s symbolic stand and his statement, &quot;[I] do hereby denounce and forbid this <br/>
illegal and unwarranted action by the central government.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, as the times changed and the political climate in Alabama and the <br/>
nation softened, Carter, ever the hard-liner, became less and less enamored of <br/>
Wallace’s evolving attitude on race. He ran as a fringe candidate for governor <br/>
against Wallace in 1970 and finished at the bottom of the pack with his <br/>
racially-charged, divisive campaign.<br/>
<br/>
In a remarkable turnaround, Asa Carter remade his image in his later life, <br/>
moving to Texas and becoming a writer under the pseudonym Forrest Carter. As <br/>
Forrest Carter, he had a string of successes including &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Jose <br/>
Wales&quot; which became a Hollywood movie starring Clint Eastwood. He also penned <br/>
the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller &quot;The Education of Little Tree,&quot; a fictitious <br/>
account of his childhood as a Native American orphan. Oddly, this &quot;true story&quot; <br/>
became a favorite among the liberal-minded people he had despised throughout his <br/>
life. Carter died in 1979 before his double identity reached national <br/>
attention.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282279736">I hadn&#39;t kept up with the UNM Press discussions lately, but this is sad.   In <br/>
an article from 2001, at Salon.com:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Leading the way in the ignoring department is the University of New Mexico <br/>
Press, which is apparently not about to do anything that might kill the goose <br/>
that lays the golden eggs. Incredibly, UNM&#39;s handsome new 25th anniversary <br/>
edition (with a cover painting by the Oklahoma Cherokee artist Murv Jacob) makes <br/>
no mention of Asa Carter or the controversies that have surrounded the book <br/>
over the years -- an omission that Diane McWhorter equates to &quot;publishing a book <br/>
of Hitler&#39;s paintings without mentioning the word &#39;Nazi.&#39;&quot; The specious <br/>
&quot;biography&quot; that appeared on the book&#39;s back cover in the original UNM edition, <br/>
which moistly gushed that &quot;Forrest Carter, whose Indian name is Little Tree, was <br/>
known as &#39;Storyteller in Council&#39; to the Cherokee Nations ... His Indian <br/>
friends always shared a part of his earnings from his writing,&quot; is gone, as is the <br/>
subtitle &quot;A True Story.&quot; Only the words &quot;Young Adult Fiction&quot; in small print on <br/>
the corner of the back cover hint at the book&#39;s stormy history. The <br/>
introduction (which has remained unchanged since the first UNM edition in 1985) by <br/>
Rennard Strickland, a professor of law at the University of Oregon, blandly tells <br/>
us that Forrest Carter &quot;wrote a number of important books,&quot; and that &quot;&#39;Little <br/>
Tree&#39; speaks to the human spirit and reaches the very depth of the human <br/>
soul.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 The University of New Mexico Press declined to comment about its <br/>
nonacknowledgment of &quot;Little Tree&#39;s&quot; unseemly provenance, referring a reporter to Rennard <br/>
Strickland. Strickland said he was not consulted by the University of New <br/>
Mexico about updating his introduction and that his purpose in writing the i<br/>
ntroduction was to &quot;tell readers what they&#39;d find in this book. I wasn&#39;t doing a <br/>
history of the controversy.&quot; He added, &quot;I have given my last interview on the <br/>
subject.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
===================<br/>
<br/>
He did NOT write &quot;a number of important books&quot; and not much else is true <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Lies about where the money went, the BIG lie &quot;a true story&quot;.... it&#39;s just too <br/>
much for me.    <br/>

Well phooey!  I didn&#39;t know about all the racist stuff...<br/>
 <br/>
I had read that it was originally presented as biographical, but that the  <br/>
author himself never presented it that way, it just sort of morphed into that  <br/>
and he never denied it...maybe sort of like a snowball rolling??  Yeah, it  is <br/>
dishonest.<br/>
 <br/>
But I also read that it never came to light that it wasn&#39;t  autobiographical <br/>
until after he was dead, so he couldn&#39;t speak up for himself or  defend <br/>
anything he had done, or supposedly done.  I think it&#39;s such a  bummer because it <br/>
really is a good story.  <br/>
 <br/>
If ONLY it hadn&#39;t been presented as a true story, I could probably stomach  <br/>
the rest of the stuff.  There are plenty of authors out there who live  really <br/>
crappy lives (abandoned children and family, womanizers, etc) but I can  still <br/>
read their work.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082508823">I agree there are parallels to unschooling, but I would really be <br/>
hesitant about using it as an example to anyone else.  Yes, the way <br/>
Bonnie Bee &quot;kinned&quot; her grandson was a wonderful example of the kind of <br/>
relationship we should be striving for with our own children -- but the <br/>
source is rotten, and that taints the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
See, the author was not just a bad guy who happened to write a great <br/>
story -- he was a master at manipulating the human emotion.  He had <br/>
studied how to do that very thing, and brought it to fruition with his <br/>
slogan for the governor&#39;s campaign.<br/>
<br/>
What he did in the book was to perpetuate the myth of the &quot;noble savage&quot; <br/>
-- incidentally disrespecting many of their real traditions along the <br/>
way.  Some words he used were nonsense words, not even aboriginal <br/>
languages.  It is unclear whether he was trying an experiment to see how <br/>
far he could mess with people&#39;s thinking -- I know there are several <br/>
academics who have written that that was his motivation, but as he <br/>
cannot defend himself I will give him the benefit of a doubt.  There is <br/>
no question, however, that he didn&#39;t do enough research into the <br/>
authenticity of everything he presented as Native culture.<br/>
<br/>
There is also no doubt that he was a really messed up guy -- the drunken <br/>
bar brawl he was in was with his own son, whom he had abandoned (along <br/>
with his wife and the rest of his children) several years before in <br/>
order to reinvent himself as a folksy Native American storyteller.  <br/>
Those who knew him in his final years had never been told of his <br/>
previous life as a speechwriter and family man, and were horrified when <br/>
those facts came out after his death.  Many people felt betrayed by what <br/>
he did, including many Native Americans whom he had &quot;befriended&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt never had any children, and never claimed he did.  He did have <br/>
vast experience with other people&#39;s children, however -- that is why I <br/>
am willing to look at what he wrote about how children learn.  If he <br/>
turned out to be a twisted individual who had harmed his own family and <br/>
been an active and vicious member of the Klan; had written his books <br/>
specifically to play on the emotion of kind-hearted people; and  those <br/>
who were closest to him in his earlier years were forthright about his <br/>
manipulativeness and  skewed tendencies, I wouldn&#39;t be recommending him, <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Some of those on this list who have been the most prolific have also <br/>
made errors in their earlier lives, but they have been gracious and <br/>
humble enough to share them, and to show how they would -- and do! -- do <br/>
things differently now.  I know Sandra didn&#39;t come from the best of <br/>
circumstances, but she has made a difference in the lives of many on <br/>
this list by what she shares.  She doesn&#39;t seek to twist things to <br/>
provide beautiful examples.  She simply leads a beautiful life, and <br/>
allows us glimpses of what works -- and doesn&#39;t work -- for her and her <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
The author of the book, on the other hand, came from fairly decent <br/>
circumstances and both hinted and outright lied in order to sell a book <br/>
which actually does damage to the very people it claimed to &quot;champion&quot; <br/>
-- both by its lack of veracity about being autobiographical and by its <br/>
false and misleading content.  Just the sick feeling of being &quot;played&quot; <br/>
by anyone unfortunate enough to have fallen in love with the characters <br/>
and the concept (and I count myself among those numbers) is enough to <br/>
make those readers cautious about any similar stories, and that is a shame.<br/>
<br/>
Debi, duped and disgusted by it<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not disturbed.   I just wanted to point out that there&#39;s a LOT to learn <br/>
in the vicinity of that piece of literature, maybe more in its surroundings <br/>
than in its substance.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always worth being skeptical and critical.   Sometimes you find from <br/>
your research that your example is perfectly wonderful, or 80% wonderful, or <br/>
artistic license, or fantasy.   That&#39;s fine, just so you know.<br/>
