<br/>
Love and Logic is shorthand for a book called Parenting with Love and Logic <br/>
by Foster Cline and Jim Fay.  The book is based on the premise that our goal <br/>
is to raise responsible children into adulthood, and that we do this by <br/>
giving our children as much control over their lives as we are comfortable <br/>
with and the freedom to experience the consequences of their actions.<br/>
