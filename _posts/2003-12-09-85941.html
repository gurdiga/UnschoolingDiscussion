<div id="ygrps-yiv-839914673">Reminds me of the diaper ad -- how the Mom buys the expensive name-brand for <br/>
baby #1 and then gets real with baby #2 and realizes the cheaper brand works <br/>
just as well.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this relaxing process is natural for a lot of parents -- or maybe it&#39;s <br/>
just too tiring to be so perfect after you go past baby #1. :)<br/>

just pointing out how funny they are being right then<br/>

ease away.<br/>
