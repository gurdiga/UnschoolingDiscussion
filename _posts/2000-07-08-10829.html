<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527511546">Parenting author John Rosemond suggests that no kid should have more toys <br/>
than he or she can put away and take care of. It&#39;s unfair to expect a kid to <br/>
clean up a room covered wall-to-wall with toys, games, pieces of toys, etc. <br/>
He says the right number of toys is probably about 10. That&#39;s right, 10 <br/>
toys!<br/>
<br/>
For toddlers, he suggests a toy library concept. The child can play with one <br/>
toy at a time. When he wants another toy, he brings you what he has. You <br/>
trade it for a new one. Nothing gets left out.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree that one big factor in the clutter at our house is just.. <br/>
too much stuff. I regularly box up toys and put them in the basement. For <br/>
the most part, no one ever asks for them, and eventually the boxes get moved <br/>
to the parking lot of the local Goodwill. Another problem is books. I think <br/>
you *can* have too many books. Oour house is groaning under avalanches of <br/>
books. Taking a very critical look at our collection is my next project!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really disagree with this approach. Clutter or no, mixing toys leads to<br/>
many imaginative games. Letting children play with their toys in their own<br/>
ways *is* unschooling, no? John Rosemond is the antithesis of unschooling,<br/>
IMO. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, soon enough they&#39;ll be grown and gone and I am going to miss the<br/>
toys strewn about. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093604808">That makes sense to me.  I know my eldest is very uncomfortable <br/>
with the amount of stuff we have.  This is one big problem with <br/>
tidying up in our house, I can&#39;t threaten to take stuff away, cos <br/>
that&#39;s what she wants me to do.  But there again I like to give <br/>
them the option of getting stuff out for themselves.  Tonight we <br/>
had to tidy the living room, cos my mum was babysitting (we went <br/>
to see Chicken Run, very enjoyable &lt;g&gt;) and she&#39;s fat and can&#39;t <br/>
walk so well, so the floor had to be clear.  It got done, though dh <br/>
started on it before we&#39;d eaten tea, so the kids weren&#39;t really in <br/>
the mood for work...<br/>
<br/>
This does seem a bit &#39;anti-Montessori&#39; if the child can&#39;t access <br/>
their own stuff without coming to someone else, though it might be <br/>
an opportunity for &#39;manners-training...&#39;<br/>
