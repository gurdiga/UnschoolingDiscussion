<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659913168">You know, I keep thinking Haley&#39;s Comet, but didn&#39;t that shoot by in the<br/>
90&#39;s? Not the 80&#39;s? I&#39;m pretty sure it was the 80&#39;s because I think I<br/>
was still a kid or a teen. I&#39;ll have to research this :-)<br/>
<br/>
We used to vacation at my step moms cabin in the woods of Maine in the<br/>
summers. It was so beautiful it&#39;s beyond description. There were so many<br/>
stars and they were so bright. It was like someone dropped a box full of<br/>
pearls on a black cloth. Since I&#39;ve re-discovered astronomy I&#39;ve been<br/>
looking up at night these past few weeks. It&#39;s so depressing to see gray<br/>
skies and a handful of dim stars, night after night. Otherwise, I am<br/>
happy where we live, and we have no intention of moving. But now, it&#39;s<br/>
so sad at night. <br/>

&gt; Hi Shannon,<br/>
&gt; My name is Tamie and Im new here. I just wanted to say that I believe<br/>
&gt; the comet you are talking about is Haley&#39;s Comet. I like astronamy<br/>
&gt; also, but never pursued it. I used to work for a woman who lived on<br/>
&gt; the ocean, in Marblehead, Ma. It was beautiful. I used to just sit<br/>
&gt; out on the back porch and watch all the stars and shooting stars.<br/>
&gt; Also it was beautiful to watch all the boats lights. They seemed to<br/>
&gt; reflect off of eachother.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280040126">Ah yes! Hale-Bopp was 1996/7 and Haley was 1986! (I did a search on both<br/>
names). That makes sense. I would have been still in High School so that<br/>
fits with my memory :-) <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all! I had forgotten Hale-Bopp. <br/>

step mom sold the cabin so we don&#39;t go up there anymore :-( It was so<br/>
beautiful at that pond. I&#39;m getting homesick just thinking about it. <br/>

&gt; Good job, you must be around my age because I was still in school myself<br/>

&gt; Tamie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I don&#39;t remember my school making a fuss at all. I guess this<br/>
is an unschooling type memory :-) but my dad was really interested and<br/>
brought my sis and I up to the local reservation to see it (far less<br/>
light pollution up there). Once there we found dozens of people with<br/>
telescopes who were there for the same reason! One of them let us look<br/>
thru his and we saw the comet. It was a rather blurry, non-dramatic,<br/>
blue blur :-) But I loved it! <br/>
<br/>
I can remember many details from that night. Can&#39;t remember 1/2 the<br/>
stuff I learned in school, but I can remember what that telescope looked<br/>
like, and what the comet looked like thru it, and the people milling<br/>
around and how exciting it all was :-) <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, unschooling really is the way to go, isn&#39;t it? <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I&#39;m 30 by the way :-) In 1986 I would have been 16 (depending on<br/>
the season). <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s a nature reservation. I&#39;m not sure what the difference is<br/>
between a reservation or a preserve, but this is not a Native<br/>
reservation like you are probably thinking. It&#39;s just woods, with trails<br/>
and some beautiful views :-) All the indigenous folk were driven from<br/>
here long ago (New Jersey). I think they are in Illinois now? Can&#39;t<br/>
remember (Leni Lenape for anyone interested). <br/>
<br/>
Your font is coming up normal (?) so maybe the list can&#39;t see what<br/>
you&#39;re doing? Oh wait. I think the way fonts work is that if you do not<br/>
have that font on your computer, it resorts to your default. So whatever<br/>
font you are using, *I* at least, do now own it :-)<br/>
