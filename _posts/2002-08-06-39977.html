<br/>
Point being....(and you thought I didn&#39;t have one) is that I learned about<br/>
the crisis in great detail, not from ps, or from 6 years in a university<br/>
where I simply got the party line .but from my own interests, teaching<br/>
myself, unschooling myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851624001">AHHH.. aint it always the way.. we get such a narrow view of things from school.. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i would say the only thing i got out of my 12 years in ps.. from &#39;56 to &#39;68 was .. hmm now let me see, there&#39;s gotta be something.. uh.. I KNOW.. how to do simple algebra.. .. and uh.. i had a good art teacher once.. <br/>
<br/>
even college.. i got very little from that but a diploma.. and with a degree in psych the main thing i learned is that most research psychologists disagree with each other and can tell you why with their own studies.. hahahahha<br/>
