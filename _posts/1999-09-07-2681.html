Play is wonderful.  Play is the basis of all education. Play is the<br/>
creative<br/>
wonderland from whence the joy of learning comes. The need for joyless<br/>
work as an<br/>
adult will come on its own without anyone trying to plan in advance for<br/>
it...and<br/>
who knows maybe with the habits of self-direction and<br/>
self-determination  your<br/>
kids will avoid the joyless compromise that so many of us make.  The<br/>
idea that<br/>
something must &quot;go&quot; somewhere else  to be worth anything is imho a<br/>
mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Living in the moment, being here now, is the essence of happiness.<br/>
Something we<br/>
as adults have to strive to remember.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to disagree about something that is non-testable but I think if<br/>
your kid<br/>
was left alone he would have read all on his own.  Maybe years later<br/>
than you<br/>
would have liked but he would have.  The fear is such a pernicious<br/>
thing.  We<br/>
have most of us, been schooled til we can&#39;t think straight about many<br/>
things.<br/>
Reading is certainly one of them.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Anyway,  we finally decided to go for it.  We felt<br/>
&gt;  like if we only stuck our toe in intead of jumping in completely,  we<br/>
&gt;  wouldn&#39;t be able to convince our son that he really was in charge of<br/>
&gt;  his education and that it was his choice from now on.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know, I read this, and the rest of your response, and I think that is so<br/>
&gt; great.  But I don&#39;t understand it.  The bones of it.  Do you just get up in<br/>
&gt; the morning and say, &quot;what do you want to do today?&quot; Or do you just get up in<br/>
&gt; the morning?  All summer, I let the boys pretty much do what they wanted, I<br/>
&gt; asked them to practice their music everyday, and read 30 min. a day.  They<br/>
&gt; did that, and then played with their Dragon Ball Z action characters the rest<br/>
&gt; of the time.  Now, they don&#39;t even want to read, just play.  Do I guide by<br/>
&gt; saying, you  do music, reading and something that you choose, or what?  I<br/>
&gt; know I am dense at this, I have been reading the list, asking questions,<br/>
&gt; getting good answers, but it isn&#39;t really going well.  Given a choice, they<br/>
&gt; just want to play, and while I know that games teach some things, they have<br/>
&gt; learned what the games have to offer already, and are not moving on.  My 5th<br/>
&gt; grader is learning to enjoy reading, but only because I made him read this<br/>
&gt; summer.  I let him buy a book of his choice, on a subject he wanted, and we<br/>
&gt; went from there, also Harry Potter helped a lot!  But, If I hadn&#39;t made him,<br/>
&gt; and believe me, they have always been read to, and see me read all the time,<br/>
&gt; he still wouldn&#39;t be reading, cause that&#39;s boring.  Wait, he can read, he<br/>
&gt; just never said I am going to my room to read a book.  So,  to make a long<br/>
&gt; story even longer, I am reluctant to let go.  Guess I have the control streak<br/>
&gt; in me from my mom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry to be so long, but geesh, I am kinda frustrated here<br/>
