<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604929851">I&#39;m not sure if this list has any rules about subject headings, I really <br/>
don&#39;t care because rules are many times stupid. However, I did want to ask <br/>
nicely if those on digest can change the subject line? It&#39;s hard to filter <br/>
through what goes with what line of conversation. Because of the number of <br/>
e-mails coming through my inbox lately I&#39;ve just taken to deleting the ones <br/>
that have only a digest number in the subject line. It&#39;s my loss, I know.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, no matter what you gals choose, I normally will read them, even if <br/>
you put NO SUBJECT HERE BECAUSE I DON&#39;T FEEL LIKE IT.<br/>

LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848781753">No rules....but it would be more thoughtfull to<br/>
voluntarily give a hint about what the subject matter<br/>
is. Thanks for bringing it up.  I often delete the<br/>
Digest identified posts, too.<br/>
