I recommend signing up with an umbrella school for the reduction in stress levels!:) AEI (Alternative Education Institute) is a great one, and only $15 per year, per child...less than an eval.<br/>
If you sign up now, you simply inform the district you have terminated your Homeschool program and you&#39;re done. They&#39;ll try to pressure you to do an eval. for the year, but you don&#39;t legally have to....your kids simply won&#39;t be put in the next grade level. Whoopee.<br/>

and trust.   But deciding between these two legal ways of complying with FL&#39;s <br/>
compulsory education law involves more than just cost or the annual <br/>
evaluation. For a comparison between the options, you can check out <br/>
www.ParentDirectedEducation.org and follow the links. <br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;ve been comfortable for many years with the evaluation option as a <br/>
home educator, and my website co-owner uses the private school umbrella option <br/>
and helps others do the same. Either one can be great, depending on how it <br/>
fits your own family -- PDE doesn&#39;t recommend one over the other.   JJ<br/>

<br/>
I would think you&#39;d recommend one over the other if a family says they &quot;hate&quot; doing evaluations. That&#39;s why I recommend an umbrella school...for those that don&#39;t believe they should have to, or don&#39;t enjoy portfolio evals. I&#39;ve done both, I recommend AEI or another umbrella of choice when a family feels stressed over evaluations.<br/>
<br/>
Even with two unschool friendly evaluators available, most in my group choose the low stress of an umbrella school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415731853">We use Florida Unschoolers and it has been a real blessing for me.  I don&#39;t <br/>
feel like anyone is looking over my shoulder to see that what we are doing is <br/>
*appropriate*.  Unfortunately, Florida Unschoolers is full.  <br/>
