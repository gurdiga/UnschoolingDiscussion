<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Haleigh and I were talking in the car one day, just the two of us and she <br/>
&gt; brought him up.  She was saying something about one of the camp counselors <br/>
&gt; calling him her boyfriend and that lead into a discussion about kissing, <br/>
&gt; holding hands, sex, etc.  She started to get really uncomfortable so I <br/>
&gt; lightened the subject up with a lot of humor and she felt more relaxed so we <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; kept talking.  At one point we were discussing them sleeping alone in the <br/>
&gt; shed together and I talked to her about boys, in general, putting the moves <br/>
&gt; on girls when they aren&#39;t ready and how things can get out of hand so fast <br/>
&gt; that you don&#39;t even *want* to say no anymore.  I shared some of my past <br/>
&gt; experiences with her and regrets and mistakes I made.  We were laughing <br/>
&gt; lightly and really having a great bonding moment.  Then I pop off and say <br/>
&gt; something along the lines of &#39;hormones and penises make boys crazy&#39; and I <br/>
&gt; thought she was going to fall out of the car!  She died laughing and I made <br/>
&gt; a quick recover that there are girls out there like that too and went on to <br/>
&gt; explain.  She was totally and completely shocked that I said that.  Her face <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; was bright red and she kept saying MOOOUUUUMMMM!!!!!  It was so funny! LOL  <br/>

he was younger, took place in the car. We could chat but there didn&#39;t need to <br/>
be a lot of eye contact, which was easier on both of us. I think particularly <br/>
of a conversation about wet dreams (an old boyfriend told me once when he had <br/>
his first he was terrified. He had cool, liberal parents, but it never occurred <br/>
to them to warn him. So I wanted to be sure to talk to Juls well before).<br/>
<br/>
There was a great Malcolm in the Middle where Lois was concerned Malcolm <br/>
might be having or thinking about having sex. She sets up this long car ride, then <br/>
informs him they&#39;re going to talk about sex. She tells him she has no idea <br/>
what he&#39;s going to need to know, so she&#39;s just going to tell him everything. He <br/>
is horrified.<br/>
<br/>
She starts talking about her own experiences and feelings, and there are <br/>
scenes of her stopping the car so he can get out and throw up, then getting back <br/>
in and saying, &quot;Okay,&quot; etc.  Finally they arrive home and pull into the <br/>
driveway. They are so engaged in conversation, back and forth, that they just sit in <br/>
the car and continue to talk.<br/>
