<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982242518">&lt;I can certainly understand where this can get messy yet understand the idea<br/>
behind questioning how this follows the unschooling philosophy. She&#39;s not<br/>
getting religious or even political about it. Just inquiring.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve had no first hand experience with abortion, you can discuss it<br/>
without alot of emotion.  But for those who have had experience, it&#39;s an<br/>
extremely emotional subject and not one worth discussing on an unschooling<br/>
list.  As the bumper sticker on the back of my car says:  Abortion:  Big<br/>
People KILLING Little People<br/>

not one worth discussing on an unschooling<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490877022">I truly think this is a very very inappropriate topic for this list. I highly <br/>
doubt that this can be discussed dipassionately when even some of the ones <br/>
asking for the debate to stop are adding statements designed to inflame <br/>
others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, its not the topic that is inappropiate as much as the way folks feel <br/>
they have to &quot;defend&quot; thier opinions.  The &quot;big people killing little people&quot; <br/>
comment was def intended to flame and get the last word in.. THAT was <br/>
inappropiate ( IMO)<br/>
