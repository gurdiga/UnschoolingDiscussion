We have a managery of animals here in bergen county NJ..<br/>
and would like to add a chicken coup to the group..<br/>
the managery consists of 20 or so rabbits/5 cats/2 ducks<br/>
(more to come in the spring) 2 cocketiels/3 lizards/<br/>
1 dog/ 1 darling child not yet 3....<br/>
But the idea of chickens is interesting...actually I was<br/>
thinking of selling the eggs locally...How do they handle<br/>
the winter??What do you have them in???  I&#39;ve started reading<br/>
up on them..apparently they have coups on wheels that you roll<br/>
around the yard, which adds fertility to the ground, and keeps<br/>
the smell down...??<br/>
Any suggestions would be helpful...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448335768">Hi Eileen,<br/>
Chickens are so incredibley easy!  We have some brutal cold weather and they<br/>
live outside in an enclosed small coop that dh built.  It doesn&#39;t have to be<br/>
very big at all..that way they can snuggle up close together to keep warm!<br/>
We let ours out every morning to free range and then when it gets to be dusk<br/>
they just walk back to the coop and hop in on their own...simple.  Because<br/>
they free-range we have no problem with smell or disease...disease usually<br/>
comes from living in close quarters.  We have alot of land for them to roam<br/>
so it never gets smelly either.  The problems with this are that they will<br/>
eat any tender seedlings that you plant and some flowers...so one solution<br/>
to this is to pen them in during the spring planting season.  Or I guess you<br/>
could put fences around the garden.  Another huge problem can be predators.<br/>
We have lost a number of out chickens to predators...mostly falcons,<br/>
coyotes.  This is a terrible dilemma for us.  But, we&#39;ve resolved that we<br/>
would rather let them roam than pen them and hopefully they have a better<br/>
life though maybe shorter...I know not everyone agrees with this.  They<br/>
follow us to the compost pile and come running to be picked up and petted.<br/>
Ours also go to the coop to lay their eggs...if they run free they could<br/>
wind up laying eggs anywhere and therefore you can&#39;t eat or sell them.  We<br/>
love our chickens and to look out the window to see them running around the<br/>
yard has brought us immense pleasure, enjoyment and delight.  Good luck if<br/>
you decide to get them...they are such fun.<br/>

Loooonng time ago ) and we would have to get new chickens after a couple of<br/>
years and kill all the old ones who had stopped laying. This is a normal<br/>
part of having chickens ...to kill off the old, unproductive layers for<br/>
stewing hens. Needless-to-say, this is part of farming. And I have never<br/>
raised chickens since because I hated killing them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59395575">We are in NC, and are winters aren&#39;t too bad (although we are covered in ice<br/>
today).  The chickens have a coop they go in in bad weather.  I too let them<br/>
range in a large pasture.  We did confine them in a pasture just because they<br/>
were eating all my flowers, and digging up all the mulch.  We have lost a few<br/>
too predators, but are learning how to outsmart them little by little.  But as<br/>
already said, this is life with animals.  Really I think it is good for the<br/>
kids to learn this young.  They handle death much better than I do.<br/>
I really enjoy the chickens too.  They are very interesting and fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216367034">We are vegetarians although not vegan. We&#39;ve never been faced with having<br/>
old chickens because unfortunately predators always get them first.  Though<br/>
if they do grow old we&#39;ll keep them as pets and just always have only a few<br/>
layers...if it got to be too many ....more than 12 for us...we&#39;d just quit<br/>
getting them.  The chickens are really just pets to us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-111861687">I haven&#39;t seen this issue as of yet but I&#39;m interested in the topic.  I also<br/>
have Food for Healing and think it is a thoughtful book.  However, I haven&#39;t<br/>
been able to eat macrobiotically because it doesn&#39;t seem to fit for me.  I<br/>
agree not everyone thrives on the same kind of diet.  There is also another<br/>
book called Eat Right for Your Blood Type which talks about some of this<br/>
stuff as well.  It&#39;s such a broad and complicated topic that I have never<br/>
actually felt settled with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-515489228">My kids think the word &quot;hamburger&quot; is funny because it isn&#39;t a ham is it?<br/>
They keep wanting to know why it is called a &quot;Ham&quot;burger and not a cowburger<br/>
perhaps you have stumbled on part of the reason! I know we do get turned off<br/>
too when we think about it. We go in and out of being veggie except my dh<br/>
who is strict except for salmon only I like cooking and get bored of just<br/>
veg meals all the time. I am anemic and find the hamburger calls my name now<br/>
and then. I guess if I eat the free range ones I still feel bad and also<br/>
grateful that such a beautiful animal gave it&#39;s life for my craving.<br/>
I would ideally just eat fresh salmon or sea food a few times a week if I<br/>
had the will power to completely stay away. Organic free range chicken eggs<br/>
are the best!<br/>
How nice to be able to have them all the time and for free.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055784674">Thanks Lisa...I will look for that issue of UTNE.<br/>
Yes...I do think that some people need meat. My husband is one of them and<br/>
my children are meat-eaters too. That doesn&#39;t bother me. <br/>
<br/>
But I cannot digest meat very well and have had soem health-related<br/>
problems due to meat. Since becoming vegetarian a few years back I have<br/>
been feeling much better.<br/>
