<div id="ygrps-yiv-701052234">I have a love/hate relationship with the particular list.  On the one <br/>
hand, I love the posts from other unschoolers, the insight and, <br/>
often, spins on subjects that I&#39;ve never heard before.  On the other <br/>
hand, I hate it because many of the posts are &quot;right back attcha&quot; <br/>
posts and have people presenting opinions as fact or quoting experts <br/>
as having the facts.  I think that most of us believe that <br/>
the &quot;facts&quot; are relative and that this isn&#39;t &quot;know-it-all-dotcom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
After reading the exchange (or most of it) between Sandra and Lynda, <br/>
and knowing the feeling of having Sandra present herself as the owner <br/>
of the &quot;know-it-all-dotcom&quot; list, I picked up the book I&#39;m <br/>
revisiting, &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;, by John Holt.<br/>
<br/>
In his explanation of the fine line parents walk between answering <br/>
your child&#39;s questions and expanding their knowledge with new <br/>
information, I think I came across the answer to what&#39;s happening out <br/>
here with us adults:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The line if hard to find, harder yet to describe.  I like my friends <br/>
to tell me things that they are interested in and that I don&#39;t know - <br/>
it is part of any good conversation.  Yet I don&#39;t like being around <br/>
people who act and talk as if their mission in life were to educate <br/>
me, whose relation to me is always that of a teacher to pupil.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This quote seemed worthy of posting and maybe we have to use the same <br/>
philosophy we use to allow our children to &quot;unschool&quot; and self-learn <br/>
with the other adults out here.  None of us are here as &quot;teachers&quot; <br/>
trying to &quot;educate&quot; everyone else.  I believe when that starts <br/>
happening, that&#39;s when people become highly offended by others&#39; posts.<br/>
<br/>
Just some fuel for thought....<br/>

their opinion about who is doing what, etc. but for me, and my relevance to <br/>

me what the truth is. . . sorry, but I can find my own truth and it may or <br/>
may not match up with others. That being said, I find it also enlightening to <br/>
be able to discuss issues and things with others and maybe see something I <br/>
had not been able to see before. . .come to some understanding. But when it <br/>
is presented the way Lynda has, as being &quot;the way&quot; or &quot;the truth&quot;, then <br/>

post and read others post, and hopefully learn a little something about <br/>
myself, which is all I can do.<br/>

<p><small><time>23 May 2001, at  8:05pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-441601695">For the most part, I have enjoyed this list.  I have personally benefited<br/>
from the exchange of ideas and have a new respect for differing views.<br/>
<br/>
I recently read something that made me think of some of the things going on<br/>
here on the list recently, and I want to share it.  This quote has helped<br/>
me, maybe it will help someone else.  Here&#39;s my two cents worth to this<br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Taken from Joe Alexander&#39;s book Blatant Raw Foodist Propaganda! (yes, I&#39;m<br/>
the one who often comments about the health delights of raw food):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mental prejudice is one such internal restraint.  The mind likes to run in<br/>
the groove it is accustomed to; in the ruts it has worn deep.  To be free<br/>
sometimes requires an effort to pull the mind out of its habitual rut and<br/>
set it to exploring new territory.  The most common form of mental bondage<br/>
is the confusion of information with knowledge.  Your knowledge is what you<br/>
know is true from your own experience.  Information is hearsay that you have<br/>
picked up and don&#39;t know if it is true or not.  The fool will say, &#39; If you<br/>
don&#39;t accept Jesus you&#39;ll go to hell forever.&#39;  The wise person might say,<br/>
&#39;I know a preacher who says that if you don&#39;t accept Jesus you&#39;ll go to hell<br/>
forever.&#39;  A fool will say, &#39;I know that light travels 186,000 miles a<br/>
second.&#39; A wise person might say, &#39;My high school science book says that<br/>
light travels 186,000 miles per second.&#39;  A free person will not confuse his<br/>
information with his knowledge.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the Biblical reference which may offend some Bible-believing<br/>
individuals - this is the author&#39;s statement, not mine.  You or I might word<br/>
it differently or choose a different example.<br/>
<br/>
Further, sometimes it is helpful to me in staying emotionally detached when<br/>
I view a person&#39;s statements on the list as &quot;I know a person who<br/>
thinks/states/believes  that . . .&quot;  Sometimes, I&#39;m even able to sit back<br/>
and enjoy the back and forth of others without jumping in even though I do<br/>
have a specific, even strong, opinion on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
So, let&#39;s keep up the dialogue, it really helps to see both or two or three<br/>
sides of things sometimes.  Even the hardened mind [mine ;-)] sometimes<br/>
later changes, and the seed was planted long ago by someone with whom I once<br/>
vehemently disagreed to the point of making a fool of myself.<br/>
