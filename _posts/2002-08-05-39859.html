<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325802477">Hey y&#39;all,<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen the new homeschooling magazine, Life Learning?  It&#39;s edited by<br/>
perhaps the best homeschool editor in the land, and she&#39;s from Canada --<br/>
Wendy Priesnitz. The regulars who will be writing for it include John Gatto.<br/>
<br/>
go to lifelearningmagazine.com<br/>
<br/>
The Jul/Aug issue has a passage I like particularly:<br/>
Quote: When people can interact with art on their own terms, they learn to<br/>
trust -- and enjoy -- their own perceptions of art. They also learn to trust<br/>
and depend on themselves for their own education.  endquote.<br/>
<br/>
