<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139111434">Hi guys<br/>
Been lurking on the list for a couple of months now but haven&#39;t <br/>
posted since my &#39;stop scaring the newbie&#39; post which caused such a <br/>
riot. I apologize for that.  I was sick at the time (recurring <br/>
illness!) and I get a touch sensitive about &#39;perceived&#39; character <br/>
slurs. Because of my illness I also think that life is too short to <br/>
hold on to grievances and to take things so seriously. :)<br/>
Questions:<br/>
What is the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things talked about like; allowing the child to decide <br/>
what he/she watches on TV and for how long, what to eat and when, <br/>
when to go to bed, whether to brush teeth etc are, I thought, <br/>
parenting choices.  Even children who go to school have these issues. <br/>
So if these are part of unschooling how do they learn self-<br/>
discipline, self-control and good life habits? Do you just use <br/>
natural consequences for everything?<br/>
<br/>
How does religion work with unschooling?  Do people who are devout <br/>
believers &#39;teach&#39; their children their &#39;beliefs&#39;?  If a child asks <br/>
about God do they get the parents &#39;beliefs&#39; as truth?  Same for non-<br/>
believers too?  Or do you say &quot;this is what I believe and some people <br/>
believe such and such, and in your life the choice is yours what you <br/>
choose to believe&quot; or something like that?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering about stuff<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends who you ask! :-)<br/>
<br/>
But maybe a short answer is unschooling is not doing school and radical<br/>
unschooling encompasses all areas of life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some of the things talked about like; allowing the child to decide<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They are. But for some people who question the need to teach their children<br/>
math it&#39;s a natural extension to question the need to teach their children<br/>
anything else. If living life is enough for history, then why should<br/>
figuring out teeth brushing be any different?<br/>
<br/>
The people who try not limiting TV or food or bedtimes find that kids do<br/>
self regulate after a few weeks or months. (They *will* glut for a while<br/>
because they want whatever it was that was previously forbidden and<br/>
unconsciously assume the controls will reappear so they need to take as much<br/>
advantage of the freedom as possible.)<br/>
<br/>
The kids *won&#39;t* make the same choices we would. But they won&#39;t do nothing<br/>
but whatever we fear they will.<br/>
<br/>
(It&#39;s *much* easier to discuss this around real problems rather than<br/>
generalizations and what-if scenarios. Generalizations tend to gloss over<br/>
realities and what-ifs tend to get what-if&#39;d to death.)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that&#39;s tough to get across in discussions like this is our own<br/>
wants and needs. What we need to relearn are what are our real boundaries<br/>
and what are the controls we&#39;re trying to impose on others just to make our<br/>
lives easier. One way of helping us see the difference is by asking how we&#39;d<br/>
treat a friend in the same situation. We might be upset if our kids had been<br/>
watching TV for 6 hours straight but we&#39;d generally give the benefit of the<br/>
doubt to the friend that they were doing what they wanted to do and we<br/>
should go find a life for ourselves and not bother them ;-) (But since as<br/>
unschooling parents we&#39;re responsible for our children&#39;s environment, if<br/>
they&#39;re watching that much TV everyday then we should make sure they have<br/>
other options that are equally enticing and not just choosing TV because<br/>
it&#39;s the best option available.) But if our kids wouldn&#39;t give up the TV so<br/>
we could watch the one program we liked then that&#39;s an issue of respect for<br/>
other people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So if these are part of unschooling how do they learn self-<br/>
&gt; discipline, self-control and good life habits? Do you just use<br/>
&gt; natural consequences for everything?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Modeling. Talking to them about why we make the decisions we do (rather than<br/>
why they should make the decision). Talking to them about how something make<br/>
us feel. Letting them try things out. Helping them by making some things<br/>
less odious. Making sure there are other options besides what they&#39;re<br/>
choosing. Realizing that as competent as they may seem, that perhaps they<br/>
really aren&#39;t as ready as we assume they are. (Like with the blueberries!<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
If a practice is good, then do we need to train kids to do them or will they<br/>
do them because they make sense? (Though not necessarily right away or on<br/>
*our* time schedule!)<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I&#39;ve always brushed my teeth with my daughter. I remember<br/>
brushing teeth as a child to be a long lonely tedious process so by doing it<br/>
with her, I remove that one objection. It was also difficult because it<br/>
wasn&#39;t automatic so a child is conscious of doing it. By doing it together<br/>
my daughter gets a social time which takes her mind off the tediousness of<br/>
it. She&#39;s rarely chosen not to brush partly because she&#39;d give up that<br/>
social time. And skipping once or twice or even a whole week isn&#39;t going to<br/>
give her cavities. It&#39;s habitually not brushing that will cause cavities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or do you say &quot;this is what I believe and some people<br/>
&gt; believe such and such, and in your life the choice is yours what you<br/>
&gt; choose to believe&quot; or something like that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do. But others don&#39;t. For some people unschooling stops with academics.<br/>
For others it goes beyond that.<br/>
<br/>
Doing what unschoolers do and not doing what unschoolers don&#39;t do is<br/>
probably how many people begin unschooling. But it won&#39;t get someone very<br/>
far because from a school mindset or conventional parenting mindset<br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense! It just flies in the face of<br/>
conventional wisdom. So a helpful next step is to question our assumptions<br/>
about how things need to be so we can *understand* unschooling and how human<br/>
being work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-516186510"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Questions:<br/>
&gt; What is the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know I&#39;ve been on some lists that call themselves unschooling lists <br/>
but they&#39;re more about relaxed homeschooling or ecclectic schooling.  <br/>
They think that not using a bought curriculum means unschooling, even <br/>
if they&#39;re printing worksheets off from the internet to make their <br/>
kids to fill out.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some of the things talked about like; allowing the child to decide <br/>

&gt; discipline, self-control and good life habits? Do you just use <br/>
&gt; natural consequences for everything?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids who have to go to school can&#39;t stay up until 3 am and sleep <br/>
until noon. <br/>
<br/>
I think what happens is that once you&#39;re unschooling long enough you <br/>
stop differentiating between &quot;school&quot; or &quot;education&quot; and the rest of <br/>
life.  Allowing a child to learn what he wants leads naturally into <br/>
allowing a child to eat what he wants.  <br/>
<br/>
The best way to learn good habits is to have a parent leading by good <br/>
example.  That is a real challenge for parents!  Really, it&#39;s easy <br/>
for me to yell at my kids and not let them get up from the table <br/>
until they finish their veggies while I&#39;m standing there drinking a <br/>
coke and eating a cupcake.  It&#39;s much, much harder on my part to <br/>
model good eating habits by not having the coke and the cupcake and <br/>
sitting down to eat a big plate of brocolli.  <br/>
<br/>
I think some of what people call self control and self discipline is <br/>
just adherance to tradition.  Like telling kids that they have to get <br/>
up and make their beds.  What is really the purpose of making beds?  <br/>
They just get messed up again at bedtime.  And if you don&#39;t have to <br/>
go anywhere the next day, why bother going to bed before midnight?  I <br/>
do insist that my kids brush their teeth at night.  I&#39;m not there <br/>
yet! lol <br/>
<br/>
My kids still have boundaries, and those boundaries are that in our <br/>
family we do not hurt each other.  For example, if someone is on the <br/>
phone, it is rude to make so much noise that the person on the phone <br/>
can&#39;t hear.  It is unacceptable to knock over a tower of blocks that <br/>
someone is building, or to write on someone else&#39;s picture that <br/>
they&#39;re drawing.  That is self control.  Learning that just because <br/>
you&#39;re mad doesn&#39;t give you permission to rip up someone else&#39;s <br/>
paper.  And really, having personal boundaries is a healthy way to <br/>
live your life, even if you&#39;re not parenting.  You should respect <br/>
yourself enough that you don&#39;t allow people to destroy your property <br/>
or rudely interrupt your personal phone calls.  If you don&#39;t allow <br/>
other people to treat you like that, you shouldn&#39;t allow your <br/>
children to treat you like that either.  If you tell your <br/>
child, &quot;Don&#39;t color on that paper because it&#39;s real important to <br/>
mommy&quot;, pretty soon, your kids will be telling each other, &quot;Hey, <br/>
that&#39;s my project, you may not destroy that&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How does religion work with unschooling?  Do people who are devout <br/>

&gt; about God do they get the parents &#39;beliefs&#39; as truth?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a firm believer in Jesus Christ and I do definitely teach my <br/>
beliefs as truth to my children.  I don&#39;t use a Bible curriculum to <br/>
do this though.  (I have struggled with that issue and it was the <br/>
last thing to remove before I could completely unschool!)  It didn&#39;t <br/>
make sense really, because I was willing to allow the Holy Spirit to <br/>
control every area of my children&#39;s education except for the area of <br/>
Bible study!!!  Many on this list would disagree with me on teaching <br/>
Biblical values as absolute, but to use the burning building analogy, <br/>
there is only one way out and since I believe I know the one way out <br/>
of the building, I&#39;m going to tell that truth to my children.  Of <br/>
course I can&#39;t transfer my faith to my children--they have to choose <br/>
for themselves whether or not they will reject or accept Christ.  I <br/>
would be brokenhearted if they rejected, though.  <br/>

This answer really sums it up for me.  I try to not use the <br/>
word &#39;unschool&#39; at all because it&#39;s all about life for me.  I do have <br/>
my own personal limits and boundaries which I am consistent with and <br/>
the kids know where they stand.  By loving and respecting myself my <br/>

In regards to religion I&#39;m like you (their choice what they believe)<br/>

I struggled with letting unschooling encompass all areas of my life <br/>
up until a few weeks ago.  Then I just let go and jumped, and as the <br/>
saying goes &#39;I flew&#39;.  (I&#39;ve always had a tendency to jump into <br/>
