<div id="ygrps-yiv-739331587">Cute dialogs.  None of them represent what I see here though.  Here&#39;s how<br/>
I find the conversation here:<br/>
<br/>
a.  My child has Thingymabob Disorder.  Has anyone got any ideas for how<br/>
to handle it?<br/>
b.  Have you tried oingo-boigo therapy?We used Oingo and it helped for<br/>
Thingymabob Disorder.<br/>
c.  It must be because of stress in your house. <br/>
d.  Oingo didn&#39;t work for me so we went to the Dr. Watson Technique, that<br/>
helped us.<br/>
c.  No one here has any problems with Thingymabob Disorder so it must be<br/>
because you don&#39;t do what I do.<br/>
e.  c. must be right, I listen to her all the time and I don&#39;t have<br/>
Thingymabob Disorder,<br/>
a.  Well, I&#39;ve always done most of the things c. says, but in this case<br/>
circumstances don&#39;t allow it.  The Thingymabob Disorder needs to be<br/>
addressed. <br/>
c.  Those who do what I do aren&#39;t having any problems but those who don&#39;t<br/>
have all these difficulties. They should just listen to me.<br/>
a.  Thank you b. and d.  I tried both of your suggestions and found them<br/>
very helpful.  One other thing I found elsewhere was the Franken Furter<br/>
Treatment.  That was helpful too.  <br/>
c.  But you still haven&#39;t tried my way.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Have you seen the news of Aghanistan?<br/>
&gt; A bird is in the yard!<br/>
&gt; Yes, the sun just came out.<br/>
&gt; My son hates to read.<br/>
&gt; We love our new church.<br/>
&gt; When I was little we lived near a church.<br/>
&gt; The bird is splashing in the water.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No disagreements.<br/>
&gt; Also no information, and no learning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I think there are people who would love for online discussions <br/>
&gt; to all be <br/>
&gt; this way:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I keep my child from wearing red because it disturbs me and I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; sure it <br/>
&gt; would eventually disturb him, and if I let him wear red, I know he <br/>
&gt; would wear <br/>
&gt; nothing but red every day for the rest of his life.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You&#39;re such a good mom!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Nobody knows your son like you do.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll stop letting my son wear red too.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;What about daughters?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;How old was he when you realized wearing red was the source of all <br/>
&gt; his <br/>
&gt; learning problems?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;What about pink?  Maroon?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Your son is so lucky to have you as a mom!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I wish I had kept my son from wearing red.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Red is the color of Satan, so you&#39;re intuitively a good mom and <br/>
&gt; your child <br/>
&gt; will live forever.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Red sets up a vibration of agitation, but there is an aromatherapy <br/>
&gt; antidote.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Oh, thank you!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m so glad I came here to discuss this!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Yes, I love these deep, heartfelt discussions.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>
     In three words I can sum up everything I&#39;ve learned about life: it<br/>
goes on.<br/>
