<div id="ygrps-yiv-371168316">The bulk of the private e-mail I&#39;ve been extracting topic-parts from,  <br/>
quoted between the two lines<br/>
<br/>
�������������������������<br/>
<br/>
My daughter ( 12 and never been to school ) still asks me what is<br/>
happening today instead of making her day happen .When I suggest an<br/>
activity she likes the idea... but is not the one to think of it<br/>
first... like call a friend over or go out to play tennis. She is<br/>
used to having choices offered to her instead of knowing that she has<br/>
ALL the choices available. That, I&#39;m sure, is my fault as the one who<br/>
has always been the leader of the pack. Wanna go for a bike ride? &quot;<br/>
sure &quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I know she loves to go to the pool club but she does not ask but<br/>
rather says OK when I ask her if she would like to call a friend and<br/>
head over to the pool.<br/>
Or when I say, wanna play tennis.... she says OK. ...Not usually<br/>
thinking of it for herself. If I say nothing- she DOES use the<br/>
computer to play Runescape but I know she loves hunting for mushrooms<br/>
and bike riding and swimming and hanging out at the river. It<br/>
appears that she is waiting for those activities to happen...<br/>
not making them happen.<br/>
<br/>
So... MY thoughts revert to .. Well, I guess she really doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to do these things that badly or she would have asked.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to help her to feel empowered.. Have I totally<br/>
messed her up? Can this be remedied? Can this be un- done?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ALL the choices available. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that it is necessarily an issue with control.  My 13 yo <br/>
dd, who can decide for herself what to do, doesn&#39;t sometimes.  The <br/>
fact is, I do plan stuff for my kids.  I ask them first if it is <br/>
something they are interested in, then I make a plan.  I call the <br/>
friends for them.  If I left it up to my 13 yo dd, she wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
it.  It would feel overwhelming to her.  For now, she wants me to do <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she requests things to do, and I implement them.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
it depends on the child and age, but some kids are happy to let <br/>
others do it for them and go along with the plan if it sounds fun.  I <br/>
know what my kids like and plan accordingly.  I feel that this is a <br/>
huge part of my job as an unschooling parent, to make plans and <br/>
provide interesting activities for my kids without them instigating <br/>
it always.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think kids know all the options, I know I don&#39;t, and I&#39;m an <br/>
adult!  I really think kids will naturally take over their own lives <br/>
bit by bit as they get older.  You&#39;ll see it happening.  Until then, <br/>
just do it for them.  Offer things up without expectations.</div>

Luckily, he&#39;s not growing up in the back of your head.  He&#39;s growing  <br/>
up within his own mind and body.  Don&#39;t mess up his potential with  <br/>
workbooks.<br/>

My eight year old son, who has not touched a workbook since the <br/>
first week he came to live with me was hanging out yesterday. Dh had <br/>
emptied his pockets and DS says, &quot; Dad has six dollars and fifty <br/>
cents.&quot; I reply,&quot;Really?&quot; He says, &quot;Yep, he has 26 quarters.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That came from him buying stuff at a real store, with real money. It <br/>
came from asking what he wanted to know and figuring it out.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning happens;]<br/>
<br/>
All is well.<br/>

What I actually was when we started was terrified. But it was pointed <br/>
out to me (and this is important) that Formal Schooling Does Not <br/>
Guarantee Education or Happiness. If you keep pushing schoolish <br/>
stuff, you run a huge risk of having a kid who thinks learning is a <br/>
chore. It&#39;s not! It&#39;s a joy! It&#39;s an adventure! It&#39;s fun!<br/>
<br/>
Some things to consider:<br/>
* Unschooling mom and engineer Mary Lewis, who is now a math tutor <br/>
for math-phobic adults who are returning to school, said (roughly) <br/>
that all the math kids have shoved down their throats (okay, that <br/>
part is my words) in school can be learned in 3 to 5 months when the <br/>
learner is ready and motivated. That&#39;s more than 6 YEARS of <br/>
instruction that is simply not necessary. Oy!<br/>
<br/>
* A whole lot of people come out of school unable to read, write, do <br/>
math, think for themselves, be happy.<br/>
<br/>
* If you check out the typical school curriculum, especially for kids <br/>
as young as yours, you will not be impressed. Most of this stuff kids <br/>
could not avoid learning. They live on the planet, after all! <br/>

Let your kids prepare and experience and have what they *do* want <br/>
instead!<br/>

When you have company over and you ask them if they&#39;d like something  <br/>

Nobody has ALL choices available.  I&#39;d like to have lunch in York, if  <br/>
so, and be back by 3:00.<br/>

Pam Sorooshian wrote something really good about creating an  <br/>
unschooling environment.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids aren&#39;t like lab rats we observe and record notes on.   <br/>
They&#39;re people we live with in a stimulating environment.  The mom  <br/>
needs to make sure there&#39;s a stimulating environment, with options  <br/>
and new stuff.<br/>
<br/>
-=If I say nothing- she DOES use the<br/>
computer to play Runescape but I know she loves hunting for mushrooms<br/>
and bike riding and swimming and hanging out at the river. It<br/>
appears that she is waiting for those activities to happen...<br/>
not making them happen.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
She loves Runescape too, I guess.  Do you think hanging out at the  <br/>
river is inherently better than sitting in air-conditioned bug-free  <br/>
shade playing Runescape?  It&#39;s summer.  Rivers can be kind of horrible.<br/>
<br/>
Do you, the mom, love hunting for mushrooms and swimming?<br/>
I&#39;m only asking because some parents have a checklist of things they  <br/>
think their kids should be doing, because kids should do those  <br/>
things, but they&#39;re not things the mom would voluntarily do herself.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Well, I guess she really doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to do these things that badly or she would have asked.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe something she would love to do hasn&#39;t even been suggested yet.   <br/>
Maybe she would love to learn to change a tire.  Maybe she would love  <br/>
to go on an overnight trip with you to a museum 300 miles away, stay  <br/>
in a motel, eat something she&#39;s never had before.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m not sure how to help her to feel empowered.. -=-<br/>
<br/>
How long have you been unschooling?  If only a short time, her  <br/>
empowerment might be being expressed by &quot;doing nothing.&quot;  When  <br/>
nothing has been a sin, and the religion changes, &quot;nothing&quot; becomes  <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Have I totally messed her up?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, but not permanently.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Can this be remedied? Can this be un- done?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but the work and the change are in you, much more than in her.<br/>
