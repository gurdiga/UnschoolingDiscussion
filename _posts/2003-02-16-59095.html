&lt;&lt;  My husband has the exact same sleeping <br/>
schedule.  In bed between 9 and 10, and up at 5 for work.  I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed that when the kids are playing by themselves and I&#39;m doing my <br/>
own thing, they&#39;re much more likely to be loud and wake up dh.  When <br/>
I&#39;m actively playing with them, they are much more likely to be quiet <br/>
enough. My presence tends to keep things more quiet and them less <br/>
likely to fight loudly with each other.     &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My pattern is years&#39; long, but I often stay up until Holly&#39;s asleep, and when <br/>
the boys were younger I stayed up with them too.  Now that they&#39;re teens, <br/>
they can stay up on their own.  But the deal has always been &quot;You can stay up <br/>
if you can be quiet.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not even a rule, because it&#39;s just courtesy.<br/>
It IS a condition of the privilege of choosing one&#39;s bedtime here, though, <br/>
that they need to be quiet.  And then in the morning those who get up <br/>
reciprocate by being quiet until noon.  <br/>
<br/>
When kids are used to rules, it&#39;s hard for parents to believe that kids will <br/>
be courteous on their own.  But my kids wouldn&#39;t dream of trying to justify <br/>
having made enough noise to disturb someone&#39;s sleep.  We&#39;re sweet to them and <br/>
they&#39;re sweet to us.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a family could just declare that and have it happen one day.  <br/>
It was gradual.  But it&#39;s valuable and working wonderfully here.  Lots of <br/>
their learning has always happened near bedtime, and even tonight, with Holly <br/>
being the only one here, the half hour before she went to bed was really <br/>
busy, mentally, and she and I reviewed the day and some ideas, and I told her <br/>
I wished she could be a baby once in a while, maybe once a week, long enough <br/>
for me to carry her around and rock her to sleep.  And she smiled and hugged <br/>
me, and told me some stories about people saying she was tall this week, and <br/>
feeling big.  She put in a Land Before Time video we went and rented this <br/>
evening (saw another homeschooling mom at the video store, too), and went to <br/>
bed peaceful and happy, when she wanted to, and where she wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
We had other kids spend the night Friday.  They said they usually have to go <br/>
to bed at 9:00, sometimes 8:00.  Holly told them it was sometimes still LIGHT <br/>
at 8:00, and they just shrugged.  She talked to me about that some more <br/>
today, about how very early that is, and how it&#39;s purely for the parents&#39; <br/>
benefit and not for the kids.   <br/>
<br/>
When they were here, they and Holly all went to bed around midnight, very <br/>
happily.  Two got up about 8:30, and the other two at 10:30.  All smiling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452788466">We don&#39;t have set bedtimes here either, but once Dad (the one who has to <br/>
head off to an office) hits the sack, it&#39;s &#39;quiet&#39; time.  They do pretty <br/>
well being quiet, but every now and then one of us will need to pop in and <br/>
do a quick quiet-request.  Once dh had to remind *me* to be quiet... how <br/>
embarrassing.<br/>
<br/>
We dropped the bedtimes a few years ago (more or less) and I&#39;ve found it&#39;s <br/>
lovely.  The kids go to bed when they&#39;re tired and they&#39;re more pleasant to <br/>
be around as they&#39;re not busy thinking up reasons for why they should be <br/>
able to stay up longer, or wondering when &quot;The Law&quot; is going to slam down <br/>
and send them off to bed. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Last night, after 11:30 or so, my 13 year old son and I worked on a 1500 <br/>
piece puzzle, looked up Boticelli in one of my old college books and <br/>
online, learned about Zephyrs, the three muses, the  nymph Cloris, Flora <br/>
(goddess of fecundity!), Venus (of course) and Mercury who was using his <br/>
caducea to stir the heavens, which sent ds to the dictionary to find out <br/>
what that word meant, only it wasn&#39;t in there, but similar words were, so <br/>
he figured out what the word meant and how other similar words could be <br/>
used to define a word we don&#39;t know, etc.  ...then he sought out Mercury in <br/>
the dictionary and told me all about him too  ...then my son, who has never <br/>
much enjoyed reading, read to me from &#39;The Worlds Shortest Short Stories&#39; <br/>
(or similar.)  I finally drifted off to bed while he puttered around.  Lovely.<br/>

This made me cry.<br/>
<br/>
I tell Dylan the same thing and he says &quot;Mom I&#39;d stay small longer if I<br/>
could.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This year was the first I couldn&#39;t pick him up anymore.  He grew too much<br/>
for me and while he still climbs on me while we sit in the rocking chair<br/>
he dangles off in all directions.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
