<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129330121">Is there a support group in your area?  The Pennsylvania Home Education <br/>
Network might be a good place to start.  I don&#39;t belong to one of their <br/>
groups, but I did contact them about homeschooling laws when I started and <br/>
they were very informative.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332927506">Thanks Cindy, I do have all the laws now and know all that I need to know (I<br/>
think).  It was a long time ago that I was that naive.  The problem is that<br/>
there are many who are still that naive.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to many people who use a regimented approach to homeschooling.<br/>
Also many people don&#39;t know they don&#39;t need to use a curriculum and spend<br/>
hundreds a year on one.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I like email groups like this one, they help to spread the word.<br/>
