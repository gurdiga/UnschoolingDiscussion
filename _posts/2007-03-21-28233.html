any of you have ideas on making math interesting (?) enough to him?  He <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888400864">I would think that helping him with the real life skills that he will need<br/>
would be your best bet.  Does he have money that he is able to save and<br/>
spend?  Can you get him his own checking account/atm card now and help him<br/>
learn to use quicken and balance his check book?  <br/>

<br/>
I personally enjoy the Gnarly Math newsletter which is mostly reading, even <br/>
if a lot of the math is beyond me.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gnarlymath.com/gnarnews.html">http://www.gnarlymath.com/gnarnews.html</a><br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; He<br/>

&gt; shopping or out to eat with friends and not know enough to pay or make<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like he is not been out in the world at all, but I&#39;m guessing <br/>
that this isn&#39;t what you meant. I&#39;m guessing you meant out in the world <br/>
without you. I would think going to places with you where money is real and <br/>
used would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
If he can&#39;t get his head around math yet, perhaps there are strategies and <br/>
tools that he can use to help him function well and enable him to do the <br/>
things he enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who in his late thirties finally realised that he just <br/>
couldn&#39;t take care of his money properly, including managing to balance his <br/>
check book. He admitted it to himself and, painful as it was, found someone <br/>
to do that for him. He quite literally pays an accountant he trusts to do <br/>
all of his day-to-day financial management. He has his pay direct deposited, <br/>
his bills forwarded to the accountant&#39;s office, and uses credit cards to pay <br/>
for his daily expenses like gas for his car. In a way he has given over his <br/>
power, but it works for him and he told me he feels much better and more <br/>
secure than when he lived in confusion and fear about his money. I think he <br/>
has a budget for daily cash expenses. One tool that could help with that is <br/>
a refillable gift card that works like cash.<br/>
<br/>
There are wallet cards that you can buy that are tip calculators. Instead of <br/>
having to work out what the tip should be in a restaurant, you just check <br/>
the card. If he had one of those, his friends would probably ask where he <br/>
got it.<br/>
<br/>
You never have to make change at the store if you use a debit card.<br/>
<br/>
One thing can be to choose one&#39;s friends wisely - for their tolerance and <br/>
kindness. It would sure be nice to be able to say, &quot;Don&#39;t make me do the <br/>
math, just tell me what my share is&quot; and not worry about getting ripped off.<br/>

  Great ideas and a pocket calculator is everyone&#39;s friend.<br/>
  I always have one with me and it has come in handy quite a few times.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have an 18 yo who can spout off the ages of famous (and some not so<br/>
famous) musicians and actors based on knowing their birth years and doing<br/>
&quot;the math&quot; in his head quickly with the current date, but he does not<br/>
understand money, any written math calculations, or basic written math. He<br/>
too has had many medical problems and intrusive interventions.<br/>
<br/>
For him, real life has been his best teacher. He has helped me pump gas and<br/>
we worked together to figure out the cost and gallon relationship, we have<br/>
paid for things together and then looked closely at the change together to<br/>
see if it was correct, we have measured things when needed, etc. Anything on<br/>
paper or on the computer don&#39;t seem to register. Forget word problems...his<br/>
brain just doesn&#39;t connect the story with any kind of calculations. If you<br/>
really want to know how long it will take the train traveling 70 miles per<br/>
hour with five 10 minute stops to get to Chicago, look at your ticket!<br/>
(that&#39;s what I imagine his answer would be to that question :o)<br/>
<br/>
For us, unschooling has allowed MY mind to be open to what really makes<br/>
sense for my son...school can really get in the way of that!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I felt a need to clarify that my ds&#39;s non-connectedness to math has nothing<br/>
to do with unschooling and lack of &quot;teaching&quot; math. He doesn&#39;t get<br/>
formalized math because he doesn&#39;t get formalized math. And it doesn&#39;t<br/>
really matter. It is a very small piece of life...he hasn&#39;t needed it at all<br/>
to live a full life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811465850">Thanks for all of the great ideas for my son.  Yes, he goes out with us <br/>
but gets so confused about paying for things that he doesn&#39;t want to do <br/>
it.  He will pay and get change, but doesn&#39;t know if it is right or <br/>
not.  I will try some of the ideas you have given.  He does know how to <br/>
use a calculator, so that may help to have a pocket size for him.  <br/>
Again, great ideas...<br/>
