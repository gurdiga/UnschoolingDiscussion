<div id="ygrps-yiv-645604306"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think it&#39;s &quot;evaluation,&quot; not &quot;testing.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not in Pennsylvania, but unschoolers there use an option involving <br/>
&gt; portfolios and a visit by an evaluating teacher.  And they know which <br/>
&gt; people <br/>
&gt; understand and approve of unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
  Each year your portfolio needs to be evaluated.  In grades 3, 5 and 8 your <br/>
portfolio must also include results of nationally normed standardized <br/>
achievement tests in reading/language arts and mathematics or the results of <br/>
Statewide tests administered in these grade levels.  (The second half of that <br/>
sentence was plagiarized directly from the PA law.)<br/>
  Since the law doesn&#39;t require you to state which grade your child is in, <br/>
some children are never in grade 3, 5 or 8.  (wink, wink, nudge, nudge)<br/>
  Here is a page with links for evaluators and testing.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/regional/PennsylvaniaLegal.htm#Evaluat">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/regional/PennsylvaniaLegal.htm#Evaluat</a><br/>
<br/>
ions<br/>
  Some evaluators are unschool friendly, some are not.  Find out in advance.  <br/>
PA-Unschoolers is an eclectic list, as someone already mentioned, but with <br/>
some very good PA-specific information.<br/>
  Join the list, ask questions.  Find someone who homeschools in your school <br/>
district.  They (school districts) all tend to interpret the law differently. <br/>
 YOU have to know the law, and what you need to do to comply, and how far <br/>
you&#39;re willing to push it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816714081">Wow I feel luck to be living in WA.  We can either do annual testing or an <br/>
evaluation by a teacher of our choice.  I plan on choosing one that <br/>
understands the unschooling concept.<br/>

You  might want to go to yahoogroups to the main site and read the archives <br/>
of the past few weeks.  Or just wait until some new original subjects start.  <br/>
Or start one of your own!<br/>

You are of course welcome to jump in a chat or listen for a while to get the <br/>
feel of the list.<br/>
You can also read the archives for a few weeks back.<br/>
