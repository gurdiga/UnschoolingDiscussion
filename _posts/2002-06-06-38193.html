&lt;&lt;  Please let me know what you know about this shot. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I personally feel that it&#39;s one of the safer immunizations. That&#39;s coming <br/>
from a person that doesn&#39;t immunize her children!<br/>
Did the wound bleed really well when he got injured? If so, it cleansed <br/>
itself and I don&#39;t see any reason to worry about giving him the shot.<br/>

When Marty stepped on a nail in an automotive junkyard, it went through his <br/>
rubber-soled shoe and way into him.  So it deposited to the bone whatever <br/>
crap (literally) was on his show, the who-knows-what diesel/transmission <br/>
fluid/oil was on the nail and the ground and whatever was growing on the <br/>
board, and it did NOT bleed freely, and I agreed quickly to a tetanus shot.  <br/>
<br/>
So even if there aren&#39;t horses, there are still nasty-places.  Stepping on a <br/>
new nail in a board on a known lawn barefooted would seem really different to <br/>
me.    This nail had been around, and was rusty, and rust is rough and yuck <br/>
and can harbor evil other.<br/>
