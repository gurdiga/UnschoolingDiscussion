<div id="ygrps-yiv-143860910">Over the years, most of my oldest (18yo always unschooled) daughter&#39;s friends <br/>
have been schooled. So she&#39;s learned a lot about what school looks like from <br/>
the outside. When she occasionally decided to put herself on a &quot;school <br/>
schedule&quot;, something resembling SSR was usually included, and was often the <br/>
reason she decided to drop her schedule - because she started to hate picking <br/>
up a good book knowing she was going to have to put it down again in half an <br/>
hour and go on to something else. <br/>
<br/>
Over the years too she took notice of the attitudes her friends developed <br/>
toward books and reading. At 16 she recommended a novel to a friend, to be <br/>
told &quot;I don&#39;t have to read that, so I won&#39;t&quot;. At 17 another friend, a <br/>
National Honor Society member, asked her to go to the library to help pick <br/>
out a book. The friend said she hadn&#39;t read anything all summer and so wanted <br/>
to assign herself something to get back into reading. When asked what authors <br/>
she&#39;d enjoyed before, what types of stories she might like, her friend <br/>
replied &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. Just make sure it&#39;s at least 700 pages.&quot; Melissa <br/>
was absolutely astonished that anyone would pick a book by weight. These were <br/>
just a few of the most memorable examples.<br/>
<br/>
SSR isn&#39;t a particularly new concept. It was popular in my oldest son&#39;s <br/>
schools in the 80&#39;s. At least there the teachers really did work at making <br/>
sure the kids had things to read of their own choice, without restrictions. <br/>
They could bring in magazines, comics, books, whatever they wanted, as long <br/>
as they had something to read. And everybody read. When the bell went off, <br/>
every single person in the school picked up something and sat down to read <br/>
it. The principal read, the janitors read, the teachers read. It wasn&#39;t just <br/>
something being done to the kids. <br/>
