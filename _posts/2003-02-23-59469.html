<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did I mention the 3 moving boxes in the living room?  Jackie has been making<br/>
&gt; things with boxes for a while and kept saying she needed a bigger box.  It<br/>
&gt; finally occurred to me to buy her one.  I took her to a moving place and she<br/>
&gt; picked out a wardrobe box.  She was SO happy.  Well worth the $10.  She told<br/>
&gt; me I was The Best Mom.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gee, I&#39;d like to get that kind of credit for coming up with boxes.  I do<br/>
that all the time.  I live in a military community.  Getting boxes involves<br/>
intercepting the new neighbors on the stairs, before they collapse and<br/>
recycle all their boxes!  Cheap fun.<br/>
<br/>
Right now my little Calvin-maniac is working on a transmorgifier.  He&#39;s<br/>
upset that it doesn&#39;t work like Calvin&#39;s yet.  I&#39;m doing my part to help<br/>
with it by buying more Calvin and Hobbs books.  Two today -- the one decent<br/>
English-language bookstore actually had some we didn&#39;t already own!  Hooray!<br/>
