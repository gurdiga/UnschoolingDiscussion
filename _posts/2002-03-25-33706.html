<div id="ygrps-yiv-623740517">Example of neglect, usually prosecuted:  You leave your children with a<br/>
caregiver with a history of mental illness that manifests itself in suicide<br/>
attempts.  You leave your children in the home even though you know that the<br/>
woman does not want to be there and does want to be in a psych unit.  You<br/>
leave your children in the home even though you see that this woman has not<br/>
bathed and isn&#39;t eating.  You leave the children even though you know that<br/>
support will not be there for at least an hour.  You leave the children<br/>
there even though several people have warned you that this women is not<br/>
stable and needs care herself.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that is prosecutable and should be.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  You are a caregiver and you are suppose to be helping to care for<br/>
children at 9 a.m.  You do not show up until several hours later and by that<br/>
time the children are dead.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that is prosecutable and should be.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Your patient is a diabetic who has a history of going into<br/>
diabetic comas.  The family tells you the patient is in the same condition<br/>
she has been in just prior to all other times she has gone into a coma.  You<br/>
say no admissions and, oh by the way, I am going to take the patient off her<br/>
medication.  Patient goes into coma and subsequently dies.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that is prosecutable and should be.<br/>
<br/>
And, if those lols are paranoid schizophrenics who have a prior history of<br/>
violence, then no you shouldn&#39;t be letting your children play there IF the<br/>
patients are not medicated and closely monitored.  However, there are many<br/>
forms of schizophrenia, so a blanket discription doesn&#39;t really tell what is<br/>
going on next door to you.<br/>
<br/>
As to the bank robbery.  Hey, you are a female, in TX they just might<br/>
prosecute you!<br/>
