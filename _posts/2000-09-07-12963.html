<div id="ygrps-yiv-545469199">Sorry I have gotten so far behind with all the mail-I haven&#39;t even seen all <br/>
the previous posts on this, but Jen would get awful rashes, and finally in <br/>
desperation I used neosporin and it worked wonders! If it is yeast, any of <br/>
the yeast infection creams will get it, if they don&#39;t work, go for bacterial <br/>
with the neosporin-they even make one with pain relief.<br/>

&gt;My girls are older now, but I remember a bad rash my first one had and I <br/>
&gt;put<br/>
&gt;a light on her bum while she was sleeping with no diaper on. Or the blow<br/>
&gt;dryer on low, but they may not stay still long enough for that!<br/>
