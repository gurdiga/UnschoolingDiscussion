<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034305307">My son was on chemo and wasn&#39;t always the most cooperative about taking his<br/>
meds.<br/>
<br/>
What we did was give him total control over his meds (when, how, flavors,<br/>
did he want it in ice cream, hidden in chocolate, etc).  The only choice he<br/>
could NOT make was NOT to take the meds.<br/>
<br/>
Once he had as much control over the process as possible, it was rare to<br/>
have an argument over meds.<br/>
<br/>
We crushed his in hershey&#39;s syrup, ice cream, yogurt; cut the pills into<br/>
tiny pieces and hid them in a large mouthful of mini-m&ms, until he finally<br/>
just learned to swallow them whole.  Then he got to pick the drink of choice<br/>
for that.<br/>
