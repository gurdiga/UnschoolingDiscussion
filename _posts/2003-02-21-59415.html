<br/>
The Myth of &quot;Learning&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The trouble with talk about &quot;learning experiences&quot; is that it implies<br/>
that all experiences can be divided into two kinds, those from<br/>
which we learn something, and those from which we learn nothing.<br/>
But there are no experiences from which we learn nothing. We<br/>
learn something from everything we do, and everything that<br/>
happens to us or is done to us. What we learn may make us more<br/>
informed or more ignorant, wiser or stupider, stronger or weaker,<br/>
but we always learn something. What it is depends on the<br/>
experience, and above all, on how we feel about it. A central point<br/>
of this book is that we are very unlikely to learn anything good<br/>
from experiences which do seem to us closely connected with<br/>
what is interesting and important in the rest of our lives. Curiosity<br/>
is never idle; it grows out of real concerns and real needs.<br/>

<br/>
Growing up Unschooled<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger I never had to worry about assignments with<br/>
time restrictions, grades or tests, because I never had them. No, I<br/>
wasn&#39;t a school drop out. I was homeschooled. I&#39;ve never been to<br/>
any school prior to college. People tend to act funny when I tell<br/>
them that. They ask “You&#39;ve never been to school?” to which I reply<br/>
“no.” Or they ask “Well how do you make friends?” and I say “I&#39;m in<br/>
dance, I used to be in girl scouts and if all else fails you knock on<br/>
the doors of your neighbors and start up a conversation.” But my<br/>
favorite question of all time was asked to me by a store clerk “How<br/>
do you learn to communicate with people outside of your family?” I<br/>
stared at her blankly and said “I&#39;m talking to you aren&#39;t I?”. <br/>
<br/>
The next thing they want to know is how many hours a day I spend<br/>
doing “school.” This has no easy answer. If by school they mean<br/>
sitting down with a text book, or doing math problems, then the<br/>
answer is usually only one or two days out of a month (unless I&#39;ve<br/>
been on an I need to go to school kick). But if by “school” they<br/>
mean learning, then its anytime I&#39;m awake. The methods my Mom<br/>
has used to teach me aren&#39;t what you would call traditional. For the<br/>
most part she goes with the flow, letting me absorb all the rich<br/>
knowledge around me, rather than pounding it into my head. Letting<br/>
me ask questions and then helping me figure out answers, rather<br/>
than quizzing me about things I already know. For me, learning<br/>
something new is an everyday experience, so my memories of<br/>
learning are tied in with my memories of my family and friends.... I<br/>
don&#39;t really remember learning how to read, or write, or do math in<br/>
my head. I just do it. It&#39;s like walking, I know I had to learn how to do<br/>
it at some point, but I don&#39;t really remember learning how...<br/>
<br/>
...We moved to Illinois when I was six.  I made friends with the girl<br/>
across the street. She thought it was so cool that I was already<br/>
home when she got home from school. We stuck together like glue<br/>
on paper. Not everyone thought it was such a cool thing to be<br/>
homeschooled though. I remember my first dance class after we<br/>
moved to Illinois. I was six, and my shoes weren&#39;t the right color.<br/>
When I lived in California my dance teacher had us wear black ballet<br/>
shoes. They didn&#39;t show dirt like the pink ones did. But here in Illinois<br/>
EVERYONE had pink ballet shoes and even the teacher was surprised<br/>
that I didn&#39;t have the right shoes. I remember sitting around in a<br/>
circle and taking turns telling everyone our names and where we<br/>
went to school. I remember how everyone looked at me funny when I<br/>
said I was homeschooled. I was different from them, in two ways,<br/>
the color of my shoes, and my school and they didn&#39;t seem to like<br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
For the first time in my life I wanted to go to school. I wanted to<br/>
be like everyone else. I wanted to be surrounded by friends. I<br/>
wanted to be popular. I didn&#39;t want to be different. “Is that what<br/>
school is supposed to be about Melissa?” my Mother had asked me.<br/>
“No, it&#39;s not” I had said “But please I want to go to school.” I made<br/>
up a schedule for homeschooling. I decided I was going to learn like<br/>
everyone else. I would read about history for an hour and then<br/>
write down everything I had read, then do math for an hour, then<br/>
eat lunch, then I had a half hour to read anything I wanted, then I<br/>
would write a story. This quickly got dull and pointless. I was doing<br/>
math problems not because I wanted to, but because I thought I had<br/>
to. I was reading history I wasn&#39;t interested in, or already knew. I<br/>
was writing the most pointless things just for the sake of writing.<br/>
Worst of all, I was putting a time limit on my reading. I looked at my<br/>
friend&#39;s math book, the one she was having problems in. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
that hard, it took me five minutes to solve all 50 problems.  I<br/>
decided I was just as smart as everyone else my age, and if I had<br/>
gotten this smart without trying before, there wasn&#39;t any reason I<br/>
should change what I was doing. I told my mom I didn&#39;t want to go to<br/>
school after all...<br/>
<br/>
...I watched my friends go to high school and become zombies,<br/>
working on papers far into the night, studying until their eyes<br/>
burned only to get a C on their next test. I saw one of my best<br/>
friends stop reading because it had become a chore associated with<br/>
school. Referring to a novel I had recommended she once told me “I<br/>
don&#39;t have to read this, so I won&#39;t read this.”  While all my friends<br/>
were sweating over Biology finals I was taking trips to the zoo and<br/>
spending hours drawing the vast array of life there. While they were<br/>
cramming for a history exam, I was taking trips to the Field Museum<br/>
of natural history. While they were struggling to finish a book<br/>
report, I was talking to my parents about the latest book I had<br/>
read...<br/>

What Parents Learn<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve learned to trust our children and ourselves. Trust is not easy<br/>
to come by, and it&#39;s made even harder by schooling which teaches<br/>
us not to trust ourselves, or our own instincts and feelings, but to<br/>
rely on expertise and authority instead. Schooling utilizes a top<br/>
down chain of command, a heirarchical student-teacher relationship,<br/>
but homeschooling doesn&#39;t need to replicate this hurtful pattern. <br/>
Homeschooling encourages the development of a loving relationship<br/>
based on caring and trust between parent and child, and this is the<br/>
best possible environment for real learning to take place. Real<br/>
learning, like how to talk to other people about minor and major<br/>
things, how to determine what needs doing and the best way in which<br/>
to get it done, how to find one&#39;s rightful place in a confusing and<br/>
complex world, how to truly live a life filled with goodness and worth-<br/>
iness and love.<br/>
<br/>
While this learning is happening to our children, similar learning is<br/>
happening to us as parents. We begin to question long-held assump-<br/>
tions about children and learning and our own place in the puzzle. We<br/>
begin to see that what we were told about certain things like educa-<br/>
tion and earning a living and what&#39;s worth doing with our lives is not<br/>
necessarily true, and we find ourselves searching for answers to<br/>
questions we thought we already knew the answers to.<br/>
<br/>
As parents for over twenty years now, we&#39;ve learned that we don&#39;t<br/>
have all the answers. Sometimes our children have better answers<br/>
than we do, especially as they&#39;ve grown older. We&#39;ve taught them to<br/>
think carefully, and to consider several angles and approaches to a<br/>
situation when necessary, but we&#39;re not as good at it as they are<br/>
now. We&#39;ve learned that being open to new ideas, new ways of<br/>
looking at things, is a valuable approach to life, but old habits and<br/>
old ways of doing things can be difficult to let go. Our children are<br/>
helping us learn to let go and embrace new ways of seeing, hearing,<br/>
and feeling.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve often quoted an old saying, whose author we&#39;ve long forgot-<br/>
ten, that goes something like this: &quot;We can teach our children to<br/>
have courage, faith and endurance; they can teach us to laugh, to<br/>
sing, and to love.&quot; In the final analysis, these lessons are probably<br/>
the most important ones.<br/>

What if Everybody Unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
It all boils down to a truth quickly learned by most families who decide<br/>
to try &quot;just partly unschooling.&quot; They may manage for a while to keep<br/>
the unschooling approach limited to only a few subject areas, but un-<br/>
schooling ideas are insidious; they sneak and slither their way into<br/>
every part of your life. The learning theory that you meant to apply<br/>
just to the kids is indeed highly contagious. You begin to realize that<br/>
you&#39;re envying your children the enthusiasm and eagerness with which<br/>
they explore their world, and you realize that unschooling ideas are<br/>
just as applicable to your own life. And then, of course, you&#39;re hooked<br/>
for good. Once you&#39;ve unschooled your children and yourselves, you<br/>
begin to wonder how to apply unschooling ideas to other areas of your<br/>
lives, to your work and your community.<br/>
<br/>
We look to our communities and wonder why the ideas that seem so <br/>
obvious to us are so strange to the rest of the population. Why does<br/>
our society increasingly try to keep our children separate from the<br/>
rest of society, from what will become the locus of their everyday<br/>
lives once they reach adulthood? In our zeal to rescue children from<br/>
exploitation, from child labor and unsafe living conditions, why have<br/>
we moved so far to the other extreme --- to keeping the workings of<br/>
adult life completely out of the view of most children, even of older<br/>
adolescents?<br/>
<br/>
That so many children become lost when they reach the legal age of<br/>
maturity shouldn&#39;t be surprising. With all their years in school, with<br/>
classes and assignments scheduled throughout for them, when and<br/>
where do most children get a chance to feel useful, to create a meaningful <br/>
place for themselves? They&#39;re considered too young, too<br/>
immature, too unreliable, too untrustworthy to be allowed to do much<br/>
of any real value; it&#39;s no wonder so many turn to their peers for<br/>
affirmation and respect. We &quot;protect&quot; them from doing anything<br/>
much in the way of real, meaningful work, deny them the opportunity<br/>
to find places where they are truly needed, and then turn around and<br/>
blame them for never doing anything worthwhile. If school is to pre-<br/>
pare our kids for that archetypal real world, why are other schools<br/>
the only places in that real world that are even remotely like school?<br/>
Why don&#39;t we make more room for our children in every aspect of our<br/>
society, welcome them into our everyday lives and work?<br/>
<br/>
In many ways, unschooling can be reduced to that hoary old chestnut<br/>
from the sixties --- the one you still see occasionally on bumper<br/>
stickers today: &quot;Question Authority!&quot; Ask why we always do things<br/>
the way we&#39;ve always done them, but ask with an open mind. Figure<br/>
out what works and what doesn&#39;t, and use what works.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us who occasionally ponder that second-most-asked question --- what <br/>
if everybody unschooled? --- don&#39;t have any real answers.<br/>
What would such a society be like? What if we did not classify and<br/>
categorize children according to their age and the facility with which<br/>
they acquire skills? What if we worked from their strengths instead of <br/>
concentrating on their weaknesses? What if every person dis-<br/>
covered and pursued at least one passion, one positive interest that<br/>
consumed them to the point where they became expert at it (or at<br/>
least found joy in the search)? What would being a part of such a<br/>
community be like?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly an intriguing idea. I intend to find out.<br/>

<br/>
Take your child&#39;s wacky ideas seriously. When your child tells you that<br/>
he believes he has psychic powers or that the moon is made of green<br/>
cheese, don&#39;t tell him he&#39;s wrong or is being ridiculous; don&#39;t laugh at him <br/>
or criticize him. Instead, ask him questions and discuss the idea<br/>
with him. Give him the chance to take the idea in another direction or<br/>
to discover himself that it&#39;s wrong... Ideas are delicate things, and<br/>
they need room to grow. As easy as it is shut down the creative impulse in <br/>
adults, it&#39;s even easier in children.<br/>

Keeping a Log<br/>
<br/>
One thing that has been beneficial to me as a homeschooling mom <br/>
who is transitioning to unschooling (since we didn&#39;t start out that <br/>
way) is to keep a little log of what my kids do during the day. I <br/>
have a special calendar just for this purpose and I just jot down <br/>
&quot;Casablanca&quot; or X-Box Halo or Discovery Channel Temple of<br/>
Artemis. I was one of those who was worried that &quot;all my kids <br/>
would do all day is watch TV and play X-box left to themselves.&quot; <br/>
What&#39;s been so wonderful about my little, informal log is that it is <br/>
physical proof *to myself* that my kids are doing far more than <br/>
TV and X box. It also is a way for me to track the <br/>
interconnectedness of their learning which is uncluding TV and <br/>
X-box. :)<br/>
<br/>
For example, my kids love to watch Jackie Chan cartoon on <br/>
Saturday mornings. Last week we were reading In the Year of <br/>
the Boar and Jackie Robinson aloud. Both of these have tie ins <br/>
to China which led us to reading more about China. We went on <br/>
a binge of figuring out our Chinese birth year names. (Mine is the <br/>
Year of the White Cow...) Then we went from that to the <br/>
constellations and various ways that other cultures count years <br/>
and keep calendars (solar, lunar or solar/lunar).<br/>
<br/>
Then the kids got interested in the Silk Road which ends or <br/>
begins in China (they liked the book we found at the library <br/>
because it&#39;s introduced by Yo Yo Ma, someone they respect and <br/>
love from having heard of him originally on Arthur, the PBS <br/>
cartoon... do you see where this is going yet?). Anyway, we were <br/>
reading along about China and the Silk Route and the kids <br/>
wanted to read about cultural celebrations in China.<br/>
<br/>
So we took out another book on celebrations and in it, it circled <br/>
back to the Chinese zodiac. It wasn&#39;t until this book that I realized <br/>
that the Chinese zodiac is actually a 12 year cycle, not 12 <br/>
months. My 8 yo boy suddenly blurts out: I know the characters of <br/>
the Chinese zodiac and all their powers! I was shocked. &quot;How do <br/>
you know that Liam?&quot; They&#39;re on Jackie Chan! Then he <br/>
proceeded to look at the pictures and tell me all the names and <br/>
each of their personalities. Full circle.<br/>
<br/>
This interweaving of pop culture, TV, and cartoons with history, <br/>
religion, holidays, geography... well it literally floored me. And I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure that if I hadn&#39;t been keeping that log, I would have <br/>
forgotten some of the connections. For me, the log gives me a <br/>
sense of ownership and also reassurance during the transition. <br/>
I also think it will be easier for me at the end of the year to pull <br/>
together the stuff we&#39;ve done into come kind of coherent picture <br/>
for the year end assessment (Ohio requires this or testing).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to share another part of my process, <br/>
especially since so manyare trying to make the transition from <br/>
one way of learning to this newer, more insecure world of <br/>
unschooling. :)<br/>
