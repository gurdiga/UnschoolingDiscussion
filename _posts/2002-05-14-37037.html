&gt; about <br/>
&gt; how to be happy? Happiness is apparently not all that easy and not all that <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; common. I WONDER if maybe that&#39;s because it wasn&#39;t encouraged in people <br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; they were children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It seems that people start hanging out at the self-help section of the <br/>
libraries/bookstores at about thirty years old. Let&#39;s say they&#39;re in school <br/>
for 12/13 years (add more for preschool, day care, etc.), then college for <br/>
4/5 and maybe graduate school of some sort---then add all those years up. <br/>
Tack on the year or three after &quot;graduation&quot; when they STILL believe that <br/>
school&#39;s good for you. I&#39;m guessing that with the one month per year of  <br/>
&quot;education&quot; of deschooling necessary, thirty is about the right age for <br/>
people to start looking for &quot;something&quot;---happiness or peace or their <br/>
&quot;souls&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law said that she just wanted her children to be happy adults. <br/>
Seems to me that the best path there is to have happy childhoods. My goal is <br/>
happy childhoods for my children. I think the happy adulthood will follow.<br/>
