<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494603081">Wait!  I just remember the great idea someone tried.....<br/>
Their son made a list of all the questions they had about<br/>
school.....everything  they were wondering about.<br/>
Then, they made an appointment with the school principal, and the child<br/>
interviewed the principal, and had all their questions answered......<br/>
that was enough to change their mind.  I think it was a fantastic way<br/>
for the decision to be made.<br/>
I hope I can remember this years from now when I have to deal with this<br/>
problem.<br/>
