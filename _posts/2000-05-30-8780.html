<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366737837">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Yet another article here on bullying in Japan, this time as a part of the <br/>
classroom curriculum for both students and teachers. A very inventive <br/>
approach: If you can&#39;t beat &#39;em, study &#39;em....<br/>
<br/>
I found this paragraph of the story to be of key importance: &quot;However, <br/>
they learned from the rulings that they have the option of transferring <br/>
to another school or staying home, and that bullies can be ordered to <br/>
stay home. Many students expressed relief.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, families in Japan are coming to know that they have viable <br/>
educational choices. Staying home (and learning) is indeed one of them.<br/>

COURT RULINGS USED TO STUDY BULLYING <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
KAGOSHIMA -- A teaching program that uses mock civil actions based on <br/>
actual bullying cases has recently started to attract the attention of <br/>
primary and middle school teachers nationwide. <br/>
<br/>
In response to an actual bullying case in Kagoshima Prefecture that ended <br/>
with the suicide of a middle school student, teachers and university <br/>
researchers jointly developed the program to show students how to act <br/>
when confronted with bullying. <br/>
<br/>
To make the material suitable for classroom study, the Kagoshima <br/>
University researchers put the legalistic language of the rulings into <br/>
layman&#39;s terms.<br/>
<br/>
Under the program, students learn that bullying can lead to crime, and <br/>
that adults have a responsibility to prevent it. <br/>
<br/>
As word of the program has spread, a growing number of primary and middle <br/>
school teachers and officials of prefectural education boards across the <br/>
country have begun asking the developers of the program for more <br/>
information. The Niigata prefectural government&#39;s board of education has <br/>
adopted the program into its bullying-prevention plan. <br/>
<br/>
Prof. Hirofumi Uneme, a specialist in civil law, and Assistant Prof. <br/>
Masanobu Umeno, an education expert, both with Kagoshima University, <br/>
worked on school bullying rulings that were handed down in five civil <br/>
actions. <br/>
<br/>
Umeno is a member of a bullying-prevention group formed after a <br/>
third-year middle school boy from Chirancho in the prefecture committed <br/>
suicide in 1996 as a result of the bullying he suffered. <br/>
<br/>
Umeno came up with the idea of using bullying case rulings as an <br/>
effective means to combat and eliminate bullying after realizing the <br/>
limited effectiveness of such slogans as &quot;Bullying should not be <br/>
tolerated.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He said he found that the rulings referred to the action adults involved <br/>
should have taken to prevent the victimization. The rulings also <br/>
contained objective reviews of the way the cases were handled and the way <br/>
they should have been handled in relation to the bully, victim, teacher, <br/>
parents and others concerned, he said. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The rulings themselves offer ideal solutions to those involved in <br/>
bullying cases,&quot; Umeno said. &quot;That is, how those directly involved and <br/>
those around them should have acted to stop the bullying.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The two university researchers have so far simplified the language of the <br/>
five cases -- including one that occurred in 1986 at Nakano-Fujimi Middle <br/>
School in Nakano Ward, Tokyo, in which a student committed suicide as a <br/>
result of bullying not only by students, but also by teachers. <br/>
<br/>
The rewritten versions of the rulings have already been used in classes <br/>
for primary school and middle school students. <br/>
<br/>
Under the new program, five to eight class-hours are usually needed. <br/>
First, students are asked to consider the circumstances and the <br/>
individuals involved in a case. <br/>
<br/>
They then write down the specific descriptions of acts that the court <br/>
found to be instances of bullying. They include such descriptions as &quot;The <br/>
ringleader told all the boys in a class to snub boy &#39;A&#39;&quot;; &quot;A group of <br/>
bullies surrounded the boy, who was shaking with fear, on the rooftop of <br/>
the school building and started punching and kicking him repeatedly&quot;; and <br/>
&quot;They took turns calling his house to intimidate him.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
When the students compare each description with the corresponding penal <br/>
code provision, they gain an understanding that acts of bullying are <br/>
equivalent to such crimes as assault and extortion. <br/>
<br/>
The rulings disclose chilling accounts of actual bullying cases and the <br/>
events that surrounded them, such as, &quot;The boy hid behind the gymnasium <br/>
without eating lunch to avoid the bullies&quot; and &quot;The homeroom teacher was <br/>
afraid of the bullies because he had also been attacked by them.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Through the program students become aware of the difficulties of putting <br/>
the principle of taking action to stop bullying into practice. <br/>
<br/>
In the second half of the program, the students learn that teachers and <br/>
parents are responsible for protecting children from bullying. They look <br/>
at specific cases to see who assumed responsibility and why. They also <br/>
examine actual rulings ordering schools to pay compensation and the court <br/>
decisions that assess blame to the various parties involved. <br/>
<br/>
The students are then encouraged to view a case by imagining themselves <br/>
as victims and witnesses. <br/>
<br/>
Many students said they assumed, before attending the program, that they <br/>
would have to attend classes even if they were subjected to bullying at <br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
However, they learned from the rulings that they have the option of <br/>
transferring to another school or staying home, and that bullies can be <br/>
ordered to stay home. Many students expressed relief. <br/>
<br/>
One fifth-year primary school boy said he now knew of options other than <br/>
committing suicide, while a female middle school student wrote in her <br/>
report that she once thought of killing herself when she was bullied. &quot;I <br/>
wish I could have taken this program earlier,&quot; she wrote. <br/>
<br/>
Some students worked out practical countermeasures during the program, <br/>
such as telling the teacher in private about bullying, giving <br/>
encouragement to a victim of bullying in a letter, and collecting <br/>
evidence of bullying and appealing directly to the principal with it. <br/>
<br/>
Uneme pointed out that the time had come for incorporating specific <br/>
measures to prevent violence and bullying into school curriculums. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The rulings also are an ideal reference for teachers to study their <br/>
legal responsibilities in relation to bullying,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a <br/>
sheer waste if we do not make the most of them in the classroom to <br/>
prevent recurrences of bullying.&quot; <br/>
