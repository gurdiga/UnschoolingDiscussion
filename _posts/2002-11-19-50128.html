<br/>
  Well, you have to put that into perspective. It is usually so steamy and hot here, that when it does get into the 30&#39;s, (which it does, occasionally) it is extremely cold to us. Even the 50&#39;s are cold to native or naturalized Floridaians. I am about an hour south of Sea World,(love it there, we have anual passes) on the Space Coast. Florida is great, come on down, lots of homeschoolers and unschoolers too:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161669665">I&#39;d say perspective,,,its a balmy 34 this morning and I was thinking earlier,  ohh, I have to get outside and enjoy the warm weather!    All my snow is melting,  the kids were all grumpy yesterday because they were trying to cross country ski and the snow was going, going.<br/>

  Well, you have to put that into perspective. It is usually so steamy and hot here, that when it does get into the 30&#39;s, (which it does, occasionally) it is extremely cold to us. Even the 50&#39;s are cold to native or naturalized Floridaians. I am about an hour south of Sea World,(love it there, we have anual passes) on the Space Coast. Florida is great, come on down, lots of homeschoolers and unschoolers too:)<br/>

I know what you mean, when it gets in the 60s here thats about as cold as I<br/>
ever want it! And to think that I grew up in Jersey, with lots of snow..<br/>
yuck, now dont get me wrong snow is beautiful but...it gets really ugly<br/>
after a few days ,in the roads at least. I dont mind looking at it throught<br/>
a nice window and maybe even building a quick snowman but thats it, I just<br/>
cannot handle being cold, or wrapped up so much you cant move right!. I like<br/>
...no coats...maybe a sweater..<br/>
I will be in Orlando in march from the 2nd thru the 9th lets meet...maybe at<br/>
Sea world??<br/>
Have  a great day<br/>
Heidi<br/>

<h4>Denese Kolb</h4>
<time>19 Nov 2002, at  9:14am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155884164">I will be in Orlando in march from the 2nd thru the 9th lets meet...maybe at<br/>
Sea world?? <br/>
Have  a great day <br/>
Heidi <br/>
<br/>
That sounds like fun. Are you guys coming to do the theme park thing?<br/>
Denese<br/>
  Yes but it doesnt go down in the 30s and stay there for days on end, at <br/>
  lease not what I have heard about the orlando area. I want to be within an <br/>
  hour of Sea World! Where are you at? <br/>
  Heidi <br/>
<br/>
  Well, you have to put that into perspective. It is usually so steamy and<br/>
hot here, that when it does get into the 30&#39;s, (which it does, occasionally)<br/>
it is extremely cold to us. Even the 50&#39;s are cold to native or naturalized<br/>
Floridaians. I am about an hour south of Sea World,(love it there, we have<br/>
anual passes) on the Space Coast. Florida is great, come on down, lots of<br/>
homeschoolers and unschoolers too:) <br/>

<h4>Kelli Traaseth</h4>
<time>19 Nov 2002, at  9:51am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836969249">I have to say..<br/>
we were down there last November,  stayed first in Cocoa Beach area, visited Space Camp, a friend of a friend is the nurse there.  Got a tour, we all loved it and almost got to see the shuttle take off but it was cloudy so it got called off.  So we stayed longer at Animal Kingdom,  <br/>
 <br/>
Florida  was a dream in November,,  we loved it, everything was pretty slow, Disneyworld,  and everything,  but the weather was awesome, walking down the walk way in front of Cinderalla&#39;s castle I was just sighing saying this is perfect..  75-80 degrees,   we didn&#39;t have to wait in lines for anything and we stayed at a Holiday Inn and Suites in a 3 br suite for around $90 a night,  the week was great.<br/>
 <br/>
Then,  in May we were down to Key Biscayne for a long weekend, Oh my gosh, I about died whenever I went outside, too hot for me.. If I was by the water, I was OK.  Other wise, forget it.  Sweated like a pig.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think I fit in with that group of people.  Like I told my dh,  &quot;I don&#39;t think my Winstar would fit in with these vehicles!!&quot;  I got some pretty odd looks as I was bringing some groceries and wine in from the grocery store!! &lt;gg&gt;  The Ritz and me,....hmmm.. not quite in sync.<br/>
We won the trip,  so it was free,  I would never stay there again.  Beautiful but soooo.. stuffy.   If anyone wants to hear about our stay there, which was quite hilarious, let me know. <br/>
 <br/>
I would love to go down there, to FL, again, right now!<br/>
The kids didn&#39;t get to go to Sea World,  My husband and I did in May, we got to swim with the dolphins,  ohhh, I wanted to bring one home.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll stop now...<br/>

Kelli, the penguin<br/>
<br/>
Kelli,<br/>
You&#39;ld be feeling drunk a lot:)<br/>
When it is October and still over 89 degrees outside, it does get old. None of my kids have ever seen snow and I would love for them to be able to.However, I have been to Niagra Falls in November and I know what cold is, so I am reluctant.<br/>
Enjoy your snow.<br/>
Denese<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Yes but it doesnt go down in the 30s and stay there for days on end, at<br/>
  lease not what I have heard about the orlando area. I want to be within an<br/>
  hour of Sea World! Where are you at? <br/>
  Heidi <br/>
<br/>
  Well, you have to put that into perspective. It is usually so steamy and hot here, that when it does get into the 30&#39;s, (which it does, occasionally) it is extremely cold to us. Even the 50&#39;s are cold to native or naturalized Floridaians. I am about an hour south of Sea World,(love it there, we have anual passes) on the Space Coast. Florida is great, come on down, lots of homeschoolers and unschoolers too:)<br/>

<h4>Denese Kolb</h4>
<time>19 Nov 2002, at  4:39pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915228577">I have to say..<br/>
we were down there last November,  stayed first in Cocoa Beach area, visited Space Camp, a friend of a friend is the nurse there.  Got a tour, we all loved it and almost got to see the shuttle take off but it was cloudy so it got called off.  So we stayed longer at Animal Kingdom,  <br/>
<br/>
Those shuttles are the most tempramental things. I always feel bad for people who come just to see them.It&#39;s worse since last September of course. They don&#39;t even announce the time of the launch until the day before.The absolute best place to see them is the beach, at night. We lived a block from Cocoa Beach where we could see the rockets on the pads, it was so cool.<br/>
<br/>
Florida  was a dream in November,,  we loved it, everything was pretty slow, Disneyworld,  and everything,  but the weather was awesome, walking down the walk way in front of Cinderalla&#39;s castle I was just sighing saying this is perfect..  75-80 degrees,   we didn&#39;t have to wait in lines for anything and we stayed at a Holiday Inn and Suites in a 3 br suite for around $90 a night,  the week was great.<br/>
<br/>
Then,  in May we were down to Key Biscayne for a long weekend, Oh my gosh, I about died whenever I went outside, too hot for me.. If I was by the water, I was OK.  Other wise, forget it.  Sweated like a pig.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think I fit in with that group of people.  Like I told my dh,  &quot;I don&#39;t think my Winstar would fit in with these vehicles!!&quot;  I got some pretty odd looks as I was bringing some groceries and wine in from the grocery store!! &lt;gg&gt;  The Ritz and me,....hmmm.. not quite in sync.<br/>
We won the trip,  so it was free,  I would never stay there again.  Beautiful but soooo.. stuffy.   If anyone wants to hear about our stay there, which was quite hilarious, let me know. <br/>
<br/>
Love to hear funny stories about stuffy people:)<br/>
You think May is hot, try August. It&#39;s practically unbearable. I can&#39;t believe people come here then.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to go down there, to FL, again, right now!<br/>
<br/>
Such enthusiasm! Come on down!<br/>
<br/>
The kids didn&#39;t get to go to Sea World,  My husband and I did in May, we got to swim with the dolphins,  ohhh, I wanted to bring one home.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had the chance to do that, man, you&#39;re lucky. We do get to see dolphins all the time, in the wild, whenever we go fishing or to the beach (even just driving by sometimes) I love them too:)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll stop now...<br/>

Kelli,<br/>
You&#39;ld be feeling drunk a lot:)<br/>
When it is October and still over 89 degrees outside, it does get old. None of my kids have ever seen snow and I would love for them to be able to.However, I have been to Niagra Falls in November and I know what cold is, so I am reluctant.<br/>
Enjoy your snow.<br/>
Denese<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Yes but it doesnt go down in the 30s and stay there for days on end, at<br/>
  lease not what I have heard about the orlando area. I want to be within an<br/>
  hour of Sea World! Where are you at? <br/>
  Heidi <br/>
<br/>
  Well, you have to put that into perspective. It is usually so steamy and hot here, that when it does get into the 30&#39;s, (which it does, occasionally) it is extremely cold to us. Even the 50&#39;s are cold to native or naturalized Floridaians. I am about an hour south of Sea World,(love it there, we have anual passes) on the Space Coast. Florida is great, come on down, lots of homeschoolers and unschoolers too:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043470705">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I had a conversation with our librarian yesterday. She wanted to know <br/>
what books I felt they should have available for homeschoolers, and a <br/>
list of books about homeschoolers, especially fiction.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, in three parts:<br/>
* what reference books are &quot;must haves&quot; for the library<br/>
* what books about homeschoolers<br/>
* what books - fiction - with homeschoolers in them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Susan<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We will be in Florida in a few weeks and will be visiting Orlando,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Traffic in Orlando is a nightmare. Not much to see in the city itself. There<br/>
are a couple of cool things in the area of the attractions to see that are<br/>
not very heavily advertised. There is a place called world of orchids if<br/>
your interested in that type of thing, they have a pretty good size lab<br/>
where they grow the seedlings, very interesting.<br/>
Be careful if you are staying near Disney, people do prey on tourists, just<br/>
be aware.<br/>
<br/>
 the Everglades<br/>
Never been there. I hear there are places in Miami where one would do well<br/>
not to get off the highway.<br/>
My nephew recently returned from a camping and airboat tour of the<br/>
Everglades and he loved it. Bring mosquito repelent., he was completely<br/>
covered in bites  :)<br/>
<br/>
If it is cold when you come a stop by one of our springs would be really<br/>
cool if you are interested in manatees.<br/>
Last winter we saw over a hundred in one place. It is a really neat<br/>
experience because all you ever hear is how they are always turning up<br/>
slaughtered by boats.<br/>
<br/>
 and the Space place.<br/>
<br/>
Last time we went there were armed soilders with automatic weapons<br/>
everywhere you looked. It was kind of unsettling to the little ones.<br/>
Security is very tight, most likely everything you bring will be thoroughly<br/>
searched.<br/>
And it costs about sixty dollars to have hotdogs for lunch there. Don&#39;t go<br/>
hungry. Otherwise it is awesome beyond belief, you won&#39;t believe the size of<br/>
the rockets. The memorial they have to fallen astronauts is very nice.<br/>
Don&#39;t miss Ron Jon if you get the chance, it is very close to KSC. Cocoa<br/>
beach is a nice quiet little town and they have a nice restaruant on the<br/>
pier there.<br/>
<br/>
Getting into Universal cheeply? I don&#39;t know, haven&#39;t figured that one out<br/>
yet, meet some people who work there and borrow their uniforms. It&#39;s<br/>
expensive. I have no idea how people can afford to come here and see all the<br/>
attractions.<br/>
Hope you have a great trip.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079817270">One of the best places to see them is in Volusia county, a little south and<br/>
west of Daytona. It&#39;s called Blue Springs State Park, I think the town is<br/>
called Deland. I think it&#39;s only about a half hour to 45 min. away from<br/>
Daytona.<br/>
Hope our cold snap holds for you so you&#39;ll be able to see them. The manatee<br/>
exhibit at Sea World is nice too. It&#39;s very doom and gloomy though. Sea<br/>
World is awesome, it&#39;s the only park we buy passes to, unfortunately they<br/>
expired on the first of the year or I&#39;d meet you there :)<br/>
Are you going to Daytona to see the race track?<br/>
