<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I really do feel, though, that things would be much improved if more (most?<br/>
&gt; all?) people could be surrounded by family that is willing to pitch in and<br/>
&gt; help whenever and however needed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great and noble idea, Myranda.  I&#39;m really in support of it.<br/>
<br/>
But you can&#39;t legislate family involvement, and you can&#39;t prevent your grown<br/>
children from living far from your benevolence.  If you&#39;re not there, or not<br/>
able to be there, or for whatever reason won&#39;t be there, how do you know if<br/>
all is well?  And that&#39;s why there is a &quot;village&quot;.  That&#39;s why state<br/>
agencies exist.  <br/>
