<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506537683">This is a funny coincidence, I was at the park with my dd (who&#39;s only <br/>
7!) and a youg man with his son, about 2, was asking about her.  Why <br/>
wasn&#39;t she in school, etc.  He seemed genuinely interested <br/>
in &quot;homeschooling&quot; (the term I use wuth strangers), so we ended up <br/>
having a short discussion about how I came to this decision.  Anyway, <br/>
the *What about college* question came up.  <br/>
<br/>
I said something like, &quot;oh, it&#39;s a long way off, and many children <br/>
who don&#39;t go to traditional schools still go to college if they want <br/>
to, blah, blah&quot;<br/>
And he said, &quot;I suppose she could go somewhere like Hamshire College&quot;<br/>
LOL.<br/>

I  grew up in the area and have always remembered an incident while riding on <br/>
one  of the 5 College Buses:<br/>
<br/>
A woman was boarding the bus through the rear  door and tripped up the steps. <br/>
 My initial reaction (at 16 or however old  I was) was to laugh--that&#39;s just <br/>
what you did if someone fell at school or  dropped their books or <br/>
whatever--that&#39;s what *everyone* did.   Oy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, another young woman who had gotten on at Hampshire (very  hippy-ish, <br/>
&quot;typical&quot; Hampshire student &lt;g&gt;) immediately jumped forward  and extended her <br/>
hand to the woman, asking, &quot;Are you OK?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It was  such a small act of kindness and it hit me *really* hard--made me <br/>
ashamed for  my feelings at the time and was such a clear lesson in what to do if <br/>
someone  is hurt or embarrassed in public.  It also made me realize how cruel <br/>
my  public school peers were and how cruel I had become.  <br/>
<br/>
That woman  was such a good example to me--I&#39;ve never forgotten her.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t know  that many of the students at Hampshire were homeschooled, and maybe <br/>
that young  woman wasn&#39;t one of them, but it strikes me that that sort of <br/>
behavior might  be more common among kids who&#39;ve avoided the dog-eat-dog mentality <br/>
of public  school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for letting me reminisce.<br/>

***********************************************<br/>
It probably didn&#39;t have to have anything to do with whether she was  <br/>
homeschooled or public schooled or whatever.<br/>
 <br/>
My experience there was that it was so different from public high school,  <br/>
and that the people were so happy it was, it led to more sane behavior. Yeah,  <br/>
there were lots of drugs and some alcohol there (early 80&#39;s), but unlike my  <br/>
friends at UMass or even Amherst College, the students were really into learning <br/>
 and exploring. Not just &quot;The Next Step on the Path.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
One story: after I graduated I volunteered for the Admissions office for a  <br/>
while doing interviews for students who wanted them or were required to have  <br/>
them. Most weren&#39;t required, but for special circumstances they were.<br/>
 <br/>
I got one kid who would have been an easy Yes for most schools. He was top  <br/>
five in his class, straight A&#39;s, jock, Eagle Scout, wanted to do  computers.  <br/>
Hampshire was requiring an interview because they were  concerned he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be a good fit. They mostly wanted to get a good answer to  &quot;Why Hampshire?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
He was this cool kid who talked about his parents meeting at Woodstock and  <br/>
that while he was very, very good at traditional school he wanted to go to a  <br/>
place where he could actually learn something about the world and about <br/>
himself.  He knew that Hampshire wasn&#39;t the prestige place for computers but that the <br/>
 resources were there.  He got in, and he loved it.<br/>
