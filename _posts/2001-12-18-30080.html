 </span></blockquote>Hi Karin,<br/>
<br/>
In our family, we never told the kid that Santa was real. We always <br/>
talked about the &#39;spirit of Santa&#39; and I always read him the great <br/>
newspaper editorial &#39;Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&#39; each year. It <br/>
goes along with the spirit of Santa, which I beleive exists.<br/>
<br/>
We also talk about the toymaker (St. Nick?) that used to fix toys and <br/>
give them out. Actually, I&#39;m butchering this story - my son&#39;s father <br/>
tells it better. Its a true story.<br/>
<br/>
Although, when my son and I lived in a great NY upstate town, Ithaca, we <br/>
wandered over to the Commons area one saturday afternoon. He was three <br/>
years old at the time.<br/>
<br/>
There was Santa walking around. He looked at me and said &#39;See mom, I TOLD <br/>
you Santa was real&#39; and he walked over to him, they sat down and they had <br/>
a great conversation. My son asked him what kind of year he was having, <br/>
where were the reindeer etc. Then he helped Santa hand out candy canes <br/>
for some time and they parted.<br/>
<br/>
Now that he&#39;s 5, other parents get pretty mad at me when he tells their <br/>
kids &#39;there is no santa, the parents PAY for the gifts.. so don&#39;t forget <br/>
to thank your parents!&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I feel okay that I never lied to him. And yes, we do talk about the <br/>
magical aspects of people who believe in something with the heart.<br/>
<br/>
merry and happy to one and all,<br/>

<br/>
Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus<br/>
<br/>
Editorial printed in the New York Sun in 1897.<br/>
<br/>
We take pleasure in answering thus prominently the communication <br/>
below, expressing at the same time our great gratification that its <br/>
faithful author is numbered among the friends of The Sun:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Editor---<br/>
<br/>
      I am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say there is no <br/>
Santa Claus. Papa says, &quot;If you see it in The Sun, it&#39;s so.&quot; Please <br/>
tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?<br/>
<br/>
     Virginia O&#39;Hanlon<br/>
<br/>
Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by <br/>
the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they <br/>
see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by <br/>
their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men&#39;s or <br/>
children&#39;s, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere <br/>
insect, an ant, in his intellect as compared with the boundless world <br/>
about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the <br/>
whole of truth and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love <br/>
and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and <br/>
give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would <br/>
be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as <br/>
if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, <br/>
no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should <br/>
have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The external light with <br/>
which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.<br/>
<br/>
Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies. <br/>
You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on <br/>
Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa <br/>
Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, <br/>
but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real <br/>
things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. <br/>
Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but <br/>
that&#39;s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or <br/>
imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.<br/>
<br/>
You tear apart the baby&#39;s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, <br/>
but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest <br/>
man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever <br/>
lived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push <br/>
aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory <br/>
beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is <br/>
nothing else real and abiding.<br/>
<br/>
No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives and lives forever. A thousand <br/>
years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will <br/>
continue to make glad the heart of childhood.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921940513">Thanks to all of you responding about Santa. I love reading all your opinions and personal feelings regarding kids and believing.<br/>
One of the reasons I&#39;m getting a little uneasy is because as the boys get older, their list gets more elaborate and expensive!<br/>
Here is an example of my kids Christmas list word for word:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Santa,<br/>
Here is my Christmas list:<br/>
<br/>
40 gb hardrive<br/>
2 sticks 256 mg of ram<br/>
Computer Case with motherboard with pentium 1 ghz processor<br/>
CD burner<br/>
a 5 1/4&quot; & 3 1/2&quot; built in floppy drive<br/>
a 3D graphics card with 10 mega bytes<br/>
10 packs of Harry Potter cards<br/>
a camera<br/>
a mini-video camera<br/>
razor scooter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my 8yo list. <br/>
I told them that was a very tall order for Santa and ds would be lucky to get one or two items on his list.<br/>
This is getting out of hand! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105619820">Our son (at two and a half) is already starting to get, from total<br/>
strangers, the routine that goes, &quot;Are you a good boy? Because Santa&#39;s<br/>
coming, you know. If you&#39;re good, he&#39;s going to bring you lots of toys.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to give anybody this power over him - or let them give us (his<br/>
parents) this power. When people ask whether he&#39;s a &quot;good boy&quot; (in Christmas<br/>
season or out), I say, &quot;Yes, he&#39;s good. All children are good. There are no<br/>
bad children.&quot; This usually throws &#39;em for a loop.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s even worse in Spain, where I lived for nine years, only there it&#39;s, &quot;If<br/>
you&#39;re good, los Reyes (the Kings, sort of what we know as the Three Wise<br/>
Men) will bring you gifts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I want our son to know it&#39;s us who buy him gifts, from the start. He can<br/>
believe in Santa the same way he believes he is a fireman battling a fire<br/>
when he puts a toy helmet on his head and waves around a toy snake. I don&#39;t<br/>
think that ruins the magic.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wondered what people think little kids in families where the<br/>
parents can&#39;t afford toys or are too drunk to remember it&#39;s Christmas must<br/>
think, when they don&#39;t get any toys. These kids must suspect they&#39;ve been<br/>
bad, right? What do the good kids in the middle class families think of the<br/>
poor kids who get fewer toys than they do? What do the ones who get toys<br/>
think of the Jewish, Muslim, etc., kids who don&#39;t get a visit from Santa?<br/>
<br/>
Why do people believe kids have to be bribed into being good? Is that really<br/>
being good, anyway? Isn&#39;t it being a kind of mercenary?<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, it eats me up inside to hear people sending their kids<br/>
off to school, or leaving them at the babysitter&#39;s, with the good old<br/>
all-purpose admonition, &quot;Be good, now.&quot; It&#39;s kind of a useless thing to say,<br/>
isn&#39;t it? Awfully vague. I prefer specifics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299978941">Hi..<br/>
<br/>
My 13 yr old knows the truth, and my 11 yr old just told me this year that he does, too. (I think he might have probably known last year, too, but didn&#39;t want to ruin it for me. &lt;G&gt;) My 6 yr old still wholeheartedly believes in Santa, and I&#39;m SO glad. To me, Santa is a spirit of the season (though not to replace our Christian views on the real reason for Christmas) and &#39;being Santa&#39; is something they enjoy every year. <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t tell our older kids about Santa&#39;s mythical status until they asked -- if they were happy believing, it was fine with us. I don&#39;t believe that they are harmed by us &#39;lying&#39; to them (and I use that word lightly, as I&#39;ve seen it referred to that lately by a few offline who don&#39;t think we should tell kids about Santa) nor do I think that they need to grow up as fast as many kids do anymore. <br/>
<br/>
When the 6 yo questions, we&#39;ll talk. The older two don&#39;t want to blow it for her, and when she asks, we&#39;ll be sure she doesn&#39;t blow it for our toddler either. It&#39;s a temporary thing, and I look forward to it each year :)<br/>

  Something I&#39;ve been wondering.<br/>
  How does Santa fit in with unschooling?<br/>
  How many here have kids who believe in Santa?<br/>
  What age, if any, should this belief stop?<br/>
<br/>
  My kids do believe in Santa. They are 8 & 10.<br/>
  I am beginning to squirm.<br/>
  I would love to hear how other&#39;s have handled this, and still managed to maintain some dignity for their kids.<br/>
  I&#39;m beginning to wonder if we have handled this the wrong way.<br/>
  My thinking has changed a lot since we&#39;ve started unschooling, including my thoughts about Santa.<br/>

  I have five kids, ages 15 through 28, who still believe in Santa, as <br/>
  I do myself.<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps it&#39;s time to share a favorite old classic. My kids especially <br/>
  loved it because my mother&#39;s name is Virginia, and they liked to <br/>
  imagine that she might have asked the question answered by Francis P. <br/>

<br/>
  Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus<br/>
<br/>
  Editorial printed in the New York Sun in 1897.<br/>
<br/>
  We take pleasure in answering thus prominently the communication <br/>
  below, expressing at the same time our great gratification that its <br/>
  faithful author is numbered among the friends of The Sun:<br/>
<br/>
  Dear Editor---<br/>
<br/>
        I am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say there is no <br/>
  Santa Claus. Papa says, &quot;If you see it in The Sun, it&#39;s so.&quot; Please <br/>
  tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?<br/>
<br/>
       Virginia O&#39;Hanlon<br/>
<br/>
  Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by <br/>
  the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they <br/>
  see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by <br/>
  their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men&#39;s or <br/>
  children&#39;s, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere <br/>
  insect, an ant, in his intellect as compared with the boundless world <br/>
  about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the <br/>
  whole of truth and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love <br/>
  and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and <br/>
  give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would <br/>
  be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as <br/>
  if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, <br/>
  no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should <br/>
  have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The external light with <br/>
  which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.<br/>
<br/>
  Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies. <br/>
  You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on <br/>
  Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa <br/>
  Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, <br/>
  but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real <br/>
  things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. <br/>
  Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but <br/>
  that&#39;s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or <br/>
  imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.<br/>
<br/>
  You tear apart the baby&#39;s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, <br/>
  but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest <br/>
  man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever <br/>
  lived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push <br/>
  aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory <br/>
  beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is <br/>
  nothing else real and abiding.<br/>
<br/>
  No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives and lives forever. A thousand <br/>
  years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will <br/>
  continue to make glad the heart of childhood.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279568626">LOL -- the few times I&#39;ve left my kids with a sitter, I&#39;ve said &quot;Be good.&quot; Why not? Kids aren&#39;t &#39;bad,&#39; but they can do bad things -- I&#39;d prefer they not do a bad (bad, wrong, etc...semantics) thing while not in the company of their parent, where we can deal with it the way we feel appropriate. I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m defining their personality in any way when I ask that they behave appropriately -- I&#39;d bet this is the same way many others mean it when they say it. I have older kids though, (as well as young ones) so I think it might make a difference when you&#39;re saying it to someone who actually knows more about what is right and wrong, as opposed to a small child who doesn&#39;t. <br/>

  Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Santa and unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Our son (at two and a half) is already starting to get, from total<br/>
  strangers, the routine that goes, &quot;Are you a good boy? Because Santa&#39;s<br/>
  coming, you know. If you&#39;re good, he&#39;s going to bring you lots of toys.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I refuse to give anybody this power over him - or let them give us (his<br/>
  parents) this power. When people ask whether he&#39;s a &quot;good boy&quot; (in Christmas<br/>
  season or out), I say, &quot;Yes, he&#39;s good. All children are good. There are no<br/>
  bad children.&quot; This usually throws &#39;em for a loop.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s even worse in Spain, where I lived for nine years, only there it&#39;s, &quot;If<br/>
  you&#39;re good, los Reyes (the Kings, sort of what we know as the Three Wise<br/>
  Men) will bring you gifts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I want our son to know it&#39;s us who buy him gifts, from the start. He can<br/>
  believe in Santa the same way he believes he is a fireman battling a fire<br/>
  when he puts a toy helmet on his head and waves around a toy snake. I don&#39;t<br/>
  think that ruins the magic.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve always wondered what people think little kids in families where the<br/>
  parents can&#39;t afford toys or are too drunk to remember it&#39;s Christmas must<br/>
  think, when they don&#39;t get any toys. These kids must suspect they&#39;ve been<br/>
  bad, right? What do the good kids in the middle class families think of the<br/>
  poor kids who get fewer toys than they do? What do the ones who get toys<br/>
  think of the Jewish, Muslim, etc., kids who don&#39;t get a visit from Santa?<br/>
<br/>
  Why do people believe kids have to be bribed into being good? Is that really<br/>
  being good, anyway? Isn&#39;t it being a kind of mercenary?<br/>
<br/>
  On a related note, it eats me up inside to hear people sending their kids<br/>
  off to school, or leaving them at the babysitter&#39;s, with the good old<br/>
  all-purpose admonition, &quot;Be good, now.&quot; It&#39;s kind of a useless thing to say,<br/>
  isn&#39;t it? Awfully vague. I prefer specifics.<br/>

all the &quot;imaginary&quot; things out there that I can enjoy and sometimes hide<br/>
behind.  I like to<br/>
&quot;play&quot; Santa.  How could I play Santa if everyone runs around saying Santa<br/>
doesn&#39;t exist???  We find families to help every year.  We don&#39;t want their<br/>
thanks, so we send everything from &quot;Santa.&quot;  We do it because we enjoy it.<br/>
This year we adopted 3 elders and a family of 4.  How sad if they didn&#39;t<br/>
believe in Santa!  Hey, bet they do now &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If Santa and anonymous giving are what its all about, then I&#39;m not going to<br/>
play &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; My husband sent this to me today, after I sent him one of the Santa posts.<br/>
He<br/>
&gt; and I went a few rounds on this when we  first met. . . I have come to see<br/>
&gt; his side of it. He asked me if it was too harsh. . .I said, you are<br/>
&gt; passionate about it. . . nothing harsh about that. . . anyway, here it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; Every year there seems to be a debate on whether/when to tell children<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; Santa Clause does not exist. What an asinine debate. For those who are to<br/>
&gt; small minded not to see Santa Clause as he is, you deserve not to believe.<br/>
&gt; Belief in Santa is a right that all children, of any age, have. How dare<br/>
&gt; any of you try to tell me that there is no Santa. I&#39;m 32 years old and<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; known Santa since I was 6 months old. I was one of those lucky children to<br/>
&gt; have his picture in the paper sitting on Santa&#39;s lap. I defended him<br/>
&gt; throughout my junior/senior high school years when my other friends fell<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; the wayside. And yes, he still visits my house every December. Santa<br/>
&gt; Clause is more than a man in a red suit. He is the spirit of Christmas. He<br/>
&gt; is giving to children everywhere, without ever asking anything in return.<br/>
&gt; He is joy. He is charity. He is love. He is Christmas!!!! Those of you<br/>
&gt; who deny his existence, deny Christmas exists as anything other than any<br/>
&gt; other day. You deny that Christmas is special and unique. If you feel that<br/>
&gt; way about Christmas, you have my pity. As for myself, I look forward to<br/>
&gt; Santa&#39;s visit next Monday night/Tuesday morning. Have a happy holiday<br/>
&gt; season.<br/>
