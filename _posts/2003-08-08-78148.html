<div id="ygrps-yiv-57385936">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would enlist some help here. Today while the kids were swimming, I fished something out of the pool. It is kind of worm like and kind of snake like too. Very thin, about 3 inches long, black all over, it slithers like a snake but doesn&#39;t have a head like one. The head is more worm like but pretty much uniform in size the whole length of the body except at the very tip of the tail where it narrows. Joseph wants to really keep it and find out what it is. I&#39;ve been all over google with no luck. We&#39;d like to know what it eats. Knowing what it is would help. If anyone as any idea or wants to see it, it&#39;s the 2nd to last pic on this page. (like you wouldn&#39;t know the other pictures weren&#39;t the worm/snake!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did read on that site that they are apparently a big thing in the pet <br/>
store/trade so it&#39;s possible that someone let one/some go in the area.  <br/>
They are amphibians and could have &quot;escaped&quot; and found some water.  They <br/>
can reproduce on their own and are a freshwater species -- it could be <br/>
easy for a body of water to have a population of them even though they <br/>
may not be natives.  Who knows?  LOL<br/>

&lt;&lt; Could they be blackworms? Three inches sounds big for a blackworm, but I<br/>
 know they grow larger in the wild. You can buy them at some pet stores to<br/>
 feed fish.<br/>
<br/>
 And we have a big fat cat who looks like a much larger version of your<br/>
 kitten, with the same markings and everything..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure really. They kind of look like it from the picture. Do you know<br/>
if these worms live in water? The thing we found was swimming in the pool,<br/>
but we have him in a tank now with some gravel and a dish of water and he&#39;s<br/>
staying out of the water and half buried in the rock. I put him in some sand<br/>
and he didn&#39;t burrow at all. I certainly won&#39;t feed him to our fish, Joseph<br/>
thinks he&#39;s cute!! Wants to keep him if we can figure out what he&#39;ll eat.<br/>
I&#39;ll have to do some more digging now that I have something else to go on<br/>
besides worm/snake!!!!<br/>
<br/>
And as far as the kitten goes, give me some time and I&#39;ll fatten him up too.<br/>
I have that knack with anything that has fur on it. The big red one in the<br/>
picture weighs 19 lbs.<br/>

I saw the picture of your snake, it looks like a blind snake. Where are you<br/>
located? Brahminy blindsnakes are found in a lot of places, including<br/>
Mexico, Central America, Australia, Asia and Africa. They aren&#39;t venomous,<br/>
so nothing to worry about there. Do you have a close up of the snake&#39;s head?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153336621">Thanks for trying to help. We&#39;re in south Florida. The worm/snake isn&#39;t<br/>
slimy at all. And even though he was in our pool, he prefers driy land.<br/>
Joseph decided to let him to go today. He hates the idea of something dying<br/>
that he would keep just to keep it. So he set him free under the big jasmine<br/>
bush by the pool. The bugs and worms and snakes and snails seem to really<br/>
like that spot. Thanks anyway. Joseph is happy to know whenever he swims he<br/>
can look at the jasmine bush and know his little worm/snake is there<br/>
watching! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
