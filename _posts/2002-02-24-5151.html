I just read your article in HEM and I&#39;m still smiling.   It made me think<br/>
so much about Dylan and his view of things.  I see this in him, too.  I<br/>
think it&#39;s wonderful and maybe the real true evidence that unschooling is<br/>
right is that these kids are so right.   <br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours came over a few nights ago all aflutter because she&#39;d<br/>
been out to dinner and into the restaurant came one of our senators.  She<br/>
said he was so nice and talked so friendly to everyone.  It&#39;s election<br/>
year, you understand.  Dylan just said  &quot;Well, isn&#39;t he supposed to be<br/>
nice?  He works for you.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I like your little Holly.  <br/>

Thanks.  <br/>

My first response is indignation (which then melts into jealousy that she&#39;s <br/>
so matter-of-fact.  But cool stuff in her life IS, literally, a simple matter <br/>
of fact. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned that my friend Mark used to be told (meanly) &quot;You are *so* FULL <br/>
of yourself.&quot;   What I heard from my mom and grandmother was &quot;Oh, you think <br/>
you are SO smart&quot; and &quot;You maybe have booksmarts but you ain&#39;t got no horse <br/>
sense,&quot; or &quot;You don&#39;t have the common sense God gave a [I forget what <br/>
now--]...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly is quite unaccustomed to insult.  Good for her!!<br/>

I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one that feels a bit jealous of my kids.  <br/>
The more I learn about how life for kids is supposed to be, the more <br/>
resentful I get about the childhood I got.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this is just a passing phase for me.  But sheesh, it would <br/>
sure be nice to not have that inner struggle.  It would sure be nice <br/>
just to be happy because I am entitled to a happy life.  Everyone is.<br/>
<br/>
Slightly off topic -<br/>
<br/>
I still keep finding little areas in which I have been controlling my <br/>
kids.  The other day I realized I had been controlling soda.  We <br/>
don&#39;t buy soda except for special occasions because *I* think it is a <br/>
waste of money and empty calories.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I asked the girls if they wanted to do a measuring game <br/>
using soda.  They said sure and then kept bugging me to do it and <br/>
saying &quot;can we get the soda now, can we get the soda now?&quot;  And there <br/>
I was, telling them no, wait until I&#39;m ready.<br/>
<br/>
Then it hit me like a ton of bricks.  Oh my God, I&#39;ve been doing it <br/>
with soda too!  I asked Allison if she felt I had been controlling <br/>
her soda intake and of course she said yes.  So now they can drink as <br/>
much soda as they want.<br/>
<br/>
What else am I still controlling?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to keep whining to you guys about my problems but all this <br/>
stuff makes me feel like crying.  It is so hard to make all these <br/>
changes even though I know it is for the best.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I succeeded academically (and exceeded my parent&#39;s accomplishments)<br/>
I was told &quot;You can buy her books and send her to school but she still<br/>
doesn&#39;t have enough sense to come in out of the rain.&quot;  And they wonder<br/>
why I moved 2000+ miles away and don&#39;t make much effort to maintain ties<br/>
with them.  The last time my father said that to me I was in my 30s.<br/>
<br/>
My young children will never hear such things from them.  This summer<br/>
we saw my parents and my father noticed that Alex is left-handed.  He usually<br/>
has something derogatory to say about that in others.  I felt the mama bear<br/>
in me start to awaken and I guess he did too, since he looked over at me<br/>
and said like &quot;that&#39;s okay&quot;.<br/>
