<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296589004">Hi all -<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re unschoolers in California and are possibly relocating to <br/>
Colorado.  Does anyone have any info or first-hand experience about <br/>
unschooling/laws in Colorado?  In particular, I&#39;m concerned about <br/>
the state mandated testing.  There is none of that here in CA.  Any <br/>
no-test laws in the works of being passed in Colorado?!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input - Susan</div>

 </span></blockquote>We just had a discussion about this on a Colorado hs yahoo group that you might like to check out:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EHCO/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EHCO/</a>  The subject line was &quot;I&#39;m scared&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Testing or evaluations are required every other year starting &quot;third grade&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Options besides testing are evaluations by a &quot;qualified person&quot; - CO licensed teacher, a teacher employed by an independent or parochial school, a licensed psychologist, or a person with a graduate degree in education; or signing up with an umbrella school.<br/>
<br/>
It really is quite easy.  The liaison of school district that I happen to be in is incredibly supportive of homeschooling.  The licensed psychologist that I used for my dd&#39;s evaluation was respectful and very supportive of unschooling.  All he did was read over my notes that I had kept for most of the year and wrote a few sentences stating that dd was progressing according to her age.<br/>
<br/>
Among the families in our unschooling group, a few know licensed teachers, who are willing to sign off for our future evaluations.  So we won&#39;t have to pay the costs of a licensed psychologist.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not that I know of, but I don&#39;t keep abreast of those things.  You could google for that information.  Some of the religious hs groups may know more, try this... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chec.org/Legislative/Current/State.html">http://www.chec.org/Legislative/Current/State.html</a><br/>

Good luck on your possible move.  If you do, where are you planning to move?  Also, my dd wants to know the ages of your kids and if they are boys or girls.  Always looking for more hsers!<br/>
