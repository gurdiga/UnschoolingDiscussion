&lt;&lt; To me, it seemed to be a determination from all<br/>
 involved, from the very beginning, to be RIGHT. Or to<br/>
 argue for the sake of argument.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     I don&#39;t know Sandra or Lynda but I believe that they, like myself, were <br/>
sincerely presenting their views on the issues being discussed.  Sometimes <br/>
disagreements can seem pretty heated but I believe the key to keeping it at a <br/>
decent level is to not resort to personal attacks.  As much as we may <br/>
disagree with someone on an issue, I think it is wrong to make statements <br/>
about her/him as a person, as in &quot;You must be really insecure, selfish, <br/>
ignorant, negative, etc....&quot;  I believe it is better to presume that the <br/>
person has a good motive just as we want that same presumption made about us <br/>
when we speak up about our beliefs.  <br/>

I agree with what you write here, Lucy, but -- and this has been my sticking <br/>
point in these debate/discussions before -- the TONE can be unfriendly, <br/>
supercilious, condescending, sarcastic -- without ever actually stooping to <br/>
personal attacks, although those occur as well. I&#39;m mystified when people <br/>
claim that they can&#39;t see this happening in one of these discussions. Really? <br/>
Without out-and-out name-calling and mudslinging you can&#39;t see the lack of <br/>
respect? The absence of love?<br/>
<br/>
However, I have FINALLY learned that this type of discussion can be really <br/>
fulfilling and mind-expanding for some people. And who am I to deny them <br/>
their fun? I can skim. I can delete.<br/>
<br/>
I got Sandra&#39;s point right away and didn&#39;t have a problem with the example <br/>
she used to make it. I stuck around to see if someone would spell leech <br/>
correctly. (I mean maybe it started out  &quot;leech&quot; and morphed into &quot;leach&quot; <br/>
later in the discussion. Why did it start to bug me so much?)  Molliere was <br/>
news to me. And I promptly forgot how to spell it. :(<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re all wonderful, powerful, strong, opinion-sharing women. (Except I <br/>
guess now I stand out as the suck-up.) I feel like pale pastel next to all <br/>
the crimson and saffron and fuchsia and rich chocolate brown and ...<br/>
<br/>
But I digress ...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     Laura, I don&#39;t at all see you as the suck-up!  Sometimes, I myself <br/>
wonder if I&#39;m coming across that way.  We all have things we feel strongly <br/>
about and believe in passionately, whether they be unschooling, the <br/>
environment, keeping a positive tone, attachment parenting, etc....I always <br/>
find that it is hard to find the right balance between being serene, loving, <br/>
peaceful, etc. and having the courage of my convictions, standing up for what <br/>
I believe is right, and so on.<br/>
     I don&#39;t know if you will be familiar with these two women, especially <br/>
the second, but a major part of me wants to be like Marmie in Little Women <br/>
and another part of me wants to be like Joan Baez, the 60s (and onward) folk <br/>
protest singer who marched with Martin Luther King and has spoken out very <br/>
strongly on her beliefs.  I try to figure out what it means to be tolerant of <br/>
other views and how far that goes and how to balance that with honesty and <br/>
courage.  To me, it isn&#39;t at all easy and I am always looking for better ways <br/>
for myself.<br/>
     It is true that debates often become too sarcastic and angry.  I think <br/>
the only way to try to keep this from happening is to keep reminding <br/>
ourselves that the other person&#39;s motive is most likely good and that we <br/>
don&#39;t want to personally wound them, even as we debate the subject at hand <br/>
vigorously if we are so inclined.<br/>
     Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this, Laura....<br/>
