daughter is training her dog right now, and she also works at a dog training <br/>
place. There is no deprivation of food at all. Seems its used either as a <br/>
snack or sometimes I have seen her training Zoe at night with a lot of food <br/>
and then she doesnt feed her supper. Sometimes she just uses her actual food <br/>
instead of treats. . . it works really well. Zoe is amazing at 6 months. . . <br/>
still a puppy but has never chewed anything up in our home.<br/>

<br/>
We have about the smartest, most cooperative dog I&#39;ve ever met and she can <br/>
have all the catfood she can steal.  But we&#39;ve never used food rewards for <br/>
behavior, just positive voice.  <br/>
<br/>
When we trained rats in college, they needed to do the bar-pressing tricks <br/>
because that was the food they were getting.  I&#39;m thinking maybe that&#39;s what <br/>
was meant by the comment above.<br/>
<br/>
And long ago (1970&#39;s) a woman in our town was starving Dobermans to teach <br/>
them to be mean, but she left home for two days and they broke loose and <br/>
attacked (didn&#39;t kill, just chewed off a bit and then were burying) a little <br/>
boy who was 7 or 8 or so.  So it&#39;s not unheard of.  Not smart (neither in her <br/>
case nor in my mother-in-law&#39;s), but not fantasy either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819182966">The vast majority of dog trainers and kennels don&#39;t deprive dogs of anything<br/>
to get them motivated or trained!  The few bad apples out there, the puppy<br/>
mills, etc. might but they don&#39;t get far with it.<br/>
<br/>
We had a kennel and the cooked liver, bacon or cracklings were a treat that<br/>
we took to the dog shows with us.  We didn&#39;t use it all the time for<br/>
training and it wasn&#39;t needed.  Just plain old hugs, scratches behind the<br/>
ears and &quot;whatta good boy/girl you are&quot; was all that was needed for most of<br/>
the four legged kids.  Lots of socialization and free playtime as puppies<br/>
made for smart, emotionally well-balanced companions when they grew up.<br/>
<br/>
And lots of them were indeed individuals.  One Kees bitch preferred the ice<br/>
cubes out of our drinks to the liver.  Go figure &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965716913">Lelia says they use the food to begin with along with LOTS of praise. . . <br/>
constant praise and petting,etc. But the foos helps with training for things <br/>
that are a bit more difficult. . . they use the food, then will back off of <br/>
that gradually. This is what she is interested in doing with her life, and <br/>
she has studied it extensively. . . I am constantly amazed at how much <br/>
knowledge she has amassed in such a short time.<br/>
