<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 8 Jun 2003, at  1:14am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650208584">With all this talk about pets, I had to chime in.  We have a dog and two kittens that arrived about a month ago (they are now probably 8 or 10 weeks old).   All 3 of them think they are my children.  I get such a kick out of it.  They fight over who gets to sit in my lap sometimes (and we&#39;re talking about a golden retriever!).<br/>
<br/>
Well, today my husband walked in the house and told me he had a new patient for me.....a duck. LOL.<br/>
<br/>
The poor thing had been hit by a car, and my husband, ever the mindful hunter of roadkill, stopped to assess the damage, and how recently this duck had been killed (he had something else in mind for the duck until it moved!).<br/>
<br/>
So, he brought it home thinking if we can&#39;t have it for dinner, maybe I can nurse it back to health.<br/>
<br/>
What a cute thing he is too.  He is eating and drinking, and he has good muscle tone.   His legs move fine, and he can bear weight on both, but his balance is off and he does not attempt to fly, yet.<br/>
<br/>
He is definitely better than he was when he first came here.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway....my life&#39;s dream is to have an animal rescue/shelter.  Someday......<br/>
<br/>
Animals *are* so much like children in so many ways.  <br/>

  &gt; If we trust our children to know when and how to acquire knowledge, then a<br/>
  &gt; natural extension of that trust would be understanding that they will care<br/>
  &gt; for their pets and give their love and attention when they want to and<br/>
  need<br/>
  &gt; to.  When the time comes that she is ready to completely care for an<br/>
  animal,<br/>
  &gt; she will do it.  Without pushing and prodding.  Without suggestion.  And<br/>
  &gt; without making promises she isn&#39;t prepared to keep.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I really appreciate your comments.  It certainly is my problem.  The kids<br/>
  are happy with having the pets here when they are interested and paying no<br/>
  attention at other times.  I&#39;m the one who is bothered.  What is the point<br/>
  of having a pet if all we do is give it food?  Why do we have it unless we<br/>
  do want to spend time with it?  I could certainly find other things to keep<br/>
  in the space that is currently occupied by pets and their trappings, not to<br/>
  mention other things to do besides clean cages! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  It relates to parts of the unschooling process that I still haven&#39;t figured<br/>
  out.  There are only so many hours in a day, only so many square feet in a<br/>
  house, and only so much money available.  How do we decide where to allocate<br/>
  those resources to best support our children?<br/>
<br/>
  When a child says they want a pet (or shows an interest in something) do we<br/>
  rush out and get it?  Or do we wait until they&#39;ve indicated that they<br/>
  really, really, really want it?  How can we tell how much they want it?<br/>
  Where is the line between the unschooling parent who supports all the kids&#39;<br/>
  interests and the one who doesn&#39;t do enough?<br/>
<br/>
  I suppose there are no set answers to those questions.  Knowing my children<br/>
  will give me clues.  Still, I could use some guidance from some of you<br/>
  experts out there :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I love ducks!  We had a few once.  And I have a little duck story :o)<br/>
<br/>
At the same time we had gotten some ducklings (4 of them) our cat had <br/>
kittens.  We didn&#39;t want to leave her outside because we frequently have foxes, <br/>
possums, etc. so we moved her and her babies inside the house.  She&#39;s the same cat <br/>
that ate the baby rabbit once, so when we had to leave that day we closed the <br/>
door to the &quot;duck&quot; room, and went off to 4H.  <br/>
<br/>
Well hubby is clueless when it comes to animals, and he left the door open.  <br/>
The ducklings were pretty big by then and they must have jumped out of the <br/>
box, because when we got home, there were only 3 in the box!  We&#39;re thinking, &quot;Oh <br/>
no, Sabrina ate one of the ducks!!&quot;  We looked everywhere for it, couldn&#39;t <br/>
find it, and just figured she&#39;d eaten it.  <br/>
<br/>
I went to check on the kittens, and to my utter shock, the missing duckling <br/>
was lying there asleep with the kittens!  It woke and started peeping...and I <br/>
picked it up and sat it down in my lap.  It immediately got up and ran back to <br/>
the kittens and settled in!  I have a picture of it someplace...<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if it fell from the table and she picked it up, thinking it was one <br/>
of her babies, or if it waddled in there and found the kittens and just <br/>
thought it&#39;d be a nice warm place to nap, or if Sabrina found it and was just <br/>
keeping it around for a snack later!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261949172">OH that is so cute!<br/>
<br/>
I bet the duck waddled over.  They love to sleep in groups to keep warm and comfy.  We had a flock last year.  I LOVE ducks, if only they wouldn&#39;t poop EVERWHERE!<br/>
<br/>
They used to come over to our sliding glass door and hide in a little corner together.  It was cute bec. they had imprinted on us and wanted to come in the house with us.  But the POOP was unreal!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, our resident duck patient is still alive, and flapped his wings today, so I know his wings and legs are ok.  But he is still very off balance.  He can bear weight on both legs but he leans too far to one side.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing his balance problem is the head injury (his face was a bit bloody) or internal injuries (like ribs or something).  Since he has an appropriate fear and eats and drinks, etc.  I am hoping its more internal stuff that will heal over time.  Then we can release him.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Well, today my husband walked in the house and told me he had a new<br/>
patient for me.....a duck. LOL.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I always wanted a duck. A white duck named Lloyd and a sheep named<br/>
Willie. That&#39;s been with me for years. Not use if I&#39;ll get them but it&#39;s<br/>
still my thought!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, he brought it home thinking if we can&#39;t have it for dinner, maybe I<br/>
can nurse it back to health.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And then have it for dinner??????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway....my life&#39;s dream is to have an animal rescue/shelter.<br/>
Someday......&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What a nice thought. I would love to be able to go to the Humane Society and<br/>
bring home all the dogs and cats that I pretty much can tell won&#39;t be<br/>
adopted. If you ever get your shelter, let me know and I&#39;ll help!<br/>
