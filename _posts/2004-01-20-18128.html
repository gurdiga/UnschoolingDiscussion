I recently met a mom who was trying to find books about menstruation that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mention tampons or in any way suggest girls might use them. She was <br/>
considering gluing the pages showing tampon insertion together in the American <br/>
Girls &quot;Care and Keeping of Me&quot; book because she otherwise likes that book. Blew <br/>
me away, to her it went right along with that all natural lifestyle she&#39;s <br/>
chasing after.<br/>
