<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425860952">Hi everyone, I am a new unschooler. My name is Gracie. My son is Michael, he<br/>
is 13. I started homeshooling right after Christmas break as he has a few<br/>
problems. He has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and real bad Anxiety.<br/>
Separation Anxiety???Who knows. But I was just totally exhausted trying to<br/>
get him up in the mornings when he can&#39;t get to sleep by a reasonable time.<br/>
Even with medication. I was also exhausted from getting phone calls every<br/>
day making sure I was going to pick him up right after school. I had already<br/>
moved him out of public school because of his problems, he needed smaller<br/>
class size. Can&#39;t remember much except what is important to him. Also<br/>
repeats a whole lot. Couldn&#39;t focus well somedays because he was repeating<br/>
in his head.<br/>
I started out continuing using the workbooks that the christian school was<br/>
using but again, ran into anxiety issues. If he didn&#39;t want to do it, he<br/>
would just scribble in the pages. If I didn&#39;t sit and go over each of his<br/>
assignments with him as he did them, he would guess at the answers.<br/>
Now the funny thing is that he is really smart. He is well thought of,<br/>
people have a hard time believing that someone so outgoing could suffer with<br/>
Anxiety, but it is chemical. Not emotional.<br/>
So, here we are. I can&#39;t not make him do anything he doesn&#39;t want to do any<br/>
longer. 3 and  a half months of fighting is all I could take.<br/>
So, the question is, how exactlly do I keep records of what he does do?<br/>
Tell me if I am on the right track.<br/>
This week he started using the typing tutor program on my computer and got<br/>
up to 25 wpm on his left hand home keys.<br/>
He read 2 books. One was Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, and the other is Oliver<br/>
Twist. I had him tell me what the story was about and I typed it for him for<br/>
his portfolio, since he fought me on writing it. I typed it word for word<br/>
and encouraged more thought on what happened in the books.<br/>
He played yahtzee with me about 40 times, even played it by himself a whole<br/>
bunch.<br/>
He helped me chop carrotts and potatoes for dinner and is some help(not too<br/>
much) at picking up our home.<br/>
We went to chucky cheese today and had pizza and played games.<br/>
We went to Pier 1 imports and both got a candle.<br/>
We went to the pet store and played with a Bull Mastiff pup. we have two<br/>
pugs at home, it was neat playing with the big one. They say Pugs are the<br/>
toy of the Mastiff.<br/>
I did some research and can&#39;t find where they are related anywhere?<br/>
Anyway do I have the idea???<br/>
Let me know. I love your site Sandra.<br/>
Any other sites would be helpful.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Gracie</div>

Well it sounds like you are off to a great start. Doing what interests you<br/>
both and enjoying it. I think I would check and see about unschoolers in my<br/>
state as far as what is required by law and go from there as to what you<br/>
have to do to fulfill that need. It might not be even as extensive as what<br/>
you are keeping now. Sometimes there are loopholes like joining a private<br/>
school with a homeschool option that can help.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the dog thing, we have a bullmastiff. They are a cross between a<br/>
bulldog and a mastiff, both coming from England. Pugs come from Asia and<br/>
later on, I have read that pugs were crossed with bulldogs to get them<br/>
smaller. But that was after the bullmastiffs. So the bulldogs may have some<br/>
pug in them but bullmastiffs do not. It&#39;s all pretty sketchy really and<br/>
depends on where the info comes from.<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to the list! I have a 7 yo son and began unschooling in <br/>
December.<br/>
<br/>
What state are you living in? You may be doing more than you &quot;have&quot; <br/>
to do. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had him tell me what the story was about and I typed it for him for<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and encouraged more thought on what happened in the books.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does the portfolio require this? (I live in Michigan, and we don&#39;t <br/>
have to satisfy any requirements here, so i am not that familiar with <br/>
what a portfolio should look like.)Maybe it would be better for you <br/>
to just list the books he&#39;s read? Or if you have to include something <br/>
about the books, ask him (during the course of the day)how he liked <br/>
the book, what was interesting about it...more like a conversation <br/>
rather than &quot;writing a report for the portfolio&quot;...i know my son <br/>
would NOT want to sit down and do this formally. Too much like school <br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of your day sounded like fun. I bet your son is so much <br/>
happier now than in school! If you post where you live, other list <br/>
members who live in that state could give insight on requirements.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665316322">&lt;&lt;So, the question is, how exactlly do I keep records of what he does do?<br/>
Tell me if I am on the right track.<br/>
This week he started using the typing tutor program on my computer and got<br/>
up to 25 wpm on his left hand home keys.<br/>
He read 2 books. One was Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, and the other is Oliver<br/>

and encouraged more thought on what happened in the books.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My first suggestion is to ascertain what the law says about portfolio<br/>
reviews in your State and talk to others about what they do. Don&#39;t do more<br/>
than the law decrees for them to see - only do what you are both enjoying.<br/>
Some States have no assessment requirements of any kind, and the hoops are<br/>
administrative. <br/>
What were you trying to do with the book reports? Didn&#39;t you believe that he<br/>
had done the reading? Was he reading these books to please you? Forcing him<br/>
to dictate or even discuss with you what he has read is still being<br/>
schoolish - making it about the report instead of his interest in reading<br/>
whatever he wants, or not reading. <br/>
He needs to deschool. There is a lot on that topic on Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a fairy tale I have been concocting:<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time there was a place where almost all the people lived on a<br/>
train. The train went forward at a great pace and of course stayed on the<br/>
tracks, so the view was the same from all the windows. Most of families<br/>
stayed in the same carriage for the whole journey.<br/>
Some families didn&#39;t care for the train, so they got on their bicycles<br/>
instead. Many of these families followed right beside the train, and pedaled<br/>
as hard as they needed to, to stay with it. Others followed the increasingly<br/>
numerous bike paths that were set up that started at the depot and ended at<br/>
the terminus, but were often more winding and scenic than the train route.<br/>
At some distance from the tracks, was a garden park that was full of<br/>
walkers. The walkers meandered around sometimes, and at other times were<br/>
seen to be walking briskly forward or even jogging. To the astonishment of<br/>
passing cyclists, sometimes walkers in the beautiful garden were seen to be<br/>
lounging around on the grass, or smelling the flowers. As for the people on<br/>
the train, they could barely see the garden, let alone notice the<br/>
inhabitants.<br/>
At the gateway to the garden there was always a gate keeper. People who had<br/>
jumped off the train, as well as the occasional passing cyclist would<br/>
inquire about how to get in, and the gate keeper would smile and say that it<br/>
was a walking park, and the only thing inside was foot traffic. Sometimes<br/>
hostile cyclists would come close to the gate and shout out that the walkers<br/>
weren&#39;t going anywhere and should be cycling also, or try to show off with<br/>
trick riding, but the walkers would always just keep walking, sitting,<br/>
jogging or dancing along, having such a good time that lots of folks<br/>
abandoned their bikes and joined in.<br/>
One day a cyclist arrived at the gate and wanted to go cycling in the park,<br/>
because it looked so beautiful. <br/>
The gate keeper said, &quot;This is a walking park. There are no directions, or<br/>
maps, or paths.&quot;<br/>
The cyclist replied, &quot;But this is a free country and I should be able to<br/>
cycle if I want to.&quot;<br/>
The gate keeper said, &quot;Then go cycle. There are hundreds of bike paths, but<br/>
this is a walking park.&quot;<br/>
The cyclist said, &quot;You can get along so much faster on a bike. There are<br/>
fewer distractions. Biking is better.&quot;<br/>
The gate keeper said, &quot;Biking is not better in a walking park. The people<br/>
who are walking here have agreed that no-one can ride a bike in here. Your<br/>
bike will be perfectly safe outside the gate if you ever want to come out<br/>
and use it.&quot;<br/>
The cyclist went off in a huff, but was back the next day. <br/>
She said, &quot;What if I agree to walk, can I go in and carry my bike?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Walking in the beautiful park is way harder if you are hauling around your<br/>
useless bike.<br/>
