<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716321339">I hang everything, even unmentionable, on the line.  When it rains for days, I&#39;ll use the dryer but recently, when the dryer broke during a 5-day rainy period, I just started hanging things all over the house, ie. the bunk bed, door knobs, shower rods.  I told hubby not to bother fixing it, but he&#39;s the fixerupper, so It&#39;s working again.  That breeze is free and fresh and I hate opening that hot dryer or forgetting it and finding everything wrinkled.  Kandi<br/>

I have not used my dryer for 7 years! I dry the unmentionables (underwear, bras) on a wooden tree in my bedroom.  Everything else goes outside on the line. DH just built me a nice big 50&#39; long laundry line with 4 wires, that&#39;s 200 feet of drying space!  So far, I&#39;ve not had to use all the space, but I most likely will in winter when it takes a longer time to dry clothes.<br/>

There&#39;s nothing like the smell of laundry that has been rained on <br/>
and dried....sweet, fresh, and crisp.  Especially sheets.  I LOVE <br/>
the smell of rain washed and sun dried sheets.  mmmm.....<br/>

If we get lots of rain, I hang the washing in the laundry.  My dh has <br/>
stretched curtain wires from above one door to the other.  (We have 2 <br/>
doors opposite each other and a small laundry room)  I hang the <br/>
washing on these and put the heater in there, open the window <br/>
slightly and close the door.  Washing soon dries - and if you wanted <br/>
a suana, well........<br/>
