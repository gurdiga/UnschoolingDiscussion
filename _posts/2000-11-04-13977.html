<br/>
Yet again a wonderful quote!!! We just love Douglas Adams.  My husband read <br/>
him as a teen and introduced me to him in my 20&#39;s.  What a fantastic author.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994510049">the Guide, as it&#39;s commonly known, started out as a <br/>
radio series, then became books, then on to the telly.  <br/>
Great stuff.  I&#39;ve never heard the radio stuff, but I <br/>
think it can be gotten on tape, not that I&#39;ve tried.  <br/>
Anyway, just to let you all know :-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW,  it&#39;s Bonfire Night over here, and naturally it&#39;s, <br/>
er, persistently raining, that&#39;s the phrase I&#39;m looking <br/>
for, but the girls are having much fun watching all the <br/>
fireworks.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266667308">I once had the whole series of tapes.  You can now get the complete<br/>
collection on CD.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s available through the BBC.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my first introduction to Hitchhiker was through the radio<br/>
programs.  To this day, I like them better than the books.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was a teen, back in the OLD days of computers, 286&#39;s, when they only came with green text, there was a logic, problem solving game based on those books.  It was completely text (not very entertaining for younger kids) but the situations were really tough to solve.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990941942">I remember, when the screens were either green or <br/>
brown,  LOL, we had those on my first job, where I met <br/>
dh, but I digress...  wonder if this game can still be <br/>
got?  (amazingly bad grammar, but I don&#39;t care atm)  <br/>
I&#39;m assuming it would work in DOS?<br/>
