Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an article from the Japanese press that I thought might be of some <br/>
interest.<br/>
<br/>
Especially revealing of the survey&#39;s bias is the mention of students <br/>
dyeing their hair (which Japanese schoolkids tend to think is cool but <br/>
which Japanese educators usually consider a surefire sign of delinquency).<br/>
<br/>
And it is highly debatable, given all the academic and social pressures <br/>
Japanese schoolchildren face from the adult world, that they are <br/>
&quot;satisfied just enjoying their day-to-day lives,&quot; as the quoted official <br/>
suggests.<br/>
<br/>
What the story doesn&#39;t dig into (typical of Japanese newspapers) is the <br/>
&quot;why&quot; behind this phenomenon of students not wanting to study -- and what <br/>
the solutions to the problem might be. But guess we&#39;ll have to wait for <br/>
another &quot;survey&quot; before we get *those* answers! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

POLL SHOWS JAPANESE STUDENTS STUDY LEAST<br/>
<br/>
The Daily Yomiuri - March 18, 2000<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More than 40 percent of high school students surveyed across the country <br/>
do not study outside school, compared to only about 10 percent in the <br/>
United States and China, according to research conducted by the Japan <br/>
Youth Research Institute.<br/>
<br/>
The latest finding may indicate that many Japanese high school students <br/>
lose motivation to study upon completion of school entrance screenings <br/>
and examinations, analysts said.<br/>
<br/>
The comparative study was conducted on about 2,000 middle and high school <br/>
students in each of the three nations from November to December [1999].<br/>
<br/>
A whopping 41.8 percent of Japanese students said they do not spend any <br/>
time studying outside school. According to the survey, only one in three <br/>
high school students in the nation studies outside school for more than <br/>
an hour each day.<br/>
<br/>
A total of 12.6 percent of U.S. high [school] students said they do not <br/>
study outside school, while more than half of all high school students in <br/>
the country said they study more than an hour outside school.<br/>
<br/>
Among Chinese high school students, 8.3 percent said they do not study <br/>
outside school, while more than 80 percent said they study more than an <br/>
hour every day outside class. A total of 29 percent said they spend <br/>
between two and three hours studying each day.<br/>
<br/>
Among Japanese middle school students, 18.4 percent said they do not <br/>
study outside school, and about half said they study more than an hour <br/>
each day.<br/>
<br/>
The research institute also found that 41.3 percent of Japanese high <br/>
school students carry cellular phones to school, a much higher figure <br/>
than in the United States and China, where 12.3 percent and 0.9 percent <br/>
of high school students, respectively, carry such phones to school.<br/>
<br/>
In the survey, Japanese high school students were found most likely to <br/>
dye their hair among each of the three nations, with 42.9 percent of <br/>
female students and 33 percent of male students responding that they <br/>
color their hair. A total of 18.6 percent of female middle school <br/>
students said they dye their hair.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, 36.7 percent of female U.S. high school students and 14.8 <br/>
percent of male students said they dye their hair.<br/>
<br/>
More than 70 percent of all Japanese middle- and high school students <br/>
said they want high-income jobs in the future, the highest figure of the <br/>
three countries.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, about half of all Japanese middle- and high school students <br/>
said they do not want to be promoted to positions that carry heavy <br/>
responsibilities and require high commitment, also the highest figure <br/>
among the three nations.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The futures of Japanese students are decided very early on, and that is <br/>
why they have little aspirations for the future compared with their U.S. <br/>
and Chinese counterparts. Japanese students tend to be satisfied by just <br/>
enjoying their day-to-day lives rather than preparing for the future,&quot; <br/>
said Tamotsu Sengoku, director of the institute.<br/>
