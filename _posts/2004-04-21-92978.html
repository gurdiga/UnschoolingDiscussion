That happened to Cameron. He HATED the computer. Hated typing/keyboarding. <br/>
Dreaded walking into the computer room @ school.<br/>
<br/>
But less than one year out of school, he was, by far, the fastest typist in <br/>
our family. He still is. And he understands how the thing works and why---and <br/>
can fix most of our problems (except the one last week! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I bet there are still kids there who are &#39;puter-avoident. <br/>
<br/>
Damn schools.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have often wondered about that. When I worked at Microsoft, most of <br/>
the people I know started out in computers as self-taught. We were <br/>
the generation whose parents had an Atari or an Apple IIe, or even a <br/>
TRS-80. Everything on computers was learned via Unschooling, in a <br/>
sense, because schools hadn&#39;t yet caught on to it. I wonder, now that <br/>
computers are taught as a subject starting in early gradeschool, if <br/>
the people graduating with computer science degrees in 12 or 15 years <br/>
will have so much less creativity and ability to think outside the <br/>
box with respect to programming, because someone taught them exactly <br/>
how to do it instead of discovering it for themselves. I wonder if <br/>
the U.S. will lose their edge in the computer software industry <br/>
eventually because of this. I think we have had the edge for a long <br/>
time because most of our great programmers were self-taught and <br/>
creative and innovative.<br/>
