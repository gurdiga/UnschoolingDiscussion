<div id="ygrps-yiv-266754650">&quot;Her Rx was 1<br/>
beer or 1 glass of wine and some quiet time with my husband.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had a wine prescription from my midwife also! Dh and I went through<br/>
a difficult separation while I was pregnant with Jalen (youngest<br/>
child, now 5.5) and towards the end of it, I was so stressed out that<br/>
it led to an environmental depression. Given my extreme emotional<br/>
state, she told me to drink a glass of wine &quot;right now&quot; and have a<br/>
glass every night if I needed to. It couldn&#39;t hurt the baby at that<br/>
point and my emotional state was more harmful anyway. I didn&#39;t drink<br/>
every night, but for a couple of days it felt like it saved my life.<br/>
<br/>
His birth was really wonderful, and I have to think the wine did quite<br/>
a bit to help.:)<br/>
