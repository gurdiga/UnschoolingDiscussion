<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277882393"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot;The Burton Bunch&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:livnrway@...">livnrway@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I guess my question here is how to continue helping those just getting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>their feet wet with homeschooling - - letting them know that I unschool, but<br/>
being available to answer other questions too without sounding phony -<br/>
because that is truly how I feel when I talk about using the pre- packaged,<br/>
workbooks, unit studies, etc. .....I struggle with scaring people off before<br/>
they have the chance to experience what I get to everyday.  Any advice?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just tell them &quot;This is what works for me&quot; and maybe explain a little bit<br/>
if they haven&#39;t heard of unschooling before. I also have a good feel for who<br/>
else in our homeschooling group are using different<br/>
methods/classes/curriculum. We have a couple of families of Waldorf-inspired<br/>
homeschoolers, we have a couple that use packaged curriculum, we have many<br/>
that fall into the &quot;eclectic&quot; range, we have a good faction of unschoolers,<br/>
and we have some that use the classes available through our school districts<br/>
here. So I tell people what the range is, and who they can talk to that most<br/>
matches up with what they envision their homeschooling to look like. I do<br/>
this knowing that sooner or later they will most likely drift more and more<br/>
towards unschooling, especially if they start hanging out with our group. I<br/>
see people fall of the the curriculum wagon all the time as they realize how<br/>
much it frustrates themselves and their children. The day that they start<br/>
asking &quot;What&#39;s going wrong? Is there a better way?&quot; then I will give them<br/>
more information on unschooling. I give as much as I think a person can<br/>
assimilate at a time. Sometimes that&#39;s a little, sometimes that&#39;s a lot. Of<br/>
course, if anyone asks me directly what I think, they&#39;ll get an earful!<br/>
