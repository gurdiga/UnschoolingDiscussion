<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920216516"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2" FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Georgia Ref">A friend of mine is helping my youngest daughter with her room. My dd 
<br>generally keeps
<br>just about everything and her stuff has become &nbsp;too much for her. This is the 
<br>project my
<br>friend gave her. &nbsp;She asked her first to write about her room. &nbsp;Next she is 
<br>to pack up
<br>*everything* in her room into boxes. &nbsp;As she does this she can also throw 
<br>things away
<br>and give away. While packing up her things my friend asked her to think about 
<br>keeping
<br>only the things that are worthy of her.
<br>
<br>After she gets it all boxed she is to redesign her room - to create it the 
<br>way she would
<br>like it to be. &nbsp;The final step is to write something about her new room.
<br>
<br>My 11 year old has been working on it some each day for over a week now. 
<br>She has lots of boxes packed and labeled. I think we will be putting alot of 
<br>stuff in the
<br>attic which is a step - she can still keep the things she wants, but have a 
<br>clearer room.
<br>
<br>She seems to be enjoying the project and is thoughtful about what she is 
<br>doing.
<br>I can&#39;t wait to see the finished product.
