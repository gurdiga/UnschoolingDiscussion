&lt;&lt; Wow. I never realized that I only dated band geeks! Interesting.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sister, my only sister, only dates (or at least only really lives with and <br/>
enjoys) crazy Viet Nam vets.  Within the last year she left her husband, who <br/>
was a just-post-war twitchy SEAL sneaking around where we shouldn&#39;t have <br/>
been, for an officially disabled full-on vet.  Before my brother in law, she <br/>
was with another clearly unrecovered vet.  My dad was VERY concerned when my <br/>
15 year old sister was living with a guy who kept guns by the doors and was <br/>
never quite still.  That guy has still been friends of my sister and her <br/>
first/main husband through all those years and is the one who stirred up the <br/>
jealously of crazed-vet #3 which led to the divorce.  (HE wanted to be #2 in <br/>
her attentions; seriously.)<br/>
<br/>
My sister re-married last month.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s very familiar with the VA hospital system and regs and schedules...<br/>
<br/>
None of these guys are musicians.    My sister is, but for some reason she <br/>
picked another pattern.<br/>
<br/>
WEIRD, huh??<br/>

Ellen Goodman just wrote a thought-provoking column titled &quot;Ah, forget<br/>
it -- with the medication of the future.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It starts out with these interesting questions:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Imagine that you have arrived at the emergency room after a horrific<br/>
car crash.  The doctor in charge offers you two pills.  One will relieve<br/>
the inflammation of whiplash.  The other will reduce the psychological<br/>
trauma, muting the nightmarish flashbacks to a manageable memory?<br/>
<br/>
Would you take one?  Would you take both?  Is there any difference?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
&quot;... what about a soldier just back from battle?  Should he be treated<br/>
with medicine that helps dim the effect of the horrors that he has experienced?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are interesting questions.<br/>

treating the psychological symptom too.  They&#39;re both related.  <br/>
