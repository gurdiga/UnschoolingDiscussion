<div id="ygrps-yiv-322028657">I&#39;m new here, so I apologize if this has been discussed before, but  <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if anyone here has read Hold On To Your Kids and what  <br/>
you thought of it?<br/>
I recently sponsored a talk by Dr. Neufeld here in Portland, and in  <br/>
MY mind it goes well with RU and with respectful non-coercive  <br/>
parenting (and the parts that don&#39;t, i just ignore :)), but others in  <br/>
my community had a hard time understanding how his philosophy could  <br/>
be non-coercive when he talked about things like &quot;natural authority&quot;,  <br/>
etc.<br/>
To me, it&#39;s like the modern version of The Continuum Concept - as the  <br/>
parent/tribe leader you have unconditional positive regard and  <br/>
&quot;expectations&quot; and yet are completely non-punitive and loving and  <br/>
available. I think that unschooled kids are generally more family/ <br/>
parent oriented to begin with, so there is no need to set limits  <br/>
around peer over-interaction like I might feel the desire to if my  <br/>
kids were in school.  Neufeld&#39;s book is written within the context of  <br/>
the mainstream Western world (though it questions mainstream  <br/>
parenting) but I think that by reading the book it would be very  <br/>
difficult to interpret adult-oriented as meaning a parent controls or  <br/>
coerces the child.  His point is that through love and attachment the  <br/>
child naturally wants to follow the parent - it cannot be forced.  I  <br/>
love his assertation that we are stressed about parenting because we  <br/>
think we are responsible for raising our children but in fact nature  <br/>
has that role and will do so all by itself if we just fulfill our  <br/>
children&#39;s needs for being dependent on us.  What do you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851524939">I saw him speak - there were lots of things I liked about what he said  <br/>
and a few I didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
But, I honestly sort of begrudge him his &quot;expert&quot; role. He&#39;s selling a  <br/>
lot of stuff - DVD parenting programs that cost a small fortune. I  <br/>
think people can get more from this list - we&#39;re more personal, more  <br/>
direct, and more variety of real experience is available here.<br/>
<br/>
But, people do like to rely on experts - he has a PhD in clinical  <br/>
psychology and &quot;30 years experience&quot; and that seems to give him  <br/>
credibility.<br/>

&quot;Just?&quot; Yeah- well - no. I don&#39;t agree at all.<br/>
<br/>
There are horribly abusive parents whose children are &quot;dependent&quot; on  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Children also have needs for autonomy that are important to support.<br/>
<br/>
Simple statements don&#39;t do justice to all that Neufeld really has to  <br/>
say, of course. But, as far as that statement goes, I don&#39;t like it at  <br/>
all.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Pam.  It&#39;s not at all clear or simple, but every day we  <br/>
help people learn to untangle the threads of their lives, to see  <br/>
clearly why and how to decide what they decide.<br/>
<br/>
We have a friend who&#39;s nearly twenty four and VERY dependent on his  <br/>
parents.  They have always made his decisions, since he was born, and  <br/>
they divorced when he was six, so they&#39;ve used him as a pawn.  When  <br/>
does he start getting his own life?  Maybe soon, but basically  <br/>
they&#39;re supporting him because they&#39;ve forced him (as well as they  <br/>
can) to be in graduate school.   This is not a healthy family (hasn&#39;t  <br/>
been a family for a long time) and not a healthy relationship, no  <br/>
dyad in it.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to be unhealthy is to claim one&#39;s family is totally  <br/>
democratic, equals, all have an equal voice, etc.  That doesn&#39;t make  <br/>
any sense either.   Those who know the most and can do the most need  <br/>
to DO IT!  More like communism, maybe.  Socialism. &lt;bwg&gt;   Those who  <br/>
have the ability to maintain cars and mow lawns and mend clothing  <br/>
really ought to do it cheerfully for the group, for the team!  And  <br/>
those whose abilities are just growing will WANT to do what looks  <br/>
fun, and they will desire to be like the parents, if the parents keep  <br/>
themselves interesting and kind and supportive.<br/>
<br/>
I could say more, and probably will, but I&#39;m trying to do lots of  <br/>
things at once.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so timely for me.  I know a lot of families believe that Consensual<br/>
living combines nicely with Unschooling and I think in a lot of ways it<br/>
does.  However, I don&#39;t think parents and children are on a level playing<br/>
field because adults have the ability to do more than the children.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if it was something that only *I* noticed, but, it seemed to me that<br/>
some parents were using the Consensual living creed that &quot;everyone&#39;s opinion<br/>
matters and everyone&#39;s equal&quot; as an excuse to put limitations on their<br/>
children.  I&#39;ve noticed the TV, computer and food limitations being<br/>
mentioned as something that &quot;mom wants&quot; and so that gets equal value as the<br/>
child that wants to watch TV or eat chocolate.  So as a compromise the child<br/>
would get limited TV or a certain amount of the food they wanted.  It felt<br/>
really yucky to me to read.  I actually went no mail on the list because I<br/>
felt reading that would be detrimental to me learning more<br/>
about Unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549801377">I&#39;ve really enjoyed what he has to say, and here&#39;s what I got from his talk in our area last <br/>
month:<br/>
<br/>
I think that he is acknowledging that the relationship is natural that children depend on their <br/>
parents, and that that precious relationship must be carefully and respectfully maintained in <br/>
a connected and positive way--not exploited by an abusive or dysfunctional parent.  A <br/>
parent (or other adult as the case may be) that is in that position must tread very carefully <br/>
and sensitively because they are in a unique position to have even more power to wound than <br/>
anyone else.  That loving bond is what protects children and allows for confident exploring of <br/>
their world as they grow and strengthen their sense of self.<br/>
<br/>
I thought what he had to say was not at odds and blended very well with what people have to <br/>
say on this list.<br/>
