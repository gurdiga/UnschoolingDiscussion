<h4>Mowery Family</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559798639"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;What I do find uncomfrotable, and have just realized, is the underlying<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tone of things being right and wrong. Of terms being picked apart and<br/>
corrected. Of having to choose words too carefully. Reminders of what<br/>
subjects should be and what should not be. Of when to move on or not. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
JMHO, there is no rule about what folks can write about.  As far as I am concerned, we are gaining so much information, that reminders have been suggested to keep us on the original path.  It doesn&#39;t mean, stop talking about it, it is simply one person stating an opinion. =)<br/>
<br/>
Remember to take the tone of what ANYone says with a grain of salt.  Some of the folks on the list are wordy, some direct, some flowery.  Take what you read, put it in your own tone and see if it makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest gift of lists like these with regular, and or controversial, and or well-known within certain circles persons, is that they push us to the edge of our comfort zone with words and phrases and make us think.<br/>
<br/>
Just a regular gal,<br/>
