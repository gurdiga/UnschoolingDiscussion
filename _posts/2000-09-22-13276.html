<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131106379">My first two daughters were vaccinated &quot;on time&quot; up until they were about 6<br/>
yrs. I hate myself for that....I was completely uninformed. Fortunately they<br/>
have never shown signs of a bad reaction. With my 3rd, I started her on the<br/>
regular schedule and then learned all kinds of awful truths about the shots<br/>
(again, fortunately not with her...through reading). My youngest has never<br/>
been vaccinated with anything as of yet and she is 2-1/2.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else find it strange that chickenpox is now considered a<br/>
life-threatening disease which must be avoided at all costs? Remember just<br/>
10 years ago....a child would get chickenpox and other mothers would bring<br/>
their children over purposely to catch it and get it over with? Remember the<br/>
book &quot;Itchy Scritchy Chickenpox&quot;?  It was a joke....everyone got it sooner<br/>
or later, some were really sick with it and some kids didn&#39;t mind at all.<br/>
When one of my kids caught it 7 years ago, the pediatrician&#39;s office was<br/>
more concerned that I was missing an appt for more vaccinations than the<br/>
fact that my just turned one year old was miserably sick. They didn&#39;t even<br/>
offer any suggestions on making her more comfortable. Now there are<br/>
commercials with toys crying for the children who didn&#39;t get vaccinated for<br/>
chickenpox and died. Strange how cavalier the medical community was about it<br/>
before the vaccine, isn&#39;t it? Now it&#39;s life-threatening.<br/>
<br/>
When the MMR was first introduced in Japan (not too long ago), autism for<br/>
the vaccinated age group went up 500%. But here they only want to spread out<br/>
the shots, not discontinue them...and they think spreading them out is<br/>
radical.<br/>
<br/>
I should have known vaccinations were a bad idea....I got hard measles from<br/>
the shot when I was 6. I still have the scar. If I could do it over again, I<br/>
would vaccinate only for tetanus.<br/>

I thought of that, but then it occored to me that it&#39;s only going to be a<br/>
few more years before the first groups of kids that recieved it will need<br/>

older they get the worse they get them.  My brother got them when <br/>
he was 11.  Managed to not be able to be infected until then.  He <br/>
had them in his ears, eyes, as well as internally (urinary tract, <br/>
mouth, throat, stomach, rectum)  He is lucky that he did get over <br/>
them without any major complications.  Chicken Pox in men can <br/>
cause sterility.<br/>
<br/>
As for being revaccinated, yes; it will happen.  Just like people <br/>
revaccinate for other diseases too.  Our school system is going to <br/>
insist on vaccination for varicella starting next school year, which <br/>
means that records are going to be reviewed and reminders sent <br/>
home like they are with measles.  If a parent is going to commit to <br/>
the immunization then they need to commit to it and not put their <br/>
child at risk as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
Studies coming out of Japan have proven at least 12 years of <br/>
protection and for some 15.  It is recommended to get a booster <br/>
every 12 years.  Japan has been using this vaccine for a lot longer <br/>
than we have and with great success.<br/>

Hi Cath<br/>
<br/>
No I don&#39;t live in Japan. I read that in a Mothering magazine news brief and<br/>
in the newspaper about two years ago.<br/>
Hey, I have a sister who lives in Japan off and on also. Near Chiba. I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-650544577">Hi ,<br/>
 I just wanted to say somethig.My dd was vacc. Iguess I never really realized <br/>
the big pic about vacinations. ( guess I have some reading to do) Anyway <br/>
about the chicken pox.. My dd has been exposed to so many children with the <br/>
chix pox but has never had them . My mom thinks I should get her the shot now <br/>
because they say it is better to get them when you are young. DD will be 10 <br/>
in July. My sister was 9 when she got them too and she had it bad. My older <br/>
brother had them when he was 32 and he had it real bad. My other sister and I <br/>
both had them when we were 2 and 3 so I guess they were just the normal chix <br/>
pox cases. The shot for chix pox wasnt out when my sister and brother got <br/>
them (they got them together, cute huh) I almost did it last year because mil <br/>
was on my back because she had just taken my niece to get the shot and she <br/>
wanted me to go with her......!   She asked me why I wouldnt do it . I told <br/>
her that as far as I knew the shot was relatively new around where we are and <br/>
they werent using my daughter as a quinea pig. She didnt  talk to me for <br/>
weeks and she got the shot. Any I was  just curious. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692237758">The fear of chicken pox in older children causing horrible, ghastly, life<br/>
threatening problems is a drug company/CDC scare tactic that makes folks<br/>
run out and get the vaccinations.  The vaccines don&#39;t last!  It was clearly<br/>
proven two years ago here in CA when there was an epidemic of whooping<br/>
cough in jr. high and high school students.  Over 90% of those that got it<br/>
had been good little soldiers marched off to get all their immunizations<br/>
and boosters.  Eldest son ran around with some of these kids and he didn&#39;t<br/>
have the shots and he didn&#39;t get whooping cough!<br/>

the DR if possibly the vaccine was changing the nature of the illness, she<br/>
just gave me a weird look.  She gave us the CP dx but said she had only seen<br/>
cases that mild in vaccinated children. My son was definitely exposed a<br/>
second time (rolling around with contagious child for 2 hours) but never got<br/>
ill, so we assume he did have it the 1st time.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that some children may have been exposed & developed immunity<br/>
without the parents even realizing it,  a simple blood test can tell if an<br/>
older child should even get the vaccine if you&#39;re considering it.  And  CP<br/>
is still running wild thru school & other groups of children, it may not be<br/>
that hard to pick up natural immunity after all.  Of course who knows what<br/>
effect the vaccine has had on the virus, could it be possible that there are<br/>
now 2 strains- I&#39;m only throwing out ideas, it just seems that the<br/>
authorities really don&#39;t know all the implications of these vaccines.<br/>

they could have one of these predisposing conditions. (Even one as seemling<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128120291">CDC has several sites and you have to go from list to another list to the<br/>
charts and they refer you back to something else.  About two years ago I<br/>
spent about a week going through all the sites because of the push for Hep<br/>
B.  Then I went to the WHO&#39;s site and then took all the info from the no<br/>
vaccines lists (which I verified).  It was quite an interesting trip,<br/>
particularly as some of the sites that are supposed to be &quot;medical&quot; and<br/>
&quot;science&quot; and unbiased (yeah right) sites were being paid for by the drug<br/>
companies.<br/>
<br/>
The handouts that are suppose to tell you the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of Hep B are<br/>
produced by the drug company to be handed out by the doctors.  I mean,<br/>
really now, like they would tell folks not to use the vaccine?  The same is<br/>
true for all the cp and mmr vaccines and the literature you get on them.<br/>

In my opinion, that is a great idea.  I will never do any procedure, or have <br/>
anything injected into me or my family until the procedure is at least 15 <br/>
years old.  The side affects of anything is never found until between 10 and <br/>
15 years and I wouldn&#39;t trust the 10yr findings.  They are just beginning to <br/>
find problems from laser eye surgery, and that started around 15 years ago <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675641377">In the US, Reyes is commonly associated with giving aspirin to children<br/>
during viral infections, and parents are advised to use acetaminophen or<br/>
ibuprofen instead. In other countries, acetaminophen or ibuprofen have been<br/>
thought to cause the problems.<br/>
<br/>
The US decrease in rates of Reyes syndrome have been said to be due to<br/>
increased use of acetaminophen for children instead of aspirin. Other<br/>
countries have seen similar decreases in Reyes rates despite relying almost<br/>
completely on aspirin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889223751">Okay, I have this great vaccine I can give you. Less than 1 in 100,000<br/>
people who receive the vaccine will die, so it is very safe and it offers<br/>
some great protection. If you take it, you will be 1/10 as likely to die<br/>
from nastyviroimmunogobbledygook.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a great deal. Everybody should get this vaccine. What if I told<br/>
you that your chance of dying from nastyviroimmunogobbledygook is only 10 in<br/>
1,000,000. Take this lovely vaccine (did I mention possible side effects of<br/>
fever, rash, vomiting?) and the mortality rate drops to 1 in 1,000,000.<br/>
Still sound like a great deal?<br/>
<br/>
Even Doctors often only have statistics presented in the first format, not<br/>
raw numbers that can help them make more meaningful decisions.<br/>
