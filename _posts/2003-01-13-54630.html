 And I figured that 25 x 40 is 1000 square feet. 3 square feet in a bag. <br/>
 3/1000 is 33---plus a couple, just in case! &lt;G&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

Sounds like what I would have done too Kelly!! But square feet are not cubed <br/>
feet.....therein lies the prolem!<br/>

changing both to 1&#39; depth (slicing the cubic yard into 1&#39; slices since<br/>
that&#39;s the depth of the play area) then it can be treated as having only 2<br/>
factors: width and length.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862374080">Joyce suggested breaking down the play area so that you could &quot;see&quot; the<br/>
problem better.  Someone had mentioned &quot;slicing&quot; the cube.  Both of these<br/>
might help to visually get a feel of what is happening.<br/>
<br/>
I often use &#39;real&#39; objects to be models and then play with the shape or<br/>
figure I&#39;m trying to understand. Last year I built a tetrahedron out of<br/>
toothpicks to try and understand some number concepts.  Imagine what a<br/>
&#39;cubic yard&#39; really is - it&#39;s a cube (3-D square) that&#39;s a yard on every<br/>
side.  If you want to change the measurement to feet, then you have to think<br/>
about, picture, and make a model of what that will mean.  How many cubic<br/>
feet in the cubic yard?  Start with what you know - 3 feet in one yard.  Now<br/>
that cubic yard has three feet going up, across, and back (deep).  Get out<br/>
some cubes (blocks or dice) and say that each one is a &#39;cubic foot.&#39;  Now<br/>
build your &#39;cubic yard&#39; and count how many blocks it took.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I use the &#39;multiplication table&#39; with people (A lot of<br/>
homeschoolers ask for help on teaching multiplication facts) I show them how<br/>
the numbers form patterns, across, vertically, and diagonally.  The main<br/>
diagonal, down the middle, is the &#39;square numbers.&#39;  It&#39;s easier for most<br/>
people to understand cube numbers after they &#39;see&#39; what square numbers are<br/>
and how they are formed.  Once someone understands what they are seeing,<br/>
whether it is a layer of mulch 1 foot thick, or a model either in their head<br/>
or physical, then they can understand how to manipulate the formulae and the<br/>
numbers.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yos doesn&#39;t like or &#39;get&#39; math very easily - it&#39;s not &#39;natural&#39; for<br/>
him.  One day I asked him if he wanted to learn some and he told me he&#39;ll do<br/>
it when he needs it. This is the boy who could not spell or write much last<br/>
year but has dictated stories to us since he was 6 (didn&#39;t read until 8<br/>
1/2).  He still hates physically writing,  uses block letters, but now<br/>
because he uses IM all the time with his friends, because HE doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
be embarrassed, he has learned to spell, and type much faster than I can.<br/>
At first he asked me or his 20yos how to spell words, and still asks<br/>
sometimes, but he has been using the dictionary too.  I wonder what the<br/>
words are that he doesn&#39;t ask? LOL<br/>
<br/>
My 8yos, not reading, cares a little but not much, will do it when he wants<br/>
to, is a math whiz.  This kid thinks in math terms.  At about age 6 he saw<br/>
the word &#39;yellow&#39; and I asked him what it said (yes, I did try and see if he<br/>
would read early - no go!).  He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know any of the letters, but<br/>
why does it have 110 in the middle?&quot;  That same year he told me, after<br/>
buying a sub at Subway, which he was to share with his older brother,  &quot;Mom,<br/>
they cut it 50-50, but I think 75-25 would be better.&quot;  Me: &quot;75 pieces?&quot;<br/>
Him:  &quot;No, like quarters, you know.  I get three and James gets one.<br/>
Quarters. &lt;big laugh&gt;&quot;<br/>
He likes me to make up problems for him (maybe every two weeks, for 2 -3<br/>
days in a row).  I can say them or write them down, but he does almost all<br/>
of it in his head.  He likes large numbers (ten thousands or higher) to<br/>
figure percentages, and wants two variable algebra problems, cuz just<br/>
finding &#39;x&#39; is &quot;too easy.&quot;  He has workbooks available, but hates them, so<br/>
he never uses them.  He likes &quot;Mom&#39;s problems.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They ask when they want to know, and learn it when they need it.<br/>

But three squ. feet wouldn&#39;t change the fact that with 12 inches of depth <br/>
you&#39;d have cubed feet, not square feet.<br/>
It would be 3x3x1 in that case.<br/>
The easiest way to determine how many cubic yards you&#39;d need (at least in my <br/>
opinion) is to convert all of your area to inches. So 25x40x12 would look <br/>
like 300x480x12<br/>
And then divide that by a sqare yard converted to inches 36x36x36 , So you&#39;d <br/>
multiply the three figures together to get your total area cubed.<br/>
So you&#39;d have 144,000 cubed inches divided by 46,656 to get 3.08, or just <br/>
barely over three cubic yards to cover the area 12 inches deep.<br/>
So three yards would do it!!<br/>
