<div id="ygrps-yiv-452566537">&quot;The kind of learning unschooled kids do doesn&#39;t always, and maybe never<br/>
looks like what&#39;s happening to schooled kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is so true.  The other night I was at my covenant group at church <br/>
and one of our members hadn&#39;t been able to come, but at the end saw <br/>
that we were still there when she drove by and stood outside looking in <br/>
for a bit.  When she got to the circle (after about 15 min.) she said, <br/>
&quot;You know, a covenant group doesn&#39;t look like ANYTHING from outside.  <br/>
It looks like you are all just sitting there doing nothing.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
even look like anyone is talking.&quot;  Well, a covenant group is a way to <br/>
deeply connect with others - with very intentional listening happening <br/>
when anyone is talking.  It is a most rewarding experience for all <br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
So it is with unschooling.  I think unschooling is a way for the child <br/>
and the family to deeply connect with themselves.  I guess deeply <br/>
connecting and being &quot;rich in thought&quot; doesn&#39;t look like anything from <br/>
the outside.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean we shouldn&#39;t live in a way that is rich and deep for <br/>
ourselves because it doesn&#39;t look like we are doing anything from the <br/>
outside?<br/>
<br/>
Of course not!  Who cares what it looks like from the outside?<br/>

From last Friday morning to yesterday latea fternoon, Marty and I spent three <br/>
days together.  Glorious days.   But Marty won&#39;t write a report, and so from <br/>
school-angle it will look like we spent two nights in motels, ate out, <br/>
wandered around some little towns, and came home.  Nothing academic happened.  It was <br/>
&quot;just a field trip&quot; at the very most, schoolishly speaking.<br/>
