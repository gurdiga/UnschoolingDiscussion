<div id="ygrps-yiv-867922026">I have a really great Mom and son that started homeschooling this last year that are part of our support group.<br/>
Right now, her ex is giving her all sorts of hell about it and they&#39;re probably going to end up in court.  Her ds was in a living hell while in school, and so much happier now, she&#39;ll do anything to protect him from that. <br/>
I can&#39;t give her a whole lot of advice,not having been in the situation myself. I only know the laws here, but not how they apply in a case like this. They have shared custody, but she has the bulk of the law on her side, I believe she&#39;s listed as the primary guardian (or however they word it).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, if anyone that has dealt with this type of thing feels inclined to offer some support or advice, I&#39;d really appreciate it. She&#39;s really stressed out.<br/>
Email me and I&#39;ll forward it to her....<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starsuncloud@...">starsuncloud@...</a></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003335434">I&#39;m divorced but have sole custody of my kids so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s<br/>
the same thing. I wouldn&#39;t think there would be a problem as long as<br/>
your df is following the hs laws in your state. Is there a legal<br/>
hotline or legal aid or even a law school nearby that could check on<br/>
her rights more? <br/>
<br/>
I wish her well.<br/>
