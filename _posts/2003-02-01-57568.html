<div id="ygrps-yiv-79127520">I had an interesting conversation today with a co-worker.<br/>
She and I are worlds apart in almost every philosophy and belief anyway (she <br/>
thinks guns should be illegal for all but government and police etc...) and <br/>
today she tells me she thinks homeschooling should not be allowed.<br/>
She had the usual socialization crap and so on...]<br/>
But the misinformation spewing forth is what caught me off guard. Not just <br/>
some little stuff, but things like suicidal teens are often homeschooled at <br/>
younger ages. <br/>
I asked for the proof, the study that showed it. Her Phsyche professor is <br/>
supposedly working on a paper now and will publish it (good luck on that one) <br/>
HA!<br/>
Apparently she&#39;s taken a bunch of psychology and must have had a biased <br/>
professor.<br/>
Because I know plenty of psychologists that believe in child led learning...<br/>
not that I care what any &quot;experts&quot; believe anyway.<br/>
She claims that she could pick out the homeschoolers everytime up in OKC <br/>
because they were &quot;different&quot; and didn&#39;t have good social skills yada, yada, <br/>
yada...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway....it was amazing the amount of venom and lies spewing forth, I am <br/>
just SO glad to be home for lunch break and be able to log on for a dose of <br/>
sanity.<br/>
I&#39;d love to get into it with her big time, but work just ain&#39;t the place.<br/>
I gave the usual answers and let it go.<br/>
I also told her that she&#39;ll never produce convincing studies to prove that <br/>
homeschoolers are poorly socialized. She thinks she can. BARF!!<br/>

to be finished, like &quot;good&quot; little children, affraid to speak because of the <br/>
punishment.  They actually have a thought.  Want to engage someone in <br/>
conversation.  I think homeschoolers, especially unschoolers, are easy to <br/>
spot (most of the time).  They are so engaging.  So conversational. <br/>
<br/>
 I think that all depends on what &quot;social skills&quot; you think are &quot;good&quot;.  <br/>
Don&#39;t you hate that...<br/>

Find the right group of homeschoolers and she could be right.  My <br/>
daughter got a little taste of that at a certain camp this summer, <br/>
with lots of really alienated and severely depressed homeschooled <br/>
teens.  Not all, but the majority.  Definitely a real eye opener for <br/>
her.  Not one that I was real excited to hear about.  So, had this <br/>
psychologist been affiliated with this particular camp s/he could <br/>
have easily come away with that impression.  <br/>
<br/>
However, until this camp that has not been our experience at all.  As <br/>
a matter of fact we keep hearing over and over again, from all kinds <br/>
of folks, how wonderful our homeschool kids are.  The ski instructor <br/>
just this past week had nothing but praise for our group of <br/>
homeschool kids who had been taking group lessons for the past 4 <br/>
weeks.  He liked them so much that instead of the usual 1/2 hour <br/>
lesson he gave them one hour or longer lessons each week. And I&#39;ve <br/>
heard this forever in all kinds of different situations.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, when I go off to substitute teach in the public schools I see <br/>
lots of things that the parents of these kids would never want to <br/>
hear about, to know about.  I think every parent of a brick and <br/>
mortar schooled kid should have to substitute teach for one year, in <br/>
all different schools, just to see what really goes on in these <br/>
institutions.  It would be a real eye opener for them.  Unless, of <br/>
course, they go in with blinders on.  <br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, too, the parents of the severely alienated and depressed <br/>
group did not want to hear about that either, got very defensive at <br/>
the slightest insinuation that things were not handled responsibly at <br/>
this camp.  Oh, well.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-111856636">I&#39;m curious as to in what way these teens were alienated and how these <br/>
kids expressed that they were severly depressed.<br/>
<br/>
Can you elaborate more on this?  Did it have anything to do with the <br/>
camp (was this camp for a particular group of people?) or was it that <br/>
they all coincidentally were at this camp but their home lives were <br/>
less than satisfying?<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me offlist if you like.  I&#39;m looking at different <br/>
camps for my kids and would like to hear more about this if you don&#39;t <br/>
mind. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Yep, exactly.<br/>
And she&#39;s never met any of my kids but others at work have and raved about <br/>
how Trevor was NOT like other teens (so maybe different is good and she can&#39;t <br/>
see that?)<br/>
because he can carry on a conversation about, well...anything! And he&#39;s <br/>
personable and fun and funny.<br/>
Whatever.<br/>
I had to really laugh about her thinking she can pick out the homeschooled <br/>
kids, I need to ask her if she can pick out the homeschooled people we work <br/>
with!!<br/>
There are two homeschooled adults there that I know of personally.<br/>
I informed the girl that works in the Juniors department to watch out, cuz <br/>
someone at the Lauder counter thinks homeschoolers are &quot;weird&quot;, she was <br/>
pissed.<br/>
A customer approached right as I was getting to that point, so I didn&#39;t get <br/>
the chance to point out that we work with homeschoolers (and I bet she can&#39;t <br/>
tell  them from anyone else for crying out loud!!) .<br/>
But if it comes up again, you can bet I&#39;ll be asking her to point out the  <br/>
homeschoolers at Dillards.<br/>
Sheesh.<br/>
She irritates the hell out of me anyway though. I think she&#39;d like government <br/>
in control of everything. Germany a few years back may have suited her better.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She probably can produce studies that will seem convincing to<br/>
non-homeschoolers, by using all kinds of tricks in her study design. The<br/>
problem is that these studies become conventional wisdom, or are used to<br/>
determine public policy. Poorly designed studies get challenged,<br/>
however. Do you remember the recent study that showed that co-sleeping<br/>
was deadly to children? It was sponsored by an organization that<br/>
represents crib manufacturers, and was challenged strongly on the<br/>
grounds of what it left out of the statistics (parental inebriation for<br/>
example). That didn&#39;t stop one of the workmen doing the roof at our<br/>
complex from giving me a lecture about how unsafe it was to let Jayn<br/>
sleep with me, when I was generous enough to let him use my bathroom! <br/>
