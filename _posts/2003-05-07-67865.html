<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928724038">Hello everyone...<br/>
I joined the list recently and have been lurking (to be read as reading and<br/>
learning!) and browsing the archives.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jen and I live in CA. with my hubby and our two boys -- Beck (7)<br/>
and Dane (4).  My boys have never been to school and I hope they never have<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Here is our story....Beck wanted to learn to read when he was about 4<br/>
1/2...so I helped him.  By the time he was supposed to be registering for K<br/>
I started thinking about how horrible I thought it would be for him to have<br/>
to sit through weeks and weeks of learning the alphabet when he was already<br/>
reading.  I starting asking around and decided that we could homeschool.  We<br/>
were having a great time doing our own thing and then I read The Well<br/>
Trained Mind...sooooo...I got all excited and thought &quot;that&#39;s what we need<br/>
to do.  Our boys will have an awesome education and I will learn a lot too!&quot;<br/>
I have recently come to the painful realization that over the last year or<br/>
so I have slowly been killing his love of learning.  I never followed TWTM<br/>
&quot;by the book&quot; and we did lots of hands-on projects and field trips...they<br/>
just weren&#39;t really of any interest to my boys.  I&#39;ve started talking and<br/>
listening a lot more to others in our HS group that take the more child-led<br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have ditched any curricula I was using and I am just trying to get<br/>
back in tune with my kids.  I have been reading everything I can get my<br/>
hands on about unschooling.  I am trying to just sit back and let life<br/>
happen.  It is comforting to hear other&#39;s stories of how they came to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I am also trying to let go of my anxieties and fears.  My biggest fear is<br/>
not being able to provide a rich environment full of learning opportunities.<br/>
Right now...it just seems like they want to be left alone.  I am trying to<br/>
respect that and let them know that I am here if they need/want me.  I have<br/>
also made suggestions....and let them go if the boys say &quot;No, thank you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am very open to any advice or words of wisdom that anyone would like to<br/>
share with me.  Other than that I will just continue to read and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to anyone that was able to make it through my rambling thoughts.<br/>
Namaste,<br/>
Jen  :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876340580">Hi Jen<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming through the same things you are, just beginning to trust <br/>
my kids&#39; brains to be &quot;knowledge absorpers&quot; (Sp?) absorb?...<br/>
<br/>
Wanted to say, about the rich learning environment. Do they have a <br/>
bathtub? LOL When I listed &quot;Everything I Have Ever Learned&quot; per <br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s advice in an article about parental deschooling, one of <br/>
the things in that list is my knowledge of how air pressure forces <br/>
water up into a sealed tubular structure, when the opening of the <br/>
tube is held under water. (cup, bathtub, 9 year old brain) I know <br/>
that water will &quot;climb&quot; inside a cup, by playing with it in the tub. <br/>
And, some time in my readings as a child, or possibly from a science <br/>
program on TV, I heard about the physics behind that phenomenon (air <br/>
pressure on the surface of the water being greater than the air <br/>
pressure inside the cup)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we want to provide lots of opportunities, but my point is, <br/>
your kids will learn from things you can&#39;t even imagine. Sort of like <br/>
the principle of the box the toy came in, being lots more fun than <br/>
the toy itself. Relax and watch your kids play for awhile. The <br/>
connections they make will amaze you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908537919">Thank you for the welcome Heidi.  Your words were just the encouraging type<br/>
I needed.  I do have to admit that I think my oldest is still kind of<br/>
testing me -- &quot;does she really mean I don&#39;t have to do those stupid lessons<br/>
anymore...or is she going to go back?&quot;  KWIM?  And it&#39;s amazing how fewer<br/>
times I have heard &quot;I&#39;m bored.&quot;  (I do know that it&#39;s okay for them to be<br/>
bored sometimes) but I think that before they wouldn&#39;t get involved in their<br/>
fantasy play because they suspected that at any moment I was going to come<br/>
in and tell them they had to stop and come do what I wanted them to do now.<br/>
Looking back....I am disgusted at how many times I actually did that!<br/>
<br/>
And funny you should mention the bathtub.  I just ordered a book called<br/>
_Bathtub Science_ or something like that.  I just hope that when I put it on<br/>
the shelf the boys actually look at it...or at least ask me about it.<br/>
:::grin:::<br/>
<br/>
Again...thank you for the welcome and kind words.<br/>
<br/>

Hi Jen and welcome. Thanks for sharing the story of your path to <br/>
unschooling. Here&#39;s mine: www.sandradodd.com/special/mary<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am also trying to let go of my anxieties and fears.  My biggest <br/>
 </span></blockquote>fear is not being able to provide a rich environment full of learning <br/>
opportunities.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to let go. Let go of the fear that has been instilled in <br/>
you by the experts. Look to your kids and they will be their own <br/>
experts in what is the next &quot;right&quot; thing to learn and do. Really. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Right now...it just seems like they want to be left alone.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right now is all you&#39;ve got. Go with it. They&#39;re deschooling. Keep <br/>
reading and you&#39;ll deschool too. Each in his own way, each in his own <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
