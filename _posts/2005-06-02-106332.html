The Dumbest Thing You&#39;ve Ever Heard about Home Schooling<br/>
<br/>
The Dumbest Thing YOU Ever Heard, Part 1 By Mike Farris<br/>
My recent column requesting &quot;dumb statements&quot; people had made<br/>
regarding home schooling yielded a bumper crop of lols (laugh out<br/>
loud) and a few rofls rolling on the floor laughing). I got a<br/>
great number of wonderful entries -- far too many to publish.<br/>
Today&#39;s column is the first of two. Here are half of the top<br/>
entries, this week&#39;s winners, and my comments interspersed. Here<br/>
come the comments.<br/>
<br/>
From Kara Becker:<br/>
Our realtor learned we were home schooling. She commented about<br/>
the lack of social development that would result, but tried to still<br/>
be positive by adding, &quot;Even though they couldn&#39;t be realtors, thank<br/>
goodness that there are lot of jobs out there which don&#39;t require<br/>
people skills.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Thank you, Dale Carnegie (author of &quot;How to Win Friends and<br/>
Influence People&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
From the Austin family:<br/>
A stranger said, &quot;Don&#39;t you think your children are being deprived of<br/>
the thrill of buying school supplies at Wal-Mart when everyone else<br/>
does?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Angela Blackman:<br/>
A friend who is a paralegal at a very busy law firm said, &quot;How can<br/>
you ever think you can keep up with having four kids at home?<br/>
Don&#39;t they just run you off your feet? I&#39;d be exhausted by the end<br/>
of the day.&quot;<br/>
Mike: It is a proven fact that assisting two lawyers is the<br/>
equivalent of having six kids or else tending a dozen snakes --<br/>
depending on the age of the lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
From Pamela Minerd:<br/>
My father asked, &quot;Will I have to bail you out of jail for this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From MDT:<br/>
My neighbor was picking my brain about getting the public school to<br/>
challenge her first grader. She was concerned because my first<br/>
grader was already reading while her son of the same age was just<br/>
learning the sounds of letters. Nonetheless she challenged my home<br/>
schooling saying my son would still miss out. &quot;It&#39;s important for<br/>
him socially too. He needs to be offered drugs so he can turn them<br/>
down.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Marci Zinn:<br/>
A family member said, &quot;You are just doing this for yourself so you<br/>
won&#39;t have to buy the kids any school clothes.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Working 8+ hours a day for 12+ years just smacks of selfishness<br/>
if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
From MDT:<br/>
A friend asked, &quot;Do you use books?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Rose Mary Coffey:<br/>
When my husband told his mother that we were going to home school,<br/>
she replied, &quot;What makes Rose Mary think she has the right to teach<br/>
my grandchildren?&quot;<br/>
Mike: It&#39;s in the same clause of the Constitution which gives<br/>
grandmas the right to feed cookies and candy to the grandkids an<br/>
hour before being sent home for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
From the Karoutsos Family:<br/>
My six year old son was very fidgety in the dentist&#39;s chair.<br/>
Afterwards the dentist spoke to me and told me of his fidgetiness<br/>
and said, &quot;Your son did not sit still. It is possibly due to the<br/>
fact that you home school him.&quot;<br/>
Mike: I guess he thought that dentistry was so boring he would branch<br/>
out into child psychology.<br/>
<br/>
From Pam Hynes:<br/>
I told an old friend from high school how my son was able to progress<br/>
in each subject at his own rate. She earnestly replied, &quot;What if he<br/>
learns it all before he finishes high school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From the Austin family:<br/>
A female public school teacher said, &quot;Your son will turn out to be<br/>
much too feminine or gay because you home school him. Being with<br/>
his mother so much is not good for boys.&quot;<br/>
Mike: I guess that spending ages 5 through 12 with female public<br/>
school teachers would be better.<br/>
<br/>
From Laurie Winkelmann:<br/>
I took my daughter to a podiatrist who specialized in treating<br/>
plantar warts. I asked how children contracted these warts. He<br/>
told me that they often come from locker rooms or swimming pools.<br/>
When I told him that since we home school it wouldn&#39;t be a locker<br/>
room, but we do take a swimming class, he replied, &quot;Yup, home<br/>
schooling, that certainly explains it.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Sounds like someone needs to breath a little fresh air between<br/>
foot examinations.<br/>
<br/>
From Dawn Howey:<br/>
A Christian friend, &quot;God didn&#39;t homeschool Jesus, He sent Him away<br/>
to school.&quot;<br/>
Mike: I think the friend needs to be sent away to Sunday School.<br/>
<br/>
From Susan Shay:<br/>
&quot;Won&#39;t they miss out on learning a lot of important stuff? I mean,<br/>
how will they ever learn to stand in line?&quot; (Similar statements<br/>
were made to Gita Schmitz and Kathi Kearney. All three get tapes.)<br/>
Mike: Thank goodness for the rigorous standards of Goals 2000.<br/>
<br/>
From Tracy Pina:<br/>
An acquaintance said, &quot;Every kid has to get beat up a few times in<br/>
public school or they won&#39;t be able to cope in the real world.&quot;<br/>
Mike: Sticks and stones will break my bones or else I won&#39;t be well<br/>
rounded.<br/>
<br/>
From Clarence and Barbara Hawkins:<br/>
A home school family in our town took their school days off in the<br/>
middle of the week to match the father&#39;s job schedule. Some nosey<br/>
neighbors had the family investigated for home schooling on Saturday!<br/>
Mike: Reminds me of the social services case I had in Alabama where a<br/>
mother was hotlined for allowing her children to read books in the<br/>
back of the van while she drove around town.<br/>
<br/>
From MDT:<br/>
A friend said, &quot;MY child is being a light in a dark place, but I<br/>
guess SOME children are not able to do that.&quot;<br/>
Mike: With that much condescension that lady probably fogs up her<br/>
own glasses.<br/>
<br/>
From Michelle Nichols:<br/>
A woman asked a home school friend of mine, &quot;If you don&#39;t send your<br/>
children to school, who is going to teach them their morals?&quot;<br/>
Mike: Yeah, like the moral necessity of beating up other kids on the<br/>
playground if we are to believe another comment we read.<br/>
<br/>
From Barb Palmer:<br/>
Our girls&#39; friends from the neighborhood ask, &quot;If you are home<br/>
schooled, who teaches you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From the Austin family:<br/>
A friend said, &quot;Won&#39;t your children miss the experience of the goods<br/>
and bads of dating people from other cultural and religious<br/>
backgrounds?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Char Brady:<br/>
A mother from my daughter&#39;s former public school class said, &quot;If you<br/>
were more involved in your child&#39;s education, then you wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to home school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From MDT:<br/>
An acquaintance asked, &quot;How can you possibly give them enough<br/>
one-on-one time?&quot;<br/>
Mike (stolen from MDT): I guess the kids would get more one-on-one<br/>
time in a classroom of 30.<br/>
<br/>
From &quot;Ozchick&quot;:<br/>
A friend asked me what we were going to do during a public school<br/>
snow day. I replied that we were going ahead with school. The friend<br/>
replied, &quot;That&#39;s silly. Why make your kids work since no one will be<br/>
around to grade their papers?&quot; Not to be outdone, that same friend<br/>
heard me describe how I was teaching my children baking from the<br/>
Colonial period. A recent project was making a cake from<br/>
scratch. She replied, &quot;Where can I buy a box of scratch,<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Nancy Persaud<br/>
(although this comment is not within the rules of the contest as<br/>
Nancy recognized, it is too good to pass up): From a 5th grade<br/>
geography textbook, &quot;Maps are smaller than the areas they represent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
From Dana Estes:<br/>
A friend said, &quot;I could NEVER home school my children. I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine spending that much time with them.&quot; She is a public school<br/>
teacher.</div>

Somewhere I read a retelling (prose for kids, but early-20th-century kids) of <br/>
the visit to the Temple, and it was told like a lot of families were on a <br/>
field trip and it said something like &quot;Jesus had to go to school like you do,&quot; or <br/>
some such.  <br/>
<br/>
So if she read it in a Bible story book, it must be true.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Reminds me of a friend of ours who, when DS was about 4, (and we <br/>
made no bones about it that we were homeschooling even then, so she <br/>
already knew that) said &quot;you should have him tested. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d <br/>
get into a gifted and talented program&quot; huh? I said &quot;why? he&#39;s <br/>
already in a class by himself&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait that reminds me of another conversation with someone: her DD <br/>
and my DS are about the same age and in the same Bible class on <br/>
Sundays. She commented on how well behaved he was in class (in <br/>
contrast to some of the other little boys). I made some polite mom-<br/>
noise. Then she said &quot;He&#39;d probably do really well in school&quot;. I <br/>
said &quot;well, in Bible class, sitting still and all is &quot;playing <br/>
school&quot; and he does what he wants there pretty much for an hour and <br/>
it&#39;s done. It&#39;s all just fun for him as something different. If he <br/>
had to sit and do that however many hours per day all week, he&#39;d <br/>
probably be acting like the other kids.&quot; (I didn&#39;t go much into <br/>
detail on how much BS there is in school besides sitting quietly for <br/>
hours). Fortunately, we had planned, since the kids were on a lunch-<br/>
outing that day, for me and DH to have lunch with her and her DH and <br/>
I got to explain more and she sort-of got the general idea of <br/>
homeschooling (I didn&#39;t even mention &#39;unschooling&#39; by name, but it <br/>
was there).</div>

 </span></blockquote>OH OH - I&#39;ve heard variations of this too, for years. People new to our <br/>
park day OFTEN seem to have this overwhelming need to convince us that <br/>
THEIR kid is too smart to just let him play in the park all day. They <br/>
don&#39;t have time for that because their SMART kid needs to spend his <br/>
time feeding his big brain. (Okay - nobody&#39;s ever said THAT, but that&#39;s <br/>
how it comes across.)<br/>
<br/>
If they hang around long enough, and pay any attention at all to any of <br/>
the other kids, they discover that many of the kids are actually <br/>
brilliant. And it is the long long hours of free play that allowed them <br/>
to develop their incredible imaginations and self-motivation and all <br/>
that.<br/>

Someone I don&#39;t see anymore, when Jayn was a big toddler and I told her of<br/>
our homeschooling plan, got a kind of knowing smirk on her face and said (to<br/>
my recollection) &quot;I&#39;ve known some home schooled kids that were OK, but some<br/>
of them have *social problems*&quot;. (Her emphasis with a kind of &quot;you know what<br/>
I mean&quot; tone - I didn&#39;t know). <br/>
<br/>
Her baby was an infant at the time and she had called me to grumble about<br/>
the early academics her daycare center was pushing - he was almost a year<br/>
old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39605284">Dear all,<br/>
<br/>
I am involved in a cancer-related e-board and a woman<br/>
whose mother died 7 weeks ago has begun posting about<br/>
her 16 year-old son who has started cutting school.  I<br/>
tried to apply a few unschooly principles to her<br/>
situation but wanted to be delicate about it, too,<br/>
respecting the fact that she is deeply grieving and is<br/>
not asking for (or likely to accept) a whole new way<br/>
of looking at life, school and her son.<br/>
<br/>
She posted again, indicating that her son has said<br/>
he&#39;d go to school then doesn&#39;t, locks himself in his<br/>
room and won&#39;t talk to her, and tells her that every<br/>
time she breaks down, it depresses him.  I feel great<br/>
pain for this woman and even more for her son.  She&#39;s<br/>
so mired in her misery, she can&#39;t look up high enough<br/>
to see him or his pain.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I am coming to you is that several people<br/>
responded to her and I was truly horrified with the<br/>
advice that flowed.  It all started with the<br/>
assumption (the same as hers) that school is necessary<br/>
or her son&#39;s future is wasted.  It branched out to<br/>
suggestions of military school, drugs/drug therapy,<br/>
counseling, following him from class to class, and one<br/>
woman who said she goes through her kids&#39; stuff -<br/>
cautiously so they don&#39;t know - to know what they&#39;re<br/>
doing and they think she&#39;s psychic or something.<br/>
<br/>
My stomach was absolutely turning as I read one<br/>
response after another in this vein.  So I turn to all<br/>
of you experienced folks.  I am not looking to turn<br/>
this woman into an unschooler.  I AM trying to find<br/>
ways to point out there are alternatives for her son,<br/>
that she is a mess and that school should be the least<br/>
of their worries as a family right now.<br/>
<br/>
What ideas do you have that might help this woman? <br/>
Her last line in her post was &quot;9 days left in the<br/>
school year and I&#39;m not even sure I can get him to<br/>
attend a single class. But I do keep<br/>
trying........always trying.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like he&#39;s grieving and might be depressed.  Those are<br/>
reasons enough to call the school and get him excused -- if there are<br/>
final exams he&#39;s supposed to take, she could work out an arrangement<br/>
for them.  He&#39;s certainly not going to do well on them in his current<br/>
state.  And besides the exams, there&#39;s nothing left but the goofing<br/>
off and turning in textbooks, y&#39;know?<br/>
<br/>
You might point out to her that in this time of his very real<br/>
emotional need, wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if she could be on his side,<br/>
helping him get the space he needs to heal, instead of spending her<br/>
limited energy on being his adversary and working against him?  He<br/>
would always remember that, I think.<br/>
<br/>
I would also ask if she is seeking some gentle professional help for<br/>
him.  (And does she have someone to talk to for herself?)<br/>
<br/>
You could offer that if school really isn&#39;t meeting her son&#39;s needs,<br/>
she and her son might like _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_, -- maybe<br/>
that would open up a dialogue over the summer.  Or even one of Grace<br/>
Llewellyn&#39;s other books: _Guerrilla Learning: How to Give Your Kids a<br/>
Real Education With or Without School_.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600467317">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am involved in a cancer-related e-board and a woman<br/>
whose mother died 7 weeks ago has begun posting about<br/>
her 16 year-old son who has started cutting school. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that parents of teens will have better suggestions for her and her<br/>
son than I will have - or better ways of expressing the idea of letting him<br/>
be and letting him also mourn. <br/>
<br/>
However as someone whose mother died of cancer this last January I do have a<br/>
suggestion that helped me with my mourning. I felt very &quot;blocked&quot; and heavy<br/>
and was having trouble thinking or communicating clearly - either on line or<br/>
to the people in my life. <br/>
<br/>
I found that I gained great sense of relief and release by sitting down for<br/>
a long uninterrupted session with my laptop and writing all I could remember<br/>
about my mother&#39;s life and my own childhood with her.<br/>
<br/>
In my case it was a process of getting rid of a lot of negativity and<br/>
releasing anger and resentments. However recording joys and recollections of<br/>
closeness might also be as freeing. <br/>
<br/>
For me it was a case of getting this stuff out of my head, and onto &quot;paper&quot;,<br/>
so that my thinking was released - my brain ceased feeling like it was<br/>
stuffed with marshmallow the second I hit the final period. I was able to<br/>
start talking to others, and thinking logically again. <br/>
<br/>
If this lady is mourning and is as blocked as I was, she may be relying on<br/>
old routines and conventions to help her feel secure. She may be simply<br/>
unable, yet, to accept new ideas of any sort. Her son needs his time to<br/>
mourn also, including being angry and going through a period of questioning<br/>
or feeling everything is &quot;pointless&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If she is trying to force him to be &quot;normal&quot; because of her need for<br/>
normalcy, his mourning may last longer (like short circuiting deschooling<br/>
with &quot;suggestions&quot;). I think he will fight for autonomy because of his need<br/>
to mourn in his own way. However perhaps they both feel if they can just<br/>
hold on in their different ways until the summer break, that may provide an<br/>
anticipated and comfortable change in routine that will let them both mourn<br/>
fully. <br/>
