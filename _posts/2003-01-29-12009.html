<div id="ygrps-yiv-564853564">Someone posted the following joke about homeschoolers on a board I read <br/>
(non-homeschool related, but with a bunch of homeschoolers. I pointed out <br/>

<br/>
Q: How does a home schooler change a light bulb?<br/>
<br/>
A: First, mom checks three books on electricity out of the library, then the <br/>
kids make models of light bulbs, read a biography of Thomas Edison and do a <br/>
skit based on his life. Next, everyone studies the history of lighting <br/>
methods, wrapping up with dipping their own candles. Next, everyone takes a <br/>
trip to the store where they compare types of light bulbs as well as prices <br/>
and figure out how much change they&#39;ll get if they buy two bulbs for $1.99 <br/>
and pay with a five dollar bill. On the way home, a discussion develops over <br/>
the history of money and also Abraham Lincoln, as his picture is on the five <br/>
dollar bill. Finally, after building a homemade ladder out of branches <br/>
dragged from the woods, the light bulb is installed. <br/>
<br/>
And there is light.<br/>

<br/>
(Although the joke, properly, is how MANY whatevers does it take to change a<br/>
lightbulb...)  <br/>

Nancy, getting too old to remember her own punchlines.  Sheesh!</div>

Q: How does a home schooler change a light bulb?<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t do the whole joke, but I would start with &quot;negotiate with<br/>
children about when and how you can extract the ladder from the fort in<br/>
the living room.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d like to end the whole light bulb saga with &quot;a field trip to see<br/>
glass blowers in Benicia, a stroll past the Victorian houses in the town<br/>
and a big party and computer game fest at my house.&quot;<br/>

and I&#39;ll join you).</div>

 </span></blockquote>Is Benicia famous for its glassblowers, Besty? I&#39;m in Marin, but <br/>
glassblowing sounds like a great field trip. If you want to email <br/>
me privately, I&#39;d love to help organize a trip.<br/>

We would LOVE to watch glass blowing.  We live up in Woodland, but come<br/>
to Benicia to see my very best friend.  Where do they do it?<br/>

Many structured homeschoolers don&#39;t believe in environmental impact.  <br/>
Many unschoolers would already know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the best time to see glassblowing in Benicia may be at the<br/>
larger Open Studio weekend May 3rd and 4th.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m new in town and I haven&#39;t done this before, but it always sounded<br/>
tempting to me.)<br/>

It&#39;s also possible to arrange tours here (three glass studios together):<br/>

PS  I don&#39;t suppose your best friend is an unschooler?  Or has an 8 year<br/>
old that wants to play?  ::: crossing fingers :::</div>
