What does it cost?<br/>

How long can I delay making a decision to register?<br/>

I&#39;m going to Paris next fall. I don&#39;t know if I could come, but I <br/>
would love to. I think it would be such a shot in the arm.<br/>

Would you post the details all in one post for me? Pretty please?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julie, and everybody:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wary of posting anything I don&#39;t know FOR sure. I have an appointment <br/>
with the hotel on Tuesday morning. If we can work it all out then---iron out <br/>
all details, I&#39;ll post next week. It will be in Columbia, SC TENTATIVELY <br/>
22-24 August 2003 at the Holiday Inn-Coliseum.<br/>
<br/>
Prices aren&#39;t set yet---I have to figure out the expenses before I set the <br/>
price. I&#39;ll make it as reasonable as I possibly can. Last year we had family <br/>
discounts and early bird discounts, so the earlier you register, the better <br/>
deal you get. That&#39;s the plan this year too. Room rates are $79 plus tax, the <br/>
same as last year---in a better (and safer&lt;G&gt;) hotel . And kids under 5 eat <br/>
free.<br/>
<br/>
Presenters are: S-P-A-M ---Sandra Dodd, Pam Sorooshian, Anne Ohman, and Mary <br/>
Gold. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
You can check out last year&#39;s website (which NEEDS to get hoppin&#39; SOON for <br/>
THIS year!) in my sig line.<br/>
<br/>
We welcome dads and children. Non age-discriminatory---although some things <br/>
are more age-appropriate than others.(and we&#39;ll have a room &#39;specially for <br/>
toddlers this year). And Ben will have some &quot;Dads Only&quot; sessions (at their <br/>
request).<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can make it. &quot;Shot in the Arm&quot; is an understatement! Many said <br/>
last year was life-changing!! (I&#39;ll blow my own horn! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737623705">Oh what a wonderful birthday present it would be for me to be able to go. <br/>
Half of me would loved to come with the whole family and half of me would <br/>
love to be on my own for a weekend but ALL of me would love to get there any <br/>
way I could.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could dream.<br/>

I bet they&#39;re really disappointed the first time they see an American gopher.<br/>
Even drizzled with chocolate, they&#39;re pretty ratty and dusty.</div>

For them it was so nice to be with like minded people.  Adults not ignoring <br/>
them and older children interested in what younger children had to say, even <br/>
playing with them.  They loved it.<br/>
