<div id="ygrps-yiv-348035985">Reading is knowing that letters are connected to sounds. That&#39;s what phonics<br/>
means -- the sounds of letters.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning readers need to learn the letters&#39; names and the sounds they stand<br/>
for. &quot;A&quot; has more than one sound -- &quot;A&quot; as is hat, and &quot;a&quot; as in age or<br/>
baby.<br/>
<br/>
E sounds like the &quot;e&quot; in bed, or the &quot;e&quot; in meet.  I has two sounds. One is<br/>
in words like HIT, the other is in words like BITE.<br/>
<br/>
I bought plastic letters with magnets on the back and made short words on<br/>
the refrigerator, such as AT. Next day, I changed it to CAT, then RAT, then<br/>
RAM. Same with HOT, POT, LOT, LOG...<br/>
<br/>
UP changed to CUP, then ZUP (just for fun) -- Dr. Seuss stuff.<br/>
<br/>
IT, SIT, SIP, RIP, DIP, DRIP, SKIP, STIK. spelling doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>
correct so long as the child understands that letters mean sounds. Make up<br/>
nonsense words just to make the point -- ZARK.  BAM.  WUG...  They get it<br/>
very quickly usually. It becomes a game...maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare<br/>
PS  As much as I like Sam Blumenfeld, 100 &quot;easy lessons&quot; doesn&#39;t sound easy<br/>
to me. It sounds like school. Try to do this with NO lessons, just fun. I<br/>
always remember that one child, when asked how he learned to read, he said,<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I just learned &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; and I could read.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s only schools that want us to believe that it takes a long time to teach<br/>
a child to read, and that it&#39;s difficult. It doesn&#39;t, and it isn&#39;t. Contrary<br/>
to what they say, English is incredibly regular and simple...26 letters and<br/>
only 44 sounds.<br/>
<br/>
Next is to divide longer words into short ones called syllables. The<br/>
syllables can be read separately...that&#39;s &quot;sounding out&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 Once a child understands the connection between letters and sounds, s/he&#39;s<br/>
got it. If he/she can read short words and very short sentences, such as,<br/>
Jim sat on a red box, they are reading.<br/>
In my experience with our son during his early years, walking around town<br/>
and reading signs was, I believe, a good start. Not only did it make the<br/>
connection between words and real activities ( BANK means money changing,<br/>
and BOOK STORE is a place that keeps books) but it made learning reading<br/>
incidental to living, instead of a separate, disconnected experience.<br/>
<br/>
Something else we did was make signs (3x5&quot; or so) taped to household items<br/>
-- pan, window, rug, wall, door, refrigerator, table. It doesn&#39;t take long.<br/>
Pretty soon, the child might make a sign for something. At that point, s/he<br/>
is reading AND writing. You&#39;re home free.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is knowing when to stop this type of teaching. Keep it minimal.<br/>
Once a child gets it, it&#39;s time to stop &quot;teaching.&quot;</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that, in practice, what Ned is talking about is all that <br/>
different than our own experience, but it sounds like it comes from a <br/>
different place - like the kids won&#39;t learn unless the parent acts as a <br/>
phonics teacher.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped before we started. <br/>
<br/>
Kids have a natural interest in doing what adults do. Books and other reading <br/>
materials are naturally attractive. Being responsive is enough - all three of <br/>
my kids learned to read without anybody being conscious of &quot;learning phonics&quot; <br/>
or syllables or any of that. We surrounded them with a print-rich <br/>
environment, we LOVED to read to them, to ourselves, to each other, etc. We <br/>
played with words for the fun of it - not to &quot;teach&quot; them to read. <br/>
<br/>
All three (at 11, 14, and 17) read extremely voraciously - are seldom found <br/>
without a book at hand, if not two or three. They all write extensively as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
No conscious attempt to teach them to read was ever required unless you call <br/>
creating an environment conducive to them WANTING to learn to read <br/>
&quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(OH NO -- did I REALLY make that distinction between teaching and learning <br/>
again? Sorry - but it does seem to pop up here.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Once a child gets it, it&#39;s time to stop &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it was really just for fun, why would you stop?<br/>
If it was really teaching, then it wasn&#39;t just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
And just because a child knows there is a code and a pattern doesn&#39;t mean he <br/>
knows how to read.  There&#39;s quite a bit of practice required for reading to <br/>
really work fluently.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was at a Harry Potter card tournament today.  She had an irritating <br/>
opponent and came home and cried.  Two of the things he did:  Read his cards <br/>
aloud to himself, holding them under the edge of the table, and wouldn&#39;t read <br/>
them aloud for her to hear (but couldn&#39;t read silently), and when she would <br/>
ask to see what his card could do, he would hold it up but not let her touch <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Those are reading related things BIGTIME.  She was pretty frustrated, but she <br/>
did have the option not to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s learning to read was very phonetic.  Kirby&#39;s wasn&#39;t.  Holly&#39;s is a <br/>
combination.  There&#39;s more than one way to learn to read because people learn <br/>
to read in more than one way, and in various combinations, and different <br/>
people&#39;s minds are organized different ways.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was in first grade we were doing &quot;look say.&quot;  We learned some phonics <br/>
rules, but not tons.  We outlined letters for our reading practice, so we <br/>
would see the shapes of common words.<br/>
<br/>
I changed schools, districts, STATES for second grade and they taught all <br/>
phonics.  I thought phonics was fun, but I already knew how to read at that <br/>
point, so it was just busy work and amusement, and something to argue about <br/>
(whether that drawing was a cup or a mug, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
Once a child is reading, it doesn&#39;t matter how he learned it.  <br/>

a blast with her Harry Potter trading cards. (Unfortunately *I* don&#39;t get it <br/>
at all.) She packs her cards and that map thing in her back pack, and takes <br/>
them everywhere. She would hand Holly the whole stack and say &quot;Lets Play!!!&quot; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree with this basic premise. Or rather, I think that&#39;s *one* way<br/>
to read, but not the only way. Deaf people can read, having no idea what<br/>
&quot;sounds&quot; the letters symbolize. Letter are symbols, and different<br/>
combinations of letters symbolize different words. I know lots of<br/>
children who read fluently - i.e, pick up pretty much any book and go -<br/>
without knowing which sounds connected to which letters. My own daughter<br/>
knew basic letter sounds and played with them when she was younger, but<br/>
real reading for her when she started reading fleuntly, was purely<br/>
visual.<br/>
<br/>
My experience has been that some children learn to read through phonics,<br/>
but others learn visually, and knowing the sounds of the letters is at<br/>
best useless and at worst frustrating for them. And, of course, some kids<br/>
learn by combining both...<br/>

falling over. But that doesn&#39;t mean they need taught. They figure out what<br/>
muscles to use as a side effect of trying to walk.<br/>
<br/>
Kids, as far as I can tell from the stories people relate, figure out<br/>
phonics as a side effect of trying to read. Some of the things that my<br/>
daughter has done is read along silently as I&#39;m reading to her, ask how to<br/>
spell words, recognize signs and isolated words (like recognizing Pokemon<br/>
names). From all the information going in (for reasons other than &quot;learning<br/>
to read&quot;) she picks up (mostly unconsciously) patterns in English.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Kathryn if she knew what sounds &quot;i&quot; can make in words and she did<br/>
come up with the long and short sounds -- and threw in &quot;ee&quot; as it does in<br/>
Japanese ;-). She read &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;bite&quot; correctly -- as isolated words out<br/>
of context which is tough. I guess that&#39;s phonics, but no phonics lessons<br/>
involved.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Casey learned to read with a combination too. She knew letter sounds really <br/>
early, but when she actually started reading she preferred whole words and <br/>
lots of meaning in her stories. No &quot;The dog ran. The cat sat.&quot; She wanted <br/>
stories. But lately I&#39;ve noticed her doing a lot more sounding out. I think <br/>
the level of books she&#39;s reading are almost requiring her to do it. The <br/>
difference now is that she&#39;s enjoying the sounding out part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Phonics actually got in Conor&#39;s way big time. In fact, the key to him <br/>
finally figuring it all out was for me to remove the phonics idea for him. <br/>
It was hard for me to understand, because my brain works soooo differently <br/>
from his on this. He sees pictures in his head when he reads. Much more <br/>
vivid than any image I get. When he reads a story there&#39;s an actual movie <br/>
running in his brain. It&#39;s a movie he can rewind, pause or fast forward too. <br/>
That&#39;s a HUGE strength. But it  didn&#39;t work well with phonics for him.<br/>
<br/>
What did help him to become a fluent reader, was to have me read far enough <br/>
into a story that he had the movie going. He would then be able to read the <br/>
rest himself. If he reads fast enough to keep the movie going he&#39;s fine. His <br/>
comprehension is amazing. If he doesn&#39;t know a word, but can keep the movie <br/>
going, he just skips it. (He&#39;s skipping less and less words anymore BTW.) If <br/>
he really needs the word to understand the story he just asks me. (This <br/>
hardly ever happens anymore either.) The trick for him was to keep the movie <br/>
going  and not stop to try to sound things out. It was pretty amazing to <br/>
watch actually.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rosie couldn&#39;t hear the differences between the short vowel sounds very well <br/>
either -- AND she couldn&#39;t really clearly distinguish well between &quot;n&quot; and <br/>
&quot;m&quot; and &quot;d&quot; and &quot;th&quot; and some other sounds. She doesn&#39;t have any speech <br/>
delays - it was only a problem in written language. She&#39;s 11 and reads <br/>
extremely well and voraciously now, but still doesn&#39;t spell well.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s away (for the FIRST time) at Girl Scout camp for 5 nights. She&#39;s <br/>
written us 2 notes a day. We have to struggle a little to read some of the <br/>
words, but her spelling problems don&#39;t slow down her writing, thank goodness. <br/>
They did for a while - she used to cry because she wanted to write so much - <br/>
but knew that people had trouble reading what she&#39;d written. She got a lot of <br/>
support for just writing anyway and getting someone else to correct her <br/>
spelling, if it was important. She writes fan fiction and letters and keeps <br/>
journals and she and a couple of friends did a few issues of their own <br/>
newspaper recently. Her spelling is improving - but very very slowly and <br/>
she&#39;ll still spell the same word 3 different ways on one page &lt;G&gt;. I&#39;m sure, <br/>
in school, they&#39;d either think she wasn&#39;t really trying (because her other <br/>
abilities would be so advanced) or she&#39;d have a learning disabilities label <br/>
of some sort. At home it is just not one of her natural talents and something <br/>
she&#39;s figured out is going to come along slowly.<br/>
