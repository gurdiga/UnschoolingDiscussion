&lt;&lt; I am fortunate to interact with a lot of Christian unschoolers. I <br/>
 have been on two Christian unschooling groups and as an educational <br/>
 philosophy it seems to be growing among Christians, though it will not <br/>
likely <br/>
 catch up with the other approach any time soon. I have met people who are <br/>
 very conservative in other aspects of their lives who have embraced <br/>
 unschooling and are forming inclusive support groups. (I know you weren&#39;t <br/>
 painting us all with the same brush, just want to say there is hope.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a growing movement as well, which is why we wrote the book! LOL <br/>
My concern is that we become as accepted by our brothers and sisters in faith <br/>
as any other type of educational theory. We&#39;ll see. It is also my hope that <br/>
Christian unschoolers and relaxed homeschoolers and those nonchristian <br/>
home/unschoolers with open hearts will begin to heal the rifts that have <br/>
appeared between homeschoolers. <br/>
