Lexie is currently involved <br/>
in a rather formal film class, with kids from ages 9 to 18.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
Cameorn is involved in a film class too. The rest of the new film makers are <br/>
all in their 20&#39;s & 30&#39;s. At 16, Cam is certainly the baby. But they treat him <br/>
as any other---and are in awe of the freshness he brings.<br/>
<br/>
We filmed two scenes of his first fivr minute film today. It&#39;s about..... ta <br/>
DAH! .... Unschooling! &lt;G&gt; We borrowed a classroom from his (and my) old <br/>
private school. We got a bunch of his buds from a local public school&#39;s drama <br/>
department. Catering by Mom. It went very well. Cameron was calm and in charge, but <br/>
not bossy or too demanding. He got a lot from his actors.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll be shown June 4 & 5 at Spoleto in Charleston (that&#39;s a pretty big deal <br/>
for those of you not familiar with Spoleto). It&#39;s been a great experience so <br/>
far; his classmates are so supportive----and one is even thinking of using him <br/>
as her camera man for a film later this summer!<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to Lexie! That&#39;s exciting!<br/>
