<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855445234">Hi everyone-<br/>
<br/>
I am a lurker here, but I&#39;ve hung around this list and<br/>
other unschooling lists for quite a long time and now<br/>
I need some help.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I have been making a long, painful<br/>
transition over the past few years away from an<br/>
authoritative, controlling style of parenting and<br/>
living.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we have 7 children and my days are just crazy.<br/>
<br/>
But what is especially hard is that there is such a<br/>
negativity around here and our kids compete with each<br/>
other so much (over everything) that we seem to never<br/>
have any peace to do the fun stuff!  The kids are:<br/>
14yog; 11yob; 9yob;7yob;5yob;2yog and 11 month old<br/>
boy.<br/>
<br/>
My dh thinks it&#39;s just a numbers game and feels that<br/>
I&#39;m overwhelmed.  His answer is just to send them to<br/>
school.  But, I think that would just add other<br/>
stresses and really believe that we&#39;d have to tackle<br/>
these underneath issues anyhow.  I am going to<br/>
counseling to work out some of the bits about my own<br/>
parents and how I was raised...but when I bring up<br/>
parenting there, I hear pretty much the same thing<br/>
about time-outs, 1-2-3 Magic, etc...and that&#39;s not<br/>
what I&#39;m looking for.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read tons of parenting materials, but can&#39;t seem<br/>
to find or articulate exactly what I want and I&#39;m<br/>
wondering if anyone just has some good common sense<br/>
ideas or whatever.  It doesn&#39;t have to be from a book.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to punish my kids in any way right now. <br/>
I think it just adds to the negative cycle.  But, it<br/>
takes SOOOOO much time to be the patient explainer too<br/>
and I just don&#39;t know if I have it in me with them<br/>
home all the time.  I&#39;ve been on the TCS list in the<br/>
past, too, but disagree with the strident quality that<br/>
sometimes comes across there; plus I do think that<br/>
there are times when kids just plain are doing<br/>
something wrong and need to be helped not to do it. <br/>
As do adults!  <br/>
<br/>
I read Emotionally Intelligent Parenting, but they<br/>
advocate a thing called &quot;Chill-Out.&quot;  They say the<br/>
idea is to get the kid to take responsibility for<br/>
their own behavior and I agree with that logic. <br/>
Unfortunately, when it&#39;s backed up by Mom or Dad<br/>
saying...go chill out and administering the time<br/>
clock, then who is it who is controlling behvior?  <br/>
You can SAY anything you want to kids, but the proof<br/>
is in the pudding.<br/>
<br/>
I have one child who is very cooperative when he&#39;s<br/>
approached gently (duh, aren&#39;t we all!) but as soon as<br/>
he smells anything that even remotely seems like a<br/>
punishment, he&#39;ll dig in his heels and pull like a<br/>
mule.  So what do you do then...add more punishment<br/>
and it&#39;s a vicious cycle.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m asking for here is practical advice<br/>
on how to live a more gentle cooperative life with so<br/>
many people under one roof.  But, please answer even<br/>
if you don&#39;t have a big family.  Many brains make for<br/>
better solutions!  I think...or is it too many brains<br/>
muddle the soup?<br/>
<br/>
My gut feeling tells me that there is a way to do this<br/>
without any kind of restrictions or &quot;punishments,&quot;<br/>
time-outs of any kind.  But my dh and many other<br/>
people tell me I&#39;m too idealistic.  I don&#39;t mean to<br/>
say I will never be human and yell or get irritated. <br/>
I just think there&#39;s got to be a way of parenting<br/>
without controlling them.  How do you develop this<br/>
thing called self-control and encourage them to set<br/>
limits?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for a formula.  I was, but I&#39;ve had to<br/>
admit the futility of that route.  So, any bits of<br/>
wisdom picked up from your collective experiences<br/>
would help immensely!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
<br/>

<br>
<br>I too was raised in harsher ways than what I want for my children, and I <br>think you may have an &nbsp;ally(?Spelling) with your children. &nbsp;Some of them are <br>old enough to know what it is in your family that drives them crazy- what <br>soutions they want to see. &nbsp;Ask them what their ideal is. &nbsp;You know its not <br>making you happy, and if your not happy then they are not either. &nbsp;Map it out <br>on paper, what are goals you can all live with. &nbsp;Use signs and symbols to <br>help the little ones remember routines ( we used ones that are used for <br>autistic children or try graphics from your computer), ways of dealing with <br>each other and correct behavior. &nbsp;When you are slipping from the ideal its <br>time to go back to the drawing board and make revisions- with your husbands <br>and childrens help. &nbsp;You have taken a very big step and I congratulate <br>you-MOST DO NOT HAVE THE COURAGE- to change old patterns. &nbsp;Don&#39;t be hard on !
<br>yourself everything takes time, and every step forward &nbsp;or backwards is a <br>process of change. &nbsp;Good Luck, and don&quot;t lose hope. &nbsp;You are a great mother <br>for wanting this change!</font></html></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when there&#39;s a disagreement, ask the involved kids which of the other <br/>
kids they would accept as a mediator/go-between/judge.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe sometimes ask advice of the child you think can see the situation most <br/>
clearly, or who is the most available and calm when you&#39;re needing an idea.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times when I&#39;m frustrated with one of my kids and can&#39;t think of how <br/>
to handle a situation, one of the others is willing to think/talk it through <br/>
with me and their insights are good.<br/>
<br/>
I only have three, but when I was teaching and there were disputes or <br/>
problems, I&#39;d ask each of the two principals to choose a witness and the five <br/>
of us would go out away from the group (into the hallway) and I&#39;d state the <br/>
problem and the two witnesses would propose a solution.  The kids took things <br/>
better coming from other kids sometimes.  It wasn&#39;t me being arbitrary and <br/>
controlling--it was a solution agreed to in a group (and I often got the <br/>
happy joy of softening the proposed solution--kids can come up with some <br/>
rough sentences!!).<br/>

Anyways<br/>
I see that you mentioned TCS and I must say that their website etc <br/>
helped me to some degree, but I too have children that just DO NOT <br/>
fit into their mold!<br/>
Some of my kids seem to almost demand that I scream!<br/>
I swear they must think up ways to get me to yell<br/>
But anyways trying to think what has worked for us.  I think you <br/>
mentioned a war zone (we have that), but I often find when they are <br/>
their most loud and unruly they are actually quite funny and why not <br/>
join in?<br/>
Although this does not always work (sometimes I am way too tired, <br/>
needy, emotionally drained etc) I find that most situations that I <br/>
become involved in (negative ones) become some type of battle with <br/>
mom, so I usually sit back and chew my nails and they seem to work it <br/>
out for themselves.  I see in my one son that he wants me to become <br/>
involved and for him I have to hide my head and run for the hills, no <br/>
really I have to step carefully so as not to fall into his trap.  I <br/>
know that sounds sick and strange, but he really asks for my anger (I <br/>
have had a rough time with him and we have been trying the past few <br/>
years to get out of our angry dance) and I really try to stay away <br/>
from it.  The other kids pretty much know their limits (as in things <br/>
that would really not be a good idea IE...smearing the dog with <br/>
jelly, turning the floor into lunch, those types of things) and we <br/>
pretty much try to respect one another, although I do not see where <br/>
making a huge mess and leaving it for me fits in, but I am hoping one <br/>
day a light bulb will go off somewhere.  Anyways I am really trying <br/>
to say something and I think I have not said a whole lot.  I think <br/>
when one is walking away from a authoratative parenting style the <br/>
kids tend to ask for that back.....I think they are expecting it and <br/>
wonder when it will pop up and bite them in the ass.<br/>
Perhaps a meeting discussing the new styles or new &quot;rules&quot; etc would <br/>
help the situation.  I know there are times when I fail to tell my <br/>
kids what is going on in their world!<br/>
Well I hope that I helped somehow<br/>

around here!  I like your ideas, though.  Maybe using<br/>
uninvolved witnesses would take some of the steam out<br/>
of the situation.  I&#39;ve thought even about taking a<br/>
class in conflict resolution.  I know you don&#39;t always<br/>
need a class, but right now my brain just feels so<br/>

Kids Will Listen, and Listen So Kids Will Talk&quot; by Faber and Mazlisch. This<br/>
is a great book with tons of concrete examples (done in little cartoons),<br/>
checklists that you can print out and put on the fridge (this helps me),<br/>
etc. The ideas are simple and straightforward and child-respecting. When I<br/>
can remember to use them, they almost always work. You will not find<br/>
time-outs or punitive parenting in this book.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that helps me (again, when I remember it, LOL!) is that kids<br/>
learn primarily through example, not through instruction. If I want my kids<br/>
to have self-control, I must practice self-control. If I want them to handle<br/>
their emotions well, I need to express and handle mine well. Etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
One more thought that occurred to me is that you might want to involve more<br/>
rituals and rhythms in your day. I don&#39;t know how it would work with such an<br/>
age-spread of kids, but having simple routines for greeting the morning,<br/>
coming together for reading or song, etc. has really helped make our day<br/>
less chaotic and more enjoyable. I found the book &quot;Seven Times the Sun -<br/>
Guiding your child through the rhythms of the day&quot; to be helpful. We have a<br/>
song for greeting the morning, we gather for breakfast, then we each<br/>
play/read on our own for awhile, we do &quot;circle time&quot; where we come together<br/>
to read, sing, play games, then we do chores, and then usually our main<br/>
activity of the day. That&#39;s just an example of the kinds of rhythms that<br/>
have helped our days have more focus.<br/>

this book and Sibling Rivalry, too.  Maybe it&#39;s time<br/>
to check it out again. <br/>
<br/>
I liked your ideas about daily rhythms, too.  But, it<br/>
seems like that is also part of what the problem is<br/>
now. Things that used to work don&#39;t hold the kid&#39;s<br/>
attention anymore.  We have always gathered right<br/>
after breakfast for candle time where we read stories<br/>
and talk about the plans for the day and do prayers<br/>
and meditations, etc.  But, now the kids just seem to<br/>
want to bug each other...there&#39;s constant touching and<br/>
teasing and name calling whenever we try to do these<br/>
things.<br/>
We&#39;ve also for many years had a family tradition of<br/>
gathering after lunch on the couch and I usually read<br/>
aloud from a book and often the kids read aloud, too<br/>
and then we each read a book of our own.  But, this<br/>
time lately, too, has been just filled with bickering<br/>
about who is going to sit where and what blanket they<br/>
want and pretty soon I lose my temper because I&#39;m just<br/>
so tired of hearing all these problems over nothing!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I won&#39;t go on and on.  But thanks again for<br/>
your suggestions.  It&#39;s always good to re-evaluate<br/>
what you&#39;re doing!<br/>

The truth is I read the books and then try to integrate the ideas and <br/>
attitudes. I often feel inadequate for not being able to stick to the system, <br/>
you&#39;ve helped me realize that maybe that&#39;s not such a bad thing. <br/>

I sure can relate to this! My mother was a social worker who worked with <br/>
children and later with the elderly. She was emotionally abusive to me and my <br/>
sisters a lot of the time at home. I have the tendency to act like her more <br/>
than I want to admit. one difference is that my kids have been raised in an <br/>
open environment and don&#39;t hesitate to say, &quot;Watch it Mom, you&#39;re starting to <br/>
act like you say Grandma used to.&quot; By the way, part of how all the <br/>
communication stuff I&#39;ve learned from works for me is that my kids can give <br/>
me feedback. Good luck!  Remember that undoing the old patterns takes time <br/>
and can look messy while in process. -Amalia-</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979459932">The only successful pattern I&#39;ve been able to come up with in 10 years is to<br/>
keep changing the pattern.  I&#39;ve found that taking the jacket blurbs on<br/>
parenting books too seriously (Use our amazing method, and your children<br/>
will never disobey you again!) only leads to disappointment.  Read them all,<br/>
glean what&#39;s useful here and there, be as consistent as possible without<br/>
indulging foolish hobgoblins, and realize that it&#39;s a kid&#39;s job to stay one<br/>
step ahead of you.  Never, ever, ever have I been successful in<br/>
&quot;eliminating&quot; one problem without another cropping up to take its place.  If<br/>
I get bedtimes under control, mealtime becomes the battleground.  Mealtimes<br/>
are resolved, the children stop listening.  I regain their attention, and<br/>
now they are backtalking.  Around and around we go.  The individuals battles<br/>
don&#39;t matter; the lessons being learned are self-discipline, self-control,<br/>
respect, and love, and that goes for myself and my husband as much as the<br/>
kids.<br/>

Good luck!  Remember that undoing the<br/>

Thanks for the encouragement and sharing.  I try to<br/>
let my kids give me feedback, too, but they always<br/>

 BTW, I love your name, Amalia.  Is there a story<br/>

Take care-<br/>

Thanks! I chose it about 13 years ago as my spiritual name. I can hardly <br/>
remember what I thought it meant at the time, but later when I looked in a <br/>
name book it said it meant,&quot;industrious woman,&quot; which is really funny because <br/>
I am anything but and am striving for it...which I now know is how spiritual <br/>
names often work. I got it from Anna Amalia of Saxe Weimar who was a German <br/>
composer.</div>

this Amalia, but I&#39;ve never heard of taking a<br/>
spiritual name and it sounds fascinating.  Is it part<br/>
of a ceremony or something?<br/>

things you don&#39;t want to tell me...I won&#39;t be offended!)</div>
