<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131196252"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Or when 5 kids all want me to interact/help them with something at once and I feel harried from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pillar to post and I don&#39;t handle that so well because it makes me feel like I&#39;m failing and so then<br/>
I get stressed and short-tempered and irritable and answer questions in that stressed and<br/>
short-tempered and irritable kind of way so that the learning experience and closeness is ruined and&gt;<br/>
Thank you so much for your honesty. I really appreciate it and don&#39;t feel so bad because this is really my biggest struggle is the three of them when they are all going at once. Like right now my 4 mo old is really needing me and my two year old is pretty well entertained but at night between like 5 and 8 it is insanity in this house with everyone needing a peice of me (including my dh:)! and then I feel like going back to the old days of redirecting everyone (directing directing directing!). Any advise on this would be helpful! Thanks Kelli<br/>
