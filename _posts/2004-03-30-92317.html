<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930991802">None of my girls cared whether they won or lost. In fact, Sierra will even bug out right in the middle of a game she&#39;s tired playing, even if she&#39;s winning. <br/>
<br/>
That made Joseph very mad. He couldn&#39;t understand why she would stop when she was winning. He always wanted to win. And he hated losing. He&#39;d even start to get very mad in the middle of a game if it looked like he was losing.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
With him, it helped a lot to point out how the person that looked like they would win, wouldn&#39;t always. Like when we played Sorry or Trouble or something. Things could always take a turn and you would get surprised. <br/>
<br/>
There were a few times when I would make moves not obvious so Joseph could end up winning. Just so he could see how you never know.<br/>
<br/>
Next time he would get upset, I would remind him of those times. And I did also tell him I didn&#39;t enjoy playing the games when he got upset. Sometimes I wouldn&#39;t play and suggest something else because of his temper. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 9 now and doesn&#39;t do it at all anymore. We are really glad of that!!!<br/>
