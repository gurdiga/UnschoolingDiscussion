I love journal keeping.  Before I started keeping it on my pc, I started and<br/>
stopped a million times never getting very far. I actually hate the physical<br/>
process of writing, but I don&#39;t mind typing at all. <br/>
<br/>
I have the Loki Diary program for my pc and I love it.  It has a search<br/>
function.  I can look up things by date or by word/phrase easily.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun to look back on how you felt about something at a certain time once<br/>
you&#39;ve worked through it.  I esp. love going back and reading each days<br/>
worries when we got our first horse.  We faced a lot of fears and worked<br/>
through them.  It&#39;s cool to have it documented and to see how far we&#39;ve<br/>
come.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been keeping my journal regularly since 2000 and I wish I had started<br/>
earlier.  It would be cool to have notes when my kids were even smaller.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re not required to so I don&#39;t. There have been times in my life <br/>
when I was really good at journalling (when we were first married, <br/>
when I was pregnant and just after DS was born - but he&#39;s 7 1/2 now <br/>
and his baby book still hasn&#39;t been touched beyond about 3 months).<br/>
<br/>
However, I do often email my mom to let her know what we&#39;re doing <br/>
(my folks live in a different state). She has made a habit, since DS <br/>
was an infant, of printing out good stuff and putting it into a <br/>
binder - she&#39;s got emails going back to DS rolling over, sitting up, <br/>
getting his first teeth, on up to losing his first tooth last year <br/>
and all like that.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe instead of &#39;journalling&#39;, keep a running stream of emails <br/>
going out to &#39;whomever&#39; - whether it&#39;s keeping a spouse/partner in <br/>
the loop of what you do during the day or a &#39;good offense is the <br/>
best defense&#39; with relatives or whatever - and make a folder to keep <br/>
copies of what you send - they are automatically date stamped even!<br/>
<br/>
And, some folks like to blog their journalling instead of writing it <br/>
in a book.<br/>

   <br/>
  I think I&#39;ve started a journal maybe 20 times and quit within a few days or so on all of them.  So I&#39;m not a journal keeper, right now.  It often jumps into my head though, that I want to do one.  But, obviously it hasn&#39;t been important enough for me yet. ;) Or short ones have served the purpose.<br/>
   <br/>
  One time it really made something clear to me.  <br/>
   <br/>
  About 4 years ago, in our first weeks of being out of school, I thought I&#39;d journal our days and everything the kids were &quot;learning&quot;.  This was when I was first letting go of definitions of that word and letting go of a lot of schooly thinking. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m quite a bit different now. lol<br/>
   <br/>
  I maybe kept going on the journal for about a week and,,,  wow!  It showed me so much.  When I totally thought we weren&#39;t doing anything, we were actually doing a ton. :D  At the time I was just starting to research unschooling.  In my school mind we weren&#39;t doing anything, in the broader mind set--the more open and accepting unschooling mind set--I saw how much we really were doing! <br/>
   <br/>
  Keeping that journal was really a catalyst for me to trust my children. It was so eye opening.<br/>
   <br/>
  I haven&#39;t kept one since but think about it every so often. I think a blog might be cool to check out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337663048">I am like a few of you. I have started writing them soooo mnay times <br/>
and they always fall be the wayside. I even go out and get a nice book <br/>
thinking that will help..lol...nope. We are not required to keep one <br/>
for the schoolboard here either so maybe thats part of the reason why <br/>
its not really that big of a deal to me. I like the idea of sending <br/>
emails/notes or whatever to someone else is  a great one! I actuly <br/>
posted this because my hubby wants me to start another journal so that <br/>
he can see what the kids are doing through the day. Not becuase he <br/>
thinks were not doing anything, but because I think he is feeling out <br/>
of the loop being gone through the day. Yesterday I signed up for a AOL <br/>
Blog thing online. I am hoping that I will be more apt to write in <br/>
there then I am to write in a book. Here is to hoping. I think it will <br/>
be good to have a place for my parents to go and be able to look at <br/>
what were up to as well.<br/>
I do have a question about state/province requirements though. For <br/>
those that have pretty heavy ones, have you ever had a problem?</div>

 </span></blockquote>One of the &quot;benefits of journaling&quot; is well served by posting on  <br/>
lists like this one.   If people write out what they&#39;re doing and  <br/>
what they think about it and share it with others, that has a double  <br/>
benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Blogs are a good way too.  Others (like grandparents) can read it and  <br/>
as live evolves the writer sees the progress.<br/>

<br/>
This isn&#39;t the list for discussing local regulations.  If you have questions about requirements <br/>
in particular areas, local unschooling groups and lists are here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/local">http://sandradodd.com/local</a><br/>
<br/>
And if any of you could check there to help me proofread that, as I&#39;ve just updated a couple <br/>
of listings, I&#39;d really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
I know I lost an e-mail from someone listing a couple or three locals--please write again to <br/>
my new address, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Additions are welcome, but I really only want to list groups that are unschooling groups, not <br/>
just friendly to unschoolers, but based in that philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
