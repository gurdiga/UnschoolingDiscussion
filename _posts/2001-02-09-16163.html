Today&#39;s Word: Calumniate (Verb)<br/>
Pronunciation: [k�-&#39;l�m-nee-eyt]<br/>
Definition 1: To make malicious statements known to be false in an effort<br/>
to harm someone&#39;s reputation or character.<br/>
Usage 1: Our language can damage others in several ways: we may defame<br/>
(to focus an attack the victim&#39;s reputation), malign (to attack someone&#39;s<br/>
character by speaking badly of him or her), or vilify (to grossly<br/>
criticize someone to undermine their character and reputation).<br/>
&quot;Calumniate&quot; implies an attack on character or reputation that is<br/>
knowingly incorrect. Benjamin Disraeli, a 19th-century British Prime<br/>
Minister, said that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and<br/>
statistics. Calumniating falls under Disraeli&#39;s second category. The noun<br/>
is &quot;calumny.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Suggested Usage: Unfortunately, we find this behavior on all levels:<br/>
&quot;After a period of scandal, politicians sometimes become more careful<br/>
about calumniating their opponents.&quot; &quot;Humans are basically sadistic;<br/>
watch how toddlers calumniate their siblings, just to watch the spectacle<br/>
of the punishment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Etymology: Latin calumnia &quot;trickery, chicanery&quot; from calvor &quot;to deceive.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
**I thought that was Mark Twain? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought Mark Twain said &quot;When he goes to a wedding, he wants to be the <br/>
bride; when he goes to a funeral, he wants to be the corpse.&quot;  Or did someone <br/>
else say that *of* Mark Twain?  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mark Twain and Benjamin Franklin used to get all the credit for every clever <br/>
thing in English.  Lately Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s been getting more than his share of <br/>
credit.  Those three will cover the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the answer, I just know that it is common for things to be <br/>
credited to Mark Twain.<br/>
