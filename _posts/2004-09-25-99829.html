<div id="ygrps-yiv-702529627">I am having a really hard time getting my husband on board with the idea of  <br/>
unschooling.  I am doing the &quot;homeschooling&quot; so he really doesn&#39;t know we  <br/>
have dropped it.  He ask my so everyday what work he has to do.  I  just tell him <br/>
he knows what to do.  I hate leaving him out but when I  mentioned <br/>
unschooling he threw a tissy fit.  How will they learn things and  know they like it if <br/>
you don&#39;t introduce it.  Help I have tried reading him  things from the group <br/>
and unschooling websites but his school brain just doesn&#39;t  get it.  My so is <br/>
so happy and we have a good time together, but on the  weekends when dh is <br/>
home I have been noticing more stress in the family.....  help please.<br/>

I bet there&#39;s more stress in the family... because it&#39;s splitting in two different directions--that&#39;s so hard for you, and I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s happening. <br/>
<br/>
If you can get dh to read anything, try to get him to read a John Holt book, _Learning All the Time_, or at least just one  chapter from something more distilled like _Instead of Education_. Others may have better recommendations than that. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, here and at Sandra&#39;s site, there are lots of real person testimonials, lots of experience and wisdom, but with some folks that&#39;s just not going to carry the same kind of weight as a solid book, written by an expert. If Holt can open dh&#39;s mind and help him see *how much* kids learn, then maybe dh will be open to finding out from real unschoolers whether or not those ideas work. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467704550">Heidi,<br/>
       My son is 10 now and I started homeschooling when he was 5. I truly <br/>
believe in Unschooling and your story sounds very familiar to mine. I played the <br/>
school game at home because my husband didn&#39;t want to homeschool at all so to <br/>
even consider the unschooling idea was out of the question. My son and also <br/>
my 7yo dd both go to public school right now because I couldn&#39;t handle the <br/>
stress in our house anymore. <br/>
It is very difficult to homeschool when you don&#39;t agree on what to do. I <br/>
found myself doing what was best for my husband to see results, instead of <br/>
focusing on my children&#39;s needs. When you unschool, many times they don&#39;t learn to <br/>
read as early as children who go to school. You and I know that they will learn, <br/>
but try to explain that to your husband or to the school if you ever do put <br/>
them in. This is what happened to me. This all caused a lot of resentment (from <br/>
me) toward my husband also, for not supporting homeschooling. <br/>
       I&#39;m not sure if any of this helps, because I still don&#39;t have any <br/>
answers. Just thought I&#39;d tell you my story. I do believe if people would just <br/>
trust a Mother to make decisions about their children (if they are the ones with <br/>
them every day) things would work out best. A mother should make decisions <br/>
that are best for her children and she needs people around her to be supportive <br/>
of her, even when she makes a mistake. I hope everything works out for you.     <br/>
