&lt;&lt;  How do folks balance time for un-schooling?  Do you block out time or let <br/>
it happen when it happens or a mixture of both?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably many types of ideas could be given here... In my family, I find a <br/>
mixture of me encouraging, and initiating on some days, and on others , the <br/>
kids initiate.  Some days seem slower, then there are days, like yesterday, <br/>
where my oldest son was brimming with ideas.  He was building tunnels and <br/>
towers and watching how a ball would roll through, made a bowling game, <br/>
wanted to make and play with playdough, etc...So, for us, each day can be a <br/>
little different from the day before, but it works for us.  ~Karen</div>
