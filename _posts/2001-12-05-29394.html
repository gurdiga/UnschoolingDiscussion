<br/>
I have recently been diagnosed with AAADD - Age Activated <br/>
Attention Deficit Disorder. This is how it goes..... <br/>
I decide to wash the car, start toward the garage and noticed the mail on the <br/>
table. OK, I&#39;m going to wash the car... BUT FIRST I&#39;m going to go through <br/>
the mail. Lay car keys down on desk. After discarding the junk mail, I notice <br/>
the trash can is full. OK, I&#39;ll just put the bills on my desk.... BUT FIRST <br/>
I&#39;ll take the trash out, but since I&#39;m going to be near the mailbox, I&#39;ll address <br/>
a few bills.... Yes, Now where is the checkbook? Oops... there&#39;s only one <br/>
check left. Where did I put the extra checks? Oh, there&#39;s my empty plastic <br/>
cup from last night on my desk. I&#39;m going to look for those checks... BUT <br/>
FIRST I need to put the cup back in the kitchen. I head for the kitchen, look <br/>
out the window, notice the flowers need a drink of water, I put the cup on <br/>
the counter and there&#39;s my extra pair of glasses on the kitchen counter. <br/>
What are they doing here? I&#39;ll just put them away... BUT FIRST I need to <br/>
water those plants. I head for the door and... Aaaagh! Someone left the TV <br/>
remote in the wrong spot. Okay, I&#39;ll put the remote away and water the <br/>
plants... BUT FIRST I need to find those checks. END OF DAY: car not <br/>
washed, bills still unpaid, cup still in the sink, checkbook still has only <br/>
one check left, lost my car keys; and, when I try to figure out why nothing got <br/>
done today, I&#39;m baffled because... I KNOW I WAS BUSY ALL DAY! I realize <br/>
this condition is serious... I&#39;d get help... BUT FIRST... I think I&#39;ll check <br/>
my e-mail. Oops.....<br/>

<br/>
I can understand your frustration. I find some posts negative and not worth<br/>
reading. But this list has been helping me get over the demise of Growing<br/>
Without Schooling, so I hope it doesnt fold.<br/>
<br/>
I also think its probably more accessible to the general public than Sandra<br/>
s new list (which I havent had time to check out yet). I will be<br/>
recommending it to people who ask about unschooling, with the caveat that it<br/>
can get pretty nasty at times and that the most frequently asked questions<br/>
are probably best answered, at least at first, on the message boards.<br/>
<br/>
Its your decision whether to moderate this list or not, of course, and I<br/>
understand some peoples saying that would be a good idea, but it sounds<br/>
like a lot of work.<br/>
<br/>
I cant be bothered to keep track of who said what horrible thing to whom,<br/>
especially since these feuds seem to go way back, in some cases. So I just<br/>
skim and delete. So far nobody has attacked me so Ive just stayed out of<br/>
it, hoping it will die down.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you decide, please know that I appreciate your efforts.<br/>
<br/>
