<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975504408">I had a really busy week last week.  SCA business July 13 with the delivery <br/>
of the gift cello, trip to Espanola (90 miles) to get my niece so she could <br/>
attend every-day art lessons with Holly.  Driving people, extra kids, go go <br/>
go.  <br/>
<br/>
But Monday night a week ago, we went to CiCi&#39;s Pizza, Keith, two of my kids <br/>
(Kirby was at work) and Gina my sister&#39;s daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Gina is the girl in the article about my sister&#39;s kids having a school option.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;re at the pizza place, and in walks Paul McClure.  We invited him to <br/>
sit with us.  Paul is the dad of the family with the late readers, which is <br/>
still the featured article at www.unschooling.com (if you go there and click <br/>
on library, that will come up).  <br/>
<br/>
Paul is an ex marine and a city fire fighter.  Paul races bicycles up the <br/>
back of the Sandia Mountains (steep; vertical mile).  Paul has two teenaged <br/>
daughters.  They hang around our house quite a bit.  I thought, perhaps, as <br/>
Paul could kick the butts of our whole family if he took a mind to, that <br/>
perhaps I might want to reassure Paul that my boys were kindly souls with <br/>
honorable intentions.  Or something.<br/>
<br/>
So I was trying to work up to it, saying Renee and Julie had been over a lot <br/>
lately, with Kirby and his friends, and...  <br/>
<br/>
And he said, &quot;Yeah, I asked Chris (his oldest, 18, not living at home <br/>
anymore) what he thought about that, and he said he&#39;s hung out with that <br/>
bunch, and that he wouldn&#39;t worry about them, that they&#39;re just a bunch of <br/>
mellow geeks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES!  Paul didn&#39;t want to beat my husband and sons up!<br/>
<br/>
Hooray for mellow geekitude.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a kind of rarified atmosphere, sitting there with characters <br/>
from  two currently-in-view essays on kids, freedom and learning.  It was a <br/>
cool coincidence.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Gift cello?  Do you play? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I play recorder and guitar.  Keyboard less proficiently.  (I&#39;m going to <br/>
do a pump-organ accompaniment for one of the cello pieces.)<br/>
<br/>
But our friend Mike who rents our old house (who as Bohemond was Gunwaldt&#39;s <br/>
squire) had his cello stolen four or five years ago, and hadn&#39;t gotten <br/>
another one.  He was being made a Master of the Laurel (the big SCA arts <br/>
award, like an order of knighthood for artisans; he&#39;s already a knight), and <br/>
so a bunch of us went together to buy him a cello as a surprise, and so we <br/>
can get some live music going together again.  We used to have two cellists <br/>
and a bass recorder player and in the past few years they&#39;ve moved, wandered <br/>
away, etc.  So with Mike getting this cello together (it needed new strings, <br/>
and he bought a mute for duets so he won&#39;t drown out a single &quot;opponent&quot; <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), we&#39;re playing again!  I was over there last week going through pieces <br/>
he  had practiced (me on recorder) and helping pick some others.  It&#39;s cool!<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said he wants to learn recorder too.  So I showed him a three-note <br/>
harmony for a really pretty medieval piece called &quot;Edi Beo,&quot; which HAS to <br/>
have that harmony, but it&#39;s simple.  We&#39;ve done it with one vocalist (it&#39;s in <br/>
Middle English and my friend Barb, Holly&#39;s godmother, knows three verses by <br/>
memory in Middle English!) and three tuned water goblets.  That&#39;s some fun <br/>
impromptu music! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So...  <br/>
We gave him a cello bought on e-bay.  A new student model made in China.  Not <br/>
the cello of his dreams, but not the cheapest one on earth either.  Not even <br/>
the second cheapest. &lt;g&gt;  (Third cheapest, maybe.)  It came with a hard case <br/>
and soft case.  I got him a stand for it, a tuning fork, resin, a Dampit <br/>
(humidifier) and some music.  <br/>
<br/>
It was fun being the purchasing agent for our little company.<br/>
<br/>
And he got a piece of calligraphy with the names of the contributors.  Our <br/>
friend Maria did that.  I&#39;ll attach it.  Don&#39;t download it if you&#39;re already <br/>
bored&lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m AElflaed.  We put the names in order of length, shortest to <br/>
longest, just for a randomish way to do it.<br/>
