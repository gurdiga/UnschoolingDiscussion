&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve heard<br/>
 accounts of the same balderdash being spewed from neurologists to their<br/>
 patients, from many many MS sufferers on the support newsgroups &gt;&gt;<br/>

I have to add my 2 cents worth here.  I back up every word you&#39;ve said about <br/>
this.  It is exactly the same for lupus.  It&#39;s known as the great imitator <br/>
because it can look like so many other things.  From the time symptoms appear <br/>
until lupus is diagnosed is an average of 7 years.  Patients are often made <br/>
to feel that it&#39;s all in their heads.  My lupus involves my central nervous <br/>
system and so it almost perfectly mimics MS.  I went through the wringer with <br/>
doctors looking my MRIs over and telling me that there was nothing wrong with <br/>
me.  They said that my loss of vision (actually optic neuritis, of course) <br/>
and my numbness and weakness were just manifestations of hysteria.  I began <br/>
to feel terrible about myself and to question my own sanity.  Turns out I was <br/>
right and they were wrong. (blowing big raspberries here...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is searching for a diagnosis needs to know that they should RUN, <br/>
not walk from these patronizing, consdescending creeps.  <br/>

No you didn&#39;t offend me.  I was just saying where the info that I gave came <br/>
from.  : )  Should have put that smiley face there before so you would know I <br/>
was replying in a : ( face! LOL.<br/>
Thanks for the info.  My sister has Chronic Fatigue with Fibromyalgia.  This <br/>
neuro guy was trying to convince her she had MS, not CF. Maybe he likes those <br/>
letters better!  Anyway, she has let him slide.  He put her thru all kinds of <br/>
tests which she has already had, then told her there was no reason one of his <br/>
patients couldn&#39;t live alone, and put her in physical therapy and rehab.  <br/>
Now, with the problems she has, she does good to be able to have two good <br/>
days a week to do anything, the rest of the time she can&#39;t walk, or she can&#39;t <br/>
use her hands, or she is ill and can&#39;t get out of bed.  So, of course, she <br/>
got kicked out of therapy cause she had to cancel appointments.  This was no <br/>
big deal, as they were forcing her to do things she just couldn&#39;t do without <br/>
a great deal of pain, or just not at all.  When she started telling me this, <br/>
we live in different parts of the state, or I would have put an immediate <br/>
halt to all this rubbish, I told her to dump this guy stat.  He obviously <br/>
doesn&#39;t believe that CF exists, or he wouldn&#39;t be doing this.  So thats part <br/>
of sad tale.  She is in a great support group on the web, in fact, I think <br/>
she does an information news letter for her group.  This is the really only <br/>
type of group she can be in, as it dosen&#39;t matter if she misses a meeting <br/>
cause she can&#39;t get a ride there or can&#39;t walk that night, or whatever, she <br/>
can just go answer her email!<br/>
Thanks for your time, and I wish you good luck.<br/>

 The problem with most neurologists is that MS is not their<br/>
 specialty.Very few Neuros are up to date on MS.....there is no money to<br/>
 be made treating an MS patient.Drug companies put little effort into<br/>
 cure research because there is toooo much money to be made on treatment<br/>
 drugs.<br/>
 <br/>
 It&#39;s pretty much a health *maintenance* diseases like CFS or Arthritis.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found this to be very curious.  When I first became ill in 1993, I was very <br/>
weak and had trouble even washing off the kitchen table.  After weeks of <br/>
feeling this ill, I went to see my family doctor.  He thought that I had a <br/>
bone spur in my shoulder so he sent me to a neurosurgeon.  The neurosurgeon <br/>
did and MRI and then told me that I had MS.  He pointed out &quot;plaques&quot; on the <br/>
MRI and said that I would have to go see a neurologist, since his specialty <br/>
was surgery.  Well, it took weeks to get my appointment, and by the time I <br/>
did, I was feeling almost back to normal (except for the numbness and <br/>
tingling in my arms).  The neurologist refused to take the neurosurgeons word <br/>
for it and said that I had diagnosed myself!  He said that he could see <br/>
nothing wrong with me and that I was healthy as a horse.  He did say that my <br/>
blood pressure was extremely, extremely low (which probably, according to <br/>
him, cause the dizziness, weakness and other symptoms) so he said I should go <br/>
home and start eating alot of salt!   Well, I have tried (since new symptoms <br/>
have come and gone in the last few years---vision, problems with my legs, <br/>
pain and many others that I would really rather not go into) to see other <br/>
neurologists.  They always refuse to do any more MRIs or any other tests, and <br/>
instead hinted that all of this is in my head.  However, with all the pain I <br/>
had (and some other symptoms that cannot be faked), I knew this wasn&#39;t so.  <br/>
Finally a reumatologist said that since my killer T-cells were extremely low <br/>
and I had all the &quot;pain points&quot; that he thought I had CFIDS and Fibromyalgia. <br/>
 That has become my &quot;official&quot; diagnosis, even though a couple of my symptoms <br/>
don&#39;t match the criteria---and basically has my doctor very concerned.<br/>
Anyway, I have tried everything on my own, change in diet, natural medicine <br/>
and herbs, but nothing has helped.  Your info on the MRIs has been the first <br/>
I heard.  I have been told that my first MRI was &quot;nonconclusive&quot; (they said <br/>
that they could see &quot;something&quot; but weren&#39;t convinced that is was plaques <br/>
like the neurosurgeon said) and that they could see no reason for another <br/>
MRI, even though it has been a few years. They also said that since I didn&#39;t <br/>
have a conslusive MRI that I didn&#39;t have MS and there was no need to be <br/>
retested.   Therefore, I grasped at the diagnosis of CFIDS and <br/>
fibromyalgia----at least then I have a diagnosis!!-----and I have quit going <br/>
to doctors for a diagnosis.  Now the only doctor that I see is my family <br/>
doctor---who I like very much-----and he treats me for the pain and other <br/>
symtoms.  I figure that if it is something like MS, I will have to wait until <br/>
it is so obvious that it hits them over the head!  In the meantime, I will <br/>
just try to help myself as much as possible!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  will tell you this though ... the majority of auto immune disorder<br/>
 patients I&#39;ve had personal contact with have had to fight like hell to<br/>
 be treated decently and honestly.<br/>
 An informed patient has to tread carefully so as not to bruise doctors&#39;<br/>
 egos and get the treatment they deserve!!!!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>

Buzz,<br/>
    I agree, that is why I have given up for the time being!  The last time I <br/>
went to see a &quot;specialist&quot; that my family doctor referred me to, he gave me <br/>
all of 10 minutes of his time.  He said to me&quot;Well, if I just looked at your <br/>
history, I would say it was MS.<br/>
However, the neurologist (the one that was a jerk!) said that you don&#39;t.  <br/>
Therefore, I don&#39;t see any reason to have an MRI, because you don&#39;t have MS.  <br/>
It worries me that you have _______ with this, as this is usually indicative <br/>
of MS.  But once again, I just don&#39;t think it is because the neurologist said <br/>
that you don&#39;t have it.  I think you should start looking in another <br/>
direction.  I can&#39;t help you.&quot;  That was the last straw for me.  Basically, <br/>
he took one persons word (who believe me was such a jerk, that I would never <br/>
want to mess with her again) and refused to even examine me.  It didn&#39;t <br/>
matter that family went with me and tried to tell him how I am really sick, <br/>
he just didn&#39;t want to take the time.  If only I could see someone without <br/>
taking the records from that one doctor, however, they won&#39;t ever see me <br/>
unless I forward everything!  That one doctor is really hurting my case.  I <br/>
need to start off fresh, but it just won&#39;t happen.  I am so tired of beating <br/>
my head against a brick wall!  Well, sorry to go off like that, but this <br/>
subject is very touching to me.  Right now I am furious at doctors!<br/>
