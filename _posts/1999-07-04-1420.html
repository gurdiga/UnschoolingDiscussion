HASBRO RECALLS LIGHTSABER TOYS WITH FAULTY BATTERY COMPARTMENT <br/>
Attention parents of Star Wars fans. <br/>
The U.S. Consumer Product   Safety Commission and Hasbro Inc. are recalling<br/>
about 618,000   Star Wars Lightsaber toys for repair. The spring in the battery<br/>
  compartments of these toys can dislodge, causing a burning   hazard if the<br/>
batteries overheat or rupture. <br/>
Two models of   Lightsaber toys are involved in this recall. <br/>
<br/>
The Darth Maul(TM)   Double-Bladed Lightsaber with retractable red plastic &quot;light<br/>
  blades&quot; and a metallic-gray hand grip and <br/>
<br/>
The Qui-Gon Jinn(TM)   Lightsaber with a single retractable &quot;light blade&quot; made<br/>
of green   plastic that extends to about 3 feet. <br/>
Both Lightsaber toys   operate with two &quot;C&quot; batteries. Mass merchandise and<br/>
toy stores   nationwide sold these Lightsabers from May 1999 through June  <br/>
1999 for $20 to $30. <br/>
You can contact Hasbro to *get a free   repair kit containing instructions on<br/>
how to install a battery   protector. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
NATIONWIDE RECALL OF DIVE STICKS UNDERWAY <br/>
Do(es) your child(ren) use dive sticks in the swimming pool? If so, you   should<br/>
be aware that 19 million of these pool toys are being   recalled due to the<br/>
risk of facial, eye, rectal and vaginal   impalement, especially in shallow<br/>
water.<br/>
The dive sticks are   hard plastic and are either cylinder-shaped or shark-shaped.<br/>
  When dropped into water, the dive sticks sink to the bottom of a   pool and<br/>
stand upright so that children can swim or dive down   and retrieve them. The<br/>
sticks come in a variety of colors and   are often packaged in kits of three<br/>
to six, occasionally with   other pool diving games.<br/>
 They have been sold for about $4 to $7   per set under numerous brand names.<br/>
In some cases, a refund,   repair or replacement is available. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
*SOCK MONKEY RECALLED <br/>
Sewing needles and pins found in the stuffing of some Sock Monkey   stuffed<br/>
animals have prompted a recall from Restoration Hardware   Inc. and the U.S.<br/>
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).   These monkeys are about 16 to 20<br/>
inches tall and made of a brown   tweed-like knit fabric with white hands and<br/>
feet. Restoration   Hardware&#39;s stores, catalogs and web sites sold the monkeys<br/>
from   October 1997 through May 1999 for about $29. <br/>
You can return the   monkeys to any Restoration Hardware store for a refund<br/>
and a   discount merchandise certificate.<br/>

<br/>
*JUST IN: <br/>
ANOTHER RECALL OF INFANT CARRIERS <br/>
Parents of small infants, especially under 2 months of age,   should be extra<br/>
careful when using infant carriers. Following   the recall of the Baby Bjorn<br/>
infant carrier earlier this year,   the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission<br/>
(CPSC) and Evenflo   Company are recalling models 075 and 080 Snugli� soft infant<br/>
  carriers. As with the Baby Bjorn carrier, small babies can shift   to one<br/>
side, slip through the leg openings of these carriers and   fall. The carriers<br/>
are in color combinations of royal blue with   magenta trim, teal with navy<br/>
blue trim, and navy blue with   purple trim. Retail stores nationwide sold these<br/>
carriers   between January 1996 and May 1999 for about $40. Parents can   contact<br/>
Evenflo to receive instructions on how to <br/>
<br/>
*exchange the carrier for a free, new carrier with smaller leg   openings -<br/>

IS YOUR CHILD OVERWEIGHT? <br/>
Are you concerned about your child&#39;s weight? If so, you&#39;re not   alone.<br/>
 Between 1980 and 1994, the number of obese children in   the U.S. almost doubled,<br/>
with nearly 14 percent of all children   ages six to 11 now considered overweight.<br/>
Find out how you can   help keep your child&#39;s weight within the normal range<br/>
and   establish healthy habits that will last a lifetime from   *ParentTime.<br/>

<br/>
SAFE SUN FOR KIDS <br/>
Now that summer has officially started, it�s time to shield your   family from<br/>
the sun�s burning rays. Infants under six months   should be kept out of direct<br/>
sunlight altogether, but older kids   need sunscreen since 60%-80% of a person�s<br/>
sun exposure usually   happens before the age of 18.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are some safe sun tips: <br/>
<br/>
1. Don�t use sunscreens that are more than two or three years old   since heat<br/>
and age can diminish their effectiveness. <br/>
<br/>
2. Be generous when you apply. Use about an ounce - or a palmful   - to cover<br/>
your child�s exposed skin. (Studies show that most of   us tend to underapply).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. Don�t know what SPF is right for your child? <br/>
Consult the   *Coppertone Sun Safety Selector to find out. <br/>
<br/>
Find out more information about *keeping children safe in the sun   from the<br/>
American Academy of Pediatrics. <br/>
