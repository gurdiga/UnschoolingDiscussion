<div id="ygrps-yiv-764156715">My son loves to pick out books on tape from the library.  Last time <br/>
he was there, he picked out &quot;Learning to Read with Phonics: The Hear-<br/>
See-Say Approach to Easy Reading.&quot;  I told him that it wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>
story, that it was for teaching people to read.  He told me that was <br/>
great, because he wanted to learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
Last night he sat down at the table with the book and listened to all <br/>
three tapes.  They were awful.  It sounded like a teacher from some <br/>
nightmare class of six-year-old prisoners.  She&#39;d say, &quot;Now children, <br/>
what sound does A make?&quot;  and all the kids would say in unison, &quot;A <br/>
says /a/ as in apple.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Then she&#39;d tell them to read the column of words, and they&#39;d all <br/>
say, &quot;apple, at, and ...&quot; in unison. (You know that Pink Floyd movie <br/>
with all the kids in their school uniforms?  It was like that).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why my son kept listening.  He was following along in <br/>
the book, too.  So I just stayed out of it and figured maybe it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem weird to him, or maybe he likes hearing the kids&#39; voices <br/>
on the tape. Or maybe he&#39;s learning phonics and that will unlock <br/>
reading for him.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the third tape was done and he closed the book and said, in <br/>
a voice that sounded very much like a teenager (though he&#39;s still <br/>
four years old), &quot;Now _that_ was _truly_ scary!&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
We have a set of Sing Spell Read Write for older kids.. ( I dont really <br/>
recall how I aquired it.. maybe a yard sale...)  Anyway, no had ever  opened  <br/>
it, til recently.. Ethan found it and asked what it was.  We put the video <br/>
tape in and had a good old laugh.. It was just like you are describing.. ( <br/>
except you could see the &quot;actors&quot;)  GOD it was fake and stiff and weird.   We <br/>
watched the video for pure entertainment and poking fun fodder for about 15 <br/>
minutes.. Then, back into the box it went.. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You captured your son perfectly, so many times the kids have done<br/>
something like this, it like a kodak moment, you vow to remember<br/>
it and than its gone.<br/>
Hooked on phonics can be pretty scarey also. <br/>
The repetition is meant for women better than me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing.<br/>

brains.  This is a good example of just the opposite.  Wish all the parents I <br/>
know would allow their children to make up their own minds about things.  <br/>
Such a great story.<br/>

they need. <br/>
