<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199784566">The cameras were rolling when a mini bus pulled up in front of a <br/>
local Winn Dixie Supermarket. This was to me, the most shocking 60 <br/>
minutes ever aired on TV! About 20 people got off the bus and the <br/>
cameras followed these people throughout the store. Each person <br/>
systematcally filled their carts with everything you could imagine, <br/>
groceries, film, pet needs, baby goods, cleaners, toiletries, etc. <br/>
Then one by one they went to the cashier and had their orders rung <br/>
up. The smallest order was in the neighborhood of $600.00. They are <br/>
all members of a program at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wrldofproducts.com">http://www.wrldofproducts.com</a> One by one <br/>
they presented the coupons that they receive from this program and <br/>
the deducutions began. The most anyone had to pay was $19.66 and even <br/>
that person had an overflowing cart! I joined this program minutes <br/>
after the show aired and I still can&#39;t believe my eyes when week <br/>
after week I leave the supermarket with a full cart of products for <br/>
next to nothing!<br/>
