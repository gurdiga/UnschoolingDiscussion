<div id="ygrps-yiv-328303654">I have had a long conversation with a graduate student at UC Berkeley - <br/>
he is in the journalism department. To meet one of his requirements, he <br/>
is making a 25 minutes documentary film and he is interested in doing <br/>
it on unschooling. I found him to be well read on the subject and very <br/>
pro-unschooling. He&#39;s still a bit vague on exactly what he intends to <br/>
include in the film - still open to ideas - but would like to show <br/>
unschoolers just &quot;living their lives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out that following my family around for a day could be <br/>
incredibly boring - how long is it going to be interesting to watch us <br/>
all sitting around typing on our computers, reading books, watching tv, <br/>
taking naps &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But - this could be great and I&#39;d like to lend him a hand. He wants to <br/>
find real unschoolers - not people who are simply relaxed homeschoolers <br/>
or eclectic homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you are in California and would like to talk to him about <br/>
maybe being one of the families featured in his documentary, please <br/>
email me at &lt;pamsoroosh @ mac.com&gt;.<br/>

incredibly boring - how long is it going to be interesting to watch us<br/>
all sitting around typing on our computers, reading books, watching tv,<br/>

<br/>
Our &quot;exciting&quot; day yesterday included standing in line to vote, playing <br/>
videogames, listening to a book on tape, quilting, and searching for <br/>
dad&#39;s lost keys.  The biggest drama of the day was me convincing my <br/>
husband to cook most of dinner so I could finish my project.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I did point out one of the earliest red states on the map (Oklahoma) <br/>
and then somehow we talked about the &quot;four corners&quot; area.  Then my son <br/>
asked for the big map of the U.S. and jumped on it a little.  (Hey, a <br/>
visual illustration of kinesthetic learning.)  But I don&#39;t think anyone <br/>
would want to watch us for 10 hours to get the pulse pounding excitement <br/>
&lt;g&gt; of those 10 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of fun to imagine a montage of unschooling scenes, but mostly <br/>
I think learning is not very visual.  I guess kids that do art projects <br/>
or raise animals would be the most photogenic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092666017">We too might be boring but there are some days that are pretty exciting.  Our <br/>
debates about the best power to have in a video game battle given choices  <br/>
from Poke&#39;mon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Teen Titans and King Arthur&#39;s court - including Merlin. <br/>
 This is one of the debates least likely to get the general public up in <br/>
arms.  When you add in that we also discussed whether we would want to include the <br/>
 Greek Gods and then the Christian God too and whether or not Jesus really <br/>
had  what we called a SuperPower or if that was his Dad&#39;s power really, well <br/>
then  things got interesting but not really something I would expose most of the  <br/>
general public to, LOL! <br/>
 <br/>
Field trips are fun with lots visual interaction and vocal discussion  <br/>
(again, sometimes the discussions are not fit for others though since I put no  <br/>
limits on ideas or verbal choices unless it is hurtful to someone else or  <br/>
profanity). My son and daughter can be pretty outspoken, which I really like,  and <br/>
are also polite. But the point is that our family debates and discussions  would <br/>
really have to be edited for political correctedness to be on video.<br/>
 <br/>
We do a lot of learning when we shop, go swimming, take walks, drive to  <br/>
Grandma&#39;s. I am not sure how much of watching a family run around and then sit  <br/>
quietly at the table would interest the public though. A lot of my son&#39;s  <br/>
learning - he is ADHAD and Autistic which was more challenging at public school  - <br/>
is done with computer and video games. All text has to be read aloud and the  <br/>
words he learns - and learns the meanings of - are pretty advanced since he is  <br/>
way past the &quot;kiddie games&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
Okay, that is my 2 cents worth! Have wonderful day all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866401900">Whenever I do interviews they always want to photograph or film my <br/>
kids &quot;unschooling&quot;.  It&#39;s the nature of the media.  The good <br/>
reporters will spend days with us and find something spontaneous but <br/>
I usually just invite them along on an outing or stage something in <br/>
the house that we&#39;d be doing anyway and then I explain the real <br/>
unschooling going on is my kids meeting interesting people, learning <br/>
about journalism, how to conduct an interview, the media and <br/>
photography.  They never get it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786850471">Hey Holly,<br/>
<br/>
I want to invite you to join TXModerators, a list I started for owners/moderators of unschooling groups across the state of Texas.  It&#39;s a low volume list and there are 10 members so far from differing regions.  The purpose is unschooling networking.  We&#39;d like all of Texas to be our unschooling community and for unschoolers to know each other by attending events across the state instead of just the Rethinking Education conference once a year.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone brings a different perspective to the group.  I&#39;d love for yours to be there.  Please join us.<br/>

<br/>
But - this could be great and I&#39;d like to lend him a hand. He wants to <br/>
find real unschoolers - not people who are simply relaxed homeschoolers <br/>
or eclectic homeschoolers. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to say first up that I am a cynic, or maybe just paranoid. I hope<br/>
that I am wrong. The idea that he is vague about what he wants to show makes<br/>
me go &quot;hmmmm.&quot; I have worked on plenty of UCLA grad thesis films, and one<br/>
thing I do know is the student directors take the work very seriously - this<br/>
film is something they intend to use as a calling card for professional<br/>
work. They do whatever it takes to make it good, not just for the grade.<br/>
&quot;Good&quot; means has the possibility of being sellable and/or getting into the<br/>
better festivals. <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to remind anyone concerned about the concept of looking boring<br/>
- documentaries are made in the editing room. Massive amounts are usually<br/>
shot and the footage is then cut - for effect, for commentary, for humor,<br/>
for impact, for controversy, for irony. Just because it is a documentary<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that the fundamentals of filmmaking don&#39;t apply, and 25 minutes<br/>
is a long time. Rule one: the only thing that holds interest is conflict. If<br/>
there is no conflict happening in the story or between the characters, then<br/>
there needs to be conflict between the on screen world and the audience&#39;s<br/>
perceptions and prior understanding, beliefs and expectations. Even the most<br/>
innocuous day can be intercut with other days or people to look...different.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you an entirely hypothetical example. Suppose he has masses of<br/>
footage of several families&#39; kids playing video games &quot;all day long&quot;. This<br/>
is dull on screen. So he interviews someone, some education expert talking<br/>
about the &quot;dangers of electronic media&quot;. He can probably find plenty of<br/>
experts in his own faculty at UCB. He intercuts between &quot;statements&quot; and the<br/>
kids playing, and playing. This is starting to look interesting. <br/>
<br/>
OK now for some humor...he shows some footage of one of the mothers talking<br/>
about the variety of cool things their family does each day. Then he<br/>
intercuts between that &quot;enthusiasm&quot; and the kids still playing, and playing,<br/>
and playing video games. OK. <br/>
<br/>
Now his documentary needs some serious social commentary. So he interviews<br/>
some health person who talks about the growing trend of obesity and<br/>
unfitness amongst youngsters, or RSI, or eye damage, and then intercuts with<br/>
the kids, now with the lights on because night has apparently fallen, still<br/>
supposedly playing the video games. Maybe just to cap it off, he shows one<br/>
kid calling out for some food, and Mom bringing in something, as we often<br/>
all do. Well that takes care of a good seven minutes of his documentary, and<br/>
he is starting to look like an employable director who can generate conflict<br/>
and insert a point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, I&#39;m a cynic AND paranoid - but I was a student making films for grades<br/>
once too. Don&#39;t show him this email - he may get ideas from it. <br/>
<br/>
The only person I would trust to make a documentary that did not end up<br/>
making unschoolers look like oddballs at best would be another unschooler,<br/>
like Cameron Lovejoy for example. Hey maybe we *are* oddballs.<br/>

If he&#39;s never met many real unschooling families, he probably doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
good idea WHAT he wants to show, or what&#39;s showable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in correspondence with him, and it&#39;s interesting and it&#39;s good that he&#39;s <br/>
not on some newspaper deadline as most interviewers are.<br/>
<br/>

there is no conflict happening -=-<br/>
<br/>
If the whole audience is invested in school (university students/professors), <br/>

with what they think they&#39;re sure they know.<br/>

Why would you want to withhold ideas from someone??<br/>

unschooling was - how really totally different from schooling it would <br/>
be, until he&#39;d already gotten approval for the project and gotten his <br/>
advisor all excited over it. (He may be on this list, if so - <br/>

few days might not make for a great film - I&#39;m not sure he really got <br/>
it how boring that could really be.<br/>
<br/>
His idea for the &quot;conflict&quot; is that he wants to find a family with kids <br/>
who have unschooled and then gone to school - so he can show the <br/>

<br/>
I may have to run out and join Control Freaks Anonymous &lt;g&gt;, but I was thinking that the only unschooling documentary I would be really, really comfortable would be if somehow I (and other unschooling families) were handed big piles of film about our lives, and each of us could edit it ourselves to show what we want shown.  (Hey, this is what every politician wants, too.)<br/>

When cameras are really cheap, and we all know how to use editing software, it would be fun to do a project like that for showing at a conference or for putting on an unschooling site on the web.<br/>

PS   Last thought:  I think the biggest fear I have about an unschooling documentary is that the general audience is prejudiced against play.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wrong about that.  And that kind of preconception is a hard thing to overcome with film footage.</div>

<br/>
When his first query was posted on the HSC list, and also came around to <br/>
my San Jose group the request was for an unschooling family with a kid <br/>
at home and a kid at school.  That profile just doesn&#39;t fit very many <br/>
families out of a small population to start with.<br/>
<br/>
There is a bricks and mortar charter school in Redwood City with an <br/>
enrollment of under 400 kids (I think) and based on social chitchat at <br/>
least a few of those kids were homeschooled up to a year or two years <br/>
ago.  (I don&#39;t know if any of them were unschoolers.)  Maybe he could <br/>
find some interesting stories there, but it seems likely that the <br/>
principal will want to control what is &quot;published&quot; about his/her <br/>
school.  (There&#39;s a second storyline there about how the charter school <br/>
is different from high school as most of us experienced it.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Sudbury school in Concord that struggles with low enrollment.  <br/>
They might be motivated to allow filming if it would give them positive <br/>
film clips that they could use on their website as a marketing tool.  <br/>
(Or they might be as uptight about their kids&#39; privacy as I am.)<br/>

That is the kind of conflict behind many documentaries - the difference<br/>
between what people think they know and what they then find out. A better<br/>
word might be &quot;tension&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If it is a graduate thesis film I would have thought the hope would be to<br/>
gain a wider audience than just his teachers, in the fullness of time. Maybe<br/>
journalism is different from film studies in that respect. <br/>

The &quot;ideas&quot; I was talking about are ideas that would be at our expense. They<br/>
are ways to make his film more interesting, but make us and unschooling,<br/>
look stupid - buying into wider misconceptions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really happy to hear that he is getting information and ideas from you,<br/>
Sandra, which are unlikely to be negatively slanted while being disguised as<br/>
&quot;balance&quot;. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, we bought a copy. I think it is well shot compositionally and tightly<br/>
edited. That&#39;s why I believe he has the makings of a good filmmaker. Boy,<br/>
have I seen (and worked on) a lot of student and first time director films.<br/>
His is so much better than most.<br/>

Perhaps someone can arrange to borrow one from a school??  We have a local<br/>

Now someone in the group owns a projector.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980868045">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Some kids DO play videos all day.  It&#39;s what they need then.  If<br/>
they&#39;re enthusiastic about it, what difference does it make?  After<br/>
all, isn&#39;t that the point of unschooling?--for children to decide<br/>
what&#39;s best for them and what they need? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh for crying out loud! My hypothetical concern was not that the kids<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be playing vid games all day, or any other activity, if that is<br/>
where they are at. I&#39;m a proponent of free choice of activities and the<br/>
electronic media as a resource, if you have ever read anything I have ever<br/>
written on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
My worry was that once the footage is in the can the filmmaker is free to<br/>
manipulate it any way he wants with editing for an effect. And the effect<br/>
could be to make us look dumb or neglectful or deluded, even though we all<br/>
know we aren&#39;t any of these things.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s moot now, since further information shows that this guy is moving in a<br/>
different direction, one that sounds very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
It was more along the lines of the experiences that some people have had, in<br/>
dealing with interviewers or the print media, of sometimes having their<br/>
words misquoted or taken out of context. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It seems like you&#39;re embarassed that it might be portrayed that way.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not embarrassed. Wary of being made to look bad for the sake of someone&#39;s<br/>
grade or entertainment. Again. Can anyone say CBS?<br/>
<br/>
I work in the film business. It is full of people who are pragmatic, cynical<br/>
and focused on the bottom line. It is full of people who can spin a good<br/>
line to get what they want - they usually become producers or location<br/>
managers. There is a reason why so much of politics seems to be like the<br/>
entertainment business. Both are founded on manipulating information for<br/>
emotional response. And of course the governor of California has turned out<br/>
to be a way better actor than anyone might have supposed from his early<br/>
work. <br/>

&lt;&lt; The reason he is vague is, I think, that he hadn&#39;t understood what <br/>
unschooling was - how really totally different from schooling iwould <br/>
be, until . . . &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How could he NOT be vague, really?<br/>
Most people who have declared &quot;we<br/>
Z&#39;re going to unschool&quot; are vague about it for the first few months, and they <br/>
have kids and are actually trying to do it.   <br/>
<br/>
Vague is WAY better than what mainstream folk know about what unschooling <br/>
might be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-His idea for the &quot;conflict&quot; is that he wants to find a family with kids <br/>
who have unschooled and then gone to school - so he can show the <br/>
contrast - look at schooling through an unschooler&#39;s eyes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Will college count?<br/>
<br/>
Because in some cases (maybe most) kids who go back to school were unhappy <br/>
with the way unschooling was going, or unhappy at home, and he might not get the <br/>
best of unschooling that way.   And the same way people villify their ex <br/>
boyfriend or former religion or old job to help feel better about the new one, to <br/>
keep from feeling pangs of longing, kids who change styles of learning <br/>
probably do that same thing.  I think it&#39;s human nature.  <br/>

<br/>
The point was not whether video games were ok to play but what non<br/>
unschooling viewers of the documentary could conclude about unschooling<br/>
if unschoolers were portrayed as neglectful for &quot;allowing&quot; unlimited<br/>
video game play. <br/>
<br/>
Because the popular belief is that access to and time spent on video<br/>
games should be limited. <br/>
<br/>
Google returned 297,000 hits on a search of &quot;children video game play<br/>
limits&quot;  suggesting that many believe video game play by children should<br/>
be limited.  A family that does not limit video game play might then look<br/>
neglectful or just plain stupid to non unschooling outsiders.  Do you<br/>
really believe traditional, mainstream parents think unlimited video game<br/>
play is healthy?   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an blurb from one especially sickening bit:<br/>
<br/>
*Both younger children and teenagers should be limited to one hour of<br/>
playing time per day, Monday to Friday.<br/>
<br/>
It is important for children of all ages to understand that homework and<br/>
household chores take priority over video games. While video game playing<br/>
time can be extended on weekends, it is important for parents to<br/>
encourage other means of recreational play.<br/>
<br/>
Make video game playing  a PRIVILEGE, not a RIGHT This approach allows<br/>
you to use video games as a reward for positive behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
Set time limits Set a daily limit for video game playing and set aside a<br/>
specific period each day for the activity.<br/>
<br/>
Homework comes first Explain to your child that homework and chores come<br/>
first. Take away video game playing privileges if your  child fails to<br/>
complete his homework or chores. You  may also choose to use video games<br/>
as part of a reward  system by extending his play time or renting a new<br/>
game when he puts extra effort  into his chores or homework.*<br/>

This is one reason why I&#39;m a bit worried about an interview that&#39;s  coming up in a couple days.  Yet, I&#39;m going to go into it hoping that she&#39;s wanting to learn something and she&#39;s going to try and get my point across.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I decided to do the interview for the local newspaper. The interview is about homeschooling, but she wants to show the different approaches.  I have my notes and I&#39;ve talked to the kids a bit too about the whole thing.  The whole video game thing could be interesting because my son is a video game guru. :)  It is his passion and its shown me so much about him and his learning. I&#39;m planning on handing her Pam L.&#39;s article on video game playing and a Life Learning magazine.  If the talk goes in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This thread has gotten me thinking about how things can be manipulated,  again.  <br/>

It was the *content* of what was (hypothetically) being juxtaposed that<br/>
would cast a negative light, especially for viewers who didn&#39;t know anything<br/>
else about u/s, on the constant appearing gaming, not the gaming itself.<br/>
 <br/>
Expert on the harm electronic media does = unschoolers dangerously ignorant <br/>
<br/>
Mother talking about lots of activities vs only seeing one constantly =<br/>
unschoolers deluded or humorously naive<br/>
<br/>
Expert making medical warning statements = unschoolers willfully neglectful<br/>
of kids&#39; health.<br/>
<br/>
To outsiders. To people for whom this might be their introduction to<br/>
Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter now. The filmmaker is in contact with Sandra and Pam, and<br/>
they are evidently convinced he is going to create an accurately positive,<br/>
sympathetic portrayal. That&#39;s good enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just don&#39;t like it when someone *seems* to be repeatedly,<br/>
willfully misunderstanding me. Was my writing really that unclear in the<br/>
original post?<br/>
<br/>
I was making a comment on how filmmakers can and do use tricks to manipulate<br/>
information, *not* on the actions of the unschoolers. This kind of &quot;reading&quot;<br/>
television and movies critically, so that we can be aware of the tricks<br/>
being employed is something that I hope Jayn will gain from some of our<br/>
family viewing. We talk a lot about the technical aspects of what we are<br/>
seeing: SFX, mis-en-scene, editing, acting.<br/>

Alex, was this a typo or are you just not reading carefully yourself? The<br/>
point that Deb was making is that the vast majority think that unlimited<br/>
video gaming is a *very bad* thing, and also that parental control is the<br/>
foundation of good parenting. Because this is what they are being told<br/>
repeatedly, from many mainstream sources.<br/>
<br/>
Even if our children are seen to be playing video games all day, it is still<br/>
not the whole picture, as most of us do see the other things our children<br/>
manage to squeeze in around the gaming, and all the wondrous things they are<br/>
learning from gaming. It would only be a truly balanced portrayal if these<br/>
other things were also shown and elucidated.<br/>
