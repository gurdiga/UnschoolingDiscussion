Here&#39;s my 2 cents. <br/>
1. Fundamentalist parenting is scary. Deciding you believe in one <br/>
methodology <br/>
or book, and only following that, from what I see, spells disaster. <br/>
It&#39;s ok not <br/>
to follow the book, in fact, it&#39;s a good idea not to follow the book <br/>
all the <br/>
time, or you would be crazy. I doubt Sear&#39;s, Waldorf, or any of them <br/>
can <br/>
actually totally practice what they preach, and my friends who only <br/>
follow one <br/>
dogma or another have problems with their kids just like everyone <br/>
else. <br/>
2. Home Schooled Children and Parents are Horrible People who have NO <br/>
regard <br/>
for anyone but themselves. <br/>
How could I make such a sweeping statement? <br/>
When I opened Urban Monster, I made a pact to be a community <br/>
resource, open to <br/>
all, and make my space available to ANYONE who needed it for relevant <br/>
purpose, <br/>
etc... Now, this remains true to all, but the NY Home Schooling <br/>
Association and <br/>
their kind or whatever they are called. I offered up my space for <br/>
a &quot;invitation <br/>
only&quot; story telling event private to the NY Home Schooling <br/>
Association. They <br/>
came in droves, destroyed my place, yelled at me, destroyed <br/>
merchandise, the <br/>
parents were even worse behaved than the little heathens they called <br/>
their <br/>
spawn. <br/>
There were other things I had committed to, but of course, after the <br/>
story <br/>
telling nightmare, how could we go on. Various members would call me <br/>
asking me <br/>
all sorts of questions about my space, have I tested for lead? what <br/>
is my <br/>
insurance policy? poking around my basement and storeroom. No one was <br/>
the <br/>
leader of this group? The leader of the group claimed she wasn&#39;t <br/>
responsible <br/>
for these subcommittees driving me bonkers on my phone, in meetings <br/>
in my space. <br/>
I get A LOT of kids in here. No group of children are worse behaved <br/>
than home <br/>
schooled heathens, who grab things, stick them in their mouths, seven <br/>
year olds <br/>
jumping in my strollers, knocking things over and leaving them there. <br/>
When I <br/>
ask the parents, &quot;could you ask your child to pick that up?&quot; they <br/>
actually throw <br/>
me shade as though I&#39;m ruining little baby&#39;s personality. Heck, the <br/>
little nut <br/>
is ruining my place, and it&#39;s pretty hard to trash my place, really. <br/>
The parents are even worse. Snobby politically correct wind bags, <br/>
whom none <br/>
seem to have real jobs that I can see. <br/>
They are politically correct righteous wannabe anarchists who don&#39;t <br/>
care about <br/>
anyone but themselves. Heck, I&#39;m a non-conformist F$%&*CK BUSH kind <br/>
of gal, <br/>
but I would never leave my child without discipline or an <br/>
understanding of what <br/>
it means to behave in a group. <br/>
Trust me this is not an option you want to jump head first into, just <br/>
cause the <br/>
book is cool. <br/>
I can spot a home school group from a mile a way. That is about the <br/>
only <br/>
terrorist disaster I see using my duct tape for. Yikes. <br/>
Phshew. <br/>

This is a BUSINESS owner making this sweeping statement!! I am <br/>
thinking this woman needs some sort of a response. Even if you DON&#39;T <br/>
live in NY. Either in writing to her email address, store address or <br/>
in giving her store a call. But I hope that all of us will think <br/>
twice before actually BUYING stuff from her...        Jennifer</div>
