<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402562489"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: nancy sebastian &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:squirlygirl1970@...">squirlygirl1970@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;Question. what about math or<br/>
&gt; english. He hates reading. what do you suggest on<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>..............<br/>
What are your overall goals for &quot;reading?&quot;  Being able to read something and<br/>
get the information he wants from the material?  He will eventually want to<br/>
know something about his current video game and will need to read to figure<br/>
out how to get past something hard--you&#39;ve heard of &quot;walk-throughs?&quot;   Also,<br/>
he may be reading while he plays his video game.  My kids are playing Animal<br/>
Crossing right now--that requires constant reading.    Is being able to<br/>
communicate in writing one of your goals for him?   Does he email or instant<br/>
message other kids?  If he does, he gets instant feedback on his writing.<br/>
We enjoy the yahoo email list unschooling_gamers.  My kids are getting a<br/>
little tired of Runescape, but for a while they played that for hours<br/>
everyday.  (www.runescape.com --it&#39;s free)  They had to type to be able to<br/>
communicate with the other players on line.  In fact, my kids learned so<br/>
much cool stuff playing that game!!  And I had fun hanging out with them or<br/>
talking to them about Runescape.  If we had had another computer, I would<br/>
have had my own character!<br/>
<br/>
he wants to make video games later in life and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that requires alot of math. any suggestions.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>.............................<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have to learn the math that he might need later right now--it can<br/>
wait.   The school system has convinced people that math must be taught a<br/>
little bit at a time and in a particular order.  That&#39;s rubish--it&#39;s just<br/>
not based on good science!   Also, my kids aren&#39;t interested in making their<br/>
video games, but there are resources out there that will help him create his<br/>
own video games--now, not &quot;when he grows up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A lot of published authors have said that if you want to be a great writer,<br/>
then read a lot.  I think the same logic could be applied here:  If your son<br/>
wants to make video games, he should experience (&quot;play&quot;) lots of video<br/>
games.  And my kids loved flipping through this book:  The Ultimate History<br/>
of Video Games: From Pong to Pokemon--The Story Behind the Craze That<br/>
Touched Our Lives and Changed the World by Steven L. Kent  I just found the<br/>
exact title by going to Amazon.com and searching for &quot;video game history.&quot;<br/>
But we checked it out of the library when we read it.  There were several<br/>
other books that came up from my search--check it out!<br/>
<br/>
im really<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; new at this. and i really am going to work on this.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>........................<br/>
<br/>
Besides this list, I really enjoy reading the yahoo group, unschooling<br/>
basics.   You might want to check that one out, too.<br/>
