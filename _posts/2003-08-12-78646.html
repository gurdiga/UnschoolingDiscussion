<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823960886">It would seem that not all children would pick up reading naturally, <br/>
because most people&#39;s experience causes them to panick when the child <br/>
is NATURALLY a later reader.<br/>
If there is no pressure to read, if there is no shame in not being <br/>
able to read, then I believe that all children (of those that have <br/>
the capability to read) will read naturally, in their own way and <br/>
time.<br/>
If a child is struggling, they aren&#39;t ready.<br/>
<br/>
In your 3 out of 4 scenario Teresa, I would venture to say that child <br/>
would have learned quite naturally given more time. Some children <br/>
want to read for the wrong reasons..they don&#39;t know that. Undue <br/>
pressure has caused them to feel bad (not necessarily from the <br/>
parent) and they want it even though they may not be neurologically <br/>
ready.<br/>
Even a child with real live disabilities can learn in their own way <br/>
and time, naturally. It will be much later and a much different way <br/>
than other readers perhaps, but then that&#39;s what unschooling is all <br/>
about, uniqueness. Honoring the individual no matter what the <br/>
differences are or when the reading happens is so important.<br/>
<br/>
And I think if a child really, really wants to read, the parent needs <br/>
to be creative enough to find what method makes it fun and easy. If <br/>
the child isn&#39;t pushing themSELVES, then you risk damage.<br/>
<br/>
My Jared could easily be categorized as a child that &quot;struggles&quot; with <br/>
reading. Truth is, he just doesn&#39;t care that much yet. Instead of <br/>
trying to find some amazing method that will help his &quot;disabilities&quot; <br/>
(which I don&#39;t believe exist in this child) I am being patient.<br/>
He&#39;ll read when he&#39;s ready, of that I&#39;m quite sure. (He&#39;ll be 10 in a <br/>
couple of weeks)<br/>
My biggest challenge is how to ward of well meaning family and <br/>
friends that are convinced I&#39;m ruining him by not making him learn to <br/>
read!<br/>

and just didn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; to read.  What about the older people who worked on <br/>

 <br/>
Do you think it was because of a disability that they never really learned on <br/>
their own?  <br/>
<br/>
Was it because they didn&#39;t want it badly enough?<br/>
<br/>
Was it because they were never &quot;taught&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Your post on it being a natural thing that would come in time just made me <br/>
really think.  I knew an elderly man when I was growing up that would look at <br/>
the newspapers (I thought reading them when I was much littler), write his name <br/>
all the time on papers (just for fun it seemed).  Never once did it occur to <br/>
me that he couldn&#39;t read.  Not even when he bought grits at the store instead <br/>
of oatmeal because the box looked the same (days before the pretty pictures <br/>
bombarded us).<br/>
<br/>
I later learned that he was horrified that I had found out he couldn&#39;t read <br/>
the day he opened the box of grits with me standing there.  He wanted to be a <br/>
reader, he just never learned.  This was a very smart man, he held a job for <br/>
many years that no one can understand how he kept others from knowing he <br/>
couldn&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
At one time there were a LOT of non readers.  Do you think it was from not <br/>
many books around?  Lack of things to learn with?  Or simply a lack of <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Our unschooling minds tell us it must be something else, because lack of <br/>
teaching does not mean a lack of learning, unless the ability to read isn&#39;t <br/>
natural.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not arguing either side, just thinking about it and wondering what others <br/>
think about the non readers in the world, past and present.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the gentleman above, he lived to be 79 and never learned to read and was <br/>
very ashamed of that fact.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721542211">I thought of all of that too, Glena.   I wrote a long reply.. but I didnt <br/>
send it. Whats the use??   I said I didn&#39;t want to argue, and I don&#39;t.    But. <br/>
along with your questions, I have this to add<br/>
<br/>
My daddy is 60 years old.  He dropped out of school at 14 to work on the <br/>
farm, he was in the 8th grade.   He is a functioning illiterate.  He can read at a <br/>
very rudimentary level.   He lived with a wife who loved to read, read aloud <br/>
to all of us OFTEN.. We read aloud to our daddy very often.. We would ( and <br/>
still do) read his mail aloud to him.  Our home was filled with books and <br/>
magazines. Now he has 10 grandchildren who love to read to him. ( oh, except for the <br/>
4 yo)  He held a job as a supervisor of a textile manufacturer for 15 years.  <br/>
He faked his way along.   He has been a successful tree farmer for 20 years.  <br/>
He is a millionaire (maybe a multi one)  Why didn&#39;t he learn to read?    <br/>
Reading is not natural for my daddy.  It confuses and befuddles him, it is <br/>
frustrating and exhausting.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funny you should mention this. After reading the &quot;natural&quot; vs. &quot;learned&quot; <br/>
theories regarding reading, I too thought of people I knew/know who are <br/>
illiterate. I can&#39;t argue either side and really feel it was one or the other. I guess <br/>
maybe it is dependent on the person. How&#39;s that for evasive?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, much like the man in the post, my maternal grandfather could not <br/>
read. Having left school at the age of 8 or 9, to bury his father and begin to <br/>
work to help feed his 11 siblings, he never read beyond a very minimal level. He <br/>
always had newpapers, but he was looking at the pictures not reading the news. <br/>
When I would sit on his lap and ask him to read to me, he always said, &quot;No, <br/>
you read to me...show me how smart you are.&quot; I was probably about 8 or 9 when I <br/>
realized I was reading to him, because he couldn&#39;t read to me. I cried. I <br/>
thought it was horrible and unfair that no one had taught him how. I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand how he got through life without it. He never learned. It became <br/>
unimportant to him, because he was able to work around it. I never told him I knew he <br/>
couldn&#39;t read. He was a strong and proud Irishman, who I know found shame in <br/>
his illiteracy. But by the same token, he was too proud to try and learn.<br/>
<br/>
As for the natural position, well I can say I really honestly don&#39;t remember <br/>
not being able to read. But even my parents say no one ever taught me. It was <br/>
just something I could do. So perhaps for me it was natural. I read long <br/>
before I ever went to school. So I wasn&#39;t taught by the system. <br/>
<br/>
While I have no answer to whether it is or isn&#39;t natural to learn to read, I <br/>
wonder why the process has to be one or the other. Perhaps it is both. A <br/>
natural tendancy to learn to read??? I don&#39;t know.<br/>

<br/>
My grandfather and grandmother went to school, farm schools, just until 2nd <br/>
grade, and both could read, so I&#39;m not sure who you&#39;re thinking of.  I have <br/>
seen houses (and not just in the 50&#39;s, in the 70&#39;s) in which there was not one <br/>
scrap of printed word.  In Protestant houses there&#39;s usually at least a Bible, <br/>
but in Catholic houses, sometimes zip.  Not newspapers.  How will kids learn to <br/>
read if there&#39;s nothing to learn WITH?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; BUT there are some grown elderly men <br/>
of several generations ago that could NOT read. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Several generations ago there were no closed-caption TV shows being broadcast <br/>
freely into the air.  Several generations ago there weren&#39;t free <br/>
newspapers/flyers/advertisements outside every grocery store.  There weren&#39;t labels and <br/>
printed boxes and billboards and streetsigns everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you think it was because of a disability that they never really learned <br/>
on <br/>
their own?  <br/>
&lt;&lt;Was it because they didn&#39;t want it badly enough?<br/>
&lt;&lt;Was it because they were never &quot;taught&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re making an incredibly spurious argument to try to defend your position <br/>
that learning to read won&#39;t come to every unschooled child whose parents read <br/>
to him, who have lots of books and other written-word materials all around.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I knew an elderly man when I was growing up that would look at <br/>

all the time on papers (just for fun it seemed).  Never once did it occur to <br/>
me that he couldn&#39;t read.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had one aunt who couldn&#39;t read at all.  She was crushed to powder by school <br/>
and mean,cruel, abusive parents who told her early on she was stupid, and hit <br/>
her a LOT.   <br/>
<br/>
The conditions I believe led to her illiteracy exist in not ONE unschooling <br/>
household.<br/>
<br/>
My dad couldn&#39;t read very quickly or very well, but he could read.  He was <br/>
crushed by school and shamed and punished for not reading early enough to suit <br/>
them.  He was told he should be as good as his younger brothers, who were good <br/>
students.  They were also right handed and were encouraged to be right handed. <br/>
 My dad was left handed, and FORBIDDEN to be left handed, and punished for <br/>
using his left hand.<br/>
<br/>
The conditions which led to his hesitancy and discomfort about reading exist <br/>
in not ONE unschooling household.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;At one time there were a LOT of non readers.  Do you think it was from not <br/>

Yes.  Nobody EVER rode a bicycle before they were invented, and nobody has <br/>
learned to ride a bicycle in the absence of a bicycle ever since.<br/>

all, or even kids of others who it was required that they enter the workforce at <br/>
an early age.<br/>
<br/>
What about if there IS printed material around, some books, a Bible, <br/>

newspapers as an adult and lots of books around.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m not making any argument at all, I merely asked what others thought of <br/>
this and what experiences they might have encountered in their lives.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
made a decision yet on whether I think every single person can/will read.  <br/>
That&#39;s why I was asking for others experiences.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I <br/>
 had one aunt who couldn&#39;t read at all.  She was crushed to powder by school <br/>
and mean,cruel, abusive parents who told her early on she was stupid, and hit <br/>

go often or for very long<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I <br/>
Yes.  Nobody EVER rode a bicycle before they were invented, and nobody has <br/>
learned to ride a bicycle in the absence of a bicycle ever since.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not many people are denied jobs because they can&#39;t ride a bike.  Reading is <br/>
pretty important for most jobs, these days anyway.  While bike riding is mostly <br/>
for recreational use (not always) and reading is OFTEN for pleasure as well, <br/>
I still don&#39;t think they are equal in terms of comparisons.  One takes a lot <br/>
of physical muscle memory the other much more mental muscle memory.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not even sure what I think about this, just wondering about others <br/>

to read. ( before they started school, no &quot;lessons&quot; from me at all)   JP was in <br/>
school when he learned how to read, but it was also just a very easy thing <br/>
for him.   He just picked it up.  Ethan had a more difficult time ( much like my <br/>
younger sister, she can SOO identify with his struggles)  His brained is <br/>
wired differently.  Not a big deal, hes a great kid!  He has his own strengths and <br/>
reading is not that important to him.   I do NOT push it. never have, even <br/>
when he was in school.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is a good question to ponder.. I may do some research on it.  If someone <br/>
does not attain a &quot;good level&quot; of reading skills ( I would say, for a frame <br/>
of reference, about a typical 5th-6th grade level)  by the time they are .. <br/>
say.. 18, or an adult, will it be difficult for them to improve thier reading <br/>
skills as adults?    I can see this type of scenario.  Kid  reads at a level <br/>
comfortable for them., they are not interested in reading better, because what <br/>
they know gets them by.   They know how to read what they want to read and that <br/>
is all that is important to them.  OK.. great!   Kid is now an adult, wants to <br/>
go to college.. or maybe pursue a job that requires reading and comprehension <br/>
at a higher level than they have learned... I wonder how they would deal with <br/>
that... It&#39;s an interesting thought.. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713141306">There seems to be a semantical issue here that is causing the <br/>
difference in opinions. We need agree what exactly is meant by <br/>
a &quot;natural process&quot; first before we can argue about whether a <br/>
particular process is indeed &quot;natural&quot; or not. <br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re using &quot;natural&quot; in its scientific, biological context, then <br/>
I would guess that most people here would agree that humans are <br/>
indeed &quot;hard-wired&quot; to walk, talk, and yes, LEARN. BUT, saying that <br/>
it is &quot;natural&quot; to learn is one thing, saying that it is &quot;natural&quot; to <br/>
read and write is quite another, because reading and writing are <br/>
CULTURE-SPECIFIC processes, NOT common human ones. If one is using <br/>
the word &quot;natural&quot; in its most strictest sense, then it&#39;s quite easy <br/>
to argue that the concept of symbolizing spoken words is hardly a <br/>
universal biologically-based human process. There are many, many <br/>
human cultures which have not yet developed a written language, even <br/>
though they have a rich oral language--how could that be, if reading <br/>
is supposedly a &quot;natural&quot; human function? Even amongst cultures that <br/>
have produced a writing system, there is a tremendous amount of <br/>
diversity in how the spoken language is symbolized--it&#39;s quite <br/>
different learning how to read English versus Chinese or Arabic, for <br/>
instance.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to an article by G. Reid Lyon called &quot;Reading is Not a <br/>
Natural Process&quot;. I don&#39;t actually agree with all of the points that <br/>
he makes, but there are a few good ones in there that are at least <br/>
worth pondering:<br/>

<br/>
Using &quot;several generations ago&quot; arguments about literacy, and farm-laboror <br/>
arguments, seems to be ignoring the reality of the current availability in this <br/>
culture of written word.<br/>
<br/>
Holly realized she could really read when she discovered she couldn&#39;t NOT <br/>
read.  She tried to go a day without reading, but it turned out that she could <br/>
read a word just by seeing it.  That&#39;s when she considered that she was truly a <br/>
reader.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine with two young daughters (not school age, but she&#39;s not <br/>
planning to send them to school) informed her e-mail correspondents that she was <br/>
going text-free for one month in order to better understand the state of her <br/>
daughters&#39; lack of reading ability—to see the world from their point of view.<br/>
<br/>
She lasted two weeks.  She couldn&#39;t not read either.  It was everywhere.   <br/>
And what was &quot;natural&quot; for that family anyway was that the mother and father <br/>
COULD read, fluently, and SHOULD read, for their own purposes and to interpret <br/>
the world for their not-yet-reading daughters.<br/>

&gt; wasn&#39;t taught by the system. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I have no answer to whether it is or isn&#39;t natural to learn <br/>
&gt; to read, I wonder why the process has to be one or the other. <br/>
&gt; Perhaps it is both. A natural tendancy to learn to read??? I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rhonda - and her 2 cents<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure some people have a natural propensity to master reading easier <br/>
than others. Just as some people are &quot;naturally&quot; better at <br/>
manipulating numbers, or putting together music, or visualizing a two-<br/>
dimensional plane in three-dimensional space (something I&#39;m terrible <br/>
at, LOL), some people&#39;s brains are better at memorizing and code-<br/>
cracking (two primary skills needed to learn written English). We all <br/>
have uniquely wired brains with their own particular strengths and <br/>
weaknesses--whether that wiring is largely the result of genetics, or <br/>
early environmental factors, or (most likely) a combination of both, <br/>
is still being debated, but it&#39;s undeniable that individual humans <br/>
have different levels of ease in tackling specific intellectual <br/>
skills, reading included.  <br/>
<br/>
I taught myself to read before the age of 2--so did my son, and my <br/>
almost-two-year-old daughter has just about figured out the code as <br/>
well. It&#39;s just something our brains have an easy time with, I don&#39;t <br/>
know why. I know plenty of highly intelligent people who had a <br/>
tremendous amount of difficulty learning how to read. I don&#39;t think I <br/>
was &quot;smarter&quot; than them because I read early, any more than I think I <br/>
was &quot;dumber&quot; than the kid who could draw beautiful portraits when I <br/>
was still making stick figures, or the kid who could play his violin <br/>
like a virtuoso when I was still making scratchy sounds on mine. <br/>
These are all different types of intelligences, which utilize <br/>
different parts of our brains. In that respect at least, it is <br/>
completely &quot;natural&quot; for some kids to have an easier time reading <br/>
than others, because contrary to what the public education system <br/>
would like parents to think, kids (and their brains!) really ARE <br/>
different, and it just doesn&#39;t make sense to expect them to master <br/>
the same sets of skills at all, let alone expect them to do it at the <br/>
same time and in the same amount of time. <br/>

&gt; Deb L<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You need to back off from the cliff, LOL! I&#39;m in total agreement with <br/>
you that learning is natural, and certainly communication is also a <br/>
natural human function. But while verbal communication is something <br/>
that humans are hard-wired to do, written communication in and of <br/>
itself is not an equally inborn instinct--if it was, then all human <br/>
cultures would write just as all human cultures speak, but they <br/>
don&#39;t, do they? <br/>
<br/>
The combination of instinctually wanting to learn and wanting to <br/>
communicate is what ultimately drives a human surrounded by writing <br/>
to want to learn to read. But while WANTING to learn to read is <br/>
indeed a natural inclination for these people, actually being ABLE to <br/>
do so is another matter. Not all brains are equally capable of <br/>
achieving the same level of mastery of this particular skill. Some <br/>
people might call this a &quot;learning disability&quot;, others might just <br/>
realize that this is natural variation amongst human brains--the <br/>
point is that reading is a skill, something to be learned, not <br/>
something that you&#39;re born knowing how to do.  And just as some <br/>
people have an easier time learning to draw, or play an instrument, <br/>
or do algebra, so too do some people have an easier time learning to <br/>
read. <br/>
<br/>
To quote Dr. Lyon yet again:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We now have strong evidence that it is not the ear that understands <br/>
that a spoken word like &quot;cat&quot; is divided into three sounds and that <br/>
these discrete sounds can be linked to the letters C-A-T, it is the <br/>
brain that performs this function. In some youngsters, the brain <br/>
seems to have an easy time processing this type of information. <br/>
However, in many children, the skill is only learned with <br/>
difficulty....<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean that children who have a difficulty understanding that <br/>
spoken words are composed of discrete individual sounds that can be <br/>
linked to letters suffer from brain dysfunction or damage? Not at <br/>
all. It simply means that the neural systems that perceive the <br/>
phonemes in our language are less efficient than in other children. <br/>
This difference in neural efficiency can also be hypothesized to <br/>
underlie the individual differences that we see every day in learning <br/>
any skill such as singing, playing an instrument, constructing a <br/>
house, painting a portrait, and the like. In some cases, our NICHD <br/>
studies have taught us that the phonological differences we see in <br/>
good and poor readers have a genetic basis....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So yes, it&#39;s natural for an unschooled child who is surrounded by <br/>
written material and supported by loving parents to want to learn to <br/>
read, and to usually then indeed learn how to read to one degree or <br/>
another. But it&#39;s also natural for these children to learn to read at <br/>
different times, and different speeds, and ultimately at different <br/>
levels of skill and proficiency. <br/>
<br/>
Learning is natural, and communicating is natural, so for our <br/>
children wanting to learn to read is natural. So, perhaps to some <br/>
degree then, you can say learning to read is a natural thing. But is <br/>
learning to read WELL natural? Just as not all children could learn <br/>
to play a piano masterfully just by being sat in front of one and <br/>
having recorded music played for them, not all children could learn <br/>
to read proficiently simply by having books placed in front of them <br/>
and being read to. Some kids can, but obviously not all can. <br/>
Sometimes a more proactive approach is required to learn these sorts <br/>
of skills beyond a rudimentary level. Where the unschooling <br/>
philosophy comes in here is that the CHILD should be the one who asks <br/>
for this additional instruction, rather than the parent pushing the<br/>
instruction on the child. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough babbling from me for now, LOL...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I think that is the point many are making.  Reading is not &quot;natural&quot; in<br/>
a human sense.  But it is &quot;natural&quot; in the context of our Western culture.<br/>
It is an assumed part of our make up.  Like living in detached houses,<br/>
driving cars, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And we here, in an unschooling context, are questioning just how much of a<br/>
part of our lives reading needs to take up.  Is it, in fact, something that<br/>
ALL humans need to do, or something that is a part of our cultural make up?<br/>
And if it IS cultural, then that only supports the idea that &quot;pushing<br/>
reading&quot; like pushing any other learning, is NOT something we need to worry<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
If it is something our children need, in our culture, they will get it<br/>
through unschooling.<br/>

There is body language.<br/>
<br/>
Pointing.<br/>
<br/>
The Inuits, way up in the barrens of the north where there are no land<br/>
marks, build their own land marks out of large flat rocks stacked on top of<br/>
each other. Sometimes they look like humans pointing. Sometimes other<br/>
things. They&#39;re called inuksuk. (Actually 1 is an inuksuk. 2 are inuksuuk. 3<br/>
or more are inuksuit.) The inuit may need help understanding what each<br/>
means, but perhaps it makes sense that there&#39;s an instinct to recognize<br/>
&quot;That means something,&quot; even if what it means needs to be learned.<br/>
<br/>
Do people naturally, the moment they see it the first time, understand that<br/>
shrinking down in size means submissive? Do they figure it out? Do they need<br/>
it to be taught?<br/>
<br/>
(I suspect it&#39;s instinctual to make that display. I suspect it takes a few<br/>
instances for people (and other animals?) to figure it out without anyone<br/>
telling them what it means. It&#39;s meaning will become obvious from the<br/>
context. And probably some people are better at figuring it out than<br/>
others.)<br/>
<br/>
At some &quot;point&quot; in development, kids look at your finger when you&#39;re<br/>
pointing at something. At some later point they look where you&#39;re pointing.<br/>
If they never see pointing, will they have made that connection? (Merely<br/>
something to ponder since it&#39;s probably impossible to find out. There<br/>
*might* be cultures where poiting is taboo.  But could there possibly be a<br/>
culture that didn&#39;t need some way of indicating &quot;look over there&quot;?)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps graphical representation is merely one step beyond visual language.<br/>
We (and dogs though perhaps in a different way) already have the capacity to<br/>
understand that one thing can represent another. But just as with spoken<br/>
language, people need others to help them understand what the abstract<br/>
sounds and symbols mean.<br/>
<br/>
If a human culture doesn&#39;t require something that&#39;s natural, does that mean<br/>
that it&#39;s unnatural?<br/>

enough student; he just didn&#39;t read. He didn&#39;t read for pleasure. He didn&#39;t <br/>
read assignments.<br/>
<br/>
When we met, he saw me read all the time. I&#39;d suggest book after book and <br/>
maybe read a passage of something I thought he&#39;d like. He started reading---and <br/>
he read SOOOO S-L-O-W-L-Y---I couldn&#39;t imagine he&#39;d EVER finish a book! He just <br/>
kept reading, for pleasure.<br/>

Now he&#39;s still not a fast reader, and he&#39;ll probabaly never read as fast as I <br/>
do, but he&#39;s a MUCH faster/better reader.<br/>

       I hate to use hammers, the other day I smashed my finger, hammered the <br/>

like that tool. <br/>
       <br/>
       But, I love reading and writing, and use it often, to communicate, <br/>
learn, share ideas, lots of good stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
       Not all of us NEED to use hammers.  And, I have to work way too hard <br/>
*than I want to* to learn how to do it better.  I&#39;m close to giving up.    Or <br/>
limiting my use of it, at least.  I don&#39;t like smashed fingers.  ;-) Lots of <br/>
people do that with reading and writing, too.  We look down on that, as a <br/>
society, but I don&#39;t think we should.  <br/>
<br/>
       Unschooling is about the freedom to learn how to use the tools you <br/>
need to live the life you want.<br/>
<br/>
       Some people simply don&#39;t like using the tool of reading, or writing, <br/>
they&#39;ve decided to only learn how to use it, *this way*, or *that far*.  <br/>
Putting aside cultural bias for a second, why is reading or writing any different <br/>
than using a hammer?  It&#39;s not.  If some kids grow up never learning either <br/>
tool, the world will NOT stop spinning.  Late reader, never reader, late hammerer, <br/>
never hammerer, lol, who cares?  <br/>

       What&#39;s natural or not is a whole other subject, now isn&#39;t it?  <br/>

Into the Amazon @ National Geographic Magazine&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not the whole article, and not all the photos!  But if you get that magazine <br/>
or can borrow one, it&#39;s worth a look.  I saw it at the dentist&#39;s office, and <br/>
though my mother-in-law gives us all their back issues in batches a time or two <br/>
a year, I might go spring for this one to read it all now.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I&#39;d been discussing with the dental tech about irritating <br/>
sounds--nails on blackboards, squeaking balloons (which don&#39;t bother me), metal on <br/>
hard surface (which DOES bother me), how it might be worse at high elevation <br/>
and thin atmosphere, and I had said &quot;Maybe in the Amazon there are people who <br/>
have never heard any high-pitched or irritating noises.&quot;   I walked out to <br/>
wait for x-ray discussion time, and there on top of the magazine pile was an <br/>
article about Amazon tribes without metal.<br/>
<br/>
So even without printed word or written language there is still a culture for <br/>
children to learn and they learn it by being a part of it, not by being <br/>
removed from it.   That&#39;s what The Continuum Concept is all about.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; Here is a good question to ponder.. I may do some research on it.  If <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone <br/>
&gt; does not attain a &quot;good level&quot; of reading skills ( I would say, for a frame <br/>
&gt; of reference, about a typical 5th-6th grade level)  by the time they are .. <br/>
&gt; say.. 18, or an adult, will it be difficult for them to improve thier <br/>
&gt; reading <br/>
&gt; skills as adults?    I can see this type of scenario.  Kid  reads at a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>level <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; comfortable for them., they are not interested in reading better, because <br/>
&gt; what <br/>
&gt; they know gets them by.   They know how to read what they want to read and <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; is all that is important to them.  OK.. great!   Kid is now an adult, wants <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; go to college.. or maybe pursue a job that requires reading and <br/>
&gt; comprehension <br/>
&gt; at a higher level than they have learned... I wonder how they would deal <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; that... It&#39;s an interesting thought..  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

know of is here:<br/>

The second article, &quot;I can Breathe again...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know this guy.  He just turned nineteen.  Holly and Marty were at the <br/>
birthday party last night--Pizza Hut, then the ice skating rink, then Denny&#39;s.  <br/>
Wow.  <br/>
<br/>
Liam reads for fun, and novels.<br/>
<br/>
He and his sister still live at home.  They have a younger sister, 14, <br/>
they&#39;re helping take care of (as both parents and both twins are working various <br/>
different times and places) and an older brother living on his own now.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, Keith, read constantly until his eyes went bad.  He still can <br/>
read but needs more careful conditions, and has glasses.  He probably woudln&#39;t <br/>
need glasses, but he got acid splashed in his eyes when he was early-20&#39;s and <br/>
working in a geo lab, and then four years or so ago he had a detached retina.  <br/>
Probably from that SCA fighting, getting hit on the help with a rattan sword <br/>
just too many times.   <br/>
<br/>
Marty, our least wordy/reading kid, picked up and is most of the way through <br/>
a Henry Treece historical kids&#39; novel.   He was really happy to know we have <br/>
more of them upstairs.   They&#39;re violent, for kids&#39; novels.  Vikings and Saxons <br/>
and axes and swords and drownings and animals.   I was Marty&#39;s age when I was <br/>
reading them.  I was reading them because they were at the school library and <br/>
I was working through everything medieval.  I was reading them because it was <br/>
escape from my family and from school.  Marty reads because he likes the <br/>
story, and he likes the story even better than continuuing that new Star War&#39;s <br/>
video game, and even better than hanging out with his friends, sometimes.   <br/>
<br/>
So for Marty that book is more wonderful and more valuable than it was for <br/>
me.   For him it&#39;s the best of several goods.  For me it was escape from various <br/>
irritants.<br/>

All the &quot;ph&quot; words are from Greek.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Crystal, who thought &quot;natural&quot; reading meant naked, or at least in cotton<br/>
<br/>
underwear&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe without glasses, too.  That means I can no longer read naturally.  Darn <br/>
it.<br/>
Maybe naturally with really big print.<br/>

<br/>
I, for one, find the differences in cultures AMAZING.  There is a book I was<br/>
given when pregnant with my now 2 year old called Our Babies, Our Selves all<br/>
about how different cultures do different things with their infants and<br/>
toddlers because of the different expectations on adults.  We have seperate<br/>
rooms for our kids because in the US we expect the individual to be the<br/>
norm.  In other countries, co-sleeping is the norm because the family unit<br/>
is the &quot;base.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend the book.  Talk about questioning our assumptions.  Great<br/>
stuff.<br/>

Altho I would add that this may sound subversive, radical, <br/>
strange....basically hard to accept.  If I told any of my friends with kids that I didn&#39;t find <br/>
reading that important (it&#39;s not any more important than art, or music, or <br/>
history), they would think I&#39;d cracked my skull.  ;-) <br/>

step back and just let my son &quot;read&quot; as he wishes.  He&#39;s seven, knows how to<br/>
read, and reads mostly from video games and game guides.  It&#39;s been<br/>
amazingly difficult for me to make the transition to &quot;He&#39;s reading fine,<br/>
reads what he wants, it&#39;s got great vocabulary, etc.&quot; from, &quot;But he needs to<br/>
be reading &quot;books.&quot;<br/>
