&gt;just because their ideas are  called into question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems to be the main crux of what a LOT of email lists go through. <br/>
What appears to be rudeness is (as someone stated but I lost the post) <br/>
the voicing of a strongly held opinion on unschooling (not observations <br/>
of a personality, race, religion - thats different).<br/>
<br/>
For example (its a bit long, but please bear with me) I was once on a <br/>
parenting list for &#39;Spiritual&#39; children. When someone asked for help with <br/>
an ongoing situation with their child and her teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I responded with the idea of homeschooling or sending her <br/>
child to a democratic school where the child is respected. <br/>
<br/>
Another response was someone saying something about a jar of &#39;coins&#39; for <br/>
a goodie jar and to let the child get a coin for their behaviour and it <br/>
works just great.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I responded about bribery, Skinnerism does work - but at what cost, <br/>
and quoted Alfie Kohn in Punished by Rewards.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, this unmoderated list *smile* member responded that &#39;well you <br/>
have to realize that its not for all kids&#39; blah blah blah. So I banged <br/>
out my quick response in the mode I was in. Which was &#39;removed from <br/>
emotion&#39; kind of mode. You know.. different styles depending on where <br/>
your head is at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
The &#39;coin&#39; lady responded with something about &#39;You MUST understand that <br/>
we don&#39;t beleive in bribery but this method is working great blah blah <br/>
blah and that of course we are DIPLOMATIC with our child&#39;. (She totally <br/>
misread/understood DEMOCRATIC, and what it means to allow children <br/>
choices)<br/>
<br/>
The list owner then responded about how I was so rude etc. So I explained <br/>
that I was bringing up discussion and that my posting style, without all <br/>
that &#39;love&#39; &#39;bless you&#39; stuff, and that I would gladly leave the list <br/>
instead of getting into any kind of debate about rudeness.<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few people thanked me for the info.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m driving at is that these two people, listowner and personal <br/>
friend, found their parenting beleifs to be in question by my strong <br/>
opinion on how to respect children. It wasn&#39;t rudeness, it was how it <br/>
affects their belief system. <br/>
<br/>
If their beleifs were strong in their head, and they felt what they were <br/>
doing was right, they would not have read any rudenes at all. They would <br/>
of read a very strong differing opinion.<br/>
<br/>
We all have our hot buttons. Geez, I know I have quite a few. And if we <br/>
need to coddle eachothers, then we will definately not move forward in <br/>
our discussions.<br/>

This is so true Kolleen!!  Not only would they not read it as rude, but they<br/>
would not read what you are saying as a criticism of them.  I am sad to say,<br/>
I even lost a friend this way.  I was over-enthusiastic about unschooling<br/>
and talked about it a lot.   She was not at all confident in her choice to<br/>
send her kids to school and she just couldn&#39;t handle the way she questioned<br/>
herself after I left. Knowing what I know now, I am not sure I would change<br/>
anything about our exchanges.  I really have to have friends that accept me<br/>
for me and not just because I agree with them.  I can handle it when other<br/>
people find different paths that work for them and I am not judgmental of<br/>
this.  However, I love to share what works for us with my friends.  And, I<br/>
love to have them share what works for them....that is how we learn and grow<br/>
from each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990796671">--- I think that was really well put Kolleen. I guess where I differ <br/>
from those that get offended when questioned, is that when I&#39;m <br/>
questioned it makes me think. If it&#39;s a strongly held belief I am <br/>
being questioned on (like unschooling) I don&#39;t get offended, and I <br/>
find my arguements strong and well thought out....because it IS a <br/>
strongly held belief and I can easily defend my position on those <br/>
issues.<br/>
If I&#39;m questioning myself at all, or the other persons arguements <br/>
hold water, then it makes me think. And ultimately I&#39;ve changed a LOT <br/>
from those type of discussions where my view didn&#39;t hold water.<br/>
I notice a feeling of &quot;ownership&quot; by certain people at this board.<br/>
Bridget said something like &quot;I&#39;ve finally gotten this list where I <br/>
want it&quot; (forgive me if that&#39;s not accurate, I didn&#39;t go back to <br/>
look), and I am very confused by those type of statements.<br/>
I thought the Hegener&#39;s owned this list.<br/>
I also thought it was a public board, where anyone can state opinions <br/>
(I didn&#39;t do it in a nasty way, but have now been accused of that), <br/>
and not get kicked off!!<br/>
If this is a closed society, where differing opinions are not <br/>
welcome, then it should be a private board, not public.<br/>
I find posts with differing opinions, well stated, food for thought. <br/>
I enjoy thought provoking conversation. Unfortunately it seems that <br/>
isn&#39;t welcome in some people&#39;s eyes.<br/>
Which is why this list continues to have problems.<br/>
When a list is regularly &quot;outing&quot; people that don&#39;t say exactly what <br/>
you want to hear, that is a problem.<br/>
Outing people that are regular contributors to HEM and <br/>
unschooling.com even!!!! Amazing.<br/>
I wish I could understand what is so offensive about someone <br/>
questioning the words you use. I don&#39;t remember saying anything <br/>
dirogatory to the person I questioned. If I attacked a strongly held <br/>
belief then it should be easy enough to explain it and stand your <br/>
ground, right?<br/>
If not, then we could discuss it and seek further understanding.<br/>
Either way, there shouldn&#39;t be this ugliness shown to any dissenters.<br/>

I think that this list has come a long way in just a few months <br/>
toward becoming accepting of others. Less than six month ago, anyone <br/>
who said that some children might need more limits than others was <br/>
jumped on in a big way and told that they just weren&#39;t unschooling <br/>
enough or it would work. A lot of the problems stemmed from a rigid <br/>
description of unschooling. <br/>
Anyway, I am trying very hard to let go of certain things that were <br/>
said to me then because the climate here is obviously very different <br/>
