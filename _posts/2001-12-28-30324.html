&gt; Thanks for your response, Mimi. I&#39;ve always felt guilty for thinking<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a better mother than my own mother and in fact, when I first read<br/>
&gt; your statement to that effect the other day, it bugged me that you<br/>
&gt; said that. But then, when I re-read it again in this post (below) I<br/>
&gt; thought, ya know... she&#39;s exactly right!  I&#39;ve been trying to believe<br/>
&gt; that she (MY mom) did the best she could for us under her<br/>
&gt; circumstances. But ya know what? She *didn&#39;t* do the best she<br/>
&gt; could.... she took a part time job to get *away* from all of us<br/>
&gt; (there were five) because she never got any help from my dDad. We<br/>
&gt; were left to raise ourselves. Your mom threw water on your son. My<br/>
&gt; mom poured a glass of milk over my brother&#39;s head while he was<br/>
&gt; strapped in his high chair (this was ages ago... WHY do I so vividly<br/>
&gt; remember it!).<br/>
&gt; (pause)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Damn... and although I haven&#39;t poured milk on anybody or thrown water<br/>
&gt; in the girls&#39; faces, I have done my fair share of poor-parenting. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; outta here for tonight... gotta go mend some fences and work on my<br/>
&gt; parenting skills.<br/>
&gt; (*still* searching for the parenting manual that was supposed to be<br/>
&gt; given out at childbirth)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682067167">Hi Susan,<br/>
I totally expect to have very close ties with my dd&#39;s when they&#39;re <br/>
grown up. In thinking about all my hsing mom-friends, it seems we all <br/>
have struggles with our moms. It&#39;s also pretty clear that we&#39;re all <br/>
striving to not repeat the same patterns that put us in this <br/>
position.<br/>
 My oldest is now a teen, 15 and we&#39;re going through that stage where <br/>
she&#39;s a goddess and I&#39;m poison :( but compared to others I have <br/>
observed, we have a milder case of this than most. It&#39;s very <br/>
disturbing to me even though I know it&#39;s just a stage because I <br/>
*want* to be a part of her life. So, for now, I have to choose my <br/>
battles because in the end, I want to be able to go to lunch with my <br/>
adult children and laugh and tell secrets and all that good stuff. I <br/>
don&#39;t want to alienate her now just to make a point.<br/>
 Maybe one day *we&#39;ll* stroll in the grocery store together and have <br/>
a good time even there!<br/>

father, on the other hand, has yet to learn that she is no longer a <br/>
child.  It&#39;s kind of ironic.  He spent her childhood trying to turn her <br/>
against me.  And now she and I are *much* closer than they are.  She&#39;s <br/>
actually had to write him out of her life a few times already.<br/>

parents, and we still worry about them, but we do our best to only *offer* <br/>
advice, in the sense that they are free to accept or reject without hurting <br/>
our feelings.  (And we&#39;re not perfect at this.  The &quot;kids&quot; know we&#39;re <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always expected a close relationship with my kids when they were <br/>
grown, and so far we have just that, even though three of them live <br/>
quite a ways away (two in Alaska, one 60+ miles away), and the other <br/>
two are gone more than they&#39;re home most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
What do I mean by close? Well... I was visiting the kids in Alaska <br/>
just before Christmas and we were out doing some Christmas shopping; <br/>
I was picking out one of those noisy-obnoxious kinds of toys grandmas <br/>
love to give grandkids when my oldest son grabbed me from behind, <br/>
lifted me right up off my feet with a big bearhug, and said &quot;Mom, I <br/>
love you to pieces but if you get that for my daughter I&#39;m going to <br/>
mail both it and her down to YOU!&quot; &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So I snuck back the next day, bought the noisemaker, wrapped it up <br/>
and tucked it under the tree for HIM to open on Christmas - after I&#39;d <br/>
left! &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m waiting for Jim, the son who lives 60 miles away, to <br/>
show up with his family. I was over at their place last night (yeah, <br/>
we all travel A LOT), and thought about just spending the night <br/>
there, but it was a beautiful clear moonlit night and the drive <br/>
between here and there is through some of the most beautiful <br/>
mountains anywhere, over the highest pass in the state... (and <br/>
besides, there&#39;s nothing like one&#39;s *own* bed and snugglies &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been home about ten minutes when the phone rang. It was Jim, just <br/>
checking to make sure I&#39;d made it home safely. Mark said it was his <br/>
third call, and on his call before that he&#39;d said he was giving me <br/>
another half hour before he started out looking for me. (Yes, I carry <br/>
a cellphone, but it doesn&#39;t work out in those mountains.)<br/>
<br/>
I credit my parents with teaching me how to parent. What goes around <br/>
comes around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  My husband and I are very close to our boys now and we hope to <br/>
remain so forever.  My husband had an extremely close and beautiful <br/>
relationship with his &quot;Pop&quot; (his step-grandfather).  My husband was <br/>
raised by this wonderful man.  I credit him for the fact that my husband <br/>
is such an excellent and loving father.  Wes, my husband, was very lucky <br/>
to have his Pop.  He&#39;s been gone now for over 25 years, and Wes still <br/>
misses him terribly.  I&#39;m quite certain that my boys will be just as <br/>
close to my husband as he was to his Pop.  I have learned a lot from my <br/>
husband about how to be a loving and caring parent.<br/>

My sister mentioned above has that kind of relationship with our mom. I <br/>
think its because my mom *likes* her, not just *loves* her.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At the risk of started a very heated thread, I&#39;m going to speak my mind. <br/>
*smile*<br/>
<br/>
I expect to be close to my son, but  not as close as if he were a <br/>
daughter. yes, yes, it sounds so chauvanistic, but this is how I see it.<br/>
<br/>
In MOST  homes, the woman takes on most of the responsibility of <br/>
child-rearing and house-keeping regardless of who is the breadwinner. Its <br/>
just how it is. Women seem to be able to juggle much better. And if the <br/>
childhood was decent, she&#39;ll model her mother.<br/>
<br/>
Since I don&#39;t want to be one of THOSE meddling, disapproving MIL, I have <br/>
to remind myself that it will be his wife that will carry the flavour of <br/>
education etc of the grandkids.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I still want to keep the laughter and be as involved as I am <br/>
welcome to be. But not at the risk of causing stress between a couple. <br/>
damn, its hard enough!<br/>
<br/>
btw: My son at 5yo asks me all the time &#39;how do i know when i pick a wife <br/>
if she will have a good heart or a black heart, how do you tell?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I dont&#39; have an answer for him.<br/>

to handle it.  The last time they were here, my father and I got into a<br/>
really nasty fight.  On one hand I don&#39;t care to have one again, OTOH it<br/>
was the first honest conversation I&#39;ve had with either of my parents in my<br/>
life.  My mother&#39;s comment in talking about visiting again was that we<br/>
should never, ever have another fight like that.<br/>

chameleon - she becomes whatever the situation needs her to be in order<br/>
to get along.  I am either me or I&#39;m in my shell hiding from it all!<br/>
<br/>
One time when I was bemoaning the fact that my children won&#39;t have a<br/>
neat grandmother like I did (my DH&#39;s mother died before I met him) my DH<br/>
said &quot;our kids don&#39;t need a neat grandmother like you did.  You are a<br/>
better mother than your mother was.&quot;  Some days I believe him and others<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure!  But I think it&#39;s the not so sure part that really counts.<br/>
I question my parenting and strive to get better - my mother *knows* she&#39;s<br/>
been a good mother to us all.<br/>
