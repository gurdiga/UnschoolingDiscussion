How about hiring a mother&#39;s helper (or even two). I have a 10yog who comes<br/>
to my house once a week and keeps the kids occupied with puzzles, books ,<br/>
etc while I clean. Because my house is so small, we usually end up playing<br/>
musical room (she&#39;ll be in the family room while I do the bedrooms, then<br/>
they go in the kitchen and eat while I do the livingroom, etc). She comes<br/>
all day on Fri. or Sat. and only charges $5! I don&#39;t know if you could find<br/>
someone that cheap, but to a 10yo $2/hr would be sufficient and still cheap<br/>
for you. It&#39;s worked out great for us. In fact I just recently got an offer<br/>
from a 12yo boy in our hsing group to come on Mons. and I might do that too.<br/>

&gt; Right, this is one of those &#39;off-topic&#39; things about kids which<br/>
&gt; someone saw fit to be so dismissive of.  I&#39;m asking here because i<br/>
&gt; really need some feedback on the whole emotional/empathetic/<br/>
&gt; behavioural thing (basically I&#39;m looking for words of wisdom from<br/>
&gt; Susan &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s Tuesday morning and once again I&#39;m mega-fed-up with the<br/>
&gt; whole tidying-up thing.  I don&#39;t know, what do you all think?  I need<br/>
&gt; to have one day a week when I get the whole house done.  If this<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t happen, it gets overwhelming and it doesn&#39;t get done for<br/>
&gt; weeks and weeks.  This includes the kids&#39; room.  So is tidying<br/>
&gt; their room their problem, since it&#39;s their room, or mine, since I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; the one who wants to vac the floor?  It doesn&#39;t help that I got fed-up<br/>
&gt; of them faffing about on a Tuesday morning so now they do it on<br/>
&gt; Monday night, and then my Tai Chi class moves from Thurs to Mon<br/>
&gt; so dh has the kids, and at the moment there seems a lot of<br/>
&gt; negativity from that corner.  Last night he told them that the tidying<br/>
&gt; up would be done before they played out, (in ultimatum format...)<br/>
&gt; so Heather said &#39;I&#39;ve changed my mind, I don&#39;t want to play out...&#39;  I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t change how he is with them, but I can change how I am, and<br/>
&gt; something needs to give...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Am I expecting too much of a 4&1/2 and 3&1/2yo, ther are capable<br/>
&gt; of doing the tidying up, apart from the books, which either me or dh<br/>
&gt; do?  The other problem is that when dh has the kids, he usually<br/>
&gt; has work to do (like last night,) so they do their thing while he does<br/>
&gt; his, or he wants peace and quiet to watch tv...  Can you tell it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; the kids I&#39;m annoyed with???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think this is off-topic, cause I don&#39;t see how we can all live<br/>
&gt; together (which is surely what home-ed is about) unless we can<br/>
&gt; manage these situations well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I need to go finish that hoovering...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778763359">That&#39;s the question, and I suppose that&#39;s why this list does <br/>
sometimes get filled with &#39;OT&#39; stuff about living with kids of all <br/>
ages, since at least we know that most people here will <br/>
understand the desire to not inflict things on their kids, but still <br/>
have a home they can live in.  That is the question, how do we <br/>
balance what we know about our kids (that they don&#39;t like tidying-<br/>
up) against what we want, in this case, them to be able to use the <br/>
stuff in their room without standing on it, and without coughing <br/>
and choking at the amount of dust in there.  Without spending a <br/>
fortune on wooden flooring that doesn&#39;t trap the dust the same, <br/>
and getting rid of all the &#39;friends,&#39; (teddies or soft toys, to other <br/>
folk) that is...<br/>

 exception, grr.  Though m &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IMO -- Take it FWIW -- etc.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are too young to be of any real help.<br/>
Your husband is not incapable of learning to help a bit -- but I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
expect miracles.<br/>
You need a long walk.<br/>
Your house has too much stuff in it.<br/>
<br/>
This last bit I actually know about.  We (me) are in the midst of painting <br/>
the 2 kids&#39; rooms.  Yesterday, we got to my daughter&#39;s closet.  I do not even <br/>
pretend to intend to paint the inside.  But some of the clutter had to go in <br/>
order to just fix the doors and paint the outside and move the bed, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I now have, in the garage, 4 large trash bags of stuffed animals and assorted <br/>
junk.  These are from her closet and general floor stuff.  They are headed <br/>
for the trash!<br/>
<br/>
She still has a fullllllllll toy box, fullllll to overflowing stuffed animal <br/>
chest, lots and lots of art supplies (in a new lidded box to keep them in, I <br/>
hope) and misc stuff around the room.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s room -- we took down a lot of things off the walls and I&#39;m not in <br/>
any hurry to put them back.  We got rid of (threw away -- my opinion-- yard <br/>
sales are nice for other people but I do not have the time or space to save <br/>
stuff for a yard sales I will never have) blocks (the broken ones) and misc <br/>
junk from the floor and under the bed and the closet.  This was only about 3 <br/>
trash bags of stuff thrown away!  <br/>
<br/>
The rooms now are less visually cluttered (not even done in daughter&#39;s room <br/>
yet) and feel cleaner and more user friendly.  And I think I notice, with <br/>
less to keep picked up and a cleaner, new environment, that both are <br/>
actually, I think, picking up a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so long-winded.  But I think the 2 things that keep me sane in <br/>
this department are low standards!!!! and throwing things away.<br/>
<br/>
I too go nuts about being the only one in this entire house who seems to know <br/>
how to put a wet towel in the laundry.  Etc etc etc.  But, I think they (the <br/>
kids -- 5 1/2 and 7) are getting a little better.  Husband is pretty much a <br/>
lost cause.  But at least his crap ends up in the same places -- dirty <br/>
clothes get tossed here -- maybe he thinks that&#39;s where they go -- who <br/>
knows?!  <br/>
<br/>
You are not alone in this and I think almost all moms go thru all of this.  <br/>
And I&#39;m no Martha Stewart so I don&#39;t have a clue most of the time for handy <br/>
little storage ideas or cute shelves.  But I think if you can just keep your <br/>
standards low (and I mean it -- nothing HAS to match or has to be painted -- <br/>
reasonably clean and usable -- that&#39;s what I aim at) and your trash bags <br/>
handy, you might survive.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947367264">I think that it is probably a little beyond them so far.  My 3 yo tends to <br/>
empty everything onto her floor and then is sad that she can&#39;t find her <br/>
things to play with.  I know where you are coming from.  They both seem to <br/>
be able to clean up, but they usually do need assistance.  Your dd sounds <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375057293">my opinion, and it&#39;s coming from someone who has hit rock bottom in <br/>
the &#39;clean house standards department&#39;-lol<br/>
make it fun!   whether they help you or not.  because if they see YOU <br/>
enjoying cleaning they&#39;ll want to participate.   the nature of the <br/>
&#39;beast&#39;:) <br/>
<br/>
rene&#39; who will be 5 on 18th /sept.  comes and goes w/ cleaning.   he&#39;s <br/>
almost always is in the room that&#39;s being cleaned and gets really <br/>
excited when he does something which is overtly helpful.   and yes he <br/>
does spend more time talking about just how helpful he is then he does <br/>
actually being helpful:)  but hey nothing wrong w/ a little <br/>
entertainment while one cleans &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
i think  everything should be done as a family (including the family <br/>
bed:), or as much as humanly possible - given ones particular <br/>
temperament and all&lt;G&gt;.  cleaning should be play for both the adults <br/>
and children.  w/ rene&#39; i focus on when he helps (and ignore when he <br/>
doesn&#39;t) and always give him a choice to help or not.  i do make <br/>
suggestion and create do-able jobs for him, and make sure he feels <br/>
included but i never push him to do it.   also all rooms are part of <br/>
the house even though one room has all his things in it, so no <br/>
separation - one big whole:)  i think this echoes the spirit of <br/>
family, rather the individual, creating more bonding.  i also sit back <br/>
after it&#39;s all clean and talk about just how great it feels to have a <br/>
clean house and how much fun it was to clean w/ him.  keep it a <br/>
positive thing, not a job but a game.  <br/>
<br/>
i grew up with the attitude that cleaning was a drag, my mom hated it <br/>
& i grew up to hate it and my house was always disgusting ( and still <br/>
is -lol-but i see it very differently now:)  this was because cleaning <br/>
was a 2nd class job and the person doing it deserved and got no <br/>
respect (and i was a professional house cleaner for a time and people <br/>
are not respectful! i could tell lots of stories)  but then 3 yrs ago <br/>
i got sick and lost most of the connective tissues in my shoulders and <br/>
now i would love to clean my house - i would happily scrub, dust, wash <br/>
everything and i see it as one of the most important jobs in the <br/>
world. <br/>
<br/>
i guess what i&#39;m saying is something like &#39;zen and the art of house <br/>
cleaning w/ children&#39; lol  -let go of the outcome and enjoy the <br/>
process.   i would say don&#39;t really change anything other then your <br/>
attitude.   and the truth is that&#39;s about the only thing one really <br/>
can change or control - certainly not ones children&lt;G&gt;.  your house <br/>
may or may not be cleaner but from my point  of view it&#39;s not so much <br/>
the outcome but the relationships and atmosphere of the home.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have kinda the same problem with my 5yos and 3.5yod.<br/>
DS is good to pick up and pitch in and help when I ask<br/>
him to. DD on the other hand is &quot;I will but I will do<br/>
it on my own time&quot; type. This has been hard for me to<br/>
deal with. What I have realized though is that DS is<br/>
somewhat of an exception and that maybe my<br/>
expectations are too high for DD. I have also decided<br/>
that I am not going to pick up after their messes in<br/>
the house. I will sweep everything into a pile and<br/>
even go through and sort the pile into smaller piles<br/>
so it doesn&#39;t seem so overwhelming to them but as far<br/>
as actually putting the mess away, they do it.<br/>
Sometimes they dilly dally and take much longer than<br/>
it has to. During these times I have learned that<br/>
although they are doing the job much slower than I<br/>
would like for them too, they are still working on it.<br/>
Also, I have started telling them which pile each one<br/>
has to put away. Usually, DS ends up doing a little<br/>
more than DD, but I figure that he is older and can<br/>
handle a little more than she can. This has worked out<br/>
so far. Now when it comes to cleaning DD&#39;s room I have<br/>
found that if I use the same technique she does pretty<br/>
well. Especially if I appear to be working i.e. busy<br/>
in there with her. What I usually do is sweep<br/>
everything into a pile and begin sortin it out. While<br/>
I am doing this I will give her little jobs to do like<br/>
I will say, &quot;Here go put this in your brother&#39;s room.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Go put this in the sink.&quot; So she is not just sitting<br/>
there while I am working. When she returns from each<br/>
assignment I tell her thank you or good job/girl and<br/>
then give her something else to go do. In the end she<br/>
puts most of the stuff away. I make sure not to show<br/>
that I am frustrated with her and give her lots of<br/>
praise. This was really hard at first, but has really<br/>
paid off. She still isn&#39;t able to go in there and do<br/>
the job herself but it isn&#39;t as unpleasant for either<br/>
of us any more. Eventually, I will send her in to pick<br/>
up just the clothes then pick up just the books, etc.<br/>
This is what I do with 5yos. Also, I will set the<br/>
timer for say 30 min and tell them &quot;Let&#39;s see if we<br/>
can beat the clock.&quot; They get excited and start<br/>
running around. If they are done before the clock or<br/>
if they have been working really hard and don&#39;t quite<br/>
beat the clock I will give them a treat for their hard<br/>
work. I know you wanted to hear that there was some<br/>
way to get them to do it all at once right now, but I<br/>
have learned that many times they have to work<br/>
themselves up to doing the bigger job right now. <br/>

 The kids are too young to be of any real help.<br/>
 Your husband is not incapable of learning to help a bit -- but I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
 expect miracles.<br/>
 You need a long walk.<br/>
 Your house has too much stuff in it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was my first thought also.  I have seen 3 yrs old, 3 times and 4 1/2 2 x <br/>
so <br/>
far, and they are just not capable of doing very much.  They don&#39;t have the <br/>
maturity or desire.  My first born (a girl) has been a little helper since 4. <br/>
 Putting<br/>
away clothes, helping picking up just to get things done so we can get onto <br/>
the<br/>
more important/fun things. My now 5 yr old boy does not like to clean up, he<br/>
mostly hates it.  We  have had many talks on the subject.<br/>
How mom picks up stuff thats not even hers just to help out blah blah blah, it<br/>
does seem to help a bit, but its frustrating cus his attitude makes me have <br/>
negative feelings towards him (ie I think he is lazy!) when in fact, he&#39;s <br/>
really just not that<br/>
mature, cus sure cleaning up is not really fun compared to other things.  My <br/>
current three yr old boy will help out when we all get together to do it, but <br/>
then again sometimes he&#39;ll just do legos while the rest of us do it.  It <br/>
seems that most of the moms I know have lowered their standards, but even <br/>
still we all seem to struggle with it. Picking up seems to be the most <br/>
dreaded chore, while getting to clean (rags and spray bottles) isn&#39;t so bad.  <br/>
I regularly go thru the kids room (and they know I am doing it and are right <br/>
there and know I don&#39;t take anything out that they want, they even check my <br/>
bag and the stuff gets donated or goes in the trash.  At that age and older I <br/>
would say you still have to help them clean up.  You can&#39;t just say please <br/>
pick up your toys so I can vacuum, you will have to go in there sit on the <br/>
floor and hand each child a toy to set on the shelf, tell them each and every <br/>
piece to pick up and where to put it.  Tedious yet, but less frustrating than <br/>
expecting them to do more than they are capable of.  On a final upbeat note <br/>
LOL I gave the kids old dad socks to put on their feet and squirt bottles <br/>
with water and a dab of cleaner and told them to go ice skating on the <br/>
kitchen floor.  They got it pretty darn clean and it was seriously pitiful <br/>
looking!!! Hang in there!<br/>

Oh yes this has worked well for us and they do it without me physically <br/>
helping,<br/>
but rather than set a timer we just count to 30 or something s-l-o-w-l-y, and<br/>
sometimes I forget what I am doing and the kids yell count mom LOL.  This<br/>
can only be done with quick pick ups and the stuff won&#39;t necessarily be <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-396915492">Welcome Lee,<br/>
I know you from the huuh-l list. :) I like the system you use with your son.<br/>
I must admit I&#39;m not big into discipline, but I think it&#39;s important that if<br/>
you are going to use punishments that they be balanced with rewards. One of<br/>
the systems we tried was similar to yours. We had a reward jar and a<br/>
punishment jar. If someone did something (or didn&#39;t do something-such as<br/>
housework) that I felt constituted a punishment they would reach in the jar<br/>
and pull it out. In the jar were slips of paper with things like no t.v.<br/>
tonight, no bike for the rest of the day, etc. On the flip side the reward<br/>
jar had things like go for an ice cream, extra 1/2 hr of tv, etc. They would<br/>
get to go into this jar for things like doing a chore w/o being asked,<br/>
helping a hurt sibling, etc. I really liked it and it worked the best out of<br/>
all things we tried. It just didn&#39;t work for us cuz I felt guilty making<br/>
them dig into the punishment jar. Oh well, one of my shortcomings as a<br/>
parent I guess.<br/>

Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] fed-up...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi, I&#39;m new to this list-so this is kind of a response/self-intro<br/>
(although<br/>
&gt; I recognize a few names here from the huuh list, hem page and unschooling<br/>
&gt; page, which I frequent).  I&#39;m a homeschooler/unschooler (or learning to be<br/>
&gt; one), have 3 boys 7, 3, and 3 months, and live in Escanaba MI. We&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; homeschooling for about 2 years, and my son has been gradually leading me<br/>
&gt; into unschooling, which is the best method for him to learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m addressing your question, Tracy, because I just went through this with<br/>
&gt; my husband, Mike.  He&#39;s naturally a coercive parent. He does his best to<br/>
&gt; control it, but his childhood upbringing was based on authority and fear,<br/>
&gt; and he regresses.  We&#39;ve done a good job treating our kids like people and<br/>
&gt; not pets, so they are personality plus-especially our eldest boy. As a<br/>
&gt; result, Mike butts heads with our son, Seamus, rather often.  He&#39;s proud<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Seamus&#39; spirit, but frustrated that Seamus hasn&#39;t yet figured out how to<br/>
&gt; pick his battles. I admit, I get frustrated too, but I&#39;m more patient than<br/>
&gt; my husband.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve had the same problems over house upkeep. We all live in this house<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; avail of the advantages of living here, so I feel we all need to work<br/>
&gt; together in order to &quot;pay&quot; for the &quot;privilege&quot; of living in our home. I<br/>
&gt; explained it to my son by using the Little Red Hen story. It seemed to<br/>
click<br/>
&gt; well in his brain, but his lack of helping didn&#39;t change-and I ended up<br/>
&gt; witnessing my husband coercing my son again to clean the house.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In order to keep peace in the house, we had to create non-coercive, or at<br/>
&gt; least minimally coercive, consequences for my son.  Since we consider<br/>
living<br/>
&gt; in our home a privilege, we decided to make a list of Seamus&#39; favorite<br/>
&gt; privileges.  We wrote them out on tickets and tacked them to our bulletin<br/>
&gt; board. When we find ourselves repeatedly requesting that he perform a<br/>
&gt; household duty and he fails to do it he loses a daily privilege-like<br/>
&gt; watching t.v., playing with his sega, using the computer, staying up until<br/>
&gt; 9:30pm, getting dessert after dinner, and the absolute worst one we pull<br/>
&gt; last, playing outside. (This last one is the biggie-he knows he&#39;ll really<br/>
&gt; have screwed up if we have to pull that one as it&#39;s his favorite thing to<br/>
&gt; do.  The good thing is-we haven&#39;t had to pull it yet). I can usually tell<br/>
&gt; when it&#39;s time to take a ticket because I can feel my frustration level<br/>
&gt; increase-I have no set number of requests since every situation is<br/>
slightly<br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We also use the reward system, based on an idea I saw listed on another<br/>
&gt; homeschooling board.  When he performs each daily duty without being<br/>
forced<br/>
&gt; to do it, he gets a star on his learning calendar.  When he gets 10 stars<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; gets a ticket which he can use towards special privileges.  Right now he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; working towards getting Nickelodeon magazine-we&#39;ve placed a ticket value<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; it based on the subscription price.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think this is true blue non-coercive parenting, but it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; compromise that seems to be mutually beneficial.  Our son is learning that<br/>
&gt; there are expectations that need to be followed when you share your home<br/>
&gt; with others, and my husband is learning that children don&#39;t have to be<br/>
&gt; threatened with ultimatums in order to get them to clean up after<br/>
&gt; themselves. Most importantly, we&#39;ve learned how to talk with one another<br/>
&gt; about doing household chores without getting frustrated or angry. And our<br/>
&gt; home is staying clean without buildup for the first time since we&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; kids.  It&#39;s amazing! I guess some people (like me!) are just slow. ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway-that&#39;s an idea-something to chew on.<br/>

&gt; Thanks, Lee.  I don&#39;t want to start on the reward-system thing,<br/>
&gt; cos afaics, it just lends to bigger and bigger rewards, and more<br/>
&gt; and more reliance on external motivation, but since the kids have<br/>
&gt; no internal motivation to sort their stuff out, I don&#39;t know where to<br/>
&gt; start.  &lt;g&gt;  it&#39;s something<br/>
&gt; to add to the mix, though...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782753555">thanks, susan.  i know your situation is way different to mine, and <br/>
I hate to seem like a whinger.  I just haven&#39;t reached that point of <br/>
&#39;zen...&#39; yet i guess.  I&#39;m still deschooling from the &#39;cleaning is <br/>
bother&#39; attitude.  I do enjoy it, really, but we have a problem that <br/>
the kids run and hide when i vac, so i&#39;d love to include them in me <br/>
doing this but they&#39;re too busy being terrified...  Usually while i&#39;m <br/>
doing upstairs they will do downstairs, which is good.  i guess it <br/>
was just me that didn&#39;t want to do it today, though i know i need to <br/>
cos it&#39;s just overwhelming otherwise.  their room actually looks <br/>
little different (different stuff on the floor) than it did before they <br/>
started yesterday.  ah well.  it&#39;s their stuff..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245865180">Thanks, corallyn.  I&#39;m not really looking for a quick fix, just wanted <br/>
some feedback as to whether my expectations of what they do are <br/>
too high/low.  I suppose part of it is that dd2 tends to do more than <br/>
dd1, and i have a problem with that because their early lives were <br/>
so different, I can&#39;t help thinking that their attitudes are so different <br/>
because they were treat so different.  I know that&#39;s past and if one <br/>
subscribes to the theory that we choose our lives, then that&#39;s their <br/>
choice too.  But it can be hard for me to get past.  I suppose i need <br/>
to read one of those &#39;spirited child&#39; books, as they are both <br/>
challenging in their own sweet ways &lt;g&gt;  Splitting it down sounds <br/>
like a great idea, but they still just sit and look at it, and I need to <br/>
sort the rest of the house, so that&#39;s what i used to do.  I could do <br/>
the whole house and they&#39;d have forgotten that i need their room <br/>
done so i can vac.  so this is why it&#39;s got moved to monday night.  <br/>
Yesterday may have been an exception since it&#39;s our first monday <br/>
without going to gym during the day, it&#39;s closed for the summer.  <br/>
and I&#39;m out so it&#39;s not me helping them do, so i don&#39;t know what&#39;s <br/>
being done...  I do know that i&#39;m more of a sorter than dh, dh is a <br/>
pick-up-and-sort-later type, but the sort-later doesn&#39;t often get <br/>
done.  we have drawers full of stuff that&#39;s been &#39;tidied...&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to remember about sorting into piles first.<br/>

 What I usually do is sweep<br/>
&gt; everything into a pile and begin sortin it out. While<br/>
&gt; I am doing this I will give her little jobs to do like<br/>
&gt; I will say, &quot;Here go put this in your brother&#39;s room.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Go put this in the sink.&quot; So she is not just sitting<br/>
&gt; there while I am working. When she returns from each<br/>
&gt; assignment I tell her thank you or good job/girl and<br/>
&gt; then give her something else to go do. In the end she<br/>
&gt; puts most of the stuff away. I make sure not to show<br/>
&gt; that I am frustrated with her and give her lots of<br/>
&gt; praise. This was really hard at first, but has really<br/>
&gt; paid off. She still isn&#39;t able to go in there and do<br/>
&gt; the job herself but it isn&#39;t as unpleasant for either<br/>
&gt; of us any more. Eventually, I will send her in to pick<br/>
&gt; up just the clothes then pick up just the books, etc.<br/>
&gt; This is what I do with 5yos. Also, I will set the<br/>
&gt; timer for say 30 min and tell them &quot;Let&#39;s see if we<br/>
&gt; can beat the clock.&quot; They get excited and start<br/>
&gt; running around. If they are done before the clock or<br/>
&gt; if they have been working really hard and don&#39;t quite<br/>
&gt; beat the clock I will give them a treat for their hard<br/>
&gt; work. I know you wanted to hear that there was some<br/>
&gt; way to get them to do it all at once right now, but I<br/>
&gt; have learned that many times they have to work<br/>
&gt; themselves up to doing the bigger job right now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632967135">Thanks Kathy.  Thing is i know, have seen them, do this well <br/>
enough without being prompted, and if i go and prompt, it actually <br/>
takes longer.  particularly one, she sits and sits and sits and sits....  <br/>
I can say &#39;this needs to go there,&#39; and hand it to her and she does <br/>
not move.  which is very frustrating.  yet one day, after doing <br/>
upstairs, i came down and opened the living-room door to find <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726631610">I was semi-joking with this comment...  you, at least, have a head-<br/>
start on those of us who wish to become less coersive.  My <br/>
biggest problems as a child were being belittled, and having <br/>
expectations placed on me, both low (as in housework and <br/>

the bullying at school...<br/>

have a family time and talk about how nice it is to<br/>

to clean up their room at that age. I think it gets to overwhelming. I would <br/>
always have to be there with them to say, &quot;Ok, now you pick up the legos&quot;, <br/>
and &quot; now get all the dirty clothes to the laundry room&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree. I am also taking out trash bags full of stuff. My older <br/>
boys realise how much this helps and will do it on their own now. But Jenny, <br/>
my 3, can&#39;t do that, so I got rid of 2 trash bags of stuff while she was <br/>
asleep and she hasn&#39;t even missed it. She also loved having all her Barbie <br/>
stuff in a bag and put it all away by herself yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
It does get better as they get older-sort of. They can do more work, but <br/>
they fight with each other all the time. Looking back on it, I enjoyed the <br/>
years when they were young and nice much more even if I did have to do more <br/>
cleaning-constant fighting is worse than a messy house.<br/>
<br/>
Now doesn&#39;t that give you something to look forward to!!<br/>

your set-up isn&#39;t the star-chart thing though, is it?  it&#39;s more like <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t usually keep candies in the house either. I<br/>
only used that for potty training, but I bake and<br/>
While the kids are tidying up I will put something in<br/>
the oven and tell them that if they are finished<br/>
before the treat is then they can have the treat. This<br/>
isn&#39;t something I use all the time. Depends on the<br/>
situation. Also, sometimes instead of a treat I will<br/>
tell them they can&#39;t go play until they are finished.<br/>
This works just as well.  Other times they don&#39;t get<br/>
either just knowing that they helped mommy clean up<br/>
and then they are off to do what they want. It just<br/>
depends on the situation and everyones mood. Corallyn<br/>
