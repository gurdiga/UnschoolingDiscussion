<div id="ygrps-yiv-786273554">any job in the health care feild and possibly the food industry will require <br/>
the immunizations...<br/>
<br/>
Adults who are not immunized nor experience those childhood diseases tend to <br/>
suffer those diseases far worse than the children recieving the immunizations <br/>
or even contracting the diseases...also...I am a nurse...I have to show an <br/>
immunity to measles before I can work in any facility...because...if I should <br/>
contract the disease it is possible for me to pass it on to either pregnant <br/>
patients or pregnant co-workers and measles (I believe the rubella version) <br/>
is devastating to the unborn.  Chicken pox is another disease that is very <br/>
contagious and also devastating to adults...as well as pateints who could be <br/>
HIV positive...<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate a parent not wanting to put thier children thruogh the pains of <br/>
immunizations and I understand the question of whether or not it is very <br/>
necessary today...but in the inner city populations and in the immigrant <br/>
populations (as well as poverty populations) we are seeing a rise in those <br/>
very diseases that the vaccines where supposed to have nearly wiped out.  <br/>
Imagine going to the local store and exposing your child to the neighborhood <br/>
immigrant who has diptheria...without the vaccine...your non-immunized child <br/>
has a greater risk of contracting the disease...and I can tell you there is <br/>
nothing sadder than watching a young child struggle to breath with whooping <br/>
cough...almost as sad is seeing the guilt in the mother&#39;s eyes becuase she <br/>
chose not to vaccinate and she finally realizes that if her child was <br/>
vaccinated she wouldn&#39;t be suffering with the disease...<br/>
<br/>
I hope this isn&#39;t to inflammatory for this group...I know ya&#39;ll have very <br/>
strong beliefs about what ya&#39;ll choose as parents...I can only speak from my <br/>
experiences...and what I see in my profession.  You, as parents have to <br/>
decide what sort of measures you are going to take to protect your children <br/>
not only as children but even as they grow into adults...You have to decide <br/>
that the life ya&#39;ll are living is going to be good enough to protect your <br/>
children from those diseases that we vaccinate against...and you have to <br/>
decide if the descisions you make now are worth the consequences your <br/>
children may have to pay when they are adults...<br/>
<br/>
I chose to vaccinate...long before I became educated enough to understand the <br/>
pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of the issue...and when I finally became educated enough to <br/>
understand the choice I had made...I also became educated enough to be able <br/>
to realize how devastating those diseases are...and also educated enough to <br/>
learn that despite the near disappearance of those diseases...they are also <br/>
on the rise again...so I am glad about the choice I made...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what else to say about the this topic...expect to do alot of <br/>
research...not just the opinions of those on this list...but contact the <br/>
local health department, ask for statistics for your area, think about <br/>
possible future choices that you mite make in where you live, if you decide <br/>
not to vaccinate...and decide to move to another area...research that <br/>
area...find the statistics for that area...although statistics are just <br/>
numbers...at any moment we could become a statistic...check out the diseases <br/>
that we are vaccinated against...learn about the long term effects that the <br/>
disease causes just in case your children happen to contract it some time in <br/>
their lives...Polio can leave some one to live the rest of thier lives in a <br/>
wheelchair...Mumps can leave a boy sterile and unable to have children (do <br/>
you really want to take the chance of not having grandchildren from your <br/>
sons?)...Chicken Pox can leave someone severely disfigured, can affect the <br/>
breathing and swallowing ability during the process of the <br/>
disease...Diptheria is often fatal...tetnus is fatal as well as excruciating <br/>
painful...Look this stuff up in the library or on the internet...don&#39;t go <br/>
into such a life affecting descision as to not vaccinate your children <br/>
without being fully informed...there is more to the issue than not being able <br/>
to attend public school or daycare...<br/>
<br/>
I hoped that I created enough questions that you will not just jump into the <br/>
descision...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886636767">O.K., I debated sending this but felt it was necessary.  This is not meant<br/>
to offend but some of the facts put out by the medical profession leave a<br/>
little bit to be desired.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take adults that get measles, chicken pox and mumps.  What they<br/>
neglect to say is that currently the vast majority of folks getting these<br/>
&quot;childhood&quot; diseases that are having such problems with the diseases are the<br/>
very people who were immunized as children.<br/>
<br/>
For example, there was an outbreak of whooping cough in the Bay Area a<br/>
couple of years ago.  This went through schools like the plague.  Guess<br/>
what, these kids had all had their shots.<br/>
<br/>
The number of deaths and adverse reactions from vaccines far out weigh the<br/>
numbers that use to have severe reactions or die from the diseases<br/>
themselves.  Also, it needs to be noted that knowledge is the real reason<br/>
that there have been reductions in most of these diseases--knowledge of<br/>
proper personal hygiene, knowledge of proper municipal hygiene (water,<br/>
sewage), knowledge of the cause, knowledge in proper care of the patient<br/>
once they contract a disease.<br/>
<br/>
And, again, take Hep B.  More kids are dying of the vaccine than died of the<br/>
disease, plus deaths from the traditional causes of the disease continue<br/>
albeit at a reduced rate *due to* knowledge--knowledge of blood screening,<br/>
knowledge of pretesting before a woman gets pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
So, as others have stated, do your research, but DON&#39;T just rely on what the<br/>
medical profession is telling you by way of the handouts which the<br/>
pharmaceutical companies give them.  After all, to not vaccinate causes a<br/>
big drop in the profits of those multimillionaire drug CEOs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lynda, I agree with you again....  I&#39;m really starting to worry now.<br/>
I know a teenage girl who  had been vaccinated against measles as a child so<br/>
was therefore &quot;immune&quot; to it.  Maybe she was/is, she never had measles,<br/>
however this fake &quot;immunity&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to be able to be passed onto the<br/>
unborn child.   Measles was almost exclusively seen in children over 12<br/>
months of age, but now with all these young Mom&#39;s with immunity from<br/>
vaccines instead of from fighting the illness there is an alarming increase<br/>
in babies getting measles.  The one I am speaking of had to watch her 4<br/>
month old baby become very ill with measles at an age where nature almost<br/>
completely assured that it wouldn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And as sad as a Mother watching her child screaming for three days straight<br/>
because of the vaccine, and being told that he is having a &quot;cerebal&quot;<br/>
reaction to it, which may or may not do brain damage.   The guilt she feels<br/>
is just as bad, if not worse because she wasn&#39;t informed and blames herself<br/>
for just trusting the doctor&#39;s advice.<br/>
Or watching as an &quot;immunised&quot; child almost dies in her arms of pnuemonia, a<br/>
complication of whooping cough, or watch another of her &quot;immunised&quot; children<br/>
go from a healthy 15lb 6 month old to a sickly 11lb 9 month old because he<br/>
couldn&#39;t hold down any food due to the coughing fits assosciated with<br/>
whooping cough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007792026">That is the type guilt trip that pro-vaccinators put on folks.  All mothers<br/>
suffer if their children get ill even if it is the common cold.  However, I<br/>
don&#39;t think putting this sort of nonsense forward is quite in the mode of<br/>
doing anything positive.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, since children still get whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella and<br/>
chicken pox even if they are vaccinated and as young adults/older teenagers<br/>
are now getting all the disease they would have gotten as children in spite<br/>
of having been good little soldiers and gotten their mandatory vaccinations<br/>
which the vast majority would have relatively breezed through, that throwing<br/>
guilt trips is counter productive.<br/>
<br/>
Vaccinations are a gamble, not vaccinating is a gamble.  However, folks need<br/>
to go into it with their eyes wide open instead of simply accepting what<br/>
pharmaceutical companies tell them in their nice shiney little pamphlets<br/>
that leave out the stats and all the adverse reactions and number of deaths.<br/>
