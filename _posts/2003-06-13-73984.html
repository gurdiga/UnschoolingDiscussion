<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640883728">Hello again!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the one who posted the following.  Several of you replied to the last phrase about it taking courage to unschool.  I understand that it takes less courage to unschool than to send your child to public school.  What I was trying to say is closer to the line from the poem about the path less taken.  &quot;I have taken the path less taken and it has made all the difference.&quot;   For me, it is always &#39;easier&#39; to go along with the crowd but that is not necessarily the best route to take.  For me, it would be easier to enroll my daughter in preschool and then public school.  It would be better for her to be homeschooled, I believe.  I am still working out what form that homeschooling would take.  All I knew about unschooling a month ago was what I read in the Homeschooling Almanac.   Thanks for the suggestions of web sites, book suggestions are welcome too.  I am especially interested in the preschool/early elementary stages.  <br/>

OLD POSTING<br/>
My life is a work in progress so I did finish and pass the Kindermusik class.  Gwen is still signed up for kindergarten this fall.  I sent some books on painting (from the home schooling references) to them for summer fun.  I&#39;m thinking and trying out unschooling ideas with my daughter.   I think it takes a lot of courage to unschool.  <br/>

Raine replies: I&#39;m new to the unschooling idea, but I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 7 years. In my experience, I find that my approach, and the materials I utilize, change every year. Some things we outgrow, some things were recommended to me and didn&#39;t really work in the first place... The beauty of it is that my kids learn, despite me!! When my daughter was preschool-age, I had a curriculum of sorts for her. Were I to do it over again, I&#39;d leave her alone! :o)<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents.<br/>

<br/>
I disagree.   Anyone who sends kids to school will be soothed and supported <br/>
by MILLIONS of people, by articles in mainstream magazines, by justifications <br/>
left and right, by &quot;stay in school&quot; billboards and TV ads.  It doesn&#39;t take <br/>
nearly as much courage to relax and float downstream with public opinion, public <br/>
school and public approval.<br/>
<br/>
And the easier homeschooling option is buying a curriclum, following the <br/>
schedule and the instructions, and blaming the curriculum if your child isn&#39;t <br/>
having fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you say it takes courage to unschool, don&#39;t go back on that and say <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re right, it takes more courage to send them to school.&quot;  That&#39;s another <br/>
justification.   Stand your ground courageously, whether it&#39;s real ground or <br/>
philosophical ground!<br/>
<br/>
Here, though, is when ground doesn&#39;t need to be defended, according to my <br/>
beliefs:<br/>
<br/>
Ideas, theories and convictions--three levels of belief.<br/>
<br/>
An idea isn&#39;t worth defending if it can&#39;t be defended honorably and honestly. <br/>
 If it loses to any passing argument, it&#39;s not a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
If the idea seems right and you start really working up WHY you have the idea <br/>
and why it&#39;s worth examining and expanding, then it&#39;s becoming a theory.  Try <br/>
it out in various situations.  Put it out in public to let others poke and <br/>
prod and see if it works in more than your own little situation.  If it does?  <br/>
If it REALLY works from all angles, and you haven&#39;t found it to be weak or <br/>
shaky, then it can become a conviction.<br/>
<br/>
People probably don&#39;t have many convictions, compared to the number of ideas <br/>
they have.  I have hundreds of ideas for each of my few convictions.  Ideas <br/>
come and go like junk mail, like the collection of stuff in the bowl on the <br/>
kitchen counter.  Some gets filed, used, tossed...<br/>
<br/>
But a conviction, that&#39;s worth defending.<br/>
<br/>
It is my conviction that it takes courage to unschool.  It takes creativity, <br/>
energy, stamina and plain old bravery.<br/>
<br/>
We not only have to have ready answers and/or a thick skin for strangers and <br/>
relatives, we have to face the tauntings and insults of the other <br/>
homeschoolers.  We have to hear other homeschoolers who think they&#39;re brilliant because <br/>
they have a schedule and some test scores tell us we&#39;re lazy and unmotivated.    <br/>
It would be easier (and sometimes even cheaper) to just spring for the <br/>
friggin&#39; curriculum and shush up the neighbors and relatives and not-really-friends <br/>
in the homeschooling community.<br/>

Lots are not courageous enough to hang in there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-398929436">Sandra, this whole post is a keeper.<br/>
<br/>
I like thinking about convictions. Might be worth a thread in itself. <br/>
Years ago, I started writing about the fact that so many people <br/>
(women, especially) seemed trapped by their convictions. They <br/>
adopt a belief that they then call a conviction but then can&#39;t adjust <br/>
to a new reality when that conviction is tested and found wanting.<br/>
<br/>
Example: Believing in the top down structure (hierarchy) of father <br/>
to mother to children. Parents watch their families become beds <br/>
of hostility or rebellion and don&#39;t think to reevaluate the conviction <br/>
that their authority may well be misused and instead blame the <br/>
children for failing to line up with the divine order.<br/>
<br/>
Example: Conviction that kids ought to be home and never in <br/>
school meanwhile mother develops debilitiating condition that <br/>
makes her lay on the couch unable to attend to her children. <br/>
Conviction that home is better than an alternative will blind family <br/>
to the fact that mom is unable to do basic things for children and <br/>
therefore home has become a mini prison or even just a chaotic, <br/>
center-less living space with children taking care of mom rather <br/>
than the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
When we are more governed by our ideals or convictions than <br/>
we are by the realities we live in, we can become depressed, <br/>
without power in our own lives and fearful of public opinion rather <br/>
than being grounded in reality-based living that constantly puts <br/>
the well-being of those in our care first.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is what your post made me think of. And I like the <br/>
progression of how an idea becomes a belief and then a <br/>
conviction. Testing beliefs and convictions seems very important. <br/>
And paying attention to your own life and what it&#39;s telling you is <br/>
very necessary.<br/>

<br/>
Years ago, I started writing about the fact that so many people <br/>
<br/>
(women, especially) seemed trapped by their convictions. They <br/>
<br/>
adopt a belief that they then call a conviction but then can&#39;t adjust <br/>
<br/>
to a new reality when that conviction is tested and found wanting. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ADOPT.<br/>
There&#39;s the problem.    <br/>
<br/>
Too many people want to buy a set of beliefs.  They want to adopt convictions <br/>
like they can buy a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
And there are people selling!  There are churches that will tell you what to <br/>
believe, what to wear, what curriculum to buy, who to be friends with, what <br/>
part of town to live in...   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just fundamentalists Christians, though they ARE guilty of <br/>
grammatical murder in their use of the verb &quot;convict.&quot;  Or rather they have made a <br/>
whole NEW verb.<br/>
<br/>
First in the  70&#39;s or so they made a verb out of &quot;fellowship.&quot;  Fellowship is <br/>
a wonderful old English noun.  It became an adjective when so many protestant <br/>
churches built &quot;fellowship halls&quot; onto their buildings.  And after they were <br/>
used to &quot;fellowship hall&quot; as a term, they started &quot;fellowshipping&quot; in them.  <br/>
And out of them!  They started fellowshipping the neighbors, against their will.<br/>
<br/>
A few years passed, and they started thinking God was convicting them.  Not <br/>
of felony, or of grammatical sins, though God SHOULD have convicted them for <br/>
that.   And they don&#39;t even to go a lock-up facility.  They keep ON being <br/>
convicted of this and that, just as they go about their lives.  Many of them are <br/>
convicted (they say) that God wants them to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
And those convictions I don&#39;t think are worth defending either because I <br/>
don&#39;t think they&#39;re convictions in at all the way I&#39;m thinking of someone being <br/>
gradually and deeply CONVINCED (not convicted) over years of carrying around and <br/>
using a belief until it becomes a real conviction.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not just Christians.  I&#39;ve known people to dive into one or another <br/>
of New Age-ish pools and then ask things like &quot;What do we believe about this?&quot;  <br/>
I was at one artsily liberal homeschooling conference years ago at which <br/>
people were just shopping like crazy among vendors and workshops to find out what <br/>
they should best wear, eat, smell, rub into their kids backs and feet, <br/>
WHATeverall they could gather up to be Just Like the other non-conformists.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s human nature, I&#39;m sure.  But it&#39;s kind of embarrassing for those who do <br/>
have their own home-grown, honest and real convictions to be faced with people <br/>
who just got a whole BIG batch of new convictions just the other day.  From <br/>
God.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548377282">Douglas Adams wrote a great essay on &quot;why I&#39;m an atheist&quot; and while it&#39;s very &quot;science-y&quot; it sounds like your thots here Sandra.  It&#39;s published in &quot;Salmon of Doubt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was seeking what they are selling when I was 16 (looking to replace school) got into the Baptist movement of the mid-70&#39;s, met a lot of people who didn&#39;t seem to be selling, but when they &quot;made&quot; me stop fishing on Sunday morning, I could tell they didn&#39;t now where God lived.  So I dumped they and chased fish and the occasional red head (human female, not the duck).<br/>

Since then, I get skin-crawlies when people say they attend church. What are they selling????<br/>
<br/>
Why would I try their convictions?  Why would I listen to bad public speaking on outdated dogma while I CONVICTED that God is swimming with the trout in 20 feet of cold water in Morfee Lake, 1 kilometre from my house?  Why?<br/>

  &lt;&lt; I like thinking about convictions. Might be worth a thread in itself. <br/>
<br/>
  Years ago, I started writing about the fact that so many people <br/>
<br/>
  (women, especially) seemed trapped by their convictions. They <br/>
<br/>
  adopt a belief that they then call a conviction but then can&#39;t adjust <br/>
<br/>
  to a new reality when that conviction is tested and found wanting. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  ADOPT.<br/>
  There&#39;s the problem.    <br/>
<br/>
  Too many people want to buy a set of beliefs.  They want to adopt convictions <br/>
  like they can buy a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
  And there are people selling!  There are churches that will tell you what to <br/>
  believe, what to wear, what curriculum to buy, who to be friends with, what <br/>
  part of town to live in...   <br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s not just fundamentalists Christians, though they ARE guilty of <br/>
  grammatical murder in their use of the verb &quot;convict.&quot;  Or rather they have made a <br/>
  whole NEW verb.<br/>
<br/>
  First in the  70&#39;s or so they made a verb out of &quot;fellowship.&quot;  Fellowship is <br/>
  a wonderful old English noun.  It became an adjective when so many protestant <br/>
  churches built &quot;fellowship halls&quot; onto their buildings.  And after they were <br/>
  used to &quot;fellowship hall&quot; as a term, they started &quot;fellowshipping&quot; in them.  <br/>
  And out of them!  They started fellowshipping the neighbors, against their will.<br/>
<br/>
  A few years passed, and they started thinking God was convicting them.  Not <br/>
  of felony, or of grammatical sins, though God SHOULD have convicted them for <br/>
  that.   And they don&#39;t even to go a lock-up facility.  They keep ON being <br/>
  convicted of this and that, just as they go about their lives.  Many of them are <br/>
  convicted (they say) that God wants them to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
  And those convictions I don&#39;t think are worth defending either because I <br/>
  don&#39;t think they&#39;re convictions in at all the way I&#39;m thinking of someone being <br/>
  gradually and deeply CONVINCED (not convicted) over years of carrying around and <br/>
  using a belief until it becomes a real conviction.<br/>
<br/>
  So it&#39;s not just Christians.  I&#39;ve known people to dive into one or another <br/>
  of New Age-ish pools and then ask things like &quot;What do we believe about this?&quot;  <br/>
  I was at one artsily liberal homeschooling conference years ago at which <br/>
  people were just shopping like crazy among vendors and workshops to find out what <br/>
  they should best wear, eat, smell, rub into their kids backs and feet, <br/>
  WHATeverall they could gather up to be Just Like the other non-conformists.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s human nature, I&#39;m sure.  But it&#39;s kind of embarrassing for those who do <br/>
  have their own home-grown, honest and real convictions to be faced with people <br/>
  who just got a whole BIG batch of new convictions just the other day.  From <br/>
  God.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;An idea isn&#39;t worth defending if it can&#39;t be defended honorably and honestly. <br/>
  If it loses to any passing argument, it&#39;s not a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
  It is my conviction that it takes courage to unschool.  It takes creativity, <br/>
  energy, stamina and plain old bravery.<br/>
<br/>
  Sandra,<br/>
  Just gotta say I love this. I often feel so out there and something about your words made me realise just how true the courage thing is for me. When i have my doubts and go on anyway I really do have to summon up courage. When i live in a town where i know 3 other unschooling families but only have supportive contact with one other family that takes lots of courage. Thanks for those inspiring words cause somedays I wonder how long my courage will last.<br/>

<br/>
Looking back, I think he was working to make his home a good place for his <br/>

Here&#39;s a story from attending Catholic church a few times.  My then-boss&#39;s father was attending same time as us Thomas&#39;.  He&#39;s a millionaire land developer.  Talk about tagging church and being good to go!  This guy was &quot;Screw all the bastards out there I can, even Joe Average needing affordable quality housing, kick a feminist &#39;cause they aren&#39;t real people.&quot;  Father in heaven made him good-to-go on Sunday.  Must have been counting money during the sermon.  Love! Ha!  Fellowship!  Ha!  Make me PUKE!  And he&#39;s alive at 80 and my father&#39;s dead at 64.  Maybe worrying about ethics can give you cancer???<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why would I listen to bad public speaking on outdated dogma...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was on Catholic priest who spoke &quot;human&quot; rather than &quot;dog&quot;ma (what do you call a Dog Ma?)  He was marvelous, tlaked about real stuff, no pouding, no hellfire.  Simple and really benefitted his audience to pay attention.  Loved that.  So, ya, there are good &#39;uns out there.  But I just LOVE to generalise!<br/>

Your courage is as strong as your love. It&#39;s just hasn&#39;t had to be used as much! You are a wondrous woman - or else you wouldn&#39;t be unschooling!<br/>
You have a deep reservoir - you can&#39;t tell, I know - but it&#39;s there.<br/>

  Your courage is as strong as your love. It&#39;s just hasn&#39;t had to be used as much! You are a wondrous woman - or else you wouldn&#39;t be unschooling!<br/>
  You have a deep reservoir - you can&#39;t tell, I know - but it&#39;s there.<br/>
  Believe.<br/>
<br/>
  Take it one step at a time. Look in the mirror and see the woman that is really there - you will see a woman that is quietly making history and making waves.<br/>
<br/>
  You go, girl!<br/>

      Just gotta say I love this. I often feel so out there and something about your words made me realise just how true the courage thing is for me. When i have my doubts and go on anyway I really do have to summon up courage. When i live in a town where i know 3 other unschooling families but only have supportive contact with one other family that takes lots of courage. Thanks for those inspiring words cause somedays I wonder how long my courage will last.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it takes a lot of courage to make the initial leap into unschooling <br/>
because it is a lot of &quot;unknown&quot;  we don&#39;t hear/see a lot of it in mainstream <br/>
society.<br/>
<br/>
We wonder IF we CAN do this because we&#39;re still not sure about how it works.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We gets LOTS of negative feedback from ALL directions sometimes, making one <br/>
doubt one&#39;s self and one&#39;s motives and one&#39;s strength and determination.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m using WE, but I really mean I to make no mistake.  I&#39;m sure there are <br/>
those who had no fear, no apprehension and didn&#39;t even have to &quot;jump&quot; or take a <br/>
leap of faith at all... it just happened or evolved peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are others like me who it was really a leap and took a LOT of <br/>
courage to finally use the term unschooling with friends and family and be <br/>
absolutely sure they could do this because their heart let them know it was best <br/>
for their child/children.<br/>
<br/>
Courage was a good word to use, for some of us who are unschooling anyway.<br/>
