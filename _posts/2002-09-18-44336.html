<div id="ygrps-yiv-789732108">I have been learning the piano for several years myself, off and on.  I<br/>
played in the band all through school so had some understanding of music, at<br/>
least treble clef.  My dd took piano lessons and I asked her questions to<br/>
learn bass clef.<br/>
<br/>
I went to the music store and bought some very simple arrangements of music<br/>
I liked and then just messed around with it.  I learned to play the right<br/>
hand and then the left hand and then put them together.  I don&#39;t use the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; fingerings according to dd but I get the job done.  I have found<br/>
older country music to have fairly easy to master arrangements available.<br/>
