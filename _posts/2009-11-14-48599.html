<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918576319">From a different thread (since I&#39;m starting a new one here):<br/>
<br/>
-=-The equivalent of saying no, is not giving them a choice, no matter  <br/>
how you<br/>
finagle it--a parent using words the children construe as a judgment,  <br/>
is not<br/>
free choice. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then what would &quot;free choice&quot; be?<br/>
Silence on the part of the parents?<br/>
The parents wear a veil so the child can&#39;t perceive a facial  <br/>
expression or a flash of the eyes?<br/>
The parents just not being there so the child can&#39;t perceive a grunt  <br/>
or groan or sigh or body language?<br/>
<br/>
Who said unschooling (or anything) requires &quot;free choice&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I VERY much prefer my children making informed choices.<br/>

I think the mom&#39;s fear and emotional investment that the child make  <br/>
the choice the mom would is part of the difference but the everyday  <br/>
use of &quot;informed choice&quot; doesn&#39;t really exclude that.<br/>
<br/>
Drinking and driving is a similar situation where there&#39;s a clear  <br/>
right choice and a clear wrong choice. Obviously I want Kathryn to  <br/>
make the same choice I would, but I don&#39;t fear that she won&#39;t because  <br/>
I trust her to make sensible choices.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the difference is that the right eating mother can&#39;t inform and  <br/>
then trust her kids to figure out what&#39;s right for them. She informs  <br/>
but also holds tight until she trusts they&#39;ll make the same choices  <br/>
she would.<br/>

If &quot;free choice&quot; is the ideal, and if parental advice or opinion  <br/>
prevents &quot;free choice,&quot; then I want nothing to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids ask advice from me, their dad, siblings, friends of theirs,  <br/>
and they might look on web pages or in books.  They don&#39;t do all of  <br/>
that every single time, but they rarely make a decision about  <br/>
something new or important without talking to two or more people.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that keeps it from being free choice.<br/>
<br/>
When I advise one of my kids, I&#39;m saying what I think they should  <br/>
remember to consider in some particular situation, and why.  That&#39;s  <br/>
not removing their freedom.<br/>
<br/>
The information people have when they make a decision might be scare  <br/>
stories or propaganda or irrefutable fact, or they might have friends  <br/>
telling them all-out lies.  So not all information is equally valuable  <br/>
or useful, but if a child or adult makes a decision without regard to  <br/>
the feelings or knowledge of anyone else on the planet, that&#39;s not  <br/>
&quot;free choice.&quot;  That&#39;s just flailing around, probably.    It&#39;s like  <br/>
throwing darts in the dark, if no one else&#39;s needs or opinions or  <br/>
advice are to be considered.<br/>

Or eating too many twinkies?   I think we just got back to the twinkie defense.  I was throwing darts in the dark because I ate too many twinkies.   Fear, propaganda, food, and choice all rolled into one!<br/>

Such a common scenario!  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A good friend of mine doesn&#39;t eat red meat.  As at the age of 7 (significant age in accordance with Steiner schooling), her daughter is now allowed to *choose* whether she eats meat or not.  Not without a large dose of judgement on behalf of the mother.  At a recent BBQ, the kid was offered a sausage, and the mother went into all the details of where the meat was sourced, the way it is slaughtered, etc,etc, with an obvious tone of coercion.  Obviously her daughter already *knew* all the gory details, yet still she chose to eat the sausage.  &#39;Blah, blah, blah&#39;comes to mind.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that comes to mind with this topic, is how the term &#39;informed&#39; can be muddled with &#39;anti&#39;.  For example, I made an *informed* choice not to vaccinate my kids.  However, I have come to pass many comments that presume I am *anti* vaccination because of this choice.  This is simply not the case.   <br/>
<br/>
I am 36 years old; a child of conventional parenting.  I was raised with the understanding that there is only two ways to do things; right or wrong.  No choices.  During my mid-twenties I dared to go outside the square, and realised for myself there are Other choices.  I think this is why these *other* choices are given such respect.  So many of us were raised with &quot;my way or the wrong way&quot; mentality, that Any other choice seems better!  The excitement and illuminating light shining on the *better* way tends to overshadow the fact that there may be even More choice available.  That the very Freedom to Choose is what is missing the most.  Hope this makes sense -- I have trouble articulating . . .<br/>
