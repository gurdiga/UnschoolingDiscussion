<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You and me both Brenda. Where&#39;d you go? Whatcha see? I went down to GA<br/>
&gt; and come back to this. I was quite surprised and sad about some of the<br/>
&gt; comments made too. :-( I&#39;m thinkin&#39; about moving over to the message boards.<br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t move so fast and I may be able to help out and actually post some<br/>
&gt; more there.<br/>

Tim and I flew to Venice, Italy, and took a cruise to Dubrovnik, Croatia,<br/>
Olympia and Athens, Greece, several Greek Islands, and Istanbul, Turkey.  We<br/>
stopped for a brief visit to Bologna on the way back to the airport.  It was<br/>
great, these are all places you see pictures of or read about but never<br/>
dream of going to. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m bringing photos with me when I come to the states this summer, and I<br/>
promise to not constantly have them out, but they&#39;ll be in my hotel room at<br/>
the conference if you&#39;d like to see them, Barb.<br/>

    Oh I will, I will. :-) Hey do you have the Mississippi coin from last<br/>
year? I came across a Louisiana today I&#39;m saving it for you. Still looking<br/>
for the others. :-)<br/>
