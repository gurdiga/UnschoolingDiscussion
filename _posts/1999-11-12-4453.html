&gt;Jurassic park was absolutely terrifying for small children and even lots of<br/>
&gt;older children.  It was not a movie appropriate for children.  Was it PG? I<br/>
&gt;would hope so. Though from my perspective PG 13 would be a little more bearable.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Point 1 is of course well taken, but what I am finding is that my daughter<br/>
&gt;&gt; self-regulates. If I *were* of the mind (which I&#39;m not) to let her watch<br/>
&gt;&gt; horror movies, she wouldn&#39;t. She&#39;s a sensitive girl. I don&#39;t think most<br/>
&gt;&gt; small children want to watch horrific violence on screen or off, (maybe<br/>
&gt;&gt; sometimes if it&#39;s high fantasy -- i.e, Jurassic Park.)<br/>

children. I said that I knew of no small children who WANTED to watch<br/>
horrific violence, except perhaps &lt;&lt;unspoken phrase segue &quot;some of them<br/>
might want to watch it&quot;&gt;&gt; if it&#39;s high fantasy -- i.e, Jurassic Park.<br/>
<br/>
It is what children WANT to view I was talking about, not what we can debate<br/>
(until the Y2K mutants carry us all off) they SHOULD view.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810752905">We have a pretty &quot;open&quot; movie policy at our home. However, my 10 & 12yo<br/>
have never shown any real interest in violent movies (animes is another<br/>
whole story)...The wierd part of  our home viewing experience relates to<br/>
the film version of Much Ado bout Nothing. <br/>
Being a comedy (not much in the way of violence) I was unprepared for<br/>
the reaction of my 10yod. We all laughed and giggled at the antics of<br/>
the characters...then when the father slaps the daughter....she began to<br/>
sob. She couldn&#39;t believe a father could ever hit a daughter..I guess we<br/>
have to stop and look at each individuals sensitivity for how violence<br/>
creates a lasting impression on us. We stopped the movie and had a long<br/>
discussion on values (along with their modern day degressions) and then<br/>
she understood the situation but by no means APPROVED of it. We watched<br/>
this again last week with the 17yo. 10yo began to explain to her &quot;there<br/>
is a part in the movie your not gonna like, so I&#39;m gonna tell you...&quot;<br/>
