<div id="ygrps-yiv-545069434">Hi. Lego question. Our 7 yr old going on 8 girls  asked for Lego for Xmas and got a tub of assorted  pieces  from a cousin. two base plates and three Harry Potter small sets from us.  Have not played with it  a lot. Right now they are building and  playing -what  is available that would add interest for them? Someone mentioned Lego magazines?  Anything else out there? They dont know anyone who plays Lego-they said their cousin their  age builds it but doesnt play. They get deeply into barbie-animal games.They <br/>
 love &quot;lead ins&quot; for their games.   They are building right now but  usually abandon it in favor of &quot;ready to go&quot; characters. Do most boys like the building part more than the  &quot;story making part&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557012058">Right now both boys prefer to play with the set up Legos (i.e: Harry <br/>
Potter).  When something breaks, my 4yo and dh sit together and fix <br/>
them.  If it is really complicated dh does it and ds will count and <br/>
find pieces, etc.  If it is easy then we will guide him with the <br/>
instruction book.  Lately, he has begun to rebuild some as they break <br/>
or change them himself.  However, most of the time he uses it the <br/>
same way he uses all his action figures.  I am giving him time and <br/>
think the more he interacts with the Legos, the more he will feel <br/>
confident in changing things and making more complex ideas.  Maybe <br/>
they do not feel confident enough to do it on their own yet?  My ds <br/>
doesn&#39;t.  He has a regular set that he does not use on his own too <br/>
often, he needs interaction for these toys otherwise I think he just <br/>
does not know where to begin.  Maybe you can try doing some of it <br/>
with them to get it started?  The Lego magazine is free and they will <br/>
send you a catalog for free!  Enjoy :)<br/>

Lego does have an entire set now themed for girls, called &quot;Lego Bellville&quot;,<br/>
but my beef with it is that only some of the stuff is actually Lego blocks,<br/>
a lot of it is glorified Barbie. Even better is the old Lego Paradisa, which<br/>
you can still get on Ebay. That was mostly true Lego, but in more pinks and<br/>
purples and pale yellows and blues, and they had sets like horse stables and<br/>
Dolphin Bay and such. I think I&#39;m going to get some for my daughter.<br/>

<br/>
My son plays a lot with the minifigs (little Lego people) and has built an<br/>
entire world of their characters. Each of his minifigs has a name, a job,<br/>
and specific clothes in this world he&#39;s created. I am simply in awe of the<br/>
places that Lego has taken him in his creativity. He is an engineer-type of<br/>
kid and always designing and building things, but the minifigs have truly<br/>
opened up his creative side as well. Most of his friends that are boys<br/>
however do not do this, they stick with building space ships or whatever and<br/>
the minifigs are just props to fly around in the airplanes. Mackenzie gets<br/>
really upset when they come over and take apart his &quot;Ojos&quot; (his world of<br/>
people) and put different heads on different people. So sometimes with<br/>
certain friends we have to put all the people up. To him, they really are<br/>
distinct people, so it&#39;s upsetting if they&#39;re taken apart. I guess they&#39;re<br/>
more like dolls in a sense.<br/>
