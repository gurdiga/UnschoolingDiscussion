Astounding.   Not only is there room in my pajamas for a 14 foot<br/>

Still not an emperor of anything as far as I can tell, but if I can stay<br/>

I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s someone from a family where weight is made a big issue.  <br/>
Wasn&#39;t there someone here (or at the forum?) going on (and off) about an <br/>
overweight child with behavior issues?  <br/>
<br/>
Well, whoever it was, it hurt him (or her) more than it did me.  <br/>
And his mom, or whoever told him someone had been mean to her didn&#39;t do me <br/>
any harm, but did the peace of her family some big damage.  <br/>
<br/>
Kind of, someone tried to use the bathroom in his pants on my porch, but <br/>
since it was only e-mail, all the real shit stayed at his house!<br/>

Strange how much looks play a part.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known some skinny, ugly, nice people<br/>
and some fat, ugly, nice people<br/>
and some skinny, ugly, mean people<br/>

Someone&#39;s maybe too hung up on looks?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496368485"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Things change inside people, if the people want to change.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On another list some people were ranting about unrealistic &quot;lofty <br/>
ideals&quot; when it comes to unschooling (in other words not wanting to <br/>
make any uncomfortable changes and so calling those <br/>
changes &quot;unrealistic&quot; even when many people manage joyfully).<br/>
I said something to the effect of: I don&#39;t always live up to my <br/>
ideals, but I do stay focused on what my ideals are and work toward <br/>
them.  Someone posted something huffy like- but don&#39;t you see a <br/>
difference between living up to your own ideals and living up to <br/>
ideals that someone else has *put* on you?  I don&#39;t get how someone <br/>
can put an ideal on me and make me live it.<br/>
<br/>
I think mabye what she meant was that if someone opens our eyes to <br/>
something that makes sense but we aren&#39;t ready to make the paradigm <br/>
shift we now have to live with the guilt of knowing a better way and <br/>
still not living it.<br/>
It reminds me of a friend (whose kids are in school) who started <br/>
reading Dumbing Us Down out of curiosity but quickly put it down <br/>
since it made so much sense and she didn&#39;t want to feel guilty about <br/>
sending them.  So... is that it?  I don&#39;t want to feel guilty so I <br/>
don&#39;t want to hear it?  I can&#39;t imagine any other meaning <br/>
of &quot;putting one&#39;s ideals&quot; on someone else.  <br/>
<br/>
I also can&#39;t imagine someone using the phrase &quot;putting your ideals <br/>
on me&quot; if those ideals *didn&#39;t* resonate with them. <br/>
I guess it&#39;s much more comfortable to turn away, cover your ears, <br/>
(or censor the posts so nobody has to take an uncomfortable closer <br/>
look at what they&#39;re saying).<br/>

personal?! There are many people with whom I don&#39;t agree on some things, <br/>
sometimes lots of things (some of them good friends!), but I still don&#39;t see the <br/>
need to hate or even dislike them-much less disparage or attack them. Sheesh-its <br/>
that same old &quot;if everyone were exactly the same...&quot; thing. I have some <br/>
pretty good friends that have ideas radically different from my ideas, they are <br/>
still good people and I can learn things from them and have fun with them... I <br/>
just don&#39;t get it...<br/>

&lt;&lt; I also can&#39;t imagine someone using the phrase &quot;putting your ideals <br/>
<br/>
on me&quot; if those ideals *didn&#39;t* resonate with them. <br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s much more comfortable to turn away, cover your ears, <br/>
<br/>
(or censor the posts so nobody has to take an uncomfortable closer <br/>
<br/>
look at what they&#39;re saying). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it happens when people are not really very analytical and have come <br/>
around for social-life.   They want others to say &quot;Ooooh, you&#39;re an unschooler <br/>
just like WE are.  Welcome, welcome, how&#39;s your dog?  What kind of flowers are <br/>
in your yard?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t want to change.  They might not even want to unschool.  They are <br/>
needy of affirmation and they&#39;re not wanting to figure out what their audience <br/>
really wants.   So (maybe, in Howard Gardner&#39;s kind of terms) having a lack of <br/>
interest in or inability to really look at themselves or others, they get <br/>
angry if others can and are looking deeply and carefully and clearly at <br/>
themselves and others.  <br/>
<br/>
There are people out there (women, mostly) who will tell other people <br/>
whatever nice, positive thing they want to hear.   That can only really be done if <br/>
the speaker honestly, truly, doesn&#39;t know or care about the person in any way <br/>
whatsoever, or if they&#39;re just in the habit of not looking but just &quot;being <br/>
pleasant&quot; and agreeing with anyone anytime.   Once you&#39;re out of the room, good <br/>
luck.  But while you&#39;re there, you&#39;re a friend, and they&#39;ll groom and stroke.    <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s a mothering instinct gone on beyond.  In some cases it&#39;s <br/>
cowardice.  In other cases, though, it&#39;s that element of deep lack of self esteem and <br/>
conviction that is the central theme of The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes.  Will you be <br/>
honest even if others might be offended?  Will you believe that others see <br/>
something, and agree that you see it, just to go along with the group?  Do you <br/>
doubt your own convictons and perceptions so much that you&#39;ll say &quot;Ooooh, yeah, <br/>
that&#39;s nice.  You&#39;re right!  I hadn&#39;t thought of that.  You&#39;re so smart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But all those mental health issues aside, this list exists so that <br/>
unschoolers and those interested in unschooling can discuss how and why it works and <br/>
what can keep it from working as well as it could.  It&#39;s not a group therapy <br/>
session (though some figure out how to take comfort and growth-clues and to <br/>
process some of their childhood stuff) and it&#39;s not a ladies&#39; teaparty where we say <br/>
&quot;nice hat! lovely weather&quot; out front and &quot;did you see that stupid hat?&quot; later. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
If someone writes here that she&#39;s been thinking, and she&#39;s sorry she ever <br/>
spanked kids, those who are NOT wanting to be sorry they spanked their kids, or <br/>
still do, might think she&#39;s putting her ideals on them.  I could make a dozen <br/>
other examples.  But the only way to avoid that is for us all to give up ideals <br/>
and just put all our kids in school, discipline the way our moms or neighbors <br/>
do/did,  give them allowance on par with neighbor kids (and withhold it <br/>
whenever the hell we want to because they&#39;re our kids and it&#39;s our money), have a <br/>
bedtime like the neighbors, and then all the neighbors will be happier and we <br/>
won&#39;t have to think.<br/>
<br/>
That was tried already.  It was the 1950&#39;s and early 60&#39;s.   There was a <br/>
yuppie resurgence in the 1980&#39;s.   There seem to have been some problems with the <br/>
outcomes.<br/>
