<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310808472"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Where would you all suggest finding a working<br/>
&gt; typewriter for cheap?? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One idea I thought of is to look into<br/>
www.freecycle.org. Its a Yahoo group. They have groups<br/>
in many areas around the country/world. See if there<br/>
is one in your area. Its about recycling things you<br/>
have (OFFER) or posting things you&#39;re looking for<br/>
(WANTED). No exchange of money. Very cool!<br/>
