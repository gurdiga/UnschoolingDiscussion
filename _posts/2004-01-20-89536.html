<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612252573">There were 20 pending messages in the queue and rather than write separate <br/>
letters, I will say that some were deleted for being one or two word agreement <br/>
messages which then quoted long, long stretches of the post they were agreeing <br/>
with.   If anyone feels the need to have had someone say &quot;Yes!&quot; assume it was <br/>
to one of yours.<br/>
<br/>
Some were deleted for being purely about religion and not at all one bit <br/>
about the effect of religion on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Some were deleted because the person had only been on the list for a few days <br/>
and was going on about things that weren&#39;t going to help others get to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Some were approved.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the batch notification, but it can also serve as a reminder that <br/>
&quot;Cool!&quot; and &quot;Right on!&quot; are not important enough to fill up those digests and <br/>
mailboxes with, we should all try to stay no more than once-removed from topic <br/>
(twice-removed leads nowhere) and that people very new to the list should just <br/>
read for a week or two before posting.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you; sorry; have a nice day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
