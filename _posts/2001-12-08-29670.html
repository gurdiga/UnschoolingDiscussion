<div id="ygrps-yiv-759195202">My girls are twelve and twenty-two.  Carrie never<br/>
attended school until after testing for her GED and<br/>
ACT.  Then she attended community college, and did<br/>
quite well.  Phoenix spent three days in third grade. <br/>
  I work full-time.  I take Phoenix to local<br/>
activities like park hikes guided by naturalists and a<br/>
sign language class, things which are mostly free. <br/>
This year she started art classes at a nearby<br/>
foundation, which are not free.  We watch movies and<br/>
news together, discussing whatever comes up in the way<br/>
of social issues, geography, history, use of language,<br/>
and this often leads to research at the library, on<br/>
the internet, or in our own private library.  She is<br/>
accustomed to accompanying me everywhere I go, and so<br/>
she has first-hand exposure to practical math as it<br/>
relates to shopping, banking, etc.  I habitually<br/>
explain everything I do, and prepare her for new<br/>
situations by explaining as much as I know can be<br/>
expected.  And I answer all questions.  While I&#39;m at<br/>
work Phoenix stays with her sister, who works third<br/>
shift.  They go out shopping or siteseeing together,<br/>
or watch movies, or use the computers.  Phoenix reads<br/>
a lot, and I often suggest books I have found<br/>
interesting or important.  Sometimes she snubs my<br/>
suggestions, but often rethinks later and asks for the<br/>
title/author so she can locate the books.  She likes<br/>
to bake, sew, crochet, and is learning to play chess. <br/>
Each time a new interest sparks, I gather whatever<br/>
materials she needs.  I don&#39;t care if she continues<br/>
more than a day with any particular hobby or subject,<br/>
because she is learning something and experiencing<br/>
something that will stay with her and lead her in new<br/>
directions.  When Carrie was fourteen I bought her a<br/>
GED manual, which is about the size of a Sears<br/>
catalog.  I told her that if she wanted to be able to<br/>
take her GED test in a few years and attend college or<br/>
just be able to show her diploma for job-search<br/>
purposes, she would need to study that manual. Mostly<br/>
she watched tv, read, wrote to penpals (we didn&#39;t have<br/>
a computer then).  At sixteen she wanted to earn<br/>
money, so I helped her find  work and learn her new<br/>
jobs (she telephoned during her breaks).  I taped the<br/>
GED programs on public television.  She watched those<br/>
and studied the manual, along with additional<br/>
materials suggested.  For one year the three of us<br/>
attended city council meetings,  where we learned a<br/>
bit about the law, met local people, learned more<br/>
about the city and county, got to know local police<br/>
and firefighters, and were even invited to attend the<br/>
city government&#39;s Christmas party.  We took a first<br/>
aid class with the firefighters.  I believe I am<br/>
obligated to protect my children, and for me that<br/>
includes not sending them out into the world on their<br/>
own.  Since I&#39;m not allowed to sit alongside them in<br/>
public school, then they don&#39;t need to attend.  Even<br/>
working next door to the school, I was not called when<br/>
Phoenix was injured.  And the school would not allow a<br/>
parent to forbid paddling.  Learning is a natural<br/>
lifelong activity.  I see no reason to make it painful.<br/>
