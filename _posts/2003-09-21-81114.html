<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133603213">Hi!<br/>
I was thinking about signing up for Netflix or Mentura.  I am interested in all the IMAX movies at Mentura for myself.  Since Netflix doesn&#39;t allow you to have access to the titles in their film library like Mentura I don&#39;t have a sense of what Netflix has.  Has anyone ever used either company?  Do you have to wait forever for the DVDs on your list, so you end up not getting DVDs regularly?  I was curious about that.<br/>
 <br/>
Are there other companies besides Mentura or Netflix that I can check out?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for any info.!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mentura is very slow, in my experience.  They have only one shipping point, <br/>
from California.  We sent back dvds on Saturday last, Monday and Wednesday.  <br/>
Nothing in return yet and no indication that they have received them.  <br/>
<br/>
netflix has the reputation of getting them to you quicker.  We&#39;re hoping to <br/>
switch.  I can&#39;t imagine they wouldn&#39;t have Imax, the ones we&#39;ve gotten from <br/>
Mentura have been great.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s our experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824791909">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
I replied to you on another list (I think) that you can see the lists of movies, by clicking the &quot;categories&quot; tab at the bottom of the netflix homepage.  <br/>
<br/>
I am also interested in experiences people have had with either service, because I am thinking of signing up for one of them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-178702287">Netflix is fast. Also - you CAN see their listings without signing up.  <br/>
Here&#39;s how:<br/>
<br/>
On their front screen (netflix.com) go to the very very bottom where  <br/>
there is a little line of words/links just above the copyright and  <br/>
terms of use information. On the far right it says &quot;categories&quot; - click  <br/>
on that.<br/>
<br/>
They do have IMAX movies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567738101">We return DVDs to Netflix and get the new ones two days later, every time.  It probably depends where you live , of course.  We are in Ga.and I have heard they have a warehouse here.  Netflix has lots of documentaries, including Nat&#39;l. Geographic ones;  i haven&#39;t seen Imax films but I will look later when I have a chance if no one else knows in the meantime.  We love Netflix!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875831581">You can get a visa debit card which will work just like a credit card (except for renting autos).  I just wouldn&#39;t recommend having it through your regular checking account.  <br/>
