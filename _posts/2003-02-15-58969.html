&quot;boffo&quot; points on Destructo Match for her kids.  LOL  Lanora finally asked me <br/>
to stop doing it on her account cuz she was feeling guilty about the points <br/>
not being &quot;earned&quot;.  Now Jonathan is racking them up like crazy.  *grin*<br/>

<br/>
It is quite the &quot;mom game,&quot; isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
The Nintendo games I&#39;ve become good at (some of the only ones that even <br/>
caught my personal &quot;hand me the controller&quot; interest) are Dr. Mario and <br/>
Kirby&#39;s Avalanche, both cascading pattern games.<br/>
<br/>
One night a year and some ago, there was a show-down.  I was upstairs doing <br/>
something, and heard the Dr. Mario music from downstairs.  I went down and <br/>
Mary said he knew it would lure me down.  Turns out they had a male teenaged <br/>
friend who was also good at Dr. Mario, and they wanted me to play him.  <br/>
Pressure!  I lost, but barely and after a long, long set.<br/>
<br/>
So they planned and out&#39;n&#39;out tournament.  Several kids practiced.  I lost to <br/>
Eric, that same guy, but he didn&#39;t win at all easily. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
