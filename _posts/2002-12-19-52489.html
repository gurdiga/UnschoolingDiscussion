<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703963517">I&#39;ve been lurking on the list for several days; I thought it was time to<br/>
introduce myself.  My name is Debbie, I&#39;m 29 years old, married to Tom, also<br/>
29; we live in North Texas.  We have 9-year old fraternal twin daughters and<br/>
a baby boy who is almost 16 months old.  Maggie and Kate are in 3rd grade at<br/>
a public school currently--but only until tomorrow!  We made the decision to<br/>
start homeschooling them when they would come home from school complaining<br/>
about being bored all day.  They&#39;re both in the Gifted (whatever that means<br/>
:)) program at school but it&#39;s just not enough; they&#39;re waaaay beyond the<br/>
other students.  After deciding to homeschool, I started doing research and<br/>
discovered unschooling.  Ah, finally, something that seems like how we<br/>
already live our non-school lives.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone we&#39;ve told so far has been supportive of our endeavor, but we<br/>
haven&#39;t told Tom&#39;s parents yet.  MIL is an elementary school teacher; FIL is<br/>
a high school teacher.  One SIL  is an elementary teacher; the other is an<br/>
aide in MIL&#39;s class.  It&#39;s not going to be easy for them to understand why<br/>
we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re doing.  Any thoughts on how we can word it so that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like an attack on them personally?  Obviously, it&#39;s not, but<br/>
I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s how they&#39;re going to hear it no matter what we say.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going back into lurk mode until I get a handle on who everyone is.<br/>

Say &quot;We&#39;re going to try homeschooling for a while.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s less heart-stopping than &quot;They will not see the inside of a classroom <br/>
again unless it is over our dead bodies.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263345694">LOL, thanks, Sandra.  That&#39;s how I&#39;ve been putting it to other people, so<br/>
maybe it&#39;ll work on the ILs as well.<br/>
