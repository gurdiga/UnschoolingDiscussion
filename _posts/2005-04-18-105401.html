<div id="ygrps-yiv-285476054">Hi Bob<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t gotten into the discussion heretofore, but reading it has been <br/>
interesting. I just wanted to interject an empathetic thump on the back, <br/>
along with a recommendation. Don&#39;t consider this &quot;the wrong place.&quot; If you <br/>
want to change how you think about education, parenting, relationships with <br/>
your kids and others...then stick around. Read a LOT. Read an article or a <br/>
thread, then read some more. Read at the unschooling.com forum. I don&#39;t know <br/>
the URL for that one, but it&#39;s got lots of good stuff, too.<br/>
<br/>
Know that many people come to visit here, and get a feeling of &quot;woah! nelly&quot; <br/>
at the plethora of responses to questions, etc. This happened to me when I <br/>
first started reading here, two years or so ago. And I must say, I&#39;m a <br/>
different person than I was back then. I also know more about what <br/>
unschooling is. My off-the-cuff, knee jerk impression of unschooling was <br/>
that it is a completely and totally hands-off approach, with objective, <br/>
uninvolved parents, and no interaction between parent and child. The image I <br/>
had in my mind was one of kids out of control while parents pulled their <br/>
hair out, wondering what to do, because &quot;Oh, no! what can we do? we can&#39;t <br/>
tell them how to behave! they want to do this, and we can&#39;t do a thing about <br/>
it! oh, no!&quot; That isn&#39;t it at all.<br/>
<br/>
with unschooling, the parent is sort of like a guide. An observant, <br/>
interested, involved guide, helping the kids take on their world, without <br/>
putting up barriers that needn&#39;t be there. Need there be barriers? Well, <br/>
yeah. They have to live in a world where some behaviors are frowned upon. <br/>
Swearing for example. It&#39;s entirely possible to allow any language inside <br/>
the family, while giving the kids guidance about how the world thinks about <br/>
certain types of language. So, the barrier would be along the lines of &quot;by <br/>
the way, most adults don&#39;t like it when kids say shit.&quot; or perhaps defining <br/>
a word. I have a friend whose boys started using the term &quot;gay wad&quot; left and <br/>
right. Pre-teens. She explained what that term actually meant, without <br/>
telling them they couldn&#39;t say such things, and... they stopped using that <br/>
term.<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyway. Don&#39;t ditch. Even if you don&#39;t post, do continue to read. And <br/>
DO continue to ask questions. It&#39;s pretty average for a newbie to throw a <br/>
few things into the mix, and get PLENTY of responses, that might make you <br/>
feel defensive. This list tells it like it is, and doesn&#39;t mince words, and <br/>
has lots of wisdom and warmth (and some heat!) If you keep on absorbing, <br/>
you&#39;ll &quot;get&quot; the flavor of the place, and come to appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, HeidiC (a different Heidi)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;m just the new guy asking some questions. And seeing as I don&#39;t even <br/>
&gt;understand this<br/>
&gt;stuff yet, I certainly don&#39;t know how to preview my posts to ensure that I <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t say<br/>
&gt;anything that might be deemed counterproductive. It&#39;s not my intent, but I <br/>
&gt;reserve the<br/>
&gt;right to screw up now and then. Perhaps I&#39;m in the wrong place. I see now <br/>
&gt;that this is for<br/>
&gt;discussion. I&#39;m certainly not able to &quot;discuss&quot; this with you folks as I <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know what I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;doing. </span></blockquote></div>

---------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Elevator etiquette.<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t live in a big elevator town, so my kids rarely ride in an  elevator, <br/>
but they understand the etiquette from watching and from a few  pointers when <br/>
they were little.  I told them in the same way I would&#39;ve  told an adult <br/>
visitor from a place with no elevators.  Last in, first out;  move to the back.  <br/>
If you&#39;re nearest the buttons, it&#39;s nice to ask those  entering which floor <br/>
they need.  If you enter and can&#39;t reach the buttons,  but your floor&#39;s already <br/>
pressed, it&#39;s polite to non-verbally indicate that  you&#39;re good and the one <br/>
nearest doesn&#39;t need to press anything (whether he had  offered to or not).  <br/>
 <br/>
When I go to a cafeteria I&#39;ve never been to, it&#39;s GREAT for someone to tell  <br/>
me what the routine is.  They don&#39;t all work the same way.  <br/>
 <br/>
My kids were born into a world with lots of routines and traditions, and I  <br/>
just share those as they come along, and we discuss how it used to be, why  <br/>
things changed, how it might be someday.  That ties everything  together.  We <br/>
were just talking yesterday about how easy it is for kids  online to meet friends <br/>
of friends, not just electronically but in person,  eventually, sometimes.  <br/>
Not so when I was a kid. If they didn&#39;t go to our  school and there wasn&#39;t a <br/>
party, it wasn&#39;t easy to meet other kids&#39; other  friends.  And in the 19th <br/>
century and before, LOTS of introductions were  made by letter.  Sometimes a letter <br/>
mailed ahead.  Sometimes a letter  hand-carried by the introductee.   A guy <br/>
shows up with letter from the  person&#39;s relative or friend in another city, <br/>
recommending him as a good guy and  obligating the receiver to entertain him at <br/>
least once (a meal, a stay,  something).  People weren&#39;t even supposed to talk <br/>
to people to whom they  hadn&#39;t been formally introduced, yet some of the <br/>
formal introductions were like  blindsidings.   VERY different.<br/>
 <br/>
I COULD just tell my kids what to do, but I much prefer to tell them WHY  <br/>
people do things they do, and what I know has happened in worst-case scenarios,  <br/>
or which things are vestiges of older traditions, and which are vitally  <br/>
important or new.  There are courtesies about parking and driving, putting  the <br/>
trash out, bringing the mail in, answering the phone--all KINDS of things,  and <br/>
if they understand those in a thoughtful and aware way, they&#39;ll be better in  <br/>
the future with roommates and spouses, with neighbors, at work...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a newbee (sp), but I have posted a few times.  This etiquette <br/>
thing reminds me of a recent situation with my youngest.  We decided <br/>
to try Tae Kwon Do at the local library, and the instructor was <br/>
adamant about the use of the titles; &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;ma&#39;am.&quot;  We don&#39;t <br/>
expect our children to use those at home, but living in the South <br/>
can create some awkward situations.  So awkward, that a friend of <br/>
ours told us a story involving their son at the local elementary <br/>
school that was part of the reason for pulling their son out of the <br/>
school.  The teacher was demanding the term ma&#39;am when answering yes <br/>
or no, but the son didn&#39;t use it at home either.  So, I&#39;ve explained <br/>
to my son that the terms are a signt of respect that is used and <br/>
part of the program. &quot;When in Rome...<br/>
