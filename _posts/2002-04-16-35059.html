&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way, what would be REALLY helpful to me would be to hear from anyone <br/>

&gt; home.  That is the nut I am trying to crack.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I worked from home, doing statistical consulting, for years. It was hard. I <br/>
almost always seemed to have a HUGE deadline, requiring me to focus hours and <br/>
hours per day for a week or so, RIGHT when one of the kids seemed to be <br/>
having a special need for a lot of my time. They seemed to &quot;entertain&quot; <br/>
themselves (which my mother constantly reminds me is only because I made sure <br/>
they had an environment around them that allowed that) so much of the time, <br/>
that it seemed like I ought to be able to work. But I found myself constantly <br/>
frustrated and fatigued from the stress. I phased it out and stuck to more <br/>
working outside the home, evenings, and just a little at home - grading <br/>
papers, etc., and that has been better for me.<br/>
<br/>
So - my problem was the deadlines - and the rush work. I didn&#39;t have control <br/>
over WHEN I did my work - it was sort of all or nothing style. I&#39;d get a <br/>
consulting job and they&#39;d need 100 hours of work done in a week.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the point would be that it is CERTAINLY possible to work-- the kids <br/>
don&#39;t need us hovering over them. But we need a lot of flexibility in the <br/>
work - can it be put off until evening? Done early in the morning? Put off <br/>
until another day if a kid needs a lot of your time that day? Those are the <br/>
kinds of questions I&#39;d ponder.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We also run a home based business. But since it&#39;s a contracting <br/>
business a large portion of the actual work (building anyway) is done <br/>
outside our home.<br/>
I answer the phone and do customer service calls...follow up with <br/>
customers and quotes and what not.<br/>
I also work outside the home 2-3 nights per week when dh is here with <br/>
the children.<br/>
Since the work at home part for me is sporadic and mostly just some <br/>
phone calling, it&#39;s fairly easy to balance with the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle.<br/>
In fact, my kids have learned a great deal about the realities of a <br/>
home business and the struggle to get something like this up and <br/>
running.<br/>
The part that is difficult is having no office space in our small <br/>
house.<br/>
The desk is right in the living room basically....which is a <br/>
challenge when trying to sound professional (baby cooing in <br/>
background, kids screaming etc...). The kids are very well trained to <br/>
freeze when the business phone rings and pause any activity until I&#39;m <br/>
done.<br/>
The baby is another matter....Trevor will usually grab him and <br/>
entertain him breifly. Or I grab the phone and head out the door <br/>
while answering!!<br/>
Sitting on the porch is a great place for chatting with a customer.<br/>
And I have the added benefit of getting a &#39;lil sunshine!!<br/>
I&#39;m sure some of the customers wonder why there are such loud bird <br/>
and airplane noises in the background.....LOL<br/>
What type of home business are you doing? Or are you just in the <br/>
planning stages?<br/>
It has been both a very stressful and very rewarding career choice <br/>
for our family!<br/>
I&#39;m glad we struck out and did our own thing, but some days I&#39;d love <br/>
to have some company  medical insurance or retirement plan.<br/>
You give up certain securities in exchange for certain freedoms that <br/>
running your own business allows.<br/>
It sure fits in with my unschooling philosophies though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What type of home business are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do medical transcription.  I learned how to do it while Liam was in-arms <br/>
because we (DH and I) knew that I was not going to go back to full-time, <br/>
outside-the-house work and stick Liam in some kind of daycare scene.  We&#39;re <br/>
both musicians but in order to make a real good living we would have to be <br/>
traveling a lot and away from home a lot and neither of us wanted to do <br/>
that while Liam was really young.  So, DH teaches privately and works at a <br/>
local college and I sit at home and type.<br/>
<br/>
What makes this so challenging is that medical transcription requires my <br/>
full attention while I&#39;m doing it.  I can look off out the window to see a <br/>
bird or something like that for a moment, but my ears, my brain, and my <br/>
body are committed while I&#39;m working.  And, because I am paid by <br/>
production, it behooves me to get my work done without interruption, <br/>
whenever I can.<br/>
<br/>
I try to do most of my work before Liam gets up in the morning, so I&#39;ll get <br/>
up around 2 or 3 in the morning and type like a maniac, but sometimes I&#39;m <br/>
just too tired or there is no work available at that time.  There are lots <br/>
of times when I have to work while he&#39;s awake, and then it&#39;s just breaks my <br/>
heart.<br/>
<br/>
We only just got a television set when we took him out of school (we never <br/>
had one before), and while we don&#39;t get cable and there&#39;s no reception, we <br/>
borrow video tapes from the library.  He loves things like Power Rangers <br/>
and Star Wars, and Scooby Doo is his favorite.  He has to watch these by <br/>
himself, though, and it makes me sad.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s very understanding about my work, but it still feels challenging to <br/>
me.  This is all very new to us, and all he wants to do is play.  There are <br/>
not a lot of kids around (well, none, really) during the day during school <br/>
hours, and playing with other kids is what he craves.  So, he plays with <br/>
his Legos and makes up interesting dramas with his toys and he uses his <br/>
computer quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, Liam has lost none of his baby teeth yet, although he&#39;s <br/>
approaching 7-1/2 years of age.  I often wonder about the correlation <br/>
between that and his readiness for more &quot;academic&quot; learning.  He&#39;s totally <br/>
not into it.  He knows that I&#39;m not going to push him in any way, and he <br/>
feels safe at home (which makes me so glad!).  I wonder if anyone else has <br/>
had experiences with this type of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the answers!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; The desk is right in the living room basically....which is a <br/>

<br/>
We also own a construction business and most of the people I<br/>
talk to  (especially the women) always say something sweet about<br/>
the kid/baby noises in the background.  I have an office, but it is<br/>
open to the house and the kids often play in here with me, as they<br/>
are doing right now. They are playing some addition game seeing<br/>
who can answer 6 + 6 the fastest (giving the littlest a turn even if <br/>
he isn&#39;t the fastest).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The kids are very well trained to <br/>
 freeze when the business phone rings and pause any activity until I&#39;m <br/>

<br/>
How in the heck did you do that?  No matter what, the phone rings,<br/>
I holler QUIET and they &quot;usually&quot; simmer down.  Dh often takes his<br/>
calls outside too LOL.  And my youngest, just doesn&#39;t get it when<br/>
I am on the phone, will come up to me with a request, used to be<br/>
full volume, now he just whispers loudly LOL.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m glad we struck out and did our own thing, but some days I&#39;d love <br/>
 to have some company  medical insurance or retirement plan.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are some alternatives available in terms of medical coverage. For<br/>
instance in CA we have Blue Cross which offers a major medical<br/>
plan. So if you go to the hospital or urgent care you are covered <br/>
80/20 like many plans with a deductible of your choice ($1000 for<br/>
us).  You only pay that deductible the first year if you are <br/>
diagnosed with an illness that needs repeated treatment. Office<br/>
visits you pay for which can be a concern as many things are<br/>
going to outpatient visits.  Since we do everything alternative,<br/>
homebirth, naturopath, chiro & homeopathy, that stuff is seldom<br/>
covered or if it is you still have to pay 50% anyhow so why<br/>
increase your premiums to $400 a month to cover a $50 or $75<br/>
visit once a year?  You can also invest in an IRA for yourself and<br/>
your husband.  We incorporated and have reaped many tax <br/>
benefits, we can also now offer ourselves retirement plans<br/>
(being an employee of the corporation we offer it to all our<br/>
employees, including ourselves) and other health insurance<br/>
options.  Actually, we are investing in real estate as our retirement<br/>
plan. But thats a whole &#39;nother story (and business) &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
And to answer the other mom regarding how we unschool with<br/>
a business, I would say it flows really nicely here. I have three<br/>
kids who play together all the time.  I work on Mondays and<br/>
several years ago I started hiring office help. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
do a lot of that stuff anymore and have other business projects<br/>
in the works.  Doing the repetitive is too time consuming for me now<br/>
a days. But I still talk to customers and collect money (gotta<br/>
have my finger in that pie &lt;g&gt;) and the customers like me<br/>
and dh.  I think they often hire us because we are a nice family<br/>
working together.  The kids go on our errands, many customers<br/>
have watched our kids grow.  As they get older they will have<br/>
the opportunity to do more and learn more if they so choose.  <br/>
I should clarify, I don&#39;t just work on Mondays but that is the day<br/>
that I really focus and that my assistant comes in. I work on<br/>
and off every day of the week but only a few minutes or hours <br/>
here and there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;You give up certain securities in exchange for certain freedoms that <br/>
 running your own business allows.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not necessarily. There are no guarantees when working for someone <br/>
else that you will always have a job. But I know what you are saying<br/>
especially when the money isn&#39;t coming in (or 60-90 day pays) and its<br/>
slow season etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;It sure fits in with my unschooling philosophies though.<br/>
