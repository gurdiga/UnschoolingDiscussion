I hear you loud and clear.  People who look down their noses at manual labor<br/>
are often clueless anyway.  Manual labor work is some of the best work there<br/>
is in terms of what you get out of it.  A lot of it beats office politics by<br/>
miles and miles.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the job does not make the person, though<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because they have no life outside of<br/>

Manual Labor: An Attractive Career for the College-Educated<br/>
By John O. Andersen<br/>
May 10, 1998<br/>
        Manual labor conjures up negative images for many people. Some think<br/>
that making a living with their hands is beneath their potential. When<br/>
parents encourage their children to have high career aspirations, this<br/>
invariably means some form of white-collar work. Have you ever heard of an<br/>
honors student whose career goal was to become a plumber or house painter?<br/>
<br/>
        Manual labor careers are clustered near the bottom of the job status<br/>
hierarchy. Yet if the truth be told, many of us truly enjoy manual labor. We<br/>
love to show off our manicured gardens, and remodeling projects. We also<br/>
like to brag about the leak we fixed, or the old motor we rebuilt. Work<br/>
which employs both our brains and our brawn is good for us and feels right.<br/>
<br/>
        There are many people who recognize this and a few of those who are<br/>
actually turning down white-collar careers in order to do manual labor.<br/>
Perhaps this unconventional choice stems from a growing desire among workers<br/>
for more authenticity and meaning in their work. They just want to be real<br/>
people when they go to work, not feel like they have to put on a mask. They<br/>
want to make a tangible difference, not just do a bunch of inconsequential<br/>
paper-shuffling. And they want a life outside of work as well.<br/>
<br/>
         Many people believe that the best jobs are invariably white-collar.<br/>
Through my experience I&#39;ve found this not necessarily true. Manual labor for<br/>
me has always been more satisfying and enjoyable than anything I&#39;ve done in<br/>
the white-collar world. Unfortunately, social conditioning and traditional<br/>
ideas of success made it very difficult for me to break free from the notion<br/>
that I should choose a better career than manual labor. It took me several<br/>
years of outward success yet private frustration in the white-collar world<br/>
to even entertain the idea that I could do manual labor without feeling like<br/>
a &quot;failure&quot; or needing to apologize to people who thought I was loony for<br/>
even considering such things.<br/>
<br/>
        My experience in manual labor has been as the owner of a cleaning<br/>
business. I chose business ownership because when it comes to work, I&#39;m very<br/>
independent and a poor teamplayer. Self-employment is nirvana for me. I<br/>
absolutely love it. This path is not for everybody, however, and I&#39;m certain<br/>
that others not so inclined can find the same degree of satisfaction in<br/>
manual labor as an employee.<br/>
<br/>
        It has been five years since I embarked on my career in manual<br/>
labor. During that time I&#39;ve discovered a few major benefits of manual<br/>
labor. Here they are:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  It&#39;s a good way to continue learning.<br/>
<br/>
        I make a living cleaning carpets. This brings me in contact with a<br/>
wide spectrum of people. For instance, in the past few months I&#39;ve had<br/>
career-related conversations with landlords, doctors, realtors, homemakers,<br/>
school teachers, writers, an interior designer, a drapery manufacturer,<br/>
stockbrokers, a sculptor, an opera singer, an executive recruiter, and a<br/>
professional storyteller.<br/>
<br/>
        Not many careers offer the same degree of exposure to so many<br/>
different people in their homes and the chance to chat with them about their<br/>
career. Any service business which covers the residential market is a gold<br/>
mine for such opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
        When I did the job for the opera singer, he gave me suggestions for<br/>
learning to understand and appreciate opera. Other customers tell me about<br/>
their home projects or hobbies. Each day is packed with learning<br/>
opportunities. About the only boring jobs are those in the &quot;pop-n-fresh&quot;<br/>
suburbs where dual careers and daycare leave the house uninhabited for the<br/>
bulk of the day. Those customers leave me a key and I just take care of the<br/>
job.<br/>
<br/>
        Each night when I record daily service calls in the customer<br/>
records, I include interesting tidbits such as &quot;she is a piano teacher&quot; or<br/>
&quot;they are from India.&quot; These entries are a permanent record of my business<br/>
adventures. I&#39;ve threatened more than once to someday write Memoirs of a<br/>
Carpet Cleaner.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.  You get a lot of physical exercise.<br/>
<br/>
        If you do manual labor for a living, you generally don&#39;t need to<br/>
spend money on fitness clubs, exercise equipment, or diet plans. The daily<br/>
exertion and sweat go a long way in maintaining physical health. Also, many<br/>
manual laborers work outdoors and therefore take in the benefits of fresh<br/>
air and sunshine. Jobs requiring physical output contribute to hearty<br/>
appetites, restful nights, and overall well-being. Manual laborers who burn<br/>
thousands of calories a day, can also find it easy to control their weight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.  You produce tangible results which people sincerely appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
        When I compare job satisfaction as a military officer with the<br/>
satisfaction of cleaning soiled carpets, the military career pales. Yes,<br/>
there was pride in being an officer, but because very little of what I did<br/>
was tangible, I often wondered whether I was making a difference. The senior<br/>
officers told us our job was to be a spokesperson, but that always seemed<br/>
too passive and indirect to me. When I was on leave, the unit carried on<br/>
quite well; arguably even better than when I was there. I had to keep<br/>
reassuring myself that I was doing something useful even though my<br/>
conscience suspected the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
        The usefulness of carpet cleaning, on the other hand, speaks for<br/>
itself. When I&#39;m not there, the work doesn&#39;t get done. Praise from customers<br/>
is honest and sincere. When a soiled carpet comes clean, it makes everyone<br/>
happy. If the customer is satisfied with my work, I get paid. If not, I<br/>
don&#39;t make a cent. Maybe I&#39;m just a simpleton, but that&#39;s the way I like<br/>
things: simple and straight-forward. That&#39;s manual labor in a nutshell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4.  You&#39;re emancipated from the &quot;job world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
        Imagine if you can a working life free from the torture of boring<br/>
meetings, clueless managers, trendy mission statements, and threatening<br/>
annual performance reviews. Such a dream is reality for the self-employed<br/>
manual laborer. As far as I can tell, it is one of the few ways to escape<br/>
all of those insults to your intelligence and still make a decent living.<br/>
<br/>
        It often seems that the job market rewards those who most<br/>
successfully suppress their true personalities and recast themselves as<br/>
one-dimensional gung-ho teamplayers. In more than a few workplaces, people<br/>
are pressured to publicly spout the &quot;party line&quot; even though privately they<br/>
may think otherwise. They are also compelled to squelch non-mainstream<br/>
interests and ideas. Frequently, those who successfully jump through these<br/>
hoops are &quot;rewarded&quot; with the &quot;good jobs&quot; and promotions.<br/>
<br/>
        The self-employed manual laborer is largely exempt from those rules.<br/>
While image plays a role in their success, it is far less important than the<br/>
quality of their tangible work. White-collar workers often don&#39;t have<br/>
tangible results, and therefore must sometimes resort to &quot;impression<br/>
management&quot; as the way to showcase their value to the organization. In other<br/>
words, they must pay attention to things like wardrobe, quality of their<br/>
handshake, smile, haircut, and concocting daily evidence of their<br/>
teamplaying attitude.<br/>
<br/>
         Hence, in terms of having to &quot;play ball&quot; i.e. create a &quot;winning&quot;<br/>
image to get ahead, manual laborers get off lightly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5.  You have true job security.<br/>
<br/>
        When you have several hundred happy customers who call you back year<br/>
after year to do their cleaning, repairs, etc., and those people also tell<br/>
their friends about your service, you enjoy the ultimate in job security.<br/>
About the only thing that will get you &quot;fired&quot; is if you allow your<br/>
standards to slip.<br/>
<br/>
        Such businesses usually do well regardless of the economy. In good<br/>
times, customers call because they want to keep their homes tidy and in good<br/>
repair. In bad times they call because they don&#39;t have the money to replace<br/>
their investments, so they want to maintain them. Carpets become soiled,<br/>
toilets clog up, paint chips and peels, and cars break down regardless of<br/>
whether the economy is up or down.<br/>
<br/>
        There is nothing like having your own business in which you are<br/>
daily complimented by the simple fact that the phone continues ringing with<br/>
previous customers who want your service again and again. That&#39;s what I call<br/>
job security.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some excellent manual labor businesses.<br/>
<br/>
        What are some of the best manual labor businesses in terms of the<br/>
advantages outlined above?<br/>
<br/>
         There are thousands of options, but my personal preference is for<br/>
service businesses which primarily repair, restore, clean, and maintain. A<br/>
few sure bets include: cleaning (carpets, windows, furniture, etc.),<br/>
gardening and lawn mowing, auto repair, house painting, plumbing, and<br/>
handyman services.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How does a person get into manual labor?<br/>
<br/>
        The beauty of it is that the world isn&#39;t stampeding toward manual<br/>
labor careers. If you want to do manual labor and don&#39;t care about status or<br/>
what anybody thinks of your career choice, you should have no problem<br/>
finding work.<br/>
<br/>
        Sometimes though it isn&#39;t clear how a college graduate gets into a<br/>
manual labor business. The path to a corporate career is well laid out in<br/>
books, courses, and by college placement offices, but how to become a<br/>
successful self-employed laborer is less documented.<br/>
<br/>
        While in college you might take a part-time job in manual labor.<br/>
There are always plenty of jobs mowing lawns, cleaning buildings, or<br/>
painting houses. After getting some experience as an employee, you may be<br/>
ready to run your own business. Many self-employed janitors, carpenters,<br/>
plumbers, and electricians got their start as employees during college.<br/>
<br/>
        To make the transition from employee to self-employed, sometimes you<br/>
can purchase the company you work for. If the owner is nearing retirement or<br/>
has other interests, this can be a good option. Once you&#39;ve proven your<br/>
knowledge of the trade and ability to work hard, treat customers right, and<br/>
run an organized operation, you usually won&#39;t have trouble convincing an<br/>
owner to sell the business on a contract. What this means is that after a<br/>
down payment (sometimes that isn&#39;t even necessary) the owner will finance<br/>
the rest.<br/>
<br/>
        Some claim that all you need is a dream, and a positive mental<br/>
attitude to succeed in business. Those notions can be misleading. I don&#39;t<br/>
know anyone who has successfully run a service business for more than a few<br/>
years who would say such things. From my experience, the service businesses<br/>
which supposedly &quot;succeed&quot; overnight often bend ethics in the process.<br/>
<br/>
        Enthusiasm is important to business success, but far more useful are<br/>
qualities like hard work, financial discipline and patience. A successful<br/>
business with many repeat customers is built one job at a time over a period<br/>
of years. Many intelligent and hard-working people report that it usually<br/>
takes three years or more before you can harvest repeat and referral<br/>
customers, and that is if you run a high quality business. There are no<br/>
shortcuts to true business success.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Answers to common objections.<br/>
<br/>
        Over and over again, I hear objections from people about why they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do manual labor. Here are responses to three of the most common<br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  What if I get hurt or I can&#39;t do physical labor as I get older?<br/>
<br/>
        These are valid concerns. There are many ways to deal with them.<br/>
<br/>
        To avoid financial difficulty due to injury, you might build a<br/>
business which includes several employees. This would reduce your<br/>
involvement in the physical work. However, this option carries the<br/>
considerable burden of the employer role. Some employers find that their<br/>
health (mental if nothing else) suffers far more than if they just did all<br/>
of the work themselves. It all depends on the individual. For some the<br/>
employer role is a panacea, for others a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
        Another strategy is to develop secondary or passive income sources.<br/>
Income from real estate, securities, or part-time businesses could fit this<br/>
description. For instance, for the past few years I&#39;ve had a part-time<br/>
tutoring business. This provides a modest supplemental income, and a way for<br/>
me to teach young people without having to be a full-time teacher. In the<br/>
future I may choose to increase the amount of tutoring I do. Should an<br/>
accident force me out of carpet cleaning, I would hopefully have enough of a<br/>
tutoring business established that I could rely on it as a primary income.<br/>
<br/>
        Some people don&#39;t fret too much over the danger of an accident or<br/>
physical disability. Over and over again I hear of people who live into<br/>
their nineties and beyond who credit a lifetime of physical labor as a major<br/>
factor in their longevity. I like to think that the majority of those who<br/>
take the necessary precautions, work carefully and methodically, and<br/>
practice healthy living habits, should be able to perform physical labor<br/>
well beyond the traditional retirement age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.  How can I ever take time off?<br/>
<br/>
        This one is a cinch to answer. People who say they can never get<br/>
away from their business, are usually those who haven&#39;t taken the necessary<br/>
steps to keep the business from controlling their life.<br/>
<br/>
        People who are strapped to their business with no time or money to<br/>
get away, often could buy their freedom by cutting overhead, and regularly<br/>
saving money to cover expenses during the slow season. It usually comes down<br/>
to having the discipline to avoid the frills which only increase overhead,<br/>
without a corresponding increase in the quality of service to the customer.<br/>
<br/>
        Occasionally to meet customer demand, the self-employed have no<br/>
choice but to put in long hours for several weeks or months at a time. The<br/>
reward, however, can be weeks or months of time off. The important point to<br/>
remember is that when it&#39;s slow season, don&#39;t sit around waiting for the<br/>
phone to ring. That is the time to take a vacation or pursue a hobby.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.  But I won&#39;t be able to &quot;use my degree.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
        Manual labor may not be the most obvious way to &quot;use your degree,&quot;<br/>
but it is certainly an excellent way to use your brain.<br/>
<br/>
        You&#39;ll discover that manual labor provides a wealth of ways to use<br/>
your brain, ingenuity, creativity, what have you. As an entrepreneur, you<br/>
get to wear many hats: production, marketing, public relations, accountant,<br/>
repairperson, purchaser, janitor, etc. With such a range of tasks, it&#39;s hard<br/>
to get bored, and even possible to get smarter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion<br/>
<br/>
        Clearly, manual labor is not beneath the &quot;dignity&quot; of a college<br/>
graduate. Those who think that such work is only for the uneducated<br/>
underachievers, are either misguided or just plain ignorant.<br/>
<br/>
        College graduates who are so inclined should consider a career in<br/>
manual labor. Just because they earned a degree, doesn&#39;t mean they have to<br/>
take the white-collar path. Some of them may discover a lifetime of job<br/>
satisfaction and opportunity in manual labor.<br/>
From such a discovery, a person would be foolish to turn away.<br/>
