someone mentioned that a mother couldn&#39;t legally do something because she<br/>
wasn&#39;t the biological mother.  If someone is the legal mother regardless of<br/>
blood or biology, she has the same rights as any other mother.  Perhaps you<br/>
are speaking of someone being a guardian or a foster mother which would be<br/>
different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277874042">I believe the issue is step mothers when birth mother and father share<br/>
custodial duties.  If birth mom says no, then step mom can&#39;t countermand<br/>
that.<br/>

If my stepmom had wanted something my mom didn&#39;t, she&#39;d have had to convince<br/>
Dad.<br/>
