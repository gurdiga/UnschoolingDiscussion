<br/>
We are thin, we are fat, we are curved, we are straight.  We come in all <br/>
colors, all shapes and all sizes.  We believe that One Size Fits No one.<br/>
<br/>
We are married and single, separated, blended.  We belong to small <br/>
families, large families, extended families.  We live in the country, in <br/>
the city, on farms, in suburbs, in apartments.  Wherever we live, small <br/>
people are there.<br/>
<br/>
We are Christian, we are Pagan, we are Moslem, we are Atheist.  We have <br/>
found the answers, we have found part of the answers, we are searching for <br/>
the answers.  And some of us have not yet figured out the questions.<br/>
<br/>
We are college graduates, we are dropouts.  We are doctors, lawyers, <br/>
mechanics and laborers.  We are capable.  We are Professional Educational <br/>
Facilitators.  We are THE experts for the small people in our family.<br/>
<br/>
We are liberal or conservative or walk a road in between.  We are <br/>
Republicans and Democrats...or not...and libertarians to greater or lesser <br/>
extent.  Some of us don&#39;t vote at all, and some of us feel by virtue of our <br/>
increased awareness, we should be allowed to vote more than once!<br/>
<br/>
We do not like government control of our lives.  Some of us Do Not Like It <br/>
and some of us DO NOT LIKE IT.  Some of us do not believe that any entity <br/>
should have that much power.  Others believe only their Favorite Flavor <br/>
should have that kind of power.<br/>
<br/>
We have rejected the public school system for religious reasons or <br/>
political reasons, or because our standards were higher, or because we <br/>
value creativity, or because we were round pegs hammered into square <br/>
holes.  Some of us rejected public school knowing we could do better, and <br/>
some of us knew only that we could do no worse.<br/>
<br/>
We have school at home, we deschool, we unschool.  Some of us are <br/>
passionately convinced that our method is not only the best but the only <br/>
feasible method.  Some of us change our methods weekly.<br/>
<br/>
We are nervous, we are confused, we are confident, we are assured.  We read <br/>
and read and read until one day, lo and behold, we are able to write the <br/>
books we have been reading.  We stop clinging so fiercely to those who have <br/>
taught and supported us, and offer ourselves to those who are now turning <br/>
to us, with a brief passing interval during which we ask ourselves the <br/>
question &quot;Why are they asking ME?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have been taught that &quot;United we stand, divided we fall&quot;, and we have <br/>
learned that Diverse does not have to equal Divided.  We have a foundation, <br/>
and that foundation must run the length and breadth.  We must all make a <br/>
conscious choice to stand upon it.<br/>
<br/>
For whatever our size, our flavor, our method, our value system, we believe <br/>
that parents have the right to raise their children, and that right <br/>
includes each and every educational decision.  If we attempt to use any <br/>
other tenet as our foundation, we will fall.<br/>
<br/>
If we will not waver in that belief, if we will not dilute it with <br/>
questions about the ability of people with orange-and-purple hair, or <br/>
people who don&#39;t clean house to our standards, or people with no education, <br/>
or people who do not share our religious or political beliefs, or our <br/>
cultural values, or people who use other methods, then we will <br/>
stand...diverse, but united.<br/>
