<div id="ygrps-yiv-708387997">In my relentless pursuant of finding books on unschooling that were <br/>
written in Russian or translated from English to Russian, I found the <br/>
following quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;... People with great passions, people who accomplish great deeds, <br/>
people who possess strong feelings, even people with great minds and a <br/>
strong personality, rarely come out of good little boys and girls.&quot;  <br/>
Lev Vygotsky<br/>
<br/>
I thought you might enjoy the quote as much as I did ....<br/>
<br/>
Warmest Regards,<br/>
