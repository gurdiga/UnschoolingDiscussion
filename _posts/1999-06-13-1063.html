<div id="ygrps-yiv-121793334">I&#39;m excited to see the volume of mail from people serious about<br/>
unschooling, and think that people can find a lot of support<br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding the volume a bit much right now, though, and was<br/>
thinking of unsubbing anyway, but what helped me decide was<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s statement that people have the opportunity to learn<br/>
about unschooling on this list from &quot;famous unschoolers&quot;.  While<br/>
this is true and will probably be an opportunity relished by<br/>
most, I found that this statement summed up what has been<br/>
bothering me about this list, but which I couldn&#39;t quite put my<br/>
finger on.  <br/>
<br/>
I happen to agree with everything Sandra, Helen and other more<br/>
high profile unschoolers have to say about unschooling and<br/>
appreciate that they are willing to share their experience, but<br/>
have learned most from watching my kids learn and learned a<br/>
tremendous amount from having my ideas challenged and by<br/>
discussing unschooling over the years with folks quite new to the<br/>
concept as well as with those who have blazed the trail before<br/>
us.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel strongly that everyone on this list could contribute<br/>
valuable insight and experience and learn together, but<br/>
statements like the one above come across to me as just a tad<br/>
patronizing.  Our family unschools because we don&#39;t think we need<br/>
&quot;experts&quot; or &quot;teachers&quot; or &quot;famous unschoolers&quot; to learn from. We<br/>
just need to be awake and alive with open minds and trust in our<br/>
kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Adieu....<br/>

Didn&#39;t mean to irritate anyone, truly.  I&#39;ve just never seen so many authors <br/>
in one place (not me--people who wrote BOOKS and stuff) for an unschooling <br/>
discussion outside a conference, and so for people to be arguing that we <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be limiting the discussion to unschooling while I was getting side <br/>
mail from people saying if it didn&#39;t clear up they were going to leave <br/>
prompted that statement.<br/>
<br/>
If people who aren&#39;t even unschoolers are given as much weight as those who <br/>
have grown unschooled kids (not me, my oldest is twelve) the list won&#39;t be as <br/>

Some people aren&#39;t ready to just listen to their kids and trust unschooling, <br/>

posting here since I just started in Feb I do feel I am an unschooler, but<br/>
all of us who have pulled our children out of public schools instead of<br/>

others for love and support whatever our thought for the day!<br/>

 those of us just begining look to those who have been there done that  to<br/>
show us that it isn&#39;t hard and the sorts of things they do ,<br/>
 and we look to those who are also begining  to not feel so alone in just<br/>
starting and all of the terrifying experiences that we have expecially with<br/>
family and friends!<br/>
if these people are so &quot;famous&quot; then why would they come to get support from<br/>
those of us who are just starting, are they just here to &quot;tell &quot; us how to<br/>
do it their way? or perhaps they would prefer that this list be limited to<br/>
those with the &quot;famous&quot; status?<br/>
I don&#39;t feel here is a place to put anyone up on a pedistal and downplay<br/>
anyones imput no matter how long they have been at it!  and I do find it a<br/>
bit annoying that you have to have a phd to understand half of the language<br/>
being used here.  that may sound laim, but it seems to me like some are<br/>
trying their best to sound overly intilectual  to get their points accross,<br/>
and to some of us  it is read as garbally goop if I cannot understand what<br/>
you are trying to say to me how am I supposed to apply it to my life?<br/>
It was also mentioned that giving details to a question would be annoying to<br/>
others,  I think it would be very helpful, sometimes I don&#39;t have time or<br/>
the right question in mind to be able to get more details for a question<br/>
that somebody else asked, and would have liked the details to be laid out<br/>
the first time.<br/>

I just had to comment here...I have been lurking for a few days and very much <br/>
enjoyed the posts (debates and all). Our family is in a deschooling process. <br/>
Our son went to 3 months of kindergarten (sent out of our perceived pressure <br/>
from family and friends ...ARGH) but we pulled him out because the school was <br/>
simply destroying his creativity and spirit. We know we are unschoolers in <br/>
our hearts but its been difficult to make that leap of faith into &quot;pure&quot; <br/>
unschooling. We never considered using a curriculum but we struggled with <br/>
scheduled days and required activities. (I have a file of lesson plans and <br/>
record keeping spreadsheets that shows our evolution....I am down to just <br/>
using a journal and saving things our son creates)  I guess the fears were <br/>
remnants of the kind of schooling my husband and I grew up with. My hope is <br/>
this list will provide some insight from veteran unschooling families and <br/>
support from families who are meeting similar challenges. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892834503">no offense meant Helen. You are an experienced homeschooler but i dont know<br/>
if you are famous or not. Personally I dont think I care. I am not into<br/>
names or labels. I appreciate what ohers have to share or give. I dot think<br/>
of any of us as experts except for ourselves and our own kids.<br/>
<br/>
I also did not take sandras post as offensive. I may not agree on<br/>
somethings but she as much right to her view as i do. ALso I tend to over<br/>
look things that are into in your face meaness cus i figure people cant<br/>
tell what i mean cus they cant see me and know my intention. that is the<br/>
problme with email.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is so important to share the info we have. our knowledge and our<br/>
experience. while I do not have much hsing experience , I am still a<br/>
vibrant member of this community and can still give imput and advice. it is<br/>
up to the rest of you to decide what to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
I think so many of us are used to being defensive. after all we are<br/>
different and sometimes persecuted for our beliefs and actions that we tend<br/>
to just assume people are doing this.<br/>
<br/>
I relaly hope that people dont feel they haveto temper what they say. I<br/>
take what is said as face value and not personally against me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869587412">I haven&#39;t been posting much on this list, but I&#39;ve been reading right<br/>
along, and I&#39;ve saved a few posts I thought I&#39;d like to reply to this<br/>
morning while I have some time. Sandy Keane&#39;s (below) is among them.<br/>
Sandy&#39;s the one who left the list because of Sandra Dodd&#39;s statement that<br/>
people have the opportunity to learn about unschooling on this list from<br/>
&quot;famous unschoolers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It got me to thinking about this fame stuff, what constitutes fame, when it<br/>
might be deserved, and when it&#39;s more or less &quot;bestowed&quot; on one by virtue<br/>
of what one does for a living or maintains an interest and an involvment in<br/>
or whatever. I think that&#39;s the case with Mark and I. Any &quot;fame&quot; we have is<br/>
simply because we chose to support our family by publishing a magazine, the<br/>
magazine has been wildly successful, and therefore, we&#39;re &quot;famous.&quot; Yes,<br/>
it&#39;s more complex than that - we&#39;ve also been pretty active in<br/>
homeschooling politics over the years, we published some books on<br/>
homeschooling, we founded one national organization and helped found<br/>
another and are currently involved with creating a third... but does this<br/>
make us &quot;famous?&quot; Not in my book. Fame - real fame - seems like something<br/>
different, something rarefied, something... I dunno. Maybe I just don&#39;t<br/>
&quot;feel&quot; famous. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I read Sandra&#39;s words I didn&#39;t read &quot;famous homeschoolers&quot; the same<br/>
way Sandy seemed to. I just took it as Sandra&#39;s shorthand for &quot;those who&#39;ve<br/>
had some experience with these things&quot; or &quot;those who&#39;ve been around the<br/>
block a time or two&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
Still thinking on this,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well... as one of those with grown unschooled kids (four over 18, two<br/>
married and raising families, all totally, radically, absolutely<br/>
no-curriculum-ever unschooled), I have to disagree with Sandra here.<br/>
<br/>
I think the only way to have a powerful list is to begin with the<br/>
assumption that everyone who wants to join the conversation is given just<br/>
as much weight as everyone else. Some people will have more experience in<br/>
some specific areas like unschooling, but others might have more experience<br/>
in other areas which may not necessarily be labeled or recognized as<br/>
unschooling, but which might have great bearing on the issues involved<br/>
(respecting children, finding resources, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I might have experience, but it&#39;s only with unschooling my own kids. I&#39;ll<br/>
be happy to relate what&#39;s worked for us, but only with the understanding<br/>
that I&#39;m drawing from 40+ years of developing understandings, nurturing<br/>
relationships, and experiencing an amazing series of events in my life. I<br/>
reached the point where I could trust my children&#39;s learning by being<br/>
trusted by my parents to be responsible for my own learning. I knew<br/>
unschooling worked because I was unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
And now the kids and the grandkids are up and I need to get off this<br/>
computer for the day. I&#39;ll try to respond to more posts when I can.<br/>

homeschooling and how these people have so positively contributed to the<br/>
freedom of homeschooling that we enjoy nation-wide.  <br/>
They aren&#39;t the &quot;founders of homeschooling&quot; but their voices are widely<br/>

there is a larger society out beyond my unschooling household, then I am<br/>

Maybe what I see, is people that look and act like real people.  But, in <br/>

there was the *fame* of being a publisher.  But, now after a few years of <br/>

Carol, you are right about respecting experience, but that is not what we are <br/>
having a problem with.  It is real nice that these experienced people are on <br/>
the list, and of course we can benefit from their knowledge.  However, no one <br/>
is going to listen to a word that someone says when they are putting <br/>
themselves above others.  If we didn&#39;t want to move into unschooling, we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be here.  Now, if this list is ONLY for experienced unschoolers, and <br/>
people who are struggling to get there are not wanted, then fine, those of us <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be here and should let them have it.  I don&#39;t think  this is so, <br/>
not from the reply&#39;s to posts that I have seen from others.  We just want to <br/>
have help and reassurance for what we are attempting, not be put down when we <br/>
ask something and not made to feel bad or that we have asked a stupid <br/>
question.  Maybe this all is a BIG lesson to us on how NOT to treat your <br/>
children when you are unschooling your kids.   I have learned a great deal so <br/>

answers that people like Lois, and Linda have given, I hope that keeps up and <br/>

&lt;&lt;We just want to <br/>
have help and reassurance for what we are attempting, not be put down when we <br/>
ask something and not made to feel bad or that we have asked a stupid <br/>
question.  Maybe this all is a BIG lesson to us on how NOT to treat your <br/>
children when you are unschooling your kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that Sandra has apoligized for any hard feelings she may have <br/>
inadvertantly caused, and that we ought to let this go and get on with <br/>
discussing the subject at hand.  There is that classic problem of only seeing <br/>
the words on the screen and not facial expressions, and changes in tone of <br/>
voice and body language.  I think one of the best things we can remember to <br/>
do here in to give the benefit of the doubt to the person who is speaking.  <br/>
Maybe she should have put the word experts in quotation marks, to indicate a <br/>
sense of irony, maybe not.  In any case, I have had the joy, benefit, <br/>
blessing, whatever you want to call it, of seeing Sandra in person, of <br/>
hearing her speak at conferences, of sitting around on floors with her.  She <br/>
has many good things to share with us if we will only listen.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this list does not fall apart over this issue.  I hope Sandra feels <br/>
free to continue posting.  I hope others do as well.  Sometimes its a good <br/>
thing for someone to remind us which road we are on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047960029">The first two days that I was on this list, I was excited and happy.<br/>
After that, I too had some kind of not so right feeling that I couldn&#39;t<br/>
put my finger on.<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t take offense to having seasoned unschoolers here or<br/>
&quot;experts.&quot; I also don&#39;t take offense to newbies or those full of doubt<br/>
and looking for support or encouragement. We&#39;re all just people and<br/>
supposed to be here for one another. <br/>
<br/>
What I do find uncomfrotable, and have just realized, is the underlying<br/>
tone of things being right and wrong. Of terms being picked apart and<br/>
corrected. Of having to choose words too carefully. Reminders of what<br/>
subjects should be and what should not be. Of when to move on or not. <br/>
I haven&#39;t seen anyone curse or call someone names. I haven&#39;t seen anyone<br/>
ramble on about their health or the weather. I haven&#39;t seen anyone post<br/>
for days about something that has been long forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
What I feel lies in the air here....... is the smell of school. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary in FL, I was just thinking the same thing today, like I could just<br/>
imagine a teacher picking out only the kids that are smart to answer the<br/>
questions, or the not so quardinated kids being picked last to play ball,<br/>
rather than being given equal opportunity to grow, they are pushed aside ,<br/>
or like the &quot;gifted class being created for the smart kids&quot;  if everyone<br/>
isn&#39;t treated with some sort of equality, and given a chance to succeed than<br/>
how can one succeed? isn&#39;t this the whole reason we are all unschooling? to<br/>
get away from all of that?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see it more like a class where the gifted kids AREN&#39;T separated from the<br/>
regular and uncoordinated kids--so that the regular and uncoordinated kids<br/>
have a chance to do some gifted work.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone was trying to separate the smart/not smart. Instead, I<br/>
think people were interested in keeping the topics meaty, so that there<br/>
would be lots for everyone to talk about--even those gifted, or rather &quot;more<br/>
experienced&quot; kids.<br/>
<br/>
In my recollection, I think that the difference between many of the gifted<br/>
kids (in my school anyway-and I was good friends with many of them)- was<br/>
exposure.  It wasn&#39;t a matter of anyone being better than anyone else. Ever.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I don&#39;t think it was about separating people, so much as about<br/>
separating UNschooling from regular homeschooling.<br/>

to make potentially &quot;charged&quot; comments that I think may be taken stronger<br/>

of language, punctuation and disclaimers and/or emoticons.  Also I remind<br/>
myself while reading my mail that there are a lot of smart-asses on this<br/>
list, and it is probably most accurate to assume sarcasm when in doubt.  ;-)<br/>
