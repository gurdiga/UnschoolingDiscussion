<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048296475">I just wanted to say thank you for posting this!  It may seem like a small<br/>
thing but I think you just helped my son and I tremedously!  He went to<br/>
kindergarten this year and was told the same thing, he was not holding his<br/>
pencil correctly.  He has bad muscle control in his fingers.  He also does<br/>
not enjoy writing at all because it hurts his hands, he&#39;s very sensitive<br/>
child anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
I just told him the story of your children and told him, it was alright with<br/>
me if he held his pencil anyway he wanted to it didn&#39;t matter as long as it<br/>
was comfortable.  He looked at me and said really?  Sweet child.  He picked<br/>
his pencil up in a fist and wrote his name and it&#39;s the clearest I&#39;ve seen<br/>
his handwriting in a long time.  I think you just helped us avoid a long<br/>
struggle with handwriting, who knew that one little thing like telling a<br/>
child he&#39;s holding his pencil wrong could have such an effect!<br/>

&gt; Hi.In Kindergarten  one of the girls was singled out right from day one as<br/>
&gt; needing correction on how she held her pencil. Admittedly in a very strange<br/>
&gt; way. Her  teacher gave her a rubber traingle shaped thingy to put on her<br/>
&gt; pencil. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942682179">My kids were &quot;liberated&quot; when they were at the end of 6th and 2nd <br/>
grades  My daughter (the 2nd grader) was the one who was forever getting <br/>
told that she was holding her pencil the wrong way.  She is now almost 12 ( <br/>
21st July).  She is still very insecure about the issue and about her <br/>
writing.  My son, the former sixth grader, still occasionally rants at her <br/>
about it, and about how she holds her silverware!  Both kids may never <br/>
completely recover from &quot;school.&quot;  I&#39;m so glad to hear that you have been <br/>
able to stop this from happening to your son now.  Indeed, who knew?<br/>
