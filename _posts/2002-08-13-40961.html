<div id="ygrps-yiv-213241359"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi Ned:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your points are solid, clear minded, and ring true: others perception of <br/>
them sucks,<br/>
sounds egotistical, and guides people to think you are near sighted.   If<br/>
you think this to be a punch it is ment to be constructive.   Leaving out<br/>
personal pronouns (I, Me, My) will get rid of the perceived egotistical <br/>
nature<br/>
of your comments.   The other two are more difficult and would best be <br/>
delivered<br/>
in metaphore.   The problem that exists with all the American Zombies not<br/>
realizing that a police state is decending upon them is fear of change.  <br/>
The very thing that school has so well implanted. The other thing is <br/>
that nobody<br/>
here has experienced a police state. So the look and feel is not known. <br/>
 When Capt.<br/>
Cook sailed into Hawaiian Harbors none of the natives ever seen him <br/>
until the smaller<br/>
boats were launched.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People are made of a small conscious mind with very limited uses and largely<br/>
emotionless, the subconscious is as opposed to the conscious a behemoth <br/>
emotional<br/>
monster with capabilities unknown and vast.   Subconscious processes are<br/>
where somebody with a message should speak.  This is why people like <br/>
Mohammad,<br/>
..., went through such hell prior to their messages being joined, they had<br/>
to figure out why they were ridiculed.   Subconscious is all emotion, <br/>
memory,<br/>
and process, conscious is a gatekeeper to keep crap out of the subconscious<br/>
but it is very easily fouled and to keep pee brain (conscious) from <br/>
overload.  <br/>
Hypnosis is the bypass of a part of the brain referred to as the hypocampus<br/>
or if you will a doorway that bypasses the gatekeeper.   The hypocampus <br/>
differentiates<br/>
between what is real and what is imagined.   Metaphore bypasses too but the<br/>
metaphore must adhere to a certain structure.  This structure is known as<br/>
&quot;the rules of mind&quot; This would be fun to study if your goal is to influence<br/>
the thoughts in others.   Also in NLP (Neural Linguistic Programming) how<br/>
to anchor would be a great benefit as it relates to how to attract and repel<br/>
at choice or associate internal thoughts with attractive and repulsive <br/>
emotions.  <br/>
A ripe source for these but probably too advanced is Frogs to Princes  by<br/>
Richard Bandler.   If you think this is horse shit then perhaps you should<br/>
check out the resolution of a murder case where Richard Bandler acted as<br/>
his own attorney.   It is a great deal of fun to see somebody tell the jury<br/>
that they committed the murder and see the verdict as not guilty.   Bandler<br/>
is also not a very nice person in that he had often called the judge and<br/>
jury &quot;fuck ups&quot; durring the trial and was never heard by either, but the<br/>
stenographer captured it.  Also your use of what are called predicates is<br/>
nonexistant.   If you will, let a sentence be constructed that describes<br/>
a car it will appeal to different people if it appeals to different <br/>
senses.  <br/>
That is just as people tend to be different handed they also tend to use<br/>
on one sense more than another.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To appeal to visual people it would suffice to say:  The yellow Volks <br/>
Wagon made a shinning entrance.<br/>
<br/>
 To appeal to a auditory person:  The yellow Volks Wagon rang my bell.<br/>
<br/>
To appeal to a kinesthetic you would say:   The yellow Volks Wagon had <br/>
hands on appeal.<br/>
<br/>
 To appeal to all groups noted:   The yellow VW made a shinning entrance <br/>
that rang my bell with its hands on appeal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An easier reference would be monsters and magical sticks.<br/>
