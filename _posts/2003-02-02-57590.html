voice that says I&#39;m not keeping the house as clean as my mother did.  She <br/>
said, &#39;We probably don&#39;t remember what the house looked like when we were <br/>
three or six or nine.  Our memories are probably from when we were older and <br/>
didn&#39;t play with Hot Wheels and Legos and mud anymore.  And we were away at <br/>
school all day and my mom was home cleaning...  And I think of those sad <br/>
poems about old ladies with no one to get their house messy.<br/>
