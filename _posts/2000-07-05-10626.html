regular 90+  mile round trip pilgrimages to the British Food Shop to buy the <br/>
gargantuan jars. <br/>

Biscuits are at the top of my Food-most-missed list. You can get Peek Frean&#39;s <br/>
shortcake in Safeway now, but oh for a real ginger biscuit!  I was ecstatic <br/>
when a local shop recently started selling British foodstuffs. It&#39;s an <br/>
antique shop, but fortunately the biscuits aren&#39;t...........<br/>
