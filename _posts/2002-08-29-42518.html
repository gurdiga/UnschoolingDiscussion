<br/>
I understood your point, but I&#39;ve heard it my whole life and the concern <br/>
truly seems unfounded.  I&#39;ve heard horror stories of children who never saw a <br/>
real gun, never had toy guns, went to another home, found a gun and pulled <br/>
the trigger.<br/>
<br/>
I think too FEW guns and a strong desire and fascination could be worse than <br/>
a desire and a ban and shame and forbidding environment.<br/>
<br/>
Others have said and I fully agree that you cannot lift up a real gun and <br/>
believe it&#39;s a toy gun.  And I&#39;ve never seen a toy gun that looked real.  Not <br/>
to say there aren&#39;t any, but they must be hard to come by because I&#39;ve never <br/>
seen one at all.  <br/>
<br/>
My point is children aren&#39;t stupid and CAN tell toys from real things, <br/>
whether it&#39;s food or dolls or guns.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think I would wish to count on a young child registering the<br/>
difference in weight between a toy and the real thing or that he/she would<br/>
assume that just because it was heavy that it shouldn&#39;t be played with.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The point of Sleeping Beauty is you can try to destroy every spindle in the <br/>
kingdom, but it&#39;s not goin to work.  It only takes one.<br/>
<br/>
So as there are guns in the world, kids who have played with toys will know <br/>
more about the difference between real and toy than those who have never <br/>
touched real OR toy.<br/>
<br/>
NOTHING will keep children safe from coming upon a real gun except the <br/>
personal attention of other human beings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A young child unsupervised in a house with real guns accessible is going to<br/>
be in danger no matter whether he&#39;s accustomed to playing with guns or he&#39;s<br/>
been told under no circumstances to THINK about touching anything gun-like.<br/>
<br/>
There was an interesting special on Dateline or some such show about<br/>
children put into a room full of toys, and amongst those toys was a real<br/>
(unloaded of course) gun. The children had been told by their parents (and<br/>
sometimes by the people running the study) that they were never to touch<br/>
guns. Some of the girls and maybe one or two of the boys did not touch it.<br/>
Most of the boys and many of the girls gleefully picked it up and started<br/>
&quot;shooting&quot; each other with it.<br/>
<br/>
A child who plays with toy guns is not inherently in more danger than a<br/>
child who has been told all guns are evil, when put into an unsafe situation<br/>
as you are describing.<br/>

aren&#39;t taught more about that.  So far this year, there have been, I believe, <br/>
13 children killed by guns.  A lot of those were from children just &quot;playing&quot; <br/>
with them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294736934">&quot;None of them look like real things. In fact, it seems the toy<br/>
companies go to measures to make sure they don&#39;t look real. All the <br/>
guns I&#39;ve seen are in colors or have big orange tips on the end.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They do now.  I recall a story in the papers several years ago about <br/>
a child who was shot by a policeman because he was pointing a black <br/>
gun at him (the child at the cop).  It turned out to be a toy, but <br/>
looked realistic enough at a distance to make the cop think it was <br/>
real.  After that is when the toy companies were pressured (there may <br/>
have been laws passed about it as well, if I remember correctly) to <br/>
make their toy guns look anything but realistic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073185269">Yes, we do have one of those.  I bought it for him a few weeks ago.  It makes the  loudest clicking sound that makes my skin crawl.  It has disappeared and I just don&#39;t know where it is...  bottom of the toy box I think.  The last straw was when he clicked it right in my ear and I spilled spaghetti sauce all over the floor.  It was fun for a while.  But, the sound was really annoying.  He had fun experimenting with what else could shoot out.  If you don&#39;t mind the sound, they are fun.<br/>

  I recently saw some toy guns at the dollar store that shoot ping pong balls.<br/>
  They looked really cool, but I wondered if they worked very well.  Does<br/>
  anyone have any experience with those? <br/>

i&#39;m glad to have read all of this talk about guns as i&#39;ve always very<br/>
much struggled with the idea that guns shouldn&#39;t be toys in a peaceful<br/>
world.  my boy&#39;s always found things that he pretends are guns anyhow and<br/>
is not overly aggressive or even very stereotypically *boyish*.  it&#39;s<br/>
nice to have heard everyone reasoning and know i can relax a bit and not<br/>
worry that it&#39;s going to escalate into him wanting to actually kill<br/>
people like he plays.  and if he asks for something that i wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
previously have approved of, i can sit back and understand that he still<br/>
is a compassionate and loving boy who can play for play&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the enlightenment!<br/>

Thu, Feb 28, 1991  Kirby was saying when he’s ten he wants a “sidod” or <br/>
something I couldn’t understand, and I kept asking and he kept repeating the same <br/>
thing, and said when we go to Disneyland he wants us to get him a sidod.    He <br/>
said there’s a hole in the middle and you blow into it.  I was asking him <br/>
questions, like was it rubber like a balloon, and he laughed and said no, that it <br/>
was hard and round, and had a hole in the middle.    I asked if they had them <br/>
at Disneyland and he said I think so, and I asked if he’d ever had one and he <br/>
laughed again, and said he’d only seen one on “Pinocchio,” and smoke came <br/>
out of it.  A CIGAR!?  No, a sidog.    I told him I didn’t think they did have <br/>
those at Disneyland.  He said when he眀愀猀 最爀漀眀渀 甀瀀 栀攀 眍娪anted one.  <br/>

Our toddler keeps repeated something that sounds like &quot;Hay-dee&#39;s <br/>

confident that whatever she&#39;s saying applies to the situation at <br/>
hand.  We&#39;ve tried our best to make it into a commentary on the <br/>
neighbors, who have a daughter named Hallie, but it&#39;s usually a <br/>
stretch to make it fit.  An example would be when she&#39;s settling in <br/>
to nurse for the night and looks up into my eyes, saying it so <br/>
sincerely and matter-of-factly to me that I&#39;m sure it must be going <br/>
