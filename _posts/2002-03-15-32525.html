<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738965280">I was raised by a controlling, emotionally and often physically abusive<br/>
mother.  But did she know it?  I don&#39;t think so.  In fact, her older<br/>
sister was severely abusive and made my mom look like a saint.  My Mom&#39;s<br/>
family was Italian and Irish, and yelling and slapping was the norm.  My<br/>
Dad&#39;s family was Mexican and did not yell or slap, but had very violent<br/>
tempers.  Both my parents were physically abused by one of their parents.<br/>
 So, when I got married and got mad and spewed abuse, my husband turned<br/>
around and said, &quot;I&#39;m done.&quot; And went to the other room.  I had to think<br/>
about my actions, and about how am I respecting others when I am angry. <br/>
Then I had kids, and when I was frustrated, the pitch and volume of my<br/>
voice would rise.  My husband would tell me, &quot;You&#39;re yelling.&quot;  I didn&#39;t<br/>
even realize it.  I used to say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m Italian and Mexican and<br/>
Irish.  We have bad tempers.  We yell, but it doesn&#39;t mean anything.&quot;  It<br/>
took years for me to accept that my mother was abusive to me.  I had<br/>
already known that my father was physically abusive to her, which is why<br/>
they&#39;d divorced.  So, I know what you mean about doing things without<br/>
realizing it.  Fortunately, I&#39;ve stopped making excuses for my<br/>
misbehavior.  When I get upset, and my voice starts to become shrill, my<br/>
kids and I have a codeword which means I&#39;m crossing the line into a<br/>
tirade and they want me to stop.  It&#39;s &quot;Peace&quot; accompanied by the peace<br/>
sign.  We talked a lot before deciding on that word.  All the other words<br/>
had negative connotations for me and only fed my anger and frustration. <br/>
I have also found that it is worth the time it takes to go for a cooling<br/>
off walk before trying to communicate when I&#39;m angry.  As time goes on,<br/>
and I learn that it is not about getting control of my kids but about<br/>
listening and having a good relationship with them of respect, it is less<br/>
and less that I need the &quot;Peace&quot; sign.  (My mom has expressed an interest<br/>
in learning new ways of relating with children after hearing about my<br/>
discoveries in this area.  I won&#39;t even let her around my kids now, she&#39;s<br/>
so unstable and abusive to them.)<br/>

it.<br/>
<br/>
And since you were raised in such an atmosphere, I even applaude you more <br/>
for &#39;picking&#39; a mate that didn&#39;t allow the intergenerational dysfunction <br/>
to continue. How is it that you feel you broke that momentum?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172327809">GREAT suggestion - idea Bonnie, about the peace code word. I think I may adopt a similar strategy when I start to rant. Which I feel is toooooo often. Thanks and it is encouraging to hear someone else with a similar &quot;issue&quot; to mine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373335897">Kolleen, I have to admit that I did not pick my husband, God did.  When I<br/>
was thirteen, I prayed and gave my future to God and I listed important<br/>
things, like who I married.  Then I made a deal and said, &quot;You show me<br/>
the right way to go, and I will follow.&quot;  I know that sounds silly, but<br/>
whenever I come to a crossroads in life, I get a message in my heart and<br/>
I know which road to take by it.  <br/>
By the way, I chose a controlling codependent to complement my compliant<br/>
codependency:(  But we are more healthy than our parents and continue to<br/>
improve and change through our life together.  Whenever we disagree or<br/>
fight, I see an image of two rocks rubbing against eachother, making<br/>
sparks fly, but changing the shape of the rocks at the same time.<br/>
Thanks for the applause, though, I enjoyed it until reality set in:)<br/>
