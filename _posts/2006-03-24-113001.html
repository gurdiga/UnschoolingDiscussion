<div id="ygrps-yiv-112801514">Is this the list where we were discussion kids getting along?  If  <br/>
not, I&#39;m starting a new topic. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember how school drove a big wedge between me and my sister.  I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t even allowed to communicate with her at school.  She was in  <br/>
first grade when I was in fourth.  Our recesses and lunches were at  <br/>
different times.  But the teachers and the other kids kept people  <br/>
from mixing with kids much younger or older than they were.<br/>
<br/>
My mom contributed too, by shaming me and &quot;making me&quot; take her places  <br/>
with me or share with her, so that I never wanted to choose to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Our relationship was not good and is still strained because of some  <br/>
of those things.  She&#39;s still very frustrated and self conscious if I  <br/>
do something more easily than she does, or have something better, and  <br/>
she tends to laugh and do the happy dance if she bests me.  If my  <br/>
kids do better than hers at something, she goes into a funk or pout.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at MySpace.  Holly does some cool html stuff.  And I&#39;m  <br/>
not at all surprised Holly has her brothers on her &quot;top eight&quot;  <br/>
friends section.   I thought it worth pointing out for the record  <br/>
though, that Kirby, at 19, with 58 friends (other sites that are  <br/>
reciprocal with his), has Marty 3rd and Holly 4th.   The first is  <br/>
another unschooler he&#39;s known since they were 7 and 8.  Second is a  <br/>
homeschooler he knew from the SCA, who is in the military now.  Of  <br/>
the remaining four, one&#39;s a homeschooler and three he knows from a  <br/>
gaming shop.<br/>
<br/>
Marty, 17, has 63 friends and he has Holly in first position and  <br/>
Kirby in 2nd.  Then  there are three locals he met through  <br/>
homeschooling or La Leche League (lifelong friend, Julie), then one  <br/>
he met at a Live and Learn conference, and the next two I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was the least sibling friendly.  Marty is #5 and Kirby is #6.    <br/>
Still, top eight. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re friendly other ways too, of course.  Marty is playing  <br/>
Oblivion in Kirby&#39;s room.  Holly and Kirby play Guitar Hero in  <br/>
Marty&#39;s room (and Kirby&#39;s working on Final Fantasy X-2 sometimes, in  <br/>
Marty&#39;s room).  Kirby has gone to housesit, and took the laptop that  <br/>
belongs to the family but is &quot;Holly&#39;s computer,&quot; and she&#39;s using his  <br/>
while he&#39;s gone.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s very little &quot;no&quot; or &quot;get out&quot; and I think it&#39;s because they  <br/>
didn&#39;t hear that much from me or their dad.  They&#39;re generous because  <br/>
that&#39;s what they&#39;re used to.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking lately about the camaraderie between  Brenna (16) and <br/>
Logan (13).  We&#39;re in a new house and I can hear them  easier at night now when <br/>
I&#39;ve gone to bed.  They stay up later than I do  watching TV or playing games or <br/>
just hanging out together. Many nights I wake up  not because the TV is too <br/>
loud but because of the sound of their laughter. It&#39;s  a comforting happy sound <br/>
and a nice way to go to sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
Logan planned his 13th birthday party last week and the first person on his  <br/>
guest list was Brenna.  I didn&#39;t expect them to be such good friends when  <br/>
they were teens.  It&#39;s very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276884108">The last two on Marty&#39;s top eight are Kate and Lisa, they met at conference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love how my kids get along. The girls are each other&#39;s best friends. They<br/>
don&#39;t always get along, but they are always there for each other. (sharing<br/>
clothes is sometimes an issue, depends on their &#39;mood&#39; at the time).  Lisa<br/>
has a computer in her room and has told her brothers that they are welcome<br/>
to use it when she&#39;s not home or not busy with it. And the game systems are<br/>
in the boys room, but anyone is welcome to go in and use them.  Rarely is it<br/>
an issue. I don&#39;t think they think much of it really.  The older kids love<br/>
to get a group of teens together and go to the local park or nature center<br/>
and play capture the flag. Especially after dark. They will have a dozen<br/>
14-22 year olds gathered. And they think nothing of inviting their 10 year<br/>
old brother along for the fun. I&#39;ve never asked them to do that, they just<br/>
do. Of course, it was exciting when the police came one night to check them<br/>
out. A helicopter and 3 cars. But that&#39;s a different story....with a fun<br/>
ending and one of Ben&#39;s favorite stories to tell.  Anyway, my kids do stuff<br/>
together all the time because they like each other&#39;s company.  They enjoy<br/>
spending time with their Dad and I. Their friends have gotten used to it and<br/>
think it&#39;s great, but often, when a newcomer joins in they find it all very<br/>
odd.<br/>
<br/>
The girls insisted that Chuck and I get a Myspace page. So we could read<br/>
what they write. I would never had bothered except they made one for me. And<br/>
Kate, who writes the most, is often asking us &quot;did you read my latest<br/>
blog?&quot;.  No need for secrets. They know we will respect their privacy when<br/>
asked and we won&#39;t snoop, but they are very open with us because they know<br/>
they can trust us. And now, some of their closer friends will do the same.<br/>
Ask us if we read their latest blog entry. I&#39;ve had to subscribe to a few<br/>
because they were offended if I hadn&#39;t noticed a new one.<br/>

and then went back to school, but still they met in an unschooling  <br/>
group).<br/>

<br/>
My kids have played boffer wars, and a game Marty made up called Orc  <br/>
Ball.  They haven&#39;t been lately, but did for years.  One December 26  <br/>
the police came (no helicopters, darn it) when they were having a  <br/>
boffer battle in the leftover trees of the Christmas tree lot behind  <br/>
our house.  The owners knew they did it every year, and didn&#39;t mind,  <br/>
but the police didn&#39;t know and sent them home (which was the gate at  <br/>
the end of the lot &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

<br/>
Me too.  Holly kept showing me her page, and then just decided I  <br/>
should have my own.  Marty made me a friend before I even knew how to  <br/>
get in there.  So I&#39;m just there to see Holly&#39;s stuff, and see other  <br/>
people&#39;s sites by following her friends photos.  I know lots of their  <br/>
friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685726609">Forgive me, I am still new, when it comes to<br/>
unschooling. But lately in my quest for knowledge<br/>
about it, I can&#39;t find anything about dating. My<br/>
husband and I had planned to be very strict about<br/>
dating. But now we are on the fence and not sure which<br/>
direction to go in. I feel teenagers shouldn&#39;t date<br/>
one on one, or be alone because of my fears about sex.<br/>
However, if you teach your children from a young age<br/>
the value of abstience then it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br/>
And then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about my &#39;rules&#39;<br/>
about dating. Am I correct? That is the ideal of<br/>
unschooling????<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533935422">==-=-=-=-=-=-=I feel teenagers shouldn&#39;t date one on one, or be alone <br/>
because of my fears about sex.<br/>
However, if you teach your children from a young age the value of abstinence <br/>
then it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  And then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about my <br/>
&#39;rules&#39; about dating. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a young child could comprehend the idea of abstinence, so I <br/>
don&#39;t see how you could teach it from a young age.  You can, however, be <br/>
open and honest with your children from the time they began asking <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
You can share *your* ideas about the value of abstinence all you want, but <br/>
in the end, your child will be the one to make decisions regarding sex.  If <br/>
your child thinks your biggest concern is abstinence, they may not be likely <br/>
to come to you for help or advice if they make a different choice.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very important to differentiate between your values and facts <br/>
regarding sex.  Many people DO have sex outside of marriage with no short or <br/>
long term harm.  Yes there are risks, but it is not true that all sex <br/>
outside of marriage is harmful.<br/>
<br/>
The teen years span from 13 to 19 and the needs and desires will vary <br/>
greatly throughout those years.  There is nothing wrong with encouraging <br/>
your teen to do things in groups, rather than one on one (and I think most <br/>
teens prefer this when they are younger), but at some point your child will <br/>
be alone with someone of the opposite sex.<br/>
<br/>
A neighbor once asked me if I have had &quot;the talk&quot; with my kids.  My reply <br/>
included that there isn&#39;t &quot;the&quot; talk - there are lots of small moments when <br/>
we can share facts and our thoughts/beliefs/values/ with our children.<br/>
<br/>
I had an experience about a week ago.  A friend stopped by my house.  She is <br/>
getting divorced and had planned to unschool her children, but now they are <br/>
in school.<br/>
<br/>
After she left, I drove Lisa (13) to an activity in town.  It seemed like a <br/>
good opportunity to talk about one very real risk of pregnancy out of <br/>
wedlock or with the wrong person - that you will end up as a single parent. <br/>
(Plus we were side by side in the car &lt;g&gt;)  I said that it is not a bad <br/>
thing to be a single parent, but that it is very difficult.  Not only is <br/>
money likely to be in short supply (something my dd is familiar with), but <br/>
the one parent may not be able to figure out a way to stay home with the<br/>
child/ren.  I mentioned the problem of what to do when the child is sick - <br/>
that the parent may not have sick leave and staying home could mean less $$ <br/>
in the family budget.<br/>
<br/>
This was a personal example that she could understand.  I did not say that <br/>
she *should not* have sex before marriage, I simply told her about a real <br/>
life situation for someone she knows.  It gives her one more thing to <br/>
consider when she is making choices in her life.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you mean your fears about rape? Pregnancy? Disease? Or are you <br/>
talking about morals? It will help you to sort this out if you get <br/>
clear on what you&#39;re actually concerned about. For the first three, <br/>
there are lots of alternatives to a big dating prohibition that will <br/>
help you keep your kids safe *and* calm your fears. If you think <br/>
unschooling will somehow contribute to your child having &quot;loose&quot; <br/>
morals, well, we have other things to talk about than dating. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you do in fact have fears of sex itself, then I would hope that you <br/>
don&#39;t intend to pass them on to your children! Whatever caused your <br/>
fears is not part of *their* lives. Give them the chance to have <br/>
healthy, joyous sex lives by sharing with them that healthy, joyous <br/>
sex lives are possible and desirable.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters are 12 and 13. For their whole lives, they have seen <br/>
their dad and me hugging, kissing, snuggling. As they&#39;ve gotten older, <br/>
without any real plan to do so, it has become natural and comfortable <br/>
for dh and me to engage in some rated-G sexual playfulness in front of <br/>
them. We (meaning the kids and the parents) also have casual talks <br/>
about whatever sex-related subjects that come up during life. We don&#39;t <br/>
approach sex as a big, scary subject; it&#39;s just another unschooling <br/>
topic of conversation, you know?<br/>
<br/>
The result is that the kids take things in stride. They often respond <br/>
to our playfulness with their own playful eye-rolling and &quot;Oh, <br/>
brother&quot; type comments. And one day, when one of them walked in on dh <br/>
and me at a private moment, she simply turned around again and walked <br/>
out, mostly unphased. Dh later asked her if her eyes were all right. :-<br/>
)<br/>
<br/>
This year, both girls are headed off to situations where they will <br/>
have virtually their first chance to be alone with boys. We have <br/>
talked about some good-sense safety precautions, and I related a story <br/>
from my college days about a vulnerable situation I got myself into <br/>
that I look back and know I was lucky to get out of safely. I&#39;ve also <br/>
talked frankly about how good sex feels, and how easy it is to get <br/>
carried away when it&#39;s all new to you. We didn&#39;t need to go into much <br/>
detail about STDs and pregnancy because, well, those topics are kind <br/>
of old news by now.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the point is, sex and its pleasures and dangers and <br/>
consequences are all out on the table. When my daughters become <br/>
interested in dating, there won&#39;t be rules about it. No curfews, no <br/>
group requirements (not sure how this would help, given the number of <br/>
cars that contain multiple necking couples), no chaperones. Instead, <br/>
there will be talks about comfort levels and safety, self-respect, <br/>
love, birth control, and courtesy, and there will be, I hope, a mother-<br/>
daughter relationship that allows for questions and sharing and the <br/>
occasional tidbit of advice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids are usually in groups.  Kirby has had a few one-on-one kind  <br/>
of dates, taking someone he was particularly interested in to dinner  <br/>
or a movie, but it wasn&#39;t classic dating where the appointment was  <br/>
made days before and they dressed up.  It was a casual part of their  <br/>
normal lives.  More often he&#39;s gone with groups of three or more, in  <br/>
various combinations of males and females.   The idea of parking to  <br/>
make out doesn&#39;t happen.  As far as I know, anything like that has  <br/>
happened at campouts or once in his room (nothing extreme).  He  <br/>
drives a conversion van with a queen sized bed that folds down, but  <br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of it being used in that way.<br/>
<br/>
Holly went to a St. Patrick&#39;s party last Friday.  There was a  <br/>
contingency plan about Kirby and Brett (19 and 20) staying overnight,  <br/>
if they drank.  Marty was designated drive, but thought he might want  <br/>
to come back earliesh (meaning before 2:00).  Holly asked if she  <br/>
could stay over too, and I said no, because we could probably be in  <br/>
serious legal trouble for something like that, so she needed to come  <br/>
back when Marty did.  She understood it, and she trusts me not to say  <br/>
no if it&#39;s not for a good reason.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My<br/>
husband and I had planned to be very strict about<br/>

direction to go in.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I had strict rules about dating when I was a teen, and the result was  <br/>
that I went out EVERY possible &quot;date night&quot; and stayed until the  <br/>
stroke of whatever it was (10:00 on Wednesdays, and 11:00 or 12:00 or  <br/>
after the movie, depending how old I was and where I was going, on  <br/>
Fridays and Saturdays).  My mom had set it up in such an adversarial  <br/>
and non-trusting way, that I felt like a loser if I came home early  <br/>
(or failed to leave one of those night).  It was stupid.   I didn&#39;t  <br/>
even have sex until I was in college, though I had been dating since  <br/>
the summer before 10th grade (when I turned 15, not a moment  <br/>
before).   I was careful and responsible most of the time, but I was  <br/>
still treated like a suspect.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have no desperation to be out of the house.  They bring  <br/>
friends here.  They have no pressure to have one-on-one &quot;dates&quot; at  <br/>
all.  I&#39;ve seen that same dynamic with lots of unschoolers.  They&#39;re  <br/>
already hanging out in mixed-age groups.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen a couple of unschoolers who seemed TOTALLY to  miss  <br/>
that boat, and acted pretty thoughtlessly about dating, making all  <br/>
kinds of rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, if you teach your children from a young age<br/>
the value of abstience then it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Teaching isn&#39;t a good part of unschooling.  If your child learns  <br/>
benefits of abstinence, in honest real-world ways, that could be  <br/>
cool.  But she won&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; in abstinence just because her mother  <br/>
&quot;teaches her the value.&quot;  And as someone pointed out, if she thinks  <br/>
the only acceptable thing for you is abstinence, she will likely be  <br/>
secretive and you&#39;ll lose your position as an advisor and confidant.<br/>
<br/>
-=--=-My husband and I had planned to be very strict about dating.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Surely you can think of dozens of real-life stories of parents who  <br/>
were very strict and ended up with kids who got pregnant because the  <br/>
kids were kept ignorant of options.  I bet you can think of real life  <br/>
stories of teens who moved away from home because there were too many  <br/>
rules, and stories of girls leaving with the first teenaged boy who  <br/>
really paid attention to her, because it was the only way to get any  <br/>
freedom.<br/>
<br/>
A guy is going to have to pretty fantastic for Holly to be  <br/>
impressed.  She sees her brothers&#39; friends all the time, in all their  <br/>
everydayness.  And a guy would have to offer quite a bit for it to be  <br/>
worth her leaving home.  It&#39;s nice here.    She is very appreciated,  <br/>
respected and highly regarded.  She has no desperation for attention  <br/>
or freedom.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to hear about that.  My sister (three years younger than I  <br/>
am) was raped at 14, at knifepoint, by two guys, in an arroyo, while  <br/>
her slightly-younger friend (not her boyfriend, just a buddy) watched  <br/>
helplessly.  He was 12, maybe barely 13.   The leader bully was  <br/>
eventually imprisoned, but my sister didn&#39;t report it because they  <br/>
threatened to hurt the boy who was with her if she reported it to the  <br/>
police.<br/>
<br/>
Complicated, emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
If someone in your current life is bringing up emotional memories, it  <br/>
might be an excellent time to go for a session or two of counselling,  <br/>
maybe to discuss another pass at healing (for you) and to help you  <br/>
not lay all that on your kids.<br/>
<br/>
My mom was raped as a young teen, by her brother (who died of a fever  <br/>
within a year, and she didn&#39;t tell).  She didn&#39;t tell me until Kirby  <br/>
was a year old.  It did explain a lot of her odd behaviors over the  <br/>
years, and some of the odd messages she had given us, and seemingly- <br/>
nonsensical &quot;rules&quot; (Don&#39;t play in the barn with David—no general  <br/>
rule about not being in an enclosed place with a person of the  <br/>
opposite sex, but specifically barn, and specifically one sweet,  <br/>
harmless neighbor).  So children can be aversely affected even when  <br/>
they have no idea why.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not quite, Danie.  I don&#39;t know whether you are coming at this from a<br/>
religious POV, or as a victim of date-rape, or if you are living with<br/>
consequences of decisions you yourself made as a teen, but it sounds<br/>
like you have a lot of issues from your past that you are projecting<br/>
onto your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Talking to your children and answering their questions about<br/>
everything from a young age is very important, to be sure.  Being open<br/>
and honest and giving them truthful information is also<br/>
important...not just information about the bad stuff that can happen,<br/>
but also the good stuff.  You don&#39;t have to teach them about<br/>
abstinence any more than you have to teach them to read or math or<br/>
history or science.  <br/>
<br/>
The most important thing is establishing a relationship of trust with<br/>
your children and communicate with them all the time.  Sometimes I<br/>
want to tell my kids that they don&#39;t HAVE to tell me everything they<br/>
are thinking! LOL! TMI!  But I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
As the mom of a 16.5 year old girl, and an almost 15 year old boy, we<br/>
haven&#39;t had to make any rules about dating. Sarah has had the same<br/>
boyfriend since she was 13, which is rather young, but not younger<br/>
than I was as a teen.  We talk all the time, and she tells me<br/>
everything about their relationship, much more than I ever would have<br/>
told my parents.<br/>
<br/>
If you work hard at building a relationship of trust and communication<br/>
from the time they are small, you won&#39;t ever have to have rules.  You<br/>
will trust them to make the decisions that are right for them, and you<br/>
will know that they won&#39;t make decisions out of rebellion and<br/>
resentment to the rules you can&#39;t possibly enforce anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248516008">This is a great discussion of the whole topic of<br/>
dating/sex. I agree with most everything you said and<br/>
Sandra&#39;s comments are great too. Thank you. I don&#39;t<br/>
agree that &#39;many people do have sex outside of<br/>
marriage with no short or long term harm&#39;. Firstly,<br/>
there is just no way of really knowing/measuring this.<br/>
I think that the younger people are, the trickier it<br/>
can be to have emotionally healthy sex. I agree that<br/>
with lots of trust and dialog between parents and<br/>
teens, the risks of (emotional) harm are way lower. I<br/>
realize also that most all of what people see as<br/>
examples of how these things play out are of &#39;schooled<br/>
and ruled&#39; teens. <br/>
The other point I want to add is about single parents.<br/>
I think it is selfish to have a child as a single<br/>
parent and not do everything in ones power to provide<br/>
a 2 parent home for a child. Adoption is a solution<br/>
here.  What does this say to the fathers of our<br/>
children to not mention the value of a father? We<br/>
could go on and on about the value of a father for a<br/>
child, for the wife too to have that love and support<br/>
etc. My sister made a concious decision to have her<br/>
daughter without a husband. The childs father left and<br/>
didn&#39;t want any part of it. Much earlier in her<br/>
daughter&#39;s life than my sister expected (age 4, I&#39;m<br/>
guessing) her little girl started expressing the<br/>
desire for a father. Of course she was starting to<br/>
notice she was different in this way from many kids<br/>
she knew. This has been an ongoing emotional issue<br/>
ever since. Its always bubbling under the surface. Her<br/>
daughter is 10 now. It was heartbreaking then and<br/>
still is. And the ups and downs of dating possible<br/>
future fathers, getting attached then having to let<br/>
go.......for a child this is.......I don&#39;t know what<br/>
word to use. Its just so sad to me. And it is<br/>
avoidable. Not to say we (who have a 2 parent home for<br/>
our kids) have no emotional stress etc. but it just<br/>
seems like such a more stable base from which to<br/>
start. These are (some of) the discussions I&#39;m working<br/>
on with my kids, 14 and 10, how to create and start<br/>
out with the most healthy and stable marriage, that<br/>
you can then bring a baby into. I really think, like<br/>
Sandra spoke to, that if our home life is really<br/>
enjoyable, it will take a really great person to draw<br/>
them away......that they will be more likely to choose<br/>
a great partner. And of course, all the other aspects<br/>
mentioned, lots of dialog, trust etc.<br/>
Thanks for the dicsussion.<br/>
<br/>
Kathy<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think a young child could comprehend the idea<br/>
of abstinence, so <br/>
I <br/>
don&#39;t see how you could teach it from a young age. <br/>
You can, however, <br/>
be <br/>
open and honest with your children from the time they<br/>
began asking <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
You can share *your* ideas about the value of<br/>
abstinence all you want, <br/>
but <br/>
in the end, your child will be the one to make<br/>
decisions regarding sex.  <br/>
If <br/>
your child thinks your biggest concern is abstinence,<br/>
they may not be <br/>
likely <br/>
to come to you for help or advice if they make a<br/>
different choice.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very important to differentiate between<br/>
your values and <br/>
facts <br/>
regarding sex.  Many people DO have sex outside of<br/>
marriage with no <br/>
short or <br/>
long term harm.  Yes there are risks, but it is not<br/>
true that all sex <br/>
outside of marriage is harmful.<br/>
<br/>
The teen years span from 13 to 19 and the needs and<br/>
desires will vary <br/>
greatly throughout those years.  There is nothing<br/>
wrong with <br/>
encouraging <br/>
your teen to do things in groups, rather than one on<br/>
one (and I think <br/>
most <br/>
teens prefer this when they are younger), but at some<br/>
point your child <br/>
will <br/>
be alone with someone of the opposite sex.<br/>
<br/>
A neighbor once asked me if I have had &quot;the talk&quot; with<br/>
my kids.  My <br/>
reply <br/>
included that there isn&#39;t &quot;the&quot; talk - there are lots<br/>
of small moments <br/>
when <br/>
we can share facts and our thoughts/beliefs/values/<br/>
with our children.<br/>
<br/>
I had an experience about a week ago.  A friend<br/>
stopped by my house.  <br/>
She is <br/>
getting divorced and had planned to unschool her<br/>
children, but now they <br/>
are <br/>
in school.<br/>
<br/>
After she left, I drove Lisa (13) to an activity in<br/>
town.  It seemed <br/>
like a <br/>
good opportunity to talk about one very real risk of<br/>
pregnancy out of <br/>
wedlock or with the wrong person - that you will end<br/>
up as a single <br/>
parent. <br/>
(Plus we were side by side in the car &lt;g&gt;)  I said<br/>
that it is not a bad <br/>
thing to be a single parent, but that it is very<br/>
difficult.  Not only        <br/>
is <br/>
money likely to be in short supply (something my dd is<br/>
familiar with), <br/>
but <br/>
the one parent may not be able to figure out a way to<br/>
stay home with <br/>
the<br/>
child/ren.  I mentioned the problem of what to do when<br/>
the child is <br/>
sick - <br/>
that the parent may not have sick leave and staying<br/>
home could mean <br/>
less $$ <br/>
in the family budget.<br/>
<br/>
This was a personal example that she could understand.<br/>
 I did not say <br/>
that <br/>
she *should not* have sex before marriage, I simply<br/>
told her about a <br/>
real <br/>
life situation for someone she knows.  It gives her<br/>
one more thing to <br/>
consider when she is making choices in her life.<br/>

Keith just got back from our friends&#39; house.  She was my bridesmaid.   <br/>
My 21st anniversary is Friday, but Keith and I were together (with  <br/>
sex, outside marriage) for six years before that.  My bridesmaid is  <br/>
not married, but let me run the numbers.  Keith and I have been  <br/>
together for 27 years, and she and Steve were together four years  <br/>
before that.  They&#39;re still not married.<br/>
<br/>
Having sex isn&#39;t the same as having children.  My bridesmaid had a  <br/>
medical problem which required medication that couldn&#39;t mix with  <br/>
pregnancy, but to stop taking the medication for the length of a  <br/>
pregnancy would have let a tumor grow that would probably have killed  <br/>
her.   She had to choose not to have children.<br/>

Unschoolers are different from all the schoolkids around them.  We  <br/>
could just send them to school now, or put them up for adoption to  <br/>
schooling families, but are you saying we should have just abstained  <br/>
from unschooling in the first place?<br/>

There are many people who see our choice to unschool as potentially  <br/>
&quot;heartbreaking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Avoidable by having abstained from sex in the first place you mean?<br/>
<br/>
I knew a family with six children.  The parents were married  <br/>
throughout.  The first two were born when the parents were young, and  <br/>
though the first was probably a surprise, the second was planned.  (I  <br/>
married him, but it&#39;s not Keith, it was long ago; his name was Jim  <br/>
Gill.)  There were four other children, each born despite the  <br/>
mother&#39;s use of a new and hopefully more reliable form of birth  <br/>
control than the one that had failed so recently.<br/>
<br/>
Abstinence isn&#39;t magic, and it MUST be a choice.  Our culture has  <br/>
hundreds of years of recorded (and many more to be extrapolated  <br/>
easily) failure of parental rules, &quot;controls&quot; and threats.  If it was  <br/>
going to work, why didn&#39;t it work in the 19th century?  18th?  17th?<br/>
<br/>
Information is important, and of course information should include  <br/>
the sorrows and fears involved with single parenthood, and it should  <br/>
also include honest information about birth control, and it should  <br/>
NOT include assumptive statements involving things like sex outside  <br/>
of marriage always causes harm (which I believe might be the other  <br/>
side of the coin marked in public thusly: &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
agree that &#39;many people do have sex outside of<br/>
marriage with no short or long term harm&#39;. Firstly,<br/>
there is just no way of really knowing/measuring this.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
*ONE* false statement from a parent makes all other statements suspect.<br/>
One overblown warning or claim erodes the child&#39;s trust in other  <br/>
warnings.<br/>

true for &quot;many&quot; or &quot;most&quot; people. What matters is what each person is  <br/>
able to do. I personally have always been terrible at casual sex; I  <br/>
get too emotionally invested, I get hurt, I can&#39;t tell whether the  <br/>
fact that this person wants to sleep with me means they find me  <br/>
attractive and value me or means they&#39;re happy to exploit me. It&#39;s  <br/>
best for me to avoid it, even when I&#39;m tempted. My partner David and  <br/>
I are technically non-monogamous, but I haven&#39;t acted on that in  <br/>
almost six years--and that last brief affair was bad enought that it  <br/>
just reinforced my notion that I shouldn&#39;t try casual sex again.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend--actually, two, now that I think about it--who are  <br/>
really good at it. They can have this light, pleasing, sometimes very  <br/>
emotionally satisfying, deep sex with people they&#39;ll never see again,  <br/>
and walk away feeing good about it, good about themselves, good about  <br/>
the other person. Sometimes it&#39;s hard for me to believe it&#39;s really  <br/>
OK for them--and not just OK, but positive--because that is so  <br/>
different from my own experience. But I listen to what they tell me  <br/>
and I have to believe them.<br/>
<br/>
So, one complicated thing I have to hold in my head and heart is that  <br/>
I can&#39;t lay down a rule for my kids about whether and when it&#39;s OK to  <br/>
have sex, how often, with whom--they are going to have to figure that  <br/>
out for themselves, probably through some trial and error. They&#39;re  <br/>
probably going to sleep with some people they regret sleeping with.  <br/>
If they&#39;re like me, they&#39;re also probably going to pass on some  <br/>
opportunities and regret that, too. Two of the opportunities I regret  <br/>
are with boys I loved very deeply for years in middle school and high  <br/>
school (yes, two of them--feelings are complicated) and I&#39;m sorry  <br/>
that I never was able to share that kind of intimacy with them.<br/>
<br/>
There can be big consequences to sex--birth control failures,  <br/>
disease, emotional fallout from mistakes. So I want to acknowledge  <br/>
that to my kids. But I don&#39;t want to magnify those consequences unduly.<br/>

On that last one, I&#39;m thinking of two things.  One was a long talk I  <br/>
had with my boys and another couple of their friends when a desperate  <br/>
kind of teen girl (I felt sorry for her, but still...) seemed to want  <br/>
and need nothing more than to be liberated from babysitting her  <br/>
younger siblings while her dad drank and partied and slept.  The  <br/>
mom&#39;s whereabouts were unknown to me, but she was long gone one way  <br/>
or another.  I warned the boys that a pregnancy might seem like a  <br/>
great thing to her, if her dad would throw her out about it, or if  <br/>
the other family would take her in.  And I told them that if they  <br/>
ever get a girl pregnant they have no option but to be a father at  <br/>
that point, but they would have no control over whether they were  <br/>
allowed to be good fathers or absent fathers or even whether the  <br/>
pregnancy would continue to term.  They might doom themselves to a  <br/>
life of guilt and shame and no contact with the child ever.   The  <br/>
other thought is of girls who have been forced to give babies up for  <br/>
adoption so that the parents could save face.  Many, many parents.   <br/>
And DID they save face?  Depends which side of their face you look  <br/>
at, I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030222074">Another thing I wanted to add to the list, not sure what the short version  <br/>
is though...<br/>
 <br/>
My first &quot;time&quot; was with a boy who I was together with for almost a year,  in <br/>
high school.  We were really good friends, had mutual friends,  etc.  After <br/>
we broke up, the friendship was destroyed, maybe from  embarassment?  or <br/>
Jealousy?  Being uncomfortable?   I  don&#39;t know...I just know we didn&#39;t do stuff <br/>
together anymore as a group like we  had.  Kinda like divorce, where there&#39;s a <br/>
possibility you might lose a lot  of mutual friends.  Maybe it could be <br/>
explained as:<br/>

Loss of mutual friends.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I added these two to my building list:<br/>
<br/>
probable loss of that friendship in case of breakup<br/>
possible loss of mutual friends<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just the mutual friends loss that&#39;s a risk.  Marty had two  <br/>
groups he used to hang around with.  One was a few homeschoolers, all  <br/>
older than he was, some past school age.  One was gamers he met  <br/>
through Kirby.  Some nights he would hang out with one group and some  <br/>
nights with another.  Through Marty and Kirby and parties at our  <br/>
house, they mingled.<br/>
<br/>
A homeschooler (Sadie, who was mentioned as a cloning candidate, in  <br/>
the family panel in St. Louis) started to &quot;go out with&quot; (not much  <br/>
out, but &quot;going&quot;) with Ryan, who was part of the gamer group.  Both  <br/>
are grown people, 21 and 23 at the moment, I think, and 20 and 22  <br/>
when it started.  First, BOTH groups Marty hung with were stalled  <br/>
out.  Ryan was busy with Sadie?  Okay, maybe he could go bowling with  <br/>
Brett and....   oh.  Sadie&#39;s with Ryan tonight.<br/>
<br/>
So loss of social life started happening immediately.<br/>
<br/>
And that wasn&#39;t even about Marty having sex/dating/relationships.  <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;  It was about Marty having introduced his friends to one another.<br/>
<br/>
Life is risky. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now, sure enough, if Sadie and Ryan break up lots of things will  <br/>
become very awkward.  It will affect who we can invite to parties at  <br/>
OUR house, no matter what kind of party it is.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how to add that warning to the list.  Life is fluxxy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632543297">I wrote this out once, but had one of those computer<br/>
moments when the screen changes and I didn&#39;t even have<br/>
my hand on the mouse. Awwwwwww, technology.<br/>
Anyways, here&#39;s my story since a lot of people are<br/>
very interested in why I would have such rules and<br/>
what is my fear for those rules. When I was 15, I was<br/>
gang raped by my first boyfriend and two of his<br/>
friends. This went on about 4 months. I never told a<br/>
soul till I was 18. That event(s) caused me to have<br/>
post tramatic stress. I go to therapy. I&#39;m coming to<br/>
terms with my guilt. I have felt responsible for it. <br/>
But I really listened to what everyone has said on<br/>
this post. (when I read a post, you&#39;ll have different<br/>
voices in my head) lol   Also, when I posted this on<br/>
here, I asked my brother (VERY close relationship)<br/>
what his thoughts were. And we talked about &#39;our talk&#39;<br/>
on sex, relationships, dating, etc... He was 12, then.<br/>
And he told me I gave him the best advice, and that is<br/>
the reason he won&#39;t have sex with just anyone. And<br/>
because I&#39;ve been right ( I warned him about his first<br/>
g/f, she was manipulative and tried unsuccessfuly to<br/>
get in his pants, all to get pregnant) He trusts my<br/>
opinion and advice.<br/>
So, I am taking his advice so to speak, I am letting<br/>
go of my fears. My child (one day children) will be<br/>
just fine when it comes to dating, sex, relationships.<br/>
If I can say one thing on behave of something I shared<br/>
with my brother, I showed him (again at age 12) what<br/>
STDs looked like. And he said that alone made him want<br/>
to keep his penis in his pants. Also, I think his<br/>
girlfriend helped too. After all she did everything to<br/>
pressure him, and he wouldn&#39;t budge. I&#39;m proud that he<br/>
makes decisions based on what I showed him. Because<br/>
some people in life can be very scary. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to the little girl who wants a daddy.<br/>
She might crave that for the rest of her life and one<br/>
day, she might just let it go. As her aunt maybe you<br/>
can show her that even without her biological dad, she<br/>
is still loved and valued. Because that&#39;s really what<br/>
she&#39;s looking for. I&#39;ve been down this road. I never<br/>
got that until  I was married. That&#39;s one reason it<br/>
was so easy for me to be prey. That&#39;s why I never<br/>
turned in those jerks for all the abuse they put me<br/>
threw. I&#39;m all for protecting our kids. But I have<br/>
seen (which is why, I think I posted, because my heart<br/>
was telling me strict rules would only be WRONG) what<br/>
can happen if we are strict. As a teenager, I knew a<br/>
girl who got pregnant, and the only time she ever had<br/>
sex, or time to be alone to have sex, was while at<br/>
church. They did it in the baptismal. Lovely, huh?<br/>
<br/>
I know I said a lot, thanks for hearing me out. <br/>

Well that&#39;s a HUGE part of what we&#39;re talking about in general on  <br/>
this list, though, is kids not being needy or desperate for the  <br/>
attention of other people.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>
<br/>
If we can be respectful of our kids and attentive and affectionate  <br/>
and patient, why on earth would they trust ANYone more than they  <br/>
trust us?<br/>
<br/>
Even in the throes of puberty and impending adulthood, even when  <br/>
Kirby can show momentary exasperation with my questions or advice or  <br/>
reminders, he will come back later when he&#39;s less frustrated and ask  <br/>
me questions.   He&#39;s getting to the point that he feels the  <br/>
biological imperative to get away from his nest, his home, his mom  <br/>
and dad, but he trusts us.<br/>
<br/>
And about that baptismal sex thing...<br/>
I&#39;m guessing it was a Baptist church, and not Catholic.<br/>
I&#39;m sure some Catholics, Presbyterians, etc. here might&#39;ve had an  <br/>
&quot;EWW!&quot; moment picturing teens up on the font in some precarious  <br/>
position.  But for the benefit of those not raised &quot;low church,&quot; a  <br/>
baptismal can also be a metal room, basically, about 8 feet long and  <br/>
five feet wide, with a curtained window opening toward where the  <br/>
congregation would be (I&#39;m guessing they were there then!) and one  <br/>

There were better places at my church if one wanted to find a hidey  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857719644">O.K.  My husbands thoughts on the matter are as follows.<br/>
<br/>
The surest way of alienating your children in regards to dating is to<br/>
put strict limits on it.  Creating feelings of shame or to expect you<br/>
to be disappointed with them can create an unbridgeable gap with<br/>
regards to sex or sexual activity.  The most important thing is to<br/>
ensure they have a strong sense of self worth.  They wont strike out<br/>
to find it in others through sex or other social means like drugs and<br/>
alcohol -or at least will be less likely to for those reasons. <br/>
Participating in potentially risky behavior can be a choice and not a<br/>
reaction, but is less likely in children with a strong self worth. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with him. <br/>
<br/>
I have had many friends who totally went wild as teens and young<br/>
adults.  Some ended up in downward spirals of self destruction others<br/>
are happily walking their paths through life.  The major differences<br/>
were the relationships with one or more of their parents or mentors,<br/>
their friends, and their education on the subject (whether through<br/>
self education or from others).   <br/>
<br/>
I was mostly self educated and read a lot on the subject of sex and<br/>
sexuality, mostly because the miss information I was getting from<br/>
peers drove me nuts.  Besides not finding the right guy until I was<br/>
older than all but one of my close friends I knew I wasn&#39;t ready to<br/>
deal with the consequences yet.  It turned out to be rather fortunate<br/>
as I am rather easy to get pregnant.  One burst condom,  and sex two<br/>
days before I missed a pill and had to wait for a week to get them<br/>
replaced are proof. (if not the fact we could only squeeze two &#39;tries&#39;<br/>
in on the week we chose to &#39;try&#39; for baby number four).<br/>
<br/>
Also my &#39;right guy&#39; wasn&#39;t &#39;right&#39; because of our fabulous, close,<br/>
loving relationship, but the way he viewed sex and women.  He loved<br/>
women, different shapes and sizes blondes, brunets, and red heads.  He<br/>
respected them and had a good grasp of female sexuality.  He loved sex<br/>
in a spiritual way and took great pains to find out how his partners<br/>
would respond to him and how not to cross comfort zones.  Long story<br/>
short he was good at and serious about sex.  It wasn&#39;t just another<br/>
notch in the bed post for him but a challenge and life enriching<br/>
experience for him.  We were friends for years after but have since<br/>
lost touch.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want &#39;my first&#39; to be the crappy experience most of my<br/>
friends had.  Cheap and dirty and quick, usually resulting in a loss<br/>
of friendship(s) if not self respect.  I wanted it to be something to<br/>
look back at fondly when I got older.  It is.  Though I can&#39;t remember<br/>
&#39;The first time&#39; it&#39;s kind of all mashed together as this really<br/>
fabulous six or eight months of great sex.  <br/>
<br/>
If I hadn&#39;t felt free to explore sex as a topic of conversation as<br/>
well as all the verying sexual situations I tried out before actually<br/>
having sex I wouldn&#39;t have had the crappy experiences and the not so<br/>
crappy experiences that led to my choice.  Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t<br/>
always so thoughtful with future relationships sexual or not.<br/>
<br/>
It really is an individual choice I think it&#39;s best to arm our kids<br/>
with the knowledge to make the choices -best for them- at the time. <br/>
It is also important to make sure as best we can as parents that our<br/>
kids will feel safe coming to us if they need too.  In grade 8 my<br/>
thirteen yearold friend went through a drug enduced abortion alone<br/>
with her not so nice 24 yearold boyfriend who had provided her with<br/>
the drugs.  She was never quite the same afterwards and we few who<br/>
knew about it agonized about what to do or not do as she had sworn<br/>
each of us to secrecy as her mother would have pitched her from the<br/>
house.  Her twenty something sister had been tossed out at 17 for<br/>
getting pregnant and then lost the pregnancy while living on the street.<br/>
<br/>
The huge problem I think that will be avoided buy most unschoolers are<br/>
the incidence of polite sex.  Many of my friends had sex even as<br/>
adults because of their inability to say no to someone.  They had been<br/>
well trained to listen to authority and/or not hurt others feelings<br/>
growing up.  So just let the sex happen and then many times just<br/>
removed themselves from the relationship afterwards.  <br/>
<br/>
Last point some people are less outgoing then others or like to keep<br/>
their private life private.  Sandra&#39;s -at least I remember it as being<br/>
you if it wasn&#39;t correct me please- suggestion of keeping handy items<br/>
like condoms that your kids know they or their friends can use is a<br/>
way to provide a small safety net for our children.  I know friends<br/>
that didn&#39;t have sex because they didn&#39;t have that safety net and are<br/>
glad of it as removed from the moment they were able to make a better<br/>
choice.  But I know far more that didn&#39;t have it and became pregnant<br/>
or received a new health complication as a result.<br/>
<br/>
the movie American Pie has some good lessons for parents and kids<br/>
about how different people react to and experience sex.  It&#39;s not for<br/>
a younger audience I don&#39;t think but, I have only seen the extended<br/>
and not theatrical release of the movie.  It&#39;s possible the theater<br/>
releases would be more suited to perhaps some ten yearolds maybe.  I<br/>
would think my son at 11 is&#39;t ready for it yet but that is our family.<br/>
 I know a grown woman who felt it was too much for her.<br/>
<br/>
Could go on but little number four needs some snuggles.<br/>

really did NOT want any of those relationships to end.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have any of that intensity about attention, because  <br/>
they&#39;re not starved for gentle direct eye contact and other such things.<br/>
