<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Fellow Homeschoolin&#39; Folks, </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Those were some pretty silly quotes on political 
leaders, but surprising..NO.&nbsp; I have long loathed &amp; been saddened by 
the sight of our political system, and the action of it, and the invasion of 
it.&nbsp; I am voting &amp; working with promoting the Green Party.&nbsp; Ralph 
Nader, a corporate power buster...environmentalist.&nbsp; His vice president 
candidate is LaDuke..an Indian activist.&nbsp; I have heard and folowed Ralph 
Nader&#39;s campagne for years.....he doesn&#39;t use Big Business to fund his campagne, 
and that&#39;s probably why few people hear about him.&nbsp; But he&#39;s been around , 
speaking on political &amp; environmental issues for years.&nbsp; He is touring 
, so if you have a chance to hear him speak, it be wise to lend him a curious 
ear, for the future of this country.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The neighborhoods here, are quickly becoming 
desolate.&nbsp; I remember being a kid playing in the woods out behind my house, 
that is some of why I chose the location we are now in..it is crucial in my 
opinion to have wooded wonderlands to explore when you are young...but they are 
all dissapppearing, as they develop those areas behind our houses, etc, and put 
up those new condos &amp; partical board boxes....row by row by row......kind of 
like lining up in school to go to class.....stand still....No talking.&nbsp; 
Mass allegiance, and PRODUCTION. I&#39;m sickened by the whole thing...Every time I 
drive by the Red Oaks COmmunity or Fir HIlls....Deer Lake......where all the 
things they name themselves after are ripped out &amp; have been removed...what 
do these names symbolize..In Memory OF?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way not to 
participate in the destruction is Not to buy their products.&nbsp; And to speak 
up when given the oppurtunity.&nbsp; </font></div>
