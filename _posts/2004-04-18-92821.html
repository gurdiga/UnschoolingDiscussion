<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996202492">-=-On my way to pick up my child I was pulling into the drive <br/>
<br/>
way and almost hit her 18 month old. Alone, playing in the front <br/>
<br/>
yard, no mother in sight,-=-<br/>
<br/>
So her mom was in the back yard taking good care of YOUR daughter.  <br/>
That&#39;s not an unschooling issue.<br/>
I&#39;ve found two loose toddlers in my life, and once the mother yelled at me <br/>
for having her baby.  Waddly diaper baby, headed for the cattail swamp at the <br/>
side of the Rio Grande, across a dike road.  I stopped my van, picked the baby <br/>
up, and walked over to the yard where the mom was hanging out her laundry.  She <br/>
was angry.   She wasn&#39;t an unschooler, so who can we blame?  No diaper-baby <br/>
is &quot;unschooled.&quot;  They&#39;re babies.  So that&#39;s not an unschooling story.<br/>
<br/>
A distant relative of mine had a baby crawl up on the train tracks behind her <br/>
house.   Their older kids were in school.  Does that make it a <br/>
neglect-of-schooled-kids story?  No, the baby was a baby.<br/>
<br/>
If you find unschoolers who haven&#39;t washed their cars, will you come and <br/>
lecture us about how stupid it is not to wash a car, therefor unschoolers are <br/>
stupid?    Thoughtful logic is a really good thing to model for your children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-takers her sons in a room to spank them for not watching thier <br/>
<br/>
sister. . . Then I learn she unschools.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could share with her this website:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>
If she doesn&#39;t have internet access, maybe you could print out some of the <br/>
good parts and take them to her.  It could help her children a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Part of deciding how we will be with our own children is looking at how other <br/>
moms are.  That mom will stand as a bad example for you, and probably will <br/>
intensify your non-spanking and your watchfulness.  That&#39;s good.  You might find <br/>
good examples to emulate, too.  But if you decide now what you will believe <br/>
in ten years, that&#39;s not a good thing.  It could keep you from growing into the <br/>
best mom you could be.<br/>
