<div id="ygrps-yiv-9687609">To those of you in the Detroit area ... (there seem to be a handful of <br/>
us) --- is anyone interested in starting an unschooling group? I have <br/>
two daughters, 12 and almost 9. If you&#39;re interested in starting a <br/>
group, let me know. We just started home schooling/unschooling in <br/>
January and would love to find, or start, a group. We live in the <br/>
Dearborn/Livonia/Canton area. Please e-mail me off list if you are <br/>
interested.<br/>
