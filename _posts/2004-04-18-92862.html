<div id="ygrps-yiv-753813852">I live in Ohio, and I&#39;m required to notify the school superintendent <br/>
every year about our decision to homeschool and to supply (supposedly <br/>
for &quot;informational purposes only&quot;) an outline of what we will be <br/>
covering during the year and a list of curriculum materials.  This is <br/>
my first year in which I&#39;m required to notify, and I was wondering <br/>
how unschoolers comply with this.  I&#39;m not really sure what my boys <br/>
will be interested in throughout the next year, so I&#39;ve compiled a <br/>
list of what we did this year and figured I&#39;d just use that for next <br/>
year.  Also, at the end of the year I have to have a portfolio of my <br/>
child&#39;s work evaluated by a certified teacher, and I was wondering <br/>
what to include.  I&#39;ve had some good ideas from some other <br/>
unschoolers in the area who suggested keeping a photo album and <br/>
collecting ticket stubs and play-bills of various events we attend, <br/>
and also including projects the kids might be working on.  I&#39;m <br/>
thinking I might like my son to create his own portfolio and have him <br/>
select what he is most proud of; we could keep these yearly <br/>
collections and see how his interests change and develop.  I&#39;m open <br/>
to other suggestions from those who&#39;ve been doing this already and <br/>
have more experience.  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137033978">Thanks for the prompt response, and this link was very helpful.  <br/>
We&#39;re expecting a baby in the beginning of July, so I&#39;m going to try <br/>
to compile everything I need before then, though I won&#39;t be <br/>
submitting it to the superintendent until August.  Knowing what <br/>
others are doing will help me not to go overboard in trying to <br/>
appease the educational authorities, as I&#39;ve been warned that new <br/>
homeschoolers can be overzealous.  This web-site has been a great <br/>
resource, by the way, and a way to feel not so alone in this path we <br/>
are choosing.<br/>

I was just cleaning out some old e-mail when I discovered that I had rudely<br/>
neglected to respond to your question!  I&#39;m in Columbus, more commonly known<br/>
around here for some odd reason as The Central Ohio Area (odd to me because<br/>
it&#39;s just pretty much Columbus and nothing else).  We have quite a few<br/>
unschoolers here and just formed a group for support.  I&#39;m not sure what the<br/>
unschooling population is like up north, but you may want to join<br/>
Unschoolers Network Ohio at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolersNetworkOhio/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolersNetworkOhio/</a> it&#39;s pretty low<br/>
volume, but may help you find nearby unschoolers.<br/>
