<div id="ygrps-yiv-153958576">&quot;. They don&#39;t have to drop one list to join another, or <br/>
abandon one website to read others. Telling them to pluck their <br/>
feathers out <br/>
and nurse their babies isn&#39;t going to work. But just pointing out <br/>
that they <br/>
DO have feathers and that we don&#39;t feed out babies worms doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to be <br/>
rude. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
I think that I can say what does not look like unschooling in a <br/>
polite as possible way and someone is going to get offended and leave <br/>
in a huff anyway.<br/>
I like that there are many ways of saying the same thing. There are <br/>
many wonderful voices here but some people aren&#39;t going to want to  <br/>
hear ANY of them.<br/>
So be it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my posts seem to be delayed by an entire day and get <br/>
interjected when my point is long past due or already discussed and <br/>
over with. It makes me look like an idiot that can&#39;t keep up with a <br/>
conversation. Hope it&#39;s just a temporary problem!!<br/>

Ren, who doesn&#39;t need any help looking more like an idiot....</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103360072">I guess I&#39;m confused here because I didn&#39;t put my two cents worth in until<br/>
there had been several posts describing what was being done--stopping what<br/>
they want to do, not allowing workbooks unsupervised, directing what they<br/>
are doing.  All of which spelled eclectic or relaxed homeschooling to me and<br/>
not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we never did get an answer about the ages of the kids which would have<br/>
some bearing on the discussion but not as to what was being done and not<br/>
done.<br/>
