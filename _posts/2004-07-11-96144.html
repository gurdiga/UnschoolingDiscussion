<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376234636">This is about the Pearls&#39; book so if you are not <br/>
interested delete now. I just thought some of you might like to <br/>
respond to <br/>
Amazon.com.  So here it goes:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you everyone for your thoughts and interest in working on the<br/>
Michael & Debi Pearl problem.  I have just finished their main <br/>
book, &quot;To<br/>
Train Up a Child.&quot;  It is the most evil, sickening book about<br/>
child-raising I have ever read.  And all justified with Proverbs <br/>
verses.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the book, the Pearls recommend whipping *infants* and young<br/>
children on their bare skin.  They do this for &quot;obedience training,&quot; <br/>
and<br/>
compare it to training a dog or mule to obtain &quot;instant, unquestioning<br/>
obedience.&quot;  They say ALL children need to be whipped with a &quot;rod.&quot;<br/>
They call babies &quot;tyrants&quot; &quot;terrorists&quot; &quot;whining, spoiled brats&quot; and<br/>
&quot;devious&quot;, with &quot;criminal minds.&quot;  According to the Pearls, babies are<br/>
determined to make parents&#39; lives &quot;as miserable as possible.&quot;  And the<br/>
Pearls decry the &quot;extraordinary ignorance of modern psychology.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This book is being sold at Amazon.com.  Amazon removed Home School<br/>
Digest after we complained; let&#39;s try to do the same with &quot;To Raise <br/>
Up a<br/>
Child!&quot;  Please take a moment to write a review of this book at:<br/>

Here are some talking points:<br/>
<br/>
1) The Pearls recommend whipping infants only a few months old on <br/>
their<br/>
bare skin.  They whip their own 4 month old (p.9).  They recommend<br/>
whipping the bare skin of &quot;every child&quot; (p.2) for &quot;Christians and<br/>
non-Christians&quot; (p.5) and for &quot;every transgression&quot; (p.1).  Parents <br/>
who<br/>
don&#39;t whip their babies into complete submission are portrayed as<br/>
indifferemt, lazy, careless and neglectful (p.19) and are &quot;creating a<br/>
Nazi&quot; (p.45).<br/>
<br/>
2) On p.60 they recommend whipping babies who cannot sleep and are<br/>
crying, and to never allow them &quot;to get up.&quot;  On p.61 they recommend<br/>
whipping a 12 month old girl for crying.  On p.79 they recommend<br/>
whipping a 7 month old for screaming.<br/>
<br/>
3) On p.65 co-author Debi Pearl whips the bare leg of a 15 month old <br/>
she<br/>
is babysitting, 10 separate times, for not playing with something she<br/>
tells him to play with.  On p.56 Debi Pearl hits a 2 your old so <br/>
hard &quot;a<br/>
karate chop like wheeze came from somewhere deep inside&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
4) On p.59 they recommend whipping a 3 year old until he is &quot;totally<br/>
broken.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
5) On p.44 they say not to let the child&#39;s crying while being hit to<br/>
&quot;cause you to lighten up on the intensity or duration of the <br/>
spanking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
6) On p.55 the Pearls say a mother should hit her child if he cries <br/>
for her.<br/>
<br/>
7) On p.80 they recommend giving a child having a tantrum &quot;a swift<br/>
*forceful* spanking.&quot;  On the same page they say to whip small <br/>
children<br/>
on their bare skin until they stop screaming.  &quot;Don&#39;t be bullied.  <br/>
Give<br/>
him more of the same.&quot;  They say to continue whipping until their <br/>
crying<br/>
turns into a &quot;wounded, submissive whimper.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
8) On p.46 the Pearls say that if a child does obey before being<br/>
whipped, whip them anyway.  And &quot;if you have to sit on him to spank <br/>
him,<br/>
then do not hesitate.  And hold him there until he is surrendered.<br/>
Prove that you are bigger, tougher.&quot;  &quot;Defeat him totally.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
9) On p.47 they recommend their various whips, including &quot;a belt or<br/>
larger tree branch&quot; to hit children.<br/>
<br/>
10) The Pearls also recommend ignoring an infant&#39;s bumped head when he<br/>
falls to the floor, and ignoring skinned knees (p.86).  They also say<br/>
&quot;if your child is roughed-up by peers, rejoice.&quot; (p.81)<br/>
<br/>
11) They recommend pulling a nursing infant&#39;s hair (p.7), tripping a<br/>
non-swimming toddler so she falls into deep water (p.67) and to make<br/>
children go hungry if they don&#39;t &quot;like what is on the table&quot; (p.103).<br/>
Also on p.103 they say that if children lose their shoes, &quot;let them go<br/>
without until they (the children) can make the money to buy more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Pearls&#39; methods have resulted in parents being investigated by <br/>
Child<br/>
Protective Services, and even a babysitter going to jail - see Amazon<br/>

Getting this horrid &quot;rod&quot; book off Amazon would be super, and send a<br/>
great message to those parents who might be tempted to try whipping<br/>
their babies into total submission!  People aren&#39;t even supposed to<br/>
treat their pets that way!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone!!<br/>
