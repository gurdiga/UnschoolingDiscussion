<div id="ygrps-yiv-192729162">HI Wynn and all -<br/>
I&#39;m a newbie to the list (joined when Elissa mentioned it on a local list - <br/>
Thanks!)....however, Wynn, a couple things jumped out at me in your post....<br/>
<br/>
Re: ideas.....it sounds like a &#39;whole family&#39; situation....it seems, from <br/>
your post, that you are the only one wrestling with &#39;what to do&#39;....if one <br/>
person is &#39;sleep deprived&#39; then, imo, that is a need to be expressed to the <br/>
family to gather other offerings of ideas/support/etc.....perhaps ds will <br/>
volunteer to be up....perhaps a rotation....perhaps dh can be flexible in his <br/>
schedule in a way that you cannot predict....perhaps just having everyone <br/>
know that you are struggling with this will give you the support you need....<br/>
<br/>
re: opinions:  THEORETICALLY, it is always ok to ask.....(I say theoretically <br/>
bec. I am aware that I get somewhat irked when I&#39;m overwhelmed with cleaning <br/>
up vomit and dd asks for someone to go get a crayon for her - MY own baggage, <br/>
I know but I don&#39;t handle it well necessarily - is that more than you needed <br/>
to know?!)  ANYWAY,  imo, ASK....always ASK.....express your needs, sorrows, <br/>
ideas and trust that they will be answered in SOME way.....<br/>
<br/>
perhaps the &#39;answer&#39; will be that you feel energized and overlook the clutter <br/>
for a time....perhaps dd will go to bed early one evening which allows you to <br/>
&#39;catch up&#39;....perhaps dh will make arrangements with the kids for a <br/>
day.....perhaps dd will get up early one day and then have that missing <br/>
nap....perhaps it is a time of quiet that you need but since that doesn&#39;t <br/>
feel &#39;responsible&#39; you say that it is the clutter that needs to be taken care <br/>
of (I once had dh take the kids out for the day and I sat on our swing <br/>
reading a book and fell asleep - I surely missed the boat on what I neede <br/>
when I planned that day of cleaning! - I tolerated the house and everything <br/>
so much &#39;better&#39; after being refreshed emotionally, physically, spiritually) <br/>
....perhaps you are presenting dh with an opportunity to support you and be <br/>
with his kids....perhaps a &#39;family cleaning time&#39; would be fun.....perhaps dh <br/>
and ds would surprise you with a clean house after sending you away to a spa <br/>
for the day....(ooh!  I like that one!!).......perhaps perhaps perhaps  etc <br/>
etc etc....<br/>
<br/>
my point is, don&#39;t have any ONE answer in mind - that can be disappointing <br/>
and frustrating....esp. if the answer you want is for someone else to do <br/>
something....however, DO propose your idea.....and see how it all comes <br/>
together....could be quite magical!<br/>
<br/>
and re: dd&#39;s crayon request....I thank her for the opportunity to go to the <br/>
edge (or beyond!) of my patience and trust that I can handle that edge more <br/>
lovingly next time....<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of that will be helpful!  <br/>
Jane<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312796554">Welcome Jane!!!<br/>
I am so excited that someone from my local unschooling list joined. We have<br/>
alot of &quot;relaxed homeschoolers&quot; on that list (some radical unschoolers too)<br/>
and I have decided to start opening my mouth more on unschooling. See, I&#39;m<br/>
recruiting too!!<br/>
I love your advice to not keep in mind only one solution. We had a family<br/>
discussion the other day (these are kind of new for us)<br/>
Joe had to do an electrical job the other night on the same night I got a<br/>
breastfeeding support call and was really needed. I couldn&#39;t bring the kids<br/>
(esp. Max 2 1/2) since this was a one day old baby. After quite a long<br/>
discussion, we determined that Max goes with dad, Emily with me (she knows<br/>
not to breathe all over the baby) and Emily got home in time to make her<br/>
cake all by herself. Everyone was happy! Wow!<br/>
I love having a democratic house!<br/>
Thanks to all of those on the list and the boards at unschooling.com for the<br/>
thought provoking discussions.<br/>
BTW, all my info is real also.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I guess I&#39;m lucky in that my dh feels its his responsibility to take out <br/>
the garbage. 2 times a week, it&#39;s usually out there on the street the night <br/>
before garbage day. On the days when it slips his mind because he is stressed <br/>
from work or something, I remember and take out the garbage for him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband SO feels it is his responsibility that when he was in Minneapolis <br/>
for over nearly four years (a six month contract extended, and extended, and <br/>
extended) he would call me Sunday night and remind me to put it out.  And the <br/>
couple of times he forgot, I would call him and say &quot;I put the trash out.&quot;  <br/>
And a couple of times I forgot, whether he called or not.  <br/>
<br/>
But when he&#39;s home, I&#39;ve only seen him forget once.  He was probably feverish <br/>
and delirious and didn&#39;t know what day it was. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You are exactly right and that is what my dd saw when she said &quot;was she like this when you were dating?&quot;  I guess I&#39;m upset because I have to ask at all but that is another story.  <br/>
<br/>
So since you are from Mars you saw this poor guy that misunderstood his demanding wife - exactly what my dh saw.  The other two women from Venus on this list commented that *their* husbands never have to be asked.<br/>

----------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take the boy&#39;s side on this one, but only because I&#39;ve read John Gray.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think just asking right out for what you want is a good policy<br/>
in general. There is a difference between, &quot;it sure would be nice if this<br/>
hallway was green&quot; and &quot;will you go buy some paint and make this hallway<br/>
green by next Wednesday?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when one of my daughters comes to me and says, &quot;I&#39;m thirsty&quot; I&#39;ll<br/>
say, &quot;Thanks for the update&quot; or &quot;Really? What do you think we should do<br/>
about that?&quot; and they&#39;ll roll their eyes and say, &quot;Could you please get me<br/>
some juice?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think women (many? most?) are bad at asking for what we need. I&#39;d prefer<br/>
my daughters be good at that.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I think men need work on being more intuitive about other people&#39;s<br/>
needs. Wally is better than he was, and he was never awful. If I had a<br/>
son... he&#39;d probably roll his eyes a lot. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

didn&#39;t see you making a request - you didn&#39;t ask.  &quot;in case you can get to<br/>
it&quot; Is an option to me. And my question is; is that because I am male? (from<br/>
Mars so to speak?)   What is the source of the misunderstanding? When I have<br/>
forgotten about the trash, my LTW simply states &quot;would you take out the<br/>
trash?&quot; and there is no misunderstanding.<br/>

I guess the problem *I* have is that I have to remind everyone to do their agreed upon jobs.  Sometimes I get a little frustrated and this time I took it out on dh.  Why would your LTW have to remind you to put the trash out?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Why would your LTW have to remind you to put the trash out? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because she was more aware of what day it was, or tried to put something in <br/>
that didn&#39;t fit?  <br/>
<br/>
One of our solutions was Get a Bigger Trashcan.  It was only half the issue <br/>
it had been before that!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not always sure what day it is.  My husband is always sure what day it <br/>
is, probably knows within fifteen minutes what time it is, how many days <br/>
until quarterly taxes are due, which day to mail each bill payment for the <br/>
best financial advantage, etc.  He lives in a web of schedule.<br/>
<br/>
I, though, know who was coughing at night and needs to be offered hot <br/>
chocolate by the fire, and that the dog&#39;s nervous because someone was playing <br/>
with fireworks in the alley and needs to be taken out there to investigate <br/>
the scene of the noisy crime, and that Kirby&#39;s sad because a friend forgot to <br/>
do something for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342916619">Pat, <br/>
Thanks for being so gracious with me. I was being dense, please accept my<br/>
apology. Now that I reread them, I didn&#39;t fully understand your posts.<br/>
That&#39;s what I (you?) get when I read the posts quickly at the office.<br/>
<br/>
You can add my name to the list of people who use their real names on the<br/>
internet.  I live in Covina California, which is a suburb of Los Angeles.<br/>
You can even show your husband a photo of me and my family in the photos<br/>
section of this list.    I&#39;ll bet he would be adverse to you posting a photo<br/>
so we all could get a clearer visual image of you and your family to go with<br/>
the one you describe in words here on the list...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being on this list,<br/>
-Dan Vilter<br/>
