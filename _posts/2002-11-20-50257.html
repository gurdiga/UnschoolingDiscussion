Ah, spelling, one of our favorite &quot;conventions,&quot; and a big piece of <br/>
class discrimination in this country, all instituted by the master <br/>
institution of power and control......SCHOOL!  When the founding <br/>
fathers, many of whom owned slaves, were writing our hallowed <br/>
Declaration of Independence and Constitution, spelling in this <br/>
country was quite happenstance.  If what one wrote was generally <br/>
understood by others then no one worried much about the spelling.  <br/>
But as &quot;schooling&quot; came into favor, specifically as the wealthy <br/>
created and supported their elitist schools, we began to see class <br/>
distinctions made regarding those who spelled one way and those who <br/>
spelled any other way; the King&#39;s or Queen&#39;s English, versus that of <br/>
the common man.  And thus the convention of spelling began to take on <br/>
its role as one of many class distinguishers, separators, of those <br/>
who were elite, better schooled, than the rest of the lower class <br/>
citizens of this country.  If anyone ever does any geneaological <br/>
research and reads early documents and records one quickly discovers <br/>
that even our cherished family names were spelled many different ways <br/>
not all that long ago in history.  <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I used to teach English and French, so I do <br/>
understand the importance of this convention for my child&#39;s future. <br/>
Thus I allowed her to IM and email and ICQ her friends starting at a <br/>
very young age, as long as she let me check her spelling when she did <br/>
this.  She quickly learned how to do this herself and has become <br/>
quite a good speller.  And she is now as fast to jump in, commenting <br/>
about someone&#39;s lack of intelligence based on their spelling, as <br/>
anyone else these days, much to my chagrin.  I have to remind her <br/>
that it isn&#39;t an intelligence factor, just a convention, though one <br/>
that is pretty important to lots of people, usually people who <br/>
control many powerful positions in our lives.  And grammar and <br/>
punctuation serve the same purpose in our bag of &quot;conventions.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I also worked with students and adults, including my husband, who <br/>
were born with hard-wiring glitches, like hubby&#39;s dyslexia, that <br/>
prevented him from reading and spelling well, and from doing some <br/>
pretty basic math, too.  He found it so frustrating as a child, when <br/>
no one had diagnosed his problem and no one offered any special help, <br/>
that he simply chose to not learn spelling, thus not to communicate <br/>
in writing any more than he had to, and not to do math, and he could <br/>
not really read well until he was 21.  He grew up and remains someone <br/>
who thinks of himself as stupid because of these early learning <br/>
failures; a very self-limiting way to grow up, in my opinion.  And <br/>
after struggling for many years on his own he finally figured out a <br/>
way to make words work in his brain at age 21, and has been reading <br/>
ever since.  But he chose to not catch up on spelling and math.  <br/>
<br/>
He is not stupid or ignorant.  And I suspect that there are many like <br/>
him in his generation and those older than him, older than me.  And <br/>
probably quite a few undiagnosed in the younger generations, too.  <br/>
But after being treated as a stupid though well-behaved, well-<br/>
mannered, quiet black boy all the way through school and life he has <br/>
paid a big price in utter and total lack of self-esteem, a price <br/>
exacted by all who pointed fingers at his failing the test of <br/>
our &quot;conventions&quot; and &quot;constructs.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I knew better immediatedly when I talked with him and recognized that <br/>
his verbal language skills and patterns were outstanding.  He had <br/>
good contextual and advanced vocabulary, excellent sentence <br/>
structure, but he could not write, could not spell, nor could he do <br/>
some pretty basic math, at all.  Yes, this has severely limited some <br/>
of his life choices.  But I still appreciate what is wonderful about <br/>
him.  Just as I am sure all of us hope that someone will appreciate <br/>
what is special about all our children as they grow into their <br/>
independent lives.<br/>
<br/>
In short, I guess we all have to ask what is really important.  Is it <br/>
what others think of us?  That we live our lives so that others think <br/>
highly of us?  So that we conform to all the current conventions?  Or <br/>
that we are true to ourselves?  And without self-esteem how can our <br/>
children ever find their own way?  I truly believe that was the <br/>
primary poison that has tainted the biggest portion of his life and <br/>
his life choices.  Understandable, but sad nonetheless; and also not <br/>
my job to fix!  But that doesn&#39;t get in the way of my love for him.  <br/>
I don&#39;t need a good speller on my arm to feel good about myself.<br/>
<br/>
I also remember one extraordinary lecturer in an Ed Psych class in <br/>
college who stood up on the table in the middle of the kiva as he <br/>
told us about his life.  He had struggled with reading and writing <br/>
and math all his life, was flunking out of school when the Korean <br/>
conflict came along and he managed to slip in under the wire and <br/>
enlisted.  To do so he had to study the test for several weeks and <br/>
memorize what he had to write to answer the questions correctly.  He <br/>
served and survived and took his G.I. Bill money to go to college, <br/>
getting himself in by the skin of his teeth.  He said he got through <br/>
one course at a time by going to the library and sitting there and <br/>
literally memorizing the books he had to read, copying every chapter, <br/>
every page, until he had memorized the information.  And he ended up <br/>
with a Ph. D. in Educational Psychology.  He was by far one of the <br/>
best lecturers I had in college, and one I will never forget.  So, <br/>
again, conventions do not determine intelligence, but may restrict <br/>
job opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that as self-directed educators, unschooling moms and dads, <br/>
that we will not burden our children with too much condemning baggage <br/>
about who is and who isn&#39;t intelligent based on these kinds of <br/>
conventions.  Conforming to spelling conventions is very helpful in <br/>
our modern information intense world, but does not indicate who has <br/>
the most brain power.  Plenty of people around the world, from many <br/>
different countries and cultures, who have never had the luxury of <br/>
all the educational options our children enjoy are very intelligent <br/>
people, despite their lack of educated conventions. <br/>
<br/>
I know your comments were not meant to be so serious, but it is a <br/>
subject very near and dear to me, so I just wanted to reply, hoping <br/>
that the glasses through which we view others, here and around the <br/>
globe, are not clouded by our own elitist conventions.  Thanks.<br/>

did not go to UNM.  The kiva I referred to was at Michigan State <br/>
University, and even in the mid-sixties when I was an undergrad <br/>
there, they called the auditoriums in several classroom buildings <br/>

<br/>
Since the convention of spelling is only one of many other <br/>
conventions, including punctuation and grammar, and all of these in <br/>
English are so complex that even the best writers today regularly <br/>
rely on dictionaries and handbooks, this convention didn&#39;t really <br/>
reach the general public until literacy and easy access to books <br/>
became common.  No, schools didn&#39;t invent this convention, just <br/>
promoted it handily.  As a former English teacher I don&#39;t condemn <br/>
this, just suggest that it&#39;s not such a good idea to judge people <br/>
based on their ability to spell or correctly use grammar and syntax, <br/>
especially in our most difficult language, American English.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;Villifying schools is creating a scapegoat for problems which <br/>
existed before public schools did.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And the problems you are referring to are?<br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&gt;Standard spelling IS important these days, and it&#39;s also more <br/>
accessible without school than it EVER has been, ever.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good dictionaries have been around for a long time.  And many, <br/>
including the likes of Abraham Lincoln, did not go to school to learn <br/>
to spell.  Yes, those who have computers usually have spellcheckers, <br/>
which can make spelling conventionally easier, but I often find that <br/>
these create as many problems as they solve.  Same with grammar <br/>
checkers.  Both of these can change the meaning of what someone is <br/>
trying to say if that person doesn&#39;t reference dictionaries and <br/>
handbooks to be sure they are using the right word the right way, and <br/>
that their grammar and syntax convey the intended meaning.  The goal <br/>
is to say what you want to say and have it read and interpreted the <br/>
way you intended it, which is difficult to do under the best of <br/>
circumstances, especially in English.   <br/>
<br/>
I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to discourage anyone from learning to <br/>
spell, to use a dictionary, and to understand and apply grammar and <br/>
syntax.  But I also would prefer that folks don&#39;t judge other people <br/>
based on those skills alone.  Calling someone names or commenting on <br/>
intelligence or lack of intelligence based on spelling skills is not <br/>
nice.  Just as our children have many talents, not all of them <br/>
recognized by government or formalized education, so too do many <br/>
people have wonderful knowledge to share with us, even if they don&#39;t <br/>
always follow recognized spelling and grammar conventions.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the IM &quot;languages&quot; that many teens use is wonderful, <br/>
very creative, and wouldn&#39;t want to discourage them from continuing <br/>
to create new ways to communicate using this medium.  But <br/>
conventional spelling still has its place.  I am not trying to <br/>
convince folks to abandon the conventions, just be more open to all <br/>
kinds of intelligence and not to be so quick to judge intelligence <br/>
based on spelling.  Many the great &quot;intelligent&quot; man, perhaps a <br/>
leader in his time, was supported on the page by a good secretary or <br/>
an editor who made the great man and his writing look good by <br/>
correcting all the conventions. <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever heard anyone say that, unless by &quot;a long <br/>
time&quot; you mean a hundred years or so.  <br/>
<br/>
From a pretty good summary of English language history:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The last major factor in the development of Modern English was the advent of <br/>
the printing press. William Caxton brought the printing press to England in <br/>
1476. Books became cheaper and as a result, literacy became more common. <br/>
Publishing for the masses became a profitable enterprise, and works in <br/>
English, as opposed to Latin, became more common. Finally, the printing press <br/>
brought standardization to English. The dialect of London, where most <br/>
publishing houses were located, became the standard. Spelling and grammar <br/>
became fixed, and the first English dictionary was published in 1604. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That dictionary wasn&#39;t extensive, and it wasn&#39;t widely available.  NO books <br/>
were widely available to poor people until fairly lately.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wordorigins.org/histeng.htm">http://www.wordorigins.org/histeng.htm</a><br/>
(source of above quote)<br/>
<br/>
The printing press quite predates government schools for poor kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=But I also would prefer that folks don&#39;t judge other people <br/>

intelligence or lack of intelligence based on spelling skills is not <br/>

<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s fine. <br/>
<br/>
But when an unschooler is criticized for being a slacker and (allegedly) not <br/>
caring whether their children learn to write or not, and if the person <br/>
presenting the criticism can&#39;t spell or write, THEN that can be a profound <br/>
irritation to the unschooler in question.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a quote from a local list (not my locale) today, saying those who don&#39;t <br/>
teach composition are violating state law.  Here&#39;s one quote:  <br/>
&quot; I am only sugesting knowlege of who one speeks to or what one speeks <br/>
about gives weight to consideration. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
And last night the superintendent of the Albuquerque Public Schools was on TV <br/>
saying he just wanted the kids to &quot;do good in school.&quot;  I don&#39;t think he <br/>
meant for them to perform selfless acts.  He meant &quot;do well.&quot;  Does that <br/>
matter?  Will it matter when people who respect him for his degrees and <br/>
criticize me for &quot;risking my children&#39;s future&quot; can&#39;t tell the difference?<br/>
<br/>
My husband wasn&#39;t a great speller years ago. He&#39;s gotten better, from <br/>
writing.  He used to think that whatever he knew at the end of high school <br/>
was what he was stuck with forever.  The fact that his learning continued and <br/>
even sped up after he was out of school helped him accept unschooling <br/>
immediately.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t razz our kids for misspellings, EVER.  But they have free access to <br/>
reading and writing opportunities and they ask for help when they want it, <br/>
and they learn more every single day.<br/>
<br/>
But school has never touched them directly and STILL they want to spell and <br/>
write in such a way that they won&#39;t be seen as kids, or as ignorant.  It&#39;s <br/>
not from shame or pressure (unless in small bits, like the time in an online <br/>
game when someone told Marty he wrote like a ten year old, and he said &quot;I AM <br/>
a ten year old!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would rather read good ideas with bad spelling than polished and well <br/>
punctuated nonsense.  But I can understand the frustration of those who must <br/>
read criticism of unschoolers written by those who are sure structure is the <br/>
only right way, but who can&#39;t themselves write standard English.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do you guys always go around making so many assumptions without <br/>
asking questions first?  Or did I just get lucky?  Where did I <br/>
say &quot;always&quot;?  And did I also say &quot;forever&quot;?  And how old was my <br/>
daughter when I was doing this?  And could there have been other <br/>
reasons that I wanted to: a) not invade her privacy without her <br/>
permission, and b) make sure that she was not corresponding with <br/>
anyone who, by my adult perception, might be an adult masquerading as <br/>
a child with malevolent intent?  And whose computer and internet was <br/>
she using at that time to do this?  And how did I make my living at <br/>
that time?  Was that computer something I required for my work?  <br/>
Don&#39;t know any of that, do you?  Might help to ask first and not go <br/>
jumping off that big old Assumption Overhang. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry that my definition of &quot;unschooling&quot; isn&#39;t exactly the same as <br/>
yours.  But then how could you know that, not knowing all the things <br/>
I have listed above?  Where&#39;s the oath I missed that says I can&#39;t <br/>
define the details of my own &quot;unschooling&quot; terms, that I have to <br/>
agree to a list of specific behavior that someone else decides is <br/>
right for my child?  Doesn&#39;t that then make it &quot;yourschoooling&quot; and <br/>
not &quot;unschooling&quot;?  And how would that differ from doing what the <br/>
government schools want?  <br/>
<br/>
And typos are readily distinguishable from most repeated spelling <br/>
errors.  Typos most often have to do with hitting keys near (above, <br/>
beside, below) the correct key.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it does make a difference.  It is wrong.  Period.  Not what I <br/>
said.  But then......what could I expect.  Let&#39;s not dally over truth <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, so now we have a list that declares reality by consensus.  &quot;The <br/>
emperor has new clothes!&quot;  Every single question I asked above is <br/>
relevant to what actually happened, not what you presume happened, <br/>
not what you chose to read between the lines, or by paraphrasing the <br/>
words.  But then I would not want to mess up someone&#39;s fantasy with <br/>
facts since facts don&#39;t seem to concern those who have been verbal on <br/>
this topic.  <br/>
<br/>
I will console myself on my 57th birthday from hell (gotta go print <br/>
out my solar return and see what the heck is going on!) with <br/>
something one of my profs in a writing class once told me:  &quot;The <br/>
minute the words spread themselves on the page and the symbols enter <br/>
another person&#39;s eyes they are no longer mine.  They belong to the <br/>
reader who will read into them exactly whatever he or she wants to <br/>
read. Never, or rarely does that come close to what was in my mind <br/>
when I wrote it.  That is the nature of reality and the linguistics <br/>
we use to describe that reality.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s something Tony Hillerman once said in a critique <br/>
group:  &quot;I always leave it up to my agent to try to sell the book, <br/>
and all the other rights, including the movie rights;  then I pray <br/>
that if someone does buy the movie rights they will never make the <br/>
movie because I know it will only remotely resemble what I wrote, <br/>
what the book was about.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you guys always go around making so many assumptions<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a safe assumption that people read what we write. If a number<br/>
of people respond as though we said something we didn&#39;t then it&#39;s reasonable<br/>
to figure out how they managed to interpret it &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; without asking questions first?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If people read something pretty straight forward, I think it&#39;s unreasonable<br/>
to expect them to question it&#39;s unwritten context before responding.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what you said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That being said, I used to teach English and French, so I do<br/>
&gt; understand the importance of this convention for my child&#39;s future.<br/>
&gt; Thus I allowed her to IM and email and ICQ her friends starting at a<br/>
&gt; very young age, as long as she let me check her spelling when she did<br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To paraphrase, to show how it&#39;s being interpreted: Because you feel using<br/>
standard spelling is important to your child&#39;s future you allow her to email<br/>
only if you check her spelling first. In other words, she can&#39;t email unless<br/>
her spelling is first checked.<br/>
<br/>
Posters can expect pretty strong reactions here to issues of controlling<br/>
children&#39;s decisions about themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I think in general conversation there&#39;s a presumption that we&#39;re good people<br/>
and if we say something that might sound wrong, that others are to assume<br/>
that we&#39;re trying to make a long story short and cutting out all the stuff<br/>
that would explain how we were right to do what we did. (And then they talk<br/>
about us behind our backs! &quot;Can you believe she said that??&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of people who don&#39;t make those assumptions here. Discussions<br/>
go beyond what we do to *why* we do them. There are no presumptions that<br/>
there are good reasons behind apparently nonunschooling, disrespectful of<br/>
children actions. *Everything* gets questioned so that people can understand<br/>
how unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are a whole lot of questions you didn&#39;t ask here so I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; going to assume anything, but your precise definition<br/>
&gt; of &quot;unschooling&quot; is...?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Tuck, but my definition of unschooling includes children making<br/>
decision for themselves in a supportive environment. (Taking development<br/>
into account. I wouldn&#39;t expect a 2 yo, for instance, to understand my<br/>
explanation that being hit by a car could kill them.) That means that I will<br/>
give my daughter information but trust her to make decisions for herself. I<br/>
will point out that in general adults care more about standard spelling than<br/>
kids. I will let her know I&#39;ll check spelling. She gets feedback about the<br/>
usefulness of standard spelling by trying to interpret others nonstandard<br/>
spelling and any comments or questions about something she&#39;s written. From<br/>
that she decides when she wants spelling checked and when to let it go.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And could there have been other<br/>
&gt; reasons that I wanted to: a) not invade her privacy without her<br/>
&gt; permission, and b) make sure that she was not corresponding with<br/>
&gt; anyone who, by my adult perception, might be an adult masquerading as<br/>
&gt; a child with malevolent intent?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Internet safety, privacy, treatment of other people&#39;s property are all<br/>
important but separate issues from allowing or not allowing emails before<br/>
spelling is checked.<br/>
<br/>
In the midst of a spelling discussion, prefacing a statement with how<br/>
important spelling is to a child&#39;s future, why would a statement about<br/>
checking spelling before allowing a child to email be about anything other<br/>
than assuring a child gets the importance of standard spelling?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The list&quot; (as though it were a single entity) gets accused of being nit<br/>
picky. But clarity is important, saying what we mean is important when we&#39;re<br/>
trying to help people understand unschooling. It&#39;s not a &quot;let&#39;s all share<br/>
what works for us and let each decide for herself what sounds good to her&quot;<br/>
kind of list. It&#39;s a &quot;understanding how freedom to live and learn can be put<br/>
into practice in real life&quot; kind of list. And that takes being clear about<br/>
why we do what we do and looking at things from many angles to see if we&#39;re<br/>
seeing things clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Anything that sounds like &quot;I think this is important and I&#39;m going to<br/>
control my child until she complies long enough to accept its importance&quot; is<br/>
going to get questioned about whether that&#39;s unschooling or not.<br/>

Well, Joyce, it&#39;s much more helpful to get the facts, ask questions <br/>
if you use your brain and recognize that there might be some things <br/>
here that you don&#39;t know, don&#39;t understand, and that applies to about <br/>
anything in life, before anyone jumps to conclusions about anything.  <br/>
Lacking facts your behavior, or anyone&#39;s behavior, that condemns <br/>
someone for not behaving exactly the way you think you would (though <br/>
how could you know since you didn&#39;t know the particulars of the <br/>
situation?) has nothing to do with philosophy.  That&#39;s ATTITUDE, in <br/>
the street sense of that word.  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&gt;Which means there&#39;s a limit to how perfectly we can communicate, <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s nothing we can do to minimize <br/>
misinterpretation. It means we can try to write as clearly as <br/>
possible, and avoid having people rely on good presumptions about us <br/>
to aid their interpretation of what we&#39;re saying.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is an e-list, Joyce, not my book.  Your e-list, or at least you <br/>
are moderator, as I understand it.  The medium is not one for which <br/>
one takes a long time to write, rewrite, rethin, revise, and rewrite <br/>
20 more times, as I do in all my journalistic and literary work.  <br/>
This is a spontaneous mode of communication.  And the best way to use <br/>
it is to never assume anything.  Ask questions about what you don&#39;t <br/>
know.  Ask first.  And keep asking until you get the answers.  <br/>
<br/>
Like, I am still waiting for that clearly spelled out set of <br/>
parameters that constitute &quot;acceptable&quot; unschooling here.  I am <br/>
asking again, and again, and again.  And I am not asking to be <br/>
condemned for what I chose to do with my daughter when she was 8 <br/>
years old (she&#39;s 15 now) in a very specific situation.  Neither is <br/>
anyone else who talks about what they did or are doing, I&#39;m sure. <br/>
People don&#39;t join lists to be condemned.  If I wasn&#39;t so certain of <br/>
what I was doing, hadn&#39;t done 7 years of successful &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
already, wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results, then I would be very <br/>
intimidated by this kind of vicious questioning about something so <br/>
totally nitpicky.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of being a thinking person is to read and listen and then to <br/>
realize what we don&#39;t know, what we need to know, and then to ask <br/>
questions to fill in some of those knowledge gaps.  If we don&#39;t, and <br/>
we instead jump to conclusions, especially when those conclusions <br/>
imply negativity or some kind of bad behavior on the part of the <br/>
person communicating, then we are only showing our own ignorance of <br/>
the limitations of language, especially in this specific written <br/>
language medium.<br/>
<br/>
Norma<br/>
&quot;But I don&#39;t have to know an answer. I don&#39;t feel frightened by not <br/>

having any purpose, which is the way it really is, as far as I can <br/>
tell, possibly. It doesn&#39;t frighten me.&quot;  - Richard Feynman </span></blockquote></div>

that on the web page?  Why does it say it&#39;s still an open list?  I am <br/>

list.  Sorry for invading your private club.  Be sure to put up <br/>
the &quot;closed to newcomers&quot; sign from now on.  I usually read those <br/>
things before I open the door.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Kelly, but when it&#39;s my busines computer and my income depends <br/>
on it, then I am the one who allows or disallows its use by anyone.  <br/>
Starting at age 10 my daughter had her own computer and has ever <br/>
since.  I don&#39;t oversee or supervise anything on it.  But my use of <br/>
the word allow had to do with using my computer, not whatever you all <br/>

<br/>
I think I can stand up for myself here or anywhere else just fine.  <br/>
Don&#39;t take to bullying much and won&#39;t hesitate to stand up to it.  <br/>
And if this is how you treat your children and their choices in life <br/>
then you have some gall calling yourselves &quot;unschoolers.&quot;<br/>

I hope today is closer to what you were hoping for.<br/>

It seems like you&#39;re hugely upset over this discussion.   <br/>
<br/>
***Thus I allowed her to IM and email and ICQ her friends starting at a<br/>

You said people assumed things about this without getting more<br/>
information.   I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.   People assumed you check your<br/>
daughters spelling because that&#39;s exactly what you said.   You seemed<br/>
angry that we didn&#39;t assume you were looking out for her safety, but<br/>
there was no reason for anyone to assume that.  You said  &quot;IM and email<br/>
and ICQ her friends&quot;.   We didn&#39;t  assume she needed to be protected from<br/>
friends.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very sorry you&#39;re having a bad day,   I feel for you.   But I really<br/>
don&#39;t think anyone responding to your post has been out of line, and I<br/>
think you might be overreacting. <br/>
<br/>
No one here can force you to unschool in any particular way.   If you&#39;re<br/>
not doing it the way others here are that&#39;s your own business.    There<br/>
are good and helpful ideas here if you want them, but no one can make you<br/>
take them.  You get to make up your own mind.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised by the intensity of your responses to people here, and I&#39;m<br/>
very sorry you&#39;re so upset.   I hope things are well with you and that<br/>
you can take away what you can use and put aside the rest for now. <br/>
No one here wants to hurt you.  This is just a discussion list.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to duck out of the way now, I can say something<br/>
inflammatory and draw attention away from you.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Probably all someone would have to say is Alan Rickman sucks, and WHAMO! <br/>
No more talk about Norma&#39;s spell checking.  <br/>

But really, unschooling is going to be discussed on this list.  That&#39;s<br/>
what it&#39;s for.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy belated birthday, Norma.<br/>

&gt; Like, I am still waiting for that clearly spelled out set of <br/>

&gt; condemned for what I chose to do with my daughter when she was 8 years<br/>
&gt; old (she&#39;s 15 now) in a very specific situation.  Neither is anyone<br/>
&gt; else who talks about what they did or are doing, I&#39;m sure. People<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t join lists to be condemned.  If I wasn&#39;t so certain of what I<br/>
&gt; was doing, hadn&#39;t done 7 years of successful &quot;unschooling&quot; already,<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results, then I would be very intimidated by<br/>
&gt; this kind of vicious questioning about something so totally nitpicky. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would seem to me that unschooling is letting your child decide <br/>
what they want to learn or not learn. Actually, thats a poor <br/>
definition considering that learning is part of life and happens all the <br/>
time and I don&#39;t *let* my child do anything, they decide for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
My 7yo sat down yesterday and did a  maths workpage that I had <br/>
printed off for him. He asked for a page of multiplications. I found <br/>
one on the net and printed it. I then helped him when he asked for <br/>
help. Thats Unschooling. The other two printed out cheats for <br/>
&#39;Grand Theft Auto&#39; and then proceeded to spend the entire day <br/>
trying thm out on the game. Thats unschooling too.<br/>
This morning the 7 yo asked me to do pages of &#39;A&#39;s&#39; written as dots <br/>
so he could learn to write the letter A...(if anyone knows where I <br/>
can find some of them on the web I&#39;d be grateful as I had to do <br/>
them by hand).<br/>
Helping your child with spelling or maths or physics or cooking or <br/>
knitting is all unschooling. It ceases to be unschooling when you <br/>
&#39;make&#39; or &#39;expect&#39; a child to do a certain thing.<br/>
I overheard a HS&#39;er telling her child that if he didn&#39;t learn to read by <br/>
the age of 10 then he was stupid and she&#39;d send him back to <br/>
school. She thought she was unschooling cos she let him choose <br/>
the books. But she wasn&#39;t as she was pressurising him to read.<br/>
<br/>
I think (and this is my opinion) that some people are afraid to &#39;let <br/>
go&#39; of the school attitude and therefore feel slightly threatened when <br/>
this is pointed out to them. Sometimes the critisism helps them <br/>
realise, other times they defensively hold on to their own <br/>
interpretation and find posts threatening or unpleasant even if they <br/>
are not meant to be.<br/>
<br/>
Ummm, I&#39;ve now forgotten the point I was trying to make and two of <br/>
my kids are fighting so I&#39;ll leave it there for wiser heads to tell me <br/>
what I meant :-)<br/>

<br/>
To argue just based on your knowledge of your life and it&#39;s reality<br/>

really pointless form of discussion.  It may *sound* reasonable, but<br/>
we&#39;ll just end up talking past each other.<br/>

People CAN get the wrong impression from what you write.  That doesn&#39;t<br/>
make them stupid OR insensitive.  Go back and look at what you said that<br/>
generated this response.<br/>

We&#39;re looking at your initial words.  You need to look at them, too, or<br/>
you will never understand what we are talking about.<br/>

20 more times, as I do in all my journalistic and literary work.  <br/>
This is a spontaneous mode of communication.  And the best way to use <br/>
it is to never assume anything.  Ask questions about what you don&#39;t <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378523460">**&quot;The list&quot; (as though it were a single entity) gets accused of being nit<br/>
picky. But clarity is important, saying what we mean is important when we&#39;re<br/>
trying to help people understand unschooling. It&#39;s not a &quot;let&#39;s all share<br/>
what works for us and let each decide for herself what sounds good to her&quot;<br/>
kind of list. It&#39;s a &quot;understanding how freedom to live and learn can be put<br/>
into practice in real life&quot; kind of list. And that takes being clear about<br/>
why we do what we do and looking at things from many angles to see if we&#39;re<br/>
seeing things clearly.**<br/>

Hey, Joyce!  I really like the clarity of this.<br/>

I would even recommend that you take from &quot;It&#39;s not a...&quot; to &quot;... put<br/>

the group description at yahoo groups.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Well, Joyce, it&#39;s much more helpful to get the facts, ask questions <br/>
if you use your brain .... has nothing to do with philosophy.  That&#39;s <br/>
ATTITUDE, in <br/>
the street sense of that word.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you save this a while you&#39;ll be ashamed that you suggested Joyce doesn&#39;t <br/>
use her brain.<br/>
<br/>
And the attitude is all yours.<br/>
<br/>
Part of REAL writing (as opposed to practice writing, like book reports for a <br/>
teacher) is taking responsibility for what you write.  When you write on a <br/>
list like this, it affects other people&#39;s lives.  People come here for ideas <br/>
about homeschooling, about parenting, about unschooling.  Your words have as <br/>
good an opportunity to help other people clarify their own beliefs as mine or <br/>
Joyce&#39;s or ANYONE&#39;s do.   If what you wrote was incomplete or unclear, then <br/>
explain further.<br/>
<br/>
Partial information which isn&#39;t marked partial will be considered a full <br/>
communication.  You wrote, and you hit send.  That&#39;s what people do dozens of <br/>
times a day here.  <br/>
<br/>
When my kids write something that doesn&#39;t work out and people have <br/>
interpreted it another way, they explain and apologize, instead of accusing <br/>
the other people of not thinking, or blaming the other people for not <br/>
assuming there was lots of other side information being saved back.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t teach them that either.  They see writing as an extension of <br/>
themselves.  They have never had &quot;practice writing,&quot; only real writing.   <br/>
