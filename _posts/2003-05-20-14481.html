How do you hang pictures in a round house? You don&#39;t!<br/>
Well, actually, there are a few inside vertical walls - not too many<br/>
though - and I guess we&#39;ll have to hang any pictures on those inside walls.<br/>
Also, the round walls are also made of cement (covered over in stucco), so<br/>
it&#39;d be pretty hard to put nails into the round wall anyway!<br/>
<br/>
We also have wanted to move for a few years already and what got us to want<br/>
it bad enough and do something about it was that we seemed to reach a point<br/>
where we couldn&#39;t take it living in our current house anymore. If we made a<br/>
list of pros and cons, there were too many cons - not enough pros! That&#39;s<br/>
what pushed us out of our comfort zone to start looking and here we are,<br/>
about to move. Everything happens in it&#39;s own time and you&#39;ll move when the<br/>
time is right for you. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885550239">A friend of mine lived in a two-story adobe house in Santa Fe.  My high <br/>
school chorus teacher, who was gay.  That only partly matters.   I was one of <br/>
the kids he didn&#39;t mind knowing.  His partner died the year after I <br/>
graduated, of cancer, just before Christmas break.  I was home from college <br/>
and helped them do a performance of Los Pastores, a local traditional <br/>
Christmas play, so I was hanging out with him that week, with rehearsals and <br/>
a performance.<br/>
<br/>
The house was bought with a GI loan (of the partner) and so when I was 17 and <br/>
18 I was learning what might happen when a longterm unmarried (duh) <br/>
homosexual couple faces the parents of the older, mortgage-holding partner <br/>
upon his death.  <br/>
<br/>
Sam did end up keeping the house.<br/>
<br/>
They were opera buffs, travelling to Seattle and Houston and Chicago for <br/>
operas in summer.  They had opera posters, framed and up, here and there.<br/>
<br/>
They had smaller photos, framed and on flat surfaces (window sills, little <br/>
tables).  <br/>
<br/>
Because the rooms had vigas (ceiling beams) some framed posters were hung <br/>
between beams with wire, up against the wall.  <br/>
<br/>
In the kitchen there were small paintings hung in vertical rows between <br/>
windows.  I think they were wired to screw-eyes, but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Their walls were vertical, just not flat, so the frames touched on the sides, <br/>
but not in the middle, so small ones didn&#39;t project out.   The circle was <br/>
fairly big, too, one big bedroom upstairs and three rooms downstairs.  So <br/>
internal walls of the downstairs rooms were flat.  There was a bathroom in <br/>
the middle, and the kitchen had one flat wall of that, and the living room <br/>
was a semi-circle, so had some flat wall.<br/>

When the subjects of &#39;behavior&#39; or &#39;strategies&#39; are the topic, then, <br/>
of course, summaries are not the way to have a discussion! But, for a <br/>
questions like, Where can I find paper dolls online, summaries are <br/>
wonderful for passing along the information in a way that saves <br/>
others so much time and provides such ease for filing that <br/>
information. One e-mail with 10 replies to where/what to find in <br/>
Paper Doll world.<br/>
<br/>
My example showed how all the answers come *with names attached* so <br/>
there would be no wondering who said what.<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, want to spend less time squinting at a screen -- still <br/>
haven&#39;t bought any reading glasses !) -- less deleting and sorting, <br/>
and more time for....uh, anything!<br/>
However, I am like the mom who said she *doesn&#39;t want to miss <br/>
anything* so I am doomed to spend much time with digests (which are <br/>
not easy to go through from my point of view).<br/>
<br/>
I think the techies are worth emulating this way. But as I understand <br/>
it, it&#39;s your list so you are the Maiden of the Wood ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you get some sleep.<br/>

PS, regarding round adobe homes<br/>
<br/>
I stayed on the Cycladic Greek island Santorini and there were no <br/>
right angles -- only curves because the builders carved the cave <br/>
dwellings out of the volcanic ash! ... then they paint them white. <br/>
they&#39;re charming. ...with enough flat planes for walls to hang <br/>
plenty. that was only one year ago....ahhhh. (Talk about unschooling, <br/>

weeks.)</div>

using the freebie Outlook Express, too, but it has enough ability to suit<br/>

<br/>
The answer to ALL those kinds of questions could be &quot;go to google.com and <br/>
look it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes it&#39;s people wanting specifically unschooler ideas, which are <br/>
usually better than the ideas of lowly commoners. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s NOT my list.  This one is my list.<br/>
You were talking about unschooling-dotcom.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier for me to read the lists, no matter how busy they are, by <br/>
straight e-mail.  That way you know as soon as someone has started quoting the whole <br/>
post they responded to and you can hit &quot;next.&quot;  AND each post is labelled <br/>
beautifully with the exception of those from people on digest, and theirs will <br/>
often say &quot;Digest #907939239874&quot; which means zip when deciding whether to read or <br/>
skip it.<br/>
<br/>
I wish there were no yahoo digests.<br/>
