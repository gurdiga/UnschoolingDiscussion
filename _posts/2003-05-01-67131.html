Alexandra Ripley?  It&#39;s a sequel to GWTH, but obviously not written by <br/>
Margaret Mitchell.  I, in my opinion, thought that she did a great job <br/>
using the same writing style and it made me love and admire Scarlett&#39;s <br/>
grit all the more.  :)<br/>

someone isn&#39;t wearing one under those kinds of dresses, and even on a <br/>
thin woman, it looks unsightly.<br/>

It&#39;s nice to know that I&#39;m not the only one that liked &quot;Scarlett&quot;. I thought I was the only one, no body I know was even willing to give the book a chance. But I love it. It has a happy ending...and I&#39;m a sucker for a happy ending.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the movie, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, long before I ever read the book, I sobed, I remember asking my mom then if there was a sequel so they could get back together, she told me there wasn&#39;t (this was way before &quot;Scarlett) I ran into my room and sobed my little heart out.<br/>
<br/>
I was the same way when I saw &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; I actually stood up and booed when she left the Phantom, it was just so wrong to me. I booed and cried and went home and rewrit the play, to my likeing. My family wasn&#39;t nearly as impressed with it as I was. Oh well, there is no acounting for taste. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Point taken.  However, she wasn&#39;t really wearing much of that type of <br/>
clothing once she ditched them... mostly the Irish peasant garb.  Either <br/>
way, I liked it.  Besides....the suffragette movement wasn&#39;t too long <br/>
after this book&#39;s period so why not?   ;)<br/>
