&lt;&lt; Ma said, No, Laura could only wear pink because her hair was brown<br/>
and <br/>
Mary had to wear blue because her hair was blond. What was THAT all<br/>
about? As <br/>
a <br/>
child, I always wondered &quot;What&#39;s the big deal? Why can&#39;t she wear<br/>
whatever <br/>
color she wants?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have nothing of value to add to this... I just found it interesting<br/>
that when I was a kid, the reverse was true - I had dark brown hair and<br/>
was always in blue, my sis had white-blonde hair and always wore pink or<br/>
red... Then there was our brother who had pumpkin orange hair - he wore<br/>
a lot of green.  <br/>
