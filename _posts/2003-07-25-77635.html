<div id="ygrps-yiv-926163559">&quot;Still exploring options for my family for next year, and was wondering -<br/>
do any of you find it &quot;necessary&quot; to make money on the side? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I work part time, mostly in the evenings and weekends while dh is home (if I have to do a day, he works his schedule around me and Trevor babysits occasionally when we overlap each other) at a cosmetic counter. Retail hours can stink sometimes, but being able to work evenings is awesome for our schedules.<br/>
I earn about $800 a month if I&#39;m doing 20 hours per week.<br/>
The benefits are what I love though!! I use really high quality skin care and makeup, and never pay for any of it. They give us free stuff at &quot;beauty school&quot;, during gift promotions and we get the damages (which are often perfect, but not able to be sold) and a certain amount to &quot;spend&quot; every four months online. <br/>
It&#39;s really a cushy job for the most part. I love doing makeovers...might go into freelancing next year if I don&#39;t get into massage therapy school..we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s been a great job for me the last two years. I&#39;ve really enjoyed it and it&#39;s helped our finances tremendously.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847385796">Hi,<br/>
I have to work. If I didn&#39;t, we&#39;d starve. We have a website; www.coyotescorner.com<br/>
 which we&#39;re rebuilding. We work powwows and we are working on establishing a wholesale company out of this. We started w/ four blankets, no car, no computer 5 years ago. Things have improved.<br/>
Brianna works in the company w/ me and she gets paid. She&#39;s designed the tri-fold we hand out and she prints the whole thing out on the printer. She&#39;s also in charge of the oils and other aromatherapy items.<br/>
She has chosen this.<br/>
<br/>
Our next website is the Frugal Environmentalist....that should be fun.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is we have to earn money - if we&#39;re very lucky, we get to work at what we love. I&#39;m very lucky!<br/>
Janis<br/>
