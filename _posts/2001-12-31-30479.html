<br/>
Soy is always better for you to eat then meat.  Hopefully you are eating <br/>
organic food as well.  As long as you are not eating say a pound of tofu a <br/>
day, I would not worry about it at all.  My family is complely vegan, my kids <br/>
since birth.  We eat only organic food on top of that.  When I was pregnant <br/>
with my youngest, all I ate or could eat, was tofu sandwiches.  I am <br/>
completely healthy and so is he.  Food is a tremendously big and important <br/>
topic with me and I would never do anything to hurt my kids.  Studies have a <br/>
way of saying what they want to say.  Trust me, stay with the change and <br/>
don&#39;t go back to eating meat.  Have a varied diet and there is nothing to <br/>
worry about.  Even if you ate as much tofu as I did when I was pregnant, <br/>
along with soy milk, you would be fine as I am and so is he.<br/>

GMO products.  All of the studies are being done on folks that use GMO,<br/>
pesticided, fertilized to timbuckto and back soybeans and there is no way to<br/>
tell if the problem is with the soy product itself or all the residues that<br/>
are in them.  Also, all the negatives have been coming out since the whole<br/>

if you were using processed soy, the tofu&#39;s or meat substitutes not to have<br/>
them more than three days a week and I can&#39;t recall the portion size, but<br/>
it was one of those things, do in moderation. I just read this, wish I could<br/>
recall where.  I think its really confusing for a lot of folks right now.  <br/>
Asian<br/>
cultures who use soy do not eat large quantities of tofu at a serving I think<br/>
that was the difference, we tend to overeat all our portions in the states.<br/>

I don&#39;t know very many practicioners in the Vegatest methodology in the <br/>
US. I know there&#39;s quite a few in Canada and a lot in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
Most of them are quite good at allergy (reaction) testing. Very few of <br/>
them can take the testing method beyond that.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever get the chance, pick up the book 21st Century Medicine, A <br/>
layman&#39;s guide to the medicine of the future by Dr. Julian N. Kenyon.<br/>
<br/>
Its from 1986, but the theorys on homotoxicology, dysbiosis, psyche and <br/>
Bio-electronic regulatory medicine are great.<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe you should try and get in touch with your body somehow and <br/>
find what it does want to eat.<br/>
<br/>
I know lots of green veggies, whey protein and meats are what I work best <br/>
on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87971613">Thanks for your reply Kolleen. I will try and find the book you recommended. I&#39;m always up for reading yet another medical/self-help book! <br/>
<br/>
Getting in touch with my body is easier said than done. Hunger, cravings and browsing through cook-books usually motivate my meal plans, but lately this method has found our diet lacking in excitement or enthusiam to eat. It also does not help that my lifetime vegetarian kids hate most vegetables and are so extremely picky about food. What&#39;s an unschooling vegetarian mom to do? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
