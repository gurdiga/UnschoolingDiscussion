You&#39;ll have years to get criticism.   Don&#39;t invite it now.<br/>

<br/>
It what?<br/>
Why is it coming up?<br/>
<br/>
By the time you have a child old enough to socialize with anyone outside your <br/>
own family, all of homeschooling will be several years more common and <br/>
everyone around you will have more experience with it.  And in those years you can <br/>
read lots about unschooling and the answers to all your basic questions will be <br/>
answered in dozens of ways.  Maybe you&#39;ll get a chance to attend an <br/>
unschooling conference and meet children of all ages, watch them, and talk with them.<br/>
<br/>
I think reading families&#39; typical days will give you lots to think about and <br/>
look forward to:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think until you are actually involved in homeschooling that it&#39;s hard to<br/>
imagine what it&#39;s like. Our brains are so full of the image of school that<br/>
it&#39;s hard to imagine what it&#39;s like without school. For instance it&#39;s hard<br/>
to imagine that if kids are in school that homeschooled kids have anyone to<br/>
be with. But reality is very different. There&#39;s a network of homeschoolers<br/>
out there who get together for social reasons and trips and classes. And in<br/>
fact, at least in the Boston area, there&#39;s almost too many activities to<br/>
choose from :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for being different ... it&#39;s really the schooled kids who are warped.<br/>
Once you&#39;re out of the system and see what natural life is like, you realize<br/>
how bizarre the social atmosphere is at school and how kids have to change<br/>
themselves to fit it. Because school is an expected part of life, we don&#39;t<br/>
look at it objectively. It just is the way it is. But if you were to go to<br/>
some natural tribe in South America and tell them that from now on all their<br/>
children would basically lead separate lives from each other and from their<br/>
parents, spending majority of their waking hours with just their age mates<br/>
and a stranger so that husband and wife could spend their days apart, what<br/>
would that look like? At what age would that seem like a normal, healthy<br/>
life to lead?<br/>
<br/>
But when family life is made whole again, kids get to live as biology<br/>
intended. They are lively and creative and happy and whole :-) Unschooled<br/>
kids get to grow up being the way adults spend a lot of energy (and therapy<br/>
and money on self-help books) trying to get back to. Unschooled kids don&#39;t<br/>
need to throw off the baggage of school and the warping messages of school<br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; to find out who they are and what they love and to give<br/>
themselves permission to pursue it because they&#39;ve been living it their<br/>
whole unschooled lives.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to see what unschooled kids are really like -- as opposed to<br/>
what you imagine -- is to attend an unschooling conference or get together<br/>
with an unschooling group. (I&#39;d stay away from the specifically Christian<br/>
homeschooling groups (though sometimes it&#39;s hard to tell right away since<br/>
they present themselves as homeschooling groups) because they tend to gather<br/>
rigid Christians and their goal for their kids is a Christian life and it&#39;s<br/>
not going to look adaptable.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123968754">All of my kids are far more  social than me, and I attended public school.  <br/>
Some of them are less than  others, but I just think that is part of who they <br/>
are and accept them.   They are all happy.  (I have 5 ages 6 to 16.)  <br/>
 <br/>
My kids have homeschooled  friends and *away* school friends, and the only <br/>
difference that I have noticed  socially in a general way is that the <br/>
homeschooled children seem to be more  comfortable with people of all ages and tend to <br/>
have more diverse  interests, while the public/private school friends usually <br/>
only want to  socialize with people their own age and tend to have more limited <br/>
 interests.  It might be less obvious that a home schooled child has friends  <br/>
if some of them are adults or much younger children.<br/>
 <br/>
I definitely think my  children, who tend to be introverted like myself, are <br/>
more comfortable with the  amount of friends that they have than if they went <br/>
to school.  There is so  much pressure in school to have friends, and a stigma <br/>
that something is wrong  with you if you don&#39;t have many, even if that is <br/>
your preference.  I am  glad that my kids are accepted everyday for who they are <br/>
and feel free to  socialize or not as they want.<br/>

<br/>
True.  I think it&#39;s important to listen to your children and meet whatever<br/>
need for friends they have, if you want homeschooling to be successful.  For<br/>
some of them that means, don&#39;t pressure them to meet new people because they<br/>
are satisfied with the one or two good friends they already have.  For<br/>
other&#39;s that means, take their need for more friends seriously, even if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t match your own, and go outside your comfort zone and get them into<br/>
situations where they can meet other kids with similar interests.  Some kids<br/>
seem to have a high need to be with friends more often.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When my oldest reached school age, and didn&#39;t go, I felt like she would need<br/>
a peer group to form wonderful childhood memories with, since she lacked<br/>
schoolmates and neighborhood friends.  (we live in the country.)  We joined<br/>
a group homeschoolers for a relaxed play group but my dd was very unhappy<br/>
and stressed being in the group. (other people couldn&#39;t see it, but I knew<br/>
she just wasn&#39;t herself there.) We tried a few other group activities and<br/>
she was never overly happy with them.  She just doesn&#39;t like group dynamics<br/>
very much.  Thankfully, it didn&#39;t take me too long to realize that she is<br/>
happiest just having one friend over at a time and having one or two good<br/>
friends, as apposed to a group of friends.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we dropped out of the group, I felt like I lost my argument for<br/>
socialization, because when we were in it, I could say, we have this great<br/>
group of homeschoolers and we get together regularly for socialization.  But<br/>
after thinking about it more, I just started pointing out that the most<br/>
rewarding relationships that I have in my life are the ones that are close<br/>
and meaningful.  I am not a group person myself.  I am not sure why I<br/>
thought that kids would be any different, other than that they are forced to<br/>
be in groups by going to school.  I do have some good memories of playing<br/>
with the kids in the neighborhood after school, but my best memories are the<br/>
ones of hanging out with close friends who had similar interests.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429353257">** What do you guys say to about socializing your kids? **<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling support groups are great, esp. if you find a group that <br/>
includes plenty of unschoolers. &lt;g&gt;  Last week I was the first one to <br/>
arrive at park day, and didn&#39;t leave until it was too dark to see the <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that kids at park day seem to get into deeper and more <br/>
satisfying play the longer they stay at the park.  They get enjoyment <br/>
out of park day that many kids can&#39;t get from just a school lunch hour.  <br/>
And there is a lot less screeching.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I had a play date at a homeschoolng friend&#39;s house and near <br/>
the end she was running the two older kids out for piano lessons and <br/>
then the two younger kids to gymnastics.  They had a pretty busy, <br/>
fulfilling day.<br/>
<br/>
If you google both &quot;socialization&quot; and &quot;homeschooling&quot; you&#39;ll find some <br/>
interesting essays.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  By &quot;socialization&quot; sometimes people mean &quot;having kids to play with&quot; <br/>
and others mean &quot;learning to conform to the group and become a pod <br/>
person&quot;. &lt;g&gt;  (The latter meaning doesn&#39;t appeal to me.  If people ask <br/>
you, you may need to pin them down on what they mean.  Playing with <br/>
other kids?  Standing in line?  Coping w. the numbing boredom of <br/>
school?  Acting cool?)</div>

over everyday and prefers long one on one kind of play.  but she doesn&#39;t<br/>
really have any friends.  the ones that she kind of has aren&#39;t very close<br/>
and they either go to school, live far away, or follow a strict home<br/>
curriculum.  she doesn&#39;t like the homeschool group stuff as it&#39;s very<br/>
structured and there are too many people and too many things going on at<br/>
once.  she&#39;s asked me to help her find a way to meet new kids, but i<br/>
don&#39;t have any suggestions.  honestly, i struggle with the same<br/>
thing...i&#39;d like to meet new people and make new friends, but i don&#39;t<br/>
know how to go about doing this.  we&#39;re both introverts who take a long<br/>
time to feel comfortable/warm up to new people, places, etc. and we live<br/>
in a pretty small town which doesn&#39;t make it any easier. :)<br/>
<br/>
then there&#39;s the issue of conflicting needs among siblings.  if i manage<br/>
to find something that my daughter&#39;s excited about, my son doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to go.  dh works and goes to school, so there&#39;s not a lot of time that he<br/>
could stay home with ds and i&#39;m running out of ideas.  and that&#39;s not<br/>
even remotely addressing my own needs!  i feel isolated and alone and<br/>
frustrated which really restricts my creativity as a mother.  add in the<br/>
dark, cold weather of the season which kicks my depression in and you&#39;ve<br/>
got a house full of grumpy folks.  <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m really struggling with trying to get everyone&#39;s needs met right now.<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions?<br/>

<br/>
The only times that Sarah (8) has had difficulty in<br/>
making friends has been in school, where her autistic<br/>
tendencies become more pronounced. In Girl Scouts,<br/>
AWANA (a Bible club), theatre, and around the<br/>
neighborhood and in church, Sarah has made friends<br/>
with no problems. The same for my son Logan, who is 4.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s not a big deal. She has plenty of time for<br/>
real life socialization. Having to consider everyone<br/>
in her classroom to be a friend even if they don&#39;t<br/>
treat her as a friend was more difficult for her than<br/>
being able to avoid the kids in the neighborhood who<br/>
don&#39;t like her and pick on her. In school, she<br/>
couldn&#39;t avoid them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355104385">Hi, Lila.  This is now my second response to these emails.  I hope I&#39;m just emailing you, here.  Congrats on being newly wed and I love the thought that you&#39;re already putting into your children&#39;s future!<br/>
<br/>
Socialization:  I&#39;m desperately seeking some relaxed homeschoolers/unschoolers in our area.  My closest homeschooling friend had just passed away after a courageous three year battle with Cancer.  We&#39;re still friends with her hubbie and children, who will continue to homeschool this year, but will probably start with the school system next year. As more and more people look at unschooling, I&#39;m sure there will be more and more opportunity for socialization, which, btw, is the last reason children go to school.  Remember the rules:  no talking, no passing notes, etc.  Socialization is only allowed at recess or a few precious moments within the classroom.  Recess time is not necessarily all positive socialization, either.  My son came home three different times with life-threatening concussion.  He was only in school that year from February until June.   Is it any wonder he&#39;s no longer in school?  The kid that hit him had a lot of problems and was mentally handicapped.  He was bigger than me at the time (grade six, my son was one of the smallest kids in his class), and his parents felt he could do no wrong.  Police had already completed an investigation into this child&#39;s behaviour and I thought all was well before allowing my son into that school.  I was wrong with a capital W.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re actually leaving now for socialization with my friend&#39;s family (funeral was just a week ago today), then some shopping and a hockey game.  Can&#39;t ever possibly need more socialization than what you get at a hockey game!  ;-)  Especially when you have a 15yo playing! lol!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m much help.  I do live in a very rural area, too.  Homeschoolers are hard enough to find, around here, as it is, never mind any that are relaxed enough to spend an afternoon socializing.  I am still hopeful to find someone in the area!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726802770">You may want to ask a question (or series of questions) back to those<br/>
who are concerned about your hypothetical children:<br/>
<br/>
What is the socialization they&#39;re worried about your future children<br/>
will be missing by not attending school?  <br/>
Being able to survive in an artificially competitive group of children<br/>
the same age?  Being placed based on age and not ability to either be<br/>
bored or stressed at keeping pace with &quot;normal&quot;?  Will they miss being<br/>
bullied/ignored/taunted?  Will they miss the chance to be bullies or<br/>
to taunt other children?  <br/>
<br/>
No, wait.<br/>
<br/>
All public school children are likeable and have equal chances of<br/>
playing sports and chairing in the band.  They all fit in, and<br/>
everyone likes them.  No public school child has trouble meeting new<br/>
people.  No public school child has a problem fitting in.   This is<br/>
due to being in school, not a difference in personality and<br/>
temperament, right?<br/>
<br/>
No.  Wait.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a specious argument.  There is no sense in addressing it as a<br/>
serious question, for you will only find yourself bolstering the false<br/>
premise it&#39;s based on.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are likeable, easy going, out going, and make friends<br/>
easily.  Some people aren&#39;t and don&#39;t.  It doesn&#39;t have a damn thing<br/>
to do with where they spend their days (though I will point out that<br/>
in the 7-8 hour school day, teachers punish those who &quot;socialize&quot;<br/>
because they aren&#39;t paying attention in class).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I would love to &quot;unschool&quot; my kids.  However, I&#39;m getting a lot of <br/>
&gt; criticism on the whole socialization issue.  Right now when people <br/>
&gt; ask me about it I just say that I will make sure my kids have <br/>
&gt; chances to be with their peers like playing a sport or instrument or <br/>
&gt; art class, what ever they want to do.  But then people tell me that <br/>
&gt; every person they have ever known that was homeschooled did not fit <br/>
&gt; in socially and they did not like them.  I&#39;m prepared for the fact <br/>
&gt; that our kids will be a little different fromt their peers (we are <br/>
&gt; non-Christian liberals in a Very Christian and conservative area), <br/>
&gt; but I do want them to be able to make friends and be likeable.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you guys say to about socializing your kids?  Do your <br/>
&gt; children have any trouble meeting new people and fitting in?  We <br/>
&gt; would love to hear some suggestions.  <br/>

imagine what it&#39;s like.  I mean, you can imagine, but once you give <br/>
birth and actually have the child it is such a life altering <br/>
experience; it goes way beyond what you can possibly imagine!<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest making friends with other pregnant women/families who <br/>
are due around the same time you are.  Cultivating friendships with <br/>
them now may very well lead to future playdates with your children.  <br/>
Perhaps you have a birthing group?  Or look into prenatal yoga <br/>
classes or prenatal swimming classes.  Those are great places to meet <br/>
people.  And, just maybe some of those families will end up <br/>
unschooling.  Lucky for me, my midwife is an unschooler!<br/>
<br/>
As far as the whole socialization thing. Ha!  We have so many social <br/>
events that we just can&#39;t keep up!  In fact, I look forward to those <br/>
down days when we just stay home.  And, my boys are only 3 and <br/>
17months!  ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am still hopeful to find someone in the area!  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m working on the same thing.  I have older kids (15 and 11).  We&#39;re in our <br/>
second year of unschooling after years of more traditional homeschooling.  It <br/>
is a huge Christian Homeschooling area and even the group the we used to be <br/>
involved with and who I once considered  inclusive thinks we are weird. Quite <br/>
honestly, I never quite fit in because of my liberal viewpoints and once I <br/>
discovered unschooling, I really didn&#39;t fit in.<br/>
<br/>
After outings where I was asked in an openly negative tone things like..&quot;Are <br/>
you still doing that unschooling thing?&#39;&quot;or a mom saying she unschools in the <br/>
same sentence as talking about math curriculum, I just quit hanging out with <br/>
them.  One woman in particular was so caustic and dominant in the group that I <br/>
found I didn&#39;t want her negative energy surrounding me or my children. I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to spend any time around people who disrespect their children in their <br/>
interactions with them or in their conversations about them or treat me with <br/>
disdain.<br/>
<br/>
I heard Elton John say in an interview the other day, &quot;I&#39;m 57 and I don&#39;t <br/>
feel like pussy footing around any more.&quot;  Not that he ever did but that&#39;s just <br/>
how I feel. <br/>
<br/>
  Some members of that group were not only a million miles from unschooling <br/>
but so obviously were more into controlling their children than enjoying and <br/>
honoring them.  I just don&#39;t want my children around it and I don&#39;t feel like <br/>
putting up with crap any more..:-) Right now that means we are doing most things <br/>
with just the three of us but we&#39;re all okay with that for now.<br/>
<br/>
 I  think it may be more difficult to find other unschoolers when your kids <br/>
are older.  Unschoolers are few and far between to begin with and beginning a <br/>
group just naturally will have much younger children. The answer seems to lie <br/>
in not so much looking for unschoolers (although I haven&#39;t given up) but <br/>
encouraging each of our interests and passions and meeting other chilren and adults <br/>
that share them.<br/>
<br/>
The times we are around other unschoolers are just the best and I try to <br/>
carry that energy and joy with me.  Last weekend, we drove 6 hours to a one day <br/>
unschooling conference and that should get us through a few weeks!  My 15 year <br/>
old keeps in touch through the internet with other unschoolers she met at <br/>
conferences and Not Back to School Camp.  She hangs out with public school and more <br/>
traditionally homeschooled kids some but I think her spirit is fed by her <br/>
contacts with other unschoolers.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907158139">I agree with these suggestions... My homeschool ed-u-ma-cation began at <br/>
La Leche League meetings [which somehow always went off topic to discuss <br/>
vax, circ, and homeschooling].  The families who accept my unschooling <br/>
ways the best are the ones I&#39;ve known since I&#39;ve had nurslings.  You <br/>
should spend lots of time reading everything you can get your hands on <br/>
by John Holt; read what we (as the unschooling community) have <br/>
contributed to sandra&#39;s pages at sandradodd.com/unschooling and at the <br/>
boards at unschooling.com.  Mothering magazine, though not about <br/>
unschooling, is the very best attachment parenting magazine, it&#39;s not <br/>

<br/>
I would definitely agree with you about ditching the caustic person.  <br/>
But a mom who just uses math curriculum and asks questions about <br/>
unschooling, even if they are uninformed questions, could be a possible <br/>
friend or source of friends for your kids.  (I&#39;m thinking they must get <br/>
done with their lessons earlier in the day than people doing a whole <br/>
curriculum.)<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that if I were surrounded by a large group of conservative <br/>
people (and if I were a Christian myself), I would try hosting playdates <br/>
(if they would come) or open-ended art exploration or science <br/>
exploration days.  I think that would be a way to find who are the most <br/>
flexible and kind-hearted people in the group, or at least who had the <br/>
most interesting kids.  I suspect (without much knowledge) that in a <br/>
fundamentalist HS group the strictest people might be the loudest, and <br/>
it might *seem* that everyone else toed the line all the time.  But I <br/>
think, in their hearts, there are some moms who are less adamant, less <br/>
doctrinaire, and maybe more meek who are more tolerant than the <br/>
party-line, or at least less bossy about it.   So I think friendships <br/>
may be possible with some of the less hard-line members of the group, <br/>
but they are probably hiding behind the hard-line members for fear of <br/>
stepping out of line and looking soft.  I think it would take time to <br/>
get to know them.  (Although, maybe you can know them right off the bat <br/>
based on how decently they treat their children within the essential <br/>
framework of childraising their church promotes.  Some clear differences <br/>
of sympathy should stand out pretty distinctly.  Or is it so consistent <br/>
that none of them seem nice to kids at all?)<br/>
<br/>
(And, if they won&#39;t let you in their group at all and won&#39;t speak to you <br/>
on the street, then what I&#39;m saying isn&#39;t any use.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293497492">Hi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group too.  I have two toddlers ds 4 and dd 3.  I am finding that we do not fit in with the local chistian homeschooling groups.  We do have a wonderful time doing our thing.  We meet people at the library, gymnastics, soccer, the museum, etc.  At this point I am not worrying about meeting other homeschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested Mothering mag. may I also suggest Life Learning magazine.  It has wonderful articles about parenting and learning.  It is child centered and really good.<br/>

  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Socializing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &gt; What do you guys say to about socializing your kids?  Do your<br/>
  &gt; &gt; children have any trouble meeting new people and fitting in?  We<br/>
  &gt; &gt; would love to hear some suggestions.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I think until you are actually involved in homeschooling that it&#39;s <br/>
  &gt; hard to<br/>
  &gt; imagine what it&#39;s like. <br/>
<br/>
  Likewise, I think until you actually have children, it&#39;s hard to <br/>
  imagine what it&#39;s like.  I mean, you can imagine, but once you give <br/>
  birth and actually have the child it is such a life altering <br/>
  experience; it goes way beyond what you can possibly imagine!<br/>
<br/>
  I would suggest making friends with other pregnant women/families who <br/>
  are due around the same time you are.  Cultivating friendships with <br/>
  them now may very well lead to future playdates with your children.  <br/>
  Perhaps you have a birthing group?  Or look into prenatal yoga <br/>
  classes or prenatal swimming classes.  Those are great places to meet <br/>
  people.  And, just maybe some of those families will end up <br/>
  unschooling.  Lucky for me, my midwife is an unschooler!<br/>
<br/>
  As far as the whole socialization thing. Ha!  We have so many social <br/>
  events that we just can&#39;t keep up!  In fact, I look forward to those <br/>
  down days when we just stay home.  And, my boys are only 3 and <br/>
  17months!  ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is probably true...<br/>
However, I must say that about half if not more of my three year <br/>
old&#39;s friends are already in preschool or some sort of regular day <br/>
care.  And, quite a few of my 17 month old&#39;s friends are in some sort <br/>
of regular day care. :-0<br/>
I guess, my overall message was that I think it is important to <br/>
cultivate friendships early on.  If you are lucky enough to find a <br/>
group of friends whose parenting/life philosophy is close to yours, <br/>
chances are you can all get along and socialize well even though you <br/>
all might not be unschoolers.  And, perhaps you would meet some <br/>
unschoolers along the way.  It seems like this would be more <br/>
beneficial if not, enjoyable, than &#39;grinning and bearing it&#39; in <br/>
larger, regular &#39;homeschooling&#39; groups that seem to be made up of <br/>
largely conservative right wingers.<br/>

<br/>
In my humble opinion, you would be even luckier to find a group of civilized<br/>
friends who do NOT share your &#39;parenting/life philosophy&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Chances are you would learn from each other and possibly come closer to (a)<br/>
a real understanding of things and (b) true wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Hanging around with people who are like you is a sure way to rigidize, get<br/>
in a rut and ossify. It is way more fun to entertain different ideas and<br/>
styles. As an adult,you can probably handle the diversity and stay<br/>
uncorrupted.<br/>
<br/>
With children, of course, there is a risk that they may be corrupted by<br/>
strange ways. It is your job as a parent to help them learn how to be<br/>
confront various ideas and pick the best ones for their own moral quivers.<br/>
That might be the most important job you have.<br/>
<br/>
As a nation and a culture,it seems to me we are all becoming too &#39;groupy&#39;<br/>
and seem to be having a difficult time talking to one another, let alone<br/>
understand the other. Don&#39;t let your children grow up that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although I agree that you can learn a lot from people who do NOT <br/>
share your &#39;parenting/life philosophy&#39; I don&#39;t think I would actively <br/>
seek them out because we are already surrounded by them!  We do not <br/>
live in a segregated commune *grin*.  I am more interested in people <br/>
who share my philosophy and feel like I can learn much more from them <br/>
on our path.  And even in this group of &#39;like minded&#39; there is so <br/>
much diversity.  We all have so many differences that we can&#39;t help <br/>
but learn from each other unless we have our blinders on.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I have traveled so far in understanding unschooling, <br/>
mindful parenting etc.  I wouldn&#39;t choose to regularly hang out with <br/>
a group who wasn&#39;t there yet.  I wouldn&#39;t choose to hang out with a <br/>
group who would &#39;bring me down&#39; or stray me off track just to have <br/>
exposure to something &#39;different&#39;.  Just because it&#39;s &#39;different&#39; <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s &#39;good&#39; or &#39;healthy&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, we certainly have lots of friends who are very <br/>
different from us, and we love hanging out with them- it&#39;s just when <br/>
it comes to making new friends, I&#39;m going to go out of my way to <br/>
arrange a playdate with someone more like me, than someone who&#39;s way <br/>
different.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s better to have  alot of little groups rather than one <br/>
big one.  What would that be like?  Consensus or conformity?  Also, I <br/>
don&#39;t think we have a problem talking to one another (blab, blab, <br/>
blab); however, I do feel like we have a difficult time really <br/>
listening to one another.<br/>

in strange ways! :-0<br/>

to (a)<br/>
a real understanding of things and (b) true wisdom.***<br/>
<br/>
In the twenty nine years before my son was born I never met one person<br/>
who wasn&#39;t spanked or otherwise punished by parents and among my friends<br/>
who had children there were no &quot;non spankers.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Every day of my life and my sons life the majority of the people we see<br/>
and talk to and socialize with people who don&#39;t share our views about<br/>
respectful parenting.   I don&#39;t need to seek them out, they are the<br/>
reality of my life. <br/>
<br/>
So, (a) *a real understanding of things*  is that some people think it&#39;s<br/>
ok to hit smaller defenseless people in their care and I don&#39;t.   I<br/>
understand I don&#39;t enjoy watching a child get hit, I understand I don&#39;t<br/>
enjoy watching my son&#39;s horror at seeing another person hit by his mom, I<br/>
understand my son doesn&#39;t benefit from seeing other people abused.  I<br/>
understand hitting someone to make them do what you want them to do is<br/>
vile. <br/>
<br/>
and *possibly come closer to  (b) true wisdom*   I get closer to true<br/>
wisdom when I spend my time with people who are smart and thoughtful and<br/>
loving enough to live respectfully with their kids. <br/>
<br/>
***It is way more fun to entertain different ideas and<br/>
styles. As an adult,you can probably handle the diversity and stay<br/>
uncorrupted.***<br/>
<br/>
It is not fun to see a child humiliated and shamed and hit, nor is it fun<br/>
to confront a parent over such matters nor is it fun to explain to your<br/>
child why a parent would choose to hit her own kid.   I don&#39;t consider<br/>
the hitting of children to be &quot;diversity&quot; I consider it to be abuse and<br/>
in the same way I don&#39;t choose to spend my time with guys who beat their<br/>
wives or kick their dogs or punch their elderly parents, I don&#39;t spend my<br/>
time with people who smack their kids.   <br/>
<br/>
***It is your job as a parent to help them learn how to be<br/>
confront various ideas and pick the best ones for their own moral<br/>
quivers.***<br/>
<br/>
My son doesn&#39;t have a &quot;moral quiver&quot; he is a moral person.   <br/>
<br/>
***As a nation and a culture, it seems to me we are all becoming too<br/>
&#39;groupy&#39;<br/>
and seem to be having a difficult time talking to one another, let alone<br/>
understand the other. Don&#39;t let your children grow up that way.***<br/>
<br/>
I think you don&#39;t have much experience with unschooled children if you<br/>
fear they might have a difficult time talking to others or understanding<br/>
differing points of view.   <br/>
