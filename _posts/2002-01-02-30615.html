<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993634810">Hi Kolleen,<br/>
<br/>
I do wonder with this PCOS  or insulin metabolizing difficulty,  which came<br/>
first,  the problem digesting it or the problem handling processed sugars<br/>
causing the body to have difficulty managing it (in a predisposed person).<br/>
Like the chicken and egg argument - make sense.<br/>
    So since I&#39;ve probably assumed I couldn&#39;t &quot;manage&quot; to live with all<br/>
organic foods and you&#39;ve peaked my interest.  Can you give me some idea<br/>
about the expense of living/eating oraganically?  I am &quot;organizationally<br/>
impaired&quot;....and we have a family of six.  Thinking about it overwhelms me!<br/>

&gt; &gt;I still go with the every - body&#39;s individual and has individual needs<br/>
&gt; &gt;in this area.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Susan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Agreed here Susan, to each and every body is its own barometer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If one has an insulin problem, then any kind of sugar, slow or fast<br/>
&gt; acting would be a detriment to the body.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;.sugar is sugar is sugar,  organic or not,<br/>
&gt; &gt;your body still reacts with the same hormones,  etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Refined sugar IS more addictive than honey or molasses or fruit sugar. If<br/>
&gt; there is evidence otherwise, I would welcome it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If one doesn&#39;t have an insulin problem, then the choice would be to go<br/>
&gt; towards the natural way, not the processed way. An insulin problem person<br/>
&gt; must limit more than just sugar. They need to limit fruit and other food<br/>
&gt; intake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In &quot;extended&quot; family, I am an organic household, so is one of my sisters.<br/>
&gt; My other two sisters are not. My niece is not. (she&#39;s just a few years<br/>
&gt; younger than I and has more children)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The organic families have choices for the kids, no limits. They will<br/>
&gt; invariably ask for something to &#39;eat&#39; when they are hungry. As opposed to<br/>
&gt; just go into the cabinet for a nosh when wanting *something*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The processed food families seem to have to limit their children, cajole<br/>
&gt; them to &#39;eat&#39; food and oversee their intake on their choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Establishing that none of the children spoken of have an insulin problem<br/>
&gt; (as of yet). I say that because processed sugar addictions is a<br/>
&gt; *possible* reason that a genetically disposed child would develop an<br/>
&gt; insulin problem (research is still being done, so no facts yet on this<br/>
&gt; issue).<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324616040">Something to think about - you don;t have to go all organic all at <br/>
once.  Read up on additives and what the various terms in the <br/>
ingredients lists mean and then start reading them religiously.  You <br/>
can eliminate the worst things first and work up from there.  <br/>
<br/>
This is how we work around here.  I had to start reading labels for <br/>
Wyndham because of his dye problem.  Now, even though we don&#39;t eat <br/>
all organic, I have eliminated a lot of chemical additives just by <br/>
comparing brands every time I shop.  I also started cooking from <br/>
scratch more.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945241933">Hi Cindy,<br/>
<br/>
I have been going crazy on allrecipes.com lately.  My kids and I came up with 2 weeks of menus, then I went to allrecipes and got the recipes, added them to the shopping list option and printed out my shopping list.  They have lots of sauce recipes you could use with noodles.  I bet most of them would freeze well so you could make ahead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898811882">If he absolutely has to have boxed noodle thingys, buy Annie&#39;s or one of the<br/>
other all natural or organic boxed noodle dishes.  There is also a whole<br/>
group, I&#39;ll have to check the name, of rice noodle dishes for those that are<br/>
doing the no wheat thing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on a new computer and the old computer is going into the shop and I<br/>
can&#39;t get to my links right now, however, there is a site that duplicates<br/>
recipes from famous restaurants and other things.  I found it doing a goggle<br/>
search.  I&#39;ll see if I can find it again.<br/>
