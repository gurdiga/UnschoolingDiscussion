<div id="ygrps-yiv-116038884">I am looking for some good ideas for playing in the snow.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
buying equiment-but I am determined to enjoy this winter with my daughter<br/>
(instead of holding my breath-waiting for it to be over.)  Here is what I<br/>
have thought of already-please let me know if you have any other good ideas:<br/>
<br/>
1)	skiing<br/>
2)	snowshoeing<br/>
3)	snow tubing & sleding<br/>
4)	shoveling snow (I found a child sized snow shovel)<br/>
5)	building snowpeople & forts<br/>
6)	snow painting<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas?  Help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095904243">We like to make igloo&#39;s when we have enough snow.  You can buy the<br/>
plastic rectangular thing for making snow blocks, but we cut the bottom<br/>
out of a gallon milk jug and use it.  You have to lop off the irregular<br/>
top when you slide your snow block out, but it works.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget ice skating! <br/>
And throwing snow balls at dad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273970702">Thanks!  Great idea!  The local ski resort is supposed to be building a<br/>
skating rink for next winter.  We can&#39;t wait!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38462672">---  I found snow painting in the Hearthsong catalog and that is <br/>
going to be our new thing this year!!  Sounds like fun.  They also <br/>
have a snowball maker and a block maker (used for making forts or <br/>
igloos).  They are made of plastic.  The fort maker is what caught my <br/>
attention.  We&#39;ll have to make a fort as well.]<br/>
