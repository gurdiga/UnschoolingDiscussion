while, then stopped that becasue she lost interest.  Tried playing a word <br/>

favorite game and once I realized she was playing to please me...stopped <br/>

:-p  ... actually, I had fun at the time.). The first place I heard of <br/>
John Holt was in a required sociology of education class. I still have <br/>
the book and having recently dug it out (after nearly 20 yrs) I was <br/>
quite surprised to see how much I had underlined and taken notes. Guess <br/>
I was an unschooler at heart, even then. :-)<br/>

<br/>
By using plain honest questions, like, &quot;In what way?&quot; or &quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Do you mean what do *I* think, or what does the guy who made this think?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The same way you would with an adult friend who had asked the question.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can give more than one answer.  As each of my kids asked &quot;who was the <br/>
first person on this planet?&quot; I said &quot;Lots of people believe God made Adam, <br/>
and then Eve, and they were the first people.  And other people beleive that <br/>
humans evolved gradually so there never was a clear first one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were pretty little so I didn&#39;t go into other cultures having other <br/>
creation myths. <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s most regular questions lately are why a word is spelled the way it <br/>
is.  So I tell her, if I know, what the history of the word is, or its root, <br/>
or its language of origin.  She&#39;s getting that Greek words have soft g&#39;s and <br/>
&quot;ph&quot; is going to be f--.   If she weren&#39;t curious, it wouldn&#39;t matter, but <br/>
she cares about things like that.<br/>
<br/>
When I answer a question, I try to give one extra piece of info.  If the kid <br/>
seems interested, the discussion continues, and if not, it doesn&#39;t.  But <br/>
that&#39;s no different from seeing a movie, pointing out that it&#39;s the same <br/>
director or actor or movie-score composer as another movie, and seeing <br/>
whether the discussion leaps there or doesn&#39;t.  And I do the same thing with <br/>
my husband and my friends.<br/>

thinking about this....just want to enjoy being with my children...I give up!<br/>

and we discussed John Holt and unschooling for about 5 minutes.  My <br/>

earn my ele. ed. degree, but in my heart know I can&#39;t go on.  I hate <br/>
every single minute of it.  I just want to be at home with my own <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708395171">The joys of student teaching. I hope you get a good co-operating <br/>
teacher. I loved teaching, but eventually got burned out by the system. <br/>
I always liked the kids, though. Kids respond to being treated with <br/>
respect by an adult and kids in public schools are often quite startled <br/>
to be treated that way -- think of the popular teachers - what is it <br/>
that makes them popular? I think that is the secret common factor - they <br/>
treat the students with respect. As an unschooler, you already know this <br/>
secret.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your teaching, and trust your own instincts, and don&#39;t let the <br/>
resident faculty room &quot;expert&quot; tell you what to do. :-)<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

earn my ele. ed. degree, but in my heart know I can&#39;t go on.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t work in public schools.<br/>
It worked in laboratory schools (where the kids&#39; parents were education <br/>
professors and suchlike) and in alternative (hippy) schools, but once a child <br/>
does NOT have the right to leave or to discuss the situation rationally, then <br/>
they feel stuck and they start being obstructional or totally uncooperative, <br/>
and so not only does it not work for them, they try to make sure it doesn&#39;t <br/>
work for other kids there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Next semester I am scheduled to be in a classroom in a public <br/>
school &quot;educating&quot; children. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The best you can do is be dazzling and sparkly and hope to catch the <br/>
attention of some kids.  And appeal to the natural leaders in the group.  If <br/>
&quot;cool&quot; kids think you&#39;re cool, four or six others will follow each of them.   <br/>
And say surprising things so they look up and their pulse rate increases.  <br/>
There&#39;s that kind of physical  receptiveness that needs to be happening.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, get used to the sad fact that for a general shapshot average:  if you <br/>
have 30 kids ten already know the material, ten don&#39;t care, don&#39;t WANT to <br/>
know and plan to ignore you, and there are ten who actually want to know.  So <br/>
play to those ten, trying to surprise and engage the other twenty, and 50 <br/>
minutes will pass in no time.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem right, but if you play to the edges, you lose more kids.<br/>
<br/>
And the more you can get activity happening in small groups, the more direct <br/>
and real the learning is.  But expect to have parents come and complain that <br/>
they didn&#39;t send their kids to school to be taught by other students.  <br/>
(They&#39;ll say that because they think teaching is the business of schools, <br/>
instead of considering that facilitatinglearning is the business of schools.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I just watched Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off and the teachers are <br/>
caricatures of teachers, but each and every bit was something I had seen <br/>
done, maybe just not all at once. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So watch that and don&#39;t be like that &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

Viewing of the video Cypher in the Snow will be the<br/>

mentioned questions again will be asked and<br/>
discussed at length. Students will deduct that in<br/>
addition to the basic needs of food, shelter and<br/>
clothing, there is a need for love. Love is an additional<br/>
need. Cypher died because he was not valued and<br/>
loved----the word cypher means, zero, nothing, void.<br/>
Some may deduce that. The story is titled Cypher in<br/>
the Snow, because the boy was a &quot;nothing&quot;. Following<br/>

&gt; Most of us have stories like that of kids in our heads already, and if we <br/>
