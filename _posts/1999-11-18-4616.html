<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627314453">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Can I ask a teensy-weensy favor? It would be MOST helpful to everyone,<br/>
particularly us poor saps on digest, if everyone would cut out everything<br/>
that is not of crucial importance in the paste of the<br/>
message-they-are-replying-to.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks have e-mail set up on auto-respond so it reposts ALL of the<br/>
message you&#39;re responding to (mine is set up that way, I have to manually<br/>
delete all the html drek and also the portions of messages that are not<br/>
important to my responses), including all the html paths, and then that<br/>
response plus the old response gets posted in someone&#39;s NEW response, and<br/>
before you know it the screen is covered with repeating messages contained<br/>
in ever-increasing &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; symbols which have the breeding propensities of<br/>
tribbles, and the new message is very difficult to find.<br/>
<br/>
All it takes is judicious use of the delete key to whack out all the parts<br/>
not crucial to your response and voila, the cyber-world is tidy once more.<br/>
Not to mention readable.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, from me and my eyeballs,<br/>
<br/>
