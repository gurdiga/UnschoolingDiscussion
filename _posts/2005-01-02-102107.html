<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013420125">Okay, so I&#39;m convinced - after reading about this card game for years now!<br/>
But, Amazon no longer carries it and their link to the company that does<br/>
(carefreeproducts.com) says they are out of stock. We&#39;re going on a trip,<br/>
my kids and a few other teens, and I thought it would be great to have a<br/>
new game.<br/>
Anyone know where I could find it?<br/>
Thanks and aloha,<br/>
