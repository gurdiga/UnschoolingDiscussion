<br/>
Just an idea; <br/>
<br/>
We were advised that since we live in a house and have no land for <br/>
live stock that we should consider guinea pigs. They have similar <br/>
lives to cows, pigs, sheep, ect. with the exception of their size.<br/>
<br/>
 It took us a year to commit, but we love them! We have three <br/>
brothers, one for each child. We get them out and handle and play <br/>
with them often. And the kids have learned a lot about what it takes <br/>
to care for live stock on a small scale. And since we handle them <br/>
often, they sleep on our laps and cuddle with us as well. <br/>
<br/>
If you have the yard space, you can make a rabbit proof fencing pen <br/>
that is a great place for them in nice weather. We have some friends <br/>
who keep them outside or in the garage year round, but we expanded <br/>
our cage into a larger area so they can be inside. <br/>
<br/>
All our pets think their people! We take commitments to our pets <br/>
very seriously. My hubby is very big on a clean house with no fur, <br/>
so with the dogs and cat we have to vacuum a lot. But the parakeet <br/>
we rescued has a big cage, the fish have a big tank and the piglets <br/>
have the guest room! We are buying land next January. We have <br/>
already heard jokes from friends about how many pets we might end up <br/>
with. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, when people come over to our house they see the two <br/>
small dogs and assume that&#39;s it. Then they&#39;ll hear the bird or <br/>
guinea pigs(they purr and squeak) and want to see all the pets! I <br/>
don&#39;t think we could handle anymore. And hubby is real big on the <br/>
house smelling clean as well, so reptiles are out for the most part. <br/>
But we live on the edge of a creek and rural area, so we get to see <br/>
our share of snakes, frogs, turtles, ducks, raccoons, and coyotes! <br/>
It great to observe them from the upstairs balcony late at night. <br/>
Last year we watched a baby skunk for over an hour while it <br/>
meandered around the field in the moonlight. I woke the kids up to <br/>
see it and they still mention it.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, whew, that was a ramble!<br/>
