&lt;&lt; so Candace how long  has this type of thing gone on in the past and does <br/>
the list owner/moderator intervene on? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh some threads go on a long time, but sometimes they are interesting to <br/>
watch. Usually they go on a long time when they are about explosive issues. I <br/>
do not mind seeing (reading) a good debate but it can get a bit tiresome if <br/>
it becomes less of a debate and more of an attack on someone&#39;s opinions, or <br/>
even worse, someone&#39;s life or lifestyle. Being an unschooling list I think <br/>
the moderator/owner feels that there is learning in everything and all is <br/>
unschooling. So looking at it that way it makes sense to let the debates go <br/>
on. I am not certain why Lynda said I like to play &quot;tag team.&quot; (Not even sure <br/>
what that is, we just play tag here.) Anyway, I have expressed opinions on <br/>
subjects in the past just not as often as some. I guess Lynda and I do not <br/>
agree too often. I try to have a live and let live attitude. I feel that I <br/>
have no right to tell others how to live their lives or tell them that what <br/>
they are doing is wrong. Lynda has not given me that same consideration. I no <br/>
longer feel free to express what is going on in our lives here unless I am in <br/>
the mood to defend it.<br/>
The majority of the time it is an interesting, fun list. Hang in there, till <br/>
a subject interests you. One will! <br/>
Have a fun day<br/>
