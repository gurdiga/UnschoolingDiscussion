<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526021464">&quot;It seems so hard not to wrap her in cotton wool. How have others dealt with <br/>
this? Heather is 12.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t give you good advice, I haven&#39;t figured this out myself yet. I just feel the fear and try to breathe through it, telling myself &quot;they are capable, they can handle this&quot; a lot.<br/>
My boys really like to walk up to the mall. It&#39;s not far, but we&#39;re right in town so there&#39;s a major intersection to cross. I suppose I&#39;ve seen too much in my life, kids hit, adults hit...my imagination gets carried away. I don&#39;t like it, but I try not to show my fear. They&#39;re really responsible, always calling if they aren&#39;t home at the time they previously planned. This week they walked up with another unschooling friend and I was supposed to pick them up since it would be dark. They tried to get through but after the line was busy they decided to walk. It&#39;s totally dark and there&#39;s a stretch that doesn&#39;t have street lights..yikes. I was a nervous wreck until they showed up.:)<br/>
Trevor&#39;s 14, I hope this gets better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986733325">I know what you mean! From the time I was 7 I was very much<br/>
independent - I walked everywhere by myself, sometimes for miles,<br/>
crossed streets, took buses, trains, subways, planned trips to the<br/>
movies that were 30 minutes by train and then another 30 minutes by<br/>
subway or bus. The Moscow Transit map was my best friend. I walked my<br/>
dog through the dark alleys every night, and she wasn&#39;t very<br/>
fearsome. But now I have a daughter who is almost 3. Seeing the<br/>
neighbour&#39;s 5 yr old playing by himself outside and walking out into<br/>
the street to get his ball... seeing the 8 yr olds riding their bikes<br/>
without adults there... the 12 yr olds out by themselves at the<br/>
mall... my mind simply boggles at the idea that one day my daughter<br/>
will go places without me going with her! <br/>
