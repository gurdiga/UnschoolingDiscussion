<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960587864">I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m a (formerly) reluctant Spongebob convert. I was against it<br/>
on principle, then realized I didn&#39;t know anything about it and decided to<br/>
watch. My sides hurt. The swearing episode is really funny. I like the<br/>
writing; it&#39;s clever and makes use of double meanings, etc. Then again, ds<br/>
watches Dragonball Z religiously, so we&#39;re not exactly the limiting types<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a problem with Boy Meets World. Even though the actors are good<br/>
and the writing is funny, it bugs me that these two kids get married right<br/>
out of high school. Bad sitcoms aren&#39;t limited to grownups, unfortunately.<br/>
If anyone knows anything redeeming about that show, let me know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512990647">I have yet to sit through an episode of this program, but as Brynn <br/>
mentioned above, I enjoy my husband and my kids laughing about it.<br/>
 <br/>
The show has also inspired my son to do something creative in shop <br/>
class. He was taking a series of classes on ceramics (he takes shop <br/>
and home economics classes at the local junior high school - they <br/>
have been really flexible about letting him do this without him <br/>
taking any other classes there) and he decided to make &quot;Gary&quot; the <br/>
snail from Spongebob.<br/>
 <br/>
He was really enthusiastic about the project and we proudly display <br/>
his object d&#39;art on the entertainment stand. Though, at first, I must <br/>
admit that I didn&#39;t understand why my son kept saying &quot;mew&quot; every <br/>
time he showed Gary to someone. <br/>
 <br/>
In answer to my question, he reenacted an episode where Spongebob <br/>
throws a stick and Gary has to go and &quot;fetch.&quot; It takes most of the <br/>
episode for Gary to bring the stick back to Spongebob and then he <br/>
drops it at his feet and says &quot;Mew!&quot; A mixed up snail/dog/cat <br/>
creature. Like Brynn, I laughed myself silly as my son told me about <br/>
the show.<br/>
 <br/>
This subject reminds me about a TV inspired game that we play after <br/>
dinner some nights. It&#39;s called &quot;Name that Pokemon!&quot; It is a charades <br/>
game where each person has to get up and do the motions of a pokemon <br/>
character and the others have to guess which one it is.<br/>
 <br/>
The game has gotten to be a little tough for me in the last year, as <br/>
I haven&#39;t kept up with all the new critters, but I know enough from <br/>
when the show first came out (and the subsequent movies) to <br/>
participate. My best charade is Diglet, but I do a pretty mean <br/>
Psyduck as well.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for a fun thread.<br/>
