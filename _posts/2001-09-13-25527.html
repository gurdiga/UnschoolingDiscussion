<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576455366">Well, I don&#39;t care if a Communist lives in the Republic, as long as they let<br/>
others live without their choice. The couple of people I know who lived in a<br/>
commune ended up eventually having some sort of revelation, that hey, not<br/>
everyone has the same communal ideas, and some dictator type eases their way<br/>
into control. I am not saying that is happening to the communist on this<br/>
list(sorry, I forget you name), just what happened to people that I know.<br/>
Also, I am not sure if you live in the US.<br/>
As far as the reputation of the forefathers, well, to me who wrote the<br/>
constitution has nothing to do with its genius.<br/>
I am curious about an unschooling communist, because that sounds totally<br/>
contradictory to me. I  think of Communists as trying to make everything<br/>
fair for everyone-not saying that I am accurate-just going by the socialists<br/>
ideas in the US.  I don&#39;t understand the liberal view -of preventing someone<br/>
not to have what they want- if they are willing to take risks and live on<br/>
the edge and go for it. Who cares, if they want more stuff that equates more<br/>
headaches and responsibilities, let them live the way they want as long as<br/>
they are not hurting others or abusing the land.<br/>
