<div id="ygrps-yiv-26776538">Hello<br/>
My name is Naticia and if you had asked me about homeschooling before 9:00 am <br/>
on Wednesday, May 12, I would have told you that I think it&#39;s great (I even <br/>
have friends that homeschool) but it&#39;s not for me.  In fact, I had this very <br/>
conversation with another mom just down the hall from my son, Wesley&#39;s, 3rd <br/>
grade classroom.  She and I were discussing how much the school had &quot;gone <br/>
down hill&quot; since all the political changes at headquarters started 2 years <br/>
ago (they want better test scores by the year 2000).  And that because of <br/>
this test score thing homeschooling was looking like a good idea, but we <br/>
concluded that it wasn&#39;t for either one of us.<br/>
<br/>
As you can tell by the title of this post, I am forever changed as we (my <br/>
son, husband, and I) have decided to join the ranks of homeschoolers <br/>
(definitely leaning towards unschooling).  I am scared and I feel as though I <br/>
have taken a giant leap off a cliff and yet, I do not feel as though I am <br/>
falling (making the wrong decision).  If you&#39;re interested in my story I&#39;d <br/>
love to share it, but first I have a few questions:<br/>
<br/>
-It is my understanding that kids at this age (9) usually need 3-6 months <br/>
&quot;de-tox time&quot;.  Has anyone been through this?  What was your experience?  <br/>
What did you do with your child during this time?  How long did it take to <br/>
&quot;get your child back&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-Wesley is very good at math and he likes it a lot.  My concern is that he <br/>
has learned to add in an unusual way.  Instead of adding from the right and <br/>
carrying the numbers, he adds from the left.  He gets the answers right, but <br/>
I feel compelled to show him another way.  He is learning to multiply now and <br/>
you must work from the right when you multiply or the answer doesn&#39;t come out <br/>
right.  I am open to suggestions and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
-Wesley has a 2 year old sister (Very 2!).  I have heard that one of the most <br/>
difficult times to homeschool is with a toddler in the house.  What are your <br/>
experiences and how have you coped with having a toddler in the house?<br/>
<br/>
-How do you find/make time for yourself if you are with the kids all the <br/>
time.  I currently find it very challenging finding time just to pay the <br/>
bills let alone make time for myself without taking my daughter to someone <br/>
else&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, here is our story:<br/>
<br/>
I hated public school.  My parents put me into Kindergarten when I was 4 yo <br/>
because I was very verbal.  By 3rd grade I was reading at a middle school <br/>
level but couldn&#39;t get the math.  I repeated 3rd grade and felt like a <br/>
failure in general because of this experience.  Finally, when I was about 30 <br/>
yo I took a college algebra class and aced it.  My self esteem improved in <br/>
the math area but what a waste of 20 some odd years of self esteem.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s experience was very positive during the grade school years.  He <br/>
attended a magnet school much like the one we put Wes into before all the <br/>
political changes started happening.  After that he went into the regular <br/>
system and didn&#39;t like it very much.<br/>
<br/>
Because of our experiences my dh, Jeff and I found the most alternative grade <br/>
school in our school district and the most alternative teachers in that <br/>
school.  We wanted our son&#39;s school experience to be a positive one.<br/>
<br/>
I guess Wes started complaining 2 years ago.  With the birth of his sister he <br/>
said that he wanted to stay home.  I thought it was just because he wanted to <br/>
be home with us (I became a SAHM).  He had been in daycare since he was 2 1/2 <br/>
mo (no flames please).  We really needed the money. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think it started at the end of first grade.  Summer came and things <br/>
were better.  Second grade started and he complained every now and then but <br/>
nothing to cause alarm or maybe I was too absorbed in baby duties to notice.  <br/>
In October of his 3rd grade year I was in a car accident and so my otherwise <br/>
free time suddenly focused on getting treatment for my injurys.  All this <br/>
school year he has become more and more vocal about not wanting to go to <br/>
school.  He has also lost all interest in studying snakes and bugs like he <br/>
enjoyed in the past and he has become more obnoxious in general.  It&#39;s been a <br/>
challenging year for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday, May 12, I had a Dr. appt.  I had to drop Wes at school by 8:15, <br/>
drop Mara off at her baby-sitter&#39;s at 8:45 so I could make it to my appt. by <br/>
9:30.  Well, Wes complained that he wanted to come with me, I said no and to <br/>
make a long story short his teacher had to physically hold him to keep him <br/>
from running out of the building.  I took Mara to her baby-sitters and <br/>
canceled my appt.  I went back and took Wes out for &quot;coffee&quot;.  I asked him <br/>
what was happening for him and he asked me for a piece of paper and a pen.  I <br/>
obliged and he proceed to draw me pie charts to explain why he hated school <br/>
so much.<br/>
<br/>
Although I had my listening face on, in my mind my jaw had dropped to the <br/>
floor and I realized that something just didn&#39;t make sense.  Here is a nine <br/>
yo child telling me why he hates school using pie charts and fractions.  Math <br/>
and PE got whole pies because he really likes those subjects.  Art got only <br/>
1/8 of a pie.  I decided that this was a good time to go look at other <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
I called another elementary school that 2 moms had recommended to see if we <br/>
could come visit.  The receptionist said that we could but that it would be <br/>
better to wait until June because things would be more settled then.  <br/>
<br/>
I had heard about a place called the Home School Connections Center so I took <br/>
Wesley there.  We walked in the building and Wes stayed in the lobby stating <br/>
that he didn&#39;t want to be homeschooled.  I said &quot;Fine, you can stay out here <br/>
but I&#39;m going in cause I want to see what it&#39;s all about.&quot;  He stayed in the <br/>
lobby for a few minutes and then was enticed in by the woman who is in <br/>
charge.  She encouraged him to pick a computer game and have fun (he chose <br/>
Oregon Trail II).  Meanwhile, I went in and was introduced to an Unschooling <br/>
mom.  She encouraged me to read Dumbing Us Down, The Unschooling Handbook and <br/>
&quot;anything by Holt&quot;.  They invited me to their open house which was, by <br/>
chance, the next evening.  I went and was really excited by what they had to <br/>
offer.  The next morning Wesley told Jeff he wanted to be home schooled!<br/>
<br/>
For two weeks I read and visited Wesley&#39;s classroom a different time each <br/>
day.  I discovered that my son is basically bored and his teacher spends most <br/>
of her time doing crowd control over her class of 28.  Although I really like <br/>
his teacher&#39;s philosophy I believe she is not allowed to teach the way she <br/>
wants.  She has too many kids, no support, and mandates from up above to <br/>
improve test scores.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve made it this far, thank you for listening.  I am open to anything <br/>
anyone wants to share.  My biggest reason for not homeschooling in the past <br/>
was because I was afraid I&#39;d &quot;ruin&quot; my child.  After seeing and reading about <br/>
what&#39;s really going on I figure I can&#39;t do any worse than the public schools <br/>
so I&#39;m gonna give it my best shot!  So here I am a one week old convert who <br/>
has just taken a giant leap.  Feeling rather scared and peaceful at the same <br/>
time.<br/>

&gt;love to share it, but first I have a few questions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow that sounds about as fast as the decision we made with my son. He was<br/>
bugging me, but I didn&#39;t think he and I would survive, then one day things<br/>
got ugly at school he came home and told me he didn&#39;t want to ever go back<br/>
and out of frustration at hearing this for months I remarked &quot;Then don&#39;t&quot;<br/>
He never went back and I had some real quick decisions to make to get us<br/>
approved as it was still the school year and we didn&#39;t have the permission<br/>
yet, so until I got everything together he was considered truant.  I think<br/>
they finally took pity on me and didn&#39;t turn us in because there were only<br/>
really something like seven days left to the year and he hadn&#39;t missed much<br/>
school so he was marked absent.  <br/>
<br/>
We took those days (while his brother was still in school trying to decide<br/>
if this was for him too) to get to know each other. Granted we had to<br/>
figure out our objectives so it gave us time to talk about his past years<br/>
in school a little more level headed while we wrote these up.  We had<br/>
lunches together and took walks to clear our heads ... But we grew much<br/>
closer during this time which was the turning point here. I&#39;d suggest since<br/>
it&#39;s the end of the year anyway that you are starting. Take the summer to<br/>
heal as a family. Let the children suggest activities that they&#39;d missed<br/>
doing (if you are up to it) if it helps carry a notepad to jot down the<br/>
things that you&#39;ve discussed/done that would fit into the &quot;subject areas&quot;<br/>
if you were keeping track or had to for your district. That way you may<br/>
feel more comfortable with unschooling while at the same time you will all<br/>
be together learning about each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-It is my understanding that kids at this age (9) usually need 3-6 months <br/>
&gt;&quot;de-tox time&quot;.  Has anyone been through this?  What was your experience?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, mine was 10 and because of a horrible experience being labeled ADD and<br/>
being told he&#39;d never make it in the real world he had no self esteem.. It<br/>
took him the entire first year home and then a couple more months. But once<br/>
he found that he wasn&#39;t stupid he perked right up and has been so happy.<br/>
Hopefully it won&#39;t take that long for you. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What did you do with your child during this time?  How long did it take to <br/>
&gt;&quot;get your child back&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have my son back, both of them actually. It didn&#39;t take as long with my<br/>
oldest as he was an honor student so the self esteem issues were different<br/>
than his brothers.  What did we do?  Well when Sept hit we tried school at<br/>
home, with workbooks and stuff. But by nov we were unschooling. so my time<br/>
was the summer vacation where we simply talked about what they wanted out<br/>
of our &quot;school year&quot;. For my youngest who was 10, we simply knew we needed<br/>
a hands on approach for him to learn, but finding the right approach that<br/>
he would feel he was learning something without it being school or<br/>
something that he hated.  My oldest finally started spending time with his<br/>
brother and learning that he really did like him. They spent hours in the<br/>
woods by our home tracking animals and drawing the prints they found to<br/>
keep a diary of, we started going bowling together a couple times a month<br/>
with hsers, we took lots of walks.  the downside in the beginning was that<br/>
they were obsessed with tv and video games. I thought I was going to lose<br/>
it with the tv, but that ended as soon as they realized that they were<br/>
bored. My oldest simply wanted to have the time to watch all the shows that<br/>
he couldn&#39;t while in school, but then realized that to follow all these you<br/>
couldn&#39;t have a life. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s turned the tv on since Thurs.<br/>
night when we rented a movie. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;right.  I am open to suggestions and ideas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let him have a calculator to check what he does. Actually my oldest says<br/>
that he sees the math in his head so what he shows on paper is completely<br/>
confusing to me. I don&#39;t even try to figure it out, it works for him and<br/>
that seems to be all that matters.  If your son asks for help, then you can<br/>
show him the steps, but he might be on to something.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;difficult times to homeschool is with a toddler in the house.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have a toddler, so I can&#39;t help much, but what do you do during<br/>
summer vacations?  I think that personally a toddler would only be a<br/>
hinderance if you were doing school at home where you needed the time to<br/>
sit at the table uninterrupted. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are your <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;experiences and how have you coped with having a toddler in the house?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When mine were small, (and before school) they spent a lot of time outside.<br/>
The younger one would play hours of basketball on the court so I&#39;d find a<br/>
seat and let him play. During that time my oldest could ride his bike<br/>
around where I could see or could have my attention. We read a lot while<br/>
the younger one, supposedly playing basketball, actually listened.  I<br/>
realized how much he was listening when last year I asked him if he wanted<br/>
me to read him Tom Sawyer as it was one of his brothers favorites. He told<br/>
me he remembered me reading it while he played basketball.  I didn&#39;t really<br/>
believe he remembered the story, but just to prove the point he told me the<br/>
story mostly in order letting me know all his favorite parts. BTW his<br/>
favorite part was how Tom convinced the others to whitewash the fence. He<br/>
did ask what whitewash was, but he knew the story.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-How do you find/make time for yourself if you are with the kids all the <br/>
&gt;time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s different at each stage. I&#39;m a single mother so I&#39;ve never had time<br/>
away. When they were little, they had bedtimes so that was my time, when<br/>
they came home from school they were older so they didn&#39;t want a bedtime,<br/>
now my time is when they go out to play as they don&#39;t need me to follow<br/>
them around.   You&#39;ll find your time, even if it&#39;s getting up a little<br/>
earlier for that one cup of tea before everyone wakes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I currently find it very challenging finding time just to pay the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bills let alone make time for myself without taking my daughter to someone <br/>
&gt;else&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your son could probably help pay the bills, my son loves putting together<br/>
the budget. He is a great help to me with that, and he never forgets any of<br/>
the little things that I tend to forget.<br/>

get more meaningful tome by myself now then i did with isaac in school. I<br/>
am relaxed now. we do something together and he plays or works on his own<br/>
too. I never thought i would say that. until hs he never even did anything<br/>
by himself.<br/>
<br/>
I also make sure i get time with tom and time alone even if it means<br/>
sacfificing a family nite sometimes.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are interested, here is our story:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wednesday, May 12, I had a Dr. appt.  I had to drop Wes at school by 8:15, <br/>
&gt;drop Mara off at her baby-sitter&#39;s at 8:45 so I could make it to my appt. by <br/>
&gt;9:30.  Well, Wes complained that he wanted to come with me, I said no and to <br/>
&gt;make a long story short his teacher had to physically hold him to keep him <br/>
&gt;from running out of the building.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would have been so hard for me too.<br/>
<br/>
 I took Mara to her baby-sitters and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;canceled my appt.  I went back and took Wes out for &quot;coffee&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
 I asked him <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;what was happening for him and he asked me for a piece of paper and a pen.<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;obliged and he proceed to draw me pie charts to explain why he hated school <br/>
&gt;so much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your son is so smart!  While there is no easy way to let sink in just how<br/>
unhappy a situation is for our child, Your son really gave this some<br/>
thought to make sure that he got his point across.  Not many 9 yo would<br/>
have thought of the pie charts.  Well at least you won&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about him being behind in math (sorry couldn&#39;t resist)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Math <br/>
&gt;and PE got whole pies because he really likes those subjects.  Art got only <br/>
&gt;1/8 of a pie. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you keep the pie charts?  These could be really helpful to you in<br/>
realizing just what he would like to do each day. My son also liked PE the<br/>
most in school. So we made sure to have lots of physical things spread out<br/>
through the week.  With art getting so little a section, maybe he just<br/>
needs to see real art.  My children hated art at school. Each year they<br/>
made ceramics. they hated ceramics by the time they left. I have so many<br/>
bowls I don&#39;t know what to do with them. That&#39;s all they made, bowls.  But<br/>
they saw me crocheting and asked me to show them how, they both did well<br/>
and enjoyed it. Cross stitching was harder and after asking, they decided<br/>
it wasn&#39;t for them. But we found that my youngest loves abstract art, so<br/>
we&#39;ve made sure to expose him to as much as possible. He also enjoys<br/>
creating comics and characters. He will come to us and ask us to give him a<br/>
crazy name, he will go off and make up a complete personality and a drawing<br/>
to go with it. We&#39;ve got entire sketch pads filled with these. So don&#39;t<br/>
worry too much about what he doesn&#39;t like now, he will refine those ideas<br/>
through the years.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My first sign that that wouldn&#39;t be the place for us. I don&#39;t like anyplace<br/>
that wants me to wait until things settle down more.<br/>

<br/>
 Although I really like <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;his teacher&#39;s philosophy I believe she is not allowed to teach the way she <br/>
&gt;wants.  She has too many kids, no support, and mandates from up above to <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you&#39;ve made it this far, thank you for listening.  I am open to anything <br/>
&gt;anyone wants to share.  My biggest reason for not homeschooling in the past <br/>
&gt;was because I was afraid I&#39;d &quot;ruin&quot; my child.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me I didn&#39;t know I could hs my children. Then I listened to<br/>
family/friends who reminded me that while I had my degree, I wasn&#39;t all<br/>
that good at math and wouldn&#39;t be able to teach them. I wish I would have<br/>
done it sooner, but then I think about the way this happened for us and<br/>
realized that while I can&#39;t change the past at least I listened to my<br/>
children and let them make the decision. Now at least I won&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about them coming back asking why I never let them go to school.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing and reading about <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;what&#39;s really going on I figure I can&#39;t do any worse than the public schools <br/>
&gt;so I&#39;m gonna give it my best shot! <br/>

importantly you are listening to your son.<br/>

conventions for adding, etc., are just that--conventions. I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
interfere if he&#39;s not having trouble. He sounds like he understands how the<br/>
numbers really work, what really happens with carrying, for instance, which<br/>
puts him well ahead of an awful lot of people who add conventionally but<br/>
don&#39;t really understand what they&#39;re doing and why it works.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As long as you&#39;re not trying to replicate school at home, it&#39;s no harder to<br/>
homeschool with a toddler than it is to live with one, which may or may not<br/>
be reassuring! I have a 2 yo right now, and was homeschooling when the now-6<br/>
yo was 2. He&#39;s into stuff, which means we have to be careful where we leave<br/>
important or easily wrecked projects. He likes to do what the big kids are<br/>
doing, so I try to include him in whatever we&#39;re doing, only at his level.<br/>
And we take advantage of the fact that dh is around in the evening to corral<br/>
him while I&#39;m reading to the older kids, if he&#39;s disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -How do you find/make time for yourself if you are with the kids all the<br/>

&gt; else&#39;s house.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m one of those people who really craves alone time. I have three kids at<br/>
home, ages 10, 6, and 2. Frankly, having the older ones home makes life<br/>
easier for me, because a certain amount of the day the littlest is<br/>
entertained by the older ones. He also still naps, which is good down time<br/>
for me, unless the olders are wanting to do something special with me then.<br/>
I just grab the time I can--first thing in the a.m., many days; in the<br/>
afternoon during the littlest&#39;s nap time; whenever they&#39;re off playing<br/>
together. I don&#39;t spend the whole day intensely involved with my kids. They<br/>
spend a lot of every day at play--sometimes together, sometimes separately.<br/>
So I&#39;ve not found getting my time alone to be all that hard. Also, dh is<br/>
always willing if I need an evening out or a Saturday morning out or<br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter won&#39;t always be 2--it won&#39;t always be this way, promise.<br/>

&lt;&lt; -It is my understanding that kids at this age (9) usually need 3-6 months <br/>
&quot;de-tox time.&quot;  Has anyone been through this?  What was your experience?  <br/>
What did you do with your child during this time?  How long did it take to <br/>
&quot;get your child back&quot;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It takes at least a year sometimes several years.  This is what I&#39;ve read and <br/>
experienced.  My two oldest children (I have five) were in school until they <br/>
were 7 and 10.  We, like you, had them in a &quot;good&quot; private school.  We were <br/>
having problems with the school in various ways and my oldest (10 at the <br/>
time) wanted to be homeschooled.  We definitely unschool.  My children have <br/>
been out of school for three years and I think I&#39;ve had them back for 1 maybe <br/>
1 1/2 years.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; -Wesley has a 2 year old sister (Very 2!).  I have heard that one of the <br/>
most <br/>
difficult times to homeschool is with a toddler in the house.  What are your <br/>
experiences and how have you coped with having a toddler in the house? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have an 18 month old but she is just part of things.  The kids work <br/>
together on most things they do.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; -How do you find/make time for yourself if you are with the kids all the <br/>
time?  I currently find it very challenging finding time just to pay the <br/>
bills let alone make time for myself without taking my daughter to someone <br/>
else&#39;s house. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Boy, can I relate.  I do things, like bills and cleaning either early in the <br/>
morning or late at night.  Sometimes, although not often I will specifically <br/>
ask my older two to be in charge so I can run the checkbook or something.  I <br/>
only do that if it&#39;s necessary.  My husband and I go out one night a week.  I <br/>
also go out once a month with a group of friends.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; She encouraged me to read Dumbing Us Down, The Unschooling Handbook and <br/>
&quot;anything by Holt&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
These are great suggestions.  I would also recommend subscribing to Growing <br/>
Without Schooling and Home Education Magazine.  If there is a support group <br/>
in your area, find them.  You are doing the right thing.  You will not regret <br/>
this.  Good Luck!  Kimme</div>

In New Mexico you have thirty days from the establishment of a homeschool in <br/>
which to file the papers, so in New Mexico you can just say &quot;We&#39;re going to <br/>
homeschool&quot; and it&#39;s legal from then and for 30 days.   The school can do <br/>
whatever they would have done if you had moved out of state.<br/>
<br/>
People forget that in the U.S. you do not NEED the school&#39;s permission, or <br/>
the state&#39;s.  Unless you&#39;re on probation or on parole, you can start packing <br/>
right now and move to another state before the sun comes up tomorrow.  You <br/>
don&#39;t even *have* to tell the phone company or the utilities guys, if you&#39;re <br/>
willing to go in arears, or to make your payments and disconnects from afar.<br/>
<br/>
I hear people say &quot;The school wouldn&#39;t let me take my child out.&quot;  WHAT!?  <br/>
Who are they bluffin&#39;!? They can say &quot;We won&#39;t give you credit for this <br/>
semester if you take your child out,&quot; and that&#39;s probably what they mean <br/>
if/when they say &quot;can&#39;t,&quot; but once you start homeschooling you don&#39;t NEED <br/>
their stinkin&#39; &quot;credits.&quot;  <br/>

myself) figured out very early that adding from the left is much, Much<br/>
easier.  There are several books out now (I think one is called<br/>
&quot;Mathwizards&quot; which specifically recommends this approach.  Don&#39;t assume<br/>
that how he adds has anything necessarily to do with how he multiplies.<br/>
What counts (pardon the pun) is what works.<br/>
