 </span></blockquote>The default, I think, is that the post you&#39;re referring to comes  <br/>
after, but because lots of people are on digest, the courteous thing  <br/>
to do is to delete all the business below your own writing.<br/>
<br/>
I cut and paste the part I want to respond to and I try to remember  <br/>
to do -=-these little marks-=- around it because some people&#39;s e-mail  <br/>
programs or settings show the quote marked somehow and others  <br/>
don&#39;t.    What worked for a long time with e-mail was carret/karat/ <br/>
whatever-they&#39;re-called marks before and after, like pointy brackets,  <br/>
like French quotation marks— but because of HTML on yahoogroups ,  <br/>
those disappear.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, don&#39;t quote more than you need to, and don&#39;t append a  <br/>
whole post, and don&#39;t append a whole digest, if you can remember to  <br/>
edit it down.<br/>
<br/>
I like to leave the quote above what I write so that it reads more  <br/>
like a dialog, personally.  And if I&#39;m just adding my comments  <br/>
without it being to a particular line or paragraph, I don&#39;t put  <br/>
anything in at all.   Often I take out the who-wrote-what-and-when  <br/>
line, because it doesn&#39;t matter who wrote what, usually.  And  <br/>
sometimes someone else quoted another post, and if I cut from that it  <br/>
cites the wrong writer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
