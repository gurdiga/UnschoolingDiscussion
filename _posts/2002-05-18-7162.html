&lt;&lt; Oohh! Sandra!!!<br/>
BAN HIM!!! Have No Mercy!!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Joyce beat me to it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was spending the morning as I have spent many Saturday mornings of <br/>
late--taking Holly to &quot;school.&quot;  She&#39;s taking classes at John Robert Powers, <br/>
which is a kind of finishing school and acting thang tending toward modelling <br/>
and TV commercials.<br/>
<br/>
It is weird, and nothing I would have wanted when I was a kid, but a few <br/>
months ago we were cleaning the side yard and Holly walked out and said to <br/>
me, &quot;Mom, I would like to be in a TV commercial.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said I didn&#39;t know anything about that sort of thing, but I&#39;d keep my ear <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
I was working in that very same part of the yard one day when we got a call <br/>
saying someone had recommended Holly for an audition.  It turned out two <br/>
families had done so--both homeschooling families she knows, with kids she <br/>
has played make-believe and dress-up with.   So they knew her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I figured it was scammish and too weird, but her dad was a frustrated <br/>
actor/performer type of guy whose parents never supported him much.  And on <br/>
the other hand, Holly likes auditions.  She&#39;s gotten a couple of callbacks <br/>
for musicals, and tries out for things she doesn&#39;t even really want to be in <br/>
just because she enjoys the auditioning.  (Weird, I know--like she craves the <br/>
competition I&#39;m trying to avoid for her, at least she enjoys it in short and <br/>
optional bursts.)<br/>
<br/>
So this and that leads to her being in classes for a year, as of March.  <br/>
<br/>
And she has had incidents with two teachers who thought she should be reading <br/>
better.  But this morning I talked to the #2,  young, mother of an 18 month <br/>
old baby, teacher who had made Holly cry last week.  So I arranged for her to <br/>
have the packet I had made up for three others there, and she read it.  It <br/>
was a two page letter (which I might have posted here, I put most of it <br/>
somewhere in public, here or unschooling.com maybe), and a copy of the <br/>
inverview Emily Subler did with me in HEM a few years back, and copies of a <br/>
couple of recent columns about Holly.<br/>
<br/>
So the teacher was EFFUSIVELY apologetic, enthusiastic, wanted to know more <br/>
about it for her son, etc.  Cool!  <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I was out proselytizing while Joyce was bravely keeping this list <br/>
clean for unschoolers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My boys all ended up doing this when we were in Colorado. The oldest took<br/>
the classes and was in TV commercials and various print ads. The other two<br/>
were recruited from being on set with their brother and ended up doing<br/>
almost as much work without taking the classes (well the youngest was only<br/>
18 months so it would have been tricky).<br/>
One funny shoot was for one of the largest sunday school curriculum<br/>
producers. All 3 of mine were figured prominently throughout with the very<br/>
schooly christian material. Pretty interesting for pagan/UU unschoolers:)<br/>
But you don&#39;t get to know what it&#39;s going to be before the shoot.<br/>
<br/>
It works in your favor as homeschooling because you have the flexiblity to<br/>
make shoots during the day when other kids can&#39;t. They also often want moms.<br/>
<br/>
Mine still have very good savings accounts from it and good memories.<br/>
Watching all the things that goes into making a commercial is interesting.<br/>

Holly&#39;s really enjoying the structure of it, the homework, the dress code.<br/>

Keith says he doesn&#39;t care if Holly never gets a single job.  He figures at <br/>
the very least it will make job interviews easier for her.  I agree.  It&#39;s a <br/>
fun human-factors lab for her too.  She&#39;s always been really analytical about <br/>
how and why people are.  She&#39;s unschooling more psychology than many people <br/>
get in college.  One of the most fun aspects of my relationship with Holly is <br/>
getting to be there for her questions and observations about why people do or <br/>
say or respond certain ways.  This is a goldmine for her!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
