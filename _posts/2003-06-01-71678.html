<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654108259">**EEEk Say it isn&#39;t so!!! Joanne Woodward is Newman&#39;s second wife. They<br/>
married in 1958, after he divorced his first wife of 9 years (Jackie<br/>
Witte), having had three children with her!!! <br/>
<br/>
 Hmmm, doesn&#39;t time soften the appearance of the past.**<br/>
<br/>
:) That&#39;s the whole lifetime of several of the people involved in this <br/>
discussion, which pretty much qualifies it as forever... even folks who care a lot <br/>
about the personal lives of movie stars might find it harder to be outraged <br/>

talked to them personally!!<br/>
I am surprised at the judgemental attitudes flying around at this list. We <br/>
don&#39;t know these celebrities, we know only what filters through the media. <br/>
Personal lives look a whole lot different up close (sometimes better, sometimes <br/>
worse).<br/>
I have no desire to go around judging what I really know nothing about.<br/>
<br/>
And to not watch/enjoy someones work based solely on whom they divorced? That <br/>
boggles the mind.<br/>
Would our own lives hold up to the scrutiny under which these famous folks <br/>
are put?<br/>
Seems crazy to me.<br/>

I so agree.  If you found out your house was designed or built by a womanizer <br/>
would you move out?  If you found that your car was designed by a politically <br/>
conservative engineer, would you sell it and get a different car?  <br/>
<br/>
Would you stop shopping where you get groceries if you learned the produce <br/>
manager was gay?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the difference when it comes to music or acting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well said Ren!!! Last time I checked I was perfect, but it was only <br/>
momentary. I was thinking about how I would feel if someone called my mother slimey. <br/>
She and my dad divorced when I was 12. She remarried when I was 14 and divorced <br/>
again when I was 15. Both times she suffered heartbreak, but from an outside <br/>
view, I guess someone could possibly presume she was slimey, but they&#39;d be <br/>
putting their lives at risk, cuz this baby bear would protect her mama bear. My <br/>
father on the other hand is slimey. He never cheated, he was just an ego-maniac, <br/>
and treated my mom like crap, hence I think he is slimey.<br/>
<br/>
Either way I learned a ton of things from both my mother the saint and my <br/>
father the slime. I learned who I wanted to be and what I would tolerate from <br/>
people. I don&#39;t take anything away my fathers high IQ, by reminding myself he&#39;s <br/>
slime. I think I&#39;m lucky I got some of his good traits and learned how to deter <br/>
from the bad. I know we never lived in a glass house thank goodness. <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents,<br/>

  I think the strain of being under such intense scrutiny would contribute greatly to many celebrities&#39; break ups. Imagine photographers following you everywhere and millions of people speculating on your motives all the time. I don&#39;t think I could cope with that.<br/>
<br/>
  Mark and I were watching Zoolander a couple of nights ago (love Ben Stiller-not doable but very funny!) and we got to the part where Derek, Hansel and Matilda got raunchy over tea. As they both began kissing her shoulders I thought how weird that was (Stiller and Taylor are married). Mark would beat anyone who attempted that with me. <br/>
<br/>
  I know it&#39;s acting but I wonder how hard that is for a couple who act. Could I support my husband in his career if it meant he was going to get naked with other women frequently? How insecure would I get? Couple that with endless magazines speculating further and I wonder how  any marriages in Hollywood survive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756628177">I once had to kiss a guy (in an independent film) that I despised!  I actually had to think about his beautiful little baby and how good of a father he seemed to be in order to fake it.  Even when you like the guy it is the least romantic environment in the world and after doing the same kiss take after take you are so ready for a toothbrush and a shower and a walk outside... O.K., I am still thinking about that disgusting little man.  I can&#39;t imagine it would be all that hard with say... Sting, Mel Gibson, Sam Elliott, Paul Newman.  You&#39;de never know I married someone four yrs. younger looking at that list.  This list would all smell like smoke too.  Good thing I don&#39;t get to try &#39;em out.<br/>
 <br/>
I do think all that loving on the set (though not glamourous or even always sexy) can be hard on a relationship.<br/>

Yeah, how many of us could start a relationship with a ton of people<br/>
watching and giving us directions?? I think too with stars that are put<br/>
together, sometimes it is the chemistry and sometimes I think it&#39;s just<br/>
being around someone you like and who is nice to you. I mean they have to<br/>
try and pretty much get along and it is a fantasy world being on the set and<br/>
I don&#39;t think these people really get to know each other until the movie<br/>
packs up. That&#39;s why the relationship usually fades so fast after the work<br/>
is done.<br/>
