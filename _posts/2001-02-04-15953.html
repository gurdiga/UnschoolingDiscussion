<div id="ygrps-yiv-178355145">Bobos in Paradise is a book that pokes fun at the way that so many people<br/>
in the northwest dress and drive as if they live in remote mountainous<br/>
areas when in reality they live in city or suburbs.  My friend from NYC<br/>
found it hilarious!  Of course, if you NEED 4-wheel drive or hiking<br/>
boots, that is a different story.<br/>
<br/>
After hearing about it for a couple of years, I finally bought Logical<br/>
Journey of the Zoombinis.  My kids and I love it.  It is fun to play and<br/>
has won two awards for best educational software.  While playing the<br/>
game, kids are using math and logic skills, but would not realize that<br/>
they are &quot;doing math&quot; unless someone told them.  I got in on e-toys.  It<br/>
is also in the February Scholastic Classroom catalog (our homeschool<br/>
group does this).  The only problem is that my kids are wanting to use<br/>
the computer more often.  I need to get them their own so I still have<br/>
time to use one myself!<br/>
<br/>
I am closely acquainted with a couple who adopted two children.  Within<br/>
weeks of the adoption being final, she filed for divorce.  10 years<br/>
later, this couple still cannot communicate civilly with each other and<br/>
the kids bear the brunt of poor parenting and a split household, not to<br/>
mention whatever long term affects the prenatal drug and alcohol abuse<br/>
will hold for them.  Putting children up for adoption does not guarantee<br/>
a better life for the child.<br/>
