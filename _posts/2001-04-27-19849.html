<div id="ygrps-yiv-902033003">A while back, this month, I think, someone posted an excerpt from To <br/>
Kill a Mockingbird. Would anyone remember what the date or Subject <br/>
line of the post was so I can look for it? Thanks. Juli</div>

OT -- Have you visited the message boards (not the list) at unschooling.com? <br/>
<br/>
I still go over there and read-but-not-post, and sometimes I actually think, <br/>
&quot;Wonder if Juli has seen this?&quot; I mean, I know that Tracy, Kerry, Mercy, <br/>
Sarieah (Amy, Cath, Jen?) did their time there. It can be a kinda scary place <br/>
(nobody waiting to ambush you here in the kingdom), but it&#39;s worth visiting <br/>
if only to read everything Joyce (Jfetterol) has ever posted. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if you are, like, &quot;Oh, duh, of course I&#39;ve been there, Laura.&quot; :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960015251">No, I&#39;ve never been to the message boards. Or, wait,<br/>
maybe I went once, just browsing around, when I first<br/>
discovered the site. But thanks, I&#39;ll have to go take<br/>
a look. And thanks for the info on the Mockingbird<br/>
post. I want to put it in my online homeschooling<br/>
diary, but I didn&#39;t want to take the trouble to type<br/>
it myself. ;) Juli<br/>
