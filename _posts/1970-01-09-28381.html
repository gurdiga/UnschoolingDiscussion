where support and resources were shared. Where are goals and dreams were<br/>
given a voice.  Those of us who have worked within the homeschooling<br/>
community for a long time have seen many changes over the years and right<br/>
now we are in a very difficult period.  So many people are fleeing a<br/>

lessons we have garnered over the years threatened to be overwhelmed by<br/>

know no matter what is said, no matter what the topic, the subject is going<br/>
to always come back to I did/I did not/Look what she said. It&#39;s simply<br/>
untenable.  It&#39;s ruining the sense of community I have spent helping to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875917020">Hi all,<br/>
I am a relative newcomer to this list - about 3-4 weeks now.<br/>
I have been mostly lurking, feeling I am benefitting more from <br/>
reading than asking. Other people usually ask the same question I <br/>
would have, anyway. And I always read everything, never blindly <br/>
delete.<br/>
<br/>
I am so profoundly saddened by what I have seen transpire in the past <br/>
few days on this list. That&#39;s all I will say about that. I feel way <br/>
too much has been said already.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that I want to say is thank you Lisa Bugg and Helen for <br/>
having the forsight to start both unschooling-dotcom and also <br/>
unschooling.com, even if it was long before I ever heard of <br/>
unschooling. I appreciate these forums so much. Sandra and so many <br/>
others have helped me become a better person and a better mother. I <br/>
doubt if these changes would have happened if I had not run across <br/>
unschooling.com shortly before 9-11. Since then, what a personal <br/>
journey it has been, for me and my family. I am grateful to you.<br/>
<br/>
There has been talk of un-subbing and the member count is noticeably <br/>
dropping now. But I will stay, and probably mostly lurk, for I still <br/>
have much learning (and unlearning) to do. I will also hope that <br/>
Sandra and others leaving will find it in their heart to come back, <br/>
for I will miss them.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652868453">I know this isnt an Attachment Parenting/Continuum Concept list (and I<br/>
plan to sign back up to one of those soon), but I suspect that there are a<br/>
fair number of unschoolers interested in those topics. So here goes.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days ago I sent off my Explanation As to Why I Cannot Arrange<br/>
for Alternate Care During My Period of Jury Service (this is the wording<br/>
from the form sent to me). Im pasting what I sent below.<br/>
<br/>
NYC recently (a few years ago, I think) did away with all the automatic<br/>
exemptions to jury duty. I dont know what the age was, but it used to be<br/>
that if you were the sole caregiver for a child under a certain age, that<br/>
s all you had to prove. Now they require an Explanation of some sort,<br/>
apparently even for the mother of a newborn. Our son will be about two<br/>
years, seven months old this Friday, which is when I would be required to<br/>
start calling in for jury duty (I would be on standby, listening to a<br/>
prerecorded message telling me whether to report or not).<br/>
<br/>
The advice a local La Leche League Leader gave me initially was to just say<br/>
that I was breastfeeding. But I dont feel thats my real reason. Even if we<br/>
werent breastfeeding now, I wouldnt feel right about leaving our son with<br/>
anybody for hours and hours on end. Besides, it has occurred to me that a<br/>
clerk could just say, Why dont you use a breastpump? I also thought that<br/>
breastfeeding a toddler is weird enough in this society that it might<br/>
not go over well. (But then again, attachment is weird, too.)<br/>
<br/>
As I wrote the explanation out, I was remembering some things John Holt said<br/>
about strategy in the original edition of Teach Your Own, which came out at<br/>
a time when the legal right to homeschool/unschool hadnt been defined or<br/>
debated much.<br/>
<br/>
He said that it was important to show that you were opting out of school<br/>
because of deeply held convictions (not because of a passing fancy or out of<br/>
laziness); that you would be willing to fight (in the courts) for your right<br/>
to do so; that letting you go ahead with it wasnt likely to open the<br/>
floodgates to overwhelming numbers of others wanting to do the same, but<br/>
that, at the same time, you would probably be able to find others to support<br/>
you in your fight (hence my listing of three books, and my choice to use the<br/>
term attachment parenting even though I have been inspired more directly<br/>
by Jean Liedloff, not Dr. Sears).<br/>
<br/>
John also said you should use certified mail (I did), and not talk much on<br/>
the phone so you can get it all in writing (I didnt put my phone number on<br/>
the Explanation, but its on the form I had to send in with it). Im going<br/>
to be interested to see how these tips work when its the court itself,<br/>
rather than the school district or whatever, that youre dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
On the bottom of the explanation, I handwrote the phrase, Note: This is not<br/>
part of an application for a postponement, but for a hardship/excuse. My<br/>
fear is not that Ill be denied anything, but that theyll find it<br/>
convenient to grant me a simple postponement.<br/>
<br/>
To apply for a postponement, you dont have to give any reasons or<br/>
explanations or proof. You just give a date from two to six months down the<br/>
road when you will be available. The catch is that you can only do this<br/>
once. So if I use up my right to postpone now, rather than getting a<br/>
hardship/excuse, I will have lost my opportunity to postpone for reasons<br/>
of my own convenience (work, vacation, etc.) We also hope to have more<br/>
children in the future, so I dont want to establish a pattern of being<br/>
willing to accept a postponement.<br/>
<br/>
Note that I didnt specify when I expect to be available, because it depends<br/>
on how our son develops emotionally, though I did refer to the age of three<br/>
as a common approximate age.<br/>
<br/>
This may all become moot if we move, as we hope to. (Im thirty-five, but<br/>
have never served on a jury before because Ive lived in twenty-six<br/>
different places, including nine years in Spain.)<br/>
<br/>
Under Postponements, the form I got said that you should assume youd been<br/>

under Hardships/Excuses, so I dont know what Im supposed to do if I don<br/>
t hear anything by Friday. I also dont know whom you can make an appeal to.<br/>
<br/>
The form says, Failure to appear may subject you to non-compliance<br/>
hearings.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Id appreciate any advice or constructive criticism. Heres the<br/>
Explanation:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY I CANNOT ARRANGE FOR ALTERNATE<br/>
 CARE DURING  MY PERIOD OF JURY SERVICE<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(SUBMITTED AS PART OF MY REQUEST FOR A HARDSHIP/EXCUSE) :<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I practice attachment parenting, as described in the<br/>
following books (among others):<br/>
<br/>
Attachment Parenting. Katie Allison Granju with Betsy Kennedy, R.N., M.S.N.<br/>
New York: Simon and Schuster, 1999.<br/>
<br/>
The Baby Book. Dr. William Sears, M.D., and Martha Sears, R.N. New York:<br/>
Little, Brown and Co., 1993.<br/>
<br/>
The Continuum Concept. Jean Liedloff. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1985.<br/>
First published: 1977. (This book does not refer to attachment parenting,<br/>
as the term was coined by Dr. Sears some years after its original<br/>
publication, but it advocates similar principles.)<br/>
<br/>
Attachment parenting requires (among other things) that the primary<br/>
caregiver/s, usually the mother, be continuously available to the child, day<br/>
and night, for approximately the first three years of life, depending on the<br/>
emotional development of the individual child.<br/>
The longest period of time our son has ever been apart from me (aside from<br/>
the several hours following his birth by emergency C-section) was for three<br/>
hours and thirty-five minutes, and this was as recently as November 14th,<br/>
when I attended a funeral which was a ten-minute walk away from the<br/>
alternate caregivers house. She (a close friend) was willing to bring my<br/>
son to me if he really needed me. (He didnt cry, but did ask for me several<br/>
times, and toward the end of this time needed to go out and sit on the front<br/>
steps to wait for me.)<br/>
The second-longest time my son has ever been apart from me in his life was<br/>
for one hour and fifteen minutes this past summer, when on his own<br/>
initiative he joined a group of children and one adult in going to the<br/>
playground across the street from where I was taking part in a meeting. He<br/>
was brought to me on his request at the end of this time.<br/>
The third-longest period of time he has ever been apart from me has been on<br/>
the several occasions when he went out for a walk of about an hour with his<br/>
father  on these occasions, he would have been brought to me sooner if he<br/>
had asked.<br/>
I understand this countrys need for jurors, but also understand that it<br/>
must be balanced against the rights of individual citizens to parent their<br/>
children in the way they see fit. I hope these specific descriptions of my<br/>
sons experiences to date will make clear to you that he is unusually<br/>
attached to his mother, compared to other children in this culture. I<br/>
believe that there are very few parents who would be able to honestly give<br/>
similar descriptions.<br/>
I know that many parents in this culture feel that it is good for a child<br/>
to be forcibly removed from the mothers care for hours at a time, from the<br/>
earliest age, and no matter how hard the child cries. My husband and I have<br/>
made a different choice.<br/>
We have expended an enormous amount of effort (and sacrificed my own<br/>
contribution to the family income) in order to assure our son this<br/>
continuity of care. We have done so for the reasons set forth in the three<br/>
books indicated above, and in accordance with parenting practices followed<br/>
until the historically recent past in this country, and still followed in<br/>
many other parts of the world (where both the child and adult populations,<br/>
perhaps not coincidentally, exhibit fewer psychological problems than is<br/>
true here).<br/>
I dont ask that anyone agree with us in our choice of parenting styles <br/>
only that this choice be respected until our son is capable of a longer<br/>
separation, and one in which he would not have the option of being brought<br/>
to me.<br/>
Thank you for your attention. If you need further information, please dont<br/>
hesitate to contact me in writing.<br/>
Enclosed is the completed and signed jury duty form, along with a copy of<br/>
our sons birth certificate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yours truly,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524610101">&lt;&lt;I&#39;ll leave, because it&#39;s pretty apparent that two<br/>
people have interest in little else than belittling<br/>
me.  If I&#39;m to be equated with them I&#39;d rather they<br/>
just have the whole deal.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish they were giving better unschooling advice<br/>
than they are.  I&#39;ll still be around, but I won&#39;t be<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I feel so sad that it&#39;s come to this. I got so much<br/>
from Sandra&#39;s posts. I just hope that I continue to<br/>
get as much from the others that have touched me (and<br/>
that they don&#39;t leave as well). I don&#39;t understand why<br/>
there is so much defensiveness on this list. Why can&#39;t<br/>
people just say what they believe/feel and if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t apply to your situation, just let it go. It<br/>
takes a lot of energy to hold anger in. It festers. I<br/>
joined this list a few weeks ago (just before the<br/>
sniping began) and I was so excited to be here. I have<br/>
now met another unschooler in my area, but I like to<br/>
come here for the stimulation and challenges. I find<br/>
my mind being given fodder for new ways of thinking<br/>
and growing and Sandra has been a big part of that<br/>
along with others here. I feel sad that I&#39;ve been here<br/>
such a short time and it feels as though a dynamic<br/>
that existed here before has been lost before I got a<br/>
chance to truly get to know it (that sentence is very<br/>
convoluted but I don&#39;t know how else to put it). I&#39;ll<br/>
see what happens with the list. Maybe now that<br/>
Sandra&#39;s gone the snipers will find someone else to<br/>
focus on or maybe they will have learned a valuable<br/>
life lesson. Let&#39;s hope and pray for the latter. I<br/>
would like to strongly recommend the &#39;mysto&#39; book that<br/>
Kathy B recommended in digest # 1612. It has changed<br/>
the way I perceive things tremendously.<br/>

<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, last month I was also notified for jury duty. I filled <br/>
out and returned the form with a request to be excused on the basis that I <br/>
had young children and no one to care for them. I had planned on calling the <br/>
courthouse the week of the trial to make sure that it was accepted but they <br/>
contacted me first, needing to know the children&#39;s ages. I said &quot;2 and 4&quot; and <br/>
she said &quot;Fine, you&#39;re excused from serving.&quot;I thought your response sounded <br/>
very well-thought-out....I hope it goes well for you!<br/>

the few people on this list who are either new at unschooling, and asking<br/>
questions, or those who have been doing it for years and who post helpful,<br/>
non-backbiting posts on a regular basis.  It just seems to me that the<br/>
vision of unschooling that Sandra presents is so clear - because she,<br/>

listening more and fighting with her less.<br/>

will be the grown up&quot;.  The answer to that question did not imply &quot;who will<br/>
leave the list&quot;.  There were a myriad of answers and responses to my<br/>
question.  One or two or three or more could have said:<br/>
<br/>
We will no longer rise to take the bait.<br/>
We will no longer read or respond to certain individuals.<br/>
We will no longer react when certain individuals repeatedly attack.  For if<br/>
there is to be no moderation of the lists, attacks are freely acceptable.<br/>

And I&#39;m sure that other can come up with other ways &quot;to be the grown up&quot;.<br/>

Sandra&#39;s response was to leave the list. That is surely her choice and<br/>
prerogative.<br/>
<br/>
In times past I have gone to Sandra and asked her, on the basis of<br/>
friendship, just to let things go. Many times she&#39;s opted to just not read<br/>
for a week or two or three.  This time that option did not feel appropriate.<br/>
How many times should she have to do that?<br/>

to the established community here.<br/>
<br/>
YET, I was saddened to see this whole misagosh take place. I did not <br/>
expect something like this on an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
I had taken the time to read at least a thousand posts and wanted to ask <br/>
Sandra for clarification on things that I&#39;ve read from her that I <br/>
perceived as prejudical. But she chose to leave. Her choice. There didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be any railroading. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not here so I cannot discuss MY issues with some of her opinions, <br/>
hence no details about it.<br/>
<br/>
I was saddened to see the talk of a seperate list and how THIS list was <br/>
going to suffer terribly without her advice. It didn&#39;t say much for the <br/>
other great advice, eye-opening opinions and though-provoking words.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152487349">I know lovemary will forward your request, but I think the point of <br/>
Sandra&#39;s new list is to be private. To exclude the one or two folks out <br/>

would have stayed on here.  <br/>
<br/>
I know you said it&#39;s not officially by invitation only, but it is. If <br/>
it were open to all, Sandra would have told this list about it herself <br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>
I think a list that was made of only supporters would get sort of dull <br/>
if you wanted any new info. Every post would be, &quot;Oh yes I agree&quot;, and <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re so right.&quot;zzzzzz. <br/>
<br/>
So will our list dwindle as the new one grows? Maybe. Are we doomed <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then you don&#39;t know Sandra very well. If she wanted to exclude those who <br/>
critize and/or question her, she would have never told me about the list. She <br/>
and I have our share of disagreements, but there is a mutual respect and an <br/>
ability to move on past disagreements.  And it isn&#39;t meant to be private, <br/>
because then she would have created a private list, not a public one as she <br/>
did. She hasn&#39;t told everyone on this list, because she is not a member <br/>
anymore and cannot post here if she isn&#39;t a member (I think). I highly doubt <br/>
the new list will be dull and full of &quot;I agree&quot; posts. <br/>
<br/>
The reason I know about it is that I CC&#39;d her on the post I wrote that had <br/>
information about her when she left the list. That felt like the right thing <br/>
to do to me. She wrote back to tell me she was thinking of starting another <br/>
list and did I want info on it. I replied I did. Very simple. . . no trying <br/>
to keep things private at all. I did not feel like I wanted to post all of <br/>
the information about that list on here, so I am giving her that option, as <br/>
LIsa requested. As I said, she is the moderator and will make decisions on <br/>
that list accordingly. I have no problems either way with lists being <br/>
moderated or not. I am on both types and seem to function fine either way.<br/>
