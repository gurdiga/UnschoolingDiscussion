<div id="ygrps-yiv-132682869">I never give advice on any of these questions because we are not <br/>
there yet...LOL  However, after reading many of your posts, I just <br/>
want to check if I&#39;m understanding things properly....<br/>
<br/>
We have laws in this country to protect the rights of others, not <br/>
all are good and some are downright stupid; usually the ones that <br/>
tell us what we can/cannot do in our own homes...those need to be <br/>
axed, those kind of laws infringe on how people are, therefore an <br/>
attempt to control people.  There are laws meant to keep peace, like <br/>
not starting your hammering or power tools up at 7 am and/or doing <br/>
loud construction, blaring music, etc. til&#39; all hours of the night, <br/>
making it hard for your neighbors to sleep.  Laws like that are not <br/>
really made for respectful people who are considerate and would <br/>
never do that just because they have principles and care about <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking this morning about Radical Unschooling and have to <br/>
admit that at first, I thought it was a permission slip for <br/>
disaster.  I DO NOT ANYMORE! :-)  Now I see it kind of like our <br/>
system in the US.  (Whether my husband will ever understand is one <br/>
thing, but then again, he isn&#39;t the one reading and seeking answers <br/>
to learn what I &quot;think&quot; I have learned)  A person in the home, <br/>
despite how old or young, has freedom.  Freedom to do what they <br/>
want...so long as it does not infringe on anothers rights within the <br/>
home; i.e.  a person needs to have a good nights sleep (at least I <br/>
do), in order to function properly the next day and you certainly <br/>
cannot go to work tired the next day because of being kept awake.  <br/>
So, although the child has the freedom to stay up as late as they <br/>
want, but they do not have the right to make noise that infringes <br/>
upon the right to sleep of other family members.  When the rights of <br/>
others in the home have been infringed upon, certain freedoms get <br/>
taken away fully or are cut down, until the child understands that <br/>
it is unacceptable to be disrespectful of others within the home.<br/>
<br/>
Other areas I can see this now are with television. This is an <br/>
example, I don&#39;t know because we haven&#39;t let loose the reigns: It is <br/>
okay that you watch whatever movie you want, so long as you don&#39;t <br/>
act out the violence on anyone, or watch a sexually explicit movie <br/>
and tell small children or other children what you have seen or <br/>
speak obscenities around other kids.  Although it is alright for you <br/>
to watch those movies, some people are not ready for their children <br/>
to hear those things. You can imagine pissed I was, when my daughter <br/>
was 6 and a 5 year old boy said &quot;I want to have sex with you, like <br/>
Neo does to Trinity.  &#39;I want to have sex with you and wiggle&#39;, &#39;I <br/>
want to put my pee-pee in you like they do in the movies, etc. <br/>
etc.&quot;   My daughter already knew what sex was in a general sense <br/>
because we talk about it for reasons of protection of her body and <br/>
what is not allowed to be touched, etc.  But a 5 year old child <br/>
talking like that bothers me.  However, I highly doubt, that in a <br/>
loving environment produced from a radical unschooling, natural <br/>
parenting that any of your children would have ever said a thing <br/>
like that. I cannot see that happening with your children at all.  <br/>
Matter of fact, I don&#39;t see any of you experienced ones even having <br/>
to say &quot;not to do that&quot; because I have a strong feeling that they <br/>
naturally wouldn&#39;t.  KWIM?  <br/>
<br/>
I see this now with the food issues also.  A child is not infringing <br/>
on an adults rights by eating when they feel like it and not at a <br/>
set supper time, or eating what they want.  It would be an <br/>
infringement though if they went and took a brand new package, can, <br/>
etc. and threw it in the trash or dumped it down the garbage <br/>
disposal just for the heck of it (my reasoning is that most people <br/>
can&#39;t afford to have that go on and can&#39;t just over look it)that <br/>
cost mom and/or dad money or that was something a sibling had bought <br/>
and desired.  Again, raised in a home with principles, it&#39;s one of <br/>
those things that would more than likely never have to be spoken, as <br/>
a &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot; because it just wouldn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about Freedom and Rights and not about do&#39;s and don&#39;ts.  Enjoy <br/>
your freedom, so long as it doesn&#39;t infringe upon the rights of <br/>
others.  If you misuse your freedoms, they will be dwindled down or <br/>
cutoff, in the area of freedom that you have caused anothers rights <br/>
to be violated.  Am I close or am I waaaaaay off?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>==============================<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good entry point.<br/>
If a young child has freedom, it should be within a framework in which he&#39;s <br/>
safe and with which he&#39;s familiar.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, although the child has the freedom to stay up as late as they<br/>
want, but they do not have the right to make noise that infringes<br/>
upon the right to sleep of other family members. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I used to say midnight (&quot;try to be asleep by midnight, please&quot;), but there <br/>
were always possible exceptions.  When Kirby was 13 or so I said 5:00 a.m. <br/>
because I thought his dad would be cranky if Kirby was still up when he left for <br/>
work.   Turned out Keith was NOT cranky about it, kinda thought it was cute to <br/>
see Kirby slaving away over a complicated video game, and so I told Kirby <br/>
&quot;never mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the opposite of an arbitrary bedtime is &quot;the freedom to stay up <br/>
as late as they want.&quot;   In a way it is, but if that latter is the frenzied <br/>
freedom of &quot;how far can I go?&quot; it&#39;s not healthy or good.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any human has a natural god-given freedom, despite the <br/>
attractive American mythology.    In any natural or historical human group, there are <br/>
safety issues and issues of power and need.   If it&#39;s good for the cavemen to <br/>
get in the cave and stay there quietly, the alpha male (or let&#39;s be <br/>
honest--the alpha female) is likely to enforce that.   But why would a little caveboy <br/>
WANT to hike out, or to stay awake while others are asleep?<br/>
<br/>
In any fortified city scenario (Hittites through...   now) if the guy in <br/>
charge says &quot;Quiet after 10:00&quot; that&#39;s that!   The guy in charge wants it quiet <br/>
and if you want to stay inside that fortification instead of being let out in <br/>
the dark (or worse), you&#39;ll be quiet.    On the other hand, some guys have been <br/>
assigned NOT to go to sleep, but to stay awake as sentries or peacekeepers.   <br/>
They don&#39;t have the freedom to go to sleep when they want to, either.<br/>
<br/>
Modern English-speaking democracies seem to have it all going on, <br/>
freedom-wise.   But still, the cave family and walled fortress models apply to a house <br/>
with people in it.   Should the doors be locked at a certain time?   If the dad <br/>
thinks so, does a kid have the right to unlock them or leave them standing <br/>
wide open?   Should the garage door be closed, the windows latched, the lights <br/>
off (or certain lights left on for security or safety reasons)?    Alpha male <br/>
(or female) will probably decide that for good reasons and enforce that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When the rights of<br/>
others in the home have been infringed upon, certain freedoms get<br/>
taken away fully or are cut down, until the child understands that<br/>
it is unacceptable to be disrespectful of others within the home.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier and friendlier and more empowering to start with the closer <br/>
relationship and let the child have more range gradually than to tell the child (or <br/>
yourself) that the child has &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; and then take it away <br/>
gradually.   That doesn&#39;t make philosophical sense.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid&#39;s not old enough to stay home alone, he doesn&#39;t &quot;have the right&quot; to <br/>
stay home.   But he&#39;ll probably WANT to be with his mom anyway, unless she&#39;s <br/>
being tacky, arbitrary and irritating.   If the mom likes the kid and wants the <br/>
kid to be with her, they&#39;re experiencing a mutually beneficial relationship <br/>
and kids don&#39;t tend to want to escape those.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is okay that you watch whatever movie you want, so long as you don&#39;t<br/>
act out the violence on anyone, or watch a sexually explicit movie<br/>
and tell small children or other children what you have seen or<br/>
speak obscenities around other kids. ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
This seems to suggest kids watching movies without the parents&#39; sharing and <br/>
discussing.   And depending how old the kid is, some movies are probably NOT at <br/>
all cool for them to watch.   If the parents haven&#39;t seen the movie to know <br/>
if that child can handle that material, it&#39;s irresponsible for the parent to <br/>
say &quot;Sure, watch it, just follow the rules for afterwards.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
One of Holly&#39;s favorite movies is Lawn Dogs.   She&#39;ll be 14 next week.   When <br/>
she was 11 and 12 I watched it and would pause when she was in the room, and <br/>
advised her that I didn&#39;t think it was a movie she should see.  There were a <br/>
couple of aspects I thought would disturb her.   More recently, when she was 13 <br/>
and wanting to see more Sam Rockwell movies, I warned her it could be <br/>
disturbing, and watched it with her.   Had she come to a part she didn&#39;t want to see, <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t have hesitated to pause it, fast-forward, or just turn it off <br/>
altogether.   Having seen it, she knows why I asked her to hold off on it.   But <br/>
she&#39;s trusted my advice for years, because ti was REAL advice, personalized <br/>
for her herself, and not an arbitrary &quot;you can&#39;t watch it becuase it&#39;s rated <br/>
R.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To say &quot;You can watch anything you want&quot; is as inflexible as &quot;You can&#39;t watch <br/>
anything rated R.&quot;   It&#39;s not personalized.   It&#39;s not comforting, or <br/>
protective or compassionate.    <br/>
<br/>
My friend Caroline can watch anything she wants.   She&#39;s in her 50&#39;s.   She <br/>
has the right.   But she does not want to watch any movies with snakes in them. <br/>
  So people who know that always warn her against movies with snake scenes, <br/>
and she&#39;s grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Children don&#39;t want to be afraid or disturbed, and parents can and should <br/>
help them find movies they will enjoy the same way parents would find them a good <br/>
path down a steep hill while hiking.   &quot;You can go down the mountain however <br/>
you want to&quot; isn&#39;t very helpful when there are cliffs and gullies full of <br/>
thorns and perfectly good trails.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Matter of fact, I don&#39;t see any of you experienced ones even having<br/>
to say &quot;not to do that&quot; because I have a strong feeling that they<br/>
naturally wouldn&#39;t.  KWIM? -=-<br/>
<br/>
We talk all the time about the differences in families caused by religion or <br/>
parental trauma or personality differences, and about not rocking other kids&#39; <br/>
boats, and about other people having the right NOT to be grossed out or afraid <br/>
(kinda related to &#39;keep your boogers in your nose until you&#39;re in private&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s about Freedom and Rights and not about do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s neither of those.<br/>
It&#39;s ideally, as I see it, about learning to make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Practicing that is going to result is some not-so-great decisions, but <br/>
practicing on small things, inexpensive and not life-threatening things, is better <br/>
than waiting until late teens for the first tastes of freedom, responsibility <br/>
and decisionmaking.<br/>
<br/>
Parents could make ALL decisions for children, legally.   And ethically, <br/>
making all is better than making NONE.   But there should be balance.   Pretending <br/>
that the child has all the legal rights of the adult, and all the <br/>
responsibilities, is not balance.   It&#39;s not honest or healthy or true, either.    The <br/>
most non-coercive family in the world really DOES need to buy clothes for their <br/>
kids and persuade them to wear them in publiic, unless the parents are not <br/>
particular about whether the child lives with them or in the custody of social <br/>
services.   &quot;Whatever&quot; isn&#39;t compassion or care.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can delegate a lot of decisionmaking, but they can&#39;t let go <br/>
altogether.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have a lot of freedom, but they came to that trust through years and <br/>
years of little good-decision moments, and from handling little situations <br/>
well.   Now I would trust them with big situations, but it didn&#39;t happen all of a <br/>
sudden.<br/>

 <br/>
Freedom and Rights=principles<br/>
