Hey Marji, do they have those books for groups like KoRn and Linkin Park? <br/>

Guitar has been an interest of Conor&#39;s since he was teeny, tiny. He took <br/>
lessons long ago and while he didn&#39;t hate them, their method did nothing to <br/>
help him play and may have turned him off.<br/>
<br/>
He dropped it for years and then this past year bought himself an electric <br/>
guitar. He hasn&#39;t yet really played it though. Maybe he&#39;s doing the learning <br/>
through osmosis thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the music he likes is very hard rock. Any ideas?<br/>

Not sure if you meant that as a &quot;I know the answer<br/>
really, but I&#39;m being goofy&quot; kind of statement or if<br/>
you&#39;re really wanting to know, so forgive me if that&#39;s<br/>
the case, but yes, you can get the sheet music for<br/>
just about everything. My favorite source is<br/>
www.sheetmusicplus.com. <br/>
<br/>
From what I understand as far as copyrights go, you<br/>
can perform the songs, and even change the lyrics (I<br/>
have a couple I&#39;m working on Christian lyrics for a<br/>
church group for) as long as you aren&#39;t accepting<br/>
money for their performance. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443897455">I have been looking into Scott Houston&#39;s piano book.  It is for people who<br/>
just want to learn to play some popular songs.  He says if you are serious<br/>
about classical piano, it is not the book you want.  It teaches chords.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scotthouston.com/home.html">http://www.scotthouston.com/home.html</a><br/>

Has anyone seen the book?<br/>

<br/>
We could brainstorm some rock&#39;n&#39;roll with easy to follow lines, and he could <br/>
pick out those tunes or little passages (not whole songs).   A famously easy <br/>
early song to follow is &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;  There are lots of really <br/>
clearly audible lines.<br/>
<br/>
Even playing basslines, even though he&#39;s not playing a bass, is useful.  He <br/>
can just pick out the bassline on the bottom two or three strings.  &quot;Twist <br/>
and Shout&quot; has an easy bassline (just like &quot;La Bamba&quot;) and getting that will <br/>
give him the patterns used in lots of runs in other places on the neck.<br/>
<br/>
If he goes straight to Eric Clapton solos or Eddie Van Halen, he could be <br/>
easily discouraged.  But there might be easier songs people could recommend, <br/>
and of current neo-heavy-metal stuff I don&#39;t know anything.  But others here <br/>
might.  <br/>
<br/>
And the old stuff is stuff that might already be around the house.  <br/>
<br/>
Even if he just gets part of a line, every phrase is going to be like some <br/>
other phrase in some other song.<br/>
