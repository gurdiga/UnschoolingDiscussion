<div id="ygrps-yiv-787922411">Rodale does publish that, it is &quot;Square Foot Gardening&quot; and is written by<br/>
Mel Bartholomew.  He use to (don&#39;t know if he still does) have a television<br/>
show that he did this on.  the kidlets like this book because of the<br/>
diagrams and easy to follow steps.  they also like the one about what<br/>
plants like to grow together, &quot;Carrots Love&quot; something or another.<br/>

&gt; There is a book called &quot;square foot gardening&quot; or something like that.  I<br/>
&gt; think from Rodale press.  Anyway, it is written for a beginner and<br/>
&gt; explains how you can garden with only a four square foot area.  I did<br/>
&gt; one.  There is only room for a few plants, but it&#39;s great for those of us<br/>
&gt; who don&#39;t LOVE spending all our time working in the garden.<br/>
&gt; Also, for baking bread I really like The Laurel&#39;s Kitchen Bread Book.  It<br/>
&gt; explains how you can tell your dough is ready and has a trouble shooting<br/>
&gt; guide.  Plus recipes.<br/>

I have had a square foot garden in my yard for three years now and it&#39;s<br/>
wonderful. It&#39;s a little tedious to set up, but once it&#39;s in it&#39;s easy and<br/>
maintain and you only grow as much as you&#39;re really going to use.<br/>

GREAT gardening resource!!!!<br/>
<br/>
That is the book that got me hooked on gardening, and especially composting.<br/>
I never bought it, just borrowed it from the library.  There are some<br/>
wonderful gardening message boards on the web, I no longer have the links<br/>
since the puter crash - but come mid-february, I will be a frequent visitor.<br/>
<br/>
Never fear, I too was a repeat offender of houseplant homicide.  The key I<br/>
soon learned.....water.  Not too much, not too little.  Second most<br/>
important, the amount of light a plant receives.<br/>
<br/>
Plants for the kids outside to start from seed - herbs.  When the last frost<br/>
is done, chuck the seeds in some dirt and add water.  Parsley, dill and<br/>
basil are SO easy to grow from seed, and most rewarding.  Even better is my<br/>
favorite, chives - they came back for me this year(surprisingly enough<br/>
because I grew them from seeds I had tucked for about 3 years).  Herbs are<br/>
hardy - stay away from lavender - that is tough unless you have an abundance<br/>
of sandy-ish soil and full sun.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know what zone you are in(or what state), soon you may be able to<br/>
throw a clove of garlic in the dirt and you have your own fresh in late<br/>
fall.<br/>
<br/>
Start easy with the gardening, maybe just some hardy annual (impatient or<br/>
geranium), just so you can get the feel of it.  Dana has gleaned so much<br/>
from gardening - I never would have thunk it.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the fact it is going to minus 4f tonight, I can smell spring in the<br/>
air!!  (even if it is in my head)<br/>
