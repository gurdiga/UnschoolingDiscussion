<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998276059">I just wanted to share this, please excuse the length<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Jaiden was playing with some pre-school workbooks that my <br/>
mom had gotten for him. We were sitting on the couch and he was <br/>
having me read the directions of the pages he couldn&#39;t figure out on <br/>
his own. We came to a page that had three sections with three <br/>
unrealated objects, you were supossed to figure out wich two were the <br/>
same color and then color them.<br/>
<br/>
Jaiden was kinda stuck on one that had a piece of fruit(looked like a <br/>
plum to me), a bunch of grapes, and a duck. I asked him if he needed <br/>
some help, he then explained to me that he didn&#39;t need help, but that <br/>
the workbook people had messed up. There were to many awnsers to that <br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
I was stumped, to me the plum and the grapes were the awnser and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out for the life of me what he was talking about. <br/>
Part of me was getting frusterated with jaiden, but I took a deep <br/>
breath and asked him is he would tell me what it was that he was <br/>
seeing because I didn&#39;t see what he was seeing. This is what he <br/>
explained to me.<br/>
<br/>
If the fruit was a plum, then it went with the grapes, but what if <br/>
they were green grapes, not purple grapes? Then the plum couldn&#39;t go <br/>
with the green grapes, and the plum couldn&#39;t go with the duck. So <br/>
maybe it wasn&#39;t a plum. Maybe it was a peach or a necterine, and it <br/>
was yellow/orange, it didn&#39;t go with the grapes, it would go wiht the <br/>
duck. But, we had been looking at ducks a week ago, and he didn&#39;t see <br/>
any yellow dunks, the only yellow duck he had seen was his rubber <br/>
ducky, and the picture looked like a real duck, not a plastic one. So <br/>
he decided that the fruit wasn&#39;t part of the awnser, it was the <br/>
grapes and the duck. I was still stumped and asked him if he would <br/>
tell me how he figured it out. This is his reasoning. His favorite <br/>
grapes are green, but the steam is brown, so the grapes are green and <br/>
brown, The ducks we saw at the park had green heads and brown bodys <br/>
(mallard ducks, I think) so they both were green and brown.<br/>
<br/>
I was speachless. I am so glad I took a deep breath and let him do it <br/>
his way. <br/>

WONDERFUL story and I&#39;m going to enshrine it somewhere unless you can talk me <br/>

Anyone else have any other stories of &quot;wrong&quot; answers being better than the <br/>

I wont try to talk you out of it, your more than welcome to put it anyware you&#39;d like. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still amazed this morning at the thought process that he went through. I don&#39;t think I ever did anything like that at his age, he&#39;s 4. But then I was put into a church school around 4, and you had to do things the &quot;right way&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you should include the story of Holly and turning the minuses into pluses. I loved that story.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369915577">This is a little different, but is an example of right/wrong answer.<br/>
<br/>
I was sitting in on a Sunday School class a number of years ago.  The topic<br/>
was love.  The teacher talked about Jesus loves you and asked the kids who<br/>
else loves you?  Kids answered mom, grandpa, my teacher, etc.  Then the<br/>
teacher said that Jesus wants you to love your enemies.  One very excited<br/>
kid waved his hand in the air and then said he loves the devil.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher freaked out and said no, you shouldn&#39;t love the devil, then<br/>
changed the subject.  I could see the kid was crushed and couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand why he was &quot;wrong&quot;.  I thought how very right he was.  Who else<br/>
would be the ultimate enemy of Jesus but the devil?  I felt the teacher<br/>
missed a great opportunity for real thinking and discussion, but I suppose<br/>
that wasn&#39;t the point of the Sunday school class.<br/>
<br/>
We only visited that church a few times, and I&#39;ve never seen that teacher or<br/>
kid since.<br/>

As I was first reading, I so knew what you were dealing with. When my kids<br/>
liked doing work book pages, some of them were darn confusing to me even.<br/>
Pictures were hard to figure out. What in the world was that supposed to<br/>
be?????<br/>
<br/>
I loved your story and am glad too he was able to get to the point of<br/>
finding the answer himself. What a good job he did!!!!<br/>

I must&#39;ve deleted the first post.  Oops.  It was about workbooks, so....I <br/>
didn&#39;t bite, but I should&#39;ve known better with you guys.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, so many of those stories!  Can&#39;t remember any specifically now because <br/>
it&#39;s been so long since we&#39;ve used *any* workbook for that reason.  <br/>
<br/>
But, it always turned out great because we had long talks about objectiveness <br/>
vs subjectiveness (well, not using those terms) or how silly multiple choice <br/>
is, because it limits imagination so much,  or laughed our butts off by our <br/>
answers, and trying to make them even goofier, or even more off base than the <br/>
&quot;answer&quot; and trying out absolutely tortured ways to make &quot;our answer&quot; make <br/>
sense, somehow, anyhow.  That made for some very funny stories that we would each <br/>
add to and take in a different direction, until we were rolling on the floor <br/>
laughing!  Oh, so fun!!  Maybe I don&#39;t hate workbooks after all, lol.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695613394">You reminded me of a funny story along the same lines.  My son loves <br/>
to play act, use action figures, etc.  He does this pretty much all <br/>
the time and we discovered he always had to be the main character, <br/>
Christopher Robin on Pooh; Harry in Harry Potter, Billy Blazes in <br/>
REscue Heros, even Anthony on the Wiggles because he does the most <br/>
singing.  It is a running joke around here.  Anyway, we are not too <br/>
religious over here and one night we were watching a cartoon of Ben <br/>
Hur.  Somewhere close to the end I said, &quot;So who are you, Ben Hur?&quot; <br/>
and he says &quot;No, I am Jesus.&quot;  I thought it was hysterical, I am not <br/>
certain the church may agree&lt;G&gt;.  But all that innocence just showed <br/>
through.  Well, we want them to reach for the stars.  You can&#39;t reach <br/>
much further than that..LOL!<br/>

YES!!  That is awesome, I love it. Subjective vs objective again, and guess <br/>
what I realized?  Objectivity is a total myth.  Everything is subjective. ( <br/>
someone famous already said that, no?) <br/>
<br/>
 Guess I didn&#39;t miss it after all, I&#39;m just bouncing around....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886463529">What a wonderful story!!!  How cool to actually experience the processing,<br/>
and hear Jaiden&#39;s reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
...now you reminded me of an &quot;A ha!&quot; moment I had, right before pulling my <br/>
youngest out of ps kindergarten.  <br/>
<br/>
I went into school to pick him up at lunch time.  The teacher was walking the<br/>
class down the hall...and hollered to me to stay until everyone was picked up,<br/>
because she had something important to talk to me about.  She was very<br/>
serious.  Once everyone had left, my son sat on the bench looking truly worried<br/>
at what she was about to tell me.  <br/>
<br/>
She informed me that math must just not be his thing.  She and her assistant<br/>
had been trying to get a simple concept across to him, and he just wasn&#39;t getting <br/>
it.  She said she had asked him to count backward from 5.  He would look at her <br/>
a little confused, not say anything, and then start with &quot;100...&quot;  She would stop <br/>
and tell him, &quot;NO...you have to start with 5&quot;....and he would say he didn&#39;t know  <br/>
how to do it.  This process was repeated several times before it was time to go...<br/>
and she said he only actually got it after the assistant did it FOR him.  (No one had<br/>
provided him with any demonstration of what they wanted, and they had<br/>
not counted backward in class before).<br/>
<br/>
I told her I didn&#39;t know what the problem was, because he counts backward all<br/>
the time at home,  blasting off rocket ships, running races, etc. <br/>
<br/>
When we got home, I asked him at dinner if he could count backward from 5.<br/>
He said...(very emphatically) &quot;I KNOW how to do it NOW, Miss Anna showed <br/>
me....5 4 3 2 1.....but that doesn&#39;t make any sense!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked him, &quot;What does make sense?&quot;  And he said &quot;100....&quot;  and I interrupted,<br/>
just like his teacher, to tell him that he had forgotten to start with 5.  He was so angry,<br/>
he just did one of those growly things and left the room.  I went and apologized, and<br/>
said, &quot;O.K.  tell me the rest.&quot;  He said, &quot;MOM....I have been trying to tell you people<br/>
all day!!!  100....paused, waiting for me to stop him, then VERY slowly....95....90....85....<br/>
80....75....&quot;  all the way down to zero.  I wanted to cry.  I felt so bad for not listening to <br/>
him the first time. <br/>
<br/>
Of course this made complete sense, because for the past month in school, they <br/>
had been counting by 5&#39;s every day.  So when she asked him to count backward from 5....<br/>
well, you get the picture.<br/>
<br/>
When I explained to his teacher what had happened........she told me this clearly <br/>
indicated that we have an attention problem on our hands, that he wasn&#39;t listening<br/>
carefully to instructions.  She spared not even one moment to consider the thought<br/>
process that was required for him to have come up with the answer he did.  It didn&#39;t<br/>
matter, it wasn&#39;t the pre-determined answer, it didn&#39;t fit anywhere on her chart.<br/>
<br/>
I am still conditioning myself to take lots of &quot;deep breaths,&quot; because when I STOP<br/>
talking, that is when he usually starts discovering and processing.<br/>
<br/>
I watched him yesterday staring out the windows in his bedroom.  I thought he <br/>
was enjoying the woods, or watching a squirrel.  A little later he came out to me and <br/>
said, &quot;hey...did you know that 24 has 8 threes in it...did you know that 24 has 4 sixes in it...<br/>
did you know that 24 has 2 twelves in it.......   He brought me into his room and pointed out <br/>
the windows.  Actually, he was pointing AT the windows.  He had been studying the panes, <br/>
and grouping them into equal sets.  <br/>
<br/>
We were at dinner with my in-laws last weekend, and he said...&quot;Did you ever notice that with <br/>
odd numbers, there is a middle one?&quot;  My mil gave him, and then me, an odd look.  He pointed <br/>
to his middle finger, and said...look 2 on this side, 2 on this side, and one in the middle.  Then <br/>
he did it with three, and then told me to hold up my hands so he could show 7 and 9.  My mil <br/>
later told me that she was just surprised that he even knew what an odd number was.  <br/>
<br/>
I can only imagine what keeping him in a &quot;school&quot; atmosphere would have done to him.  By the<br/>
end of kindergarten he would have been convinced that math was not his thing.  And maybe it<br/>
won&#39;t be later...but, goodness, don&#39;t squelch it now!!  Maybe the teacher was right, &quot;school&quot; math<br/>
wasn&#39;t his thing.  Not enough windows?<br/>

  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids and workbooks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I just wanted to share this, please excuse the length<br/>
<br/>
  Yesterday Jaiden was playing with some pre-school workbooks that my <br/>
  mom had gotten for him. We were sitting on the couch and he was <br/>
  having me read the directions of the pages he couldn&#39;t figure out on <br/>
  his own. We came to a page that had three sections with three <br/>
  unrealated objects, you were supossed to figure out wich two were the <br/>
  same color and then color them.<br/>
<br/>
  Jaiden was kinda stuck on one that had a piece of fruit(looked like a <br/>
  plum to me), a bunch of grapes, and a duck. I asked him if he needed <br/>
  some help, he then explained to me that he didn&#39;t need help, but that <br/>
  the workbook people had messed up. There were to many awnsers to that <br/>
  question.<br/>
<br/>
  I was stumped, to me the plum and the grapes were the awnser and I <br/>
  couldn&#39;t figure out for the life of me what he was talking about. <br/>
  Part of me was getting frusterated with jaiden, but I took a deep <br/>
  breath and asked him is he would tell me what it was that he was <br/>
  seeing because I didn&#39;t see what he was seeing. This is what he <br/>
  explained to me.<br/>
<br/>
  If the fruit was a plum, then it went with the grapes, but what if <br/>
  they were green grapes, not purple grapes? Then the plum couldn&#39;t go <br/>
  with the green grapes, and the plum couldn&#39;t go with the duck. So <br/>
  maybe it wasn&#39;t a plum. Maybe it was a peach or a necterine, and it <br/>
  was yellow/orange, it didn&#39;t go with the grapes, it would go wiht the <br/>
  duck. But, we had been looking at ducks a week ago, and he didn&#39;t see <br/>
  any yellow dunks, the only yellow duck he had seen was his rubber <br/>
  ducky, and the picture looked like a real duck, not a plastic one. So <br/>
  he decided that the fruit wasn&#39;t part of the awnser, it was the <br/>
  grapes and the duck. I was still stumped and asked him if he would <br/>
  tell me how he figured it out. This is his reasoning. His favorite <br/>
  grapes are green, but the steam is brown, so the grapes are green and <br/>
  brown, The ducks we saw at the park had green heads and brown bodys <br/>
  (mallard ducks, I think) so they both were green and brown.<br/>
<br/>
  I was speachless. I am so glad I took a deep breath and let him do it <br/>
  his way. <br/>

&lt;&lt;Maybe the teacher was right, &quot;school&quot; math wasn&#39;t his thing.  Not enough<br/>
windows?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
