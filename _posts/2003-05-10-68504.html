 </span></blockquote>totally! one of the first exercises, about thinking what your unique <br/>
genius is, getting back to what you were into as a little child <br/>
before the school system knocked it out of you...wow! Makes me KNOW, <br/>
my kids are better off with me backing away and letting them do their <br/>
own thing...they will be much better off as adults, if they are <br/>
allowed to go along their path from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty exciting, nervous making...<br/>
<br/>
thanks again<br/>
