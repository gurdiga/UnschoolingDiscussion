<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163846680">I am one of those who have been in and out of this list for years, sometimes <br/>
feverishly reading all the messages, and other times not being able to find <br/>
two minutes to turn on the computer.  Once again, I am seriously needing life <br/>
advice from all you experienced and wise people.  <br/>
 A little background:  Unschooling was a rapid and happy evolutionary journey <br/>
for us, but fate had some challenges in store for our family.  We weathered <br/>
through an earthquake that damaged our home, a fire, a burglary, a stroke, <br/>
cancer, a car accident, bankruptcy, and two grandparents and my brother&#39;s deaths.  <br/>
Other than one year around preliminary divorce proceedings, the kids have <br/>
never been in school. However, now, years later, I am crumbling under the <br/>
responsibilities of being a single, working, unschooling mom.  I am exhausted, my <br/>
health is tenuous, my finances nonexistent, and the sparkle/hope is fading from <br/>
my kids eyes.  We have a great relationship, filled with much love and respect, <br/>
but are struggling under the burdens of sadness and fear. For the past four <br/>
years, their dad has been disabled, with brain damage and addiction to <br/>
prescription meds, after another serious car accident. I have just been told that the <br/>
property where the kids and I live, is slated to be sold, and that we must <br/>
relocate in April.  I swear, I am not exaggerating all this. Kinda overwhelmed.  <br/>
I have no intention of abandoning our unschooling philosophy, but I am trying <br/>
to figure out, along with my kids, how to adapt our lives yet again. I have <br/>
little time, energy or money to be the creative positive guiding influence that <br/>
I have always striven to be.  The kids do not want to attend a large public <br/>
school, but we haven&#39;t found a small, progressive one either.  They don&#39;t quite <br/>
know what to do with themselves while I am away at work, errands, medical <br/>
appointments and therapy for sixty hours a week.  Other than one personal friend <br/>
who is a registered child and family therapist, we have not been able to find a <br/>
therapist for teens who supports home or unschooling. So there is the <br/>
framework for all my questions:<br/>
Are their any articles or archived discussions about unschooling as a single <br/>
and/or working parent?  <br/>
Has anyone found a supportive therapist that won&#39;t report unschoolers for <br/>
neglect?<br/>
If due to financial or medical necessity, you became less available to your <br/>
unschooled children, what would you do?<br/>
I feel very self indulgent even posting this, but I am trembling to face the <br/>
days ahead.<br/>
Bright blessings and gratitude to you all,<br/>

do.<br/>
There is someone  who does long-distance counselling,  and who might  <br/>
know others in your area:<br/>

She has a yahoogroup, I see there, too.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t neglect, but that doesn&#39;t mean there can&#39;t be  <br/>
neglect in a family saying &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe family therapy by someone who really understands unschooling  <br/>
could make all the difference in your situation!<br/>
<br/>
This does sound dire, and I&#39;m sorry to hear you&#39;ve had a disasterous  <br/>
run of circumstances.<br/>

<br/>
Would the kids like to go to school at all?  I mean even if they go  <br/>
just for a place to be with other people, might it be helpful in some  <br/>
ways?<br/>

Some of that might make you feel better.<br/>

You need to reach out to someone and ask for help.  You shouldn&#39;t <br/>
feel indulgent for doing that, you are trying to help your kids.<br/>
I would try to find places for my kids to be that they would enjoy.<br/>
Other people to hang out with , while I&#39;m gone.<br/>
Maybe brainstorming about the resources in your area would help.<br/>
Are there home/unschooling support groups near you.<br/>
Ask for help.<br/>
I have looked for unschoolers in my area for years.  We are few and <br/>
far between.  I finally joined the local Christian homeschoolers <br/>
yahoo group to find out about events going on in our area, and have <br/>
met some really nice families that my kids like playing with.  And <br/>
suprisingly, even though they &quot;do school&quot;  they are more relaxed <br/>
than I expected.<br/>
Saying you felt indulgent for asking for help on this yahoo group, <br/>
said a lot to me.   How are you going to get what you need if your <br/>
reluctant to ask for it.  <br/>
