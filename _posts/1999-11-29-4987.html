<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764936679">I personally don&#39;t shop at our local Wal-Mart bc it is so huge.  I&#39;m not<br/>
familiar with the store, I get lost inside, and it takes me forever to<br/>
find anything, so I just shop at Fred Meyer and Albertsons.  And I don&#39;t<br/>
know who really owns them either.<br/>
It&#39;s true that management personal are brought in from other towns, but<br/>
once here, their families live and consume in our town.  (I know, bc my<br/>
friend&#39;s dh is one of them)  As for the part-time low-wage employees,<br/>
what would those folks be doing instead?  I think the enemy is not<br/>
Wal-Mart itself, but the our whole consume-consume-some-more mentality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67000338">The scenerio is to come to town and promise FULL-TIME jobs with benefits. <br/>
Most of these folks left other jobs for these jobs which turned into no<br/>
benefits and part-time.  Their old bosses don&#39;t want them back and that<br/>
usually leaves only other part-time poor paying jobs or unemployment.<br/>
