&lt;&lt; My whole life, I have hated Pecan Pie.  Couldn&#39;t stand the stuff.  But, I<br/>
 believe that it is good to retry foods periodically to remember WHY you<br/>
 don&#39;t like them.  So today, I tried Pecan Pie again.  Great Stuff!  I<br/>
 love it now.  Over the years, my tastes have changed a lot.  I now eat<br/>
 loads of things I didn&#39;t like when I was younger.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

   Your taste buds change over life. Many foods children typically don&#39;t like <br/>
are well liked later in life. Also has to do w/ our inate ability to weed <br/>
through toxic foods. Little bodies can&#39;t handle what adults can.<br/>
