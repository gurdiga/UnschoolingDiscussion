<div id="ygrps-yiv-247116817">(Rant Warning) Delete if you like. &lt;BWWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Please someone help me out. ;-) Does anyone read the intro welcome letter?<br/>
How many new s*bscribers does this list get in an average day or week? It<br/>
sure would be nice to know that *some* do _wait and read_ before posting.<br/>
Seems like every few days we get someone that _just_ joined. Yada Yada<br/>
Yada.....<br/>
<br/>
  I know, I know! Use the delete key. I&#39;ve already went to digest. Then I<br/>
have to scroll through it all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480305349">Thanks Joyce.:-) I kinda figured that but just had to vent a bit. I&#39;ve<br/>
went to digest to maybe save me time reading. Even though I have to scroll<br/>
through *everything* when some don&#39;t kiss. I read slow but absorb a lot.<br/>
Thanks all. &lt;BWWG&gt;<br/>
