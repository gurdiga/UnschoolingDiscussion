<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;How can parents send their darling children out into the neighborhood<br/>
&gt;I just had to tell a little boy, the cutest little fellow, that I<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t buy whatever it was he was selling.  I can&#39;t encourage it.<br/>
&gt;And he was crushed.  Poor little kid.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I want to tell him that he is<br/>
&gt;being abused by this shameless practice of using cute kids to sell<br/>
&gt;crap but I&#39;m not going to lecture a little fellow who has bravely<br/>
&gt;approached someone he doesn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I HATE this practice.  Aggghhhhhhhh!&lt;&lt; </span></blockquote></div>

Talk about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The Unschooling.com list is not your personal soap box from which to lob<br/>
rants about the public schools.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a place to share our personal experiences and help each other unschool.<br/>
