<div id="ygrps-yiv-47400974">&quot;Interestingly, there<br/>
was a time Quakers didn&#39;t participate in Christmas at all but<br/>
everyone this century is pretty main stream about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was a time America didn&#39;t participate at all!! That&#39;s why I find <br/>
the whole &quot;attack on Christmas&quot; stuff hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing about your St. Nick festivities. <br/>
We went to storytelling in downtown Jonesborough tonight, where one of <br/>
the storytellers told the history of St. Nick and Christ Mass up to <br/>
the 1800&#39;s and Clement Moore (famous for &quot;Twas the Night Before <br/>
Christmas...&quot;) and how that affected our modern day traditions, <br/>
including the image of &quot;St. Nick&quot;.<br/>
