<div id="ygrps-yiv-362682323">Hi,<br/>
  I am writing, because I was spanked as a child. I was taken in the yard<br/>
and told to find a stick so my sweet little mom could hit my legs with it.<br/>
Is all sounds so ridiculously funny to me now. I don&#39;t remember it actually<br/>
scaring me out of doing something, because I was determined to do what I<br/>
wanted anyway. Emotionally damaged? I don&#39;t think so, although I did use it<br/>
to my advantage to instill guilt when I was an obnoxious teenager, and was<br/>
getting all the school psychology stuff. People would come in and ask<br/>
students how they would feel? did this or that happen? I did buy into that<br/>
and started to really take self pity on myself, and scream at my parents<br/>
about their poor skills as parents. What a brat! Now, I am too busy to even<br/>
worry about woes of my childhood. I think spanking is very ineffective. It<br/>
only makes the parent feel worse than even the child,my dad always<br/>
apologized for days after he would spank me. I don&#39;t think it does anything<br/>
to modify behavior. Maybe it stops a behavior short term by humiliating the<br/>
child into a quiet state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283240931">I once stopped a woman from breaking a branch from one of the bushes <br/>
in my front yard. She was going to use it to hit her grandchild. <br/>
grrrr...<br/>
<br/>
Spanking makes the child resent the spanker. They forget what they <br/>
were being spanked for. Experience talking here.<br/>
