<div id="ygrps-yiv-993203182">My kids have to be tested this year<br/>
I am so NONtest that I am not even sure of the name of the tests<br/>
In PA you have to be tested in certain grades....I was wondering if anyone knew where I could get samples of the kinds and types of tests they give in school.<br/>
My advisor informed me that they may not know how to take a test and of course I did not even think of that aspect of it and when I voiced my concerns to the principal of the elementary school she did not seem to want to be bothered<br/>
I hid my daughter &quot;away&quot; in the third grade--she is now in &quot;5th&quot; and my son in &quot;3rd&quot; and I have no experience with these tests AT all---but I am told that they are easy<br/>
I do not do much (if any) formal schooling---So I need to find out what types of things they will be asked.<br/>
When I teach them--I teach them through LIFE and I am so sure that is not what these happy little tests are going to ask--they want them to memorize their little theorems etc...Geez<br/>
Does anyone have any resources or know where to look?<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
