<div id="ygrps-yiv-272834985">My daughter got a pair of rollerblades for her 6th birthday <br/>
recently.  We decided to take the girls to the rollerskating rink <br/>
last night.<br/>
<br/>
I was struck by how many arbitrary rules and regulations there were.  <br/>
Even before we got in the door, there was a huge sign posted outside <br/>
that listed all of the rules.  Then, to get from the ticket area to <br/>
the rink area, there was a door that we had to be &quot;buzzed in&quot; <br/>
through.  After that there was a big sign on the other side of the <br/>
door that said you couldn&#39;t go back out or you would have to pay <br/>
again to get back in.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, we had to give our driver&#39;s license to the ticket guy in order <br/>
to rent &quot;baby skates.&quot;  Not on any other kind of skates, just <br/>
the &quot;baby skates.&quot;  And we couldn&#39;t get the id back until we returned <br/>
the skates.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, once we were on the floor, the teenage employees kept coming up <br/>
to us and saying, &quot;You can&#39;t stop on the floor, you have to keep <br/>
going!&quot;  Never mind that my 6 year old has never skated before and <br/>
she starts and stops frequently to rest or get her balance.  Never <br/>
mind that sometimes I need to stop to let her catch up to me.  Never <br/>
mind that the rink is not exactly *packed* and we&#39;re not in anyone&#39;s <br/>
way.  <br/>
<br/>
And then they stop the &quot;free skate&quot; periodically and often so that <br/>
they can have these little competitions or do the hokey-pokey or <br/>
whatever.  If it&#39;s couple skate you have to be two people holding <br/>
hands.  Saren (the 6 y.o.) would get going good and be really into <br/>
what she was doing and really proud of herself and then she would <br/>
have to get off the rink so that they could do limbo, which she isn&#39;t <br/>
good enough to do yet (or whatever other thing they were doing).<br/>
<br/>
I used to go skating when I was 13 and 14 at the same rink (same <br/>
company anyway) and I know the rules were there then too.  But I <br/>
didn&#39;t think anything of it because my life was so regimented and <br/>
full of arbitrary rules anyway.  For Saren, though, it created some <br/>
dissonance and she asked why some of the rules were in place.  They <br/>
didn&#39;t make sense to her and it didn&#39;t occur to her to just accept it <br/>
unquestioningly anyway.<br/>
<br/>
At first I wondered why there were so many rules and then I realized <br/>
that rollerskating rinks are primarily for children and where <br/>
children are concerned it&#39;s all about control.  It was maddening.<br/>
<br/>
Are other rollerskating rinks like this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967343671">We frequent three rinks in our area and none are this rigid. We skate during<br/>
organized homeschool skates though and that might make a difference. Maybe<br/>
we homeschoolers are better received. Do you have homeschool skates?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524759741">Those rules sound similar to the rules at our local skating rink.   The rules <br/>
do seem harsh and arbitrary, but they are in place for safety and business <br/>
reasons.   Although not all kids, maybe not even many kids, will be sneaky and <br/>
unethical, some will.   Kids will try to sneak in the rink without paying when <br/>
another person goes in ( hence getting buzzed in)  Kids will go in and out of <br/>
the rink, goof off outside, maybe get hurt outside or damage property..hence <br/>
having to pay to get back in.   When a person stops on the rink, it is <br/>
potentially dangerous for themselves and other skaters, it&#39;s difficult to stop on a <br/>
dime in skates.  Kids at the rinks are skating on different levels, some may get <br/>
bored with continuous free skate, so other activities are provided to keep <br/>
all the customers happy.   You also have to keep in mind that most kids at the <br/>
skating rink are dropped off and left with no adult supervision, other than the <br/>
rink employees.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of rules do suck, and a lot of them are really not needed, but they are <br/>
in place to protect the business from law suits and the customers from the <br/>
few folks that do not behave appropiately.   Sometimes we forget that the rest <br/>
of the world does not operate on unschooling principles.   We take for granted <br/>
that folks will always do the right thing.  I get caught up in that bubble <br/>
sometimes too.    Going on a homeschool day would probably be a lot better.. at <br/>
least you would have some other familes to commiserate with about the rules..<br/>

~Stephanie<br/>
Both the roller-skating rinks in our town are like that. With the exception <br/>
of the drivers license thing. The other rule ours have is they have to inspect <br/>
any skates you bring in. They won&#39;t let you wear rollerblades or regular <br/>
skates if they have been worn outside!<br/>
