<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222448443">I strongly believe in unschooling, or &quot;delight-directed&quot; learning.  But in<br/>
order for it to succeed, it&#39;s IMPERATIVE that parents offer an<br/>
ever-expanding variety of &quot;delights&quot; to which their children may wish to<br/>
latch themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, it&#39;s not enough to leave the child to fend for him or<br/>
herself when it comes to discovering interests.  Wise parents aggressively<br/>
seek opportunities to expose their children to the wider community, to<br/>
complex issues, to a spectrum of people, to the greatest minds, and so<br/>
forth.<br/>
<br/>
Take your children to an art museum.  Interpret a painting for them.  Then<br/>
ask for their interpretations.  Go home and create your own oil paintings.<br/>
Take your children to a public meeting.  Point out the mayor.  Try to have<br/>
them meet the mayor, or a senator, or congressman.  Take them to a street<br/>
demonstration. Take them to the zoo.  Sit on a bench with them for awhile<br/>
and watch a particular animal.  Talk about what you see.  Volunteer with<br/>
your children at a library, or other community center.  Take walks through<br/>
nature preserves.  Intentionally slow down and truly notice the plants, and<br/>
wildlife.  Write about it when you get home.  Seek out interesting and<br/>
creative people in your community; inventors, authors, scientists, poets,<br/>
etc.  Arrange to visit with these people in their homes, or go to hear them<br/>
speak, or write letters to them.  Visit the city hall, the state capitol,<br/>
the history museum, the bookstores.  Read books together everyday.  Talk<br/>
about ideas and philosophies at the dinner table.  Be a passionate scholar<br/>
yourself.  Visit historical sites.  Talk about your visit.  Write letters to<br/>
grandparents.  Help your children imagine what life was like many years<br/>
previous when their grandparents were children themselves.  Take your<br/>
children camping to a variety of places.  Go on guided tours whenever you<br/>
can.  Write about them after you return home.  Arrange for penpals for your<br/>
children; ideally, this could be children from other countries and cultures.<br/>
Travel often both locally and, when possible, internationally.  Make a point<br/>
to talk with people on the street and in the shops.  Be endlessly curious.<br/>
Read books about your travel destinations beforehand and then books about<br/>
your favorite places after the trip is over.  Record your itinerary in a<br/>
journal.  Be actors in a local play.  Join a gymnastics club.  Take fencing<br/>
lessons as a family.  Learn to play a musical instrument.<br/>
<br/>
The list goes on and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Proper unschooling is anything but passive and directionless.  On the<br/>
contrary, it is arguably one of the most demanding of all learning methods.<br/>
And, we think it could be one of the most stimulating as well.  Parents just<br/>
need to break out of their comfort zone and aggressively seek to harness the<br/>
endless resources of their community and ultimately the world around them.<br/>
It&#39;s not a job for the feint-hearted or those who are happier just following<br/>
instructions from so-called experts.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, it&#39;s about lighting a fire within yourself and letting it<br/>
burn brightly enough that your children naturally desire to become engulfed<br/>
as well.<br/>
