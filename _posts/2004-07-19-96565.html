<div id="ygrps-yiv-324955114">Does anyone have a good source/resource for a comprehensive <br/>
assessment test that I can give my 12 year old?  He feels pretty sure <br/>
he will pass the assessment that&#39;s due at the end of this upcoming <br/>
school year and would like to take a test to prove it to himself.  <br/>
(go figure?! - I don&#39;t think he &quot;de-schooled&quot; very well, or enough) - <br/>
anyway, I think it might help him get into the groove of directing <br/>
his own learning if he saw what his 7th grade assessment would be <br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all help appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; We use Seton.  They test for $25.00 and return the results to you.  Or you <br/>
&gt; could go to a Parent/Teacher store and they have lots of books with sample <br/>
&gt; tests in them.  If you have one of those in your area.<br/>

There are online checklists and tests.  I&#39;d go to google and look for some, <br/>
or look for homeschooling testing online.   I avoid tests bigtime myself. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
I do remember having seen some, years ago, looking for something else.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the worldbook study guide site which can be kind of cool for <br/>
those who are afraid of no lists, though it&#39;s not a test.  <br/>

If you want him to deschool, don&#39;t lean too hard toward those tests.  His <br/>
score on a 7th grade test doesn&#39;t affect his learning, your right to homeschool, <br/>
or his future.  It might be more important to devalue the test in his mind <br/>
than to help him regard it as important.<br/>
