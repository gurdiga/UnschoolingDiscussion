<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722929607">Sometime either today or yesterday, someone wrote a post discussing <br/>
Christianity and referred to two different men&#39;s names. One was Ezzo and I <br/>
think the other started with an F. I went back through all of today&#39;s and <br/>
yesterday&#39;s posts and couldn&#39;t find it. I wanted to read some on these guys, <br/>
so if anyone remembers the names, or if you wrote that post pleas refer me to <br/>

Here&#39;s a couple of things from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nogreaterjoy.org/subject1.htm">http://nogreaterjoy.org/subject1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Q: Please give me a description of the switch or rod of which you so often<br/>
speak. I wish you could send me one so I could see it.<br/>
<br/>
A: The rod we speak of is a plumbing supply line that can be bought at any<br/>
hardware store or large department store. It is a slim, flexible, plastic<br/>
tubing that supplies water to sinks, and toilets. Ask for &quot;14 inch supply<br/>
line.&quot; They cost less than one dollar. I always give myself one swat before<br/>
I swat the child to remind myself how much force to exert. It stings the<br/>
skin without bruising or damaging tissue. It¹s a real attention geter.<br/>
Michael demonstrates its use in our new Seminar videos.<br/>
<br/>
Mistraining at Three Months<br/>
 <br/>
One of the young mothers in the church tells how she trained her<br/>
three-month-old daughter to cry and whine to be picked up and held. Upon<br/>
seeing her parents start to drift into another room, the baby cried out. The<br/>
father responded, ³Get little Suzy, she wants to be with us.² Mother picked<br/>
up Suzy, and she spread her beautiful smile in delight. Well, that¹s the<br/>
real life story of how Suzy was trained to whine. She initiated an act,<br/>
whining, to which the mother responded by picking her up. That was the first<br/>
day of a lifelong habit.<br/>
<br/>
She will refine her technique, employing more threats and spreading more<br/>
misery. She will eventually fall on the floor, kicking her feet and<br/>
screaming. The mother will be embarrassed in public, frustrated and angry at<br/>
home, and will eventually have such contention and strife between her and<br/>
her demanding daughter that she will write a letter to us wanting to know<br/>
how to deal with an angry, undisciplined and unthankful teenager.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413384360">My bil and sil have used Ezzo and possibly this approach.  Last time we saw<br/>
them,  I noticed their 4 yos outside chasing and hitting a cat.  I asked him<br/>
about it and he said the cat was &quot;bad&quot; and needed to be punished to know how<br/>
to be &quot;good&quot;.  What did the cat do?  It was chasing and trying to eat a<br/>
bird.  The boy got a stick and said he needed to hit the cat with it.<br/>
<br/>
My 4yo would NOT consider this form of action.  Had she been upset about the<br/>
bird,  we could have talked about it.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Q: Please give me a description of the switch or rod of which you so often<br/>
<br/>
&gt; speak. I wish you could send me one so I could see it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; A: The rod we speak of is a plumbing supply line that can be bought at any<br/>
<br/>
&gt; hardware store or large department store. It is a slim, flexible, plastic<br/>
<br/>
&gt; tubing that supplies water to sinks, and toilets. Ask for &quot;1Ž4 inch supply<br/>
<br/>
&gt; line.&quot; They cost less than one dollar. I always give myself one swat before<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I swat the child to remind myself how much force to exert. It stings the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; skin without bruising or damaging tissue. It¹s a real attention geter.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is just sick.  I am so glad they have learned through all the years of <br/>
child abuse exactly how to hit a child. I am sure their kids will thank them <br/>
for it.<br/>
~Nancy~ off to hug my kids<br/>

Probably by spanking their own kids to show how well they learned the lesson <br/>
actually being taught.</div>

their future. <br/>
~Nancy~ Did they watch Mommie Dearest and think &quot;No, the hanger is just too <br/>
over the top. Lets use plumbing supplies instead&quot;?<br/>
