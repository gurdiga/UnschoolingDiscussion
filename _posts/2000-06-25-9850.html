&gt;Hey!  Hasn&#39;t anyone but Pris been reading my thread on adoption?  We are <br/>
&gt;ecstatic about it.  I don&#39;t think we could get any &quot;Happier&quot; or be more <br/>
&gt;excited about what will happen on Monday and whether this one will be the one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902423737">I am so pleased whenever I hear of a good adoption about to happen.  We have one<br/>
adopted from India (I was 41 at the time, and we homeschool) -- and in my Friends<br/>
(Quaker) meeting, adoption is now the norm rather than the exception -- we actually<br/>
have more adopted kids than the either kind, a veritable United Nations! (even 3<br/>
from Texas!)<br/>

I get a lot of questions from case workers initially regarding my &quot;Youth.&quot;  But our own case worker and the ones who get to talk to us always comment that it is not an issue due to my great maturity and understanding of the issues.  You would not get those questions, as they would presuppose maturity due to your age.<br/>
