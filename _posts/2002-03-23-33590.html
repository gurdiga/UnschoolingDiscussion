<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479430175"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I even called everyone over and said. See how the pots & pans are placed? <br/>
&gt;&gt;We can see all of them, the lids are right there, so no searching. <br/>
&gt;&gt;Everyone agreed, &quot;wow, that&#39;s so organized. What a great idea. Yea we can <br/>
&gt;&gt;do that&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;big sigh&gt;<br/>
Everytime I open to door after the dishes are put away I see........<br/>
Big lids on little pots, little lids IN big pots, big pans on top of little <br/>
pans. I can never find anything.<br/>
WHY CAN&#39;T THEY DO AS I SAY?!?!?!?!&lt;stomping foot&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh gosh, this is my husband and  me. LOL! He&#39;s the organized one in the <br/>
kitchen. I do more of the clean up and tossing in a cabinet. ;-) After <br/>
almost 18 years of marriage, he&#39;s given up on stomping his foot. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to point out that even we adults can be thick as a brick <br/>
sometimes. Ooh...time for some Tull.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
