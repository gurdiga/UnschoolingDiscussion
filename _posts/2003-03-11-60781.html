UPDATE:  <br/>
2nd Annual Spring HOMESCHOOLERS&#39; OVERNIGHT CAMPS   <br/>
April 26 - May 7 (12 days), Louisa County, Virginia    <br/>
Oriented for ages 8-13 (parent&#39;s attendance optional)  <br/>
  <br/>
Since our May 12 Adventure Camp is full, we&#39;ve opened the April 26-<br/>
May 7 Camp as a combination Drama/Adventure. Children choose between <br/>
the two themes, and for two to four hours a day the focus will divide <br/>
<br/>
between theater and orienteering. Otherwise, meals and activities <br/>
will be shared by the whole group.<br/>
<br/>
Children choose their theme of interest:  <br/>
DRAMA  Theater games,  practicing and performing a play for an <br/>
audience.  <br/>
ORIENTEERING:  Learn the exciting sport of land navigation using maps <br/>
and compasses.  <br/>
<br/>
Whole group activities may include: Canoeing, swimming,  <br/>
cookouts,  cooperative   games, field games (such as soccer, <br/>
capture the flag, badminton, croquet, volleyball)   scavenger hunts, <br/>
bird-watching, juggling, evening camp-fires/skits/singing  <br/>
<br/>

~100 people jointly own/manage land/businesses and govern <br/>
democratically. No central leader or religion. Run by a homeschool <br/>
