Last night we were out in t-shirts and shorts at 11 pm eeling in the stream in our bush. We&#39;re vegetarians, and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002024986">I&#39;m not sure where exactly you&#39;re living, Mary, city, suburb or rural?  A good place to start is always second hand stores.  I live in a city where winter lasts 6 months of the year, so even the Salvation Army carries snow shoes, skies, etc.  Sports equipment refurbishers are also really good places to get equipment, but they can still be kind of pricey, so make sure you really like the activity first.<br/>
<br/>
Patagonia has a bargain section to it&#39;s web-site.  REI&#39;s bargain site is really good.  Up here in Canada there is a chain called Mountain Equipment Co-op, they sell similar stuff to Patagonia, but much cheaper, and not as good quality.  Patagonia is made for mountain climbers and such, so most people don&#39;t need that sort of quality.  MEC is good enough for most family use.<br/>
<br/>
MEC&#39;s site is: www.mec.ca/<br/>
REI&#39;s is: www.rei.com/<br/>
Patagonia&#39;s is: www.patagonia.com/<br/>
<br/>
Churches and Rec centers will often have flea markets or swap days, around this time of year you won&#39;t get any great deals, but you can usually find something.<br/>

snow, I bought ski suits at thrift stores here, but we also went shopping at <br/>
Savers (a thrift store chain) up there, where they were castoffs of people <br/>
who lived in a really cold place--more wool, more lined stuff, lots of gloves <br/>
and mittens, compared to New Mexico where it doesn&#39;t get that cold.<br/>

I don&#39;t know where you are and what stores you have in<br/>
your area, but I found great snowpants and a down coat<br/>
at Ross and Marshall&#39;s. My friend just found an<br/>
all-in-one snowsuit at TJ Maxx. I looked for ages in<br/>
the secondhand shops but couldn&#39;t find anything to fit<br/>
(my dd is tall and thin!).<br/>

what we have here on Vancouver Island.  We&#39;ve had a lovely fall, just a<br/>
little rain and lots of sunny days.  Some of the trees have turned, but lots<br/>
are still green.  We&#39;re getting cooler nights, but the days are still<br/>

Our thermometer has been stuck on the 3-degree line now for hours.  I think <br/>
it got frozen.  We&#39;re supposed to get about a foot of snow later today and <br/>
Monday.  This is the harshest winter I can remember in a long time.<br/>

Stay warm, Shyrley ~ and everybody!<br/>

My AC is on again today. It&#39;s in the 80&#39;s here. I don&#39;t mind at all. Just <br/>
wish the pool water was warmer so I could really enjoy the heat.<br/>

I was just going to comment that heer in the Utah high country, this has <br/>
been the driest, warmest winter that people can remember. Casey was playing <br/>
outside without a coat yesterday and there was waaaay more grass than bits <br/>
of snow showing. We usually have 2-3 feet in February!<br/>
<br/>
Of course right now it is snowing kind of hard. So we&#39;ll see what happens <br/>
today.<br/>

Holly was picked up by  her friends.  The girl who came to the door was <br/>
wearing shorts.  <br/>
Holly wore shorts last night when we went to Hollywood Video at 9:30 p.m.  <br/>
She asked me if she should wear a jacket so people wouldn&#39;t be grumpy and <br/>
call social services.  I said she should grab her Levi jacket.  So she put <br/>
that over the little summery sleeveless shirt she had on.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not right.<br/>

alarming, no?  But the Earth has her cycles, I guess, and we&#39;re just <br/>
subject to them.<br/>

<br/>
Note to Mary Bianco:  You have been exempted from &quot;stay warm&quot; in your <br/>
80-degree weather.  Have you thought of getting a solar heater for your <br/>
pool so you can enjoy it in this kind of weather.  That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to <br/>
do for the summertime.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166022592">I don&#39;t want to hear about any warm weather right now.  Yesterday morning<br/>
when I got up at 7:30, it was -21 degress.  (yes that was a minus!)  Today<br/>
it was a balmy -10 below.  Course it warmed up into the single digits, so I<br/>
guess I shouldn&#39;t complain.  30 degrees would be a heat wave right now.<br/>

<br/>
 Angela ~ who doesn&#39;t usually complain about the weather, but this is<br/>
getting ridiculous.<br/>
