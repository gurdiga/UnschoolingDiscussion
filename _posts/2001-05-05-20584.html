&lt;&lt; I looked at quite a few universities without walls, and graduated from the <br/>
external degree program of an Ohio university. I designed my own program, <br/>
found my own resources, had a committee to review my work with me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     Does anyone know of a comprehensive list of these kinds of colleges?  I <br/>
know Goddard in Vermont has this kind of thing and there is another college <br/>
near them that is similar.  I would like to know about all of the colleges <br/>
like this and their programs.  <br/>

Lucy--when I did this--in the late 70&#39;s, I checked out the Union of Experimenting Colleges and Universities, in OH. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re still around.  I looked into several colleges--some that I remember are Friends&#39; World College, Bard College, SkidmoreCollege, Roger Williams College. I wonder if Antioch College inYellow Springs might have resources?<br/>
You might try a search on alternative education.<br/>
I started with the UECU, but they merged with Capital University in Columbus, OH ,and I opted to go with Capital. (at the time their accreditation seemed important?????) I do know that many colleges are tapping into the adult learner market and that hey have developed external or adult degree programs.<br/>
 Taking control of my own education was and is empowering. What I did was relevant to me and incredibly interesting!!!<br/>
