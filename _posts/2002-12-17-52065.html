<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dd wrote letters to legislators telling him why she thinks the<br/>
&gt; homeschool law should be changed, but she wrote it on bright pink<br/>
&gt; postcards and it didn&#39;t photocopy well.  I didn&#39;t have the heart to<br/>
&gt; ask her to re-write just for the portfolio, but wouldn&#39;t that have<br/>
&gt; been a cool thing to include? lol<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whose idea is this stupid portfolio, anyhow?  Who cares it they didn&#39;t copy<br/>
well, that&#39;s a big piece of what she did.  Just toss them in and let the<br/>
powers that be cope with it!<br/>
