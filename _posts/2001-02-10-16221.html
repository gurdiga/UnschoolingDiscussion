&gt; Wow.  I&#39;m not sure how I would react to a friend or family lied to me, I<br/>
&gt; guess it would depend on the circumstances.  I have broken off friendships<br/>
&gt; because of events which involved lying but they also involved cruelty and<br/>
&gt; spite so dishonesty was only a symptom of bigger problems.<br/>

I know how I react to a family member lying to me, I get mad.<br/>
I lived with it for too long, one son was picking it up getting him grounded<br/>
for up to<br/>
two months at a time, he eventually figured out that lying to me was a<br/>
bigger crime than telling the truth and having me find out his misdeeds<br/>
first hand from him.<br/>
<br/>
I listened as my step-father lied about my bruises etc, I listened as my ex<br/>
contradicted himself in a single sentence, never sure in the end which part<br/>
of his stories was the truth.   It wasn&#39;t ever on anything of any real<br/>
importance, just little lies, in some ways that made it worse.<br/>
