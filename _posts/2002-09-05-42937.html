<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662974635">&lt;&lt;what does your trail mix have in it?  Is there nothing cooked?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has various nuts and seeds, raw not roasted.  The only thing close to<br/>
being cooked are the raisins having been dehydrated.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to avoid the processing and the cooking.  I had heard of people<br/>
who only ate foods that could be eaten raw before, but then our local paper<br/>
did a big story and it really interested me.  So I decided to try it and<br/>
have loved the results so far....more energy, sleeping better, feeling less<br/>
puffy and stiff.<br/>
