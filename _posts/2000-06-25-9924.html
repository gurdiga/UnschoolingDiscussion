&lt;&lt; We have a very low standard of living, if you go by government levels, but<br/>
 we never want for anything.  We choose not to eat out, go to movies, buy<br/>
 expensive clothes, or give expensive gifts, among other things.  We *do*<br/>
 have plenty of healthful food, clothes on our bodies, and lots of free<br/>
 things to do.  There is nothing wrong with having a low standard of living,<br/>
 so I really don&#39;t feel too sorry for the people you mentioned.  I know one<br/>
 can live quite fine at poverty level!<br/>
<br/>
**Not all of us are called to this monastic life style, though.  Would you <br/>
say we should never have children?  Or that there might possibly be other <br/>
ways to live? <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  In addition, with the increased computer industry, it is becoming easier<br/>
 for parents to find a job that allows them to be at home most or all of the<br/>
 time.  It might not be easy, but it is possible.<br/>
<br/>
**Not all of us are called to be self-employed.  Or work from home.  But can <br/>
only function and flourish as employees in a more traditional setting.  Would <br/>
you say all office workers or factory workers or teachers or store managers <br/>
or anyone who is not working out of their home should not have children?  Or <br/>
would you consider that there might be some other way to live that is <br/>
workable for those who work outside the home?  Perhaps not the current <br/>
structure but something in between or instead of or in addition to.  Could <br/>
there possibly be more than one way to look at this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I do not have a &quot;harsh, judgemental attitude&quot; towards working moms.  I am<br/>
 calling a wrong a wrong.  It is wrong to leave babies and children in the<br/>
 care of others in order to pursue ones own desires.<br/>
<br/>
*** Well, you may not feel or think that your opinions come across as harsh <br/>
and judgemental but I can assure you that they do.  Your first sentence is in <br/>
fact belied by the next two.  I think it is ever so important, perhaps so <br/>
much more so in email communication, to repeatedly state when we are giving <br/>
our opinions.  Otherwise statements like the ones you make in the paragraph <br/>
above do come across as strident and not as if you are truly trying to <br/>
communicate and listen as well as speak.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Is there anything you would call wrong?  Murder?  Thievery? Pollution?<br/>
 Anything?  Are you being judgemental  when you call a behavior wrong?  Think<br/>
 about that before you start throwing labels around.<br/>
 <br/>
 Dia &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
** There are many things, Dia, that I personally would call wrong.  On the <br/>
other hand, there are probably many things in my life that others would find <br/>
wrong.  They might even assert that my lifestyle is in some way harming my <br/>
children.  For instance, we homeschool.  For instance, we do not go to any <br/>
sort of church and are in fact atheists.  For instance, we watch TV.  For <br/>
instance, we openly discuss different lifestyles.  The list goes on.  There <br/>
are many ways in my one little life that I could possibly be accused, by the <br/>
right sort of person, of being wrong and doing harm to my children.<br/>
<br/>
We are all in the same boat.  I could say that X activity on your part is a <br/>
&quot;bad&quot; thing and therefore &quot;harms&quot; your children.  Very easy to accuse.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I could say that you just don&#39;t have enough $$ to provide the <br/>
education I think in my vast wisdom :) you should be providing for your <br/>
children.  And you have made this deliberate choice.  You could be working <br/>
and earning more $$ and sending the little ones to just the &quot;right&quot; day care <br/>
and school and yet you obstinately refuse.  Therefore, I could say, you are <br/>
&quot;wrong.&quot;  Easy to accuse.  Not always easy to understand how the other person <br/>
arrived at her choices.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, if you sincerely believe that everyone should be living the <br/>
lifestyle you describe, it occurs to me that there is no more certain way to <br/>
drive off many people from even discussing that possibility than accusing <br/>
them of being &quot;wrong&quot; when it comes to their parenting choices.<br/>
<br/>
We could possibly have a discussion in this country of ways to communicate <br/>
with working moms and dads to make certain that they are aware of all of <br/>
their choices.  We could have discussions and campaigns of all sorts that <br/>
might truly inform and educate and broaden the horizons of all sorts of <br/>
people.  But it would not, imo, be a success if everyone&#39;s choices and <br/>
opinions are not respected.  We are all, presumably, adults and caring <br/>
parents, and while we may learn from one another I do not believe we should <br/>
try to dictate to the next mom how she should live and raise her children.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not call my lifestyle monastic at all.  We certainly go places and see<br/>
others, and do things, we just choose to do things that are free or low cost<br/>
instead of dropping $30 at the movie theater.  I do not know if you should<br/>
have children or not,  I don&#39;t know you.  And yes, there are other ways to<br/>
live other than the lifestyle we have chosen.  My point is that it *is<br/>
possible* to live happily at a lower economic level than is commonly<br/>
believed.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I never said that all people should be self employed.  I said that it<br/>
is an option for those who must work in order to live.  By working at home<br/>
parents can generate an income and still be available for their children.<br/>
Maybe it isn&#39;t where the parent is happiest, but then maybe daycare isn&#39;t<br/>
where the child is happiest either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are judging those who feel that children do best when there is a parent<br/>
at home with them full time.  Why is your judgement the &quot;right&quot; one?  It is<br/>
important to remember that everyone has beliefs, and we are all entitled to<br/>
those beliefs.  Your belief is not neccessarily the best one.<br/>

<br/>
When children are relegated to full time day care while mommy and daddy are<br/>
out fulfilling themselves, the children suffer for it, both emotionally and<br/>
educationally.  There are quite a few studies that have shown that the best<br/>
adjusted children, the ones who are the least likely to do drugs, wind up<br/>
pregnant, drink, or engage in other high risk behaviors, are the ones who<br/>
come from intact families with one parent at home.  That is substantiated<br/>
research, not my opinion.  Have you ever seen research that shows that kids<br/>
are harmed by homeschooling?  Or by not eating at McDonald&#39;s once a week?<br/>
Or by not watching TV?  I would guess not.  You cannot compare a choice that<br/>
harms no one (no TV) with a choice that harms someone (full time day care).<br/>
They are not the same thing at all!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excuse me?  Where did I say that I thought everyone should be iving the same<br/>
way I am???  I didn&#39;t!  I stated that it is possible to live on a lower<br/>
income.  We took a 60% paycut in order to have this lifestyle, it was a<br/>
choice that has benefited our family.  My point, again, is that the vast<br/>
majority of working mothers could live on one income, if they wanted to.<br/>
They choose not to.  I think it is sad that adults are so selfish that they<br/>
will put their wants ahead of their children&#39;s needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-773377084">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Mind if I join this tea party?   Actually I&#39;ve been imagining this whole<br/>
discussion taking place in a large kitchen, tea and coffee mugs in hand --<br/>
with our children all playing outside.<br/>
<br/>
Whew!   I wish that we had relatives or easily accessible friends and<br/>
neighbors who homeschooled nearby.  In the absence of this, from time to<br/>
time, I envision a beautiful community setting where other gifted adults<br/>
(besides myself :  ) could be with my children. *** I do believe that there<br/>
ARE people (men and women) who have a natural gift for interacting with<br/>
young people and children in supportive, playful, artistic ways!****  They<br/>
aren&#39;t all parents!<br/>
<br/>
 While I sense that my children in some way chose me and their father to be<br/>
their *main guides* in this wonderful life, I know that this is their WORLD<br/>
too and that other human beings have great things to offer.  I also know<br/>
that my children want to (even at the young ages of 5 and 8) give to their<br/>
world -- be it playing fiddle at our family yard sale or sharing the<br/>
pretzels that they bake with our local community kitchen. They devise plans<br/>
for clubs to save the world and do amazing projects -- but lack a forum to<br/>
make this a reality.  We get out a lot. We explore, regularly visit and<br/>
work at a local farm/ environmental center. We enjoy our local librarians,<br/>
and they us, I think.  But I guess what I&#39;m building up to here is that I<br/>
do believe there is a real place in my childrens&#39; life and my life for SOME<br/>
of what we think of as school and daycare. EEEEk I said it!  ---- Certainly<br/>
not all day, but a place in society to come and join in, where friends<br/>
young and old would be to share in dances, song, creating, sharing of<br/>
fascinations and play,  -- that&#39;s what I&#39;m imaging today.  And then,<br/>
(selfish me!!!) I could go for a run -- which makes me feel so energetic<br/>
and alive  -- While I&#39;m running I can think about my children with the<br/>
benefit of space and breath!<br/>
<br/>
I have friends who I admire very much who send their kids to school and<br/>
daycare -- they are very involved in those communities.  They are loving<br/>
responsive people who know their children.  Some have come right out and<br/>
said that they wish we would go to school and bring our ideas and energy.<br/>
I understand this, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be our way at this time.  It is<br/>
very hard to live outside the box.  Now that summer is here my 8 year old<br/>
has a new flock of children who can play all day!  it makes me feel like<br/>
she is missing out on something pretty special during the year.  This past<br/>
year of homeschooling has been wonderful for my girls in sooo many ways --<br/>
but it is not perfect!  I&#39;m just giving myself permission to envision what<br/>
might be -- if we could recreate the world...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening to my bit.  Maybe soon I&#39;ll chime in about all the<br/>
ways I think Feminism has improved the world.<br/>

I don&#39;t think what you are talking about is the same as parents putting<br/>
their kids in day care full time so they can go work.  It sounds like you<br/>
are talking more of a co-operative where kids and parents could get together<br/>
and share their talents.  Very different motives and outcomes!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290797612">No, of course it&#39;s not the same as putting kids in daycare full time.  I&#39;m<br/>
looking for an expansion of options.  What might really meet a variety of<br/>

not just parents who are equipped to give and receive in the scenario I<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t think what you are talking about is the same as parents putting<br/>
&gt;their kids in day care full time so they can go work.  It sounds like you<br/>
&gt;are talking more of a co-operative where kids and parents could get together<br/>
&gt;and share their talents.  Very different motives and outcomes!<br/>

Now that sounds right on target.  Openness to expanded possibilities.  <br/>
Without trying to guess at anyone else&#39;s motivation.  Just trying to <br/>
brainstorm meeting multiple needs -- and desires -- desires being part of the <br/>
mix too.  <br/>

Your vision sounds wonderful.  Maybe that&#39;s something we will be working <br/>
towards in the future when the others get burned out on working 50 hours a <br/>
week for someone else and seeing how it does nothing to benefit the growth of <br/>
their own and their childrens souls.<br/>

     We also choose to live this way because we value our time much more than <br/>
the majority of these &quot;fun&quot; things.  There are many beliefs that I have for <br/>
my family, things that I truly do believe in, yet do not feel right <br/>
condemning others for just because they are feel differently.  <br/>
     For example, I am sick of reading about the massive industrial hog farms <br/>
ruining portions of states like North Carolina, so I choose to not buy pork.  <br/>
I am also sick of reading about the chickens with their beaks cut off living <br/>
their entire lives in 12&quot; by 12&quot; boxes so I buy free range eggs.  So I can <br/>
say that I feel it is wrong for me to buy certain products.   But most of the <br/>
people I know do buy these products.  At times, if the issue comes up, I will <br/>
explain my convictions to them so some of them are aware of the reasons.  Yet <br/>
I am not going to condemn them for making different choices and I believe <br/>
that an intolerant, judgemental attitude only makes them less apt to consider <br/>
another point of view.<br/>
     Certainly there are things that I consider very wrong, such as murder.  <br/>
But I also think about when Jesus says, &quot;Get the rafter out of your own eye <br/>
before trying to get the straw out of your brother&#39;s.&quot;  I believe this is a <br/>
great illustration no matter what someone&#39;s religious beliefs are.  Few of us <br/>
(or none) are doing everything right yet we want mercy for ourselves and <br/>
judgement for the other person.  Sadly, it&#39;s an all too human flaw.<br/>
     I do believe that it is wise for a person to take a look at his/her <br/>
choices and ask whether they are in effect choosing material goods over other <br/>
things that have so much more value, such as time with kids.  I&#39;m not far off <br/>
from your thinking in application to my personal life.  I just think that it <br/>
doesn&#39;t make us better people or better examples if we come across as being <br/>
too self-righteous.<br/>

kids in instituitional care.  The issue was brought up, I wrote what I<br/>
believe, and why.  Most people disagree with my belief.   I have not<br/>
condemned anyone, called anyone names, or used hateful words.  I have stated<br/>
facts (full time day care is detrimental to the development of children),<br/>
and I have stated my opinion about these facts (it is wrong to put ones own<br/>
desires before a child&#39;s needs).  Why is this offensive?<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; another point of view.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you tell someone that the chickens that laid their eggs are inhumanely<br/>
treated and you buy only free range eggs, despite the exhorbitant cost, then<br/>
you are making a judgement.  You have *judged* that free range eggs are<br/>
superior to commercially produced ones.  Is that bad?  No, we make<br/>
judgements daily about what we buy, do, don&#39;t buy, or don&#39;t do.  But your<br/>
judgement could very easily make someone angry, because it would appear that<br/>
you believe you are a more caring and compassionate person than someone who<br/>
doesn&#39;t care that chickens are kept caged.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, inhumane conditions are the *least* reason not to buy store eggs.  You<br/>
don&#39;t even want to know what is in those chickens!  And I won&#39;t even go into<br/>
the commercial hog producers.  What they raise isn&#39;t even meat!)<br/>
<br/>
I am not asking for mercy about my beliefs, nor am I asking anyone not to<br/>
judge me.  I am well aware of my own failings as a person and as a mother.<br/>
I have never claimed to be the best at anything!  Jesus told us to &quot;remove<br/>
the log before you try to remove the splinter in your brother&#39;s eye&quot;.  This<br/>
was referring to the human ability to see a sin in another&#39;s life without<br/>
acknowledging the same sin in our own life.  Is this what you were referring<br/>
to?  Do you then beleive that because I am against mothers abandoning their<br/>
children, then I must also be guilty of the same thing?  I am not sure what<br/>
you meant by your remark.<br/>

<br/>
     I am not saying we don&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t form judgements about issues.  But <br/>
if I took this belief and then said that people who refuse to buy free range <br/>
eggs are selfish, don&#39;t care about the environment, ignorant, etc., THAT to <br/>
me would be an uncalled for judgment.  If I feel morally superior to them <br/>
because I am making a choice I believe in, that would be self righteous in my <br/>
opinion.  Yes, there will be times that we DO do this, such as with people <br/>
who are doing things that are universally recognized as wrong (selling their <br/>
children for drugs, for example).  But if we do it with every choice that we <br/>
disagree with, choices that many people have made and that are considered <br/>
acceptable, I think it comes across as very intolerant.<br/>
     I believe we can have a belief on an issue without judging the people <br/>
harshly who have a different belief.  Another example...I believe it is a <br/>
contradiction for a person to say he/she is a Christian but believe in going <br/>
to war.  I will delve into that belief or explain it to anyone but I am not <br/>
going to make the jump to saying that people who claim to be Christian and go <br/>
to war are hypocrites, evil, whatever.  <br/>
     As for the statement by Jesus about the log, I believe that applies to <br/>
more than just a person doing the exact same sin that he&#39;s accusing his <br/>
brother of.  We are all filled with flaws, struggling along, doing all kinds <br/>
of things wrong which we may not recognize at the time.  I believe the point <br/>
of that scripture is that we should work on ourselves rather than focusing on <br/>
what someone else is doing wrong.  Another similar example would be when they <br/>
caught the woman committing adultery and he said, &quot;Let him that is without <br/>
sin cast the first stone.&quot;  (Didn&#39;t mean to get into a major religious thing <br/>
here!)<br/>
