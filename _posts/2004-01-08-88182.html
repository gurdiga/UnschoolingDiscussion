<div id="ygrps-yiv-346441092">Hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;m trying to catch up on posts - had the baby on Christmas Day...first baby<br/>
born in the hospital on Xmas...<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
I have a question - we have a membership with HSLDA and we live in<br/>
California -- here&#39;s my concern...HSLDA requires us to be with an ISP - but<br/>
since we&#39;re unschooling, we don&#39;t use a curriculum....<br/>
So how do we get around belonging to an ISP?<br/>
Any unschoolers in CA that can give me a few pointers?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

  Congratulations on the birth of your new baby!<br/>
<br/>
  Mine may not be the kind of answer you are looking for...but here goes...<br/>
  How about not being a member of HSLDA?  It&#39;s not something you have to do.<br/>
<br/>
  Here are some links you may want to check out.  <br/>

  Maybe you already know all this and would still like to be a member of HSLDA...in that case I&#39;m not sure how you get around the ISP part.<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck!<br/>

But, they don&#39;t require you to be with an ISP. You can file an R4 and <br/>
be your own private school.<br/>
<br/>
Go to &lt;www.hsc.org&gt;  -- all the information you could possibly need is <br/>
there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091973264">Pam already gave the first thought that came into my head - drop out of<br/>
HSLDA. Requiring an ISP is going very far beyond what is required by the<br/>
State of California, and I second Pam&#39;s recommendation of looking at the<br/>
regulations at hsc.org. Don&#39;t let HSLDA make you feel afraid of unschooling<br/>
in California (or anywhere else!). Since we are without testing or any kind<br/>
of evaluations, we are one of the easystates to unschool in. Having said<br/>
that, there are &quot;umbrella&quot; schools in CA that exist entirely for<br/>
administrative purposes, as against providing curriculum materials.<br/>
