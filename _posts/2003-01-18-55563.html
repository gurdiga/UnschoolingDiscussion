<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301518682">Here&#39;s a good unschooling story from my house today.<br/>
<br/>
Breakfast is Tim&#39;s thinking time, I&#39;ve decided.  I eat my breakfast and get<br/>
on with cleaning up the living room/dining room area.  Tim sits there an<br/>
plays with his food.  I&#39;ve quite hassling him about finishing it up already,<br/>
and mornings have become more relaxed.  (Food was has been my hangup...)<br/>
<br/>
So, over the last of his breakfast, Tim was talking about gravity and<br/>
considering what would happen if his &quot;personal gravity shifted&quot;.  Like if he<br/>
was affected differently by gravity, either more or less.  It was an<br/>
interesting monologue; my input was merely to laugh at the fun ideas he came<br/>
up with, and wonder silently when the heck he learned about gravity.<br/>
<br/>
It just occurred to me this evening after he went to bed where he learned<br/>
about gravity: Calvin and Hobbs comic books.  So from reading cartoons, he<br/>
discovered a scientific concept, considered how it affects his life, and<br/>
imagined how a change of it would change his life.  Not bad for a comic<br/>
book!  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I oughta buy him another one.<br/>

<br/>
One of Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s books deals with &quot;variable gravity.&quot;  <br/>
Slapstick.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably not a good book to recommend to just anybody, as the repeated <br/>
byline is <br/>
&quot;Take a flying f*** at a rolling donut; <br/>
taking a flying f*** at the moon.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But other than THAT &lt;g&gt; it&#39;s humor and philosophy and light science fiction.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of my favorite books ever.<br/>
<br/>
On heavy gravity days, the elevators had all crashed down and broken.  Much <br/>
of civilization has fallen because gravity sometimes is so heavy that people <br/>
just lie on the ground and can&#39;t walk.  But on light gravity days, people <br/>
piled cars into pyramids, and the main character says Washington threw a <br/>
silver dollar across the Potomac, but on a light gravity day, he can throw a <br/>
manhole cover across.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds fun.  I think the only Kurt Vonnegut book I&#39;ve ever read is Slaughter<br/>
House 5, which put me off him for a long time.  Required reading for a<br/>
literature course.  I wonder how many other authors have been ruined for<br/>
people reading them when they didn&#39;t wanna.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check the library for it.<br/>

<br/>
I tried and couldn&#39;t finish it.  VERY dark.<br/>
<br/>
Slapstick isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I liked Breakfast of Champions, too, for the Kilgore Trout stories.  <br/>
Not as happy as Slapstick, but still silly/goofy/philosophical.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074607762">Speaking of comics and Far Side,<br/>
 <br/>
My kids love the book _There&#39;s a Hair in My Dirt_ by Gary Larson.      It&#39;s hilarious,  tons of stuff on biology, environmental issues,  bugs, animals..etc..<br/>
 <br/>
All told by a father worm whose son is sick of eating dirt..this is the son--<br/>
        &quot;I hate being a worm!&quot; he screeched, his tiny body trembling.  &quot;We&#39;re the lowest of the low!  Bottom of the food chain!  Bird food!  Fish bait! What kind of life is this, anyway?  We never go swimming or camping or hiking or anything!  Shoot, we never even go to the surface unless the rains flood us out!  All we ever do is crawl around in the stupid ground.  Oh, and how can I forget?  We eat dirt!  Dirt for breakfast, dirt for lunch, and dirt for dinner!  Dirt, dirt, dirt!  And look--now there&#39;s even a hair in my dirt!  The final insult--I can&#39;t stand it any longer!   I HATE BEING A WORM!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Fun book!<br/>
