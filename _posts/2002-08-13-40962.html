<div id="ygrps-yiv-705043786">Ok, I know this is completely off topic.....BUT<br/>
While reading this post I just couldn&#39;t help but reach over my head and<br/>
grab<br/>
my ear!  Am I insane?  (be nice &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Actually I find that when reading books I sorta act out some things, for<br/>
<br/>
example if I read a passage that says &quot;David scowled...&quot;  I may find<br/>
myself<br/>
making a scowling type face.  Anyone else does this or notice this about<br/>
<br/>
someone else?!?!?!  Please tell me I am not alone!<br/>
<br/>
Zan<br/>
<br/>
Definitely not alone Zan - I did exactly the same thing!  When I would<br/>
feed my babies, I was told that I opened my mouth wide and made the same<br/>
faces they were making.  My husband says that sometimes he just watches<br/>
me while I read because he thinks it&#39;s hysterical.<br/>
Kate<br/>
So many faces to make, so little time</div>
