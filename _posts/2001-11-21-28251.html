&gt; hard, that they don&#39;t know enough, that the kids need socializing, or <br/>
&gt; (the saddest &quot;reason&quot; of all) that they couldn&#39;t stand being around <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I changed how I responded to the last one when I realized that sometimes it <br/>
was being said by people I really respected and knew were very good parents.  <br/>
What I started to see in many instances (not all, alas...some parents <br/>
genuinely don&#39;t like their kids much) was that the idea of spending most of <br/>
their time with their kids HOW IT LOOKS NOW sounded awful.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it...if your kids are in school, a day can look like this: rush <br/>
and nag to get everyone out on time with everything they need, spend a day <br/>
apart, then fight about homework, etc. Feed, bathe, and get to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of being horrified, I now explain that when you homeschool, things <br/>
look different. I don&#39;t HAVE to nag and rush Julian out or to bed...we no <br/>
longer have to fight about homework. If we do have a conflict, we have time <br/>
to work it out. Our relationship is better because we have time to give it <br/>
the attention it needs.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s neat is that I find that parents seem to respond to that most--more <br/>
than socialization, or being able to teach astrophysics, or organization <br/>
deficits. Parents WANT to like their kids, and I think they&#39;re sad when they <br/>
find themselves unable to. Here&#39;s a chance!<br/>
