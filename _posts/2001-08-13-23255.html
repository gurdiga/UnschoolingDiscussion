<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876337942">Just a question for the other parents of<br/>
hyper/sensative kids.  Is it just me, or do you all<br/>
HATE it when other people (family, friends,<br/>
acquaintances, strangers) either ask with body<br/>
language, indirectly, or directly, &quot;Why do you let<br/>
them act like that?&quot;  More or less.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, Yes, we train them that way.  We instruct them<br/>
carefully at home to orchestrate their behavior when<br/>
we are out or around other people.  We work hard to<br/>
get them this surly, nasty and obnoxious on occassion.<br/>
 sheesh.<br/>
