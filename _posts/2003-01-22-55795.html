&lt;&lt; Okay, Sandra, I can go read what you&#39;ve written, but let&#39;s hear what you <br/>
are<br/>
thinking, after reading my plea for other perspectives...c&#39;mon, it&#39;s a great<br/>
moment for a Sandra-ism :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking I already wrote about school options, and that I don&#39;t want to <br/>
read the whole digest to find the original question.<br/>
<br/>
Sandraisms can&#39;t be forced out, they have to just pop out when I&#39;m not trying <br/>
to think of something directly.   Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
There have been three.  I should retire now.  <br/>
