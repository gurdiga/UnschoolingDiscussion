<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987777457">I remember (on this list :)), protesting guns, could not understand how you <br/>
could PLAY with a gun, blah,blah,blah :) My son is into cowboys, now wears <br/>
his play guns around the house along with his western attire, hat spurs, <br/>
etc. He doesn&#39;t wear them (guns) to the store just here, so Sandra was <br/>
right, (shocker :)), he did find out about them without me, and he enjoys <br/>
them so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301656642">For me personally, I would not have guns in the house of any type. I haven&#39;t <br/>
had the issue come up yet, as Lelia was never interested in them, and Quinton <br/>
is only 2. I can&#39;t see us buying him any at any point in the future. Every <br/>
family has different things that they just don&#39;t have in their house. . .for <br/>
us, guns is definitely in that category.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629716883">my friends and family loves this discussion<br/>
&quot;all boys play guns&quot;<br/>
or the hunter father-in-law<br/>
two close friends have taken the why bother attitude because they find a substitute<br/>
I&#39;ve chosen to keep the no gun rules<br/>
we tried &quot;water&quot; guns when they were received as gifts but I replaced them with squirt bottles<br/>
they do use airplane and rubber band launchers that are just a long piece of wood<br/>
our oldest son never tested our authority on this but the younger still has to be reminded that &quot;we don&#39;t play guns&quot;<br/>
great question, cant wait to read responses<br/>

<h4>Saga</h4>
<p><small><time>28 Aug 2001, at  6:31pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128967292">We don&#39;t allow guns in the house right now.  DH thinks this is silly, he<br/>
grew up in a no-gun household (they played with squirt bottles instead of<br/>
water pistols, etc... that is, until they got into the star wars figures and<br/>
star trek phasers), but I didn&#39;t want to corrupt our son&#39;s innocence, so<br/>
attempted to shield him from anything with a gun.  No commercials, movie<br/>
previews, Star Trek, though he did watch Star Wars a while back - but he was<br/>
only 18 months old (I wonder if that&#39;s what did it!).  Never use the word<br/>
gun around him.  Nothing.<br/>
So he plays, with his cars, or his wand that we made, or a random stick from<br/>
outside, and makes shooting/spitting sounds like a gun, and he calls it a<br/>
&quot;figther&quot; (since he doesn&#39;t know the word gun).  Where did he get this from?<br/>
I can&#39;t say it&#39;s because he&#39;s a boy - how did boy genes get guns so quickly,<br/>
(of course, I could say something about the male chromosomes and their<br/>
ability to mutate quickly, but I won&#39;t :p ).  I would think he would have<br/>
picked up swordplay or something like that.<br/>
And swords will be allowed in our home, we&#39;re looking at having someone make<br/>
him a wood sword and shield, as we&#39;re into the whole medieval thing, but<br/>
also into the respect and beauty part in there as well, not as a weapon for<br/>
killing, but as an artform.  But we weren&#39;t going to introduce that to him<br/>
until he was older, and when he showed interest (if he showed interest).<br/>
But for now we hid all our weapons (we have a knife collection) and still,<br/>
he is into &quot;fighter&quot;s.  When asked more about these things, he says it makes<br/>
&quot;little tiny holes&quot; in people and things for fighting.<br/>
Who knows, he picked it up somewhere, thats for sure.  Makes me sort of sad,<br/>
but also searching for ways for him to express such things appropriately.<br/>
Finding better hero models for him that will hopefully be better than what<br/>
is readily available today (batman, superman, all those crappy after school<br/>
cartoons...).  Was thinking of Robin Hood, Arthurian legend, more archetypal<br/>
things.  Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
And since we have our daughter, Sheherazade, we were thinking of looking for<br/>
good Arabian Nights books for kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31416110">My son started &quot;shooting guns&quot; very early. Long before he<br/>
could understand what a gun is.<br/>
We teach him what guns are used for (He will be 3 in Oct.).<br/>
If he points a gun at a person, the gun is taken away, and<br/>
he has to earn it back. If he points it again, the gun is<br/>
broken.  Grandpa, keeps getting him toy guns, so breaking<br/>
doesnt do much for him!!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; i just wondered what other parents did or thought about children playing with<br/>
&gt; guns. not real guns, but toy guns. we had a no gun rule then my son turned<br/>
&gt; everything into a gun and so it turned into a don&#39;t point it at anyone rule.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have real guns. My husband is a competition target shooter. My daughters<br/>
have seen him shoot, practice dry-firing (target shooting with no bullets in<br/>
the gun - a muscle-memory sort of training), and clean the guns regularly,<br/>
so they know what safe handling looks like.<br/>
<br/>
If either of the girls wants to learn to handle real guns when they are<br/>
older, my husband will teach them.<br/>
<br/>
So while Brit *does* &quot;play guns&quot; with squirt guns, etc. (not really that<br/>
often, I was exaggerating to be humorously pointed that many/most<br/>
unschooling kids aren&#39;t different in that they discuss Greek Mythology over<br/>
Pokemon) she plays with them very safely. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen her<br/>
point them at a living creature, person or otherwise. If she did, I would<br/>
encourage her not to and tell her why (because someone might think it&#39;s<br/>
real, because pretending to shoot at a real person -- or cat or dog or<br/>
hamster -- might frighten them and isn&#39;t good for her, either. And I would<br/>
not have toy guns that look like real guns around - I think it teaches bad<br/>
habits, and if a tragedy with a cop shooting a kid because he&#39;s pointing a<br/>
weapon is going to happen, it&#39;s more likely going to happen when the kid<br/>
points a real-looking gun.<br/>

What will you do if/when your children make a gun by pointing an index finger <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491325659">My son is a gun nut.  Since he was in diapers, he has been fascinated by<br/>
them.  He is now 8 and the fascination continues.  We decided that it was<br/>
better to try to guide his fascination than to attempt vainly to squash it.<br/>
I am now a card carrying member of the NRA.  My husband goes hunting and<br/>
talks with Zach about safety and ethics.  Zach has a BB gun that he uses for<br/>
targets and we are looking into a shooting sports club through the local<br/>
4-H.<br/>
<br/>
I firmly believe that guns are not the problem in this country.  It is much<br/>
harder for a kid to get a gun now than it was 50 years ago, but for the most<br/>
part, kids have less sense.  What I mean is that they have not been allowed<br/>
to see the consequences of their actions, they do not see animals die in<br/>
order that the kid might eat.  What they see associated with guns is power<br/>
and glorification through the media.  Just my two cents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091671612">wow, all the feedback really gets the wheels turning. i have let him play <br/>
swords, thinking that fencing could be an art, but he&#39;s not thinking art when <br/>
he plays them. he&#39;s probably thinking the same thing he&#39;s thinking when he <br/>
points his french fry at me. the other day at the park he and another boy <br/>
were playing swords with their sticks, and i intervened and said to please <br/>
stop fighting, they were bummed. then i heard another mother tell her son to <br/>
put down a stick, he wasn&#39;t even allowed to hold them or play with them as <br/>
sticks. so it got my wheels turning with the swords, then guns.<br/>
<br/>
so, it seems that on most topics around here except ps, the general consensus <br/>
is to relax....i&#39;m hoping this gets easier.<br/>

used with care and in the proper manner. Most children would be taught<br/>
proper use and safety.<br/>

&gt; My son is a gun nut.  Since he was in diapers, he has been fascinated by<br/>
&gt; them.  He is now 8 and the fascination continues.  We decided that it was<br/>
&gt; better to try to guide his fascination than to attempt vainly to squash<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; I am now a card carrying member of the NRA.  My husband goes hunting and<br/>
&gt; talks with Zach about safety and ethics.  Zach has a BB gun that he uses<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; targets and we are looking into a shooting sports club through the local<br/>
&gt; 4-H.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I firmly believe that guns are not the problem in this country.  It is<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; harder for a kid to get a gun now than it was 50 years ago, but for the<br/>
most<br/>
&gt; part, kids have less sense.  What I mean is that they have not been<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963784071">Another place to avoid having toy guns in a car, Road<br/>
Rage being an unfortunate, but real, problem.  A toy<br/>
gun cannot be id&#39;ed as only a toy from another<br/>
vehicle. <br/>
<br/>
My DSs all played with toy guns. With the first DS I<br/>
thought we would  avoid gun play, but DS#1 constructed<br/>
his own at about 18 months. Oh well. I bought him a<br/>
water pistol when he asked for it.  They all had toy<br/>
water pistols, cap guns, rubber band guns and at 7 or<br/>
8 a BB gun, then at about 12, a rifle. My youngest<br/>
DS#4, 7, has a BB gun, now.  And recently bought<br/>
himself a cleverly made toy pop-gun.  He does know the<br/>
difference, and when his little niece and nephew<br/>
visited recently, he did not even allow them in the<br/>
room where his guns were because they were too little<br/>
and inexperienced to know how to behave...in his<br/>
opinion. <br/>
<br/>
None of my DSs cares to hunt. The older DSs have at<br/>
different times shot chicken eating &#39;possums, rabid<br/>
coon&#39;s, vicious feral dogs, and watermoccasins, and<br/>
animals that have been hit (beyond recovery) by<br/>
vehicles (dogs, deer)...other people driving, of<br/>
course!<br/>
<br/>
My brothers played WAR games as children, complete<br/>
with blood curdling screams and explosion sound<br/>
effects. One is now an EMT, the other a building<br/>
contractor. Neither hunts, but did as teens. Neither<br/>
are criminals nor abusive to their families. <br/>

Perhaps the invention for battle was the same, but nobody kills a deer with a <br/>
sword.  Swords aren&#39;t used for killing food at all.  Guns are.<br/>
<br/>
In the hunting for food lineage, guns replaced bows and arrows.  So guns have <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;We let ours play with water guns, toy guns, cap<br/>
&gt; &gt; pistols, rubber band guns,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;potato guns (that was weird)...  and the rule was<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t point it at anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;who&#39;s not playing.   Now that they&#39;re old enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they could easily<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;developed an interest in real guns (15, 12, New<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mexico), they have never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;asked for so much as a BB gun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495168774">My two year old loves his older brothers laser tag gun.  It makes a <br/>
fun noise when you &quot;shoot&quot; it.  The whole family plays along with him <br/>
when we get &quot;shot&quot;, like we have been hit by a jolt of electricity or <br/>
something, because of the cool noise it makes.  It looks nothing like <br/>
a real gun though. He has played with other toy guns but always goes <br/>
back to his cars and trucks and planes.<br/>

replaced them with squirt bottles<br/>

&gt; our oldest son never tested our authority on this but the younger <br/>
still has to be reminded that &quot;we don&#39;t play guns&quot;<br/>
&gt; great question, cant wait to read responses<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857441864">&lt;&lt;swords aren&#39;t used to kill food at all&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Correct.  I was actually being less specific, in that the use for a sword<br/>
and a gun both are killing in general.  You make mention of the martial arts<br/>
using weapons, such as kendo.  I wonder how the experience of the kendo or<br/>
fencing practitioner differs, if at all, from the student of shooting sports<br/>
such as skeet, fast draw, etc.?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513484573">The shooters in at least two, maybe three of the school shooting <br/>
incidents were taught the proper care and use of guns.  They had been <br/>
raised with guns and the guns were &quot;tools&quot; in those families.  They <br/>
had been hunting and they had seen that death was the result of <br/>
pointing and shooting those guns.<br/>
