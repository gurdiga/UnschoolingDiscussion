<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373673968"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot;Nicoletta Manns&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:snmanns@...">snmanns@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aletha Solter says that even young babies experience stress, toddlers<br/>
&gt; even more so. I don&#39;t think we can argue that point. She goes on to<br/>
&gt; say, however, and this is where some people cringe, that<br/>
&gt; babies/toddlers/children need to be allowed to cry and rage to<br/>
&gt; release these stresses from their bodies. She says that babies who<br/>
&gt; have not released stress may use nursing as a &quot;control pattern&quot; to<br/>
&gt; suppress their upset feelings and that it can lead to further control<br/>
&gt; pattern later in life, in other words: addictive behaviours like<br/>
&gt; smoking, drinking, over eating, watching too much TV, being on the<br/>
&gt; computer too much :-) etc....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do agree that as people in our culture we seem to be very concerned with<br/>
keeping kids quiet and not allowing them to express their feelings. I really<br/>
like the &quot;How to talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk&quot;<br/>
series of books for this reason, they talk about naming the child&#39;s feelings<br/>
without judging and I&#39;ve found that works really well for my kids (even my<br/>
baby). If they are upset I will help them to understand what is happening<br/>
without putting a judgement on it, e.g. &quot;You sound very angry&quot;, or &quot;that<br/>
made you sad and made you feel like really crying&quot;. OTOH, we also do set<br/>
limits on where/when this is acceptable. It is not acceptable to rage/cry in<br/>
a movie theatre for instance where others are trying to hear the movie.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I think that nursing is a fine comfort and that babies/toddlers/kids<br/>
will take exactly as much of it as they personally need. My son is a big<br/>
comfort nurser and that&#39;s how he tends to want to resolve things, nurse and<br/>
snuggle. My daughter is not, she would rather rage or bang her head against<br/>
a wall to show me how mad she is. Only when she&#39;s truly over the rage or<br/>
sadness will she nurse or even let me touch her. They each know what they<br/>
need in order to deal with overwhelming emotions, I just need to trust in<br/>
that. I don&#39;t believe that nursing leads to addictive behavior, indeed I<br/>
feel the opposite. A need unmet shows up over and over in life. My<br/>
generation (born in the 60&#39;s) is probably the least-breastfed generation of<br/>
Americans ever, and we have huge problems with addictive behavior. Only 20%<br/>
of us were breastfed at all, most of them for only a few weeks, yet as a<br/>
generation we seem to have overhwhelming addictions to alcohol, cigarettes,<br/>
gambling, drugs, shopping, watching TV, etc.. If Solter&#39;s theory were<br/>
correct, I would think you would find the opposite. My own anecdotal<br/>
evidence suggests that Solter&#39;s theory is backwards. My husband and one of<br/>
his brothers were the only ones breastfed out of 7 children, and the only<br/>
ones without any addictions (the others are alcoholic, obese, addicted to<br/>
gambling, etc.). I was breastfed for over a year and suffer no addictions<br/>
that I know of. I only know a few adults who were nursed for longer than a<br/>
year or two, but all of them seem to be remarkably well-adjusted<br/>
individuals. So, although I know this is purely anecdotal, I find it hard to<br/>
believe these theories, especially coupled with the societal evidence I<br/>
mentioned before.<br/>
<br/>
I find that following your baby&#39;s lead with how they need to resolve things<br/>
(whether that is a need for nursing, holding, cuddling, or just standing<br/>
there in loving silence while they get it all out) is probably a better<br/>
guide than anything, and that leads directly into following your child&#39;s<br/>
lead with learning, and them being able to follow their own lead with<br/>
regards to life.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  If Solter&#39;s theory were<br/>

<br/>
    I find that each approach has it&#39;s merits and perhaps all of them go a <br/>
bit too far with their theories. Ultimately we need to be authentic with our <br/>
children and tune in to each unique child and each situation. I too am needy <br/>
and have addictive tendencies. I know that part of the reason is not having <br/>
been nursed or nurtured enough as a baby. On the other hand I found Solter&#39;s <br/>
approach to be useful when my son was an older baby. I also do my best to <br/>
communicate clearly and learned a lot from &quot;How to Talk....&quot;<br/>
    As for expressing anger there&#39;s a time and a necessity for self <br/>
expression and release of emotion. There&#39;s also a need to learn self <br/>
containment. A lot of this is, I think, developmental. We focused a lot on <br/>
learning about feelings and their expression when the kids were little. As <br/>
they got older we found we needed to learn more about self containment. Still <br/>
it&#39;s all pretty much out in the open around here;&gt;)</div>
