<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037602889">Hi ~<br/>
<br/>
This discussion on &quot;quitting&quot; has forced me out of lurkdom.<br/>
<br/>
I used to worry quite a bit about the issue of quitting...after all, I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to raise a &quot;QUITTER&quot; did? I really think all that mind-set (at<br/>
least in my case) was just left-over garbage that I was told as a child.<br/>
<br/>
When I really got serious and thought about the whole quitting-issue I<br/>
realized that I quit things all the time.  If I don&#39;t allow my kids the<br/>
freedom to try things (and YES! quit them too) I am depriving them of<br/>
tasting life. They aren&#39;t going to be willing to try too many things if I<br/>
insist that they &quot;finish&quot; everything they start. How do you determine when<br/>
they are &quot;finished&quot; anyway? When my oldest daughter wanted to play the<br/>
violin we allowed her to do that but prior to starting she had to agree to a<br/>
specified time frame. We had to rent the violin for a set period of time so,<br/>
economically speaking, it made sense to us that she should take the lessons<br/>
for at least that long.<br/>
<br/>
The long and short of it, to me, is that I want my kids to try a variety of<br/>
things and I don&#39;t want them to think of themselves as quitters just because<br/>
they try something and they don&#39;t care for it.  Who knows, at some point<br/>
they may go back to the things that they have &quot;quit&quot; and pursue them some<br/>
more. How would I classify/label them then? As &quot;beginning-quitters?&quot;  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I am finding more and more that so many of the little sayings I heard as a<br/>
child are nothing more then garbage and myths passed down from generation to<br/>
generation. I think a LOT of good can be passed down, but I also think it is<br/>
important to question those things we hear ourselves telling our kids (as if<br/>
we were on auto-pilot) and to really think them through. Ask yourself, &quot;do I<br/>
really believe that, or is just something I have heard all my life?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hope I have made some kind of sense in my ramblings! I&#39;ll try not to be so<br/>
&quot;wordy&quot; next time I crawl out of lurkdom!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617015427">Melody...this was wonderful. I have come to the same conclusions as you<br/>
regarding the &#39;trying&#39; of new things and the decision to stop whe you are<br/>
ready. <br/>
I have seen so many burnt out kids lately (school kids all) who are doing<br/>
two instruments, four sports and on and on. When you ask them if they want<br/>
to do all this ...they shrug. I think that sometimes kids get a message<br/>
from their parents that love is equated with performance. <br/>
<br/>
I did Royal Conservatory  for  years and was so burnt out by the time that<br/>
I hit 15 that I closed the piano and did not open it for years.  I think<br/>
there is real merit to trying new things and being able, at some point, to<br/>
decide that it is time for a break. Perhaps to come back again...perhaps to<br/>
try something new.<br/>
I lived with so much guilt when I was a child about &quot;completing&quot;<br/>
everything.  It still haunts me.  I try very hard to listen to my children<br/>
because of this.<br/>

    I second that.I am still in the process of reading them, I did print them <br/>
out to read offline, hope that&#39;s ok. I can only stand to sit at this computer <br/>
so long. <br/>
    I would like to share some of my own thoughts on these subjects with you <br/>
from time to time, are you interested? I don&#39;t want to go through this list <br/>
as it&#39;s probably too far off subject. Let me know. I totally relate to e-mail <br/>
spurring on writing!<br/>
