<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207783528">Hi, I have been lurking for about 3 weeks. We live in Ga. I am having <br/>
a very hard time writing this. We are <br/>
homeschooling /unschooling/eclectic schooling not by choice.<br/>
let me explain, my son (14 almost 15)has some learning difficulties, <br/>
and has add, the first part of this school year he was enrolled in <br/>
public school and then we placed him in private school, where he was <br/>
subsoquently kicked out of due to inappropriate sexual behaviours. <br/>
(very long story).<br/>
I love my son dearly, he can be a great kid. but reality is that he <br/>
is a social misfit. (not like being a wall flower,etc. more like the <br/>
kid others avoid) he is challenging to be around even for me and his <br/>
dad. (arrogant know it all that knows nothing)he constantly lies, he <br/>
will say anything, even if he wasnt going to get in trouble for it. <br/>
he is dreadfully lazy. the homeschooling per se didnt work, it works <br/>
better when he gets to choose in what order or what subject to study, <br/>
we were long away from paperwork since his handwriting is that of a <br/>
1st grader and has a label of dsygraphia, basically his brain knows <br/>
it but it is torture to get it on paper.<br/>
ok just a general timeline<br/>
may- husband began working at home fulltime<br/>
may- 18 yr old move out (was already planned) weekend that son <br/>
carressed her breast, also discovered son&#39;s addiction to internet porn<br/>
may thru october major trama caused by 13 yr old adopted <br/>
autistic/odd/ocd child whom we placed out of the home oct 1st<br/>
aug -14 yr old started public school, <br/>
sept -placed 14 yr old in private school<br/>
end of october -14 yr old kicked out of school, attempted <br/>
homeschooling, very disrespectful child<br/>
november- 14 yr old- very high anxiety resulting in psych <br/>
hospitalization for 10 days (attempted to address sexual issues at <br/>
this time)<br/>
december- we decided to move, get a fresh start for us all, so you <br/>
know decembers focus was the move<br/>
Jan 1, new house, new county, new town. took 2 weeks to restart <br/>
school and settle in,<br/>
still not consistently up to the 4.5 hrs per day the state &quot;requires&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He seems to have no real interest or passions of his own.<br/>
<br/>
he has been totally (and I do mean totally) supervised since october. <br/>
my husband and I have had like only 2 dates. <br/>
i have looked into counseling for him, and havent found appropriate <br/>
counseling - most require a referral from dept of children services <br/>
or a juvinile record, which he has neither. (btw he had to review the <br/>
incidents so much in hospital he doesnt want to talk about it)<br/>
<br/>
psych testing indicated statistically he warped sexually., we think <br/>
he has realized he messed up and has learned his lesson. any comments?<br/>
we eliminated his social contact until the last few weeks when we <br/>
have allowed him to begin in Christian youth group, where we did <br/>
inform a leader that he should be supervised.<br/>
<br/>
I have found a homeschooling group to join and am pursuing that.<br/>
<br/>
I am fearful that if we dont allow him social contact, we are warping <br/>
him, i am fearful that if we do let go he will harm someone else&#39;s <br/>
child. help<br/>
<br/>
in discovering unschooling i have discovered i have no true interest <br/>
or passions. my life is not what i wanted it to be, i know i can <br/>
begin now and start a life, but where to start . . . this has gotten <br/>
me depressed. (i should say that I love my hubby dearly and wouldnt <br/>
trade him)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that my 14 yr old can handle the stress of a typical <br/>
school day even with modifications, which sending him to school would <br/>
be the short term easy way out. but i dont think it is best for him. <br/>
But how do I prepare him for the realities of this world if hes not <br/>
interested. and still there is the lingering thought of high school <br/>
next year, not for the academics but for the tech school prep stuff.<br/>
<br/>
in my prayers i have been told he will be healed, but I dont know <br/>
what to do in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
just bearing my heartaches, feel free to email me offlist<br/>

interest or passions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s your biological child, is it possible he&#39;s like you in that way?<br/>
Or do you have an idea of &quot;interests and passions&quot; which is overly idealized? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Will he watch movies with you?  A lot of time could pass sitting and watching <br/>
videos or DVDs, and the more time that passes with him in a safe place doing <br/>
something appropriate, having people to discuss situations with, having <br/>
examples (fictional is fine--literature and folklore have provided people <br/>
good and bad examples since people started telling stories around fires) of <br/>
different kinds of healthy relationships, and being able to see UNhealthy in <br/>
the context of what can happen (in movies)...  that&#39;s my first <br/>
recommendation.    Inundate him with movies.  Hang out with him and anyone <br/>
else you can get to watch with you.  You could watch all the Harrison Ford <br/>
movies (Regarding Henry and Witness both have to do with comparative <br/>
behaviors!!), and then all of someone else, or something else.  <br/>
<br/>
You would gain companionship, shared time, peace, shared experiences (which <br/>
make future conversations and analogies all easier), lots of interpersonal <br/>
situations will come to your notice that you can discuss.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s WAY cheaper than therapy.  <br/>
<br/>
Every hour he spends there is an hour he&#39;s not looking at porn and he&#39;s also <br/>
another hour older.  Older is often better.  Not always, but often.<br/>
