<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that the person was actually unschooling.<br/>
If I am wrong in my perception, please let me know.<br/>

Depends on a person&#39;s priorities.<br/>
That poster didn&#39;t seem to be an unschooler, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
Some people DO want to obey all laws.  I obey lots of laws, consciously, and <br/>
encourage my kids to but I tell them WHY it&#39;s worth doing.  Littering is bad <br/>
with or without the $300 fine.  Running traffic signals is not worth doing, <br/>
because if some people do it the stupidest will be following suit.  <br/>
<br/>
But if family peace and a child&#39;s wholeness and self image are high on the <br/>
list, following a testing law can&#39;t possibly compete.<br/>
