<div id="ygrps-yiv-688644327">Mary, did you realize you were writing poetry? Read it again! It IS poetry, like life is poetry, too, and to be fully enjoyed!!<br/>
<br/>
Bake something, make something, go somewhere, clean something, read something-anything, take a nap-dream,<br/>
Look up a word-something absurd, have a big bowl of ice-cream.<br/>
Life is for learning, living, doing. How far will your imagination go?<br/>
Be, see, climb a tree. <br/>
Beyond texts there is so much to know.<br/>
Life is an education, a journey where anything goes.<br/>
And the only limits that slow you down are the ones that are self imposed.<br/>
<br/>

  Soap and education are not as sudden as a massacre, <br/>
but they are more deadly in the long run. --- Mark Twain<br/>

Did the previous effort to write this make it to the list? I hope not. I did not cut and paste, but the whole thing was sent. I tried to stop it! I really did!<br/>
