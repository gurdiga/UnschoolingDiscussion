<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876443375">Just wanted to comment on both the &quot;being&quot; thread and <br/>
the &quot;spelling....&quot; thread.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, am a former school teacher who is currently working part time <br/>
a a gas station to help make ends meet and have a little fun money.  <br/>
Ted the maintenence guy who visits about once a week was floored the <br/>
first time I mentioned that I used to teach.  The last time he was at <br/>
the shop the same time I was, he said, &quot;You never have told me why <br/>
you quit teaching.&quot;  I was quiet for a long time, many things going <br/>
through my head, a roll-a-dex if you will, same as another poster <br/>
mentioned her brain doing, and I finally told him, &quot;You know, after <br/>
answering that question numerous times in the past 2 years, I&#39;ve <br/>
discovered that some people are not going to be happy with my answer <br/>
and still think I&#39;m crazy.  Are you one of those?&quot;  A customer <br/>
overheard and asked what I used to do.  I told him.  He said, bet you <br/>
didn&#39;t make enough money.  I said that I was making as much working <br/>
at the gas station with a chance to make more, than what I was making <br/>
at my last teaching job (minus the health insurance pmt.).  Ted <br/>
looked at me and said, &quot;That would have been a very reasonable answer <br/>
to me&quot; with a little grin on his face.  We had a great conversation <br/>
after that.<br/>
<br/>
And about the spelling... I just wanted to mention that my 12yo dd <br/>
and I have gotten HOOKED  on the GSN station and the game LINGO.  We <br/>
get very involved yelling at the contestants and everything.  The <br/>
other day I stomped off into the kitchen because a contestant tried <br/>
to use the word &quot;trods&quot; and was told it was not in the dictionary!  I <br/>
about lost it.  I even threw something at the screen!  I was still <br/>
eavesdropping though and overheard them accept &quot;poser&quot; and began <br/>
wondering what dictionary they were looking in.  Anyway, the 12yo <br/>
sits and guesses right along with me, although she doesn&#39;t throw <br/>
things at the t.v. when she disagrees &lt;g&gt;<br/>
