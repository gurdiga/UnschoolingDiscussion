<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214176655">** A messy house where people are calm is better in a dozen ways that a <br/>
  sanitary, stark house with stress.**<br/>
<br/>
And its amazing how many years it took me to figure that one out!   And that some people never figure that out.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which,  my daughters and I are spending a girls day together today,  my dh and ds are gone. <br/>
<br/>
We are going out to get fabric paint and regular paint.   We are going to paint/decorate the entertainment center my dh built for our van.  (To hold the TV/vcr and game systems for our trip down to SC!)  and we are going to do some other painting.    Mess, mess, mess,  ahhhh glorious mess!   And then we might go see the new Freaky Friday movie,  (mother and daughter too)  :)<br/>

    &lt;&lt; My house is never clean enough to have kids I don&#39;t know over for a<br/>
    playdate.  I would feel like I had to scrub and I am no Martha Stuart.<br/>
    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Kids don&#39;t care.<br/>
    If a kid for some reason DOES care, fine--he won&#39;t come back.<br/>
<br/>
    Your children are living their lives and if they  need other people, that <br/>
    need is bigger and more important than your need to feel proud of your house.  If <br/>
    you&#39;re not good at housekeeping, that&#39;s fine.  Let it go.  Don&#39;t take other <br/>
    people down with you.<br/>

Holly saw a &quot;sneak preview&quot; last night and got a free t-shirt.  She was not <br/>
prepared to like it, out of loyalty to the older version, but she LOVED it.<br/>

<br/>
=&gt;That&#39;s good to know! I was prepared to steer clear of the new version<br/>
because the original was the first movie I ever saw (at age 5). It&#39;s such a<br/>
good memory, one of the few memories I have from when I was really little.<br/>
So I didn&#39;t want to be really disappointed by the new one! If it&#39;s that<br/>
good, maybe I&#39;ll see it after all!<br/>
