he&#39;s added more structure to how and what he wants to learn. Even in a young <br/>
child, an aware parent can recognize the child&#39;s need or desire for some <br/>
structure in the day -- whether it&#39;s around a specially-enjoyed tv show, a <br/>
story before bed, or regular meals. <br/>
<br/>
The question is whether a child--any child-- needs school-like or other <br/>
externally demanded structure. I really believe the need for that structure <br/>
is the parent&#39;s need, not the child&#39;s. Some children may feel safer or more <br/>
comfortable with a regular rhythm to their days, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the <br/>
same as requiring specific learning activity.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that many families who unschool have a great deal of structure. <br/>
Only some families have free-flowing days. If you have a kid who&#39;s a <br/>
passionate dancer and his classes are at certain times, that&#39;s structure. If <br/>
you live in a rural area and it makes sense to go to the library on the same <br/>
day that you grocery shop, that&#39;s structure too. <br/>
<br/>
A child who wants more structured learning will create it. Or an observant <br/>
parent can mention, &quot;I noticed that you really enjoyed studying bugs in that <br/>
structured way. What captured your interest so much? Are you interested in <br/>
learning other things that way, or was it specific to that topic?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I really do believe that unschooling can work for any kid, but not <br/>
necessarily every parent. Or even every parent with every kid. It can be hard <br/>
to let go of our worries and panics, and we often ascribe them to our <br/>
children rather than ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
My sister, who adores her children, would be a terrible homeschooler. She <br/>
worries ALL the time, and has a challenging son, who is really smart, spacey, <br/>
sweet, weird, lovely, and magical. She and Sean would drive each other nuts <br/>
within a week. Cheryl sends him to a local public school and volunteers for <br/>
many hours a week, both in his classroom and in others. I think Sean would <br/>
shine brilliantly unschooled, but it would never work for their family. (I <br/>
just sent Cheryl Grace Llewellyn&#39;s new book, Guerilla Learning.)<br/>

I believe that your belief is based on your experience (as most <br/>
beliefs are.) I also believe that not everyone experiences the same <br/>
response to unschooling, therefore your statement cannot apply to <br/>
everyone. <br/>
<br/>
I have had personal experience with a child who does need an <br/>
external structure.  Unschooling was my desire - I (the parent)did <br/>
not have the need for structure.  Unschooling was a disaster for my <br/>
daughter.  It made her edgy and upset.  She hated it.  She created <br/>
her own school plan and it was very harsh and demanding.  I had to <br/>
step in before she had a nervous breakdown.  She also hates open <br/>
ended questions.  She is a perfectionist and she has always been <br/>
hard on herself.  She has wonderful loving parents who have not done <br/>
anything to cause her to be this way.  It is just the way she has <br/>
always been.  She spilled a glass of milk when she was 2 and became <br/>
quite hysterical.  People watching probably erroneously assumed that <br/>
her parents had been overly harsh in the past when she spilled <br/>
things. The truth is that she had never accidently spilled anything <br/>
before.  <br/>
<br/>
She is now 14 and studying Classical Literature.  She is reading and <br/>
enjoying things that would put me to sleep.  She did fine from <br/>
September until January.  When she started showing signs of stress, <br/>
I stepped in and asked her to take some time off.  She refused <br/>
saying that she needed to finish what she had scheduled.  I found <br/>
some light, fun reading choices and put those on her schedule <br/>
instead.  She thanked me and hugged me with tears in her eyes.  I <br/>
have spent most of her homeschooling years running similar <br/>
interferences.  I also spend a great deal of time telling her how <br/>
wonderful she is as a human being and that studying hard does not <br/>
make me love her more.  I know that some will read what I have <br/>
written and choose not to believe me.  I can&#39;t help that; all I can <br/>
say is &quot;you have not walked in my shoes.&quot;  Please do not judge what <br/>
you have not experienced. <br/>
