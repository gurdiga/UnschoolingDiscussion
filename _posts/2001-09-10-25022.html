Wow!  You have a lot to say.  I appreciate your energy.  I understand<br/>
you feel you were slammed in the beginning.  You have made that<br/>
abundantly clear.   I think it is fair to say that you no longer care if<br/>
you are considered an unschooler by this list, you felt rebuffed in the<br/>
beginning, you feel that a person coming here for support might get<br/>
scared away, and a few other things.  While I respect your need to be<br/>
understood regarding these points, I am humbly requesting that you<br/>
refrain from defending these key subjects ad nauseum. I&#39;m pretty sure we<br/>
all understand.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that anyone who posts any kind of message straying from your<br/>
agenda, you immediately bring your subjects back to the focus.  For<br/>
example, instead of supporting the Eureka post at all, you took a<br/>
defensive stance, and when someone else posted a concern (Sparrow, I<br/>
think), you immediately shifted the focus back to you.  This seems to be<br/>
a trend.  I would almost call it narcissism, but that might be a little<br/>
bold.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this isn&#39;t offensive.  I was hoping these posts would kind of<br/>
blow over.  I would never want anyone to quit posting their opinions,<br/>
but I&#39;m hoping you find a way to post new information rather that<br/>
reiterating the same point over and over.<br/>
<br/>
In peace,<br/>
<br/>
