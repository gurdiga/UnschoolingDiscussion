<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310852462">Here&#39;s the latest from mom.  Many times on this list I have seen folks<br/>
absolutely livid over CPS coming into homeschooling homes and trying to<br/>
remove children.  I have seen folks on this list make almost identical<br/>
statements to those made by this mom.  I am absolutely flabbergasted by the<br/>
rush to judgement and the lockstep attitude that concurs with what the local<br/>
brown-shirts have put out in the press.<br/>

McGuckin remains in jail following Monday hearing<br/>

A judge at a Monday afternoon hearing said JoAnn McGuckin could leave jail<br/>
on her own recognizance if she would agree to terms set by the State<br/>
Department of Health and Welfare around visits with her children, but she<br/>
refused to agree and remains in jail. She also demanded an apology from<br/>
government agencies for how the situation has been handled.<br/>

&quot;Those children are my children, not wards of the state. The state needs to<br/>
learn its place and that is not in family business. It is up to them to<br/>
explain their behavior to everyone because it affects us all. May the<br/>
public demand some answers. May the family be protected for ever and ever.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;May they (the state) be punished for their imposition. But may affairs of<br/>
the heart be the purview of love within the home, and may they never be<br/>
confused. The Constitution of the United States of America supports this<br/>
premise.&quot;<br/>

&gt; bandaid, from walking in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; public place minding our own business, I&#39;d consider it fairly severe.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually,  there has been no indication that this reported injury occurred<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; public property.  The only reference to location is that of a person<br/>
&quot;walking<br/>
&gt; near the house&quot;.    A house located on 40 acres and with signs warning<br/>
folks to<br/>
&gt; stay away.    For all we know,  dogs chased and bit someone who was either<br/>
&gt; accidentally trespassing while on a nature walk or   was intent on<br/>
checking out<br/>
&gt; this prime property.    Or perhaps refused to continue on their way down a<br/>
&gt; public road  when dogs displayed protective behavior while on private<br/>
adjacent<br/>
&gt; property.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are y ou saying that if while bicycling a paved road,   you or your child<br/>
hit a<br/>
&gt; pebble and take a tumble,  you would  be upset because you would consider<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; ensuing broken arm  or  cut on knee requiring either a butterfly bandage<br/>
or 3<br/>
&gt; stitches to be &quot;severe&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My use of &quot;carried away&quot;  refers to defining and usage of the word<br/>
&quot;severe&quot; ,<br/>
&gt; not to  the emotional action one might feel for ANY  &quot;boo-boo&quot;  suffered<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s babies---whether occurring on public or private property.<br/>
