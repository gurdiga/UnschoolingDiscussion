<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249243888">I had a request on the side to expand on the statement that math isn&#39;t just <br/>
numbers.  I figured rather than answer privately, I&#39;d come here where many <br/>
more mathies dwell who could help me.  New-to-homeschooling families <br/>
sometimes haven&#39;t thought of the range of definition of mathematics.  School <br/>
presents it as a continuum of counting, money, arithmetical functions, <br/>
introductory algebra, plane geometry, algebra II, solid geometry, calculus, <br/>
trigonometry, as though they belonged in that order as surely as... the <br/>
alphabet, or the kings of England.  <br/>
<br/>
This morning too early (5:30) a cat woke Holly up.  I was sleeping with her.  <br/>
She wanted to go back to sleep.  I asked if she wanted me to read something <br/>
boring so she could sleep.  She did.  I picked up the Hirsch 2nd Grade book <br/>
and flipped to something that looked boring, and I read it in a soft, slow, <br/>
monotonous way.  I was reading about Arabic and Roman numerals.  And then I <br/>
continued into measurement.  I did inches and feet and was going to move on <br/>
to weights when Holly, NOT asleep, said &quot;What does measuring have to do with <br/>
Roman numerals?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DAMN.  #1, she wasn&#39;t bored.<br/>
#2, it was making her think, and she was being analytical.<br/>
#3, I have studiously, consciously avoided &quot;subject area&quot; descriptors with my <br/>
kids.  So I was not about to say &quot;They&#39;re both considered to be mathematics.&quot; <br/>
 I wasn&#39;t even going to say &quot;They both have to do with numbers and counting.&quot; <br/>
 I said, &quot;Oh.  I forgot to read the subject titles so you didn&#39;t know the <br/>
next section had started.&quot;  It&#39;s not that my kids don&#39;t know what &quot;history&quot; <br/>
and &quot;science&quot; mean; they do.  They could not, though, I think, recite a list <br/>
of the subjects which fall under those headings.  To them, rocks are rocks, <br/>
light is light, and plants are plants.  Rocks, light and plants are not all <br/>
&quot;science,&quot; to be accepted happily as a group (along with how planes fly and <br/>
how soap works) if one &quot;likes science&quot; or rejected if one &quot;hates science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So back to math.<br/>
<br/>
Holly loves math.  It is her native thought-language.  She loves music, and <br/>
sees the math in it--in the distances between notes (intervals) and in the <br/>
patterns on the piano keyboard, and in how written music works.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
read music, but she likes to follow along, or have me show her some of the <br/>
patterns.  We got the score for Handel&#39;s Water Music Suite (from Dover books, <br/>
cheap) and I&#39;ve played it and showed her how in a full score you can see the <br/>
pattern of the music flowing by.  I didn&#39;t try to get her to listen to the <br/>
whole thing, just a couple of pages.  She looked, she got it, she did other <br/>
things in the room while the rest played. <br/>
<br/>
That was math.<br/>
<br/>
Holly loves pattern blocks and puzzles involving shapes.  That&#39;s math.<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes Master Mind for Kids.  That is methodical deductive reasoning and <br/>
patterns.  That&#39;s the kind of math computer programmers use. <br/>
<br/>
Holly likes Zoombinis and Third Grade Adventures.  Logic games and patterns <br/>
without numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Origami.  Making a square piece of paper from an 8.5x11, for starters.  Sure, <br/>
you can buy square Japanese paper, but most kids learn how to make a square <br/>
by tearing a piece off, and exactly how to determine which piece to tear off <br/>
by folding, not by using numbers or a ruler.  Math.<br/>
<br/>
Others help build this big picture, please.  I&#39;ll write more later.<br/>

up an apple for him to eat, and he asked me to &quot;cut it like a magic <br/>
star&quot; (cut it in half sideways so you can see the star that the seeds <br/>
make). We admired the star in the middle and he noticed it had 5 <br/>
points. He went on to think of other things that have 5 points, like <br/>
the starfish we saw at the beach, the stars on the American flag, <br/>
etc. Then he noticed that all the points were the same size and <br/>
distance from the center. We just sat and talked and admired an <br/>
apple. Pattern, nature, distance, magic. &quot;Math&quot;. Though I guess we <br/>
could also call it &quot;science&quot; or &quot;biology&quot; or whatever. It&#39;s so nice <br/>
just to appreciate things for what they are, without having to worry <br/>
about labeling or tracking them.<br/>

<br/>
While I was in here reading the thread about &quot;Math&quot;, Mackenzie is <br/>
doing a project in the kitchen. My mom bought us a whole box of math <br/>
flashcards. So I put the box in the kids&#39; drawer, in case they wanted <br/>
to use them. So right now Mackenzie is really using the math <br/>
flashcards! He&#39;s using them to make &quot;wings&quot; for airplanes made out of <br/>
shoeboxes, that is :-)<br/>
<br/>
Yes mom, Mackenzie loves those flashcards!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter likes these, in spurts anyway. I remember loving them, too.<br/>
She also has enjoyed figuring out some of the puzzles from books by<br/>
Smullyan and Gardner... the &quot;knights and knaves&quot; ones were big a few<br/>
weeks ago (knights always tell the truth, knaves always lie, and you try<br/>
to figure out which people are by what they say, and what people say<br/>
about them). <br/>
<br/>
She also loves games, and sometimes keeps score, which I guess is the<br/>
obvious &quot;math&quot;... but the games we play tend to involve a lot of more<br/>
subtle math... we got Tikal at the Hearthsong clearance sale and we&#39;re<br/>
still working out the best strategies, and she is probably the Set<br/>
champion of the world... we do Dalmuti and Bohnanza when we can find<br/>
enough people (one of the drawbacks of being a family of 2), and 5 Crowns<br/>
and Midnight Party are also popular with her right now.<br/>
