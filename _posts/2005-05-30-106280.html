<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748171085">Well, saying yes to your kids has been big the last couple of days. I know <br/>
that&#39;s what helped me more than any other thing: THINK about what they&#39;re <br/>
asking, before shooting off an automatic &quot;no&quot; to their requests.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I must say what helped me a lot at the beginning, was writing out <br/>
&quot;Everything I&#39;ve Ever Learned&quot; in one hour-long free association journal <br/>
entry. Per Sandra&#39;s advice, I think it was.<br/>
<br/>
those two things helped me at the beginning.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I  thought that maybe having a set of four or more informal rotating topics<br/>
&gt;might  be useful for this list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;====================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That could be fun to at least try for one rotation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what are the four or more topics people need to discuss to get<br/>
&gt;unschooling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In LLL, weaning/solids (for example) comes around once a month,  and not <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;the moms are needing it every time, but some people only go to four  <br/>
&gt;meetings<br/>
&gt;and have to do with what they can from memory and books if they don&#39;t  want <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;go back.<br/>
