<div id="ygrps-yiv-316014763">Here Here!  I decided a few years ago that all those Hostile&#39;s I was encountering had a problem with HSing, not me.  <br/>
I no longer take it upon myself to educate them.  The way I see it, time is precious.  It is not my responsibility to <br/>
educate these people about the many educational alternatives available to us all.  They can either take the time<br/>
to investigate the possibilities same as I have or not, but it is no longer my mission.  Life is too short to spend it <br/>
focusing on the negative with negatively inclined people.  You know what I told the last person who wanted to start <br/>
one of those very heated how you can you deprive your child of the benefits of school conversations? <br/>
I told her I homeschooled because I liked that old song &quot;Accentuate the Positive&quot; and I walked away whistling.<br/>
