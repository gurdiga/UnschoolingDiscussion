&lt;&lt;  Now I&#39;m dying to know what pulling stickers <br/>
and getting goatheads could possibly mean.  (Is it like public mastication??) <br/>
 &lt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People can chew in public.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a sticker in New Mexico that grows where the dirt has been disturbed, <br/>
so around playgrounds and along sidewalks they come up from a single sticker, <br/>
which is a four-pointed thing that sits on three points and holds one up for <br/>
you to step on, no matter how it falls.  In the Middle Ages such things were <br/>
manufactured to stop mounted attacks, and they were called caltrops.  But these <br/>
are nature&#39;s little caltrops, just about the size of the end of your little <br/>
finger.<br/>
<br/>
One seed can grow a plant that has hundreds of the seeds and if you pick them <br/>
early it&#39;s easy, but if you wait, you need gloves and a tool.  But still, <br/>
pulling it when it&#39;s green will prevent MANY stickers from going home in kids&#39; <br/>
shoes to stay in carpets (or worse, get a running barefoot or thong-footed kid  <br/>
a bloody puncture).<br/>
<br/>
So if you come to New Mexico, as what goat heads look like so you won&#39;t walk <br/>
in them.<br/>
<br/>
I checked google.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a photo of a non-native missionary and a little blurb about &quot;Goat&#39;s <br/>
Head&quot;  stickers.  They&#39;re wrong about that two prong thing.  Three down one up.  <br/>
They&#39;re right about it penetrating a tennis shoe.<br/>
<br/>
The two little flat round things on either side of his shovel are goat head <br/>
plants.  Small ones.  If that yard got some water, and one was growing where <br/>
he&#39;s standing, it could get big enough to fill up most of the ground in the <br/>
photo, three feet from him in every direction.<br/>
<br/>
And when you dig them up you have to put them in the trash, because just <br/>
throwing them aside won&#39;t keep the stickers from still developing.  Once they&#39;re <br/>
formed there&#39;s nothing left but for them to dry, but when they&#39;re growing they <br/>
grow three in a bunch, and they&#39;re pudgy and light green, a little like the <br/>
eyes on a potato, but all the same shape.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the only thing I found on the internet.  I should take some goat head <br/>
pictures and make my own page next year.  &quot;The life cycle of an exotic desert <br/>
sticker.&quot;<br/>

THAT IS IT!<br/>
Tribulus terrestris; Puncture Weed Or Land Caltrop   <br/>
<br/>
AHA!<br/>
<br/>
The stickers show, but they&#39;re against the rocks so it&#39;s hard to see them.  <br/>
Each yellow flower makes one set of stickers.<br/>
<br/>
That photo is showing about 1/3 of that plant, and that&#39;s not a very healthy <br/>
plant.  It&#39;s all growing in one direction.  So picture that WAY healthier <br/>
(like living at the edge of a city park that gets the sprinklers regularly) and <br/>
those are what I pull up.  Sometimes it only takes three or four plants to fill <br/>
up a trash can.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you found that!  I&#39;m going to read all about it now.  Those <br/>
stickers tormented me badly when I was seven years old, and I vowed to get them <br/>
back. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing eats them.  If they get a tiny clear sandy place and some water, <br/>
they&#39;re good to go. Nothing&#39;s fastened to the ground but that one original stem.  <br/>
The rest lies flat out everywhere waiting for animals or people to walk on it <br/>
and plant it in other places and on carpets everywhere.<br/>

We have those here too! Nasty little buggers. We also have cockle burrs, <br/>
round/oval shaped with lots of velcro like hooks. Little itty bitty triangle <br/>
shaped, flat sticker things, we call sticktites, and these things some call devils <br/>
claws and others call goats heads, which is what I though you were talking <br/>
about in the first place. The devils claws are huge! Altogether, about the size <br/>
of an adult fist; a small pod thing with three LONG prongs that reach out and <br/>
grab. <br/>

Down here in the south, we have some nasty little stickers that drive me<br/>
crazy. Now I&#39;m interested to know what they are called. They grow from a<br/>
weed that pretty much looks like grass, they are all green and grow like a<br/>
very small dandelion flower when the flower turns to fuzz. They are very<br/>
small, all green, soft and look like tiny little prickly flowers. Points<br/>
sticking out all over. It&#39;s when they die and turn brown that they really<br/>
hurt. They stick to everything and when you step on one with barefeet, they<br/>
really hurt and stick right in. I&#39;ve found them stuck in Joe&#39;s socks after<br/>
he cuts the grass and I wash them without knowing they&#39;re all stuck in<br/>

<br/>
Are they triangular shaped, kind of puffy but mostly flat? Or are they oval <br/>
shaped, about the size of this O? We have both. And the larger oval shaped ones <br/>
called cockleburs too. <br/>

I learned the term goathead when  we moved about 80  miles west of Ft. Worth into  sandy peanut country instead of Dallas Blackland Prairie.   Vicious things.   Draw blood.   The ones there really DO look like a goat&#39;s head and are easy to imagine as some sort of devil symbol item!    The two &quot;horns&quot;  are longer than the other prongs........and do damage not just to bare feet but to tires!<br/>
<br/>
Kids around there  just took them in stride but you never heard such complaints as from &quot;outside Texas&quot;  visitors.  Fireants AND goatheads just seemed too much.     Throw in  &quot;bull-nettles&quot;  and there was lots of talk about &quot;god-forsaken country&quot;.     Of course, we Native Texans know that there is no better place on or off this planet :-)<br/>

These are kind of like the things Sandra was talking about, and we have these <br/>
here in Kansas as well. The goats heads or devils claws I was talking about <br/>
are huge. The pod is about the size of an egg and then there are three long <br/>
spiky prongs, like a clawed hand coming off of it. In all, it is about the size <br/>
of a mans hand. I haven&#39;t found a picture of one yet, I don&#39;t know what the <br/>
technical name for the plant is, but as soon as I find one I will show! Nasty <br/>
suckers, and I have only seen them in sorghum fields in Central and Western <br/>
Kansas. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236634599">okay, now I know that the plant we found on a hike near our place... <br/>
a healthy, robust plant with dozens of seed heads...was a burdock. <br/>
And each spur is hooked, just like velcro. AND for each spur there is <br/>
a seed inside.<br/>

sneaker laces!!! At least those don&#39;t hurt. Still can&#39;t find the hurting<br/>
stickers we have here.<br/>

&lt;&lt; You can fight back with puncturevine weevils. They are <br/>
<br/>
host specific; they eat goatheads and only goathead seeds and stems.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SO!  I am wrong nothing eats them!  <br/>
And when I googled images, I discovered people eat them too, somehow, as some <br/>
Chinese remedy for lack of maximum manliness, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
So I have learned there are men and weevils who eat them.<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen either in my yard, though.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You know when some types of grass grow long and turn <br/>
<br/>
into a little wheat looking like plant?  Well, I&#39;ve found that <br/>
<br/>
instead of the puffy wheat it&#39;s a cluster of goatheads. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Grassburs?  Really, you&#39;re getting vertical goatheads?<br/>
<br/>
Grassburs grow up in what looks like grass and then it opens up but those <br/>
have stickers all around them.<br/>
<br/>
If I bought weevils and put them on a goathead plant, it would be easier to <br/>
get a shovel and pull that plant up.   As dry as it is where goatheads live, <br/>
how could the weevils survive the hike from one plant to another?  And if you <br/>
have to leave them at each site...<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t seem like a great idea to me.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty good photos at that site, but this is misleading:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/HTML&gt;</div>

&lt;&lt; The goats heads or devils claws I was talking about <br/>
are huge. The pod is about the size of an egg and then there are three long <br/>
spiky prongs, like a clawed hand coming off of it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a thing in west texas called &quot;Devil&#39;s claw&quot; (or devil&#39;s something) <br/>
and it&#39;s a seed pod six to ten inches long (the ones I&#39;ve seen) and then it <br/>
dries up, the two halves stay together AND they&#39;re curved so that it creates a <br/>
kind of trap which can get onto the leg of an animal or a small-footed person and <br/>
each step they take the seeds can be released (if any are still in <br/>
there--they still can get you if they&#39;re empty).<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem with weeds (and bugs, and birds) is regional terminology.<br/>
<br/>
Sow bugs are roly-polies where I live, but I understand other places call <br/>
other things sow bugs,  so the word isn&#39;t always useful.<br/>
<br/>
What Americans call a robin isn&#39;t what a robin is in England.  I guess when <br/>
immigrants got here they called the nearest-looking bird a robin, but there&#39;s <br/>
not much similarity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464293921">The stickers show, but they&#39;re against the rocks so it&#39;s hard to see them.<br/>
Each yellow flower makes one set of stickers.<br/>
<br/>
That photo is showing about 1/3 of that plant, and that&#39;s not a very healthy<br/>
plant.  It&#39;s all growing in one direction.  So picture that WAY healthier<br/>
(like living at the edge of a city park that gets the sprinklers regularly)<br/>
and those are what I pull up.  Sometimes it only takes three or four plants<br/>
to fill up a trash can.<br/>

Our town is plagued by caltrop too.  It grows like mad in the summer and if<br/>
you go for a walk you usually have to take your shoes off and pick the<br/>
prickles out before you go inside. Mark goes into battle mode with it each<br/>
summer. Reminds me of the Day of the Triffids!<br/>
