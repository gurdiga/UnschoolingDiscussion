&lt;&lt; Is there ever a time that you&#39;re firm with your kids and say, &quot;NO!  <br/>
 You will NOT keep hurting your sister, and then physically remove the <br/>
 child from the situation? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, definitely.<br/>
I will not permit anyone in MY house to hurt another person. If anyone, <br/>
adults included, are trying to run roughshod over anyone, I will end it right <br/>
now.<br/>
I think by saying yes most of the time, my NO&#39;s are more meaningful. <br/>
Hurting another person is only acceptable as self defense.<br/>
If a child was trying to continue to hurt the victimized child, even while I <br/>
was holding them, there would be a swift and immediete response of them being <br/>
immobilized.<br/>
I would be firm about not hurting the other person, hold them until they were <br/>
calm and probably remove them from the room while holding them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is really, really important advice.<br/>
I can usually sense when one child is starting to feel irritable...usually <br/>
Sierra starts to melt down and I can feed her or cuddle or something to <br/>
prevent the build up between her an Jared.<br/>
Trevor has a bad habit of calling names when he gets frustrated. Usually <br/>
while gaming.<br/>
I am very, very firm about telling him it is NOT ok to add the &quot;dummy&quot; to an <br/>
explanation and I remind Jared that it is not ok to let people talk like that <br/>
to you.<br/>
If it continues I will have Trevor come out of the room with me (the boys <br/>
don&#39;t escalate into hitting anymore) to talk.<br/>
I know in my heart that a lot of his anger problems come from the way I <br/>
parented him before unschooling came into our lives.<br/>
I remind myself of that and how very far he&#39;s  come in a short time.<br/>
He&#39;s really helpful and sweet most of the time. But his temper is par for the <br/>
course with the crap he had to deal with when he was younger.<br/>
Poor guy.  I only have hitting problems come along with Sierra. I think she <br/>
feels helpless to solve issues any other way when she gets overwhelmed.<br/>
So it&#39;s my job to head it off at the pass! :)<br/>

<br/>
Something you learned reading Harry Potter,  huh? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once a couple of years ago I was really furious with Kirby for a second (all <br/>
it takes) about something hateful he said to me (very rare, and I can&#39;t <br/>
remember what led up to it) and I tried to hit him.  He blocked it quickly <br/>
and quietly without hurting either of us, just stuck his arm up.<br/>
<br/>
I thought &quot;Hmmm.... that karate has really done him some good!  Worth the <br/>
money!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I can still say I haven&#39;t hit Kirby since he was really little, but not <br/>
because I didn&#39;t try, because he&#39;s trained to defend himself.<br/>
<br/>
And he can take people down, but hasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Very interestingly, I asked him one day if he ever sizes up a place when he <br/>
enters to see who he could take, if things got crazy.  I asked him because a <br/>
couple of adult male friends had talked to me about that, and I&#39;d asked <br/>
Keith, who said, &quot;Sure, always.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said no.<br/>
<br/>
But within one week, he had two incidents, a party and a guy on the sidewalk <br/>
outside the store where he works.  Both times, he said he became clearly <br/>
aware of where people were, and what would be more efficient use of physical <br/>
force, but he only used words.<br/>
<br/>
Very cool.  Knowing that he COULD handle the situation physically made him <br/>
calm enough to be able to think of what to say to diffuse the situation.<br/>
<br/>
So if I need someone big immobilized, I hope Kirby&#39;s there to help.<br/>

Marty&#39;s our offender in that area.  Sometimes he&#39;ll say what&#39;s fine to say, <br/>
and then end with &quot;You retard.&quot;   Gaming, with guys.  Twice I&#39;ve talked to <br/>
him when things are still and nobody else is there.  And he does it less.<br/>
<br/>
What I told him was those things stick and build up.  He said, &quot;Yeah, like <br/>
things Kirby has said to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Exactly, so if you know it hurts, don&#39;t do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That makes sense to him, but in the excitement of four or five teenage boys <br/>
at top speed, he still sometimes will let slip a gratuitous insult.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Marty has ever met anyone who was truly retarded, and if he had <br/>
he probably wouldn&#39;t use the word.    <br/>
<br/>
He was using &quot;gay&quot; in that tacky way to mean &quot;lame&quot; and I objected one day <br/>
reminding him he had gay friends.  He wasn&#39;t connecting the two.  He was just <br/>
following his tacky friend, and he does have one friend who&#39;s the epitomy of <br/>
tack  (not tact).<br/>

That quiet confidence that a person trained in self defense possesses is <br/>
something to be admired. That is really great.<br/>
<br/>
I for one, would just like to have a magic wand. It would evaporate rude <br/>
drivers, lock the jaws of petty people and make my mean neighbors grow warts <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445716579">A while ago, um seven years ago (kids 15, 10 now), I decided that me haveing<br/>
limits on what I &quot;would allow&quot; when they were dealing with eachother was not<br/>
consistant with my idea that I was to trust them. I think mostly, our<br/>
experiences showed me that what I was doing (the kind of positive parenting<br/>
things lately posted on the list) wasnt working, things would keep<br/>
happening- there was a &quot;tremor in the force&quot; - that is something I say when<br/>
I have this uncozy feeling that something is not right).  I decided that if<br/>
I could trust them with their life, then I could definately trust them in<br/>
their own relationships, with the people that they love.<br/>
<br/>
SO, I stopped.  I stopped interfering when they where headed for a big (yes,<br/>
physical- which was my &quot;limit&quot;) fight.<br/>
<br/>
Their relationship changed.  They stopped hurting eachother when they got<br/>
mad.  They were FREE.  They were free to get in a huge fight with out<br/>
looking over to me- or doing something they *would NOT* regret because I<br/>
forced them to stop.  They experienced what it was like to hurt each other<br/>
(mentally and physically)- and they didn&#39;t like it.  They were *totally<br/>
free* to have a real relationship. I got my face out of their business.<br/>
<br/>
I was taking their responsibility away when I interfered.<br/>
<br/>
Let me qualify this (to try to temper the list blows) by saying my kids had<br/>
always owned their relationship (because I didn&#39;t interfere *except* when it<br/>
reached my limit), and didn&#39;t fight too much anyway, this was a logical<br/>
step.  Also, there was no other reasons for hurting eachother like um...like<br/>
they felt powerless because of something I did- and then went to try to gain<br/>
power back by hurting someone else.<br/>

When Kirby was five or barely six, we had a discussion about people living <br/>
together who aren&#39;t married, because friends were getting married he thought <br/>
already WERE married.  I was telling him I had lived with his dad several <br/>
years before we married, and the difference is if you&#39;re not married you can <br/>
just decide you don&#39;t want to live together anymore and say bye!<br/>
<br/>
Wonder and fear were in his face as he said &quot;You would re-set &#39;marry Daddy&#39;?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was thinking like a computer-age kid already. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
He didn&#39;t have the terminology to talk about complex social relations, but he <br/>
sure understood some programming already.<br/>
