&lt;&lt; Are you in Florida? Darin says sometimes the weird versions of spiders <br/>
 sometimes hitch rides on produce coming from the jungles and arrive like <br/>
 illegal aliens off the boats! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am in FL. I wonder if they&#39;re the same creature then?<br/>
The Spiders we refer to as Banana Spiders here, are definitely large, but no <br/>
where close to the Carolina Wolf Spiders we have.<br/>
They do have a golden abdomen, very pretty actually. And they do build large <br/>
webs in between trees. From what I&#39;ve read about them, they are harmless to <br/>
humans. I&#39;ve taken a few pictures of them while hiking with the kids. They&#39;re <br/>
really cool looking.<br/>
No &quot;two step&quot; snakes (thank goodness). All  of the poisonus versions of <br/>
snakes that we have, you can get treatment for.  The one that scares me the <br/>
most is the famous Cotton Mouth, or Water Moccasin.<br/>
On the snake topic, I just found out that more people die from snake bite <br/>
than any other animal death. Around 100,000 people world wide die every year. <br/>
 Makes the U.S. look like a really great place to live, we don&#39;t lose very <br/>
many people to snake bites here.<br/>
The second most deadly animal was BEES/WASPS, with about 10,000 deaths per <br/>
year.<br/>
The lowly Shark was at the bottom of the top 10 deadly animals, only an <br/>
average of 8 deaths per year.!!!<br/>
Maybe swimming in the Gulf shouldn&#39;t scare me so much?<br/>
