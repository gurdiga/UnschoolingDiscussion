<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does that mean Jenni is going to be a vampire?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I was four, I told my mother that when I grew up, I wanted to be a <br/>
writer, a ballerina, or a vampire.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I grew up to be an attorney (which, in some ways, is a combination <br/>
of all three!)<br/>
<br/>
In any event, the subject of vampires and censorship (WAS that the subject) <br/>
inspired me to ask this question, as it is one that I grapple with daily:<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have deeply-held religious or philosophical beliefs, how <br/>
do you approach a situation in which your child expresses a desire to engage <br/>
in an activity that runs counter to those beliefs?<br/>
<br/>
For example, Harry Potter.  I know that this book caused a great hubbub in <br/>
one portion of the Christian population.  (I will refrain, for purposes of <br/>
this question, from giving my personal opinion about that issue).  However, <br/>
the question is, for those unschooling parents among us who would &quot;frown&quot; on <br/>
Harry Potter for religious reasons, how would you approach a situation in <br/>
which your son or daughter wanted to read that series?<br/>

<br/>
Great question, and one I think we all could examine :)<br/>
<br/>
My beliefs are MY beliefs. My children & anyone else for that matter has the right to believe whatever they want. If they choose to read Harry Potter, great! If it goes against what I want, I don&#39;t have to read it. (Although I do, I love Harry Potter!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Objectively speaking -- and this is a question to contemplate rather than<br/>
inflame -- is not wanting kids to do something for religious reasons<br/>
different from not wanting them to do something for moral or health reasons?<br/>
<br/>
Is a Christian not allowing her children to read Harry Potter different than<br/>
a vegetarian not allowing her children to eat meat?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps one difference is that the religious convictions are based on, and<br/>
not meaning this disrespectfully, thought exercises rather than the physical<br/>
world. For instance we can want our kids not to jump off cliffs because we<br/>
know with a great deal of certainty what will happen. But if we want our<br/>
kids not to read Harry Potter, it&#39;s based on a series of if this is true<br/>
(the Bible is unerring, God wants us to do this, or whatever) then this is<br/>
true so if that is true, then this must be true. (There&#39;s undoubtedly a word<br/>
for the difference between those two.)<br/>
<br/>
The Bible doesn&#39;t come right out and say Thou shalt not read Harry Potter<br/>
;-) so the decision that it&#39;s wrong to do so is based on a series of logic<br/>
exercises that can&#39;t be tested empirically (I think that&#39;s the wor0) only<br/>
tested to see if they are logically consistent (and there&#39;s a word for that<br/>
too.)<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the problem -- of trying to come to such a conclusion -- is<br/>
the feeling that if the Bible is unerring that everyone who *correctly*<br/>
interprets the Bible will come up with the exact same answer. So, since many<br/>
people come to a variety of conclusions, some must be right and some must be<br/>
wrong. You can&#39;t really use the Bible to come to your *own* conclusion. You<br/>
can only use it to come to the *right* conclusion. So, how do you know when<br/>
the conclusion you&#39;ve come to is the &quot;right&quot; one? Can you tell by just<br/>
looking in your heart or do you need to ask others and compare answers and<br/>
hear their reasoning?<br/>
<br/>
I think the big questions like whether it&#39;s right to kill someone or whether<br/>
loving God is a good thing or not are things that can be answered by looking<br/>
in your heart. Why should whether reading Harry Potter is right or wrong be<br/>
any different? I think the big difference the big answers are real and the<br/>
Harry Potter answer is based on going through contortions to extract an<br/>
answer from the Bible. Is God really that convoluted?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think maybe I need to ask some questions first to figure out the right<br/>
mindset to answer from.<br/>
<br/>
How do you decide what is morally right and what is morally wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Do you love God because it&#39;s morally right or because that&#39;s what God wants?<br/>
<br/>
If you say both, is there ever a time when they aren&#39;t the same? Are there<br/>
times when what is morally right is not what God wants? Are some things<br/>
right without needing to be morally right?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m asking for a Venn diagram ;-) Is what is morally right entirely<br/>
contained in what God wants? And is what God wants a larger set of things<br/>
that are neutral in the morally right/wrong category? Or is something<br/>
morally right *because* God wants it? Are there times when what God wants is<br/>
not what is morally right? (It could be morally neutral.)<br/>
<br/>
(I think I&#39;m answering my own questions just by asking them but I&#39;ll go<br/>
ahead and ask them anyway :-)<br/>
<br/>
Is there a smaller set of Universal Rights that anyone can conclude without<br/>
access to Christianity? Eg, it&#39;s hard to conclude that it is right to accept<br/>
Jesus Christ as personal savior without access to Christianity, but many<br/>
people over time have concluded that killing and stealing and lying are<br/>
morally wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Is the purpose (or one purpose) of the Bible to tell you what is right and<br/>
wrong or to help you decide what is right and wrong? The difference being<br/>
that what is morally right and wrong can&#39;t be determined from deep thought<br/>
and you must be told or can it be determined and the Bible just helps<br/>
someone clarify their thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe the Bible is infallible?<br/>
<br/>
(Are there non-Bible-literalists who ban Harry Potter for religious<br/>
reasons?)<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to expand on your answers if the questions are missing the<br/>
mark. Like I&#39;m asking if a rock is a plant or an animal ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572489994">&lt;&lt;For those of you who have deeply-held religious or philosophical<br/>
beliefs, how <br/>
do you approach a situation in which your child expresses a desire to<br/>
engage <br/>
in an activity that runs counter to those beliefs?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I do, especially if I&#39;m not sure of what the activity<br/>
entails, is do some research.  It&#39;s easier for people to hear your<br/>
objections when you&#39;ve done your homework.  If I still have misgivings I<br/>
tell my children so and then let them decide.  This is modified with the<br/>
youngest, he is only 4 but even with him I explain why I need him to do<br/>
(or not) do something.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, once I&#39;ve explained my views they follow my lead.  Lanora (11)<br/>
is very considerate of my feelings and trusts my instincts.  There have<br/>
been rare occasions when she has gone ahead but admitted each time that I<br/>
was right.  Of course, she also knows that there will be no &quot;I told you<br/>
so&quot; from me.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora has already begun to give signals that she&#39;s questioning the<br/>
tenets of Christianity.  I answer her questions when I can, honestly tell<br/>
her when I don&#39;t know and let her know that doubts are normal.  I tell<br/>
her that even if God doesn&#39;t exist there are certain truths in life and<br/>
some activities carry a HIGH potential for harm. Ultimately her faith is<br/>
her own and if what I believe is real then it certainly can stand the<br/>
test of scrutiny.<br/>
