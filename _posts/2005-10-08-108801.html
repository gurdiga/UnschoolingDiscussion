<div id="ygrps-yiv-719019646">&lt;&lt;-=-I think <br/>
your analyzing too much. Just go with life and  it  will all fall into  <br/>
place.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this  list is to discuss what helps unschooling work  better.<br/>
Advising  against analysis might be good for a teaparty list, but not for  <br/>
this  one.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just go with life&quot; is what most people do.<br/>
Parenting mindfully  and making conscious choices based on principles isn&#39;t  <br/>
quite as  simple as just going with life.  Some people just go with their   <br/>
lives <br/>
and end up in prison.<br/>
<br/>

I think your referring to what I wrote.. &quot;Telling them if they don&#39;t  help <br/>
there won&#39;t be fun more often to be had  <br/>
doesn&#39;t work. Kids think  in the moment not ahead especially younger ones. I  <br/>
think <br/>
your  analyzing too much. Just go with life and it will all fall into   <br/>
place.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I was talking about stressing over making them clean and comparing it  to <br/>
other families not her whole post. Going with life as in not seeing it as a  <br/>
failure every time life doesn&#39;t go according to plan. <br/>
In light of some recent comments I can see how what i wrote can be  <br/>
misunderstood. My apologies for not being clearer. <br/>
