<div id="ygrps-yiv-393366929">Although I know we&#39;re not the longest nursers (my longest was 2yrs.<br/>
8mos.) I have been nursing and/or pregnant for 10 years.  Each child has<br/>
nursed until the next was ready to be born.  This obviously did&#39;t effect<br/>
my fertility, but I didn&#39;t have my period for about 18 mos. after each<br/>
child.  This also provided a nice, natural spacing between my children. <br/>
With a new baby coming and the older child being old enough to understand<br/>
that, we never had a problem with weaning either.  My two youngest<br/>
children always sleep with me (whoever that may be at the time).  This<br/>
too ends quiet naturally for us because at around 4 to five they have<br/>
been ready to move to their own beds.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461637821">i always tell moms that it&#39;s not a competition to see who can nurse the<br/>
longest.  what is important is that we are all trying to do out best by<br/>
our children, and for many of us, that includes nursing.  Now, if we<br/>
wanted to compete, I bet I&#39;d win;)  That 5 yo in the news recently has<br/>

Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of wine and no kids jumping in (the bath, not the bottle) !!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, and I would sure love that bath!! :-) As far as weaning parties go<br/>
(someone else mentioned), I think they can be a really lovely idea if they<br/>
celebrate a natural transition in a child&#39;s life, an important milestone. I<br/>
think they hold the potential for real harm if they are used as a bribe to<br/>
get a child to trade in something emotionally important to them for a party<br/>
and presents before they are ready to do so. If it ever came down to that<br/>
(me wanting to wean before they are ready), I&#39;d prefer to be honest with my<br/>
child and tell them the relationship is over from my standpoint and slowly<br/>
wean them off (and acknowledge their feelings of sadness if they exist) to<br/>
throwing them a party and asking them to be happy about it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as nursing kids (we&#39;re not even talking about toddlers here now, LOL<br/>
:-), my son is going on 4 1/2 and still nurses pretty frequently. I&#39;ve had<br/>
to limit our nursing to in our own home only due to society&#39;s misconceptions<br/>
about this whole subject, but he still probably nurses 6 - 8 times a day<br/>
(I&#39;m guessing) and asks more frequently than that. But he&#39;s always been a<br/>
mega-nurser, I think he nursed about hourly for the first 2 1/2 years.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 14 months old and already nurses much less frequently than my<br/>
son. She has from birth really, she&#39;s not a comfort nurser, but is starting<br/>
to get more attached to it as she gets older. As a sidenote, I love the<br/>
sweet interchange that occurs around nursing. My daughter says &quot;Ma!!&quot; and I<br/>
say &quot;Yes??&quot; and she says &quot;Num num!!!&quot;, so sweet. My son pretends to nurse<br/>
his Nutcracker doll that he got with his Christmas money. As a toddler he<br/>
used to &quot;nurse&quot; his trains and trucks.<br/>

SOMEone would say, &quot;BUt my 4 yo nurses all the time&quot; but in actuallity,<br/>
yours has slowed down quite a bit, and those who have younger nursing<br/>
siblings tend to nurse more, too, I think.  At least that is how it worked<br/>
at our house.  I had to laugh when my baby had his check up at 2 mos and<br/>
the doctor asked, &quot;How many years do you plan to nurse him?&quot;  Since my<br/>
other sons were sitting right there, I almost answered, &quot;Which one?&quot;  <br/>
When I was first pregnant, with a baby due at the beginning of December, a<br/>
LLLL said at a meeting to take time to sit in the dark, with the tree<br/>
lights on, and nurse your baby and enjoy it because that might be the last<br/>
xmas you get to do that.  Well, that year, I did it with my newborn,<br/>
hoping that he would still be nursing the following xmas.  The following<br/>
year, I was pregnant and nursing him and hoping he wouldn&#39;t wean and he&#39;d<br/>
nurse at least until he was two.  That year, when he had turned 2, I<br/>
assumed it would be my last year to sit in the dark and nurse by the tree.  <br/>
The following year, I nursed my new baby and my 3 yo, again, assuming (and<br/>
hoping to be honest) that that year would be the last for my older son.  <br/>
Well, last year was the last time.  And the last nursing session was on<br/>
the couch, in the dark, with only the tree lights on.  It has been a year<br/>
since he last nursed.  He was way over two.  I really enjoyed the last 18<br/>
months of his nursing and it made up for all the frustrations from<br/>
earlier.  I figure my 5.5 year old will follow a similar pattern.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794098415">I am just jumping in here since I am new but I think it is ssssoo<br/>
wonderful you all have nursed so long. My kids all seemed to wean around<br/>
14 months. Broke my heart each time as I had always thought we would<br/>
nurse so much longer. I had friends who nursed till thier kids were 4 or<br/>
so. My one year old nurses and shows no sign of slowing down like his<br/>
older siblings. I sure hope he will nurse longer than the others. He<br/>
really likes to sleep with us to though I think my husband is getting a<br/>
bit tired of feet in his neck at night. *L*<br/>

unschooling with my 5 year old and 3 year old. Both of<br/>
which i nursed longer than most people other than my<br/>
dad (just cuz he didn&#39;t like depriving them of<br/>
anything) and my midwife (thank heavens for midwives)<br/>
would have liked. with my youngest (dd) we were both<br/>
pretty ready for quitting at 2 and a half, but if I<br/>
had to do it over again, I think I weaned my son too<br/>
early at 22 months due to many outside circumstances,<br/>
and have many regrets. So I say,  Nurse on, lovely<br/>
ladies. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461691437">&quot;I love the<br/>
 sweet interchange that occurs around nursing. My<br/>
 daughter says &quot;Ma!!&quot; and I<br/>
 say &quot;Yes??&quot; and she says &quot;Num num!!!&quot;, so sweet. &quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
yay! I&#39;ve never heard anyone else call it &quot;num num&quot;<br/>
before except my family. When I was little my mom (and<br/>
me apparently) called it num num. (My mom had 6 kids,<br/>
me being the 5th and the first one she nursed. Said<br/>
she was looked on like a wierd hippie person cuz she<br/>
was breastfeeding. A friend of hers was recalling<br/>
jokingly how they used to have wear these mega amounts<br/>
of clothes so they would be carefully and completely<br/>
covered up, even in summer, go in the very most back<br/>
room of wherever you were, turn the lights off and<br/>
shut the door and put a blanket over you, even despite<br/>
all the extra clothes you were wearing.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it was actually as extreme as she made it<br/>
sound, but you would think that since that was 20 or<br/>
so years ago, things would have changed alot. Women<br/>
have gotten ballsier about it, I think, but<br/>
unfortunately society is almost still as bad. <br/>
<br/>
On the subject of nursing, (even though you are<br/>
probably all done with it by now, I&#39;m so slow in<br/>
replying), how have you all dealt with public nursing?<br/>
<br/>
All of my friends and family always joked and gave me<br/>
a hard time (lovingly of course, in good fun, cuz in<br/>
reality they admired it), warning people who were new<br/>
to our circle that I had a tendency to just &quot;whip it<br/>
out&quot; at any given moment. <br/>

<br/>
Most people think it&#39;s strange when I say I&#39;m more comfortable nursing my<br/>
18-month-old dd in public now than when she was an infant, but I&#39;m sure you<br/>
guys understand. Of course I haven&#39;t always been comfortable nip, but I&#39;ve<br/>
always done it when Accalia has needed or wanted it. Now she usually only<br/>
wants to nip when we&#39;re at restaurants, and I&#39;ve gotten some strange looks<br/>
but I don&#39;t think people are always sure what they see. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I think my favorite time nip was when Accalia was around a year old and dh,<br/>
me and Accalia went to an indoors Indigo Girls concert. Accalia was the only<br/>
child there, and I&#39;m sure people around us were a little concerned about how<br/>
she would act. They didn&#39;t have to worry because I think she fell asleep<br/>
nursing right after the opening act. I&#39;m still amazed because that was a<br/>
loud concert!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I nursed in the 70s, 80s and 90s, my kids range in age from 27 to 4, and<br/>
nursing, like birthing changed a lot in those 23 years.   With my first, who<br/>
I weaned at 4 months because I believed people who told me my milk probably<br/>
wasn&#39;t any good because he was a little slow at gaining weight [probably<br/>
because I had mostly fed him at the four hourly intervals prescribed by the<br/>
&quot;experts&quot;.   With his birth I was shaved, endured an enema and was flat on<br/>
my back with my legs in stirrups, in spite of that it was a very good birth<br/>
attended by a midwife, no episiotomy, no tear.   He was taken away after<br/>
about 30 minutes, and when he was brought out of the nursery for a feed they<br/>
also brough a bottle of formula &quot;because you don&#39;t have enough milk&quot;.   12<br/>
years later when #6 was born, they no longer shaved you or did the enema<br/>
thing, another 3 1/2 years later the babies roomed in with their Moms<br/>
through the day, another 5 1/2 years later the babies were with you for the<br/>
entire hospital stay, and you were even encouraged to put the side up on the<br/>
bed and have the baby sleep with you.<br/>
<br/>
As to public nursing, I just didn&#39;t with the first, I guess I started doing<br/>
it very discreetly [under a baby blanket] with #3 now aged 25, by the time<br/>
my &quot;baby&quot; was born I&#39;d &quot;just whip it out at any given moment&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
I weaned her just after her third birthday as I had to have breast surgery.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948776639">I always nursed in public until my kids hit 4 or so.  I really never<br/>
thought much about it with my middle son, but I was a little uncomfortable<br/>
at times with my older.  Got over that really quickly, though.  I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten to the point where nursing is like breathing and I just don&#39;t think<br/>
about not breathing in public.  At some times, when it might have negative<br/>
repercussions on the child, I might try to ask him to wait until later or<br/>
until we get home.    I tell them that it will make the other poor people<br/>
who either aren&#39;t still nursing or whose parents weaned them too early or<br/>
who never nursed jealous to see him nursing.  Being sensitive, considerate<br/>
little boyz, they have always been willing to wait so that others&#39;<br/>
feelings aren&#39;t hurt.<br/>

Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>
