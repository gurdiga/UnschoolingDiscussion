<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227597053">Tell me, if your friend decided to read up on the Catholic religion, do you<br/>
think she should set herself up to lead mass and give communion?  If she<br/>
studies the Torah, do you think she should proclaim herself a Rabbi and do<br/>
Bar Mitzvahs?<br/>
<br/>
Well, she needs is to find a new name for whatever it is she is doing<br/>
because they aren&#39;t vision quests and she can&#39;t lead them anymore than she<br/>
can be a Catholic priest or proclaim herself a Rabbi.<br/>
<br/>
Which is precisely what I was talking about with regards to wannabes and new<br/>
agers.  But hey, don&#39;t take my word for it, come on over to one or several<br/>
of the &quot;real&quot; Indian lists (yes, there are plastic shaman, fake Indian,<br/>
wannabee and new ager lists proclaiming themselves Indian) and ask several<br/>
hundred folks from dozens of tribes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Quite frankly, real American Indians get tired of all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the new-agers and all the bull that is out there from self-appointed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;experts.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Really?? Hmm. . . my experience has not been this. A group of<br/>
&quot;new-agers&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; as you call them was welcomed with open hearts and arms into a<br/>
Lakota-Sioux<br/>
&gt; &gt; sundance. They are open to hearing of others experiences and seeing if<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; &gt; can use that information to benefit their journey.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was thinking about this the other day after discussing vision quest<br/>
&gt; &gt; things with a friend of mine. She has incorporated some of the native<br/>
&gt; &gt; things and some things she has gathered on her own to create  her own<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; &gt; of leading vision quests. Of course, it is not the &quot;true&quot; Lakota way,<br/>
&gt; &gt; rather it is her own way that she has felt led to lead (that sounds<br/>
kinda<br/>
&gt; &gt; funny!). Anyway, my point is that different cultures and belief systems<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;borrow&quot; ideas and ways of doing things and have their own thing. I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;borrow&quot; some of the ideas in Little Tree and use them in my own life.<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; &gt; can get all caught up in the truth and what that may or may not be<br/>
&gt; &gt; according to some expert. I prefer to trust my own intuition about what<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>it just isnt worth discussing with you, because of course you are right about <br/>
everything and every subject, and any disagreement with you is so obviously <br/>
wrong. i think of myself as a fairly tolerant person, but the arrogance I <br/>
feel coming from you is overwhelming. it&#39;s not something i want to continue <br/>
to engage in. . . way too toxic for me.<br/>
