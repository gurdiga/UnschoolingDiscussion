Hi, Michele and everyone else!<br/>
<br/>
I have been a long time subscriber to this list, but have contributed<br/>
little so far.  I unschool (or, as I prefer to term it, learn naturally)<br/>
with my three sons in Indiana.<br/>
<br/>
I have compiled a long list of books related to the unschooling concept.<br/>
The list can be found at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/heartland/trail/3405/unschoolingbooks.html">http://www.geocities.com/heartland/trail/3405/unschoolingbooks.html</a><br/>
<br/>
 Some of these books are specifically on &quot;how to unschool&quot;, but most of<br/>
them are books that expound upon the basic premises of the unschooling<br/>
way of life.  They are about the celebration and honor of childhood,<br/>
non-conformity, self-reliance, self-determination, liberation, trust,<br/>
nature, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Many of these books can be found at your library or local bookstore.  I<br/>
have each of the books linked to Amazon so you can read the readers&#39;<br/>
reviews and synopses.  My goal is to get more reviews written from<br/>
strictly a homeschooling/unschooling point of view and include the<br/>
reviews with my list.  So, if you have read any of the books on the<br/>
list, I&#39;d appreciate your review.  (I do have David&#39;s book on the list<br/>
and would love to get your personal review!)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps,<br/>
Nancy</div>

Thank you so much for the invaluable list of books on your site.  I<br/>
bookmarked it to go back to again and again.  What a wonderful resource!<br/>

<br/>
can I forward this post to someone who&#39;s a &#39;school-at-home&#39; mom wondering how she can motivate her child to learn?  I know, don&#39;t get me started, but that&#39;s where she&#39;s at right now, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve tried to adress :-)<br/>
<br/>
TIA!<br/>

The website I&#39;m working on is for homeschoolers anywhere, of any kind. <br/>
The book list is only part of the &quot;Natural Learning&quot; section, which is<br/>
only part of the larger, more inclusive &quot;L.I.F.E. (Learning In Family<br/>
Environment)&quot; section.<br/>
<br/>
I very strongly uphold the unschooling concept, but I have information<br/>
on the website that can be useful for homeschoolers using any kind of<br/>
method.  Please do forward your friend any information.  I want the<br/>
website to be a compilation of several homeschoolers contributing their<br/>
perspectives and stories.  The site still is very much a work in<br/>
progress, but I&#39;d like to get as many homeschoolers contributing to it<br/>
as possible.  I want it to be helpful to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The general L.I.F.E. address is:<br/>

When you say &quot;unschooling books,&quot; do you mean books specifically about<br/>
unschooling, or books that would be good for unschoolers to use? I can&#39;t<br/>
find the previous message from this thread (must have already deleted them),<br/>
so I don&#39;t know what the previous recommendations were.<br/>
<br/>
For books specifically about unschooling, you can find some of our favorites<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.FUN-Books.com/homeschooling.htm">http://www.FUN-Books.com/homeschooling.htm</a> and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.FUN-Books.com/learningresources.htm">http://www.FUN-Books.com/learningresources.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll find descriptions and reviews of &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; or &quot;How<br/>
Children Learn&quot; by John Holt, &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith,<br/>
&quot;The Homeschooling Book of Answers&quot; by Linda Dobson and many more.<br/>
<br/>
From the main page at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.FUN-Books.com/">http://www.FUN-Books.com/</a> you&#39;ll also find links to<br/>
books for lots of different subject areas like reading, pirates, ballet,<br/>
horses, math, or science.<br/>
<br/>
Our family has been unschooling for over 10 years, so you can be sure you<br/>
won&#39;t find a bunch of text books or curriculum packages on our site!<br/>
