<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019754836">I was hoping that some of you guys could help us with this:<br/>
In May the SCA is having this big war thing that Jason really wants <br/>
to take Jaiden and Avery to it, I was wondering if they were old <br/>
enough (1.5 and 4) for the whole weekend or if we should only go for <br/>
the day. We have never taken them camping and we are trying to decide <br/>
if this is the way to go for our first time. <br/>
<br/>
Another question:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried checking out the different SCA websites for this event and <br/>
none of them have &quot;general information&quot; links that are active so, a <br/>
newbie like myself can&#39;t find any info. If we go do we have to be in <br/>
period dress? or can we just visit? Do you have to be a memeber to <br/>
camp? Is it okay to bring children? All the sites I have found seem <br/>
to be personal sites for members or just giving info to people that <br/>
already understand whats going on, and I don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
So any info would be helpful, we are trying to decide if this is <br/>
something we should get into now, or wait until the kids are a bit <br/>
older.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :-) Rebecca</div>

<br/>
Where do you live?  What event is it?<br/>
<br/>
We took kids when they were little.  Buy chemical light sticks (Cylume <br/>
lights, which are in the fishing section at stores, usually) and let each one <br/>
have one each night.  They can put them inside the covers or under a pillow.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If we go do we have to be in <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You do have to be in costume all the time.  It&#39;s not a spectator situation <br/>
like a Renfair.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Do you have to be a memeber to <br/>
camp? Is it okay to bring children?-=-<br/>
<br/>
There will be fees and they might be higher for non-members.  You can have <br/>
kids there, but depending where you are you might have to fill in extra <br/>
waivers and forms for kids.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So any info would be helpful, we are trying to decide if this is <br/>
something we should get into now, or wait until the kids are a bit <br/>
older.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a one-day event would be an easier thing to try.  Or a one-day visit to <br/>
the war, but sometimes that&#39;s expensive, with big-event fees.<br/>

Well then you know more about it than I do. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SCA events are not supposed to be for spectators, by the corporate rules.  <br/>
But Caid&#39;s ignored those rules for a long time.<br/>

<br/>
A Renfair is not an SCA thing.  It&#39;s a money-making show with opportunities <br/>
for interaction with costumed performers.    SCA is a participants only <br/>
thing.  I suppose they&#39;re doing demos or tours for the public on those days <br/>
you named.<br/>
<br/>
I would just go and look around, then, if I were you, and if it seems fun <br/>
start collecting some dishes and costume parts and looking for cloak <br/>
material!  <br/>
<br/>
Have you already tried google.com, putting in the name of the event?<br/>

just lists of merchents, bards, stuff like that...Jason(dh) used to <br/>
go when he was younger and his Mom went last year before she moved <br/>
away and she dosen&#39;t belong to the SCA so I know it&#39;s open to the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90466413">I have taken a 3 week old baby camping at Civil War Reenactments;<br/>
generally folks who are into the hobby of historical recreation<br/>
are the BEST for making you welcome and helping out - but, and I<br/>
am speaking for Civil War and Revolutionary War folk only as far<br/>
as my experience goes, they put a LOT of work and money into<br/>
creating the impression.  If you wander in and Farb it up, their<br/>
effort is somewhat wasted.  Not what you want at all.<br/>
<br/>
If I were thinking about trying to hook up with an event with no<br/>
prior relationship to the group, I would e-mail whoever is the<br/>
contact on the web page or for the Kingdom and ask if there is a<br/>
&quot;buddy&quot; or mentor family who can help you through the tough<br/>
parts, loan some clothes (to this day I can outfit almost any<br/>
family in passable clothes over 3 centuries - it won&#39;t be<br/>
elegant, but it will be sufficient to the task), help with the<br/>
general layout of the event.<br/>
<br/>
We first took our 6 y.o. when she was 8 months old, to an event<br/>
that ended up being rained out when a hurricane came through.  We<br/>
were camping authentic (long skirts, wood fire cooking, sleeping<br/>
on the ground with a bit of straw); her brother trenched our tent<br/>
and that of some friends; we waited out the storm before<br/>
evacuating.  She gets sooooo confused when the Brownie Scouts<br/>
&quot;camp&quot; in cabins with bunks, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
If you like the atmosphere, you will find no better place for the<br/>
raising of kids.  The sutlers/tradesmen/craftspeople will share<br/>
their talents for hours with kids and remember them from year to<br/>
year.  Almost always the events are &quot;safe&quot; in the sense that a 5<br/>
or 6 can be out of your sight for hours, with somebody else<br/>
keeping a watchful eye - and you&#39;ll get their kids later for the<br/>
same opportunity.  Because you are not cheek by jowl with the<br/>
folks all the time (unless it becomes and organizing principle of<br/>
your life) you can tolerate much more intimacy than you might in<br/>
another social setting.<br/>

<br/>
Well, the SCA wars are re-enactments. SCA in general is for people that want <br/>
to dress up and LIVE medieval times.<br/>
Ren Faires are a bunch of different groups/vendors that are open to the <br/>
public. An event meant as entertainment.<br/>
We were just at a Ren Faire a couple weeks ago and our local SCA club was <br/>
doing sword demos...but they were just one of many groups there doing demos, <br/>
acting, selling etc....<br/>
If you want to do SCA stuff, it&#39;s generally for people that want to get <br/>
involved. Although lots and lots of folks come just for the day or weekend, <br/>
they are expected to dress up and try to blend in.<br/>
Maybe your local club has a different type of event than ones we&#39;ve <br/>
attended...but down here, the wars are taken seriously and get even more <br/>
attention to detail than our typical events. <br/>
&#39;Course the war that everyone goes to down here is the &quot;Gulf Wars&quot; which is <br/>
one of the larger SCA events. <br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

They try to loan garb and feast gear for newbies so you can attend without <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702373145">Okay, this is the info that I have now, just in case anyone is interested :-)<br/>
It is a SCA event and not a Renfair per say, but because it is taking place at a state park they can not completely restrict public access. So from sunrise to sunset Fri/Sat the public is more than welcome to attend, costumes are not mandatory but are prefered. From sunset to sunrise Fri/Sat those not in costume will be asked to leave, not sure how it will be inforced but my guess is that most people understand and will respect their wishes. Now Sun. I guess if a different matter You must be in costume to attend and I think it may be for SCA members only or you must be with a memeber to attend. <br/>
From what I understand is that this event started kinda small but as the public learned about it and wanted to attend, and the park saying that they couldn&#39;t completly close off access for the whole weekend and it has now evolved into something quite huge.<br/>
