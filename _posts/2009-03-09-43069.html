<div id="ygrps-yiv-876748737">Hello there,<br/>
I am about to be homeschooling my daughter.  We do right now, but she is<br/>
only four.  My problem is: she is incredibly social and now that it&#39;s warmer<br/>
weather, the neighbors are in and out of their house all the time.  As soon<br/>
as she sees anyone, she wants to run out and talk to them for ever, and<br/>
they&#39;re trying to do chores, have private family time, and she is seriously<br/>
wanting to go hang out ALL the time.  I was telling a different neighbor<br/>
this, and I&#39;ve mentioned it to some others (not in her hearing of course) so<br/>
everyone is saying, &quot; of course you&#39;ll have to send her to school in the<br/>
Fall then.&quot;  Well, I wasn&#39;t thinking that, but I am trying to help her<br/>
develop her inner resources so that she can learn to have fun by herself.<br/>
<br/>
I think I was reading somewhere, perhaps, Hold on to your kids, that when<br/>
kids start trying to peer relate or intensely is when they need their<br/>
parents the most to help guide them and teach them new things.  Can anyone<br/>
relate to this?  Does anyone have any suggestions.  I did try to get her<br/>
involved in some dramatic play (which she loves, where we act out stories<br/>
we&#39;ve read), and then a sewing project (plastic sewing needle through felt<br/>
didn&#39;t work very easily) until she saw little brother on his bike and then<br/>
some neighborhood girls that she hadn&#39;t met yet and totally lost interest.<br/>
<br/>
 Also, most people that she meets aren&#39;t that friendly.  Seriously.  She is<br/>
four, and a lot of &quot;older&quot; kids just aren&#39;t interested in playing with<br/>
almost five year olds.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my question is, should I be worried about her--that her social<br/>
needs aren&#39;t being met?  Is she bored?  Not learning enough new things?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice,<br/>
Kim<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like she might enjoy being a part of a good homeschooling group. <br/>
They don&#39;t have to be radical unschoolers - just willing to be nice and <br/>
respectful about unschooling. If your state has a list or website, <br/>
that&#39;s a good place to find local people. You might decide to organize <br/>
your own group. Try to find or organize a group that is very informal - <br/>
not a coop, but a playgroup.<br/>
<br/>
Make a lot of play dates for her. Go to the library during school hours <br/>
- that&#39;s a good place to run into other homeschoolers. Homeschoolers DO <br/>
have a lot more hanging around time. My daughters have always been lucky <br/>
enough to have other unschooled kids to hang out with. Rosie has a <br/>
couple of unschooled friends she can&#39;t remember not knowing - they met <br/>
when she was 4 years old.<br/>
<br/>
If you live in a place where it just really isn&#39;t possible to meet up <br/>
with other unschoolers or reasonably relaxed homeschoolers, you can <br/>
focus more on groups that have similar interests or groups focused on <br/>
social opportunities. That could be 4-H, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls and <br/>
Boys, or sports, dance, theatrical productions, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids don&#39;t want to do anything organized, but others eat it up! <br/>
You&#39;re going to have to think about your own child to figure out what <br/>
will work well for her.<br/>

she can do with you or on her own, but I&#39;d seriously let go of trying  <br/>
to help her change. She is a social person. She needs it like she  <br/>

but I bet others do :-)<br/>
<br/>
She wants to be friendly. She just doesn&#39;t know how. You can&#39;t teach  <br/>
her but you can give her pointers and help. She&#39;ll internalize it as  <br/>
she&#39;s able.<br/>
<br/>
But I would definitely get her out with other kids more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suggest finding some local inclusive homeschooling groups that have <br/>
regular park days for unstructured play (rather than focussing on academic <br/>
classes as do some groups). Not only will she find other children of a wide <br/>
range of ages that will play group games all together, you won&#39;t have anyone <br/>
suggesting that she should be put in school for social reasons.<br/>
<br/>
At these homeschool groups you will find individual friends for her for <br/>
playdates, including possibly some slightly older girls who could be willing <br/>
to come over sometimes and play with her, and you will learn about other <br/>
social and learning events. For example the dance class that my daughter has <br/>
made the center of her life since she was three was originally found through <br/>
my local homeschool park day group. Other moms continue to organize events, <br/>
outings, and train trips to other towns.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn now 9 currently plays most often with a five year old, the two year old <br/>
across the courtyard, our neighbors who are almost six and just eight, two <br/>
sisters who are eight and ten, and another family who are two, five, nine <br/>
and twelve. All of these children are homeschooled except for the two year <br/>
old. She loves playing with little kids, as do many of the other kids she <br/>
knows from homeschooling groups and unschooling conferences.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;then a sewing project (plastic sewing needle through felt<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; didn&#39;t work very easily) until she saw little brother on his bike and then<br/>
&gt; some neighborhood girls that she hadn&#39;t met yet and totally lost <br/>
&gt; interest.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t push or try to force crafts on your daughter against her will <br/>
or inclination, or be offended when interacting with other kids looks more <br/>
interesting. Some kids just love crafting more than others, and timing is <br/>
also everything.<br/>
<br/>
The artistry of children is a subject very close to my heart. I tend to feel <br/>
dubious about kit crafts that seem like adult initiated pointless busy work, <br/>
as compared to making something that the kids want to make or have for <br/>
reasons of their own. Children need real quality art supplies and useful to <br/>
them materials (which can include felt or cardboard boxes or styrofoam <br/>
packaging or duct tape) for free exploration and to be supported in forming <br/>
their own goals and project plans. I find that Jayn comes and goes with her <br/>
manufacturing activities - but she always comes back to them because she is <br/>
making things that are important to *her*. At the moment she is making  bead <br/>
and gold wire earrings to sell online and at craft fairs, and helping me <br/>
develop projects and ideas for my latest couple of writing projects about <br/>
crafting.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion is to start doing some stuff in the yard like starting a <br/>
vegie or flower garden, or a mud patch, together that might welcome some of <br/>
the other neighborhood kids in to play and join in.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am trying to help her<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; develop her inner resources so that she can learn to have fun by herself. <br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whatever her temperament is, and it may be that she is extrovert and highly <br/>
social, unschooling allows you to honor and celebrate it, instead of trying <br/>
to change it. Unschooling is about living in the real world, not isolating <br/>
from it - at least not all the time.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn was this age &quot;fun by herself&quot; consisted of fantasy doll play and <br/>
water exploration on a ladder by the sink for relatively brief periods like <br/>
40 minutes within my hearing. The vast majority of her time was spent <br/>
interacting with me. Even when playing with friends, she wanted me nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers usually put their relationships with their children as their <br/>
first priority. Does your dd want to be by herself more? It seems not from <br/>
what you have reported. Or is it really that you want to occupy herself and <br/>
so you can get other stuff accomplished? The time our children really want <br/>
from us can be so much more than we could have imagined before they came in <br/>
to our lives. I am constantly in awe of the level of time and energy, both <br/>
emotional and physical, that unschooling parents are willing to invest in <br/>
their children&#39;s happiness and activities.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;they need their<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you have read a more about unschooling, you will learn that these are <br/>
two very different actions. Try www.sandradodd.com/unschooling .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733695663">Karl went through a lot on the social scene similar to what you&#39;ve written<br/>
about your daughter.  He still walks up to perfect strangers and is very<br/>
comfortable starting conversations... of the 5 year old variety.<br/>
<br/>
He has noticed many times that people aren&#39;t interested.  And been<br/>
disappointed about it.  He&#39;s even dealt with kids who were in school and<br/>
though they are now homeschoolers, they actually were unfriendly and harsh<br/>
at times, partly I suspect because they&#39;re very much of the school age<br/>
segregation mindset, as well as Karl is simply at different developmental<br/>
stages than they are, and the things Karl wants to do are not the things<br/>
they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
It was hard for him sometimes.  He asked me about it at one point and I<br/>
mentioned that sometimes in order to get along with others, it helps to just<br/>
join what they&#39;re doing rather than to try to convince others of his play<br/>
idea... that anything different --no matter how *good* the idea is--<br/>
interrupts what they&#39;re already busy with.  He figured out more about that<br/>
as he continued getting together with others, and he seems to have fun<br/>
joining without having an agenda sometimes.  He&#39;s figured out more about<br/>
when to introduce a new play idea.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed watching him changing tactics and interacting with others.<br/>
Because he was sometimes struggling pretty hard, I made it a point to stick<br/>
close and help with distractions if the kids got in each other&#39;s hair.  It&#39;s<br/>
a lot of fun and I learn things *I* don&#39;t know.  :)  I was always very shy<br/>
in school, and it&#39;s interesting watching someone who is much more outgoing<br/>
up close.  Karl is different and watching how others develop social skills<br/>
is totally fascinating to me.  I know some things about people that a 5 year<br/>
old doesn&#39;t have the experience to know yet, and I&#39;m also learning a lot.  I<br/>
think it&#39;s great that we can learn so many things together.<br/>

Do kids get bored in school?  I think that most kids are bored in school.  Do they learn loads of new and interesting things in school?  Maybe not. <br/>
<br/>
How about storytime at the library?  We go less often now, but with my two older kids we went every week.  Even just going to the library provides many socail opportunities.  <br/>
<br/>
And following her interests, look into classes offered in your community.  My kids do dance, gymnastics, and karate right now ... they have enjoyed playing on the little league t-ball and soccer teams ... lots of social opportunities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311066926">I was a bit startled about 12 &quot;groups&quot; until you sent in your correction. 12 <br/>
families sounds like a lot to meet once a week at a park. Regularity <br/>
promotes friendships. My friend who started a now thriving park day did it <br/>
by relentlessly turning up at the park at the same time every week rain or <br/>
shine, winter or summer, regardless of who else or how many others promised <br/>
to be there. Now the whole big group goes to dinner after every long park <br/>
day. It took close to two years, and she did not rely only on an online <br/>
presence to network.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that if there weren&#39;t enough opportunities local to me, I would be <br/>
travelling. I do in fact - Jayn has friends who live 30 miles away in two <br/>
directions. My favorite park day is 25 miles away (not that I do that every <br/>
week, but I would have if there had not been 5 other local opportunities). <br/>
Now Jayn&#39;s dance class and the park day following are the anchor of our <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
Are you being rigid about your son&#39;s nap time? Could he sleep in the car <br/>
seat or on a blanket at the park if he is too big for a sling? I guess the <br/>
good news there is that naps get less important and shorter as children age.<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested the library. Ours have book clubs but my dd is not <br/>
interested yet - others younger than her have been.<br/>
<br/>
I think in your situation I would be at the playground every day where there <br/>
are other younger-than-school-age kids, even if they are accompanied by <br/>
nannies instead of parents.<br/>

Yes.  When we lived in TN with a great homeschool group we seldom went<br/>
because of my school and/or work schedule.  The library though!  We lived in<br/>
town and went almost everyday.  Karl loved it.  It was always busy with many<br/>
kids to play with and all the personnel knew Karl on a first name basis.<br/>
Very welcoming bunch of people.  That was our primary social outlet for a<br/>
long time.<br/>

Karl had zero interest in books (now he&#39;s more interested).  The library was<br/>
for playing with the train set and at the lego area and the puppets and all<br/>
puzzles.... and the computers.  There&#39;s way more than books at many<br/>
libraries these days.<br/>
<br/>
Try several.  If you&#39;re like Karl, you&#39;ll prefer the bigger libraries.  One<br/>
in SC where we live now has music listening stations.  He&#39;s all over that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, try children&#39;s museums.  There&#39;s so much to do at a place like that.<br/>
It takes hours for Karl to get around to all the things he can play with and<br/>
he just eats it up.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a shortage of kids to play with, *I* play with Karl.  :)  It&#39;s<br/>
one of the blessings of being a parent: you get to be a kid again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879542632"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Also, most people that she meets aren&#39;t that friendly.  Seriously.  She is<br/>
&gt; four, and a lot of &quot;older&quot; kids just aren&#39;t interested in playing with<br/>
&gt; almost five year olds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I guess my question is, should I be worried about her--that her social<br/>
&gt; needs aren&#39;t being met?  Is she bored?  Not learning enough new things?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any advice,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>your description sounds somewhat like my now 7 year old when he was 3 or 4.  we went to the park and library ALOT.  i asked kids over and we went to the play thing at burger king when it was too cold for the park.</div>
