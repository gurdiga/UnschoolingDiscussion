Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, during a confrontation with my biological mother she <br/>
admitted to naming me Bridget Mary for more than the fact that she liked the<br/>
<br/>
name.   My father wanted to name me Jessica Catherine and as far as he knew <br/>
thats what my name would be.  Well my Mother was mad at my father for <br/>
getting her pregnant as she didn&#39;t want me in the first place so she decided<br/>
<br/>
at the last minute to name me Bridget (because my father didn&#39;t like the <br/>
name) and  Mary (because she was supposedly Catholic at the time) Apparently<br/>
<br/>
she also thought that having the initials B.M. or B.S. (my maiden name is <br/>
Schwaderer) would be a cute way of getting back at my father too.  After <br/>
that I didn&#39;t want my name anymore so I changed it to Holly because I liked <br/>
it and my friends said that the name Holly suited me better anyway.   <br/>
However, now that I go by Holly I kind of feel like a fake using that name <br/>
sometimes and wonder If I overreacted to my biological mothers hurtful <br/>
comments by changing my name.   Either way, thats how I came to be called <br/>
Holly. =)  I didn&#39;t mean for it to be such a long story =)<br/>
