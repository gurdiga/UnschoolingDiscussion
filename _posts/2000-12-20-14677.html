AMERICANS UNITED CRITICIZES BUSH MEETING WITH BLACK CLERGY TO DISCUSS<br/>
TAXPAYER SUPPORT FOR RELIGIOUS MINISTRIES<br/>
<br/>
Effort Has The Trappings Of Political Bribery, Watchdog Group Asserts<br/>
<br/>
Americans United for Separation of Church and State has criticized<br/>
President-elect George W. Bush&#39;s upcoming meeting with black clergy to<br/>
discuss taxpayer funding of &quot;faith-based&quot; social service programs, saying<br/>
the meeting looks like an effort to bribe church leaders.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bush apparently believes he can buy support in the religious community by<br/>
offering to eviscerate the First Amendment through tax funding of religion,&quot;<br/>
noted Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United.  &quot;This has all<br/>
the trappings of political bribery. The president-elect is going to learn<br/>
that America&#39;s religious community is not for sale.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bush staffers have announced that the meeting with black clergy will take<br/>
place in Austin tomorrow. The move was widely interpreted as an effort by<br/>
Bush to shore up support among a constituency that voted heavily against him<br/>
on Election Day.<br/>
<br/>
Lynn said Bush&#39;s efforts come at the expense of the First Amendment. He<br/>
asserted that Bush&#39;s much-touted &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; is merely a<br/>
code phrase for forcing taxpayers to support religious ministries that offer<br/>
social services. Bush has stated repeatedly that he believes churches should<br/>
be able to get tax funding for these programs without watering down the<br/>
sectarian nature of their projects.<br/>
<br/>
Bush&#39;s gambit, Lynn asserted, is of dubious constitutionality. &quot;Bush is<br/>
proposing an unprecedented program of government funding of religion,<br/>
involving literally billions in taxpayer dollars,&quot; he said. &quot;His plan for<br/>
the social services would essentially merge church and state into a single<br/>
bureaucracy that would dispense religion alongside government aid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lynn noted that Bush plans to establish an &quot;office of faith-based action,&quot; a<br/>
branch of his administration equivalent to a cabinet-level post, which will<br/>
coordinate the effort to distribute tax money to churches and other houses<br/>
of  worship.<br/>
<br/>
Continued Lynn. &quot;Under this scheme, church soup kitchens would be free to<br/>
coerce needy people to pray before helping them. Fundamentalist groups could<br/>
refuse to hire Jews, Roman Catholics and atheists and still get a windfall<br/>
in taxpayer money. There is simply no way to reconcile taxpayer-supported<br/>
religion with the First Amendment. One or the other must give.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lynn also noted that the Bush proposal is politically unwise. A key<br/>
component of Bush&#39;s &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; calls for government-funded<br/>
religious school vouchers, yet African American voters in Michigan and<br/>
California joined all voters in those states in rejecting vouchers by wide<br/>
margins in  ballot referenda last month.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, exit polls conducted during the election show that Americans of<br/>
all races and income levels favor fixing troubled public schools over<br/>
vouchers by a margin of nearly 5 to 1.<br/>
<br/>
Concluded Lynn, &quot;It is alarming to me that one of the president-elect&#39;s<br/>
first  official actions is an assault on the First Amendment. This is a<br/>
clear sign  that the wall of separation between church and state is due to<br/>
undergo sustained attack from the White House over the next four years</div>
