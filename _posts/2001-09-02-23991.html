&gt;     We had several calls over the course of my childhood from my father <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; how he fell asleep driving and had an accident. I figured it out by the <br/>
&gt; time <br/>
&gt; I was 12 or so and had to drive to bars to pick my father up. Luckily <br/>
&gt; living <br/>
&gt; w/ my mother in another state and learning to drive b/c we lived on a farm <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; was able to do this on my yearly visits. Lovely.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>very personal question, but would you have rather that he not be a part of <br/>
your life at all? <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, I had 2 alcoholic parents...my father dried out by the time I was 20 <br/>
and I still have good memories along with the bad.  I miss him dearly now <br/>
and yes, we had the broken promises along with many other broken things in <br/>
our life.<br/>
<br/>
The hard one was my mother as she became a drunk later in my life and got <br/>
very abusive with it and it is still hard for me to forgive her even now, 5 <br/>
years since she has passed away due to her drinking.  She got sick and the <br/>
doctors told her that if she drank anymore it would kill her and she did it <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My son has been raised without a father or a father figure in his life and <br/>
truthfully, I like my memories with my dad but would not subject him to the <br/>
life I had no matter what.  I hated the walking on eggshells and wondering <br/>
when the eruption was coming...hated when I tried to talk to him, he was <br/>
not always there and  many other things.<br/>
<br/>
It is a tough call...but I know that my son is alright, and that is what is <br/>
most important to me.<br/>

Too often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve.<br/>
