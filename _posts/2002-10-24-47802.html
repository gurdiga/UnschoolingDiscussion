<div id="ygrps-yiv-914795821">I spanked my child rarely, but I could tell a huge difference when I did.  She would get very angry and scream and she would hit me back when she didn&#39;t get what she wanted, etc.  I decided that I didn&#39;t want that type of anger in my house and I basically decided one day that I would never hit her again.  I just take a deep breath or I give myself a time out to cool off.  It only took about 2 weeks for me to see a difference and I love it.  Now, no one hits or screams.  We all need time out to cool off sometimes, but it&#39;s much more loving.  I just explained to my husband what I had noticed and learned from the experience and he agreed because he could also see a difference in the way the family interacted.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, honestly? It was really hard. (Not deciding to not spank, dealing <br/>
with the situations.) Here is my story. (I&#39;ll try and keep it short.) Darin <br/>
had a worse childhood than I so he was never too happy with the idea of <br/>
spanking to begin with. <br/>
<br/>
I was one of those Moms who lightly slapped hands that got into a bowl of <br/>
food as it was passed by the child&#39;s seat. I would smack a bottom once with a <br/>
sharp NO upon finding a child climbing on a counter or getting to close to <br/>
the street, or any other transgression. One day, Moly was just about three, <br/>
Jack was still a baby, and she was in the kitchen helping me. I told her to <br/>
get her stool and climb up so she could help. She just stood there, looking <br/>
at me. I couldn&#39;t figure out why, so I just repeated myself and said, *if you <br/>
want to help, you have to get up here, you are too small to reach even with <br/>
your stool* She just looked at me and, with tears in her eyes said, *but you <br/>
will spank me.* I had told her NO and spanked her for climbing so often (she <br/>
was a climber) that I had really put her little mind in a twist. She wanted <br/>
to help me, I wanted her to help, she had to get up to my level to help, but <br/>
had always gotten in trouble for being in the exact place I was telling her <br/>
to go to. I made up my mind right then and there not to spank anymore. It <br/>
took a long time. Many times I would see her hesitate before doing something. <br/>
And honestly? I never ever thought that a smack on the bottom was any big <br/>
deal. I was hit with belts, spoons, paddles, once with a dog chain, once with <br/>
a rubber hose. I thought I was being a good parent. From then on, I took lots <br/>
of deep breaths, I counted to ten, it was sheer will power to keep from doing <br/>
something that was so ingrained in me. What happened about a year later? Jack <br/>
was 2 and ran out in the street, he was inches from being hit by a car, which <br/>
didn&#39;t stop, just kept speeding down the street. I ran after him, and just <br/>
started hitting. I must have spanked him 6 or more times. And hard enough <br/>
that even with a diaper, he felt it. I was crying, and yelling at him. I <br/>
shook from fright for an hour after. I went to the bathroom and my hair was <br/>
sticking up, I was sweaty and flushed. I looked like a mad woman. And my <br/>
little girl came in to me and said, *You hurt my baby! You said you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
hit me, why did you hit my baby?* I try not to think about that. But I did <br/>
it, and there it is. I hit Moly for just being a normal kid, and I came very <br/>
close to beating Jack because of my fear. So I take lots of time before I <br/>
even talk to my kids, cause I was yelled at a lot as a child. And I just <br/>
remind myself of all the times I cried in my room after being hit and <br/>
thinking how much I hated my parents. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Hi everyone, I have a question.  For those of you who spanked, once you <br/>
decided to stop how did you deal with those situations that had caused you <br/>
too spank?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I swatted my first child on the diaper/butt. Her father did spank her <br/>
once so hard it left a bruised bottom. I very honestly told him that if he <br/>
ever did that again, I would kill him. After that he never laid a hand on <br/>
her but his words were probably much worse. It wasn&#39;t long after that I had <br/>
my revelation and stopped the swatting. Once I make up my mind to stop <br/>
something, it&#39;s always been easy for me to do. Can&#39;t say what I went to was <br/>
much better but I used time outs. I guess more for me than her. Sending her <br/>
to her room calmed the situation for us both. It took me quite a while to <br/>
find that talking and figuring out wher she was really worked best.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, was your partner/spouse for or against the idea? And if they were <br/>
against the idea, how did you go about showing/convincing them that there is <br/>
a better way and it will work if they give it a chance?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t convince him, I divorced him!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529315649">Well after a lot of reading in this bunch of threads I have decided to<br/>
add my story. It&#39;s all about peeling the onion and constant shifts in<br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Our DD just turned three, still happily nursing, and we made a conscious<br/>
decision from the get-go not to spank under any circumstances, to<br/>
homeschool, and a little later not to use punishments, and then more<br/>
recently, to unschool forever. We are both 41. I felt I was led on this<br/>
increasingly radical path initially by reading some William Sears and<br/>
John Holt. Also &quot;How to talk so your kid will listen...etc&quot;, and &quot;The<br/>
Aware Baby&quot; which talks about compassionately understanding a baby&#39;s<br/>
need to cry as communication - this encourages parental behavior that is<br/>
the opposite of the abhorrent crying it out theory btw. I read some<br/>
Brazelton, took on his useful information about the wide range of what<br/>
is &quot;normal&quot; for infant development, and left behind some of his more<br/>
conservative &quot;children should learn to be autonomous&quot; stuff. I also read<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s Not Fair, Jeremy Spencer&#39;s parents let him stay up all night&quot;<br/>
which is what first alerted me to the possibility that punishments,<br/>
consequences and time-outs were not necessary to child rearing. (I don&#39;t<br/>
like his &quot;send them away if they are behaving obnoxiously&quot; concept - and<br/>
this list has helped me with alternative strategies there.)<br/>
<br/>
One of the big decisions I made was not to label or perceive what Jayn<br/>
does as being &quot;naughty&quot; or in any way other than **ordinary behavior**<br/>
for a little child. This is step beyond what I had already read about -<br/>
the fairly standard in childrearing texts notion: Label the behavior as<br/>
the problem, not the child. Of course this is better than labeling the<br/>
child, but a lot of these ideas can be just strategies for getting a kid<br/>
to do what you want them to NOW, including go off to school each day. Do<br/>
you get that I spent most of my pregnancy/early nursing time reading?<br/>
<br/>
Six months ago Jayn just did not want to do something or other. I was<br/>
feeling frustrated and angry, and so was she, and I knew that in another<br/>
family there would be spanking by this point. At my wits end I picked<br/>
her up and gave her a big zerble kiss (a raspberry) on her belly. Well<br/>
whatever the problem was evaporated. I was amazed to see my suddenly<br/>
happy little girl. It was a &quot;shift&quot; moment that helped me want to look<br/>
further, dig deeper in to how to do this respectful parenting life, and<br/>
stop and wait when Jayn is doing something that &quot;makes me angry&quot;.<br/>
Because the more I go on, the more I realize it isn&#39;t her making me<br/>
anything, it is **my** reaction that is **my** problem. <br/>
<br/>
If I get that sense that it would be spanking time in another household,<br/>
then that is definitely time to show Jayn some love. I am trying to<br/>
internalize the NVC process - harder with DH than DD. ;) Even so, I<br/>
still get my husband saying to me &quot;you sounded really angry talking to<br/>
Jayn just now&quot;. I guess I sometimes sound angrier than I realize. Thank<br/>
goodness he is around to tell me. <br/>
<br/>
Where do I get my notion of &quot;another household&quot;? My mother spanked and<br/>
screamed at me my whole childhood, as well as being very controlling.<br/>
She didn&#39;t need any tools - her hand was like iron. Later she would come<br/>
in to my room, crying and apologizing, promising not to hit me again.<br/>
How I ranted in whispers in my room of the unfairness of it, waiting and<br/>
yearning for that late night visit from the penitent. I remember my<br/>
throat being sore from not shouting. I screwed up many of my early<br/>
relationships, even the ones with nice men instead of controlling<br/>
abusers, because I needed conflict to feel love. <br/>
<br/>
When I try to remember my childhood, I have no memories of my home life<br/>
or my mother unconnected with crying or pain. I have no idea what I did<br/>
to spark the spankings. I do remember telling some school friends as a<br/>
teenager that I had been a naughty child who must have deserved to be<br/>
spanked. I feel so sorry for that little girl. Today I realize my mother<br/>
had unrealistic expectations of a child&#39;s behavior, and her own problem<br/>
with uncontrollable rage, and she says nowhere to go for help in those<br/>
days (1960&#39;s). <br/>
<br/>
About ten years ago my mother told me that she had come to realize that<br/>
she had been an emotionally abusive parent and she wanted to apologize<br/>
for always shouting at me and calling me names. I thought at the time<br/>
that I made a decision to forgive her, although I was amazed that she<br/>
basically didn&#39;t remember hitting me so much, which was what I<br/>
remembered. She chose then to reveal that she had been horribly<br/>
physically abused all her young life by my grandfather (4 years old<br/>
being beaten with a belt) and caned repeatedly by a school principal in<br/>
a way that is a felony now. Gramps had been abused in his turn by Great<br/>
Garna as she was called. This bad childhood has been the reason for<br/>
every mistake she ever made (even recent ones). Ten years ago, I felt<br/>
like it was just another burden of her emotions that I had to carry. <br/>
<br/>
Now that I have my own daughter, I find it is harder for me to feel<br/>
forgiving, but easier for me to let go of her burdens. I would rather<br/>
avoid her than have to remind myself not to feel responsible for her<br/>
feelings about whatever the issue may be. Our conversations are not<br/>
intimate. She remains often critical and controlling, but speaks so<br/>
sweetly. Her philosophy is if you nag at someone enough they will do<br/>
what you want them to, for which actions she then takes the credit.<br/>
Someone quit smoking? She made them stop. Sometimes her little remarks<br/>
are like a poison, sifting through my thoughts. What if they are true<br/>
and she is right? I finally had to say to her, &quot;Are you trying to make<br/>
me get a divorce?&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;Then stop criticizing my husband&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As Jayn grows older I frequently have moments of almost out of body<br/>
schism when I suddenly think &quot;Mum would have hit me if I had been doing<br/>
this&quot;. It could be something as simple as making a mess with water.<br/>
These realizations make it hard for me to accept her apology in my<br/>
heart. She said to me, &quot;I felt about you the way you feel about Jayn&quot;.<br/>
There must have been something in my face, because her next words were<br/>
&quot;you don&#39;t believe me&quot;. I don&#39;t. If she had felt the way I do, she<br/>
couldn&#39;t have done it. A thousand generations of abuse and fury. Well it<br/>
stops here: the chain is broken. I am the bulwark against the teeming<br/>
rages of my family history. There is nothing that Jayn could ever do<br/>
that would cause me to spank her, or believe she deserved to be spanked.<br/>
<br/>
With gratitude,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367162128">Robyn, <br/>
<br/>
Reading your post was like watching a really intense movie scene with a scary <br/>
soundtrack.  You wrote that really well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; . She said to me, &quot;I felt about you the way you feel about Jayn&quot;.<br/>
There must have been something in my face, because her next words were<br/>
&quot;you don&#39;t believe me&quot;. I don&#39;t. If she had felt the way I do, she<br/>
couldn&#39;t have done it. A thousand generations of abuse and fury. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it goes back a thousand generations.  I think there were times <br/>
and places when children were treated better.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the hitting of children came with Christianity.  What I would like to <br/>
know to help me confirm or deny this is how typical Moslem kids are treated.  <br/>
Not during wartime, so this might be a bad season to ask, but ideally.  In a <br/>
stable family do they beat their babies? Toddlers?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s the idea of sin and that Jesus could come at any moment (the Big <br/>
Inspection) that brought about a lot of violence against children.  &quot;Hurry up <br/>
and UNDERSTAND so we will pass muster when Jesus comes.&quot;  Our lives must be a <br/>
snapshot moment at all times.<br/>
<br/>
But in order to get those snapshot perfect moments, too  many parents have <br/>
hit children.<br/>
<br/>
I think if we had a movie of all the spankings that happen in the U.S. just <br/>
today, October 25, and we  had to sit and watch that that some of us would <br/>
puke, and some might just die of sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
If we had a movie of the spankings received just by people now grown who are <br/>
on this list, it would be a much shorter movie than that October 25, 2002 <br/>
film.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there are people here on a list supposedly dedicated to how children can <br/>
learn naturally who are defending parents&#39; right to &quot;spank&quot; (my mom always <br/>
called it &quot;a whippin&#39;&quot;) their children?<br/>
<br/>
There is no formerly-spanked person who doesn&#39;t know about Spanking.<br/>
<br/>
There are MANY formerly-spankied people who justified in their own minds as <br/>
good and necessary for the person they are now.   We are TRYING to show a <br/>
loving alternative, and people are saying &quot;nope, nope, nope!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mother explained to me, when I was 20 and my half-brother was a year old, <br/>
that if you spank them for any disobedience when they&#39;re babies, when they&#39;re <br/>
older they&#39;ll just &quot;mind you&quot; without any memory of the spankings.<br/>
<br/>
I saw her spank my brother in the crib for crying when he woke up wet.<br/>

family still in the middle east. We worked for a homeschool charter<br/>
school, and most of the people in the main office were fundamentalist<br/>
Christian. She told me about having lunch with one woman, and how<br/>
appalled she was when the woman told her how children are born full of<br/>
sin and that you had to, basically, beat the sin out of them. My friend&#39;s<br/>
beliefs were that children were born good, and until they were 6 or so,<br/>
that didn&#39;t understand that they were doing wrong and therefore shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be punished. Her younger son was always around, and I never saw him<br/>
punished for &quot;misbehavior&quot;. He was maybe one when we first met, and 3<br/>
when we moved away.<br/>
<br/>
Her older son is Rain&#39;s age (6 when we met) and a lot more was expected<br/>
of him. She didn&#39;t spank him but his father did, and she didn&#39;t agree but<br/>
didn&#39;t interfere...<br/>

Hi, Robyn --<br/>
<br/>
Did she *choose* to be a parent, or did her body just pop you out<br/>
because she had sex with your father?  (I&#39;m older and many of my friends<br/>
and in-laws were born before The Pill was available.)  I think there&#39;s a<br/>
big difference in how women might feel towards their children in the<br/>
different circumstances.  Imagine the feelings of a woman with 8 or 10<br/>
children who didn&#39;t get to ask herself &quot;can I handle one more?&quot; before<br/>
having more.  It doesn&#39;t justify abusiveness, but I can understand feeling<br/>
resentful in circumstances like that.<br/>

 the end of my long post, go through this too? I hope not.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh gosh Nancy. I just want to hug you. You&#39;re an incredible person, not only <br/>
to have survived all that crap, but to come out wanting to parent so <br/>
differently and gently.<br/>
I understand the passing stuff on...without wanting to.<br/>
But I never had the harsh experiences you did. The damage done in my home was <br/>
really minimal compared to so many people here.<br/>
I do remember my Mom ranting at me over how I&#39;d folded the towels. If you <br/>
didn&#39;t fold them a certain way, she got all upset.<br/>
I thought it was the only right way to fold towels and berated my dh after we <br/>
were first married for doing it wrong.<br/>
He thought I was nuts, I thought he was being difficult.<br/>
Here&#39;s the funny thing. After all these years of folding towels dh&#39;s way, and <br/>
not worrying how the kids fold them at all, my Grandma comes to visit.<br/>
She always cleans while she&#39;s here (we finally just shrugged and decided it <br/>
wasn&#39;t worth trying to stop her, its&#39; the only way she feels needed in life) <br/>
and when she stacked towels in our cupboard she explained &quot;this is the only <br/>
way I could make them fit nicely&quot; and lo and behold, they were folded the <br/>
&quot;right&quot; way my Mom had taught us.<br/>
Grandma couldn&#39;t even let go when she saw we did it differently, but &quot;fixed&quot; <br/>
our cupboard for us. ugh.<br/>
We just smile, say thanks and do it our way after she&#39;s gone.<br/>
Once in a while I have to say &quot;NO Grandma, we don&#39;t want it that way!!&quot; in a <br/>
very assertive manner over other issues.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have noticed my problem with guilting the children into helping me <br/>
around the house. That is something from my Mom.<br/>
She yelled a lot too. And it wasn&#39;t always in a mean way, she had six kids, <br/>
three of which were adopted and she yelled across the house to get our <br/>
attention rather than coming to us.<br/>
Funny thing is, she hated it when we did the same...but needless to say, we <br/>
all yelled and had a very noisy, boisterous house.<br/>
Luckily, it was mostly happy noise. And she was really great about letting <br/>
kids be kids. Mudpies, puddle stomping etc... was the norm.<br/>
So I see some of her not so nice traits come through in me and the unhappy <br/>
way it affects my children, but I also get to enjoy some of the really great <br/>
things that she left me with.<br/>
A love for storytelling, willingness to get messy with the kids, creatively <br/>
thinking up fun things to do, love for reading and books etc....<br/>
<br/>
I see so much of what she did wrong was diluted from the harsh way she was <br/>
raised, and now in me, I really long to end it so that my children will not <br/>
pass this legacy of anger on to their children.<br/>
My Grandfather on the same side of the family (Maternal Grandpa), had an <br/>
alcoholic father and practically raised himself and siblings. He had it <br/>
ROUGH, so his harsh parenting style was much better than what he had known.<br/>
My Mother learned a lot of stuff while I was still at home, and now I hope I <br/>
can do well enough to end it all.<br/>
The coolest thing about my family, is they all regret being physical and <br/>
harsh  in ANY way and have encouraged all of us to never spank or yell.<br/>
Both my Dad and Grandparents have been advocates for gentle parenting.<br/>

&lt;&lt; After all these years of folding towels dh&#39;s way, and <br/>

<br/>
Towel-folding is a lot like that story that goes around among women about <br/>
cutting the ends of the ham.  Thinking that&#39;s how hams were supposed to be <br/>
cooked, the granddaughter always cut the ends off.   So her grandmother comes <br/>
to some family dinner, and the granddaughter says &quot;Look, I still make it that <br/>
same way you did,&quot; while serving a little cut-off ham in a big pan.  And the <br/>
grandmother said that she only did it because she had only a pan and a narrow <br/>
little oven.<br/>
<br/>
The mother, in between those generations, just did what her mom had done.<br/>
<br/>
We have two ways of folding towels here.  The square way is for the back <br/>
shower or Kirby&#39;s room (where towels live on one end of the long counter), <br/>
and a narrow way for where Marty takes showers, where towels are stacked on <br/>
the back of the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
I think people should fold towels to fit in the space where they&#39;re going to <br/>
fit.  Same with cloth napkins.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She yelled a lot too. And it wasn&#39;t always in a mean way, she had six <br/>
kids, <br/>
three of which were adopted and she yelled across the house to get our <br/>
attention rather than coming to us.<br/>
Funny thing is, she hated it when we did the same..-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do that.  I yell across the house for people sometimes, even when I&#39;m not <br/>
in a wheelchair. That used to really bug my husband when we first had kids.  <br/>
But to be fair, if a kid yells from another room, I go see what they need.  <br/>
Because sometimes they&#39;re stuck, or really frustrated (so physically or <br/>
mentally stuck &lt;g&gt;) and sometimes they&#39;re about to drop something and are <br/>
only holding it up with some body part against a wall, or they&#39;re in the <br/>
midst of a construction project and they  have glue all over their hands and <br/>
just need one more hand to help get the last piece in, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
And we all try to go gently and quietly to where the other person is when we <br/>
can, too, to avoid the boy-who-cried-wolf effect.<br/>
<br/>
An across-the-board rule of no yelling wouldn&#39;t be as good for us as just <br/>
figuring if someone yelled they must need help!!<br/>

kissed the children on the lips when they visit and your kids said<br/>
&quot;yuck.I don&#39;t like it.&quot; AND talking didn&#39;t seem to change anything<br/>

Oh we yell here too. Just because of the set up of the house and where <br/>
everyone is around here. It&#39;s also a very open floor plan and since we&#39;re <br/>
always on the run, someone usually yells for the person to stop walking so <br/>
we can find each other!!!<br/>

(after 4 years of marriage, but that&#39;s another story...), Tim was just 4<br/>
weeks old, but I cleaned and cleaned trying to &quot;meet standards&quot;.  Of course<br/>
I failed miserably, and she ranted on about what a terrible housekeeper I<br/>
was for days while cleaning it &quot;properly&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Next time she came to visit, the place was a mess.  When she started in on<br/>
me about it, I just smiled and told her I hadn&#39;t had time.  So she cleaned<br/>
it.  Saved me getting all upset, &#39;cause I hadn&#39;t invested any time or energy<br/>
in it.  Now she just believes I live in a pigsty, and I don&#39;t bother to<br/>
correct her impressions; I just quit cleaning about 2 weeks before she<br/>
arrives. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>

hug.&quot; The relative looked shocked then hugged her. The relative <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would tell the inlaws nicely, once, that my children didn&#39;t like <br/>
being kissed on the lips. I&#39;d say it with smiling goodwill.<br/>
<br/>
The next time we went over, I&#39;d be right there by my child and <br/>
reminding them if necessary, before they could do it, nicely, <br/>
smiling, that my child preferred not to be kissed on the lips.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also teach my children to hold out their hands for handshakes <br/>
as people come in to greet them, or to turn their cheek to the <br/>
oncoming kiss. Hard to hit that moving target. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Children have a right to say what is done or not done to their own <br/>
bodies. Teaching children to be &quot;polite&quot; because the person is <br/>
older and a relative is also potentially teaching them to tolerate <br/>
any sexual abuse that comes along.<br/>

bright orange lipstick, and on greeting us, she&#39;d give each of us a big <br/>
sloppy, slimy kiss on the cheek, leaving an orange glob of lipstick.  Now, <br/>
here&#39;s the killer:  She&#39;d stand back, and seeing the orange glob, lick her <br/>
thumb and then proceed to wipe off the evidence.  YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
I got her back, though, at my brother&#39;s wedding when I was 25!  Ahhh, sweet <br/>
revenge! &lt;g&gt;  I felt like the hero of all us cousins who had endured that <br/>
double humiliation stoically because, you know, we kids did not have a <br/>
voice or a champion back in those unenlightened days.<br/>

<br/>
Rain has had issues with her dad respecting her physical boundaries ever<br/>
since he got out of prison, when she was almost 4. He ends up begging her<br/>
for a hug and a kiss at the end of most visits, and she gets really<br/>
uncomfortable but says no most of the time and sticks to her guns. We&#39;ve<br/>
discussed it - his take on it is that he&#39;s her dad and *needs* some<br/>
physical affection from her, that he &quot;deserves&quot; this from his daughter.<br/>
Arrrghhh. Once he waited until she was strapped in her carseat and then<br/>
gave her a big kiss, and I was just so furious with him. He just never<br/>
&quot;got it&quot;. I tried to draw parallels between this and her telling some<br/>
boyfriend at 16 that no, she didn&#39;t want to kiss him - shouldn&#39;t her<br/>
wishes be respected. His response was &quot;But I&#39;m her dad.&quot; This is why I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t let him be alone with her for years, too...<br/>
<br/>
Now that she&#39;s older, we talk some about how her dad really has no one<br/>
else in his life except for her, and that he sometimes expects her to<br/>
fill all of his needs even though that&#39;s not her job. He also tends to<br/>
see love as something that has to be demonstrated to be seen - love means<br/>
getting and giving presents and physical affection to him. We talk about<br/>
ways to help him feel more secure that feel comfortable for her - she<br/>
likes to bake spice cakes for him, and draw pictures sometimes. I try to<br/>
balance doing things for him with not feeling like taking care of him is<br/>
her responsibility, which is a fine line. At almost 10, she&#39;s a lot more<br/>
aware of things, she knows that he&#39;s homeless, and worries about him. <br/>

Maybe she could give him friendly little punches in the upper arm? <br/>
(Like guys do to each other.)<br/>
<br/>
And, by all means, give her a bigger budget for getting him presents if<br/>
it will ease off the pressure to give smoochies.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone remember the title of a book about different &quot;languages of<br/>
love&quot; that discussed different forms of affection being more meaningful<br/>
to different people?<br/>

courage to post what she did. All through this spanking debate I wanted so <br/>
badly to say what happened to me, but just couldn&#39;t. So thanks Beth.<br/>

~Nancy who most times, needs to see someone stronger and further on the path <br/>
being brave. <br/>
