So how  will it be when they&#39;re visiting their dad and their <br/>
mother&#39;s not <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  around at all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Speaking as a &quot;child&quot; of divorce, this is definitely  something to <br/>
consider, however, there is the mental health of the mother  to <br/>
consider also.   If she is better off because she doesn&#39;t  have the <br/>
abuse on a daily basis, she&#39;ll be much more able to meet her  <br/>
children&#39;s emotional needs when they&#39;re not with their  dad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s also quite possible that they won&#39;t be visiting dad until he is much  <br/>
better equipped to father them.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe a loss of everything he&#39;s known to be his life will spur him to make  <br/>
changes for the better, so that he can be a joyful participant in their lives <br/>
at  some point.<br/>

don&#39;t count on that -- I&#39;ve been amazed at how often judges will order visitation -- unsupervised yet -- for men who are clearly a danger to their children&#39;s well-being.  In my single Mom days, my ex asking for and getting visitation was one of my greatest concerns -- enough to make me move 2,000 miles away to apply for custody.  <br/>
