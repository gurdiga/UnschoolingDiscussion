<div id="ygrps-yiv-479025484">Hello, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
New to homeschooling, my family and I are slowly adjusting.  My husband<br/>
and I have two daughters, ages 8 & 10.  We made the decision to<br/>
homeschool because of concerns about social issues in the schools, and<br/>
also because we just didn&#39;t feel the girls were getting what they need.<br/>
They are both very bright, and often complained about the boredom they<br/>
experienced in the classroom. Since bringing them home, we have found<br/>
that they have really lost their natural curiosity.  It seems public<br/>
school has drummed it right out of them!  We began with a canned<br/>
curriculum but within two days knew it would never work for us--too much<br/>
structure and very boring. Next, I tried just pulling stuff together on<br/>
my own, but the girls still weren&#39;t very interested.  We are currently<br/>
trying to &#39;deschool&#39; them, but I am finding all of this very<br/>
stressful--much more so than they!  My husband is very confident about<br/>
unschooling, and I am intrigued, but wary.  I definitely need to be<br/>
deschooled, first!  I have never been a system-bucker, so this is very<br/>
scary, uncharted territory for me.  However, I can&#39;t h*lp but want more<br/>
for my girls.  Can anyone tell me what to expect from my girls?  How<br/>
long will it take them to come around to really wanting to learn,<br/>
again?  How long will it take me to quit worrying about assessments and<br/>
grade-level tasks, etc.?  I would love to hear survival stories from<br/>
parents who have been where I am.  TIA.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard it takes 1 month for each year in school to de-school.  It&#39;ll<br/>
depend on the child.  Mine never went to school so I can&#39;t give you any<br/>
first hand experience.  In fact my dd talks of wanting to go to school.<br/>
When I ask her why she talks of playing on the playground all day.  That&#39;s<br/>
the only thing she&#39;s seen of ps.<br/>
<br/>
As for de-schooling yourself you need to read a book The Underground History<br/>
of American Education by John Taylor Gatto.  I knew I didn&#39;t like ps but<br/>
this book has fueled my stand.  My mother had been an elementary teacher so<br/>
I started young seeing the system.  I had worked in ps first at a police<br/>
academy then at the county office then at a middle school.  Before dd was<br/>
born I told dh she&#39;d never go to ps.  It took the whole time from then till<br/>
K to convince him I could do it.  Now he wouldn&#39;t have it anyother way.<br/>
<br/>
No it&#39;s not perfect & some days I&#39;d love to get them out of my hair but I<br/>
need only a few minutes out of their sight & I&#39;m ok.</div>

Although my kids were younger ( 6 and 7 ) we went through the same basic<br/>
situation.<br/>
First thing I&#39;d like to recommend is that you let them take at least 6<br/>
months off from any type of formal learning.<br/>
&quot; But how will they learn anything&quot; you&#39;re thinking, yes?<br/>
Wait a couple of weeks and then start bringing any books home from the<br/>
library you think might even slightly interest them. I Stuck with good<br/>
literature and good non-fiction (books about Rome that were for around<br/>
grades 6-9 and the Eye Witness books on anything, those types of<br/>
book).Leave them around the house where they will see them. Pick them up<br/>
and let them see you taking an interest in these books.<br/>
Have a family reading time everyday where you read books aloud to them<br/>
for 20 min. After a few weeks you might try to engage them in taking a<br/>
turn reading aloud from it so you can rest your voice.<br/>
Rent interesting, stimulating movies ....my now 10 yob loved the black<br/>
and white Julius Caesar (Shakespeare) because it was simple enough for<br/>
him to follow and fuelled his interest in ancient Rome. He just<br/>
yesterday insisted on watching the most current filming of  Les<br/>
Miserables movie off our satellite dish. He watched it all the way<br/>
through. We got into a great philosophical and moral discussion on why<br/>
Jabert (sp? the cop who pursues Jean Val Jean throughout out the entire<br/>
movie), jumped into the river at the end of the movie, letting Val Jean<br/>
escape.<br/>
Learning will happen in spite of your not teaching them. Your job is to<br/>
provide the opportunities for learning, debate and discussion, and also<br/>
to teach them how to find the information about what ever it is that is<br/>
interesting to them at the time ( how to search on the net, how to use<br/>
encyclopaedias properly, how to use a dictionary and thesaurus etc.,<br/>
etc..).<br/>
<br/>
I like to make sure that the TV viewing is monitored and doesn&#39;t become<br/>
an obsession around our house. It is a monster that my son deals with<br/>
daily. It draws him like flies to honey. He is allowed to watch the<br/>
educational channels but must have permission to watch other things<br/>
...otherwise he&#39;ll sit there literally all day in a zombie like trance.<br/>
<br/>
Right now our house is obsessed with the Olympics and Saturday my 9 yod<br/>
decided to start colouring all the flags of the countries&#39; she  she<br/>
watched competing (her brother and high schooled sister decided to join<br/>
her). There was her Art and Geography and history lesson for the day (<br/>
history because there is no USSR flag anymore and she couldn&#39;t find some<br/>
of the countries in her atlas with the flags listed in it. She had to<br/>
watch the TV to figure what the flag was supposed to look like and I had<br/>
to explain the disassembly of the former Soviet Union).<br/>
<br/>
My 9 yod is now knitting for the first time, she is already looking at<br/>
patterns in a children&#39;s&#39; knitting book. This learning opportunity will<br/>
teach her to follow written directions, plan out a project and estimate<br/>
materials as well as teach her some mathematical skills that are<br/>
required to achieve the end result (knitters and crocheters will<br/>
understand what I mean, mk1&#39;s and yo&#39;s and decreases etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be too frightened of the process and have faith in your children.<br/>
It may take a year or more to see significant results (that&#39;s how long<br/>
it took me and I am ever so glad I waited, and had faith in my kids<br/>
abilities to learn on their own).<br/>
Children are never taught in school either they are just given<br/>
information and are given the opportunity to learn the material, but<br/>
it&#39;s in a noisy, crowded environment without the benefit of individual<br/>
attention. It&#39;s up to the child to learn from the instructions, ideas<br/>
and the materials provided by a teacher. Nobody can force a child to<br/>
learn anything, they have to be willing/wanting  to learn it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058263126">Hi Ruth and Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
It seems public<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school has drummed it right out of them!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, Public school teaches lots and lots of lessons, very few of them<br/>
academic in nauter.  :(<br/>
<br/>
We are currently<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trying to &#39;deschool&#39; them, but I am finding all of this very<br/>
&gt; stressful--much more so than they!  My husband is very confident about<br/>
&gt; unschooling, and I am intrigued, but wary.  I definitely need to be<br/>
&gt; deschooled, first!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being wary is where your stress is coming from.  If you could just tell<br/>
yourself that nothing you do for the next 6 months is going  to ruin their<br/>
lives or leave the uneducated from the remainder of their lives,  maybe you<br/>
can relax?.  Place your trust in your husband. He surely doesn&#39;t want the<br/>
kids to grow up not learning, so let him has his way for 6 months.  (course<br/>
you might not want to tell him this outloud.. he might have a heart attack.<br/>
&lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have never been a system-bucker, so this is very<br/>
scary, uncharted territory for me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is this the same thing as saying you were always a good girl and did what<br/>
everyone asked?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Can anyone tell me what to expect from my girls?  How<br/>
long will it take them to come around to really wanting to learn,<br/>
again?  How long will it take me to quit worrying about assessments and<br/>
grade-level tasks, etc.?  I would love to hear survival stories from<br/>
parents who have been where I am. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, no, no one can tell you this about your girls.. so much of it depends<br/>
on how hurt they were by the system, how they react to stress, how old they<br/>
are.... so very many factors.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should put your worry on hold,  layaway maybe.  Then in 6 months<br/>
you can pay the balance and get it out again.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s explore what grade level means.... what do you think 5th grade math<br/>
is?<br/>
