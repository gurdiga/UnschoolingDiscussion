&gt; How about the idea of swapping or timesharing or just plain sharing lodging<br/>
&gt; for travel purposes?  I think travel is a wonderful aspect made possible by<br/>
&gt; the freedom from madated school schedules that homeschooling, and<br/>
&gt; Unschooling in particular, provide.  We have a 2,000 sq. ft. home with a<br/>
&gt; couple of extra bedrooms and/or couch space and we happen to live within an<br/>

Not sure I can help you there.  We would love to travel, but with two<br/>
babies, a new house that is getting a big interior facelift, and a pending<br/>
adoption, our travel funds are rather nonexistent.  This is just not a good<br/>
time for us to leave home.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t suppose you could stow away somewhere?....ah well, another time.<br/>
Perhaps the opportunity will arise, or be created by you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, this sounds great!  My problem is that although we have over 2,000 sq. <br/>
ft., with four kids there are no extra bedrooms!  The other problem is that <br/>
the closest *big*  (ha ha) city that I live by is Evansville, IN.  I don&#39;t <br/>
really think there will be many people fighting to come my way!  However, if <br/>
anyone does, I am sure my kids wont mind doubling up and letting someone have <br/>
their room!<br/>

Where is Evanston?  My grandmother is in Bloomfield.  We are going to be with her<br/>
for a week in August.  She is 93, and  my Aunt and Uncle are going on a trip, so<br/>
I&#39;m going with my kids to be with her.<br/>
Is that close?<br/>

    Evansville is in the Southwest corner of Indiana.  Are you going to <br/>
Bloomington?<br/>
It is about 2 hours from Evansville.  If it is Bloomfield, I will have to <br/>
look it up, because I haven&#39;t heard of it.  That doesn&#39;t mean that is doesn&#39;t <br/>
exist, of course, there are alot of cities in Indiana that I haven&#39;t heard of <br/>
until recently.  Meeting homeschoolers on the internet is really widening my <br/>
horizons!   Hey, does that mean mom is unschooling too?<br/>
I guess that is what we have all been trying to get across huh, that <br/>
unschooling is a family lifestyle?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-381255331">Bloomfield is very close to Bloomington.  About 35-40 min.<br/>
Unschooling definitely is a family affair around here.  With Mom just up the<br/>
driveway, and her being the only grandparent left, my kids live in a wonderland.<br/>
