&gt; kids from time to time - and get great results at undoing these<br/>

&gt; child should ever be put in is one that can be instantly demolished.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By that I mean the diagnosis should immediately lead to a resolution<br/>
&gt; of the problem, or the diagnosis is not to be trusted, no matter how<br/>
&gt; &quot;logical&quot; it may sound or how &quot;close&quot; it may fit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, the other type of box that can be instantly demolished is<br/>

**Something I have suspected for a long time.  Naming some trait that is just <br/>
part of who a person (child) is seems to limit that person to that one trait <br/>
and reinforce it and blow it out of proportion.  I also think it takes <br/>
something (credibility?) away from the people who seriously need help of the <br/>
med or psych variety.  **<br/>

Nance (constantly trying to figure out and balance and rebalance in my mind <br/>
all the aspects of my children without labelling too much -- altho <br/>
information is helpful and labels can be telling -- but too quickly <br/>
implemented by someone with an ulterior motive lead to something bad -- well, <br/>
you get the see-saw thoughts that go on in my mind!)**</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks, Debbie - this can be a highly charged 
subject and I didn&#39;t want to offend anyone who has been helped by finding a 
diagnosis - but I did want to warn of the downside.&nbsp; Neill&#39;s writings 
really do open many loving doors&nbsp;for these kinds of problems.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And do keep seesawing, Nance!&nbsp; The right 
metaphor for the balance we seek in life is not the scales, it&#39;s the 
pendulum.&nbsp; Nature is not statically in balance - it waxes and wanes equally 
in constant kinesis.&nbsp; (Poor America is constantly waxing, it doesn&#39;t know 
how to wane.&nbsp; No wonder so many people get cancer.)</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837107035">Gus I totally agree with what you presented.The only reason I got used<br/>
to using the labels,is because in the public school,I couldn&#39;t get any<br/>
help for my son unless the labels were used,but that doesn&#39;t matter now<br/>
because he will be home again :)Have a good Sunday ....deb</div>
