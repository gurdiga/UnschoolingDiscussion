&lt;&lt; It really depends on what it is. Vegetarians have mentioned letting their<br/>
 kids choose whatever they want to eat outside the home. . &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And some of us veg-heads even cook meat for our children.....I buy the food <br/>
they like and want, with my .02 thrown in occasionally!<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

&gt;&gt; That kind of pain blacks people right out.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Do you know any stories (even one) of someone choosing to stay home and die<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; of something like that?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes....Before I joined the Army I was a Med Surg nurse in Maine and saw<br/>
&gt; people who ignored the slight pain they had in their abdomen and the fever.<br/>
&gt; Thinking it was just the flu.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not a choice to stay home and die, that&#39;s thinking they have the flu<br/>
and that it&#39;s not worth going to the hospital over.<br/>
