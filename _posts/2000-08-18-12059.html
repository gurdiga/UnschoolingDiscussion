<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958466803">&lt;&lt;Instead of focusing on abortion as having been the answer, <br/>
perhaps the focus should be on preventing pregnancy in the first place. <br/>
Clearly, that woman had major problems.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For me this is the crux of the problem... I can only talk about America and <br/>
England, two countries I&#39;ve grown up in and as long as girls/women are <br/>
sexualized and encouraged to look for men as the answer to anything and <br/>
everything and pregnancy as a means of escape.. I believe abortion, abuse etc <br/>
is going to continue.  So it starts with the parents... As I have seen there <br/>
are many parents who are just not involved with their kids and these would be <br/>
considered &quot;good parents&quot;... They have a baby in a two parent family, 6 weeks <br/>
after birth the mother goes back to work (doesn&#39;t matter which one does it) <br/>
and puts the baby in daycare from 6:30am-6pm 5 days a week... No bonding with <br/>
mother or father... But they make lots of money and isnt&#39; that more <br/>
important? (joke).. So then the child doesn&#39;t havea connection with either of <br/>
the parents really, maybe a superficial one, and then off the go to public <br/>
school where they get sucked into the crowd and find a niche with other girls <br/>
that have been through a similar disconnected experience with their parents.  <br/>
These girls are all looking for someone to love them and need them and want <br/>
them... In all of this the media and society in general is telling them how <br/>
to look (thin and beautiful) and how to act (being in love with a boy is the <br/>
only way to be).  So it&#39;s not surprising when at 15 years old they end up <br/>
pregnant... Because of their real disconnection with anything outside <br/>
themselves, it&#39;s easy to see how it&#39;s very easy for them to flush a baby down <br/>
the toilet, whether that&#39;s through abortion or actually having the baby and <br/>
killing it.  It makes complete logical sense given their upbringing... <br/>
Alternatively they wait until they are 18, get married to some looser <br/>
(because who would have taught them what a good man, husband looks like, if <br/>
their parents are not available) and then get pregnant, only to find out that <br/>
having a baby is the toughest thing that will every happen and a much harder <br/>
job than going to a 9-5 outside job.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion of a scenario that&#39;s happening all over the westernized <br/>
world.  And we are suppose to be the ones that have the higher intelligence <br/>
levels.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well said Dawn, <br/>
It is being so disconected from family that sends girls off searching <br/>
for love, I&#39;m sure that at 15 I would have said yes to the first guy <br/>
that asked.....  I was desperately in search of someone to care for <br/>
me.   I can see that now, but then I was sure I was in love forever, <br/>
fortunately my love was a good person.   However he wasn&#39;t really <br/>
the right person for me, we were married for 26 years and had 9 <br/>
children, he is a good person, just not for me, we are too different <br/>
in our values.   At first the children held us together, but eventually <br/>
they drove us apart, our different attitudes to child rearing and a few <br/>
other issues.   I can not for a second regret those 26 years, my <br/>
children are wonderful people who I love dearly, however my life <br/>
would have been better if I had the belief in myself that I was a <br/>
lovable person and that it would be better to wait and find someone <br/>
who I had more in comon with, where we wanted to live, our <br/>
thoughts on child rearing, our thoughts on school, government etc.<br/>
<br/>
In raising strong confident daughters who know they are loved and <br/>
valued we give them a better chance at a good life.... my oldest is <br/>
a carreer woman who when she turns 25 soon will have been <br/>
working for 10 years, she quit school and got a job the second she <br/>
could as she believed that she was wasting her time in school.  <br/>
I always let her know that she could do anything that she put her <br/>
mind to and that her education etc were her descision.   I hope I <br/>
am able to do as well with the little ones, from my outspoken <br/>
almost 12 year old I think I am on the right track with her.<br/>
