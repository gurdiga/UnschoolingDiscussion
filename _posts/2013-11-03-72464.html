<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668187368">I just finished an online survey after having bought something from the Apple store online.<br/>
<br/>
Usually those are blah blah, same old questions, but today there was something new, in all my life of completing surveys and forms, and I wonder about it!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How old were you when you finished full-time education?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that&#39;s a good one.  &quot;Education&quot; (other people putting their choices of ideas toward you), they asked, not &quot;learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was in grad school a few times, but not &quot;full time.&quot;  And is high school &quot;full time&quot;?  Maybe that&#39;s why they give so much homework, to make it total 40 hours. :-)  But these same young teens who aren&#39;t legally able to work in factories or even ice cream parlors, SHOULD they be doing anything &quot;full time?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
I said 20.  <br/>
It&#39;s a survey—the answers go into a pile as data to tumble around.  But what will &quot;20&quot; mean to them?  I had a BA in English at 20, because I finished high school at 16.  As races go, I &quot;won—not much, but just that... the oddity of being out &quot;young.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
When he was 29, my husband got a BS in computer science (with a minor in theatre, when he was planning on a math degree—they &quot;graduated him&quot; to get him to stop living there at undergrad rates; I think he was messing up their stats and they hoped he would continue at the more expensive grad school fees, but he didn&#39;t).  <br/>
<br/>
There were some years in there when my husband wasn&#39;t enrolled at the university at all, and some when it was part-time.  So...  would he say 29 on an Apple survey?    <br/>
<br/>
What about Kirby who has never yet been in &quot;full-time education&quot;?  Unless unschooling would be considered that.  And if so... still, what would his response be?  18 when it wasn&#39;t state-mandated?  I never registered him after he was 8.  Would he say....  0?  Never started &quot;full-time education&quot;?  <br/>
