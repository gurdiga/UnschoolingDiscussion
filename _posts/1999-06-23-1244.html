<div id="ygrps-yiv-914063181">To each of you who supplied me with bug info, THANK<br/>
YOU!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I mentioned it before or not... but<br/>
Zac, my 11yo, found<br/>
mating ladybugs the other day!  The female was<br/>
depositing eggs on a<br/>
leaf, while the male was fertilizing them as they<br/>
came out (or so it<br/>
appeared without a magnifying glass).  Anyway, Zac<br/>
had removed the leaf<br/>
from the tree it was growing on, so we then decided<br/>
to place it gently<br/>
in our flower garden.  After a short while, both<br/>
ladybugs flew away.<br/>
Now the leaf is turning brown, but the eggs are<br/>
still on it, looking the<br/>
same.  We&#39;re hoping they &quot;do their thing&quot; and hatch,<br/>
or whatever is<br/>
supposed to happen to them.  It&#39;s pretty amazing the<br/>
things you find<br/>
when you&#39;re not even looking, isn&#39;t it?  We were<br/>
just outside, mowing<br/>
the grass and planting the garden.  Nothing too<br/>
spectacular... then the<br/>
ladybugs and bright yellow spider came our way, and<br/>
we&#39;ve been<br/>
&quot;scientists&quot; ever since!<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte:  Great to &quot;see&quot; you, too!!!!! :-)  We&#39;re<br/>
happy and well.<br/>
Thanks for asking!<br/>
<br/>
