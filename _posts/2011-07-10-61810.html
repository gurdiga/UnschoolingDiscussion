<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473058859">We had just a half of year of homeschool last term and it was really before I got convinced about unschooling. So I had the room set up like a schoolroom, bought a full curriculum, etc. Well, we certainly want to do it much differently this time so I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s the best way to create a creative, fun, engaging environment for my 7 year old ? I ordered some fun books for pleasure reading already and a couple math games, but I realize that&#39;s far from where we want to be.<br/>
      Any ideas for a good inventory of stuff to have on hand to spark his curiosity would be appreciated. He loves science experiments, animals, jet planes, music, art, and<br/>

A list of things might amount to a new kind of curriculum if you&#39;re used to people telling you what you need to get and then what to do with it, so don&#39;t take any suggestions as full and real lists or requirements.    Your attitude toward things is more important than the things themselves.<br/>

You might get ideas about what I mean, and ideas of things you might already have around the house, from these:<br/>

Why not meander through a Hobby Lobby type store and buy anything he <br/>
oooohs over?  It seems like he already has quite a few sparks of <br/>

I would like to suggest that you get out of your old schoolroom as much as possible to help break the schooliness of the books or science experiments or maths games you&#39;ve acquired. Sitting down with books is great, but you and your son might benefit from moving far away from where you&#39;ve been in order to move back without the schooly associations. <br/>
<br/>
There are masses of science experiments described online but you can avoid setting many up as experiments in a contrived way, eg instead of specially filling up a basin of water to test what floats and what sinks why not spice up bathtime and turn it into a game?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have an airport nearby? I&#39;ve spent many hours at the perimeter fence of our nearest airport. We&#39;d take the schedules (printed from arrivals/departures before leaving home), an atlas, packed lunch, binoculars, camera, knitting (for me) etc. We often met other plane spotters, who were full of fascinating facts and figures.<br/>
<br/>
We have watched untold numbers of plane related youtube videos  look for things like &quot;scary take-offs&quot; to start you off.<br/>
<br/>
Does your son have any pets? Can he set up some bug environments to examine whatever is local to you (info for good bug set ups available online)?<br/>
<br/>
Re games, my sons have recently discovered plants vs zombies which is fantastic fun. (I&#39;ll be interested to hear other recommendations in this department.)<br/>
<br/>
Once you start thinking of FUN things to do in the areas of your sons interests it can really start to flow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462128806">Some of the most used materials in our home come from the recycle bin--toilet paper and paper towel tubes, yogurt containers, egg cartons, to-go boxes, styrofoam trays......add glue and/or tape and you&#39;ve got the supplies for marble runs, sculpture, structures, invented games, bug habitats, weapons........<br/>
<br/>
PVC pipe in various diameters and lengths are fun too, especially for building water walls and other outdoor water/mud/sand contraptions.<br/>
<br/>
We have a Celestron pocket microscope that also has a USB hook-up, and it gets a LOT of use (it is great to take on hikes, and also fun to hook up to the computer and make movies of the innards of spider carcasses): <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/6dzuh4h">http://tinyurl.com/6dzuh4h</a><br/>
<br/>
Bug nets, buckets, and containers....<br/>
<br/>
Building materials, like Lego also get lots of use, as do our Citiblocs: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Citiblocs-Original-Wooden-Building-Block/dp/B00267SW96">http://www.amazon.com/Citiblocs-Original-Wooden-Building-Block/dp/B00267SW96</a><br/>
<br/>
If you check Ebay, you should be able to find a box of 500+ for under $50.<br/>
<br/>
Posters, maps and diagrams of things he enjoys may be fun to put up on the walls--not to memorize, but to be inspired by.<br/>
<br/>
I buy baking soda, vinegar, corn starch and food coloring in bulk so we always have them on hand for concoctions.  Borax is good to have on-hand too.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/experiments">http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/experiments</a> has some fun experiments, as do many other online sources.  I&#39;ve learned to just let Noor do her thing (over and over again) with these materials and participate in a &quot;Wow, that&#39;s really cool&quot; kind of way rather than trying to point out surface tension, etc.....she comes to realizations on her own and then asks questions which I answer *after* she asks. One of our favorite books for experiments from household materials is: &quot;201 Awesome, Magical, Bizarre, & Incredible Experiments&quot;:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/VanCleaves-Awesome-Magical-Incredible-Experiments/dp/0471310115">http://www.amazon.com/VanCleaves-Awesome-Magical-Incredible-Experiments/dp/0471310115</a><br/>
If you don&#39;t think you can offer experiments without teaching, I&#39;d leave this area alone for now.....do the experiments for fun and learning will happen naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Your son may enjoy Snap Circuits: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snapcircuits.net/">http://www.snapcircuits.net/</a><br/>
<br/>
Mind Ware: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mindware.com/Home/HomePage.aspx">http://www.mindware.com/Home/HomePage.aspx</a> has lots of cool materials.  Some of the stuff is expensive, some not.  Again, be careful if you&#39;re prone to wanting to turn fun into a &quot;teaching experience.&quot;  Let him chose things he finds interesting and let him use them in his own way, without concern for their intended &quot;educational purpose&quot;--There are some small motor kits there that he may really enjoy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632395340">I forgot....if he enjoys building things, keep an eye out at flea markets and yard sales for building materials like hinges and pulleys. Buy him a set of basic, sturdy tools, if you dont already have some at home....add wood scraps, nails, screws, etc.  <br/>

Noor loves Plants Vs Zombies too as well as Angry Birds, but one of her favorite resources for games is the free website Armor Games:<br/>

Fancy Pants, Sushi Cat and Stackers are some of her favorites<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-650553236">For art, the recyclables are great too, as are fabric scraps and all kinds of sewing notions. A hot glue gun can take the place of sewing. Clay and Sculpy are nice to have as well for making all kinds of things; Noor mostly uses it to make her own Pokemon figures and accessories for other toys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851459744">Making it less &quot; schooly &quot; makes total sense. I&#39;m not sure why I felt our dining room had to to look exactly like a schoolroom when the basis of the plan is to UNschool him. <br/>
    We have a few animals at this point; a hermit crab, two very sweet mice, and a dog, and we have a butterfly habitat that&#39;s needing some caterpillars again as he really got excited a out that process.<br/>
       One question...do you use anything maybe resembling a curriculum for math? That&#39;s the only subject I&#39;m still a little nervous about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845780063">Why you are nervous about math? You don&#39;t have to answer, just think about it. <br/>
Are you nervous about math because you have an issue with math? You have an <br/>
issue brought on, perhaps, by the idea that school really underscores that math <br/>
is hard and needs to be gone over and over and over again to just get the <br/>
computational levels. If that&#39;s true. If you have a math phobia of your own, why <br/>
would you want to pass that on to your son? Why would you want him to have huge <br/>
faith in his own ability to learn everything except those things that brush up <br/>
against numbers, which is a huge amount of the world. Surely that would make <br/>
math much more scary and sacred and weird in the context of the rest of stuff <br/>
being unschooled. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have never used a curriculum for anything. Simon and Linnaea are quite <br/>
comfortable with numbers. They don&#39;t get nervous about their inability to handle <br/>
a math problem. Numbers are all over life. It&#39;s hard to avoid them. It takes <br/>
some skill and effort. Simon and Linnaea don&#39;t need to bias their interests <br/>
toward non-numeric things. Like I can remember doing. I can remember being put <br/>
off something because it might have math. What a sad thing. <br/>

The big reason learning math makes people nervous is that schools do a  <br/>
very poor job at helping kids learn it. When kids pick it up from  <br/>
using it -- my daughter probably learned most from video games :-) --  <br/>
it gets absorbed as naturally as speaking. When it gets taught  <br/>
abstractly, divorced from it&#39;s context and real use, it&#39;s as effective  <br/>
as learning a foreign language in school is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150750566">What has helped me is to think about why my kids like what they like -<br/>
beyond the broad subject titles. Does he have a favorite kind of science<br/>
experiment? What kinds music does he like?<br/>
<br/>
For example - my oldest (10) loves animals. Over the years I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>
she really likes things she can classify - so dogs & dog breeds, cats & cat<br/>
breeds, dinosaurs (but not nearly as much as you might think considering<br/>
dinos are a typical kid fascination!). When she added Pokemon to her<br/>
interests, it was easy to see why - all the types & breeds & levels is right<br/>
up her alley! So when I brought out a bird book we&#39;ve had for years, but<br/>
never used - I was pretty confident she&#39;d like it.<br/>
<br/>
I love recording things on Tivo & getting DVD&#39;s from the library about<br/>
subjects that are interesting. I find it much easier to get a quick overview<br/>
of a subject watching a documentary and then I can follow it up with books<br/>
or websites or whatever - that seems to work for Megan also (right now we<br/>
have about 10 different documentaries/tv shows about Egypt sitting on the<br/>
tivo. We may or may not get to them soon. We may never watch them, but they<br/>
are there if we do)<br/>
<br/>
There are shows like Build It Bigger<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/">http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/</a> and Mythbusters that might<br/>
spark his imagination.<br/>
