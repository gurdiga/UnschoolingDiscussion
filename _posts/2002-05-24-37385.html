What is TCS, and what is a Troll? (I know what a troll IS, I mean in this <br/>
context, what is a troll?) <br/>

&lt;&lt; Do you think this is leaning towards forced learning if the <br/>
 child has no interest in those things? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do.<br/>
Not everyone needs computer skills. Other than the basic <br/>
finding-your-way-around-the-internet/computer ones. Anything beyond a basic <br/>
comfortableness with a computer is only necessary for certain people, and it <br/>
should totally be their choice.<br/>
I do want my children comfortable with a computer, that&#39;s easy to achieve by <br/>
having one in my home and giving them unlimited access.<br/>
If they need more than that in their life, they will eventually get it.<br/>
Just like everything else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>TCS is Taking Children Seriously. It&#39;s a parenting philosophy espoused by<br/>
Sarah Lawrence revolving around raising children without coercion and<br/>
treating them with the same respect as adults.<br/>

And I thought pamS&#39;s definition of troll was pretty apt:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; A troll is someone who purposely comes onto a list and posts in such<br/>
&gt;&gt; a way as to annoy people and to disrupt on-topic discussion - the troll has<br/>
&gt;&gt; no real interest in learning about the subject matter of the list - they<br/>
&gt;&gt; simply want to post their own narrow personal beliefs which are sure to<br/>
&gt;&gt; enflame listmembers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859895548">I&#39;m right there with you on this.  Our boys have LOVED making weapons of all<br/>
sorts, I got books like &quot;The American Boys Hand Book&quot;  and &quot;Camping and<br/>
Wilderness Survival&quot;... they spent hours drooling over stick guns, fling<br/>
sticks and animal traps.  It&#39;s like it was bringing out some necessary<br/>
primitive male hunting skill in them.  We got our older boy a BB gun when he<br/>
was about 9 or 10 and he was fascinated with that for a few months.  I think<br/>
it fills a great need in role playing these type of things.  I had a<br/>
pediatrician who told me &quot;If they don&#39;t play with it now, they will when<br/>
they&#39;re older&quot;.    Now they are a bit older, and the thrill has lost  its<br/>
appeal... the BB gun hasn&#39;t been used for months, and the sling shot hasn&#39;t<br/>
been fired for an even longer period of time.  They watch some violent<br/>
movies, but they opt for sci-fi or a reality based theme.  They know full<br/>
well the difference between a movie and real life, and have known this for<br/>
years.  I grew up with the cutest little silver cap gun that advanced the<br/>
roll of caps as it shot.... I loved that thing, more for the way it<br/>
functioned than that it made a bang noise I think. (And I grew up not ever<br/>
shooting anyone!).  I suspect that was a big part of the draw of their<br/>
weapons, some were intricately decorated and meticulously researched before<br/>
they were made.  I have many happy memories of those days.<br/>

Subject: guns was Just my thought on boredom<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
I have always tried to support his interest at whatever level was<br/>
appropriate at the time. I let him play with toy guns, found books in the<br/>
library, rented him movies if he asked. We made bows and arrows, rubberband<br/>
guns and hundreds of different swords. We played castles, Robin Hood, Peter<br/>
Pan conquers Captain Hook, Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, GI Joe and on and<br/>
on. All the while I talked and observed and listened to where he was. (Oh<br/>
and blew away a few bad guys in the process. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Movies like Star Wars were good sources of shooting without any blood. He&#39;s<br/>
watched more realistic ones as he&#39;s gotten older and we&#39;ve talked, talked,<br/>
talked. I&#39;ve talked a lot about the difference between real guns and toy<br/>
guns and what to do if you come across a real one. He has a cousin who<br/>
accidentally shot himself, so that story came out when it was appropriate. I<br/>
tried not to lecture, or sound dissapproving of his interests. But I am his<br/>
Mom and I&#39;m concerned for his safety. I like the idea of going to talk to a<br/>
police officer. I want to take him to a shooting range to get a gunsafety<br/>
course. He&#39;s also going to be doing paintball guns.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still sweet and gentle and cries at sad stories.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
