i am laughing out loud because your house must look exactly like ours. 4 <br/>
kids, 2 bedrooms, 14 chickens, 1 duck, and 3 rabbits outside and 1 guinea pig <br/>
in the garage. all of my neighbors have beautifully decorated homes. i tell <br/>
them i am sorry i have made their property values go down...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556227951">hello -sorry - don&#39;t know your name( you didn&#39;t sign)<br/>
how old are your children?<br/>
we don&#39;t have any chickens but I would like some! wouldn&#39;t eat<br/>
the eggs though-would just like to see them pecking about and<br/>
clucking.<br/>
wish we had a garage as well, it would certainly help to have<br/>
that extra space. we have a shed but that is full too !!<br/>
