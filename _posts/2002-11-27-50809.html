<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854192026">Thanks Sandra, I tried to explain this to my husband but he just didn&#39;t<br/>
understand what supermarket camping was like. I was there 20 years ago and it<br/>
totally amazed me. We&#39;re used to Arizona. Although Arizona has changed too.<br/>
For instance, The Carefree Highway is Carefree no more...<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Was she camping amongst the London set? They all get take outs <br/>
&gt; while camping so not to spoil their Ralph Lauren camping gear ;-)<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That could be! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We camped at Yosemite once, and felt like we were in a parking lot in a city. <br/>
&gt;  We were just passing through, driving from San Jose to Albuquerque (NOT <br/>
&gt; recommended) and it was just me-pregant, Kirby two years old, and Keith our <br/>
&gt; fearless driver and guide.  Even though it was October, they crowded people <br/>
&gt; into adjoining spaces, busses came by to take us to the visitors&#39; center, <br/>
&gt; there were ranger-led things scheduled about every hour, there were several <br/>
&gt; places to eat...  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Next to us was a single guy from Los Angeles, sleeping in a nice new sleeping <br/>
&gt; bag in the middle of his allotted space, no tent, on ground that was more ash <br/>
&gt; than dirt, NO grass.  He was thrilled to be out in nature.  We wanted to get <br/>
&gt; back on the road and get to New Mexico where it wasn&#39;t so structured and <br/>
&gt; crowded and ashen.<br/>
