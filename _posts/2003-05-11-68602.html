<div id="ygrps-yiv-877600791">If I do, I&#39;ll just put a homeschool name on it (our <br/>
current is Barking Dog Free School) and give them some subjects and <br/>
grades like you listed. I figure they&#39;ll accept what I give them. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How many of you have official or unofficial homeschool names? Early on we <br/>
gave ours one, not because we had to, but just cuz. Ours is Collins Cove <br/>
Clothing Optional Homeschool. Collins Cove because we lived across from <br/>
Collins Cove beach when we started homeschooling, and Clothing Optional <br/>
because my son tended to run around nake at the time and we thought it was <br/>
funny.<br/>
<br/>
Now we live across the street from the Harmony Grove Cemetary. I suppose we <br/>
could change the name to Harmony Grove Unschool and Mortuary....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852596721">In California if you use the Private School Affidavit (R-4) method of<br/>
being legal, you must have a name for your school. Some people have<br/>
fancy sounding acronyms that stand for things like Freedom and Fun for<br/>
.kid&#39;s name.Academy. Other folks use their street name, or something<br/>
else that the kids like. I hear that the use of Hogwart&#39;s had to be<br/>
sadly discouraged by numerous parents as being a definite red flag for<br/>
officialdom.<br/>
