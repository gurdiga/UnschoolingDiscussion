And I found a couple of copies of it for sale on half.com.  Make sure you do<br/>
a search for it there as all one word - &quot;Chessmates&quot;, otherwise you won&#39;t<br/>
turn up any matches.<br/>
<br/>
My son used this game to polish his skills after his dad had already taught<br/>
him the fundamentals.  He has really enjoyed it over the years and even now<br/>
occasionally refers back to it for fun.<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t find this game...  I can find reviews, and one review has an<br/>
&gt; aside that says it is out of print.  Ant suggestions?<br/>

&gt;&gt; We bought Chess-Mates CD-Rom for the computer for my son....I think we<br/>
&gt;&gt; got it from Scholatic.....He loves it.  You play against the computer,<br/>
&gt;&gt; but while playing the computer talks to you and shows you options, but<br/>
&gt;&gt; lets you choose the moves.  Then tells you why it was or was not a<br/>
&gt;&gt; good idea.  My 9 yr son loves it and my 5 yr old daughter has begun<br/>
&gt;&gt; playing as well.  I think there are more than one level, too.<br/>
