<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are ALL of them rare?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are they just trying to impress us with ourselves? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, math isn&#39;t my best area, guys, but if there are 16 different types, and<br/>
8 of them involve I, none of the 8 I types are particularly common, seeing<br/>
as only about 25% of the population is introverted.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, even if there is an exactly equal spread of the I&#39;s, there would<br/>
only be about 3% of the general population in each of the I types.  And if<br/>
the I&#39;s aren&#39;t evenly spread, it would be very easy for some types to be a<br/>
very small percent of the population, say 1%, and then other types to be<br/>
bigger, at 5% or so.  But that&#39;s still a small percentage of the general<br/>
population.<br/>
<br/>
So we I&#39;s COULD be impressed with our rarity, if we want to.<br/>

who is sure that pam S. could have explained that much more clearly, but<br/>
hopes you get what she means anyway!</div>
