<div id="ygrps-yiv-591530081">OH YUCK!!!!  Venn Diagrams!  Take them away.  You just brought back to <br/>
my mind those stupid, stupid, stupid education classes I had to take in <br/>
order to become a certified teacher.  Every time I see one of those <br/>
things, I just want to throw up or go to sleep.  Euwwwww.<br/>
<br/>
A Venn Diagram is a diagram that uses circles to show relationships <br/>
between certain things, or groups of things.  The circles intersect in <br/>
some places to show that one thing can belong in two different <br/>
categories at one time, etc.  I&#39;m sure if someone drew one for you, you <br/>
would recognize it.  Usually, it&#39;s an officious educator or <br/>
administrator who draws those things.  They make me puke.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.  You just brought back some bad memories.  You don&#39;t know how <br/>
glad I am to be out of that environment.  School and the whole culture <br/>
there is so disgusting to me now.  I don&#39;t know how I managed to stay <br/>
there so long.<br/>
<br/>
Mimi<br/>
<br/>
PS:  Ok, Ok, I&#39;ve settled down.  Betsy, I don&#39;t mean to hurt your <br/>
feelings or insult you.  I&#39;m sure they can be a good tool, if you give <br/>
them a try.  I&#39;ve just always had a strong aversion to them.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
really given them a chance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797730104">It&#39;s those blobby, intersecting (or non intersecting) circles that are supposed<br/>
to show set membership.  It&#39;s a new math thing that we messed around with back<br/>
when I was in 6th Grade.<br/>
<br/>
If a big sheet of paper was all of homeschooling, then we&#39;d draw a circle<br/>
within &quot;homeschooling&quot; and call it &quot;unschooling&quot;.  There could also be, on the<br/>
same page, a circle labled &quot;homeschooling strictly following a curriculum&quot;.<br/>
You might think those two circles woudn&#39;t overlap at all, but there would be a<br/>
little crescent of overlap that&#39;s part of both of those cicles.  This crescent<br/>
represents &quot;unschooled child CHOOSES to strictly follow a curriculum.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Hard to draw this on a computer screen -- sorry!)<br/>
