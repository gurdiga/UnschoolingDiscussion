<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779480780">&lt;&lt; Why was it necessary? Just curious. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious too, because the New Mexico discussion list has just had a tussle <br/>
over age requirements (I was against them)--three came to light in one week, <br/>
for a dance class, a games day (&quot;10 and up&quot; someone said) and a teens group <br/>
(&quot;15 and up&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I objected, got jumped on, was defended, some people expressed sorrow at <br/>
disagreement, some expressed that the list was more interesting with <br/>
disagreement (unfortunately it was somewhat at my expense), and it will serve <br/>
to divide the group somewhat, for a while, and ultimately create more <br/>
opportunities for some kids from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt Susan had some good reason or another.  The thing that got me <br/>
about the examples in New Mexico were the defenses that a couple of people <br/>
came up with.   Not good defenses.  One was &quot;the games we play say right on <br/>
the box 10 to adult or 12 to adult.&quot;  One was the dance school was forming <br/>
classes by physical development and ability.  Well no they weren&#39;t--they said <br/>
&quot;6 to 8.&quot;  The developmental realities are across a range of 5 to ten or so, <br/>
probably, but they arbitrarily said 6 to 8.   So I was cranky not on behalf <br/>
of my own kids (although Holly at nine was cut out of ALL those activities, <br/>
not that she&#39;d&#39;ve wanted to go to the teen group, although Marty at really <br/>
tall, into puberty and almost 13 might have theoretically wanted to; he <br/>
didn&#39;t), but on behalf of kids with less courageous moms who would never <br/>
question those numbers which were arbitrary at best and purposefully cutting <br/>
off individual kids at worst.<br/>
<br/>
One of the defenders of the 10 yr cut off for the gaming day said &quot;the 2-10 <br/>
group...&quot; and I responded that there IS no &quot;2-10 &#39;group&#39;.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Some six and seven and eight year olds can read great and can play games <br/>
really well.  Some ten year olds can&#39;t read well enough and have no interest <br/>
whatsoever anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite parts of unschooling is the matching of humans to <br/>
interests without grade levels or ages.  I was really grumpy when the Society <br/>
for Creative Anachronism started adding age requirements to various offices.  <br/>
When I joined teens could be officers (except for seneschal, the president of <br/>
local groups who has to sign contracts) and could enter tournaments.  <br/>
Gradually more and more requirements were added until now kids are kids and I <br/>
think it&#39;s a huge step backward.  Kids used to be people there.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The group we hung with in California never had any age requirements,<br/>
although there were some loose guidelines for some stuff, usually with<br/>
some explanation about what specific things might make it difficult for<br/>
significantly older or younger kids. The group we&#39;ve joined here seems<br/>
okay with it, too - most things say something like &quot;around 11 to 13&quot;, and<br/>
it seems clear that a 9 year old or a 14 year old could try it out, too.<br/>
The thing that is different, though, is that so many activities are only<br/>
open to boys or girls, not both...that&#39;s something I&#39;ve never seen happen<br/>
with any other group, and I don&#39;t like it much.<br/>
<br/>
We do know three sisters (12, 14, and 15) who were going to join a teen<br/>
group but changed their minds when the youngest sister wasn&#39;t allowed in<br/>
because she wasn&#39;t 13. :-/<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At the party we were at a week or so ago, the folks playing The Great<br/>
Dalmuti and Bohnanza ranged in age from 7 to, um,  over forty, at least.<br/>
Some even younger kids played on a team with an adult or older kid.  The<br/>
games went on for hours, and everyone had fun. Of course, lots of people<br/>
of all ages had no interest in gaming, and played legos and swung on the<br/>
tire swing or toted babies or knitted or cooked...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to hear that. Cacie spotted the U of A SCA group practicing at<br/>
our local park a few weeks ago and was thinking she&#39;d like to get into<br/>
it,  and I was slowly in the process of gathering info...but I don&#39;t<br/>
really want to get into it, so I was hoping I could sort of help her get<br/>
started and help with the sewing and stuff, but mostly let it just be her<br/>
thing.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But then I&#39;m not sure they are up<br/>
to homeschoolers, let alone unschoolers!&lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably true.  The children&#39;s activities here are becoming steadly more <br/>
schoolish (and not very medieval either).  It gags me, and then because my <br/>
kids don&#39;t go there it looks like I KEPT them from going there.  WHY would it <br/>
look that way?   Because most other families are MAKING their kids go to the <br/>
kids&#39; area.  Huh.  My kids have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Some other adults either don&#39;t believe it, don&#39;t get it or don&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
So they assume kids do what their parents say, my kids choose to just play <br/>
and visit instead of going to school-like kids&#39; activities, therefore I must <br/>
not be cooperating.<br/>
<br/>
Huh. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087418557">I just finished reading my first John Holt book.  &quot;How Children Fail&quot;.<br/>
While I really enjoyed the book and his perspectives, most of the <br/>
concepts weren&#39;t new to me, since I have been reading about <br/>
unschooling and living unschooling for quite a while.  There was one <br/>
thing that did stand out as far as something I hadn&#39;t really thought <br/>
about.  He discussed how so many adults don&#39;t like children.  Not <br/>
just the ones who don&#39;t have them, or are obvious about it, but the <br/>
ones who teach them, or even have them.  It&#39;s something they feel <br/>
guilty about, or won&#39;t admit to themselves, but it&#39;s obvious in their <br/>
attitude.  He mentions that sweet syrupy voice and fake smiles that <br/>
many adults use on children.<br/>
I think there are a lot of adults who have children, but don&#39;t really <br/>
like them.  Or they like theirs okay, but don&#39;t like others.<br/>
I think it&#39;s obvious when people age segregate.<br/>
I think it shows a lack of trust in children, and it&#39;s an obvious <br/>
statment against &quot;undesirable behavior&quot; that is *sure* to come with <br/>
certain aged children.<br/>
I think it&#39;s okay not to like children very much.  I just wish those <br/>
people wouldn&#39;t organize things and decide everyone else must feel <br/>
the same way.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think there are a lot of adults who have children, but don&#39;t really <br/>

<br/>
School makes it worse, too.<br/>
<br/>
Whether realized or not, kids resent being made to go there and blame the <br/>
parents.  <br/>
Parents lose the natural ease with their children they had before the kids <br/>
were in school, and so the relationship is more awkward and distant.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid at school says &quot;My dad says...&quot; the teacher might say &quot;Your dad&#39;s <br/>
wrong,&quot; or if a kid&#39;s mom helps with an assignment and it&#39;s not the way the <br/>
teacher wanted, the message is the mom doesn&#39;t even know 2nd grade stuff.  <br/>
That blatant undermining of the family has been going on for a couple of <br/>
generations, and is getting worse, I think, as schools feel more &quot;important&quot; <br/>
and are emboldened.<br/>
<br/>
Some states don&#39;t allow dropping out anymore.  Kids are supposed to be in <br/>
until they&#39;re 18.  BABYSAT and controlled by governmental strangers until <br/>
they&#39;re 18!  GROSS!  And by then, the kids have been taught by daily practice <br/>
that it&#39;s okay to hate kids from other schools, to ignore or belittle those <br/>
in the class below you (pep rallies that separate seniors from juniors and <br/>
sophomores and the three of those groups are by tradition to torment the <br/>
freshmen are NOT designed to make sweeter people), it&#39;s okay to have school <br/>
loyalty, but family loyalty is to be snorted about.  Visiting parents are <br/>
good for other kids to critique, to comment on their opinions on the mom&#39;s <br/>
sexual value and whether the dads could beat up or be beat up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s altogether gross.  <br/>
<br/>
So when I see a homeschooling group moving toward kids&#39; activities (instead <br/>
of family activities), and age divisions, it comes closer to playing school <br/>
without a building than to the vision of unschooling which is so important to <br/>
me personally.  I really believe in what I&#39;m doing.  It&#39;s not just a lack of <br/>
being in school.  It&#39;s doing things a whole different way every day, not just <br/>
during school hours.  <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m dismayed by our local problems and I hope those who are defending the <br/>
divisions get SOME idea of the objections to them, and the difference between <br/>
looking at a game box or looking at a calendar, and looking at an individual <br/>
child-person.<br/>
