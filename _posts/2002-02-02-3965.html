<div id="ygrps-yiv-190501414">When we first started homeschooling, the unschooling concept<br/>
intrigued me.  I grappled with it and discussed it and tried<br/>
to figure out what it meant and what it didn&#39;t mean.<br/>
<br/>
Holt wasn&#39;t a big help.  Although he described unschooling<br/>
a lot, he never defined it.  He had a lot of educational<br/>
ideas, but he didn&#39;t see himself as the inventor of unschooling.<br/>
He was more of a cheerleader, describing all the wonderful<br/>
ways in which children could learn outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
After a few years, I had enough of a grasp of unschooling that<br/>
I didn&#39;t need to grapple anymore.  I could just do it.  Although<br/>
I continued to refine my idea of unschooling, I no longer had<br/>
any burning desire to pin it down.  It was far better just to<br/>
enjoy being with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
It bewildered me then to see how people wanted to narrow the<br/>
concept of unschooling.  Why, I wondered, get out of the school<br/>
box just to build yourself another one that is just as rigid<br/>
and confining?  Isn&#39;t the point of unschooling freedom?  How can<br/>
you be free if you imprison yourself in doctrine?<br/>
<br/>
In the early days, I defined &quot;unschooling&quot; as &quot;child-led learning.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Child-led learning&quot; works pretty well as a definition, as long as<br/>
you don&#39;t take it too seriously.  It&#39;s easy, however, to carry the<br/>
concept of child-led to the point where it hampers the contribution<br/>
of parents.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, I was in a chocolate mood yesterday.  I baked some<br/>
chocolate chip cupcakes.  When I popped them in the oven, I<br/>
realized I was practicing parent-led eating.  The children, led<br/>
by the scent of baking cupcakes, would eat the physical manifestations<br/>
of an idea conceived of and executed by me.<br/>
<br/>
Most unschoolers won&#39;t carry the child-led doctrine into food.<br/>
When it comes to education, however, parents often think that <br/>
there&#39;s something wrong with putting themselves into the mix.  <br/>
Parents ought not to lead, or, indeed, even influence their <br/>
children&#39;s educations.<br/>
<br/>
If I look to my children instead of the definition, however,<br/>
I see that they often enjoy my contributions to their education.<br/>
Moreover, because I generally respect their autonomy, they can<br/>
tell me when they want me to back off and let them do things for<br/>
themselves.  They can tell me when my ideas don&#39;t work for them.<br/>
<br/>
The children often lead one another into educational experiences.<br/>
One child initiates an activity and the other follow.  Children<br/>
don&#39;t mind following a person with a good idea, as long as the<br/>
leader is going somewhere they want to go.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Child-led learning,&quot; then, while a good start, is not enough in<br/>
and of itself to stand as a whole educational philosophy.  It is<br/>
an important part of unschooling, but it is not, in itself,<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Other people have attempted to define &quot;unschooling&quot; as &quot;non-coercive.&quot;<br/>
This approach has real appeal, as &quot;non-coercion&quot; sounds like it<br/>
would map pretty well to &quot;freedom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Attempting to practice non-coercive parenting, however, made me<br/>
a worse parent.  Focusing on coercion was like a centipede focusing <br/>
on the action of each of his legs.  My attention was directed to <br/>
too low a level, defining things as potential problems when there <br/>
was nothing wrong with them.  Instead of looking to my children for <br/>
what they needed and wanted, I looked to the philosophy for what I <br/>
ought to do.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, I realized that my children didn&#39;t mind many of the<br/>
things that folks called coercive.  They minded other things,<br/>
some of which were not coercive at all.  Moreover, some of the<br/>
things labeled &quot;coercive&quot; seemed to help our family run more<br/>
smoothly and live more happily.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, we&#39;d figured out a sort of system that, while it might<br/>
not map to anyone&#39;s philosophical ideal of unschooling, worked<br/>
pretty well for us.  Basically, this involved tossing out most of<br/>
the philosophy and focusing on our family&#39;s needs.  Instead of<br/>
worrying about what I shouldn&#39;t do, I often found myself thinking<br/>
of ways to help the children get and do what they wanted to do.<br/>
If everyone was happy, I assumed everything was fine.  If someone<br/>
wasn&#39;t happy, we&#39;d work together to solve their problem.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.&quot;  My programmer&#39;s mind had a<br/>
hard time accepting this maxim.  I wanted to probe beneath the<br/>
surface, to fix problems that hadn&#39;t yet manifested themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Human beings are more than glorified collections of software.<br/>
Our lives are organic processes that do not run by simple,<br/>
mechanistic rules.  We are wondrously complex beings who grow <br/>
better in a world that allows time and space for mysterious<br/>
processes that work beneath the surface.  Too much analysis<br/>
can get in the way of living our lives.<br/>
<br/>
A few years back, I noticed that Holt never tried to prescribe<br/>
anything to homeschoolers.  He described examples of unschooling,<br/>
but he never tried to pin it down.  <br/>
<br/>
I further realized that there is nothing new or special about<br/>
unschooling.  Unschooling is just the way most human children<br/>
have been raised throughout human history.<br/>
<br/>
What I want now is a Quaker view of unschooling, one that lives<br/>
outside of all boxes.  Keep unschooling undefined, like Euclid&#39;s<br/>
point or the Inner Light.  Describe unschooling all you want,<br/>
but don&#39;t create an unschooling doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
Doctrine kills.  The only time you can pin something down is <br/>
when it has stopped moving and growing, when it is dead.  In<br/>
the course of defining doctrine, we kill the very thing that<br/>
we&#39;re trying to describe.<br/>
<br/>
Better to let unschooling live free, growing and changing and<br/>
reaching toward the heights of the human soul.  Better to feel<br/>
unschooling in our own lives, and in our children&#39;s eyes.<br/>
Better to turn inward, to tap our inner wisdom and ask it what <br/>
we ought to do.  Better to look to our children and learn from<br/>
them how best to raise them.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need ministers, teachers, or experts.  Our human biology<br/>
has fitted us to parent our children.  Our instincts and inner<br/>
guides can take us much farther than any creed.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t listen to me.  I&#39;m a person with my own strengths and<br/>
challenges, my own agenda, my own blind spots.  Look in your<br/>
own heart, and see your path written there.  Listen to your<br/>
children and hear what they&#39;re trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
Keep unschooling free to work its magic in your life.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Isn&#39;t the point of unschooling freedom?  How can<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You made a lot of good points Heather! :-)<br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re certain that the posters here are saying the things you are<br/>
arguing against, I&#39;d suggest you need to read more carefully without that<br/>
assumption clouding your perception. Please ask people for clarification,<br/>
but not with the assumptions you&#39;ve made. Read also the message boards at<br/>
Unschooling.com to see how the posters express unschooling to newbies.<br/>
Perhaps that will make things clearer.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be assuming that defining something creates doctrine. I suppose<br/>
if someone accepts that premise, then it becomes self-fulfilling!<br/>
<br/>
I can assure you that, being the highly anal retentive person I am, if I<br/>
believed unschooling could be defined by a nicely formatted 12 point<br/>
doctrine or some such, I would have come up with a list of must do&#39;s years<br/>
ago so I wouldn&#39;t have to spend 1000+ hours each year explaining unschooling<br/>
to people. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Getting people to understand unschooling takes *lots* of words, *lots* of<br/>
examples, *lots* of patient understanding to help them get their thinking<br/>
from where it is to unschooling. We could list a bunch of &quot;truths&quot; to be<br/>
accepted, but it would mean nothing. Being able to say children will read<br/>
when they&#39;re ready isn&#39;t the same as understanding why that is so and why<br/>
the standard belief that chldren must be taught is *not* so.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you are naturally more evolved in the natural learning department<br/>
than most people who come to unschooling. Most people bring with them an<br/>
enormous amount of baggage. It can&#39;t be shed just by embracing the<br/>
unschooling philosphy. It can&#39;t even be shed by &quot;getting&quot; unschooling. It<br/>
can take years for people to let go of their baggage. (That baggage so<br/>
comforting!)<br/>
<br/>
To shed that baggage, newbies do need something more clear than &quot;do what&#39;s<br/>
best&quot; or &quot;listen to your chldren&quot;. Though those describe unschooling to<br/>
unschoolers, they are inadequate to those who are still certain that some<br/>
things need to be done to raise decent human beings. People need a huge<br/>
amount of work to get to the point where they can understand that &quot;listen to<br/>
your children&quot; means more than what those words say.<br/>
<br/>
You also seem to be assuming that defining unschooling limits it.<br/>
<br/>
I see defining unschooling as giving people something to shoot for, a goal<br/>
to reach. Though I think if we all could grow up without the mental baggage<br/>
of what we&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to do, then we would all be able to listen to our<br/>
children and give them what they need rather than what we parents think they<br/>
need. In that case doing what&#39;s best for your family would look the same as<br/>
unschooling (without the initial struggle to get it!)<br/>
<br/>
If people are assuming that unschooling means hands off, or no adult<br/>
directed activities, then they haven&#39;t hung around the unschooling forum or<br/>
list for long! I&#39;ve heard of such people -- I&#39;ve heard of feral children<br/>
too! -- but they didn&#39;t get the idea from us.<br/>
<br/>
Some here are noncoercive parents, some less coercive, some less coercive<br/>
than they once were because of debates ;-). But if you want to argue that<br/>
Sarah Lawrence&#39;s brand of Taking Children Seriously and unschooling are not<br/>
synonomous there may be a handful here (if!) to argue with but you won&#39;t be<br/>
able to engage even a goodly portion of the list in that debate.<br/>

Holt&#39;s descriptions and educational ideas.<br/>

I agree with that.  I never liked &quot;child-led&quot; because it causes people to <br/>
seem to think there are two ways:  parent-led or child-led.  If it&#39;s just <br/>
life, nobody has to lead or follow.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Our human biology<br/>
has fitted us to parent our children.  Our instincts and inner<br/>
guides can take us much farther than any creed.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is inspiring, but I look around me to many examples of very bad <br/>
parenting.  Today&#39;s paper (which I rarely buy, but I needed an ad) had a cool <br/>
article by someone I know well!  When she said &quot;my grandchildren,&quot; I  knew <br/>
them personally.  I was reading it to Holly and said &quot;that&#39;s Kyra and <br/>
Katrina!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But their family&#39;s stable happiness was on an inside page.  <br/>
<br/>
The cover, A2 and A4 were given over to review and analysis of the beating <br/>
death of a six year old here last year.  His mom&#39;s boyfriend was trying to <br/>
get the kid to take a bath, just the way the &quot;dad&quot; (as he made the boyr shit.<br/>
<br/>
The articles had lots about statistics of the battered, how many of them <br/>
(over 60% or so in ever instance or particular cited in a long article) had <br/>
themselves been hit or neglected as children.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people do want help with their parenting, and they come and ask for <br/>
help.  <br/>
<br/>
Neither on AOL nor on unschooling.com have I ever seen people press for or <br/>
settle on one single definition, but rather five or ten will be pooled <br/>
together and people can connect the dots as they will.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems that everything peole try to define has some solid unquestionable <br/>
examples, and lots of acceptable ones, and some on the edges that people <br/>
debate.  If a certain song is  not quite jazz and not quite blues, there&#39;s <br/>
some debate.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that there are no examples that all <br/>
listeners would identify as one or the other.    Just because not every <br/>
example has to be defined is true doesn&#39;t mean there shouldn&#39;t be some <br/>
general definitions.  It&#39;s  not important to me personally whether a song is <br/>
rock&#39;n&#39;roll or rock-a-billy or pop, but if for those working in those fields, <br/>
they know what instrumentation, drumming variations and rhythms will make the <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
Just because some people don&#39;t care doesn&#39;t mean nobody should care.<br/>

Maybe I just need to write better!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have a simple question.  Can a parent make learning a priority by <br/>
removing obstacles that stand in its way?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not JUST by that, I think.  (Unless maybe &quot;removing obstacles&quot; would include <br/>
the obstacles of no input, no confidence, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I can ask my kids what they want to do today? I can look for signs of <br/>

<br/>
This is a hard question or I misunderstand it, or possibly both and all.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Priorities,&quot; for me, have to do with the principles used when decisions have <br/>
to be made.   Some people like new furniture and new cars and matching <br/>
dishes, and those are priority considerations.  Our family doesn&#39;t consider <br/>
those things in the top hundred.  <br/>

Book shelves were never used for books because we would only get books if they were in the library.  Things are different now.  We had to go buy more book shelves.  Kids projects and art are on display.  The extra money is spent on books, art supplies, a museum membership, an 8&quot; telescope (my dh has become an amateur astronomer), more computers and enrichment stuff.  We never used to go on vacations so this is an area we need to start saving for, you know - see the world.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also time priorities.  This, I think, will evolve as our learning interests begin to expand.  This line of thought could open up a can of worms for some because they may start questioning whether we are labeling time spent as good or bad.  But I think I know what you mean.  It is more of an attitude.<br/>

Maybe just &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse,&quot; or &quot;closer to the goal,&quot; or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard arguments that there is no such thing as &quot;quality time,&quot; just <br/>
time.   I don&#39;t think so.  I know it&#39;s part of the rhetoric of child custody <br/>
battles, but even leaving kids out of it, my husband can be home all weekend <br/>
and we can do  nothing special, but we&#39;re friendly and comfortable, and <br/>
relaxed, and we smile at each other and touch as we pass by.  That&#39;s nice.  <br/>
But it&#39;s not the same, even, as us sitting and doing something together, or <br/>
even walking over to the credit union or video store together, cooking <br/>
together, telling stories--something that gives us more shared memories, that <br/>
builds our &quot;Sharing&quot; or more than just the physical address.<br/>
<br/>
The level and duration of attention we can give friends or kids or projects <br/>
isn&#39;t just &quot;quantity&quot; or &quot;quality&quot;--there are graduations and values.<br/>

throw in soccer again... Cacie has been trying to improve her drop-kicks.<br/>
She had been doing it one way, and it worked sorta well and sometimes<br/>
really well. Last week, one of her coaches showed her a different way to<br/>
hold the ball, so that it sort of fell onto her foot rather than being<br/>
kicked out of her hands. At first, it was really awkward. Her kicks were<br/>
lousy, and a lot of the time she missed the ball altogether. Clearly, she<br/>
was a &quot;worse kicker&quot; than she had been before she tried to integrate this<br/>
new technique. Plus, she said it &quot;felt wrong&quot;, it wasn&#39;t how she was used<br/>
to doing it, she was thinking so hard about how she dropped the ball that<br/>
she couldn&#39;t think about kicking it.<br/>
<br/>
As she kept practicing, however (and as I bit my tongue really hard to<br/>
keep from giving advice, because I knew she was near the end of her<br/>
frustration limit, and any time I give advice at that point it knocks her<br/>
over the edge), she would occasionally get off a really good kick,<br/>
farther than she&#39;d ever kicked before.  It was those moments that made<br/>
her stick with the process, that and seeing Coach Kyle kick the ball 3/4<br/>
of the way down the field... and she is a better kicker now that she&#39;s<br/>
integrated the technique he taught her.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, children are not soccer balls. Still, I think people often are<br/>
used to focusing their attention on one aspect of a process and ignoring<br/>
other aspects of that same process, and learning to focus on those other<br/>
aspects does feel awkward at first, we have to focus on the mechanics of<br/>
something we were doing automatically. I don&#39;t think, though, that<br/>
because it feels awkward and wrong necessarily means that it is wrong...<br/>
sometimes it means that it&#39;s new, and different.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of aspects of parenting that didn&#39;t come naturally to me.<br/>
I used to have a really hard time when Cacie would tell me about<br/>
something that was making her unhappy, or upset, because I always felt<br/>
like I had to &quot;fix it&quot;. That&#39;s an impossible role, and we were both<br/>
pretty frustrated for a while. Gradually, I started watching how a friend<br/>
responded to similar situations with her daughter, who was around Cacie&#39;s<br/>
age and similarly prone to intense emotions. I literally memorized some<br/>
of her lines and used them, stuff like &quot;I can see that you&#39;re really<br/>
upset about that&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m so sorry that happened to you&quot;. They were<br/>
true, first off, and they seemed to help, her daughter often responded by<br/>
talking more about it, and eventually seemed to feel better. At first I<br/>
felt really stilted and awkward saying this stuff, I really wanted to<br/>
solve it, come up with some things she could do or say... but I didn&#39;t,<br/>
and just listening and empathizing worked *much* better. Cacie responded<br/>
by talking about it more instead of screaming at me, and then she often<br/>
figured out her own solution. It was Really Cool, but it felt Really<br/>
Weird to start with. Later, I could sort of tap into my own mind and<br/>
instincts and think of things to say on my own, but in the beginning it<br/>
was very rehearsed. <br/>
<br/>
This may not have much to do with unschooling, but then again it may...<br/>

<br/>
I think it does.  <br/>
<br/>
When a family&#39;s going from &quot;Not until after dinner&quot; or &quot;clean your plate,&quot; to <br/>
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;  it has GOT to sound to them like they&#39;re in a sitcom at <br/>
first, I think.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Have all the candy you want&quot; a day or two after &quot;One piece of cake is enough <br/>
for one day&quot; might seem freakish.<br/>
<br/>
And the same with more academic stuff.  &quot;Do I have to write this by hand?&quot; <br/>
can be &quot;I&#39;ll write it for you,&quot; or &quot;No, use the computer,&quot; or &quot;just call <br/>
them&quot; or whatever, instead of &quot;If you can&#39;t write by hand you&#39;ll never be <br/>
able to get a job.  Just DO it, right NOW.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I say something like that my kids look at me and LAUGH right in my face.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I try it just to see what it feels like.  But it&#39;s not the real <br/>
feeling, it&#39;s just a joke.<br/>
<br/>
The other night Holly asked what if she didn&#39;t do something or other and I <br/>
said she&#39;d get a big spanking, or some such.  She didn&#39;t think for one <br/>
nano-second she was in danger of a big spanking.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t the point of unschooling freedom?  How can<br/>
&gt; &gt; you be free if you imprison yourself in doctrine?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You made a lot of good points Heather! :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But if you&#39;re certain that the posters here are saying the things you are <br/>
&gt;arguing against, I&#39;d suggest you need to read more carefully without that<br/>
&gt;assumption clouding your perception. Please ask people for clarification,<br/>
&gt;but not with the assumptions you&#39;ve made. Read also the message boards at <br/>
&gt;Unschooling.com to see how the posters express unschooling to newbies. <br/>
&gt;Perhaps that will make things clearer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure that many of my arguments have been brewing for 9 years or<br/>
so.  Most of the people I&#39;m arguing with are probably not even on<br/>
this list.  Quite a few of them are earlier versions of myself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You seem to be assuming that defining something creates doctrine. I suppose<br/>
&gt;if someone accepts that premise, then it becomes self-fulfilling!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love to define things.  I just haven&#39;t been able to come up with<br/>
a definition of unschooling that doesn&#39;t limit or mislead people.<br/>
A lot of the arguments I&#39;ve seen about unschooling have been because<br/>
terms like &quot;child-led learning&quot; have led people to believe that<br/>
we&#39;re asking children to recreate Western civilization from a pocket<br/>
knife and some parachute silk.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I&#39;ve encountered the Quaker idea that outward forms can<br/>
become empty pretty quickly.  Humans tend to focus on the outward<br/>
form instead of on the underlying essential reality that created<br/>
the form in the first place.  I&#39;m intrigued by this idea.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s certainly plenty of Eastern and Western thought that supports<br/>
the idea the pinning something down with words tends to destroy it.<br/>
Taoists and Zen Buddhists have something like this idea.  When we draw<br/>
a map, we sometimes forget that the map is not really the territory.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I can assure you that, being the highly anal retentive person I am, if I<br/>
&gt;believed unschooling could be defined by a nicely formatted 12 point <br/>
&gt;doctrine or some such, I would have come up with a list of must do&#39;s years <br/>
&gt;ago so I wouldn&#39;t have to spend 1000+ hours each year explaining unschooling <br/>
&gt;to people. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I share your frustration.  Perhaps that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to make<br/>
a virtue out of necessity.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Getting people to understand unschooling takes *lots* of words, *lots* of <br/>
&gt;examples, *lots* of patient understanding to help them get their thinking <br/>
&gt;from where it is to unschooling. We could list a bunch of &quot;truths&quot; to be <br/>
&gt;accepted, but it would mean nothing. Being able to say children will read <br/>
&gt;when they&#39;re ready isn&#39;t the same as understanding why that is so and why <br/>
&gt;the standard belief that chldren must be taught is *not* so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was so much more certain of these unschooling truths when I was<br/>
only unschooling one child.<br/>
<br/>
Most children, I agree, learn to read just fine on their own.  Some<br/>
children, however, do need extra help.  I can no more deny that extra<br/>
help to my child who needs it than I can deny my other children the<br/>
ability to fly on their own wings.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Perhaps you are naturally more evolved in the natural learning department <br/>
&gt;than most people who come to unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was very fortunate, actually.  When my eldest was a baby, I hooked up<br/>
with a woman who had worked with Magda Gerber (a chief proponent of<br/>
unschooling principles for young children).  I also live in an area<br/>
where people have been unschooling since 1970.  I had lots of local<br/>
mentors.<br/>
<br/>
By the time we started unschooling for real, it was just an extension<br/>
of what we&#39;d already been doing as parents.  The ideas of freedom<br/>
and respect were already in place, ready to be extended into academia.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was also a born unschooler.  Get out of her way, and she<br/>
is absolutely amazing.  She was really the one who convinced me that<br/>
unschooling was the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
My second child is different in many ways.  She&#39;s more of a social<br/>
learner.  She likes more adult-led activities and needs more hands-on<br/>
teaching.  So I&#39;ve had to learn to meet her needs, too.<br/>
<br/>
My third child is like my first.  He does best teaching himself.<br/>
The baby of the family seems to be more like #2.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Most people bring with them an <br/>
&gt;enormous amount of baggage. It can&#39;t be shed just by embracing the <br/>
&gt;unschooling philosphy. It can&#39;t even be shed by &quot;getting&quot; unschooling. It <br/>
&gt;can take years for people to let go of their baggage. (That baggage so <br/>
&gt;comforting!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it takes most of us a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the people I know who&#39;ve started unschooling take a year or<br/>
two to get going.  After that, it&#39;s fine-tuning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To shed that baggage, newbies do need something more clear than &quot;do what&#39;s<br/>
&gt;best&quot; or &quot;listen to your chldren&quot;. Though those describe unschooling to <br/>
&gt;unschoolers, they are inadequate to those who are still certain that some <br/>
&gt;things need to be done to raise decent human beings. People need a huge <br/>
&gt;amount of work to get to the point where they can understand that &quot;listen to <br/>
&gt;your children&quot; means more than what those words say.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you think that there is only one valid way to raise children?<br/>
<br/>
I think that people need to start where they are and take the next<br/>
step.  I&#39;m not sure that I know where they need to go.  I have a<br/>
hard enough time figuring out where *I* need to go.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You also seem to be assuming that defining unschooling limits it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not an assumption.  I&#39;ve seen people define unschooling in<br/>
ways that limit options.  I&#39;ve seen people (I&#39;ve even been one)<br/>
who try to take a definition of unschooling and use it in a<br/>
prescriptive way.  If something doesn&#39;t fit the definition, they<br/>
won&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
My unschooling mentors (who have been at it for 30 years and are<br/>
now helping their kids raise their own unschooling families)<br/>
didn&#39;t give me any rules.  They simply said, &quot;Maybe it would<br/>
work for you to try this.&quot;  They dropped little hints to me<br/>
when I was confused.  They trusted me to figure it out for<br/>
myself.  They also gave me a lot of appreciation for the path<br/>
I was taking.  They were very gentle and brought me to unschooling<br/>
by unschooling me.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that, if you don&#39;t at some point get the essence<br/>
of unschooling, all the words in the world won&#39;t make a difference.<br/>
The natural learning potential of human children is truly amazing.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine how a parent could watch that and not step<br/>
back, awed and humbled by how well it works.<br/>
<br/>
Get a hit of that, and everything else follows naturally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I see defining unschooling as giving people something to shoot for, a goal <br/>
&gt;to reach. Though I think if we all could grow up without the mental baggage <br/>
&gt;of what we&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to do, then we would all be able to listen to our <br/>
&gt;children and give them what they need rather than what we parents think they <br/>
&gt;need. In that case doing what&#39;s best for your family would look the same as <br/>
&gt;unschooling (without the initial struggle to get it!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know.  To some extent, I can see what you&#39;re saying (although<br/>
I think examples are probably better than definitions).  I think, though,<br/>
that I&#39;d rather see unschooling unfold naturally in people&#39;s lives,<br/>
even if it takes longer, than emerge from a struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m not sure that &quot;unschooling&quot; ought to be a goal in and of<br/>
itself.  It&#39;s just a vehicle, and it&#39;s not for everyone.<br/>

I wish I couldn&#39;t.  I wish I hadn&#39;t seen so much really harmful parenting, <br/>
justified by tradition and religion, by parents who were not thinking, who <br/>
considered children brats, sneaky, &quot;other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, I&#39;m not sure that &quot;unschooling&quot; ought to be a goal in and of<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes parents are panicking and they NEED a vehicle to get them out of <br/>
the road, out of the wasteland, out of the swamp.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not for everyone.  Those whose kids are vacant-eyed or unimaginative or <br/>
cynical (especially if they learned it from their parents&#39; shushing them, <br/>
telling them their ideas are dumb or unimportant, etc.) aren&#39;t prime <br/>
candidates.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly called, crying, for me to come get her from a sleepover.  Although she <br/>
met these kids at a homeschooling meeting, they cannot homeschool, and would <br/>
never be able to unschool, because things are boring and stupid at their <br/>
house.  They promised swimming that didn&#39;t happen.  They promised food, and <br/>
that was forgotten.  The kids insulted and fought and her hostess went to <br/>
sleep.  She called home, and has since then rented movies and a Nintendo <br/>
game, eaten a quesadilla made just for her, helped her dad make a fire, and <br/>
is watching Saturday Night Live with him.  That replaced fighting over making <br/>
a fort with chairs and a blanket.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling.<br/>
<br/>
But people who Do want to know about unschooling come to unschooling.com, and <br/>
they don&#39;t want people there to say &quot;there&#39;s no real definition, we can&#39;t <br/>

I think that real change comes gradually, with a lot of thought and <br/>
experimentation.  I think that adults as well as children need to <br/>
find their own ways.  The sooner people start standing on their own <br/>
feet and thinking things through for themselves, the sooner they&#39;ll <br/>
find solutions that work for them.<br/>
<br/>
When we think things through for ourselves, we really own the <br/>
knowledge that we eventually get.  It&#39;s ours in a way that no <br/>
secondhand knowledge can ever be.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is good enough for kids, it ought to work pretty well <br/>
for adults, too.<br/>

poorly at parenting is because they do not follow<br/>
their instincts.  It can be very confusing for parents<br/>
when there are thousands of &#39;experts&#39; telling them<br/>
this way is best, and all the &#39;experts&#39; have a<br/>
different way.  Parents, often out of fear they will<br/>
not be good parents and lack of confidence, put their<br/>
trust in this &#39;experts&#39; and end up thoroughly confused<br/>
and less confident than ever.  It is hard to overcome<br/>
that fear and a lot of  people are taught that<br/>
instincts are bad and should not be followed.  Every<br/>
mother I have known has the instinct to go and pick up<br/>
their baby when the baby is crying.  It is natural. <br/>
Yet, many do not do it because they have been told it<br/>
is wrong, it will &quot;spoil the child&quot;....they begin to<br/>
believe their instincts will be damaging in some way<br/>
to their child.  So, they follow some rule to make<br/>

&gt;Heather - you sound like you&#39;re arguing something, but I can&#39;t get a <br/>
&gt;grip on what the other side is. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s quite possible I&#39;m not arguing at all.  I might be clarifying<br/>
something, expanding on something, or writing about things I&#39;ve been <br/>
thinking about.<br/>
<br/>
I have been musing about the possibility of deliberately keeping<br/>
unschooling undefined.  Most of the impetus for that comes from:<br/>
<br/>
         * Not having been able to come up with a good definition in<br/>
           9 years.  A bad definition seems to me worse than no<br/>
           definition at all.<br/>
         * Seeing how much power certain undefined concepts continue<br/>
           to have for centuries after people refuse to define them.<br/>
         * Seeing posts on this list claim that X, Y, or Z wasn&#39;t <br/>
           unschooling.  This seems like a pointless exercise to me,<br/>
           one that distracts from the more important issue of what<br/>
           is best for the children.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that Sandra and I have been discussing whether unschooling<br/>
needs a definition or not.  I believe that Sandra&#39;s position is that<br/>
there are many benefits to a definition.  My current position is that<br/>
it might be a good idea to keep unschooling as undefined as Holt kept<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
We have also touched on whether parents can think for themselves and <br/>
whether parental instincts, listening, and so forth are good enough <br/>
guides for parental action.  Do parents really need an external <br/>
philosophy or can they drive their own lives?  Will they, if given<br/>
gentle encouragement, come to the truth on their own, or must someone<br/>
else give it to them piecemeal?<br/>
<br/>
It is my impression that I have a far more positive view of the<br/>
capacities of parents than Sandra, Joyce, and others on this list.  <br/>
I have felt cast in the role of Pollyanna, although it is fairly <br/>
common in my experience for people to come to unschooling gently <br/>
and gradually.<br/>
<br/>
I think that sketches the area of the discussion.  I&#39;d prefer to<br/>
think of it as an exploration of the territory rather than an <br/>
argument.  There&#39;s been a lot of food for thought on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe I missed it, but I&#39;ve never seen unschoolers do anything but <br/>
&gt;do what you&#39;re saying they should do - encourage people to <br/>

&gt;think about their OWN kids and their OWN family&#39;s lifestyle and <br/>
&gt;environment and put things together in their OWN way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that this is one of the problems with discussing things<br/>
in the abstract.  It sounded to me like Sandra and Joyce were<br/>
talking about being very directive with new parents.  I got the<br/>
impression that Sandra thought that most people can&#39;t think for<br/>
themselves and so need expert advice in order to make changes in<br/>
their lives.<br/>
<br/>
It is quite possible that I have simply not seen enough of<br/>
Sandra&#39;s views to put them in context.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve heard people saying, &quot;You might want to argue less and listen more to <br/>

&gt;me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I heard had a different emotional tone, close to &quot;You young things<br/>
ought to listen to your elders and betters.&quot;  This struck me, and<br/>
strikes me, as patronizing, and probably infuriating to the young<br/>
things who are being spoken to.<br/>
<br/>
It is quite possible that I mis-heard what was being said.  It&#39;s<br/>
easy to misinterpret online posts, but I have caught hints of the<br/>
same attitude in subsequent posts.  Again, it&#39;s possible that my<br/>
view was colored by the first post I saw to this list, so I&#39;m trying <br/>
to suspend judgement until I have more information.<br/>

Suspending judgment is usually a quieter matter than a long post falsely <br/>

<br/>
My request to the large batch of new members to this group, a number of whom <br/>
were self-admittedly new to unschooling, or self-admittedly parents of <br/>
toddlers, was that they suspend judgment--that they wait to see what was <br/>
going on and to see who knew what before they jumped on us as a group and on <br/>
our beliefs.  I didn&#39;t get my way.   The point was hammered paper thin, along <br/>
with the patience of several of the regulars.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are many people who have made the same argument over the many (7+?)<br/>
years I&#39;ve been on line. There are many people who would agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
But, before you bring the argument here, a little history of *this* list<br/>
would probably be helpful. Sandra started this list recently and the people<br/>
who initially followed her here are many of the ones who *liked* and<br/>
*benefited* from Sandra&#39;s and other&#39;s more direct approach to getting<br/>
unschooling and came for more of the same. So an argument that pointing out<br/>
&quot;that&#39;s not unschooling&quot; isn&#39;t the best approach won&#39;t fly *here* because a<br/>
whole slew of living examples who *did* benefit from it are right here. It<br/>
would sort of be like wandering into a vegan list and suggesting the people<br/>
might want to be a little less hard line and loosen up where food is<br/>
concerned if they want more people to get vegetarianism.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably people here who came from Yahoo or heard about it on<br/>
Unschooling.com (or someplace else?) who don&#39;t necessarily like hard<br/>
questioning or debate or having what they do held up to public examiniation.<br/>
They will probably be uncomfortable here. Maybe some who thought they didn&#39;t<br/>
like debate will realize they do. Maybe some will see it as fighting and<br/>
leave.<br/>
<br/>
There is something unique offered here and it isn&#39;t to everyone&#39;s liking.<br/>
But to make it to more people&#39;s liking would take away what the people who<br/>
initially came here hoped to find. There are gentler ways to present<br/>
unschooling. There are people who will benefit from it. There are people who<br/>
will slowly get unschooling that way, and some who will stop part way when<br/>
they reach their comfort zone. But that will leave out the people who do<br/>
like a more direct approach. But they can come here because that&#39;s what&#39;s<br/>
done here. :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are some parents, really nice people who love their children<br/>
fiercely, who think spanking is best for children, who think grounding<br/>
and restricting and punishment is best for children.  There are those who<br/>
think dealing with bully&#39;s at school is best for children, so they can<br/>
learn how to live in the real world.   There are more extreme examples,<br/>
too.  <br/>
Sometimes people who come to unschooling think they have it.  They think<br/>
they get it.  When their child shows an interest in insects, they run<br/>
right out and buy that unit study.  They let their kid play all day<br/>
except for those two hours he has to sit down with the math text book. <br/>
That is not unschooling, and if a person wants to understand I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s helpful to let them go on thinking it is.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t know how to define unschooling so clearly and precisely that<br/>
everyone would have real understanding.  But it only seems reasonable to<br/>
try to make it clearer for those who are trying to understand.  <br/>
I always get in trouble with analogy&#39;s but I&#39;m going to try one here.  If<br/>
I wanted to make a cake, and had never baked or cooked before,  a cake<br/>
recipe that just said - do what ever seems best to you, use your<br/>
imagination -  probably wouldn&#39;t be that helpful.  If my friend, who<br/>
always had lovely cakes ( devil&#39;s food? )  had given me this recipe,  I<br/>
would have to assume cake just didn&#39;t work for my family.<br/>
It would have been much more helpful to have an ingredients list and a<br/>
plan for putting them together.  <br/>
Ok, kids are not cakes, and maybe there&#39;s no ingredients list for<br/>
unschooling, but I would hope, before I pour a bottle of vinegar in my<br/>
batter, someone who knows about cakes would stop me.  I would hope,<br/>
before I add a text book or take away TV,  someone who knows about<br/>
unschooling would stop me.  <br/>

and make choices that are really bad for their kids.   There is a whole<br/>
population of parents out there who think playground bully&#39;s are just a<br/>
natural part of growing up.  They think having a terrible year or two or<br/>
ten at school is just the way life is.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so.  I think Sandra understands that unschooling is such a<br/>
huge change in thinking,  such a giant step, that people often need<br/>
guidance.  It&#39;s easy to get lost when your going someplace you&#39;ve never<br/>
been before.  Having a guide, or even a map might mean the difference<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had some church guy here crying about how terrible Harry Potter books<br/>
are, who openly admitted he&#39;d never read them.   Asking new unschoolers<br/>
to gain a little more understanding before jumping to conclusions doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem unreasonable.  That&#39;s all that was.  No one here would deliberately<br/>
discount someone&#39;s wisdom simply because they are young.  Most of us wish<br/>
we&#39;d gotten the whole thing much sooner ourselves.  It&#39;s inspiring to see<br/>
young parents who seem to have a really natural understanding of this<br/>
concept.  But someone, young or old, who believes they have an<br/>
understanding of unschooling, and still wants to place restrictions on<br/>
their children, really may have things to learn yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Your post was really beautiful.  It really spoke to me.  My own<br/>
understanding of unschooling came naturally, gradually, thankfully before<br/>
my son ever went to school or had a taste of text books.  I&#39;m still<br/>
gaining understanding.  But I&#39;ve seen that it&#39;s not always a natural<br/>
thing with some parents, and for them and for myself, I&#39;m really glad for<br/>
the wisdom of people like Sandra. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She probably got that idea from people like me.<br/>
<br/>
Some people *are* able to decide how to raise their kids, how to<br/>
school/homeschool/unschool them, etc.  On the other hand, some of us were so<br/>
well-schooled we don&#39;t believe we are allowed to make those decisions; our<br/>
wiser elders have already done that, and we are failing our children and our<br/>
society if we step out of line.  We are bad if we don&#39;t do as we&#39;re told.<br/>
<br/>
Not every person was shamed into behaving, but a lot of us were.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you are one of the lucky ones.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to have children *after* reading Susan Schaeffer Macaulay&#39;s &quot;For<br/>
the Children&#39;s Sake.&quot;  She was Francis Schaeffer&#39;s daughter, and I&#39;d already<br/>
read most of his and his wife&#39;s books, so she had credibility with me, based<br/>
on that.   She writes about the Charlotte Mason method and her own<br/>
experiences as a homeschooled kid, although her parents used Calvert School.<br/>
My own fear of school was so great, I didn&#39;t have the nerve to even consider<br/>
parenthood until I learned that it was possible to never send your child to<br/>
school, and therefore, I would never have to talk to a principal or teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Once my daughter was 6, I had to &quot;start schooling,&quot; since that was the age<br/>
of enrollment in CA.  I didn&#39;t feel prepared to &quot;do Charlotte Mason,&quot; so I<br/>
chose the other curriculum Schaeffer mentioned, Calvert School.  They<br/>
advertised in National Geographic, so that meant they had to be good, right?<br/>
And I dove into Calvert, did every page every day, and my dd got gold seals<br/>
indicating 100% correct on her tests, which, of course, we sent in to the<br/>
expert teacher to grade.  I had to write evaluations of her reading, and<br/>
made sure she sounded good, because I was so afraid I might be viewed as a<br/>
failure and bad.<br/>
<br/>
First grade went great (except for that one day when I locked dd in the<br/>
schoolroom until she completed her language worksheet -- I *knew* she could<br/>
*do it* if only she *would*), so we ordered second grade.  It arrived about<br/>
3 weeks after we completed first, and dd wanted to jump right in.  And I<br/>
dutifully read page one of the big teacher&#39;s manual and insisted we do<br/>
lesson one.  The problem was, we hadn&#39;t taken three months off to forget<br/>
most of first grade, but the books assumed we had.  The math book started<br/>
with matching number stickers to pictures.  Dd had been doing 3-digit<br/>
subtraction, and could have started half-way through the book.<br/>
<br/>
But no, the manual said lesson one, and by golly, we were going to DO lesson<br/>
one.  I would be bad if we didn&#39;t.  We battled through 40 boring lessons,<br/>
and I realized dd would NOT get a perfect gold seal on her first test!!!  I<br/>
would be bad if she didn&#39;t.  So...<br/>
<br/>
... Dad stepped in.  He&#39;d found a new plaything called AOL, and, feeling<br/>
guilty because he&#39;s the only one playing with it, tries a keyword<br/>
&quot;homeschooling.&quot;  He shows it to me, shows me how to download folder<br/>
messages by flashsession so we won&#39;t break the budget, and I start exploring<br/>
message boards.  First, I find one for Calvert School users, and am told I<br/>
don&#39;t really have to use the teacher service, and it&#39;s ok to use a different<br/>
handwriting program (I hated Calvert Script), and it&#39;s ok to skip lessons<br/>
and even to do the whole geography book in one day like dd wanted, rather<br/>
than making it the reward once a week as the teacher&#39;s manual suggested.<br/>
<br/>
That alone was mindblowing.  I could use the material in a way other than as<br/>
instructed by the experts?  I could change something to suit -- myself??<br/>
<br/>
Then I started looking at some of the other folders.  I made friends with a<br/>
Charlotte Mason user (one expert enough to be a seminar speaker!), and<br/>
learned it was OK to relax, to adapt materials as I saw fit.  I wrote snail<br/>
mail letters to other homeschoolers of my newly adopted religion, asking if<br/>
it was OK to be more relaxed, if Charlotte Mason was suitable.  One warned<br/>
against anything too radical, but assured me CM was acceptable.  (One<br/>
education writer of my religion stated flat out that no parent should try to<br/>
teach their own kid, but by the time I read his book, I had enough balls to<br/>
say &quot;screw it, what does he know?&quot; -- but that was later &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
And then, I looked at another folder, this one titled &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Whoa,<br/>
nelly, what a bunch of weirdoes!  Nevertheless, I find interesting posts,<br/>
and also find it&#39;s the funniest folder.  I went to a chat and found many of<br/>
the unschooling posters there; I wrote down the names on a piece of paper so<br/>
I could look for their messages.  I cracked a joke and got my first ROFL,<br/>
and I was hooked.  I liked these people.  I felt OK talking to them.  I<br/>
could ask questions and not be told I was wrong, but that maybe there was<br/>
more out there.  Someone said &quot;relax,&quot; and someone else said &quot;trust your<br/>
children,&quot; and someone made the suggestion I take a vacation from any kind<br/>
of &quot;schooling,&quot; just to see what might happen.<br/>
<br/>
I took that suggestion, using Advent/Christmas/Epiphany as the timeframe and<br/>
the justification -- a total of over two months &lt;g&gt;  Once Epiphany was past,<br/>
my dd wanted to know when we would &quot;start school&quot; again.  I didn&#39;t give a<br/>
real answer &lt;g&gt;  While we didn&#39;t dive into unschooling right then, we never<br/>
did another Calvert lesson.  We did some of the sweet ideas of Charlotte<br/>
Mason, like nature drawing and journals, and a little narration, but nothing<br/>
forced.  This was my time of learning, my time of reading that guy all the<br/>
unschoolers talked about, John Holt (&quot;How Children Failed&quot; had me in tears),<br/>
and it was my time to heal.<br/>
<br/>
It was my son, though, who made me an unschooler.  I prepared to teach him<br/>
to read, using Charlotte Mason suggestions, and then discovered he already<br/>
*could* read.  He had no patience for sounding out, shooting down the<br/>
Everyone Needs Phonics dogma.  At Christmas, dd, who loved them, asked for<br/>
math workbooks :-)  Being a fair-minded parent, I bought a kindergarten<br/>
level book for ds.  The day after Christmas, the two of them spent a couple<br/>
of hours doing those workbooks.  At one point, ds got stuck and asked for<br/>
help.  He was doing subtraction, and tried to explain to me what the problem<br/>
was; whatever it was he was doing made no sense at all to me.  I fell back<br/>
on the Calvert School teaching technique -- get out 9 beans, take away 5,<br/>
count what&#39;s left, simple, right?  My 5 y.o. son gets this look on his face,<br/>
balls up his fists, and says in a growl, &quot;Don&#39;t ever try to teach me<br/>
anything again, mom!  You make it too confusing!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was my turning point.  I have never since &quot;taught&quot; him anything.  If he<br/>
asks for help, I ask if he&#39;s sure he wants it &lt;g&gt;  I learned to respect his<br/>
brain, his learning &quot;style,&quot; and to not take it personally if he rejects my<br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve called myself an unschooler for 6 of the 8 years I&#39;ve been<br/>
homeschooling.  I was not an attachment parent, never heard of La Leche<br/>
League until long after my babies weaned, never read Mothering or Growing<br/>
Without Schooling, still vote Republican...<br/>
<br/>
OK, so I have a ways to go re. thinking for myself!! &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The point of this long-winded story is that there really are people who want<br/>
-- no, NEED -- someone to tell them what to do.  In some ways, I&#39;ve spent my<br/>
life hopping from one teacher to another, looking for that A, looking for<br/>
approval.  When one &quot;school&quot; becomes boring or too hard or seems to not fit<br/>
me anymore, I look for a new one.  I do it with religions and relationships<br/>
and philosophies.  What happened when I found the unschoolers on AOL was<br/>
unsettling for me -- these people wouldn&#39;t tell me what to do, exactly, but<br/>
encouraged me to trust myself.  No one ever suggested that before.<br/>
<br/>
If I had read Holt&#39;s &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; first, instead of &quot;For the Children&#39;s<br/>
Sake&quot;, I probably would never have homeschooled; I wasn&#39;t ready to hear<br/>
anything that radical.  When people -- newbies -- seek out unschooling.com,<br/>
they probably have *some* idea of what unschooling is.  I had to work my way<br/>
up to it on AOL, shedding coercive certainties little by little.  I needed<br/>
someone to say &quot;it&#39;s OK to not do school every day,&quot; &quot;it&#39;s OK to use a<br/>
different handwriting program -- have you seen Portland Italic?&quot;<br/>
Eventually, I didn&#39;t need anyone to say &quot;it&#39;s OK to spend the day curled up<br/>
in bed reading The Indian in the Cupboard aloud, straight through, and not<br/>
do any worksheets about it&quot;!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like being able to ask someone what they are doing and what their experiences have been.  I like being able to question them, understand their perspective and not feel like I have to walk on eggshells doing it.  I may not be an original thinker but I certainly think for myself.  I analyze, analyze and analyze, if it doesn&#39;t make sense, I ask some more questions.  So far the radical unschoolers have been the only ones that truly make sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
I would say the only thing that is still a little shaky in my mind is math.  I&#39;m hoping my MIL doesn&#39;t ask me if we are still doing our math workbooks.  I know I&#39;m going to have trouble explaining why we are not.  12 yo dd plans on taking engineering of some kind in college.  I don&#39;t know how she will get the math she needs for this program if she doesn&#39;t feel like hitting the math workbooks.  I&#39;m trusting that when she gets older if she still wants to get into an engineering program, she will do what it takes.  She asked me today if there were any games she could play that would give her more math.  Anybody have any games for algebra.  I love figuring stuff like that out.  I&#39;m working through her math books because I enjoy it.  Maybe my dd and I will go to college together.<br/>

We have almost all the Edmark math CD-ROMS, including Astro Algebra. It was <br/>
too hard for us when we first looked at it, but it seemed pretty cool.<br/>

It&#39;s a joke. There are probably more liberal and/or Democratic unschoolers<br/>
than conservative and/or Republican ones. My husband is a conservative<br/>
Republican, I&#39;m a Libertarian, like to think of myself as moderate, and<br/>
often vote Republican.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no official unschooling credo or Republican mandate that says you<br/>
can&#39;t be a Republican and unschool.<br/>
