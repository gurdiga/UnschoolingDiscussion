<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310147006">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending this again because I didn&#39;t see it come through on the list - apologies if<br/>
anyone has seen in twice.  I&#39;m still after those digests 1-28, if anyone can forward them<br/>
to me!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Mandy from NZ<br/>

Mandy, the list archives are on a website, hosted by onelist.<br/>
<br/>
Go to www.onelist.com and enter your name and passwod. Then click on the <br/>
member center icon.  From there click the list name and you should find the <br/>
archives there.<br/>
