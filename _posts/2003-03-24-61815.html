&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was at Bread and Circus today, buying meat when they gave me a card on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the Organic Restoration Act.  It seems that some of our government<br/>
representatives decided at the last minute to add a rider to the<br/>
Appropriation Bill that would allow livestock growers (Poultry, Beef -- This<br/>
means DAIRY too, Pork ....) to feed their animals &#39;conventional&#39; feed and<br/>
still label and sell it as organic.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Now as you know, it would be much cheaper to feed your livestock<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&#39;conventional&#39; feed and sell it for top dollar as organic.  This cannot be<br/>
allowed to happen.<br/>

&gt; Write your Senator and Representative and make them repeal this bad piece<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of legislation.  They make writing easy with links from thier site right to<br/>
the Senate and House.<br/>
