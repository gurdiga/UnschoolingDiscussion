<br/>
I was born in Georgia (a fluke; my parents were living in South Carolina <br/>
where my dad was on a temp job, building a nuclear something in Aiken).<br/>
<br/>
We moved to New Mexico the summer I turned seven, but visited the <br/>
grandparents at least once a year, in Fort Worth and Rotan.  All are gone <br/>
now, and my obligation to visit Texas has ceased, but I&#39;ll be there next <br/>
Labor Day, at an experimental sort of conference--the successor of the <br/>
MindFull conferences.  It&#39;s still MindFull but is being organized differently <br/>
for this next time.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401828425">*LOL* Sandra, I grew up near the Savannah River Plant (the nuclear thing<br/>
in Aiken). Hmmm, that may explain some things about me...<br/>

the MindFull conference - never got to - and was bummed when they quit <br/>
doing it. You mean it&#39;s back again? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kind of. <br/>
There&#39;s no fee, and no speakers are being comped or paid.<br/>
The requirement to attend is to commit to spend two nights in the hotel. The <br/>
hotel is providing conference rooms in exchange for the commitment of rooms, <br/>
and a discount (still not cheap) rate for a Saturday banquet-style dinner.  <br/>
The rooms are  $80 a night or so and you can pack in (they&#39;re not charging <br/>
more per person).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m taking my kids and two extras.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be working by word of mouth.  Those who would like to be added to <br/>
the mailing list should write to me on the side and I&#39;ll forward the names.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what/how they intend to get the word out from this point.  After <br/>
they had fifty families commit (invited from former conference attendees), <br/>
they committed to a date.  <br/>
<br/>
Labor Day, September 2002, Fort Worth <br/>
(This is an experimental co-operative MindFull conference.) <br/>
<br/>
(It&#39;s at a new hotel in Fort Worth, just opened lately and so it will be one <br/>
year old next fall!)<br/>
