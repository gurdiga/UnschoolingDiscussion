I&#39;ve got  a guidebook for National Civil War Parks, and we are looking at <br/>
sites in  Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania -- all the <br/>
major  battle sites, plus Appomatox Courthouse and Washington DC.  We&#39;ll also <br/>
be  travelling the Natchez Trace from southern Mississippi to southern <br/>
Tennessee  and taking a look at some non-Civil War sites there, as  well.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m only a few weeks behind. Still catching up. Sorry!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Question first:  Have you been to any CW sites that  were particularly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>riveting that we just shouldn&#39;t  miss?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gettysburg is a DON&#39;T MISS, of course. Very touristy, but informative. Be  <br/>
sure to get one of the guides that will drive your car through the battlefields  <br/>
and explain what happened when, why, and how. Really great. The Lincoln <br/>
Diner&#39;s  a great place to eat. Downtown.<br/>
 <br/>
We were fascinated with the battle of Petersburg near Richmond. It&#39;s hard  to <br/>
believe what actually happened there with the miners and all. Really great,  <br/>
and you can look into the pit and see how big it was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third: Any great places to eat or stay?  We&#39;re  looking at a tight <br/>
 </span></blockquote>budget, but can splurge once in  awhile.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Elissa&#39;s nearby! &lt;g&gt; But the KAO campgrounds are pretty good around  there. <br/>
Cabin&#39;s are cheap. I mentioned the Lincoln Diner in Gettysburg. Boys  loved <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fourth:  Good scenic routes?  In  particular, can anyone tell me if <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interstate 81 through western Virginia is  good?  I&#39;d love to be able to get off <br/>
the interstates altogether and take  back roads, but we just won&#39;t have the <br/>
time.  The map looks like 81 goes  right through the long middle of the W. <br/>
Virginia mountains on the west and the  Blue Ridge on the East.  Is it nice there, <br/>
or have they managed to make  that interstate as boring as so many others?  We <br/>
will, however, be able  to take back roads for select periods.  Any  <br/>
favorites?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 I like I-81, but the Blue Ridge Parkway is runs righ along-side it a  good <br/>
ways. There&#39;s a B&B  we stay at a lot in Floyd County (Ambrosia  Inn---Caroline <br/>
& Craig are the innkeepers); we&#39;re regulars! &lt;g&gt; Google  them, you won&#39;t be <br/>
disappointed. They have a 9-10 year old son, Ian, who is  darling. We&#39;ve <br/>
discussed unschooling at length: they&#39;re *almost* ready to  take the plunge. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
On I-81 there are also the caves to explore----a sign almost every  mile or <br/>
so. The closer you get to PA (through West Virginia and Maryland),  there&#39;s <br/>
something to see or do.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck! And have a great time!<br/>
