 </span></blockquote>How exciting, I love the she is so much fun!! Kids are fun, I will miss mine <br/>
when they are all grown.<br/>
<br/>
The no fear thing struck a cord, I have been criticized because our kids have <br/>
no fear of us. It&#39;s often thought of as a fault, that&#39;s too bad. I can see <br/>
that DH and I have been living the un-something lifestyle long before we got the <br/>
unschooling part right, LOL. I can&#39;t remember that last time I cared what <br/>
anyone ate and DH got over it pretty quick too. I cook when I feel like it, there <br/>
is always food here, we eat out now and then but people here can eat what <br/>
they would like and when they would like. <br/>
<br/>
I am sure it was a bit different here when I had very young kids but that has <br/>
been a while and food has not been an issue here for a while. (Well, except <br/>
the other day when the 16yro locked the 20yro out for eating the leftover <br/>
pizza, LOL. )<br/>
<br/>
We did go through a period of dad complaining that no one goes to bed here <br/>
but that has worked out too. Sometimes we stay up late but usually we all are in <br/>
bed by midnight. Sometimes the 12yro watches his own TV later and the 16yro <br/>
may be on the computer later but as long as dad can sleep it&#39;s ok.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone helps out...usually. The 16yro likes to barter, I will sweep and mop <br/>
if you will drive me to ...... or for some extra cash as we don&#39;t give <br/>
allowances but we will give them money if they need it. It&#39;s not been an issue so <br/>
far. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been interesting reading, I had never thought about how we live, I can <br/>
see we&#39;re pretty relaxed and yet we are very involved. We drive more than any <br/>
of the kids schooled friends parents. Just observations.<br/>
