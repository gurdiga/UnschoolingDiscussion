Since I live in Memphis, I have to try it every where.  <br/>

Sikes. Hammy&#39;s. Dukes (but it&#39;s not very good). Plenty of options!<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;re driving through NC, I&#39;d recommend some NC Q---vinegar-based and <br/>
delicious!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll point you in the right direction.<br/>
