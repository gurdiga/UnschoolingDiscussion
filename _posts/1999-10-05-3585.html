<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675788458">&lt;i am a child of a retired la leche league leader (dr.<br/>
sears, nursing on demand, loving guidance discipline, etc) and have happily<br/>
raised my babies the same way.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dear Erin-<br/>
How wonderful!  I&#39;m curious?--are you involved with LLL now as a mother?<br/>
<br/>
It is so comforting to hear your words as I&#39;m a Leader and am raising my five children the same way you were raised.  Attachment parenting does work!<br/>
<br/>
I know there has been a significant number of moms with &quot;failure to thrive&quot; babies as the result of their following the Ezzo&#39;s program.  Scary.<br/>
<br/>
Why are parents so afraid of meeting the needs of their babies/children?  It puzzles me.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Suzy</div>

&gt; Tracy,<br/>
&gt; sounds like you are saying the converse of this then...<br/>
&gt; other times you are not glad to be a non-Christian?<br/>
&gt; God loves you!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>God might, but I&#39;m not sure what I think of Him!  Most times I just don&#39;t<br/>
think about it, it might be nice to place my life totally in some other&#39;s<br/>
hands, but I prefer to keep that responsibility for myself.<br/>
