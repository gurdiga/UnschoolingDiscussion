<div id="ygrps-yiv-695831047">My daughter (age 9) has been taking violin lessons for a little more <br/>
than a year.  When she chose the instrument, she committed to regular <br/>
practices. She plays beautifly.<br/>
<br/>
 Lately, I have to &quot;remind&quot; her to practice, and of her commitment, <br/>
and it&#39;s becoming a real pain!  I&#39;ve told her that it is her choice <br/>
to continue with the instrument or not, but if she&#39;s going to <br/>
continue, practice is part of the package deal.  I&#39;m paying for <br/>
weekly lessons, it doesn&#39;t make sense to do that if she&#39;s not willing <br/>
to put in the practice time.  I think she&#39;s just bored with it right <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
She mentions she wants to now play flute, but we shelled out big <br/>
bucks for the violin.  (Her best friend just changed from playing <br/>
piano to violin)  I am not willing to keep buying (or renting) <br/>
instruments because she&#39;s changing her mind like the weather.  <br/>
<br/>
What advice can you all give me?  I hope she continues with it, she <br/>
has a real gift, but I don&#39;t want to force it.  We&#39;re unschooling!  I <br/>
don&#39;t force ANYTHING, I require NOTHING.  We switched to unschooling <br/>
about 9 months ago, and love it.  When we did that, I gave her the <br/>
choice about the violin, and she was definately interested, and <br/>
committed to practice.  I had considered stopping paying for lessons <br/>
until she gets interested again, but she&#39;ll lose so much if she lets <br/>
it slide for a year or more.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had children that pursued musical instruments while <br/>
unschooling?  How did you handle it?  Thanks!</div>

<br/>
Have you tried a problem-solving session?  Outlining all the issues -<br/>
what each of you really want from the violin, then together<br/>
brainstorming ideas to meet both of your needs?  Just to start while<br/>
weekly lessons are typical, surely they are not the only way to learn to<br/>
play an instrument?  One can spend a lot of time trying things out for<br/>
oneself, one can watch videos, one can take monthly lessons, or perhaps<br/>
a lesson could be booked when your daughter is ready to learn something<br/>
new?   <br/>
<br/>
I imagine it was a child-size violin?  If so, I imagine she will grow<br/>
out of it in a few years.  In the meantime she may pick it up a few<br/>
times - she may or may not pursue it more avidly.  It is a fact that<br/>
throughout our lives we occasionally wish we had back the money we spent<br/>
(on getting to a dud of an event, on wedding dresses, or washed out<br/>
holidays) - perhaps the violin may be one of those, but there is no way<br/>
to be sure yet.  When the violin is eventually grown out of, if you have<br/>
no younger children to give it a go, perhaps it might be sold on to<br/>
another child who wants to try the violin.<br/>

<br/>
Joshua and I took a few violin lessons - his stopped when he lost<br/>
interest, mine when the weekly budget required that money for other<br/>
things.  We hadn&#39;t been able to afford to buy violins and had been<br/>
hiring them, so now I can&#39;t even pick up a violin and give it a go by<br/>
myself.  Perhaps it would have been a good idea to layby a violin for<br/>
myself and forget about the lessons.  <br/>
<br/>
I also wish we had a piano in the house so I could play it occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t easy choosing how to help our kids with their interests -<br/>
wanting to try something out can become in a hopeful parent&#39;s eyes the<br/>
start of a brilliant career!  It happened that way for me.  And then<br/>
there is my frugal side which says - if they aren&#39;t serious about it<br/>
then it isn&#39;t worth the money.  Darcy wanted to get taps for his shoes -<br/>
I started imagining tap dancing lessons.  We have found some tie on taps<br/>
and if he asks for actual tap shoes or lessons *then* we shall work out<br/>
how to do them.  Of course I fear what if I don&#39;t offer what they need,<br/>
what if I don&#39;t spot the latent life-shaping spark that needs to be<br/>
blown to develop into a flame for my son?  Can anyone answer that for<br/>
me?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had four kids in music lessons.  I always had to remind them to <br/>
practice.  My son became tired of practicing the guitar and would <br/>
prefer just having a guitar around to pick up at his leisure.  My <br/>
oldest daughter tried a few different instruments and regrets giving <br/>
up the violin. Actually I took her out because I got tired of telling <br/>
her to get ready for her lessons as she sat on the couch or whatever <br/>
and wouldn&#39;t get her act together, so I removed the frustration from <br/>
my life and took her out.  Like I said before, she now regrets it and <br/>
would like to start up again.  My other daughter had to be reminded <br/>
and told to practice the piano when she first started, but now she is <br/>
in her seventh year of piano and really enjoys playing. She is past <br/>
the struggling part, so that makes it much more fun to play. It is <br/>
like having a private concert each day!!! My youngest daughter who <br/>
will be ten soon started piano and can&#39;t stand practicing the first <br/>
two days after lessons because it is hard for her.  I know she really <br/>
wants to play, so I told her she had to practice, or I wasn&#39;t going <br/>
to continue lessons.  It wasn&#39;t fair to expect us to pay for lessons <br/>
and to take the time and energy on my part to drive her there if she <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to do her part.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sympathize with you. My oldest daughter tried the flute, piano and <br/>
violin, each reaquiring a rental with the gear that came along with <br/>
it. At least we owned the piano!  Maybe she could save some $$ from <br/>
birthdays or doing small jobs and pay a percentage.  This way she has <br/>
a vested interest in the matter. <br/>

for a month!  I love different things, but would not want to do them <br/>
year round.   You get the picture.  To do something I like 24/7, <br/>
YIKES!!  <br/>

<br/>
My kids took piano lessons for a year. They were both into it for awhile and <br/>
learned lots of cool stuff about musical notation, harmonies, finger <br/>
placement, composers, etc. When they started balking at practicing, we <br/>
talked. They dropped it with the option to return at any time. No lesson is <br/>
wasted if they child wanted it and got something out of it. IMHO<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son took lessons from a very nice high school girl for two years.  She<br/>
was not strict or bossy and he really loved her.  When she went to<br/>
college he still liked piano and we tried a different teacher.  It didn&#39;t<br/>
go well.  She required homework, a certain amount of practice, lots of<br/>
exercises etc, and it just wasn&#39;t fun any more.  I talked with her<br/>
privately to see if she would just let him play and ease off the other<br/>
and she said &quot;that&#39;s not how we teach piano!&quot;   My son decided to quit<br/>
those lessons but took lessons again when his former instructor came home<br/>
for the summer.   He hasn&#39;t taken lessons in a year, but he still plays. <br/>
He asked me if we could find another student so he could learn some<br/>
Christmas songs and I&#39;ll call the high school band teacher today and ask<br/>
if he knows anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
We bought the piano before he was taking lessons.  We bought it because<br/>
it was old and beautiful and an amazing price.  At the time we lived in<br/>
the smallest house and we had to put our sofa in the back of my husbands<br/>
truck to fit the piano in the living room.  We lived with one chair and a<br/>
piano bench  for two years before we moved into a bigger place.  We<br/>
actually discoverd a lot of our friends could play a little when the only<br/>
place to sit was at the piano. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
We bought a used violin so Dylan could mess around with it.  He hasn&#39;t<br/>
wanted lessons but he enjoys it.  He&#39;s lately playing his recorder and<br/>
has asked for bongo drums and we&#39;ll find some somewhere I&#39;m sure.  He<br/>
plays around with his dads guitar sometimes.  He has tried my brothers<br/>
flute and we rented a piccolo for a while but he never took lessons.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think any of it is a waste.  He&#39;s getting what he needs for now.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t push the practice.  Just let her decide the level of<br/>
participation she wants right now.  Maybe the lessons are still fun and<br/>
that can&#39;t hurt.   Let it be her choice.<br/>
<br/>
We found a clarinet for my niece by calling around to some of the folks<br/>
who gave lessons and asking where we could find a used clarinet.  One<br/>
steered us to a student who had just switched to something else and we<br/>
bought a fairly good one for $50.00.   It might take a little effort but<br/>
you could call music stores and schools and so on and just ask where you<br/>
might find a good used flute for a good price.  If you have a symphony in<br/>
your area call some of the members who play flute and get their ideas. <br/>
There are also pawn shops.   Maybe renting for a while would be ok, until<br/>
she knows for sure.<br/>
<br/>
People with little hands can have a hard time with a flute so visiting a<br/>
music store where she could hold one might be good. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always tried to let things like this be between my child and her<br/>
chosen teacher. I&#39;ll help, if asked, but I don&#39;t feel that  making her<br/>
practice is my job. If the teacher is willing to continue to give lessons<br/>
to someone who doesn&#39;t practice regularly (or at all), and the child<br/>
still wants to continue with the lessons, then that&#39;s fine. If the<br/>
teacher isn&#39;t, maybe a different teacher would be okay with that set-up,<br/>
or maybe lessons from a teacher aren&#39;t the right way for her to learn<br/>
right then.<br/>
