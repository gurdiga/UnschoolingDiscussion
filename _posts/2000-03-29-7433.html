<div id="ygrps-yiv-538162668">carol from wi, not only was it fun to have a glimpse of your day with <br/>
7children, but also i was impressed with your mental track of the day.  <br/>
meaning, i think if i went to write it down, i wouldnt have near the grasp of <br/>
what time it was (even approx) when who was doing anything.  it is probably a <br/>
personality thing, i lose track of time pretty easily and get immersed in <br/>
what i am doing...  and it may be a gift of yours that is a blessing bc you <br/>
are constantly tracking so many people.  thank you so much for taking the <br/>
time to type and sharing with us! <br/>
erin<br/>
ps i was relieved to hear of the follow-up crashing on the couch bit.  thnx <br/>
for that, too!</div>
