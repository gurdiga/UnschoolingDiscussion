<div>We&#39;re in NE Ohio.&nbsp; We have a very large gas fired kiln, which my dh 
designed and we built around 11 yrs ago. We were just talking about our work 
last evening.&nbsp; It is not always an easy way to earn a living and it is 
always a great way to learn to live!!! We are a micro-business--work lots, work 
hard. Don&#39;t work, don&#39;t get paid and all that stuff.&nbsp; Just like thousands 
of other mom and pop places all over.&nbsp;&nbsp; But to be free enough to 
explore our creativity in a concrete way (making stuff) makes exploring our 
creativity in other ways--living consciously, learning about healing(homeopathy, 
herbs, energy work), parenting et al--somehow easier fo us--or amybe it&#39;s the 
other way around. (does this make sense)</div>
<div>&nbsp;Anyway it works for us</div>

loved working with clay, but after I moved away from where I had a kiln 
available, I haven&#39;t been able to do anything.&nbsp; i miss it&nbsp;a
