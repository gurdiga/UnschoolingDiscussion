<br>Kris, we may be cut of the same cloth, so-to-speak, as far as working out a 
<br>Christian life and the struggle about where to fit. I am a christian and a 
<br>feminist, and i believe they can work together, and i also find being an 
<br>UNschooler among Christians is rare, as is AP, co-sleeping, etc. I am 
<br>currently reading an excellent book about Paul, who has been tauted as the 
<br>misogynist of the scriptures, but the book shows how the Greek cultural norms 
<br>at the time of interpretation actually reversed Paul&#39;s intentions for 
<br>male-female relating. &nbsp;Anyway, i would love to know more about your Xn 
<br>unschooling list.

I find myself here also<br/>
we recently moved to a smaller town from Houston Tx<br/>
it seems everyone is homeschooling and it has been difficult to relate<br/>
I have found one other person who is unschooling and we are still<br/>
searching for others<br/>
looks like we may have to start our own group here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191762958">Based on how Jesus taught, I get the impression he was quite fond of<br/>
the unschooling method however in the area of Christian teaching I have<br/>
only come across very &quot;structured&quot;  resource books such as Cathy Duffy&#39;s<br/>
Christian curriculum.   I was wondering how some of you unschool with a<br/>
Christian twist.   We pretty much live our lives, pray and read bible<br/>
stories. Is there more to it?  Do you have your children do anything<br/>
&quot;structured&quot; like memorize bible verses or attend any formal sunday<br/>
schooling? What do you do? I am very curious and open to any<br/>
suggestions.<br/>
    Also, several months ago I stumbled on to a kid&#39;s website that had<br/>
math games with a Christian theme.  It used the numbers presented in<br/>
different bible stories to create mathematical questions and problems to<br/>
solve.  It was really amazing to see how prevalent mathematics was in<br/>
the bible.  I had never thought about it in this way.  I thought I<br/>
bookmarked it but I cant&#39; seem to locate it.  Have any of you come<br/>
across Christian websites similar to this one described that I could<br/>
check out.  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972795530">Hi Carrie<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I treat learning like everything else in life, including my faith, it&#39;s a <br/>
natural part of who I am and living.  I don&#39;t have a separate time or <br/>
approach for learning, breathing or morality.  My children see what I believe <br/>
and Who I believe in by my actions and learning is happening all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care for &quot;Sunday School&quot; since it is modeled after institutional <br/>
learning.  I would prefer that my children be WITH me in church as part of <br/>
the complete gathering of people.  As for Bible instruction, I follow the <br/>
examples given there and we spend time reading scripture and then discussing <br/>
it as a family.  Kids don&#39;t need a push in this direction, they are naturally <br/>
curious about everything, even God.  Be there with them to answer their <br/>
questions and show them how to read the Bible for themselves.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are a LOT of web sites for science and mathematics.  I don&#39;t restrict <br/>
my research to Christian sites.  We research BOTH popular theories of <br/>
creation and evolution and they share many facts and hypothesis.  I tell the <br/>
kids what I believe and why.<br/>
<br/>
I will take a look a look at my bookmarks and post some of them for you later.<br/>
