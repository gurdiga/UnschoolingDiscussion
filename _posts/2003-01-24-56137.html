&lt;&lt; We will agree to disagree; I know many conservative Christians, and <br/>
 they are not spankers, nor do their ministers tell them to spank. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t change the fact that in a huge population of conservative <br/>
Christians it IS common and encouraged.<br/>
Just because a person has some friends that don&#39;t fit the mold, doesn&#39;t mean <br/>

&lt;&lt; Again, these are choices that a parent makes.  A book itself cannot <br/>
 force an unwilling parent to spank their child; nor can any speaker <br/>
 force an unwilling parent to spank.  Parents who are feeling coerced <br/>
 and are opposed to spanking can walk away from a book, a speaker, a <br/>
 church.  They do not HAVE to spank; they are making a choice, a <br/>
 decision, to spank; and if they claim coercion, it is because they <br/>
 allowed themselves to be coerced.  They oughta grow a spine and <br/>
 say, &quot;No.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s just all the fault of people that don&#39;t have other information and <br/>
listen to the leaders of their church?<br/>
The leaders have no responsibility for the bad information they support?<br/>
Hmm....<br/>
I have a personal story for you.<br/>
My parents were both raised in the church they also raised us in. It is a <br/>
very legalistic, cult-like church and they were taught (both by the way they <br/>
were raised and church ideas) that spanking was good and right.<br/>
Funny thing is, they never felt a need to spank me up until I was three and <br/>
some of the ministers pointed out that I was too &quot;self willed&quot; and they <br/>
should spank me.<br/>
There was a lot of pressure from folks and they succumbed. They thought they <br/>
were doing the right thing. So these things DO sway people to do differently <br/>
than their instinct dictates.<br/>
Church is often about fitting in, not rocking the boat, so you&#39;re going to <br/>
have people more receptive to adhering to leadership views.<br/>
<br/>
My folks later had horrible guilt for the spankings foisted upon all of us <br/>
and begged us not to spank our own. So far, all three of the biological <br/>
siblings don&#39;t believe in spanking.<br/>
One sister has a very little one, just 1.5 y.o. and is using time out <br/>
occasionally, so she still doesn&#39;t see all the options available, but it&#39;s <br/>
gotten better with each generation.<br/>
<br/>

cyberhead &lt;g&gt;, I will say that the parents who spank do so because <br/>
they have made a choice to spank.  They may have been encouraged; <br/>
they may even have been instructed or admonished to spank, but they <br/>
made that decision to strike their child.  The parents bear that <br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Religious and political leaders throughout time have preached and <br/>
supported bad information.  People have a choice whether to believe <br/>
it, to accept it, and whether to act on it.<br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a personal story for you.<br/>

sufficient to say that I was spanked as a child, often with a belt.  <br/>
That is why I made my original post on this thread.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t encountered Hawaii, or New Zealand, but I am convinced they exist.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not in the Bible Belt.  I&#39;m in New Mexico.  But I had a neighbor three <br/>
houses up from me who had three children (and two up and out from a previous <br/>
marriage) whose husband converted to Christianity after they were married, <br/>
took her and the children to a church less than a mile from my old house, and <br/>
informed them that they were going to start homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
She went along because they were caught up in the fervor of getting <br/>
themselves and their children right with God.  Everyone at that church <br/>
homeschooled.  They all used the same curriculum.  I guess those who didn&#39;t <br/>
want to homeschool went to another church.<br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque.  Not even in the southeast.  Not even in Texas.<br/>

<br/>
This stuns me.  You will  NOT encounter them unless you move where they are <br/>
or you join one of their churches.  <br/>
<br/>
There are state homeschooling conventions in southern states which are HUGE.  <br/>
THOUSANDS of families.  Vendors raking in money by selling them stuff to <br/>
guarantee that their children will learn, will be good Christians, will not <br/>
be exposed to evolution or multi-culturalism.  Those conventions begin and <br/>
end with prayer.  Many of the speakers are men beause of a Bible verse.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to believe me.  But to say you don&#39;t believe me because you <br/>
haven&#39;t seen it is a weird response.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Come to a CHEO convention and you&#39;ll hear all about it. Turn on <br/>
Dr. James Dobson&#39;s program in the mornings for a year and <br/>
you&#39;ll her it every eight weeks or so. Read any parenting website <br/>
for fundamentalist Christians, and spanking will be  aprimary <br/>
tool discussed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve discovered by getting out of that world that there is a huge <br/>
population of Christians who don&#39;t identify with the <br/>
fundamentalist born again movement. I think they hardly know it <br/>
exists. Mainline denominations that are non-evangelical often <br/>
don&#39;t have an awreness that there are plenty of vocal Christians <br/>
who believe in the inerrancy of Scripture and who take the <br/>
commandments therein literally (not open to interpretation).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the term conservative is alarming since Debbie feels <br/>
she is a conservative person or is conservative politically or in <br/>
most of her Christian beliefs and therefore feels lumped into this <br/>
label. <br/>
<br/>
But Christian fundamentalists (often evangelicals) use the terms <br/>
conservative and fundamentalist interchangeably and there is a <br/>
distinct movement that teaches these things. I was in it! (And the <br/>
parents who spank often are not angry people! I know so many <br/>
who aren&#39;t. They use it as a tool to train their children. I don&#39;t <br/>
happen to agree with it but I don&#39;t think assuming they are all <br/>
pathologically angry is accurate either. They sincerely believe <br/>
that they are being obedient to God and are raising godly kids.)<br/>
<br/>
It is a movement that incorportes a lot more than spanking. Here <br/>
are some of the authors people read who hold this view:<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan Lindvall<br/>
The Pearls (Debbie and what&#39;s his name)<br/>
Richard Fugate<br/>
Dr. James Dobson<br/>
Mary Pride<br/>
Gary and Anne Marie Ezzo<br/>
<br/>
And scores more...<br/>

<br/>
I know.<br/>
My mom would never spank when she was angry.  She waited until she was calm.  <br/>
And she would tell us in advance how many swats.  I don&#39;t remember it being <br/>
more than five or six, sometimes just two or three.  And she would make us <br/>
bring the weapon and put it on her bed, and pull up our skirts, and bend <br/>
over/lie down on the bed, and wait.<br/>
<br/>
And she wasn&#39;t even religious as an adult, but she was from a long line of <br/>
people whose religion required corporal punishment.<br/>
<br/>
She thought if she spanked without anger, that it was no harm/no foul from <br/>
her.  I had earned my &quot;consequences&quot; (she didn&#39;t use that word, but that&#39;s <br/>
exactly what she was thinking) and she was a hardly-involved party.  This was <br/>
just between me and the plainly-earned spanking.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people say PROUDLY as though a great wisdom is on them, &quot;Never strike <br/>
a child in anger.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
WHAT!?<br/>
If you hit someone in a fury, that&#39;s understandable.  <br/>
If you wait until you&#39;re calm and you do it ANYWAY, what the heck is THAT?<br/>
<br/>
If a man catches his wife in bed with his best friend and kills them both <br/>
right on the spot, he&#39;s WAY more likely to get off than if he sees them, <br/>
waits a month, plans sneaky murders, and offs them in a subtle fashion.  That <br/>
second example is just plain murder.  The first is a crime of passion.<br/>

It is only in the last year, that I can speak up and say anything bad about <br/>
the church I was raised in. <br/>
Even after leaving and seeing how wrong it is, there is this huge amount of <br/>
loyalty brainwashed into you. I cringed when people called it a cult, but it <br/>
is. They didn&#39;t even identify themselves with the Christian fundamentalists <br/>
or any other Christian group as they are the ONLY right ones. Other <br/>
Christians are shunned even.<br/>
So now I can say it CULT, CULT, CULT!! So there.<br/>
And most of them think spanking is necessary and shows signs of being a good <br/>
parent.<br/>

So even if the numbers were straight-across even (I have no idea of that), <br/>
the intensity and fervor and immersion of the fundamentalists–the WEIGHT of <br/>

Judaism does not teach original sin.  And it teaches that because the woman was created last, she is a spiritually higher being.<br/>
<br/>
Women are not required to attend synagogue for that reason, while men are required to attend, AND required to get married because they are spiritually inferior and need a woman to complete them.<br/>

<br/>
Being a Bible literalist, how do you know what to believe?<br/>
I think you believe the parts that your particular church emphasizes.  Those <br/>
things they have repeat-sermons on every year or so.  The things they quote.  <br/>
The verses in songs they often use.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves out 80% (or much more) of the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t matter which denomination or church, each has its 30 or 50 <br/>
favorite passages.  And they ignore the rest.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And would I even be able to call myself a Christian anymore, <br/>
because what would I know to be true about Christ?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People know what they believe.<br/>
Some people depend on what they see or directly experience.  <br/>
Some go with repeated &quot;test&quot; of belief, holding it up against situations and <br/>
opposing theories.<br/>
Some take the word of someone(s) they&#39;ve decided to trust.<br/>
Some go on faith, but faith is based on something too.  Faith in what?  Why?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How would I know if I should believe in heaven or God at all?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Over half the world isn&#39;t Christian, and also believes in God and some kind <br/>
of afterlife.<br/>
They&#39;re not only not Bible literalists, they&#39;re not even Bible owners.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you think the millions of nonliteralist Christians figure out what to<br/>
believe? (The thoughtful ones, at least, as opposed to the social and<br/>
cultural ones who are Christian just because it&#39;s familiar.)<br/>
<br/>
They think about it. They discuss it. They read about it. They come to their<br/>
own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty much the way scientists develop theories. They gather all the<br/>
information and look for patterns emerging and develop theories on the whys<br/>
and whats causing the patterns. As more information comes in, sometimes a<br/>
new pattern emerges and a new theory can be formulated. (Rarely completely<br/>
new, but a better and clearer understanding.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the difference between knowing the answer already exists and knowing<br/>
that we don&#39;t know enough to know the ultimate answer but have the ability<br/>
-- and often the need and drive -- to get as close as we can with what we<br/>
know. It&#39;s needing to understand even while knowing that we can&#39;t be sure<br/>
we&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you do the same with parenting and unschooling? There is no Bible for<br/>
either but you&#39;re still driven to figure out what is truth for you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How would I know if I should believe in heaven or God at all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a question that&#39;s been asked for eternity!<br/>
<br/>
But why do you phrase it as &quot;should&quot;? As though it were some form of cosmic<br/>
etiquette?<br/>
<br/>
I think most nonliteralist Christians, as well as thoughtful believers in<br/>
other faiths, believe what they do because it feels right in their hearts<br/>
and their heads and their whole being. And, come to think of it, it applies<br/>
to atheists too!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And would I even be able to call myself a Christian anymore,<br/>
&gt; because what would I know to be true about Christ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that ultimately what Christ wants? For you to know what&#39;s true?<br/>
<br/>
What if you ended up honestly and heartfeltfully believing something that<br/>
was wrong? What would happen here on earth? What would happen afterwards?<br/>
<br/>
I think for nonliteralist Christians, the answer is God knows their hearts<br/>
and knows who is doing the best they can. I think for the nonliterlist, the<br/>
quest *isn&#39;t* to figure out what God wants them to do. They already know God<br/>
wants them to be good (to each other and themselves). (And to form a<br/>
relationship with God so He can help them.) So the quest is to figure out<br/>
how to put good into practice.<br/>

    Trust in your heart. When you beleive and except Jesus into your heart<br/>
he is there always. Natural curiousity also get you to look at what you<br/>
beleive and I beleive the Holy Spirit leads us to find those answers. I&#39;m<br/>
almost ashamed of calling myself christian with the way I have seen so<br/>
called christians act and thing that are said. Being Christ like comes from<br/>
within. We show it is our actions and our lives. Jesus didn&#39;t beat anyone<br/>
over the head or drum it into people. You have to do this or that. Go here<br/>
or there to *get* anything. He also taught in parables many time. IMO it was<br/>
so we could get it on our own in our own way. I&#39;m sure you remember the<br/>
story with the little children. Children are curious, trusting, full of<br/>
wonder, and want to learn. If we follow our heart, in Christ, _he_ will not<br/>
let his children go astray. I trust you will continue to beleive in him. He<br/>
sent the Holy Spirit to guide us. Let that be your guide. Man is oh so<br/>
fawlable. Look what they have done in Christs name. I&#39;ve been so saddened by<br/>
the not at all Christ like behaviour that has been passed as how Christ<br/>
would be. Do you really see Jesus hitting _anyone_? Belittling? Berating?<br/>
Slander? How about the keeping separated from non beleivers? How in the<br/>
world can anyone see Christ in us if we keep ourselves only in company of<br/>
other beleivers? How can they see Christ in our actions and lives? He sure<br/>
didn&#39;t force himself or beleif in God on anyone. I don&#39;t exspect you to<br/>
answer any of these. It&#39;s just something to think about and ponder, pray<br/>
over. I wish you well in your journey adn the path you have chosen. God gave<br/>
us all free choice.<br/>
    Well I&#39;m not the best writer but I hope you understand my drift.(Can&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
So you think the Bible has all the answers? What about your innate, God-given <br/>
abilities? What about trusting that YOU hold the answers.<br/>
How is it that folks like Abraham or Moses had divine answers? THEY didn&#39;t <br/>
have a Bible!! No one IN the Bible had the bible as it is today, but they <br/>
managed to have divine experiences and find their spirituality if you believe <br/>
those stories.<br/>
Just HOW did that happen?<br/>
Perhaps it is an innate thing for us to be spiritual beings. Perhaps (if you <br/>
believe in god) God is all around us, in us, part of us in ways that don&#39;t <br/>
need some man made book to tell us.<br/>
How is it that books Jesus wrote didn&#39;t make it into the Bible as it is <br/>
today. Do you not see how it has been twisted and turned by MAN&#39;S desire to <br/>
control others?<br/>
If what Jesus wrote didn&#39;t get in,I don&#39;t see how any Christian can deny that <br/>
it is hugely affected by people!!<br/>
<br/>
I see it just as I see the trust in unschooling. We are innately good, we <br/>
have all that we need within us to find god/spirituality. Institutions have <br/>
dulled our power and ability to trust ourselves. Including the institution of <br/>
church and the Bible.<br/>

think.  He wasn&#39;t always just a peace&#39;n&#39;love guy.  And those Christians who <br/>
do beleive they should hang around only with other beleivers have Bible <br/>
verses to justify that.  And that&#39;s the basis of the Statement of Faith <br/>
homeschooling groups.  They don&#39;t want their children&#39;s lives polluted by the <br/>
presence of even other kinds of Christians.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887228426">&lt;&lt; Do you really see Jesus hitting _anyone_? Belittling? Berating? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The moneylenders in the temple.<br/>
Pharisees. (Belittling)<br/>
<br/>
Interesting you should mention this.  Here is another tid bit from Judaism:<br/>
<br/>
The money lenders were supposed to be there because people were coming from all over with different kinds of currency and different needs.  For those that lived too far from the Temple, they were permitted to buy their sacrifice at the Temple instead of carrying it with them and risking spoilage.<br/>
<br/>
It was the money lenders that made it possible for them to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to find the reference in the &quot;Old Testament&quot; about that.  Its been awhile since I looked that one up.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s off the top of my head.<br/>
<br/>
And there will be much smiting, belitting and berating (&quot;I know ye not&quot; kind <br/>
of stuff) when Jesus comes again, if the literal apocalypse tales are to be <br/>
believed.<br/>
