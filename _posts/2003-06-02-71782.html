<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427810134">**I know it&#39;s acting but I wonder how hard that is for a couple who act. <br/>
Could I support my husband in his career if it meant he was going to get <br/>
naked with other women frequently? How insecure would I get? Couple that <br/>
with endless magazines speculating further and I wonder how  any marriages <br/>
in Hollywood survive.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite shows is Alias....well was, I haven&#39;t seen it in a couple <br/>
of months...but anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My friend and I were talking about Sydney&#39;s first kiss with Vaughn (sp).  <br/>
OMG!  The steam and chemistry was just oooozing!!  Not that that would be <br/>
hard, I mean Michael Vartan...oo-la-la!  And Jennifer Garner ain&#39;t so bad <br/>
herself, iykwim! ;P  I&#39;d kiss those lips! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I digress.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t long after that she and Scott Foley announced they were splitting <br/>
up.  I&#39;ve heard rumors that she and Michael Vartan are possibly an item, but <br/>
whatever.  Now, I too cannot imagine being married to an actor and watching <br/>
him suck face and whatever else with beautiful women all day, but if I were <br/>
Jennifer Garner and *had* to go around kissing Michael Vartan all day???  <br/>
I&#39;d have to hope that my husband and I were on *tight*.  I mean, those two <br/>
have amazing chemistry.  I don&#39;t think you can fake it that well.  I have no <br/>
idea why they broke up other than their scheduling conflicts, which would be <br/>
enough to kill any marriage, even a happy one, but I can well see where <br/>
Scott would have every reason to be jealous.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer  (I think we found a house!!!!  Going to look inside in the <br/>
morning.  Yippeee!!!)<br/>
