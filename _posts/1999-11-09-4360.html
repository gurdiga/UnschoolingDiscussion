&lt;&lt; And, this being America, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll soon come up with a new<br/>
 prescription drug or perhaps evening courses and certification programs in<br/>
 order to shore up any slight weakening which may occur in the child-mother<br/>
 bond. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think they would rather do away with the bond all together. In my state <br/>
they would like to have all day kindergarten statewide (we already have it in <br/>
Columbus) and optional pre-k for 4yr olds. Gee, wasn&#39;t kindergarten once <br/>
optional? Not now, at least here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Part of it I think, is that they exhaust the children with constant<br/>
activities so that they do not have time to think about the fact that they<br/>
are tired or want to go home.  Their chief goal is to prepare these little<br/>
ones for future years in school as good, quiet, obedient students.  If they<br/>
are so bedazzled and numb from the never ending preschool and kindergarten<br/>
schedule, they will not fight too hard in gradeschool.<br/>

 I have a nephew who&#39;s mother had to pull him out after a couple of mos of <br/>
all day Kindergarten. he was 5 they can wait to go until age 6 here. He could <br/>
not sit still. He would tell everyone he quit school. sadly he&#39;s back this <br/>
year, I can&#39;t imagine his mom hsing but I know that strange things can happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794108850">Here in our local town (NC) they just built this preschool affiliated with the<br/>
school.  Everyone was so excited about it.  The parents  have to go through<br/>
training classes when the child gets in.<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to figure out why everyone was so excited.  I have no desire for<br/>
my kids to leave home any earlier than driving age.   Heee....  Heee.....<br/>

that means child development according to that school?<br/>
