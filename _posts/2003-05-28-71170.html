<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Gotta have structure, IMO. NOt etched in stone, strictly followed,<br/>
&gt; hour to hour scheduling. THAT doesn&#39;t work for anyone. But, you know,<br/>
&gt; structure. Like, a load of laundry a day and shine your sink every<br/>
&gt; day. Or, run the vacuum twice a week. Or maybe a daily goal of<br/>
&gt; writing 1,000 words, if one has a longer term goal of being a writer.<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is THAT averse to the principles of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, that&#39;s called running my life.  As long as I&#39;m making these goals for<br/>
myself, choosing to follow them myself, and doing any self-clobbering for<br/>
not accomplishing them, it&#39;s my choice.<br/>
<br/>
If I make the goals for my son, follow up on whether he&#39;s done them, and<br/>
institute punishment for failure to accomplish the goals, then it&#39;s not<br/>
unschooling.  It&#39;s not his choice.<br/>
<br/>
I run my life.  He runs his.  They look very different, but we&#39;re good with<br/>
that.<br/>
