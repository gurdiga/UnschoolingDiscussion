being done. Lots of parents won&#39;t want to admit this because then they have <br/>
to look at their own behaviour and that is not easy to do and adults <br/>
oftentimes want to not take responsibility and they cannot see how what they <br/>
do and say shows up in their children. <br/>

(and other people as well) are a mirror. . . if you don&#39;t like what you see <br/>
in the reflection, change your own behavior.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298135026">That is not the universal answer.  I have three kids.  They are vastly<br/>
different from each other in temprament and action.  I know other<br/>
families with that kind of wildly vast spread in personality too.  So<br/>
unless the parents are all suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder,<br/>
you can&#39;t say that all children simply do as the see.  I&#39;m not saying<br/>

the only thing but I do believe it is always a factor in things. It&#39;s my <br/>
belief, and of course, anyone is free to disagree, but please don&#39;t tell me I <br/>
&quot;shouldn&#39;t say&quot; something. <br/>
<br/>
 And even the good things too! Let&#39;s not forget those. One thing we have <br/>
started doing is every night, we all say one thing we appreciate about each <br/>
other (including ourselves) that happened during the day. My husband and I <br/>
started doing it, then the kids wanted to join in. It has been a great lesson <br/>
in gratitude and appreciation. <br/>

simply mirror *different* aspects of us.<br/>
