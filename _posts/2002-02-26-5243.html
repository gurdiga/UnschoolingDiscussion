<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Patricia Joudry, a Canadian writer, and her husband John,  were doing this <br/>
&gt; in 1961.  The were living in England at the time. She wrote about their <br/>
&gt; experiences in  ...and the children played  , which was published in 1975.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some quotes from this book:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;We didn&#39;t educate our children; we just gave them freedom to be.  They <br/>
&gt; educated themselves and each other.  Nobody pushed them, nobody could have <br/>
&gt; stopped them&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;After a good deal of trial and error we finally came to our senses and <br/>
&gt; said, &quot;Okay.  There are the books.  If you want to know about them anytime, <br/>
&gt; just ask.  If you don&#39;t, skip it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Patricia wrote about extended nursing as follows:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;A friend asked: &quot;Isn&#39;t that child ever going to give up the breast?&quot;  <br/>
&gt; &quot;Why, certainly, she&#39;ll have to,&quot; said John.  &quot;Patricia will die <br/>
&gt; eventually.&quot;&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As she did in October 2000, in Powell River, B.C., at the age of 79.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the update - I read this book years ago, when we were starting <br/>
homeschooling, and used that quote about nursing SEVERAL times!!<br/>
