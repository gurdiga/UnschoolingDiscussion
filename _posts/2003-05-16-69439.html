<div id="ygrps-yiv-96403874">Hi again. I&#39;ve been gone for a couple of days and just this afternoon <br/>
checked in here. Been busy, have we? If I may be so bold, I&#39;d like to <br/>
throw an opinion or two in for your consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Observation one: is there a tendency to want to get in the final word <br/>
around here? It&#39;s okay for an argument to end by one party saying (to <br/>
herself) &quot;No more. This is fruitless. I&#39;m done.&quot; and then being <br/>
quiet. <br/>
<br/>
Observation two: obnoxiousness goes away if it&#39;s ignored. (I&#39;ve <br/>
observed this on other internet discussion groups, not here, because <br/>
it seems NOTHING gets ignored. There&#39;s always one more comment to be <br/>
made.) And now I&#39;ve made mine. <br/>
<br/>
Observation three: though I do like the idea of changing the subject <br/>
line if the internal contents of a post change, for those of us who <br/>
follow the discussion all through one thread on the website, as I do, <br/>
it would be good if the changed subject could be threaded with the <br/>
thread where it originated. Case in point: Joyce addressed Glena <br/>
about something, and I wanted to &quot;up thread&quot; to follow the <br/>
discussion...and found myself in the middle of a discussion about <br/>
smoking. Did Joyce &quot;change the subject line&quot; from something <br/>
completely unrelated to what the interior of the post addressed?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did Joyce &quot;change the subject line&quot; from something<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably!<br/>
<br/>
The way I post to the list is by clicking on a random post and changing the<br/>
subject. I&#39;ve seen hints by the goofy way posts get sorted sometimes that<br/>
there&#39;s some memory of what the subject line used to be. Maybe it&#39;s in all<br/>
the garbage that&#39;s in the header or something?<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I&#39;m just confused and am seeing things that aren&#39;t really there ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s some of that. Maybe a lot of that! But the fact that this list is<br/>
*very* important to some people should be taken into account. Many people<br/>
read the list casually. (Which would account for the phenomenon of people<br/>
still saying &quot;What conference in SC?&quot; ;-) Many people hang on each word. (I<br/>
did with the AOL message baords when I was first starting out.)<br/>
<br/>
To the volunteers who devote many hours a day to the list helping people,<br/>
they know that clarity is important. And often there is good that grows out<br/>
of the noisy clarification discussions. (Though there are less time<br/>
consuming ways to get the points across!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Observation two: obnoxiousness goes away if it&#39;s ignored.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. But sometimes the obnoxiousness does a lot of damage to people&#39;s<br/>
understanding in the mean time. Maybe the points that are being argued seem<br/>
unimportant to many people, but to long time unschoolers who understand the<br/>
misunderstandings that can stop someone from fully getting unschooling, the<br/>
&quot;unimportant&quot; points are often profoundly important.<br/>

<br/>
In case anyone is really shy, or has had some kind of previous trauma<br/>
with a moderator elsewhere &lt;g&gt;, I want to emphasize that it&#39;s OKAY to be<br/>
new and ask the easy questions.  (After a week of reading.)  And it is<br/>
*definitely* okay to ask about the SC conference, even if you are the<br/>
umpty-umpth person asking.  In fact, even though it would be tad<br/>
repetitive, it would be GREAT to have someone new, or newly &quot;aware&quot; ask<br/>
about it every single day between now and August.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry if anyone may have assumed I meant otherwise. I was just observing<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873337166">Hi, Joyce --<br/>
<br/>
I knew you didn&#39;t mean to shush anybody.  I just wanted to be<br/>
double-sure that no bewildered and very shy new person would possibly<br/>
hesitate *at all* to ask about the SC conference.  I wouldn&#39;t want that<br/>
person to miss the conf, or the conf to miss that person.  The more the<br/>
merrier! <br/>
<br/>
(There&#39;s a TV show message board that I have read for a full year and<br/>
*never* posted on, despite my inate talkativeness, because the<br/>
moderators are so strict and they actually chide people for drifting off<br/>
topic.  I know my abilities, and the ability to stay &quot;on topic&quot; is not<br/>
one of them.)  <br/>
