&gt; Pam or anyone,<br/>
&gt;  have you ever had ferrets? if so can you share the pros and cons? my son<br/>
&gt; would also like one of them and a sugar glider. we have been told that a<br/>
&gt; ferret smells no matter if they are descented and it can&#39;t be controlled.<br/>
&gt;   I am allergic to cats so I thought maybe a ferret would be a problem.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We LOVE ferrets, but I think they are very unsuitable for small children. A<br/>
mature 10 or so would probably be fine. They&#39;re very active, busy,<br/>
intelligent, and not unwilling to bite if not well trained and socialized.<br/>
<br/>
The boys smell more than the girls, but with bathing and frequent litter box<br/>
changes, the odor isn&#39;t overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re allergic to other mammals I&#39;d find a ferret breeder, or spend a<br/>
bunch of time with some ferrets in a pet store, and see how you react before<br/>
you decide.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761233311">From my experience with ferrets, they either are great or little pain in the <br/>
butts. It depends on their personalities. They seem to be either good or bad <br/>
and no in between!!!<br/>
<br/>
The bad ones are nerve wracking. They poop in the corners of your house if <br/>
you leave them loose, they refuse to litter train, they bite and scratch and <br/>
just behae as not good pets.<br/>
<br/>
The good ones get along great with dogs and cats and people. They are funny <br/>
and sweet and litter train easily and become joys to behold.<br/>
<br/>
All ferrets smell. They don&#39;t stink but they do have an odor. Some people <br/>
hardly notice. Some ferret love baths and if bathed like once a week, no <br/>
smell. They all love to play so leaving things out that you treasure if they <br/>
are loose is a no no. Certain things fascinate them and they will scoop them <br/>
up to play and you may never see them again. They also love small places and <br/>
can squeeze anywhere their little heads fit. Behind appliances and any kind <br/>
of opening in the house must be ferret proofed before you let them out.<br/>
<br/>
When they do play, some can get very rambunctious. For very small children, <br/>
it might not be a good idea. And some can get carried away and bite. It <br/>
hurts. They have the tiniest sharpest little teeth.<br/>
<br/>
People either love them as pets or swear never again.<br/>
