I&#39;ve tiled my kitchen counters, finished wallpapering and painted the kitchen <br/>
cabinets again, put in a wood floor and a new sink & fixtures in the kitchen, <br/>
put in new counters with sinks and fixtures in the bathrooms, pulled out all <br/>
the tile, tub, and toilet in the boys&#39; bathroom, installed a new tub and <br/>
walls--but haven&#39;t tiles those walls or the floor yet. I have the best garden I&#39;ve <br/>
ever had (a LOT of composting)----flowers and fruits and vegies! I&#39;ve had the <br/>
outside of the house painted (they finish tomorrow).  Oh--and the conference! &lt;<br/>
G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a BUSY summer! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

dreaming of finishing painting my living room and kitchen every since I broke my <br/>
ankle last year (has it really been almost a year?).   Fell down the stairs <br/>
with two walls done in each room.  I&#39;ve had vague plans to tile my bathroom <br/>
floor for a long time and even bought a book at home depot.  Maybe now that I&quot;m in <br/>
the second trimester, I&#39;ll actually get some of this stuff done.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so impressed to know you!  I&#39;m always more productive in the fall, <br/>
though.  I think it&#39;s  heat related thing.  But I can&#39;t wait for school to start and <br/>
all our favorite hang outs to thin out...<br/>

I wanted to tease Kelly that if she leads us to believe she has <br/>
superhuman powers, then we are going to want TWO conferences EVERY year <br/>
until ALL our kids are grown.   ::::: ducking, running, and going back <br/>
to resting on the couch like a tuber :::::<br/>
