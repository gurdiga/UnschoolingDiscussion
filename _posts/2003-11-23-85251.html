I could use some help figuring out how to do more academics to keep him <br/>
happy, but as little as possible to keep us happy. Sarah does like workbooks and <br/>
she&#39;ll do them in bits and spurts. I have to show a portfolio at the end of the <br/>
year but I&#39;m not really worried about pulling that together.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

My suggestion is to make immediate reservations for the Live & Learn <br/>
Unschooling Conference next August. It will make an incredible difference to him AND <br/>
her.<br/>

Do it. Do it now. You&#39;re too close to miss out on this opportunity!<br/>
