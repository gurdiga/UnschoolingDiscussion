<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868493019">I give the answers.  If I know them. ;)  The thinking doesn&#39;t stop just<br/>
because you know the answer How can a person think TO an answer when a<br/>
subject is still rather new?? You&#39;ve got to have a storehoue of facts in<br/>
order to be able to see a pattern. (which is what mathematics, the language<br/>
of patterns.)  We&#39;ve all pretty much discovered that rote memorization of<br/>
those facts does not bring understanding, it&#39;s actually putting it to use<br/>
that cements the knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
So, if while you are cooking today you she asks is 1/2 the same as 2/4ths, I<br/>
would say yes, it is and 3/6ths, 4/8th are all the same too.  Or if she asks<br/>
how many 1/2&#39;s make a whole cup, I&#39;d answer and give her a bit more<br/>
information.  Now she can THINK, she has information to think WITH.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that it&#39;s highly disrespectful to throw a question back into their<br/>
faces.  If they could figure it out, they wouldn&#39;t have asked the question.<br/>
I suppose this feeling is strong for me because I cannot spell well.   I<br/>
just don&#39;t see the patterns well enough to use them, as there are so many<br/>
exceptions.  Telling a nonspeller to *look up* a word is just stupid, they<br/>
have to be able to spell it well enough to find it in the dictionary.  If I<br/>
could get close enough to use a dictionary, I wouldn&#39;t be asking how to<br/>
spell something.<br/>
<br/>
And remember, learning is not being able to come up with the *right answer*.<br/>
Having the answer is a school thing.  Learning is that thinking and<br/>
communicating process that brings understanding. Understanding is something<br/>
we use.  Give her the fractions information and let her use it, that will<br/>
bring understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Answering our children&#39;s questions is a privilege.  It&#39;s in those moments we<br/>
get to peak into their thinking processes, we get to help them understand<br/>
the world we brought them into.  It would be a shame to thwart the very<br/>
connections we need open and healthy. just so we could feel in control.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Asking other people is a good way to find out something you need to know. I<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;d like it if I asked my husband or a co-worker a question and<br/>
they told me to go look it up, especially if I was right in the middle of a<br/>
task. I think it&#39;s perfectly ok to give a quick and easy answer to a kid who<br/>
just needs to know something right then. If it seems appropriate, I might<br/>
tell them where they can find that info if they need it next time. Or I<br/>
might pull out a book about it later and show them. Or point out to them<br/>
when the same subject occurs in another context.<br/>

<br/>
I strive for a balance between encouraging them to find the answer and<br/>
giving it when they *can&#39;t* (won&#39;t, whatever).  Sort of like when they<br/>
are learning to walk, but sometimes are just tired and want to be<br/>
carried.  I think if we allow them to be dependent when they feel the<br/>
need, it will encourage independence in the long run.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462972473">I have a terrible time resisting being a didactic fool when it comes to these<br/>
issues.  I keep wanting my daughters to &quot;look it up etc. but I think it is nuts<br/>
on my part.  I like easy answers personally and haven&#39;t found that looking it up<br/>
myself improves necessarily my knowledge.  I now know that I can look up<br/>
something if I really need to.  If I really don&#39;t know and they really want to<br/>
know well then I can help them look it up if they want to. Otherwise I think it<br/>
is more of that artificial rush to independence that we are brainwashed to<br/>
believe is so important.  Gordon Neufeld in fact believe people should warmly<br/>
respond to their children&#39;s dependency.  Encourage it while it is there.  They<br/>
will become independent following natures&#39; plan for emergent independent<br/>
self-hood.  This happens usually much later than we think.  The real centered<br/>
self-hood emerges much more real and rooted when dependence has been welcomed and<br/>
the child is allowed to move out into the world at their own pace.  I think this<br/>
applies to learning too.  In any case my older daughter detests it when I wax<br/>
pedagouish.  She lets me know.  So I hereby publicly commit to stopping doing<br/>
this counterproductive, irritating, fundamentally disrespectful thing. Big effort<br/>
number.....I forget.<br/>

thoughts to add to the pot though.  DD is hardly incapable of these<br/>

in the dictionary by sounding out the first 3-4 letters, looking those up,<br/>
and then phonetically sounding out the words from there.  So why would it<br/>
be so hard to look up a word you don&#39;t know exactly how to spell?  By the<br/>
way, dd is far from a non-speller - language arts is her &quot;thing&quot; and she<br/>
spells at a level far above what she would be expected to in ps.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did not understand that reply at all............<br/>
I thought that is was good advice---just as any advice to be taken in<br/>
analyzed and then placed where it is needed (or not)<br/>
When my children ask me for an answer I just analyze the situation that they<br/>
are in<br/>
I.E.<br/>
If they were in the middle of cooking I would get out the larger liquid cup<br/>
and help them find the answer with me!<br/>
If we were in the middle of the store (AND this happened) my daughter asks<br/>
me &quot;where the sperm come from&quot;--I just tell her DADDY and leave it at that<br/>
for the moment......<br/>
If I was on the computer and very busy and they asked me what the date was I<br/>
would move my cursor to the right hand corner and let them KNOW......<br/>
Now if your question is one of how do I get my daughter to motivate<br/>
herself.....I can&#39;t answer (or offer any advice--wanted or<br/>
unwanted )...since I generally do not worry about &quot;laziness&quot;.<br/>
I wish that I had some advice...but when my kids are not doing their jobs or<br/>
cleaning their rooms (laziness?)---I explain to them what I expect and how<br/>
it all ties into the family and cooperation and life and on and on......Are<br/>
fractions that necessary?<br/>
I remember how hard it was for me to understand them--Is it understanding?<br/>
With some of my kiddies I have to &quot;sneak&quot; stuff in--my son refused to<br/>
read--SO I bought him stuff that I thought that he would really enjoy<br/>
reading or pointed out how there are so many words and ideas out there that<br/>
would be neat to know---AND of course you need to read when you play<br/>
learning games on the computer---AND he loved the action adventure games!<br/>
(only non-violent here--do you have any suggestions of good ones--9 year old<br/>
level)<br/>
Anyways--I hope that you can find your answer or her hers.....<br/>

phonetic understanding to get close to a correct spelling, but not enough<br/>
for the more difficult words, which would be the ones I personally would ask<br/>
for.  I also have one child that does not *get* phonics. It makes no sense<br/>
to him.  Part of the deal is also our hearing., I cannot hear some of the<br/>
subtle differences of some sounds/combinations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I can write about this well, but I see it clearly as a control<br/>
issue.    It is your perception of whether your daughter is being lazy or<br/>
not that is driving the train.  You use words like *lazy* and *skate*, there<br/>
are value judgments inherent within your perception. It&#39;s a choice to see<br/>
asking quick questions as being *lazy* and it&#39;s another choice to see<br/>
answering questions as allowing the kids to skate on our understanding.<br/>
Because you have a choice in how you view these issues, there is an element<br/>
of wanting to control inherent in your choice to view them negatively.<br/>
<br/>
I view such questions very differently. I do not think my children are lazy<br/>
or trying to skate through things by asking me for quick answers. I am not<br/>
privy to all that is going on in their head, but if what goes on in mine is<br/>
any indication having a question answered does not thwart thinking.  When my<br/>
children call out for a quick math question I assume they are thinking about<br/>
they want to know and will continue to think after they have the answer.<br/>
Over time they will integrate the information into their store of automatic<br/>
recall knowledge, just like they have done since they entered this world.<br/>
Remember when you had a baby? Or a toddler? How many repetitions did it take<br/>
for them to learn to turn on the VCR?  How many times did they try to say<br/>
water, before it came out water instead of waawer?  I choose to value<br/>
questions for just what they are, requests for help.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m going to complicate matters by saying that after all of this<br/>
thinking about questions and what goes on  when a child asks a question, you<br/>
might be right, she might be choosing to be *lazy*.<br/>
If that is so, you have to ask WHY she&#39;s choosing to be lazy.  Is it<br/>
personality? Is it fear?  Why would she prefer help to thinking for herself.<br/>
This is where I believe school and having to have the *right* answer comes<br/>
in and warps the learning process.   If we *schooled* learning to talk, we&#39;d<br/>
have a bunch of folks unable to speak and who eventually refuse to even try.<br/>
<br/>
And now, for the final point....there are times when the kids ask this or<br/>
that where I let it be known I think they ought to have already figured<br/>
whatever out.  I don&#39;t refuse to answer the question, and I do not shame<br/>
them by my response, but I also let them know that I have expectations and<br/>
being able to ___________is one of them.   This is that fuzzy line between<br/>
having a philosophy of education and parenting a human being.  It&#39;s a<br/>
delicate line of being able to answer them kindly and yet encourage their<br/>
own growth.  What I use as a benchmark is the way I am treated by those<br/>
still helping ME learn things. I have mentors and quires and there are times<br/>
when I ask for a quick and easy answer. A constant stream of figure it for<br/>
yourself would cause me to move on and find new mentors.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934063501">Laraine, I think part of this post explains on the average where the math<br/>
&quot;problem&quot; lies.  I&#39;ve found (with my own kidlets, foster kidlets and when I<br/>
worked at schools) that some kids are reading brained or math brained and<br/>
that that is the area they function in best.  My &quot;reading&quot; kidlets had no<br/>
problem doing &quot;word&quot; problems but to look at a sheet of paper with<br/>
&quot;numbers&quot; spread all over it seemed to be over whelming, and the same for<br/>
just &quot;doing&quot; those simple instant calculations.  My &quot;math&quot; kidlets whizzed<br/>
through &quot;numbers&quot; and even learning their ABC&#39;s but putting them together<br/>
and getting the words was more of a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.  Everything comes with time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161655309">hi,<br/>
<br/>
Telling a nonspeller to *look up* a word is just stupid<br/>
i&#39;m dyslexic and i could never  find the word in the dictionary, but what would<br/>
have worked is if someone took the time to help me.  for example if someone<br/>
would have asked me to take a wild guess at the spelling of a word they would<br/>
have quickly realized i was truly clueless as to even the first letter of the<br/>
word and once this was realized they could have been able to help me with ways<br/>
to compensate for this difficulty.   as it was i did not find out until i was 30<br/>
when i hired a private speech pathologist who tested me and confirmed my<br/>
suspicious (i&#39;m so happy for spell check:)<br/>
<br/>
but this seems to be a side issue to your original query.   i think the issue<br/>
is,  how to tell if your kid is being lazy and wants to use your brain and not<br/>
their own,  and the best answer i can give to this is -  give her the benefit of<br/>
the doubt (when it is humanly possible because it think kids do have radar for<br/>
their parents&#39; hot buttons) and answer her question with a question.  like &#39;i<br/>
don&#39;t know what do you think&#39;  and she&#39;ll probably follow this with &#39;i don&#39;t<br/>
know&#39; and you can say something like &#39;take a wild guess&#39; because this will let<br/>
her off the hook as far as being right and open up her imagination and<br/>
creativity.  because the answer is not what&#39;s at issue but the process of<br/>
thinking and mutual respect, you respecting her as able and will and she<br/>
respecting you as an integral part of her learning process.  i hope this helps<br/>
answer your question.  good luck.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it (math and reading) just comes with time.<br/>
<br/>
I think conquering a skill that could make your life better can be helped by <br/>
a parent like you recognizing that some people &quot;get&quot; numbers or reading <br/>
instantly, or quickly, and others don&#39;t.  I think you can work to those <br/>
strengths.  My son &quot;gets&quot; numbers right away.  Is way advanced in math.  <br/>
Daughter sees the world completely differently.  But I also see that she is <br/>
thrilled when she does get a number concept.  Except she gets it while <br/>
playing the piano.  While playing a game.  Etc.  Not just sitting at the <br/>
computer (remember paper and pencil??? gosh that was a long time ago).   <br/>
Reading is the same way here.  He sees patterns; she likes to be read to.  He <br/>
reads a book; she illustrates it.  But all (and, yes, I think all of the info <br/>
needs to get thru eventually and not in so long a time that it becomes <br/>
frustrating -- a failure rather than a different learning approach) of the <br/>
info is getting thru.  At different rates but getting thru.  In different <br/>
ways but getting thru.  I don&#39;t think this is forcing her to learn things she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to know.  I think this is enabling her to learn them in ways <br/>
that suit her.  <br/>
<br/>
Without comparing to her brother.  A bit of an issue around here.  She <br/>
compares.  I try not to.  When she brings it up, we talk about how much older <br/>
he is.  She now says she feels sorry for him because he has that much less <br/>
time to learn things!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I agree that each child is different and may learn differently.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think that means a completely hands-off approach.  As you may judge, I <br/>
am not a complete, radical unschooler.  We are a mix of many things around <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613926534">Differ away.  Everything does come with time and in its own time.  The<br/>
message was don&#39;t get so intense and worry so much.  Relax and accept the<br/>
different learning styles (which is exactly what you said in a different<br/>
way, btw).  The worry over age and &quot;grade&quot; is just so much bs pushed out by<br/>
the ps system.<br/>
<br/>
And, I can&#39;t quite understand your problem with an unschooling approach or<br/>
answer, this IS an unschooling list.  Unschooling is child led, not adult<br/>
force fed.  The adult is there to be a mentor and make available that which<br/>
the child&#39;s individual learning style needs when they need it.  That is the<br/>
kind of advise you are going to get from unschoolers and not just &quot;radical&quot;<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
And, as far as that goes, how in the world does knowing regimented math<br/>
make your life better???  I like math, I&#39;ve taken extra college courses<br/>
because to me they are fun.  But, knowing math has certainly not made my<br/>
life better.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that if they need the math they will learn the math.  I know<br/>
unschoolers who have gotten into Ivy League colleges who never touched a<br/>
math book, never made any efforts in the math department until they<br/>
realised they would need it to get into the college of their choice.  They<br/>
then learned the math, got into the college and haven&#39;t turned a page<br/>
since.  It came with time.  The right time for them.<br/>
<br/>
And, btw, this discussion was really over &quot;teaching&quot; and using Saxon math<br/>
and repetition, it wasn&#39;t about the diverse methods you were talking about.<br/>
