<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036038632">On the topic of how our husbands affect our unschooling lifestyle.. My <br/>
husband sent me this email this morning.. This has been an ongoing problem <br/>
for almost 3 mos.  He has to get up at  5am to drive an hour and half to work<br/>
<br/>
_____<br/>
I wish we could get the kids to gradually shift toward getting to sleep <br/>
earlier and getting up earlier. Really, after 10:00 at night - there&#39;s not <br/>
really all that much reason for kids to be up. There&#39;s nothing by crap on TV <br/>
- and what is on TV isn&#39;t for children, anyway. The only stimulation the get <br/>
is from themselves, or from us - to keep them going and staying up. I suppose <br/>
I should just make a rule that they have to turn off the games, TV&#39;s, etc. <br/>
and go to bed at 10:00. I can let them quiet down on their own - but if every <br/>
night, for an hour or 1 1/2 hours - I have to keep calling them down...then <br/>
eventually turn off games, or TV, then still have to call them down - then it <br/>
just doesn&#39;t work for me. <br/>
Â <br/>
I guess somehow - I got this idea in my head a long time ago - that in the <br/>
evening - the kids would go to bed and go to sleep - and the parents could <br/>
have a little time to relax, watch TV, talk, etc. But, that just never <br/>
happens.<br/>
_____<br/>
<br/>
Recently, after talking about this situation with Kelly, we started asking <br/>
them to quiet down so Dad could go to sleep.  Well, they dont.. I have had <br/>
MANY  calm, rational talks with them along the lines of.  You can stay up til <br/>
you get sleepy.  But you need to stay quiet.  Use a lower voice, turn the TV <br/>
down.  Please dont come in our rooom unless it is an emergency.  Daddy gets <br/>
up and goes to work very early because he loves us.   He provides for <br/>
everything we have.  If Daddy didnt work, you couldnt have XBOX and N64 and <br/>
tons of movies.  Daddy is very tired if he doesnt get enought sleep.   I have <br/>
offered suggestions.. Go downstairs and &quot;play&quot;   Either they dont want to, or <br/>
they run up and down the stairs and still continue to make noise.   Aside <br/>
from the calm discussions ( which they all agree to and understand)  I have <br/>
turned on the bitch attitude.. OK, thats IT.. Turn off the TV. get in bed. <br/>
NOW. this is enough... Or Dh has done the same thing.. Actually, thats what <br/>
it has eventually turned into every night.. About 3 or 4 &quot;warnings&quot; not <br/>
really warnings, but.. getting up out of bed, going to their room and asking <br/>
them to please quiet down. . or break up a fight or ask them to turn the TV <br/>
down.  Then finally, laying down the law and turning the stuff off and the <br/>
lights out.. Then they go to sleep in about 15-20 mins.. Still, its a couple <br/>
hours after Dh NEEDS to be asleep.. And also NO &quot;private&quot; time for us. ..  <br/>
So, what to do?   This is not something that can just &quot;work&quot; its self out.  <br/>
Its already been almost 3 mos of sleep deprivation for him.   We dont have <br/>
months for them to self regulate or learn new principles.   We have ran out <br/>
of creative options.  The only option left is .. what?? for my husband to <br/>
sleep out in the garage?? pitch the tent in the yard??  Get his own place <br/>
nearer his work?  ( not feasible, anyway)  This is a real problem..  I DO <br/>
want advice and suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292530613">Hi Teresa<br/>
<br/>
We have a &quot;night owl&quot; among us, our Katie. So, we&#39;ve always said, <br/>
from the beginning &quot;You may stay up as late as you want, in your <br/>
room.&quot; some nights, she must be up and active, because we find her <br/>
asleep the next morning in a nest next to the bed, or in a big box. <br/>
Or, with a pile of books, stuffed toys, and a radio all lined up nice <br/>
and neat along the wall-side of the bed. But she does all this <br/>
quietly, in her own space. <br/>
<br/>
We also were able to &quot;adjust&quot; her inner clock a little bit, when we <br/>
went through a phase of getting the house moving by 7:30 am. I still <br/>
go down and give everyone&#39;s bed a little shake at that time, and by <br/>
8:30 ish, the kids are up and getting something to eat, most days. <br/>
This meant Katie, having gotten up so durn early, was tired by 10:00 <br/>
at the latest and fell asleep easier, most nights. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you have to stir your brood that early. That&#39;s ungodly <br/>
to lots of people...heck, by 7:30 I&#39;ve already been up for an hour <br/>
and a half...but rattling them a bit earlier in the morning, for <br/>
several days in a row...that might just turn their clocks back a bit.<br/>
<br/>
hope you figure something out.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi <br/>

<br/>
Hi, Teresa --<br/>
<br/>
I sympathize, I really do.  My husband is a pretty fragile sleeper who<br/>
can&#39;t get back to sleep if he&#39;s interrupted, and can&#39;t manage to sleep<br/>
past 6am, no matter what time he goes to sleep.  My son and I do a lot<br/>
of tiptoeing.  (But one kid just can&#39;t make as much noise as two, so I<br/>
have an easier situation.)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday dh got off work early and fell asleep on the couch in the<br/>
afternoon.  I couldn&#39;t even go online while he was napping, as my modem<br/>
makes a loud screechy noise and is in earshot of the couch.  (Your post<br/>
reminded me that I could turn down the sound on my computer, so I did that.)<br/>
<br/>
When I travel, I sleep with ear plugs, as motel noises will wake me ten<br/>
or more times a night if I don&#39;t.  I also have an air purifier in my<br/>
room that makes about the same &quot;white noise&quot; as a fan.  I run that every<br/>
night.  I&#39;ll turn that on even if I&#39;m just reading in my bedroom to<br/>
block out the interrupting sounds.<br/>
<br/>
For your boys, I&#39;d be tempted to forbid them access to the stairs unless<br/>
they are tiptoeing up to bed (or to reach you in an actual emergency). <br/>
I&#39;d put a gate or a banner across the bottom of the stairs as a physical reminder.<br/>
<br/>
For quality romantic time with your spouse, if you can&#39;t make the switch<br/>
to love in the morning when your dh wakes up (not my favorite), then<br/>
lock the door and maybe play some kind of loud, makeout music on the<br/>
stereo so that not too many sounds go through the door either from<br/>
outside or from inside.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to take my kid to the park today so he&#39;s not bouncing<br/>
off the walls tonight.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, thats what we did &quot;before&quot;  when they were in school.  Their bedtime <br/>
was 10:00 pm .. not like &#39;set in stone&quot;.. but a good target to work towards.. <br/>
And of course, getting up at 7 am, they were tired by 10..   And, this IS <br/>
what my husband is leaning towards again..  Landon stays up til..???? I have <br/>
no idea how late.. He does get off the computer ( which is in our room) by <br/>
10pm..  or so.. as soon as he can wrap stuff up.. But he stays up watching <br/>
TV, talking on the phone, reading, heck, whatever.. He still gets up to go to <br/>
school, but he will take a nap in the afternoon if he is tired.    The other <br/>
3.. Anna has her own room, but she perfers to sleep with Ethan and JP.. She <br/>
feels lonely downstairs by herself.  Landons br is downstairs too, but he <br/>
stays in his room.    JP sleeps with us sometimes.. either with us or Anna, <br/>
he does not like to sleep alone either.    I guess with all 3 of them in <br/>
there together with the TV, VCR XBOX, its just like a party and the cant <br/>
settle down without some &quot;limits&quot;  I talked to Anna today about sleeping in <br/>
her own room..  She is the &quot;least&quot; loud one.. she feels like she is reaping <br/>
the consequences of the boys actions ( and, really, she is).. She says she IS <br/>
quiet, and also, they keep her awake too. she would be asleep sooner if they <br/>
didnt make so much noise.   She still didnt want to sleep in her room. She <br/>
said she&#39;d rather have us to &quot;make&quot; them turn the stuff off and settle down <br/>
at 10 than sleep  in her room alone.   I guess this will be what we have to <br/>
do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This piece of advice coming from you shocks me, Sandra! lol  I would <br/>
have expected you to say that she just needed to talk to them more <br/>
and be more patient, or that he should find a sound-proof door for <br/>
his room, or something! lol  <br/>
<br/>
How is the piece of advice not a punishment or shaming them for not <br/>
being able to control themselves?  &quot;You have been given many chances <br/>
to keep quiet after your dad went to bed and you continually blew it, <br/>
so now I&#39;m going to insist on an arbitrary bedtime&quot;.  Isn&#39;t this <br/>
authoritarian?  (And I&#39;m genuinely asking, not picking a fight)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kind of along these lines, I lost it with my kids this morning.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been feeling edgy for the last few days because of their behavior and <br/>
continuous refusal to help me do much of anything, and this morning I <br/>
just felt like I didn&#39;t even want to get out of bed and deal with <br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
Our plans were to do some running around today.  We were going to go <br/>
out to eat at Duncan Donuts, stop at the pet store, the library, and <br/>
Wal-mart.  All of these things were places that at least one of the <br/>
kids wanted to go to for some project or another.  They all had been <br/>
asking for donuts, and this was a good day to go.  They were <br/>
fighting, and one of them wouldn&#39;t get his socks on.  He said that he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t, that he wanted me to get them and put them on for him.  He <br/>
is 5 1/2 years old and more than capable of getting his own socks <br/>
on.  That pushed me over the edge, and I asked my daughter (with a <br/>
definite edge in my voice) if she would please get her brother some <br/>
socks to wear since he refuses to cooperate with the rest of the <br/>
family.  She did, and I gave them to him and I said (with even more <br/>
of an edge in my voice) that I am sick and tired of him never doing <br/>
anything for himself and never cooperating with anything I ask him to <br/>
do.  He put his socks on when he saw I was about to lose it.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I held the door open and asked if everyone could please go out <br/>
the door and get in the car.  I asked them if they thought they could <br/>
manage to do it without fighting, complaining, hitting, or kicking <br/>
anybody else.  My daughter looked at me really weird and <br/>
said, &quot;Mommy, what is wrong?&quot; lol  I said, &quot;Nothing, I&#39;m just in a  <br/>
really bad mood, so please get in the car&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
When we all got in the car, I decided to be honest.  I told them that <br/>
I was sick of them always expecting me to do everything for them.  I <br/>
told them that no one ever cleans up their dishes or throws away <br/>
their candy wrappers or puts their things away when they&#39;re done with <br/>
them.  I told them that I really want to do all these cool things <br/>
with them, but that it&#39;s been really frustrating lately. We do the <br/>
cool things, no one EVER decides that they want to help me do any <br/>
clean up, and while I&#39;m cleaning up, they mess up more somewhere <br/>
else. I told them that I CAN NOT keep up with it anymore.  I gave <br/>
them last night as an example.  Last night, I made a cake for my <br/>
three year old at his request, because we&#39;re celebrating big blue <br/>
monkey&#39;s birthday today. (Big Blue Monkeky is a stuffed animal) It <br/>
was a Thomas the tank engine cake, with lots of colored wilton <br/>
icing.  I didn&#39;t mind doing it at all, and it was fun because he <br/>
helped me mix the colors in to the icing and even squeezed some of <br/>
the icing onto the cake.  But then dd asked me to play a game.  I <br/>
said that it was getting late and the only way I could play a game <br/>
with her is if she would help me clean up.  She came in once and half <br/>
heartedly wiped a rag over the table, not really doing anything, and <br/>
then went into another room and played around doing something else.  <br/>
I reminded her gently and kindly that if she wants me to have time to <br/>
play her game, she would have to help me.  She came in again for <br/>
maybe 30 seconds and threw a paper towel toward the garbage can, it <br/>
landed on the floor, and she went to do something else.  I finished <br/>
cleaning up all by myself and was too tired (and too annoyed!) to <br/>
play a game by then.  By the time I got the diningroom and kitchen <br/>
recovered from our cake adventure, 2 other rooms were trashed from <br/>
them playing and not cleaning anything up.  I was too tired to clean <br/>
them up, and was really discouraged because of all these people who <br/>
say they just keep up with the mess as soon as it happens and never <br/>
let anything build up.  I had just spent an hour and a half cleaning <br/>
icing off tables and floors and doing dishes, now I was tired and <br/>
needed to do another 2 rooms?  <br/>
<br/>
I told them that it is just rude and inconsiderate of them to treat <br/>
me like their personal maids.  I told them that if they could at <br/>
least put their dishes in the sink and put their things away when <br/>
they&#39;re done with them I would feel so much better.  <br/>
<br/>
And I told them that they were doing things to annoy each other way <br/>
too often, that the level of fighting that we&#39;ve been having is <br/>
causing way too much stress in the house.  I told them that they just <br/>
need to stop constantly doing things that they know are going to <br/>
annoy someone else.  <br/>
<br/>
They said ok, and said that they were sorry that they&#39;ve been <br/>
inconsiderate and that they&#39;d try to contribute more.  I felt much <br/>
better.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we got home, I asked if they could please clean up the <br/>
livingroom so that people can walk through it and there is a <br/>
comfortable place for everyone to sit on the couch, because their <br/>
grandma and grandpa are coming over for big monkey&#39;s birthday party <br/>
and to watch a movie with them.  My 5 year old said, &quot;I won&#39;t&quot;.  I <br/>
just looked at him and said, &quot;That is so rude&quot;.  He looked at me, and <br/>
then joined the other two in cleaning up the livingroom of the at <br/>
least 50 stuffed animals and beanie babies (among other things) that <br/>
they had all over the floor.  <br/>
<br/>
So, did I mess up? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s do this:  we have NOW a group of 4-5 adults who are staying up late, <br/>
talking loudly, giggling, and generally being a nuisance---while I have to <br/>
get up at 5am to go to the job that&#39;s paying for those ingrates to live in my <br/>
house, eat the food I provide, and play all day.<br/>
<br/>
All adults here! No kids. We&#39;re all, say---32 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Whose rights come first?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine asking MY boys to be quiet and having them NOT be quiet. It&#39;s <br/>
plain and simple consideration and respect for someone they love very much. <br/>
Why WOULDN&#39;T they stop being monkeys?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an &quot;all or nothing&quot; scenario. But there&#39;s GOT to be consideration <br/>
shown to the man who is working to keep them happy. WHY wouldn&#39;t they honor <br/>
him by being quieter? THAT&#39;S the bigger question!<br/>

Should we all have to do everything of which we&#39;re capable?<br/>
<br/>
I COULD get a chair and climb up to the top shelf.  I am 49 years olf and <br/>
more than capable of getting to the top shelf.  But I live with three people <br/>
taller than I am, and it&#39;s easier and safer to ask them.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone in this house is fully capable of doing laundry, but I do it best <br/>
and without any thought or effort.<br/>
<br/>
I am fully capable of changing a tire, but if my husband is there he will <br/>
offer to change it for me, because he doesn&#39;t have to think through the <br/>
steps, and he&#39;s stronger than I am.<br/>

Something was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I told them that it is just rude and inconsiderate of them to treat <br/>

They were treating you like their mom.<br/>
Have they ever HAD personal maids?<br/>

No matter what you said after that, you said they made you sick.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, did I mess up? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think so.<br/>
<br/>
I think staying home, leaving later, maybe you going for a drive to cool down <br/>
and to bring donuts back to the house, would have been more peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
The lol here disturbed me:<br/>
<br/>
-=- My daughter looked at me really weird and <br/>
said, &quot;Mommy, what is wrong?&quot; lol<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
She was probably a little afraid.  And she was communicating.  And she was <br/>
being compassionate.   <br/>
And obviously something was wrong.  Wrong enough for them to get a huge <br/>
lecture.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true people get frustrated and express themselves, but if the stress <br/>
level in the house is really too high, you neither lowered it nor showed them <br/>
a good way to respond when stressed.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;re able to get to a calmer place and apologize to them.  <br/>

&gt; authoritarian?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it is.  <br/>
<br/>
I think those whose husbands don&#39;t want to homeschool might end up having <br/>
their kids in school.<br/>
<br/>
Those whose husbands don&#39;t want to unschool might end up using lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Those whose husbands won&#39;t agree to loosen bedtime rules might end up <br/>
divorced.<br/>
<br/>
Because somehow (in many small steps over time) I figured out how to help my <br/>
husband love the idea of unschooling, and because (in small steps over time) <br/>
he came to be okay with the kids being up late and sleeping late, I have the <br/>
luxury of having those conditions in my home.<br/>
<br/>
If a person doesn&#39;t have that luxury yet, then they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing we can say here to change the reality that it takes small <br/>
steps to get from one place to another.<br/>
<br/>
From time to time newer unschoolers complain to the older ones.  They say <br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve left my kids alone for a month and they&#39;re bored and boring.  You said <br/>
your kids were interesting.  Mine aren&#39;t.  I guess I can&#39;t unschool.&quot;  Or <br/>
they say &quot;MY kids eat candy for hours and watch TV without blinking until <br/>
their eyes dry up and turn to powder.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t see their kids from here.  We don&#39;t know how they interact.  They <br/>
can&#39;t see ours.  They get angry with us.  I don&#39;t like people being angry <br/>
with me.  I&#39;m not sure what to do about this, but the past week has been a <br/>
festival of misunderstandings and resentments, it seems.   <br/>
<br/>
And so if a parent comes here and says &quot;my spouse is angry because I&#39;m doing <br/>
THIS,&quot; I have to say &quot;Then don&#39;t do that.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t guarantee that everybody can unschool within thirty days of finding <br/>
this list or the forum.  We can let the ideas flow, which they do, week in <br/>
and week out.  We can tweak and question and encourage.   But we can&#39;t <br/>
enforce or change their in-home conditions.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to live without being authoritarian.  But the parents have to <br/>
agree to a large extent for it to even BEGIN to work, because no kid needs to <br/>
be the victim of one parent berating the other, or berating the child, over <br/>
bedtimes or food or anything else.<br/>
<br/>
The near-constant suggestions about loosening controls on food and schedules <br/>
and tv are for the purpose of AVOIDING kids being shamed and berated.  Not to <br/>
bait someone into starting divorce procedings.<br/>
<br/>
When someone comes here assuring us that something is NOT working and WILL <br/>
NOT WORK at their house, then they should simply stop trying it.  They should <br/>
do what they need to do to maintain their families.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t work <br/>
if someone breaks up a family to try to obtain it.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will not get it.  That&#39;s got to be okay, or we set people up for <br/>
failure by even telling them it&#39;s a possible option.<br/>

&gt; authoritarian?  (And I&#39;m genuinely asking, not picking a fight)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Though Sandra I think admitted it was authoritarian, I think it gets to the<br/>
essence of when it&#39;s okay to set limits and when it&#39;s not. The limits thing<br/>
is tough to discuss because most parents come with a huge repetoire of<br/>
boundaries that the kids need to adhere to. The problem is recognizing what<br/>
are real boundaries and what are arbitrary boundaries set up to make life<br/>
easier for the parent.<br/>
<br/>
This particular dad needing to get up at 6 and needing 8 hours of sleep (or<br/>
whatever the numbers were) for work is a real life limitation. It could mean<br/>
the difference between having and/or enjoying a job or not. Adults wanting<br/>
alone time every evening with each other is arbitrary. There are other<br/>
solutions for that that won&#39;t be one person deciding their needs are greater<br/>
than another&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But then dd asked me to play a game.  I<br/>
&gt; said that it was getting late and the only way I could play a game<br/>
&gt; with her is if she would help me clean up.  She came in once and half<br/>
&gt; heartedly wiped a rag over the table, not really doing anything, and<br/>
&gt; then went into another room and played around doing something else.<br/>
&gt; I reminded her gently and kindly that if she wants me to have time to<br/>
&gt; play her game, she would have to help me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were upset that she didn&#39;t come in to help, then were you really<br/>
asking? If you were asking, yes or no would have been both acceptable<br/>
answers. If yes, you would have the energy to play. If no, you wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Look at it this way, if you were somewhere and needed to clean up and your<br/>
daughter wanted to get home to see a TV show and you knew that you weren&#39;t<br/>
going to have time to clean up without her help to get her home on time, if<br/>
she chose not to help, would you be angry? It would be her choice not to get<br/>
home on time. It was her choice not to help in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
(Of course it depends on the age too. Expecting a 5yo or maybe even a 10yo<br/>
who has been coerced into doing chores to grasp what tired and time looks<br/>
like from an adult point of view is asking a lot.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this felt different because you knew you could physically play the<br/>
game. It felt somewhat arbitrary to say if I finish at 9 we can play, but if<br/>
I finish at 9:15 we can&#39;t. This is a balance thing. It&#39;s learning to be more<br/>
objective about your daughter&#39;s needs and about what your real needs are<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
But perhaps, if you know her help doesn&#39;t really cut much out of the effort<br/>
the task takes -- and include in there her companionship and effort if she&#39;s<br/>
truly interested in helping even if her help doesn&#39;t make the task go any<br/>
faster, a better offer would have been doing it in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kind of along these lines, I lost it with my kids this morning.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been feeling edgy for the last few days because of their behavior and<br/>
&gt; continuous refusal to help me do much of anything, and this morning I<br/>
&gt; just felt like I didn&#39;t even want to get out of bed and deal with<br/>
&gt; them.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your anger is all about control. You want them to be a certain way and I<br/>
think you&#39;re expecting to be able to use some technique to turn them into<br/>
what you want them to be.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s about them wanting not to be controlled. So right now when you ask<br/>
them to help, it&#39;s going to seem like you&#39;re making them help. Especially if<br/>
you&#39;ve used asking when no wasn&#39;t really an acceptable answer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about your relationship with them. I think you&#39;re really feeling that<br/>
mom and child division, where it&#39;s your job to get them to live the right<br/>
way. So try to turn that on it&#39;s head and see yourself as their partner.<br/>
They are where they are and your job is to help them get where they want to<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than trying to change them, how about being the person you want them<br/>
to be? I&#39;m sure you are in many ways, but you&#39;re doing it from your point of<br/>
view. When you think you&#39;re being generous, it probably more often looks<br/>
like you doing something you want to do (like making the cake. Even if they<br/>
notice how long it takes, they have no concept of how much work it<br/>
involves.) Do you want them to hold in their feelings and blow up in order<br/>
to get people to do what you want them to do? (This shouldn&#39;t really be<br/>
about the cleaning, though. You should see the househould tasks as yours.<br/>
Ask for help, certainly, but they&#39;re yours. That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t help<br/>
them figure out ways to make what you want to do easier. Like having bins to<br/>
throw things into. The more they come to see that you own the chores and<br/>
that you really are asking for their help and appreciate anything they can<br/>
do to help, the more they&#39;ll be likely to help.) How about observing them<br/>
when they&#39;re doing something and asking if they need help with something?<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you want them to do that? How about sitting down with them when<br/>
they&#39;re playing just to be in their company? Wouldn&#39;t that be really sweet<br/>
if they did that? How about noticing the less noticable times when someone<br/>
might need a hug and giving them a hug?<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t solve everything, but at the heart of the tension you&#39;re feeling<br/>
in your relationship is the control thing. And it&#39;s about boundaries too.<br/>
You can&#39;t expect them to understand your boundaries and meet your needs. But<br/>
you have to be atuned to what they&#39;re needs are too. Mom&#39;s need sleep but<br/>
insisting that an infant set aside its needs so Mom can sleep is<br/>
unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
(This is *really* hard to explain! So maybe some place in there was<br/>
something that might help.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; being able to control themselves?  &quot;You have been given many chances<br/>
&gt; to keep quiet after your dad went to bed and you continually blew it,<br/>
&gt; so now I&#39;m going to insist on an arbitrary bedtime&quot;.  Isn&#39;t this<br/>
&gt; authoritarian?  (And I&#39;m genuinely asking, not picking a fight) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The quoted part is not a quote of what I wrote.<br/>
I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; <br/>
Just tell them you need them to go to bed by ten, that maybe when they&#39;re <br/>
older and able to be quiet you can extend it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the children honestly can&#39;t even try to be quiet, then it&#39;s too soon in <br/>
their lives to give them the freedom.  Children given freedom earlier or more <br/>
gradually ease into it.  Those given freedom all of a sudden sometimes seem <br/>
to hoot and holler and jump on the couch and eat all the candy, according to <br/>
many reports and general experience.<br/>
<br/>
If instead of easing into relaxation of bedtime restrictions someone says <br/>
&quot;Stay up all night, we don&#39;t care&quot; but the dad DOES care, then communications <br/>
are bad.  If things aren&#39;t evolving naturally and honestly, it&#39;s not growth, <br/>
it&#39;s chaos.<br/>
<br/>
If things are going well with transition, there&#39;s no reason to re-instutite <br/>
any rules.  If things truly aren&#39;t going well and no solution is in sight <br/>
other than more disrespect and stress and possibly fighting or divorce, go <br/>
back to the beginning and start where you were and try the transition another <br/>
way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think you&#39;re expecting to be able to use some technique to turn <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them into<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what you want them to be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And it&#39;s about them wanting not to be controlled. So right now when <br/>
 </span></blockquote>you ask<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them to help, it&#39;s going to seem like you&#39;re making them help. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Especially if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you&#39;ve used asking when no wasn&#39;t really an acceptable answer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sigh...You&#39;re right.  And it does make me sad that I lost it.  We <br/>
WERE &quot;getting it&quot;.  Things had been going so well.  <br/>
<br/>
When I sat down and evaluated it, I don&#39;t think it was about me <br/>
needing them to help more, but about me feeling like I was inadequate <br/>
to keep up with them.  <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I had developed an asthma-like cough.  I had been <br/>
feeling so overwhelmed and had been keeping it in for awhile, because <br/>
I wanted this to work so badly. The cough developed gradually, got at <br/>
it&#39;s worst point on the day when I yelled at my kids.   The next day, <br/>
when I started to deal with my feelings of inadequacy and feeling <br/>
overwhelmed, the cough got much better and today it&#39;s almost gone.  <br/>
This feeling of being overwhelmed that I had was so intense that it <br/>
affected my breathing.   <br/>
<br/>
The fact is that I struggle with the cleaning issue a LOT.  I <br/>
constantly reflect on it and try to put it in perspective.  Some days <br/>
I put it in perspective really well and some days I totally can&#39;t <br/>
handle it.  <br/>
<br/>
People on this list have said that their houses don&#39;t look like <br/>
tornadoes have gone through them.  If that&#39;s true, I don&#39;t understand <br/>
how they do it.  If I give my kids the time that they really want <br/>
from me, I am busy with them practically all day with little time <br/>
left over to do much cleaning. That little bit of extra time I get <br/>
seems to go the computer discussing unschooling. :).  I&#39;m not talking <br/>
about little messes here and there, I&#39;m talking about huge messes, <br/>
starting at one end of the house and going to another.  Just as I&#39;m <br/>
straightening up from one activity, someone will need me for <br/>
something else and I&#39;m forced to choose between straightening up and <br/>
meeting a human need.  <br/>
<br/>
I hear people saying that they just straighten up one mess as soon as <br/>
they&#39;re done playing with something.  They make it sound so easy.  <br/>
That might work with one kid, but with three, who are constantly <br/>
doing three different things at the same time?   As I&#39;m straightening <br/>
up one mess, two more messes are made.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that maybe it&#39;s just because my kids are still young--<br/>
they&#39;re 9, 5, and 3.  <br/>
<br/>
And I get really confused that people are able to do spend so much <br/>
time on the computer discussing stuff and still keep up with their <br/>
kids and their kids&#39; messes.  Again, maybe because my kids are <br/>
younger.  But I have realized that I&#39;m not going to be able to <br/>
continue being this mom I want to be if I keep sitting down at the <br/>
computer so often.  I&#39;m going to need to cut back my computer time <br/>
way back so that I&#39;m able to spend time keeping up with them.  I just <br/>
have to face the fact that others might be able to do it, but I can&#39;t <br/>
at this point in our life.  And I&#39;m blessed that I have such great, <br/>
active kids that are keeping me so busy that I have time for little <br/>
else. <br/>
<br/>
My kids are cool.  They&#39;re interesting and incredibly creative kids.  <br/>
They&#39;re full of energy and come up with all kinds of neat ideas all <br/>
the time.  Creative kids make big messes sometimes.  They require me <br/>
to put huge amounts of energy and time into them.  I&#39;m incredibly <br/>
blessed to have them and I&#39;m incredibly dedicated to being the best <br/>
possible unschoooling mommy for them.  But after a whole lot of <br/>
evaluation of this last blow-up of mine, I&#39;m realizing that I need to <br/>
give the computer time a break if I&#39;m going to avoid getting <br/>
overwhelmed again.  There is only so much time in a day and I have to <br/>
prioritize. <br/>
<br/>
This list has changed my life!  Thank you so much to all of you who <br/>
have helped me so much. I love it and could spend hours a day on it. <br/>
But for now, in order to follow all of your great advice, I just <br/>
sense that I need to leave it for awhile. Make sense?  I&#39;ll still pop <br/>
in from time to time (I read messages on the yahoo site, not by <br/>
email).  <br/>

house looked like a tornado hit and that it was OK.  But I think when I was <br/>
saying this it was in the heat of the moment.  Just after we had finished a <br/>
major house renovation project and was feeling a little helpless.  I look <br/>
around right now and It isn&#39;t that bad.  I few toys out a few dishes in the <br/>
sink.  The carpet needs to see the vacuum and a few book here and there but <br/>
not disaster.  Or maybe my perception of clean has changed.<br/>
I pick up as I go.  If I am headed toward the kitchen I take a few dishes <br/>
with me.  If I see all the G. I. Joes out and they haven&#39;t been played with <br/>
for a few days I toss them back in their basket.  They might not make it back <br/>
to the family room but they are in the plastic tub and not all over the <br/>
floor.  <br/>

<br/>
All around the burner was heavy grease from Keith and Marty cooking <br/>
hamburgers in a skillet.<br/>
<br/>
For half a second I was angry that they didn&#39;t clean it up, and then I just <br/>
got a hot rag and cleaned it up, thinking how much easier that was on me than <br/>
if I had gone up and made them dinner last night.  That would have brought me <br/>
to tears, I was so sick.  But this morning I felt better and cleaned up that <br/>
mess in about thirty seconds.<br/>

<br/>
You could put your kids in school, let teachers meet their human needs, and <br/>
clean house for five or six hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could meet human needs first ALWAYS and let your house wait until your <br/>
children are older and don&#39;t need you.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing to homeschool always means you&#39;ll have about a school&#39;s worth of <br/>
extra stuff in your house, and kids there all the time.  Keeping a clean <br/>
house at the sake of anyone&#39;s peace or sanity is too expensive for my tastes.<br/>

cleaning paid just as well but didn&#39;t take up my Friday nights.<br/>

you sew or play piano, could you give lessons in trade for dusting or<br/>
something?   Could you work a deal with another mom for a few hours a<br/>
week to take your kid while you clean and then you take hers?<br/>
<br/>
Does your husband help you?  Can you talk to him about maybe getting more<br/>
help from him?  If he&#39;s not willing to help tell him you&#39;re hiring<br/>
someone three days a week.  It would be worth it for your sanity. <br/>
Really, truly worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there things you could do to make clean up easier?  Cupboards or bins<br/>
you could buy for each room where you could get things out of your way in<br/>
a hurry?<br/>
<br/>
OR, can you get past that thing that says your house has to be clean?  <br/>
Just do the basics and let the rest go until your kids are bigger and<br/>
don&#39;t need you with them all the time.   You will have too much time to<br/>
clean when they&#39;ve gone from you.  <br/>
  <br/>
***I&#39;m talking about huge messes, <br/>
starting at one end of the house and going to another.***<br/>
<br/>
This might be the difference in how people perceive *mess*. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
We all have different comfort levels.   Your mess might just be what my<br/>
house looks like every day!<br/>
Right now there is a card table in the spare room with a lego castle on<br/>
it and dragons and catapults.  There is a stack of books and videos on<br/>
the hide-a-bed and a bag of fabric I&#39;m sorting and cutting up for rugs.  <br/>
There&#39;s a half finished puzzle on the dining room table and a microscope<br/>
and a platter of rhinoceros beetles.<br/>
There&#39;s a load of laundry in the dryer, not folded, one in the washer<br/>
waiting for the dryer, dishes in the sink and water color paintings<br/>
drying on the kitchen table.  There is the beginnings of a ship in a<br/>
bottle on the coffee table.  I have a very small house.  At the moment it<br/>
looks really messy, and it probably will all day. <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m thinking that maybe it&#39;s just because my kids are still young--<br/>
they&#39;re 9, 5, and 3.***<br/>
<br/>
That is very young.  And when they&#39;re grown they&#39;ll tell people about all<br/>
the fun they had being creative as children.   Those make much better<br/>
stories than how they had to keep the house clean!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***And I get really confused that people are able to do spend so much <br/>
time on the computer discussing stuff and still keep up with their <br/>
kids and their kids&#39; messes.  ***<br/>
<br/>
I get up at three thirty in the morning.&lt;g&gt;  I wait until Dylan has<br/>
company, or is busy outside, or is visiting a friend and then I read<br/>
here.  Or, I read in the evenings when he&#39;s watching a movie.  I work my<br/>
computer time around his schedule.   It is harder with more kids.   In<br/>
the summer I have my nieces and nephews and my time to read and post is<br/>
limited.  <br/>

<br/>
And  when they come to visit you because they have SUCH fond memories of the <br/>
time you spent with them, they&#39;ll be impressed by how neat and clean your <br/>
house is!<br/>
<br/>
If you irritate them too much now by choosing cleaning over them, they might <br/>
not be as eager to come and visit your irritatingly clean house when they&#39;re <br/>
grown.<br/>
