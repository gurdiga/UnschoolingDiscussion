GOOD IDEA!<br/>

I LOVE those.  I just got the special edition DVD of Monty Python and the <br/>
Holy Grail, and there&#39;s some &quot;making of&quot; stuff.  VERY COOL!  In the black <br/>
knight &quot;none shall pass&quot; scene, in one part it&#39;s a one-legged man they hired <br/>
(for the one remaining leg scene) and when they cut that last leg off, it&#39;s a <br/>
full-sized marionette!<br/>

&gt; time he was 4.  As long as your children understand that it is<br/>
