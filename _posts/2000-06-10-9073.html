&gt;It&#39;s been wonderful hearing about all of you.  Thought I&#39;d share too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why do you un/home school?  I am a teacher by profession (actually I never<br/>
&gt;went beyond getting my degree and doing my student teaching) and what I saw<br/>
&gt;the children experience in class made me realize that I would never want<br/>
&gt;that experience for my child.  There are great teachers out there, but the<br/>
&gt;institution of school is not (in my opinion) healthy for kids.  I also<br/>
&gt;really enjoy spending time with him, learning together and having fun.  We<br/>
&gt;would miss out on so much if he was at school most of the day.  The other<br/>
&gt;part that concerns me is the peer experience, where his peers (mainly) <br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt;be teaching him how to relate to others...I think a mix of ages is better<br/>
&gt;for teaching social skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What&#39;s your child&#39;s age?  I have one son, Nick, who is five.  He is really<br/>
&gt;into anything having to do with space exploration.  Yesterday we had a <br/>
&gt;great<br/>
&gt;time making a space buggy and star light-catcher.  He is also really into<br/>
&gt;knights and swords.  He, like some of the other little boys descibed on <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;list, is into Pajama Sam games, majicians and carrying special treasures in<br/>
&gt;his pockets!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Where do you live?<br/>
&gt;We live in Olympia, Washington.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are you satisfied with the HS laws in the state?  Yes.  As I understand it,<br/>
&gt;Washington has some of the most liberal homeschooling laws.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other information:  We attend, not as often as I would like, the Unitarian<br/>
&gt;Universalist church in our area and really enjoy it.  I enjoy gardening and<br/>
&gt;knitting.  My husband works in the environmental field.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Looking foward to getting to know you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722673575">Why do you un/home school?  <br/>
Simply that we want our children to continue love to learn regardless of the<br/>
content of the knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your child&#39;s age?  <br/>
Daughters 3 and 6<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?<br/>
Fort Worth, TX<br/>
<br/>
Are you satisfied with the HS laws in the state?<br/>
As I understand them, yes, except I would like them to drop the named<br/>
specific areas of study.<br/>
<br/>
Other information:  <br/>
We are some of the isolated few here that homeschool for non-religious<br/>
reasons. The only church I might consider is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://church.freethought.org/.">http://church.freethought.org/.</a><br/>
I watched with sadness as my then-5-year-old became a different person in<br/>
kindergarten and the spark in her eyes fade. Within two weeks of finishing<br/>
for the summer, she is back to her young self -- full of enthusiasm and<br/>
yearning for knowledge. Our home life is now much more harmonious and we are<br/>
once again parenting more by example than by the carrot and stick. I don&#39;t<br/>
like the term unschooling because it sounds anti-schooling (which I am, but<br/>
why antagonize the pro-schoolers). I like Natural Learning or Interest-led<br/>
learning. None of our extended families supports our decision, but parenting<br/>
is not a popularity contest. It is the right thing for us and I figure I<br/>
only have a few years to impact the rest of my children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you are in my neck of the woods, I&#39;d love to meet you. We also<br/>
belong to Tarrant Home Educators Association, a wonderful group.</div>
