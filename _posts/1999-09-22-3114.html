<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305474328">Jill, you wrote about your transcription work and I&#39;m curious about how you <br/>
get business.  I&#39;ve typed some for a friend of mine who&#39;s a psychologist and <br/>
for a friend who publishes a magazine, but it&#39;s not steady.  Do you <br/>
specialize in any particular area?  I wonder if I should be privately <br/>
e-mailing you...<br/>

&lt;&lt; Jill, you wrote about your transcription work and I&#39;m curious about how <br/>

<br/>
Maybe it is homeschool related.  I know that my job has enabled me to stay at <br/>
home, and homeschool, and still make money, so I&#39;ll share here.  I do legal <br/>
transcription.  I work for one person who has a couple of us doing the <br/>
typing.  He gets the work from the courts on tape, sets it up, and gives it <br/>
to me to type up.  Then I return the finished work on diskette and he takes <br/>
care of printing it out in final and forwarding it to the right people.  For <br/>
what I do, I get paid $1.25 per page for Federal Court work.  When we have a <br/>
rush job, or corporate work, I can make more.  He does keep me busy though.  <br/>
I average about $150 per week, which is WAY less than I made working in a law <br/>
office, but the payoff is that I can work from home and make my own hours.  <br/>
It&#39;s also a good education for the children -- they hear what goes on in <br/>
courtrooms, they help me relisten sometimes, and they see what it&#39;s like to <br/>
run a business from home.  <br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
