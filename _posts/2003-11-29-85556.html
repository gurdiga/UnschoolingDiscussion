<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799403094">I &quot;came clean&quot; and finally told my mother that we&#39;re homeschooling. <br/>
In some ways it was both better and worse than I thought it would be. <br/>
She doesn&#39;t agree with it, but said she&#39;d be willing to learn more <br/>
about it and agreed to read through any websites or articles I&#39;d like <br/>
her to read through. <br/>
<br/>
The rest of it though..ended up basically being an attack on my <br/>
husband and lecture ending with yet another plea from her for me to <br/>
divorce my husband. SIGH. Oh well. At least she knows the truth now. <br/>
