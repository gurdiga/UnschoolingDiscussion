<div id="ygrps-yiv-12781876">We recently watched A League of Their Own, featuring Tom Hanks.  I rented<br/>
this because my 7yod loves to play baseball and I thought she&#39;d enjoy this<br/>
movie about women&#39;s baseball in the 40&#39;s.  She did.  We also watched The<br/>
Rookie, starring the man who was the dad in the latest version of the Parent<br/>
Trap, so he was familiar to the girls, and I think that helped them enjoy<br/>
the movie more.<br/>
<br/>
I saw Catch Me if You Can with my mom, and am planning to rent it soon for<br/>
family viewing, but want to get it when I know dh will have time to watch it<br/>
with us.  Hanks is in that one too.  So is Leonardo DiCaprio, and he is very<br/>
good in it.  So we had to watch What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape.  DiCaprio is<br/>
fantastic in that one!  We watched Forrest Gump, starring Hanks, and all<br/>
loved it.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we grabbed Sleepless in Seattle (Hanks again) at the library and<br/>
watched it this morning.  Ahh, unschooling!  I&#39;d like to thank, again, all<br/>
the people who spoke in favor of tv/movies and all the ways that we can<br/>
learn from them.<br/>
<br/>
We are enjoying seeing actors/resses in various movies, comparing their<br/>
acting, etc.  Looking for familiar landmarks in movies that are filmed in<br/>
places we&#39;ve been.  Compare/contrast movies with the books, when we&#39;ve<br/>
experinced both.  Finding connections in movies to other things we&#39;ve<br/>
experienced.  Looking for mistakes.  Lisa noticed that &quot;Annie&quot; turned off<br/>
the light to go to sleep with a glass of wine sitting at the bottom of the<br/>
bed.  Maybe this was intentional, but I&#39;m guessing someone forgot to have<br/>
her put it on the nightstand first, or they edited out that part.  Did you<br/>
know that it is someone&#39;s job to watch for stuff like this and make sure<br/>
that it doesn&#39;t get into the final movie?  (There is your occupational<br/>
education lesson for the day :-)<br/>

<br/>
Continuity?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We recently watched A League of Their Own, featuring Tom Hanks.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of our currently-here Netflix movies which are sitting quietly <br/>
while the kids are off camping.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I saw Catch Me if You Can with my mom, and am planning to rent it soon for<br/>
<br/>
family viewing, but want to get it when I know dh will have time to watch it<br/>
<br/>
with us.  Hanks is in that one too.  So is Leonardo DiCaprio, and he is very<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
My boys have seen Catch Me if you Can and RAVED about it.<br/>
<br/>
Leonardo DeCaprio is wonderful in What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape.<br/>
Unfortunately he reeks in Man in the Iron Mask (not always, but enough for me <br/>
to be embarrassed for him, his mom, the director, his agent...).<br/>
He did passable-to-good in Romeo+Juliet, I think.<br/>
<br/>
For Tom Hanks, I recommend Big (and old one) and Cast Away (not so old).<br/>
