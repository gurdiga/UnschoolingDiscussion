&gt; Same here.  The school at home conferences are a sea of deni jumpers<br/>
&gt; out here.<br/>
&gt;  I am<br/>
&gt; currently wearing a tie die tank dress and my Birks.<br/>
&gt; I always prided myself on being the unschooler I knew of who did not<br/>
&gt; wear Birkies- until I started having arch problems. :-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t wear jumpers at all. Haven&#39;t owned one since I was 6 and mom made<br/>
&gt; them for me. What is it about jumpers and homeschoolers anyway??? I also<br/>
&gt; have never had on a pair of Birks. Maybe that&#39;s why Tara says I don&#39;t look<br/>
&gt; like a mom!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m afraid I would look like a Denim Sausage in one. I do wear Birkenstocks, <br/>
with socks when it&#39;s cold now even. <br/>
