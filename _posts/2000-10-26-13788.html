<div id="ygrps-yiv-912586263">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t exactly call myself depression, but I have some bad days.<br/>
It&#39;s hard enough in this society to be a at home Mom of a small child,<br/>
let alone a school age child.  Society just doesn&#39;t value what Mom&#39;s<br/>
do.  Some days I have a hard time looking back on my day and seeing it&#39;s<br/>
value but then I remember that I&#39;m using the wrong yard stick and<br/>
realize how important what I&#39;m doing is when I look at my six year old<br/>
son and realize how much he&#39;s discovered today.  I&#39;m working at doing<br/>
projects along with him as he doesn&#39;t need me in the same intense way<br/>
that he did when he was younger.  I also try and find an outing for us<br/>
every day partly because I need to see some grown ups and also it&#39;s just<br/>
a new place to explore.  I like to spend some times outdoors every day<br/>
as well.  I think sometimes we are so busy meeting our child(ren)&#39;s<br/>
needs that we forget about our own.<br/>

This is very well said.  We are important not only to our children but to<br/>
all the others in their future.<br/>
It is hard to be a stay at home Mom of homeschooled children, but just<br/>
because I want or need to gripe occasionally doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m doubting my<br/>
choice to homeschool.<br/>
And..... this is from a Mom who has been diagnosed and still deals with<br/>
depression.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381323911">I have a hard time somtimes letting go of the bookwork.  Though I&#39;m trying<br/>
very hard.  Being a product of ps & a parent that taught in ps that&#39;s very<br/>
hard at times.  But I know they&#39;re (7,4 & 2) learning lots without the<br/>
bookwork.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday the men came to replace our screen over our pool.  The kids had<br/>
great fun & lots of questions.  The two men were very patient with the kids<br/>
answering all their questions.  After a while, one of the men asked Katheine<br/>
why she wasn&#39;t in school.  She told him she was, today he was her school<br/>
work.  That led to a explanation of homeschooling with lots of questions<br/>
from them both.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503944112">&quot;No feelings hurt here! You are absolutely right. About 3 weeks ago I started <br/>
taking Zoloft. It was my inability to be there for my kids that made me step <br/>
out and get some help. I feel like I&#39;m finally coming awake after a year of <br/>
being in an emotional coma.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Elissa!! I am so sorry, I had no idea.....wish you lived closer. I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re feeling better, depression sucks.<br/>
