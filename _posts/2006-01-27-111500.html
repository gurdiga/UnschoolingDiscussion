<div id="ygrps-yiv-877811429">I have been following the thread about one family member not wanting <br/>
to go somewhere with great interest. There have been alot of great <br/>
things shared, which I printed out for myself to re-read and re-read <br/>
as needed.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I have a question for you all about what to do when you have an <br/>
older child that chooses to go somewhere with you that he really <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go, because he would rather not stay home alone. My <br/>
son is 14yo and often does this. He&#39;s not always interested in doing <br/>
what my 9yo and 6yo want to do, but then he doesn&#39;t have any idea <br/>
what he wants to do either. I have printed up lists of ideas from <br/>
the discussions here, and some of our own ideas, and I suggest them <br/>
to him, and he usually says no. My younger ones are usually saying <br/>
yes, but can be swayed by older son&#39;s no too. The problem comes when <br/>
older son comes with us and then  will say, &quot;I didn&#39;t even want to <br/>
come.&quot; He complains and sometimes starts teasing the other kids, <br/>
just giving them hard time.<br/>
<br/>
I am the only parent home most days, so I can&#39;t split the kids up, <br/>
but on the occasions I can, I have taken my older son out by <br/>
himself. We also go to playgrounds with skateparks often, so he can <br/>
do what he likes and the younger ones have stuff that they like too. <br/>
If my older son wants to go to a skateshop, I bring him and the <br/>
younger ones have to go along with us. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s old enough to be alone, but I feel guilty leaving him alone, <br/>
because we&#39;re out having fun, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s having fun at <br/>
home. He&#39;s bored at home. He&#39;s said as much. But then, on the other <br/>
hand, he doesn&#39;t really want to do whatever the younger ones want <br/>
either, kwim?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I explained the situation well enough, but there it <br/>
is. What do you think?<br/>
