&lt;&lt; Ummm.....speaking of gaps.<br/>
 I&#39;m 37 and I don&#39;t know that I have *learned* about inertia yet. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m a few years younger, but SAME HERE!!<br/>
Oh well.<br/>
And guess what? I just watched  &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; for the first time in my <br/>
life today!!! Wow, what was I waiting for?<br/>
Now I want to know the whole story about the VonTrapp family? Were these real <br/>
people? Did they really escape Germany occupied Austria? Was this based on <br/>
them or just a fiction musical?<br/>
Wow, wow , wow....the brain cells are all fired up now!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999757923">Oh, my! Sound of Music was my first favorite movie when <br/>
I was 5 or 6. Absolutely loved it, still do. There are <br/>
several autobiographies and biographies at Amazon; I <br/>
would recommend the ones by Maria Von Trapp herself. The <br/>
actress who played Liesl is currently capitalizing on <br/>
that as well; she&#39;s got a couple of books out.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.trappfamily.com/history.html">http://www.trappfamily.com/history.html</a><br/>
