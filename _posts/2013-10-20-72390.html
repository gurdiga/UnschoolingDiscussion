<div></div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div style="">&gt;&gt;&nbsp;My daughter in particular is very sensitive to being told to do or not to do anything.&lt;&lt;</div>
 </span></blockquote><div style="">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="">I wonder if part of the problem is they Way you&#39;re telling her - because from what you describe, you&#39;re not so&nbsp;much saying no as trying to explain why what she wants to do isn&#39;t a good idea right now, which could be pretty annoying from her perspective. In a way, it&#39;s worse than saying no, it&#39;s saying &quot;what you think and feel and desire isn&#39;t as important as blah blah blah blah blah&quot;. From her perspective, you&#39;re trying to teach her to make the decisions you want her to make. </div>
<div style="">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div style="">&gt;&gt;My kids often insist they can do anything they want and that I (or someone else) can&#39;t tell them what to do. &nbsp;This makes me think they are either feeling controlled or that I have led them to believe this is true and have failed to exercise appropriate authority.&lt;&lt;</div>
 </span></blockquote><div style="">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="">Or they think they can argue their point with you - which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing! Being little kids, their arguments aren&#39;t going to be super logical and sophisticated, they&#39;re going to take the form of &quot;but I really want to&quot; and &quot;you can&#39;t tell me what to do&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ll kick you if I can&#39;t&quot;. The problem seems more that you&#39;re taking their reactions personally, as some kind of critique of you or your parenting. Instead, see their arguments as a difference of opinion and think about what they want in the moment. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean saying &quot;yes, you&#39;re right&quot; but don&#39;t jump right to explaining how very wrong they are, either. It won&#39;t help anything in the moment. Say &quot;not today&quot; or &quot;next time&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; and move on. </div>
<div style="">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div style="">&gt;&gt;&nbsp;She said it was her tent and she could cut it. &nbsp;I tried to explain why some things are not ok to cut--they can be permanently damaged and can&#39;t be replaced, they are expensive, they have been given as gifts and would upset the gift giver if they are destroyed. &nbsp;She said she should be able to cut up her own things.&lt;&lt;</div>
 </span></blockquote><div style="">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="">She has a point - it&#39;s hers. She wants to improve it. Why the heck would grandma&#39;s feelings be hurt by that? From her perspective, it&#39;s like you&#39;re saying the tent still belongs to grandma,&nbsp;since what grandma wants is so much more important than what she wants.&nbsp;So maybe in the future, &quot;gifts&quot; from grandma need to be clarified a bit - they&#39;re not really gifts, they&#39;re loans or rentals, or gifts to you and you&#39;re letting the kids use them. They&#39;re more like... the family car, or the furniture in your house, or family games and puzzles: they don&#39;t really belong to the kids, and the kids don&#39;t get to make structural decisions about those things.<br><br>But again, it&#39;s not helpful for you to try and convince the kids to agree with your perspective. In fact, when you do that, you diminish their ability to see others&#39; perspectives - why should they care what other people want or like, since those things are always linked to
 personal frustration and disappointment. Instead, commiserate with their perspectives. It sucks that they can&#39;t paly in the mud. It&#39;s a bummer not to be able to improve that almost-perfect toy or game. Take their feelings all the more seriously when the answer is &quot;no&quot;. </div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451848085">I think these situations will become less fraught as your unschooling confidence grows. You&#39;ll use fewer words to convey in a calm and friendly way that you do not want them to play in the mud at a party. After all they had a fantastic time the day before getting muddy to their hearts&#39; content :) At a party it&#39;s not ok, for the reasons you listed above.<br>In the same way, you can state in a calm and succinct way that cutting a hole in the tent will let mosquitoes in, or rain ..... but hey, here&#39;s an old sheet we can use as a tent and cut as we please! You can foresee consequences that a 6 year old can&#39;t. But you can also quickly come up with a creative solution that, in Pam Sorooshian&#39;s words, &#39;fits the purpose&#39; of your child in that moment. I&#39;ve found that skill, of being able to turn on a dime and offer some fun alternative, is very handy for helping unschooling to thrive in my family. It doesn&#39;t always work, and sometimes I can&#39;t summon that creative spark, but most of the time I make a real effort to help my child find a way to carry out their intent.<br>That genuine effort and lighthearted approach, combined with a quiet confidence in what I&#39;m doing, help to keep us all on the same team, so that when I do say no, my kids rarely feel &#39;controlled&#39;. <br><br>Claire<br><p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1451848085ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;vafnord@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1451848085ygrps-yiv-68394489"><p dir="ltr">Saying &quot;no&quot; on the nicest way possible is important.

Some things are a really bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is a pretty common verbal &quot;trick&quot; to couch a &quot;no&quot; inside a monologue that implies that the requestor was wrong to ask in the first place. It adds insult to injury. It&#39;s a defense mechanism-=-<br/>
<br/>
How can a person have a conversation about something that&#39;s a bad idea, then, in this model, without being guilty of all these sins?  I might be misunderstanding what was originally meant, but this seems to be a lot of words to suggest that the mother was wrong in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s totally understandable, and extremely common, but it does not improve relationships. If I&#39;m on defense, I&#39;m not on my child&#39;s team.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what &quot;it&quot; is that is common, understandable but a bad idea, but I don&#39;t think a parent is just on a child&#39;s team.  Is the child the team leader?  If the parent can find a way to be the child&#39;s partner, it&#39;s likely that the parent is still the captain/guide/leader, for being taller and being able to see farther.  For being more experienced and more responsible, the team can be coached toward doing things that are socially acceptable, and kind, and considerate.<br/>
<br/>
The parent and the child are seen as a team, and ideally ARE a team, but that&#39;s not the same as the parent being a helpless supporter of &quot;the child&#39;s team.&quot;<br/>
