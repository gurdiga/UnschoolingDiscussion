<div id="ygrps-yiv-101172914">THAT&#39;S IT, THAT&#39;S IT!!!  ***Dinosaur Valley State Park @ Glen<br/>
Rose/Cleburne*** thanks SO MUCH, Carron and this is perfect timing,<br/>
thanks!!!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to tell you all to take care and have fun w/ your chatter :)<br/>
we&#39;re leaving for Dallas first thing in the morning (IF NOT EARLIER) b/c dd<br/>
is in the early stages of LABOR!!!  YIPPIE but I&#39;m a NeRvOuS WrEcK!!!   dd<br/>
was going to be induced Thurs am but her dr told her today she doesn&#39;t think<br/>
she&#39;ll last that long, so we&#39;re going earlier than we&#39;d planned!!!    I<br/>
reminded dd that I labored w/ her only 4 hrs and ds #2&#39;s labor was a total<br/>
of 45 mins ~&gt; so, we&#39;re all keeping our fingers crossed, hoping and praying<br/>
the expression *like mother/like daughter* will hold true THIS TIME, too!!!<br/>
&lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pris ~&gt; *signing off* for a few while ~~&gt;&gt; next time I post I&#39;ll be either<br/>
Kinsey *Gramby* or Sam&#39;s *Gramby* &lt;SMILES&gt; :))  take care ...<br/>
WARNING: I cannot be help responsible for the above, as apparently my cats<br/>
have learned how to type ...<br/>

&gt; &gt;  btw ... since you are a Dallasonian do you know the name of the<br/>
park/area<br/>
&gt; &gt;  that has the dinosaur tracks located near Dallas???  we wanted to see<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt;  next week but for the LIFE OF ME, I don&#39;t recall the name???  tia :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sure, you&#39;re talking about Dinosaur Valley State Park -- it&#39;s near Glen<br/>
Rose,<br/>
&gt; south of Cleburne.  You can get some information on the park and<br/>
directions<br/>
&gt; to it from the Texas Parks and Rec website:  www.tpwd.state.tx.us.   It is<br/>
&gt; pretty awesome to go down in the river bed and actually walk in the<br/>
footsteps<br/>
&gt; of dinosaurs.  Also in that area is the Rossil Rim Wildlife Center, a<br/>
drive<br/>
&gt; through wild animal park where you get to feed the animals from your car.<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; really like it there.  Try www.fossilrim.com.  But, that&#39;s all about 1 to<br/>
1<br/>
&gt; 1/2 hours south of here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck Grandma!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
