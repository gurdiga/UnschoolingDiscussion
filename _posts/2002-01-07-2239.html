<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122964659">Well, I am 36 and considering that my daughter is nearly 15 I do not <br/>
feel so young.  And if I happen to look young I would have to give <br/>
credit were it is due,  Clairol #5 of coarse. :0)<br/>
<br/>
I am at another computer that is not my regular one, looking at the <br/>
photos w/ this monitor makes my family all look kinda strange...odd <br/>
what a scanner can do to a picture.  I love that my teenage daughter <br/>
took my hand, right before the picture was taken, it is sweet.  I <br/>
must say the pool in the background is not ours, it belongs to my <br/>
SIL, they have a big house with a gorgeous pool and live north of <br/>
Seattle.  We have a big house with a gorgeous garden , and we are <br/>
south of Seattle.  The distance between our houses <br/>
is....uhmmm...good.  I like her well enough but she is a card <br/>
carrying member of the NEA and worse she is a speech therapist, and <br/>
of coarse we have a son that is 9, not reading and has <br/>
a few *missing* sounds, like &quot;sk &quot;and sometime &quot;z&quot; and the <br/>
biggy &quot;th&quot;.  However I have seen his speech improve all on its own.  <br/>
He use to be missing 7 sounds now only 3 and they are improved <br/>
(we do fun tounge twisters and such).  SIL says &quot;the sounds that have <br/>
not come in will not. He needs help now, and if she could only have <br/>
him once or twice a week she could fix the problem&quot;.....UHG!  Thank <br/>
goodness for the distances between our homes.<br/>
 <br/>
My inlaws our all wonderful people that I love and enjoy very much, <br/>
but as my son is getting older and still not reading they are getting <br/>
concerned, I now am feeling concerend about their concern....<br/>
<br/>
I will back up a bit here to explain my dear son.  He is my third <br/>
born, and definatley the sweetest natured of all my children. <br/>
When I had him in a kindergarden class I was told <br/>
to expect the school district would most likely ask to have him put <br/>
on Ridilin(sp?).  No way would I do that to him.  This child plays <br/>
chess, with any willing victim, and loves loves numbers, puzzles, <br/>
wood working, and books on tape.  I know if he where in PS they <br/>
would lable him learning disabled and have him in special ed.  He is <br/>
not and does not need it.  He just needs time.  My problem is in <br/>
explaining this to a family that is very education (in the <br/>
traditional sense) oriented.  I know they are concerend out of love, <br/>
but really what are my options here? <br/>
Put him in school to have his personality ruined?  And most likley <br/>
frustrated w/ reading to the point that he might not even enjoy a <br/>
good story.???Sigh......Besided when he is 25 will anyone at all <br/>
suspect( or even care) that he was a &quot;late reader&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
....Just venting......<br/>
 Thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to try and scan a new picture in w/our garden.  If I can <br/>
get it to work, the scanner that is, you will see a little sweetpea <br/>
standing behind me, that is Elaine (6) and she is can tell you at <br/>
least 90% of the common names of the plants in our garden.  I doubt <br/>
she could do this if she spent 6hrs a day in a classroom.  <br/>

My son, Quinn is 8, also not reading and also missing some sounds. I have a <br/>
theory that when he does read, those sounds will improve. Right now he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know that the word &quot;think&quot; begins with TH. I believe when he sees it <br/>
over and over, he will say it that way too. He is physically capable and <br/>
corrects himself at times.<br/>

My son Jorgen is 12 and still does not have th. I never thought about it too much, as the real problem understanding him is when he gets so excited and talks so fast I can&#39;t understand him. Thinking back, I know he had other missing sounds earlier, but I never thought about it too much. I guess that&#39;s one advantage of not having a helpful professional in our family. :-)<br/>
<br/>
He started reading at somewhere after 9, I think, when he wanted to do things on the computer. Now he reads voraciously, is always going to the library and reminding me to buy him more novels, and he reads a lot on the web. He loves Brian Jacques, C.S. Lewis, Edward Eager, Harry Potter, and also Tom Clancy, Dale Brown, others I can&#39;t think of right now, but anything with **planes**. One daughter is 10, has been reading fluently for a few months, and very pleased with being &quot;self-taught.&quot; Her main impetus for reading was that she wanted to read her dollhouse miniatures catalogs so she could write up wish lists. Both of them would tell people that they didn&#39;t read until they were reading chapter books on their own, which I thought was interesting. Solvij is 7 and is interested in writing/copying words, but not reading.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s so interesting to see what leads them to move into the world of the written word, <br/>
