<div id="ygrps-yiv-920028340">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Samantha mother to Jade 5 and Corbin 2 and<br/>
partener to Stephen. We are young in the unschooling<br/>
groove but loving it.  I am so glad I found my way to<br/>
John Holt. <br/>
<br/>
After a big day of video watching, Jade decided to do<br/>
some work with playdo.  She had made some playdo food<br/>
then she wanted to write a menu. So she asked me how<br/>
to spell a few words.  I spelled them out and she<br/>
wrote the words herself like it was the most natural<br/>
thing in the world. Its amazing to watch the learning<br/>
unfold.  She is learning how to write and read just<br/>
like she has learned to walk, talk, ride a bike, and<br/>
tie her shoes.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to learning from y&#39;all.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Samantha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85126476">Hi Samantha,<br/>
<br/>
It only gets more incredible as they grow. My son and daughter are so <br/>
different and their learning is so unique to themselves... I stand in awe of <br/>
how they are growing up. Welcome to the list!<br/>
