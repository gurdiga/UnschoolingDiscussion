<div id="ygrps-yiv-652907160">Well, guess I&#39;d like to share our day too.  I really enjoying reading<br/>
what others are doing...so,<br/>
We started the day very excited because my 7yr old son lost a tooth<br/>
yesterday, so it was very exciting to find what the tooth fairy had<br/>
brought.  It started with a discussion of why she didn&#39;t take the<br/>
tooth...hee..hee.. (she couldn&#39;t find it!)  Then progressed to how much<br/>
she had brought.  We have just started working with cuisinaire rods, so<br/>
we pulled them out and counted the money with them.  Was a bit over<br/>
their heads, but I think they caught a gleam now and then.  That was<br/>
fun.  Then on to more boring things like barn chores and getting dressed<br/>
ect..  After that Mom had to work on HS newsletter, so kids played<br/>
outside and stopped in to visit Grandma.  Then we read the rest of<br/>
&quot;Remember My Name&quot;  We are studying the cherokee indians with our<br/>
history book club.  Then discussed more about the trail of tears, and<br/>
finished the last few pages about modern cherokee in &quot;If You Lived With<br/>
The Cherokee&quot;.  Then Mom had lunch very late, kids played inside<br/>
(horsey) and then Mom painted their faces like indians.  All had to run<br/>
up to show Grandma (she lives up our driveway.)  Mom worked more on<br/>
newsletter, and son wen to to barn to collect a couple of feathers for<br/>
Mom to put in his hair.  The little peacock feathers looked great!   Dad<br/>
arrived home to painted children with feathers in their hair.  Related<br/>
all the happenings to him, and played war and match game with him.<br/>
Tonight we had problems with our satellite, so we all took turns<br/>
suggesting what to try.  Then caught a great show about Medieval<br/>
Trebechets.  Way cool!!  We logged on to PBS, and found out more, then<br/>
played the destroy the castle game there...Very fun!!  Played until the<br/>
kids could knock down the castle themselves, while Mom made chocolate<br/>
pie.  Of course ate chocolate pie and then it was time for bed.  Had a<br/>
discussion about why those men were wearing skirts  (kilts)  LOL  and<br/>
made a promise we could play more destroy the castle, and look into<br/>
building our own trebechet.<br/>
WHEW!  I&#39;m pooped.  We aren&#39;t always this busy.  Some days, Mom goes to<br/>
the gym, and we read, and that&#39;s about it.<br/>
In the past week and a half we have made masks, painted them, and now<br/>
are going to decorate them.  Learned the best ways to sled.  Are looking<br/>
up science experiments to try, and are starting Miquon math.  Next it&#39;s<br/>
on to Bob books.  Slow and easy.<br/>
Well, this was way long, but it&#39;s life, and we like it.<br/>

We&#39;re thinking about trying to build a table top model!<br/>
We were thinking about a cloth , batting stuffed projectile with lead<br/>
fishing wieghts as a centre (for mass) so nobody gets hurt.<br/>
OOOOoooo....now I&#39;ve got to go to the PBS site!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-985278962">Hey Buzz, do a search on looksmart for trebechet or catapult.  I found so<br/>
much interesting stuff I couldn&#39;t figure out what to print first.  We are<br/>
going to try and build one for our science fair.  There was even one built<br/>
from Brio Mec.  So neat!  The kids are pumped...ok, so are Mom and Dad.  :)<br/>
Here is the url for the brio<br/>
one...<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.infinet.com/~vleonard/trebpage.html">http://www.infinet.com/~vleonard/trebpage.html</a><br/>
Have fun!<br/>
