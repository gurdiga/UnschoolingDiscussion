<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657027455">This isn&#39;t the life I want for my son! On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
<br/>
fair to those other kids to give my son straight A&#39;s for his unschooling<br/>
life<br/>
<br/>
and him earn a patch for having a great time. But I want to help him with<br/>
his<br/>
<br/>
goals, and an academic patch is currently one of his goals. What do I do?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Zak was going to Karate and there was the same problem so I asked the Sensei<br/>
(sp?) Master what he did for kids that were either unschooled or<br/>
homeschooled and he said he would think about it and come up an answer.  He<br/>
said that he was thinking about not doing the badges based on reports from<br/>
school but reports from parents.  He&#39;s going to think about it for a little<br/>
longer..<br/>
<br/>
Another thing... I went into Blockbuster which happens to be on the same<br/>
block as the Karate and saw a big sign that said &quot;Bring in a A Report Card<br/>
from School and get a video for free&quot;... So asked &quot;what do you for kids that<br/>
are homeschooled&quot;... 3 of them looked at each other and said &quot;go and get him<br/>
a video if you want&quot; in a very pleasant manner, so we did.<br/>

<br/>
But then  if a child doesn&#39;t have that patch he will resent his parents.<br/>
Another thing the karate school should avoid...<br/>
<br/>
My opinion of Kirby&#39;s behavior or &quot;work&quot; isn&#39;t a factor at his karate school. <br/>
 I&#39;m just transportation and banker.  I&#39;m no other part of the equation.<br/>
