<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025616885">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in Florida, and need to have an evalution done with our 10yo son (in <br/>
lieu of testing).  We have a friend that&#39;s a certified teacher who&#39;s willing <br/>
to do it for us, and I&#39;m hoping there is a &quot;veteran&quot; Florida unschooling <br/>
family out there who may have a form or something that we can go by....I want <br/>
to make sure it says what it&#39;s supposed to, without giving more than is <br/>
required.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>
Linda in FL :)  (who&#39;s hoping someone out there understands what I&#39;m talking <br/>
about LOL)</div>

No forms needed.  Your certified teacher friend just needs to<br/>
identify your child (name, date of birth, address) and state<br/>
&quot;this child has made progress commensurate with his ability.&quot;<br/>
sign his/her name and list their certificate number or however<br/>
they track that certified thing.  Or, at least so I&#39;ve been told<br/>
by a hs mom who is certified and does the evaluations.<br/>
You&#39;re friend can do whatever he/she wishes to determine said<br/>
progress.  I guess they are supposed to review your portfolio,<br/>
but I am not aware of any specific guidelines for that.  I<br/>
personally favor - just talking to your child.  Hopefully, they<br/>
already know him and it doesn&#39;t have to be a big deal for any of<br/>
you.<br/>
