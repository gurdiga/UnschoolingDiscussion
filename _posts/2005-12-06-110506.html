<div id="ygrps-yiv-943592294">On Saturday our family, and thousands of others, gathered downtown to <br/>
watch the demolition of our city&#39;s tallest building.  It was not the <br/>

and saw the building *begin* to sink, then it stopped and the air was <br/>

even in Australia!  Not exactly what Sioux Falls wants to be known for, <br/>

This could begin lots of conversations at your house, as it has at ours: <br/>
demolition &#39;experts&#39;, crumbling foundations, expectations, repurpose of <br/>
old buildings (shoulda become a museum ala city museum in St. Louis), <br/>
Leaning Tower of Pisa, pop culture (already becoming part of our <br/>
vocabulary - my cousin lamented she didn&#39;t want a &quot;zip feed wedding <br/>
cake&quot;)....<br/>
FWIW, I predicted it would remain at a 45 degree angle, but I was off by <br/>
15 degrees -- it&#39;s stuck at 60!<br/>

Here&#39;s the local coverage: <br/>

I like that it might become a descriptor with people who don&#39;t even  <br/>
know what it is someday.   And I love that you were there.  When we  <br/>
saw it on TV I thought &quot;Diana will get to see that!&quot; but it hadn&#39;t  <br/>
occurred to me you might&#39;ve been there when it happened.  What a  <br/>
GREAT story for your kids to be able to tell in thirty or forty  <br/>
years.  (Now too, but there&#39;s a specialness to being able to tell eye  <br/>
witness stories to those who weren&#39;t born then.)<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly reminded me of two stories.  She said once, just  <br/>
trying to make me feel old to be funny, she said &quot;What color was your  <br/>
horse when you were little?&quot;  And I said &quot;grey,&quot; and tried to explain  <br/>
dappled to her.   And she said our friend Brett once asked his mom  <br/>
(for the same sarcastic kind of purpose) what it was like when  <br/>
Tylenol was invented, and she told him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My own memories of my home town seem interesting now that time has  <br/>
passed.  There was only one bridge over the Rio Grande when I was  <br/>
growing up, so when there were parades the whole town was closed down  <br/>
and all through traffic was halted for a long time.  Now there are  <br/>
three bridges.  But when I was younger I knew a guy had been a kid  <br/>
sitting in the back of a wagon and the last wagon over before the  <br/>
only bridge in town was washed away by a flood.  He was stick on the  <br/>
wrong side of the river from his mom for two days.  (He was with his  <br/>
uncle and cousins.)   The one bridge I knew was the replacement for  <br/>
the bridge he had seen wash away in the 1930&#39;s.  I don&#39;t remember his  <br/>
name, but he was a substitute teacher who used to tell great stories  <br/>
if the teacher hadn&#39;t left a lesson, and sometimes even if they had. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Eye witness stuff is so cool.  Holly asked me the other day if I knew  <br/>
anyone who had been at Woodstock, and I said &quot;No, but Ric was...&quot; and  <br/>
she interrupted and finished it enthusiastically:  &quot;Ric saw the  <br/>
Beatles at Shea Stadium.&quot;   Right.  So sometimes it&#39;s even worth  <br/>
reciting who we know who was eye-witness to what.  So Holly can say  <br/>
forever &quot;Hannah and Hayden were there when that big grain tower in  <br/>
North Dakota failed to collapse.&quot;<br/>
