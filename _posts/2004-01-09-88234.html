<div id="ygrps-yiv-774625287">I am not sure who was asking. In our town of Attleboro Mass this is <br/>
how it works. We write a letter of intent with our cirriculum <br/>
outline and we get a letter of approval. I know some people that <br/>
don&#39;t get a letter of approval. In that case you could make ask the <br/>
school dept. for something in writing that you homeschool and it is <br/>
ok by them. I think if we start giving them too much they will <br/>
demand it in the futer. Just because they don&#39;t understand doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean we own them ANY explanation at all. We simply only owe them our <br/>
APPROVAL from the school dept and that should be that !!!! I think <br/>
you are crazy to type up a report card !!! It&#39;s like my friend said <br/>
to me - it&#39;s not like your child is going to be failing when he is <br/>
home schooled :) Anyway, I wish you luck !! I hope everyone thinks <br/>
about this kind of stuff in the future that the less we give is the <br/>
best especially when we have to get their permission in the first <br/>
place.<br/>

Thanks. When I finally got ahold of someone from the local group they said a copy of my approval letter (which is really more an application) was enough for her to participate.<br/>
