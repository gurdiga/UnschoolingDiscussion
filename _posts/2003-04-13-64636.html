<br/>
All true spiritual truths speak about the importance of living in the<br/>
moment.  With reference to the quote from Thich Nhat Hanh, the phrase<br/>
&quot;walking on water&quot; was used as a metaphor in spiritual circles for those who<br/>
were at a higher level of spirituality than others and their effect on<br/>
others was to calm the waters.  Water is also a metaphor for the spirit.<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

&gt; Sorry if this list isn&#39;t your cup of tea. This last few days it hasn&#39;t<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; most people&#39;s cup of tea I&#39;ll warrant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But if you&#39;re unsubscribing you need to follow the directions at the<br/>
bottom<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;If I were homeschooling because of being fundamentalist Christians those<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;shows would both be really offensive to me, I&#39;m sure.  And I would shame<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Holly for even WANTING to watch them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But I&#39;m not a fundamentalist Christian, and I don&#39;t want to shame<br/>
&gt; &gt;Holly.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;This makes me want to unsub this list. Frequently there is a comment<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;bashing Christians, it seems.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And here I was noticing how precise Sandra was with her comment of  &quot;If I<br/>
&gt; were homeschooling because of being fundamentalist Christians.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These aren&#39;t comments about all of Christianity. We have some really<br/>
&gt; beautiful, wonderful souls on this list who identify themselves as<br/>
&gt; Christian. These are comments on the nature of the &quot;Fundamentalist<br/>
Christian<br/>
&gt; Homeschhooling Community.&quot; It&#39;s a small, but very vocal subset of the<br/>
&gt; general homeschooling community. This particular community of fundi<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers does indeed have some very strict rules about morality,<br/>
&gt; obedience, subservience and discipline. That was the reference.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot;next time you&#39;re angry, what might help?&quot;  &quot;Next time you feel<br/>

&gt; And then I&#39;d make really sure that he was happily engaged - that I was<br/>
&gt; really &quot;present&quot; enough in his life, available to him a lot, asking for<br/>
&gt; his presence and clearly enjoying him. I&#39;d find as many activities as<br/>
&gt; remotely possible that the two kids could enjoy together - eating a<br/>
&gt; piece of cake, playing a game, watching a movie, bowling, making a<br/>
&gt; fruit salad, washing the dog, or whatever....and I&#39;d do them with them<br/>
&gt; and make a special effort to really enjoy their presence EVEN if they<br/>
&gt; are cranky with each other. I&#39;d bite my tongue and keep just playing<br/>
&gt; and having fun myself. If you can enlist the 9 yo to feel proud of him<br/>
&gt; and his accomplishments, that&#39;ll really help. Make that a special thing<br/>
&gt; you and she share - exchange knowing glances when he does something you<br/>
&gt; are proud of.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Did you do this before joining this<br/>
&gt; &gt; group? Did you go and read all the archives? Did you visit Sandra&#39;s<br/>
site?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do<br/>
&gt; &gt; you use google? Sure we may come here thinking we know it all and may be<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit defensive but the way you have handled all of this gives me a<br/>
headache.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For someone that has claimed to have gone through so much, why can&#39;t you<br/>
&gt; &gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; ask questions?  I<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, yes, yes, and yes. I came here knowing I knew next to nothing about<br/>
&gt; unschooling in the context most of the ladies do and I&#39;ve repeatedly said<br/>
so,<br/>
&gt; and said I&#39;m grateful for their experience, their thoughts and willingness<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; share.  I do ask questions LOTS of questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And like it has been said before I&#39;m glad YOU got it, no explanation<br/>
needed,<br/>
&gt; but there are over a thousand people here.  It&#39;s not wrong to say you<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; believe in whipping babies or buying a rod to beat your child and that you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want associated with them.  It&#39;s just NOT.<br/>

&gt; I had to leave the list temporarily. Kevin went into the hospital on<br/>
&gt; March 7, and we didn&#39;t come home until April 1.  I just skimmed over<br/>
&gt; the past two days of messages.  Ouch.  Some of it made me<br/>
&gt; laugh...kind of like when a Christian friend confided in me that she<br/>
&gt; felt comfortable with me even though I was Catholic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The kids were so great while Kevin and I were in the hospital that I<br/>
&gt; picked up the new Harry Potter: Chamber of Secrets DVD for them today<br/>
&gt; at Wal-mart.  Only $14.77...I remember when you couldn&#39;t buy a DVD<br/>
&gt; for less than $25.00.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have the Harry Potter Sorcerer&#39;s Stone video game?  What<br/>
&gt; is your child&#39;s opinion of it?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well - it has been a long time since I dealt with these issues and I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t read the book in years, but I always assumed that those things<br/>
&gt; would happen and you&#39;d just keep at it. Persevere.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The expectation that someone would be able to say these things and then<br/>
&gt; the kid would go &quot;Oh yeah&quot; is unrealistic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What you&#39;re doing is building up credit - it takes a while. You get<br/>
&gt; credit for listening, for commenting appropriately, for being loving<br/>
&gt; when he&#39;s not, for having good instincts about when to hug and when to<br/>
&gt; give space.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It isn&#39;t a magic pill - to use these ideas. It doesn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; instantaneously. At least not usually - although sometimes it does seem<br/>
&gt; like a miracle cure at first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A couple of weeks ago, at our park day, a little girl came, crying, to<br/>
&gt; her mom. Her brother was being mean, she said. In their pretend play,<br/>
&gt; she was his dog and she wanted to be named one thing and he said that<br/>
&gt; was a stupid name and told her she was named something else. Her mom<br/>
&gt; held her and hugged her while she cried and cried. She&#39;d gulp and<br/>
&gt; breathe and recover a little and look at her mom and say, &quot;Its not fair<br/>
&gt; I WANT to be Penny and he won&#39;t LET me.&quot; And then cry some more. Mom<br/>
&gt; patted her back gently. She&#39;d comment just a little, once in a while -<br/>
&gt; &quot;You REALLY want to be Penny, huh.&quot; Stuff like that. At one point mom<br/>
&gt; kind of repeated something the girl had been saying, &quot;He called the<br/>
&gt; name you want to be stupid,&quot; The girl&#39;s crying got MUCh bigger and she<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;He always thinks my  ideas are stupid because he&#39;s older and he<br/>
&gt; thinks my ideas are for babies and.....on and on in a rush of<br/>
&gt; resentment and upset all against her brother.&quot; Mom NEVER argued with<br/>
&gt; her. Just hugged her while she got it ALL out. Said things once in a<br/>
&gt; while like, &quot;Oh,&quot; or other equally sympathetic, but noncommittal,<br/>
&gt; sounds. This took a LONG time - 20 minutes maybe. The son came over in<br/>
&gt; the middle of it - one of the other kids had tried to intervene, but he<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t budging. Eventually the girl was done and ready to go play again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The mom never got up and tried to intervene and force the boy to give<br/>
&gt; in - even though I imagine it was really frustrating, considering how<br/>
&gt; silly the whole fuss seemed - who CARES what name your pretend pet dog<br/>
&gt; chooses? Answer - both of these kids cared a lot - or maybe this wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even ABOUT that, really. Maybe he&#39;d been bossing her around for an hour<br/>
&gt; and this was just the final straw OR maybe she&#39;d been refusing to go<br/>
&gt; along with any of HIS ideas for the previous hour. NO way could mom<br/>
&gt; really know. Neither kid wanted to work it out - neither wanted to talk<br/>
&gt; about it at that point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was SO impressed with this mom&#39;s patience. She built up HUGE credit<br/>
&gt; with her daughter - she was so there for her - so NOT impatient and<br/>
&gt; wanting her to hurry up and get over it. She didn&#39;t interfere - allowed<br/>
&gt; her daughter to set the timing. She didn&#39;t force a solution - didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; force her to go &quot;talk about it&quot; - didn&#39;t try to make them work it out<br/>
&gt; since it was obvious that, at that time, anyway, neither wanted to do<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her kids played happily together for hours following that incident. All<br/>
&gt; was forgotten and forgiven. Maybe they talked about it later - or maybe<br/>
&gt; not. I know they talk about stuff like that - when everybody is feeling<br/>
&gt; good and they have a bit of distance and perspective. Either way, it<br/>
&gt; was a lovely lovely thing to watch such patience and kindness and<br/>
&gt; intelligence at work!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Which is it?  You never heard<br/>
&gt; &gt; of that sort of thing?  Or you know all about it because of how you grew<br/>
&gt; &gt; up?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never knew they were an organized threat to the<br/>
unschooling/homeschooling<br/>
&gt; movement.  I didn&#39;t think there were many people like that.  MOST of the<br/>
&gt; families in my church were loving caring people.  There were those that<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; just sick, like mine, but I didn&#39;t for one minute think they were all like<br/>
&gt; that.  I thought they just stayed hid in their own little churches trying<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; cause as little reaction as possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know what I lived and while my parents were avid church goers I believe<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; would have lived the exact same life if they never darkened a church&#39;s<br/>
door.<br/>
&gt; They were control freaks, they were sick in many ways.  I don&#39;t really<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; it came from church doctrine at all in my particular case.  Now the<br/>
perverted<br/>
&gt; behaviours of my FIL, the church didn&#39;t advocate that either.  He did get<br/>
&gt; caught in that and put out of the church for it, it was some years after I<br/>
&gt; was completely gone from there though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So my ignorance was that they were organized enough to speak out and try<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; have anything to do with legislation.  Most times when people are that<br/>
&gt; controlling and abusive they want no one prying in their business and<br/>
knowing<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s going on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also was ignorant of the church advocating whipping young children and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; things I read about in the last few days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was not ignorant that abuse takes place at all.  I know very well first<br/>
&gt; hand about that.  But I wasn&#39;t abused because I was willfully disobedient<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; wore make up or short dresses or didn&#39;t do chores or was disrespectful.  I<br/>
&gt; made sure I did nothing to make my father angry.  But nevertheless, I<br/>
walked<br/>
&gt; too loudly across the floor, I took too long in the shower.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
scrub<br/>
&gt; the baseboards just right, the dish water wasn&#39;t quite hot enough.  Not<br/>
&gt; anything to do with church doctrine or their religious beliefs at all.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I do wonder about the accuracy of your observations/judgments of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; referenced families as well as your motive in referring to them as<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling families.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They refer to themselves as unschoolers.  Until very recently I thought<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; were the example of &quot;unschooling&quot;.  They were the only people I had ever<br/>
come<br/>
&gt; in contact with that used the term unschooling.  They are definitely not<br/>
&gt; unschoolers after I&#39;ve come to read and read and listen and learn here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But you are right, if they don&#39;t cause a big enough problem, then it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; really a problem.  Other than I only found out about REAL unschooling<br/>
quite<br/>
&gt; by accident  (or maybe not)  when I was reading Sandra&#39;s website as<br/>
offered<br/>
&gt; by someone in a regular homeschool group.  So there are probably others<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; think the same thing I did about unschooling.  Probably not enough to hurt<br/>
&gt; unschooling as a group, but maybe enough to keep someone else away from<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; true joy that can come from it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No way to control what people call it though, you are right.<br/>

&gt; Subject: spanking was re: Christians again<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;As for the spanking part. I use it as a last resort. If they get<br/>
spanked<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;once a month the get spanked a lot.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, they do get spanked a lot. I&#39;m glad my husband doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
okay<br/>
&gt; to hit me only once a month. For that matter, I&#39;m glad my son, almost 14<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; getting bigger than me by the minute, doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s okay to hit me<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m smaller than him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Luckily we all have relationships based on trust and respect. I don&#39;t hit,<br/>
&gt; my husband doesn&#39;t hit, my kids don&#39;t hit. We don&#39;t hit each other. We<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; hit other people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you&#39;ll listen to any negative feedback you get about spanking with<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; open heart. Your babes want your open arms, not the back of your hand.<br/>
Life<br/>
&gt; can be better without spankings and punishments. Even if it&#39;s &quot;only&quot; once<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; month.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can feel that you are a loving and giving parent, Yoki. You want what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; best for your family. Family life really can work with peaceful parenting.<br/>
&gt; Really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I know what it means to be abused. So does their father. And he does not<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;like me to spank them for anything, but seeing as I am the<br/>
disciplinarian,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;he just respectfully bows out, :o)&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know you are not abusing your children, but you are also not parenting<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; gently and mindfully as you maybe could. Maybe you could talk to your<br/>
&gt; husband a bit more about why he objects to spanking.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My kids usually call me &quot;mom,&quot; unless they&#39;re someone else. If Katherine<br/>
&gt; &gt; is Thomas, I&#39;m Annie and Brian&#39;s Clarabel. If they&#39;re Mary and Laura<br/>
&gt; &gt; then I&#39;m Ma. If Katherine is Thomas the horse I&#39;m Tom. So I can always<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell who to answer depending on what I&#39;m addressed as.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well you already HAVE said something about them.  Do they exist?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Did they unschool (by theirs or anyone&#39;s definition) for their kids&#39;<br/>
entire<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschooling time, or did they take non-readers out of school in later<br/>
&gt; &gt; years<br/>
&gt; &gt; and ignore them and say &quot;unschooling&quot;?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These children have never in their lives been to school.  They<br/>
occasionally<br/>
&gt; go to Sunday School and Church.  They most definitely exist.  When the<br/>
mother<br/>
&gt; decided to return to work a few years ago she asked me to let the one<br/>
child<br/>
&gt; stay with me during the day.  I asked about school.  She told me that the<br/>
&gt; child (then 14 and court ordered to be supervised) really needed nothing<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the way of school.  He would find a way to amuse himself all day. She went<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; to tell me that if I needed something done, dishes, lawn mowed, vacuuming,<br/>
&gt; ANYTHING, I was to ask him, that&#39;s what he was used to.  It was short<br/>
term,<br/>
&gt; the child asked me to help him learn to read.  She didn&#39;t like that and<br/>
&gt; explained they were &quot;unschoolers&quot; and what it meant to her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also want to apologize for speaking for you to the group.  It was wrong.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; should have just said that it MIGHT offend anyone who lovingly raises<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; children in an unschooling environment to have people describe this kind<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; environment as unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, I am very sorry for even attempting to speak for you or anyone else<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the group.<br/>

&gt; Subject: unschooling park days was re:mother problems :-(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;It was nice to go to a park with Teresa.  We stayed as long as we wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;and had fun and talked, and not about school work or grades or<br/>
curriculum.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;LOL&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a fledgling unschooling group going here and we had our first park<br/>
&gt; day of the season last week. It was WONDERFUL. Not any  mention at all of<br/>
&gt; curriculums or even homeschooling for that matter. Lots of kids of wildly<br/>
&gt; varying ages playing cooperatively together. And lots of moms sharing life<br/>
&gt; stories, not school stories.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m so hoping the weather will hold for next week, but I hear it&#39;s<br/>
supposed<br/>
&gt; to snow again. :-(<br/>

&gt; &gt; The kids were so great while Kevin and I were in the hospital that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; picked up the new Harry Potter: Chamber of Secrets DVD for them today<br/>
&gt; &gt; at Wal-mart.  Only $14.77...I remember when you couldn&#39;t buy a DVD<br/>
&gt; &gt; for less than $25.00.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am so jealous!! $25 for a DVD in Australia is a bargain. I bought Mark<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;VERY very Christian.<br/>
&gt; Jewish kids would not feel welcome.<br/>
&gt; Islamic kids would not feel welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t want my kids there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If everyone&#39;s Christian by happenstance, there&#39;s no reason to call it<br/>
&gt; &quot;Christian&quot; anything.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Probably why no Islamic or Jewish kids go there.<br/>
&gt; I find it wonderful for my kids. My kids adore the coaches and wouldn&#39;t<br/>
miss<br/>
&gt; it for the world. They are sad every summer when it ends due to hot<br/>
weather.<br/>
&gt; I would never take them out just because it&#39;s too christian, I&#39;m not and<br/>
&gt; others would feel uncomfortable there. It&#39;s for my kids. It&#39;s what THEY<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s important.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as what coach calls it, it&#39;s his choice. Don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t go.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Not all Christians are that way. We do not walk around with belts ready<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;beat at the drop of the hat. We do not homeschool because of religious<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;reasons, and we do not live in fear of the television.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The discussion is not about all Christians. Never was. The discussion is<br/>
&gt; about the small, but very vocal and political group of fundamentalist<br/>
&gt; Christians who school at home under the directive of their church leaders.<br/>
&gt; There are very strict rules about what is allowed under those<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
&gt; They sell rods at their homeschool conventions to use on their kids. They<br/>
&gt; control and limit and shelter their kids to an extreme degree. It&#39;s a<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; to be very wary of.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe the complaint shouldn&#39;t be that we use the term Christian in<br/>
decribing<br/>
&gt; them. Maybe the complaint should be that they use the term Christian to<br/>
&gt; describe themselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I do not think you will find one absolutely perfect well adjusted<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;individual in the world today.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hey, personally I think I&#39;m doing okay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;We all have issues that we have to deal with. And they did not all arise<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;from a spanking.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No. But why should we put this potentially negative issue into our kids<br/>
&gt; lives to begin with?<br/>
