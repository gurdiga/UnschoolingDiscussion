<div id="ygrps-yiv-284675665">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I will be teaching my first college course this summer, as part of our<br/>
ever-changing strategy to let me stay at home with our kids during the<br/>
day. My evolving understanding/practice of unschooling is of course<br/>
affecting how I think about this class.<br/>
<br/>
I know that some of you have been teaching at university (or other<br/>
places?) for some time, and I wondered how unschooling has influenced<br/>
your approaches to these classes--in terms of how you structure a<br/>
class, how to assign grades (I remember that&#39;s been touched on in<br/>
recent posts), how to deal with oppressive administrations,<br/>
expectations of department heads, students, colleagues?<br/>
