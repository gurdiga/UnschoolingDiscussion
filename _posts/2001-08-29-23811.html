<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841826003">i don&#39;t know about the wine/breastmilk thing. i was always under the <br/>
impression that with alcohol time mattered more than content. that is, <br/>
alcohol was most prominent either 30 or 90 minutes after intake and then <br/>
evaporated fairly quickly. so i always thought timing was the most important. <br/>
just what i remember, but not too sure. ds is 3 1/2 and we just quit nursing <br/>
in december.<br/>
<br/>
strawberry tofu popsicles<br/>
1 1/2 c. firm silken tofu   <br/>
1 1/2 c. fresh ripe strawberries<br/>
1/2 c. honey or other sweetener<br/>
1/4 c. oil<br/>
1 T. lemon juice<br/>
1 t. vanilla<br/>
pinch of salt<br/>
<br/>
this is actually a recipe for pudding. the recipe says to blend and let sit <br/>
overnight, which i did and it wasn&#39;t firm enough. so we made popsicles and i <br/>
was impressed! they tasted great and had the texture of an ice cream bar.<br/>
