IMO your putting way too much pressure on your self. <br/>
I have four children ages 18 months to 14. I do not count time spent with  <br/>
them that sounds a bit like focus on the educational stuff and not life. One day <br/>
 I may watch tv for an hour and other days none. My kids don&#39;t do the same <br/>
thing  every day. I use my computer and sometimes will run down stairs to use <br/>
the one  in my room to print Ebay labels. That&#39;s the only time I can so I do. <br/>
Your  children need to be happy but so do you. If you are unschooling IMO you <br/>
don&#39;t  need to sit on your kids or be there all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My dd went to ps in K, I unschooled her in 1st  grade,<br/>
she went to ps in 2nd and asked to be homeschooled<br/>
again, so we  unschooled last year and this is our 3rd<br/>
year, but 2nd in a row. My ds went  to p/t preschool<br/>
for 1 year, the year my dd was in 2nd grade and  hated<br/>
it, so other than that we&#39;ve unschooled/been at home<br/>
together  since his birth.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son was in and out a couple times  in 3rd and 4th for 2 weeks. That&#39;s good <br/>
that you allowed that so everyone  knows where they want to be.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is your enthusiasm genuine? What  if I don&#39;t feel that?<br/>
Should I just do it anyway? Will it just  happen<br/>
eventually? Do you think I shouldn&#39;t homeschool if I<br/>
can&#39;t feel  that kind of enthusiasm? Are they better<br/>
off in  school?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here id say you either want to HS or not, sounds like you want to. Your  <br/>
feelings may change here and there and you will have days where you question  <br/>
yourself. No one can tell you if your unfit to HS, no one is in your house or  <br/>
knows you or your kids. If you think kids don&#39;t bicker or fight , they do, mine  <br/>
do. Ages and stages differ in each house. My 18 mo and 3 yr old are going  <br/>
through a sharing stage, it&#39;s normal. My 14 yr old and almost 6 yr old bothered  <br/>
each other for a couple years, it&#39;s finally leveling out. That too is normal. <br/>
If  you and I lived together there would be things that bugged both of us over <br/>
time.  That&#39;s normal..<br/>
You tried PS twice and didn&#39;t like it. Relax and have some fun with your  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do your kids help you clean up after playing with  all<br/>
that? I can barely do the regular housekeeping (and<br/>
what I do have  time to do housekeeping-wise is very<br/>
minimal!) and whenever we do an art  project, I can&#39;t<br/>
get the kids to help clean up. I&#39;ve explained to  them<br/>
that we would do more of this sort of thing if we<br/>
could clean up  together, as a team, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to motivate them. Am I expecting  too much to ask<br/>
them for help?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mine don&#39;t but when I ask  they generally do. I don&#39;t ask often bc they are <br/>
usually engulfed in another  activity. As they get older they help more. If <br/>
they value something they move  it bc they know I don&#39;t always know what&#39;s trash <br/>
and what isn&#39;t. My daughter  on any given day will whip out 10 drawings <br/>
leaving 30 or so pieces of paper  and crayons. I pick those up sometimes asking for <br/>
her help. Some days she say  no and others she helps it&#39;s all how I ask in the <br/>
end.<br/>
Telling them if they don&#39;t help there won&#39;t be fun more often to be had  <br/>
doesn&#39;t work. Kids think in the moment not ahead especially younger ones. I  think <br/>
your analyzing too much. Just go with life and it will all fall into  place.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What do you think is enough? If I spent one hour a day<br/>
with  them on a project is that enough? Or does that<br/>
not even begin to be enough?  3 hours? more?<br/>
Can you give me an idea of how much time you spend?<br/>
What  happens when your own soul hasn&#39;t been<br/>
replenished and you&#39;ve got nothing  left to give?&gt;&gt;<br/>
IMO an hour is long on one thing...That spills of perfection and finishing  <br/>
something just because it was started. <br/>
You can&#39;t put a timer on unschooling.. that&#39;s my opinion.. 3 hours doing  <br/>
what? that sounds like a long time..  <br/>
Some days my kids watch tv, use the computer and play outside. I&#39;m here but  <br/>
they don&#39;t seek me out all day everyday. I think your being too hard on your  <br/>
self. My almost 6 yr old has been unschooled all along. No sitters, no <br/>
preschool  and no lessons. Yesterday she asked me how to spell dinosaur. She  wrote <br/>
that along with some drawings and was quite impressed that she  did that. She <br/>
is quite interested in dinosaurs. When daddy go home she told  him and showed <br/>
him. That wasn&#39;t all she told him but the one that stuck in my  mind bc of her <br/>
excitement. That&#39;s an educational looking example and all i could  think of in <br/>
the moment. She&#39;s in a cast from a trampoline ankle twist (may or  may not be <br/>
broken they cant tell) so she&#39;s not as mobile..<br/>
 <br/>
Nicholas 3 played in a pile of dirt I cleaned up in the driveway. He loves  <br/>
bugs. Ants were yesterday&#39;s interest on top of Jay Jay on the computer and Dora <br/>
 and Diego (sp) on Nick. We went to the post office, sealed packages from  <br/>
Ebay sales.<br/>
 <br/>
Dustin 14 played Runescape,rode his bike,played with his friends and cooked  <br/>
brownies with the kids and I.<br/>
Things are not perfect and pretty all day esp with several children. I used  <br/>
to think they were in other homes too. Life is not perfect. Kids fall, people  <br/>
get sad,hungry,tired and happy. It&#39;s all in how you look at the glass 1/2 <br/>
empty  or 1/2 full.<br/>
Imagine the emotions and situations your kids would go through in school.  At <br/>
home you are there to help them in school they are alone to deal. Home sounds <br/>
 better. It will get better as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m happy to announce to you all that I&#39;ve  been<br/>
watching some T.V. with them, including Cyberchase and<br/>
talking with  them about it. Does it count if I bring<br/>
carrots to peel with me etc... to  do while I watch?<br/>
Also, I played with them with a huge box of  popscicle<br/>
sticks for a while and they had a blast with that. We<br/>
built a  city on our dining room table. But eventually<br/>
I had to leave to cook dinner  and they continued, I<br/>
only spent about 1/2 an hour.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That  sounds great! Why can&#39;t your bring carrots? I&#39;d say if you couldn&#39;t <br/>
bring  carrots that your life wasn&#39;t fair for you. I&#39;d be stressed if I didn&#39;t do <br/>
 what i needed to work around the kids to get normal daily house stuff done. <br/>
I  don&#39;t make them wait to go somewhere while I do laundry I do it while they <br/>
are  interested in something. Much like going to the bathroom everyone has <br/>
needs  and no one should feel they cannot reasonably reach their  goals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly IMO I think you posting shows your interest in HS&#39;ing and wants to  <br/>
work at being a better parent. I think your putting too much pressure on  <br/>
yourself to be perfect. If know your kids and talk to them they will guide  you.<br/>
