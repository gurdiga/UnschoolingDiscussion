<br/>
THE GOLDEN AGE OF HOMESCHOOLING<br/>
http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/192.html<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was a little scary to take or keep one&#39;s children out of school<br/>
when sending them was the societal norm. The word &#39;homeschooling&#39;<br/>
itself was suspect, a sort of code word for going against the grain,<br/>
refusing to conform, seeking that almost mythical &#39;road less traveled<br/>
by.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
We who identified ourselves as homeschoolers breathed a sigh of<br/>
relief and collectively cheered when John Holt appeared on The Phil<br/>
Donohue Show, when Linda Dobson&#39;s article was published in Good<br/>
Housekeeping, when the Colfax boys gained admission to Harvard.<br/>
<br/>
In our book &#39;Alternatives in Education&#39; (Tonasket, WA. Home Education<br/>
Press. 1987, 1992) writer and homeschooling father Earl Gary Stevens<br/>
notes in the Introduction, &#39;There is a mythological golden age of<br/>
public education in our consciousness, captured in Norman Rockwell<br/>
paintings, cinema, television, and modern literature, in which the<br/>
public school is a positive place where the children of our nation<br/>
come together to learn academics and social skills.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Has homeschooling progressed beyond a similar &#39;golden age,&#39; when the<br/>
term evoked a certain edgy rebelliousness, a commonality of striving<br/>
for acceptance, seeking approval and validation from society, the<br/>
media, legislators, and the education bureaucracy? We sought<br/>
acceptance for a different way; have we found more than we bargained<br/>
for in society&#39;s embrace? Homeschooling, like public schooling, faces<br/>
ever-increasing challenges, but the greatest threat to homeschooling<br/>
may be its own unquestionable success.<br/>
<br/>
The word &#39;homeschooling&#39; has become a much-sought-after appellation,<br/>
appearing in advertisements for educational toys, distance learning,<br/>
computer software, and school district alternative education<br/>
programs. The term has developed a certain cachet, so it now has a<br/>
perceived &#39;selling power.&#39; But like the word &#39;organic,&#39; which once<br/>
meant grown without chemicals and now merely seems to mean grown, the<br/>
word &#39;homeschooling&#39; is losing all functional meaning.<br/>
<br/>
In Power For All or For None (1998), a book of essays by Everett<br/>
Reimer and his daughter Katherine Reimer, a poem by Everett Reimer<br/>
includes these lines:<br/>
<br/>
Mere words cannot convey the truth<br/>
They always miss it, pass it by<br/>
Distort it just enough to change<br/>
A perfect truth to partial lie.<br/>
<br/>
The perfect truth is that homeschooling works. The partial lie - no,<br/>
the perfect lie - is that what may come to pass for homeschooling in<br/>
the years ahead will work as well.<br/>

UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you enjoyed Sandra Dodd&#39;s treatise on Gilligan&#39;s Isle in the<br/>
February issue of this newsletter. Sandra explains that the Gilligan<br/>
essay was written several years ago, and her daughter Holly no longer<br/>
wanders around the neighborhood naked. She&#39;s long outgrown such<br/>
freedoms.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There was a debate about whether someone could use schedules and<br/>
textbooks and still be considered unschooling. The consensus was that<br/>
textbooks and unschooling are not mutually exclusive. Most<br/>
unschoolers have textbooks in the house - sometimes lots of<br/>
textbooks. The schedule part is less cut-and-dried. You see, there&#39;s<br/>
the coercion part of the equation, too. There&#39;s the trusting your<br/>
child&#39;s innate ability and interest in learning. I think the<br/>
strongest and truest statement was something along the lines of,<br/>
&#39;Until you completely trust in your children and unschooling you<br/>
won&#39;t get the full benefit.&#39; I didn&#39;t believe it at the time, and I<br/>
don&#39;t think most people do until they try it. I believe it now,<br/>
because I see it working in my own family.&quot; ~~ Lisa Caryl ~~<br/>

ASK CAROL<br/>
<br/>
I wear two hats for HEM-one is the editor hat for this newsletter;<br/>
the other is a columnist hat for Home Education Magazine, the<br/>
original print version that&#39;s been supporting homeschoolers for over<br/>
20 years.<br/>
<br/>
Every other month, I ask people to send me questions and I promise to<br/>
answer as many as I can in future columns. Although I don&#39;t answer<br/>
them in this newsletter, where the space is just too tiny for my BIG<br/>
advice, I do answer them in every issue of Home Education Magazine. A<br/>
couple of them are online (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com), but most<br/>
of them you have to read in the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you<br/>
think your question is stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has your<br/>
particular problem (it&#39;s probably not true). So, help me out with<br/>
that other hat, and send me your questions. I even have a special<br/>
email address: askcarol@... . Of course, I don&#39;t<br/>
promise I can answer every question (especially if you don&#39;t send<br/>
one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use it for a<br/>
column or not. What are you waiting for? (~ CN ~)<br/>

EDUCATING MARILYN<br/>
<br/>
The Guinness Book of World Records says Marilyn Vos Savant has the<br/>
highest IQ of any living person. She also writes a question/answer<br/>
column that appears in Parade, a weekly supplement Sunday newspaper<br/>
supplement. In a recent issue, the following question about<br/>
homeschooling was asked and answered:<br/>
<br/>
Reader:  My husband and I are thinking of home-schooling. Do you recommend it?<br/>
<br/>
Marilyn:  I believe that traditional homeschooling (one parent stays<br/>
home to teach all children in the family up through the high school<br/>
years) can be a fine alternative to an unacceptable public school,<br/>
but I would not recommend it broadly unless most schools were<br/>
inadequate and most parents could teach everything from literature to<br/>
physics. And I don&#39;t believe that either is true.<br/>
<br/>
If home-schooling were institutionalized, half of the youthful<br/>
potential of Americans would go unfulfilled. Say that a bright young<br/>
parent sacrifices a rewarding career to stay home and teach the<br/>
children. When those children grow up, would half of them (one parent<br/>
from each married couple) also sacrifice their potential to stay home<br/>
and teach their own children? If so, then much of the result of<br/>
home-schooling would be the creation of more home-schooling parents<br/>
for the next generation, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe home-schoolers can justify this loss. If so, please write. I<br/>
believe that home-schooling is a noble experiment done for the right<br/>
reasons, and I hope to hear why it may prove to be a success.<br/>

FINAL WORD<br/>
<br/>
THINKERS GO TO THE BACK OF THE LUNCH LINE<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as public education. Education happens to<br/>
exactly one person at a time.<br/>
<br/>
There are some things that you just have to do by yourself. Even if<br/>
I&#39;m your teacher, you can&#39;t have my education; your education is a<br/>
private task that is given to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The education of someone or everyone else doesn&#39;t add a single item<br/>
to your stock of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s no such thing as compulsory education. Education is<br/>
something that each of us gives to ourselves or allows others to give<br/>
us. Otherwise we call it indoctrination or assault; we don&#39;t call it<br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
In my son&#39;s elementary school, there is a slogan plastered on the<br/>
walls:  &#39;Have the courage to stand up for what you believe.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
No one actually sees it at all: It&#39;s a form of wallpaper. It&#39;s not<br/>
intended to communicate information but to sweeten our day with words<br/>
so often repeated that no one&#39;s brain gets any traction on them<br/>
anymore. They are nothing more than a set of high-sounding nonsense<br/>
syllables.<br/>
<br/>
Besides that, it is utterly dishonest. The people who put up that<br/>
sign want anything, everything, except for your child to have the<br/>
courage to stand up for what she believes.<br/>
<br/>
The reason my son, Vince, and I were in the school in the first place<br/>
was because Vince had refused to take a test. He sat there quietly<br/>
but simply refused to make any marks on the paper, although he<br/>
thought the test was easy.<br/>
<br/>
Asked why, Vince said that the material was stupid, and that it was<br/>
exactly the same thing he had been learning in health for the last<br/>
several years:  how to make decisions, how to deal with stress, etc.<br/>
-- stuff Vince doesn&#39;t think bears repeating...<br/>
<br/>
You could put it like this: It had suddenly dawned on Vince that he<br/>
was the one who was responsible for his own education...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is an excerpt from an essay by Crispin Sartwell, chair of<br/>
humanities and sciences at the Maryland Institute College of Art. You<br/>
can read the rest of it at his website, but BE WARNED-many of you<br/>
will be offended by other material at the site. In fact, almost all<br/>
of us can probably find something offensive there. Some may even find<br/>
the end of this essay offensive. In spite of some good rhetoric<br/>
penned by his dad, Vince takes the test anyway. At least he didn&#39;t<br/>
have to wait for his lunch.  www.crispinsartwell.com (1.28)<br/>
