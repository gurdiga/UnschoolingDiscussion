<div id="ygrps-yiv-77047643">MARJI: Hope you don&#39;t mind me jumping in -- I&#39;m just a newbie.  But <br/>
I&#39;m sitting here bored out of my mind because I&#39;m 9 months pg, so I&#39;m <br/>
gathering up my courage to post to a few people, even though I&#39;m <br/>
new... Feel free to ignore me if you want!  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
Your son sounds like the perfect example of a first born/ only child <br/>
as told in The Birth Order by Kevin Leman.  (actually I think it <br/>
was &quot;the new birth order book&quot; or something)  I just<br/>
finished that <br/>
book this weekend.  It was VERY interesting.  Now, I know we<br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
categorize every person by their personality type, birth-order, sex, <br/>
etc but there are some definite indicators of personality based<br/>
on our birth order.  I encourage you to read it for a reference.  <br/>
Leman suggests that because first-borns have only adults to emulate <br/>
at home, rather than other children, they often set themselves up in<br/>
this perfectionist-mode.  A lot of times we as parents encourage <br/>
that, especially if we&#39;re first-borns ourselves (like I am). <br/>
<br/>
Just something to think about.  I know it&#39;s &quot;pop-psych&quot;<br/>
 but that <br/>
book made a lot of sense to me, FWIW!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, just to give you a sample: some advice the author gives is to <br/>
make sure your first-born sees that YOU make mistakes, and it&#39;s<br/>
no big deal.  Say you&#39;re sorry or &quot;I was wrong&quot; if you<br/>
are. Maybe you <br/>
could do an activity together that you&#39;re not so good at, to show <br/>
your imperfections?  Like I&#39;m really bad at jigsaw puzzles... so <br/>
maybe I could get one and show my child how hard it is for me to put <br/>
together more than the border!  Just a thought *grin*<br/>

Makes sense in a sensible way! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was the perfectionist and the first-born in my family.  Kirby is the <br/>
firstborn here.  <br/>
<br/>
Bad thing is it stays for life, not just childhood.<br/>
