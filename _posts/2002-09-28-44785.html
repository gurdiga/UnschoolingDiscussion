But I though your &quot;cruelty is overrated&quot; was pretty funny!<br/>

As far as the socialization issue, I have a tendency to just laugh.  Do they<br/>

<br/>
When we first decided to homeschool, of course one of the biggest &#39;mouth <br/>
wide open eyes bugging out&#39; questions was about socialization. I learned <br/>
early on a good response. Generally the question goes, &quot;But what about <br/>
socialization????&quot; In which I would reply just as surprised and shocked <br/>
with, &quot;Exactly!!!!! There wasn&#39;t one person I used that on that didn&#39;t get <br/>
my meaning and were virtually speechless!!!<br/>
