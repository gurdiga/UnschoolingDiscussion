<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162404102">We are unschoolers and in our home there is a lot that is &quot;required&quot;.<br/>
Regular bathing and changing of the undies (Eeew), feeding the animals,<br/>
picking up after yourself, not eating too much junk, and so on and so on.<br/>
To say to be a &quot;true&quot; unschooler you can not have rules is simply<br/>
ludicrous. We&#39;re all different and if that works for you that&#39;s great! That<br/>
would not work for us. If we didn&#39;t have rules at our home we&#39;d be living<br/>
in a filthy, piled up with junk to the ceiling home with no clean clothes<br/>
or dishes, no healthy food, and dead animals. That&#39;s not much of an<br/>
incentive for a change here, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder about the unlimited tv viewing though, is it hours and hours daily<br/>
because that&#39;s how your post came across to me. Are you watching it with<br/>
them and talking about what they&#39;re seeing?<br/>
This is JMHO and it works for me and mine - I do not allow unlmited tv for<br/>
the same reason I wouldn&#39;t drop a child at a strip bar. Not only are some<br/>
of the shows nasty but some commercials are also, I&#39;m not sure which are<br/>
worse! Don&#39;t get me wrong, we watch some tv but there is a limit to how<br/>
much and what is watched. Playing, reading, writing or staring at the wall<br/>
is preferable.<br/>
<br/>
If I have to do away with all rules to be a &quot;real&quot; unschooler well, so be<br/>
it, it&#39;s just a label and I&#39;m not big on labels anyway  :-D<br/>
I don&#39;t use the label &quot;unschooler&quot; anyway unless I&#39;m around other<br/>
homeschoolers so they know what &quot;style&quot; of homeschooling we do. The general<br/>
public doesn&#39;t really have a clue what it means, and some homeschoolers<br/>
don&#39;t either. The label I normally use is &quot;home educator&quot;, which everyone<br/>
seems to understand, I am at home educating the next generation with my<br/>
words and actions. I dislike using &quot;homeschool&quot; because we do not &quot;school<br/>
at home&quot; but that&#39;s just my idiosyncrasy. I don&#39;t judge others who use that<br/>
label, knowing it&#39;s just a general label that lumps us all together - the<br/>
school at homers, the unschoolers and everyone in between.<br/>
It&#39;s our actions that show who we are, not our labels, wouldn&#39;t you agree?<br/>

My kids change their underwear because when they don&#39;t they get rashes. My<br/>
kids don&#39;t eat too much junk because I don&#39;t buy just junk, I buy a mixture<br/>
of foods. A few junk items that they can eat mostly when they want. By<br/>
mostly I mean if thye are getting something out of the cabinet adn it is 5<br/>
minutes before dinner I remind them that I have made a big meal and they<br/>
might want to put their food on the table so they can eat it WITH thier<br/>
meal. I think most adults would admit to sticking a cookie or similar item<br/>
in their mouth &#39;cause they are so hungry before dinner. To me it&#39;s the same<br/>
thing.<br/>
 &lt;&lt;We&#39;re all different and if that works for you that&#39;s great! &gt;&gt;<br/>
****I was sharing what works for me.<br/>
&lt;&lt;That would not work for us. If we didn&#39;t have rules at our home we&#39;d be<br/>
living<br/>
in a filthy, piled up with junk to the ceiling home with no clean clothes<br/>
or dishes, no healthy food, and dead animals. That&#39;s not much of an<br/>
incentive for a change here, eh?&gt;&gt;<br/>
***Have you tried it? Or are you assuming?<br/>
Do you really believe that if you didn&#39;t have rules, your pets would starve<br/>
to death? Isn&#39;t caring about another living being ENOUGH of an incentive?<br/>
Isn&#39;t hunger enough of an incentive to buy groceries? Isn&#39;t knowledge of<br/>
good nutrition and a desire to be healthy enough incentive? I feel sad when<br/>
people say that they would just do nothing without rules.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wonder about the unlimited tv viewing though, is it hours and hours<br/>
daily<br/>
because that&#39;s how your post came across to me. Are you watching it with<br/>
them and talking about what they&#39;re seeing?&gt;&gt;<br/>
***I&#39;m not sure who you&#39;re asking becuse it&#39;s easy to forget exactly who<br/>
said what since we have no visuals of each other but I am going to answer<br/>
how WE handle this. Just because TV is unlimited doesn&#39;t mean our lives<br/>
revolve around it. some days we do have the TV on alot, some days we don&#39;t.<br/>
When I get tired of hearing the noise of TV I get involved with the kids, I<br/>
get out the paints, I get the sidewalk chalks and we go outside (note to<br/>
self: hit Target for chalks, Spiring is almost here!!) I play a board game<br/>
with them, we play Hide and go seek. But if I am answering emails, reading<br/>
unschooling.com, cooking something that requires concentration, or painting<br/>
my toenails, I can&#39;t always expect my kids to think of ideas that will tear<br/>
them away from Rugrats. basically, in thinking, they tend to watch TV when i<br/>
am not paying attention.<br/>
Sometimes we do watch together, DH more than me. I tend to sit with teh kids<br/>
and watch the shows that some would think inappropriate. For example, I<br/>
watch Will & Grace with my daughter because the underlying theme of the show<br/>
is human sexuality, hetero and homosexual. I want the definitions of terms<br/>
to come from me, not for her to sit and wonder. I watch COPS with the kids<br/>
and we talk about hte peoples choices on the show. (I love Cops!!!!)<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is JMHO and it works for me and mine - I do not allow unlmited tv for<br/>
the same reason I wouldn&#39;t drop a child at a strip bar. Not only are some<br/>
of the shows nasty but some commercials are also, I&#39;m not sure which are<br/>
worse! Don&#39;t get me wrong, we watch some tv but there is a limit to how<br/>
much and what is watched. &gt;&gt;<br/>
I believe that TV broadens horizons and I trust that my kids will watch teh<br/>
shows that they are ready for. Emily doesn&#39;t watch alot of videos on MTV<br/>
which I agree can be &quot;nasty&quot; (I take it you mean sexually explicit?) but she<br/>
doesn&#39;t need to. Nickelodeon does TONS of videos that are aimed at the<br/>
Tweens adn teens. Emily tends to not watch the news, she&#39;ll peek in here and<br/>
there but I think it gets a little intense (especially now) so she tunes it<br/>
out. Kids will not watch something that makes them uncomfortable unless<br/>
forced to. Would you? You probably would change the channel. I trust my<br/>
children to do the same.<br/>
&lt;&lt;Playing, reading, writing or staring at the wall<br/>
is preferable.&gt;&gt;<br/>
****Why? What if that&#39;s not what they want to do at the moment? If your<br/>
child painted all day to the exclusion of all else, would this be bad? What<br/>
if that is their &quot;thing&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I have to do away with all rules to be a &quot;real&quot; unschooler well, so be<br/>
it,&gt;&gt;<br/>
I have rules,<br/>
No doing drugs and drinking under age of majority, I am not going to jail<br/>
for you.<br/>
No stealing<br/>
No lying<br/>
more stuff like that. When I say Rules, I mean teh typical rules of the<br/>
house stuff like, It&#39;s Johhny&#39;s job to do the dishes every night and if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t there is a punishnment.  If I ask for help with something (asking<br/>
not requiring) and I don&#39;t get the help, it will take me longer to get it<br/>
done and we may miss out on going somewhere fun. I do remind them of that,<br/>
&quot;We have to be at Debra&#39;s house at noon, could someone empty the dishwasher<br/>
becasue I won&#39;t have enough time before we need to leave&quot; They can say no,<br/>
but if we don&#39;t get there until 12:30 and the mini-van caravan has already<br/>
left for the field trip, we&#39;re out of luck. That&#39;s a natural consequence.<br/>
(Here&#39;s an aside: I was at the park the otehr day and there was a big school<br/>
group. the teacher said to a boy who was baout 5 feet out of line, Johnny,<br/>
get back in line. If you can&#39;t stay in line, you won&#39;t come to the park next<br/>
time. That&#39;s a natural consequence.&quot; My thought: NO!, that&#39;s a punishment. A<br/>
natural consequence would be Johnny seperates from the group, gets lost and<br/>
is scared and alone.)<br/>
&lt;&lt;it&#39;s just a label and I&#39;m not big on labels anyway  :-D<br/>
I don&#39;t use the label &quot;unschooler&quot; anyway unless I&#39;m around other<br/>
homeschoolers so they know what &quot;style&quot; of homeschooling we do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
I don&#39;t homeschool. i don&#39;t school. I didn&#39;t pick the label unschooler, it<br/>
was given to me as a way of explaining what I and many others do.<br/>
&lt;&lt;The general<br/>
public doesn&#39;t really have a clue what it means, and some homeschoolers<br/>
don&#39;t either.&gt;&gt;<br/>
That&#39;s why I use it to anyone I meet.(except my Aunt who is a second grade<br/>
teacher, she will never understand and I don&#39;t choose to get into it with<br/>
her.) . I want people to understand it, I want it to become the norm. or at<br/>
the very least a well known and respected option in education. If I don&#39;t<br/>
use it and don&#39;t continually explain it, how will that happen?<br/>
&lt;&lt; The label I normally use is &quot;home educator&quot;, which everyone<br/>
seems to understand, I am at home educating the next generation with my<br/>
words and actions. I dislike using &quot;homeschool&quot; because we do not &quot;school<br/>

label, knowing it&#39;s just a general label that lumps us all together - the<br/>

Absolutely!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576913733">Thank you Karin for your explanation of how your family unschools. <br/>
I guess for us, unschooling has meant freedom. We choose, the kids and I, how much we want to study a topic we are interested in and we have the freedom to just live our lives if that is what feels good that day or week or month. The main thing is either way we are learning. I was PS schooled and so I fall back to that occasionally. I am learning another way. But it is slow going and Unschooling has been such a joy to us. I love it. I cannot see us doing it any other way unless the kids want something different later on.<br/>

  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling or not?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I too do not like labels of &quot;real&quot; unschooling or not. To me what matters most is having a desired pleasant, respectful, loving relationship with my kids. I do whatever I have to do to attain that desired relationship. I find that whenever I assert my &quot;control&quot; over my kids, I damage that relationship. I try (KEY word!) to treat my kids as I would an adult. I always try and think in those terms. <br/>
<br/>
  This applies to every issue that comes up in our everyday lives. From bathing, to watching TV or playing on the computer, to eating food, cleaning, chores, personal hygiene, etc. <br/>
  Examples: <br/>
  bathing - they do not have a set bathing schedule. They take showers or baths when they feel like it. If they are particularly dirty, I will suggest that they do shower. I tell them how it&#39;s nice to look clean for others, it&#39;s important to stay clean for health reasons, and they do admit to feeling better after they take a shower and I remind them how nice that feeling is. I help them learn why it&#39;s important to bath regularly. This also applies to teeth-brushing, which they also know there is a consequence of getting cavities and also bad breath if they don&#39;t stay on top of cleaning their teeth.<br/>
<br/>
  TV - They watch a moderate amount of tv most days. Yes, I&#39;ll admit, it&#39;s usually when I&#39;m on the computer. &lt;g&gt; But, I don&#39;t tell my husband when or when not to watch tv. I certainly would be offended if anyone dictated my tv viewing. I want my kids to learn how to handle tv viewing on their own terms. They enjoy certain shows. They usually watch Nick the most. They DON&#39;T watch all day. It just gets too boring after a while. Then we do other things like read books, go shopping or to the library or think of some other outings. My boys love playing legos, and chess and other games. Sometimes we will get out paints or do some other crafty project. We also enjoy doing outside projects, like right now we are attempting to landscape our backyard with bricks borders and walkways and also eventually put grass in. We also enjoy gardening.<br/>
<br/>
  Computer - The first thing my boys do when they get up in the morning is play their gameboys. They play the various Pokemon games for gameboys and are very challenged by these games. These games are very detailed and complex and I can see a lot of learning go on just by watching them. They enjoy battling each other by hooking their gameboys together. They also each have their own PC&#39;s in their room with a variety of games they like to play. Age of Empires, LegoRacers, Roller Coaster Tycoon and Flight Simulator are some of their favorites. Again, they play these for a while but certainly not all day. <br/>
<br/>
  I could go on and on about the various things that we do in our house. But the overall factor is that I have severely stopped the absolute &quot;you will do this because I said so&quot; control that I used to assert over my kids. This is the main difference of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; we started unschooling. I have to say that once I let go of MY CONTROL over these issues, they have gradually balanced themselves. And I am so proud of the way that I see this balance happening. <br/>
<br/>
  I would never presume to say that *I* am unschooling the RIGHT way and someone else is doing it the WRONG way. All I can say is what I know has worked for our family. While I was homeschooling my kids for the previous 5 years, we were just so miserable. I was constantly in fights and battles of will with my kids. There was crying and frustration and a general ME against THEM atmosphere. Well, since unschooling, it&#39;s not that way anymore. Now, its just US all together, enjoying learning and experiencing life and all it has to offer. And I&#39;m so thankful that I stumbled across unschooling.com and the message I got there was to let go of the control aspect of parenting and replace it with respect, and that is what I have done, and THEY WERE RIGHT! It has worked and I am seeing improved family life as time goes by.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not good at debating with others or proving my point, or writing my thoughts in an eloquent way. But I&#39;m trying my best to convey my profound happiness in unschooling, and they way that I define unschooling for US. And I love being here and reading all your various thoughts and opinions about unschooling. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978664815">This discussion was brought up at another list recently (again). I don&#39;t <br/>
know where the definition changed from the original coiner of the term, <br/>
or why. But I do know that there is no clear cut definition that <br/>
determines one to be an unschooler or not. And if someone wants to hone a <br/>
description based on their beleifs, they should coin a new term and stop <br/>

<br/>
Q: What is unschooling? <br/>
A: When the writer John Holt first used the word unschooling over twenty <br/>
years ago, he was simply using it as a synonym for what we now call <br/>
homeschooling -- that is, children learning at home rather than in <br/>
school. Back in those early days, there was no one word to describe the <br/>
phenomenon of children learning at home, and people spoke about it with a <br/>
variety of words and phrases.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, the word unschooling has come to be associated with the <br/>
approach to homeschooling that John Holt wrote about: homeschooling <br/>
without following a packaged curriculum, homeschooling that follows the <br/>
child&#39;s interests, homeschooling with an emphasis on real-life activities <br/>
rather than worksheets, homeschooling in a way that doesn&#39;t make rigid <br/>
distinctions between schoolwork and the rest of life.<br/>
<br/>
At Growing Without Schooling magazine, we don&#39;t see unschooling as a <br/>
rigidly defined concept or approach. It&#39;s certainly not something you <br/>
have to think of as a package. Our advice to anyone reading these <br/>
questions is that you don&#39;t have to think in terms of &quot;being unschoolers&quot; <br/>
or &quot;doing unschooling.&quot; If any of the approaches described here appeal to <br/>
you, then by all means take the time to find out more, and adapt what you <br/>
read about so that it fits your family. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;People take different roads seeking <br/>
fulfillment and happiness. Just <br/>
because they&#39;re not on your road <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve gotten lost.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372879344">I too do not like labels of &quot;real&quot; unschooling or not. To me what matters most is having a desired pleasant, respectful, loving relationship with my kids. I do whatever I have to do to attain that desired relationship. I find that whenever I assert my &quot;control&quot; over my kids, I damage that relationship. I try (KEY word!) to treat my kids as I would an adult. I always try and think in those terms. <br/>
<br/>
This applies to every issue that comes up in our everyday lives. From bathing, to watching TV or playing on the computer, to eating food, cleaning, chores, personal hygiene, etc. <br/>
Examples: <br/>
bathing - they do not have a set bathing schedule. They take showers or baths when they feel like it. If they are particularly dirty, I will suggest that they do shower. I tell them how it&#39;s nice to look clean for others, it&#39;s important to stay clean for health reasons, and they do admit to feeling better after they take a shower and I remind them how nice that feeling is. I help them learn why it&#39;s important to bath regularly. This also applies to teeth-brushing, which they also know there is a consequence of getting cavities and also bad breath if they don&#39;t stay on top of cleaning their teeth.<br/>
<br/>
TV - They watch a moderate amount of tv most days. Yes, I&#39;ll admit, it&#39;s usually when I&#39;m on the computer. &lt;g&gt; But, I don&#39;t tell my husband when or when not to watch tv. I certainly would be offended if anyone dictated my tv viewing. I want my kids to learn how to handle tv viewing on their own terms. They enjoy certain shows. They usually watch Nick the most. They DON&#39;T watch all day. It just gets too boring after a while. Then we do other things like read books, go shopping or to the library or think of some other outings. My boys love playing legos, and chess and other games. Sometimes we will get out paints or do some other crafty project. We also enjoy doing outside projects, like right now we are attempting to landscape our backyard with bricks borders and walkways and also eventually put grass in. We also enjoy gardening.<br/>
<br/>
Computer - The first thing my boys do when they get up in the morning is play their gameboys. They play the various Pokemon games for gameboys and are very challenged by these games. These games are very detailed and complex and I can see a lot of learning go on just by watching them. They enjoy battling each other by hooking their gameboys together. They also each have their own PC&#39;s in their room with a variety of games they like to play. Age of Empires, LegoRacers, Roller Coaster Tycoon and Flight Simulator are some of their favorites. Again, they play these for a while but certainly not all day. <br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about the various things that we do in our house. But the overall factor is that I have severely stopped the absolute &quot;you will do this because I said so&quot; control that I used to assert over my kids. This is the main difference of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; we started unschooling. I have to say that once I let go of MY CONTROL over these issues, they have gradually balanced themselves. And I am so proud of the way that I see this balance happening. <br/>
<br/>
I would never presume to say that *I* am unschooling the RIGHT way and someone else is doing it the WRONG way. All I can say is what I know has worked for our family. While I was homeschooling my kids for the previous 5 years, we were just so miserable. I was constantly in fights and battles of will with my kids. There was crying and frustration and a general ME against THEM atmosphere. Well, since unschooling, it&#39;s not that way anymore. Now, its just US all together, enjoying learning and experiencing life and all it has to offer. And I&#39;m so thankful that I stumbled across unschooling.com and the message I got there was to let go of the control aspect of parenting and replace it with respect, and that is what I have done, and THEY WERE RIGHT! It has worked and I am seeing improved family life as time goes by.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not good at debating with others or proving my point, or writing my thoughts in an eloquent way. But I&#39;m trying my best to convey my profound happiness in unschooling, and they way that I define unschooling for US. And I love being here and reading all your various thoughts and opinions about unschooling. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464169450">&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t<br/>
know where the definition changed from the original coiner of the term,<br/>
or why. But I do know that there is no clear cut definition that<br/>
determines one to be an unschooler or not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with this statement. An original definition does not always<br/>
apply as time goes on.  I believe that an unschooler DOES NOT, require<br/>
school work, use a math curriculum in order to learn what is &quot;needed&quot;, have<br/>
an idea of grade x means one learns about turtles in science, breaks down<br/>
life into subject matter when not required to for reporting purposes, or<br/>
believes that all children should learn how to read by x age. I believe that<br/>
those examples are clear cut. I think it is possible to define it to an<br/>
extent, and beyond that, debate is healthy and productive to learning.<br/>
 &lt;&lt;And if someone wants to hone a<br/>
description based on their beleifs, they should coin a new term and stop<br/>
picking on the ones that follow the loose description of the orignial<br/>
work.&gt;&gt;<br/>
So I should stop questioning? I should stop learning?<br/>
I should stop stating my beliefs? I can&#39;t stop picking on others becasue I<br/>
am not picking on them.<br/>
A new term. Hmmm.There are many terms that are used for this. Child led<br/>
learning, Natural learning, Interest led, Delight driven etc. etc.etc.<br/>
Unschooling seems to be the word in common usage so that is what I use.<br/>
After all, I can&#39;t just decide to call a banana a gliglybop and have people<br/>
get an idea of what I&#39;m referring to.<br/>
&lt;&lt;BUT there are parents here that get lambasted for not adhering to a<br/>
certain policy on unschoolling, when in fact, there isn&#39;t one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
Well, then why are we here? Aren&#39;t we here to talk about what unschooling<br/>
means to us? What we do all day, what our children do? Because my perception<br/>
of unschooling is narrower than another&#39;s idea of unschooling, I shouldn&#39;t<br/>
discuss or point out a way that is different because I may hurt someones<br/>
feelings? I don&#39;t believe everyone should think like I do, that would be a<br/>
very boring world with no differing opinions. Just consider what I have to<br/>
say, and treat me as if maybe, just maybe I could be talking with my heart<br/>
and offering a different viewpoint. Like I said before, give others the<br/>
benefit of the doubt.<br/>

Kara and Ellissa, you both remind me of one of my favorite Holt quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All I am saying in this book can be summed up in two words: Trust Children. <br/>
Nothing could be more simple, or more difficult. Difficult because to trust <br/>
children we must first learn to trust ourselves, and most of us were taught <br/>
as children that we could not be trusted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-John Holt, in &quot;How Children Learn&quot;<br/>
<br/>
... and, concerning the debates the topic of unschooling engenders:<br/>
<br/>
Paradigms are difficult to perceive. They are also so deeply internalized <br/>
that many of their components remain out of awareness. This situation can be <br/>
put to use in discovering them: argumentation and ferment within disciplines <br/>
often occurs, so to speak, at the &quot;fault line&quot; between paradigms. Yet, <br/>
because a paradigm so deeply creates &quot;reality,&quot; people feel challenged by its <br/>
discussion and often experience surprise, disbelief, resistance, or <br/>
defensiveness. <br/>

&gt;****My beliefs are NOT ludicrous. That was mean<br/>
<br/>
Did I say &quot;your beliefs&quot; were ludicrous? No, and I was not being &quot;mean&quot; so<br/>
get your panties out of a twist LOL. I was referring to the blanket<br/>
statement (see copy below) made previously.<br/>
~&quot;When you say &quot;I require them to....do X&quot; That is in my and many other<br/>
unschoolers opinions, not part of unschooling.&quot;~<br/>
That&#39;s a pretty broad statement and even one you admit to doing - you<br/>
&quot;require&quot; that your children not do drugs, drink, lie or steal. We all have<br/>
expectations or requirements or rules or whatever you want to call them!<br/>
Dialect varies, since we&#39;re from different states and even different<br/>
countries perhaps you could be a bit more understanding and give the<br/>
benefit of doubt to others?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ****I was sharing what works for me.<br/>
<br/>
And I also. Like I said before, if it works for you - great, your way would<br/>
not work for us. I&#39;m just stating my opinions which happen to differ from<br/>
yours. I&#39;m entitled to my opinion just as you are, but who is to determine<br/>
what is the &quot;right&quot; definition of unschooling? It means something different<br/>
to different people. There is no one way to homeschool, unschool - the<br/>
cookie cutter method is PSing, not HSing<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ***Have you tried it? Or are you assuming?<br/>
<br/>
I know my family, you obviously do not  LOL<br/>
:-)  You see, I&#39;m the one who has to spend time picking up and cleaning<br/>
when they do not pick/clean up after themselves. It&#39;s much more fun when<br/>
everyone pitches in because we not only work together but there&#39;s more time<br/>
to play together. I do no want to be a martyr mom spending her day cleaning<br/>
while the family entertains themselves with tv and such. I prefer we all do<br/>
our part so we all have time to pursue our interests.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you really believe that if you didn&#39;t have rules, your pets would<br/>
starve<br/>
&gt; to death? Isn&#39;t caring about another living being ENOUGH of an incentive?<br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t hunger enough of an incentive to buy groceries? Isn&#39;t knowledge of<br/>
&gt; good nutrition and a desire to be healthy enough incentive? I feel sad<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; people say that they would just do nothing without rules.<br/>
<br/>
See, again, you do not know my family :-)  I will try to address your<br/>
questions in order:<br/>
While I am a big animal lover no one else here is, some people are just not<br/>
animal lovers. They do not hate animals, just are very indifferent. So yes,<br/>
the animals literally would starve if I did not remind or do it myself.<br/>
Yes, caring is enough for me but no, it is not for the rest of the family.<br/>
Knowledge of good nutrition does not mean they will purchase/eat good<br/>
things, I&#39;ve seen what my DH brings home when he shops LOL  So yes, hunger<br/>
is incentive to shop but no, knowledge is not enough for them to purchase<br/>
food that is good for them.<br/>
Don&#39;t feel sad for us. We enjoy living life and the time we get to spend<br/>
together and alone. That&#39;s why we educate at home instead of PS  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Playing, reading, writing or staring at the wall<br/>
&gt; is preferable.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; ****Why? What if that&#39;s not what they want to do at the moment? If your<br/>
&gt; child painted all day to the exclusion of all else, would this be bad?<br/>
What<br/>
&gt; if that is their &quot;thing&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
This quote was snipped a little short.<br/>
In answer to your &quot;why?&quot; do we prefer all those things over tv watching,<br/>
well I don&#39;t know, that is just our taste and lifestyle. Why do you have<br/>
the preferences you have? (rhetorical question). We&#39;re just not big tv<br/>
watchers so it was never used as a babysitter and it never became a habit<br/>
to be broken.<br/>
We are who we are. We (your family and mine) are different, that&#39;s life. I<br/>
suppose we&#39;re weird in your eyes because we prefer to do things (games,<br/>
play music, walk, talk etc), read something interesting or write to a<br/>
friend/relative (on paper or e-mail) rather than watching tv. Oh well<br/>
(shrug), to each his/her own. Like I said before - pretty much anything<br/>
else, even staring at the wall, is preferable to us over tv watching. I<br/>
don&#39;t know why you&#39;d have a problem with our tv viewing, or lack thereof.<br/>
As for painting all day, why would that be bad? We do what we enjoy and if<br/>
that&#39;s painting all day, week or month then so be it.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure by the way you phrased it if you&#39;re asking what if tv was the<br/>
&quot;thing&quot; or if it&#39;s painting that&#39;s the thing or what you&#39;re trying to get<br/>
across so I&#39;ll just assume that you&#39;re asking *what* the &quot;thing&quot; is here<br/>
LOL. At the moment the &quot;thing&quot; is an off brand &quot;Sim City&quot; type computer<br/>
game, that is better liked than Sim City (which I like more), and playing<br/>
the guitar.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; more stuff like that. When I say Rules, I mean teh typical rules of the<br/>
&gt; house stuff like, It&#39;s Johhny&#39;s job to do the dishes every night and if<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t there is a punishnment.  If I ask for help with something (asking<br/>
&gt; not requiring) and I don&#39;t get the help, it will take me longer to get it<br/>
&gt; done and we may miss out on going somewhere fun. I do remind them of<br/>
that,<br/>
&gt; &quot;We have to be at Debra&#39;s house at noon, could someone empty the<br/>

&gt; becasue I won&#39;t have enough time before we need to leave&quot; They can say<br/>
no,<br/>
&gt; but if we don&#39;t get there until 12:30 and the mini-van caravan has<br/>
already<br/>
&gt; left for the field trip, we&#39;re out of luck. That&#39;s a natural consequence.<br/>
<br/>
I agree and disagree with some points.<br/>
I agree with the &quot;natural consequence&quot; of if I have to do more work we<br/>
don&#39;t have the time for as much fun as we would have.<br/>
I disagree with putting others in the position of being put out because of<br/>
something going on in our family, such as your &quot;dishes/Debra&quot; story.<br/>
Since I&#39;m an organized person at heart I don&#39;t wait until before an event<br/>
to get &quot;have to&quot; things done so it&#39;s not something that we&#39;ve dealt with in<br/>
our family. But, due to other families who use this form of consequence<br/>
and/or punishment it has affected us to some extent. When they cancel it&#39;s<br/>
very frustrating and when it&#39;s repetitive it&#39;s downright discourteous. The<br/>
natural consequence is that people no longer make plans with them  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that you had so many questions I hope this makes my first post a bit<br/>
more clear for you Elissa. Now you know me and mine just a tiny bit better!<br/>

=====<br/>
Q: What is unschooling?<br/>
A: When the writer John Holt first used the word unschooling over<br/>
twenty years ago, he was simply using it as a synonym for what we<br/>
now call homeschooling -- that is, children learning at home rather<br/>
than in school. Back in those early days, there was no one word to<br/>
describe the phenomenon of children learning at home, and people<br/>
spoke about it with a variety of words and phrases.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, the word unschooling has come to be associated with the<br/>
approach to homeschooling that John Holt wrote about: homeschooling<br/>
without following a packaged curriculum, homeschooling that follows<br/>
the child&#39;s interests, homeschooling with an emphasis on real-life<br/>
activities rather than worksheets, homeschooling in a way that doesn&#39;t<br/>
make rigid distinctions between schoolwork and the rest of life.<br/>
<br/>
At Growing Without Schooling magazine, we don&#39;t see unschooling as a<br/>
rigidly defined concept or approach. It&#39;s certainly not something you have<br/>
to think of as a package. Our advice to anyone reading these questions<br/>
is that you don&#39;t have to think in terms of &quot;being unschoolers&quot; or &quot;doing<br/>
unschooling.&quot; If any of the approaches described here appeal to you,<br/>
then by all means take the time to find out more, and adapt what you<br/>
read about so that it fits your family.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We are unschoolers and in our home there is a lot that is &quot;required&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Regular bathing and changing of the undies (Eeew), feeding the animals,<br/>
&gt; picking up after yourself, not eating too much junk, and so on and so on.<br/>
&gt; To say to be a &quot;true&quot; unschooler you can not have rules is simply<br/>
&gt; ludicrous. We&#39;re all different and if that works for you that&#39;s great!<br/>
That<br/>
&gt; would not work for us. If we didn&#39;t have rules at our home we&#39;d be living<br/>
&gt; in a filthy, piled up with junk to the ceiling home with no clean clothes<br/>
&gt; or dishes, no healthy food, and dead animals. That&#39;s not much of an<br/>
&gt; incentive for a change here, eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wonder about the unlimited tv viewing though, is it hours and hours<br/>
daily<br/>
&gt; because that&#39;s how your post came across to me. Are you watching it with<br/>
&gt; them and talking about what they&#39;re seeing?<br/>
&gt; This is JMHO and it works for me and mine - I do not allow unlmited tv for<br/>
&gt; the same reason I wouldn&#39;t drop a child at a strip bar. Not only are some<br/>
&gt; of the shows nasty but some commercials are also, I&#39;m not sure which are<br/>
&gt; worse! Don&#39;t get me wrong, we watch some tv but there is a limit to how<br/>
&gt; much and what is watched. Playing, reading, writing or staring at the wall<br/>
&gt; is preferable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I have to do away with all rules to be a &quot;real&quot; unschooler well, so be<br/>
&gt; it, it&#39;s just a label and I&#39;m not big on labels anyway  :-D<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t use the label &quot;unschooler&quot; anyway unless I&#39;m around other<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers so they know what &quot;style&quot; of homeschooling we do. The<br/>
general<br/>
&gt; public doesn&#39;t really have a clue what it means, and some homeschoolers<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t either. The label I normally use is &quot;home educator&quot;, which everyone<br/>
&gt; seems to understand, I am at home educating the next generation with my<br/>
&gt; words and actions. I dislike using &quot;homeschool&quot; because we do not &quot;school<br/>
&gt; at home&quot; but that&#39;s just my idiosyncrasy. I don&#39;t judge others who use<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; label, knowing it&#39;s just a general label that lumps us all together - the<br/>
&gt; school at homers, the unschoolers and everyone in between.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s our actions that show who we are, not our labels, wouldn&#39;t you agree?<br/>

&gt; That is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;in my and many other unschoolers opinions, not part of unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Interesting, but put me in the camp that says &quot;requiring them to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever&quot; could very well be unschooling just as much as anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; else. We&#39;re about as rabidly unschoolish as you can get, but there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are all kinds of things we require our kids to do. None of them<br/>
&gt; &gt; relate to education in the traditional sense of the word, but when<br/>
&gt; &gt; one doesn&#39;t separate learning from life, as we don&#39;t, where does one<br/>
&gt; &gt; draw the line?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just a little food for thought, since this list&#39;s been so quiet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

family is expected to look after the animals when it&#39;s you who wants <br/>
them.  In our family, I&#39;m the one who wanted the dog, so I&#39;m the one who <br/>
looks after him.  For several years, my son enjoyed entering chickens and <br/>
eggs in the Fall Fair, so he was (relatively) happy to look after <br/>
them.  When that interest grew old for him, I didn&#39;t mind taking over.  (We <br/>
would have had them anyway.)  I do ask him to do one small job every day, <br/>
and I often ask him to help me out with other stuff.  Considering that he&#39;s <br/>
14 &lt;g&gt; he&#39;s pretty good about it.<br/>

&gt;the preferences you have? (rhetorical question). We&#39;re just not big tv<br/>
&gt;watchers so it was never used as a babysitter and it never became a habit<br/>
&gt;to be broken.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is another one that I wondered about.  I don&#39;t remember the original <br/>
post, so I don&#39;t know whether you said you limited TV for your kids or <br/>
not.  But if you do, then who is it that prefers other things to TV <br/>
watching, you and dh or all of you?<br/>
<br/>
This TV thing keeps coming up, and I think it&#39;s important.  I&#39;ve always <br/>
been a TV hater.  I&#39;d live really happily without it.  We didn&#39;t have cable <br/>
for years, and dh and son went next door to the in-laws to watch.  I <br/>
thought it was great not having to listen to it.  So I really understand <br/>
where you&#39;re coming from if you don&#39;t like TV much.<br/>
<br/>
I had tried to limit TV for my son, but the availability of TV next door, <br/>
with grandparents who weren&#39;t willing to enforce any rules about it, made <br/>
that impossible.  (And dh wasn&#39;t any help.  He likes watching so much, he <br/>
moved his office over there, so he could watch while he did his <br/>
paperwork.)  I finally realized that not having to listen to the TV wasn&#39;t <br/>
worth having no real family life, so we recently got a TV and cable.  All <br/>
that just to say I&#39;m not a TV fan.<br/>
<br/>
But discussions on this list got me thinking about the whole TV issue, and <br/>
I had already come to the point where I felt that my son was obviously <br/>
getting something from TV.  I even started to realize how much he learns <br/>
from the TV, and he doesn&#39;t watch much stuff that&#39;s overtly <br/>
educational.  He&#39;s not a book-learner and probably never will be.  The TV <br/>
certainly isn&#39;t taking him away from books.  And it&#39;s not taking him away <br/>
from physical activity.  He&#39;s always majored in P.E.  &lt;g&gt;  He uses the <br/>
computer a lot, spends time with friends and family, builds things, works <br/>
for his dad sometimes, and generally lives a pretty well-balanced life <br/>
without the TV limits I would have liked to impose on him.<br/>
<br/>
I also understand that there are some kids (I&#39;d guess very few) who really <br/>
can&#39;t tear themselves away from the tube, no matter what.  (My <br/>
granddaughter *might* even be one of them.  I&#39;m not yet convinced.)  I can <br/>
agree that these kids probably need help with it.  But I hate to see that <br/>
as the first suggestion people get when they are concerned about the TV <br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like a new mother having breastfeeding problems and being told <br/>
first off that some women just aren&#39;t able to nurse their babies.  Now I <br/>
know it happens, but it&#39;s very rare if women are given correct advice about <br/>
breastfeeding.  I think it helps that new mother a lot more to help her go <br/>
through all the possibilities as to what&#39;s causing the problem before even <br/>
putting the idea into her mind that she might not be successful.  The same <br/>
with the TV issue.  I&#39;d love to see the people who are concerned about <br/>
their kids&#39; TV watching given all the kinds of suggestions I&#39;ve seen here <br/>
from time to time for helping their kids stay balanced, before they get <br/>
told that some kids just have to have it regulated.  Of course if the <br/>
parent has already tried all those things, she might be really relieved to <br/>
know that her kid might be one of those who requires help in limiting TV, <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t make sense to me to start there.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know where the definition changed from the original coiner of the term,<br/>
&gt; or why. But I do know that there is no clear cut definition that<br/>
&gt; determines one to be an unschooler or not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t agree with this statement. An original definition does not always<br/>
&gt; apply as time goes on.  I believe that an unschooler DOES NOT, require<br/>
&gt; school work, use a math curriculum in order to learn what is &quot;needed&quot;,<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; an idea of grade x means one learns about turtles in science, breaks down<br/>
&gt; life into subject matter when not required to for reporting purposes, or<br/>
&gt; believes that all children should learn how to read by x age. I believe<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; those examples are clear cut. I think it is possible to define it to an<br/>
&gt; extent, and beyond that, debate is healthy and productive to learning.<br/>
&gt;  &lt;&lt;And if someone wants to hone a<br/>
&gt; description based on their beleifs, they should coin a new term and stop<br/>
&gt; picking on the ones that follow the loose description of the orignial<br/>
&gt; work.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I should stop questioning? I should stop learning?<br/>
&gt; I should stop stating my beliefs? I can&#39;t stop picking on others becasue I<br/>
&gt; am not picking on them.<br/>
&gt; A new term. Hmmm.There are many terms that are used for this. Child led<br/>
&gt; learning, Natural learning, Interest led, Delight driven etc. etc.etc.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling seems to be the word in common usage so that is what I use.<br/>
&gt; After all, I can&#39;t just decide to call a banana a gliglybop and have<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; get an idea of what I&#39;m referring to.<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;BUT there are parents here that get lambasted for not adhering to a<br/>
&gt; certain policy on unschoolling, when in fact, there isn&#39;t one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, then why are we here? Aren&#39;t we here to talk about what unschooling<br/>
&gt; means to us? What we do all day, what our children do? Because my<br/>
perception<br/>
&gt; of unschooling is narrower than another&#39;s idea of unschooling, I shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; discuss or point out a way that is different because I may hurt someones<br/>
&gt; feelings? I don&#39;t believe everyone should think like I do, that would be a<br/>
&gt; very boring world with no differing opinions. Just consider what I have to<br/>
&gt; say, and treat me as if maybe, just maybe I could be talking with my heart<br/>
&gt; and offering a different viewpoint. Like I said before, give others the<br/>

From: Tia Leschke &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:leschke@...">leschke@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not trying to pick on you here, but I&#39;m wondering why the rest of the<br/>
&gt; family is expected to look after the animals when it&#39;s you who wants<br/>
&gt; them.  (snipped)<br/>
<br/>
No one said *I* wanted them (other than *my* dog which I&#39;ve had for 14yrs<br/>
whom *I* feed and water). That was the deal when we got them, &quot;They are not<br/>
mine and I will not be responsible for them, are you SURE about this?&quot; &quot;Oh,<br/>
yes!&quot;<br/>
:-)  I understand you don&#39;t know the whole situation and are just going on<br/>
assumptions. I don&#39;t feel picked on, you had a somewhat valid question. I<br/>
am curious though why, if you were unsure, you didn&#39;t ask who&#39;s animals<br/>
they were instead of assuming they were mine - an animal lover who gladly<br/>
looks after her own pet?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is another one that I wondered about.  I don&#39;t remember the original<br/>
&gt; post, so I don&#39;t know whether you said you limited TV for your kids or<br/>
&gt; not.  But if you do, then who is it that prefers other things to TV<br/>
&gt; watching, you and dh or all of you?<br/>
<br/>
Like I&#39;ve said before - tv is not a big part of our lives so tv viewing is<br/>
very limited. We do have certain shows we like to watch but if there&#39;s<br/>
something better to do, and there usually is, we miss them.<br/>
<br/>
I respond to a message on the list about parents who require things of<br/>
their children are not real unschoolers and it turns into the great debate<br/>
over tv. So why should our family be watching more tv, are you undercover<br/>
network executives trying to drum up viewers? LOL  Is business really that<br/>
bad? (chuckle)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This TV thing keeps coming up, and I think it&#39;s important.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
&gt; been a TV hater.  I&#39;d live really happily without it.  We didn&#39;t have<br/>
cable<br/>
&gt; for years, and dh and son went next door to the in-laws to watch.  I<br/>
&gt; thought it was great not having to listen to it.  So I really understand<br/>
&gt; where you&#39;re coming from if you don&#39;t like TV much.<br/>
<br/>
Just because tv isn&#39;t high on our list of priorities doesn&#39;t mean we hate<br/>
tv. If I hated it I wouldn&#39;t have it in my home. As for cable, the only<br/>
time I had it was for about 6 months when I had a roommate who ordered it.<br/>
Recently we had DirecTV from Sept &#39;01 to Jan &#39;02 so DH could get NFL Sunday<br/>
ticket. Everyone said &quot;oh, wait til Jan you won&#39;t be able to get rid of<br/>
it&quot;, were they ever wrong! LOL  Five channels are more than enough for us!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I had tried to limit TV for my son, but the availability of TV next door,<br/>
&gt; with grandparents who weren&#39;t willing to enforce any rules about it, made<br/>
&gt; that impossible.  (And dh wasn&#39;t any help.  He likes watching so much, he<br/>
&gt; moved his office over there, so he could watch while he did his<br/>
&gt; paperwork.)  I finally realized that not having to listen to the TV<br/>
wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; worth having no real family life, so we recently got a TV and cable.  All<br/>
&gt; that just to say I&#39;m not a TV fan.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But discussions on this list got me thinking about the whole TV issue,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I had already come to the point where I felt that my son was obviously<br/>
&gt; getting something from TV.  I even started to realize how much he learns<br/>
&gt; from the TV, and he doesn&#39;t watch much stuff that&#39;s overtly<br/>
&gt; educational.  He&#39;s not a book-learner and probably never will be.  The TV<br/>
&gt; certainly isn&#39;t taking him away from books.  And it&#39;s not taking him away<br/>
&gt; from physical activity.  He&#39;s always majored in P.E.  &lt;g&gt;  He uses the<br/>
&gt; computer a lot, spends time with friends and family, builds things, works<br/>
&gt; for his dad sometimes, and generally lives a pretty well-balanced life<br/>
&gt; without the TV limits I would have liked to impose on him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also understand that there are some kids (I&#39;d guess very few) who<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t tear themselves away from the tube, no matter what.  (My<br/>
&gt; granddaughter *might* even be one of them.  I&#39;m not yet convinced.)  I<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; agree that these kids probably need help with it.  But I hate to see that<br/>
&gt; as the first suggestion people get when they are concerned about the TV<br/>
&gt; issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s kind of like a new mother having breastfeeding problems and being<br/>
told<br/>
&gt; first off that some women just aren&#39;t able to nurse their babies.  Now I<br/>
&gt; know it happens, but it&#39;s very rare if women are given correct advice<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; breastfeeding.  I think it helps that new mother a lot more to help her<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; through all the possibilities as to what&#39;s causing the problem before<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; putting the idea into her mind that she might not be successful.  The<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; with the TV issue.  I&#39;d love to see the people who are concerned about<br/>
&gt; their kids&#39; TV watching given all the kinds of suggestions I&#39;ve seen here<br/>
&gt; from time to time for helping their kids stay balanced, before they get<br/>
&gt; told that some kids just have to have it regulated.  Of course if the<br/>
&gt; parent has already tried all those things, she might be really relieved<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; know that her kid might be one of those who requires help in limiting TV,<br/>
&gt; but it doesn&#39;t make sense to me to start there.<br/>
&gt; Tia<br/>
<br/>
Although not very good netiquette I left the last four paragraphs intact.<br/>
Is this directed at me? I&#39;m the only one you quoted.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any suggestions for you, especially now that it is a habit. It<br/>
has never been a common thing for us so I&#39;m totally no help, we&#39;ve never<br/>
been in the same boat. Maybe someone else here can help you if you&#39;d like<br/>
suggestions? I&#39;m not all that clear you&#39;re even asking for suggestions. You<br/>
start by sounding like you&#39;re defending (to whom I&#39;m not sure) your son&#39;s<br/>
tv watching, then switch to chastising someone who has given advice that<br/>
didn&#39;t work or you didn&#39;t like (unsure which), and then switch to wanting<br/>
suggestions. I&#39;m very sorry, try as I might I am unable to understand<br/>
clearly what it is you want. Perhaps it&#39;s too early in the morning and I&#39;m<br/>
just missing your point.<br/>
<br/>
As for your family/inlaw situation, I can&#39;t help with that either, I don&#39;t<br/>
get in the middle of family differences. DH and I are very lucky, though it<br/>
was no accident, that we have basically the same views on parenting,<br/>
child-rearing, and home life. Life is much more calm in our household than<br/>
some we know. I wish everyone could have that.<br/>
One suggestion (not a mandate) for any future children you have: spend lots<br/>
of time with them playing games, taking walks, reading together snuggled up<br/>
and leave the tv off if you dislike it so much. If they never get used to<br/>
it then it doesn&#39;t become a habit but rather another piece of furniture<br/>
that is used occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
FTR I have never said to anyone that children who watch tv need help with<br/>
tearing themselves away from it or even that parents must regulate tv.<br/>
I&#39;ve never told anyone what their family should or should not do regarding<br/>
tv. I would never presume to tell anyone how to rear their children, and I<br/>
would expect the same respect back. I do like asking questions, I&#39;m<br/>
naturally curious, and I do like to help whenever I can.<br/>
<br/>
You said that tv viewing is not taking your son away from books but for us<br/>
it would because we are all avid readers. This is just one difference<br/>
between in our families goes to show that what works for one family doesn&#39;t<br/>
work for another.<br/>
Good luck on your unschooling quest!<br/>

PS<br/>
Defending our choices as parents is not why I am on an &quot;unschooling&quot; list.<br/>
I do enough of that with everyone else, an unschooling group should be for<br/>
support and sharing ideas but that&#39;s JMHO. </span></blockquote></div>

You would have to spend about three hours reading the archives to <br/>
understand and it probably is not worth it.  TV is a hot button here. <br/>
 That coupled with the fact that occassionally, someone will misread <br/>
something because they have a preconceived notion of what a particular <br/>
poster thinks, causes this to flare occassionally.<br/>
