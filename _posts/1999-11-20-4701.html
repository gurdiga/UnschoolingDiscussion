<div id="ygrps-yiv-541022230">A profound observation<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
.&gt;&gt;A SOUND mind in a sound body, is a short but full description of a happy<br/>
state in this world: he that has these two, has little more to wish for; and<br/>
he that wants either of them, will be but little the better for any thing<br/>
else. Men&#39;s happiness or misery is most part of their own making. He whose<br/>
mind directs not wisely, will never take the right way; and he whose body is<br/>
crazy and feeble will never be able to advance in it. I confess there are<br/>
some men&#39;s constitutions of body and mind so vigorous and well framed by<br/>
nature that they need not much assistance from others but by the strength of<br/>
their natural genius they are from their cradles carried towards what is<br/>
excellent and by the privilege of their happy constitutions are able to do<br/>
wonders. But examples of these are but few; and I think I may say that, of<br/>
all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil,<br/>
useful or not, by their education. &#39;Tis that which makes the great<br/>
difference in mankind. The little, and almost insensible impressions on our<br/>
tender infancies, have very important and lasting consequences; and there<br/>
&#39;tis, as in the fountains of some rivers where a gentle application of the<br/>
hand turns the flexible waters into channels, that make them take quite<br/>
contrary courses, and by this little direction given them at first in the<br/>
source they receive different tendencies and arrive at last at very remote<br/>
and distant places.&lt;&lt;<br/>

These days a college degree is more a sign of conformity than intelligence.<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s in such high demand.</div>
