 </span></blockquote>yeah, the nature of a child is sure apparent very early, but i still have seen<br/>
that kids are highly adaptable, so nurture can&#39;t be so easily dismissed.  my son<br/>
tends to be fairly balanced; by nature he&#39;s happy both going and doing and<br/>
staying home, it all depends on his mood.  i think a balance can be had if needs<br/>
are met, though for each kid that will look different, but that&#39;s only my<br/>
theory.<br/>
<br/>
a kids nature, i feel, sets the foundation, but there&#39;s a lot that can be done<br/>
after that.  you may not be able (nor why would you want to) completely change<br/>
someone but you can sure help them not be a victim of their own nature, by<br/>
helping them to develop their nature in ways that can bring about real<br/>
happiness.<br/>
<br/>
if you have a child who is at the extremes, say, an introvert, you can expose<br/>
them slowly to more and more stimulus, but in small doses and in very safe ways,<br/>
meaning that their request to leave will be heeded.  it is also important to<br/>
watch and remove them when you see that stress is building.  then help them<br/>
learn how to release that stress, for the littlest one that could be crying, but<br/>
as they get older other things like talking, dancing, spinning in circles,<br/>
digging in the sand, whatever is appealing -everyone is different.  if the child<br/>
is excessively extroverted you can use things like music and low lights to help<br/>
them look a bit more inward and help them to not &#39;need&#39; to be so stimulated but<br/>
to do it out of pure enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m certainly not saying all children should have an equal desire to be quiet<br/>
(to look inward) and be stimulated (to look outward)- not at all - that would<br/>
make for a boring world.  what i am saying is that a child should be taught the<br/>
skills to make choices rather than be at the mercy of their natures.<br/>

&lt;&lt;i agree with everything you said.  i have a friend whose husband really <br/>
pushed<br/>
<br/>
her to be constantly &#39;doing & going&#39; with their daughter, since the time she<br/>
<br/>
was born, and now her daughter is always demanding to have external<br/>
<br/>
entertainment and is never really happy at home especially without some<br/>
<br/>
organized activity or friends visiting.  it made me think that too much <br/>
outside<br/>
<br/>
stimulation creates dependency on that stimulation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Susan -<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe the need to be constantly going and doing is more due to <br/>
&quot;nature&quot; than &quot;nurture&quot;.  That&#39;s because I have a quiet, thoughtful, <br/>
self-directing kid and my good friend&#39;s son (6 months older) has a totally <br/>
different temperament.  We&#39;ve known him for 5 nearly years, since he was 18 <br/>
months, and his mom said that even when he was a tiny infant, he was far <br/>
happier being taken places and carried around than he was at home.  He has a <br/>
really outgoing personality and seems born to be a politician, while it&#39;s <br/>
much easier to imagine my son as a scientist.  My friend&#39;s second child, a <br/>
girl, has more in common with my son, and doesn&#39;t have the same temperament <br/>
as her older brother.  She seems to have an introverts need for periods of <br/>
peace and quiet.  <br/>
<br/>
As an introvert, with an extroverted mom, I think a hectic lifestyle can make <br/>
an introverted kid miserable, but I doubt it would convert her to needing to <br/>
go out and be with people.  Your mileage may vary. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546394849">There is a book called &quot;Nurture by Nature&quot; by Tieger and Barron-Tieger<br/>
that discusses personality types and helps you use the information to be<br/>
a more responsive parent.  They use the Briggs-Meyers personality type.  <br/>
There is always danger of using this sort of thing to pigeon-hole people,<br/>
but I think it can be interesting to use as one more piece of the<br/>
parenting puzzle.<br/>

The darn trouble with cleaning the house is it gets dirty the next day<br/>
anyway,<br/>
so skip a week if you have to.  The children are the most important<br/>
thing.<br/>
