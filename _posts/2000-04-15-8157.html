 exceptionally tough for me to ever &quot;let my kids go&quot;.  Of course I want<br/>
 them to be healthy and happy and developed eventually, but it will be<br/>
 the saddest day of my life when it comes. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I just told my gf the other day on the phone that I will probably have to<br/>
have another child or two a bit later in life so that I can cope with my <br/>
oldest dd growing up and leaving home (although she promises me she<br/>
will come over every day : ) <br/>
