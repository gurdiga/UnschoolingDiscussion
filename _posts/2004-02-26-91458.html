<div id="ygrps-yiv-614381223">Hey everybody...I just got a gift certificate from Amazon.  I really should <br/>
spend it on myself (ha!), but also would really like some great homeschool <br/>
activity-type books.  My kids love it when I come up with some sort of <br/>
project to do together, like a fun science experiment.  Does anybody have <br/>
any book suggestions?  My kids are ages 3 and 4....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776966832">I just ordered a &quot;build a village&quot; and &quot;build a train&quot; books from Dover <br/>
Books, and my 4 and 6 year-olds are very excited. It&#39;s hard, though, for <br/>
them to wait for the glue to dry.<br/>
