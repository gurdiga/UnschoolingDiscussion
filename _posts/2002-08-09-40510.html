Those kids who ply the streets selling &quot;crap&quot; (as someone said) for the<br/>
public schools are being used to convince taxpayers in their towns that the<br/>
schools actually &quot;need&quot; more money than they have. It is part of the<br/>
child/parents indoctrination process and part of the constant selling of the<br/>
next year&#39;s school budget. (In my state, CT, each town collects property<br/>
taxes that pays the lion&#39;s share of school spending. A small percent is<br/>
income taxes collected by the state and returned from state coffers to the<br/>
local school districts)<br/>
<br/>
The little dears are told that their school can&#39;t provide for their proper<br/>
education because the taxpayers are refusing to raise the budgets. They<br/>
choose a catagory, say band instruments, and the kids are sent door to door<br/>
selling something that nobody needs, and they raise a little, or a lot of<br/>
money. The little dears are made to believe that they are victims of greedy<br/>
residents and stingy taxpayers. It&#39;s part of the anti-community,<br/>
self-alienation routine.<br/>
<br/>
They can use it as one more excuse for their failure to educate those kids.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the school folks can ALWAYS find something that they are lacking -- so<br/>
can everybody -- and then claim they need money for it. This is the process<br/>
of keeping the public pre-occupied with the public schools. It not only<br/>
helps to keep the kids&#39; time totally controlled by the schools, but it<br/>
includes the parents and all other residents. They run one scam after<br/>
another keeping the ball rolling for school employees.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose is Public Relations for next year&#39;s outrageous budget that<br/>
includes pay increases for two or three times as many employees as are<br/>
needed to run a decent school. (In my community, there is one employee for<br/>
every 6.15 children.)<br/>

Ned, I&#39;m guessing you were never in band.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The fundraising money goes to extras, and you KNOW that, but you will use <br/>
anything, won&#39;t you, to fuel the fire people have asked you to stop flaming <br/>
here?<br/>
