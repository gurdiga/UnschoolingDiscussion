That&#39;s too bad. What you describe above is a big inhibitor to creativity. I have kept all papers, pens, crayons, glue, tape, string etc... at a reachable level for all of my children. Sure, we&#39;ve had some writing on walls here and there (Sierra wrote all over her door last week...she&#39;s 7, it&#39;s HER room so why not?) but they learn very quickly where it upsets people to write and where you have free reign.

I suppose I value creative expression more than I value perfect walls though. There is nothing a child can do with art supplies on my walls that can&#39;t be fixed. I don&#39;t see what the big deal is.<br/>

Once they&#39;re really and truly done then he can take them apart and see how they&#39;re made. Broken crayons still colour. they can be melted into new rainbow coloured, chunky crayons or shaved with a knife. the shavings can be put between two pieces of wax paper, a cloth over that and then apply a hot iron to melt the shaving. You&#39;re left with a beutiful suncatcher. <br/>
  Buy cheap markers and crayons for when they&#39;re young and want to experiment. My daughter is about to turn 6 and we&#39;re just getting into purchasing really good quality supplies but until now i bought those supplies understanding they would dry out or get broken.

I&#39;m not sure what to think of privlidges. To me they sound like something you dangle over a kids head for good behaviour, too much like rewards. I can&#39;t fit privledges into the context of my life right now. My daughter has scissors privlidges I guess but simply because she went and used them, not because I deemed she was ready. My two year old has outlet privledges but simply because he went and learned how to plug stuff in not because I deemed him mature enough. I suppose the difference may be that I watch my kids take on new responsibilities and &#39;priviledges&#39; as they themselves decide they&#39;re ready and able and you prefer to issue them as you see them conform to your idea of maturity? That sounds snarky I know and apologize but I can&#39;t think of another way to phrase it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>========================<br/>
<br/>
Wow! I&#39;m just jaw-dropping amazed at that! I bet mixing play-doh colors was<br/>
a problem too. I never understand people who don&#39;t let kids mix the play-doh<br/>
colors. *shaking my head sadly*<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 6, 5 and recently 4. Of course the crayons get broken and the<br/>
caps get left off the markers. I gently remind them that the markers dry out<br/>
and aren&#39;t useful anymore when I throw them away, but we get new ones<br/>
periodically. Crayons cost all of $3 to replace, maybe $5 for the really big<br/>
set, I don&#39;t remember. And it&#39;s always so much fun to get a new set!<br/>
Play-doh, I pick up on sale for $1 a 4 pack, and there&#39;s nothing like soft,<br/>
new play-doh. I can&#39;t imagine getting upset because the crayons are getting<br/>
broken!<br/>
<br/>
We also buy quality art supplies, which are just as accessible as the<br/>
crayola stuff. We have a great art supply store in Georgetown that I just<br/>
*love* to walk through. We have oil pastels, chalk pastels, 24 color<br/>
watercolor set, sculpey clay, tempera paints, origami paper, tissue paper,<br/>
etc. I have asked them to be a bit more careful with the watercolors by<br/>
wiping their brush on a paper towel to keep the colors true, but that&#39;s<br/>
mostly because I was painting with them too. They have several other<br/>
watercolor sets when they want to mix the colors together. We also had fun<br/>
figuring out how to mix the colors purposely on the plastic lid.<br/>
<br/>
Scissors, too, are stored right along with the art supplies and have been<br/>
for at least 2 years here, probably more. There have been a couple of times<br/>
when my youngest lost privileges for a little while until he was ready to<br/>
try again (which he determined, not me)--like the time he cut his sister&#39;s<br/>
hair or his shirt. We just talked about things that were appropriate for<br/>
cutting and I told him to let me know when he was ready to try again. Those<br/>
are the only scissor incidents I can think of. We also had a brief period a<br/>
couple of years ago when the crayons got put up for a little while only to<br/>
be brought down when I was nearby because he drew on the walls, the<br/>
furniture, the carpet, the washing machine, the keyboard and the computer<br/>
monitor--not all at once but in a series of attacks. *g* He helped me clean<br/>
up the slippery and easy to wipe surfaces. The keyboard never came clean; we<br/>
just eventually inherited a new one. And the monitor forever had wax<br/>
remnants in a ghost pattern of the original artwork. But he soon got over<br/>
that as well. (They used to have an art table in the laundry room just off<br/>
the family room before I moved everything upstairs to the kitchen where they<br/>
had far more room to spread out, which may have had something to do with it,<br/>
too.)<br/>
<br/>
I just think this is part of having kids, you know? Gosh, kids need to be<br/>
kids. They need room to explore and test their boundaries, and they need a<br/>
gentle, loving adult to help them understand what kinds of things work and<br/>
what don&#39;t, which includes replacing broken crayons and dried out markers,<br/>
cleaning up lots of messes and encouraging them to explore in as many<br/>
appropriate ways as possible.<br/>

useable with *making* a child keep them useable or *controling* a child to<br/>
prevent him from making his things unuseable.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a child who couldn&#39;t put the caps on the markers or might scatter<br/>
them everywhere, I might keep markers on top of the refrigerator too. But it<br/>
would be because I would assume my child wanted to take care of things but<br/>
just couldn&#39;t understand how yet.<br/>
<br/>
The actions might look the same, but the motivations and reactions would be<br/>
very different if I was always thinking of ways to make art fun for her (eg,<br/>
have markers that weren&#39;t dried out) rather than thinking in ways to protect<br/>
the markers and protect the house.<br/>
<br/>
There might be times she wanted to do something that I didn&#39;t have time to<br/>
help with at the moment, but my answer shouldn&#39;t be no. It should be let&#39;s<br/>
figure out how to make this work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our house just couldn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nor can most of our homes. And yet we find ways to put the child first *and*<br/>
keep things useable *and* not turn it into an issue of control over the<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The point is you can&#39;t expect little ones to be responsible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The point is not to expect them to be more responsible than they are capable<br/>
of. Do for them what they&#39;d want to do but can&#39;t while making the world as<br/>
accessible as they want and need.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We like to<br/>
&gt; have our son gain privileges as he is mature enough to handle them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I like to let my daughter know that I trust her to do what&#39;s right<br/>
within her capacity to do so, not set up the atmosphere so she feels she<br/>
needs to prove to me she can be trusted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847846919">We&#39;ve got all that stuff too. LOTS of legos and Rokenbok and Thomas <br/>
the tank engine and playmobil.  Like 6 different sets of domino <br/>
rally.  Micro machine cars and sets.   Quite frankly, our house is <br/>
always a mess &#39;cause this stuff is always out!  But they would lose <br/>
so much creativity and fun and learning if they didn&#39;t have access to <br/>
their stuff all the time.  My boys are 6 and 4 and have always had <br/>
access to all the craft stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
When stores have back to school sales, crayola markers usually go on <br/>
sale for under a dollar.  You can stock up on a lot of markers at <br/>
that price, and then if a marker gets dried out, you&#39;ve got another <br/>
to replace it.  Also, a tip we learned at the crayola factory is that <br/>
you can revive a marker one time by soaking it in warm water for a <br/>
little while.  I think 30 seconds.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never had much of a problem with broken crayons, even when <br/>
they&#39;re left out.  And we bought the crayola crayon maker, which is a <br/>
LOT of fun.  We collect crayons that do get broken and make new <br/>
crayons out of them. <br/>
<br/>
I do ask them to play with the play doh in the kitchen and <br/>
diningroom, which are the non-carpeted rooms, and I always make sure <br/>
I sweep the floors really well when they&#39;re done playing because I <br/>
don&#39;t want play doh to get ground into the carpet.  But if it ever <br/>
would get ground into the carpet...I&#39;d rather them have constant <br/>
access to play doh than have great carpet.  <br/>
<br/>
Once Matt drew a picture on the wall with a crayola marker.  A big <br/>
purple smiley face.  I had planned on buying a frame at the store to <br/>
put on top of it, and write his name and the date he did it right <br/>
beside it, but I didn&#39;t get around to doing it right away and the <br/>
marker started fading on its own after awhile.  I was sad that it <br/>
faded off the wall like that, because I thought the frame idea would <br/>
have been cute. :) <br/>
<br/>
Btw, those magic erasers that are out are GREAT at getting marker, <br/>
crayons, etc.  off of things.  They&#39;re great at getting a lot of <br/>
stuff clean, like those little grooves in the refrigerator.  They do <br/>
take stain off though, so I don&#39;t recommend using them on things that <br/>
have a stained finish.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342488300">LOL  This reminds me when my son was learning to write his letters.  He was<br/>
about three and wrote a great big &quot;A&quot; on the back of the couch in magic<br/>
marker.  I didn&#39;t even try to clean it.  I purposely didn&#39;t buy new<br/>
furniture because I knew I would just get upset when it got ruined.<br/>
<br/>
My house is definitely lived in but I do like things to be neat and orderly.<br/>
I don&#39;t like to clean and my husband doesn&#39;t have time so we have taught our<br/>
son from the beginning to pick up after himself.  I have health problems and<br/>
when he was born I wasn&#39;t able to walk, so I wanted him to be independent.<br/>
It drives my mother crazy.  She thinks he is too independent.<br/>
<br/>
He is a big help to me when I need him to be.  The other issue with crayons<br/>
and things on the floor is the danger of me falling.  Since my back surgery<br/>
I&#39;m not too steady on my feet and a fall could land me permanently disabled.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to consider only his creativity but we all must live<br/>
together in confined quarters so sacrifices must be made.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired of this subject now.  I had no idea my comments would illicit such<br/>
controversal responses.  I&#39;m going back to my corner now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really.   What does your son like?<br/>
<br/>
In our house, I do the cooking and dh does the cleaning.  Been that way<br/>
since we met about 20 years ago.  Dh is a neat freak, constantly cleaning<br/>
and wiping and puting away as he does things.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to enjoy the moment.  I don&#39;t clean up anything as I go, leaving that<br/>
to the end.  So with our meal prep arrangements, dh gets left with a pretty<br/>
heft mess.  Sometimes I pitch in, sometimes I do it for him, sometimes I go<br/>
take a nap.<br/>
<br/>
I guess he could relieve me of the priviledge of cooking until I learned<br/>
responsibility (i.e., do it his way) but he prefers to treat me as a fully<br/>
functioning human who simply organized their life differently from him.<br/>

Subject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] wallpaper peelers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The problem wasn&#39;t the walls being my major concern.  The problem was that<br/>
&gt; we had tons of the stuff, and the caps would get left off the markers,<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; become useless, the crayons would be broken, etc...  He had bins with tons<br/>
&gt; of things to be creative that wouldn&#39;t get damaged if they weren&#39;t picked<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; right at that moment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He was always playing with Lego&#39;s, building blocks, lincoln logs, marble<br/>
&gt; towers and his personal favorite was the rockenbok.  We invested over<br/>
$3,000<br/>
&gt; in it and it would take up most of the room.  Our house just couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; accommodate having everything accessible to him at all times.  So we kept<br/>
&gt; the craft stuff, play dough, paper, etc... up and out of the way when he<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; little (3-4).  He&#39;s seven now and is more responsible and has complete<br/>
&gt; access to craft things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The point is you can&#39;t expect little ones to be responsible.  We like to<br/>
&gt; have our son gain privileges as he is mature enough to handle them.<br/>
Having<br/>
&gt; access to scissors is one of those.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s too bad. What you describe above is a big inhibitor to creativity.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have kept all papers, pens, crayons, glue, tape, string etc... at a<br/>
&gt; reachable level for all of my children. Sure, we&#39;ve had some writing on<br/>
&gt; walls here and there (Sierra wrote all over her door last week...she&#39;s 7,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s HER room so why not?) but they learn very quickly where it upsets<br/>
&gt; people to write and where you have free reign. Heck, crayon comes off<br/>
walls<br/>
&gt; easily enough.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve had VERY little problems in the way of mess, but when they start<br/>
&gt; getting out supplies, I&#39;m right there with them most of the time. The fact<br/>
&gt; that they have freedom to use the supplies when and where they choose is<br/>
&gt; critical in encouraging creativity.<br/>
&gt; I suppose I value creative expression more than I value perfect walls<br/>
&gt; though. There is nothing a child can do with art supplies on my walls that<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t be fixed. I don&#39;t see what the big deal is.<br/>

now, my kids have always had access to them (they&#39;re 4.5 and 7.5 <br/>
now). Also, my sharp kitchen scissors are always on the holder on the <br/>
counter. When the kids have been tall enough to reach them, they have <br/>
always used them responsibly, though I had to show them how to carry <br/>
them safely. That reminds me of when &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; came out, a <br/>

lyrics:<br/>
<br/>
Now when the paint jar tipped off of the table <br/>
You watched as it started to fall. <br/>
Glass popped, shattered and splattered. <br/>
The paint spray hit the wall. <br/>
<br/>
Bright blue glossy enamel, <br/>
Across the kitchen floor. <br/>
You said &quot;Good God, look at that pattern, <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen that before.&quot; <br/>

Never mind the turpentine. <br/>
Just leave it like it is, <br/>
It&#39;s fine. <br/>
<br/>
When the paint dried you gave it a title <br/>
You called it Kitchen Blue. <br/>
A white frame painted around it, <br/>
And gallery lighting too. <br/>
<br/>
Rich folks come over to dinner <br/>
They all want one of their own. <br/>
They say &quot;How much?&quot; &quot; Who is the artist?&quot; <br/>
And &quot;My, what a beautiful home.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Leave it like it is. <br/>
Never mind the turpentine. <br/>
Just leave it like it is, <br/>
It&#39;s fine. <br/>
<br/>
Most folks suffer in sorrow, <br/>
Thinking they&#39;re just no good. <br/>
They don&#39;t match the magazine model, <br/>
As close as they think they should. <br/>
<br/>
They live just like the paint-by-numbers <br/>
The teacher would be impressed. <br/>
A lifetime of follow the lines, <br/>
So they&#39;re just like all of the rest. <br/>
<br/>
Leave it like it is. <br/>
Never mind the turpentine. <br/>
Just leave it like it is, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297757194">Hmmmm, my boys are 2 1/2 and 5 1/2 (that half is really important to both of them) and they are responsible. They both love to paint, color, stamp,  cut and glue. We have asked them to do the really messy stuff in the kitchen, where I can clean up the mess easier. (We have very light colored carpet in most of the house) They don&#39;t have a problem with this, the kitchen is fine with them. <br/>
<br/>
They have access to all the art and crafty stuff they want, even scissors. Avery(2) has me do most of his cutting, because it&#39;s hard for him to use the texured ones. Jaiden will spend hours cutting stuff up and gluing it to paper. I can&#39;t imagine limiting his access to them.<br/>

Why do you think they can&#39;t be responsible?<br/>

I also think that broken crayons are easier for little hand to use. Avery(2) likes to break them into 3-4 pieces per crayon and Jaiden, when he still breakes them, just breaks them in half.<br/>

We also save all of our broken crayons and melt them between wax paper. It&#39;s soooo pretty!<br/>

he&#39;s upset that I&#39;ve left the room--like for 3 minutes to get the <br/>
laundry. The Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is amazing for getting crayon <br/>
off, but since he doesn&#39;t seem to miss having the black crayon, it <br/>
seems to have worked out to put it away for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
When he was 1 y o, we taught him how to use the remote control, which <br/>
shocked some of our friends and family. My dd, now almost 1.5, has to <br/>
be kept away from the remotes because she chews on them and has <br/>
already ruined 2! <br/>
<br/>
My son talks almost constantly, so except for the black crayons, I <br/>
usually know if/when he&#39;s doing something destructive. Caroline is <br/>
sooo quiet about it, though. I&#39;ve learned that if she&#39;s playing <br/>
quietly and I can&#39;t see her hands and mouth, I need to run over and <br/>
see what she&#39;s doing. Lately it&#39;s been bugs and worms. We were all <br/>
outside and I noticed she was sitting still and with her back to <br/>
me...and there in her hand was the dead cicada with a big ant on it, <br/>
heading toward her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
I want to let her explore, but I&#39;m really not a bug person. How do <br/>
you deal with kids who want to touch, eat, squish, etc. bugs??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a hard one!  I&#39;m wondering if maybe everyone&#39;s wallpaper <br/>
answers would apply here, too?  Supervise, discuss, divert.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, she&#39;ll probably ingest a few, I&#39;m sure.  Touching, I&#39;d say, <br/>
is no big deal at all.  Squishing, I don&#39;t know.  I hate to see my <br/>
kids squash bugs unless they are in the bedrooms and we can&#39;t catch <br/>
them, then sadly, I don&#39;t care much.  I kinda figure though, that <br/>
there&#39;s not a whole lot you are going to be able to do about <br/>
squashing bugs outside.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as eating them, maybe she&#39;ll eat a few and decide they don&#39;t <br/>
taste very good at all and decide not to at anymore.  Maybe she&#39;ll <br/>
only eat one of each kind until she finds a favorite. HA!  Maybe one <br/>
will bite her lip and she won&#39;t touch or eat them anymore...though <br/>
she might want to squish them all then if a pang of revenge strikes! <br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
It would gross me OUT if one of my kids ate a bug.  Gag!  But, <br/>
people all over the world do it so I wouldn&#39;t exactly worry about it <br/>
in a safety way, I guess.  I&#39;m going to have to check that out...how <br/>
safe it is to eat bugs.  The only thing I can think of is to invest <br/>
in candy necklaces and give her one every time she heads out the <br/>
door.  Or some kind of food she can&#39;t resist...grape necklaces, <br/>
fruit kabobs, something!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe get her an ant farm she can observe inside?<br/>
<br/>
I can see where that would make a person crazy and ill, having a <br/>
child eat and squash bugs all the time.  Maybe someone else will <br/>
have a better idea.<br/>

I would never touch a dead thing either...until my daughter found a dead snake and was longing to touch it but insisted I do it first, so I did.

Try not to react! Take the bug, tell her its name and show her all the<br/>

tell her gently but firmly that bugs need to be cooked before they are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806273743">This reminds me of something  I said to our librarian a year or two ago.<br/>
&quot;The only problem with unschooling is -You have to pretend to  like Bugs !!&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m not crazy about  spiders  up close. The rest are ok. Dont want them on me but  will handle beetles and worms . I actually like worms, toads and snakes. My main focus was wanting to let the girls develop an interest if they wished without my phobias attached. <br/>
That said-when Kara was three she got so spider-phobic her  twin sister could control All the toys and the room by casually saying-I just saw a spider walk under that Barbie..LOL Worked for about a year. We  have gotten lots of bug books and videos  from the library.  I bought a couple of really neat books-one is Bugs of BC or something like it and another couple on butterflys.<br/>
What made them most comfortable with them  was helping put some in bug jars and the Magic School bus bug related videos. and just growing a little older. <br/>
Their latest  thing is to get plastic jars from the cupboard and put over any spider they see in their room. On the weekend they had five jars around their bedroom/playroom. Stephanie said they dont like the squishy stuff -they like it if they dry up when they die.<br/>
Early on I noticed their cousin would stamp on everthing in sight. I usually say bugs outside (except mosquitoes) live there-we dont bother them-except when we need worms for fishing (I know -double standards LOL) . Bugs inside   don&#39;t belong here so tough luck.WE very often call them to see an interesting moth-spider-bug-and they have magnifying glasses (good ones) and bug carriers if they want to collect some and let them go later.<br/>
Their Mother used to pick up spiders when she was crawling-before she learned to walk and crawl over to me with a big smile and a closed hand and Too often it was a big live spider or bug. she never was hesitant about them.<br/>
Sure wish we had fireflys here -they were such a good part of my summers in northern Ontario.<br/>
grace<br/>
in the BC Rockies where it is snowing again way up high on the peaks and drizzling down here.<br/>
And the girls and Allan are watching the new Lord of the Rings DVD.<br/>

&gt; a problem too. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, MAN! I had big trouble with that one!! I had to bite my tongue and sit on <br/>
my HANDS to keep from sorting the playdoh out into proper color containers! <br/>
It drove me NUTS to watch him smash all those colors into one big, brown blob! <br/>
LOL But, I managed! And when he was younger, he was thrilled to play with the <br/>
brown blob-divided up into separate containers with different color lids, <br/>
because there was too much brown for ONE container! LOL But, as he&#39;s gotten older <br/>
and gotten more playdoh as gifts, he is starting to put his colors together <br/>
more gently so that he can separate them when he&#39;s done and put them back in the <br/>
color-coordinated containers. And NOW, I&#39;m kinda sad that the care-free, <br/>
brown blob boy is growing up! ;~D But I&#39;m so very glad that I kept my <br/>
&quot;sorting/catagorising&quot; nature to myself and let him play the way HE wanted to-he still <br/>
loves playdoh! :~)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518918513">&lt;&lt;The problem wasn&#39;t the walls being my major concern.  The problem was that<br/>
we had tons of the stuff, and the caps would get left off the markers, then<br/>
become useless, the crayons would be broken, etc...  He had bins with tons<br/>
of things to be creative that wouldn&#39;t get damaged if they weren&#39;t picked up<br/>
right at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
He was always playing with Lego&#39;s, building blocks, lincoln logs, marble<br/>
towers and his personal favorite was the rockenbok.  We invested over $3,000<br/>
in it and it would take up most of the room.  Our house just couldn&#39;t<br/>
accommodate having everything accessible to him at all times.  So we kept<br/>
the craft stuff, play dough, paper, etc... up and out of the way when he was<br/>
little (3-4).  He&#39;s seven now and is more responsible and has complete<br/>
access to craft things.<br/>
<br/>
The point is you can&#39;t expect little ones to be responsible.  We like to<br/>
have our son gain privileges as he is mature enough to handle them.  Having<br/>
access to scissors is one of those.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is 4.5. She has had her own scissors for at least 2 years. She has<br/>
always had all her art stuff, including Sharpies, available to her. There<br/>
have been stains at times - but they have been learning moments for me about<br/>
what she understood. Now she knows where my sewing scissors are, as well as<br/>
the kitchen scissors, if she has something to cut that her scissors don&#39;t<br/>
handle. She is extremely careful. Wow, she has even learnt at last that she<br/>
should replace lids so that her markers, which I buy in bulk, don&#39;t dry out.<br/>
<br/>
Many of us live in tiny places - see the archives for huge numbers of<br/>
creative storage ideas once the priority is facilitating the child&#39;s diverse<br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
How mature do you have to be before your husband allows you to gain<br/>
privileges? <br/>
<br/>
You are keeping the expensive stuff out and worrying about crayons (a couple<br/>
of bucks for like 64) being broken? I think I&#39;m missing the unschooling<br/>
principles in your posts, as well as the common sense. <br/>
<br/>
Everything you post will be up for sometimes startlingly rigorous discussion<br/>
and dissection. Sometimes I find it actually scary to post, because of what<br/>
could happen. But it will help you expand your thinking. Everything is<br/>
critiqued because newbies and people considering unschooling, as well as<br/>
others further along the journey, are more helped by challenges to old ways<br/>
of thinking and acting and writing about learning and parenting, than any<br/>
amount of &quot;we all do things our own way, and that&#39;s fine&quot; drivel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670364810">My dh recently built a &quot;bug barn&quot; with wood and screening to house the<br/>
two Eastern Tent Caterpillars my daughter wanted to watch and feed.  She<br/>
came screaming into the bathroom yesterday yelling &quot;Crystal (the name<br/>
she gave to one of the caterpillars :-)) is making her cocoon!!&quot;  I ran<br/>
into the kitchen to look and, sure enough, she had a fine web of cocoon<br/>
going.  She or he (not sure if it&#39;s possible to tell - anyone else<br/>
know?) had attached to the top of the screen.  Pretty cool.  The other<br/>
caterpillar &quot;ran&quot; around the bug barn for a couple of hours before that<br/>
one (Princess Leana don&#39;t you know) began her(?) cocoon as well.  We<br/>
found out that it takes 3 weeks before they turn into moths.  We also<br/>
found out how they do it, which is gross and cool at the same time.<br/>
Kind of like how a group of cells knows how to form into a liver or a<br/>
heart, same thing.  The cells are inside the caterpillar which is just a<br/>
shell.  It basically turns into a ball of mush as the cells start to<br/>
clump together and reform themselves.  Too cool.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, you might consider this kind of box so your child can put a bug<br/>
in it and safely observe it.  My dd2 managed to &quot;pet&quot; hers to death.  So<br/>
we had to hold it for her and let her touch it &quot;easy&quot;.  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
squelch her enthusiasm, but I do want her to learn how to handle<br/>
something that is fragile (like bugs and animals, etc.) without killing<br/>
it.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t like spiders.  Period.  But during last summer a number of them<br/>
got between the screen and the window in the kitchen.  We just let them<br/>
stay - to the horror of most everyone that came to our house.  But we<br/>
could tap the glass and that would shake their web so they would come<br/>
flying out of nowhere.  It was an easy way for me to deal with the whole<br/>
spider issue and none of us actually wanted to touch it anyway LOL  We<br/>
got to see it eat and interact with other spiders, we didn&#39;t actually<br/>
see her lay her eggs but we saw the egg sacs and saw them hatch.  Plus,<br/>
with them being right against the glass you could take a magnifying<br/>
glass and get right up close.  Can&#39;t remember what kind they were but<br/>
they were big.  They left in the fall but it was cool to watch - course<br/>
we kept those windows closed last year &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think this sounds fascinating. I think that a thick layer of glass would<br/>
probably be enough for me to get over my not tooooo bad shudders. I grew up<br/>
in Sydney, Australia home to the most venomous spider - the Sydney<br/>
Funnelweb, so I was always wary of large ones, just in case. They can bite<br/>
through a sock btw.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is terrified to the point of instant scream and run of all flying<br/>
insects, even tiny gnats or fruit flies. I don&#39;t know why. But she does seem<br/>
interested in caterpillars and worms. I suspect that seeing her favorite<br/>
caterpillar become one of the loathed fliers would upset her. I also expect<br/>
that this will change in time.<br/>
