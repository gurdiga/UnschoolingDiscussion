<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468138384">Well a few weeks ago Shawn (4 on Oct 1st) told me he wanted to learn how to<br/>
ride a horse after we drove past a training facility where he saw older kids<br/>
riding. So today we went to check it out. He was VERY dissapointed that he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t get to ride today, but seemed to be even more excited about the<br/>
idea of riding and learning how to care for a horse. I&#39;m going to have to do<br/>
some juggling with money and with Shannon, who at 15 months is simply to<br/>
young to do any riding and too old to be willing to sit in a stroller and<br/>
watch, but he will get his lessons!! If he decides after only one or two<br/>
times that it&#39;s not for him then I feel it is more than worth the effort of<br/>
getting him there because his horizons have already been expanded to see and<br/>
experience something completely different. I dont&#39; consider us<br/>
pre-unschoolers--we are unschooling from the get go---Shawn has asked a few<br/>
times this week to work on his workbook...HIS idea. He probably spent an<br/>
hour 2x this week doing numbers and letters and started on drawing lines to<br/>
get him ready to actually write the letters. When he was tired of it he told<br/>
me and we stopped. When I&#39;m tired of something I stop....why is our society<br/>
so bent on preparing children for a life of hardship and no choices????  In<br/>
REAL life we as adults only do what we WANT to anyway. If we know what the<br/>
consequences are to not paying our taxes then we either CHOSE to pay or<br/>
not---This is life. Why make our children think that life is nothing but<br/>
forced work that has no relation to our life?<br/>
<br/>
MY neighbor told me her 6 yr old had 14 pages of work today, on the 2nd day<br/>
of school. My question was if he enjoyed it. She said evidently....but<br/>
why??? Why would a very active little boy enjoy sitting and working on<br/>
paper? and then get home to have mom tell him his m&#39;s were sloppy and needed<br/>
to practice those and vocabulary for another hour....I simply don&#39; t get<br/>
it:(<br/>
