<div id="ygrps-yiv-595975674">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and ask a couple of <br/>
questions!  I have been lurking with much interest for a while!  My <br/>
name is Tori and I have a daughter, Jade, who will be 3 in June.  We <br/>
live in New Brunswick, Canada.  I have been interested in <br/>
homeschooling her since she was born, but when I stumbled across the <br/>
idea of unschooling, I KNEW that was what I wanted to do.  I have alot <br/>
of faith in myself and Jade, and our ability to teach and learn from <br/>
each other... we have been doing that since she was born.  My real <br/>
concern is the &#39;authorities&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Here in NB, the laws are pretty good.  I would have to fill out some <br/>
forms for an exemption and have a meeting to discuss my plans.  Other <br/>
than that, there is no followup.  My question is, did anyone tell the <br/>
&#39;authorities&#39; that you were unschooling?  Or did you make up a <br/>
curriculum?  What if you didn&#39;t happen to do the things you said... <br/>
did you run into problems getting an exemption the following year? Am <br/>
I asking too many questions?  There are no support groups in my area <br/>
and I have done many internet searches to try to figure this out, but <br/>
to no avail!!!  If anyone could help me, I would really appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if any of you out there are in Canada and have any advice I <br/>
would be very grateful for that too!!<br/>
<br/>
This is an awesome group!!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and happy thoughts!<br/>
Love, Tori</div>

<br/>
You say &quot;interest-based learning&quot; and say books will be determined as needed, <br/>
in a unit-studies fashion, with weekly library visits (or extensive home <br/>
library, or whatever you want to say) and the child may choose from martial <br/>
arts, music, dance... (whatever classes are available, because they&#39;re <br/>
available even if your child doesn&#39;t take them---certainly schools list ALL <br/>
their available extra courses even though a kid might never get to take over <br/>
four or six of them).<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to describe &quot;the open classroom&quot; in total educationalese.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819877137">Hi Tori.  We are pretty far from you, Florida.  In our state we don&#39;t have to tell the authorities about our program.  We keep a log of &quot;educational activities&quot; and &quot;sample of student produced materials.&quot;  Everything they do falls into the &quot;educational activities&quot; and anything on paper that I can fit into a notebook, is a &quot;sample.&quot;  Once a year we get a certified teacher (my cousin) to evaluate this portfolio and submit the evaluation to the county.  I write our evaluation, which, since the state law says the teacher must review this portfolio to determine if the student has progressed, we only include that the teacher has reviewed the portfolio and feels the student has progressed.  That&#39;s all.  Some parents opt to have their children take standardized tests and submit the results in stead of the eval.  Luckily our state law is not too strict and seems to leave a lot of room for people to do what they want but some county officials can make it a <br/>
hassle, if they want.  Some states are more free than this and some are worse.  As long as the county schoolies (as I call them) leave me be and the state/federal laws don&#39;t change, I&#39;m happy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312540604">Hi Sandra!<br/>
Thanks for the advice!  I was afraid I was going to have to lie, and <br/>
pretend I was going to follow some pre-set curriculum.  I can see I <br/>
will have to be creative, but I can handle that!<br/>
<br/>
I think I have a little fear of the &#39;authorities&#39; telling me I&#39;m not <br/>
&#39;allowed&#39; to do this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805856385">Hi Ambersand!<br/>
Thanks for your reply.  The laws here seem to be okay, but since I&#39;ve <br/>
never dealt with them personally, I&#39;m afraid the reality may be quite <br/>
different from what it appears to be on paper.  (Well, on computer <br/>
screen.)  I have to go through subject by subject and say what topics <br/>
I plan to cover and how much time per day will be devoted to a <br/>
particular area.  Sometimes I just wish I could be responsible for my <br/>
own child, no questions asked.  But I guess they are worried about <br/>
neglect.  What did I see somewhere?  The dept. of health doesn&#39;t knock <br/>
on your door to see if you are feeding your children correctly!  Oh <br/>
well... sometimes I just have a bit of a hard time being the <br/>
non-mainstream person I am turning out to be!!!<br/>

&gt;   screen.)  I have to go through subject by subject and say what <br/>
topics <br/>
&gt;   I plan to cover and how much time per day will be devoted to a <br/>
&gt;   particular area.  Sometimes I just wish I could be responsible for <br/>
my <br/>
&gt;   own child, no questions asked.  But I guess they are worried about <br/>
&gt;   neglect.  What did I see somewhere?  The dept. of health doesn&#39;t <br/>
knock <br/>
&gt;   on your door to see if you are feeding your children correctly!  <br/>
Oh <br/>
&gt;   well... sometimes I just have a bit of a hard time being the <br/>
&gt;   non-mainstream person I am turning out to be!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Peace<br/>
&gt;   Love, Tori<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Hi Tori.  We are pretty far from you, Florida.  In our state we <br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t have to tell the authorities about our program.  We keep a <br/>
log <br/>
&gt;   of &quot;educational activities&quot; and &quot;sample of student produced <br/>
&gt;   materials.&quot;  Everything they do falls into the &quot;educational <br/>
&gt;   activities&quot; and anything on paper that I can fit into a notebook, <br/>
is a <br/>
&gt;   &quot;sample.&quot;  Once a year we get a certified teacher (my cousin) to <br/>
&gt;   evaluate this portfolio and submit the evaluation to the county.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt;   write our evaluation, which, since the state law says the teacher <br/>
must <br/>
&gt;   review this portfolio to determine if the student has progressed, <br/>
we <br/>
&gt;   only include that the teacher has reviewed the portfolio and feels <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   student has progressed.  That&#39;s all.  Some parents opt to have <br/>
their <br/>
&gt;   children take standardized tests and submit the results in stead <br/>
of <br/>
&gt;   the eval.  Luckily our state law is not too strict and seems to <br/>
leave <br/>
&gt;   a lot of room for people to do what they want but some county <br/>
&gt;   officials can make it a <br/>
&gt;   &gt; hassle, if they want.  Some states are more free than this and <br/>
some <br/>
&gt;   are worse.  As long as the county schoolies (as I call them) leave <br/>
me <br/>
&gt;   be and the state/federal laws don&#39;t change, I&#39;m happy.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Hi everyone!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; I just wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and ask a <br/>
couple <br/>
&gt;   of  questions!  I have been lurking with much interest for a <br/>
while!  <br/>
&gt;   My  name is Tori and I have a daughter, Jade, who will be 3 in <br/>
June.  <br/>
&gt;   We  live in New Brunswick, Canada.  I have been interested in  <br/>
&gt;   homeschooling her since she was born, but when I stumbled across <br/>
the  <br/>
&gt;   idea of unschooling, I KNEW that was what I wanted to do.  I have <br/>
alot <br/>
&gt;   of faith in myself and Jade, and our ability to teach and learn <br/>
from <br/>
&gt;   each other... we have been doing that since she was born.  My real <br/>
 <br/>
&gt;   concern is the &#39;authorities&#39;.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Here in NB, the laws are pretty good.  I would have to fill out <br/>
some <br/>
&gt;   forms for an exemption and have a meeting to discuss my plans.  <br/>
Other <br/>
&gt;   than that, there is no followup.  My question is, did anyone tell <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   &#39;authorities&#39; that you were unschooling?  Or did you make up a  <br/>
&gt;   curriculum?  What if you didn&#39;t happen to do the things you <br/>
said...  <br/>
&gt;   did you run into problems getting an exemption the following year? <br/>
Am <br/>
&gt;   I asking too many questions?  There are no support groups in my <br/>
area <br/>
&gt;   and I have done many internet searches to try to figure this out, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt;   to no avail!!!  If anyone could help me, I would really appreciate <br/>
&gt;   it!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Also, if any of you out there are in Canada and have any advice <br/>
I  <br/>
&gt;   would be very grateful for that too!!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; This is an awesome group!!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Peace and happy thoughts!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Love, Tori<br/>

<br/>
HSLDA might, if you tried to sign on with them, but I don&#39;t know of any state <br/>
(even Pennsylvania) in which unschoolers haven&#39;t figured out a way to fulfill <br/>
the law AND unschool.<br/>
