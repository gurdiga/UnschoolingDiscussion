<div id="ygrps-yiv-544016401">hi faith,<br/>
i am curious about a few more things.  ( i asked you the other question about <br/>
child-centered parenting on the list)  to let you know where i am coming <br/>
from, let me explain.  i am a child of a retired la leche league leader (dr. <br/>
sears, nursing on demand, loving guidance discipline, etc) and have happily <br/>
raised my babies the same way.  i am also a Christian and believe my <br/>
parenting style is supported by Scripture, as you do.  since this is one of <br/>
those issues that people get heated about, i dont often pursue a discussion <br/>
about it with the people that i know who have mentioned this method in real <br/>
face to face.  maybe i should but i have been uncomfortable thinking that <br/>
they may assume i am criticizing them personally or that i am interested in <br/>
trying it out-- neither of which is the case!  i thought maybe since you <br/>
didnt shy away from all the heat on the list you would be willing to explain <br/>
over email the way that you see a few things.  just to satisfy my <br/>
wonderment!!  <br/>
<br/>
first:  you wrote: &lt;&lt;Although I certainly do not feed-on-demand&gt;&gt;  <br/>
i wonder, what does your view see that is so shockingly wrong with following <br/>
the cues that God has given the baby to tell us of her needs?<br/>
<br/>
and second:  &lt;&lt;But I always compare it to what Scripture has to say.&gt;&gt;  <br/>
since Scripture can be so easily used out of context to suit the defender, on <br/>
whose interpretation do you rest your trust?<br/>
<br/>
thanks for sharing,<br/>

Please don&#39;t take my silence as if I am not going to answer.  I am just trying to<br/>
get my info together in order to answer your questions adequately. :-)  Thanks<br/>

   I told Marty, when he was in that phase, that he needed not to be a<br/>
   bullshitter and if he was just going to make stuff up pretty soon people<br/>
   wouldn&#39;t have faith in his word, and since I didn&#39;t want him to have to <br/>
undo<br/>
   a bad reputation I wanted him to start ONLY saying things he could back <br/>
with<br/>
   fact, starting right then.<br/>
<br/>
   He took it okay. &quot;<br/>

Sandra, I don&#39;t post much but I enjoy your ruthlessly candid contributions. <br/>
I thought this was kind of a funny look at &quot;what it would be like to have <br/>
Sandra for your mom&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
When my kids ask me questions, I often respond by asking them to tell me <br/>
what THEY think.  Sometimes they know the answers already.  Other times, <br/>
they want to know something other than what they&#39;ve asked. A question about <br/>
where the dinosaurs went or why does John&#39;s dad not live with him any more <br/>
might really be a way to get into a larger topic.  If you always supply the <br/>
facts right away, or find an encyclopedia and point out how wrong-headed <br/>
their ideas are,  you might be shutting down discussion. Instead, if you <br/>
say, &quot;what do YOU think? ... Really?&quot; you can often have an illuminating <br/>
talk.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to be obstructionist... if Tony were trying to add up a bunch <br/>
of numbers and just asked me a series of addition facts, for instance, or <br/>
how to spell words, I wouldn&#39;t respond with a question more than once.<br/>
<br/>
For example with my kids, 9 and 5, if they ask how much money I earn (which <br/>
comes up from time to time), I sometimes respond by asking what they think I <br/>
earn. Their response gives me a way to frame my answer in a manner that <br/>
makes sense to them. If outright contradiction makes you crazy, this might <br/>
avert it.<br/>
<br/>
But if kids really want to know what YOU think, they&#39;ll insist you tell <br/>
them.<br/>

Some people are so afraid of a bad guess that this would shut down <br/>

I&#39;d rather answer directly and THEN try to figure out what they want to know, <br/>

Yeah.  Well... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Close friends, too.  They are in constant peril of a candid analysis if they <br/>
ask me anything.<br/>
On the other hand, too many people in the world have not one single source <br/>
for analysis, candid or otherwise, and are just muddling along.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077648203">Funny that this topic came up...on our way to church (we just started going to a UU<br/>
church and are really enjoying it), Jason (5.5 yo) started saying that<br/>
&quot;4+1=5, right?&quot;,  &quot;5+1=6, right?&quot;, &quot;6+1=7, right?&quot; When we got out of the car, he asked if<br/>
I knew what 7+5 was. I replied &quot;what is it?&quot;. He said 12 and I said &quot;you&#39;re right!&quot;.<br/>
He got this strange look on his face and then asked me &quot;If you knew what the answer<br/>
was, why didn&#39;t you say so?&quot;. I asked him if he really had wanted me to answer him<br/>
and he said yes. I apologized and told him that next time I would give him the answer.<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about this and I realized that when I was little, I asked my mom these<br/>
types of questions to show off what I knew. My mom was very much the type that if I <br/>
asked a question, like how to spell something, she would tell me to go look it up.<br/>
It was very eye-opening to realize that Jason was really curious to know if I knew<br/>
the answer! It was not to show off for me...kind of cool that he does not feel the<br/>
need to perform....also pretty cool that he was just pondering how numbers combine<br/>
because he wanted to. This topic came out of the blue while we were driving. :o)<br/>

son was so excited that he would get to learn how to read next year in <br/>
1st grade. And then there was the time at the pool when Jason used a<br/>
word (can&#39;t remember what it was) and a boy (who was about 8 or 9) looked<br/>
at me and asked where he learned that because it was a was a word that <br/>
he should not learn until 2nd grade. sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I love that when we were up on ebay today (looking for Bionicles), he <br/>
wanted to figure out how much the bid was and asked about the numbers, so <br/>
we talked about how the decimal point divided the dollars and the cents. I <br/>
love that when I was following directions to the pumpkin farm, I set my trip <br/>
odometer to track the mileage and he wanted to know what it was tracking and we <br/>
wound up talking about tenths of a mile. I love that when he was playing around <br/>
with a calculator he got a negative number and wanted to know what the line in <br/>
front meant. And that the next day he was still asking questions about it. I <br/>
love the way his mind works and that he just ponders these things. <br/>

<br/>
I had learned to write my name in cursive before I went to school.<br/>
<br/>
I got in trouble for doing it.  Trouble to the extent that the teacher told <br/>
me not to do it anymore, to print.  And I had to erase it and re-write my <br/>
name in printing.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby went to a party Saturday night.  He only knew the hostess, from his <br/>
karate class.  It was from 6:00 to 10:00, and his dad picked him up right on <br/>
the button.<br/>
<br/>
It was a Halloween party, he had been told.  He was one of two people in <br/>
costume.  He had dressed as a medieval king.  He had his dad&#39;s broadsword.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked him later how it had gone.  He said the kids were all very much <br/>
schoolkids.  They didn&#39;t talk about much of anything, and that each seemed to <br/>
have one small narrow role in the group.  The one who was the toughest guy, <br/>
the bully of the group, mentioned more than once, to Kirby and about him, <br/>
that Kirby could probably kick his ass.  <br/>
<br/>
Great.  So there he was, over-dressed, over-dimensional, and assured that he <br/>
was out-alphaing the alpha male.  Not much to say or do at that point.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith said when he went in that the kids were sitting around watching a <br/>
dog-training show on TV.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I put this on the &quot;questions&quot; topic, but it really did just <br/>
seem to flow.  <br/>
<br/>
There are so many questions and answers in the world that we can answer <br/>
directly and ask some really gloriously thought-provoking questions.  We <br/>
don&#39;t need to practice conservation in conversation.<br/>

<br/>
Your sister is a cold woman! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to tell a story so I can make a point.  Sorry.  It happens. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine teaches a  martial arts form with a long lineage, and he&#39;s <br/>
involved in all directions, with his teachers, and his own students, and his <br/>
fellow students.  There are annual get-togethers, people come a long way.<br/>
<br/>
One of the rules is you promise not to share what happens within the school <br/>
with those outside.  It&#39;s to be taught only through the tradition, through <br/>
the lineage, and they sign an oath.<br/>
<br/>
One guy wrote a book.  Told all KINDS of stuff.  It was fiction, but was just <br/>
practically snapshot moments, quotes, details.    The other high-level <br/>
students thought the teacher would boot him right out, gone.  He didn&#39;t.  <br/>
They asked about it.  The teacher just shook his head like no, it was no big <br/>
deal.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what happened:  the teacher never gave him any useful information <br/>
again.  When he would learn a technique, the teacher would say &quot;Good!&quot; and <br/>
walk on by.  Everything he did, no matter how crappy, got &quot;good.&quot;  No more <br/>
actually useful information, ever again.  He kept taking his money, kept <br/>
letting him come to class, didn&#39;t make a scene.   Eventually the guy figured <br/>
it out and quit, embarrassed.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the meanest things I could do would be to tell some people &quot;Oh, that <br/>
sounds great!&quot;  or any version of &quot;Good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563081956">&lt;&lt;I really struggle with these questions&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But given the option of stuff to do, kids rarely just want to sit and watch<br/>
violence and sex all day.  If I ask the kids to go to the park, they are<br/>
always raring to go.  If I ask the kids to help make cookies, they always<br/>
say yes.  Yesterday, the 5 kids (ages 12 down to 4) had the opportunity to<br/>
watch any kind of television they wanted for as long as they wanted, to play<br/>
any kind of video game or computer game as long as they wanted.  They chose<br/>
to play some rough-housing with stuffed animals.<br/>
<br/>
If kids do just want to sit and watch television all day, that is a pretty<br/>
good cue that something is going on.  There is a reason behind it, perhaps<br/>
they are scared that someone will take them, perhaps they are beginning to<br/>
have mature sexual urges, whatever.  But there is something there, they are<br/>
working on something.<br/>
