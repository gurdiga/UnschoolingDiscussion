<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105944496">my name is anna. this is my first read of a digest of<br/>
this list. I&#39;m sitting here with tears in my eyes like<br/>
I&#39;ve died & gone to heaven. Actually I&#39;m still alive.<br/>
(Oddly enough, earlier today, I ran into a man in the<br/>
grocery store, whom I once loved very much, whom I was<br/>
told was dead.)<br/>
My son slept with me for almost 9 years. He nursed for<br/>
just over 6 years. I pulled him out of public school<br/>
when he freaked out before the end of 4th grade. I<br/>
think his Dad, my ex, still thinks I am neglecting him<br/>
by unschooling.<br/>
thank you so much for the specifics on food at your<br/>
house, one of you. this is an ongoing issue for me, as<br/>
my mother turned me into an anorexic for a time by<br/>
giving my big brother my 2 nd helping in front of my<br/>
face.<br/>
I am noticing that the more I follow the unschooling<br/>
lifestyle and get out of my head about my expectations<br/>
and trying to please absent others, the better, more<br/>
curious, and more truly educated my son becomes.<br/>
lately he&#39;s been spending hours at the computer making<br/>
up profiles in role playing games online. I read some<br/>
of them. it blew me away. there&#39;s no way I was writing<br/>
like that at his age, altho&#39; i am and come from a<br/>
family of gifted writers.<br/>
now I am going to officially STOP WORRYING about my<br/>
son&#39;s many hours in virtual reality.<br/>
the school psychologist looked at me with a straight<br/>
face and said &quot;I&#39;m not sure if this is a boy who knows<br/>
the difference between fantasy and reality.&quot; I left<br/>
the school that day, taking my son with me, and<br/>
haven&#39;t been back (except to return some library<br/>
books.) I decided to take my son back and see for<br/>
myself. that was 2 years ago.<br/>
glad to be here<br/>

It&#39;s off-topic for this list, but I&#39;d sure like to know what that was  like!<br/>
