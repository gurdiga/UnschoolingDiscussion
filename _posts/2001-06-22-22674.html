<div id="ygrps-yiv-164629717">Has anyone else been watching the news on the Yates family?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/06/21/children.killed/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/06/21/children.killed/index.html</a>  As we were<br/>
running through the stations, two reporters quizzed the father on the fact<br/>
that they homeschooled the children and asked various questions about<br/>
curriculum and unit studies.  A comment was made that implied that the<br/>
murders wouldn&#39;t have happened &quot;if the children had been in school where<br/>
they belonged.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IMHO it is disgusting, to begin with, that reports can&#39;t let people alone at<br/>
a time like this.  It is doubly disgusting that comments such as the one<br/>
above were made.  And now, of course, every dime store shrink and his uncle<br/>
will be debating PPD!<br/>
