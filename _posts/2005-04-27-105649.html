<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030851322">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading all your emails for over a year now, I guess.  Anyhow, I love this group and have gotten such wonderful inspiration from you all.  <br/>
<br/>
My name is Brenda and I have a wonderful dd R who will be 5 next month.  We will be unschooling, continuing our path of life long learning.  I am a single mom currently living in So Cal.  But, I&#39;m planning to move out of the area as I just can no longer afford to live here and unschool.  Being able to work at home is my priority, so that I can be with my daughter and she can continue to learn whatever she desires.  <br/>
<br/>
I am seriously considering moving to Arizona, the Phoenix area.  I thought I&#39;d ask here first if anyone knows of any unschooling groups in that area, or even a good secular homeschooling group would do too.  Also, if anyone has any idea about the homeschooling laws in AZ?  Is it a hs friendly place to live?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
Brenda<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058574228">Hi Brenda,<br/>
 <br/>
I live in Scottsdale and there are some homeschool groups but the big ones are mainly religious and not the unschooling type.<br/>
 <br/>
Arizona is very good for homeschoolers. No tests, no intrusions. All you have to do is register with the Superindentent of Education and they send you lots of good info.<br/>
 <br/>
My boys play on school basketball teams which by law they are allowed to try-out for as long as they live in the area of the school. The kids accept them and the coaches love them. They could also take any one class at the schools but they choose not to.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope that helps, Joanne<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149628602">Are you sure you don&#39;t want to move to Kansas City, and start an unschooling single mom commune with me? It&#39;s even cheaper than Arizona, and you can avoid the 120 degree summers... just checking!<br/>
<br/>
I lived in the Phoenix area for 15 years or so, my daughter was born there. We were part of an unschooling-frinedly secular group, but that was 8 years ago - but I remember seeing listings for an unschooling group there recently, I think in the Mesa area. I&#39;m sure you could find other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Tucson is actually a little more &quot;crunchy&quot; than Phoenix, I think... I also lived there for years, most recently in 2002, and found some other unschoolers - not as many as in California, but some.<br/>
<br/>
The laws in Arizona are simple, just notify. I don&#39;t feel quite as secure with that as I do with laws that allow people to homeschool as a private school (like California and Kansas have), and 10 or so years ago there was a testing requirement in Arizona... and with the big high school exit exam thing there, they may change the laws and require tetsing again... but for now, it&#39;s a single notification.<br/>

Thanks for the info on Arizona.  :-)  It sounds like there are some good<br/>
groups near Phoenix...do they have a webiste that you know of?  I&#39;ll try and<br/>
google it.<br/>
I like Tucson as well and lived there for about a year in 1998/99.    I like<br/>
that Phoenix is closer for now...I might end up in Tucson or somewhere else<br/>
though.</div>

than Phoenix and that may be why so many  more religious hs groups.   Better<br/>
climate though, I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
<br/>
And, it&#39;s great to know it&#39;s pretty easy to hs there.  I hate the idea of<br/>
testing.  It&#39;s important for me to live in a &quot;low regualation&quot; state.</div>

Hey move to Connecticut! LOL We don&#39;t even file notice and we&#39;re not <br/>
any kind of school (not even private school); there are unschoolers <br/>
and relaxed eclectic types and inclusive/secular support groups; and <br/>
we rarely ever have a tornado - there was one that touched down about <br/>
2 years ago, didn&#39;t even really register as an F1! We do however have <br/>
the occasional blizzard or hurricane.</div>

I know you from another place on the web and I wanted to say hi.<br/>
<br/>
You gave me some valuable info on Tucson last October.  I turned out<br/>
we went there several times over the past few months and found tons of<br/>
stuff to do.  Thanks for your response before.  I have no info for<br/>
you, but I wish you the very best!!<br/>

love, love CT.  I used to live right across the border in Westchester County<br/>
as a nanny, Chappaqua to be exact.<br/>
<br/>
However,  I am way to scared to make a move cross-country (don&#39;t know anyone<br/>
there)  and I don&#39;t think the COL is all that much lower than S. California<br/>
anyhow.  Darn.</div>

ALBUQUERQUE!  We have several unschoolers in the area, including quite a <br/>
few with kids in the younger age range, no testing or assessment for <br/>
HS&#39;ing, beautiful weather (usually), lots of great kid places, good <br/>
homeschool play groups, a fantastic food co-op, and yeah, lots of artsy <br/>
fartsy crunchy types (raising hand....)<br/>
<br/>
I have a son who will be 5 in May as well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that much farther than Phoenix and it&#39;s not as hot either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640081439">I have to say Albuquerque is prettier and has better weather than either Phoenix or KC.  We can actually be outdoors thru the entire summer.  Jenny&#39;s right -- it&#39;s a great mix of unschooling folks, easy HS laws, great climate and lots of crunchy types.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844420918">Hey! Hey! Hey!<br/>
Well be spending a couple months in Albuquerque this summerwe consider it<br/>
home since its where dh was born and where his parents are.  It will most<br/>
likely be july/august/septemberish and Id love to meet some other RU<br/>
families with little kids.  Ours are 4, 2 and 4 mos.  Well be based in the<br/>
north valley, more specifically, Los Ranchos.<br/>
Tami, a recovering vegetarian, who just might be considered crazy for making<br/>
a trans pacific, space available military flight with 3 children under the<br/>
age of 5, but will do it anyway just to spend time in NM and eat yet another<br/>
Blakes Lotaburger!  So there!<br/>
