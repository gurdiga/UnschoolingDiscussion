<div id="ygrps-yiv-860410821">I&#39;ve had one of those weeks!!  This is our first year with our son out of <br/>
public school.  We started out trying to do &quot;school-at-home&quot; but because of <br/>
his personality and my frustration we sort of slipped into unschooling.  And <br/>
it&#39;s working!!!  Of course it is, you say, but .... this is where I need a <br/>
little help.<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend my dh went to visit his parents and his sister was there too.  <br/>
Fortunately I stayed home!  She started off by asking how the homeschooling <br/>
was going and led up to what&#39;s he studying, what books is he reading, how <br/>
often does he work... etc, etc, etc,...  Gary, in his wisdom, just turned to <br/>
his father and started talking about something else.  I found out about this <br/>
after having a similar conversation with my SIL on Tuesday night.<br/>
<br/>
Except this time I didn&#39;t have someone to turn to so I could virtually <br/>
ignore her!  I was told about homeschooling on the internet (no, she doesn&#39;t <br/>
homeschool.  Her kids are 24 and 21)  I was asked about books, subjects <br/>
etc... and I tried to explain our version of unschooling, but... I don&#39;t <br/>
think it went over...<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your best response in a situation like this??  I know it will come up <br/>
again in a couple of months when school is starting again.  I tried to tell <br/>
her we&#39;re doing the same thing all summer we&#39;ve done all year, but I know <br/>
her... I&#39;ll get bombarded again.<br/>
<br/>
Phewwww!!!  Thanks - I needed to get that out of my system!<br/>

UGH, rellies!!  I had a gobful from my Mum last Friday, <br/>
about how the kids were missing out cos they don&#39;t have <br/>
any commonality with &#39;all the other kids&#39;  This week I <br/>
had a visit from a local official who told me they&#39;d <br/>
had an anonymous phone call saying that there was a <br/>
little girl here who wasn&#39;t in school...  Turned out it <br/>
wasn&#39;t my mum, but even so...  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of those cases where you have to decide how <br/>
much info the person can deal with, you know?  What <br/>
they really want to know, what exactly they&#39;re <br/>
asking... it might seem patronising (and I am the <br/>
world&#39;s worst at giving much, much more info than I <br/>
need to!!  LOL) but I suppose it&#39;s a bit like the <br/>
breastfeeding counselling info I&#39;ve recently been <br/>
reading back over, if you empathise and try to pick the <br/>
bits out of her questions, you might find she&#39;s <br/>
actually wanting to know something she hasn&#39;t really <br/>
said in the first place...  So rather than jump in with <br/>
a load of info, you could turn her question around and <br/>
say it back to her, with empathy, as if clarifying what <br/>
she&#39;s saying...  I&#39;m making a bad job of cutting a long <br/>
story short, if you want to know what I mean I can chat <br/>
if you like :-)  Brain on melt-down due to beer atm...  <br/>
need more food...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know what i wish I&#39;d said after the event!!  <br/>
LOL  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If her interest is sincere, maybe you could offer to loan her a book, or<br/>
suggest some good websites she could look at.<br/>
<br/>
But if she&#39;s asking because she thinks trying to run your life would be<br/>
more interesting than trying to run her own, that&#39;s different.<br/>
<br/>
If she ever gets to the point where she says &quot;Euw!  I wouldn&#39;t do it that<br/>
way!&quot; then you can tell her &quot;YOU don&#39;t have to.  These are my kids.&quot;<br/>

P.S.  (I have avoided gatherings with the in-laws a few times when I was in<br/>
the early stages of unschooling.  Now that my son is older, likes to read,<br/>
and is an all-around sweet person, most criticism bounces off me.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933260716">For the few relatives that questioned what we were doing and how we were<br/>
doing it, I bought a bunch of used homeschooling and unschooling books.  I<br/>
then told them that it is really something they have to experience first<br/>
hand or spend more time with than a short conversation.  I then dropped the<br/>
books on them and told them that if they were really interested these were<br/>
some good reads.<br/>
<br/>
I threw in a mix of Holt, Griffith, Cafi Cohen (they could relate to her<br/>
book because she was local) and a few others.<br/>
<br/>
And, speaking of books, Linda Dobson&#39;s new one, &quot;The First Year of<br/>
Homeschooling Your Child&quot; just came in the mail today and it has a lot of<br/>
first person experiences that answer lots of questions that folks that don&#39;t<br/>
know anything about home/unschooling ask.<br/>
