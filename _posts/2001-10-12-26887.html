<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575488901">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Since this is starting to generate quite a bit of mail, I&#39;m taking my part<br/>
of the bookselling discussion off-list. I will be e-mailing the original<br/>
poster to answer questions by this Sunday (I&#39;m out buying today and tomorrow<br/>
so may not get to it until then). If anyone else would like to be included<br/>
in any ensuing discussion with me I&#39;ll be happy to send you any of those<br/>
e-mails and answer any questions you have, also, just send me a note<br/>
PRIVATELY to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamhartley@...">pamhartley@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and now, back to your regular show. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pam</div>
