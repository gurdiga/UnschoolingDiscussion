 </span></blockquote>my dh was this way about circumcision (he was really hoping for a girl so we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to deal with this decision but we got a boy:) but after<br/>
experiencing it (an uncircumcised penis) he can&#39;t see way it was ever a problem<br/>
for him so the reality proved to be nothing it was just the thought of it that<br/>
has difficult for him.  perhaps the same will be true for your dh.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is that not the next best<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you&#39;re right your dh does most definitely deserve a big pat on the back because<br/>
he is trying to stretch - a truly difficult task.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just<br/>
&gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he may<br/>
&gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire process<br/>
&gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant without a<br/>
&gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has been a<br/>
&gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>
&gt; feeding?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you&#39;re a family i think consensus and flexibility are vital to maintaining a<br/>
healthy bond/foundation.  i also expressed milk just so my dh could feed/bond<br/>
from the very beginning, he loved it and imo it was worth it.  we just made<br/>
sure we got good bottles that made rene&#39; work a bit, like breastfeeding, so he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t get &#39;lazy&#39; and want only the bottle.  if we had to do it again we<br/>
would do it the same way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that this<br/>
&gt; would now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in our<br/>
&gt; home.<br/>
&gt; Thank you for all your opinions-<br/>
&gt; Ron and Stephanie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well breastfeeding as a topic goes way beyond your dh he is actually mild<br/>
compared to many people and men in particular.  breastfeeding has become both a<br/>
public and a private issue and is highly emotional.  i hope your dh does not<br/>
take the discussion personal.<br/>
