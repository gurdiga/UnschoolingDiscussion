<div id="ygrps-yiv-18582494">Thank you for all the explanations, great analogies, and the website to<br/>
visit on UU and UNitarians. Answered my basic questions and has given<br/>
food for more research.<br/>
<br/>
I did a fun project a few days ago I thought I&#39;d share with you:<br/>
<br/>
My daughter had a large plastic bag of pottery clay left over from a<br/>
class which she gave to me. I brought it out when I had two younger (9<br/>
and 11) girls over a few days ago and she rolled it out and shaped it<br/>
more or less into the form of the USA. THen we built up the Rockies<br/>
really big and the Appalachians somewhat smaller. I read a story about<br/>
Johnny Appleseed to them and as we went through it put in th Mississippi<br/>
and the Ohio Rivers. Then we went outside and got some little twigs and<br/>
made &quot;apple trees&quot; in the Ohio River Valley, planted by Johnny. THen I<br/>
found my bead box, so we could put red bead apples on the trees. THen we<br/>
went wild, and put a giant red bead for New York (the Big Apple) which<br/>
they ahd visited recently. And a big white bead for the white house in<br/>
Washington, D.C. And we used some green beads for evergreen trees in the<br/>
Rockies. But we didn&#39;t have enough so we took a walk to look for pine<br/>
trees and other stuff that would be useful for our &quot;map&quot;. WE found<br/>
Spanish moss (we live in FLorida) to put across Florida and Louisiana,<br/>
acorn caps which turned into a zillion little s canoes for Indian beads<br/>
that went up and down the rivers, small rocks to add to the Rockies,<br/>
some seashells to put on FLorida&#39;s coast, a pine cone for the Redwood<br/>
forest area in CA, and some cactus to put in the southwest deserts. WE<br/>
made a little wagon and log cabin out of twigs just over the<br/>
Appalachians where Daniel Boone or Davy Crocket might have gone. Then we<br/>
settled down and heard the rest of the story. It was great to look at to<br/>
figure out what it meant when the book said that Johnny walked all the<br/>
way across Pennsylvania to get to where the settlers were in the Ohio<br/>
Valley.<br/>
<br/>
THe next day they came over  we read about the CA gold rush and put gold<br/>
sequins up and down the American River in California. We never could<br/>
find out what exactly the word California comes from - does anyone here<br/>
know? I thought it might be hot-oven &quot;CAli&quot; Fornia&quot; but that might be<br/>
way off.<br/>
Anyway, we had tons of fun and I have saved the clay map to wet it again<br/>
in case we want o put anything else in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285474269">Hi Deb and everyone,<br/>
I&#39;m Marianne and I&#39;m new to the list, and to unschooling.   Although it is really what I know is right, I do have trouble &#39;letting go&#39;, so I appreciate all the encouragement here.  <br/>
I&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to answer Deb&#39;s question about the history or California&#39;s name, since that is where we live.  Here is the info that I learned:<br/>
The name &quot;California&quot; came from a knightly romance book that was published in 1510. It was about an island paradise near the Indies where beautiful Queen Califia ruled over a country of beautiful black Amazons with lots of pearls and gold. Men were only allowed there one day a year to help perpetuate the race. Cortez&#39;s men thought they found the island in 1535, because they found pearls. Later, Francisco de Ulloa found that the island was really a peninsula.<br/>

apparently from his writings he considered himself Unitarian. So he&#39;s an<br/>
honorary Unitarian.<br/>

Was Thomas Jefferson really a Unitarian?<br/>
<br/>
Like many others of his time (he died just one year after the founding of<br/>
institutional Unitarianism in America), Jefferson was a Unitarian in<br/>
theology, though not in church membership.  He never joined a Unitarian<br/>
congregation: there were none near his home in Virginia during his<br/>
lifetime.  He regularly attended Joseph Priestley&#39;s Pennsylvania church when<br/>
he was nearby, and said that Priestley&#39;s theology was his own, and there is<br/>
no doubt Priestley should be identified as Unitarian.   Jefferson remained a<br/>
member of the Episcopal congregation near his home, but removed himself from<br/>
those available to become godparents, because he was not sufficiently in<br/>
agreement with the trinitarian theology. His work, The Jefferson Bible, was<br/>
Unitarian in theology.  For a slightly different analysis (one that slights<br/>
the fact that the Unitarians were not formally organized into a sect until<br/>
1825), see the relevant &quot;Matters of Fact&quot; factsheet at the Monticello<br/>
website.<br/>
