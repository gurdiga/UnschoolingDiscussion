They&#39;re making me nuts, and I have no idea how to solve this problem either.  <br/>

recommend, I did show them how to &quot;work out&quot; their disagreements.  They do a<br/>
pretty good job.  I almost always have to remind them to do it though.  And,<br/>
it doesn&#39;t always work.  But I think it helps alot.<br/>
It&#39;s really hard to all learn to get along especially when we are all home<br/>
together all day, but I know the benefits are worth it.<br/>
I just wonder how are sanity will be affected?  lol<br/>
Maybe it will help to know that your not alone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117786637">As far as books go, I highly recommend anything by Dr. Kevin Leman, my<br/>
favorite being &quot;The Birth Order Book,&quot; but followed closely by &quot;Bringing<br/>
Up Kids Without Tearing Them Down.&quot;  As far as sibling rivalry goes,<br/>
it&#39;s my belief that it is highly cyclical.  They get along for a few<br/>
months, then just plain don&#39;t for a few months.  I have no idea why that<br/>
it, but then everything in life seems to run in cycles, doesn&#39;t it.  I<br/>
think the best thing we can do for our kids in general is to teach them<br/>
empathy for others and also problem solving techniques.  We&#39;re really<br/>
big on &quot;Do unto others . . .&quot; around here.  And Mom and Dad don&#39;t hide<br/>
when they&#39;ve had their feelings hurt either.  It&#39;s good to know that our<br/>
actions have consequences on peoples feelings - - even grownups! :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791141227">I think a lot of how they are with each other is a reflection of how we are<br/>
and feel and react when we are  with them. If they are really hurting each<br/>
other and screaming without learning how to resolve their fights on their<br/>
own we must step in and at possibly encourage a separation time and time<br/>
alone to think about how they could have handled things differently. I used<br/>
to ask them to say they are sorry but only if they really were and to tell<br/>
each other how they feel. If they are younger (2-7 years) you need to<br/>
discuss it with them (Waldorf method doesn&#39;t believe they can or should be<br/>
reasoned with at this stage but I beg to differ!) IF it is a particularly<br/>
&quot;naughty&quot; thing the child did ie biting etc. I once or twice had them draw a<br/>
picture of the mistake they made and show what they would do next time their<br/>
sib made them angry or jealous whatever! I have some very cute pictures of<br/>
them counting to 10 which was their idea to do to blow off steam before<br/>
reacting. Each problem is different as is each child and their temperament,<br/>
if it is a minor offense and a child is tattling than I tell them to talk to<br/>
each other about it and see if they can resolve it without me. Mostly I<br/>
think they fight when my dh and I fight or ignore their needs. We are role<br/>
models for this stuff whether we want to be or not. If we are ignoring them<br/>
while online here and they act up that is another message.  (same for being<br/>
not he phone or any activity we chose while away from them). I know that if<br/>
I have spent a lot of quality time with them they are much better behaved<br/>
than if I were to spend a lot of time doing household or other things not<br/>
involved with them. Of course we have to have a life of our own and balance<br/>
and  little ones esp. need to learn how to resolve their conflicts with each<br/>
other. I worry when my two will not let a 3rd friend play with them you know<br/>
2 is company  3 is a crowd. But I also know and trust they will learn from<br/>
this and any other conflict they have with others. IMHO It is our job to<br/>
help them learn right and wrong but only after giving them the chance to<br/>
discover this on their own. I know that if I yell at them for doing anything<br/>
before treating them with the respect they deserve no matter what they did<br/>
than I am teaching them to yell at each other too. Ditto for hitting. I<br/>
admit I have been guilty of both in the past and am working hard to change<br/>
this about myself. It was how I was raised yelling and hitting and I am glad<br/>
for the most part I have given it up but I still have moments of yelling<br/>
that I regret deeply.<br/>

Sure we have conflicts, but I think mostly that they get along very well. <br/>
I don&#39;t think they argue any more by being at home all day together than if<br/>
they would spend only a few hours every evening and weekends together.<br/>
In fact I think that they would not get along as well after daily separation <br/>
and<br/>
improper (school) socialization.  I, for the most part stay away from rewards<br/>
and punishment.  We discuss things, talk about hurt feelings, misbehaviors.<br/>
I am learning about non-coercive parenting.  I do not have the web site,<br/>
but there is a list on onelist called TCS -- taking children seriously.  I <br/>
find <br/>
it difficult to explain (sorry!) but I do know that not coercing my children <br/>
is how I want to parent.  It especially makes sense as an unschooler.  I mean<br/>
if I do not coerce learning, why would I coerce other parts of our lives.  Not<br/>
to say that I don&#39;t ever say you have to do that or else, hey I&#39;m not <br/>
perfect...<br/>

I totally agree with this.  I know that my son and I get along alot better than we did when he was in PS.  Partly because of the influence of other kids and other adults.  Partly because of being &quot;jailed&quot; all day long in a formal environment and coming home and just releasing.  He definately is alot more balanced than he was before.  I get alot of people who say things like, &quot;Wow you have your hands full with three and homeschooling.&quot;  Sometimes I tell them it&#39;s easier and sometimes I don&#39;t...depends if I need the pat on the back.
