<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478955539">A big &quot;Thank you!&quot; to those who responded to my request for the &quot;Where in the <br/>
World&quot; instructions! <br/>
<br/>
I was both amazed and impressed at the speed with which the responses came. <br/>
When I saw Barb&#39;s request for the &quot;Risk&quot; instructions, I was all excited, as <br/>
I thought I&#39;d be able to give something back, but Lisa beat me to it. <br/>
(Naturally :-))  It was just as well, because afterwards when I told my <br/>
chidlren about it, they confessed that they&#39;ve lost them anyway!  But they&#39;ve <br/>
played the game so often they know the rules.  It&#39;s amazing, actually, how <br/>
often Risk is cited by them as the source of some geography fact they know.  <br/>
<br/>
Family tradition of course.   I was - and still am - hopeless at geography.  <br/>
But it&#39;s amazing how losing a Trivial Pursuit game to someone who actually <br/>
knows the stations at each end of the Trans-Siberian Railway indelibly <br/>
imprints the information on your mind!<br/>
