<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527032544">In Oklahoma State Board of Education is strongly encouraging all school districts here to go to an all day Kindergarten.  Most of the districts can&#39;t afford it right now.  Some are holding an optional all day class and charging the parents for 1/2 of the day.  It&#39;s only seven hours, but that is still too long.<br/>
 <br/>
We have a local private school that goes from 8:30 to 3:30.  They have an extended day (daycare) program that goes from as early as 7:00 to as late as 6:00.  However, if you drop your kiddos off at 7:00, they encourage you to pick them up by 5:00 as they do need time at home with their families!  <br/>

In all but a few schools here (the ones that aren&#39;t will be in the next few <br/>
years, its a phase in thing) kids go from either 8a to 4p or 8:30a to 4:30p. <br/>
The buses are shared so some go at 7:30 and others at 8. Its a sad sad world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44177633">In the middle school where I teach, kids go from 8:00 - 3:20, with only <br/>
5 minute passing periods, and a 45 minute lunch.  So they are in school <br/>
7 hours 20 minutes.  Many get here at 7:30 to eat breakfast (all of the <br/>
kids qualify for free lunches/.breakfast--if you can call it that.  THe <br/>
food is not very good, or nutritious, sadly).  On Monday and Tuesday I <br/>
had kids helping me until I left, after they called their parents to let <br/>
them know--I left at 6 on Monday. <br/>
<br/>
Sadly much of the world sees more hours in school and more days in <br/>
school as a positive thing, that it will increase test scores and learning.<br/>
