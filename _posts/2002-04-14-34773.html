<div id="ygrps-yiv-484924391">It&#39;s a beautiful day here on the easter shore of Maryland.<br/>
I&#39;m off to entertain my kids with a day on the beach amongst friends.<br/>
And they didn&#39;t even think of it themselves.  <br/>
They would probably have been perfectly happy playing in the dirt <br/>
today. Oh well....<br/>

They still have a chance to play in the sand and totally ignore the water and <br/>
people and sky and lunch.<br/>
Maybe your entertainment won&#39;t *entirely* ruin them.<br/>

the dog doesn&#39;t want to be out today.  I feel like it&#39;s time to build <br/>
an ark!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958098445">Nope, I&#39;m in Ohio.  We can go either way here.  This year it is wet . <br/>
. . very wet . . . very very wet.  The neighbors yard has a flowing <br/>
creek where most of the time it&#39;s dry.  Our back woods has standing <br/>
water everywhere.<br/>
Other years, the spring rains are little drizzles.  But tomorrow it is <br/>
supposed to be sunny and warm so maybe things will at least stop <br/>
flowing!<br/>
