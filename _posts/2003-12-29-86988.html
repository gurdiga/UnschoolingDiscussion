I chose to have children.  I really love them.  They don&#39;t have to do a <br/>
certain job to earn my love, or their rooms, or their food, or their clothes, or <br/>
the spending money they automatically get (allowance) or the extra money we give <br/>
them sometimes.   Two of mine just got back from ice skating with eight other <br/>
kids.  We weren&#39;t sure how much money the kids all had to pool to do that.  <br/>
Keith gave Marty $20, which is enough to cover three kids and a bit more.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t apply to be our children, and we couldn&#39;t fire them and hire <br/>
replacement children, so the analogy of a job doesn&#39;t apply.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Like I said, he is only 6 and does not need a soul source of income.<br/>

are lucky enough to be able to chose what they do in life and what<br/>
duties they take on in a job, but some people are not that lucky at all<br/>
and they are forced to take any job they can and endure a harder life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A source of income no, but money of their own given unconditionally for them<br/>
to do with as they see fit, yes. I would at least say that most who post<br/>
here do it that way. Money given with no attachments. It&#39;s not really<br/>
considered income because there is no job. But giving money like that helps<br/>
the child with a lot more than just the concept of saving and spending. And<br/>
I tend to disagree with the whole no choice stuck in a crappy job thing.<br/>
There is always a choice. Sometimes one does have a crappy job but there is<br/>
always the choice to look for better/different.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, without some guide as to how to do it or how it will be easiest,<br/>
how will they know? We HAVE lived this already and just want to help<br/>
them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But again what you see as easier won&#39;t always be seen the same way to<br/>
others. I know plenty of people, (live with one) who seem totally<br/>
disorganized but funtion quite nicely. Better than I ever would under those<br/>
same circumstances and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Of course, clean is not what I would call clean...that&#39;s when I go in<br/>
and do it after the fact! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all well and good as long as one isn&#39;t asked to do something, or even<br/>
made to do something, and then have someone else go and redo it. If I feel<br/>
strongly enough about something like that, I would never ask anyone to do it<br/>
in the first place. Why would anyone ever *want* to try and do something<br/>
someone else would go and do over later? And what we are talking about with<br/>
neatness or cleanliness is wanting our children to *want* to do it for them,<br/>
not because mom wants them to or someone else made them all their lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Because that&#39;s me! Some people cant see dirt on the toilet or in the<br/>
kitchen, I like for all the legos to be in the same place. What good<br/>
would it do to have 1o pieces in one room and 2 in another and be trying<br/>
to build something and have to go bonkers looking for those 2 to<br/>
complete it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like the legos in the lego bin too. But I never make the kids put them<br/>
there. Most end up there but some end up in separate bins too. So I don&#39;t<br/>
*make* the kids move them so they are all together where I like them.<br/>
Sometimes if they are out of place long enough, I&#39;ll ask if I can put them<br/>
where all the rest are. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You are right, kids don&#39;t give a hoot about cleaning. They just want to<br/>
play and bounce off the walls! BUT, I do feel that a certain level of<br/>
cleanliness is important in the real world. How else will they learn<br/>
unless we model a clean living environment. And I don&#39;t mean nagging and<br/>
making them do it, but showing them how pleasant it is to be in a clean<br/>
and tidy home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And modeling that and not imposing it is the best way for that to happen<br/>
naturally for the child. And modeling just means doing it ourselves and not<br/>
saying &quot;okay lets clean up this room, legos go here and those things go over<br/>
there, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This concept sounds great for older children that understand the concept<br/>
of money and bills. My 6 yr old would not benefit from this yet. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But many children do understand that concept at early ages. My kids get<br/>
consumerism and saving and spending and paying bills. Just from everyday<br/>
life with us they understand that we even pay for our water. It&#39;s natural<br/>
for them to see that.<br/>
<br/>
I see chores as having the kids do things they wouldn&#39;t normally do right<br/>
now because they want the money they are getting paid to do it. So even when<br/>
they are being paid to clean their room, they aren&#39;t really cleaning because<br/>
they like it that way or even because mom does, they clean for money. And I<br/>
was wondering if your son doesn&#39;t spend any he *makes* maybe he&#39;s wondering<br/>
if the day will come when he won&#39;t want to do any chores at all, making no<br/>
money. At least he&#39;ll have what he has now. It&#39;s something worth thinking<br/>
about.<br/>

some great advice on cleaning after people have cleaned -- especially <br/>
in the case of cleaning something &quot;better&quot; after a child has done so <br/>
already.  &quot;Housework done incorrectly still blesses the house.&quot;  She <br/>
says that you&#39;re doing your children a disservice when you&#39;re telling <br/>
them (with actions or words) that their best isn&#39;t good enough for you. <br/>
  If you want it done a certain way just do it yourself in the first <br/>
place and without being a martyr or carrying on with a woe-is-me <br/>
attitude.  Don&#39;t ask or tell your babies (or husband! ;&#39;) to clean <br/>
something and then grumble or sigh and do over when they do it &quot;wrong&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59667836">Growing up, &quot;allowance&quot; was always tied to chores and grades in school and things such as that. Which meant I never had any allowance, because I never &quot;measured up&quot; to expected levels...mostly because I didn&#39;t really care to. <br/>
<br/>
When I was old enough to work, I was further punished for it by having to turn my money over to my mother &quot;to save&quot; for me because otherwise I&#39;d just spend it as I wanted to. All that taught me was to lie about my earnings, spend earnings quickly in order to have something I wanted, then hide/lie some more to cover up having bought something I wanted. <br/>
<br/>
For all the book knowledge and lectures in the world over how to handle money, that was the real lesson I learned. I still struggle with it now, 10 years that I&#39;ve been on my own/married. <br/>
<br/>
In contrast, my husband&#39;s allowance was just his allowance. He could spend it as he chose. When he was old enough to work, the allowance stopped, but he had his earnings. No questions asked, no lectures about savings. He learned to take care of the important things (his car payment and insurance were his primary expenses) then his wants/needs (cigarettes mostly as his parents still met his needs for clothing/shelter/food). Not that he&#39;s a penny-pincher but he&#39;s responsible. <br/>
<br/>
He is responsible with his money because he taught himself to be responsible, because he was ALLOWED to be. <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, our children have an allowance starting at age 5. Their age in dollars per payday, to spend/save as they wish. So far Sarah blows it, but then, she&#39;s just 7. Occasionally she&#39;ll ASK me to help her save towards something that she wants but if she decides to dip into that before she reaches her goal, that&#39;s her choice and I&#39;ll let her. <br/>

<br/>
My kids have always had an allowance. For us that meant money given to them<br/>
weekly, every week, nothing tied to it, and it was there&#39;s to spend as they<br/>
wished.  Tara is now working for a little over a year and hasn&#39;t gotten<br/>
allowance since a month after she started. We pay things and she is<br/>
responsible for certain things as well. She is very good with her money. I<br/>
thought I was good at her age, but she has me beat. The other 3 get money<br/>
every week also. Money is saved every week that goes into their bank account<br/>
but they don&#39;t get that, I just put it in a separate can. They know we save<br/>
for them. They always after a large amount of money acquired, put some of<br/>
that into their *bank* account. (like some Christmas money) Sierra would<br/>
always spend her money as soon as she got more than $5.00. She could never<br/>
keep more than that. Joseph would save well into the 20&#39;s before buying<br/>
something. I would only let Sierra know what she would have leftover when<br/>
she asked. Sometimes it was nothing at all and sometimes she borrowed<br/>
allowance from me!!! Now at almost 8, she&#39;s much more calm with her money.<br/>
Right now she has about $30.00. An amount I would have never thought she<br/>
would be able to keep. Point is, letting them go and being patient has them<br/>
find their own comfort level. Most times it&#39;s what we would have wished for<br/>
ourselves.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think unschoolers are preparing their kids for employment. We&#39;re <br/>
more interested in helping our kids be who they are. Funny thing is, the <br/>
kids who really *are* who they are end up being quite employable.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is really important and I don&#39;t remember it ever being discussed <br/>
just from this angle.<br/>
<br/>
School claims heavily to be preparing people for &quot;the workplace.&quot;  I remember <br/>
being in school and them telling me &quot;School is your job.  Dress as though you <br/>
were going to work in an office.&quot;   And when we would complain to the <br/>
counsellor or principal about another student or teacher or about frustration in a <br/>
situation, their first line of response seemed to be that when we grew up and <br/>
went to work, we would have to learn to get along with bosses and co-workers, so <br/>
we should treat the situation as though it were that.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they were better preparing us to be draftees in the army, though, or <br/>
prison inmates, because few of us were at that school by choice.  A few had <br/>
chosen it over private schools their parents had been willing and able to afford, <br/>
and so a few were there by choice (from a limited field of choices, like <br/>
choosing the army instead of being drafted, maybe, or cutting a deal to go to a <br/>
certain prison).<br/>
<br/>
The lack of rights and the lack of the right of refusal in so many instances <br/>
made it quite UNlike &quot;the real world.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ideally, and it&#39;s what I want for my daughter, a person will have a job they<br/>
like, doing things they enjoy. Not all of it will be fun, but the less fun<br/>
things will be understandable in the larger context of what the company<br/>
needs (say like writing reports or going on business trips to unexotic<br/>
cities). It&#39;s less of a burden to do unfun things when you know it&#39;s a<br/>
necessary part of something you enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
In the workplace we always have a choice. We know we don&#39;t have to be there.<br/>
We can quit and find a new job at anytime. When the positives of the job<br/>
don&#39;t outweigh the negatives of the job and the negatives of finding a new<br/>
job, it&#39;s a useful skill to be able to recognize that it&#39;s time to move on!<br/>
<br/>
Does that resemble someone whose only choice of earning income is at the<br/>
whim and discretion of another?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that what you want for you son?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some similar thoughts people have had along that vein:<br/>
<br/>
If you knew your kid would be starving next year, would you starve him now<br/>
to prepare?<br/>
<br/>
If you knew your kid would break a leg in the future, would you break his<br/>
leg now so he&#39;d be prepared?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t really think I need an excuse at all. Its what works for us at<br/>
&gt; this moment and I feel that&#39;s most important to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. But. Some people assume all lists are for support and a place to<br/>
casually trade what they do that works.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this list is discussion. It&#39;s why it&#39;s called<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a piece of the list description:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; The purpose of this list is to move out of our own comfort zones as we<br/>
&gt;&gt; critically examine our beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints about learning, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; seek a deeper understanding of unschooling and more respectful relationships<br/>
&gt;&gt; with our children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and here&#39;s two of the list posting policies that will help you see why the<br/>
type of responses you&#39;re getting are part of the purpose of the list:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; 2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity to<br/>
&gt;&gt; critically examine your own ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
&gt;&gt; 4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to public<br/>
&gt;&gt; examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yes, without some guide as to how to do it or how it will be easiest,<br/>
&gt; how will they know? We HAVE lived this already and just want to help<br/>
&gt; them. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what people say about math and reading and the rest of academics.<br/>
<br/>
I think a better goal than getting kids to do it the &quot;right&quot; way -- which in<br/>
essence is learning to conform to someone else&#39;s idea of what is right -- is<br/>
to help them learn how to figure out what their goals are and how to go<br/>
about reaching them.<br/>
<br/>
Kids have goals different from us and what they will need to achieve their<br/>
goals will be different than what we think is the &quot;right&quot; way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best courses I had in college was Analysis, Synthesis and<br/>
Evaluation. (Revision was implied but they added it to the title in later<br/>
editions of the course.) *Better* than learning to do what someone else<br/>
tells us is the right way is to figure out what we want (analyze), figure<br/>
out ways we can go about it (synthesize), evaluate what&#39;s working and what<br/>
isn&#39;t (evaluate) and, in light of what we&#39;ve learned from the evaluation,<br/>
tweak the way we&#39;re working towards the goal or even revise the goal itself.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to see the world through their understanding and their needs rather<br/>
than through adult understanding and adult needs. Our job isn&#39;t to change<br/>
their understanding and needs to match what adults have. That will come over<br/>
time naturally with growth. Our job is to help them figure out what they<br/>
want and then figure out how to get it. Their wants and needs and<br/>
understanding will change through out life so learning how to meet specific<br/>
needs (organization for instance) doesn&#39;t help them nearly as much as<br/>
learning how to go about meeting any need they have.<br/>
<br/>
And at 5 the overpowering need is to play and have fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What good<br/>
&gt; would it do to have 1o pieces in one room and 2 in another and be trying<br/>
&gt; to build something and have to go bonkers looking for those 2 to<br/>
&gt; complete it? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would drive *you* bonkers. It might even drive him bonkers at the moment<br/>
when he wants the piece. But it just isn&#39;t enough of an annoyance to make up<br/>
for the annoyance of putting them away in a specific way every time he<br/>
touches them.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is for him to appreciate how much easier it is when things are<br/>
where you expect them to be, you&#39;ll have to be the one reorganizing. *Do*<br/>
invite him along. *Do* make the process pleasant. So when he decides that<br/>
information is something that will help him meet his goals, it will be there<br/>
available for him.<br/>
<br/>
Making him do it your &quot;right&quot; way is likely to make him think that one day<br/>
he&#39;ll be able to move out of the house and be able to keep things however he<br/>
wants them without having someone hovering over him telling him in words and<br/>
actions and attitude how wrong he is to not want things the way mom does.<br/>
<br/>
Is that your goal?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wow...I think someone has some resentment about organization LOL !!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think someone doesn&#39;t like other people deciding how they should organize<br/>
things. (Lyle happens to be a relaxing neat freak ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My way of &quot;organizing&quot; is to pile. It looks like chaos in my computer room<br/>
(and, to a lesser extent, around the house). But I know where things are. If<br/>
someone came and organized things to be where they think they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot;<br/>
to be, I wouldn&#39;t be able to find things as easily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; If someone doesn&#39;t like the way I did something, then they can re-do it to<br/>
&gt;&gt; their heart&#39;s content!  If it wasn&#39;t good enough, then fix it yourself!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s exactly what I do!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The consequence, of course, is that they&#39;re less likely to want to help next<br/>
time and think, &quot;Well to heck with you! You didn&#39;t like what I took the time<br/>
to do last time. So you can just do it yourself in the first place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband asked you to mow the lawn to help him out because he<br/>
was so busy this week. What if you did what you felt was a decent job and<br/>
you were glad to help him out so he didn&#39;t have to do it that week. What if<br/>
you then saw him out there redoing what you did? How would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
Kids are people too. Just because adults get the idea that parents are<br/>
&quot;right&quot; and kids are &quot;wrong&quot; and our job is to make sure kids learn how to<br/>
do it &quot;right&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that kids don&#39;t have the exact same feelings an<br/>
adult would in the above scenario.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; BUT, I do feel that a certain level of<br/>
&gt; cleanliness is important in the real world. How else will they learn<br/>
&gt; unless we model a clean living environment. And I don&#39;t mean nagging and<br/>
&gt; making them do it, but showing them how pleasant it is to be in a clean<br/>
&gt; and tidy home. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!<br/>
<br/>
If we see the work as ours to do, and we see their help as a gift they&#39;re<br/>
giving us, then we get the work done *and* better relationships with our<br/>
kids! :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve never had a job where pay was denied or docked if the employer felt I wasn&#39;t doing my job. I would have been reprimanded or fired, not an option for a family. <br/>
<br/>
      Anyhow, this whole &quot;real world&quot; idea seems strange to me. Your son is living in the real world of a six year old. The &#39;reality&#39; of employment is fantasy for him and has no real bearing on his real world. And why does he need to prepare about something 10 or 15 years in the future? Teach him that work is a joy instead and I guarentee employers will want him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  My husbands philosophy on work, echoed above. Until the lessons about work his parents drilled into him faded, he realized he had choices and decided to work towards a major career change. He&#39;s not in the navy yet but nothing has been able to stop him from pursuing this goal. People may not have immediate choices about where they work but they can always choose a goal to change that. No choice is much rarer than most people care to admit and really not something I&#39;d care to train my children to accept anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  That was my position awhile ago. But then I realized I was making it all about me. If the Lego get disorganized and it bugs me, I&#39;ll clean it or let it go. If let go my daughter learns it soons gets lost anyway. Making her clean it up a certain way however only lets her know that her toys and possessions and play revolve around my whims.<br/>

The best preparation for future challenges is to drop the idea that you have to get them ready for the future and let them live firmly in the present.<br/>

Nope, not at all.  I AM one of those organized people, and my point was that just because *I* want things &#39;organized&#39; doesn&#39;t make it IMPORTANT.  I think it&#39;s almost always the organized people that hold the resentment towards the less-than-organized.  If one person wants all the Legos in one bin, but another person says, &quot;Who cares?&quot;, the person with the who cares? attitude usually won&#39;t be the one upset about the Legos.  <br/>

The statement with which you responded to Sandra&#39;s<br/>

child to organize their stuff, whether or not they<br/>
want to, or have asked to, learn.  <br/>
<br/>
Is that what you meant?<br/>
<br/>
Some kids like having their room trashed and messy. <br/>
They dont&#39; mind stepping over things to get to the<br/>
desk or having to unbury the bed at the end of the day<br/>
or having to dig through the toy chest to find Buzz<br/>
Lightyear at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Other kids like being neat and like organizing and<br/>
cleaning, and never have to be &quot;taught&quot; how.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are mine, somewhere in the middle, who<br/>
let their rooms get to overwhelming and then ask me to<br/>
help them clean them up.  Now the 14yo cleans her own<br/>
room without help.  I never had to &quot;teach&quot; her how.<br/>

lawn, cleaning out the garage.  We also pay for the<br/>
materials and supplies they need for their hobbies and<br/>
interests.  They earn money from neighbors and friends<br/>
by babysitting, yardwork, pet sitting.<br/>
<br/>
They do things with their money like buy stuff for<br/>
their hobbies/interests too, buy birthday presents for<br/>
friends, pay for movie tickets and snacks there<br/>
(although if they don&#39;t have money for that, we cover<br/>
them, so they never have to *not* see the movie due to<br/>
lack of funds).<br/>
<br/>
Really, since we don&#39;t use curricula, their money is<br/>
their source of much math learning.  To put conditions<br/>
on earning it would create a situation where they have<br/>
to work to earn their education.  I don&#39;t make them<br/>
work to earn their books or board games or anything<br/>
else we use to learn with.  Why money?<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Of course, clean is not what I would call<br/>
&gt; clean...that&#39;s when I go in<br/>
&gt; and do it after the fact! &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s all well and good as long as one isn&#39;t asked<br/>
&gt; to do something, or even<br/>
&gt; made to do something, and then have someone else go<br/>
&gt; and redo it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mom used to do this.  She would give me a job to<br/>
do, walk away, come back later to tell me it wasn&#39;t<br/>
good enough, get exasperated and do it herself.<br/>
<br/>
I learned very early in life to do a half-ass job so I<br/>
could get out of there quicker and do what I really<br/>
wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
As long as I could endure the nagging and scolding, I<br/>
never had to do a good job cleaning anything.<br/>
<br/>
I would rather work alongside my children, talking and<br/>
laughing, letting them do as much as they want while I<br/>
pick up the rest of the job, and never make them feel<br/>
inferior and inadequate.  They also get to see how I<br/>
do things without a &quot;lesson&quot; involved.  Sometimes you<br/>
can see the wheels turning in their heads &quot;Oh, THAT&#39;S<br/>
how you change the bag in the vacuum&quot; and they know<br/>
how to do next time without ever having a lesson or<br/>
being told or screwing up.<br/>

who never question or create anything, but all work<br/>
for &quot;the man&quot;.  It is so sad, and so obvious, in our<br/>
area.  If I were to turn on the morning or evening<br/>

year.  There were metalworkers, and musicians, and<br/>
textile workers, and sculpters and artists and people<br/>
who made stuffed animals, and people who made fancy<br/>
candies.<br/>
<br/>
I want to go every year, and take my children, so they<br/>
can absorb the fact that not everyone has to work in a<br/>
building with circulated air and wear a suit and tie<br/>
and never change their wardrobe because the weather in<br/>
the building is a constant 68 degrees year round.<br/>
<br/>
There were hundreds of people at that craft fair doing<br/>
what they loved, and making a decent living at it, and<br/>
they were all smiling and happy and taking time to<br/>
talk to the children about what they loved.<br/>
<br/>
More empowerment.  Sandra, I think you got me going on<br/>
a power kick. ;-)<br/>

made it quite UNlike &quot;the real world.&quot;<br/>

I have never understood the argument made by sooo many people to justify <br/>
sooo many things: &quot;Life is hard, so it might as well be as hard as possible <br/>
from this moment forth so it won&#39;t feel so bad later.&quot; Not just school, but <br/>
what I was posting about the other day--staying in a class/ on a team <br/>

That&#39;s what grandparents, etc. told me when I didn&#39;t put my child in <br/>
kindergarten. They&#39;re going to have to learn how to sit still, be bored, <br/>
pay attention, follow directions, etc. so they must do all this from the <br/>
age of 5 forward, for many, many hours a day. HUH? It&#39;s just astonishing to <br/>
me that so many people buy this!<br/>
<br/>
For me, this conversation resonates with the whole choice discussion. This <br/>
attitude is preparation for the &quot;have to&quot; mentality, training people out of <br/>
free choice, hiding from them that they even have choices any more. This <br/>
mentality, drilled into our heads from the age of 5 if not earlier, is a <br/>
preparation for service and a guarantee that we will not see our way out of <br/>
that service. We are trained to work and consume so that we have to work <br/>
some more to consume some more. It&#39;s what makes our economy go &#39;round. And, <br/>
in my opinion, what makes homeschoolers so dangerous to the status quo that <br/>
we have news broadcasts, local and state governments calling for more <br/>
&quot;controls.&quot;<br/>

I never really thought much about this before but you are right. Seems like<br/>
all my life, school was about preparing for the future. Real tough call on<br/>
some carefree kid who can&#39;t see past tomorrow. I certainly don&#39;t want that<br/>

belonged and together. Sorting things from what was on the floor and what<br/>
was already put away. Then I saw just how important to my kids all those<br/>
misplaced pieces were. GI Joe can fight off the dinosaurs from eating the<br/>
farm animals and Polly Pockets. And when Joseph makes up a game, he uses<br/>
things I would never have thought of. Blocks, beads, links, marbles, cards<br/>
and even little plastic pieces he finds on the floor of K Mart and brings<br/>
home!! It would stifle his imagination and play if I had a rule of putting<br/>
this away before you play with that and keep all those pieces where they<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020058029">We have been all over the map on the allowance  -access to household money thing. <br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t know  a good way to do it.<br/>
 <br/>
As a kid  I   remember &quot;hearing about&quot; allowances. This was new to me-I asked my Dad-waiting till he was in a fairly good mood. He laughed like I was really silly. This was (now that I can look back) right after the war-(rationing) which happened right after the Depression era. Which as I grew older and could think about my parents in a more objective way-totally scarred  and molded them. I asked if I could have 50 cents a  month. I think he gave it to me 2 or 3 times  out of the few times I dared ask.<br/>
When our own first  kids were younger-I linked allowances to extra chores-I gave them  small amounts of money occasionally. At that time my husband earned about 300$ per month. I was terribly hard on them  in all ways but I thought I was really  a much better parent than my father. I can see that they, and our relationships remain  adversely touched  by some of this. My younger son came along when we moved to BC. As he grew older there was more time with him, a little more money for fun things. A way better relatioship-There was never any money  around &quot;in purses, Piggy banks etc.  When we adopted our youngest grandaughter  at birth, 12 years later,  we  had more money (relatively)  we travelled-showing our dairy goat herd, I had my own home business, we gave her things when she wanted, we occasionally  used chore sheets etc. we gave her an allowance. She was the focus of most of our time. We took her everywhere with us. We had a great, affectionate relationship with her.   We gave her extra money  often, I knew she occasionally took money from the house and the shop,  I  &quot;talked&quot; about it to her. &#39;we thought we were doing  such a wonderful job-she was very intelligent, inovative, motivated, but as she got into her teenage years-her stealing  from us escalated, her demands for  things went  on forever-we tried in all ways to  develop  her recognition  of a moral approach. She began to  develop an interest  only in her friends that  were ( and are)  quite frankly -lying thieves. She appeared to have no concept  of the &quot;wrongness&quot; of taking from people who worked for their money.<br/>
She does however remain loving, concerned, and  appreciative of us and her childhood.(mostly  :0) )<br/>
Having spent much time over the past 9 years wondering-&quot;what did we do wrong&quot;-did we  overindulge her-what is that all about.I have to admit being  totally spooked about  a lot of child raising things.<br/>
<br/>
With the girls, we started giving them  2$ a week each last year,at age 7. They can save it  or spend it how they wish. Usually they pay no attention to it. they have little  recognition  of money. I usually say-thats more than a &quot;Fancy Barbie&quot; as  much as &quot;three fancy Barbies:&quot;  They do peruse the Barbie aisles quite a bit  ;-0)<br/>
<br/>
I am not making any case  for limiting  money, gifts, allowances at all. Just telling you that. In Hindsight,   I  remain  confused about cause and effect. However I am quite aware that people do what they do;regardless. I know I did.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that for us -using chores-behaviour related allowances-privelages- and punishment  was  an awful thing for me to have done in the way I did it with my older children.<br/>
<br/>
This if too long now-but Unschooling has  been a major factor in  other areas  that  plagued their mother and aunts and  uncles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865657260">I think that trying to prepare a child for a future job is a pretty limited view of unschooling.  Job preparation is the last thing on my mind.  How would I know what type of job my kid&#39;s are going to have?  What if they don&#39;t even get a job?  What if they have their own business?  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of people have MANY different jobs throughout their lives, and I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s usually the employer, not the job, that has their own set of &#39;rules and repsonsibilities&#39; that they expect of their employees.  There is no universal preparation for the job market.  Jobs come and go, some become obsolete overnight, some fade away over time.  <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m doing any &quot;preparing&quot; for my kids, then I&#39;m preparing them for life, not a job.  (I don&#39;t even like the term &quot;preparing&quot;, it sounds too...mold-ish.)  Life in the &quot;real world&quot; doesn&#39;t have to be prepared for, it only needs to be LIVED.  <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; This aspect of the American educational system is well covered in John <br/>
&gt; Gatto&#39;s &quot;Underground History of American Education.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mean I would like it discussed that unschooling isn&#39;t  preparing people for <br/>
&gt; jobs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gatto&#39;s book bugs me because it so completely disregards the majority of the <br/>
&gt; history of American schools in favor of studying New York&#39;s navel.   He&#39;s <br/>
&gt; talking about schools in industrial New England, and that&#39;s not altogether the <br/>
&gt; history of &quot;American Education.&quot;<br/>
