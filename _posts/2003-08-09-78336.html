&gt; unschooling and what works for them in a way that is positive and looks<br/>
&gt; appealing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ummm--come to the conference? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, many of us met each other IRL last year. We&#39;ve stayed in one <br/>
anothers&#39; homes, we&#39;ve observed each other and been observed BY others with our <br/>
children---so we *know* it&#39;s not &quot;all talk and no walk.&quot; Many of us talk <br/>
off-line to each other about our own lives. I&#39;d classify it as comraderie, NOT a <br/>
clique. We have many of the same interests ---and the overwhelming HUGE <br/>
interest is in UNschooling: the purpose of these lists and boards and conferences. So <br/>
we &quot;CLICK&quot; on the same topic. We understand it. We LIVE it completely and <br/>
purely and radically and from deep in our hearts. It&#39;s a part of us and we like <br/>
to share it.<br/>
<br/>
I think from the &quot;outside&quot;, yes, it can look clique-ish. But cliques are <br/>
there to keep people OUT. We are DYING to share unschooling with you and ANYone <br/>
who wants it! That&#39;s why we put SO many hours into it. SOOOO many hours! <br/>
<br/>
We say over and over and over to read, read, read. Because there&#39;s not a <br/>
question that I&#39;ve heard in a year, that hasn&#39;t been asked and answered already <br/>
SEVERAL times here and on the boards. And yet we keep answering them, because <br/>
there are more newbies coming in every day. I&#39;d love to see the list become a <br/>
place that unschooling is discussed, not re-hashed (and there IS one list like <br/>
that, for already-unschoolers)---but I&#39;ll happily join in and re-hash again and <br/>
again---as we all do. THAT wish will maybe be realized with our <br/>
grandchildren&#39;s children---when unschooling IS the mainstream and school is &quot;alternative&quot;! &lt;<br/>
g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all questioned unschooling and education and learning to the point that <br/>
we KNOW what we&#39;re talking about---and many say it SO well, I&#39;m just awed! <br/>
We&#39;ve recently questioned cliques---and we realize that we&#39;re NOT a clique <br/>
because we don&#39;t keep people OUT, we welcome them IN. Because it is a questioning <br/>
group, and we LOVE questions about unschooling, we&#39;re thrilled to introduce <br/>
newbies to Holt&#39;s principles---But we&#39;re not really good with those that want to <br/>
waste our time arguing the benefits of workbooks and curricula and external <br/>
motivation and school (and spanking! &lt;g&gt;). It&#39;s a waste of time on an <br/>
unschooling e-list. They can go somewhere else, because there are MANY more lists that <br/>
will happily cover those things----and tell how important they are to your <br/>
child&#39;s well-being. We disagree.. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a reason this list is so big. And it&#39;s not because people don&#39;t feel <br/>
welcome (although there are obviously some!). We&#39;re not pushing this down <br/>
folks&#39; throats. *They* come *here*---on their own accord. They are &quot;guests&quot; until <br/>
they feel a part of the family (Got that Brenda? &lt;g&gt;)---but THEY have to make <br/>
that decision to be a part of the family----or not. It&#39;s up to them. <br/>
<br/>
I subbed and unsubbed three times before I settled in for good---because of <br/>
the icky bickering that went on. But I wasn&#39;t family *then*. I&#39;m VERY <br/>
comfortable here now. I won&#39;t leave. You and everyone else has that option too. &quot;It it <br/>
doesn&#39;t fit, you can always quit.&quot; (to botch the OJ lawyer)  You *might* be <br/>
back---many do that because they realize that it&#39;s worth it. You may not. It&#39;s <br/>
up to you, not the list, because the list is what it is---and it does its job <br/>
VERY well.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t easy---to grasp or to implement---AT FIRST. It gets easier <br/>
and easier the more you *do* it. It&#39;s life-changing and awe-inspiring and <br/>
SOOOO kid-friendly! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I know that newbies don&#39;t know that and I know that when they first come <br/>
here, it seems sooo &quot;in your face&quot;. That&#39;s why we ask that they read, read, read. <br/>
Because that way they can get a feel of what each poster is like----OVER <br/>
TIME---and they can get a feel for the dynamics of the list---plus, they can see <br/>
their own questions already in print ---and answered. We&#39;re NOT trying to brush <br/>
anyone off. We&#39;re TRYING to help.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would help to understand that and to picture every one of us <br/>
wanting you to GET unschooling (and as Sandra says----offer *our* kids more options <br/>
for future mates! &lt;G&gt;) than to picture us as the unschooling elite who don&#39;t <br/>
want you in our &quot;club&quot;. We DO want you in our &quot;club&quot;---and we want you there <br/>
as quickly as possible, so no namby-pamby talk from us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sit back, read, read, and read some more. Attend a conference as soon as you <br/>
can afford it, and PLAY and BE with your children. Ask us questions: we are <br/>
here to answer them. But please don&#39;t bitch and moan about our delivery systems. <br/>
We are all different, and you can choose one you like the best---and some of <br/>
us will even take &quot;private&quot; consultations via e-mail. Just ask your favorite <br/>
poster whether s/he&#39;s willing. S/he can only say , &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Good unschooling!<br/>

to bitch about us there. Here? It just disrupts the list that should devote <br/>
itself to unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445566075">Why? *I* don&#39;t get it, I really don&#39;t. I thought the post was well done.<br/>
I also thought the discussion was going well. Lots of sharing how posters<br/>
felt about the subject.  I&#39;ve *always* been outside any cliques. Never in<br/>
the inner cicle, anytime, anywhere. Probably never will. I don&#39;t feel there<br/>
is one here. Frequent posters, sometime posters and lurkers. Info, advice,<br/>
sharing, family life stories and websites, comfort and celebrating. That&#39;s<br/>
what I see here. Now one more opinion to add to the mix. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! Yes!<br/>
<br/>
And if you can read the archives, even better.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, if you go to the Messages at Yahoo&#39;s Unschooling-Discussion webpage,<br/>
there&#39;s a link above the list of messages on the left side that says &quot;Expand<br/>
messages&quot; or something like that. If you click there, it will show you 20 or<br/>
so messages at a time, sort of like a digest. It&#39;s *much* easier than<br/>
clicking through the messages one by one, with the full screen ads popping<br/>
up periodically.)<br/>
<br/>
When I first visited AOL&#39;s homeschooling forum it was very intimidating. All<br/>
these people who knew so much and could spot the least little bit of off<br/>
thinking and weren&#39;t afraid to point it out.<br/>
<br/>
So I read and read and read. When I was done with the message boards I read<br/>
the archives, going back 3 or 4 years.<br/>
<br/>
After that it was like I&#39;d actually been on the list for 3 or 4 years.  I<br/>
knew the people, I knew the topic. Which made it very easy to post.<br/>
