Parents say: <br/>
&quot;[My son] has never experienced such openness, such honesty and such<br/>
loveand he is renewed. He feels accepted, uplifted, empowered and,<br/>
above all else, valued! Y ou are working magic at NBTSC.nurturing<br/>
wings. I applaud you and thank you.&quot; <br/>
&quot;My kids really love NBTSC and all of their new friends. It makes<br/>
homeschooling a lot less lonely for them when they meet a diverse group<br/>
of open minded homeschoolers. Thank you for your part in helping my<br/>
children achieve strength, confidence, and independence.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I have seen so many of the Vancouver kids come back from camp with<br/>
subtle (or not so subtle) changes in maturity, confidence etc. I can&#39;t<br/>
thank you enough for what you do by giving these kids the chance to be<br/>
together and spread their wings like this.&quot; <br/>
&quot;The camp was fabulous for [my daughter] and the kids were too -- very<br/>
different from her high school friends, in maturity, drive,<br/>
self-assuredness, openness and vulnerability.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Just a quick note of appreciation from a very pleased parent! I know<br/>
[my son] had one of the best weeks of his life and he&#39;s had a lot of<br/>
excellent weeks in his 17 years back he comes from camp with a zillion<br/>
new friendshe promptly hooked us up to email and in the last 3-4 weeks<br/>
has written well over 100 letters!&quot; <br/>
&quot;My son returned from your camp with renewed enthusiasm for life and<br/>
learning! Thank you so much for having this get-together of, apparently,<br/>
some of the most gifted and interesting people on earth!&quot; <br/>
&quot;[Our daughter] returned to us full of self-assurance, excitement, and<br/>
positive loving energy. The revelation that there are other teenagers<br/>
out there with her unschooler ideas was a delightful awakening for her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I should tell you that [my son] had a wonderful time at NBTSC. It&#39;s<br/>
resulted in some significant changes in how [he] approaches life, and<br/>
he&#39;s enthusiastic about going back next year.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
Hello! <br/>
This booklet contains lots of information about Not Back to School Camp,<br/>
so you can make an informed decision as to whether you want to join the<br/>
ruckus. We&#39;ve had a blast during our first six camp seasons and plan to<br/>
do so again in 2002! If you have questions, please check first to see<br/>
whether we&#39;ve already answered them in this booklet or on our website<br/>
(www.nbtsc.org). If we haven&#39;t, feel free to phone, fax, write, or<br/>
email, and we&#39;ll get back to you ASAP. <br/>
Who <br/>
You: Unschoolers/homeschoolers from anywhere on this planet are invited,<br/>
if they speak English and are between the ages of 13 and 18. Can you<br/>
still come if you go to school part time? Or if you&#39;re not yet a<br/>
homeschooler, but are about to become one? Or if you&#39;ve &quot;graduated&quot; from<br/>
homeschooling and now attend college or hold a job? Or if you have<br/>
smelly feet? Sure. The maximum number of campers possible is about 105<br/>
in Oregon, 115 in West Virginia. <br/>
Your staff: Your hosts are Grace Llewellyn and Taber Shadburne. Grace is<br/>
best known as the author of The Teenage Liberation Handbook: how to quit<br/>
school and get a real life and education and the founder of NBTSC. Taber<br/>
is a psychotherapist and personal growth workshop leader. He&#39;s worked at<br/>
NBTSC since 1998 and this will be his third year co-directing. We will<br/>
be joined by a terrific staff of 11 in West Virginia, 20 in Oregon. <br/>
(Non) religious orientation: NBTSC is a non-denominational,<br/>
non-religious camp. We strive to honor each person&#39;s religious beliefs<br/>
or lack thereof, and ask that all campers do likewise. <br/>
Not Back to School Camp welcomes diversity. We are open to homeschoolers<br/>
and unschoolers of all races, ethnic backgrounds, genders, religious<br/>
beliefs, sexual orientations, economic backgrounds, and physical<br/>
capabilities. <br/>
Where <br/>
Sessions 1 and 2: We meet in Eugene, Oregon. Our buses will deliver you<br/>
to our home for the week, and back to Eugene at the end of the week.<br/>
Camp Myrtlewood is near the tiny town of Bridge, Oregon. It&#39;s about 120<br/>
miles Southwest of Eugene, in the coastal mountain range. <br/>
Session 3: We meet in Cumberland, Maryland. As in Oregon, our buses will<br/>
deliver you to our camp home and then back to Cumberland again. Buffalo<br/>
Gap is nestled in the mountains near the tiny town of Capon Bridge, West<br/>
Virginia. It&#39;s about 80 miles Southwest of Cumberland. (It&#39;s also just a<br/>
few hours&#39; drive from either Washington, Baltimore, or Pittsburgh.) <br/>
Lodging and facilities: You&#39;ll stay in a clean, simple cabin. Girls and<br/>
boys have separate cabins; all ages are mixed together. Bathrooms are in<br/>
separate buildings a few yards away. Staff generally stays in separate<br/>
cabins or rooms. Both sites have all the facilities we need for a great<br/>
week, plenty of room for eating, workshops, dances, games, sports,<br/>
hiking, and enjoying nature. Camp Myrtlewood offers a pretty creek with<br/>
a swimming hole; Buffalo Gap offers a 2-acre spring-fed lake (with a<br/>
diving platform, sliding board, and sandy beach), a sauna, and 2 big<br/>
dance halls (one is also a basketball gym). <br/>
Weather: In both Oregon and West Virginia, chances are good we&#39;ll have<br/>
warm weather with coldish nights. It may rain a bit, particularly in<br/>
Oregonit often does, but we just keep on playing anyway. <br/>
What We&#39;re Gonna Do <br/>
Swim; talk; sing; drum; dance; hike; stare at the sky; play volleyball<br/>
and softball and soccer; take creative, emotional, and intellectual<br/>
risks; encourage each other to do amazing things; have talent shows;<br/>
teach and learn from each other. Each camper will be encouraged to<br/>
contribute both creatively (teach a workshop, lead a sport or group<br/>
singing, etc.) and not-quite-so-creatively (wash dishes, cut vegetables,<br/>
pick up trash, etc.). <br/>
Daily schedule: Each day we have a morning meeting and a brief evening<br/>
meeting; everyone is required to attend both, during which important<br/>
announcements are made and campers and staff are able to raise concerns.<br/>
Everyone is also encouraged, but not forced, to participate in evening<br/>
group activities. And we share mealtimes, of course. Beyond this, there<br/>
are many scheduled daytime activities, sports games, and workshopsled<br/>
both by staff and by you and your peers. You can choose among these<br/>
daytime activitiesor nap, talk with a new friend, or create your own<br/>
fun. <br/>
Evening events: are specialsometimes simple, sometimes elaborate... .a<br/>
campfire sing-along, talent shows, dancing, and other good stuff. <br/>
Workshopsa sampling: We&#39;ll have literally dozens of workshops to choose<br/>
from during the week. They&#39;ll reflect the talents and interests of all<br/>
staff and campers. At previous camps, we&#39;ve had about 100 workshops per<br/>
week, including breakdancing, solar cooking, kung fu, orienteering,<br/>
yoga, cob-oven building, web-page designing, surrealist games,<br/>
co-counseling, VW engine fixing, drama, poetry, getting published and<br/>
self-publishing, origami, art booklets, swing dancing, youth rights,<br/>
tree identification, beading, and photography. You can decide each day<br/>
what you want to do. We do offer a lot of really good workshops and we<br/>
expect that each of you will go home with new skills you&#39;re excited<br/>
about. But the point is not to be frantically busy, and it&#39;s fine if you<br/>
don&#39;t want to participate in lots of these organized activities. The sun<br/>
and the forest will have plenty of suggestions of their own. <br/>
Your workshop or sport: Each camper is strongly encouraged to lead a<br/>
workshop or coach/teach a game/sport. Most workshops run 1 to 1 continue<br/>
a discussion over lunch. You do NOT necessarily have to be an expert in<br/>
your field to teach a workshop. As many NBTSC campers have discovered,<br/>
even if you are a beginner, you can be a good workshop teacher. If you<br/>
need supplies, we can provide basic art and office supplies, a boom box,<br/>
sports equipment, and a few other items, but you will need to provide<br/>
most other materials. <br/>
Sports: We typically play volleyball, basketball, soccer, ultimate<br/>
frisbee, and softball. If there&#39;s another sport you want to play,<br/>
volunteer to start a game. <br/>
Unscheduled activities: Most of the time you&#39;re free to make your own<br/>
fun if you don&#39;t feel like participating in a group activity. You can<br/>
swim whenever the swimming hole or lake is supervised, hike on trails,<br/>
talk with new friends, read, nap, swing, practice a new skill... <br/>
Show and tell nights: Talent shows are a great highlight of camp. You<br/>
can play music, balance on a ping pong ball, dance, sing, show your<br/>
artwork, do stand up comedy, turn cartwheels, juggle forks, tell us the<br/>
wildest thing that ever happened to your family, swallow a sword, read<br/>
your poetry or a very short story, or just stand up and tell us what<br/>
makes you tick. You might consider getting up and performing or sharing<br/>
something related to your workshop. You&#39;ll have up to 4 minutes if<br/>
you&#39;re going solo, or up to 7 minutes if you&#39;re in a group of 2 or more.<br/>
<br/>
Staff <br/>
Our multi-faceted, caring, funny, altogether delightful staff is one of<br/>
the best things about NBTSC. They teach outstanding workshops and coach<br/>
sports, lead group singing, facilitate discussions, cook great food, and<br/>
those who aren&#39;t exhausted sometimes stay up late and join in the<br/>
after-midnight revels. For the most part, our experience is that the<br/>
staff adores the campers and the campers adore the staff. <br/>
Advisors: One staff person will be your designated &quot;advisor&quot; during the<br/>
week. Although you are welcome to talk with any of us about concerns or<br/>
questions, this person is responsible for checking in with you<br/>
regularly, making sure you&#39;re accounted for several times a day, etc.<br/>
You&#39;ll also meet briefly with your advisor (and about 10 other campers)<br/>
each morning as part of our meeting, to check in, discuss concerns, ask<br/>
questions. <br/>
Food <br/>
Three yummy, simple vegetarian meals each day. Vegan alternatives for<br/>
people who request them in advance, and we can usually accommodate<br/>
wheat-free diets too. People with numerous allergies or other special<br/>
diets may need to supply some or all of their own food. (In Oregon, we<br/>
prepare our own food and use mostly organically grown ingredients. In<br/>
West Virginia, the Buffalo Gap staff will cook for us, and<br/>
unfortunately, organic ingredients would knock the price tag of camp up<br/>
too high. In future years we hope to jiggle the budget in order to<br/>
provide OG food there without raising camp fees.) <br/>
money <br/>
The cost of NBTSC (including supplies, food, local transportation, staff<br/>
salaries, labor, lodging, overhead, etc.) is $485 per person. The camp<br/>
fee includes just about everything: travel from and to Eugene or<br/>
Cumberland, hearty meals, lodging, almost all activities. (Some campers<br/>
or staff may plan workshops with a small additional materials fee, and<br/>
we&#39;ll offer an optional day trip which will require a $25 transportation<br/>
fee. In Oregon, our field trip goes to the coast; we&#39;ll let you know our<br/>
West Virginia destination later.) You&#39;ll also receive a directory of all<br/>
campers and staff, and a &quot;bliss book&quot;a zine full of notes on workshops<br/>
and other stuff people feel passionate about. <br/>
Please register (with a deposit) by March 18. After that date, your cost<br/>
increases by $25. You may want to register much sooner to get into the<br/>
session of your choice. A $75 non-refundable deposit is due with your<br/>
registration. The balance is due 6 weeks before the start of camp, and<br/>
it is very important that you get it in on time. If your balance is not<br/>
received on time, we will add a $25 late fee, and if it&#39;s not in one<br/>
month before camp starts we&#39;ll have to drop you from the roster and give<br/>
your spot to someone else. If your plans change, the balance (if paid<br/>
early) can be refunded up until 6 weeks before camp starts. If you<br/>
prefer, you are welcome to pay the whole camp fee at the time of<br/>
registration. <br/>
About refunds: While in the past we had a strict policy of not giving<br/>
refunds of deposits at all, and not of other camp funds past a certain<br/>
date, we now charge enough money for camp that we generally cover all<br/>
our costs when all sessions of camp are full, and are therefore able to<br/>
give partial refunds in some cases. In a nutshell: we do not give ANY<br/>
refunds until after camp is over. At that point, we will give refunds in<br/>
this priority: <br/>
1.                  anyone who got contagiously sick enough at the last<br/>
minute that we asked them not to come to camp gets a refund of all but<br/>
$40 of their camp fees. (We may require a written and signed statement<br/>
from a healthcare provider. And, sorry, but we are talking only about<br/>
contagious diseases here, not broken legs or non-contagious illnesses.) <br/>
2.                  if all sessions of camp were full, then we may give<br/>
some partial refunds with priority going to people who canceled<br/>
earliest. We will always retain a $40 processing fee, but at our<br/>
discretion may refund everything else, including the initial deposit. Be<br/>
sure to make a written request (email or fax is fine) if you want a<br/>
refund; otherwise we will keep your full deposit or camp fees and use<br/>
them for miscellaneous camp expensesor, if there are none, your fees<br/>
will go into our scholarship fund. <br/>
Scholarships and work trade positions: We offer 12 half-price<br/>
scholarships for families who couldn&#39;t otherwise afford NBTSC. Also, we<br/>
have 5 work-trade positions available. These, too, are for families who<br/>
would otherwise have trouble paying for camp. If you&#39;d like an<br/>
application for either a scholarship or work-trade, send a SASE to our<br/>
office or see our website. We may have a few additional scholarships<br/>
available also, of varying amounts, thanks to our new scholarship fund<br/>
(see below). The deadline to apply for these scholarships is March 18,<br/>
2002. However, we may also have some additional scholarship money<br/>
available after that point. <br/>
Fundraising: People earn camp money in all kinds of waysone girl sells<br/>
candy in her yard, right after the nearby school gets out in the<br/>
afternoon, while kids are walking home. Some people get jobs. One girl<br/>
earned all of her 1999 money by playing her violin on street corners.<br/>
You could also ask for a group of your friends and relativesor your<br/>
local homeschool support groupto sponsor you, spreading the cost among<br/>
lots of people. <br/>
Some people earn money by selling copies of Grace&#39;s books (The Teenage<br/>
Liberation Handbook, Real Lives, and Freedom Challenge) to friends,<br/>
relatives, school friends, local homeschoolers, whoever. (Several<br/>
campers have sold over 50 copies of the TLH to their friends.) You earn<br/>
approximately 35%, or $6-$6.60, for each copy. Contact us for more info.<br/>
(Sorry, but Genius Tribe book fairs are no longer an option, since the<br/>
Genius Tribe catalog is going extinct.) <br/>
Donating to our tax-deductible scholarship fund!!! <br/>
Thanks to the Self-Education Foundation, you or your parents or your<br/>
fairy godfathers can give money that will be in turn given to people who<br/>
couldn&#39;t otherwise afford to come to camp. This fund is in addition to<br/>
our standard practice of offering a set number of half-scholarships and<br/>
worktrades each year. With this fund, we do whatever feels most<br/>
appropriatein one case that means contributing $100 to someone&#39;s camp<br/>
fees; in another case it could mean a full scholarship plus a $200<br/>
travel stipend. Please consider giving to this fund, or asking other<br/>
people to, now or in the future. (We know a lot of you are gonna get<br/>
rich 10 or 20 years from now, and we hope that when you do, you remember<br/>
your good old alma mater in your hearts and your wills and your<br/>
checkbooks.) <br/>
To support this fund, please make out your check to the Self Education<br/>
Foundation and mark in your check&#39;s memo line (or in an accompanying<br/>
note) that the money is specifically for the NBTSC scholarship fund.<br/>
Mail to us or to the Self Education Foundation, P.O. Box 30790,<br/>
Philadelphia, PA 19104. Thank you!!! <br/>
The Self-Education Foundation, by the way, is a fantastic philanthropic<br/>
organization. (It was founded by Billy Wimsatt, who was a NBTSC staffer<br/>
in &#39;96 and &#39;97 and is the author of Bomb the Suburbs and No More<br/>
Prisons, 2 of Grace&#39;s favorite books. And I, Grace, serve on its board.)<br/>
It works to build and support a cohesive movement, across cultures and<br/>
disciplines, of people initiating their own education. It funds,<br/>
supports, and networks unschoolers and education mavericks from tough<br/>
backgrounds who have added barriers to successfully educating<br/>
themselves, their kids, their communities, and the world. For more info,<br/>
check out www.selfeducation.org. <br/>
You should also know that another source of scholarship donations is our<br/>
beloved NBTSC stafferseach year one or two staffers give up some or all<br/>
of their pay, and it goes directly toward camp scholarships instead. <br/>
The Fine Print <br/>
Responsibilities: Each person contributes to the spiffiness of camp in<br/>
two major ways: <br/>
1) fun, possibly creative work which draws on your unique talents. Each<br/>
of you will be asked to coach a game or sport, lifeguard for an<br/>
afternoon at the swimming hole, teach a workshop, lead the singing<br/>
around the campfire one night, or some such. <br/>
2) You&#39;ll get to perform a few grungy, possibly even disgusting menial<br/>
chores too! We help prepare meals, clean up after them, keep the<br/>
bathrooms clean, and clean our cabins before we leave. You may have to<br/>
scrub a toilet or 2, but hey, you&#39;ll have partners and you can whistle<br/>
while you work. Each camper has about 4-5 hours of chores during the<br/>
week. <br/>
Travel arrangements: You can fly, drive, train, bicycle, or bus into<br/>
Eugene or Cumberland. (In Oregon, some people fly into Portland and then<br/>
take the bus or train down to Eugene. In West Virginia, you may find it<br/>
cheaper to fly into Pittsburgh, Baltimore, or Washington DC and then<br/>
take the bus or train from there.) In both Oregon and West Virginia, our<br/>
buses will pick campers up at the Greyhound bus depot, the Amtrak train<br/>
station, the airport, and a city park. On our last day, we&#39;ll return you<br/>
to your pick of those same locations. You should arrive by 2:30 if<br/>
possible, and 4:00 at the absolute latest. On our last day, you should<br/>
arrive back in Eugene or Cumberland by noon. You can also drive<br/>
yourself, or have someone else drive you, directly to Camp Myrtlewood or<br/>
Buffalo Gap. If you have a car with you during the week, you absolutely<br/>
may not drive itno matter how old you areand must turn your keys over<br/>
to us until camp is over. <br/>
Eugene has a small commercial airport serviced by several major airlines<br/>
including United; many campers fly into Eugene directly. Others fly into<br/>
Portland, 100 miles north, and then take the bus or train down to<br/>
Eugene. Cumberland has a smallish airport serviced by US Airways<br/>
Express, with frequent flights in from Pittsburgh. You may want to fly<br/>
into a larger nearby airport (such as Pittsburgh, Dulles, or Reagan) and<br/>
take the bus or train from there. <br/>
If you can&#39;t arrive early enough on the first day, or leave late enough<br/>
on the last day, we can make arrangements for you to stay in a hotel<br/>
room with other campers and a staff person; cost will be approximately<br/>
$35. Please do not take advantage of this offer unless your travel<br/>
schedule really requires it! It is a pain for us to supervise hotel<br/>
rooms and play taxi. Be aware that hotel rooms will probably be<br/>
supervised (at least in the past, the hotel we have worked with has<br/>
required that) and we will enforce a curfew. <br/>
A logistical note for people attending both sessions 1 and 2: You may<br/>
either ride the buses back to Eugene in between the two sessions, or for<br/>
about $80 you can stay at Camp Myrtlewood for the 3 extra nights. If you<br/>
do, you&#39;ll need to do some chores, be mellowstaff will be in long<br/>
meetings and deep comasand move temporarily into a different cabin.<br/>
You&#39;ll have a chance to do laundry and we&#39;ll feed you. If you go back to<br/>
Eugene, you&#39;re on your ownsorry, but we can&#39;t help you make hotel<br/>
arrangements or provide any transportation except for the bus ride from<br/>
and to camp. <br/>
If you have special needs: Both Camp Myrtlewood and Buffalo Gap can<br/>
accommodate wheelchairs, though like any outdoor setting they can pose<br/>
challenges to anyone (including people in &quot;normal&quot; physical condition).<br/>
Educate us about your needs, and we&#39;ll do our best to make your week<br/>
comfortable, safe, and exciting. <br/>
Health and safety: There is no camp nurse or other medical person on<br/>
staff. There will, however, be at least one staff person trained in<br/>
first aid and CPR. In case of emergency, you will be taken by ambulance<br/>
to the nearest hospital (approximately 45 minutes away). You must<br/>
basically be responsible for your own health, bring any (regular)<br/>
necessary medications with you, etc. Your camp fee does include<br/>
insurance for accidents/injuries that take place on the camp grounds. <br/>
What if you get sick when it&#39;s time to come to camp? <br/>
Depending on how sick you are and what you have, we may ask you not to<br/>
come. We will consider on a case-by-case basis whether people who are<br/>
already sick (and contagious) should attend. If we ask you not to<br/>
attend, we will give you a refund of all your money, minus a $40<br/>
processing fee. (Before sending the refund we may request that you send<br/>
a signed statement from a healthcare provider.) <br/>
More information later <br/>
In approximately June 2002 you&#39;ll receive a handbook which includes a<br/>
list of what to bring and plenty of other information to help you<br/>
prepare for and get the most out of camp. In the meantime, hang onto<br/>
this booklet. <br/>
Answers to questions some people ask, or are gonna ask <br/>
Why can&#39;t each session of NBTSC be longer? <br/>
1) Because that would make it too expensive for many people. <br/>
2) Because that would make it harder to find staff (many staff people<br/>
come to <br/>
NBTSC on their vacations). <br/>
3) Because the staff gets tired and needs a break. <br/>
Why is NBTSC vegetarian? <br/>
We do not intend to make any kind of moral or political statement about<br/>
diet. NBTSC staff includes vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores. Your<br/>
co-directors, Grace and Taber, have at different times in their lives<br/>
been vegetarians, vegans, raw foodists, and carnivores. But for our<br/>
purposes at camp, meat is both too expensive and too unsanitary. We are<br/>
sticklers about providing healthy, mostly organically grown ingredients<br/>
whenever possible, and organic and chemical-free meat is way expensive.<br/>
Also, because many campers are vegetarian, our vegetarian menu helps us<br/>
to satisfy the largest number of people without preparing a ton of<br/>
different dishes at each meal. You are welcome to bring your own meat<br/>
supplements (jerky, tuna in cans, dried fish, etc.) if you want. (At<br/>
Buffalo Gap, our meals will not be prepared by NBTSC staff, and will not<br/>
be mostly organic, at least not in 2002.) <br/>
How will the West Virginia camp be different from the Oregon camp? <br/>
We have a big swimming lake rather than a sweet little creek (though in<br/>
October, some of us may feel a little borderline about swimming). There<br/>
are more (and larger) indoor spaces available to us. Their staff will be<br/>
cooking for usthey&#39;ll serve vegetarian and vegan meals (they won&#39;t,<br/>
unfortunately, have much in the way of organic ingredients). Hopefully,<br/>
we&#39;ll attract more east coast folks. And, of course, there&#39;ll just be<br/>
the adventure of a new place. <br/>
Rules <br/>
For people who have attended NBTSC in the past: this year we will be<br/>
making a sincere effort to simplify our rules and agreements. No, this<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that now it is ok for people to walk on the tables; it does<br/>
mean that we will convey some of our expectations in other ways besides<br/>
rules. <br/>
An overwhelming number of past campers have commented that with our<br/>
policies and attitudes they felt free, trusted, and yet safe and well<br/>
cared for. The rules we do have are very importantdesigned to protect<br/>
everyone&#39;s safety and peace, and to ensure that we can continue to have<br/>
NBTSC, yet without limiting freedom unnecessarily. Please do be aware<br/>
that for any serious rule infractions, we always contact parents. Our<br/>
past experience has been that for the most part, we get along superbly<br/>
and people respect each other and the rules. <br/>
Our rules are relatively lax compared to those of most other camps and<br/>
youth activities. In particular, we have very few required activities on<br/>
the schedule, and we do not have a set bedtime or require you to sleep<br/>
in your assigned bed. Instead, we ask you to use your time well<br/>
according to your own values, and we ask you to create, and then use, a<br/>
&quot;bedtime policy&quot; that serves your own particular needs and goals at<br/>
camp, and regardless of where you sleep, we expect you to honor our &quot;no<br/>
sex at camp&quot; rule. <br/>
We often refer to our rules as agreements. Camp is not something we, the<br/>
government, your parents, or your friends require you to doit is<br/>
something you choose to do. (In fact, our first and most important rule<br/>
is that you cannot come to camp unless it is your own free choice to do<br/>
so.) In choosing to be there, we expect you to agree to act in the way<br/>
that we ask you to, in order to help co-create the best possible camp<br/>
for you and everyone else. <br/>
an important note for parents and campers <br/>
on bedtimes and sleeping arrangements <br/>
We want to clarify a few things in light of some questions and concerns<br/>
expressed by parents, and in light of some (rather different) questions<br/>
and concerns expressed by campers. We have carefully considered and<br/>
reconsidered our goals for camp, and at least for 2002, this is where we<br/>
stand: <br/>
As in the past, we do not plan to enforce a bedtime at camp. We will<br/>
continue to require lights out/quiet in cabins from midnight to 8 a.m.,<br/>
but allow people to stay up later in the lodge, at the campfire circle,<br/>
etc. <br/>
We do, however, ask each camper to write up a personal policy that they<br/>
will use to determine when to go to bed each night, based on what they<br/>
understand about themselves and what is important to them during the<br/>
camp week. This is a new program, which we started in 2001; it was very<br/>
effective at Session 1, and somewhat effective at Session 2. (We didn&#39;t<br/>
work so hard to convey its importance at Session 2, largely because it<br/>
went so well Session 1 that we wrongly assumed we didn&#39;t need to work at<br/>
it for Session 2.) We do this because while we don&#39;t want to<br/>
unnecessarily limit freedom, we do want campers to take good care of<br/>
themselves and get enough sleep. And, we want to encourage more<br/>
participation in daytime workshops and activities. <br/>
Also (and as in the past), we do not plan to require campers to sleep in<br/>
their assigned beds. (We don&#39;t allow girls in boys&#39; cabins or vice<br/>
versa, though.) Most campers sleep in their beds most of the time. Some<br/>
campers, however, sleep in groups (which are often mixed-gender) in<br/>
public spaces or outside. Sometimes these groups are affectionate and<br/>
cuddly. To be a little more blunt, at times they are just heaps of<br/>
peopleto those of us on staff, they sometimes look quite uncomfortable.<br/>
While we firmly expect campers to observe our &quot;no sex at camp&quot; and &quot;no<br/>
nudity&quot; rules (and initiate plenty of dialogue when that seems called<br/>
for), we do not police these groups. Our observation (borne out by many<br/>
candid reports from individual campers) is that while occasionally there<br/>
is some mildly sexual behavior, by and large these &quot;people piles&quot; are<br/>
innocent. We feel that while they do make it possible for people to bend<br/>
the rules, there are other ways for people to bend the rules who have<br/>
decided to do so, and that to tighten our policy in this regard would be<br/>
more of a detriment than a benefit to camp and campers. <br/>
Because we know that some campers may not be fully ready to make their<br/>
own healthiest choices about this (and other) matters, and because as<br/>
parents you know your kids better than we do, we suggest that you talk<br/>
about this subject as a family, and perhaps clarify your own<br/>
expectations or agreements independently of camp rules and policies. In<br/>
other words, we do stand behind the rules that we set, and take<br/>
reasonable steps to ensure that they are followed, but we cannot be<br/>
responsible for making sure that your kids behave the way that you think<br/>
is best for them. <br/>
In the past, we have swung to different sides of the pendulumtightening<br/>
things up at parents&#39; requests, then seeing (and hearing from campers)<br/>
that we&#39;ve caused more harm than good, preventing innocent affection<br/>
more than anything else, and so swinging back to a looser stance. We&#39;re<br/>
hoping to strike a better balance, in part by asking youthe parentsto<br/>
get involved by having your own family discussions. (It might also be<br/>
helpful for you to talk, as a family, about what kind of a bedtime<br/>
policy might work best. In our spring mailing we will include some<br/>
examples of policies that worked well in 2001.) <br/>
Grace says: If your family runs into road blocks in negotiating this<br/>
territory (or any other, for that matter), or you simply want some help<br/>
in creating a win-win agreement, I&#39;d highly recommend a phone<br/>
consultation with Taber Shadburne, my co-director. He&#39;s a<br/>
psychotherapist and family counselor who specializes in this sort of<br/>
thing and I think he&#39;s about as skilled and insightful as they come. If<br/>
money is an issue, he may be able to work out a discount or partial<br/>
trade or some such. You can reach him at 510-336-3391, or<br/>

One more note. Our experience at camp has always been that most campers<br/>
are extremely maturethat is, cooperative, beyond the need to rebel for<br/>
rebellion&#39;s sake, and kind and empathetic to staff as well as to each<br/>
other. When we envision our policies at future camps, it is always with<br/>
this kind of maturity in mind. In the unlikely event that we ever find<br/>
ourselves with a different quality of camp community, we will need to<br/>
shift the way we do things. We are committed to creating the best<br/>
possible balance of freedom and caretaking, given the particular group<br/>
of human beings that we find ourselves serving. <br/>

<br/>
Campers say: <br/>
&quot;I feel genuine kinship and community here. I&#39;m going back to my usual<br/>
home with feelings of hope and inspiration and a clearer vision for my<br/>
horizons.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Wonderful people, and everyone following their bliss. Camp is an<br/>
energizing bath of joyful energy that left me full of awe and<br/>
inspiration for my own life.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Camp was one of the most inspiring and purifying experiences I&#39;ve ever<br/>
had. It makes me hungry for life again.&quot; <br/>
&quot;This camp was by far the best thing that ever happened to me.&quot; <br/>
&quot;The only thing I don&#39;t like about camp is leaving at the end. I mean I<br/>
know that we have to leave at some point, but I wish we didn`t. I just<br/>
love camp that much.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I had never been in such a big group of people that were so open,<br/>
nonjudgmental, loving, honest, and just wonderful to be around! The<br/>
energy of it all was so incredibly awesome! It was the best experience I<br/>
have ever had.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I will definitely be coming back next year and for both sessions!!! I<br/>
had the time of my life at NBTSC!&quot; <br/>
&quot;1 just want to let you all know how much of a great time 1 had at camp.<br/>
I really think the people at camp were the most open, loving, fun and<br/>
supportive group of young adults. Thank you all for the things I learned<br/>
at camp. I really, really, really want to be there next year!&quot; <br/>
&quot;Overall, I think this was the best week of my life. The energy of<br/>
vibrant, thinking, life-loving people is the most intensely powerful<br/>
thing I can imagine.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Camp is good for me. It&#39;s good for my spirit. It totally rejuvenates<br/>
me, and inspires me. This is partly who Jam, camp affects everyone a<br/>
little differently, of course. Don`t send your kid here thinking they&#39;ll<br/>
come home some kind of superkid. Camp isn`t for the parent. It`s for the<br/>
kid. It&#39;s an experience they won`t forget. But everyone processes<br/>
differently, and every kid may NOT come home totally inspired. The<br/>
majority will, I suppose....&quot; <br/>
&quot;Never before has a camp had such an effect on me as this one. I was so<br/>
at peace with myself and others, it was incredible. I never wanted to<br/>
leave.&quot; <br/>
&quot;This camp gives you the feeling that no matter who you are or wherever<br/>
you re from, you will always be welcome!&quot; <br/>
&quot;Camp has been the best three weeks of the last three years of my life.<br/>
Some of my very favorite people are the people I&#39;ve met here in the last<br/>
three years.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Every year it continues to amaze me how so many wonderful, accepting<br/>
people there really are. I&#39;ve made more lasting friends at camp than in<br/>
the whole rest of my life put together.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m writing to say again how thrilled lam with camp. You get together<br/>
such a great group of wonderful, talented people. I&#39;m really amazed at<br/>
your ability to make it work so well.&quot; &quot;I feel like a different and<br/>
better person! I haven`t even fought with my sister who also went to<br/>
camp. Or my other siblings for that matter.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Camp is the high point of my unschool year. Each time I make new<br/>
friends, learn new things, and leave with a beautiful feeling.&quot; <br/>
&quot;To be at NBTSC is a life changing experience. It sounds like a cliché<br/>
but it&#39;s never been more genuine than in this case.&quot; <br/>
&quot;This was the funnest camp I&#39;ve ever been to and everyone was so nice!&quot; <br/>
&quot;Not Back to School Camp has consistently and persistently demanded that<br/>
I try new things and challenge the way I look at the world. I have come<br/>
across so many amazing people with amazing talents, I think I have a new<br/>
family of 120 people!&quot; <br/>
&quot;I was thrilled by everything: the idea, the staff the campers, the<br/>
openness, the inspiration that lasts all year. Thank you.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Like last year, I came home totally inspired. 1 feel like the days are<br/>
not long enough for all the things I want to learn/study now. 1 feel<br/>
like I can change the world. I know I can change the world. 120 campers<br/>
and advisors felt the same way that week, I think, and many of them have<br/>
carried that feeling home. It was worth every bit of money and time, I<br/>
love camp. I highly recommend it, especially to those who are wondering<br/>
if they&#39;re doing the right thing and to those who feel apathetic and<br/>
unenthusiastic about learning, life, whatever. There is a joy in life at<br/>
camp. A warning however: you can&#39;t get much out of camp if you don&#39;t put<br/>
much in. The more you participate in things, try talking to new people,<br/>
and explore, the better time you will have. And personally, I find that<br/>
by the end of camp, what energy I put into being there has come back,<br/>
multiplied, a hundredfold.&quot; <br/>
&quot;This camp totally changed my life. I feel confident and proud to walk<br/>
the path I chose.&quot; <br/>
