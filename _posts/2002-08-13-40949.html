&gt; Any ideas or stories are welcomed.  Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, I live in Iowa.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi, BJ,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m from Iowa originally.  Waverly, north of Cedar Falls.  I never knew the<br/>
underground railroad was active in the state (and I went to school<br/>
there...amazing what you don&#39;t learn in school...).<br/>
<br/>
In the NE corner of the state, check out the Norwegian historical museum in<br/>
Decorah -- it&#39;s quite good.  There&#39;s Czech influence in Spillville, which is<br/>
why the composer Dvorak spent a couple summers there (and his New World<br/>
Symphony and American String Quartet date from his Iowa days), and if you<br/>
know the good ol&#39; song &quot;Little Brown Church in the Vale&quot;, take a trip up to<br/>
Nashua and visit it!  Des Moines area has Living History Farms and the state<br/>
capitol is full of history.<br/>
<br/>
What part of history interests your boys?  Mine likes colonial history,<br/>
sparked by reading the poem Paul Revere&#39;s Ride and books like Ben and Me.<br/>
And living in Germnay, he&#39;s gotten into castles and palaces.  BTW, there are<br/>
some great SCA events being planned for the next year or so at castles<br/>
around the area.  Anybody coming over?<br/>

some other big city.<br/>
