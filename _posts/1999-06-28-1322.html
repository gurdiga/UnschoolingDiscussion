cirricular activities that the kids have access to.  These are things that<br/>
they may or may not be able to participate in outside of school.  If you<br/>
live in a smaller population base, like we do, than you have less access to<br/>
alternative activities outside of ps.  Also, if the child has a strong ego<br/>
and enjoys being in the spotlight, they may benefit greatly from the large<br/>
audience in ps.  These are the kind of kids who are really into student<br/>
government, cheerleading, dance committees, and other organizational and<br/>
highly public endeavors.  <br/>
<br/>
Let us not forget that there are also good teachers out there.  Teachers<br/>
who try hard, who care.  Unfortunately, due to the entire makeup and<br/>
atmosphere of the ps system it is often difficult for even these teachers<br/>
to make a lot of the positive changes in the classroom.  Their hands are<br/>
tied.  There are positive aspects to ps, but in my opinion, they are<br/>
drowned by the looming system and it&#39;s unhealthy aspects for a childs<br/>
physical, mental and emotional health and well being.<br/>

seen. And I would never put down a teacher. they work very hard, for little<br/>
pay and many are trying so hard.<br/>
<br/>
I just know that Isaac is better off.<br/>
<br/>
Although today, I want to wring his neck. he is annoying me to no end.<br/>
