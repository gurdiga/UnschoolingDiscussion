Thank you so much for this wonderul & empowering letter you wrote to<br/>
Robin.  I copied it so I can read it again & again, for myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am continuously surprised(learning to expect it) at people&#39;s<br/>
response(I mean everyone!) to when I tell them I am Homeschooling my<br/>
kids(I don&#39;t even bother trying to explain unschooling).  Immediately<br/>
they usually respond by commenting on how hard it much be to do that,<br/>
and try to say something positive like, &quot;you have more patience than I<br/>
do&quot; or something or other, then ask a question pertaining to curriculum<br/>
and ALWAYS, comment or ask a negative question about &quot;what about<br/>
socialization&quot;.  I keep wondering why everyone says almost exactly the<br/>
same thing, even people whom I would&#39;ve thought to be more openminded;<br/>
are they all programmed by the same people?  hahaha!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407891230">Kelly in WA, I feel for you.<br/>
<br/>
Some people feel they have no control over their own lives so they try<br/>
to maintain that control over others. Pretty much trying to make up for<br/>
their shortcomings. (that would be my ex) Some people are high<br/>
maintenance and insist on control and order in their own lives which<br/>
then spills over to their loved ones. They are well meaning but this<br/>
doesn&#39;t make them any easier to be around. (this would be my mom) So far<br/>
these are the only two types I&#39;ve had experience with and I surely hope<br/>
I don&#39;t run into any more!<br/>
<br/>
The ex was easy enough to handle (i.e. ex) but my mom was a different<br/>
story. We had an estrangement several years back for a period of about 2<br/>
years. Long story short, she realized what she was missing and our<br/>
relationship now is wonderful. I certainly don&#39;t recommend a split but I<br/>
wholeheartedly suggest you be as up front and honest as you can be. One<br/>
on one, no one else around, you and her. It&#39;s very important that she<br/>
understands that this is your life and your children and you don&#39;t need<br/>
her permission on any of it. It sounds like a given, but it&#39;s something<br/>
that really needs to be said and sometimes more than once. You sound as<br/>
if you feel her pushing is not good for your children. You have to tell<br/>
her that. If necessary, remind her when she does it with a simple word<br/>
or phrase so as not to make a scene. Believe me I realize any situations<br/>
like this are never easy to solve. It&#39;s a matter of priorities for you<br/>
and your children.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought my mom and I would come to terms with her control over<br/>
me. She was a real tough one. Maybe age mellowed her, maybe I mellowed<br/>
her, maybe I just grew up!! Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068358681">The other day when I found unschooling.com website, I printed off all<br/>
the articles/info. on unschooling I could find, read it, and then took<br/>
it over to my mother&#39;s house.  See, my parents(mother & stepfather), are<br/>
very close with my children, as well as a big influence, and have been<br/>
since they were born(ages 6 & 8).  I told my Mom I had some articles<br/>
about Unschooling I thought she might be interested in reading, and she<br/>
said &quot;I just don&#39;t see why anyone would even want to consider<br/>
unschooling&quot;.  I spoken to her about it before, and given her reading<br/>
materials on child led learning early on in my decision to do<br/>
homeschooling(a year and a half ago).  She had no comment then either,<br/>
come to think of it.  But, I think she read the articles and then gave<br/>
them back to me(again, no comment).  THis is disapproval for her, she is<br/>
only holding her tongue.<br/>
	I don&#39;t need her approval.  If I did, I never could&#39;ve made it this<br/>
far.  It&#39;s just that after joining this list, I am realizing some things<br/>
I don&#39;t really like.<br/>
	I consider my Mom to be a &quot;control freak&quot; by nature, and she especially<br/>
likes to meddle in my life and my kids&#39;.  I can&#39;t stand this about it,<br/>
but also I can&#39;t change it, unfortunately.  She is big on education. <br/>
She in financial aide director at a state university.  SHe is very<br/>
opinionated.  My stepdad is much, much better.  He is a retired<br/>
Professor of English.   Still, eduction is the primary focus in my<br/>
extended family.  My own father is a retired school teacher(music), and<br/>
he is the worst of all, I think.  <br/>
	But, right now my Mom is driving me crazy!  She is constantly<br/>
&quot;quizzing&quot; the kids, as you were talking about on here.  She is<br/>
constantly buying books, from readers, to workbooks, to chapter books<br/>
and such.  Everytime we visit, she makes little comments about whether<br/>
or not my son reads enough.<br/>
He reads as much as he wants to, no more, more less, and somedays this<br/>
is a lot, and some it is none at all.  I just say &quot;he reads all the<br/>
time, don&#39;t worry about it&quot; and she acts surprised.  Why?  Because when<br/>
she is around him, she is always trying to get him to read to her and do<br/>
school type stuff/learning.  I can&#39;t believe I am only just now<br/>
realizing all of this.  I knew she was REALLY gettting on my nerves, but<br/>
just couldn&#39;t put my finger on it to this extent.  O.K., well, it seems<br/>
to me the more she tries to manipulate him into reading, the less<br/>
interested he becomes, hmmmmmmmm....<br/>
	It really makes me mad that she is trying to control my children&#39;s<br/>
education this way.  I guess I need to set some boundaries with her. <br/>
THis won&#39;t be easy, I know.  I will have to think about it long and hard<br/>
first.<br/>
	The funny thing is, my son is an excellent reader.  He can read<br/>
anything he wants to, basically.  He just started reading one day when<br/>
he was 6, and right away was easily reading at 3rd or 4th grade level. <br/>
just like the way he learned to talk when he was a baby.  He started<br/>
talking very early(baby), and started off with 2 word phrased(&quot;big<br/>
tractor&quot; was his favorite)and practically speaking in sentences.  He<br/>
does not need to be pushed(not that any child does)!  So, why does she<br/>
keep doing this?  <br/>
	Any input/advice/suggestions from this group would be so helpful, and<br/>
very much appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
Heck, yeah! The poor guy thinks he&#39;s in school and he&#39;s shutting down! Tell<br/>
her to back off or you won&#39;t be able to visit anymore. (I sound strong, but<br/>
I&#39;m the weenie who had a problem with her friend. I do feel stronger now,<br/>
thanks to the posts I got from mine.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go back to, I think it was Denise, who said that she is afraid that we know<br/>
better than her now (only Denise said it better). Here is your mom, whose<br/>
business is centered around education, and here you are taking matters into<br/>
your own hands. She feels threatened by you, so she&#39;s doing everything she<br/>
can to keep it the situation &quot;familiar&quot; to her. I&#39;m seeing it more clearly<br/>
now, but I had a hard time at first. You sound like you are doing the same.<br/>

Kelly,<br/>
I guess you know your Mom and the relationship you want to have with her.  My <br/>
mother was also a control freak, and I am still trying to get that part of <br/>
her out of me.  However, I had to let her know, early on, that it is MY life, <br/>
MY family, and although I love her very much, I would always do it MY way, <br/>
not hers.  If the behavior towards my husband, or my children did not change, <br/>
then there would be no further interaction between our families.  Now this <br/>
was before homeschooling, before my children.  Probably began in high school. <br/>
 By the time we got to homeschooling, they just said oh, ok.<br/>
You have to live your life and care for your family.  Others are nice and <br/>
great and all, but if they make you and your children&#39;s lives miserable, then <br/>
they are just something that can be done without.  Like I said, that is me, <br/>
and you have to live your own life and do what works, but life is to short to <br/>
let ANYONE make it miserable.<br/>

Kelly,<br/>
     Your mother sounds exactly like mine!  I know how you are feeling right <br/>
now, I felt the same way when I first discovered how much I allowed my mother <br/>
to &quot;control&quot; my life a few years ago.  She is also a &quot;control freak&quot; and <br/>
loves to tell everyone what, where, when, and how to do something. <br/>
     You are right when you say that it won&#39;t be easy.  I have been trying to <br/>
put up boundaries for 3 years now.  My mother is just refusing to give up the <br/>
controls.  Every time I get two steps ahead, she pulls me one step back.  She <br/>
also lays guilt trips on me, as far as my leaving her control.  She <br/>
alternates between yelling at me, to crying and saying that my pulling away <br/>
hurts her feelings.  The tension between us is very tough to handle.  There <br/>
would have been many times that I would have given in to her tears (never her <br/>
anger, but her tears always get to me) and allowed her to control me once <br/>
again if she would just stop crying.<br/>
     If it wasn&#39;t for my husband, I would be back at step one.  My husband is <br/>
very laid back, and he just doesn&#39;t ever seem to let anyone get on his <br/>
nerves, so when he tells me that what my parents are doing is wrong, then I <br/>
know I can believe him.  He cannot believe, how hard they are clinging on for <br/>
control of us, when we are trying to make our own decisions.  They just won&#39;t <br/>
accept it!  Every confrontation brings either anger or tears from them, then <br/>
they pull away for a few weeks, then they slowly start right back to trying <br/>
to control us!<br/>
     I don&#39;t know your own parents, of course, so it may not be so hard for <br/>
you.  I hope it is not, as it can be emotionally draining.  I feel for you, <br/>
and I wish you the best of luck.  I am here if you want to talk, as I know <br/>
how much it has helped me to be able to talk about the problem with my <br/>
parents.  Good luck!<br/>

to my parents, and I&#39;m still waiting for that &quot;mellowing&quot;...I honestly don&#39;t <br/>

Oh man...... That is hard, see, the problem here is, you guys just waited to <br/>
long to show your stuff!!!!  I stuck it to my parents when I was a teenager <br/>
and got married a month after graduation instead of going to Emery University <br/>
to become an RN.  I just went my own way like it or not.  I did get my RN, on <br/>
my own, 10 years later, after my daughter died.  I went thru that one my own <br/>
way too.  So  they (my parents) knew I meant business when I say back off or <br/>
go away.  The last four years of my mothers life we were the closest we had <br/>
ever been in our lives, and it was brought about by the man I married that my <br/>
mom didn&#39;t approve of in the beginning.<br/>
So, hang in there and stick to your guns!!<br/>
