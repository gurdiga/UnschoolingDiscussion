If I begin to control what my children eat, and totally reverse my advice to <br/>
other families who are having regular food-control issues in the absence of <br/>
death-threatening allergies, that won&#39;t make allergic kids any more or less <br/>
safe.<br/>
<br/>
Do we all control because some families don&#39;t want to consider loosening up?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the way this culture has been (and largely still is).  ALL kids have <br/>
early bedtimes; then no kids feel unburdened.  ALL kids have to go to school, <br/>
then parents don&#39;t have to defend their decision to send kids to school.  ALL <br/>
kids have to stay in when it&#39;s raining, so those parents who let their kids <br/>
go out and splash in gutters and puddles are Bad Parents.  <br/>
<br/>
I think treating children as people is good.<br/>
<br/>
I have a close friend who&#39;s here at least weekly, sometimes daily for a <br/>
while, who housesits.  She can&#39;t eat pecans or walnuts.  When she will be <br/>
over we have none in food, and none out.  She asks at restaurants.  We remind <br/>
other people.  It&#39;s a matter of course and a matter of fact.  Another friend <br/>
can&#39;t have wheat, so we don&#39;t give her gifts of bread or cookies and we don&#39;t <br/>
offer her pizza.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry your child can&#39;t be in a park where a person has eaten a peanut <br/>
butter sandwich.  That&#39;s harsh.   There are whole countries with hardly a <br/>
peanut.  If this allergy isn&#39;t grown out of, maybe moving would make life way <br/>
easier.<br/>
