<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364141729">I was ill ny sophmore year of high school, walking pneumonia, asthma, severe allergies sinus infections. I was out of school for three months. They had six doctors notes and lost them all. They wanted to expell me from school and refused to let me make up the work. I flunked that year and had to repeat it. That looks wonderful on my transcript.<br/>
