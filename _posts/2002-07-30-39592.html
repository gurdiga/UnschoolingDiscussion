<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355857807">I found this on Babycenter.  While this article contains good information <br/>
which I hadn&#39;t heard before I wasn&#39;t sure why they didn&#39;t mention contacting <br/>
your local La Leche League group. ????  Oh well.<br/>

American moms go after world breastfeeding record<br/>
<br/>
On August 3, 2002, hundreds of mothers will gather at a park in Berkeley, <br/>
California, for what they hope will be a record-breaking display of <br/>
synchronized suckling.<br/>
<br/>
The women are hoping to break the Guinness World Record for simultaneous <br/>
breastfeeding. Australia captured the title last year by coordinating the <br/>
efforts of 536 lactating mothers and their babies.<br/>
<br/>
It was on a recent holiday to the Land Down Under that organizer Ellen Sirbu <br/>
learned of the Aussie breastfeeding challenge and decided to host an <br/>
American version of the event.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was so impressed by how matter-of-factly everyone in Australia <br/>
breastfeeds,&quot; says Sirbu, event coordinator and director of the Berkeley <br/>
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children <br/>
(WIC). &quot;I thought, this is so nice, why don&#39;t we do this here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The world record attempt, which will take place during World Breastfeeding <br/>
Week, is expected to draw more than a thousand nursing moms from as far away <br/>
as Pennsylvania. Sirbu hopes the event will increase awareness of <br/>
breastfeeding in the United States, and will encourage mothers, <br/>
policymakers, and medical professionals to promote and support the practice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My goal is to make breastfeeding a more public thing � to get the whole <br/>
community involved,&quot; she says. In fact, she encourages everyone, not just <br/>
moms, to come out to the event and show their support.<br/>
<br/>
What you can do<br/>
The world record attempt will be held Saturday, August 3, 2002, from 12:00 <br/>
p.m. to 4:00 p.m. at Martin Luther King Jr. Park in Berkeley, California.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a breastfeeding mom who would like to participate, send an e-mail <br/>
with your name, address, and phone number to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:esirbu@...">esirbu@...</a>. For <br/>
more information, visit the California WIC Web site.<br/>
<br/>
If you live outside the Bay Area and would like to get involved, contact <br/>
your local hospital or legislators to find out how to promote breastfeeding <br/>
in your area.<br/>
