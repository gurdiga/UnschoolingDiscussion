&gt; <br/>
&gt; the child?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to do it when they ASK. Do it when they WANT it. Sometimes <br/>
kids (not just kids---me, too!) are too wrapped up in something to eat. Take <br/>
it to them if you know they&#39;re hungry. <br/>
<br/>
If you know the child loves training dogs, get her a good dog and a few <br/>
books. E-mail her websites. Buy her gift certificates to dog e-stores. Take <br/>
her to an obedience trial. If YOU think she should love to train a dog <br/>
because someday she might own a dog. but she has no interest---then the dog, <br/>
the books, the websites, the trial, and the gift certificates are a waste of <br/>
time and money. They aren&#39;t feeding her passion.<br/>
<br/>
ASKING and WANTING are two different things. I *wanted* a horse. I knew how <br/>
expensive it was. I never asked. Daddy KNEW I wanted a horse. He bought me <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
He *could&#39;ve* bought me a tennis racket because he knew that one day I might <br/>
want to play tennis. I hate tennis. He knew that.<br/>
<br/>
A child&#39;s learning is like that. In unschooling, we give them things to fire <br/>
up a present passion. It&#39;s not our goal to *make* a passion, but to fuel one <br/>
already there. We *may* present a new one---and that&#39;s cool---when a child <br/>
finds a new passion. I did that with my oldest: I showed him a magic trick <br/>
one night and it evolved into a huge passion---and he was GOOD! Really good! <br/>
Maybe Vegas-good. But he lost the passion. No big deal---it&#39;s a part of him <br/>
and always will be. And he can maybe use it later on in his life.<br/>
<br/>
My job is to feed passions and to present new possibilities for passions. NOT <br/>
to force ones that aren&#39;t there.<br/>
