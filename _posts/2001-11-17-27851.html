<div id="ygrps-yiv-629521529">You have my sympathy, Susan.  I spent years scared to death about peanut<br/>
butter when I was a mere tyke back in the dark ages &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We were at Tilton Park in the Bay Area.  We use to go to ride on the<br/>
carousel and my little sister was absolutely addicted to peanut butter.  We<br/>
each had our little bag with our sandwiches in them.  Mine was tuna, her&#39;s<br/>
was peanut butter.  At anyrate, we also had dehydrated fruit in the bags.<br/>
Anther child was playing by us and my mother asked if the child could have<br/>
some of the pears because she had brought a whole extra bag of them.  The<br/>
woman asked me what I was eating.  I told her tuna.  My mother had one of<br/>
those quizical looks on her face.  The woman said o.k. not knowing that the<br/>
my little sister&#39;s sandwich was peanut butter (she was on the carousel with<br/>
my dad) and I guess some of the peanut butter got on the pears when my<br/>
mother made up the bags.<br/>
<br/>
The little girl went into anaphalactic shock!<br/>
<br/>
It is a truely scary world out there for folks with allergies!<br/>
