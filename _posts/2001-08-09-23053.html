<br/>
Nitpicking!  Seriously, the only way to truly get rid of lice is to pick,<br/>
pick,pick, until all the nits are gone.<br/>
<br/>
A friend had good results with olive oil, but she was also diligent about<br/>
the nitpicking (as in hours a day).  She massaged lots of olive oil into<br/>
her daughters hair and scalp and left it for quite a while (maybe 24<br/>
hours?).  She said her daughter stopped itching after that treatment too.<br/>
<br/>
The shampoos sold to kill lice kill only the live lice, not the nits, but<br/>
a good lice/nit comb is said to be worth the money.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031077600">I have been battleing with these nasty little critters for months now!  They go and then they are back.  Through my journey I have learned a lot!  Do not use the shampoos as they are dangerous as well as ineffective.  It seems that the strands of lice going around today have become tollerant to our treatments.  You can visit www.licemeister.com for all sorts of wonderfull information.  What ever treatment you use, never use the prescriptions that may still be available.  Several children have become seriously ill and a few have died.  Get to picking and get a good come.  The site that I posted above has the best come there is and all of the proceeds go back into research for a somday end to lice all together.<br/>
Hopw this was helpful, <br/>
