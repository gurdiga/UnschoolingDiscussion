<div><font face="Arial" size="2">In the state of Virginia, it is illegal to leave a 
child under the age of 9 alone in a car while you run in for a gallon of 
milk.&nbsp; I can&#39;t help but wonder if there are similar laws for staying home 
alone, or if there should be.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My 8 yr old has never been left alone, thank 
goodness.&nbsp; The closest we came was being 5 minutes late picking him up from 
music class, but I knew he was still inside the store and had been told not to 
leave the store.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We live in an area I feel is very safe, very rural, 
yet we still have the inevitable bathroom problems.&nbsp; Some places I&#39;m fine 
with him going alone to the men&#39;s room, others no way.&nbsp; Some are okay if 
I&#39;m waiting outside but not if I&#39;m in the other restroom and can&#39;t watch.&nbsp; 
AND, without &quot;drawing him a picture&quot; I&#39;ve told him mean/bad guys sometimes look 
for kids in the bathroom, that he should never touch anyone or let anyone touch 
him and that he should shout NO! if anyone scares him.&nbsp; BUT, he still hates 
going to the ladies&#39; room when I am not comfortable....</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">But I gotta be MOM and take care of him the best I 
can.</font></div>
