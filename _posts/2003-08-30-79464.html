<div id="ygrps-yiv-371746801">Any education historians know the evolution of the classroom?  David A? Seems to me it might be based on Taylorism, i.e. most people taught at least cost.  Not really about the person, but efficency.<br/>

  &gt; Just wondered what you all think. When (if ever) is there a benefit <br/>
  &gt; to be gained from classroom instruction on a specific topic?<br/>
<br/>
  When they&#39;re going to give you a certificate you really need.<br/>
  (first aid, CPR, ?)<br/>
<br/>
  Group music (not quite &quot;classroom instruction,&quot; but choir/orchestra)<br/>
<br/>
  Karate (not quite classroom but groups help)<br/>
<br/>
  Marty liked the &quot;classes&quot; (presentations) at the junior police academy.<br/>
<br/>
  Visiting artist doing a presentation (calligraphy, glass bead making, <br/>
  seminar/workshop style &quot;class&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
  Lots of those would work better with one-on-one, but sometimes there&#39;s no <br/>
  opportunity other than special presentations.<br/>
<br/>
  The talks at the unschooling conference were closer to &quot;classrooom <br/>
  instruction&quot; than not, though I tried to make mine more like inspirational comedy.  It <br/>
  would be more &#39;unschoolingish&#39;&#39; for people to hang around my family&#39;s regular <br/>
  haunts and get to know us, but not everybody can.<br/>
