<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172917552">Jill,                                                                           <br/>
    You can also make a very soft papier mache&#39;  by using the following:        <br/>
            Materials:  paper towels, napkins, tissues, or toilet paper, <br/>
white glue              Procedure:  1. wad tissues and dip them into the <br/>
white glue.                                 2.  make into desired shapes.       <br/>
                            This soft mixture will allow you to do fine work, <br/>
such a facial features, on big papier mache&#39; pieces.  It is great for holiday <br/>
projects.  I know you could buy a commercial paste, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d <br/>
need to.  You can mix up flour, water, and glue to whatever thickness you <br/>
need or want.  I have made Santa doll heads this way, and attached them to <br/>
various empty bottles, then clothed them.  Library books offer books with <br/>
dozens of recipes for crafting that you might be interested in,too.  Hope you <br/>
find what you are looking for.                                                  <br/>
