<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you do a lot of sewing and have a serviceable machine, why not try a<br/>
&gt; serger (or as we say in Australia, an overlocker ) I have one that I<br/>
&gt; just adore. They are really zippy. Of course you have to follow the<br/>
&gt; diagrams exactly for the different threadings, but it is worth it for<br/>
&gt; me. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would love to have one of those. Saw something cute yesterday made with <br/>
a serger or overlock at the toy store. &quot;Book Socks&quot; make out of cool <br/>
stretchy lycra non-run fabric in outer space planet fabric or clouds, <br/>
something visual. I turned it inside out to figure out how it was made. <br/>
It a book cover but made from a long rectangle with, oh how do I <br/>
describe this? You know how it looks when you take a square and fold up <br/>
four triangles to form another square shape? Well in this the triangles <br/>
were what is formed the backside of the rectangle and then the made a <br/>
slit in the middle to slide the book into. So, it looked like zip up one <br/>
side with the overlock then cross over the other then cut up the middle. <br/>
quick fast easy and cheap if one already had an overlock. You could make <br/>
some in time for the new Harry Potter book and sell them! ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441344737">I had a sewing machine given to me and I lost the instruction <br/>
booklet.  I tried and tried to figure out how to thread that thing <br/>
but couldn&#39;t get it.  I tried to find the instruction book online but <br/>
couldn&#39;t.  I found other instruction books for other machines and <br/>
tried to figure it out from those but couldn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, because I was so determined to figure out how to sew, I went <br/>
out and bought a brand new sewing machine.  I couldn&#39;t figure out how <br/>
to thread that one either, but dh helped me get it.  It came with the <br/>
bobbin threaded and I am not looking forward to the time when that <br/>
runs out! lol  I don&#39;t care if the bobbin thread is bright blue, I <br/>
will put up with having the underside of the fabric showing blue <br/>
thread instead of figuring out that bobbin.  It scares me to death <br/>
for some reason.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter needs jeans, and she is finding she needs plus sizes <br/>
right now.  Plus girls sizes aren&#39;t in Wal-mart, and I don&#39;t have any <br/>
put back from yard saling.  I&#39;m not about to pay 30 or more bucks for <br/>
a brand new pair of jeans from a department store.  So I took her to <br/>
the thrift shop and let her pick out bigger sized jeans and I&#39;m <br/>
hemming them for her.  I had her stand on top of the table and I cut <br/>
off about where I thought they should be cut off.  No one told me to <br/>
measure an inseam--dh mentioned that to me afterwards. ;)  I hemmed <br/>
them, and one leg is a little longer than the other.  And because the <br/>
thread is bright red on dark denim (to match the thread on the rest <br/>
of the jeans), the places where I didn&#39;t go straight and have double <br/>
layers of thread show a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
So I went to Wal-mart and bought trim for the bottom of them.  I <br/>
figure if I let the trim hang a little lower on the side that is <br/>
hemmed higher, it will make them look about even.  I also let her <br/>
pick out some cool appliques to put on the jeans.  Hopefully I can <br/>
figure out that zig-zaggy sewing that the instruction book says you <br/>
should use for appliques.  <br/>
<br/>
I just pray that the blue bobbin thread holds out until I finish <br/>
these jeans.  Changing that bobbin thread just might stress me out <br/>
too much! lol  <br/>
<br/>
Geez, sewing is just about as scary to me as algebra.  ;)<br/>

I have used ten+ different sewing machines, and if you can send me a pic<br/>
off list, I can probably draw you out a diagram on how to thread it and<br/>
change bobbin thread. As for the appliques...much, much easier to sew on<br/>
by hand, and dd could help you that way. It&#39;s also fun for them to puffy<br/>
paint on them, and sew beads, sequins, bits of lace, etc. on them to make<br/>
different designs. And if the cuffs that you cut off are big enough, I&#39;ve<br/>
used them to make cool little denim purses. You can use brik-a-brak or<br/>
some other trim for strap, and use Velcro for closure. My 5dd likes to<br/>
decorate them too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877439423">&lt;&lt;I also let her <br/>
pick out some cool appliques to put on the jeans.  Hopefully I can <br/>
figure out that zig-zaggy sewing that the instruction book says you <br/>
should use for appliques. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Two tip for this:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If the appliqués do not have adhesive, get some iron on fusible webbing.<br/>
It is double sided with adhesive. These will hold the things in place<br/>
while you sew. My mother used to sew on appliqués without worrying about<br/>
satin stitch, and then go over the stitching with fabric glitter glue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jeans are easier to embellish if you lay them flat. Unpick the seam that<br/>
is a plain seam, rather than the overlapped and topstitched side. Do<br/>
your embellishments and then sew the seam back up. If you then press<br/>
with a hot dry iron and a wet cotton cloth you will get a good result.<br/>
Of course you will have to do your hemming again, but that is about 10<br/>
thousand times easier than struggling to sew on the leg while it is<br/>
still a tube shape.<br/>
<br/>
 BTW, with trousers, I always pin to fit, then do the cutting on a flat<br/>
surface after ironing up the hem fold. Truly an iron is just as<br/>
essential a sewing tool as your machine.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can so relate!  Last year (2001) for Halloween, my son wanted to be a <br/>
&gt; moose (as in If You Give a Moose a Muffin).  I made his costume.  I got so <br/>
&gt; stressed by that damned bobbin, it was so tangled and bouncing <br/>
&gt; uncontrollably and making a horrible metal on metal scraping noise inside <br/>
&gt; the bobin case, that I ended up sewing the whole thing by hand - just to <br/>
&gt; avoid having to deal with the bobbin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then, after Christmas this year the kids both wanted capes to go with their <br/>
&gt; reenacting of various ballets.  I ended up hand sewing those too.  I <br/>
&gt; remembered the bobbin is all tangled and stuck in the machine and just <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t get up the nerve to check it out.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe there is hope for folks like us, I&#39;m not sure.<br/>

If you take it to a sewing machine supply and repair shop, the tech will show <br/>
you how to thread it, and also sell you extra bobbins.  Maybe you could fill <br/>
up three or four while you&#39;re there just to make sure you know how to do it <br/>
right.  Then if  you forget, you&#39;ll still have bobbins.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re afraid of the machine.  If I lived closer I&#39;d come over and <br/>
help you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you can squeeze a set of pliers, then snaps are easy to do!  There&#39;s a <br/>
gizmo that&#39;s like a pliers that squeezes snaps onto the fabric - no sewing <br/>
required, just squeeze.  ...of course there&#39;s always the old sew-on kind too.<br/>
<br/>
The next time the stitching goes crazy and is in an &#39;obvious&#39; color, just <br/>
go to your marker set, grab the best color and Marker Over The Thread!  If <br/>
the thread&#39;s cotton/blend, it&#39;ll take on the color of the marker and not be <br/>
so &#39;obvious&#39;.  ...and staples can be used instead of sewing if you&#39;re in a <br/>
rush.  I once had a stapled hem that lasted for a good 2 years before I got <br/>
around to sewing it up.  (staple so the &#39;legs&#39; of the staples are showing, <br/>
not the big part of the staple.)<br/>
<br/>
...and that&#39;s the tricks for now,<br/>

&lt;&lt; Of course you will have to do your hemming again, but that is about 10<br/>
<br/>
thousand times easier than struggling to sew on the leg while it is<br/>
<br/>
still a tube shape. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing it by hand that&#39;s not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing machine applique, it truly helps.<br/>
<br/>
I did some inlay kind of stuff on a pair of Holly&#39;s.   Appliqued satin <br/>
inside, outlined it with machine zigzag (solid, like the outline of appliqued <br/>
patches) and then cut the denim out so the heavy purple satin showed.   One <br/>
was right over the heavy side seam.  She was sad to outgrow those.  It was <br/>
fun.<br/>

I DID IT!!! Her jeans are finished.  One leg still looks a little <br/>
longer than the other, but dh says he doesn&#39;t think anyone will <br/>
notice and dd says she doesn&#39;t care.  I hope they&#39;re not just being <br/>
nice. ;)  <br/>
<br/>
But still, it&#39;s my first time.  Now the next time I do it I&#39;ll be <br/>
that much better at it.  <br/>
<br/>
This was important to me, because I want to set an example of <br/>
tackling hard things and figuring frustrating things out.  I know <br/>
that my attitude towards sewing comes from my mom&#39;s attitude toward <br/>
sewing.  I can&#39;t tell you how many times as a child I heard, &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>
very smart at sewing&quot; with joke after joke about how bad at it she <br/>
was. She bragged about how bad she was.  So I always looked at it <br/>
like this big, complicated monster that only experts could do well.  <br/>
Like there was a mysterious, unattainable ability that surrounded the <br/>
sewers that I couldn&#39;t even touch and shouldn&#39;t even try.  <br/>
<br/>
I want so much to pass on to my daughter the idea that we can try <br/>
hard things with confidence and that it&#39;s ok to have fun messing <br/>
around with difficult stuff.  That difficult means fun and <br/>
challenging, not depressing and daunting.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to take her to the thrift store again for another pair <br/>
of jeans. <br/>

<br/>
Tape measure.<br/>
<br/>
Measure the inseam to the top of the trim, and then measure the outside seam <br/>
to the top of the trim.  If they&#39;re the same (within 1/2&quot;) then your family&#39;s <br/>
not fibbing. <br/>
<br/>
And with the next pair, you can do that to figure out where to cut or hem or <br/>
put trim!<br/>
<br/>
I use colored chalk when I sew.  I mark all kinds of stuff, and then after <br/>
I&#39;m done, I throw it in the washing machine to take all the chalk off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961566536">and don&#39;t forget glue - Elmer&#39;s blue school glue is best, but<br/>
glue sticks are great too.  Glue that hem up, and the trim on,<br/>
then stitch away!<br/>
