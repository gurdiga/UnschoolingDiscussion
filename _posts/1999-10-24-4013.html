Question #2: What do you fill in on an attendance record when it asks<br/>
for curriculum used? We currently use AO &quot;kinda-sorta&quot; (the kids scan<br/>
the material, answer the questions in short order, then get on with<br/>
THEIR interests for the day). Next year I would much rather spend that<br/>
money on software, books, etc. Just want to be sure I have the &quot;proper&quot;<br/>
words written for documentation..<br/>

I live in Ohio and here when I notify the schools of my intent to<br/>
homeschool each year I supply them with something like this:<br/>
<br/>
We subscribe to a form of child led education which lends to continual<br/>
change in curriculum throughout the year.  We are planning to continue<br/>
utilizing Design-A-Study Guides, the Prairie Primer, our public libraries,<br/>
and internet/computer educational materials.  We will further enhance our<br/>
curriculum with several of the following activities:  COSI, The Columbus<br/>
Zoo, The Wilds, Ohio Historical Society Events and Activities, Dawes<br/>
Arboretum, Girl Scouts, 4-H, piano lessons, Thistledown Youong Actor&#39;s<br/>
Theater, swimming, and skating.  Some of our schedule field trips include:<br/>
XXXXXXX (long list) and others.  We will be taking advantage of Fire<br/>
Prevention Week activities, reading clubs and various other such emphasis<br/>
weeks and activities.<br/>
<br/>
This works here and allows us the freedom to change a lot!  It is just a<br/>
list to show we have thought through what we want to do we are not legally<br/>
required to stick with all we write.  Even though I list Design-A-Study I<br/>
probably only use it a handful of times during the year.  You could<br/>
completely leave out any names of curricula and show a list of the<br/>
educational materials you plan to use other than that of an established<br/>
curricula.  I usually do this as a separate attachment page as their form<br/>
only allows me a small space to respond to what our curriculum will be.  I<br/>
hope this helps!<br/>
