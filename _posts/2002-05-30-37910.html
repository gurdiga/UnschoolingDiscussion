&lt;&lt; I know we&#39;re all unschoolers. What I mean is, does anyone have <br/>
 children (or have you?) that have grown up in an unschooling <br/>
 situation?  Or is unschooling too new for that? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understood what you meant!<br/>
Helen (the owner of this list and HEM mag) was unschooled for a large part of <br/>
her education. <br/>
Here&#39;s a link to the website of a couple grown unschoolers if you want to <br/>
read their stories:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/nikleba/">http://www.geocities.com/nikleba/</a>   this one is for Laurie, who was raised <br/>
her entire life without a single lesson of any kind (in the formal sense) and <br/>
went on to college and higher level math. She just graduated not long ago <br/>
with excellent grades.<br/>

Peter has run unschooler camps and outdoor adventures.<br/>
<br/>
And I posted this before, and it&#39;s been passed around quite a bit, but I&#39;ll <br/>
post it again for anyone interested. It&#39;s the experiment with third world <br/>
countries and computers left in the open for people in the slum areas to use. <br/>
It just proves that people teach themselves!! A great article for anyone that <br/>
hasn&#39;t yet read it.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, the other day driving in the car with my 18 year old, we were <br/>
talking about something to do with clothes, and his friends, and how <br/>
he doesn&#39;t feel it necessary to be like everybody else, and he said, <br/>
&quot;I am not into social conformity.&quot;  I just wanted to hug him.  I <br/>
said, &quot;Son, out of all the things I&#39;ve tried to teach you, even if <br/>
that&#39;s the only one you remember and have taken to heart, I&#39;m <br/>
pleased.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then followed a discussion of why, even though we don&#39;t HAVE to <br/>
conform, sometimes it&#39;s necessary, like he doesn&#39;t see the need to <br/>
dress in nice pants and a nice shirt for a job interview.  He said, <br/>
that&#39;s not me, I&#39;m not into that, I don&#39;t see why I have to wear it.  <br/>
I said, well, you don&#39;t HAVE to, but I showed him on one of his job <br/>
applications where on the back there was a space for the interviewer <br/>
to write comments, and one of areas of comment was &quot;appearance and <br/>
neatness.&quot;  I said to him, even the stock boys down at the <br/>
supermarket where he had applied had to wear black pants and a white <br/>
button up shirt, and that&#39;s the place he is dying to work.  I said, <br/>
you can make the choice to wear what you want, but the employer also <br/>
has the choice not to hire you.  Unfortunately, appearance is still <br/>
strongly linked to a perception of competence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201210382">I&#39;ve wondered for years if my kids would ever grasp what a different kind of life they&#39;ve lived and if they&#39;d appreciate it. I mean - it is always possible that they&#39;d grow up and think, &quot;My parents made me DIFFERENT than everybody else and I wish ....&quot; maybe wish that we&#39;d made them do stuff more like other kids....because the truth is the unschooled kids ARE turning out to be different - it is more and more apparent to me as my kids move into adulthood that they, and their friends, are free-thinking, self-aware, can-do energetic people!! They may flounder a bit as they enter adulthood, trying to decide what to do with themselves, but I think that is because they are THINKING about what to do - they aren&#39;t on automatic pilot like so many schooled kids - they aren&#39;t on a track - not even the &quot;graduate-go-to-college-get-a-good-job&quot; track. Kids raised mindfully, raised to examine their own learning and to feel responsible for their own decisions and for the life they CHOOSE to lead - will continue to do that as young adults. So- be forwarned - it is wonderful to behold, but can be disconcerting to parents to watch their grown kids be so brave and creative and full of energy and confidence!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve wondered for years if my kids would ever grasp what a different kind <br/>
of life they&#39;ve lived and if they&#39;d appreciate it. I mean - it is always <br/>

other kids....because the truth is the unschooled kids ARE turning out to be <br/>
different  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty (who is 14, not grown) said an interesting thing to me on the way home <br/>
from the conference.   He said that kids who were always unschooled should go <br/>
to conferences before they have kids, so they&#39;ll know that the deal is about <br/>
unschooling, and what their parents were trying to do.   <br/>
<br/>
I could have told him &quot;there are books and magazines,&quot; but I just let him do <br/>
the talking, and I thought about it.<br/>
<br/>
Of my three kids, Kirby probably heard the most as a young child about why he <br/>
was getting to stay home (he thought it was a great idea).  Marty and Holly <br/>
just came along in it, and missed the early agonizing (of which there was not <br/>
much anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Holly, though, is very analytical about it all, and LOVES to see how other <br/>
families homeschool, and when she&#39;s in a formal situation with a teacher or <br/>
theater director or anything where an older person is managing a group situation <br/>
or even a one-on-one music lesson, she notices all kinds of subtleties.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is involved directly with other people&#39;s learning, as a one-time <br/>
Pokemon Gym Leader, and now Yu-Gi-Oh whatever, and he teaches games where he works, <br/>
helps organize things Magic tournaments, and he teaches karate.  So he <br/>
analysis comes from those situations, and things his friends say, know, or don&#39;t know <br/>
(whether or not they went to school).<br/>
<br/>
So I think it&#39;s just Marty whose thinking is not so much along the lines of <br/>
social interactions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said for years I thought Marty was going to become a great husband and <br/>
father someday.  I think he&#39;ll be a great parent.  (Holly too, and Kirby maybe <br/>
depending more on who he marries. &lt;g&gt;)  But one thing Marty thinks he needs is <br/>
to understand more about the hows and whys of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Fascinating.<br/>

A couple of years ago I read something you wrote and you said you wanted<br/>
your kids to be kind, thoughtful, joyful, curious and compassionate. Those<br/>
words really stuck with me.<br/>
When you write about your kids I really get a sense of these qualities in<br/>
them. That must make you feel so good!<br/>
