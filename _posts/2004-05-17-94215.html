<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752515900">I just am in a predicament. My DD12 just has virtually no interests.<br/>
EVERYTHING is boring. She only wants to watch talk shows and sitcoms on TV.<br/>
ALL day. This has been going on for about a year. <br/>
She use LOVE to write and wanted to get published. She has written some<br/>
poetry and short stories but I can&#39;t find a magazine to publish unsolicited<br/>
things especially from kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am having so much trouble understanding the &quot;everything is boring&quot; idea. I<br/>
have always been the type of person that can find something  interesting in<br/>
just about every subject. She, like her father, is the complete opposite.  I<br/>
have some  things available to her but resources are limited so I do not<br/>
have an abundance of projects. I usually have to wait until they show<br/>
interest and try and do things that are free or inexpensive. <br/>
<br/>
She has told me that she wants to start collage at 15 or16. She wants to be<br/>
a freelance writer and get a degree in journalism. I explained that if she<br/>
has goals than there are things she need to do to reach those goals and that<br/>
sometimes it is hard work. For example, the idea of taking remedial algebra<br/>
in collage (something I had to do) is not something she wants to do.. I told<br/>
her than she would have to learn it before hand and score high enough on her<br/>
entrance exam so she didn&#39;t have to (like her daddy did) I scored VERY low<br/>
and took 2 years of remedial stuff.  She doesn&#39;t know why she has to take<br/>
those things  and personally I do not understand either but it is the<br/>
requirements of a 4 year collage. <br/>
<br/>
The problem is she has these goals that she wants but does not want to put<br/>
for the effort to achieve them. How do i encourage her to meet these goals,<br/>
without pushing?  Is it possible, someone who does not possess the.....ah...<br/>
desire for knowledge become passionate about things? To be fair both her and<br/>
her father are like that about everything. They show little or no excitement<br/>
about things (very difficult to buy gifts for ;) ). <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know maybe I am just way off base. I want to do the right thing by<br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>

Ps she has never been to school. We were for a few years VERY  VERY<br/>
relaxed homeschoolers. We did worksheets because she wanted to and did not worry about where she was. I figured she would learn things at her own pace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909437253">My daughter had a poem accepted to be published in Cicada Magazine. We <br/>
don&#39;t get it - I&#39;m not sure if it ever appeared - it has been just <br/>
about one year and I think they said that they had a 1 year lead time.<br/>
<br/>
But, my daughter,  the poet, says, get a copy of &quot;The Poet&#39;s Market&quot; to <br/>
find out where to send them. Also, she should create her own &#39;zine. <br/>
Also - there are wonderful poetry email lists where people share their <br/>
poems and talk about them with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Also - take her to poetry slams and open mike nights at places where <br/>
people read their poetry. This is popular these days, you should be <br/>
able to find some.<br/>
<br/>
There is usually poetry-writing workshops at the HSC conference in <br/>
Sacramento in August - and other very very inspiring teen stuff - a <br/>
whole teen conference. Susan Woodridge has been very popular - you <br/>
might look into her and see if she has books or tapes or workshops in <br/>
your area.<br/>
<br/>
However - I have to say - your daughter is only 12 and this lack of <br/>
interest in things seems like it might be a sign of depression. Maybe <br/>
your husband is depressed too - it tends to run in families, I think. <br/>
Have you considered that possibility?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960193964">Thanks! I will check into all those things. She is more interested <br/>
in her stories and possible book reveiws than her poetry. <br/>
<br/>
As far as depression, if the lack of interest came on all of a <br/>
sudden, I would be concerned.  However, she was born this way, so was <br/>
hubby.  Just lately she seems like it is intensified. Also she shows <br/>
no other signs of depression. I am trying to see if it is related to <br/>
her cycle. I get VERY moody during mine. <br/>
It just seems a little much to watch THAT much tv with nothing else <br/>
in her life. I try and encourage her or ask if she wants to do <br/>
something I just get a shrug. She comes right out and says nothing <br/>
really interests her THAT much. <br/>
<br/>
 I know it is how they are but it is hard for me to relate since I am <br/>
the complete opposite.  I guess i need the more definative <br/>
answers...YES... NO.... Go to hell ;) ANYTHING but i guess, I <br/>
suppose, ok all said in monotone. Is this just my hang up?<br/>

The &quot;have to&quot; seems wrong.  You don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; wait and you don&#39;t have to <br/>
suggest things that cost money.<br/>

exciting things.  Ask her to join you.  If she doesn&#39;t, then she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
But sitting around waiting on her to get excited is just going to make both<br/>
of you resentful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092037983">I took algebra in middle school, liked it, and did very well in it.  I still<br/>
had to take it over in college because I&#39;d forgotten most of it by then.  I<br/>
did actually need some algebra for use in science classes, but if she is<br/>
planning for a degree in Arts (writing, journalism), rather than Sciences,<br/>
she will probably not *need* much algebra.<br/>
