<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; And, in most cases<br/>
&gt; &quot;real&quot; pit bulls are pussy cats around people &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t that kind of &quot;most&quot; statement just as wrong and dangerous as others?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are dogs somewhat as individual as people?  Isn&#39;t their environment,<br/>
&gt; treatment, and the expectations people have of them a greater factor in how<br/>
&gt; they will act than their genetics in many cases?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are three broad categories in pit bulls that come to my mind:<br/>
<br/>
1. Are Lynda&#39;s pussycats -- show dogs, pets, your general average dog who<br/>
was raised well and lives with a family that took some time to train him.<br/>
<br/>
2. Are actual pit dogs, bred and used for fighting other dogs in a pit. No<br/>
pit dog worth spitting at bites a human, and most of them won&#39;t bother with<br/>
cats or dogs who are not a fair fight to them. This is not to say I approve<br/>
in any way of dog fighting, just that there are real dog fighters and people<br/>
who are just mucking around saying they&#39;re dog fighters who aren&#39;t, and both<br/>
have pit bulls. Real fighting pit bulls are specifically bred to be<br/>
*extremely* even-tempered with people, as in the heat of a dog fight the<br/>
handlers have to be able to reach into the pit and grab the dogs without<br/>
getting their hands bitten off.<br/>
<br/>
3. Are the media version of pit bulls. Some of the dogs which are blamed for<br/>
attacking people are pit bulls. Some are not, but media and animal control<br/>
officers and police officers say they are because they don&#39;t know any better<br/>
about identifying dogs.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any good stats on which types of pit bulls are in the majority<br/>
state-wide, nation-wide, world-wide.<br/>
<br/>
In an inner city, probably number 3, with the caveat that some of the people<br/>
who think they have pit bulls don&#39;t (don&#39;t get me started on the number of<br/>
people who think they have a 48% &quot;wolf hybrid&quot; and don&#39;t &lt;g&gt;). Some do.<br/>
<br/>
In a dog training class, probably number 1. At a dog show, number 1. At a<br/>
dog fight in West Virginia, number 2 (no pun intended &lt;g&gt;). Etc.<br/>
