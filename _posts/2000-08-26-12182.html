&lt;&lt; Do you make the choice for them?  What are the consequences of their <br/>
refusal <br/>
 to choose? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great!  I ask the question because some people think that their kids, <br/>
toddlers even, will automatically make a choice. Even when mom has to make <br/>
that choice, the children are learning, that they do have control over their <br/>
situation, but that they can also choose to give that control away.  A few <br/>
children are in fact happy to give that control away, but the vast majority <br/>
want to keep it, and will learn in pretty short order how to do that by <br/>
choosing from the mom&#39;s alternatives.<br/>
