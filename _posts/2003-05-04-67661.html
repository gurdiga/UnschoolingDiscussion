My daughter has joined as a free player.  It allows you to own virtual<br/>
horses, but unless you pay to be a premium player, you have to &quot;pay&quot; to<br/>
board your horses.  She has lost some of her horses because the owner of the<br/>
stable didn&#39;t feed them.<br/>

So, does she like it or find it frustrating.  I have a couple of horse<br/>
lovers here who might be interested, but I&#39;d hesitate to tell the about<br/>
it if it isn&#39;t somewhat easy to play.  They are 6 and 8.  What do you<br/>
think?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She likes it.  There is lots of reading involved, but she has figured out<br/>
most of it on her own.  She has a friend who is on it too and has given her<br/>
some tips.<br/>
<br/>
Players are given deposits in their bank account each week.  She has bought<br/>
LOTS of horses.  In fact, she spent all of her money on horses at first and<br/>
couldn&#39;t feed or board them until her next payday.  Each horse comes with a<br/>
photograph and a bio.  You can breed your horses too.<br/>
<br/>
It think it&#39;s a bit lame myself, but it is meeting her need to &quot;own&quot; a<br/>
horse, at least for now.  I&#39;m thinking of paying for her to be a premium<br/>
player in a couple of months (can&#39;t do it right now, due to some other<br/>
expenses).  It&#39;s about $24 a year.  I figure it would be easy to spend that<br/>
much on computer games or other things.  If she is premium, rather than<br/>
free, she can own a stable and board other people&#39;s horses.<br/>
<br/>
One bad thing is that she started receiving spam after she joined horseland.<br/>

I can&#39;t stand it!! ROTFL! I have to know - did you mean it or was it<br/>
just a sneaky pun?<br/>

have lame horses there!<br/>

I mention it to her. <br/>
