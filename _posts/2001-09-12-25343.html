<div id="ygrps-yiv-471774454">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
After what&#39;s been going on today in the US I deleted all my e-mails including <br/>
all my digests as they just didn&#39;t seem important today.  Heard from my best <br/>
friend in England at lunch time (after coming back from today&#39;s HS meeting) <br/>
that her husband&#39;s best friend was in New York today (he&#39;s American) and was <br/>
near the WTC when it collapsed.  He escaped with lots of dusk and some <br/>
scratches, but it made me think that my life was relatively simple.<br/>
<br/>
My son is really interested in scouts but is not old enough to attend so I <br/>
thought about starting my own sort of cub scout troup for 5 and 6 year olds <br/>
in the area.  Does anyone have experience of doing this and if so could you <br/>
give me feedback about how you went about this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104607509">We had Junior Webelos which is younger than Cub Scouts.  What we really did<br/>
was what I did when I was a Brownie &lt;g&gt;  But what the hey, they didn&#39;t know<br/>
and they had lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly it was crafts that they wanted to do.  Each meeting we would spend<br/>
the last 5 or 10 minutes coming up with what they wanted to do next meeting.<br/>
Sometimes it was a field trip and sometimes it was other fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My head is all scrambled from watching all that horrors on television.  Let<br/>
me know in a couple of days if you want more info.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve just been told about a new scouting progaram called Spiral <br/>
Scouts for boys and girls.  You can check them out at <br/>
www.spiralscouts.org.  They have a program for little folks, and they <br/>
are more earth-friendly (pagan, actually) than traditional scouts.<br/>

  Try looking at the Tiger Cub program (especially the old one with the 17<br/>
big ideas and and iron on Tiger Paws - if you can find them).  It won&#39;t be<br/>
ok for them to join a pack or be under the scouts insurance but it could<br/>
give 3-5 younger boys a great time - it would at least give you some ideas<br/>
for some things to do with a group of young boys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108559014">Oh yeah, your 6 year old maybe ok to join.  Our pack takes in 6 year olds<br/>
that are in First Grade -- so if he is chronologically old enough to be in<br/>
1st grade then he can be a Tiger Cub with a regular Cub Scout Pack.<br/>
