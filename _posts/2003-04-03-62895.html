<div id="ygrps-yiv-942476061">If anyone here has any info or has had carpal tunnel syndrome, could you please write me privately? More specifically with symptoms, those that go farther than just hand and wrist pain. Joe and I are trying to make a diagnosis on him as he&#39;s been going on 4 weeks incapacitated with no end in sight. Dr&#39;s seem totally stupid on this one. We&#39;re both beside ourselves as to what to do. He&#39;s trying acupuncture now. Chiropractic didn&#39;t work, pain killers don&#39;t work and I couldn&#39;t find the homeopathic remedy I thought might help.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance.<br/>
