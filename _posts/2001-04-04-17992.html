&gt;Subject: Redwoods<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You guys are making me homesick! I used to live (before kids) in Guerneville<br/>
&gt;and would walk or ride my bike under the redwoods in Armstrong Woods.. I<br/>
&gt;lived (and worked) in Healdsburg for a short while too...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still miss it, Nina. When I was really little we lived in Deer <br/>
Park, on the road to Armstrong Redwoods State Park, and then we moved <br/>
across the road to a bigger house, and my parents bought the place <br/>
next door for my Grandma. She lived there for 30+ years... worked as <br/>
a cook at that big red & white restaurant on the corner in town... <br/>
Can&#39;t remember the name of that place. I remember sitting on the <br/>
beach down at the river and watching the pageant where they&#39;d throw <br/>
burning coals over a cliff into the river... I think they quit doing <br/>
that tho...<br/>
<br/>
In Healdsburg my other Grandma spent her last 40 years on the north <br/>
side of town, I think they built a Safeway store on top of her old <br/>
orchard... She&#39;s buried up on Fitch Mountain. I always loved the <br/>
drive between my two Grandma&#39;s houses, over the old Dry Creek Road <br/>
between Healdsburg and Guerneville... It was so pretty, winding <br/>
through vineyards and orchards and redwoods and along the river!<br/>
<br/>
Good places. Good times. Sure is different now.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen that!!!  I remember it so clearly even though I was pretty young.  <br/>
They did quit doing it a long time ago.  I also remember driving up to the <br/>
spot where they lit the fire and pushed it off.  There were so many chipmunks!<br/>
