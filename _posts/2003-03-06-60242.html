<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 6 Mar 2003, at 12:12pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440882441">I just had to share this.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter had picked out a recipe in one of our &quot;concoctions&quot; books and wanted to make &quot;goop&quot;.  So we did.  Well, about the time we got done, we had a whole neighborhood of kids over and they each wanted to do it too.  (I could invest in elmer&#39;s glue now!!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...we have some new neighbors that just moved in this week and they were over.<br/>
<br/>
The 12 year old boy looked at me and said &quot;You know, you are really nice, and you hardly even know us!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And his 11 year old sister told Sierra that she has a cool mom.  (Sierra told me later).<br/>
<br/>
They made my day &lt;big grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

Keith and I bought a gallon bottle once when a stationery store near us was <br/>
going out of business.  It lasted us years.  We had lots of fun and did a <br/>
couple of big glue projects we would have hesitated to do if we&#39;d thought of <br/>
it in terms of four big bottles of glue instead of some small part of our <br/>
already-expensed gallon!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The 12 year old boy looked at me and said &quot;You know, you are really nice, <br/>
and you hardly even know us!&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s sweet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476538533">So, you nice mom!  :-)  Care to share the recipe for goop?  I wanna be a <br/>
nice mom, too!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lovely story, though, Kristen!  There&#39;s nothing like hearing that <br/>
from young folks!  Thanks for sharing the sweet story (and, maybe, the <br/>
recipe?).<br/>

is nice to be the &quot;cool&quot; mom.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know the recipe for goop, but I know the recipe for oobleck... and <br/>
it can totally MAKE a party if you&#39;ve the free spirit to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Either get some plaster/mudding trays (big 2 foot x 1 foot x 6 inch tall <br/>
plastic trays) or a big old tarp and put them in the back yard.  Make sure <br/>
your hose is connected to the water spigot and that the water spigot <br/>
works.  Go out to your local food wholesaler and buy a couple of the 20 or <br/>
40 pound bags of corn starch, a good deal of food coloring and some spray <br/>
bottles.  Put the corn starch in the tubs or in piles on the tarp.  Put the <br/>
food coloring in the spray bottles.  Put really old clothing on the kids <br/>
and let &#39;em rip.<br/>
<br/>
Within minutes, you&#39;ll have brightly colored oobleck all over.  Add a <br/>
little water to the tubs to speed the process.  It&#39;s cool how if you strike <br/>
it quickly, it&#39;s like hitting wood, but if you ease into it, it&#39;s like <br/>
cream.  Very neat.<br/>
<br/>
The food coloring *will* stain your kids, so be prepared for blue/green/red <br/>
skinned kids!  Takes a few days to wear off completely, longer for blondes.<br/>

<br/>
Get plaster of paris, food coloring, and some of those little paper cups <br/>
(dixie cups?).  Mix the plaster of paris according to directions, but add <br/>
some food coloring in place of some of the water.  Pour into the little <br/>
paper cups and let dry a few days longer than you think they need (so the <br/>
middles can solidify.)<br/>
<br/>
Peel off the paper and you have a big chunk of colored sidewalk chalk.  Now <br/>
try to make &#39;swirled&#39; chalk, and polka-dotted chalk, and...<br/>
