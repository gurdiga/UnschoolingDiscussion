Each one  had photos<br/>
of each kid  and artwork of various types on the theme  &quot;born to be drug<br/>
free&quot;.  With little pledges that all these second and  third graders werren&#39;t<br/>

And wouldn&#39;t it be *FUN* if all the teachers&#39; pockets and desks and glove  <br/>
compartments could be magically and suddenly turned out to create a big poster  <br/>

Sandra, who&#39;s not above some nighttime pain killers or a shot of Bailey&#39;s  or <br/>
aspirin/Aleve, and who occasionally chugs a bit of NyQuil and does not  <br/>
disdain antibiotics, figuring I&#39;d rather live now well than live longer sicker,  <br/>
and who will get a BIG headache if morning tea skips a  day<br/>
