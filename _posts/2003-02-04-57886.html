<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051126363">About breastfeeding in public and possibly offending others, I simply feel that if someone doesn&#39;t like it they have a neck and can use it to turn their head in another direction. It is and has always been my babies&#39; rights to recieve the most nourishing food that I can offer. One of the best things about living in Costa Rica is that breastfeeding is very accepted as normal and even beautiful. It is not unusual for me to be nursing my 14 month old in the sling and have both men and women notice and say &quot;how cute, she&#39;s eating.&quot; It has even happened that they call their friend or spouse over and say, &quot;come look at the cute baby eating.&quot; Gotta enjoy those cultural differences! -Christine<br/>
