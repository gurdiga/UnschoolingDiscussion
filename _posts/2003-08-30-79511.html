<div id="ygrps-yiv-681176339">I posted some of this elsewhere last week, but now Rain wants to share<br/>
her writing with this group, so the background seemed appropriate..<br/>
<br/>
 Between ages 5 and her 10th birthday last January, I&#39;d estimate Rain<br/>
created maybe 20 pieces of writing, total. I&#39;m not including things like<br/>
signing in at dance class or adding an item to the shopping list, but<br/>
anything with more than 2 or 3 words. Most were notes and letters, a few<br/>
were poems, a few were comic strips, one or two were political<br/>
statements... but none were longer than a few sentences, except maybe the<br/>
character bio she had to write last summer. They were spread pretty<br/>
evenly over those 5 years, too. Her mechanical skills improved some over<br/>
that time, slowly (although the &quot;gap&quot; between her skills and the<br/>
expected-for-grade-level skills continued to grow), but there was very<br/>
little substance to what she wrote. The average schooled kid probably<br/>
writes much more in a month than she wrote in 5 years.<br/>
 <br/>
Last Spring she started to write a little more . She discovered the Bio<br/>
feature on The Sims and created bios for a couple dozen Sims, all<br/>
humorous in a 10 year old way, none more than 3 or 4 sentences long. She<br/>
started passing notes during some of the shows she was doing, sometimes<br/>
in character. She also made some friends who were into email, and got her<br/>
own email address and started sending and receiving emails. In the<br/>
beginning she asked me questions, mostly about spelling, but she figured<br/>
out how to set up her account so spellcheck would run automatically<br/>
whenever she sent something, and 99% of the time her spelling is close<br/>
enough for spellcheck to fix. One of her best friends spent a month in<br/>
Europe this summer, so they sent quite a few emails. <br/>
 <br/>
So, I wasn&#39;t seeing much of what she was writing, buhe quantity seemed to<br/>
be picking up a bit. The things I did see were very preteen-note style -<br/>
&quot;Arrrghhhhh! I am soooooo frustrated!!!!!&quot;  - and so on. Then a week or<br/>
so ago, while we were walking our dogs, she was telling me about an idea<br/>
she had for a series of books. Ideas for books are nothing new for Rain;<br/>
she has lots of ideas and stories in her head, she just never wants to<br/>
write them down, or dictate them to me. I listened and said something<br/>
about how she had such interesting ideas and good descriptive skills, and<br/>
I was really looking forward to reading her stories some day. I&#39;ve<br/>
occasionally said similar things to her before, for years, so it was just<br/>
sort of conversation... but then that evening she sat down and started<br/>
writing, and filled almost a page in a spiral notebook. I aksed to see it<br/>
but she wasn&#39;t ready yet, but after writing a little more the next day<br/>
she let me read it. <br/>
<br/>
I was, and am, impressed. I had expected writing to be a process that<br/>
started with simple sentences and pieces and then slowly became more<br/>
complex and detailed. I didn&#39;t expect her to go from never writing a<br/>
piece of fiction to creating the piece below. I guess this was another of<br/>
my blind spots, since reading happened much the same way - a few years of<br/>
playing with words and letters and books, then a 6 month period of<br/>
slightly more intense reading experiences, then she could read almost<br/>
anything fluently and competently.<br/>
<br/>
So, Rain wanted me to share the beginning of the first chapter of her<br/>
first story with an unschooling list, so people could see that &quot;when kids<br/>
decide they want to write they can&quot;. She&#39;s written a little more but<br/>
isn&#39;t sure if she&#39;s keeping it, so she didn&#39;t want anyone to read it<br/>
(including me). I did correct the spelling and punctuation, at her<br/>
request, although there weren&#39;t a lot of errors (which also surprised<br/>
me).<br/>
<br/>
Her next plan is for an unschooling kids zine... stay tuned!<br/>

<br/>
On a cold November morning, the wind was blowing, snow was falling, and a<br/>
kindly old man was standing on the sidewalk, selling newspapers from a<br/>
stand he had built himself. He was in his late fifties, with gray hair<br/>
and a beard, with glasses and true blue eyes. <br/>
 <br/>
On this day, not many people were outside, so Hank just sat on his chair<br/>
and waited for the usuals. At 8:17, Mr. Briefcase came (Hank did not know<br/>
any of his usuals names, so he gave them new ones). Time magazine and<br/>
the newspaper, his usual. Then, at 9:03, Mrs. Mommy and Candy came. Mrs.<br/>
Mommy bought Redbook and some candy for her daughter, but this time, when<br/>
the mother left, the daughter stayed.  <br/>
 <br/>
Hank only started to worry when the child sat down on the curb and<br/>
started to read Mad magazine. He stared for a minute or two, then Hank<br/>
loudly cleared his throat. She gave him a blank look, then went back to<br/>
reading. Hank had no idea what to do, since he and his wife had never had<br/>
a child, so with nothing to do Hank fell on is safety net: He asked about<br/>
the weather. So, some snow we got here, eh? She answered with a look of<br/>
annoyance and confusion. <br/>

[Shan replies:] Great story!  I cant wait to read the next parts as they<br/>
come.  What a great imagination she has.  Shell have a book published in no<br/>
time with the way shes writing.  :o)<br/>

let me read more...<br/>
<br/>
We have discussed possible plot twists :)<br/>
<br/>
And she may decide not to write any more, I suppose..<br/>
