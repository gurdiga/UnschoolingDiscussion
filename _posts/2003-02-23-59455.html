on <br/>
the right track now. Do you have any idea how much math, language, science, <br/>
history and enjoyment he&#39;s going to get out of studying just animals??? I <br/>
say he&#39;s way ahead already and doing what he wants to do. Just trust him to <br/>
know what he likes and needs and let him go. Check out the archives from <br/>
this list and sit back and relax.<br/>

Thank-you so much Mary. We really didn&#39;t realize how much he was really <br/>
getting out of this. I&#39;m so happy he&#39;s home with us now. Your right, he <br/>
already knows what he is doing and he&#39;s doing what he loves. I&#39;ll check out <br/>

I don&#39;t even know where it was now but I know you&#39;re here for sure and I<br/>

of her fantastic bod, and if I had a bod like that (and I don&#39;t) I would<br/>
wear invisible strips of fabric to the grocery store every day. <br/>

So, you can all thank your lucky stars.  Or something. <br/>

LOL!! You were not a snot. If you were, you know I would have said so. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
It&#39;s okay if one doesn&#39;t like Cher, I can handle that. Just don&#39;t say a bad<br/>

Oh crap! You just had to ask and make me feel bad. Just couldn&#39;t swing it<br/>
this year. I would never go without the hubby and kids. We even cancelled a<br/>
trip to Cocoa Beach which is just 3 hours away and a condo to stay at for<br/>
free. Boarding the dogs costs a fortune I wasn&#39;t prepared for, I had/have<br/>
some dental crap that must be taken care of which costs even more than the<br/>
dogs and I&#39;m having a party for my birthday which is setting me back some<br/>
too. Plus the T shirt business is needing someone here and Joe is starting<br/>
tomorrow a new part of his business from home which I will be taking care of<br/>
and we are still in the middle of interior house fixing. Now aren&#39;t you glad<br/>
you asked??!!<br/>

Glad you liked the T shirt. And what a great story, even if it wasn&#39;t one we<br/>
made. &lt;BG&gt;  Me and the kids wear them all the time and I only had one<br/>
comment from someone who knew that unschooling was homeschooling and said<br/>
her and her ex husband take turns homeschooling them in different states.<br/>
Other than that I never get anyone who asks me anything. Maybe I look too<br/>
unapproachable. (sigh)<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Rebecca --<br/>
<br/>
In California, kids must go to school for 1st grade if they will 6 by <br/>
December 2nd of this calendar year.  Kindergarden is not mandatory in <br/>
CA, although some schools are trying to make kids go to K before <br/>
attending 1st.<br/>
<br/>
I think the R-4 form, also called a  Private School Affadavit, only <br/>
exists in that exact form, in California.  The time to file each year is <br/>
after the school year starts, between Oct 1st and 15th.<br/>
<br/>
Laws in each state in the U.S. are different.<br/>
<br/>
Detailed California legal information about HS can be found at:<br/>
