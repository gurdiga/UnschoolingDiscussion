            A review by Merle Rubin<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Asked what he thought of Western Civilization, India&#39;s great leader<br/>
Mohandas Gandhi reportedly replied that he thought it would be a good<br/>
idea. In Being America, Jedediah Purdy seems to be making a similar<br/>
point: Democracy, freedom, tolerance are indeed good ideas, but it<br/>
should concern us that sometimes they seem more honored in the breach<br/>
than in the observance.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A West Virginian who was schooled at home before going on to Harvard<br/>
University and Yale Law School, Purdy made his debut as a social<br/>
commentator four years ago with For Common Things, a thoughtful critique<br/>
of the chronic irony and disaffection that seem to pervade so much of<br/>
American life, undermining our ability to engage in meaningful political<br/>
discourse.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Being America reflects similar concerns. It invites us to examine our<br/>
assumptions about terms like &quot;capitalism,&quot; &quot;globalism,&quot; &quot;liberalism,&quot;<br/>
&quot;nationalism,&quot; and &quot;fundamentalism.&quot; It offers a penetrating look at<br/>
Adam Smith, James Madison, Edmund Burke, and Alexis de Tocqueville. And<br/>
it describes Purdy&#39;s travels all over the globe trying to get a fix on<br/>
attitudes from Egypt to India to Indonesia. But with so much territory<br/>
to cover, Purdy&#39;s argument becomes less focused<br/>
<br/>
-- and less original -- than in his earlier book.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Being America is, among other things, an attempt to understand how<br/>
America is perceived in the rest of the world, particularly in Asia and<br/>
Africa. How is it that we are simultaneously loved and hated, seen as a<br/>
model to be emulated ready and a dominating power to be attacked? Much<br/>
of what Purdy says is not new, but bears reiteration: People who feel<br/>
oppressed by their own corrupt governments may turn their anger against<br/>
America, especially if we have supported those regimes. Resentment may<br/>
also be fueled by policies that cause economic hardship, as when the<br/>
International Monetary Fund pressures debt-ridden countries to slash<br/>
social services while protecting the investments of foreign speculators.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yet even those who resent America, Purdy believes, still have<br/>
<br/>
a desire for the democratic values America symbolizes. In essence, he<br/>
argues that we should do a better job of acting in accordance with our<br/>
own ideals. But he tends to overlook the fact that people have different<br/>
opinions as to which actions best serve those ideals. As a democracy,<br/>
ought we to support the rights, say, of a fundamentalist majority to<br/>
impose religious law on all its citizens, when this conflicts with other<br/>
American principles, such as minority rights and the separation of<br/>
church and state?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then, there&#39;s the problem that some people (Americans included) admire<br/>
the wrong American values. Sadly, Purdy finds, many an ambitious young<br/>
Egyptian, Chinese, or Indonesian wants to emulate American-style<br/>
material success without embracing racial and religious tolerance,<br/>
separation of church and state, or other principles of liberal<br/>
democracy.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While many of Purdy&#39;s general conclusions seem reasonable, when he comes<br/>
down to specifics, his judgments are more questionable. Looking around<br/>
for an example of &quot;illiberal&quot; actions by the current administration, he<br/>
makes no mention of its regressive economic policies, pointing instead<br/>
to Condoleezza Rice&#39;s appeal to the networks in the wake of 9/11 to<br/>
refrain from broadcasting material that might endanger national<br/>
security.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Curiously, while Purdy&#39;s previous book took issue with the assumption<br/>
that politics should stand aside and let the marketplace work its magic,<br/>
in this book he seems more impressed by the power of commerce to instill<br/>
tolerance, openness, and other humane values. In his penultimate<br/>
chapter, Purdy muses: &quot;In a 100 years, if economic progress continues<br/>
and population growth stabilizes&quot; (he doesn&#39;t cite any evidence for<br/>
these assumptions) &quot;it is imaginable that there will be...no more<br/>
countries where people are willing to work on nearly any terms the<br/>
owners and bosses offer. There would still be great inequality, but the<br/>
balance of power would have shifted in favor of the workers.&quot; Comparing<br/>
the squalid condition of the 19th-century London poor with the<br/>
prosperous London of today, he implies that if it happened in London, it<br/>
can happen in Calcutta.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But he doesn&#39;t trouble to note how this change was accomplished. To<br/>
imply that economic, social, and political progress is an automatic<br/>
byproduct of an &quot;evolving&quot; marketplace is to slight the tireless efforts<br/>
of politicians, reformers, preachers, journalists, teachers, labor<br/>
unions, sanitary commissions, social workers, enlightened employers,<br/>
philanthropic institutions, workman&#39;s education programs, labor and<br/>
healthcare legislation.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A laudable attempt to provide Americans with a sense of direction in a<br/>
bewildering era, Being America is nonetheless a book that&#39;s all over the<br/>
place in more ways than one.<br/>
