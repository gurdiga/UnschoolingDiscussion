<div id="ygrps-yiv-848857499">Well, Carly has been on and off about maybe going to high school.  <br/>
She would be a ninth grader next year, and she&#39;s thinking she wants <br/>
to try it, just to see.  She doesn&#39;t want to never go and not know <br/>
what it&#39;s really like.  She went to k and 1st, but high school is a <br/>
different thing and she has many people in her life telling her she <br/>
would get so much out of it.<br/>
The scool has a great drama dept. (we&#39;ve seen some of the shows and <br/>
they are good) and that is something she would like to get involved <br/>
in.<br/>
This winter was particularly long and boring for her.  The large <br/>
hsing community here is fundi xtians.  She has a few friends who are <br/>
relaxed, but no real unschoolers to hang with.  She&#39;s feeling a need <br/>
for more of a social life.  With Sam gone (who is her younger <br/>
brother who died last year), she is here with 2 littler ones and <br/>
it&#39;s just not as interesting and stimulating around here for her.  <br/>
She is great with them, but she was use to having Sam here to bounce <br/>
ideas off of, to argue with, to make life a LOT more fun and <br/>
interesting.  She seems bored and lonely at times.<br/>
I wish I had done better for her, but here we are, and she wants to <br/>
go to school.  I want to support her.  I want her to go and decide <br/>
for herself.  I hope she comes home after experiencing it and finds <br/>
other ways to meet her needs (we&#39;ve discussed many, but she really <br/>
wants to check out school).<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m looking at what she will need to not feel like she is <br/>
totally lacking in knowledge of the schooling kind.  I tried to <br/>
google for info on the high school she is going too, but didn&#39;t find <br/>
specifics.  I&#39;m thinking of an assessment type test for 9th graders <br/>
that will show what she might need to work on.  She hasn&#39;t done much <br/>
school type math (though I think she will pick it up easier than she <br/>
thinks she will).  Does anyone know of a good route to take for this?<br/>
I want her to feel confident, even when we both know the information <br/>
needed, is information ONLY needed for high school, not life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling sad.    I feel like I&#39;m going to lose a part of who we <br/>
are.  I feel so lucky to have had all this time with her, and feel <br/>
like maybe I have been selfish in some way.  I feel like, even <br/>
though she is only 13, the process of letting go has started.  She <br/>
is becoming more independant, she is wanting to spread her wings and <br/>
I can only trust her and love her and always be there for her to be <br/>
her &quot;home&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always thought unschooling was easy.  My work in coming to <br/>
unschooling was a long, difficult process, but the actual <br/>
unschooling, the hanging out with my kids, the trusting them and <br/>
seeing how really amazing they are and letting them BE who they are <br/>
was easy to do.  But now I&#39;m feeling like this was definitely the <br/>
harder path.  How easy it would be to say &quot;No. I am the mother, and <br/>
you will not go to school.&quot;  or to just send them to school and deal <br/>
with it like everyone else does.  Not too much thinking involved <br/>
there.  I don&#39;t want Carly to resent MY choices, so I have to let <br/>
her make, and help her with, her choices.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this will be a good thing.  I can see the first time an adult <br/>
treats her with disrespect (or someone near her), and her not taking <br/>
it, or feeling so angry she never wants to return.  She has always <br/>
thought of people, who treat kids as &quot;less than&quot;, as idiots, so it <br/>
will be interesting to see how she reacts to high school dynamics.  <br/>
It will be a learning process for us.<br/>
<br/>
But, I do want her going with some confidence.  Any suggestions or <br/>
insight?  <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hi, Joanna --<br/>
<br/>
I have a homeschooling friend whose 13 year old never-been-to-school daughter is going to try out 9th grade this fall.  Because they&#39;ve done eclectic &quot;lessons&quot; at home I don&#39;t think the issue of preparedness is as big in their minds, but I&#39;m hearing them go through most of the same other issues you are.  If you don&#39;t find the answers you are looking for here, I can e-introduce you to my friend for mutual comiseration.<br/>
<br/>
My wild guess is that my friend&#39;s daughter will find high school to be a tiresome grind.  (But that was my guess when I thought she would be going to the big neighborhood school.  Now it looks like she will go to a charter school with only 100 kids, so maybe she will have a more personal and worthwhile experience.  I don&#39;t know.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess the best person for you to talk to is someone whose kid followed this path last year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Betsy</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s easier to do something you WANT to do than something you&#39;re dragged <br/>
toward against your will.<br/>
<br/>
So you like unschooling and that makes it seem easy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
School won&#39;t be for Carly the way it is for kids who were dragged there <br/>
against their will.<br/>
<br/>
Being the mother of &quot;a school kid&quot; will be harder for you than unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
Holly periodically discusses school.  If she never goes, she will suffer <br/>
pangs of regret, I think.  I stall.<br/>

<br/>
Take her to see &quot;Mean Girls,&quot; and really discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend Holly, Marty and Keith went to the Almogordo, New Mexico public <br/>
pool on Saturday afternoon.  There were a dozen to twenty other kids.    At <br/>
some point the lifeguards cleared the pool for &quot;adult swim,&quot; fifteen minutes, <br/>
the kids had to stay outside the pool.   Keith was the only adult there.  They <br/>
let Marty and Holly stay in because they were with their dad.<br/>
<br/>
When they all got back to the grandparents&#39; house Holly said &quot;What was THAT <br/>
about?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said lots of adults don&#39;t treat kids like they have the same rights as <br/>
adults, and Keith explained that some people don&#39;t like kids, and they want to <br/>
swim laps the same time every day without kids playing in the lanes.<br/>
<br/>
Our explanations were true, but Holly was unimpressed that people would feel <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she would last a whole schoolyear, but I could be wrong.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s about &quot;adult swim&quot;.  I think it&#39;s a way for the <br/>
lifeguards to see that no one has drowned unnoticed, and it gives the kids a <br/>
chance to change their state and maybe see that they&#39;re were tired and needed a <br/>
break.  I get the sense, from the pools I&#39;ve been to, that this is a safety <br/>
issue, brought about by insurance companies or safety studies, etc., and that <br/>
there is a recommended or maybe even required amount of time per hour/session that <br/>
the pool should be cleared.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d google it to find out for sure, but it makes more sense to me that they <br/>
disguise the break as &quot;adult swim&quot; because then they don&#39;t have to explain a <br/>
&quot;safety break&quot; to kids ad nauseum.  It sounds distasteful to us, but it <br/>
definitely works with the general public.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539309643">My oldest DD will be 14 at the end of this month & plans on going to <br/>
high-school in the fall. She wanted to go to grade 8 last year but <br/>
when she found out she would probably miss the home-birth of her <br/>
littlest brother (all 9lbs, 2oz of him!)& due the beginning of Sept. <br/>
she decided she didn&#39;t want to go. She has never been to school.<br/>
<br/>
She has outside activities with other kids her age & does volunteer <br/>
work as well. She babysits for other families and goes to work with <br/>
her dad & helps out filing & putting the paper copies of proposals <br/>
together. There are other home-schooled kids near enough to us so she <br/>
can spend time with them too. There are other kids in our family to <br/>
hang out with too. <br/>
<br/>
Even though she is around other hsed kids she says she feels &quot;weird&quot; <br/>
because of some of our choices. Having a bigger family, fostering, <br/>
bfing, bfing extended, home-birth, APing, etc. Even though they don&#39;t <br/>
watch much t.v. it as well as other friends they have through other <br/>
activities they are involved in are &quot;mainstream&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
We looked into a couple of schools & she has chosen one. She is <br/>
friends with other kids who will be starting grade 9 there too. I <br/>
know the kids & they are pretty good kids from families that care <br/>
about their kids. Also since it is a small town school there will be <br/>
kids coming from other small schools as well as a few rural schools. <br/>
So all the grade nines will be new & be meeting kids they&#39;ve never <br/>
met before. We are very rural!<br/>
<br/>
I have encouraged her to prepare herself so she is doing more reading <br/>
& writing. But is really concentrating on her Math as well. She knows <br/>
she can come home if school doesn&#39;t turn out to be what she expects <br/>
or wants. <br/>
<br/>
There are a few other home-schooled kids near us who also chose <br/>
to &quot;try&quot; high-school. Most of them jumped right into it & after a <br/>
short adjustment period they really enjoyed school and are still in <br/>
or graduated. One is into college now!! Another couple of kids that <br/>
tried decided they didn&#39;t like all of it so they spoke with the <br/>
school & chose to only take the courses they wanted & also told the <br/>
school they were going to choose themselves whether or not to write <br/>
the tests or do the assignments as they were looking to learn, not to <br/>
get grades or credits. The school was fine with this too. Luckily <br/>
these kids were going to the same school my DD has chosen!! So no <br/>
matter her choice, the school has already had a variety of <br/>
experiences with home-schooled families.<br/>
<br/>
I needed to let my daughter make her choices, with my guidance, but <br/>
they are her own choices now. I have to trust in myself that through <br/>
loving her & supporting her & sharing my values over the past 13+ <br/>
years that I have given her the strong roots she needs. As I have <br/>
seen how wonderfully she has already sprouted I see that she now <br/>
feels she is ready to spread her wings. I think she is too, though it <br/>
is bitter-sweet. I too will grow with her. Even though there are <br/>
other kids at home, I will still miss her. Raising children also <br/>
involves our lives changing as our own children&#39;s needs change too. <br/>
I have realized that I need to start letting go of her even more so <br/>
that others can enjoy this wonderful person too. SIGH!! I am going to <br/>
go give her a hug right now!!<br/>

<br/>
In my opinion, the worst aspect of school is the compulsary nature of <br/>
it.  So if that part is removed, then what are the other problems?  One <br/>
of the challenges I think would be to help a kid navigate the waters of <br/>
school without buying into all of the BS of it.  That is to help her get <br/>
what she wants and to leave the rest, so to speak.  I think the trap <br/>
that we (the parents) can fall into is to say that if one chooses to do <br/>
something, one has to &quot;suck up&quot; the bad stuff along with the good.  And <br/>
this may be true to some extent but if the parent can be an advocate for <br/>
the child, then maybe some of that bad stuff (whatever it may be) can be <br/>
alleviated. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds simple but I think in the day to day it would be more <br/>
difficult to do.  I&#39;m having trouble thinking of examples...    And I&#39;m <br/>
also aware that I&#39;m not so good at doing what I&#39;m suggesting :-)  But <br/>
I&#39;m hoping that by sharing the theory, I can be more aware of it myself.<br/>

<br/>
You mentioned that the hs has a good drama dept.  One idea that came to my<br/>
mind is to find out if the school supports having you homeschool through<br/>
them.  This way if your daughter tries it out full-time and doesn&#39;t like<br/>
most of it but does like the drama, for example - she could still<br/>
participate in the things that she does want to do.  Not all schools are as<br/>
supportive of this as our local school is, but it&#39;s worth looking into as<br/>
an option.<br/>

We are not &quot;allowed&quot; to home-school foster children. However with the <br/>

to participate with their system.  It&#39;s all or nothing.<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion though.<br/>
Thanks to everyone for their thoughts and ideas.<br/>
We&#39;ve been trying to really play with numbers a lot.  I&#39;ll ask her <br/>
questions like what&#39;s 6x5x9?, and she tries to figure it out. ( I <br/>
help her by showing her all the little tricks and short cuts) We&#39;ve <br/>
talked about fractions, and she has a pretty good grasp on that <br/>
concept. I had to remember how to add and multiply them and was <br/>
having lots of &quot;OH! I get it now! moments&quot;  We have some workbooks <br/>
she&#39;s been working in.  She really isn&#39;t enjoying it, but is wanting <br/>
to do it anyway.  She gets frustrated, but I remind her that the <br/>
more she plays with numbers, the easier it gets.   I&#39;ve been working <br/>
once a week at a golf course and I don&#39;t have a register.  It&#39;s a <br/>
grill/snack shop.  No tax, but there are some things that are $1.25 <br/>
instead of an even $1.00.  So I have to do a lot of figuring in my <br/>
head.  Not difficult stuff, but I have to think fast.  I gave her <br/>
orders to figure out yesterday.  4 golfer come up and want 2 <br/>
hamburgers $5 each, 2 hotdogs $4.25 each, 2 Cokes $2 each and 2 <br/>
beers $3 each,  How much do I charge?  They give me $30, what&#39;s <br/>
their change?  She actually seemed to enjoy that.  Probably because <br/>
she saw a real purpose for it.  I think it&#39;s good for both of us to <br/>
be stretching our brains.  She has always resisted playing with <br/>
numbers with me.  It&#39;s not something that comes easy for her.  <br/>
1st grade drill sheets did her in.  <br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s how we are progressing.  I figure I will <br/>
initiate &quot;math play&quot; on a daily basis and get her workbooks to go <br/>
through, and we have some software she can use too.  I suggested to <br/>
her, she should work daily on it, if she wanted to feel good about <br/>
her skills by the end of summer.<br/>
My SIL told me that all 9th graders have to take a course called <br/>
Freshman Seminar, that basically teaches them skills they will need <br/>
for high school.  How to write a term paper, study skills, and other <br/>
vital stuff.   I guess 9 years of schooling isn&#39;t enough to prepare <br/>
them for high school!  It will probably be a benefit for Carly, so <br/>
I&#39;m glad to here of it&#39;s existence.<br/>
I&#39;ll let you know how we are progressing.  She has been telling <br/>
everyone she is going to high school, but then last night when we <br/>
were talking about how today would be her last day of &quot;All Sports&quot; <br/>
our homeschool gym class which she has done for 6 years, she was <br/>
saying, &quot;Well I probably wouldn&#39;t do it next year anyway.  I&#39;m <br/>
getting too old for it.  But, if I don&#39;t go to school, maybe I&#39;ll be <br/>
his assistant.&quot;  That &quot;if&quot; gave me a little hope.<br/>
