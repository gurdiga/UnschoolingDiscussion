<br/>
Friends of mine put in a pond lately, with a waterfall.  It involves two <br/>
pumps (can run on one), will have fish, and some plants, and is hooked into <br/>
the water line so that the water level stays up.  <br/>

If people just have a pond here (Albuquerque) it evaporates into a mudhole.  <br/>
You have to have a water source for it.  And pumping it only makes that <br/>
worse--it evaporates into the air more easily.<br/>
<br/>
There are times in the heat of the summer that you can&#39;t efficiently water <br/>
the lawn with spray--much of what goes up doesn&#39;t come down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011301863">If you aren&#39;t going to really &quot;use&quot; the bridge, as in people weight, you can<br/>
use plaster to make your bridge.  Also, if your cement is for the &quot;floor&quot;<br/>
and &quot;walls&quot; of your pond, you either need a special cement or you need to<br/>
add a water sealer to it.<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets have made the plaster bridges using some real thin rebar and<br/>
balsa wood for the frame.  Then they picked it up and moved it to the space<br/>
they wanted it in.  they also took some cedar and built a Japanese garden<br/>
bridge for the butterfly garden.  Lots of bigger building supply places will<br/>
have plans in envelopes that kinda look like sewing pattern stuff.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Turtle Pond<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi Fellow Excavators<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Roy and I have the hole partially dug, now.  As there<br/>
&gt; is no flat ground here making one side deep and the<br/>
&gt; other shallow is easy enough.  We want one side to be<br/>
&gt; so that the toads and frogs and turtles can get out<br/>
&gt; easily.  I often have to dump the toads and frogs out<br/>
&gt; of the dog&#39;s water in the morning before the drown.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tadpoles eat algae.  Also water hyacinths help to keep<br/>
&gt; it down. And baby fish hide in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Other Sharon, how deep does the water need to be<br/>
&gt; for water lilies? Our deep side is going to be about 3<br/>
&gt; feet. It is mostly in shade...can the lilies flourish<br/>
&gt; in shade?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our little pond is only about 6&#39;X 8&#39;. I can&#39;t dig more<br/>
&gt; than that!! We plan to have no pumps or filters.  Just<br/>
&gt; gamboozia, maybe some goldfish (feeder type) our two<br/>
&gt; little turtles, maybe transplant some crawdads  (plan<br/>
&gt; to have dirt in the bottom) and minnows, and then<br/>
&gt; whoever else moves in. We do have plans to plant<br/>
&gt; plants. Around and in. Anybody have any favorites?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; DH tells me I don&#39;t have enough cement. 3 40lb dry<br/>
&gt; bags. Oh well. DS and I will use this first and see<br/>
&gt; how far it goes, etc. then get more.  We have plans to<br/>
&gt; make inlaid stepping stones here and there anyways.<br/>
&gt; Actually the stepping stones were the original reason<br/>
&gt; to get the cement mix. I just thought that Roy would<br/>
&gt; have more enthusasim for a pond.  He does.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe we&#39;ll get really ambitious and use the quick<br/>
&gt; drying kind and make a statue or shrine or something?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wonder how hard an arched cement bridge over the brown<br/>
&gt; water run-off would be? Maybe just big enough for toy<br/>
&gt; trucks. Probably the end result will be that our yard<br/>
&gt; will look like archaeological ruins.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve found the water garden to be much less work<br/>
&gt; &gt; than a regular garden.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another benefit to it is that the bunnies can&#39;t eat<br/>

As there<br/>

We&#39;ve dug this pond out of a sloped lawn building up the lower side with<br/>
the excavated dirt. We have clay soil out here so it packed down nicely.<br/>
Not sure how you should handle the sandy stuff, maybe you could mix some<br/>
of that cement you have into the sub soil to hold it up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
how deep does the water need to be<br/>
for water lilies? Our deep side is going to be about 3<br/>
feet. It is mostly in shade...can the lilies flourish<br/>
in shade? <br/>
<br/>
Water lilies like different depths, anywhere from 1&#39; to 3&#39;. You can dig<br/>
shelves at differing depths or invert pots to hold some plants up higher.<br/>
<br/>
Just gamboozia<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s that?<br/>
<br/>
We do have plans to plant<br/>
plants. Around and in. Anybody have any favorites? <br/>
<br/>
Water irises add a nice tall element inside the water. I also like lotus<br/>
plants but don&#39;t own one, they like milder climates.<br/>
Around the outside I let the grass grow tall to give it a natural look<br/>
and hold the dirt in place. Ornamental grasses would look great but hey,<br/>
I&#39;m on a budget. I mix in bulbs like daffodils,alums and tulips with day<br/>
lilies and wild flowers. It&#39;s a big beautiful mess.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have plans to<br/>
make inlaid stepping stones here and there anyways.<br/>
<br/>
I like this idea. I&#39;ve seen so many pics in books of Japanese water<br/>
gardens with stepping stones.<br/>

It sounds like they did it by the book. I have to top mine off with a<br/>
garden hose when it gets low. The fish like to play in the stream of the<br/>
cool but most likely toxic Denver city water.<br/>
