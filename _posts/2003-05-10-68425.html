<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467978670">Pleasantville, a movie for thinking outside the box. It&#39;s an <br/>
excellent unschooling movie, IMO. All about discovering how to live <br/>
life and the astounding changes that happen when people let it happen.<br/>
<br/>
good recommend, TreeGoddess. Though, I like the farting contest idea, <br/>
too. LOL My kids are too old for that, though. I mean, a group bath. <br/>
The farting contest, they&#39;d take to in a heartbeat. LOL<br/>
<br/>
My kids made that amazing gloppy stuff yesterday, and also painted. <br/>
They painted the slats of a storage placket...what IS the word... we <br/>
have leaning against the house on the side porch. Dripped some <br/>
lavender paint on the neighbor&#39;s dog, and then brought their paint <br/>
project inside. Tempura, all of it. Bandit&#39;s lavendar paint will wash <br/>
out eventually. It&#39;s icky weather here, too. But my hubby is home and <br/>
I only have three kids to wonder what the heck they&#39;re up to.<br/>
<br/>
Pallet! you know, a wooden construct for warehouses, to keep the <br/>
stored things off the floor. sheesh.<br/>

I told my kids we were going to have panjacks today.  DANGIT!  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
get panCAKES out of my head and into my mouth!  They died laughing.  They <br/>
even called my grandparents next door and invited them over for panjacks.  <br/>
