<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846943145">Interesting discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Now about the not enforcing a bedtime - WHY??? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think one word in this sentance says it all. <br/>
Enforcing.  I certainly don&#39;t want to live in a home<br/>
where I feel that other people are &quot;enforcing&quot; things<br/>
upon me, and so I don&#39;t subject my children to that<br/>
sort of behavior.  Around here we talk about issues<br/>
where we might be in disagreement and try to reach<br/>
solutions that appease everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Your kids do not need you to help them sleep and you<br/>
&gt;being there probably actually keeps them from<br/>
&gt;sleeping well.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With one of my sons (not &quot;special needs&quot;) this is<br/>
true.  He doesn&#39;t need to sleep with us and if he<br/>
falls asleep in our bed he will either wake up and<br/>
move himself to his own bed, or wake up and ask for<br/>
help moving to his own bed.  He sleeps better through<br/>
the night in his own bed and he knows it.  He&#39;s still<br/>
afraid of the dark though, and he still likes to fall<br/>
asleep with us, or cuddle with us until he is very<br/>
sleepy and then shuffle off to his own bed.  He&#39;s 5.<br/>
<br/>
Our older son (7) does have nightmares and night<br/>
terrors, needs the physical comfort of being next to<br/>
one of us while he falls asleep, and sometimes needs<br/>
to sleep with us all night.  Usually we move him to<br/>
his own bed after he is asleep, which he doesn&#39;t mind,<br/>
or his Daddy lies down with him in his bed until he<br/>
goes to sleep.  He doesn&#39;t like for me to do that,<br/>
just Daddy, as they have a special bond.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It is not against the unschooling train of thought<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to insist that <br/>
your <br/>
children be in their rooms by a certain time each<br/>
night.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If Unschooling (damned insufficient word) is a<br/>
lifestyle choice, NOT an educational style, per se;<br/>
then I disagree with this statement.  &quot;Insisting&quot; that<br/>
the kids be banished to their rooms after a certain<br/>
time, on room arrest as it were, regardless of their<br/>
wills, desires, or plans for the evening, is not<br/>
respectful of them as people.  Treating kids as second<br/>
class citizens and subservient members of the family,<br/>
subject to your whims, is not in sync with an<br/>
&quot;unschooling train of thought.&quot;  Saying that you<br/>
&quot;insist&quot; in the first place implies that you have some<br/>
leverage you are using in order to bend them to your<br/>
will.  How will that be accomplished in a respectful<br/>
and unschooly manner?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; We remind him about 7 everynight that it is about<br/>
&gt;&gt;time for bed,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So at seven every night he is reminded that he is not<br/>
allowed free will in the simple act of knowing when he<br/>
is tired and acting accordingly.  I&#39;m not trying to be<br/>
snipey, just translating how it would feel to ME if I<br/>
were in his shoes.  I HAVE often been in such a<br/>
circumstance as a child myself, and that IS how I<br/>
felt.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; he knows the routine...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Routines are fine, kids often find it comforting to<br/>
know what comes next, and a routine can help even many<br/>
adults wind their minds down for sleep.  But this is<br/>
your imposed routine, which includes the threat of not<br/>
getting the special time for story with you if he<br/>
fails to toe the line.  It all sounds very scary to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Around here we don&#39;t sweat the small stuff.  We try to<br/>
make sure teeth get brushed before hubby and I go to <br/>
bed, because they like our help.  We also make sure<br/>
they have something comfortable on to sleep in before<br/>
we go to bed, whether that is boxer shorts, a long<br/>
t-shirt, sweats, pajamas (they do have them) or<br/>
whatever.  If they are still playing or watching a<br/>
show or something when we are ready to crash, we tell<br/>
them we are headed to bed and if they want a story<br/>
they better come get it while they can, or we&#39;ll be<br/>
asleep.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they choose to pile into bed with us and<br/>
fall asleep with us.  Sometimes they choose to get a<br/>
story or two while the getting is good and then go<br/>
back to their play.  Sometimes they choose to forgo<br/>
the story and finish their movie, or whatever.  They<br/>
usually don&#39;t stay up long after we are in bed, but I<br/>
imagine that will change as they get older.  My point<br/>
in sharing this though, is that it is THEIR choice. <br/>
We get our needs met by going to bed when we need to,<br/>
and they go to bed when they need to.  Sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
the same time, occassionally they fall asleep early<br/>
because they are tired, like last night, and sometimes<br/>
they stay up a little later.<br/>
