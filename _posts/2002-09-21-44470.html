<div id="ygrps-yiv-993706363">What is a good online source for a good quality recorder?  The only ones<br/>
I&#39;ve found locally are either made so cheaply that the notes don&#39;t sound<br/>
right, or they are encased so that they can&#39;t be touched until they are<br/>
purchased.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>

know whether you&#39;re really going to enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
If you find a site with some for sale and want to contact me on the side I <br/>
can advise you.<br/>
