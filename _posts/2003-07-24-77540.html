<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303735288">&quot;We can do it, Girls can do ANYTHING!&quot; and Carissa <br/>
confidently added &quot;Yep, Girls are POWERFUL!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like this.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra picked up a line from the Madeline movie...&quot;I can do anything&quot;, and I heard her saying it to herself a few times.<br/>
When she really wanted to learn how to ride a bike last year, she got frustrated and I reminded her of the &quot;I can do anything&quot; phrase and suggested she repeat it to herself when the going got tough. I heard her muttering &quot;I can do ANYthing&quot; under her breath several times...she figured that durn bike out in two days. It was quite amazing.<br/>
THat&#39;s her mantra now.<br/>
Cool.<br/>
