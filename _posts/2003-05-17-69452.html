One-Stop Shopping Draws Breastfeeding Moms<br/>
<br/>
By Vanessa Geneva Ahern - WeNews correspondent<br/>
<br/>
NEW YORK (WOMENSENEWS)--It is Tuesday afternoon and new <br/>
mother Kate<br/>
Yadan is in a sour mood. What&#39;s wrong?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Two a.m. emergency C-section Friday night,&quot; Yadan harrumphs,<br/>
referring to her Caesarian-section operation four days earlier. She<br/>
walks around Manhattan&#39;s only breastfeeding boutique in aggravated<br/>
slow motion with a hospital bracelet still on her wrist. &quot;Why am I<br/>
here? Because my breasts are so engorged and my husband didn&#39;t <br/>
want to<br/>
see me in any more pain.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At the Upper Breast Side, Yadan is in a place where personalized<br/>
postpartum pampering is part of the transaction. A breast pump can<br/>
look like a scary piece of equipment to first-time users. An earlier<br/>
customer was close to tears at the sight of milk coming out of her.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know what that feels like. You don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work. And<br/>
if it does work, you think it&#39;s going to hurt you,&quot; says the store&#39;s<br/>
spirited owner Felina Rakowski-Gallagher. &quot;My goal immediately after<br/>
opening the store was getting moms passed that first pumping time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since opening her boutique in January 2000, she has become a<br/>
confidante and cheerleader to nursing and expectant mothers all over<br/>
the tri-state--New York, New Jersey, Connecticut--area.<br/>
Rakowski-Gallagher, a former New York City police officer,<br/>
commandeered the store from her dining room table in the early <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was by appointment only and women had to walk up a flight of<br/>
stairs with a stroller and deal with two cats and a young child.<br/>
Still, the women kept coming and coming,&quot; says Rakowski-Gallagher.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Mothers&#39; Grapevine&#39; Spread the Word<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the &quot;mothers&#39; grapevine,&quot; word kept spreading and soon the<br/>
business started to cramp her living quarters. Her husband was tired<br/>
of coming home to half-naked ladies and begged her to look for a <br/>
store<br/>
front. Finally, in February of last year, she was able to secure a<br/>
suite in the lobby of her building on West 71st Street. Once she was<br/>
able to conduct business without scheduled appointments, her <br/>
business<br/>
increased substantially.<br/>
<br/>
The weak economy hasn&#39;t hampered nursing bra sales. Rakowski-<br/>
Gallagher<br/>
and her staff, which includes her mother Ruth Rakowski, and<br/>
occasionally her 4-year-old door greeter daughter Samantha, are<br/>
constantly answering phones and welcoming walk-in customers. The <br/>
store<br/>
sells seven brands of nursing bras in every conceivable size, from a<br/>
34L to 50K. Although Rakowski-Gallagher guards her business figures,<br/>
she did say that she sees &quot;a minimum of 100 pairs of breasts&quot; in her<br/>
store per week.<br/>
<br/>
The store isn&#39;t exactly part of big retail trend, but according to La<br/>
Leche League, there are a few others like it in California, New Mexico<br/>
and Illinois. Some women also are going to online breastfeeding shops<br/>
blissfulbabes, One Hot Mamma, and Mothers&#39; Best.<br/>
<br/>
Every two weeks, Rakowski-Gallagher&#39;s own nursing mentor, Beverly<br/>
Solow, offers &quot;latching-on&quot; classes for new moms with nursing<br/>
difficulties. The shop also features a comfy couch for weary new and<br/>
expectant moms to sink into, a baby scale so mothers can weigh their<br/>
babies before and after a feeding, a try-before-you-buy policy on<br/>
breast pumps for purchase and rental, starter kits, baby slings and<br/>
nursing swimwear.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What have women done before they had a breastfeeding boutique to <br/>
go<br/>
to? They went to a pharmacy or a big franchise store and had nobody <br/>
to<br/>
talk to,&quot; says Rakowski-Gallagher. She is grateful for organizations<br/>
such as La Leche League based in Schaumburg, Ill., that have long<br/>
provided support for nursing moms through a monthly meeting format <br/>
and<br/>
literature. Rakowski-Gallagher&#39;s shop, however, offers an entire new<br/>
level of convenience to moms.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Two generations ago, a woman&#39;s extended family would come to the<br/>
house after a child was born. In New York City today, it is often just<br/>
a woman, her partner and her new child in her home after the birth,&quot;<br/>
says Rakowski-Gallagher. &quot;La Leche League refers women to my store<br/>
constantly because they know I have pumps and I can teach women <br/>
how to<br/>
use them. I also have a list of all their nursing support groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There has been an absolute explosion in the number of breastfeeding<br/>
products on the market. At the same time, the quality has improved<br/>
dramatically. Nursing mothers no longer have to contend with poor<br/>
quality, poorly fitting, uncomfortable nursing clothing or breast<br/>
pumps that bear a closer resemblance to the family vacuum cleaner <br/>
than<br/>
anything you&#39;d find in a hospital setting. It&#39;s a great time to be a<br/>
nursing mom,&quot; says Ann Douglas, author of &quot;The Mother of All Baby<br/>
Books.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Owner Had Her Own Nursing Struggle<br/>
<br/>
After giving birth to her daughter in 1998, Rakowski-Gallagher<br/>
struggled with cracked and sore nipples and a low milk supply. When<br/>
her daughter was 3 weeks old, she called her girlfriend Dawn, who had<br/>
successfully nursed three children, for help.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I told her that I was ready to give up,&quot; says Rakowski-Gallagher.<br/>
Dawn brought in a Medela Lactina Select, a hospital grade breast <br/>
pump,<br/>
in from Long Island and showed her how to use it. Later that day, she<br/>
attended a new mother&#39;s support group at a local synagogue led by<br/>
Arlene Eisenberg, the late author of &quot;What to Expect When You&#39;re<br/>
Expecting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At the support group, a woman referred her to lactation consultant<br/>
Beverly Solow. &quot;I called up Beverly, who came to my home the next<br/>
day,&quot; recalled Rakowski-Gallagher. &quot;Before we got off the phone she<br/>
said &#39;just pump on your worst side every few hours until I get<br/>
there.&#39;&quot; The pumping relieved a lot of the pain and increased her milk<br/>
supply. Her baby started falling asleep satisfied at her breast.<br/>
<br/>
The relieved mom continued attending a nursing support group where <br/>
one<br/>
day she overheard a transplanted Salt Lake City mom brag about her<br/>
hometown&#39;s breastfeeding boutique called The Lactation Station. It <br/>
was<br/>
an epiphany for Rakowski-Gallagher. In short order she was on a flight<br/>
to Scottsdale, Ariz., with 7-month-old Samantha to attend an annual<br/>
conference for lactation consultants sponsored by the International<br/>
Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners, a nonprofit corporation that<br/>
has developed a voluntary certification program for lactation<br/>
consultants. There she met the owners of The Lactation Station and<br/>
invited herself to hang around their shop for a week. After absorbing<br/>
what she could of the business, she knew she wanted to replicate<br/>
something like it in New York.<br/>
<br/>
Vital Accessories for Working Moms<br/>
<br/>
The buzzer rings and welcomes in a tall freckle-faced woman wearing <br/>
a<br/>
black business suit. She is back at work at Morgan Stanley, the New<br/>
York financial services company, after a few months of maternity<br/>
leave. Scanning the walls that are covered with hard-to-find nursing<br/>
accessories, the new mom bursts out, &quot;I wish I had known about you<br/>
earlier!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t buy that kind of publicity!&quot; says Rakowski-Gallagher with an<br/>
infectious laugh. The customer is looking for The Easy Expression<br/>
Bustier, one of the boutique&#39;s best-selling items. It resembles a<br/>
sturdy white tube top with two holes in the front for suction cups and<br/>
is popular among working mothers because it minimizes the amount of<br/>
disrobing required to pump. The customer&#39;s office at Morgan Stanley<br/>
has two lactation rooms equipped with a hospital-grade breast pump <br/>
for<br/>
working moms.<br/>
<br/>
Corporate policy on lactation rooms is an issue that<br/>
Rakowski-Gallagher is passionate about. She urges nursing mothers to<br/>
demand a lactation room, &quot;so that you don&#39;t have to pump on a toilet<br/>
stall.&quot; She was heartened by a law firm that recently ordered a pump<br/>
for their employees.<br/>
<br/>
She wishes more companies would make life easier for nursing moms <br/>
who<br/>
return to work. &quot;There should be enough support from your family,<br/>
friends and from your businesses, that you should continue<br/>
breastfeeding for as long as you and your baby want,&quot; says<br/>
Rakowski-Gallagher.<br/>
