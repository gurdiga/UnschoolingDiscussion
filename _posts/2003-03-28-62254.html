First of all it was an interesting read. The next to last post sounded like a totally different person than the first few. I was wondering what ever happened to the adverse behavior you were sure your oldest son had and would have to unrestricted tv? Was it something you just thought he was doing because of your feelings about it all or was it real and he just got over it or what??? Just wondering because you seemed so convincing of how he behaved and then it just seemed to be alright. Was it hard to transition for him or you?<br/>
