Does anybody have any good, free, websites or &quot;freebies&quot; on the topic of <br/>
killer whales?  My son has inquired about these creatures.  Brittanica had 2 <br/>
paragraphs and were a bit over his head.  <br/>
<br/>
He comfortably reads at a beginning chapter book level.  He &quot;thinks&quot; on a <br/>
much higher level (age 11y).  Thus, he&#39;s been reading more and more.  He&#39;s caught <br/>
on that the world of reading has a lot to offer to him.  Thank God he has <br/>
come to this conclusion! He did it on his own, and now he&#39;s bringing the words to <br/>
me for help that he can&#39;t decipher in a dictionary.  His face lights up as he <br/>
discovers some new fact or digs deeper in a topic and he comes running to me <br/>
asking for &quot;more!!!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This particular time, he chose to ask Dad, Dad nearly fainted.  They spent a <br/>
couple of hours sitting in front of the computer reading Brittanica, those 2 <br/>
paragraphs.  Mind you, Dad just got off working the night shift.  The <br/>
excitement was contagious, our daughter (age 14y) came out to see what her brother had <br/>
jumped into.  There was too much quietness for her, she was positive he had <br/>
dug into trouble.  THREE hours later, all of them were still discussing their <br/>
&quot;find&quot; on killer whales.  What a blessing :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just googled orca +whales and got over 96,000 hits. I&#39;d think you could <br/>
find something there. Orca is the proper name for killer whales, but you <br/>
need to add whale to your request because there are other uses for the word.<br/>
We&#39;ve been out fishing and had them surround us. They&#39;re beautiful creatures.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577488115">Here is a place I visited in college on a one week Orca sighting <br/>
expedition. We stayed on an island and went out on a boat every day <br/>
looking for Orcas. Sadly, we never got to see one, but it was a <br/>
fantastic trip nonetheless. <br/>

<br/>
Another couple of cool scientist who are all knowing in this area of <br/>
Killer Whales are Ken Balcom (who does a lot of orca identification <br/>
in the Puget Sound area) and Robin W. Baird (whom I think does a lot <br/>
of research on their communication). <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about finding &quot;age appropriate&quot; intro stuff. I always <br/>
found that at his age I was interested in the people who were doing <br/>
the &quot;stuff&quot; as much as I was in the topic :).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>

<br/>
Does your library carry &quot;educational&quot; videos on topics like this?  My <br/>
library has started putting nonfiction videos in the stacks right with <br/>
the nonfiction (adult) books on the same topics.<br/>
<br/>
The PBS show Nature has probably done several good sea mammal shows, and <br/>
National Geographic is also a good possibility.<br/>
