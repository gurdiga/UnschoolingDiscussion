It&#39;s about a scientist who said her interest in math started with My  <br/>
Little Pony.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where I was first sent (by Rachel Ginsburg, who saw it on  <br/>
another list; thanks!!) and decided to quote that section with &quot;new  <br/>
improved&quot; links to the author, the scientist named, and the book which  <br/>
includes other MIT grad students&#39; stories of what inspired them (Lego  <br/>
and other such).<br/>

<br/>
Anyone in the mood to see some responses and maybe get in on it, the  <br/>
topic is new and some of them are anti-child, anti-play.  Stunning.   <br/>
And one person is trying to go to great lengths to discredit the whole  <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
One of the more irritating responses included this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Even though I personally lean towards the type of engineer who  <br/>
never played with any sort of doll or pony, and I don&#39;t think it was  <br/>
because I did not have a pony available at the time ( I come from a  <br/>
rather poor country, and I was given only 3 dolls throughout my  <br/>
childhood). I still had objects around me that made me wonder (at the  <br/>
age of 5 I would try to understand an astronomy book from my mother  <br/>
for hours and hours per day). -=-  (anonymous comment; doesn&#39;t say  <br/>
where or what the person is doing now)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter loved My Little Pony. She had quite a collection. I used to read her stories from a My Little Pony bumper storybook she had before she could read them herself. Sometimes, we used to play with the ponies together too and make up new stories about them. That was an interesting experience. :-)<br/>
<br/>
(She had a smaller collection of Fashion Star Fillies, similar idea but they looked more like real horses.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy days!<br/>
