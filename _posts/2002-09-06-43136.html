I think the story of Eve is intended to keep women oppressed! <br/>
I mean we&#39;re the ones that screwed everything up right? PLEASE!<br/>
I think the potential for good or bad is in us all. But I don&#39;t look at a <br/>

human contraptions and lack of love that cause the &quot;bad&quot; most of the time.<br/>

had to eat first, it doesn&#39;t really matter if it was a man or a woman <br/>
first.  Although we do now have to put up with the pain in childbirth <br/>

 happen to think she wouldn&#39;t say such, as probably some of her friends here<br/>
 are Christians who unschool. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Just for the record. I consider Sandra a friend. She has known from day one <br/>
(just when was that?) that I call myself a Christian. I&#39;ve never heard her <br/>
tell me anything negative about MY beliefs (about the world <br/>
religion/homeschool fundy thing, yes) or about Jesus.<br/>
And her clear, concise, very uncompromising beliefs in unschooling have <br/>
changed my and my children&#39;s lives forever.<br/>
I love that she&#39;ll tell me straight forward what she thinks, not what she <br/>
thinks I want to hear.<br/>
It&#39;s a rare quality in this world, and one I value greatly.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve known many &quot;Christian unschoolers&quot; who limit and censor their <br/>
<br/>
child&#39;s activities based upon Scripture, essentially forcing their <br/>
<br/>
child into compliance with the parents&#39; chosen faith and hampering <br/>
<br/>
the child&#39;s freedom to strike his own spiritual path. That was really <br/>
<br/>
more of the type of hypocrisy that I was originally referring to.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know atheist (or new age this&#39;or&#39;that) unschoolers who do the same kinds of <br/>
things, but what they&#39;re &quot;spiritual path&quot; objects to is things like Disney <br/>
logos, plastic toys, war play, rap music, hanging out with schooled kids, <br/>
watching Jerry Springer, and eating at McDonald&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It still limits their version of &quot;the whole world&quot; to the world the parents <br/>
WISH existed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;To force him/her to learn such answers before he can even ask <br/>
<br/>
the questions is to forever prevent him from ever having any <br/>
<br/>
curiosity regarding the subject. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t force anyone to learn answers, though.<br/>
If we&#39;re living &quot;learning&quot; instead of teaching, how could a movie that had <br/>
George Washington in it, or president cards the kids can put in order by the <br/>
hair and clothes, or songs or jokes about George Washington forever prevent <br/>
ANYTHING?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;To associate knowledge with <br/>
<br/>
coercion in your child&#39;s mind is one of the worst things you can do <br/>
<br/>
to him.  Coercion prevents and perverts the child&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
emotional/intellectual growth. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
But this isn&#39;t a list where anyone&#39;s promoting coercion.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He uses George Washington in this example, but you can just as <br/>
<br/>
easilty substitute Jesus or Allah or Buddha or whatver you&#39;d like <br/>
<br/>
instead, it&#39;s the same concept in my eyes.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you substitute kumquats or Shakespeare?<br/>
Because my kids never asked about kumquats on their own.  No human could <br/>
unless they lived where they grew or were tall enough to see the bitty weird <br/>
imported fruits and vegetables up at the top of the racks.<br/>
<br/>
Are you more afraid of a kid&#39;s early exposure to religious or <br/>
political/mythological figures than you are of their early exposure to Bert and Ernie?<br/>

I&#39;m not.<br/>

George Washington example, but you would have to ask him to be sure. <br/>
I think what he had in mind was the idea of young children being <br/>
indoctrinated (oops, there&#39;s that word again) in elementary school <br/>
about all things patriotic. That goes back to the debate over whether <br/>
something the having a child recite and memorize the Pledge of <br/>
Allegience before he even knows what the words truly mean is coercive.<br/>

one of those trying-to-define-the-fuzzy-lines sort of discussion, <br/>
that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you substitute kumquats or Shakespeare?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because my kids never asked about kumquats on their own.  No human <br/>
&gt; could unless they lived where they grew or were tall enough to see <br/>
&gt; the bitty weird imported fruits and vegetables up at the top of the <br/>
&gt; racks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I don&#39;t think anybody here is going to debate about whether <br/>
exposing your children to different kinds of produce can produce ill <br/>
effects, so I&#39;ll skip that example and go right on to Shakespeare. ;)<br/>
<br/>
TELLING your kids about Shakespeare, and READING Shakespeare to your <br/>
kids, that&#39;s cool--but if you take the extra step of repeatedly and <br/>
matter-of-factly telling your child &quot;Shakespeare was the greatest <br/>
writer of all time&quot;, isn&#39;t that then crossing the line, because you <br/>
are presenting your opinion as fact to your child? <br/>
<br/>
(Completely off-topic sidenote here since I sort of missed responding <br/>
to the Shakespeare thread--if you guys like _Romeo and Juliet_, why <br/>
not try reading _Layla and Majnun_ by Nizami...the Persians had a <br/>
better version of the whole &quot;star-crossed lovers&quot; thing down on paper <br/>
centuries before Shakespeare did, LOL)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you more afraid of a kid&#39;s early exposure to religious or <br/>
&gt; political/mythological figures than you are of their early exposure <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to Bert and Ernie?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, in my eyes, the worst that can happen when a parent lets her <br/>
kid watch Sesame Street all day is that the kid will develop an <br/>
effection for furry monsters and will learn bad grammar from Cookie <br/>
Monster, LOL. A kid whose parents have Jerry Falwell and Billy <br/>
Graham  playing on the TV all day...well yeah, to me that has the <br/>
potential for more sinister results. That&#39;s just my personal bias <br/>
though. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is not in the &quot;debate&quot; category.. lol.. but your comment reminded me of <br/>
something I thought was funny.  When JP was about 4, he was in a &quot;Children&#39;s <br/>
Morning Out&quot; preschool,  2 morning a week.    One day, we were at the library, <br/>
and all of the sudden, he got these wide eyes and excited tone..  He pointed <br/>
up to the American Flag displayed on the library wall, and he said &quot;Moma, moma, <br/>
we have that in preschool!    Every morning we stand up and talk to it&quot;     <br/>
LOL.. it struck me so funny.. I was not aware that they did the Pledge of <br/>
Allegiance every morning ( although I was not surprised).  But the thing was, he <br/>
has NO clue at all what he was saying or why he was saying it as he &quot;talked to <br/>
the flag&quot;....<br/>

letting my child play with a Noah&#39;s Ark toy that he has taken a fancy <br/>
<br/>
to is no different than a Christian parent not letting their child <br/>
<br/>
play with a dreidel or whatever. To my son, it&#39;s just a toy boat with <br/>
<br/>
a bunch of animals on it, LOL. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You really wouldn&#39;t tell him the story if he asked?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a story. (LOL)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think that that is the context in which Henry was using the <br/>
<br/>
George Washington example, but you would have to ask him to be sure. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter what Henry asked.  <br/>
We&#39;re talking about unschooling, and if you intend to use his words to defend <br/>
the idea that you won&#39;t bring up any creation stories until kids ask, then <br/>
&quot;bringing something up&quot; would include telling a kid who you (or anyone else) <br/>
think was the first person on the planet, OR who George Washington was.   Any kid <br/>
who&#39;s ever had a one dollar bill or a quarter is likely to ask &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Sorry, Canadians and Brits, Kiwis and Aussies.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think what he had in mind was the idea of young children being <br/>
<br/>
indoctrinated (oops, there&#39;s that word again) in elementary school <br/>
<br/>
about all things patriotic.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  Maybe so.  And you keep talking about school a lot, but it would be <br/>
more helpful to the list if you would talk about your own children and your <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the first to have used the word &quot;indoctrinated&quot; in this <br/>
conversation, either, but I&#39;m not going to go back and read the archives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503348992">I haven&#39;t posted yet other than my intro I belive, but I just had to <br/>
say that I too am a Christian unschooler (Catholic, in fact).  I do <br/>
not get any flack at all from any community including people of my <br/>
faith.  <br/>
<br/>
I do believe that everyones beliefs are such a very personal thing <br/>
and I would never try to impose my views on anyone and I expect the <br/>
same from others as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that is one of the great things about unschooling.  Just <br/>
observing the world around us and realizing that there are as many <br/>
different ways of doing things as there are people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144654320">I too do not post often but wanted to say I am also a Christian.  In fact my<br/>
husband and I are ministers.  I realize often how very radical we are<br/>
compared to other Christian homeschoolers.  I don&#39;t know any unschoolers in<br/>
our area.  I think that the movement to unschool was so natural to our<br/>
family because we have always been careful to respect others and where they<br/>
are in life with their beliefs and so on. We help our children do the same.<br/>
We think outside of the box on a regular basis.  We allow our children to<br/>
make their own decisions.  We encourage them not to do something just<br/>
because they think they have to.   Heck, on Election Day our local poll had<br/>
a separate place for kids to vote. The girls and I have had many discussions<br/>
on the election process and about the candidate&#39;s views on particular<br/>
issues.   Well, my youngest daughter was all in to wanting to vote.  But my<br/>
oldest daughter (12) didn&#39;t want any part of it.  I told her it was<br/>
certainly her decision that she did not have too if she didn&#39;t want to.  The<br/>
only question I asked was &quot;why?&quot;  She couldn&#39;t give me an answer.  But that<br/>
is o.k.  My mother about had a cow when she heard my dd didn&#39;t vote.  I<br/>
quickly told her not to say one word to her about it.  I explained why she<br/>
had every right not to and reminded her we live in the &quot;land of the free&quot;.<br/>
My dh and I don&#39;t say much about how we homeschool so we don&#39;t get any flack<br/>
from our faith community.  We took our children out of public school because<br/>
of the lack of education that goes on there, not for any sort of religious<br/>
beliefs.<br/>
