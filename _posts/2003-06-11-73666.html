  I know many of you already posted about your MB type, but I am a very <br/>
  visual, big-picture type of person, and I would love to see how the <br/>
  graph would look of this group.  I know the tests are sometimes <br/>
  ambiguous in their wording, but I also find that a good way to <br/>
  determine type is to look at the description for the types you feel <br/>
  closely resemble you, and the right one should be pretty obvious.  <br/>
  Maybe not the most scientific of methods, but if nothing more, it <br/>
  would be a fun way to see how &quot;uniform&quot; our personalities are or <br/>
  aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  Here is a fun description page that I liked because it isn&#39;t just a <br/>
  generic, &quot;good qualities&quot; one.  It has a little humor in pointing out <br/>
  the less-desirable aspects of each personality type also.  You have <br/>
  to scroll way down to find &quot;THE 16 TYPES IN FULL DETAIL&quot; with the 16 <br/>
  types in blue, and click on your type.<br/>
