&gt; Subject: kids&#39; questions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the way to meet some friends for a day at the beach, my son (6yo) and I<br/>
&gt; started talking about the fact that his best friend will be going back to<br/>
&gt; school next week, and we won&#39;t be able to see him before late afternoon<br/>
&gt; anymore. My son then asked &quot;why don&#39;t more people homeschool?&quot;  It seemed<br/>
&gt; like such a simple question that I had a hard time answering it. I am<br/>
&gt; wondering if anyone has any great answers to this question that a young<br/>
&gt; child can easily grasp?<br/>
