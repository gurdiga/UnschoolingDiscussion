<div id="ygrps-yiv-957032141">Hi Angela!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your kind words. And yes, you are right it does fall under the<br/>
&quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot;! :) One of my favorite books....<br/>
When I read it, it makes me cry! :) <br/>
<br/>
I understand that of your cousin&#39;s situation, as well. Believe it or not, my<br/>
parents were also physical and emotionally and mentally abusive too. My<br/>
mother used to beat me with anything she could find - a shoe, a belt buckle<br/>
or her favorite was for me to find my &quot;switch&quot; from this long tall purple<br/>
tree in our front yard with long thin branches. My father, he was and still<br/>
is emotionally abusive. His words cut like a knife to me as a young<br/>
impressionable young girl.<br/>
<br/>
It took counseling when I was 13 (after my mother was attempting to beat me<br/>
in the kitchen with a shoe and I grabbed a knife in self defense), for us to<br/>
get past the physical abuse, and she then never laid a hand on me again. And<br/>
should would never even dream of doing so with my children, as she is<br/>
getting her &quot;second chance&quot; as she puts it to make things right.<br/>
<br/>
My father, is my father, and I have accepted that he is who he is. He<br/>
continues to abuse me in this way even today. When I have stronger days, I<br/>
stand up to him, other days it is harder when I am sick (I have just been<br/>
diagnosed with Lupus and Thrombophilia or sticky blood as it is called) but<br/>
overall I try not to let his words pierce me and I have learned too that I<br/>
cannot change him, only change myself and my reaction or non-reaction to it.<br/>
<br/>
So I can relate very much to your cousin. But somehow, for me, despite the<br/>
abuses going on, there were good times I remember and my feelings about<br/>
Santa never changed, I just love the spirit and meaning behind Santa, as I<br/>
wrote! :) Has your cousin been able to work through the issues?<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, Angela, there is a Santa Claus! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making my day sweeter by your kind words!:)<br/>

Patti,<br/>
What you wrote was beautiful and also the theme behind &quot;yes Virginia, there<br/>
is a Santa Claus&quot;, which I love and plan to share with my children at some<br/>
point.<br/>
 <br/>
I also wanted to mention that the cousin I mentioned who felt so betrayed by<br/>
her parents also had a LOT of other issues with regards to her parent&#39;s<br/>
parenting.  So, it&#39;s not like the Santa issue was the only thing she was<br/>
lied to about.  There was both physical and mental abuse to go with it.<br/>
 <br/>

Santa may not be real in the sense of we cannot feel, touch, smell, taste or<br/>
hear him BUT we can believe in what he is in our hearts - a sense of<br/>
innocence, a sense of awe and wonder at life and of life and in life.<br/>

I have friends who were terribly bothered by their parent&#39;s<br/>
&#39;lies&#39; about Santa.  But, then again, lots of things about their upbringing<br/>
bother them.<br/>
