<div id="ygrps-yiv-522736360">Hi, <br/>
I&#39;ve been on this list for two or three years, and my oldest is seven now.  We have done various stages of unschooling.  It has been a long process for me to deschool myself.  My daughter has always been at home.  When she was younger, I definitely tried the school at home approach, and it really made her hate schoolwork.  <br/>
Fast forward to now.  My husband and I are still slightly tentative with this approach, and worried that she won&#39;t learn how to do arithmetic.  I really tried to spend 15 minutes a day of phonics to help her learn to read when she was younger.  It didn&#39;t do anything except make her want to avoid me.  I didn&#39;t want to sacrifice my relationship with her to the altar of education, so I let go of it for about six months, and she is now reading level 1 books. Yay!  I started letting her watch Angelina Ballerina, (I only let her watch documentaries before),  and then to encourage the reading, I got her the books that went with it (which I wouldn&#39;t have done before, because I don&#39;t like how companies prey on children with attractive marketing).  She likes the books, and laughs over them, which makes me happy, because she is happy.  <br/>
<br/>
She loves audio books, and has listened to the unabridged versions of Little Women, Anne of Green Gables, Little Princess, Secret Garden, the Little House on the Prairie series, and Misty of Chincoteague. She listened to Little Women for about 5-6 months straight.  I tried to extend her learning by doing projects related to the stuff she was listening to:  we made a telegraph machine, I took her to places civil war related, she planted a garden, she acted out many scenes with her brother, I took them horse back riding, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
Right now she is really into Liberty&#39;s Kids, a PBS animated series that dramatizes the times from the Boston Tea Party to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. She has watched the entire series (40 episodes, 30 minutes each) three times.  I&#39;m not used to letting her watch videos so much. I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with it because she is not getting a lot of exercise because of it.  I know she is really enjoying it, and that she is busy assimilating the information, but I still worry.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;m glad that she likes it because we are in the process of moving, so it is helpful, plus it is hot and muggy here. Who wants to be outside anyway?  Is watching this much tv harmful though?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, how can I present some fun math stuff to her?  A couple of months ago, she was playing around with some of the math on starfall.com (they have interactive math games) but she is really into liberty&#39;s kids right now, not math.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, my almost five year old son doesn&#39;t really want to watch liberty&#39;s kids, but he also wants to be in front of the screen.  This leads to him getting bored, and being annoying, (making noises so she can&#39;t hear, spinning his chair so it hits hers, on accident,  etc, etc. etc. )  I got him some crafts from Michael&#39;s, which he really likes.  He can do some of those in front of the screen, but that is going to run out soon.  He won&#39;t do anything I suggest (color, draw, listen to a story in the other room, anything, ) so it&#39;s a bit difficult.  I also have an almost 10 month old baby who is not supposed to watch screens (the board of pediatricians says babies shouldn&#39;t watch until age 2), so I have to monitor him, and it usually ends with me wearing him in the backpack ALL THE TIME. <br/>
<br/>
In our old house, she was always upstairs (which I felt was too isolating for her) while I was downstairs always interacting with the four year old.  I felt like she was missing out on all the fun we were having, and possibly getting neurotic about things.  I had her signed up for a sport every day of the week, so I felt like she was at least visiting with her sporty friends, and getting exercise.  <br/>
<br/>
In our new house, we all are basically hanging out in the kitchen. I feel like that is good for her (less isolating), but also can be difficult sometimes, logistically.  I set up two computers on the sideboard to create a computer lab type atmosphere for the kids, but one of the computers is not currently linked to the internet (which means four year old can&#39;t do starfall.com (his favorite).  <br/>
<br/>
Do people think that it&#39;s too much screen time for the kids?  <br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions for the almost five year old who wants to be in front of screen, but is bored?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Kim</div>

Don&#39;t.  Learn (yourself) how to see the math that is all around you that doesn&#39;t look at all like school math.<br/>

<br/>
You were sitting in front of &quot;the screen&quot; to write your questions to the group.   <br/>
Your use of the phrase &quot;the screen&quot; is much more harmful to your family&#39;s peace and to your understanding of natural learning than TV, computer, movies or video games could ever be. <br/>
<br/>
When your daughter is reading a book, or the back of a cereal box, do you say she was wanting to be in front of **the paper**?  <br/>
Do you limit the time they gaze toward the printed word, and measure and limit it?<br/>
<br/>
Information and stimulation come in lots of forms, and if your goal is for your children to learn and be happy, use those principle to help you make your decisions.<br/>

You don&#39;t have to monitor him.  The board of pediatricians are not unschoolers.  They don&#39;t own your baby or your life.<br/>
<br/>
****Until a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from working, unschooling cannot begin to work. It seems simple to me. If you&#39;re trying to listen for a sound, you have to stop talking and be still. <br/>

Connect that computer to the internet.  You have a modem.  Buy a cord.<br/>

Your daughter learned to read better when you weren&#39;t teaching her.  You should look at her, not at what doctors write about school kids.<br/>

You think of companies &quot;preying&quot; on your children?  You would refuse to buy her a book (BOOK) she wanted because of your feelings about companies?<br/>
That&#39;s way too many levels of agitated thought between you and your direct observation of your children.<br/>

<br/>
If you can generalize that to all your decisions, your life will be better immediately, and your children&#39;s lives will be, too.<br/>
<br/>
Attractive marketing is better than ugly marketing.   If you see the world through fearful glasses, it&#39;s all ugly.  It makes your children &quot;prey,&quot; and wrong, and in danger.  <br/>
If you can see the world through peaceful glasses, every single thing and every single thought will be different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588304064">Instead of going through your post piece by piece, I&#39;ll say this:  <br/>
<br/>
I almost stopped breathing when I was reading.  Just reading this made me feel tense, like I was going downhill faster and faster and faster.  I got to the end and realized I needed to take a breath.  There is so much fear and worry and &quot;what if&quot; and and and and and....<br/>
<br/>
Then at the end was this:<br/>
<br/>
***Does anyone have any suggestions for the almost five year old who wants to be in front of screen, but is bored?***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This part clearly shows your frame of mind.  Does your child want to be in front of a screen, or does he want to watch something interesting, or do something interesting? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can he play starfall while his sister is watching the show she wants to watch?<br/>
<br/>
If you can stop and breathe and see what is in the moment, moment by moment, you can find logistics to being with 3 kids, helping them each do things that they enjoy doing.  All those things you help them do happily, will be things they will learn from.  Once you can relax, you will be able to see the learning in all the things they do.<br/>
<br/>
One of your fears is how your kids will learn math, it&#39;s a common one.<br/>
<br/>
One of my children learned multiplication by playing with legos.  I&#39;d never considered that it could happen until it did, but it made sense because each lego piece has a certain length, numbered by dots, repeat that and you have a pattern.  Building with legos is, to a large extent, building with patterns.  That happened when she was about 7/8.<br/>
<br/>
My other child asked what multiplication was, I think she was about 10, I don&#39;t remember exactly.  I gave her a brief explanation and her response was something like &quot;oh, is that all?  I thought it was something really hard.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Neither of my kids had any math lessons.  Each one has found ways to do arithmetic and each one has asked hard questions and puzzled out answers.  Math is everywhere, all around us.  We measure and calculate, we examine structure and balance, we weigh things, sometimes literally.  We compare and contrast the world around us.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, you guys hang out in the kitchen with 2 computers.  Try to connect the other one to the internet and if you can&#39;t, put some interesting movie on it, let the older 2 take turns playing games on the other one, and let the baby sit in a high chair with interesting things to touch.  What a blessing that you guys all are together in one location with the ability to be occupied and happy!  My kids are 7 yrs apart and when they were younger, having them in the same room was a great and rare occasion because they were busy doing totally different activities, which meant that I was going back and forth a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
Pretend that you are on summer vacation right now and don&#39;t even think about school being in session.  Stop doing that completely and behave as if you were on vacation.  Do summer things and stop worrying so much about how much and too much.  Open up the doors and windows and spend your days going in and out, make sun tea, burn things with magnifying glasses, use side walk chalk, set up a wading pool, listen for the ice cream truck and keep piles of change on the ready.<br/>
<br/>
In the back of your mind, way in the back, see the learning in each and every one of those activities, don&#39;t hyper focus on it, see it, recognize it and move on.  Let your focus be on happy fun!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s *hugely* important that people realize that kids can&#39;t learn to  <br/>
read if they aren&#39;t developmentally ready. Reading lessons before  <br/>
they&#39;re ready are as useless as walking and talking lessons before  <br/>
they&#39;re ready. And they&#39;re just as unnecessary after.<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s counter to the message of school where it&#39;s &quot;We need to  <br/>
teach them even earlier!&quot; But there are no public schools in the US  <br/>
who are allowing kids to become developmentally ready to read without  <br/>
lessons so educators (in general) have no idea that reading can happen  <br/>
without lessons. The kids&#39; brains are developing while the reading  <br/>
lessons are happening. Not because of the reading lessons but because  <br/>
they&#39;re growing older.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Become blind to levels. Don&#39;t even look at them. In fact unless *she*  <br/>
is drawn to a book with a level label, I&#39;d avoid them entirely.  <br/>
They&#39;re designed for reading practice, not as real books to read.  <br/>
Interest is what will draw her to read. :-) The first book Kathryn  <br/>
read on her own was Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where you&#39;re getting stuck, I think, is you&#39;re looking at the  <br/>
information and skills you want to get into her and trying to find  <br/>
ways to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Feed her interests rather than skills. Don&#39;t worry about the skills! I  <br/>
*know* that&#39;s hard to do! But read more about how other kids learned,  <br/>
especially at Sandra&#39;s site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling.">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling.</a> Kids  <br/>
pick up skills *as a side effect* in their quest to find out more  <br/>
about what fascinates them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s how kids learn to talk. They get better at talking by talking for  <br/>
real purposes, by using speech as a tool to get what they want. Kids  <br/>
learn how to read, manipulate numbers, figure out where countries are,  <br/>
tell time all by sucking that information in in their quest to know  <br/>
more about the things that appeal to them.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about the skills schooled kids are learning. Schooled kids  <br/>
are in a waste land of interest. The most interesting thing in the  <br/>
classroom may be the clock ;-) Unschooled kids are learning about what  <br/>
interests them and picking up skills as they go along. If unschooled  <br/>
kids were only quizzed on the skills, they&#39;ll look behind. But if  <br/>
someone could quiz them on what they know -- pretty much impossible  <br/>
since they aren&#39;t going in any kind of order! -- they&#39;ll run circles  <br/>
around kids in school ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Learning is like working a ginormous jigsaw puzzle. In school, they go  <br/>
in order, working on the (supposedly) important parts of the important  <br/>
sections, telling kids exactly what pieces to put where. And it&#39;s  <br/>
dull. And it&#39;s hard *because* it&#39;s dull.<br/>
<br/>
In real life, people plunge in doing whatever section of the puzzle  <br/>
appeals to them, dropping one section to do something that catches  <br/>
their interest, going back, working one section exclusively, working a  <br/>
bit here and there and everywhere. It&#39;s messy and disorderly! But it&#39;s  <br/>
fun and it works because that&#39;s how we&#39;re designed to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning is how kids learn to speak. And it works effortlessly  <br/>
and wonderfully well. Artificial, hard learning in school is how kids  <br/>
are taught foreign languages, focusing on the skills and the mechanics  <br/>
and what can be tested. And it rarely achieves anything that lasts  <br/>
beyond the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because I don&#39;t like how companies prey on children with attractive  <br/>
&gt; marketing).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids aren&#39;t stupid! ;-) They don&#39;t enjoy programs and books  and songs  <br/>
because of advertising. They may be initially drawn to something by  <br/>
advertising, but it if doesn&#39;t appeal to them, they&#39;ll drop it. Just  <br/>
as adults do.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a pervasive idea that kids are easily captivated. Just throw  <br/>
colorful cute characters at them and they&#39;ll follow those characters  <br/>
anywhere. But that&#39;s a very low opinion of kids! All you have to do is  <br/>
look at real kids. They&#39;re picky!  They&#39;re discriminatory! But they  <br/>
are kids and their tastes are different from adult tastes. They need  <br/>
things that adults don&#39;t understand and therefore look down on and  <br/>
dismiss as trivial.<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn how to make choices by making real choices. By trying  <br/>
things out. By finding what they like about what they try and what  <br/>
they don&#39;t like. And in the process they learn more about who they are.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much easier -- much safer! -- for her to make choices now when  <br/>
the choices are Angelina and Captain Underpants than when she&#39;s older  <br/>
and faced with decisions about alcohol, driving and sex!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She loves audio books, and has listened to the unabridged versions  <br/>
&gt; of Little Women, Anne of Green Gables, Little Princess, Secret  <br/>
&gt; Garden, the Little House on the Prairie series, and Misty of  <br/>
&gt; Chincoteague. She listened to Little Women for about 5-6 months  <br/>
&gt; straight.<br/>
&gt; I tried to extend her learning<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t try to extend her learning. Expand her world  into other things  <br/>
she might think are interesting. Try -- for now! -- to avoid anything  <br/>
you think would be good for her to learn. This will be hard! But look  <br/>
at your daughter. Look at *everything* that appeals to her, not just  <br/>
the parts you like that appeals to her. Help her explore what  <br/>
interests her. Run things you think she would be interested in through  <br/>
her life.<br/>
<br/>
If she likes poop jokes, get her poop joke books. Look up poop jokes  <br/>
on the internet. Find poop songs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking you just want to fill her with quality ingredients. (It&#39;s  <br/>
a common mom desire!) But she&#39;s not an empty vessel. She&#39;s a human  <br/>
with different tastes than you. She&#39;s a child with different interests  <br/>
than an adult. She has whatever interests she has for a reason. You  <br/>
don&#39;t need to understand why. To support her and her interests you  <br/>
just need to help her get more of what she&#39;s trying to reach. And then  <br/>
run lots of other stuff you think might appeal through her life so she  <br/>
has access to more potential interests.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; them horse back riding, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are all cool things and I don&#39;t want to discourage you from  <br/>
doing them! If they had fun, that&#39;s what counts :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to encourage you to expand your offerings. See the world  <br/>
through kids eyes in addition to the &quot;good for them&quot; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with it because she is not getting a lot  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you&#39;d probably have an even harder time if it was a show she loved  <br/>
that you didn&#39;t! At least your daughter&#39;s helping you ease into this :-)<br/>
<br/>
Rather than thinking in terms of taking away, think in terms of adding  <br/>
to her life. Kids don&#39;t get much exercise from reading books but few  <br/>
parents demonize books because of that. Some activities are more head  <br/>
oriented. (Though you can get a mini trampoline for in front of the TV  <br/>
if you&#39;ve got kids who like to move around while they watch :-) Some  <br/>
activities are more body oriented. Neither is bad because they&#39;re not  <br/>
the other. Add some park days and trips to climb rocks and swim and so  <br/>
on to their lives. Not instead of TV. In addition to TV.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, how can I present some fun math stuff to her? A couple of  <br/>

&gt; into liberty&#39;s kids right now, not math.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And maybe she always will be more drawn to language than numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware of the numbers in her life that are already there. Weigh  <br/>
things at the supermarket. Ask her to see how close she can get to  <br/>
exactly 2 pounds of apples. Put their heights on the wall. Give her an  <br/>
allowance. Do this for real, not as lessons.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter learned most of her math from video games. Games use  <br/>
numbers for real, important (to the game) reasons. And kids *want* to  <br/>
pull more information from the games in order to get better at them.  <br/>
The numbers aren&#39;t there to make kids figure them out as they are in  <br/>
educational math games. The numbers exist for real purposes to show  <br/>
relative strengths, to show how much power is left, to keep score, to  <br/>
keep track. There are maps. There are graphs. Real purposes.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s quite a bit to read about real math and the poor substitute  <br/>
that school math is down the left sidebar under Math at:<br/>

Help him.<br/>

It will also help not to see unschooling as about finding ways to  <br/>

If you&#39;re moving and need to be doing things to get ready, perhaps  <br/>
finding a homeschooled teen to come be with them will help. But do see  <br/>
your unschooling role as being whatever they need you to be in their  <br/>
quest for learning. Your goal isn&#39;t to get them set up so they can  <br/>
learn on their own.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re doing that all the time, or that&#39;s your whole  <br/>
focus. But that view is in what you wrote and is probably coloring the  <br/>
way you&#39;re approaching helping them learn.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also have an almost 10 month old baby who is not supposed to watch  <br/>
&gt; screens (the board of pediatricians says babies shouldn&#39;t watch  <br/>
&gt; until age 2),<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t put much credence into what they say. They really don&#39;t  <br/>
know. You don&#39;t know what the studies are, or why they were done, or  <br/>
who paid for them that has made the pediatrics association release  <br/>
that blanket statement.<br/>
<br/>
Better far than an anonymous herd of pediatricians who&#39;ve never met  <br/>
your unique child is your child.<br/>
<br/>
Most 10 mos aren&#39;t interested in TV! If he is, let him watch what he  <br/>
likes. (It&#39;s doubtful it will be for long!) Watching the other kids,  <br/>
you, touching, listening, moving are all activities that a 10 mo is  <br/>
likely to find more interesting than TV. If he loves the backpack,  <br/>
that&#39;s the best place for him. It&#39;s a great solution. He gets to be  <br/>
with the toy that&#39;s best for babies: their moms. He gets to see what&#39;s  <br/>
going on in the world while you&#39;re doing real things.<br/>
<br/>
If it needs to be most of the day, let it be most of the day.<br/>
<br/>
It helps sanity greatly to let go of how you expect life to be. Work  <br/>
towards better, yes! It won&#39;t help you or them be happy if you hold a  <br/>
vision of how you expect your kids will be. They didn&#39;t sign up for  <br/>
this gig ;-) They were dragged into the world because you choose to do  <br/>
that to them. Looking at them and their needs will help you more than  <br/>
your expectations of who you&#39;d like them to be.<br/>
