<div id="ygrps-yiv-44246238">My always been unschooled son is quite upset at his inability to read.  He<br/>
will be 11 in August.<br/>
<br/>
For two reasons- he wants to read stuff, and people&#39;s attitudes (why can&#39;t<br/>
you read?)<br/>
<br/>
I keep saying- &quot;it is ok, lots of kids learn to read later...&quot;, &quot;you have<br/>
been learning tons of other things....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know what it is like when he is relaxed and excited about something and<br/>
expanding his horizons.  He is not relaxed and excited about this.  He feels<br/>
it is really hard and he is worried he won&#39;t be able to do it.  I say, &quot;just<br/>
give yourself a break- one day it will feel easy..&quot;.  I feel like he reads a<br/>
lot of stuff already and I tell him that- he says &quot; I just know the SHAPE or<br/>
font of the word and the context- I cant READ it- I don&#39;t know the letters&quot;<br/>
I say - but that IS reading...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. I would like to hear from people who have had and gotten through<br/>
this situation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my son was 11, he was much the same way, though he didn&#39;t talk about<br/>
it.  (He&#39;s never talked about feelings much.)  Please don&#39;t make the mistake<br/>
I did and *push* phonics.  Lars learned to read that way, but he also<br/>
learned to hate reading.  (I know you weren&#39;t suggesting that you might,<br/>
just wanted to warn you.)<br/>
<br/>
Would he understand that the way he reads now (and he *does* read, from what<br/>
you say) is how how many kids learn to read?  Lots of kids learn without<br/>
knowing the letters and their sounds.  They&#39;re the ones who learn by<br/>
watching the page when they are being read to.  Eventually they know enough<br/>
words that they can figure out the ones they don&#39;t know.  At that point,<br/>
some kids are helped by learning a bit of phonics, so they can puzzle out<br/>
unfamiliar words more easily.  But some never use phonics consciously at<br/>
all.<br/>

<br/>
this situation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly learned to read after she was ten.  She was frustrated sometimes.  She <br/>
would have liked to have played Pokemon but couldn&#39;t read the cards.   She <br/>
pressed me to get her something she could use to learn, so we got a book with <br/>
word lists and a used copy of Teach Your Child to Read in100 Easy Lessons (or <br/>
whatever it&#39;s called).  We did a few chapters (ignoring their weird notations, <br/>
just reading the lists and samples), and they frustrated her, so she tried <br/>
sometimes and said no sometimes, and I didn&#39;t press.  I kept her busy and <br/>
distracted and read to her when necessary and gradually (kind of suddenly, but <br/>
gradually within that few months) it came together for her.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the books helped except to show her that reading lesson books <br/>
aren&#39;t magic nor even very sensible things.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is get that book if he seems interested, make lists of the words he <br/>
DOES know (maybe put them on 3x5 cards) and as he sees how many he does know, <br/>
he might feel better.   MAYBE (if he&#39;s interested) you could put similar <br/>
words on the back of the words he knows for sure.  <br/>
<br/>
We had some cards sometimes for Kirby and Marty (we&#39;d lose them and find them <br/>
again, or use them for other things and make new ones--not too focussed on <br/>
that front), like eight or ten cards, no big deal.  But if, for example, you <br/>
have a dog named  Flipper (we used to) maybe you could put on the back of that <br/>
other words (not ALL of them, but a  few) like sipper, skipper, zipper.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe read to him what Carol Rice wrote about her son Liam, which is here:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if anyone has posted this but there are a couple of really good<br/>
reading<br/>
threads at www.unschooling.com in Sandra&#39;s folder.  They really saved me at<br/>
one<br/>
time.  I found that while I was confident that my children would learn to<br/>
read on<br/>
their own when they were ready, that they were not so confident. It seemed<br/>
almost<br/>
impossible for them at times to ever believe that they could learn to read,<br/>
it was<br/>
much like what a foreign language might look like to an adult. I really<br/>
struggled<br/>
with protecting them and their self esteem as they get older and realise<br/>
other children<br/>
their age or younger are reading. I would explain how those children<br/>
practiced reading<br/>
every day from 5 yrs old on.<br/>
<br/>
I think I can sort of understand where they were<br/>
coming from. I know that sometimes when there are things I &quot;think&quot; are<br/>
too hard for me or doesn&#39;t come naturally or easily, I just don&#39;t want to do<br/>
or<br/>
learn them.  Like learning how to run our business if anything every<br/>
happened to my<br/>
dh. I have a friend who said of course I would and I was absolutely sure<br/>
that<br/>
I couldn&#39;t do it!  Then I thought, maybe she is right, maybe I could. Now I<br/>
am a<br/>
pretty confident person, but there are some real technical, mechanical and<br/>
physical aspects of the job that &quot;I think&quot; I would just not &quot;get&quot; (kinda<br/>
like how<br/>
some folks shut down with &quot;math&quot;). The very idea terrifies me, scares me so<br/>
much<br/>
I would almost rather give up (the business) than<br/>
take a chance and apply myself.  And sometimes I think thats where my<br/>
children<br/>
were with reading.<br/>
<br/>
Once they got that everything they were doing, asking<br/>
how to write a word, what sound does this word make, what does this say<br/>
were all leading to reading.  My dd will be 10 in two weeks and has just in<br/>
the<br/>
past couple of weeks started to read &quot;pretty well&quot;.  She is into Calvin and<br/>
Hobbes<br/>
(purchased on the off chance she might find those more interesting than any<br/>
other<br/>
story/chapter book we have, and they were).  But, she has been wanting to<br/>
read<br/>
since she was 6!  It was not an easy process for her. It was not an<br/>
effortless<br/>
process for her.  My son, who is 8.5 is just now starting to want to read<br/>
(since last fall maybe) and getting it much quicker than his sister was at<br/>
that<br/>
age. My 6 yr old will probably be reading sooner than the first two, he<br/>
seems<br/>
to have the motivation without the fear or realisation that that is what<br/>
other<br/>
kids his age are doing.  So to make a long story longer, I don&#39;t know how<br/>
we protect our kids from the self-esteem issues of knowing other kids their<br/>
age are reading and its ok for them not to be reading now.  Anyone have any<br/>
suggestions for that?<br/>
<br/>
One other thing I did tell my son when he was feeling<br/>
down about not reading I asked him some questions:  does J being able to<br/>
read<br/>
make him a better cub scout than you? does he say the scouts pledge better<br/>
than you? has he earned more awards than you have?  does reading make<br/>
him a better motorcycle rider than you? etc. etc.  that seemed to help him<br/>
a lot also.<br/>

<br/>
I remember saying one day &quot;What can you do better than Kellee can do?&quot; <br/>
Holly said &quot;lots of things.&quot;  So we talked about the things Kellee, who was a <br/>
year older and in school, could not do as well as Holly.  And I said &quot;Some <br/>
day she might catch up with you, and I know someday you will catch up with her <br/>
in reading, but I don&#39;t know when it will be!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We talked about people being happy and having fun even if they couldn&#39;t walk <br/>
yet or couldn&#39;t ride a bike yet, or if their moms didn&#39;t let them climb trees. <br/>
 So emphasizing the range of interests and abilities in the kids all around <br/>
her, from babies to teens, helped her see them all as individuals instead of <br/>
starting to compare kids the same age, school-style.   <br/>
<br/>
It helped particularly if there were things in our family in which Marty was <br/>
better than Kirby or she was better than one or both of them.  Calmed her <br/>
right down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One other thing I did tell my son when he was feeling<br/>
<br/>
down about not reading I asked him some questions:  does J being able to<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
him a better motorcycle rider than you? etc. etc.  that seemed to help him<br/>
<br/>
a lot also.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same deal.  Not only was it distracting and reassuring, but it makes the <br/>
worried child see what he DOES do, not what he doesn&#39;t yet do.<br/>
