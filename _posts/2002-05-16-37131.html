<div id="ygrps-yiv-927076303">&lt;&lt;Our son is now 9 months old, and he has yet to see a TV screen &quot;on&quot;,<br/>
except<br/>
for one time when we did an experiment.  We turned the TV on ONCE when he<br/>
was about 7 months, and even though both of us were in the room and there<br/>
were plenty of other things to do and look at -- which he was always<br/>
otherwise perfectly happy with -- once he spotted that TV picture, it was<br/>
like there was nothing else in the room.  No matter what else happened<br/>
for<br/>
the next five minutes, he would not take his eyes off that screen.<br/>
Needless to say, that was all we needed to know; it was enough for us. <br/>
The<br/>
TV has stayed OFF ever since.  Shortly, I am building a wall-mount<br/>
cabinet<br/>
that will cover the TV with locked doors.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you would come to any other conclusion based on your feelings<br/>
about TV.  It makes perfect sense that your son would be entranced by<br/>
anything so new to him, we got the same reaction from my son at the same<br/>
age when we put a string of Christmas lights.  Obviously, parents must<br/>
make the best choice they can for their children but I got an oppressive<br/>
feeling from reading what you had to say here.  I get an image of this<br/>
&quot;cabinet&quot; with &quot;locked doors&quot; as constant reminder to your child that you<br/>
hold all the keys/control.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have since noticed this in other children when at friends&#39; houses --<br/>
the<br/>
kids barely even acknowledge that you&#39;re there, they can&#39;t take their<br/>
eyes<br/>
off the screen, and basically seem hypnotized.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would you come to the same conclusion if they were engrossed in a book or<br/>
experiment and barely acknowledged you?  There is a lot of propaganda out<br/>
there about TV with little to no evidence to back it up.  It wouldn&#39;t<br/>
matter how much they were learning, many see kids watching TV and knee<br/>
jerk reaction is &quot;Look at that, they&#39;re hypnotized!&quot;  I see the same look<br/>
when kids are watching someone read a story, if I had been conditioned to<br/>
think books are bad I would probably come to a negative conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now this brings up a question.  I know in many states that<br/>
homeschoolers<br/>
are required to adminster state-mandated tests tot heir own children. <br/>
How<br/>
do Unschoolers handle these requirements?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many go underground and simply don&#39;t register.  I haven&#39;t heard from even<br/>
one who has had any trouble.  Some older kids can deal with regurgitating<br/>
enough stuff to pass tests but it isn&#39;t what I would want for mine.<br/>
