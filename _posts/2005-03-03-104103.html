<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916423520">We&#39;ll be going to visit my in-laws in May, and my mil hates the fact <br/>
that I homeschool. I haven&#39;t EVEN told her about unschooling. I&#39;m <br/>
hoping and praying it doesn&#39;t even come up. She&#39;s usually pretty good <br/>
about keeping her mouth shut, and I KNOW she really really really <br/>
wants to nag me about it non-stop whenever we get together. The last <br/>
time we went, she managed to be quiet until the very last day of our <br/>
stay (which was too long by about three days. It was a four day <br/>
visit.) :&#92;<br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old isn&#39;t reading. That will give mil fits. We&#39;re not <br/>
teaching anything formally academic, though all the kids know how to <br/>
make any kind of change you can imagine, and are telling time &quot;okay.&quot; <br/>
see, in her mind, they will even be behind in their stinking TIME <br/>
telling. I know this.<br/>
<br/>
anyway. I need some &quot;ammo&quot; just in case. Something that&#39;ll give me <br/>
what to say to an overbearing, nagging former school teacher who <br/>
still believes the schools have &quot;the way&quot; for teaching and learning.<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ooooh.<br/>
Sorry about that.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe carry a couple of photocopies of articles and if she brings it up,  say <br/>
in your most funereal, soft voice that you had intended to talk to her about  <br/>
that, and put the &quot;pamphlet&quot; gently in her hand with a sincere gaze and a <br/>
sqeeze  of her hand and nod your head twice and turn away dramatically.<br/>
 <br/>
(Not before the service, after.  All the way until you&#39;re in the  driveway <br/>
trying to leave.)<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d rehearse it with you if I were nearer.<br/>
 <br/>
This won&#39;t work every time, just memorial service times, so milk it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482566076">Its been almost that long for me too.<br/>
Partly due to the fact that we have too many pets to leave (darn...plus <br/>
for awhile there each time we all left for a vacation a pet would die or <br/>
disappear so....) and also I just cannot stand the way she treats my <br/>
poor FIL who has Alzheimer&#39;s. In her mind its all just something he&#39;s <br/>
doing on purpose to annoy her....<br/>
Its so sad...I adored my FIL.<br/>
He was a funny, intelligent, well read, honest to God Southern <br/>
Gentleman. So much fun to be around that I think I mourn his decent into <br/>
Alzheimer&#39;s as much as my husband does. He thought ds was the bees knees <br/>
and treated kids with so much respect.<br/>
I do not hate my MIL, but I do pity her. I&#39;ve never met (I&#39;ve known her <br/>
for more then 20 yrs) a more unhappy person in my life. She makes <br/>
everyone around her miserable (she has always been like this dh says) to <br/>
the point that none of her kids that live near-by want to visit.<br/>
It makes you wonder what her real story is....<br/>
I wonder if someday when she dies we&#39;ll discover old diaries from a <br/>
young woman who had dreams to go off somewhere and travel the world but <br/>
instead spent her life in a very small Kentucky town because she got <br/>
pregnant and had to marry a man who, though very wonderful, she did not <br/>
love. Or maybe there is some dark family secret from when she was young <br/>
that she has never gotten past....maybe my FIL was actually a <br/>
philandering husband who never gave her the love she needed but instead <br/>
held down a good job, provided well for her and helped her raise 4 great <br/>
sons. It could just be she wanted to work and was instead stuck by the <br/>
mores of the times at home.<br/>
 I feel a book coming on.<br/>
 I wish I could ask her, but she is the type to hold it all to her chest <br/>
and never &quot;talk&quot; about feelings and motivations. We&#39;ve never been able <br/>
to get her to attend support groups for caregivers, either....I guess <br/>
its too much for her to examine what&#39;s going on. Truly it probably falls <br/>
under the NOMB code, but it does so affect everyone around her.<br/>
sigh<br/>
I hope that the way we have changed our parenting and relationships due <br/>
to knowing about unschooling and freedom (see got it back on track) will <br/>
help us to be open if questions are asked or things pointed out as we <br/>
move through life.<br/>
Probably more info then ya&#39;ll needed....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595314408">My poor husband went up there one time with the kids, and it was non-<br/>
stop haranguing him about homeschooling, from everyone (he has six <br/>
brothers, counting the deceased) until he finally blew up. He shouted <br/>
at his mom, told his brothers to buzz off, said &quot;we&#39;ve made the <br/>
decision to homeschool, and that&#39;s that!&quot; and stormed off. <br/>
<br/>
There hasn&#39;t been AS MUCH since then, but...well, my mil is an <br/>
extremely strong willed, vociferous, opinionated, person. She isn&#39;t <br/>
evil. When I got sick with cellulitis and had to stay off my feet, <br/>
she came and took care of the house for three days. Not evil, but <br/>
extremely high stress, knows the right way to do things, and is not <br/>
afraid to tell you when you are NOT doing it her way/the right way. I <br/>
just dread it. That&#39;s why I posted this in March, for a May visit: I <br/>
need time to fortify myself, and for us to fortify OURselves, as a <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all the advice. I&#39;ll be casing the other unschooling <br/>
websites for ideas, and maybe it won&#39;t come up at all. I plan on <br/>
calling my sil&#39;s to see &quot;if there&#39;s anything I can bring? how can I <br/>
help?&quot; and make it a &quot;women helping the Mom and the brothers&quot; kind of <br/>
get together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107374242">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;anyway. I need some &quot;ammo&quot; just in case. Something that&#39;ll give me <br/>
what to say to an overbearing, nagging former school teacher who <br/>
still believes the schools have &quot;the way&quot; for teaching and learning.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My personal pick for anti-school literature is John Taylor Gatto. Since he<br/>
was an award winning public school teacher (in New York) at the time he<br/>
became disenchanted and began being very vocal in his critiques, he strikes<br/>
me as a good person to appeal to another teacher, credibility-wise. &quot;Dumbing<br/>
Us Down&quot; is short and probably more apropos than &quot;The Underground History<br/>
etc&quot;; I believe some of his articles such as &quot;The Hidden Curriculum&quot; are<br/>
available on line. Of course that is only half the story, but you have had<br/>
some other recommendations for the &quot;pro Home Schooling&quot; portion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434006466">I haven&#39;t been following this thread as I currently have more reading <br/>
material than I could possibly read before it&#39;s due back at the <br/>
library.  Anyhow, this post caught my attention in the mentioning of <br/>
Gatto&#39;s The Underground History of American Education.  I happen to <br/>
be reading it at the moment, and goes straight to my list of must <br/>
buys as I will never finish it w/o getting more library overdue <br/>
fines.  I just want to say, please do not let its size intimidate you <br/>
from diving in!  It is a great book, and his history of schooling is <br/>
extremely insightful.  He also goes into detail of many people&#39;s <br/>
lives who have helped shape history for better or worse.  I have also <br/>
read parts of his A Different Kind of Teacher and that was also very <br/>
interesting in a rough edged view of learning way.  I especially <br/>
appreciate his view on learning and schools from a teacher&#39;s point of <br/>
view.  This is something I appreciate about him and John Holt.  Very <br/>
influencial to the unschooling &#39;movement&#39; while first handedly <br/>
rejecting our schools.<br/>
<br/>
I know unschooling is not for everyone, and we will probably always <br/>
need schools, but they don&#39;t have to continue to exist the way they <br/>
do now.  <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, the list AlwaysUnschooled will be having a book <br/>

As an aside, the list AlwaysUnschooled will be having a book <br/>
discussion on Gatto&#39;s Dumbing Us Down in 2 or 3 months...<br/>
<br/>
==<br/>
<br/>
Actually, Gatto&#39;s NEXT month! We discuss books, beginning the fourth <br/>
Monday of the month very informally. At this moment, we seem to be <br/>
discussing two different books--Whole Child/ Whole Parent_ and _How to <br/>
Talk So Kids Will Listen_.<br/>
<br/>
AlwaysUnschooled is an email list geared towards Unschooling young <br/>
children, under age 8 or so. Members can access our book discussion list <br/>
by clicking on the &quot;Calendar&quot; link on the group webpage, then clicking <br/>
the tab &quot;Event Lists&quot; at the top of the calendar. That will bring up a <br/>
book discussion schedule through mid 2006! *lol*  We just keep adding <br/>
books we want to talk about.<br/>
