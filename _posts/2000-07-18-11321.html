<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404024141"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;what drew you to unschooling?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son-a very active learner. He&#39;s unable to tolerate sitting still for very<br/>
long.  Over the last year of schooling, the lessons he remembers best are<br/>
the ones in which we just talked-he asked tons of questions and I answered<br/>
them, or, if I couldn&#39;t, we looked it up together. Usually while we talked,<br/>
he ran circles around the house, careened across the kitchen floor on our<br/>
wheeled desk chair, or rolled on the carpet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to know from people who began as homeschoolers and &quot;morphed&quot; into<br/>
unschoolers: what was the toughest thing about changing?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ending my second year of homeschooling, and Seamus (7yob) has let me<br/>
know in no uncertain terms :-) he prefers unschooling.  He is an extremely<br/>
high energy child and reenergizes by interacting with others. Questions non<br/>
stop, always bouncing around and moving. Sit still and &quot;do homework&quot;!?<br/>
Nearly impossible, and quickly becoming unthinkable.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time keeping up with his energy levels. Regular homeschooling<br/>
is easier for me-but Seamus rarely gets fully engaged with this sort of<br/>
learning, so I&#39;ve been changing to meet his needs. It&#39;s tiring, but the<br/>
desire in me is there.  I&#39;m motivated to change every time I see him get<br/>
engaged in a sloppy unstructured &quot;lesson&quot;.  It&#39;s like a moment of zen, or an<br/>
epiphany, or the first time I ever ate Butter Toffee ice cream (mmm mmm mmm<br/>
good!).<br/>
<br/>
So for me, the hardest thing to overcome during my transition from<br/>
homeschooling to unschooling is constant drain on my energy level.<br/>
<br/>
What was the hardest thing for you-or was it a snap?  And do you have any<br/>
suggestions for me to get reenergized? (It doesn&#39;t help that my son is an<br/>
extrovert and I&#39;m an introvert.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It may be, given more time to adjust to unschooling, that you will find it <br/>
actually  less draining than structured homeschooling.  You will not need to <br/>
adhere to a stricter schedule, and you will not have to battle through a <br/>
purchased curriculum that may have topics uninteresting to your child.  For <br/>
example, a commercial reading series may have stories that bore your child, <br/>
but letting him help select books geared to his interest level will help to <br/>
hold his attention.  Also, you will not need to create a schedule where you <br/>
accomplish academics from 8 am to noon or whatever, each day.  You and your <br/>
child may find you function better and relate better when working on things <br/>
from , say, noon till 2:00, then break, then work on something later in the <br/>
day or evenings.  The point is that you have an abundance of freedom to make <br/>
your unique situation work for you and your family, and that it just takes <br/>
some time to find the &quot;right&quot; method  and schedule that suits you best.   I <br/>
think, too, that young children need lots of outdoor physical play.  My <br/>
oldest son will soon be 6, and he benefits from a lot of play in the <br/>
mornings.  We seem better suited, right now, to pursuing academic activities <br/>
later in the day; --right now, he is too busy doing his own personal thing in <br/>
the morning.  It suits me well, as I have 2 younger ones to keep up with , <br/>
too, and I am not usually just extremely energetic first thing in the <br/>
morning! :)  I&#39;m sure things will fall into place for you; just give it some <br/>
time.  ~Karen</div>

i&#39;m looking forward to unschooling my daughter this coming year... the only <br/>
apprehension that i have is that ****if**** she decides to go back for 8th <br/>
grade, that she won&#39;t be prepared... she has had no algebra to speak of and <br/>
her math skills are probably below average... <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Jeanne,  if it is any consolation, IF she decides to go back for 8th <br/>
grade, there will undoubtedly be other kids that have always been in ps, and <br/>
will have below average math skills.  While that may not make you feel <br/>
better, at least she would not be isolated in this, and chances are, too, she <br/>
could surprise you.  She could do better than you think at this time.  :)  <br/>

Or an answer key with totally ridiculous answers!  I hate this.  Those fill <br/>
in the blank work books.  I find that I have to be right there explaining the <br/>
answer that the book wants because the obvious answer is not given as an <br/>
option.  Then when we look and see what answer the &#39;experts&#39; were after it <br/>
makes no sense at all!  Not only does it drive me nuts, but my kid hates it <br/>
too...so, very few workbooks for us.  LOL  Talk about teaching to a test.  <br/>
geeze.  Can&#39;t even get the homework/practice exercises right if you can&#39;t <br/>
figure out what the author was thinking when they put that exercise together.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents worth...considering inflation, it may not be much!  BG<br/>

the ps system to assist her in matching the beat of the ps drum.   Don&#39;t <br/>
worry about it.  Be ready to assist when/if the time comes and there will be <br/>
adjustments.  But she will NOT be the only child in school that is &#39;behind&#39; <br/>
schedule.<br/>

When we lived in Florida we did a lot of water play outside - water gun and <br/>
ballon fights and pool time were big winners. We also danced to fun music <br/>
while enjoying the air conditioning. We learned new dances or just fooled <br/>
around. We also played balloon tennis with toy store rackets and a blown up <br/>
balloon, in a fairly empty room.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You may want to check out Barrons Guide to Arithmetic. Barnes and Noble has <br/>
it for around 15.00, I think (and they also give a 20% discount to hsers) It <br/>
goes from the very basics of addition and subtraction right on up. I like it <br/>
cause it has a pretest at the beginning of each chapter. If you ace it, then <br/>
you skip the chapter. If there is one section that you did poorly on, then <br/>
you just go over that part of the chapter. It makes it fairly easy to find <br/>
out where your child really is in math.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, but they have one for algebra too-it is different. I looked at it but <br/>
didn&#39;t buy it-it has a story approach, which I thought would be an <br/>
interesting way to teach it to those of us who are better with words than <br/>
numbers, but Megan chose a different book to try right before she left on <br/>
this last trip. If it works out I will let you all know. We have alot of <br/>
trouble with algebra here.<br/>
