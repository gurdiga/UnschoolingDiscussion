research shows that it is the one video game that is addictive to women<br/>
across the board. There has been a lot of money expended in research to find<br/>
more games that seem to reach the same place in women&#39;s minds as Tetris<br/>
does. Women typically do not get hooked into video games like males do and<br/>
the companies who make them would sure like to figure out why, as they can<br/>
only currently exploit 50% of the potential market. When I worked on Tetris<br/>
for months I was a total addict!!<br/>

<br/>
This is how I got hooked on video games!  When they first came out <br/>
we got the Nintendo.  I used to think that the time should be <br/>
limited, so I limited the kids to 30 min (I didn&#39;t think it was <br/>
healthy to sit for so long--yucky me!).  That was until I played for <br/>
the first time.  I sat down at 9 when the kids went to bed and the <br/>
next thing I knew, it was midnight!  That was the last time I <br/>
limited the game for them.<br/>
<br/>
I got hooked on Dr Mario and Tetris when we got the Super Nintendo.  <br/>
I also liked Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda because they <br/>
had so many secrets you had to figure out.  I don&#39;t think I could <br/>
get addicted to the newer games.  I don&#39;t like them anywhere near as <br/>
much as I liked the games for Super N.  They&#39;re trying so hard to <br/>
make the graphics great but I think they lost some of the pure dumb <br/>
fun that the old games had.<br/>
<br/>
Casey, I think if you want to get over your dislike of the games, <br/>
you should try playing them yourself.  Go to Blockbuster with your <br/>
kids and have them help you pick a game that you might like.  Then <br/>
you&#39;ll feel what the kids feel when they play.  Better, yet, try to <br/>
find an old Super N and some games at a second hand store.  <br/>

For me, it was Pokemon.  I always saw my kids watching other kids <br/>
play their Gameboys, and both Jake and Sam were so drawn to the <br/>
Pokemon characters that they&#39;d see on commercials, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
So for Christmas, without their even asking, I got them their first <br/>
Gameboy and Pokemon Red.  They weren&#39;t even interested in it when <br/>
they opened it Christmas morning.  It was the day after when I <br/>
said, &quot;Let&#39;s see what this does...&quot; when the game-lovers were born.<br/>
<br/>
And I played Pokemon so much back then, too!  Seemed like whenever <br/>
Dave would call from work and ask one of our children, &quot;What&#39;s Mom <br/>
doing?&quot; the answer would be, &quot;Playing Pokemon!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a really good idea.  My kids are doing it all the time for me <br/>
(with Neopets games, too).  I leave it to them to know what I might <br/>
like.  If I&#39;m drawn to something, I ask them about it, and they let <br/>
me know if they think I&#39;d like it or not (or if it would make me <br/>
motion-sick or not!).<br/>

Kirby&#39;s Avalanche is the SNES game of my dreams. <br/>
It&#39;s like Dr. Mario, but fancier.<br/>
<br/>
I like Dr. Mario for the 64 and the original.  We still have both.  All <br/>
those. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
We&#39;re a hands-on Nintendo museum here, though the current business is mostly <br/>

This is  the 21st century version of &quot;roughing it&quot;.<br/>

Heh.  I do rough it, but not when I have to drive 5 or 6 hours a day  and <br/>
sleep in a tent at night.  I like feelng safe and since it&#39;s only Will  and I, we <br/>
stay in KOAs when we are on the road.  So we will have  electricity and all <br/>
that goes with it!  All the comforts of home, except  air conditioning.  :)<br/>

&gt; I like Dr. Mario for the 64 and the original.  We still have both.  All <br/>
&gt; those. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re a hands-on Nintendo museum here, though the current business is mostly <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on Game Cube (current business being what Kirby and  Marty spend their video <br/>

year. Now there&#39;s a new thing on the market: a Tetris game controller that plugs <br/>
right into your TV, no sytem required. I think it comes in Space Invaders, too. <br/>
The Tetris one is on my Christmas wish list! It&#39;s only about $25.<br/>
