<div id="ygrps-yiv-822189519">So are everyone&#39;s kids just so into what the holidays brought them?<br/>
I hardly see or hear my kids these days. Okay not true, they just seem to be much more quiet!<br/>
<br/>
Tara of course is the same. Just enjoying her few last days of freedom from school. Work is finally back to normal and she has been getting home from there around 11:00. A nice change from the 1:00 a.m. time she was coming home. <br/>
<br/>
Joseph is so deep in Bionicles and Mega Bloks he can&#39;t see straight. I must admit I love them both. He seems to enjoy them so much more than the Lego stuff he asked for last year. He has been putting them all together himself so he&#39;s been very busy. His birthday is tomorrow and he has more Mega Bloks coming. He&#39;s into the dragon stuff. Joe also picked up a backgammon game which I had forgotten that Joseph was asking about. I&#39;m sure he enjoy playing that.<br/>
<br/>
All 3 little ones have also been enjoying Cadoo. Even Alyssa can play with them with a little help. <br/>
<br/>
Sierra is into her Care Bears. She likes the little ones on key chains. Barbie is also very big now too. She&#39;s starting to write also. My mom is showing her how. When Joseph, Joe and I came home yesterday, Sierra showed us a bunch of words she had written. She&#39;s doing names right now. I must say she&#39;s doing very well for never writing before. And my mom is enjoying &quot;teaching&quot; her. There&#39;s still a bit of school teacher in her after all these years. Luckily she&#39;s supportive of what we do and not pushy. <br/>
<br/>
Alyssa is knee deep in My Little Pony stuff. It&#39;s everywhere!!! She was so into the holidays this year it was just too cute. Now she&#39;s asking when her birthday is!! Poor thing has to wait until Oct. With Joseph&#39;s now and SIerra&#39;s in a few weeks, she&#39;s wishing hers was here too.<br/>
<br/>
And the scooters were a great gift. Joe is scouting for good places to ride and skate now that he&#39;s on wheels himself. <br/>
<br/>
For us, the holidays were crappy but the aftermath is wonderful!!!!<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Let&#39;s see, the wooden train set  has been the biggest hit. Harry (2) just loves to push the train around and Catherine puts on &#39;nature specials&#39; detailing the lives of the baby trains (the cars, the engines are the parents). We got a DVD player from my brothers and Jim Henson&#39;s Storyteller series (from my sister) on DVD and that has my daughter spellbound. Big cardboard block are a favourite and the magna doodle, marble run and trucks. The Barbies and Bratz doll were pretty much a flop...appreciated but forgotten though South African Princess Barbie is vewed with some wonder and was promoted to African Queen since she looked so much more regal than all the other princess Barbies with their pink ruffles. Oh yes, the walkie-talkies have been great fun!<br/>
  For the adults...Our LOTR Risk game is being taken out on a regular basis though I&#39;m geting tired of being beat. Catherine is dying to play it and takes it out to play with the figures so we have to work out some simpler rules for her.<br/>

costumes. TRAIN costumes &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
There is no video of it, yet - but they might enjoy the music and <br/>
costumes. Go to google and click on &quot;images&quot; and then put &quot;starlight <br/>
express&quot; in -- you&#39;ll find lots of pictures of the costumes.<br/>

in the house !! We love it also. Since reading here, our thoughts on games , <br/>
tv etc. have changed and the house is a happier place. We actually play the <br/>
games together a lot, and because  there is no limit on the games or tv, there <br/>
is no friction and the other toys get a lot of action as well.<br/>
The only thing we are having to work out is taking turns between watching <br/>
Finding Nemo and playing xbox. Obviously we are short of TVs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838662645">Well, not really. They are currently engrossed in Cartoon Network, which we found out our cable company now carries when we paid the bill at the office yesterday. Actually..right this very minute Logan is eating icecream pretending to be a dog and licking it up out of the bowl. <br/>
<br/>
Megan is helping herself to MY ice-cream. Sarah is the only one paying any attention to Cartoon Network. Apparently Animaniacs.<br/>
<br/>
But in general, the Christmas gifts were a big hit and they&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time with them...especially the Playdough!<br/>

The new passion of Julian&#39;s life is his new electric guitar. He got other <br/>
stuff he likes and has used, but he LOVES his guitar.<br/>
<br/>
I got a mountain dulcimer I am enjoying. My favorite present was a song <br/>
Julian wrote for me. I cried, then asked him to sing it again, and cried again. :)  <br/>
(We each make a gift for the others in the family. Then we open them <br/>
Christmas eve.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll share the lyrics later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629196046">My son is currently very into his wooden Thomas train set. He got some last <br/>
year and more items this year...more track and buildings!   We&#39;ve been making <br/>
fancy set-ups now including one that went all around the house living room, <br/>
dinidn room, kitchen in a big circle...he was so excited.  Then his little sister <br/>
woke up from her nap and it got taken apart. <br/>
He has also just discovered computer games and is learning how to use the <br/>
computer...this he asks to do all day but for now I am trying to limit it a <br/>
little bit (he&#39;s only 3 1/2).  He gets to use the computer while she is napping <br/>
otherwise, she grabs at the mouse, keyboard,etc and he can&#39;t concentrate to play.<br/>
The kids also got a large Little Tikes dollhouse complete with all of the <br/>
accessories (thank god for garage sales!) and they both really like it.  He&#39;s <br/>
been using the firetrucks to put our fires in the dollhouse!     <br/>
Happy New years!   Amanda<br/>

My son Logan (3) LOVES Thomas. We have a small setup of the blue tracked one that uses a battery. We also have a Thomas CDROM game, &quot;The Great Festival Adventure.&quot; <br/>
Logan wanted to use the computer like Sarah, but had NO interest in the Jumpstart Preschool which she had loved (the only one we had on that level, to teach how to use a mouse, etc). But we saw Thomas one day for $5 at Staples and bought it. He picked up how to play it really quickly and now I&#39;ll just let him put it in and go! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984802151">The kids got lots of Imaginext stuff here, which has been a huge hit even <br/>
with dh! They&#39;ve been setting up rival castles and battling. Too funny! <br/>
We&#39;ve had castle books out, and we&#39;re heading to the library tomorrow to <br/>
find some books on medieval weaponry. The castle has projectiles and the <br/>
knights all have several different weapons to choose from. (Another example <br/>
of my paradigm shift ;) )<br/>
<br/>
The computer games have been a really big hit, too, though the kids are <br/>
just as happy with the free Cubis game that dh downloaded as they are with <br/>
the castle and Rescue Heroes games.<br/>
