<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  How do you know if you are teaching them enough of the right and<br/>
&gt; important stuff?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen hundreds of kids who simply bypassed most or all of high<br/>
school, went directly to college, and were very successful.  It&#39;s not<br/>
that they did high school differently; it&#39;s that they simply didn&#39;t do<br/>
it.  Beyond the basics, I&#39;m not convinced that there&#39;s an list of<br/>
essential subjects that students must study before college.  I am<br/>
convinced that what&#39;s foundational are personal characteristics.  The<br/>
list of college readiness traits that appear to me to be most important<br/>
are confidence, curiosity, enthusiasm, capacity for wholehearted<br/>
engagement, ability to persevere, realistic self-knowledge, and a sense<br/>
of autonomy.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s just one of many stories I can relate:  	<br/>
<br/>
Alex spent his “high school” years living on the streets,<br/>
traveling, working as a staff reporter for Pacific News Service, and<br/>
reading.  He was briefly confined at Juvenile Hall, and while there he<br/>
made the contact that led to his job as a reporter.  Pacific News<br/>
Service sent Alex on a trip to Western Europe, the Balkans and Turkey.<br/>
He says, “The most important part of this trip...was my visit to<br/>
Sarajevo and my reporting project in Kosovo.  This gave me a new<br/>
understanding of a region so important to international relations and<br/>
added a new focus to my writing career.  I saw such intense stories in a<br/>
region torn apart by war and realized that wartime reporting was the<br/>
focus that I wanted to take.”<br/>
<br/>
Alex wants to earn a Ph.D. in political science and chose Columbia<br/>
University as his first-choice school.  He applied and was rejected, but<br/>
he was also encouraged to complete some coursework and apply again.  He<br/>
attended a full year of classes as a non-matriculated student at UC<br/>
Berkeley, re-applied, and was accepted.  He was also accepted by Reed<br/>
College.<br/>
<br/>
Alex began his studies at Columbia in the fall of 2002.  He had gained<br/>
admission without any credit––zero––for high-school-level studies; his<br/>
coursework at Berkeley included no science, and in math he completed<br/>
just a one-unit refresher course in algebra and trigonometry and a<br/>
class in statistics.  The reading he did while on the streets was <br/>
mostly in<br/>
political science, international affairs, history, philosophy, and <br/>
economics, and his<br/>
focus at Berkeley was in these areas also.<br/>
