 I&#39;m sorry that people have been so abused<br/>
&gt; that any kind of spanking constitutes violence to them.<br/>
<br/>
I was NEVER abused and I feel that any kind of hitting is violent. Blanket<br/>
statements can be hurtful. </span></blockquote></div>

spanking/hitting is the same action....maybe with different intent.....<br/>

It is a mistake to assume that those who consider spanking to be violent were <br/>
abused.  This would imply that those who hold this convection have had their <br/>
judgment impaied somehow.  I was not abused, had wonderful parents and was <br/>
raised in a healthy and functional household.  I consider spanking to be an <br/>
act of violence and domination.  I do not come to this conclusion because I <br/>
am unable to reason coherently due to abuse in my childhood.<br/>
