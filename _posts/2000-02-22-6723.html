<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545285714">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m so far behind on messages but i wanted to make a comment.  when i<br/>
was in college i minored in education.  one classes i took was called<br/>
pyschopedigogics (sp) and i think the basis of this philosophy is<br/>
pertinent to unschooling.  the core concept is one of &#39;bringing [a<br/>
child] to adulthood&#39; and it is seen that to do this one must balance 3<br/>
components: trust, understanding and authority.  so if a problem arises<br/>
it is because one (or more) of these is being neglected or abused.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve used this as a foundation, a kind of philosophical safety net,<br/>
particularly for those bad days when all that &#39;training&#39; and &#39;role<br/>
modeling&#39; rears it ugly little head threatening our happy home:)<br/>
rene&#39;, who is 4, is very independent, he backs down to no one (at park<br/>
days he has butted heads with boys more than twice his age  and twice<br/>
his size (who are bullying him and others) - he has a keen sense of<br/>
injustice and will fight anyone&#39;s battles) in fact arguing happens to be<br/>
one of his favorite sports and will always provide him with a good<br/>
laugh:)   that&#39;s just the kind of person he is, a leader type with a<br/>
strong independent mind who wants his voice to be heard- which i both<br/>
like and drives me crazy:)  he will accept nothing on face value which<br/>
as an adult will serve him well, but as a parent to him i must back up<br/>
everything i say and do- so i fall back on the importance of<br/>
understanding him as being paramount instead of wanting him to &#39;just be<br/>
obedient&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
when i make understanding him vital, he seems to relax more and<br/>
naturally trust me.  i believe it&#39;s because of this trust that he is<br/>
able to respect my authority on issues that our outside his control<br/>
(i.e. you must brush your teeth or don&#39;t throw the ball at the windows<br/>
or in the house for that matter &lt;g&gt;).  i truly believe the more i make<br/>
honest efforts to understand him, the more he trusts me, the more he<br/>
respects my authority.  i also believe this will pave the way for a ease<br/>
of transition for him to accept more and more authority over his own<br/>
life creating an environment where what was once a dynamic between<br/>
parent and child will then be fully internalized i.e. rene&#39; will embody<br/>
this balance of trust understanding and authority within himself,<br/>
giving him the skills to be an independent adult.<br/>
<br/>
i would be curious what other think about this idea of balancing these 3<br/>
components.  it seems to work for rene&#39; but would it work for someone of<br/>
a different personality?   i&#39;m wondering just how broad a scope this<br/>
philosophy  might cover.<br/>
<br/>
just some thoughts<br/>

Susan,<br/>
I agree with you.  I think that&#39;s one of our hardest jobs as parents and <br/>
unschoolers.  I have found, time after time, that the more I relax and really <br/>
listen to my boys, the more they will listen to me, and the more motivated <br/>
they will be.  It&#39;s as if they feel free to do more if they feel that I trust <br/>
them.  It&#39;s a hard lesson for me to learn, especially on days when they just <br/>
want to vegetate.  My years of public education creep up on me then and push <br/>
my panic button.  I find myself scheming to get them interested and busy with <br/>
something.  sigh...  When will I learn?  Balance is crucial.  They have to <br/>
feel that I trust them, but at the same time they need the security of <br/>
knowing that I am the authority.  When they constantly test me and push the <br/>
limits, it usually means that I&#39;ve been overbearing and need to relax a bit.  <br/>
Of course then I always feel like such a dope!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911812467">hi,<br/>
<br/>
for me this does get a bit gray.  i do agree with candice that preventing<br/>
unnecessary pain and damage is a big motivation for certain demands.  my<br/>
experience is that even though i&#39;m a much more demanding person than my dh,<br/>
who overall is a pretty &#39;go with the flow&#39; kind of guy, i tend to be a bit<br/>
less demanding in terms of his rene&#39;s behavior and my hd is a bit more<br/>
impatient with the &#39;bad behavior&#39; issues and they fight a lot more.   they<br/>
have a lot more power struggles, than rene&#39; and i do.<br/>
<br/>
i found this very interesting because even though i&#39;m less demanding<br/>
overall when i do &#39;lay down the law&#39;, particularly in terms of personally<br/>
boundaries and things i feel are really important like areas of safety,<br/>
rene&#39; responds much better to me than his dad.  but i&#39;m also the one who<br/>
really listens to him and finds out why he wants or does something.  for<br/>
example rene&#39; really wants a gameboy color and without any discussion dh<br/>
says: &#39;no way&#39;, which sparked a royal fit from rene&#39;.  i stepped in, got<br/>
him to calm down and ask him why he wanted one.  we discuss the cost of the<br/>
game itself plus all the cartridges,  we check out, online, all the<br/>
different machines available (sega, sony etc.) the cost each one and what<br/>
games are played on which machines.   then i told him what my concerns are<br/>
about buying him one etc.  we have yet to buy one though he still wants one<br/>
and periodically asks (or should i say &#39;reminds&#39; us) but he also feels<br/>
heard and his position is respected so no more fits and its been about 6<br/>
months.  now this didn&#39;t happen in a day it took a good month of talking<br/>
and frustrating visits to park day, where the older kids had them and<br/>
didn&#39;t share, but after that his &#39;obsession&#39; has progressively lessened.<br/>
<br/>
another example i have which has to do with math:  rene&#39; happens to love it<br/>
(mind you he is only 4) and we have a math cd-rom by dk &#39;counting and<br/>
sorting&#39;.  anyway he wanted to get mega math blaster and i said sure when<br/>
you finish all the levels of the other cd.  he agreed and sat down and<br/>
within an hour he hated math, was angry and frustrated and i realized in a<br/>
moment i had destroyed his natural love for math and turned what use to be<br/>
fun into &#39;work&#39;.  so we bought him the other cd.  he now plays both and<br/>
loves math again.  i&#39;m not suggestion to buy anything or give in to every<br/>
demand but i just think there is a way to honor both you and your values<br/>
without shutting your kids desires out.  like what kim said about trusting<br/>
in your kids as having some reason for doing what they&#39;re doing even if it<br/>
appears to us as a &#39;waste of time&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
i think love of learning and curiosity are what should be fostered not<br/>
particular skills.   i know that skills are or can be useful but math is so<br/>
versatile can&#39;t you set up a situation to have your kids learn in a context<br/>
they find interesting.  i&#39;m certainly not the one to give any advise<br/>
because i&#39;ve not had to cross that bridge, at least from the parents<br/>
perspective:) but i have learned when you take the fun out and remove the<br/>
free will, you deny the kids the wonderful opportunity of discovery as well<br/>
as the joy of cooperation and choice.  i don&#39;t know if this is the kind of<br/>
thing you&#39;re talking about but if it is there is a book i would recommend<br/>
giving the love that heals by harville hendrix & helen hunt.  a central<br/>
theme in this book is validation something i thing is very important to<br/>
everyone and especially our kids.  it&#39;s well worth the read<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want them learning lessons that will be costly or cause real damage <br/>
to something or someone. Just like I don&#39;t let them learn about hot stoves by <br/>
touching one, or how hard black ink is to paint over by writing on my walls. <br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling means I have to abdicate all authority or give up <br/>
on trying to impart some of the benefit of my own experience. I would let <br/>
them get a mentor to learn a skill. I consider myself to be a mentor for life <br/>
skills - a mentor who, along with dh, has the ultimate authority in our <br/>
house. I won&#39;t insist on flashcards, but I will expect that somehow, at some <br/>
point, they will learn their math facts. I just try to help them make it <br/>
relevant and enjoyable. Some lessons are too immediate for me to take that <br/>
tact.<br/>

<br/>
I think this is really key, but dh thinks it&#39;s mostly optional. He&#39;s still <br/>
very much aligned with &quot;It was good enough for me.&quot; and &quot;Because I say so.&quot; I <br/>
think these are valid arguements at times, but only rarely. I do spend a lot <br/>
of time trying to understand the kids, especially since they are a part of a <br/>
patchwork family and have to deal with different lifestyles in different <br/>
homes.<br/>

<br/>
I have done this SO many times.Instead of letting dd jump into something new <br/>
and exciting I&#39;ve used the &quot;Sure, but first do this&quot; line and robbed it of <br/>
all the excitement. Usually it&#39;s been in math as well. Most of the time I&#39;ve <br/>
been able to back track and take the pressure off, but not always.<br/>
<br/>
But hey, as my mother recently reminded me, I&#39;m not perfect.<br/>
