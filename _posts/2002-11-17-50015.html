<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965493834">One of the joys of my life was when the homeschooling forum on AOL was HUGE, <br/>
busy, amazingly expanding and changing lives all over the world.<br/>
<br/>
But the sparkliest times were when some of those who were openly hostile <br/>
about unschooling, who continuously came in after one of us said something <br/>
and tried to break the spell by saying something like &quot;This isn&#39;t going to <br/>
work for all families; unschoolers are very radical.  Unit studies will be <br/>
fine.&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...<br/>
invariably (and I thought about toning down &quot;invariably,&quot; but I think <br/>
invariably is the word to use) when there was a REAL question about something <br/>
in the real world, they would come over to the unschooling folder and ask us <br/>
if we knew.<br/>
<br/>
INVARIABLY someone knew right off the top of their heads or they would look <br/>
it up and transcribe, if they had to, the information, with references. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
(That was pre-google.com; imagine!)<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
When the discussion was how to make kids do schoolwork, they considered us <br/>
retards, and said so (in other words, but not other thoughts).<br/>
When the question was about something real, they thought we would know, or <br/>
know how to find out.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe that&#39;s why they couldn&#39;t unschool.<br/>

Well, we&#39;re smart and funny and some of us are musical (not me), but if<br/>
one is looking for a new foreman for the chain gang, we ain&#39;t go the<br/>
stuff.  We don&#39;t have that particular, whip-cracking management talent.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
