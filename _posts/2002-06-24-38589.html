<div id="ygrps-yiv-205294216">Hi All!  Tammy & Alaura  -- Sorry it&#39;s taken me all week to get back to <br/>
you.  I&#39;ve been involved in early childhood ed for the past 10 years. <br/>
 The first two I worked for a parks and rec dept. as a children&#39;s <br/>
program instructor and coordinator.  When we moved to Virginia 8 years <br/>
ago, I began my family child care business.  I enjoy the freedom of <br/>
setting up and running my own program, plus it allows me to be at home <br/>
with my two children.<br/>
<br/>
Tammy,  I saw your post about the disappointing homeschooling <br/>
conference.  I helped organize the VHEA conference that Alaura referred <br/>
to on the unschooling list.  VHEA is inclusive though  I think most <br/>
people who are involved with VHEA are either eclectic, relaxed, or <br/>
completely unschool.  There are some who are more structured, but the <br/>
structured folks I&#39;ve met at VHEA seem less rigid than the hs&#39;ers I&#39;ve <br/>
met who go to the HEAV conference.  (How&#39;s that for a sweeping <br/>
generalization?) <br/>
<br/>
The South Carolina conference looks like a lot of fun -- and very <br/>
well-organized too, Kelly.  I can see all the work you&#39;ve put into it <br/>
just by looking at the website.  Perhaps the finance fairy will pay me <br/>
beneficial visit so we can attend.  (We&#39;ve already blown our conference <br/>
attendance budget for the year.)  <br/>
 <br/>
One friend of mine referred to unschooling as a spectrum -- and we&#39;re <br/>
all at various stages along the spectrum.  It seems eclectic is the <br/>
catch-all category.  I&#39;ve met many structured homeschoolers who want to <br/>
explore unschooling, yet they can&#39;t plunge right in.  They need to <br/>
&quot;relax&quot; first.  After they&#39;ve &quot;relaxed&quot; they tend to reach for <br/>
&quot;eclectic.&quot;   The evolution is complete with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m not so sure if I&#39;m as much an unschooler as I am as much <br/>
one who is still in the process of deschooling.  (My son deschooled <br/>
faster than I have.)  I am just very glad that I did not start from the <br/>
school-at-home/purchased curriculum.  I am grateful for the wise heads <br/>
who advised me to deschool before deciding which path to take. <br/>
Unschooling just naturally fell into place --- not that it&#39;s any less <br/>
work.  It&#39;s a constant challenge, but it&#39;s a fun challenge.   <br/>
<br/>
Alaura, I&#39;m in the Fredericksburg,VA area -- where are you?<br/>
