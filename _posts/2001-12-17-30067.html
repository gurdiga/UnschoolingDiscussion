&gt;them.  They truly are heroes.  They saved my boy&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see it from a different angle as far as research. But hopefully they <br/>
conventional ways will come full circle and catch up to the other great <br/>
research that is going on, and also in practice, throughout the world. <br/>
And yes, stem cell research is important!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My 2 boys are the reasons why I support stem-cell research.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[snipped out of order because below is a controversial and scary rant]<br/>
<br/>
Mimi, you are truly blessed for having the courage to keep up a great <br/>
attitude. If you ever wish to hear about how alternate therapys (sorry, <br/>
its all out of the US though), then please email me offline.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;A mild virus triggered it&#39;s onset.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, you can flame me from here until then end of time, but &#39;This is the <br/>
most important sentence right now that anyone can read.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
There is research that is going on that is not available to the public. <br/>
Research from the people in high level clearence only of the CDC and WHO, <br/>
and private scientists that are aware.<br/>
<br/>
We are currently inundated with low level virus that is triggering more <br/>
and more onset disease and speeding up current disease.  Whether these <br/>
virus&#39; (or is it virii) are mademade or have developed naturally (the <br/>
rise and fall of naturally occuring plagues) is irrevelent. It&#39;s the fact <br/>
that this just might lead to a major plague and then subside is the part <br/>
that these people are interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen myself go from nothing, I mean *nothing* in my breast (I just <br/>
had a mammography done in September) to a full grown, rooted to the back <br/>
and spine, malignant breast tumor in just 6 weeks by being constantly <br/>
exposed to these virii.<br/>
<br/>
There is a certain, and extremely expensive, test that a municipality can <br/>
order to test for these virii in the water system. Most of them won&#39;t or <br/>
are of the belief that anything the federal goverment tells them is <br/>
gospel. NYC refuted the evidence that would compel them to do the testing.<br/>
<br/>
I have nothing to gain by posting this. I have lots to lose (beyond the <br/>
flaming) - I post because I feel compelled to share this in case just <br/>
even one person wants to pursue how to help themselves or their children.<br/>
<br/>
Hasn&#39;t anyone questioned as to WHY the news keeps talking about impending <br/>
&#39;smallpox&#39; when the CDC swears it was irraticated by 1977? Has anyone <br/>
questioned why they feel the hospitals are doing plague training all of a <br/>
sudden?<br/>
<br/>
Please anyone reading this far, if you don&#39;t want to beleive, then close <br/>
the window and this subject will be closed. I don&#39;t wish to debate <br/>
something I&#39;ve seen in action. And I don&#39;t have one of the scientists <br/>
handy when I sit down to do my email.<br/>

&gt;plague training is that they fear the terrorists have them and will use them.<br/>
&gt;Tia<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Its possible *terrorists* have them, I&#39;m not sure how probable. The <br/>
WHO was pretty emphatic about it not existing - and they held that beleif <br/>
for years and years.<br/>
<br/>
The smallpox scare was put into action before 9/11 (also the anniversay <br/>
of the Balfour treaty for those that want to understand the tragedy <br/>
better).<br/>
<br/>
A few WHO ex-researchers were contacted long before and asked if they <br/>
were researching specifically Anthrax, Smallpox and any other plagues. A <br/>
NYC hospital was trained to watch out for the above (Elmhurt Hospital) <br/>
long before that infamous day. Most likely other hospitals in metro areas <br/>
were asked to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to get into *conspiracys* UGH! what a word.. I don&#39;t like to <br/>
look deeper into a situation and speculate on what could be just really <br/>
bad communication... BUT these darn things keep coming to my face.. and I <br/>
keep saying.. why? oh why?<br/>
<br/>
History shows that disease rise and fall in natural progression. Every 90 <br/>
years or so. Its possible that we&#39;re approaching the rise part, before <br/>
the fall - and that most vaccinations,  most antibiotics and the ilk will <br/>
be exposed to be band-aids that Western science has grasped at.<br/>
<br/>
Can it be possible that *bio-terrorism* can be used as an excuse to <br/>
cover-up a lot of ills that allopathic medical researchers have been <br/>
hiding for years? I hate to think so.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to beleive that this research is done with malintentions. I <br/>
feel the people that come up with these *advances* are truly trying to <br/>
help. I see flaws in their testing methodology and their basic principles.<br/>
<br/>
When I had uterine cancer at age 24 and was told I would never had kids.. <br/>
I was lucky enough to have been introduced to alternate therapys <br/>
(Revit-organ, a type of stem cell therapy). If I had chose conventional <br/>
methods, I would not have had my son.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me stop here and say that I am just a vessel of trivia, facts <br/>
presented, and experience of *quackery* by sheer accident. I have not <br/>
done anything so grandiose in my life that warrants me standing on a <br/>
soapbox.<br/>
<br/>
Playboy did a great series of articles called &#39;Medical Genocide&#39; in the <br/>
80s. If anyone wants to start somewhere thats a good place. Although a <br/>
lot of what was offered as alternate therapy is no longer valid because <br/>
of this rise in dangerous viruses.<br/>
<br/>
There was a book called &#39;Hidden Killers&#39;. It explained it extremely well. <br/>
Unfortunately I lent it out and haven&#39;t been able to find it since. I <br/>
bought it in England and never seen it since (even on the internet). <br/>
<br/>
My only gift is that of being able to talk or write. I can share my <br/>
experiences and people can decide for themselves what they choose.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011263427">The problem with books that &quot;tell it like it is&quot; is that they conveniently<br/>
have a way of &quot;disappearing&quot; or being &quot;killed.&quot;  Another such book that you<br/>
can occasionally find on the net is &quot;Diet for a Poisoned Planet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As to the hospitals, they have been doing triage training and doing mock<br/>
disasters, including nuclear war and plague since at least the 70s when I<br/>
worked at a hospital in mid-sized town in CA (pop. 90,000).  The feds (CDC<br/>
and regulatory agencies) even come in and test them on their responses.<br/>
<br/>
As to all the vaccinations that are wandering around.  There have been<br/>
several outbreaks in vaccinated populations.  One of the major ones was here<br/>
in CA, specifically in the Bay Area about 2 or 3 years ago of whooping<br/>
cough.<br/>
<br/>
IMNSHO &lt;g&gt;  I think the current, and as far as that goes most of the &quot;new&quot;<br/>
vaccines, push about smallpox (which you are right started before 9/11) is<br/>
all about making money for pharmeceutical companies!  If they create a panic<br/>
and then they say there are limited numbers of the vaccine, they jack the<br/>
prices through the roof and no one complains.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the BILLIONS they made on Hep B!  I mean, really, even the CDC says<br/>
that the target population for the vaccine is IV drug users,<br/>
homosexuals/heterosexuals with multiple partners and health care workers.<br/>
Precisely how many new born babies fit that criteria?  Yet hospitals are<br/>
sticking new borns faster than they stick the parents with an outrageous<br/>
bill for it!<br/>

WW1 - and it called for the establishment of a Zionist state in Palestine.<br/>
At the time the British government needed support from the Zionists and<br/>
Balfour was the Foreign Secretary at the time - I believe it was under<br/>
Lloyd George as Prime Minister.  It set the stage for the League of<br/>
Nations mandate which gave control of Palestine to the Brits at the<br/>
end of WW1.<br/>
