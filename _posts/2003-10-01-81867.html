<div id="ygrps-yiv-929632517">Wow.<br/>
I just read the are we having fun now article and I am stunned.<br/>
Previously I have kept my opinions to myself in this thread b/c I tend to<br/>
get my feelings hurt and b/c there doesn&#39;t seem to be any point in entering<br/>
a discussion (not here- but the broader discussion, nationally) where the<br/>
speakers have already made up their minds.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me, though, that my voice, and those like mine, are the ones<br/>
missing from this exchange.  So - here goes.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Christian.  I fell in love with God as a small child and relied on<br/>
Him through a *very* difficult childhood. When I was about 12 I responded to<br/>
the teaching of the gospel ( the receive-<br/>
Christs-forgivness-of-my-sins-and-commit-to-following-Him variety) at a<br/>
local church.  In the years that followed  I left the religion of my family<br/>
(they weren&#39;t that religious anyway) and have always attended churches where<br/>
I sensed the Holy Spirit, I read the Bible, prayed, and tried to live in a<br/>
way that would honor God. My husband and I are very involved in our church<br/>
(presently a Friends church) I love Jesus.  I feel I owe HIm everything and<br/>
I know He loves not only me but every person I run across.  This belief<br/>
informs almost every aspect of my life.  As you might imagine, It is an<br/>
intricate and sometimes difficult path.  I expect to spend a lifetime<br/>
learning how to love others as Christ loves them and in case you smell an<br/>
aggrandized complex of some sort - yes I know my attempts are baby steps.<br/>
<br/>
OK now you know more about me than I know about you so here&#39;s the punch<br/>
line.<br/>
<br/>
I am an unabashed unschooler.  No really.  I have no conflict about this<br/>
because I want my children to discover their own reliance on Jesus for their<br/>
lives and not just do as they&#39;re told.  I believe a faith that is based on<br/>
doing what your parents make you do is no faith at all. ( As I write this<br/>
their choices are playing Super smash bros. melee on the game cube and<br/>
watching episodes of the Simpsons on DVD).  But they also often choose to<br/>
hear Bible stories, pray, and sing praise songs.<br/>
<br/>
Do I share my beliefs with them?  Of course.  My dh and I pray with and for<br/>
each of them, we teach them the precepts of our beliefs and scriptures that<br/>
we feel will help them in their lives.  We also make sure they know about<br/>
other religions and ideas.  They have friends who&#39;s families are Catholic<br/>
and Protestant, Orthodox, Mormon, Muslim, Ba&#39;hai, Pagan and in the words of<br/>
one sweet child we know &quot;all mixed up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As for the claims in the article, I couldn&#39;t disagree more.  It smells like<br/>
manipulation to me and not like the loving Spirit led instruction I would<br/>
expect from my own church.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I would not say so much about my faith in this forum bc I know<br/>
that&#39;s not what you read this list for.  I just wanted you to understand<br/>
that unschooling is not unchristian though the lifestyle in a Christian home<br/>
is going to look different than that in a muslim, or pagan or whatever. Our<br/>
lifestyle  may look a bit different from yours but the underlying messages I<br/>
find in Holt and with other unschoolers are very much in line with the love<br/>
for people, including children, and respect for his creation (including you)<br/>
thatI am called to uphold as a follower of Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to entertain comments about unschooling here.  If you have<br/>
religious questions or comments for me better give them to me off list.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199065982">Same here, Krisula.  Unschooling resonates in complete harmony with my<br/>
faith.  I am also well acquainted with the way many &quot;conservative,<br/>
fundamentalist&quot; Christians think.  I have known quite a few who thought I<br/>
was leading my kids down the path to damnation.  It seems common to those<br/>
who&#39;s Christianity is based on politics more than on heart.<br/>
<br/>
My main motivation to home school was to protect my children&#39;s ability to<br/>
think for themselves, unschooling seemed to be the perfection of that goal.<br/>
I want their faith to be based on attraction, liking what they see in my<br/>
life and my relationship with God.  If that isn&#39;t enough I certainly don&#39;t<br/>
want them buying in because they are afraid.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of Christians ask me how I can be the authority without rules,<br/>
this opens a chance for me to illustrate how Jesus calls us friends and how<br/>
that relationship is based on respect, care and seeking happiness and peace<br/>
for those you love.  It all fits perfectly but it&#39;s hard for those living in<br/>
the circles they do to let go and change their views.<br/>

sounds like you aren&#39;t a part of the Christian group being discussed here<br/>
who believe that it *is* unchristian.  I always enjoy hearing from the kind<br/>
of Christians who are living it in their own lives but accepting and<br/>
open-minded about the faiths of others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143973470">Krisula, <br/>
Thank you for an absolutely marvelous post.   I  have been just randomly picking maybe 1 in 30 of what comes through lest I spend 12 hours a day glued to the monitor.   <br/>
I am sooooooo   glad I landed on yours. <br/>
<br/>
Your love for Jesus shines through as well as love for  the diversity of all creation.    In my opinion you are providing a very healthy and loving religious environment for your children. <br/>
