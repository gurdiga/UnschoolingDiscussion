Someone without kids is going to withhold movies from a kid until said kid <br/>

People fantasize the darndest child-rearing things!<br/>
**************************************<br/>
My best friend and I had babies almost simultaneously (her son is four days <br/>
younger than mine). When they were little...well under two... we all went out <br/>
to lunch at a nice-ish restaurant with a couple who were good friends of ours. <br/>
They had recently married and had no children. Except for us, the restuarant <br/>
was mostly empty.<br/>
<br/>
The boys were basically fine, but little. They giggled and occasionally <br/>
yelped and did other baby stuff. Melissa said something about how she hoped they <br/>
weren&#39;t bothering our friends, and that&#39;s just how babies are. And Nancy smiled <br/>
and said something about how her kids wouldn&#39;t be. Pablo agreed.<br/>
<br/>
We both found it so hilarious and naive that we weren&#39;t offended. We just all <br/>
thought, &quot;Wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s just say that her children can be a bit...challenging.<br/>
