My comment was to ward off a flame war which is what usually happens when<br/>
someone mentions hitting children &quot;until their hands hurt&quot; or using objects<br/>
to hit them with.  This is an area in which very strong opinions are held<br/>
and lots of folks get very defensive.  <br/>
<br/>
As someone who has worked in hospitals and seen more than my fair share of<br/>
child abuse cases, I don&#39;t care to &quot;talk about being violent to children.&quot; <br/>
And, as a mandated reported, I don&#39;t like reading about it either as it<br/>
places one in a precarious position.<br/>
