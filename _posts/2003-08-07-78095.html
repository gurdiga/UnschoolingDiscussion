Are you from Salt Lake City!?<br/>

That&#39;s the most nonsensical &quot;swearing,&quot; and I&#39;ve only heard it in and from <br/>
Utah.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cute, especially coming from a blonde little Mormon teen who is using <br/>
the worst language she can muster.<br/>

It was the favorite dirty word of a friend  of mine in the days we were<br/>
sixteen and hitchhiking around and just plain foolish.  She was a good<br/>
Mormon girl.  She took her bible everywhere, and tucked inside, her<br/>
little bag of smoke. <br/>
<br/>
We celebrated thirty years of friendship this summer, five of us.  No<br/>
longer hitchhiking, smoking or &quot;my heck&quot; ing.  (until today.)   <br/>
