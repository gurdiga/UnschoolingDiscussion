<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009044991">People leave the list all the time (and even more join, and  some change <br/>
their e-mail addresses and stay on the list as ghostly  members).  When people <br/>
unsubscribe, they get an automatically-sent  questionnaire that Pam Sorooshian <br/>
designed (maybe because she&#39;s got that  statistician thang going &lt;g&gt;) and some <br/>
respond and most don&#39;t.  <br/>
 <br/>
No problem.  <br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday the list was pretty quiet, but I posted the link to the new  <br/>
improved &quot;saying yes&quot; page, and a couple of people left.  <br/>
 <br/>
No problem.<br/>
 <br/>
I want to use it as a springboard to talk about the difference between  <br/>
unschooling as it&#39;s discussed here and the simple absence of school or  <br/>
school-at-home.   There are people who say anyone who&#39;s homeschooling  and not using a <br/>
curriculum is unschooling.  I don&#39;t know of an English  speaking country in <br/>
which it&#39;s not their legal right to say what they want about  such things.  I also <br/>
don&#39;t know an English speaking country (nor any other)  in which just living <br/>
without a curriculum and changing nothing else in one&#39;s  life is going to be a <br/>
sustainable (nor even nearly legal) model of what any  government in any <br/>
language thinks is acceptable parenting or &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
But I&#39;m getting philosophical.   <br/>
And I have to.<br/>
You can&#39;t scratch unschooling without hitting philosophy.<br/>
By philosophy I don&#39;t mean reading Socrates and Descarte.  I mean  <br/>
considering how things work and how, and what is meant by &quot;parenting,&quot; and what  is, can <br/>
be, and should be expected of children and adults,and how far one can  <br/>
stretch the prevailing expectations and whether and how children can be treated  as <br/>
their full, whole selves even from birth rather than as grubs without reality  <br/>
or status until they &quot;earn it&#39; or &quot;mature&quot; or &quot;become adults.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
That is all philosophy: the idea of &quot;ideas.&quot;  The thinking about  thinking.<br/>
 <br/>
The idea of who says yes and who says no, and when, and why, and  how--that&#39;s <br/>
philosophy.  Who owns what and whom?  What are the rights  of a human?   <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s one thing to read what some old academic coot finally wrote at  age 60 <br/>
about the rights of man, but it&#39;s another to decide and then allow  and assist <br/>
a three year old to exercise some rights today, May 29, 2005, without  <br/>
permission of academic or political or medical personnel.<br/>
 <br/>
By the luggage carousel at the Sacramento airport (the old one, or a  smaller <br/>
one, not by the really cool luggage art), Pat Farenga  told me that once he <br/>
was spoke to a HUGE room at a state convention in the SE  U.S. and there were <br/>
maybe 2000 people, and that was less than half of the  attendees at the <br/>
convention.  Huge.  He was talking about the  importance of giving kids choices, and <br/>
how it works for them to learn from their  interests (regular unschooling <br/>
philosophy) and when he said something to the  effect of &quot;kids need to be able to <br/>
say no,&quot; half of those people stood up and  walked out of that room.<br/>
 <br/>
That was an easily-gathered convention of people who do not believe that  <br/>
children should be able to say no.  And conversely I&#39;m confident they DO  think <br/>
parents should say &quot;no,&quot; early and often, and back it up with a stick or a  <br/>
belt (or other &quot;consequences&quot;).  In their cases, because their  priority is to <br/>
please religious authorities who say they are pleasing God, they  should (within <br/>
their philosophy) say no.<br/>
 <br/>
I should, within my philosophy, say yes.<br/>
 <br/>
People who don&#39;t have  a philosophy don&#39;t know when to say yes or  no.  And I <br/>
guess some want others to tell them what to do without bothering  with why, <br/>
or what the considerations are one way or another.  Parenting  books are FULL <br/>
of &quot;do this and then that and your child will...&quot; sleep all  night,  or be <br/>
exactly average on weight charts, or make good grades.<br/>
 <br/>
A guy asked me years ago (in a hostile way, in an online chat) &quot;Are you  <br/>
willing to risk your child&#39;s future on your &#39;theories&#39;?&quot;   Yes, I  am.  As was he. <br/>
 Even if one&#39;s theory is that it&#39;s okay not to have a  theory, that&#39;s a <br/>
belief upon when they&#39;re acting.  They&#39;re living out of  their peripheral vision, <br/>
doing what it seems the neighbors are doing.   Why?  Because the neighbors are <br/>
doing it.  They take the voices in  their head as experts and authorities, and <br/>
they just skim the surface of their  internal feedback, and the first <br/>
grandmother or cranky aunt whose ghostly voice  from childhood comes forth with some <br/>
gem of traditional family &quot;wisdom&quot; like  &quot;you don&#39;t need another one,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;you&#39;re too little&quot; or &quot;get down from there or  you&#39;ll break your neck&quot; or &quot;put <br/>
that stick down before you poke somebody&#39;s eye  out,&quot; THAT passes for belief and <br/>
philosophy; the parent repeats the message and  feels virtuously parental.  <br/>
 <br/>
For those whose philosophy of the season involves &quot;The Force,&quot; think of  <br/>
Darth Grandma breathing softly into a father&#39;s ear &quot;He doesn&#39;t need to play  video <br/>
games&quot; and the father repeating parrotically &quot;You don&#39;t need to play video  <br/>
games.&quot;  &quot;He needs to go to bed now.&quot;  &quot;You  need to go to bed  now.&quot;    The <br/>
father isn&#39;t thinking of who is manipulating his  thoughts or why, and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t WANT to think.<br/>
 <br/>
So In light of all this I&#39;m going to share and annotate some feedback we  got <br/>
about the list.  Lots of people leave it could&#39;ve been anybody:<br/>
 <br/>
-=-We all have to be choosy about which email lists we read, just in  terms of<br/>
volume and time. I stay with lists that give me ideas,  suggestions,<br/>
encouragement, specific materials to use. I was put off by the  <br/>
argumentative, overly philosophical,it-has-to-be-all-unschooling-all-the-time  viewpoint. <br/>
Perhaps in the end, I don&#39;t argree with radical unschooling, and it  seems that <br/>
that is what this list is about.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
My reflections:<br/>
 <br/>
-=-We all have to be choosy about which email lists we read, just in  terms of<br/>
volume and time.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Absolutely sensible and true.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I stay with lists that give me ideas, suggestions,  encouragement, <br/>
specific materials to use.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
This list abounds with ideas, suggestions and encouragement.   Well... unless <br/>
it&#39;s encouragement about wanting specific materials to  use.  So there the <br/>
problem comes.  Some people don&#39;t think &quot;everything  in the whole wide world&quot; is <br/>
specific enough, and that &quot;everything that comes  into your path today&quot; is <br/>
not much better.  I disagree with them, but that&#39;s  because I&#39;ve used those <br/>
things to good effect for years and I see other  unschoolers use them <br/>
fantastically.  Like magic, there the world is,  seeping right into your house every day, <br/>
shining through the windows, oozing  under the door, open for exploration all <br/>
the time.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I was put off by the argumentative, overly philosophical,  <br/>
it-has-to-be-all-unschooling-all-the-time viewpoint.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
When people are put off they are.  That&#39;s fine.  <br/>
But &quot;overly philosophical&quot;?  <br/>
The alternative is &quot;underly philosophical,&quot; and that won&#39;t help unschoolers  <br/>
much at all.<br/>
As to whether it has to be all unschooling all the time, it only needs to  be <br/>
that for those who want unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
As with other philosophies, it either is a priority or it isn&#39;t; it&#39;s  either <br/>
an integral thing or it isn&#39;t.<br/>
If I want to be honest, I need to be all honest all the time.  I can&#39;t  say <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m honest, late afternoons and weekends.&quot;   Or &quot;I believe  natural learning <br/>
can work, after I&#39;m through with their lessons.&quot;  Or &quot;I  think all things are <br/>
related, after school hours, but we don&#39;t talk about  history during science <br/>
lessons and we don&#39;t bring literature up during  history.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-Perhaps in the end, Idon&#39;t argree with radical unschooling, and it seems  <br/>
that that is what this list is about.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&#39;Seems&#39; madam?  Nay, it is.  I know not &#39;seems.&#39;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Sandra<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
P.S.  Probably lots of unschooled kids know that quote, even if they  &quot;aren&#39;t <br/>
old enough&quot; or &quot;haven&#39;t studied that.&quot;  And if they don&#39;t, it  doesn&#39;t matter <br/>
a single bit, if they know how to use google.  And if they  don&#39;t care and <br/>
don&#39;t look it up, it doesn&#39;t matter a single bit.<br/>

Over on Always Unschooled we have the words &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; in the<br/>
list description - TWICE. <br/>
<br/>
We still get people occasionally being surprised that we emphasize Radical<br/>
Unschooling in our discussions. They will often begin their dissenting posts<br/>
with the phrase &quot;Don&#39;t you think that....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No I *don&#39;t* think that, but at least I *think*.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m convinced that some folk just don&#39;t read beyond the keywords in Yahoo<br/>
before joining lists.<br/>

When people are put off they are.  That&#39;s fine.  <br/>
But &quot;overly philosophical&quot;?  <br/>
The alternative is &quot;underly philosophical,&quot; and that won&#39;t help unschoolers  <br/>
much at all.**<br/>
<br/>
I think we mostly come from public school backgrounds, and that&#39;s a *fine* (and sad) example of an under-ly philosophical environment.  Perhaps parts of our brains start to atrophy? &lt;g&gt;  (Many of us are going to be rusty in pondering philosophical precepts.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some unschooling beginners need (want?) something linear and concrete to start with.  (Because some of them do seem to be looking for some rules or a &quot;recipe&quot;.)  People must come here with some pretty strong preconceptions about learning, and deep philosophical discussions right off the bat may be too confusing for some of them, maybe?  I&#39;m thinking about the principle that we can&#39;t learn when we are confused.  Some of them have to work their way through confusion, and may need simpler or more orderly information at first?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d guess that there are some people who research unschooling merely to be thorough and review all of the &quot;homeschooling styles&quot;.  They may have no attraction to unschooling, and merely be attempting to be neutrally open-minded while they check out all of the possibilities.  Or, it may be that while the parent isn&#39;t at all attracted to unschooling, they realize that their child isn&#39;t at all attracted to curriculum and won&#39;t do that kind of &quot;educational&quot; rigamarole without pushing, screaming and threats.  For us, unschooling is the answer -- but what if people are wildly uncomfortable with what they imagine unschooling to be?  I can dredge up some sympathy for this (imagined) type of person who isn&#39;t stern enough to push curriculum on a miserable child, but who has found public school to be dreadful and thinks unschooling is risky and implausible.<br/>
<br/>
We likely have people stopping by here who think that their children can only learn when forced, and that they (the adults) can only learn when forced, and (drat it!) we have no power to force them  to stay here and &quot;do their unschooling homework&quot;.  (I shudder to think what the pop quizzes would look like. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

It&#39;s on Dan Vilter&#39;s fine site.<br/>

Thanks for bringing that up! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
-=-For  us, unschooling is the answer -- but what if people are wildly <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know the answer to that.  Maybe the Unschooling Basics  list?<br/>
Maybe reading The Unschooling Handbook?<br/>
 <br/>
What I do know is that if we say, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right! That&#39;s a good as it  <br/>
needs to be,&quot; lots of people will give up because it doesn&#39;t seem to be  enough.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I can dredge up some sympathy for this (imagined) type of person who  <br/>
isn&#39;t stern enough to push curriculum on a miserable child, but who has found  <br/>
public school to be dreadful and thinks unschooling is risky and  implausible.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Enough sympathy to try to help them make it workable so that their kids  <br/>
don&#39;t end up back in school after some (imagined?) screaming fight and possible  <br/>
near divorce because they really didn&#39;t get it, they just hoped that if they <br/>
let  the kid do whatever he wanted to, that he would study American history at <br/>
15,  world history at 16, biology and chemistry and physics (in that order)  <br/>
etc...<br/>
 <br/>
I feel for the kids first and the moms less.  If someone says she  wants to <br/>
dedicate the kind of time and energy it&#39;s going to take to homeschool  in ANY <br/>
fashion, it seems to me it&#39;s worth helping her do it thoroughly and  deeply, <br/>
rather than helping set her up to fail by making it seem smaller or  easier or <br/>
less philosophical than it is.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-We likely have people stopping by here who think that their children can  <br/>

 <br/>
The pop quiz would be unscheduled home visits.  The unschooling child  <br/>
services officers with clipboards.<br/>
 <br/>
Those who DO want to hang out and do some unschooling homework (shuddering  <br/>
about that one &lt;g&gt;) can come to it slowly or quickly, but those who ONLY  want <br/>
to follow the directions. . .  I don&#39;t know.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They want specific resource recommendations. They want to know very <br/>
concretely how to help their kids learn to add fractions or spell <br/>
&quot;fractions&quot; or say &quot;fractions&quot; in Spanish &lt;G&gt;. They expect to find out <br/>
what materials we&#39;re &quot;using.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, we really seldom talk on this list about what our kids <br/>
are actually learning. I think that is what they&#39;re looking for and not <br/>
finding and when they say we&#39;re too &quot;philosophical&quot; they mean we&#39;re <br/>
just not giving them the kind of specific information they&#39;re looking <br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
They want to hear how I gave my little daughter a $20 bill and sent her <br/>
over to buy a couple of cookies at the little shop in the mall. How I <br/>
told her that was a lot of money for just buying a couple of cookies <br/>
and she should get at least $15 back - so check her change before <br/>
leaving the counter. And how the clerk only gave her a five and some <br/>
change and she said, &quot;I think you owe me more change,&quot; and then the <br/>
clerk gave her another ten. Quite a nice little &quot;lesson.&quot; Right?<br/>
<br/>
Then they want to take THEIR little girl to the mall and sit across the <br/>
mall and give her $20 and send her to buy a couple of cookies and <br/>
remind her to check her change. Aaaargh.<br/>
<br/>
What they MISS is that I had a broken leg (literally) and we were at <br/>
the mall for a reason and I was worn out and we just wanted cookies so <br/>
I gave her money to go get them and it was just one of those weird <br/>
coincidences that I thought to say &quot;Check your change,&quot; and then it <br/>
turned out the clerk DID give her the wrong change. They can&#39;t <br/>
reproduce that. They&#39;ll have their OWN check-your-change experiences <br/>
and maybe won&#39;t even have to break their leg to do it &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s what they&#39;re looking for - a list that is filled with <br/>
&quot;unschooling methods&quot; - ways that unschoolers&#39; get their kids to learn <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t like we never do this - we talk about how we &quot;strew&quot; things to <br/>
create a rich and stimulating and fun and interesting environment. But <br/>
I think they&#39;re wanting the list to be far MORE about that - they want <br/>
to know what, exactly, it is that we&#39;re strewing and what the kids are <br/>
learning from it. Again, we do a bit of talking about this - and it is <br/>
interesting more as &quot;examples&quot; of what unschooling can be like - but I <br/>
think they&#39;re disappointed not to find the list mostly that so that <br/>
they can actually &quot;use&quot; some of what they find.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can I just remind you of something you shared back when I first<br/>
joined? Baby steps. Sometimes I think what happens for new list<br/>
members is that they are overwhelmed with the scope of the unschooling<br/>
vision. It takes time to digest all the ways that unschooling<br/>
influences your parenting.<br/>
<br/>
So, for instance, I had a child who definitely needed to have control<br/>
over his education. That drew me to unschooling. But I hadn&#39;t thought<br/>
about the fact that maybe he needed control over lots of other things<br/>
too. Then that discovery set up a crisis - would my husband be on<br/>
board for letting go of chores, control over movie viewing and music?<br/>
<br/>
Then I had to rethink how we parented and how we thought about<br/>
parenting, not just how to educate him.<br/>
<br/>
There is a moment where you think you can get away with doing it<br/>
differently (than list members) because you are a unique family, or<br/>
you have a theology/philosophy that is different than what is<br/>
postulated on the list and therefore you get a &quot;free pass&quot; to unschool<br/>
in a unique way... <br/>
<br/>
But then that way doesn&#39;t produce the results advertized on the list<br/>
so you come back with questions hoping someone will hear that you are<br/>
struggling and what you really want is permission to struggle, not<br/>
reminders to change. &lt;g&gt; So then frustration sets in as the cognitive<br/>
dissonance grows. Confidence wanes and going back to familiar<br/>
territory is easier than wading further into the deep water of<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a long, long time to get it (I am still in that process, even<br/>
though I&#39;ve been reading this list for two and half years and started<br/>
unschooling (or so I thought) right then). I keep seeing ways I<br/>
retreat from unschooling with a few of my kids.<br/>
<br/>
The layers of (excuse my French) educational sh** I have to weed<br/>
through that I didn&#39;t even know were there.... Ugh!<br/>
<br/>
It may be hard for those of you who have unschooled all your lives to<br/>
grasp what a worldview crasher unschooling is. And then those of us<br/>
like me trying to &quot;get it&quot; live in communities that reinforce the<br/>
belief that unschooling is crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Example: I called college admissions for one of my kids last week<br/>
(she&#39;s interested in Boston College). When the admissions counselor<br/>
started ticking off what my dd needed to do as a homeschooler to get<br/>
in, I felt that familiar sick feeling of panic. What if she wants to<br/>
go there but I&#39;ve prevented her by not having her follow a curriculum<br/>
(which they stated over and over again she had to do)?<br/>
<br/>
So what am I to do? And can that be discussed here? Those are the<br/>
kinds of thoughts that run through my head.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I am over feeling attacked by challenging feedback. I<br/>
welcome the direct approach. Sometimes that is the only way to &quot;get<br/>
it.&quot; But I can see that those who feel fragile find it difficult to<br/>
honestly share where they are stuck because they are terrified of<br/>
failing their kids or being correctd and don&#39;t have the confidence to<br/>
trust unschooling all the way.<br/>

It  isn&#39;t like we never do this - we talk about how we &quot;strew&quot; things to  <br/>
create a rich and stimulating and fun and interesting environment. But  <br/>
I think they&#39;re wanting the list to be far MORE about that - they want  <br/>
to know what, exactly, it is that we&#39;re strewing and what the kids are  <br/>
learning from it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  More specific.<br/>
 <br/>
Watch whichever movie comes along in your lives next.  Then watch  another <br/>
movie related to it in some way, like<br/>
same historical period<br/>
same physical setting (another movie about Thailand, or NYC, or South  Africa)<br/>
same director<br/>
one of the actors is in the other movie<br/>
same genre of movie<br/>
a remake of the movie<br/>
musical version of the story<br/>
same composer did the score of both<br/>
 <br/>
Watch a third movie.  Doesn&#39;t matter which movie in the whole  world.  Random.<br/>
 <br/>
Without even trying there will be similarities or differences  (schoolterm:  <br/>
&quot;comparison/contrast&quot;) to the two you already saw.  <br/>
 <br/>
If a family were to do that and report back to the list what they learned  <br/>
and all the cool side conversations and the trip to the video store and what  <br/>
they ate (whether while watching or later while they discussed it) and the many  <br/>
things that came up serendipitously over the next few days that related to <br/>
the  movie, then they would already be getting unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
And when people join the list, don&#39;t they get links to places that have  <br/>
links to other places?  They want the list to tell them everything they  need to <br/>
know?  How often should we repeat everything everyone needs to  know?  Weekly?  <br/>
Daily?  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m working on a &quot;how to begin unschooling&quot; article for unschooling.info,  <br/>
but I keep thinking all the parts are written and it will end up being a link of <br/>
 lists, and advice like &quot;change yourself into an unschooling mom.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s kind of frustrating.  If we were &quot;running courses,&quot; there would  be <br/>
starting times.  &quot;The next course begins June 6.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Home Education Magazine was thinking of doing online classes a few years  ago <br/>
and I was asked if I would teach a class on unschooling (like people would  <br/>
pay money to take an online class).  I said I thought it wasn&#39;t the way to  <br/>
learn about unschooling.  Maybe I was wrong.  I hate to think  that.  It seems <br/>
people who need that course would think their kids would  need courses, and they <br/>
would want a refresher course later on why the first  course didn&#39;t work.<br/>

 <br/>
I cried myself to sleep many times as a child.  I (retroactively)  curse <br/>
anyone who was soothing my mom while I was crying until my stomach hurt,  alone in <br/>
my bed. <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
It shouldn&#39;t need to take a long long time to get it if people actively  move <br/>
toward getting it.  <br/>
 <br/>
People don&#39;t have a long, long time.  Their children are older every  minute <br/>
of every day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589800956">**<br/>
<br/>
Can I just remind you of something you shared back when I first<br/>
joined? Baby steps. Sometimes I think what happens for new list<br/>
members is that they are overwhelmed with the scope of the unschooling<br/>
vision. It takes time to digest all the ways that unschooling<br/>
influences your parenting.**<br/>
<br/>
If we think of this list as an unschooling &quot;sales pitch&quot;, well then, yeah we don&#39;t want our &quot;prospects&quot; (readers) to run from the room screaming right off the bat. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, if unschooling is a ten step process, we probably don&#39;t want to address and re-address step 1 the majority of the time.  <br/>
<br/>
That reminds me that recently when people talked about coming to unschooling through La Leche League, I thought that maybe having a set of four or more informal rotating topics might be useful for this list.  (This only makes sense in slow periods.)<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
Personally, I am over feeling attacked by challenging feedback. I<br/>
welcome the direct approach. Sometimes that is the only way to &quot;get<br/>
it.&quot; But I can see that those who feel fragile find it difficult to<br/>
honestly share where they are stuck because they are terrified of<br/>
failing their kids or being correctd and don&#39;t have the confidence to<br/>
trust unschooling all the way.**<br/>
<br/>
Challenging feedback gets the message out clearly, but, yeah, lots of people avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly I don&#39;t often want to admit my failings and hear suggestions.  (Eek!)  I really don&#39;t like to concede that there is room for improvement!<br/>
<br/>
Life has been downright sluggish at my house the month of May, but son and spouse have had annoying hacking coughs for the past three weeks.  It may be to be expected that we aren&#39;t going many places.  I kept thinking my son was going to be done feeling tired and be ready to leap at one of my suggestions.  Well, not yet.  (And now I&#39;m getting the coughing crud myself.  Rats!)<br/>

====================<br/>
 <br/>
That could be fun to at least try for one rotation.<br/>
 <br/>
So what are the four or more topics people need to discuss to get  <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
 <br/>
In LLL, weaning/solids (for example) comes around once a month,  and not all <br/>
the moms are needing it every time, but some people only go to four  meetings <br/>
and have to do with what they can from memory and books if they don&#39;t  want to <br/>
go back.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you should give permission to struggle... I was simply<br/>
describing what I think happens. I love this list because it isn&#39;t<br/>
about cooing and pampering the hurt in mothers. But it takes time to<br/>
get that that is empowering. It&#39;s very different than what most<br/>
women&#39;s groups do for each other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right. That&#39;s why you have to keep putting out the other perspective.<br/>
<br/>
But it might help to remind moms too that the transition takes a<br/>
l-o-n-g time mentally even though they can make practical changes<br/>
immediately that benefit the child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; toward getting it.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree. I have actively moved toward getting it. I am on another<br/>
list of moms who have actively moved toward getting it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made all kinds of changes. Last night I talked with my husband<br/>
about this stuff again. We both see that our youngest two are living<br/>
as unschooled kids, all the way. The older three have their own<br/>
process of stuff to move through having not been unschooled from the<br/>
beginning. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; People don&#39;t have a long, long time.  Their children are older every<br/>
 </span></blockquote> minute <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of every day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me use a breast-feeding analogy.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that you can&#39;t take a long time to decide to breast-feed<br/>
because while you are reasearching and bottle-feeding, the child is<br/>
outgrowing breastfeeding and missing all it&#39;s about.<br/>
<br/>
Otoh, you can choose to breastfeed in spite of how you think about<br/>
it... and then find yourself at nine months wondering if this is long<br/>
enough, at 15 months asking if he really shouldn&#39;t be sleeping through<br/>
the night yet and can you just wean him at night, and then at 22<br/>
months find out that all your friends are horrified that you still<br/>
breastfeed and wonder if he&#39;ll stop any time soon and so on....<br/>
<br/>
All the while you are breast-feeding, but also encountering the layers<br/>
of your belief about feeding that you hadn&#39;t even confronted when you<br/>
began.<br/>
<br/>
I had no difficulties with breast-feeding. I never felt any of those<br/>
pressures. But as an LLL leader, I encountered this kind of thing over<br/>
and over again.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s similar with education. You can start down the right path, but<br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean you stay there easily, confidently. You have to keep<br/>
reimagining what it is to stay there as the kids get older, as options<br/>
for their future emerge, as their personalities bring new ideas and<br/>
desires to the table.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I mean by &quot;getting it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All the while we unschool.<br/>

It is encouraging and affirming...especially when I hear about<br/>

Some people find it intimidating, though, if they hear that someone&#39;s<br/>
child is giving piano concerts at the local music hall or has recently<br/>
had their novel published, or whatever, and think that if their child<br/>
isn&#39;t doing the same then they are not successfully unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a friend tell me that she wanted to unschool, but couldn&#39;t until<br/>
her son learned time management skills because otherwise he would<br/>
never want to do his schoolwork on his own without her nagging him. <br/>
=-o  She also said her son probably inhereted her family&#39;s poor time<br/>
management genes (huh????)?<br/>
<br/>
Well, here is my recent laundry list of things Sarah has learned in<br/>
the last month.  They don&#39;t sound like school; they sound like life:<br/>
<br/>
Sarah (15-1/2) has her first &quot;real&quot; summer job.<br/>
<br/>
So far:<br/>
<br/>
1) She has had to fill out tax forms and an application, obtain a work<br/>
permit, and get her own checking account. <br/>
<br/>
2) She has had to become re-certified in cpr and first aid, and get<br/>
certified in water safety/lifeguard rescue.<br/>
<br/>
3) She has had to learn about sexual predators at public waterparks<br/>
and how to identify them and report them, and what types of behaviors<br/>
are signals something is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
4) She has had to learn about sexual harrassment on the work force.<br/>
<br/>
5) She has had to learn about crowd control and what to do in case of<br/>
a bomb threat at the park.<br/>
<br/>
6) She is learning about being an employee, and part of a team.<br/>
<br/>
7) She is learning to appreciate those who are in positions of keeping<br/>
people safe and secure in a way that she was never aware of before.<br/>
<br/>
8) She is learning how tired she can be at the end of a work shift.<br/>
<br/>
9) She is learning the importance of eating regularly and drinking<br/>
lots of fluid to keep from becoming fatigued and dehydrated while on<br/>
the job.<br/>
<br/>
10) She is learning the frustration of not being able to do<br/>
*everything* she wants to because now she has a job schedule to consider.<br/>
<br/>
11) She is learning independence and responsibility and how to deal<br/>
with stresss and frustration.<br/>
<br/>
12) She is learning how to deal with angry and upset patrons.<br/>
<br/>
13) She is learning how to exert authority without becoming<br/>
dictatorial (I hope).<br/>
<br/>
14) She is learning how fast money goes when it is spent on luxuries<br/>
instead of saved and budgeted.<br/>
<br/>
15) She is learning if she doesn&#39;t dry her suit and towel when she<br/>
gets home, they will still be damp and probably stinky the next day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are tons of other things she is learning as well.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will look at that list and think, &quot;Yeah, but what about<br/>
geometry and world literature?&quot;  They just don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Lots of people make this point, but I never see the negation as<br/>
negative in a value-judgment sense when I use the word--to me<br/>
unschooling is as positive as unchaining, unbinding, unleashing,<br/>
unfolding, unfurling, unlimiting....All mean freedom and growth and<br/>
vast possibilities to me.&quot; ~ Suzanne Carter</div>

I don&#39;t think you were wrong although when I first started unschooling I  <br/>
wanted something or someone to tell me how to &quot;get it&quot;.   It took  months for me <br/>
to even begin to grasp the depth of unschooling and 2 years later  I&#39;m still <br/>
learning, understanding and incorporating the philosophy into  the way I live <br/>
my life.  <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is so much more an ongoing process and just not like picking up  <br/>
a book or taking a course.  When I started homeschooling when Brenna was 8,  <br/>
it was so easy for me.<br/>
I bought books, I joined a homeschool group, we went on field trips, I went  <br/>
to curriculum fairs, we did school at home and I made portfolios.  Piece of  <br/>
cake.  It just wasn&#39;t the right piece of cake...&gt;g&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is woven into our lives now and seems so natural.  I can&#39;t  <br/>
imagine our lives any other way.  While it appeared to be an easy  transition for <br/>
both my husband and children, it was grueling for me.  I had  to let go of most <br/>
if not all of my beliefs about parenting and learning before I  could even <br/>
begin to make room for unschooling.  I embraced the philosophy  but I had to <br/>
change me from the inside out and that took re-evaluation, massive  amounts of <br/>
time reading and thinking, changes in my interactions with my family  and after <br/>
a couple of years a realization I finally did &quot;get it&quot; and we are  living it. <br/>
Learning to say yes was one of my biggest challenges.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We came to unschooling later than many as my children were 10 and 13  but I <br/>
think it was soon enough to make huge positive differences in their  lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there are people who come to unschooling and do get it easily and  <br/>
quickly.  For me, it was a  difficult change but I never once  thought it was <br/>
not possible.  It has been worth every moment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Again, same.<br/>
<br/>
 While it appeared to be an easy  transition for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; both my husband and children, it was grueling for me.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I am trying to communicate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had  to let go of most <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if not all of my beliefs about parenting and learning before I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>could even <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; begin to make room for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I had to do so around those who find this philsophy dangerous or<br/>
unwise or overboard. Can&#39;t underestimate the impact of competing messages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I embraced the philosophy  but I had to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; change me from the inside out and that took re-evaluation, massive <br/>
 </span></blockquote>amounts of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time reading and thinking, changes in my interactions with my family<br/>

stories. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Perhaps there are people who come to unschooling and do get it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>easily and  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; quickly.  For me, it was a  difficult change but I never once <br/>
 </span></blockquote>thought it was <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not possible.  It has been worth every moment.<br/>

transition to get to the good stuff, to feel the benefits.<br/>
<br/>
If they feel they have blown it by not getting it all at once, then<br/>
they will not keep going.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it would help if moms on this list could compile their<br/>

like so that moms in the same situation won&#39;t just feel like they are<br/>
failures and therefore &quot;aren&#39;t right for unschooling.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
My love for unschooling is partly my love for the swirling interrelated <br/>
connection-making ocean of ideas that we swim around in all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Which seems odd since I&#39;m one who &quot;organizes&quot; my thinking - I like <br/>
lists and bullet points and all that.<br/>
<br/>
But I get my thrills from the zippy conversations of unschoolers - I <br/>
LOVE it that one never knows where a conversation will lead. Opening <br/>
each new email is a potential adventure.<br/>
<br/>
(Which explains why I never change subject lines and it wouldn&#39;t bother <br/>
me at all if we didn&#39;t even HAVE subject lines. Everything is <br/>
connected. Subjects? We don&#39;t need no stinkin&#39; subjects! &lt;BEG&gt;)<br/>

Bedtime<br/>
Food<br/>
Electronic Gaming<br/>

Maybe that is how it should get divided - two topics:<br/>
<br/>
Reassurance and Challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe once a month we could hold a &quot;Typical Days&quot; day, and people could post<br/>
about a day from the past month that seems interesting or cool or ordinary.<br/>
I only find myself posting that kind of thing when someone specifically<br/>
asks, &quot;What did you guys do say, yesterday?&quot; on A/U.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know - this is similar to the FAQ debate that comes up periodically.<br/>
I too respond to Pam&#39;s idea of &quot;swirling&quot; and &quot;zippy&quot; unpredictability in<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517607633">**Okay. More specific.<br/>
<br/>
 Watch whichever movie comes along in your lives next.  Then watch  another <br/>
movie related to it in some way, like<br/>
same historical period<br/>
same physical setting (another movie about Thailand, or NYC, or South  Africa)<br/>
same director<br/>
one of the actors is in the other movie...**<br/>
<br/>
If several of us chose the same DVD released this week (I have The Aviator!), it would be fascinating to see how the different choices would spiral out into totally different and intriguing directions!<br/>
<br/>
**Without even trying there will be similarities or differences  (schoolterm:  <br/>
&quot;comparison/contrast&quot;) to the two you already saw. **<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, my son (8or9?) explained in detail to my husband the plot similarities between Atlantis and Titan A.E.  My husband beamed, and then threw up his hands saying he had been trying to teach his older  students to do this and couldn&#39;t do it.  I say --Yoda says &quot;there is no teach -- there is only DO.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
It&#39;s kind of frustrating.  If we were &quot;running courses,&quot; there would  be <br/>
starting times.  &quot;The next course begins June 6.&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking the same thing.  We&#39;d start with topic #1 in September (and make everyone bring sharpened pencils), and would chug forward thru the other topics without any circling back.  But to do that we&#39;d have to do that awful teacher thing of telling people their questions would have to await the proper time.  Blech.  &quot;That will all be gone into at the proper time...&quot;<br/>

That could be fun to at least try for one rotation.<br/>
<br/>
So what are the four or more topics people need to discuss to get<br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
In LLL, weaning/solids (for example) comes around once a month,  and not all<br/>
the moms are needing it every time, but some people only go to four<br/>
meetings<br/>
and have to do with what they can from memory and books if they don&#39;t  want<br/>

go back.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julie, I&#39;ve been nodding in agreement at everything you&#39;ve written <br/>
(including the part about b.f., which I certainly fumbled my way <br/>
through for the first couple years).<br/>
<br/>
I had some serious cognitive dissonance going on yesterday after <br/>
reading the story of the person who let her child play in the tub with <br/>
a raw egg. First I thought about how I couldn&#39;t possibly do that <br/>
because of the logistics of the situation. I have 3 kids under 5 yrs <br/>
old. I can&#39;t just run upstairs to the tub to let one of them explore <br/>
right at the moment they want to! Okay, there&#39;s just some unschooling <br/>
stuff that I can&#39;t do right now and I&#39;m mad at even hearing about it <br/>
because I don&#39;t want to think about doing things that take more work <br/>
than I already have. We can raise perfectly happy kids who probably <br/>
won&#39;t be in therapy complaining about how when they were 2 or 4, they <br/>
didn&#39;t get to play with eggs in the tub. <br/>
<br/>
This morning, I&#39;d progressed to thinking well, I don&#39;t have to run <br/>
upstairs _every_ time they look at an egg. I can try to say yes more, <br/>
that&#39;s the point. If the baby is asleep, the kids could stand on <br/>
chairs and play with eggs in the sink. Dh might be horrified by the <br/>
idea, so I&#39;ll do it while he&#39;s at work and clean up and go get more <br/>
eggs before he comes home so that he sees happy kids, not a mess and <br/>
an eggless house! (He&#39;s coming around, agreed to go to the conference, <br/>
etc., but he&#39;s got a loooong way to go.)<br/>
<br/>
Then I remembered how I had the same reaction to the idea of letting <br/>
go of bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Only it took me three months to work through THAT to the point where I <br/>
was looking for ways to make things work instead of thinking they <br/>
could not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m able to write this message now because my 4.5 yr old turned off <br/>
the monitor when he got tired, curled up on the couch and went to <br/>
sleep chatting to me about our very nice day together. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll report back about what happens with eggs...and I bet it will be <br/>
in less than 3 months!<br/>

I like the discussions about strewing here, but I&#39;d also like to see <br/>
some of the more practical lists of things to strew on the <br/>
Unschooling Basics list. It&#39;s gotten quiet lately and I know in the <br/>
past there have been good discussions started from some of the list <br/>
of &quot;things that might appeal to a kid who...&quot;. I still have a <br/>
printout of a list of good things for someone who needs lots of <br/>
tactile stimulation. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s such a change to actively look for opportunities to let a child <br/>
play with water instead of trying different locks for the bathroom <br/>
door, for example, and that&#39;s great for people to hear when they are <br/>
just starting out. More of the positive &quot;go and do this&quot; in addition <br/>

But it doesn&#39;t need to have anything to do with eggs.  It might be  lighting <br/>

 <br/>
And the bedtime business is misunderstood more often than not, I  think.  <br/>
There&#39;s a lot of yes to be said with that many kids, but &quot;stay up  as late as you <br/>

the freezer by filling a cup (plastic because of expansion--the kids got <br/>
this one really quickly) with water and submerging any number of small <br/>
toys. They&#39;ve had a blast finding the frozen creature/ toy just like in <br/>
the movies, but they&#39;ve also discovered all kinds of really cool things <br/>
from the way water expands when it freezes and breaks the cup, to the <br/>
way it freezes in different places first. They&#39;ve had fun taking it out <br/>
in all different stages, from just the membrane on top to an ice cup <br/>
because the sides and bottom are frozen but not the center, on and on. <br/>
It&#39;s also amazing how much fun a plain ice popsicle is when they&#39;ve made <br/>
it themselves. *g* I&#39;m casually looking for those rubbermaid popsicle <br/>
makers; I&#39;ll step up the search after the move. Those&#39;ll be hours of fun <br/>
this summer for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I want to get at here is that while I can totally <br/>
understand the desire for a list of cool things to do and I can see how <br/>
great such lists are to help break out of a rut, the best, most fun, <br/>
most interesting learning that goes on in my home is the spontaneous <br/>
kind rather than the list following kind.<br/>
<br/>
The most glorious part about finding a way to say &quot;yes&quot; is that it <br/>
nurtures and encourages *each* child&#39;s spontaneous learning rather than <br/>
overlaying them with other children&#39;s (or adult&#39;s) learning activities, <br/>
however cool, however well-intentioned.<br/>
<br/>
The danger I see with generating such lists and putting them somewhere <br/>
easily accessible, rather than following the natural flow of ideas that <br/>
come across email discussion, is that these lists can be twisted into <br/>
another form of curriculum, an unschooling list of &quot;what your child <br/>
needs to know,&quot; that could prevent parents from really stretching and <br/>
growing into seeing and following the ideas that spring up naturally in <br/>
their own homes. Encouraging a parent to say &quot;yes,&quot; to participate in, <br/>
nurture and follow her child&#39;s journeys will, in my opinion, get that <br/>
family more quickly to an Unschooling place than any posted activity <br/>
list ever could.<br/>
