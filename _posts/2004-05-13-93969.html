<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225802472">Having a teenager or college student come to your house to help with the kids <br/>
was exactly what I was thinking as well.  It can be as a babysitter or <br/>
mother&#39;s helper.  Usually doesn&#39;t cost too much and you can usually find students <br/>
who like kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, near us we have a private university that has a parent coop playschool <br/>
they call it.  It&#39;s only 2 hours a day and kids can go as many days as parents <br/>
want to sign them up for: once a week or every day.  A different parent helps <br/>
out everyday and they don&#39;t do any teaching, hence the name playschool.<br/>
<br/>
Since the baby probably naps every day you could have a helper come during <br/>
nap time just as a special friend to play with your 4 year old.  That would give <br/>
you some time to work.  And since it&#39;s almost summer vacation, this is a good <br/>
time of year to find someone!<br/>
Also, I would suggest having your son help you out too.  My almost 4 yr old <br/>
loves construction stuff and has wood scraps, nails, hammer, etc to use when he <br/>
wants.  Could he also help out at the home site as well?  I know that someone <br/>
would have to take time to watch him, etc but it would probably make him feel <br/>
more a part of the process.  Even if he only goes there a little bit to help: <br/>
carry hammers, etc- that might be enough for him to know that &quot;mommy needs to <br/>
work on house stuff right now&quot; and perhaps he would be willing to let you <br/>
have some time to work.  <br/>
We have a big sandbox right outside our window and my son uses that sometimes <br/>
while I work at the computer.  He also enjoys computer games and &quot;new&quot; movies <br/>
or books from the library that keep his attention when I need to take care of <br/>
something- phone call, computer, etc.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
