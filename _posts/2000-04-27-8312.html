<div id="ygrps-yiv-815268272">Hi<br/>
Does anyone happen to know of a good site on the history of China?  My kids <br/>
and I watched Inn Of The Sixth Happiness yesterday, and now they want to know <br/>
more about the history of China, and particularly the practice of foot <br/>
binding.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Jodye</div>
