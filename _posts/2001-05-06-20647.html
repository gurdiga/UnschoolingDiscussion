<div id="ygrps-yiv-774558381">If you haven&#39;t already read it, I highly recommend Barry Neil Kaufman&#39;s<br/>
book Son-Rise.  This is a biography recounting a loving and gentle<br/>
approach to parenting autistic children.  Son-Rise:  The Miracle<br/>
Continues edition contains a forward written by Raun Kaufman, the<br/>
autistic son of the Kaufman&#39;s.  In fact, this book is worth checking out<br/>
for that forward alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776309317">Aspergers is on the autistic spectrum, the higher<br/>
functioning end of things.  Like Raun, my son started<br/>
considerably closer to the severe side than he is<br/>
functioning at now.  I read Kaufman&#39;s books, and think<br/>
he seems like a wonderful person.  I personally had a<br/>
great deal of success with the method recommended in<br/>
the bood &quot;Holding Time&quot;.  I think you have to do what<br/>
makes sense to you, for your specific child, and if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t work *keep trying*.<br/>
