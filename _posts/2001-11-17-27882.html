<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386788221">I, too, have an anal dh (an engineer with an MBA--can you get any more<br/>
compulsive LOL).  He would really like workbooks but is moving beyond that<br/>
finally.<br/>
<br/>
Several things we have done to help alleviate his anxieties at different<br/>
times:<br/>
<br/>
1.  do 4-H projects.  They are heavy on record keeping so he could see<br/>
writing skills, multiplication, etc..<br/>
<br/>
2.  have him do projects with the kids so he could see they weren&#39;t somehow<br/>
secretly stupid<br/>
<br/>
3.  lots of computer games, like math blasters and 4th Grade adventures,<br/>
automatically keep track of skills<br/>
<br/>
4. offer kids lots of hands-on stuff, like gardening, animal care and<br/>
breeding (we are currently drying carved apples to make puppets...next<br/>
Halloween, we may dry them to make &quot;shrunken heads&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
