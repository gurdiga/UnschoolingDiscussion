Ned was not booted for having dissenting opinions. Many people here agree <br/>
with the content of his posts. It was his refusal to stop his torrent of <br/>
rants, which to me, hardly ever really addressed what others were talking <br/>
about. He was politely asked quite a few times. He clearly made a choice to <br/>
ignore the intent of this list as explained by the moderators.<br/>
<br/>
That is not censorship.<br/>
