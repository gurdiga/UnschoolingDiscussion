<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;There was a woman dragging a screaming child (six or so) across the<br/>
&gt; road to a garage sale one day with the kid saying &quot;I&#39;m sleepy, I dont<br/>
&gt; want to go.&quot; and the mom insulting and threatening her.  The mom COULD<br/>
&gt; have parked at the curb in front of the house and left the girl in the<br/>
&gt; car.  The mom could have left the girl home, or stayed home with her,<br/>
&gt; but the mom obviously thought her right to go to garage sales was<br/>
&gt; greater than her child&#39;s right to sleep or sit safely in a car. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; YIKES!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;m paranoid because I live in a nasty big city (Los Angeles) but<br/>
&gt; I would never leave my child alone in the car for an instant - even in<br/>
&gt; the suburbs. Even right near me - it is too easy to get distracted by<br/>
&gt; all the wonderful yard sale goodies. Too many carjackers and scary<br/>
&gt; maniacs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to leave my girls in the car while at a garage sale in<br/>
the wee hours of the morning, if I could park close enough and they were<br/>
sleeping or wanted to stay in there playing.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable if the car was out of my sight.<br/>
<br/>
It probably does have to do with living in LA. I live in a small town. I<br/>
take my car keys with me so car-jackers would get no joy there, plus<br/>
carjackers are about as common as lightning deaths here. I wouldn&#39;t leave<br/>
them while I went into a store (out of sight) but parked at the curb with me<br/>
15 feet away in the open air with other harmless whackos as a garage sale?<br/>
No problem.<br/>

Well I don&#39;t live in a really small town but it&#39;s no where near LA. And I <br/>
don&#39;t do garage and yard sales but I would never feel comfortable leaving my <br/>
kids in a car, even 15 feet away with the car open and the windows up, no <br/>
matter how many people were around. If I&#39;m stopping at a garage sale, I <br/>
would assume it&#39;s because I wanted to look at something and looking around <br/>
at stuff can&#39;t be watching my kids. And if the kids didn&#39;t want to come out, <br/>
then they wouldn&#39;t want to be there so I would take them home and not stop.<br/>

<br/>
The garage sale stuff was laid out on the lawn, and the car would never have <br/>
been more than twenty feet from the mom.  I was the only other buyer there.  <br/>
It was early.  It was on a residential street, not a busy road.  She had <br/>
obviously woken the little girl up on a Saturday morning and said &quot;GET IN THE <br/>
CAR,&quot; because the girl was still half asleep.  I wish I had talked to her <br/>
instead of just THINKING to her.</div>

When I go to park day with my girls, they are often 15, 25, 100 feet away<br/>
from me, running in the sprinkler, playing in the sandbox, etc. If they want<br/>

<br/>
I always have my kids in sight. And usually going out, like at a store or <br/>
something, where I want to look, I&#39;ll take a pair of eyes with me. My <br/>
husband, oldest daughter or mom will come along. Way too many kids get <br/>
scooped up in just a matter of a minute. And to be honest, I don&#39;t trust my <br/>
kids at this age to be level headed enough to know exactly what to do if <br/>
something happened. As much as we have talked to them, my 7 year old would <br/>
still probably want to &quot;help&quot; someone find their dog if they lost it. I&#39;m <br/>
just not comfortable enough to not have them in sight at all times. Even at <br/>
the playground, I look for their heads and dress them in colors that are <br/>
easy enough for me to pick out. Even have bright orange bathing suits for <br/>
them both when we went to the water park!!! I see kids running around all <br/>
the time with no parent in sight and it makes me sad. Not saying anyone was <br/>
talking about something that extrmeme here. I guess if I&#39;m a little more <br/>
wary, I&#39;m okay with that. As long as I let the kids have fun and not keep <br/>
them in the house all day!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689073745">At what age would you feel comfortable letting a child in the car <br/>
alone?  <br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn&#39;t you feel comfortable leaving your kids 15 feet away?  <br/>
What if the car was locked, the air conditioning or heat was on <br/>
(depending on the weather), and the children were instructed to not <br/>
unlock for anyone but you? <br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t John Holt advocate allowing children home alone, or out <br/>
walking to the library alone, at very young ages?  <br/>
<br/>
I know a lady who was reported for leaving her child in the car alone <br/>
while she made a quick run into the store.  I think the oldest was <br/>
10.  I think she was able to get rid of CYS after the first visit, <br/>
but it was still very stressful for her.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you have to make decisions not based on what you think is <br/>
ok for your kids but based on what nosy people might or might not <br/>
report. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Although I think the age would vary depending on the maturity of the<br/>
individual, as a general rule I think it is a bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
There have been so many reports of babies and youngsters dying after<br/>
being left in cars for hours, that I think well meaning passers-by may<br/>
call the law just to be on the safe side.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never forget the Oprah show where the mother ran into the store<br/>
literally parked at the door, and an opportunistic parolee drove off<br/>
with her boy in the back. She tried to pull her son out and he was<br/>
killed in the process when the driver just would not stop. <br/>
<br/>
It is not &quot;us&quot; or our kids that we should be distrusting, but criminals<br/>
out there. As another poster mentioned, they can break into a car in 5<br/>
seconds. Then there are the people who want the kid not the car. <br/>
<br/>
As for John Holt, he was writing some of that a long time ago. I don&#39;t<br/>
know whether the world was a safer place for kids, especially small<br/>
towns, or whether it was just the perception that the world was safer,<br/>
but I think time alone does not have to be in a public environment.<br/>
Recently here in Torrance (15 mins from me) a molester has been<br/>
targeting 12 year olds walking home alone from school.<br/>
<br/>
This website made me think<br/>
