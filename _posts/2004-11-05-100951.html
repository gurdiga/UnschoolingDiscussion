<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118998057">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
You just gave me a big idea for a holiday gift for Riley. He loves gaming and has asked for drums and to get both in one sounds so good. Thanks and I am glad I read today, it&#39;s been a long while since I have had the time to sit and read unschooling posts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794858911">Tomorrow&#39;s my birthday and my mother-in-law sent me some money in her <br/>
birthday card.  I bought Donkey Konga!!!  It is so fun.  I&#39;m waiting my turn again <br/>
but it&#39;s a hit with the whole family.  <br/>
<br/>
