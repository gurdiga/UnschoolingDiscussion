<div id="ygrps-yiv-174065888">My almost 5-year old son is insisting that he go to kindergarten. He went<br/>
through a phase like this before after seeing &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; for the<br/>
first time, but after about 6 months of his school obsession, he proudly<br/>
declared himself a homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s saying he wants to be a homeschooler until he&#39;s 5, and then he<br/>
wants to go to kindergarten school...and he wants to be a homeschooler,<br/>
too...when he gets home from school.<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling this has something to do with baby brother, who is now<br/>
almost 1 and spends a lot of time getting into big brother&#39;s stuff. There&#39;s<br/>
been a difficult period of adjustment lately.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to send him off to public school, but I also don&#39;t want to<br/>
tread on him. I believe in giving a child choices...but I just don&#39;t know if<br/>
this is a prudent choice for him to make. Do I have to pull the &quot;I&#39;m the<br/>
mommy&quot; card on him?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so confused and broken hearted over this because I know Monk honestly<br/>
feels like he&#39;d get more attention at school, without his baby brother<br/>
present...but I know it&#39;s the wrong kind of attention!<br/>
<br/>
argh!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone been through this? Any words of wisdom?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s got a year though, right? And a lot of things might be different<br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
Have you asked him exactly what parts of going to school he is interested<br/>
in? I&#39;ve known some kids who really just wanted to play on the school<br/>
playground, or ride the school bus, or have a uniform... and I think the<br/>
big mystery of what&#39;s going on in there can be hard to resist, too. Maybe<br/>
you could visit - private schools especially tend to be more open to<br/>
that, if they think you might be considering enrolling next year.  Maybe<br/>
another kind of &quot;class&quot; would fill his need, like an art class or<br/>
whatever he&#39;s into - just something where he could go by himself and wave<br/>
good-bye to you at the door and tell you all sorts of new stuff later.<br/>
<br/>
Also, does he have friends who don&#39;t school? In the homeschool groups<br/>
we&#39;ve been part of, the kids who start going to park days and activities<br/>
as toddlers or preschoolers generally have a pretty strong social network<br/>
of homeschooled kids by the time they reach 5, and the idea of school<br/>
just doesn&#39;t come up much. <br/>
<br/>
With all that said, if he does decide to go next year, I&#39;d let him make<br/>
that choice, with the understanding that he can stop whenever he wants.<br/>
It does seem that some kids need to actually experience it and make the<br/>
conscious choice not to go there...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661869154">Well, that&#39;s my gut instinct, Mary. I&#39;m hard at work trying to figure <br/>
out a solution to the problem, and I appreciate all of the input. <br/>
Thankfully, I have a pretty strong unpreschool group and we&#39;re all <br/>
going through this or potentially going through this in one form or <br/>
another. So I&#39;m going to start doing 2-3 playgroups a week and get <br/>
some more outside lessons (we were doing gymnastics, but that ended <br/>
at the end of summer & I never signed him up for anything new, <br/>
although he&#39;s DYING to take a tap dance class...)<br/>
<br/>
I think a big stumbling block is dad. While my husband is not against <br/>
homeschooling, he&#39;s also not as rabidly anti-public school as I am & <br/>
he can&#39;t see the harm in &quot;letting&quot; Monk try school out. I feel like <br/>
that&#39;s just a bad bad idea...but I have not tangible reason why, <br/>
especially for Kindergarten...except for the fact that it seems like <br/>
I&#39;ve worked awfully hard to build up a network of homeschool kids and <br/>
if we are out of the loop for a year, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll lose those <br/>
relationships...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...whoever said that I have a year to work it out, thanks. I <br/>
don&#39;t have to freak out about this right now, and I think the more I <br/>
talk about it with Monk, the more stubborn he will be. So all <br/>
discussion is going to stop now, and I&#39;m just going to quietly work <br/>
harder so baby brother isn&#39;t so much of a barrier.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-977511311">Hold your ground with your husband.  As long as he sees that you are <br/>
determined to make it work, it will be fine.  You have also gotten a <br/>
closeness with your child and that is the relationship that you have worked <br/>
so hard to build up, not really with the other groups.  That is the <br/>
relationship that is worth keeping him home to be with you.  He is so little. <br/>
 It will not be another 5-6 years that you start to see him as getting older <br/>
and even then they are so young.  Your kids need you and all that you have to <br/>
give to them, you love, your values, your morals, and all of your time <br/>
together that is irreplaceable.  I think it is important to make the decision <br/>
now, not a year from now.  I think having all the friends for your kids is <br/>
very important, and to work on exposing them to different things in and out <br/>
of the home.  Create an environment at home that gives them places to play.  <br/>
All you need to be thinking about is what all of you can do together.  As we <br/>
saw 2 weeks ago, our time with our families is the most important and we <br/>
never know how much time we have.  Enjoy your kids, they are a gift from God. <br/>
 Make the decision now and hold your ground.  You know it is the right one.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Mary</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022489798">Finding small, short classes as trial runs might make all involved feel <br/>
better.  Kirby didn&#39;t do so well (socially and behaiorally) in a dance class <br/>
he REALLY wanted to take when he was five (where they were super strict and <br/>
he cried), and in an art class (where they loved him but he didn&#39;t follow <br/>
directions well at all, so he was disruptive).  Those made it easier for both <br/>
of us to forget about kindergarten for a while (which turned into ten years <br/>
and counting).<br/>
<br/>
Whatever decision you make today could keep changing, but if you spend the <br/>
remaining &quot;free pre-school time&quot; letting him dabble in stuff you&#39;ll have a <br/>
better basis for decision, and more than your own personal fears and <br/>
thoughts--you&#39;ll have evidence, and he&#39;ll have different motivations in a <br/>
year than now.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things which have helped us and other families:  lunch boxes and <br/>
bus rides.<br/>
<br/>
Packing a lunch in a school lunchbox and going to the park can be fun.   Some <br/>
park-and-ride events use school buses here, and so the kids got to be in a <br/>
school bus.  Riding the city bus a couple of times put a fear of buses into <br/>
them for a while.  You have time to de-mystify some things.<br/>
<br/>
Going to plays or concerts at elementaries might help too.  We&#39;ve done that <br/>
when friends&#39; kids were performing, and my kids were surprised at the vast <br/>
numbers of kids seated in rows and told to shush, don&#39;t wiggle, pay <br/>
attention.  The school bells scared them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921363849">My daughter also went through this stage.  At first, while we were <br/>
swimming during the last warm days of September or the first warm <br/>
days of May, or while we were wandering an empty zoo during October, <br/>
or seeing the Christmas decorations during an uncrowded weekday in <br/>
December, I would remind her that if she were going to &quot;regular&quot; <br/>
school, she wouldn&#39;t be able to enjoy this.  &quot;Just think of your poor <br/>
friends sitting at a desk in a school right now.&quot; I would say.  That <br/>
seemed to pacify her for a while, but then she would start asking <br/>
about going to school again.<br/>
<br/>
Last summer I signed her up for a week long course, mornings only, at <br/>
my alma mater, Alverno, which was described as &quot;Harry Potter Wacky <br/>
Wizardry&quot; school.  She&#39;s a nut about Harry Potter and had enough Harry <br/>
Potter outfits for all five days.  The first day she went with her <br/>
Harry Potter backpack filled with a wizard&#39;s robe and hat and some <br/>
Bertie Botts every flavored beans we had bought at a novelty store. <br/>
She never opened it. The class turned out to be a kitchen science <br/>
class, all the home type of experiments that we&#39;d already done many <br/>
times as unschoolers.  Only one other child had a Harry Potter shirt <br/>
on and so did the teacher.  When I got to class to pick her up I got <br/>
to listen to the teacher droning on about what they would be doing <br/>
tomorrow (if she didn&#39;t forget any of the equipment like she had <br/>
today) while they sat quietly in their places, in a hot <br/>
unairconditioned room waiting for today to be finished.  By <br/>
Wednesday she chose not to wear a Harry Potter outfit, as no one else <br/>
was and that evening she asked if she could not go anymore, but I <br/>
convinced her to try one more day.  If she had really copped a fit, I <br/>
would have let her quit, but I wanted her to get a good taste of the <br/>
tedium of every day, every day, same old, same old.  She managed to <br/>
finish the entire week of the program and was pleased with herself for <br/>
finishing, but is now very glad that she never has to go to school.  I <br/>
think I&#39;m even off the hook for these short summer classes, too!</div>
