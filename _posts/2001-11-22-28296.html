<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201525408">Hi Tia!!  This is Skyra from hs-ca.  I just joined Unschooling-dotcom a<br/>
couple of days ago, but after watching/listening for the last 2 days, wonder<br/>
if I really want to be there at all!!!<br/>
<br/>
Is that list always so aggressive/sarcastic/antagonistic???  Or is there<br/>
actually some good information shared once and awhile?  Perhaps I am just<br/>
spoiled with being on hs-ca!!!   LOL<br/>
<br/>
I almost wrote a post to U.com but decided that it would probably be<br/>
responded to in the same disrespectful manner that seems so prevelant there<br/>
at the moment!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I am only asking because I am trying to decide whether to stay or<br/>
unsub.  It is such a high volume list, and if it is always so full of<br/>
bickering, I can&#39;t be bothered!!!  I came to hs-ca at the peak of a conflict<br/>
as well, and am thrilled to have stayed....I wonder if this would be the<br/>
case with this list as well?<br/>
<br/>
(please excuse the choppiness of this...as I am sick as a dog with the flu!!<br/>
:(  )<br/>
