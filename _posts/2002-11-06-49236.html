<div id="ygrps-yiv-163813357">You don&#39;t really need a GPS.  The web site has &quot;cheater&quot; instructions that <br/>
are a great help if you&#39;re somewhat familiar with the area.  We&#39;ve done <br/>
one in a city park that we were able to find with just the cheater <br/>
instructions.  I agree, it is quite fun.<br/>

I just have to tell you all about a really fun thing that we&#39;ve been<br/>
doing lately: geocaching.  Check out:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocaching.com">http://www.geocaching.com</a><br/>
<br/>
You need a GPS, a vehicle, and a whole lot of patience :).  There are<br/>
various &quot;caches&quot; around the world.  Some are virtual (where you find the<br/>
spot and note what you were supposed to find) and some have actual<br/>
treasure hidden.  This is like the ultimate treasure hunt and a whole<br/>
lot of fun.  I&#39;m sounding like a commercial.  You can look at the site<br/>
and do a search for how many are in your zipcode.  We are planning on<br/>
putting out our own cache sometime soon.  There are lots of rural and<br/>
urban ones.  We&#39;ve done several that were in city parks and one that was<br/>
just a sign in the middle of a bunch of businesses.<br/>

these GPS and what exactly are they?<br/>

Sorry if I sound too ignorant.<br/>
