<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Go interview with the head of the department. He may be able to<br/>
&gt; take <br/>
&gt;&gt; COLLEGE courses NOW, and have them count towards his<br/>
&gt; degree. What about<br/>
&gt;&gt; internships and auditing college classes?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Noah has audited one class. I hope he can enroll in one in the<br/>
&gt; next year or two (after he&#39;s driving).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was accepted at the university as a special student to take a class or so<br/>
a semester, starting when I was 15.  I studied music only at that time.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I was nearly 18 and graduated high school, I applied for a<br/>
&quot;change in status&quot;, a one-page form telling them I&#39;d like to be a &quot;regular<br/>
status&quot; student now.  A week later I received my change in status<br/>
confirmation in the mail.  It was very routine.<br/>
<br/>
I was almost a sophomore when I first attended full time, and they never<br/>
looked at my transcripts whatsoever.  I could have done it a semester<br/>
earlier and they&#39;d have never cared.<br/>
