<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028512678">Hi Sherry,<br/>
<br/>
I think you are doing the most wonderful thing possible for your<br/>
children....but then I&#39;m a little prejudiced  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you have 4 kids, you have all kinds of stuff going on all the time (I<br/>
know because I have 5).  For one week, simply write down whatever you see<br/>
the kids doing.  Keep tabs without making it a big deal so the kids don&#39;t<br/>
stress over it.  At the end of each day, &quot;translate&quot; what you see the kids<br/>
doing into schoolish-type subjects and see that the kids really ARE<br/>
learning.  This can be a big help with husbands who &quot;just don&#39;t get it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  My 11yo spent her morning so far this way, caring for her animals<br/>
(nutrition &lt;figuring what to feed each animal, adjusting protein for milk<br/>
goats&gt;, psychology &lt;operant conditioning used in training dog&gt;, math<br/>
&lt;figuring weight of milk minus weight of bucket&gt;, bacteriology &lt;working to<br/>
keep things as sterile as possible to avoid spoilage&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
next was a 4-H officers meeting (logistics &lt;planning who would bring what to<br/>
the Christmas party&gt;, penmanship &lt;keeping minutes&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
next finishing up redecorating her room (physics &lt;working out why a nail<br/>
wouldn&#39;t go into a wall&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
next bathing rabbits for a rabbit show tomorrow (health &lt;keeping them from<br/>
getting a chill&gt;, science &lt;quickest way to evaporate water out of rabbit<br/>
fur&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
All that with one kid, zero planning, zero &quot;lessons&quot; and it is only 11:55am<br/>
here.<br/>
