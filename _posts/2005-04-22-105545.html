<div id="ygrps-yiv-601264353">Hello, we have dedided to unschool our children, and after reading this <br/>
board, it seems that get togethers seem to be an integral part of the <br/>
program.  In one thread, someone expressed concern about &quot;fitting in&quot; <br/>
with an existing group.  I am curious about anyone who <br/>
has &quot;experimented&quot; with this by first having a play date with only one <br/>
other family, and then joining that other family&#39;s already established <br/>
group.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488187317">Unschooling/unschooling-friendly groups tend to be informal. Just show <br/>
up to a park day, see how you feel about what goes on there - how the <br/>
other parents treat their children is MY most important concern.<br/>
<br/>
A too-formally organized group, one with bylaws and membership <br/>
requirements, won&#39;t likely be a good fit for an unschooling family.<br/>
<br/>
If your children have qualms about going to a group, then getting <br/>
together with one of the families with kids about their age might be a <br/>
good way to start out.<br/>
<br/>
But, be patient when you go to the group - it can take a while for kids <br/>
to feel comfortable and make friends.<br/>
