<div id="ygrps-yiv-824524228">I was looking in the archive to find my intro to post on another list <br/>
and couldn&#39;t find one so I thought I post it here too.  Sorry if this <br/>
is a repeat.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Debbie, we brought my two oldest children back home when <br/>
they where going into 5th and 3rd grades.  That was 12 years ago, my <br/>
two younger children went to preschool for a couple of years before I <br/>
knew better then to succumb to in-law pressure.  My children are <br/>
James - 22 and not living at home, Angie  20, Monique  16 and Tony <br/>
 14 (who gave us a scare over reading, but taught me to trust my <br/>
instincts.)  My DH is a contract programmer and we have been married <br/>
16 + years.  He is the love of my life and truly my other half.  We <br/>
live in Riverside Co., Ca. with two cats, a gecko, and some fish.<br/>
<br/>
My family has been supportive of our homeschooling but our <br/>
unschooling was a bit hard for them to understand at first.  My in-<br/>
laws have come around these last few years after coming to our HS <br/>
support group activities.  I have had on-line support for years but <br/>
it was only after our move 5 years ago that I was able to find a <br/>
support group of like-minded HSers.<br/>
<br/>
I am at a point in my life (45) that I feel like one of the sweet <br/>
little old ladies who wants to tell young unsuspecting moms &quot;You know <br/>
dear you should..&quot;LOL.  Geez, if I knew then what I THINK I know <br/>
now.  I guess that&#39;s why parents are such different creatures when <br/>
they become grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
If you have gotten to this point thanks for &quot;listening&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Debbie</div>
