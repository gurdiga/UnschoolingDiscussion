&lt;&lt; I just wondered <br/>
<br/>
what if the kids, when they were three or four, had only wanted to <br/>
<br/>
learn to read and practice writing.  Would the entire course of <br/>
<br/>
homeschooling had gone more toward school-at-home for those <br/>
<br/>
families?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are early reading stories by unschoolers here (and some late reading <br/>
ones too):<br/>

&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading&quot;">http://sandradodd.com/reading&quot;</a>&gt;Learning to Read Naturally&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If others have stories they want to add to that site about how kids learned <br/>
to read without instruction, send the to me!<br/>
<br/>
We were unschooling before I knew if my kids would read early or not.  They <br/>
didn&#39;t.  Lots of their learning comes from the printed word, but not always <br/>
from a bound, paper book.  Sometimes online (does THIS reading anyone here is <br/>
doing count as &quot;reading&quot;?), sometimes in magazines, or correpondence.  <br/>
There&#39;s a glorified tradition of correspondence in this culture&#39;s history.  <br/>
Someone can almost cite as academic credentials &quot;correspondended with Tolkien <br/>
for some years&quot; (as my friend Keith Hunter&#39;s dad, a missionary in Pakistan, <br/>
could claim).  If you corresponded with a famous thinker, you might have <br/>
knowledge of insight that NOBODY else had.  That&#39;s cool.  Those letters get <br/>
published sometimes and everyone says &quot;ooooh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about not reading, it&#39;s about learning that reading is just <br/>
one of many ways to get information, not the best, not the main, not even <br/>
potentially the only.<br/>
<br/>
The dumbest question I have ever been asked by people asking about <br/>
unschooling is &quot;Do you use books?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Asking them to define &quot;use&quot; just caused their brains to completely overload <br/>
every time or they just stated their question differently as though *I* was <br/>
the one who was confused.<br/>

<br/>
Well maybe that&#39;s why he wrote those books, that he saw his own shortcomings <br/>
and wanted to give someone else the Cliff&#39;s Notes to Western Civilization!<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine in college had been raised Unitarian, third or fourth <br/>
generation Unitarian.<br/>
His parents were intellectual Yankees.  His mom had a Master&#39;s degree in <br/>
something hoity from Vassar, but she just cooked and amused her kids (and <br/>
their friends, and I was glad to be one of them, and the dad had a PhD in <br/>
nuclear this&#39;n&#39;that, and the kids had grown up in Richland WA and Los Alamos, <br/>
New Mexico.  They had math.  They had grammar with a vengeance.  They had <br/>
science fiction, medieval heraldry, and Gilbert and Sullivan. <br/>
<br/>
That was all.  <br/>
<br/>
Derek, though, came to be hanging out with me, and I could almost say not a <br/>
thing that he didn&#39;t look quizzical about.   Folkore, folkmusic, English <br/>
ballads, blues, rock&#39;n&#39;roll (TOTAL blank space in his experience), etc.  Not <br/>
one clue, though he was curious and interested.<br/>
<br/>
Though he&#39;s now himself a high paid computer geek in southern California, at <br/>
the time of our analysis of What&#39;s Derek&#39;s Problem, he was an English major <br/>
who kept on and KEPT on missing references and metaphors and analogies <br/>
because he knew NO Bible. Zip.  He knew less about Christianity than people <br/>
will learn walking through a mall because he had  never walked through a mall.<br/>
<br/>
So I used to tell him stories.  He wasn&#39;t embarrassed to ask me.  So I showed <br/>
him how to use a Bible to look things up.  Showed him the concordance and the <br/>
list of Bible books.  Told him the stories of Jacob and Esau, and of Job, and <br/>
showed him where to read them whole.  Told him about The Tower of Babel.<br/>
<br/>
HOW could he have missed all that?  He just did.<br/>
<br/>
Fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
He had two sisters and a brother. <br/>
Now he has three sisters.  YOU do the bio math.  <br/>
Both parents died of brain problems within just a few years of one another.<br/>
They had lived on the edge of a canyon in which nuclear waste used to be <br/>
dumped, when the labs were a &quot;just until the end of the war&quot; thing in the <br/>
1940&#39;s, and they never found a good time to tell people, &quot;Oh... by the way...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I learned a lot hanging around with that aberrantly-behaving family.<br/>

I haven&#39;t read further than the headlines that were on the CNN news <br/>
website, and so don&#39;t know lots of details. But my point too was, he <br/>
didn&#39;t do it in secret. It&#39;s a crying shame, and I&#39;m disgusted, and I <br/>
think he most likely did NOT confine himself to legal gambling...and, <br/>
when he was secretary of Education...it was MY money he was paying <br/>
his bills with...proceeds from his amazingly successful books...and <br/>
now profits from his K12 curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
And putting money into the pocket as David said, of organized crime. <br/>
I&#39;m very unhappy about it. <br/>

<br/>
So, Wm. Bennett et al built the K12 on Hirsch, eh? innat speshuul.<br/>

I found it amusing to read it alongside Susan Ohanian&#39;s scathing <br/>
remarks about Bennett et al in WHAT Happened to Recess and WHY are <br/>
our Chidren Struggling in Kindergarten?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, part two of the book is called &quot;The Core Curriculum&quot; and it <br/>
mentions all the same rhetoric in the front of any E.D. Hirsch book <br/>
(even giving identical examples) and on page 100 it says, &quot;The Core <br/>
Knowledge Sequence is the best content guide for the elementary <br/>
grades [K-8] that we have seen.&quot;  Every chapter for the next 200 <br/>
pages quotes extensively from the Core Knowledge Sequence.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
seen K12, but in Ohanian&#39;s work, the places that she quotes from it <br/>
line up perfectly with the Core Knowledge Sequence.<br/>

This is from the K12 website:  &quot;While the Core Knowledge Foundation <br/>
provides curricular guidelines, K12 goes much farther by providing a <br/>
fully developed and comprehensive curriculum&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, they used the Core Knowledge Sequence ($25) and <br/>
combined it with a selection of materials listed in Books to Build On <br/>
($13) and some lesson plans (available for free from the Baltimore <br/>
Curriculum Project) and I see that he charges about $1200 per grade <br/>
level.  <br/>
<br/>
I only wish I hadn&#39;t thought of it before he did; then I could afford <br/>
to blow $20 million dollars gambling.<br/>

we are both from Christian families} and then how we interpret them. <br/>
They have {and still do} go to church from time to time with their <br/>
granny because they like some of the kids there and want. <br/>
<br/>
We want them to question {even us} because we feel it will empower <br/>
them over all. Most of their extended family are Christian and we <br/>
live in NC { obvious part of the bible belt, home of Jessy Helms}. <br/>
It&#39;s just something around here that you can&#39;t help but hear about. <br/>
People are asked regularly {like I heard many here say }&quot;Whut Church <br/>
do you go to?&quot; It&#39;s assumed that&#39;s what you are.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sorcha<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel like *I* was scammed, because we got into K12 via the <br/>
Idaho Virtual Acadamy, a charter school. (&quot;free&quot; or &quot;already paid for <br/>
by my taxes&quot; was a justification I used when we joined) <br/>
<br/>
We got TONS of stuff: books, work pages, clay, tempera paints, good <br/>
paintbrushes, art paper, plaster of paris, supplies for many science <br/>
projects, a package of tissue paper in the full spectrum of colors <br/>
(we made snowflakes with a fraction of that paper), pastels, crayons, <br/>
markers, pencils, sketch pads, poster board...when we withdrew from <br/>
IDVA, we sent back the &quot;non-consumables&quot; (mostly books, and avail. in <br/>
the library) and kept the art stuff :) I also kept the fourth grade <br/>
desk map, even though it is a non-consumable. Very high quality map, <br/>
world on one side, U.S. on the other, political boundaries. <br/>
<br/>
but all that stuff just wasn&#39;t worth the hassle of &quot;talking with the <br/>
teacher&quot; every two weeks; the mandate that we turn in samples of the <br/>
kids&#39; work (when I withdrew, I mentioned that specifically in an <br/>
email to my &quot;teacher&quot; and THAT WAS CHANGED!!! they no longer require <br/>
work samples to be turned in to the &quot;teacher.&quot; :D And, of course, my <br/>
attitude about the fill in the blank nonsense, busy work, keep em <br/>
busy at their desks...the thing was not designed for homeschool, nor <br/>
even for school at home, with kids of different ages doing different <br/>
things. It had clear markings of being something for a roomful of <br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
And...if you believe that there&#39;s knowledge that is a &quot;must&quot;, then <br/>
the Core Knowledge series is a good guideline to follow. It makes <br/>
sense for K12 not to reinvent the wheel, but follow an already <br/>
developed guideline. I don&#39;t have a prob with MR. Bennett using the <br/>
Core Knowledge...but your point about how much the K12 costs, <br/>
compared with the resources at the foundation, is well taken.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I have changed what I think about the concept of certain <br/>
things being &quot;necessary for a well rounded education.&quot; And so, the <br/>
further I can get away from K12-style thinking, the better!<br/>

Oh, heck, if you didn&#39;t pay $1200+ for it, then no problem.  I <br/>
thought you paid that much for something you could have gotten for <br/>
$38 and a library card.  I bought the Sequence and Books to Build On <br/>
(which actually has some neat recommendations), but after looking <br/>
through it and pondering awhile, I came to the conclusion that <br/>
cultural literacy isn&#39;t something that needs to be taught.  If you <br/>
live here, you&#39;ll pick it up on accident.  It might be useful to my <br/>
family if we just moved to the United States, but we&#39;ve lived here <br/>
for generations and my kids don&#39;t really need to study our culture.  <br/>
The reason it appealed to me so much is because it&#39;s all stuff I <br/>
know.  I&#39;d look through it and say, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;d love to read Grimm&#39;s <br/>
Fairy Tales with my children!&quot; or whatever.  But I already own the <br/>
complete tales, and I don&#39;t need to write it on a lesson planner to <br/>
remember to tell them fairy tales.  My grandfather, who had to drop <br/>
out of school after second grade to work in the coal mines, told me <br/>
fairy tales and recited all the nursery rhymes for me, and he didn&#39;t <br/>
need a scope and sequence to do it.<br/>

Gotcha.<br/>
<br/>
I met a nice hippie couple from rural outskirts of Gallup, New Mexico.   They <br/>
said their daughter&#39;s the only non-Indian kid at Laguna/Acoma high school.  <br/>
They used to homeschool, but she&#39;s really liking that school.  They said they <br/>
were a little worried about what she might be missing.  I said she was <br/>
missing NOTHING, but gaining something others couldn&#39;t get for any amount of <br/>
money or study.   I asked if she was hanging out at the pueblos and getting <br/>
invited to feasts.  Oh yeah, they said, just lately a deer dance.  Well there <br/>
y&#39;go.<br/>
<br/>
I met them because Holly and I found a crate of books on the road.  They were <br/>
elementary  music-teacher things.  I wouldn&#39;t have minded having some of <br/>
that, if they were unclaimed.  Lots of recorder and guitar and keyboard <br/>
stuff!  <br/>
<br/>
And I went through looking for a name, found a photocopy of a receipt for her <br/>
having bought some guitars, and called the number thinking it was someone in <br/>
the neighborhood.  <br/>
<br/>
No, their car had been stolen at gunpoint from their house that morning at <br/>
4:00 a.m. and the state police had assured them the guy had gone south.  Huh. <br/>
 Apparently he went EAST, and for some reason gently set her crate of <br/>
teacher-stuff out in the road a couple of blocks from my house.  The state <br/>
police wanted to take the crate for evidence and I talked them out of it.  At <br/>
least they got something back that way.  My winning argument was I was pretty <br/>
sure car thieves weren&#39;t going through seeing if any of those books were <br/>
worth selling at the used book store, so they weren&#39;t going to find any <br/>
fingerprints but mine, and meanwhile she wouldn&#39;t have the stuff she needed <br/>
for her job.<br/>
<br/>
Often the best stories happen when people are not trying to be part of good <br/>
stories.  I liked those people a lot.  We had a good visit when they came <br/>
over.<br/>
