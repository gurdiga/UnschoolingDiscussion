&lt;&lt; -=-What would you as experienced unschoolers tell a bunch of people who <br/>

<br/>
never heard of homeschooling and live in a country where homeschooling is<br/>
<br/>
illegal? -=- &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Been there.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, one person, not a bunch of people.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend my same age to the day who&#39;s from Germany and he has <br/>
teenagers older than mine.  He was intensely interested in my kids and my beliefs, and <br/>
when he said sadly that homeschooling was impossible in Germany I said this:<br/>
<br/>
Bummer.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing else to say.<br/>
<br/>
Germany is Germany.    Good luck with your efforts there!   <br/>
<br/>
Learning is learning.  No government can keep a child from learning for fun.  <br/>
Even in the presence of school, parents CAN help their children see learning <br/>
as an entertaining thing IF the parents can learn to see how children learn <br/>
playing video games or digging for worms or building paper airplanes.<br/>
<br/>
Even in Germany, those with an inclination to understand math and think <br/>
mathematically learn math in classrooms because at one level they already knew it.  <br/>
Some of them would have learned it without the classroom.  The division of <br/>
polynomials, or at least any particularly recommended method, was thought up by <br/>
an individual who did NOT learn it in school.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics is not arithmetical facts.  It&#39;s a way of seeing patterns in the <br/>
world.   School breaks down some kids&#39; naturally-forming patterns, tells them <br/>
NO, they know nothing, forget what they&#39;re thinking, just do what the teacher <br/>
tells you.<br/>
<br/>
That is taking a natural dancer and saying &quot;STOP DOING THAT, just step once <br/>
to the left in time to the music with everyone else, until next year when we <br/>
let you step TWICE.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
School can kill natural intellect, or smother it stupid, and as long as a <br/>
child&#39;s test scores are good, nobody has the decency to be deeply ashamed about <br/>
it.  The teachers and administrators and test designers and textbook authors <br/>
and publishers collect their paychecks and go home.  The children go home and <br/>
cry.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has no paycheck to pick up.  Families often pay for the <br/>
privilege, in loss of wages, in pressure from neighbors and friends, in estrangement <br/>
from families.<br/>
<br/>
People wouldn&#39;t do that for nothing.  They do it because it&#39;s important and <br/>
they see the value in and to their children.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something about kids in school by their own choice.  Perhaps it could <br/>
be adapted, at a philosophical level, to families whose children are in school <br/>
but who don&#39;t wish to fully cooperate at every level.<br/>

If you look here and see anything you&#39;d like to use, I could ask my friend <br/>
Wolfgang Marquardt to translate it for you.  He knows me in person and knows my <br/>
voice and that might help him word it in the way I would have said it.  I tend <br/>
to write as I speak.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810457235">I&#39;m glad I happened to join the list during this conversation, it makes<br/>
me feel a bit better about introducing myself.  I heard about the list<br/>
from someone on another list recently and it sounded very interesting<br/>
even though my kids and I actually go to school every day during the<br/>
school year, them as students and I as a teacher.<br/>
            I myself was homeschooled started at the age of 10.  For the<br/>
first year or possibly two, we (my older brother and I) had assignments,<br/>
tons of books to read and papers to write, workbooks, etc.  After that,<br/>
we were seemingly forgotten about as my younger brothers began learning<br/>
to read and such and were &quot;accidentally unschooled&quot; as I like to call<br/>
it.  I started taking community college classes at 13, and started doing<br/>
random rebellious things to mess up my life at about 16.  When I was 17<br/>
I took the California High School Proficiency Exam to obtain a diploma<br/>
although I already had plenty of college units.  I eventually had a<br/>
baby, finished college at a normal time, with excellent grades, and got<br/>
a teaching credential.  When I was pregnant and single at 18, teaching<br/>
seemed like an excellent career choice since I enjoyed school, loved<br/>
learning, and would have plenty of time off with my kid(s).  Since then<br/>
I have gotten married to a single-dad, and we have had another kid.<br/>
            Our kids are now 12, 8, and 4, all boys.  I have taught full<br/>
time for 2 years, jr. high at a private school which my kids attend.<br/>
When I got my contract for next year, I tried to talk my kids into<br/>
staying home and unschooling.  The oldest really wants to continue at<br/>
the private school for junior high, the middle one waffled back and<br/>
forth with maybe a slight preference for staying home, and the youngest<br/>
would probably love staying home, but also usually loves going to school<br/>
- especially since he can often come see mommy at her classroom, or see<br/>
his brothers during recesses, etc.  Unfortunately in this situation it&#39;s<br/>
all or nothing because without my teacher&#39;s 93% tuition discount there<br/>
is no way we could afford to send anyone to this school.  So I signed<br/>
the contract for at least another year.  I don&#39;t want to be a teacher,<br/>
because I don&#39;t believe in the educational system.  However, I<br/>
absolutely love the kids and getting to know them and I enjoy the<br/>
subject matter.  I also enjoy being out of the house every day (summer<br/>
vacation drives me nuts sometimes, having too much time on my hands and<br/>
starting massive projects and overturning the house).  Whether I teach<br/>
or not, someone is going to be force-feeding them algebra and physical<br/>
science and I am probably the lesser of many evils, lol.<br/>
            I am interested in this list because I think unschooling is<br/>
the best way to learn although I realize it will never happen in most<br/>
families.  I believe in non-coercion in general, especially when it<br/>
comes to learning.  I have read Guerilla Learning and have ordered<br/>
Coloring Outside the Lines.  I am interested in helping my children to<br/>
really learn what they want to learn despite the fact that they will be<br/>
in school.<br/>
            I have much more to say, but need to stop for now.<br/>
Hopefully my input will be tolerated on this list, and I hope to learn<br/>
much from you all.<br/>
Sarah<br/>

Hi, Sarah --<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to your position a little bit from both sides.  My husband<br/>
teaches 9th grade English and I am sometimes guilty of trying to help<br/>
him find ways to lure the kids into learning against their will. <br/>
(Mostly what I do is look for interesting short stories and articles for<br/>
the kids to read, but still it rubs a bit against the unschooling grain.)<br/>
<br/>
I belong to a very tiny local support group where we have only 3 or 4<br/>
families at the average park day, and one of the moms is putting her son<br/>
back in school and going back to teaching.  We are going to miss her a lot!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450922608">**If the kids have to be there, making what they do surprising and<br/>
intriguing <br/>
and interesting is what EVERY teacher should be doing.  Those are the<br/>
only <br/>
things they will remember, the things that shocked them or amused them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should feel bad about that.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK!  I was just reading a short Sandra Cisneros piece, Snow, set during<br/>
the Cuban missile crisis and thinking about &quot;duck and cover drills&quot;.<br/>
Potentially he could tell the 9th graders about those, and offer to let<br/>
them see if they can squish themselves under their desks (in case of<br/>
nuclear war).  (I was only a 2nd grader when we did these drills and<br/>
never tried to fit at an older age.)  Then he could promise that he&#39;ll<br/>
never knowingly teach them anything that dumb.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031133455">I can see where you&#39;re coming from.  But, if your dh wasn&#39;t there<br/>
teaching them, they would still be in school with another teacher.<br/>
There&#39;s no helping that situation except for him to do the best he can<br/>
at what his profession requires of him.  You are doing what you feel is<br/>
best for your own children.  That doesn&#39;t mean other peoples&#39; children<br/>
don&#39;t deserve a decent teacher in the situation they are forced into!<br/>
And I would love to have a helpful spouse offering creative ideas - what<br/>
a resource!<br/>

Thanks, Sarah.  My shameful unschooling secret is that I have some kind<br/>
of deepseated urge to design unit studies.  My died-in-the-wool<br/>
unschooling kid looks at my bookish idea and lets me know (like Dorothy<br/>
Parker&#39;s cartoon) &quot;I think it&#39;s spinach and I say to hell with it&quot;.  So<br/>
I vent the unit study ideas on my teacher dh who filters them and uses a<br/>
small fraction in his classroom.  This spares my ds from being the<br/>
target of my unfettered bibliomania. <br/>
