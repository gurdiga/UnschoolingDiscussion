<br/>
Yes, I even have some finished sets ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
I should have LOTS of finished sets to take to Sacramento, but I don&#39;t.  <br/>
After Friday night my time opens up again for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I did have a pay pal just-click-here function but changing websites and being <br/>
confused about the fine print of the long agreement, I just abandoned that <br/>
for now.  Still, I do have a paypal account, so you could do that if you <br/>
want, or send me a check <br/>

They come in boxes I screen printed myself, in bags I packed myself, with two <br/>
insert papers which are even better than the sticks...  (I&#39;m not good at self <br/>
promotion; I&#39;m shy about stuff that says GIVE ME MONEY.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388704046">... and they&#39;re really cool. I ordered a set several months ago and we get<br/>
them out occasionally. It helps to have a computer, dictionary, or<br/>
encyclopedia nearby because you&#39;re always running off to look up things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780795968">I bought Thinking Sticks last year.  They are so fun.  My husband and I find <br/>
that they are great memory jump-starters......... off we go on some rabbit <br/>
trail and never do complete a game.  Can you actually finish a game?<br/>
  My teenagers enjoy them as well as the 5 yo.  My 5yo dd likes to sort them <br/>
by colors.   Thinking Sticks is the most portable game, we almost always take <br/>
them when we go out of town.     <br/>
  The material enclosed with the sticks is wonderful!  I&#39;ve gotten all <br/>
excited about these again, I think I&#39;ll go play a game.<br/>

<br/>
If you went on a rabbit trail, the sticks did their job. <br/>
<br/>
A game!?  It&#39;s a game??   I thought it was a memory prodder for real life! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634918501">I just joined this group and haven&#39;t even introduced myself yet. The<br/>
thinking sticks sounded interesting, so I went to the website and still<br/>
don&#39;t know what thinking sticks are. How about a short description?<br/>
 <br/>
My son, husband & I are in our 7th year of homeschooling. We live in the<br/>
mountains of Colorado, very near the Hayman Fire, where we raise dairy<br/>
goats and have horses, dogs, cats, chickens and tropical fish. Travis<br/>
participates in Boy Scouts, 4H, Gymkhanas, and whatever sport is in<br/>
season. We start high school this year and I felt that we needed some<br/>
more support for the coming years. We are actually more of the eclectic<br/>
homeschoolers variety than unschoolers, but I have an open mind on the<br/>
subject. I&#39;m looking forward to getting great ideas from you all.<br/>

They&#39;re sticks with words on both sides of them.  You throw two (or three, <br/>
when you get good) down and make a connection between the two ideas/things.  <br/>
They&#39;re for divergent thinking and to help people realize that everything in <br/>
the whole wide world is basically one big topic.  <br/>

Instead of having a palm pilot or an appointment book, I have a kitchen-wall <br/>
calendar and websites.   My husband checks my website to add to his calendar <br/>
(which he keeps on his computer at work).  Ah, modern days (and <br/>
disorganization...)  I&#39;ve never had a calendar book I didn&#39;t lose within a <br/>
month, but websites tend to stay where you leave them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943420072">Kelly loaned me her&#39;s.  She had made supplimental<br/>
sticks....a large portion of these had....you guessed<br/>
it.... dog breeds. Some really obscure, some rare, and<br/>
some new ones.  I had to look them up :-) The whole<br/>
idea is great. You can, like Kelly, add subjects of<br/>
your own interest and make connections to eveything<br/>
else. They are fun to do alone, too.<br/>
