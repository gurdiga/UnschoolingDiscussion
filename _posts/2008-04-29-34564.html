<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979502548">Registration is now open for the 2nd Annual Unschoolers Winter Waterpark Gathering (UWWG) at Sandusky, Ohio&#39;s  Kalahari Resort, Feb. 2 - 6, 2009!     <br/>
   <br/>
  Go to our new UWWG website:  ugoevent.com<br/>
   <br/>
  Join unschooolers from around the country for a fun week among other unschoolers at the largest indoor waterpark in America! Their waterpark includes everything from lazy river rides, wave pool for surfing and boogie boarding, to giant water slides and thrilling water coasters.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thats not all.  There will be plenty of opportunities for families to connect with other unschoolers during the week.  At no additional cost, our  UWWG families will have exclusive use of the Executive Conference rooms where funshops, discussions and social gatherings will be held.  Add in talent shows, movie nights, plus an unforgettable night of dancing in the Grand Ballroom and you have a week that cant be missed!!<br/>
   <br/>
  Our super discounted rooms rates include several types of hotel style rooms along with multiroom full kitchen suites, which were by far our most requested rooms last year (they average out to be only $21.50 per person per night and includes your waterpark passes and participation in all UWWG events!).  <br/>
   <br/>
      <br/>
     The Kalahari Resort has extended our discounted room rates to also include Sunday, Feb. 1, for those wanting to arrive a day early!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
     Plus, NO  registration or conference fees!!!<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
  Last year&#39;s gathering was our first and was a big succuss.  It ballooned into a gathering of over 1000 unschoolers from 19 states and Canada!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Here are a few comments from some who attended our first UWWG:<br/>
   <br/>
    ·         The trip was WELL worth everything and anything we put into it.  The Kalahari was very welcoming and the entire facility was top notch. The only changes were making next year is leaving a day early and bringing an extra set of hands! (Gramma!).   I would definitely recommend this gathering for unschoolers next year. The Kalahari gave us a SPECTACULAR group rate that we couldnt beat anywhere. We had more fun in this trip then we have had in a very long time!!! Not an empty minute went by. We are refreshingly exhausted.<br/>

  ·         We had a terrific time at the waterpark! The kids said to us, I swear EVERY night, &quot;thanks for bringing us here,&quot; and &quot;this is the BEST vacation!&quot; <br/>
             Dana (& Chris) M.  Pennsylvania<br/>
   <br/>
  ·         From the moment we arrived at the Kalahari Waterpark Resort in Sandusky, Ohio we had a complete blast.  . . . . <br/>
        We will definitely go back next year  the conference was worth the drive from New Mexico!<br/>

   <br/>
   ·        . . .  We LOVED it.  And already can&#39;t wait for next year!  Carol - from your initial email, I am sure you never expected such a smashing success. We are so happy!!   And we&#39;ve made so many new friends - life is good! Thanks.<br/>
  Jessie V. - Indiana<br/>

  ·         We all had a blast. There were several families from the Columbus area, we all had a great, wonderful, exciting, rewarding...ok you get the picture, time. We had to drag our teens away.... <br/>
            Laura B.  Ohio<br/>
   <br/>
  ·         We are also looking forward to next year.  The kids are going to ask for the whole week from Santa Claus :). Thank you,<br/>
