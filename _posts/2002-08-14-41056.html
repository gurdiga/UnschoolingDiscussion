<div id="ygrps-yiv-258565557">I&#39;ve been noticing some posts today that might not have been written if the <br/>
poster had read all their mail first.  The one I&#39;m thinking of was about <br/>
letting Ned stay.  As far as I can tell, the &quot;Ned Problem&quot; has already been <br/>
resolved.<br/>
<br/>
One way that I use to avoid this kind of thing is to read through all the <br/>
posts first, saving any that I think I&#39;ll want to respond to.  Then when I <br/>
go back to respond, I usually delete at least half of them because someone <br/>
else has said what I wanted to say, or the issue has been resolved one way <br/>
or another.<br/>
