<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500969798">Please pray for this family. They need all of our prayers for the road that <br/>
lie ahead. Keep them in your thoughts and pray that whatever the outcome, God <br/>
will be the center of their lives, and hold them together. We all pray that <br/>
this is never &quot;our family&quot;, how terrible it is that it is ANY family. <br/>
In HIS Service-<br/>

        I think that I will move closer to the gym, that way between sets,<br/>
        I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>
     Believe in others, and be a part; believe in yourself, and be the lead. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am asking you all, begging you to please forward this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; email on to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone and everyone. As most all of you know, I have a 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; year old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daughter named Kelsey Brooke Jones.  We are from Southern<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Minnesota. She<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has been missing since 4pm Oct.11, 1999. The police were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; notified<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shortly after. If anyone anywhere knows anything, sees<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pleeeeaaaase contact me if you have my number. The police<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommend I put my number online, but you can contact the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Police, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missing persons report has been filed. I am including a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; picture of her.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All prayers are appreciated!!  Thank you, Amy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
