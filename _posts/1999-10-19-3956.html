<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491109303">OK, I&#39;ve had a few minutes to review my notes from the LLL get-together I<br/>
went to on Saturday.  The guest speaker (a really nice guy) was Prof Peter<br/>
Fleming, an expert in infant development, talking about safety in infant<br/>
sleep.  The gist of the research he shared with us is that &#39;full&#39;<br/>
co-sleeping, ie, having baby in your bed (or you in his) 100% of the time,<br/>
is protective against SIDS, UNLESS one or both parents smoke, or have drunk<br/>
alcohol, which are BIG risk factors.  Room-sharing is protective whether<br/>
parents smoke or drink or not, but having baby in a seperate room is a risk.<br/>
Using duvets is a risk, but babies were only found with covers over their<br/>
heads in cots.  Parents awareness of potential overheating is protective<br/>
against SIDS.<br/>
<br/>
Some sleep lab research found that babies who were co-sleeping, even though<br/>
the air temperatue around their bodies was higher, they had lower core<br/>
temperatures than the cot-sleeping babies.  The sleep lab research also<br/>
showed that even in mothers who did not regularly co-sleep, sleep patterns<br/>
matched their babies,&#39; meaning that the babies&#39; wakeful periods coincided<br/>
with the mothers,&#39; instead of disrupting her pattern.<br/>
<br/>
 Co-sleeping on sofas is a BIG risk, (perhaps not of SIDS, but of<br/>
suffocation) but the possible circumstances of co-sleeping on sofas, ie<br/>
possible drunkenness, extreme tiredness, social depravation (ie lack of bed)<br/>
may contrbute greater than the actual sofa itself.  (But softness of sleep<br/>
surface is an issue too)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and BTW, Prof Fleming was at the CPSC meeting when the data which the<br/>
recent report condemning co-sleeping as unsafe was received, and he decried<br/>
the report as utterly unsound, there was no depth to the data, no analysis,<br/>
and it was not appropriate to publish such a strong statement either for or<br/>
against any sleeping practices based on this data.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this clears a few things up/ sets minds at ease.  Oh, and the study<br/>
only covered children up to 1yo, and most deaths occured between 2 and 3mo,<br/>
and between 5 and 10am, particularly between 6 and 7am.  I can go into<br/>
greater detail, but since the research hasn&#39;t been published yet, I didn&#39;t<br/>
want to put the whole lot &#39;over the wires&#39; as it were.  Anyone who wants to<br/>
know has only to ask :-)<br/>
