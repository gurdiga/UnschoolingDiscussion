&lt;&lt; Oh I would also LOVE to hear what about everyones &quot;unschooling days&quot;, I <br/>
 realize all days are different, but just pick one out and tell us about it.  <br/>
 :O)<br/>
 <br/>
  This is so funny.  As I was driving around today, I thought...this is the <br/>
kind of day I&#39;d love to tell about if somebody online would ask that &quot;typical <br/>
day question.&quot;  And I go online tonight...and what are you asking but for a <br/>
recounting of our day.  So, here goes... Hope you don&#39;t get winded reading <br/>
this.  I have 7 kids, so its kind of hard to be brief!<br/>
6:00 a.m.-Mom nurses baby while reading book about dinosaurs to 4yo. 6yo is <br/>
out in living room playing Legos.<br/>
6:30 a.m.-Mom does exercises from t.v. while baby plays on floor with 6 <br/>
yo-4yo is now in Mom&#39;s bed playing dinosaurs in the bed covers-everybody else <br/>
is still sleeping<br/>
7:00-Mom in shower-baby is in seat in bathroom with her-4yo and 6 yo are <br/>
playing Star Wars-get a little unfriendly-they&#39;re very competitive<br/>
7:30-13yo, 11yo, 9 yo and 2 yo drag out of bed because they know we have <br/>
morning plans.  Otherwise the 3 oldest would sleep in longer.  We all do <br/>
basic chores together...feed pets, fold some laundry, pick up stray things <br/>
left out last night, empty wastebaskets, get breakfast<br/>
8:30-In the van -13 and 9 yo have rehearsal for &quot;Sound of Music&quot; put on by <br/>
local music teacher-11yo is out on 5 mile bike ride-we will pick him up on <br/>
our way home-we listen to &quot;Boomerang&quot; tape in car-this one is about <br/>
Bosnia-the kids really learn a lot from these cassettes-have a long <br/>
discussion about anatomy with 6yo-this is his current passion-discuss show <br/>
about eagles we watched on PBS last night and contemplate why one eagle would <br/>
kill another<br/>
9:30-home again- 11 yo gets out golf clubs and shoots out in yard-6 yo puts <br/>
on Star Wars costume (his own creation!) and plays by himself in yard-4yo <br/>
gets out playdough-2 yo draws with markers and joins in with playdough after <br/>
awhile-Mom folds laundry-watches a talk show on t.v. and irons.<br/>
10:00-11 yo works on bike-comes in to get a bike repair manual to check how <br/>
to tighten a certain bolt-4yo goes out to help him<br/>
10:30-11 yo wants to make chocolate chip cookies-looks up recipes-makes dough <br/>
and puts away to bake later-not enough time to finish now-6 yo comes in and <br/>
is making &quot;battle signs&quot; for his Star War&#39;s characters-4 yo goes back to <br/>
playdough-2 yo plays with Bingo games which is her &quot;money&quot;<br/>
11:00-back in van to go get other kids-listen to Boomerang again-get to <br/>
church where kids are and they are not ready-11yo goes in to listen to <br/>
rehearsal-6yo and 4 yo shoot some hoops with Mom in the parking lot. 2 yo and <br/>
baby doze in van<br/>
11:30-kids are done-get in car-13yo stays at church because music teacher <br/>
wants her to help younger kids rehearse in the afternoon-rest of gang makes <br/>
it home.<br/>
12:00-11 yo makes lunch while Mom feeds baby.  6, 4 and 9 yo play Legos in <br/>
living room-Star Wars, what else??  We all eat lunch and listen to <br/>
music(classical) which the 9 yo picked, on tape.<br/>
12:30-2yo, 4 yo and baby nap-11 yo gets out Key to Fractions, which he loves, <br/>
and does a couple of pages.  We go over it together and play a game of <br/>
finding common factors.  9yo reads Harry Potter to 6 yo.<br/>
1:00-9 yo writes thank-you to Grandma, goes to visit neighbor who is home <br/>
from work recovering from cancer surgery; 11yo reads books about farms-takes <br/>
out sketch pad and draws tractors-6 yo plays with Playmobil pirate ship in <br/>
basement<br/>
2:00-11,9 and 6 yo help Mom bake cookies and clean up kitchen-other kids <br/>
still napping.<br/>
2:30-all pile in the car again (with cookies) to go get 13yo from <br/>
rehearsal-11 yo gets map from glove compartment to read-asks me to drive his <br/>
bike ride path from this a.m. so he can calculate mileage-we listen to <br/>
Boomerang again.<br/>
3:00-pick up 13yo from rehearsal-drive to gas station where 11 yo pumps <br/>
gas-9yo figures out how much gas we get for $10.00 at $1.38 per gallon.  We <br/>
park and tour the place because it&#39;s a brand new huge truck stop and the kids <br/>
want to see what&#39;s here.  We discuss the difference between diesel and <br/>
regular fuel and my 13yo notices the difference in price.<br/>
3:30-13 and 9 yo dropped off at public library to read until another music <br/>
rehearsal (a different group)-rest of us drive to see a house we are thinking <br/>
about purchasing-Mom explains mortgages to 11 yo and uses an amortization <br/>
chart from a newspaper ad in the car to show how much it would cost to assume <br/>
a mortgage on this place.  On the way home, we calculate how many miles it <br/>
would be for 11yo to ride his bike from this new place to a friend&#39;s house <br/>
down the road.<br/>
4:00-Home again-Mom nurses baby and reads to 2, 4 yo-6 yo is designing a <br/>
sword that he can make out of wood-11yo resumes work on bicycle<br/>
4:30-Dad comes home from work-hears that a pig we recently bought to have <br/>
butchered is ready for pick-up-he and the 11yo sit down and figure out the <br/>
price per lb. and look in the paper for hog prices to see if we got a good <br/>
deal.  6 yo shows us his design of a &quot;King Arthur sword&quot;- 4yo plays in <br/>
basement with playmobil and 2yo is drawing again.  Mom makes dinner.<br/>
5:00-11 yo folds laundry (his chore this week)-Dad plays with baby and 2 yo-4 <br/>
and 6 yo are in basement looking for materials to make this sword creation.<br/>
5:15-Dad goes to pick up 9 yo from hand chime practice-takes 4 yo to <br/>
bank-lets him write his name on extra deposit slip<br/>

paint their &quot;creation&quot; downstairs-9 yo plays piano and then 13 yo does.<br/>
7:00-Mom reads aloud ballads from Rudyard Kipling to 11 and 13 yo.  Plays <br/>
word etymology game with 13 yo-9 yo draws tractors on sketch pad-Dad reads to <br/>
4,6,2 yo.<br/>
7:30-little ones go to bed-6yo asks Mom to copy down story he dictates about <br/>
his created &quot;Star War&#39;s characters.  11 yo and 13 yo play piano, 9 yo <br/>
practices lines from Sound of Music.<br/>
8:00-11 yo gets out map collection and finds a topographical map of our <br/>
county-discusses it with Mom, Dad and 13 yo-6yo goes to bed after listening <br/>
to a book about human anatomy-9 yo gets out sketch pad again and draws <br/>
tractors<br/>
8:30-Mom and 13 yo outline plans for a presentation we are doing next week at <br/>
a &quot;homeschool information night&quot;  13 yo writes up plan on computer-11 and 9 <br/>
yo draw and read tractor books<br/>
9:00-11 yo and 9 yo go to bed-13 yo goes online to talk to friends -Dad and <br/>
Mom discuss &quot;Angela&#39;s Ashes&quot; and read newspaper together<br/>
9:30-Dad to bed-13 yo reads Brian Jacques-Mom calls a friend and then goes <br/>
online to answer mail.<br/>
10:00-13 yo to bed-Mom stays up to read and take a bath!<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t completely typical for us-we usually don&#39;t have this many outside <br/>
activities-but the things we did at home were pretty usual. Almost all of <br/>
these things was kid-directed, too.  We do, in a house with 7 kids, however, <br/>
require certain chores to be done and we have set bedtimes, too.  Just works <br/>
better for us. <br/>
 Hope I didn&#39;t bore anybody-this was fun for me, so just ignore it if you <br/>
want!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193519832">WOW Carol,<br/>
Am exhausted reading about your day!!! my jaw is on the floor with awe and<br/>
amazement!! Actually, it was sooo great to read about your day;once my shock<br/>
wore off *grin* I tried doing a similar example of a &quot;typical&quot; day (single<br/>
mom, four kids!) and like you, I was greatly heartened at how much learning<br/>
does take place!!<br/>

Thanks for sharing, I really enjoyed it.  Boy, reading about your day <br/>
exhausted me.  Not because it was long, but you&#39;ve really got a handful.  <br/>
Keep up the good work.<br/>

Just so you are not too amazed...I was exhausted too and today we completely <br/>
zoned out...sat around reading Johnny Tremain and playing games and I for one <br/>
 barely made it off the couch until afternoon!<br/>
But I do agree that it&#39;s a good exercise every so often (especially when <br/>
discouraged) to really take a look at all the &quot;learning&quot; we are doing!<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to read other &quot;typical days.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895443271">Hi all-<br/>
<br/>
People are asking about Boomerang.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an audio kid&#39;s magazine-comes out once a month.  We don&#39;t subscribe <br/>
because our library carries it-so check there first unless you have all kinds <br/>
of money to spend!  I think a subscription is fairly expensive-$40 to $50 a <br/>
year, but of course, you can listen to these tapes over and over again.<br/>
I think the website is Boomkids.com.  If that&#39;s not it, please e-mail me and <br/>
I&#39;ll find out.  I don&#39;t have time right now to look.  My 2 1/2 yo is <br/>
complaining of an earache.<br/>
It&#39;s a great mag...my kids love it!  It&#39;s targeted to middle age kids, but my <br/>
6yo learns from it, too!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, you got such a good look at &quot;typical&quot; from the two examples I saw -- <br/>
because they were so different -- but here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we (me and 6 3/4 yo son and  5 yo daughter):<br/>
Filled the bird feeder.<br/>
Checked/watered the garden.<br/>
Did math on-line.<br/>
Son read (way too many) jokes from Big Book of Jokes.<br/>
Went to Tae Kwon Do class.<br/>
Went to library. (Or was that Monday.)<br/>
Re-organized book shelves in garage and sorted out &quot;baby&quot; books to give away.<br/>
Daughter worked in math book and and learned about graphs; made her own <br/>
graphs; said they were like music; son made and discussed ways graphs are <br/>
used -- heartbeat and earthquakes and stock market.  Lots of very messy graph <br/>
paper!<br/>
Read a couple of library books.<br/>
Played in sandbox.<br/>
Practiced piano.<br/>
<br/>
And probably more that I have forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
It it different every day.  <br/>
