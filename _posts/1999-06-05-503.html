<div id="ygrps-yiv-218349346">I think it is a *rare* person who works in the Education field who will<br/>
support anything related to homeschooling. It&#39;s their bread-and-butter.<br/>
It&#39;s their legacy, their baby, their sacred cow. People in Education are<br/>
threatened greatly by homeschoolers. Especially their pride.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important for homeschoolers to be sensitive to the fact<br/>
that there *is* good stuff happening in public education ~ in some<br/>
places. There *are* teachers who &quot;get out of the way&quot; (as John Gatto put<br/>
it) thereby allowing students to truly learn. But they are the exception<br/>
and not the norm. <br/>
<br/>
Overall, public education is America is dying a slow, painful death.<br/>
It&#39;s top heavy. I heard someone say the other day that the public school<br/>
system in the United States is going to collapse beneath the weight of<br/>
itself. How true. How many Superintendents and Assistant Superintendents<br/>
and Principals and Assistant Principals (the list goes on and on) are<br/>
there in *your* school district? It&#39;s *unreal* the number of people it<br/>
takes to &quot;do&quot; school. I can&#39;t figure out what 98% of them actually do.<br/>
And then there&#39;s the Education Department in Washington ~ don&#39;t get me<br/>
started! :o)<br/>
<br/>
I believe that there *are* public school teachers who believe in<br/>
homeschooling and support it, but must do so covertly. I have a very<br/>
dear friend who has taught English at our high school for years. She&#39;s<br/>
wonderful, one of those teachers you remember all your life because she<br/>
truly cares. She supports my decision to homeschool my 16yo and<br/>
understands my feelings. She realizes that she, and others, are<br/>
&quot;trapped&quot; in the system. So, she just does the best she can, and she<br/>
gives 200%. Rare, and lucky are the public school students who get her<br/>
as a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
My school district here in SC is *very* averse to homeschoolers. Every<br/>
school district is different. I think it depends on the general makeup<br/>
of the community. Here, every other person I meet or go to church with<br/>
is either a schoolteacher or works for the school or is related to<br/>
someone deeply engrained in the school system. They look at<br/>
homeschoolers as the enemy. Too bad they&#39;re not concerned about the<br/>
education of *all* people in their district.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling. It&#39;s not what we do, it&#39;s how we think.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217077630">I got support from Isaacs teacher and principal when i choose to take him<br/>
out. I spoke to them both because i respect them. They were very supportive<br/>
of my choices. They asked me if they could help. the principal even wrote a<br/>
letter of recommendation for our homestudy for adoption.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to judge all schools. in general i do not liek the way kids learn<br/>
adn are treated there. but there are some wonderful teachers in the public<br/>
schools , people who really care adn are trying so hard. I was lucky that<br/>
my son had 3 of them and they gave him a wonderful education. it was the<br/>
mass mentality of on the field and other kids that were too much for him to<br/>
handle. also as isaac wanted to learn more they did not have th etime to<br/>
help him. but they cared.<br/>
