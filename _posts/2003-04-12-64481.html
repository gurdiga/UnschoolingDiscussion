It&#39;s World History (not just US), but it&#39;s the Best!! We just love it. The <br/>
Usborne book of World History Dates. It gives a brief over view of every year <br/>
(usually a few sentences to a few paragraphs) starting with Ancient times - <br/>
9000BC, and going thru till today (1997). It&#39;s so great because there are as <br/>
many pictures as words practically, so the kids just love to look at all the <br/>
interesting *stuff*! There&#39;s big pix, little pix, drawings, painting, <br/>
photographs, in all different sizes all over the pages. It&#39;s really neat <br/>
because it&#39;s an overview. And if anyone gets to a part thay&#39;d like more <br/>
detailed info on, then you can go from there to look up that particular <br/>
thing.    Lara..........</div>

Lies my Teacher Told Me --  by james loewen<br/>
<br/>
American History<br/>
<br/>
Really interesting. He spoke at our homeschooling conference a couple  <br/>
of years ago and I think everybody really enjoyed him. He was, like  <br/>
most speakers we get who haven&#39;t had contact with homeschoolers, really  <br/>
pleasantly surprised and impressed with the homeschooling community.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve learned more about all kinds of history from historical<br/>
fiction than from anything else.  They are usually very well researched, and<br/>
often there will be a blurb at the front or back telling which stuff is made<br/>
up and which true.  Many libraries have lists of historical fiction.<br/>
There&#39;s a great website with lists of fiction about Canadian history at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nucleus.com/~nicola/canhis.html">http://www.nucleus.com/~nicola/canhis.html</a>  I&#39;m sure there must be others<br/>
out there.  Maybe google historical fiction +book lists or something like<br/>
that.<br/>
