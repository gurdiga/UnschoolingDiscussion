<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127869369">I will try to make this long story short. My mil left our house about an hour <br/>
ago, she had had the kids out with her all day. Darin and I try to avoid most <br/>
contact with her, and she doesn&#39;t offer much *grandma-ness* to our kids. She <br/>
isn&#39;t the worlds nicest woman. (I could go on about missed birthdays and <br/>
other holidays...) But the other day, she called and said she was going to be <br/>
in town and wanted to know if the kids could spend the day with her. I talked <br/>
it over with Darin and since she hadn&#39;t seen them since last Thanksgiving, we <br/>
decided it would be okay. She came by about 9 this morning and brought them <br/>
back about 8 this evening. We chatted for about half an hour, Darin came home <br/>
and they talked for a while. Finally I made motions about dishes, bed times <br/>
(right!) and being a bit tired myself, and Darin got her out to her car. Then <br/>
he left to go over to a friends house to help put in a new stereo system. <br/>
That&#39;s when Moly came to me and told me this story! <br/>
She said her Grandma had taken them to the park that morning and then to <br/>
lunch at a boring old restaurant. (which means somewhere where the kids were <br/>
expected to sit still, not talk and not move.) After lunch, they went to see <br/>
a &quot;friend&quot; of their Grandma&#39;s. This friend gave them some papers to read and <br/>
write on and some math papers to do, he asked the kids questions about a <br/>
story he read to them, and some pictures he showed them. He questioned them <br/>
on spelling and asked Moly about multiplication. Then asked the kids <br/>
questions about their &quot;school&quot; (their Grandma calls it our &quot;little school&quot;) <br/>
what they did, and what Moly says was a &quot;bunch of other stuff&quot;. I couldn&#39;t <br/>
get much more out of her, she says it was just a real boring time, and I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to get to the point of grilling her, besides I am sure Grandma <br/>
told them not to mention this whole episode to me. It wasn&#39;t brought up in <br/>
the hour she was here and my kids are the type to go over every minute of the <br/>
day when telling someone about their day. <br/>
And just now, Moly came up to me and asked who her Aunt Rose is! I didn&#39;t get <br/>
it at first and told her she doesn&#39;t have an Aunt Rose. Then she says &quot;My <br/>
Grandma says my Aunt Rose will start coming over soon and that Aunt Rose will <br/>
visit every month and I shouldn&#39;t be scared that she visits all women. Who is <br/>
she?&quot; Now I have to explain this to Moly on top of everything else! I am so <br/>
mad! I would sue this woman if I new what I could sue her for! And Darin <br/>
won&#39;t be home for a few hours! He doesn&#39;t even know about this yet. What am I <br/>
going to do!?! What is going on in this woman&#39;s demented head? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281210042">Oh MY!!!!  I would be SO mad!!!!!  In my opinion, you need to <br/>
confront her on this and I would not let my kids alone with her <br/>
again.  Ever.  What do you think she is planning on doing with the <br/>
test results?  Would she &quot;turn you in&quot; for anything?  <br/>

Use your energy to document the heck out of this RIGHT NOW while you&#39;re still <br/>
grumpy about it.  Write down what you can remember.  Tomorrow, as each child <br/>
separately to tell you more.<br/>
<br/>
Find out as much as you can from the kids what the test papers looked like <br/>
(without really upsetting them.  Was this a true standardized testing <br/>
situation?  Was her friend a counselor or psychologist?  IF SO, you need to <br/>
find out who it was, because if they tested children without parental consent <br/>
or agreement that might be a problem.  (On second thought, the schools never <br/>
get parental permission, so maybe not.  Unless registration in a school <br/>
implies consent.)<br/>
<br/>
If it were me I would ask my mother in law to explain to me in writing what <br/>
she had done and why, and until she did that she was not to be alone with my <br/>
children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I talked to Darin when he got home last night and we had a long discussion <br/>
about his mother. I calmly (glad I had a few hours and this list to vent) <br/>
told him what his Mom had done and he wasn&#39;t too upset about it. He was mad <br/>
that she had done this, but not too mad, as he is curious to know how the <br/>
kids did. So that kind of ticked me off some more. Moly was still up so we <br/>
talked to her, asked her to tell us some more about this test she took. She <br/>
said she did a book of math questions and had to fill in some dots, then she <br/>
said she did a book with short stories that she had to answer questions <br/>
about. She said Jack did the same thing. Later the man read a story to the <br/>
kids and asked them questions about it then he showed Moly some pictures and <br/>
asked her to tell him what all she saw. She said he did the same with Jack. <br/>
After that, he gave them each a test with lots of questions about all sorts <br/>
of things from math, and english to word problems and questions about <br/>
patterns. <br/>
Darin and I called his Mom this morning and I kept quiet. Darin asked her <br/>
what she had done with the kids yesterday. She said they had gone to the park <br/>
and out to lunch, so he asked what they had done in the afternoon and she <br/>
vaguely said &quot;Oh, just things. We had some errands to do.&quot; (I was mad that <br/>
she was lying!) So Darin told her that Moly had told us she had taken the <br/>
kids to a friends and had them tested. She finally admitted she had made an <br/>
appointment and taken them to a counselors office and had psychological and <br/>
IQ tests administered. He asked her why she had decided that it was her place <br/>
to do this and she told him that because I am so vague with her about what <br/>
the kids do in our little school, she had decided that she needed to make <br/>
sure I wasn&#39;t harming them or delaying their learning. (This is the point <br/>
that I got so mad, I called her a really nasty name and told Darin to take <br/>
care that his psycho mother didn&#39;t ever come near any of us again.) <br/>
She and Darin talked some more and then he and I sat down and talked. He said <br/>
that she told him she had intended to give him the results of the tests and <br/>
if they were not &quot;up to standard&quot; that she was going to encourage him to put <br/>
them into school. She told him that if we were concerned about the schools <br/>
then she and her husband had decided that they would help us buy a house <br/>
close to them so the kids could go to the local school in the town where they <br/>
live and she would take responsibility of making sure they got to and from <br/>
school. She said she would take care of them during the day so I could get a <br/>
job. (Isn&#39;t she grand!) Then she said if the scores were too bad, she was <br/>
going to strongly encourage him to leave me, file for custody of the kids and <br/>
she would help him raise them. Apparently that is when Darin told her <br/>
good-bye and hung up. <br/>
We have decided that (I am still not too happy about this) since Darin <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to cut off all contact with her, we will still see her a few <br/>
times a year. But that, she will not be allowed to have the kids for visits <br/>
unless one of us is there at all times. I don&#39;t have to go to her house, and <br/>
she isn&#39;t allowed in ours. But I will go because I am the type that has to <br/>
know what is going on all the time. &lt;g&gt; And that she can have her test <br/>
scores, we are just going to keep on doing what we have been, because we know <br/>
the kids are happy, healthy and smart. And we don&#39;t need any tests to tell us <br/>
that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
i can&#39;t even begin to tell you how mad I AM at your mother-in-law. <br/>
THE NERVE. she obviously is on a power trip. BEWARE. i don&#39;t think <br/>
this is the end of it. you and darin should talk about the &quot;what <br/>
ifs&quot;: what if she gets really power hungry and denounces you and your <br/>
husband of child neglect? is he ready to go to court and get a <br/>
restraining order against her? these are tough questions to answer. i <br/>
also think that you need to know who administered these tests --did <br/>
they know this was done against your will? if they did, you have 2 <br/>
recourses: 1) complain to the state board for breach of privacy and <br/>
have this go into the man&#39;s practice record or 2) sue him for <br/>
malpractice. any way you go, you have to take aggressive action. <br/>
your mother in-law is a threat to the integrity of your family. i <br/>
truly believe she will be back for more.<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Nancy --<br/>
<br/>
I would be really ticked off, too.  It&#39;s hard for me to understand why<br/>
your dh isn&#39;t more bothered.  If a neighbor or an aunt or uncle had done<br/>
this, wouldn&#39;t your dh be offended?  I wonder what would your mil have<br/>
done if the test results had confirmed her fear that your kids weren&#39;t<br/>
learning?  Would she have reported you to child protective services? <br/>
Who in heavens name is Aunt Rose?  I was assuming not a real relative,<br/>
but a social worker.<br/>
<br/>
Hypothetically, if your mil had filled out a form in triplicate that<br/>
said I suspect Joe and Josephine X aren&#39;t raising their children<br/>
properly, please test them and send someone to their home regularly to<br/>
check up on them, would he think that was an extreme form of meddling? <br/>
Does he think people in this country should do that to other people?  If<br/>
so, why?<br/>
<br/>
I would never let my kids see my mil unsupervised if she had pulled this<br/>
kind of stunt. It&#39;s not just the meddling -- it&#39;s the LYING.  Obviously<br/>
offering your kids a pleasant day with grandma was not what she had in<br/>
mind.  She arranged this, in advance, with a completely different intention.<br/>
<br/>
A grandma that would pull a stunt like this would probably also feed<br/>
vegetarian kids meat behind their parents back and sneak pagan kids off<br/>
to be baptized in her own church.  A rebel granny might take a kid to a<br/>
tattoo parlor, over your wishes.  I don&#39;t know where your mil would ever<br/>
draw the line and butt out!  I&#39;m thinking the only &quot;lines&quot; she will<br/>
observe are those that suit her own preferences.  I don&#39;t think you can<br/>
trust her to respect your decisions and authority.<br/>
<br/>
I would also follow-up and ask your kids whether grandma asked them not<br/>
to tell.  Remember to remind your kids that grown-ups who &quot;do things to<br/>
them&quot; and ask them not to tell are a danger.  As you know, you want them<br/>
always to be willing to tell you what happens to them, and no adult<br/>
should try to override that.  In fact, if she&#39;s trying to hide what<br/>
she&#39;s done, she knows she&#39;s done something wrong.<br/>

them&quot; and ask them not to tell are a danger.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH yes.<br/>
<br/>
And if they say &quot;yes, she told us not to tell,&quot; come back here and we can <br/>
find you stories of kids who were sexually abused and didn&#39;t tell because <br/>
they promised, or were afraid, or didn&#39;t have a clue what was happening to <br/>
them, and you can bury her in little printouts of those.  You could mail her <br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s not too late, I would recommend being careful not to let the kids <br/>
think your objection is that they might have done really badly.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know until Marty was six or seven or so that he thought maybe he was <br/>
home because he wasn&#39;t smart enough for school.  It had to do with something <br/>
the neighborkids said.<br/>
<br/>
He has no question now that that&#39;s not the case, but he worried quietly for a <br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I hope you&#39;ll<br/>
talk to them about that and suggest other things they could have done<br/>
(call you?) the next time they might encounter similar circumstances.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good suggestion.  You could make it general, not just about tests, but about <br/>
ANYtime they felt unsure if what they were doing was something you knew about <br/>
or would approve, that if they wanted to call you they could.  You could <br/>
point out that no adult who WAS being upfront would say, &quot;No, don&#39;t ask your <br/>
mom.&quot;<br/>

her and Darin for years. When he went to the Marines, he sent home much of <br/>

called me the day we got back from our honey moon to tell me. When I had <br/>
Moly, she was so excited, Moly was the first girl in their family in over 40 <br/>
years. (since Darin&#39;s sister was born) When I told her Moly&#39;s name and how we <br/>

names and said she wouldn&#39;t be back unless it was changed. She didn&#39;t see <br/>
Moly for the first 6 months of her life. When Jack was born, she came to the <br/>
hospital. I was there for three days before I had him (I wasn&#39;t in Labor that <br/>
long, it was other things) and she thought I was going to have him. When I <br/>
didn&#39;t have him that first night, she left saying &quot;Just call me when she <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262292268">My husband called this one right.  He figured that the problem was <br/>
way more than the unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another perspective on the husband not being as alarmed about <br/>
his mother as you are.  He was raised by her and is used to her <br/>
ways.  She&#39;s not normal to objective observers but for him it&#39;s the <br/>
norm for her.  I have a MIL who&#39;s the almost the exact opposite of <br/>
me.  When she does or says something that gets on my nerves, my <br/>
husband doesn&#39;t get as upset as I do.  He tells me to ignore her and <br/>
keep on doing what I&#39;m doing.  It works.  Fortunately we do not live <br/>
close to each other, so I don&#39;t have to think about her everyday.  My <br/>
husband also told me that sons see meddling mothers as loving and/or <br/>
caring.  I think this is especially true of mothers who were <br/>
physically and emotionally distant (my husband&#39;s mother is).<br/>
<br/>
If I was in your situation I would talk to her directly.  The husband <br/>
is (most likely) going to be gentle and a little appeasing.  She&#39;ll <br/>
still have hope in her heart that she can get her way with your kids <br/>
and your husband.  I&#39;d make it clear to her why she wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
seeing the kids alone anymore.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a loud fight <br/>
just direct and uncompromising on your part.  I&#39;d also offer her some <br/>
info on unschooling if you already haven&#39;t, maybe help her see that <br/>
you aren&#39;t following some vague whim.<br/>

Do the kids have any clue what building they went to or where they ate lunch? <br/>
 You could figure it out, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d tell her that because she lied to your husband and encouraged your <br/>
children to lie (if she did) and because she refuses to tell you where she <br/>
took them now,  that she&#39;s out unless and  until she is forthcoming with that <br/>
information AND the results of the testing.  That they are YOUR children, not <br/>
hers.<br/>
<br/>
Either that or blow the whole thing by and drive her even more crazy by not <br/>
caring.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, honestly, and I wouldn&#39;t want to traumatize the kids any more <br/>
than they are, but maybe they can remember something about where the office <br/>
was vaguely, what the guy looked like or sounded like, SOMETHING about his <br/>
office (the view, the neighbors, how high up in the building...) and you <br/>

&lt;&lt; If I was in your situation I would talk to her directly.  . . . .  I&#39;d <br/>
make it clear to her why she wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
seeing the kids alone anymore.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a loud fight <br/>
just direct and uncompromising on your part.  I&#39;d also offer her some <br/>
info on unschooling if you already haven&#39;t, maybe help her see that <br/>
you aren&#39;t following some vague whim. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would put it in writing and KEEP COPIES.<br/>
It can be really calm in writing, and she can&#39;t claim you said other than <br/>
what you said.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Eep!  Yes, in my circle of in-laws nagging and emphatically telling<br/>
people how they should run their lives is considered an expression of<br/>
affection.  They really don&#39;t understand my response since it pisses me<br/>
off mightily. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well we might all need to be careful about what we think.<br/>
<br/>
How many of us would smile benignly and cheerfully help our future <br/>
what-in-laws clean circumcision wounds, sterilize bottles and heat formula, <br/>
hold kids for live polio vaccines (or the future equivalent), drive our <br/>
grandkids to daycare when they&#39;re two, help them with their reading lessons <br/>
when they&#39;re four...   all that without recommending alternatives?<br/>
<br/>
Not me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394221514">Oh Nancy, I&#39;ve been so disgusted with your MIL that I haven&#39;t even been able <br/>
to answer your post! Geez, talk about overstepping the line! I agree with <br/>
everyone&#39;s outrage and that you should NOT leave your kids alone with her <br/>
again. But there were two points brought up that I do have some additional <br/>
thoughts on.<br/>
<br/>
You talked about how upset your daughter is by the testing and your <br/>
reaction. I think it might be helpful for her to understand that taking a <br/>
test is NOT wrong. Kids do it all the time. They do it in school every day. <br/>
It&#39;s okay that she took a test with grandma. Assure her that you&#39;re not <br/>
worried that she took it, that she might have failed it, that it might have <br/>
harmed her, etc. It&#39;s just a test. Then further explain to her that you <br/>
think tests are meaningless, innaccurate and unecessary and THAT is why you <br/>
have never done tests with her. Tell her that grandma simply did a dumb <br/>
thing and wasted her time to try to prove something to you about education <br/>
and schools. YOU are completely aware of of smart and amazing and educated <br/>
your daughter is. Grandma is the one who needs the test.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my second opinion. I think you should take Grandma out for lunch and <br/>
then have a psychologist come over to give her some IQ/Psycological profile <br/>
testing. See how she likes it :-P~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596497165">Hi.  I&#39;m very new to this list, so hesitate to comment on this list.  However, I don&#39;t think you could sue her.  However, you could press criminal charges against her.  You could also get a retraining order.   I&#39;m sorry you are having this trouble with your mil.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; I would sue her, but what would that get me? More <br/>
  &gt; headache, and what if we got an anti-homeschooling judge?<br/>
  &gt; ~Nancy<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Maybe you wouldn&#39;t have to sue her.  Maybe just a letter from a <br/>
  lawyer demanding information would be enough. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I would work on the psychologist, who is licensed and subject to regulation, <br/>
  and see whether maybe what was done was unethical or illegal or against some <br/>
  protocol.<br/>
<br/>
  And if you find anything like that, I would write to the psychologist with a <br/>
  letter to the mil saying any further such action on their parts would be <br/>
  cause to call authorities.  Maybe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve thought a lot about this.  I&#39;ve been lucky so far.  My daughter <br/>
parents the way I did, only better.  &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;ve taken my childrearing <br/>
ideas a number of steps further than I did, and I think it&#39;s great.<br/>
Now if one of my boys ends up with a partner who has very different ideas . <br/>
. . I think I&#39;ll end up with a very sore tongue from biting it so <br/>
much.  Even with Heather, I *offer* ideas and suggestions rather than <br/>
*telling* her what to do.  She always listens, and often she follows my <br/>
advice.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do think that any future daughters-in-law will be well aware of the way <br/>
Heather is raising her kids.  I suspect she will be the one <br/>
nagging.  &lt;g&gt;  All I know is that I would do my best to support the <br/>
daughter-in-law&#39;s efforts in what I saw as the right direction, rather than <br/>
nag about the areas where I disagreed.  But I wouldn&#39;t actually assist with <br/>
things I really disagreed with.<br/>
<br/>
Helen, have you run into this kind of thing with your kids&#39; spouses?  If <br/>
so, how did you handle it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our two oldest sons both married girls who enjoyed school, but <br/>
thought homeschooling was a much better option, maybe because they&#39;ve <br/>
seen what it did for their husbands. &lt;g&gt; Interestingly, both families <br/>
have worked it out so the guys worked the first few years after their <br/>
children were born and set the family up with their own homes, good <br/>
cars, and some money in the bank, and now the girls have taken over <br/>
and resumed their careers while the guys are staying home with the <br/>
now-school-age girls. Although the boys live in different states <br/>
(Washington and Alaska) and only see each other a couple of times a <br/>
year, it&#39;s interesting to see what similar paths they and their wives <br/>
have chosen. And all are completely happy with their decisions.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess the answer is no.<br/>
