<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040789342">Yeah,  I wondered if other people read that and thought that.  I was reading it going, wait a minute I didn&#39;t write this?  I know sometimes I forget things but I&#39;m not forgetting whole conversations!  Plus I didn&#39;t agree with some of the things she was saying, which is ok, that&#39;s her opinion, hopefully we have different last names.<br/>

How fun!  Our Ethan is Feefon, too!  And feefers and feefer-do, freefree, <br/>
feef and feefee (which my husband particularly hates, says it sounds like a <br/>
pink poodle name! LOL) When I call him me sweet baby boy, he gets this big <br/>
puffy chest and a stern look on his face and says, My not a BABY boy!  My a <br/>
BIG boy!  My a PERSON, MOMMY!  I just love that he says MY instead of I...so <br/>
cute!<br/>
<br/>
My poor kids have so many names, I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t even know their true <br/>
full names.  Hannah&#39;s name is Hannah Isabelle, but arund here she&#39;s Hannah, <br/>
Bella, Belle, Belly, Belly-Boo-Foo, Hannahbelle, Hannie, Hanniebella...it <br/>
goes on from there....I have 5 other children, so I won&#39;t even continue!! <br/>
LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OH that is soo funny, and what a coincidence.  I thought surely Feefon was a <br/>
one of a kind nickname.. LOL.. Reading your other nick names reminded me that <br/>
we also call him Efe. .. Cause JP used to call him Efan..  That is a tough <br/>
name for little ones to say.  HOW NEAT!<br/>
