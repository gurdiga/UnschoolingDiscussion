I am finding having read a book about Indigo Children that Zak is most<br/>
definitely one of them.  In the book it talks about homeschooling or<br/>
alternative schools are the best for these kinds of children as they need<br/>
the freedom to jump from one thing to another.  In regular schools they are<br/>
usually labeled ADD or ADHD or whatever the label they are currently using.<br/>
Here are some traits of Indigo Children, maybe some of you have one and can<br/>
really relate to this.  They come into this world with a feeling of Royalty<br/>
(and often act like it).  They have a feeling of &quot;deserving to be here&quot; and<br/>
are surprised when others don&#39;t share that.  Self worth is not a big issue.<br/>
They often tell the parents &quot;who they are&quot;.  They have difficulty with<br/>
absolute authority (authority without explanation or choice).  They simply<br/>
will not do certain things; for example, waiting in line is difficult for<br/>
them.  They get frustrated with systems that are ritual-oriented  and don&#39;t&#39;<br/>
require creative thought.  They often see better ways of doing things, both<br/>
at home and in school, which makes them seem like &quot;system busters&quot;<br/>
(nonconforming to any system).  They seem antisocial unless they are with<br/>
their own kind.  If there are no others of like consciousness around them,<br/>
they often turn inward, feeling like no other human understands them.<br/>
School is often extremely difficult for them socially.  They will not<br/>
respond to &quot;guilt&quot; discipline (&quot;wait till your father gets home and finds<br/>
out what you did&quot;).  They are not shy at letting you know what they need.<br/>
Also some of them are psychic or intuitive.  There is a tremendous interest<br/>
and a tremendous need to know.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have a child like this.  Most Indigo Children were born after<br/>
1994 but some have been found before that.<br/>

would have evoked a different label in earlier generations ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s nonsense, personally.<br/>
<br/>
That description describes lots of people I have known my whole life.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has a child who fits those descriptions and is already <br/>
unschooling, what else is there to say or know or do about it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437860717">Sounds like all of mine. They are average kids who do deserve to be here! Why on earth would a &quot;feeling of deserving to be here&quot; be anything extraordinary! Unless of course they have been taught otherwise. I think the indigo children thing is just another label.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580913232">Excuse me for responding to this so late, but I just have to add my two cents.  I don&#39;t get online much.  But I found in that description traits that I find desirable.  I fit that description and was born in 1967.  My mother beat it out of me at home but I was uncontrollable at school.  I wish I was unschooled.<br/>
 <br/>
My daughter was born &quot;acting like royalty&quot; and fits that description quite well.  I worked hard to keep those traits in her while I worked full time and had her in daycare.  I&#39;m home with her now and look forward to nurtuering this behavoir to its fullest and to her becoming a young lady who won&#39;t take crap from anyone.  I think she&#39;ll have a really good life.  She and her little sister will be unschooled.  Sounds like another stupid lable designed to control children and sell drugs.<br/>

Well no.  I&#39;ve had a look at the book and I think also a website (a while<br/>
back) and there is no recommendation for drugs.  It also doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
at all about control, but about understanding, working with the trait rather<br/>
than against.<br/>
