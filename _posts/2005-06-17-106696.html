 </span></blockquote>Can you explain a little what you mean by &#39;It&#39;s false&#39;?   Are you  <br/>
saying that all food is good food?<br/>
 <br/>
-------------------------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Crap is shit that comes out of the butt of some animal.<br/>
Food is never crap.<br/>
That&#39;s an emotional argument designed to disgust and shame a person who  <br/>
wanted to taste whatever it was the speaker wanted to call &quot;crap.&quot;  What  you were <br/>
defining as crap, I don&#39;t know.  Let&#39;s say marshmallows.<br/>
 <br/>
If a child wants to roast and eat a marshmallow, but her mom has called it  <br/>
crap (soon perhaps to be flaming crap), she might want to eat it anyway, but <br/>
she  won&#39;t be as happy about it.  She will choose to make her life smaller to  <br/>
appease her mother, or she will choose to defy her mother and do something she  <br/>
knows her mother thinks is wrong.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s not a good way for natural learning to unfold peacefully.<br/>
It&#39;s not a way for family life to become more harmonious.<br/>
 <br/>
None of that is anywhere NEAR &quot;all food is good food,&quot; but it&#39;s nearly  <br/>
impossible to label various foods &quot;good&quot; and &quot;crap.&quot;  Better and worse,  maybe yes. <br/>
 But what&#39;s great for one person is not for another, for reasons  of genetics <br/>
or allergies or biochemical constitution.  Some people get gas  so easily <br/>
that lettuce and onions aren&#39;t good things for them to eat.   Some get the runs <br/>
very easily.  Some tend toward nausea.  Some  don&#39;t.  A person in her 30s told <br/>
me she had never once in her life thrown  up.  When she felt ill, she just got <br/>
the runs soon after.  Some are  allergic to cheese.  Others thrive on it.<br/>
 <br/>
Official opinions of professional dieticians about what parts of hamburgers  <br/>
are the &quot;healthy&quot; part have changed over the past 35 years so thoroughly that  <br/>
there&#39;s nothing to be thought but that dieticians will change their minds, <br/>
and  it&#39;s probably best to eat the whole hamburger.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes going from one plane to another in an airport with a kid who  needs <br/>
protein, the &quot;best&quot; food is going to be a PayDay bar out of a vending  <br/>
machine.  Those pretzels they give her in the plane aren&#39;t going to help at  all, <br/>
and there&#39;s not time to buy a nice turkey sandwich.   Sometimes a  pregnant <br/>
woman in an airplane could do no better than to eat pretzels slowly so  she can <br/>
survive the flight without more nausea.  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are often situational.<br/>
 <br/>
A marshmallow joyously consumed at a campfire is much better for a person  <br/>
than deprivation and guilt at the side of a campfire where other people are  <br/>
eating marshmallows.<br/>

The recipes that I&#39;ve modified to reduce the fat haven&#39;t tasted very good.  Which makes me wonder whether kids will continue to eat yogurt-based fat-free cookies when they&#39;ve tasted the alternatives?<br/>
<br/>
(I am compelled to admit that when we started avoiding cookies with trans-fats, we replaced them with butter cookies. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343191348">You know, it is so mainstream (to label food as bad  when someone ( a child)<br/>
is eating it) that often people don&#39;t even see it, but I experienced the<br/>
feelings that a child would experience just the other day when it comes to<br/>
food and someone (my mother) labeling it as *crap* or junk. (choose your<br/>
word)<br/>
<br/>
We had been gone all evening and we were hungry.  We live in the country and<br/>
McDonald&#39;s in a ten or 15 minute drive from our house but near my mother&#39;s<br/>
house.  We go to McDonald&#39;s maybe half a dozen times a year, at most.  But I<br/>
wanted something hot and fast and cheap and I like McDonald&#39;s food, even<br/>
though I know it isn&#39;t the most nutritional food on the planet.  I thought<br/>
about ordering a salad or some other healthy thing but then I thought.  I go<br/>
to McDonald&#39;s so infrequently, a Big Mac and fries isn&#39;t going to kill me.<br/>
So, we went and got some MD food and decided to go to my mom&#39;s and visit her<br/>
while we ate dinner.  I can&#39;t even remember what she said but she commented<br/>
on the fact that we were eating such unhealthy food.  I knew she would<br/>
before I went there.  In the past I wouldn&#39;t have brought McDonald&#39;s food to<br/>
her house to eat just because of that.  I didn&#39;t want a dose of guilt with<br/>
my fries, thanks.  I knew they weren&#39;t healthy and I chose to eat them<br/>
anyway.  This time decided that it was worth the visit (we hadn&#39;t visited<br/>
for a few weeks) and that I would disregard her comments.  When she asked<br/>
why we got that *crap*, I responded that I wanted something cheap and hot.<br/>
She said she&#39;d have made us something.  I responded that I wanted something<br/>
cheap, hot, greasy and good and that McD fit the bill.  I told her that I<br/>
thought of getting something healthy but decided that I eat there so<br/>
infrequently that it wouldn&#39;t kill me.  And it tastes good to me. My kids<br/>
would prefer Subway but both thought the idea of something hot was a good<br/>
one this time.  We had been out in the cold drizzle for 3 hours watching<br/>
horses and riders.   Both ate their fries and drank their drinks.  I threw<br/>
out a whole wrapped hamburger and one that had a couple bites taken out of<br/>
it.  It wasn&#39;t *because* it was junk or that my mother commented on it.  It<br/>
was because they just don&#39;t like it all that much and they ate just what<br/>
they wanted from the meal and no more.<br/>
<br/>
I try really hard NOT to give my kids a dose of guilt with their food, and<br/>
although I know I am successful most of the time, I know I fail sometimes at<br/>
it.  I shall try harder not to do that to my kids because one day instead of<br/>
bringing their dinner to my house to eat while they visit, they may eat in<br/>
their car instead of having a dose of guilt with their food.<br/>
