&lt;&lt; I mean, do you all mix with the &quot;homeschoolers&quot; frequently?-  am I really<br/>
going to be of help there? am I going to get a feeling of community and<br/>
support from a group that generally doesn&#39;t share my philosophy and have<br/>
children younger than mine? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time at the groups, because I really can&#39;t sit and calmly talk <br/>
with someone about how hard it is to get her kid to finish his math.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want to go into the whole thing at a group which isnt called &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
anything, and I feel hypocritical if I just smile wanly and nod.  So it&#39;s too <br/>
much work, often, to be there.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve been doing is staying involved with the kids, doing things with <br/>
them, instead of sitting with the moms.  And I try to get moms involved in <br/>
playing or whatever, but the only ones who do sometimes are the other <br/>
unschoolers (the other TWO unschoolers, Dave and Nancy Martinez, who seem to <br/>
be the only ones there these days).<br/>
<br/>
For years I organized a weekly get-together and it was called &quot;the Goof <br/>
Group&quot; (formal name Albuquerque Unschoolers).  Because of the name and <br/>
because I was the organizer, those who were structured just didn&#39;t talk about <br/>
it there.  We just laughed and played--at parks, usually, or at my house <br/>
(when we had the bigger house) or sometimes a public place (children&#39;s museum <br/>
or some such).  That was more comfortable conversationally and socially, but <br/>
logistically it got old.  We grew a mound of lost&#39;n&#39;found stuff, the kids got <br/>
tired of helping prepare, be hosts, and clean up.  I got tired of the kids <br/>
being tired of other kids messing with their stuff in inappropriate ways <br/>
(although breakage was usually light, there was sometimes some damage).<br/>
<br/>
The group I&#39;m most closely associated with now is field-trip crazed.  Holly <br/>
and I go to some things, and she goes to some without me, and her dad takes <br/>
her swimming with them.  Kirby and Marty don&#39;t go.  They&#39;re at the gaming <br/>
shop on the meeting day anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;m not as needy (Holly being ten),  maybe I&#39;m less patient.  Maybe <br/>
because I ran a group for seven years or so, I tire easily when things are <br/>
inefficient.  And most of the families have kids in the six to eight year <br/>
range (and younger).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have been sometimes more and sometimes less active in our group for<br/>
about 9 years.  I take my cue from the kids. When the group activities are<br/>
&quot;structured&quot; (which here translates into most parents chit-chatting about<br/>
curriculum etc. and a couple of parents trying to do specific fake-y<br/>
activities with kids), my kids don&#39;t have much interest. We sometimes have<br/>
found sub-groups like chess day that work out well--I just hang with the<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I  don&#39;t think it matters how big a group is because getting together for<br/>
fun doesn&#39;t take a lot of people. We have been getting together with 2 or 3<br/>
unschooling families regularly for a few months and we are now advertising<br/>
this on our local loop. It is really fun, the kids and the parents have a<br/>
blast! This keeps my spirits up.<br/>
<br/>
I also do the Scholastic thing for the big group. I promote using real<br/>
books, and can use that to lead chit chat into unschooling. My kids are<br/>
also happy to talk to people about their interests and how they have<br/>
learned things on their own, which sometimes interests adults.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have the same problems too.  I am relatively new to unschooling - I decided<br/>
4 years ago to do it but since Megan is 6.6667...  I&#39;ve not actually being<br/>
doing it with a school age child in the picture that long.  The support group we<br/>
attend is full of all aged children (infant to early teens) but most of them<br/>
are either structured homeschoolers or the &quot;I unschool except ...&quot; type.<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;in&quot; to be an unschooler here in CA, I think. Since Alex is 4, I can <br/>
easily avoid sitting around talking to the other parents.<br/>
<br/>
The group has a lot of &quot;clubs&quot; some mothers have started.  They meet a couple<br/>
of times a month - the Globe Trotters Club is about geography and the Time<br/>
Travelers Club is about history.  From what I hear the format of the club<br/>
is that the children sit and listen to a parent&#39;s 30 min. presentation and<br/>
then they do little projects related to that day&#39;s theme.  The reason I <br/>
heard about it is that one of my friends was saying that she didn&#39;t think<br/>
her 6 year old son was ready for that; they tried it once and he had a hard<br/>
time sitting for the presentation.  My reply and that of another mother<br/>
was that the expectations of the people running the clubs was unrealistic.<br/>
I try to support those who seem to be seeking and I stay away from the <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
I find I get most of my support on-line.  I am just now connecting with<br/>
some families who use the same charter school that I do - it is one which<br/>
is very supportive of unschooling.  I see potential for good friends for my<br/>
children and good friends for me.  With the &quot;clubby&quot; support group I have<br/>
given up on finding friends for me (HEY, BETSY - why don&#39;t you go any more???<br/>
Cos that statement doesn&#39;t include you!) but my children have friends they<br/>
wish to continue seeing.  And this way I have the park and other adults around <br/>
instead of one on one time with the other parent if we did play dates!<br/>
I do find that on Wednesdays I have to give myself a good pep talk or else<br/>
I get cranky getting ready to go - Megan and Alex are easily distracted off<br/>
task - they really want to go but the Legoes, the books, the whatever is <br/>
so, so interesting compared to getting socks on, hair brushed, shoes on, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t give up on all of us with young children.  We&#39;re out there and some<br/>
of us &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>

out on this homeschooling/unschooling path yet I find I agree with your <br/>
statement above.  I&#39;m in my late 40s, I&#39;m perimenopausal and I&#39;m tired of<br/>
inefficiency and a lot of the crap that goes along with group dynamics.  I<br/>
don&#39;t need to be joined at the hip with another adult to go to a conference or<br/>
to take my kids interesting places.  A lot of the mothers I know seem to <br/>
need that.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If a club is a kid-driven thing it can be really fun. In the chess club<br/>
we&#39;ve been going to, the kids teach each other. It&#39;s so different from my<br/>
experiences trying to (and giving up on) learning chess when I was a kid. I<br/>
may even try to play at this advanced age.<br/>
<br/>
It still amazes me to see homeschoolers who are so out of touch with kids<br/>
in general and their own kids. They plan such undoable activities geared to<br/>
the adults. And often they do *so many* activities, whether their kids want<br/>
to or not.<br/>

<br/>
Oooh.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that sends a shiver down me is someone who goes to teach who is NOT <br/>
aware of any child developmental stages, or the motivations of kids at <br/>
different times of their lives, or their capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Worst case is the mother of an infant attributing understanding and <br/>
manipulation to pre-verbal babies.  (That would be my mom explaining to me <br/>
that my brother knew EXACTLY what she was saying, and that he was being <br/>
manipulative.  He was six months old.  I was 19 and too smart to believe her.)<br/>
<br/>
But there are programs in some states for scientists to get into the <br/>
classroom.  There&#39;s an advantage.  But a friend of mine was in a California <br/>
program which taught her vaguely how schools operate, are funded, what the <br/>
curriculum and scope and sequence were, but totally left out anything about <br/>
interpersonal relationships or human development.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s another reason, now that I think of it, that I can really get <br/>
behind unschooling, and to some extent unit studies, but structured &quot;lessons&quot; <br/>
are bad from average teachers, and horrible from most total amateurs.  <br/>
Tolerable, maybe, to half the people there if the teacher is somehow really <br/>
bubbly and sparkly.  <br/>
<br/>
If I won&#39;t subject my kids to professional teachers why would I set them with <br/>
often-frustrated and wholly-inexperienced people who might be believing that <br/>
this is the kid&#39;s one chance to get this information, whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling, on the edge of rant, so I&#39;ll quit.  I don&#39;t like classes for <br/>
homeschoolers.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I don&#39;t like  classes for <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm. I don&#39;t like the way many classes for homeschooler are done,<br/>
especially when they&#39;re done in a &quot;school-ish&quot;,or a developmentally<br/>
inappropriate way.  I don&#39;t have a problem with classes in general,<br/>
though. Cacie and I met a woman at park day today who works as a clown,<br/>
and Cacie was begging her to run some classes on it.  I suppose we could<br/>
just ask her to teach some stuff to Cacie, and offer to pay her maybe,<br/>
but Cacie generally likes learning stuff with other people around, 1:1<br/>
doesn&#39;t work as well, so that&#39;s basically a class.<br/>
<br/>
For a while, there was a ranger working at one of the regional parks near<br/>
us, and Cacie wanted to do all of her classes. Sometimes they would<br/>
putter around in the cove and talk about stuff, sometimes they would do<br/>
crafts using natural materials, and sometimes they had hikes where they<br/>
talked about various ecological issues. The other rangers weren&#39;t as<br/>
good, though, and Megan was temporary, so once she left Cacie stopped<br/>
signing up for classes.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t like classes of any kind until she was 7 or so, then she<br/>
suddenyl became interested.<br/>
<br/>
*I* like classes.  I really want to go back to college again once we<br/>
move, and take some classes. Some things are much easier for me to learn<br/>
when someone else structures it. Other things aren&#39;t, of course....<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t necessarily think a bubbly, sparkly teacher is better. I kind of<br/>
find them annoying. I like smart teachers, who know and love their<br/>
subjects, and aren&#39;t defensive when questioned.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know one of the mothers who started these clubs fairly well.  She&#39;s from<br/>
Poland and the reason she&#39;s homeschooling is so her son can get a &#39;good&#39;<br/>
education. She tried when the children were 4 to understand unschooling<br/>
but she couldn&#39;t begin to understand the concept.  She was unschooling.com&#39;s<br/>
list for a few months.  We would discuss various topics from the list at the<br/>
park but either I&#39;m not that good at communicating or she was not ready to <br/>
understand. I think the thing I don&#39;t like is the attitude of &quot;what is<br/>
Cindy doing with Megan?&quot; since I don&#39;t do their clubs.<br/>
<br/>
I am extremely cautious about the classes Megan takes.  After a disasterous<br/>
ballet class where the teacher wanted Megan to sit still and be quiet while<br/>
other students danced and pulled her screaming from the room for me to <br/>
discipline, I am very careful. (We never went back to that ballet school and<br/>
I told everyone who asked about it what happened. She was 3 at the time and<br/>
I&#39;d signed up on the recommendation of a friend.)<br/>

to go to school, so we found her a<br/>
homeschooling academy that met one day a<br/>
week.  She claimed she lvoed it until the new<br/>
semester was going to start and then said she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to return.  I tried hard to<br/>
contain my joy (it was a pain and very much<br/>
like school and filled with a bunch of school<br/>
at homers, etc.)  But one thing she said is<br/>
she wanted to have time with two of the kids<br/>
who went, and she asked for some of that time<br/>
to be learning time.  So I got together with<br/>
the parents and kids and we decided to meet<br/>
once every week or every other week, for<br/>
about three hours. Together we would decide<br/>
what to do. The kids wanted to read Charlie<br/>
and the chocolate factory so they did that<br/>
and then we discussed it.  It was REALLY<br/>
cool. Lexie and I came up with a bunch of<br/>
literary terms that were relavent, and we<br/>
talked about our favorite characters, the<br/>
terms, etc. The kids were involved, but the<br/>
two other moms and I had a lot of fun too.<br/>
The kids made fruit kabobs, and played a lot<br/>
too.  Lexie said later it was exactly what<br/>
she was looking to do, what she wanted....<br/>
<br/>
See, I think if it&#39;s kid directed, a class is<br/>
not such a bad thing.  but then, I&#39;m still<br/>
figureing this out.  Lexie wants to take an<br/>
art class and a gymnastics class too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875125629">You&#39;re right, if it&#39;s a kid-idea and kids honestly have freedom and input, <br/>
it&#39;s not so bad.<br/>

But I think the existence of a bunch of classes makes new homeschoolers think <br/>
that&#39;s how homeschooling needs to be.  And for some it&#39;s a replacement for <br/>
not using a curriculum.  And one problem I see is that when people are <br/>
checklisting, they look for <br/>
history<br/>
science<br/>
math<br/>
language arts<br/>
and then they quit looking.<br/>
<br/>
The group we go to once a week is talking about starting science classes.  <br/>
They already had geography but that&#39;s being put on hiatus for while because <br/>
the organizer&#39;s tired of it, or something.    It keeps kids from playing if <br/>
they want to.  It causes moms to get tense about how their children are <br/>
acting/being/paying attention/learning.  And those around who are sensitive <br/>
to other people&#39;s moods just have to share the experience, and wonder whether <br/>
it&#39;s OUR kid who&#39;s making theirs jealous, uncomfortable, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But having gone to some little series of geography classes or whatever, if <br/>
the parents&#39; not an unschooler, they check it off.  And I don&#39;t think they <br/>
will look for more geographical experiences for their child for a while. <br/>
<br/>
I just think the existence of a checklist is itself a detriment to &quot;always <br/>
learning.&quot;<br/>
