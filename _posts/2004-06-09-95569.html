<div id="ygrps-yiv-233696604">Hi,<br/>
We have some books at home that my oldest daughter (11) read this <br/>
year, she being very interested in the Holocaust which then led her <br/>
to want to know more about WWII (which she didn&#39;t find so <br/>
interesting)...  Anyway, these books got her thumbs up.<br/>
The Good Fight:  How World War II Was Won (author: Ambrose)<br/>
WWII for Kids: A History with 21 Activities<br/>
I Have Lived a Thousand Years (story of 13 yo holocaust victim, <br/>
highly recommended!)<br/>
Fireflies in the Dark  ... This is the a short story of the Terezin <br/>
concentration camp children and the art teacher who chose to take <br/>
suitcases of art supplies instead of belongings to the camp in order <br/>
to help the children cope with the trauma of their internment.  This <br/>
is the camp that the Nazis used for propaganda films/Red Cross <br/>
inspection re: treatment of the Jews.<br/>
Also, the National Holocaust Museum has a very interesting web site <br/>
with a unit study on Hidden Children of the holocaust.  Disregarding <br/>
the curriculum, the story part of the site is very good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099737837">I would not approach this primarily as which resources will present history<br/>
in an age appropriate way.  Instead, I would help my child explore specific<br/>
things in the past that interest her.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, dd was fascinated by the story of the Titanic after seeing the<br/>
movie with Leo and Kate.  I grabbed any Titanic resources I could find.  We<br/>
watched an older Titanic movie, a couple of documentaries, read lots of<br/>
fiction and non-fiction accounts of the voyage and the ship, AND! went to<br/>
the traveling exhibit at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, about 4 hour<br/>
drive from our house, but as near as it got to us.  That was really awesome.<br/>
As we walked in, each person was handed a ticket with a real passenger&#39;s<br/>
name.  At the end, there was a list of survivors, so we could find out which<br/>
of us made it, or didn&#39;t.  One of the women we attended with was Captain<br/>
John Smith.  We knew her fate right away!<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that dd did pick up a lot of history (and science and social<br/>
studies and math and movie making magic and...) along the way, but it wasn&#39;t<br/>
because she wanted to learn history.  It was because she was interested in<br/>
something that happened in the past.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794644075">[I&#39;m not saying who said because I&#39;m not trying to pick on a person for <br/>
writing quickly and sensibly!  The note below makes sense.  People *should* check <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Note of caution. Check your facts when watching the History Channel. They <br/>
make some of the grossest errors of scholarship! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The channel itself probably doesn&#39;t &quot;make gross errors of scholarship.&quot;  They <br/>
run shows about history.  Maybe some of the scriptwriters or historians or <br/>
archeologists involved in individual shows have made errors.  Maybe someone <br/>
subscribes to one theory over another which (within one theory) is a gross error <br/>
of scholarship.<br/>
<br/>
It was accepted by scholars for a long time that spices were so popular in <br/>
Europe in the Middle Ages because they were trying to hide the smell of rotten <br/>
meat, because they had no refrigeration.    Huh.  That&#39;s insane.  But because <br/>
scholars said it and publishers published it, it was &quot;fact&quot; for fifty or a <br/>
hundred years.  <br/>
<br/>
People who lived before ice boxes and the manufacture of ice knew perfectly <br/>
well not to even TRY to preserve raw meat in a raw state.  They cooked it, and <br/>
sometimes cooked it again later that day or in a day or two, but the first <br/>
cooking was preservative.  Or they dried it or salted it or pickled it.  But they <br/>
didn&#39;t leave it lying around raw and then need to disguise the fact that it <br/>
was rotting.<br/>
<br/>
Yet even now, in some history textbooks, that myth remains.  <br/>
<br/>
So if someone repeats it, is that a gross error of scholarship?<br/>
<br/>
No matter what the source of history, we should all be cautious about <br/>
believing something based on one single source, or a single interpretation.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes someone writes something about unschooling that&#39;s all askew, and <br/>
nonsensical.  I&#39;d hate to read somewhere, though, something like &quot;&lt;&lt; Note of <br/>
caution. Check your facts when reading yahoogroups postings. They make some of <br/>
<br/>
the grossest errors of scholarship! &gt;&gt;  or &lt;&lt; Note of caution. Check your <br/>
facts when reading unschooling.com. They make some of the grossest errors of <br/>
scholarship! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They want you in the office.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I always just LOVED those moments in school, when some kid-aide would show up <br/>
at the door of a classroom and say &quot;They want you (a student or the teacher, <br/>
depending) in the office.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They.&quot;  Like guys in trenchcoats with the collars up.<br/>
<br/>
They used to say that spices were used in the Middle Ages to cover the smell <br/>
of meat.  Were &quot;they&quot; wrong?  I bet one single guy pulled that idea out of his <br/>
ass to answer a question once about why it was so important to find a trade <br/>
route to India, and one of his students respected his professor so much that <br/>
years later  he mentioned it in a book or article, and someone was so in awe of <br/>
him that it went into a textbook, and...<br/>
<br/>
Not even a &quot;gross&quot; error.  An offhanded comment gone wild.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Danielle, you just reminded me. My daughter and I are really enjoying the &quot;Girls of Many <br/>
Lands&quot; from American Girl. The books are actually nice to read (a cut above the American <br/>
Girl American books). <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve read the one from China, India, and Turkey. They sent us on a goose chase for more <br/>
history about all three places. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511488091">&lt;&lt;The channel itself probably doesn&#39;t &quot;make gross errors of scholarship.&quot;<br/>
They run shows about history.  Maybe some of the scriptwriters or historians<br/>
or archeologists involved in individual shows have made errors.  Maybe<br/>
someone subscribes to one theory over another which (within one theory) is a<br/>
gross error of scholarship.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is one cool program on the history channel where they show a movie and<br/>
then have a couple of history professors discussing the accuracy or not of<br/>
the picture. I wish I could remember the name. <br/>
<br/>
I also love &quot;Time Team&quot;, with the archeologists constantly being surprised<br/>
and delighted and super-enthusiastic. They go into raptures over a tiny<br/>
shard, and they often have to completely revise their current theories about<br/>
the history of a particular location. They just love finding out that they<br/>
were utterly wrong about something!<br/>

Fifteen years or so ago they did a dig on the banks of the Thames in a really <br/>
old part of London.  They found two things that &quot;changed history.&quot;  A folding <br/>
knife (like a pocket knife) and a banana peel.  Both were from before <br/>
historians had thought they should&#39;ve existed there.  So that&#39;s one way &quot;truth&quot; <br/>
changes!<br/>
