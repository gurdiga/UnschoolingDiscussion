<div id="ygrps-yiv-737723443">My kids and I thought this was great fun, we sent our new pimpy names <br/>
to our friends and they all played too.  We thought it was hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
Then somewhere along the line, one of my daughters (aka Pimptastic K. <br/>
Sneed) sent her pimp name to her whole address book, including her <br/>
grandpa, who then sent me an email that said &quot;This is so sad; does she <br/>
even know what a pimp is?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
It has been a great opportunity to discuss words, the use of language, <br/>
the subleties of humor, and the sex industry.  Good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I am pondering my response to my dad (who is already concerned that I <br/>
might not be giving my kids enough religious values), and wondered if <br/>
anyone here would care to share what they would say in the same <br/>
situation.<br/>

<br/>
situation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say it&#39;s more a reference to a character stereotype in movies <br/>
(mostly, these days, comedies) in which pimps are shown with garish animal-print <br/>
hats, purple velvet coats, crazed sunglasses and cartoonish cadillacs.  It&#39;s not <br/>
about real pimps or real prostitution.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was a &quot;pimp daddy&quot; at Halloween this year.  We worked quite a while on <br/>
his &quot;jeweled cane&quot; (improving a cheap storebought one that came with the <br/>
velvet suite into a solid black wood with gold tip really useable cane with the <br/>
same crazed glitter-in-water costume &quot;jewel&quot; top.  It was good for a few jokes.  <br/>
He borrowed a big-collar shirt from his dad&#39;s closet and some &quot;gold chains&quot; <br/>
from me (and a horny-toad necklace I just happened to have with much other 80&#39;s <br/>
stuff).<br/>
<br/>
Now just remind your kids not to copy grandpa on anything with the slang <br/>
phrase &quot;that&#39;s so gay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I objected to that the first few times I heard it, but the kids looked at me <br/>
blankly the way I looked at my dad when he objected to &quot;bitchen!&quot; in 1968, <br/>
assuming it had anything on earth with the term or idea &quot;bitch.&quot;   It didn&#39;t seem <br/>
to to anyone who was using it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the &#39;that&#39;s so gay&#39; among kids Holly&#39;s age has more to do with Big <br/>
Gay Al on South Park than anything else.<br/>

<br/>
I can see where your dad is coming from ... maybe your dad doesn&#39;t like the idea of pimps being a joke to his grandchildren; maybe he feels that they are &#39;too young&#39; to need to know about this part of our world (I don&#39;t know how old your kids are).  Perhaps laughing at &#39;pimp names&#39; is desensitizing our kids to the serious issues of prostitution, abuse and degradation of women, etc.  That being said, you took this opportunity to discuss words, language, and the sex industry with your children.  Have you considered sharing that fact with your father?  Letting him know what discussions were sparked while playing the name-game?  That might be somewhere to start.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think the &#39;that&#39;s so gay&#39; among kids Holly&#39;s age has more to do with Big <br/>

<br/>
When I was in elementary school (till &#39;89) and high school (till &#39;93) we used to say &quot;that&#39;s so gay&quot; and it was interchangeable with &quot;that&#39;s so retarded&quot; (sorry, I don&#39;t mean to offend anyone).  It just meant something like &#39;stupid&#39; or &#39;lame&#39;.  I can tell you almost certainly it didn&#39;t come from a TV show ... and I still (unfortunately) use those phrases today in the same context.<br/>

school in 1983.  That supports the claim that those phrases didn&#39;t come <br/>
from a TV show, as the same shows weren&#39;t on when you and I were in <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s regional?  I grew up in NE Pennsylvania.<br/>
<br/>
It was hard to train myself not to use those phrases, but once I moved <br/>
away and realized they weren&#39;t universally accepted, I was able to.<br/>

Among kids Holly&#39;s age, I think their main association with &quot;gay&quot; is humorous <br/>
stuff like South Park.  Not suggesting that&#39;s where they got it, but their <br/>
image is more likely that, just as kids&#39; image of &quot;pimp&quot; is more likely <br/>
comedy-routine pimp than honest, gritty whatever-much-older-people-are-thinking pimp.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard my kids&#39; friends use the term &quot;pimp&quot; to mean to make<br/>
something all gaudy and decked out to the max (like a car or outfit),<br/>
or to try to sell something (not just in reference to sex, but cars,<br/>
or concert tickets, or encyclopedias, or anything else).<br/>
<br/>
I think the word has lost a lot of the shock value it used to carry.<br/>

<br/>
I grew up in Southern Ontario, Canada ... a far cry from PA :o) Strange, though, that with the difference in location, and dates (even when considering Holly and her friends) we seem to have a similar slang.  It transends time ...<br/>

(PS: I do have a sense of humour ... my pimp name was Vicious D.A. Dogg ... lol)<br/>
