<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371079335">There are two blogs you might want to link.  They&#39;re not blogring  <br/>
kinds of blogs, because they&#39;re not documenting a family&#39;s days.<br/>
<br/>

Announcements of articles and news about homeschooling and  <br/>
unschooling.  It&#39;s a blog Laura Derrick started a few years back and  <br/>
let languish.  She has let Pam Sorooshian, Joyce Fetteroll and me  <br/>
help her revive it.  There are some new posts.  You might want to  <br/>
consider subscribing to it and maybe let us know if you see things we  <br/>
should list.  There&#39;s a link there, or you could leave a comment or  <br/>
write to one of us directly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My own blog which IS a part of the unschooling blogring, is http:// <br/>
