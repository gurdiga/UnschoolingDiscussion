Gosh I need to try Krispy Kremes my sister in UT raves about those.  I dont <br/>
think we have a Krispy Kreme in the Northeast do we?<br/>
Im craving a bavarian cream, a glazed crawler and a Dunkin Doughnuts coffee <br/>

I think our Maine nearest one is in Wells 20 min away but there are several <br/>
just over the NH line 2 miles away in Somersworth and Dover.  <br/>
