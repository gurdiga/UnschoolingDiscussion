<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123340589">The article published on Nov 8, 2011 in the NYT is by a grown woman who was<br/>
unschooled in the 1970&#39;s until she was 10 years old.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s especially interesting is that there&#39;s a side link to an article<br/>
about unschooling by the woman&#39;s mother that was published in the NYT in<br/>
the 1975, blog posts from her mother and father commenting on the current<br/>
article and more.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had time to go through all of it, but the tone of the main<br/>
article is unhappiness and resentment. It&#39;s pretty sad.<br/>

They were homeschooled, more than unschooled, and not very well.<br/>
<br/>
They hadn&#39;t seen any Hollywood movies. <br/>
They didn&#39;t own jeans?  (Implied, hinted...)<br/>
<br/>
And they went to school, in elementary grades (3rd, 5th and 6th grades?)<br/>
<br/>
I think anytime a parent thinks there should be a school schedule, but then fails to stick to that, the children don&#39;t kick into natural unschooling.   They think their parents are incompetent, and if the parents are blaming the kids for not paying attention or not &quot;working,&quot; then the kids might feel bad, and the relationship between parents and children isn&#39;t ideal.  &quot;Homeschooling&quot; can split that family.<br/>
<br/>
I hope one of the kids from that family will write up some of the fun parts--the seeing castles and such. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139026249">The author was really really young during the homeschooling years. She was 5 when she went to school.<br/>
It also sounds that she resented  NOT having money more than anything.<br/>
 It was more about the parents not working and not having money. She is short of calling her dad lazy ( well she does in other words).<br/>
 It is really not a nice or happy story. I wonder how someone so young would remember so much in so many details.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212429391">The author herself was not unschooled nor homeschooled.  It sounds like the<br/>
big resentment is *going* to school.  Like mid-stream they changed horses.<br/>
 This is not the sort of thing unschoolers do.   The parents chose to<br/>
homeschool, unschool and then send the kids to school.  So, she is angry<br/>
about how she was treated in school, being poor and missing the adventures.<br/>
 She was too young to be homeschooled at five.  It was her siblings who<br/>
struggled with going to school.  Sounds like Mexico and England were fun.<br/>
 Poverty and school were not fun.<br/>
<br/>
The adventure began and ended when mom and dad decided, without the kids<br/>
getting any preparation or input.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with you and it sounds as if the parents were really trying to meet<br/>
their own needs and the needs of the children came second<br/>
Definitely not unschoolers, at least not from my experience.<br/>
<br/>
The author did not seem to hold her parents in very high regard when she<br/>
referred to them as &#39;freeloading&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the word &quot;adventure&quot; in the article was actually a euphemism<br/>
for poverty and insecurity in a new place, not an exciting experience<br/>
that stretches your limits or self concept.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the years spent homeschooling would have been remembered more<br/>
fondly if the parents hadn&#39;t sent them to school with no preparation?<br/>
Would they have felt better about homeschooling if the parents had actually<br/>
either unschooled them OR homeschooled them, instead of what appears to<br/>
have been a haphazard hit and run approach to learning?<br/>
