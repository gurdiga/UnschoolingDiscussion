I had thought I could get through the e-mail but my foot is hurting too much <br/>
and so I have to go back to the couch with 300 unread messages.  So it goes!</div>

I&#39;m sitting at the computer cos my knee hurts too much to do more <br/>
than hobble so no housework for the day :-)<br/>
One child is busy slaughtering samurai on the playstation while the <br/>
other two are playing Game of Life. I did amuse myself for a while <br/>
sitting watching and pretending the be the kid-pegs they&#39;ve each <br/>
got in their cars. &quot;are we there yet?&quot; &quot;How much further?&quot; &quot;he hit <br/>
me...&quot;<br/>

Sandra.. I hope your foot heals soon. It&#39;s a good excuse to sit and <br/>
read, but I know it&#39;s a pain (no pun) when you want to get up and get <br/>
things done.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie</div>
