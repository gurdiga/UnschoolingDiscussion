on all my other wacko ideas...family bed, nursing a 2.5 yo etc). Any one have a <br/>

to strike a balance when given unlimited access to all foods? Jason (5.5 yo) has always<br/>
been picky. The only restrictions I have had on food have been to limit junk food.<br/>
I never forced him to eat things he does not like. He usually eats something different<br/>
from the rest of us (something easy to prepare, like pb&j). He has a very limited <br/>
diet, no veggies, pretty good assortment of fruits though. My parents always made me<br/>
eat small portions of veggies. And when they found out that I was swallowing my peas<br/>
whole (can&#39;t stand the taste or the consistency) I was only allowed to take a drink<br/>
after I chewed 10 times (so then I started piling the peas on the center of my tongue<br/>
and pretending to chew them by chewing around my tongue). I never ate veggies in <br/>
college and did not start trying them again until I had Jason. I have now found<br/>
out that I love broccoli, squash, cucumbers and several other veggies. But I still<br/>
hate peas and carrots (which I was made to eat). So needless to say, I did not want<br/>
Jason to have to wait until he had kids to discover that there were some veggies that<br/>
he likes! (Of course, dh says that he was forced to eat veggies and he still ate<br/>
them when he got older). Anyways, just a bit of background....oh one good thing is that he<br/>
is relatively good at trying things (just never likes them!)<br/>
<br/>
So anyone who would like to reassure me as we head on down this path, I would love to<br/>
hear! I have read the food discussions at unschooling.com and this does make sense to me.<br/>
I just hope that I can survive the binging period...especially with my 2 yo!<br/>

Well, I think you are taking the right path. I don&#39;t have any personal <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758310693">Hi Stephanie!<br/>
My DH is the same way. Whenever I introduce a new &quot;weird&quot; idea to him, at first he is very against it, then after I show him e-mails, websites, books, etc to back it up, he eventually just says &quot;whatever, we&#39;ll try it for a little bit&quot; then he always ends up admitting I was right, it was a good idea, and it is working! LOL I was just telling him yesterday that it would be so much simpler if he&#39;d just agree to begin with! He was this way with unschooling, not taking the doctor&#39;s word about everything regarding the kids, not getting the two youngest all their vacs, having a midwife birth, breastfeeding (then breastfeeding til 1 and now he&#39;s agreed to age 3! LOL), and oh so many other things. I&#39;m trying to work on him for an unassisted homebirth next time, but that&#39;s the one thing he&#39;s stood firm about for 6 years now, so I may not be able to get that one. <br/>
Good luck!!!!<br/>

Well Stephanie, congratulations on your victory, no matter how bittersweet <br/>
it may be! Just stick to it and I do think that eventually when all is well <br/>
and your husband sees that, he will have a change of heart. Just don&#39;t give <br/>
him a &quot;I told you so,&quot; they hate that!!!! (Sorry Todd!)<br/>
<br/>
I do know of other husbands of friends who have gone through the same thing. <br/>
Not just with food stuff but with the whole unschooling way. When people see <br/>
it working, they can&#39;t help but come to a better understanding.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the picky kid thing, I have two here. Well actually more like one <br/>
now. My first daughter was raised totally different from the other 3, school <br/>
and all the attachments. BUT, I was always rather unschooly in most of my <br/>
thoughts. I never made her eat stuff she didn&#39;t want to or make her clean <br/>
her plate or eat what and when I &#39;thought&#39; she should eat. She was an <br/>
excellent eater until she turned 2 years old. She totally cut out all meat <br/>
from her diet on her own. No red meat or chicken or fish. Cut out most <br/>
vegetables and fruits also. Loved the starches, pasta and potatoes and <br/>
breads. Ate her fair share of desserts but nothing major. She would eat <br/>
apples and corn and carrots, then it was all pasta and cereal and such. When <br/>
she started school, it was a big deal to find something she would take to <br/>
eat. I actually packed a thermos with garlic pasta in it for her. (the <br/>
teachers loved that one!)<br/>
<br/>
Cut to the chase, she&#39;s almost 17 now and you would never know she had been <br/>
such a picky kid. First of all, even though she still goes to school, she <br/>
gets sick less than we do. She&#39;s very healthy and now eats chicken and <br/>
steak, carrots, green beans, corn, grapes, etc. Point is she added to her <br/>
diet considerably on her own without any prompting from us. She can go out <br/>
anywhere and eat without anyone knowing she could never ever do that before.<br/>
<br/>
Added note here, our almost 8 year old son is doing the same thing. Started <br/>
out eating everything in sight and gradually started to cut things out of <br/>
his diet. He lives on PB&J, pizza, hot dogs, cheese, pasta, cereal, corn, <br/>
tortilla chips and sour cream!! He likes fast food chicken but not from <br/>
home. Go figure!! He&#39;s thin but not skinny and has more energy than all of <br/>
us put together. Hardly ever sick and when he is, it&#39;s no big deal. I <br/>
actually had blood taken from him when he was 4 as I started to worry so <br/>
much about how he ate. After the Dr. said he was fine, my husband brought up <br/>
the oldest and how at that time, she just started to add more food to her <br/>
menu. She was already almost 13 then and that&#39;s when I realized I needed to <br/>
stop worrying. She was fine and he was fine and what was the big deal. So I <br/>
had to feed him before we went out to dinner anywhere. So what???<br/>
<br/>
It does work out eventually. Sometimes it may seem like it&#39;s taking forever, <br/>
but trust them to know what they need and want and it will be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Our other 2 girls so far, eat everything put in front of them.<br/>

to a company picnic where all they ate was cookies and soda. Didn&#39;t want<br/>

for a vbac, he could not understand why I wanted to go through all<br/>
that. Felt it would have been easier to just schedule a csec. But he<br/>
did not give me a hard time when I hired a doula and switched obs<br/>
at 35 weeks (to an ob/midwife collaborative practice). Even after<br/>
my successful unmedicated hospital vbac, he did not seem overly <br/>
impressed. But this time around he has not batted an eye about still<br/>
nursing my 2.5 yo at least. :o) HeHeHe...just as he gets used<br/>
to me I go and find all sorts of new wacko ideas like unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
AH well, I just have to keep reminding myself that he will come around.<br/>
I just don&#39;t want him to think that I don&#39;t care what he thinks. It is<br/>
just that I tend to put more research and thought into our parenting.<br/>
He tends to do what his parents did and does not question mainstream<br/>
parenting. Lucky him to be married to me I guess!<br/>

&gt; I do know of other husbands of friends who have gone through <br/>
&gt; the same thing. <br/>
&gt; Not just with food stuff but with the whole unschooling way. <br/>
&gt; When people see <br/>
&gt; it working, they can&#39;t help but come to a better understanding.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I hope so! Right now I seem to still be hedging based on what I <br/>
think that dh wants me to do (not with food since I have his &quot;blessing&quot;)<br/>
but with letting things go (in dh&#39;s terms &quot;letting him get away with <br/>
things&quot;). I realized that things went much smoother during last week<br/>
when I was able let things go more then this weekend when I kept second<br/>
guessing myself based on what I think he wanted me to do. Think we <br/>
have to have a few more talks....<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Cut to the chase, she&#39;s almost 17 now and you would never <br/>
&gt; know she had been <br/>
&gt; such a picky kid. First of all, even though she still goes to <br/>
&gt; school, she <br/>
&gt; gets sick less than we do. She&#39;s very healthy and now eats <br/>
&gt; chicken and <br/>
&gt; steak, carrots, green beans, corn, grapes, etc. Point is she <br/>
&gt; added to her <br/>
&gt; diet considerably on her own without any prompting from us. <br/>
&gt; She can go out <br/>
&gt; anywhere and eat without anyone knowing she could never ever <br/>
&gt; do that before.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I am hoping! That Jason will develop his own better<br/>
eating habits earlier then I did!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Added note here, our almost 8 year old son is doing the same <br/>
&gt; thing. Started <br/>
&gt; out eating everything in sight and gradually started to cut <br/>
&gt; things out of <br/>
&gt; his diet. He lives on PB&J, pizza, hot dogs, cheese, pasta, <br/>
&gt; cereal, corn, <br/>
&gt; tortilla chips and sour cream!! He likes fast food chicken <br/>
&gt; but not from <br/>
&gt; home. Go figure!! He&#39;s thin but not skinny and has more <br/>
&gt; energy than all of <br/>
&gt; us put together. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds familiar...only without the pasta and cheese and sour cream! And <br/>
ditto on the fast food chix but not the home one. Glad to know that we<br/>
are not alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523698573">&lt;&lt; Finally wore down dh, he basically just threw up his  hands and said that <br/>
if<br/>
the boys wind up on Jerry Springer because they are 300 lbs and suing McDs, <br/>
it <br/>
will be my fault. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hate those kinds of curses.<br/>
<br/>
BUT on the other hands, by turning life into a bet like that, YOU WILL WIN!<br/>
Because even if they&#39;re 300 lbs and suing McD&#39;s, as long as they&#39;re not on <br/>
Jerry Springer, your husband&#39;s dire prediction didn&#39;t come true!<br/>
<br/>
My husband weighs in the 300 lb range, and his mother was and still is one of <br/>
the most food controlling humans ever lived.  But he was a pudgy little baby, <br/>
and I&#39;m SURE she measured his formula to the ounce and charted it.  (WWII <br/>
nurse)<br/>
<br/>
So rather than saying it&#39;s genetic, or that her method didn&#39;t work, she just <br/>
says he ate too much once he left her house.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s kind of a change of subject, yet it isn&#39;t.  IF the traditional way <br/>
worked in some predictable clockwork way, why is anyone overweight or <br/>
anorexic?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Wish that I had more of his support, or at least him being<br/>
open to this working&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t take so long, I bet.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really do feel sorry for him sometimes...I am basically asking him to <br/>
re-think<br/>
everything that he knows about parenting. Not to mention the fact that dh <br/>
really<br/>
thrives on control. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he can get a new hobby.  My husband started doing woodworking and <br/>
woodcarving lately.  Keeps him busy, he listens to music while he works, he&#39;s <br/>
very controlling about how his chisels and table saw and stuff are put away.  <br/>
He controls his workshop. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any one have a <br/>
previously reluctant dh who has &quot;seen the light&quot; care to share their story? I <br/>
would love to hear it! <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

charge off in a new direction unless I was pretty confident, so by the time <br/>
the kids were old enough to talk about it we&#39;d been together over ten years, <br/>
and he had a lot of confidence in MY confidence.<br/>

working right now with Jason, because we have had junk food restrictions<br/>
for quite awhile now and we were still having arguments and him begging <br/>
for it. It had gotten to the point that I would not want to make cookies<br/>
with him, because I hated feeling like I had to restrict him on eating<br/>
them and I did not like the arguments that ensued. Kind of sad, actually<br/>
now that I think about it...not being able to share making cookies with<br/>
my kids without arguments. Kind of like how sad it is that the &quot;experts&quot; <br/>
say we should not rock and nurse our babies to sleep for fear of &quot;bad <br/>
habits&quot;. One of life&#39;s most simple joys and &quot;experts&quot; make us feel <br/>
guilty about it. Geesh. I feel another light bulb going off....these<br/>
same experts tell us how we have to we have to be diligent as parents,<br/>
controlling our kids behaviors, controlling what foods they eat, what<br/>
time they go to bed, how much tv they watch. If we don&#39;t we will have<br/>
spoiled kids who have no self-discipline (my dad&#39;s biggest complaint <br/>
about me hsing) who do nothing but watch tv. We are told that we are<br/>
bad parents if we don&#39;t. That of course kids will complain, but we need<br/>
to be strong, after all we are their parents, not their friends....<br/>
<br/>

&gt; stuff are put away.  <br/>
&gt; He controls his workshop. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually he recently started working out at the gym. He had gone<br/>
up two pants sizes over the past year and decided that he didn&#39;t<br/>
like that. He goes everyday (he comes home from work early or <br/>
goes after the boys are in bed) at least 30 mins, every other day <br/>
is 1.5 hrs. He researched his work outs online and in magazines.<br/>
He has a very complicated regimen that he tracks in his palm pilot<br/>
(or whatever newest gizmo that has come out lately). He is also <br/>
controlling his diet, eating at certain times, cutting out fat (making<br/>
me do so as well, which is a good thing!), drinking shakes and eating <br/>
protein bars. And it is working. He is looking great. <br/>
<br/>
Compare that to me...I have just started getting up a little early and<br/>
going for a morning walk. Not sure how far I walk, but am usually out for<br/>
about 30-45 mins. I am trying to cut back on fat, but have a bag of halloween<br/>
m&ms in front of me now. Am trying to drink more water...<br/>
<br/>
I do hope that he can get his control issues out during his work out! But I am <br/>
not sure. I have been trying to share with  him things that work, but I swear he<br/>
thinks that I am making things up. I have found that if Jason is doing something that<br/>
really pushes my buttons, if I walk away, he stops it. If he runs away from me when it<br/>
is time to get ready for bed (we read for awhile and if he is not tired he stays up<br/>
with me in my craft room while I do my rubber stamping, but he has to be upstairs so<br/>
that Jeff can walk Kyle to sleep (who is usually tired around 8 or 8:30)) I just <br/>
go upstairs. Jason always follows in a couple of minutes. This bugs Jeff to no end.<br/>
Feels that if he says that it is time to get ready for bed, it is time to get ready<br/>
for bed. If Jason does not listen, Jeff gets mad, chases him down, carries him <br/>
crying upstairs. Jason gets upset and says that Jeff &quot;hurt&quot; him, Jeff says that Jason<br/>
should listen to him yadda yadda yadda. Now Jeff says that my way teaches him that he<br/>
does not have to listen to me (um...yeah, but he does come upstairs within 5 mins<br/>
and we have a nice peaceful rest of the evening vs an upset kid and upset dad). Ah but<br/>
I digress....<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish that he would put as much thought into his parenting as he does <br/>
into his workout. He loves the boys, but he is perfectly fine with following the<br/>
mainstream parenting line. Actually it would not bother me as much if he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
fight with me on things so much. Considering that I do put a lot more thought<br/>
and research into my parenting....<br/>

Good thing too or we might be in trouble LOL! Actually, he did tell my <br/>
dad this summer (when my dad was complaining about our decision to hs) that<br/>
I was a smart person and that he knew that I had put a lot of thought into this<br/>
and that he trusted m to do what was best for the boys. Hmmm...maybe I need<br/>
to remind him of this LOL! Actually I think the problem lately is that I have<br/>
been focusing on what he should not be doing rather than on things that he can <br/>
do. I know that I would get tired of hearing what I was doing wrong. I think that<br/>
I need to take the same approach I have been taking with the boys...model, model,<br/>
model. Teaching is not working (should I be surprised? LOL!). So I guess a little <br/>
unschooling is in order...either that or I need to hit him over the head with <br/>
something....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me ramble...<br/>

I didn&#39;t know there was any other pop/soda than Tab!  Sad, huh? <br/>
I was on a diet my whole life and I never weighed more than 150 lbs and I&#39;m 5 feet 9 1/2 inches!  I do now! But point is, if I just live my life and not worry about fat or what I look like, I lose weight, hmmm.  I wish everyone could just love themselves and get over it!  That&#39;s why letting my children choose what to eat is sooo important to me and you know what, they are just fine!  <br/>
Gee who would uv thunk that we should eat when we are hungry and it might not be at the exact times as everyone else??  And its ok to eat chips sometimes and eat candy sometimes and chocolate, sometimes.<br/>
My big discovery in the last week or so is that I am craving less things since starting yoga.  Some one came over this weekend and he loves chocolate like I do and was complaining I didn&#39;t have any.  I had to stop and think, yeah, I guess I havn&#39;t bought any for a while??????????What&#39;s wrong with me or right with me?  <br/>

going for a morning walk. Not sure how far I walk, but am usually out for<br/>
about 30-45 mins. I am trying to cut back on fat, but have a bag of halloween<br/>
m&ms in front of me now. Am trying to drink more water...<br/>
<br/>
I do hope that he can get his control issues out during his work out! But I am <br/>
not sure. I have been trying to share with  him things that work, but I swear he<br/>
thinks that I am making things up. I have found that if Jason is doing something that<br/>
really pushes my buttons, if I walk away, he stops it. If he runs away from me when it<br/>
is time to get ready for bed (we read for awhile and if he is not tired he stays up<br/>
with me in my craft room while I do my rubber stamping, but he has to be upstairs so<br/>
that Jeff can walk Kyle to sleep (who is usually tired around 8 or 8:30)) I just <br/>
go upstairs. Jason always follows in a couple of minutes. This bugs Jeff to no end.<br/>
Feels that if he says that it is time to get ready for bed, it is time to get ready<br/>
for bed. If Jason does not listen, Jeff gets mad, chases him down, carries him <br/>
crying upstairs. Jason gets upset and says that Jeff &quot;hurt&quot; him, Jeff says that Jason<br/>
should listen to him yadda yadda yadda. Now Jeff says that my way teaches him that he<br/>
does not have to listen to me (um...yeah, but he does come upstairs within 5 mins<br/>
and we have a nice peaceful rest of the evening vs an upset kid and upset dad). Ah but<br/>
I digress....<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish that he would put as much thought into his parenting as he does <br/>
into his workout. He loves the boys, but he is perfectly fine with following the<br/>
mainstream parenting line. Actually it would not bother me as much if he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
fight with me on things so much. Considering that I do put a lot more thought<br/>
and research into my parenting....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband learned a long time ago that I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
&gt; change my life and <br/>
&gt; charge off in a new direction unless I was pretty confident, <br/>
&gt; so by the time <br/>
&gt; the kids were old enough to talk about it we&#39;d been together <br/>
&gt; over ten years, <br/>
&gt; and he had a lot of confidence in MY confidence.<br/>
<br/>

Good thing too or we might be in trouble LOL! Actually, he did tell my <br/>
dad this summer (when my dad was complaining about our decision to hs) that<br/>
I was a smart person and that he knew that I had put a lot of thought into this<br/>
and that he trusted m to do what was best for the boys. Hmmm...maybe I need<br/>
to remind him of this LOL! Actually I think the problem lately is that I have<br/>
been focusing on what he should not be doing rather than on things that he can <br/>
do. I know that I would get tired of hearing what I was doing wrong. I think that<br/>
I need to take the same approach I have been taking with the boys...model, model,<br/>
model. Teaching is not working (should I be surprised? LOL!). So I guess a little <br/>
unschooling is in order...either that or I need to hit him over the head with <br/>
something....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me ramble...<br/>
