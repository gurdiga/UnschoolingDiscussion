<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624634183">I would like to share a story about how my son learned to ride his bike.  At <br/>
the end of last summer he was learning to ride his bike.  By the beginning of <br/>
this spring he was have some trouble riding it.  One of the neighbor boys <br/>
teased him about not being able to ride his bike.  After that he didn&#39;t want <br/>
to ride anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I did not push him.  In my heart I knew that he could do it if he wanted to.  <br/>
So I let it be...which was hard for me not to push and force the issue.  He <br/>
decide that he would roller blade instead...something he could be better.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, while we were outside playing and no one was around to tease him, <br/>
he wanted to ride his bike.  With a little help on how to get started <br/>
pedaling, he was off riding and turning corners.  The joy on his face..WOW<br/>
<br/>
He did fall a few times but he would get back up and try again.  He was <br/>
determined to ride.  One time he ran into the side of a brick house...ouch He <br/>
was o.k.  He just got back up and started riding again.<br/>
<br/>
I told my husband that our son is the type of child that watches and learns <br/>
and will not try anything new unless he knows that he can do it.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew that he could do it.  <br/>
<br/>
I am happy to have a place to share our little unschooling moments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586039148">My son did the same sort of thing...Put the bike away on his own, and then one<br/>
day got on it, and took off never looking back.  I couldn&#39;t believe it!  Mom was<br/>
speechless.<br/>
