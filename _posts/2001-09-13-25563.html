<br/>
Think about your own family.  Do the members pitch in to do what needs to be<br/>
done?  Or do they tell you &quot;no&quot; because some jobs are too menial for them?<br/>
Do the members get food, clothing, shelter, even art supplies based on need?<br/>
Or do you tie all of that to what you are willing to pay for certain<br/>
services?<br/>
<br/>
Socialism is about the government controlling everything and making it<br/>
&quot;fair&quot;.  True communism is about the government stepping out of it.  It is<br/>
like people who believe children will not make good, caring, even altruistic<br/>
decisions unless forced to (socialism) vs. people believing kids want to<br/>
contribute, care about the greater good and are basically fair and caring<br/>
human beings (communism).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265799400">&lt;&lt;what one book would you recommend&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The book that I have read that I think shows pure communism in action is<br/>
&quot;Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life&quot;.  The man was never a member of a<br/>
communist party but definitely lived the life.  I wanted to name my youngest<br/>
son after him.  Yuppie capitalist dh pointed out that naming a kid Che was<br/>
the best way to ensure he would work on Wall Street out of pure spite.  So<br/>
we ended up with just Daniel followed by the initial C.<br/>
<br/>
Please send me info on the group in New Braunsfels.  They are only about 20<br/>
minutes from us.  My email address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jnjstau@...">jnjstau@...</a><br/>
