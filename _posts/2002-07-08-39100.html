<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103507857">why does he have to be in that class anyway? he&#39;s not learning anything useful.. sounds like .. as someone else mentioned.. it is just a situation that can erode is self esteem.. <br/>
why can&#39;t he be with the adults at church? i would never insist my child continue to be subjected to a situation like that.. my son faced that type of environment in jr hi.. i feel bad that i did not immediately insiste he be removed from it.. of course that would have been a big deal around here(&#39;specially his father) and i have not given him a choice with high school.. <br/>
<br/>
it seems to me that you confirmed that it is a waste of his time to be there.. why would he have to learn to deal with a group of children obviously behind him in emotional development at this point in his life. i do not see the situation, as you described it, as a shortcoming on his part. <br/>

  &gt;&gt;And another thing! Forcing a child into a group situation where he has to do what the group wants even if it goes against his better judgment, only serves to break a child down. It erodes their self confidence, it teaches them that they are not important.<br/>
          Which is exactly what I saw in his class today.  He needs to learn to approach others less confrontationally, but I don&#39;t think this is the group he needs to learn it on.  I feel badly that things went this far before I found there was a problem, but all his other teachers said that things were fine when I asked.  They were always saying how well behaved he and  his sister were.  He needs to be pulled out of the class so he can feel good about the standards he has chosen to uphold, and once he is more at ease, we can work on how to help the others see his view point (and work on him understanding theirs!).  Or am I wrong?   Debi<br/>
