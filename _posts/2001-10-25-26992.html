<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821418593">&lt;&lt;Frustratingly for them, their oldest, Lily, was VERY pink.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest daughter was also very pink. She always wanted to wear dresses and I, considering myself a proper  feminist, dragged my feet about getting them for her. Her Waldorf kindergarten teachers mother had a consignment shop and one day brought to school an armload of old dresses for Kira to wear. She was thrilled. <br/>
<br/>
When Kira was in the second or third grade she tore a picture out of a magazine and taped it to the wall in her room. It was of a beautiful woman, lovely hair and clothes, with a pretty little girl sitting on her lap and playing with her long pearls. They both were visions of femininity. I have that picture somewhere in a memory box.<br/>
