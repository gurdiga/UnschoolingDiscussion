<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018961235">Hi, all--<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Jodi Vender from Havertown, PA. I&#39;m mom to 1-year-old Caroline, <br/>
and haven&#39;t  yet decided what approach to schooling we&#39;re going <br/>
to take.  I&#39;m also a geographer, finishing a PhD at Penn State; I <br/>
used to work at the National Geographic Society; still do geography <br/>
education consulting and coordinate the PA state geography bee.  See <br/>
http://www.personal.psu.edu/jav106 for more about me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a lot of reading about homeschooling, attended a hs <br/>
conference earlier this summer, and am participating in a number of <br/>
discussion lists to get a sense of what&#39;s going on with various <br/>
approaches to homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working with the Geography Education National Implementation <br/>
Project (GENIP-  see http://genip.tamu.edu) to learn about how <br/>
homeschoolers are &quot;doing&quot; geography, and what resources they&#39;d like <br/>
to see to help teach and learn geography. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m extremely interested in discussing--via this list or privately--<br/>
the following topics (or others I may not have thought of):<br/>
<br/>
*where or how geography fits into your child&#39;s day;  what resources <br/>
do you use?<br/>
<br/>
*how you define geography (subject of much debate even among <br/>
geographers!)<br/>
<br/>
*what other geography resources you&#39;re aware of, even if you haven&#39;t <br/>
used them<br/>
<br/>
* what kinds of geography resources you&#39;d like to see/use to help <br/>
you do geography with your children  <br/>
<br/>
*how you think the community of professional geographers <br/>
could/should interact with homeschoolers/unschoolers<br/>
<br/>
In return, I&#39;ll be happy to share a list of some of my favorite <br/>
geography resources and/or try to answer questions you might have.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for sharing,<br/>
<br/>
Jodi</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling, like unit studies and school at home and eclectic and Sonlight<br/>
and so on, is one approach to homeschooling. But unschooling is unique among<br/>
homeschooling approaches in many ways. For one, we don&#39;t separate &quot;subjects&quot;<br/>
from life. To an unschooler -- as with adults who are learning by reading<br/>
novels and watching TV and pursuing hobbies and learning what they need as<br/>
they need it for their jobs and so forth -- geography isn&#39;t a topic to be<br/>
studied (unless it&#39;s a hobby or an interest! :-). Geography is a tool that a<br/>
child may (unconsciously) pick up to explore whatever interests them or a<br/>
parent may use to help a child understand something they&#39;re curious about.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I don&#39;t pull out a map because it&#39;s good for my daughter to<br/>
know more about geography. I pull out a map to help her understand where<br/>
we&#39;re going or where we are or a relationship between two places. A map is a<br/>
tool.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *where or how geography fits into your child&#39;s day;  what resources<br/>
&gt; do you use?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It fits into my daughter&#39;s day as it fits into an adult&#39;s day. I don&#39;t use<br/>
resources *for* geography. But we use geography (without separating it) as a<br/>
tool *for* real life.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is interested in following sports. Sports teams exist in real<br/>
cities. They play in real weather appropriate (though sometimes unseasonal!<br/>
;-) to the cities the Boston/New England teams are in which impacts the game<br/>
and comes up naturally in discussion. Teams have to travel between cities<br/>
and that impacts the schedule. Games played on the west coast at 7PM start<br/>
at 10PM for us on the east coast.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use sports to learn geography. Geography (without specifically<br/>
separating it) gets used in various ways as she explores what interests her<br/>
(sports and Japan and creating her own worlds and cat breeds and ...)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *how you define geography (subject of much debate even among<br/>
&gt; geographers!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where towns and people are, the shape of the land and to some extent why<br/>
it&#39;s shaped that way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *what other geography resources you&#39;re aware of, even if you haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; used them<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only thing that comes to mind is surveyor&#39;s tools.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; * what kinds of geography resources you&#39;d like to see/use to help<br/>
&gt; you do geography with your children<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to have a map -- maybe a computer program -- that I could import<br/>
pictures and type text into. ItÂ might be important in school for a map to<br/>
show what the major exports and imports of Peru are (so kids can forget them<br/>
after the test ;-), but it would be more interesting to note that this<br/>
week&#39;s potatoes came from Peru. And to see pictures of cousins and sports<br/>
team emblems in various parts of the US.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *how you think the community of professional geographers<br/>
&gt; could/should interact with homeschoolers/unschoolers<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By being flexible and understanding that homeschoolers won&#39;t necessarily be<br/>
recreating school at home. Even nonunschoolers are often approaching<br/>
learning from an individual point of view rather than a mass education point<br/>
of view. It takes different resources and approaches to help one child be<br/>
the best her she can be than to help a whole class learn what it&#39;s scheduled<br/>
to learn. So geography for homeschoolers won&#39;t necessarily be approached as<br/>
a subject to be learned but as a collection of tools to help kids explore<br/>
their interests.<br/>

Pam S. once posted a great story about how much California geography her <br/>
daughters learned from going on family trips.  When one of them was in <br/>
junior college she recognized all of the professor&#39;s geography-related <br/>
slides.  (Someone please correct the details.)<br/>
<br/>
I would go further and say that memorizing the locations of cities that <br/>
you&#39;ve never been to, that you&#39;ve never seen pictures or video of is <br/>
truly meaningless.  I think really geographic understanding comes from <br/>
being on the ground somewhere and walking, biking or driving through the <br/>
place and *seeing* it.<br/>
<br/>
I am a visual learner, so I am biased.  But knowing that Frankfort is <br/>
the capital of Kentucky (if in fact it is) is not knowledge, it&#39;s trivia.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS   For a song about state capitals, I like the one done by the cartoon <br/>
Animaniacs. &lt;g&gt;  If you have to memorize tidbits about US geography, <br/>
music is a powerful way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
PPS  I papered my front entry hall in maps because I think they are <br/>
beautiful.  Mostly recycled ones from National Geographic, with a theme, <br/>
like biodiversity.  I had a bedroom decorated with maps when I was a kid.</div>

--graphy isn&#39;t &quot;study,&quot; it&#39;s images, charting (photoGRAPHY, calliGRAPHY)<br/>
<br/>
Here a geography question is a history-of-English (and Greek roots) matter. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We studied a map of Europe briefly the other day to see how someone could or <br/>
would drive from England (or Amsterdam, or France, once they got off the <br/>
ferry) to Greece.  Not south of the mountains, north of them, we figured.  Turned <br/>
out though our friends who are going to the Olympics are flying to Greece and <br/>
renting a car.  So it didn&#39;t matter anymore.  But that didn&#39;t keep each person <br/>
involved from making some several new connections in their minds, none of <br/>
which needed to be reported to the other three there.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like math.  (No, I guess that&#39;s topology...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH NO!!!!!!   #4 definition on topology ties back to topography, which is one <br/>
facet of geography, which no longer is what it was when the term was coined.  <br/>
 So...  Does that mean the whole world is made up of related ideas and <br/>

<br/>
toÂ·pogÂ·raÂ·phy n<br/>
1.  the study and mapping of the features on the surface of land, including <br/>
natural features such as mountains and rivers and constructed features such as <br/>
highways and railroads<br/>
2.  the features on the surface of a particular area of land<br/>
3. a study or detailed description of the various features of any object or <br/>
entity and the relationships between them<br/>
<br/>
toÂ·polÂ·oÂ·gy n<br/>
1.  the study of the properties of figures that are independent of size or <br/>
shape and are not changed by stretching, bending, knotting, or twisting<br/>
2.  the family of all open subsets of a mathematical set, including the set <br/>
itself and the empty set, which is closed under set union and finite <br/>
intersection<br/>
3.  the anatomy of a specific part of the body<br/>
4.  the study of changes in topography that occur over time and, in <br/>
particular, of how such changes taking place in a particular area affect the history of <br/>
that area<br/>
5.  the relationships between elements linked together in a system, for <br/>
example, a computer network (formal)</div>

I hope so.  :)<br/>

I know about topography because I was in the Army and you do a lot of map  <br/>
reading and you always get topographical maps, which show the elevations and  <br/>
such.  I also took a map reading seminar at an outdoorswoman conference,  and I <br/>
found out you can order topographical maps of every place in the US from  the <br/>
government.<br/>
 <br/>
So I thought what you described that you were calling geography was really  <br/>
topography.  But it&#39;s a few posts back now and I can&#39;t remember  exactly.<br/>

That&#39;s not an argument for memorizing the capital of Kentucky if one doesn&#39;t <br/>

Drat.  &lt;g&gt;  You&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband briefly taught 7th and 8th grade social studies, I tried <br/>
to read stuff about ancient African civilizations.  Because I had holes <br/>
in my knowledge where the African history, and particularly the African <br/>
geography should be, I would read stuff like the X---- people travelled <br/>
up the Y---- river and attacked the Z----- people living in the city of <br/>
A-----, I didn&#39;t learn much because I couldn&#39;t picture what was <br/>
happening.  (And I was aware that his students probably felt this way <br/>
all the time when urged to imagine historic events in far-flung unknown <br/>
places.)<br/>

Right.  I think having kids memorize US state capitals in school is <br/>
&quot;pointless&quot;, but there CAN be a real point or real reason for wanting or <br/>

Right.  I think having kids memorize US state capitals in school  is <br/>
&quot;pointless&quot;, but there CAN be a real point or real reason for wanting  or <br/>
needed geographical knowledge.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Memorizing the states is bad enough. The school Cameron attended required  <br/>
the seventh graders to memorize all the countries of AFRICA! <br/>
 <br/>
And the point is....?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011309543">I have one dd (9) that is a geography nut.  From the time she was only four<br/>
years old she was just drawn to maps.  One of her favorite things is our<br/>
globe.  I couldn&#39;t even begin to tell you how many hours that thing has<br/>
spent in her hands.  A couple years ago we were playing at the elementary<br/>
school that I went as a child and we peeked in the windows.  There on the<br/>
top shelf was a globe, in each classroom.  I remembered seeing those globes<br/>
up there when I was a child but we never got to hold them or play with them.<br/>
My 9 yo dd has a better understanding of the world as a whole (as opposed to<br/>
being broken down into small maps that don&#39;t seem related to each other)<br/>
than most adults, by a LONG shot.  It was her interest in geography that got<br/>
*me* interested in it and I&#39;ve done my best to keep up with her, but her<br/>
memory works much better than mine does these days.  Her favorite geography<br/>
tools are maps, globes, and games.  We all like Take Off and Where in the<br/>
USA is Carmen Sandiago is o.k.  For a while she enjoyed playing the map game<br/>

My other dd (7) has very little interest in geography.   She is great at<br/>
spinning a yarn though.  Look out Stephen King!  LOL!<br/>

I did that in 8th grade.  Every nation in the world, all major ports and <br/>
rivers.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of those countries I memorized don&#39;t exist anymore.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I wish I knew them, but I guess I can learn.<br/>
<br/>
Even sillier than that, I think, it the Well Trained Mind thing where <br/>
they memorize the pharoahs of Egypt.  Those guys (and gals) are ALL dead. <br/>
<br/>
My seventh grade social studies was pretty Eurocentric.  We learned all <br/>
the European countries and capitals.  But now there are new ones!  I <br/>
want at least a partial refund of the time that I spent sitting in that <br/>
plastic chair because what I learned didn&#39;t last!<br/>

PS   The capital of Finland is Helsinki, but there isn&#39;t a Yugoslavia <br/>
for Belgrade to be the capital of any more.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859811271">my dd learned to read maps really early because we went on alot of road <br/>
trips by ourselves. i would hand her the map and tell her &quot;your  the <br/>
navigator&quot;. when we went on a road trip with my niece to visit a college <br/>
(after 12 years of school) she didn&#39;t know how to read one. she had never <br/>
been on road trips and the school map lessons didn&#39;t stick. the next road <br/>
trip i went on with her i handed my dd the map and my niece said &quot;i can do <br/>
it. i know how to read a map now&quot;. amazing what you can learn when it <br/>
applies to the real world.<br/>

Plastic!?<br/>
We had wood.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not true that what you learned didn&#39;t last.<br/>
Your kid&#39;s home, right?<br/>
Choosing his own chair?<br/>
Standing up to stretch his butt any time he wants to?<br/>
