<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, if you ask me, THAT&#39;s a good enough reason to<br/>
&gt;keep them from  going.  I  don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;selfish at all.  Your children need you  every day.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I 100% agree.  That&#39;s enough of a valid and compelling<br/>
reason right there.  It&#39;s not dishonest to simply not<br/>
tell the grandparents the other philosophical or<br/>
psychological reasons for your not liking the church<br/>
going.  They become completely unnecessary in light of<br/>
this new information regarding your schedule.  I would<br/>
have put it at the top of my other reply on this<br/>
topic, but this message didn&#39;t come until after I<br/>
wrote my reply.  Were it me, I would just tell the<br/>
grandparents this activity was cutting too much into<br/>
my precious time with the kids and that I would love<br/>
for them to do (fill in the activity and time) with<br/>
the kids instead.<br/>
