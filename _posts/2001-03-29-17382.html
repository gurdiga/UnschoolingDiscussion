<div id="ygrps-yiv-587931766">Hello,<br/>
I just joined the list and have been enjoying listening in for the last <br/>
couple of days. I am generally a lurker in these types of groups, but you <br/>
have drawn me out of hiding.<br/>
<br/>
First, let me introduce myself. I live in NH with my husband and two small <br/>
children (ds 2 � and dd 1). We decided on homeschooling before our daughter <br/>
was born, but I never liked the idea of school-at-home (why not just send <br/>
them to school if you&#39;re going to use the same flawed educational <br/>
techniques?). Then I read some John Holt and quickly got converted to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What drew me in to the conversation at this point is the debate over <br/>
Christian vs. inclusive groups. As my kids are so young, I haven&#39;t yet <br/>
started looking into the groups that may be available here, so I can&#39;t tell <br/>
you to which type of group I belong. But I will say this, even though I am a <br/>
Christian and could in all good conscience sign a statement of faith and <br/>
join such a group, I probably would not. Christianity by its very nature <br/>
should be inclusive and these types of groups sometimes give Christians a <br/>
bad name. I don&#39;t mean to insult anyone who belongs to such a group, I&#39;m <br/>
sure they offer great support. But I did not choose to keep my kids out of <br/>
school in order to keep them isolated from the greater world, but to immerse <br/>
them in it. Part of that is meeting people who do not share our beliefs and <br/>
learning from them. So, while I assume you were in jest, please do not <br/>
include a statement of lack of faith in your group, because then where would <br/>
I go?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure if I&#39;ve made much sense, or clearly said what I meant, but please <br/>
bear with me, I&#39;m not used to actually posting. And, I&#39;m sorry to make me <br/>
first post such a long one � I&#39;ll try not be so long-winded in the future.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t agree more!  Something about signing a &quot;statement of faith&quot; just <br/>
seems creepy.  It makes me think of scary events like inquisitions.  So far, <br/>
without exception, it seems that these groups exclude and if they don&#39;t see <br/>

<br/>
There is only one homeschool group here and they require the signing of a <br/>
statement of Faith. This sits wrong with me. I am Christian but I see no <br/>
reason why homeschoolers of other religions or no religion cannot join us in <br/>
coop classes and pe. We enjoy meeting and being with all types of people. <br/>
Matter of fact a friend of mine is Catholic and she said that the priest at <br/>
her church told her to not sign it. Why would a Christian group make a <br/>
statement of Faith that a Catholic cannot sign? I do not like it and so we <br/>
have no homeschool group. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854632498">Just jumping in on this thread.....There is a homeschool group here that my <br/>
sil belongs too.  I went with her once and was very excited to join it until <br/>
she showed me the Statement of Faith.  I can&#39;t remember it exactly, I just <br/>
remember that it said something about not being open to homosexuals or <br/>
unmarried families (this did not include divorced single parents)  I was <br/>
actually shocked that a Christian group would put this in writing.  Sometimes <br/>
I am tempted to go back and sign it just so that my kids can be part of the <br/>
coop, but then, what would that say about me?  I would be so ashamed if <br/>
anyone ever found out that I signed something like that.  So, we are not part <br/>
of this group.  And, I really have not put any effort into finding any <br/>
others.  <br/>
