&gt; In case I forget, I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone<br/>
&gt;  for tomorrow a  Happy Pi Day! (March 14, 3-14)  We celebrate by eating<br/>
&gt; various kinds of pie all  day, and with math problems and puzzles, and<br/>
&gt;  an occasional toast to Pythagoras<br/>
&gt; and Archimedes.  One of our favorite holidays!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of our favorites, too!<br/>
<br/>
We make square pies (because Pi r squared!).<br/>
<br/>
Found out just the other day that the King Sized bag of plain M&Ms comes in<br/>
packages weighing 3.14 ounces.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We found some Pi Day songs on the web.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing this for about 4 years now.<br/>

being non-metric.<br/>
