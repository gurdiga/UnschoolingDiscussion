<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208925585">Because several Christian unschoolers have joined the list lately, I wanted <br/>
to post a link to something fairly recent Tammy Cardwell wrote, which also <br/>
has links to several other articles on unschooling written from a Christian <br/>
point of view.<br/>
<br/>
(I was the person who asked Tammy that question...   if you read it you&#39;ll <br/>
see.)<br/>
