<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a daughter who wants to play the violin. She&#39;s taken lessons, gotten <br/>
&gt; bored, and dropped the lessons.She didn&#39;t drop the violin, really, but her <br/>
&gt; progress dropped to an imperceptible level. She takes it out, occasionally, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; plays stuff from her old beginning book and painstakingly picks out pieces <br/>
&gt; she absolutely loves - from musical theater. The process is very very very <br/>
&gt; slow. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IF she had a teacher - which she wants, by the way - who would let her <br/>
&gt; REALLY <br/>
&gt; pick her own music - even if it is far beyond her ability - she&#39;d stick <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; it. What she wants is a teacher to help her out with the music she&#39;s <br/>
&gt; interested in playing - not a teacher to put her through her paces - <br/>
&gt; following the standard systematic progression through the standard lesson <br/>
&gt; books.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve talked to teachers. They say she&#39;s being lazy and that, if she wants <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; play, she has to pay the same price they did - go through the required <br/>
&gt; steps. <br/>
&gt; They say that if she doesn&#39;t have that self-discipline (or get it imposed <br/>
&gt; by <br/>
&gt; me) that she won&#39;t be able to learn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have always taught piano and voice this way....34 years now~ since i was <br/>
11...luckily i had an unschooled piano teacher (at least unschooled in the <br/>
music field) and he was so creative and encourage me to teach neighborhood <br/>
kids at age 11. so...i KNOW that the reason i have been successful all these <br/>
years(this is my main career as a single mom) is because i have always let <br/>
the students pcik their own music~ you can learn the same stuff from bach and <br/>
billy joel and and N Sync.....the kids have varied tastes and end up trying <br/>
lots of different styles because they know they can here! No PRESCRIPTION  <br/>
teaching here! DENISE<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But perhaps you could incorporate some of that. Find out what it was that<br/>
&gt; they heard that drew them to the violin, or the kinds of things that kids<br/>
&gt; find cool until they get used to listening for themselves. Maybe they could<br/>
&gt; bring in recordings/music of things they like and mess around with it so<br/>
&gt; that learning how to hold the bow isn&#39;t the point of the lesson. It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; skill that gets picked while working towards something they want. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I ALWAYS wanted my cello teachers to just PLAY for me. They almost never ever <br/>
ever played and when they did it was almost always to show me how to do some <br/>
exercise correctly. Piano teachers are a bit better about that - they <br/>
sometimes play the other hands in duets, for example. I bet the violin and <br/>
cello teachers feel like that&#39;s not part of the &quot;instruction&quot; and that <br/>
they&#39;re taking your money for instruction, not for listening to them play.<br/>

else he did.  Unfortunately he figured out that I had a hard time playing<br/>
anythying unless he played it first....and then he refused to play for me<br/>
anymore.  He thought it was wrong to learn to play by ear.  It wasn&#39;t like I<br/>
couldn&#39;t read the music but in those days playing by ear was a bad thing.<br/>

I bet they don&#39;t want to be intimidating.  If you&#39;re trying some three-note <br/>
song and they take off on some sonata you might faint, or see it as a place <br/>
you could never get.<br/>
<br/>
I like the point, though, and I think it&#39;s important for the student to know <br/>
the instructor is not just one lesson ahead of them, but really is a master <br/>
of the instrument and LIKES the instrument, doesn&#39;t just &quot;like&quot; beginning <br/>
lessons.<br/>
