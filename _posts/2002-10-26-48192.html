<div id="ygrps-yiv-261175742">Ok, I am pretty new to this, but I am wondering about what happens if your 5 year old says he is really interested in a rated R movie, or what if he said he wanted a new video game called Hitman or something like this? Or even how do you all explain some of these nasty things to young kids? <br/>
My kids pretty much do whatever they feel the need for. But, when it comes to junk food and tv/movies, I get all anxious and feel horrible about some of the stuff out there. <br/>
<br/>
One of my five year olds is really into movies right now. He looks at the paper everyday to see what is there. And he wants to know about them. I am just not comfortable explaining a violent piece of trash movie. Or, he sees a movie at the video store, and is really curious about it. Again, a really violent nasty movie. I think he is really trying to figure out the rating system. I really don&#39;t feel good about them seeing images that to me seem like to much for even an adult. I think I am alittle scared about some things because I saw scary movies years ago. I really worry about images they see, and also the ads. <br/>
I really do want them to be able to pick and choose what they want and don&#39;t want. But, I feel like the media tries their hardest to capture kids interest, but at what cost to them?<br/>
<br/>
Alot of my questions are hypothetical questions, I have been thinking about this alot lately. My kids are 5 year old boys. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632310282">Well, what I do first is ask myself if what he wants really is trash. <br/>
Sometimes if I consider things with an open mind I realize they&#39;re <br/>
not that bad after all.  Sometimes I&#39;ll figure that a movie is bad <br/>
for kids to watch alone but ok if a parent is sitting beside him <br/>
discussing it with him.  Sometimes I&#39;ll tell him that it&#39;s trash and <br/>
why (at his level).  Sometimes you need to have violence to be <br/>
realistic--like in a war movie.  I don&#39;t usually end up having a <br/>
problem with violence on movies except that my 9 year old is very <br/>
sensitive to it and gets upset by it easily.  <br/>
<br/>
There is also a website somewhere that you can order movies and tell <br/>
them which scenes to edit out. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t tell you where it <br/>
is, but if you&#39;re interested I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be able to find it.  <br/>

decisions rather than protecting them from what you think might harm them it<br/>
might help?<br/>
<br/>
So rather than thinking in terms of telling them no, it will do such and<br/>
such to you, give them the information they need to make the decision for<br/>
themselves. And then make sure they know it&#39;s okay to decide they don&#39;t want<br/>
to finish the movie at any point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, there&#39;s all sorts of different approaches. I like to discuss <br/>
with my kids why I think some things might not be what they&#39;d like to <br/>
see, or that it might be too scary, or whatever. Sometimes we find <br/>
creative ways to make it work. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, both of my kids really, really wanted to see Lord of <br/>
the Rings. We didn&#39;t take them to it in the theatre (thank God, <br/>
because it was so scary on the big screen that my DH had <br/>
nightmares!). But after it came out on DVD, we rented it and I had <br/>
the kids tell me whenever they were scared and I would fast-forward <br/>
through to the next non-scary part. By the third time they watched <br/>
it, they did view a few more parts than the first time because they <br/>
had gotten used to the story line, but there were still parts that <br/>
neither of them wanted to see. This was a good way for us to watch a <br/>
movie that was mostly really great for them, but some parts were just <br/>
too much.<br/>
