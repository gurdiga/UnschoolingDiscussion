<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545588755">&lt;&lt;-Wesley is very good at math and he likes it a lot.  My concern is that he <br/>
has learned to add in an unusual way.  Instead of adding from the right and <br/>
carrying the numbers, he adds from the left.  He gets the answers right, but <br/>
I feel compelled to show him another way.  He is learning to multiply now and <br/>
you must work from the right when you multiply or the answer doesn&#39;t come out <br/>
right.  I am open to suggestions and ideas.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d add my two cents worth--my daughter, Mary, loves math.  Like <br/>
Wesley, she added left to right--drove me crazy!!!!  When she first showed me <br/>
her &quot;method,&quot; I praised her and offered to show her &quot;another&quot; way (in my <br/>
mind, of course, the *right* way).  She informed me that she knew the *right* <br/>
way to do it, but adding left to right made more sense.  I didn&#39;t say much <br/>
b/c she ALWAYS got the right answer, even adding large columns of numbers.  <br/>
Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I recently purchased a book entitled &quot;Math Magic&quot; by Scott Flansburg <br/>
(a/k/a &quot;The Human Calculator&quot;) since she loves to mess around with numbers.  <br/>
Imagine my surprise when I started reading about how he adds left to right:  <br/>
&quot;When students first learn to add, they start with ones.  Maybe that&#39;s why in <br/>
school we learn to add larger numbers right to left--from ones to tens to <br/>
hundreds--instead of the more logical way, from left to right--from the <br/>
biggest digits to the smallest ones.  But the way you learned to calculate in <br/>
the second grade is not the only way, or even the best way, to add and <br/>
subtract.&quot;  My daughter&#39;s response?  &quot;See--I told you so.&quot;  &lt;sigh&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580054124">Thanks for sharing that story.  It gives me a lot of hope and calms what I <br/>
have discovered as my own math anxiety in action on my son.  I will continue <br/>
my faith in his ability as scary as this is.  I mean he learned to walk <br/>
without a workbook or an instructional video!  Amazing!<br/>
