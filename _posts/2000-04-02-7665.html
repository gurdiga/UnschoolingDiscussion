&lt;&lt;  Maybe I&#39;m still not confident enough in what I <br/>
 believe.  Could it be that I don&#39;t even fully believe that unschooling will <br/>
 work?  But, I do believe it!  Please help me out here.  Success stories <br/>
would <br/>
 be great, especially stories of older kids.  Thanks. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Go to Unschooling.com and check out their message boards.  Read a bunch<br/>
of different threads on different folders.  Very encouraging : )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16721997">Well Hello<br/>
ooops I have not posted here in a while<br/>
I am Susan (POD)<br/>
I have 6 kids 11,9,7,5,3,1<br/>
And the strangest thingy happened<br/>
Thingy being<br/>
The kids had to take their tests...This has been horror for me!<br/>
Well anyway I got some great great ADVICE thanks thanks<br/>
Well anyway I was looking over the vocabulary part of the test and thinking <br/>
geez my daughter (11) is NEVER going to get these words (we do not even <br/>
touch spelling etc)<br/>
But she did it and only got about two wrong...won&#39;t know absolutely for a <br/>
few weeks how she really did...BUT I was shocked and the other tests I was <br/>
like WOW<br/>
really amazed<br/>
I mean I knew that they were learning...but they were learning their way <br/>
(sometimes mine...I never could learn the true school way so I have the <br/>
basic human approach to learning...which helps alot ((and they actually <br/>
understand my way!))<br/>
<br/>
But wow I really did not think that they could put it all down into those <br/>
nice neat categories etc that the school and all those fun people wanted<br/>
BUT I am muchly relieved!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the advice<br/>
Love to all<br/>
POD...hope this helps<br/>
PS my daughter 7 could not even take her test (it was WAY too hard---but <br/>
she does not HAVE to take it, I thought it would be interesting)</div>

&lt;&lt; I gave her the usual generic <br/>
 speech I&#39;ve memorized for these occasions.  But it wasn&#39;t enough for her.  <br/>
 She had question after question, and I&#39;m sorry to say I wasn&#39;t prepared in  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Sounds to me like she&#39;s the one with the problem.  Perhaps trying to justify <br/>
her own choices/decisions/life?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, have a couple of good days in a row and then try to figure out how <br/>
they would have happened in school.  Not!<br/>
<br/>
I often contemplate whether my son (now almost 7 yo) should return to ps in <br/>
3rd grade.  They have a program in the ps near us that might (probably not) <br/>
be appropriate.  It doesn&#39;t make you a bad person to consider these things <br/>
and all of your options.  If it does, we&#39;re all going to the same warm place!<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

I can relate! People who don&#39;t homeschool sometimes seem to put pressure on <br/>
us to have genius-perfectly-behaved children! I have a 13 yob, a 71/2yob, a <br/>
5yob and a 17 month old girl. My oldest son has been home since 1st grade, <br/>
but we moved Labor Day Weekend 5 summers ago and all the talk on the new <br/>
block here was the new school year so Timothy wanted to check it out! The <br/>
principal gave him a 2 hour private tour of the gleaming charming building <br/>
and Tim was awestruck and bought the package. 2 months later he wanted out <br/>
and I had him finish out the year-very hard for me!!!!!!-so we would not be <br/>
bouncing in and out. He has been tested every year since and always scores <br/>
way up in the stratosphere and has become quite a proficient sculptor and <br/>
actor in a theater company and also babysits for a wahm 1x a week and does a <br/>
science museum internship-tours, filing, labelling, gift shop-1x a week.<br/>
He does not ever want to go back unless he does college and says the reason <br/>
is he would have no time to tend his vegetable garden, raise his egg-laying <br/>
chickens, read, and play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
