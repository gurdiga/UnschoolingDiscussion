Most mothers who work outside the<br/>
home have convinced themselves that 15 minutes of quality time is sufficient<br/>
so that they can pursue their own desires.  And I do have to include the<br/>
dads in this diatribe!  They are just as much at blame for allowing their<br/>
kids to be raised by someone else.&lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am so steamed. What a generalization! &quot;Most mothers... so they can pursue <br/>
their own desires&quot;!? Many people do choose to work or have to work (this is <br/>
impossible to judge since everyone has different standards about what is <br/>
necessary) and look long and hard for reliable and loving day care, whether <br/>
it&#39;s someone in the home or an outside provider. Such a thing is possible; I <br/>
have seen it, and I have seen well-adjusted and happy families and kids in <br/>
that situation. Not always happy, of course, but who is, and of course, if <br/>
you have a counseling practice, you are going to see the more dysfunctional <br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
If we want to go back to being hunter-gatherers, the whole family was there <br/>
all the time, ie grandma, grandpa, aunts and uncles, and yes, mom AND dad. <br/>
Think of how we are depriving our children, then, by denying them the <br/>
constant presence of an extended family numbering in the dozens. How on <br/>
earth does our emotional health stand it?<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, life is a balance. Sometimes, parents&#39; needs do take precedence <br/>
over those of the children. (I do NOT feel guilty about a night out with my <br/>
husband, except that I know the sitter will be a limp rag by the time we get <br/>
home..!) Mostly, the children do come first, especially when they&#39;re little. <br/>
But you can&#39;t make blanket judgments about other people&#39;s unique situations. <br/>
Well, you could, but you&#39;d be  wrong.<br/>
