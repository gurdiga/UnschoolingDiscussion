  **Suddenly ALL the pieces fit! It&#39;s so cool! And we haven&#39;t read in WEEKS! Busy <br/>
  with the conference, all summer in the pool, new video games, travelling here <br/>
  and there. We take this long hiatus from reading.....and he can read!<br/>
<br/>
  Had to share.<br/>
<br/>
  ~Kelly, mom of a new reader!**<br/>
<br/>
  Isn&#39;t it amazing??   Seeing the pieces being put together.   I love the fact that you guys have just been doing what you love and here comes the reading!  A true testimony that unschooling works!<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve been seeing the signs in Kyra, dd (6),  and she&#39;ll pause and say &quot;hey! I read that?!?&quot;  Her words right now are &quot;start&quot; &quot;play&quot; &quot;close&quot; &quot;exit&quot;,  all things from the computer.  Oh and of course,  &quot;Click, clack, and Moo&quot;.  In certain books she likes to say the repeated words.  Ya know like,  &quot;Sam I am, Green Eggs and Ham.&quot;  All of those.<br/>
<br/>
  Exciting times!<br/>

climbing in with me and reading over my shoulder.  Whenever she finds a word<br/>
she can read she shows it to me.  This week she&#39;s really into &#39;the&#39; words -<br/>
there, them, then, etc.  She&#39;s just taking off.  Sometimes she asks me to<br/>
show her a word I think she can read and she&#39;s been able to read most of<br/>
them on her own.  She likes to read books to me (and Joyce :0) ), using a<br/>
mixture of memorization and reading.  She&#39;s having so much fun, and we&#39;re<br/>
having great conversations about spelling and books and reading, and how our<br/>
mouths work to make noises.<br/>
<br/>
The best part, for me, is that she owns this.  ~Rue<br/>

That&#39;s how I feel about reading, and using the potty, and choosing clothes, <br/>
and their rooms (usually, though sometimes I help do a makeover or <br/>
reorganization, and for a while I&#39;m part-owner).<br/>
<br/>
When I was very new to homeschooling a mom gushed &quot;How wonderful!  You&#39;ll be <br/>
your child&#39;s only teacher!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That chilled me deeply for a couple of reasons, but one was that the mom <br/>
owned the child&#39;s everything (or hoped joyfully to do so).<br/>
<br/>
And when a child has learned something, with or without help, HE has learned <br/>
it.<br/>
But when he&#39;s been taught something and the performed, he&#39;s just a trophy of <br/>
the teacher.<br/>

 To me, it just sounds like she is proud of Rowan for what Rowan has <br/>
accomplished.  She did not say &quot; I am so proud that I taught her to read&quot; Or that she <br/>
is proud of herself for anything.   <br/>
<br/>
I feel pride for my children when they succeed in something, when they master <br/>
something, when they create something.  I do not feel proud of myself for <br/>
&quot;getting them there&quot;, but I feel proud that my kids have done something all on <br/>
thier own.   I feel proud of myself in the same regards.   Now the misplaced <br/>
pride I can understand that bugging someone.  The &quot;look at my kid - see what I <br/>
did!&quot; routine.   There are parents that take credit for everything thier kids <br/>
are.. But they rarely want to take credit for anything that thier kids are not.  <br/>

<br/>
If someone here wrote &quot;Kimberleigh!!  I&#39;m really proud of you for writing <br/>
that,&quot; wouldn&#39;t it seem at the very least condescending?<br/>
<br/>
This is what the storyreminded me of:  another story.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time five or six years ago when a really glorious batch of SCA <br/>
squires and apprentices were  hanging out with me regularly.  My husband was <br/>
working in Minnesota, and his two squires were over talking to me regularly.  Our <br/>
closest SCA friend was mostly inactive then, but had a hot squire, also <br/>
hanging out with me.<br/>
<br/>
We went out of town to a big feast in Socorro and stayed in a motel suite.  <br/>
They ranged in age from 22 to 36, and there were six of them, with me being the <br/>
only one of any SCA rank in the group.<br/>
<br/>
At the feast, our table was sparkly, intensely period, beautifully set, <br/>
happy, and then at one point it was EMPTY. Each of them was off doing something <br/>
different, something useful, and I was the only one in the group who knew they <br/>
were all out and about, and what they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
As we reviewed the evening and people went to sleep happy, I was in the room <br/>
with the last two awake.  I said I had the urge to say &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; but <br/>
it seems an awful thing to say.  We discussed my reservations about saying it, <br/>
and what alternative ways to express it could be, so because of that <br/>
discussion, and because of my thoughts concerning my kids&#39; accomplishments (because <br/>
they were 11, 8 and 6 or so in those days) I&#39;ve considered this quite a bit<br/>
<br/>
If I say to grown men &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot; it seems wrong.  It seems like <br/>
&quot;Good dog!&quot;  Or it seems like &quot;Great, thanks for making me look good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Though I had a strong emotion, &quot;proud of you&quot; has the implication of <br/>
ownership.  Either ownership of the person or of the performance.<br/>
<br/>
So although after discussion they decided they didn&#39;t mind me saying I was <br/>
proud of them, I was still uncomfortable.   One outranks me now (the youngest is <br/>
a Duke now, and a knight).  The other was then a law student but is now about <br/>
to become a special assistant prosecutor or some such, remarkably early for <br/>
an assistant district attorney.<br/>
<br/>
When one of my kids does something that causes that swelling-up feeling in <br/>
me, I try to paraphrase &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; in away that I would&#39;t  find saying <br/>
to an adult friend.  I use these things instead:<br/>
<br/>
That was pretty impressive!<br/>
I think they were lucky to have you there.<br/>
I&#39;m glad to know you.<br/>
Even if I weren&#39;t your mom I&#39;d still really like to know you.<br/>
I wish I&#39;d had friends like you when I was your age.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t it feel good when things turn out that well?<br/>
<br/>
(I note from the list that the things I&#39;ve been proud of lately have involved <br/>
social responsibility.)<br/>
<br/>
I think it makes a difference in the relationship between the parent and <br/>
child for the parent to acknowledge that the child is a separate person with his <br/>
own powers of accomplishment. Admiring someone from a little distance is a <br/>
different thing from being proud of them, and though I&#39;m not finding it easy to <br/>
describe in words, it&#39;s clear in my heart.<br/>

how I put it.  That&#39;s not what I meant.  I&#39;ll explain what I did mean, but<br/>
maybe this is just one of those things that only bugs me :0).<br/>
<br/>
Rowan&#39;s really enjoying learning to read.  I share her excitement, and I&#39;m<br/>
happy that she&#39;s happy.  If I were to tell her I was so proud of her for<br/>
learning to read, I would feel that I was taking away some of her ownership<br/>
of the accomplishment.  It&#39;s not about me.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon I talked to my four year old niece on the phone.  She wanted<br/>
to talk to me so that I could hear her snapping her fingers.  She told me<br/>
she&#39;d been working on it for daaaaays.  We talked about whether it was hard,<br/>
and how she figured it out, and why she wanted to do it, and whether it was<br/>
as fun as she thought it would be, and what her finger snapping plans were<br/>
for the evening.  She was really wound up about it and I loved to hear her<br/>
so excited.  I was glad that she wanted to share her excitement with me,<br/>
because I love  her to bits :0).  I didn&#39;t tell her I was proud.  We were<br/>
talking about her, not me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time articulating what I mean (maybe because it&#39;s 3:30 am<br/>
and I haven&#39;t slept more than a couple of hours in days!), so if this<br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense I can try again tomorrow &lt;G&gt;.  And if we just disagree,<br/>
that&#39;s ok too.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442391564">Pride is a feeling that bubbles up when one has a feeling of accomplishment.  To say you are proud of someone else&#39;s accomplishment implies that you had something to do with it.   I think this is part of the authoritarian stance most parents have taken.  We have grown to take it for granted without thinking about what it means.<br/>
 <br/>
It is one of those things that really bug me too.  A few nights ago my MIL hugged my two boys in her arms while saying &quot;I am soo proud of these boys.&quot;   She says it all the time, about everything they do.  They usually roll their eyes or run away.  <br/>
 <br/>
I agree that saying &quot;I&#39;m proud of you &quot; is taking ownership of that person&#39;s actions.  It&#39;s patronizing, as I think Sandra said.   When Gillen did well in a soccer game I said, &quot;How did it feel to play so well?  I am so impressed by how well you play.&quot;  Or I&#39;ll say, &quot;Do you feel proud of yourself?&quot; about something he does but that sounds kind of funny to me when I say it.  I guess it is my way of NOT saying that I am proud of them.  <br/>

I agree with you Teresa. I too tell my kids, husband and others that I am <br/>
proud of them. I often tell Moly, Jack, and Darin that I am proud of them for no <br/>
particular reason either. I will give a hug and tell the hug-e that I love <br/>
them and am proud of them. Yesterday I gave Moly a big hug, told her I love her <br/>
and said how happy and proud I am that she is my beautiful daughter. I don&#39;t <br/>
think I *take* pride in her, I just feel pride in her. I guess I never looked at <br/>
pride as ownership. I&#39;m just happy that my family is happy, healthy, <br/>
loving... it all makes me feel pridefull. Maybe I am equating pride with happiness? <br/>
<br/>
Definitely something to think about. <br/>

&gt; loving... it all makes me feel pridefull. Maybe I am equating pride <br/>
&gt; with happiness?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Definitely something to think about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no idea what my dad REALLY was thinking, feeling, meaning. My <br/>
grandmother did it too.  All I can say is that I was a kid who wanted <br/>
to please them and got in the habit of thinking of what would make them <br/>
proud of me. BOTH of them came to realize this as they got older and <br/>
both told me, separately, &quot;You know I&#39;ll love you no matter what you <br/>
decide and you don&#39;t have to feel like you should be perfect all the <br/>
time or do what you think I&#39;d want,&quot; stuff like that.  As much as I <br/>
loved them and they were both wonderful in many ways - that one thing <br/>
kept a bit of distance between us.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m aware of this - but I&#39;ve done some of the same stuff anyway. As <br/>
conscious as we may think we are, we STILL will look back and realize <br/>
we did things we didn&#39;t intend - it is extraordinary difficult to break <br/>
out of parenting our children in ways we were parented, when we get <br/>
down to the more subtle aspects.<br/>
<br/>
My mom was very very &quot;aware&quot; of the influence of her own attitude and <br/>
words on her kids&#39; sense of self, for want of a better expression. For <br/>
example, she didn&#39;t say things like, &quot;That is good,&quot; in response to our <br/>
artistic attempts - singing or painting or whatever, because she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to give us the underlying message that SHE was the arbiter of what <br/>
was good and what was not. She&#39;d ask questions, show lots of interest, <br/>
admire various aspects of what we&#39;d done, say that she appreciated us <br/>
sharing it, that she&#39;d enjoyed it, etc., but not tell us it was great, <br/>
wonderful, good, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents think that praise is so important. But I really don&#39;t <br/>
think it is - I think it is a double-edged sword, in fact. And if we <br/>
have a habit of saying, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot; that might, indeed, be <br/>
something worth spending some time observing and pondering - asking <br/>
ourselves whether our kids might be picking up an unintended message in <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it is important to let our spouses and kids and <br/>
other relatives know we appreciate and admire them, and I think that&#39;s <br/>
what people sometimes use, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot; to mean.<br/>
<br/>
I looked up &quot;proud&quot; and the first thing it says is:<br/>
Feeling pleasurable satisfaction over an act, possession, quality, or <br/>
relationship by which one measures one&#39;s stature or self-worth.<br/>
<br/>
So - again, might well be worth reconsidering whether we want to use <br/>
that term - we don&#39;t want our kids to think OUR self-worth depends on <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Changing terminology can also be really sweet and powerful - much more <br/>
meaningful than a common phrase. A couple of days ago, Sandra told me <br/>
to tell my 16 yo daughter &quot;Happy Birthday and I&#39;m really glad I know <br/>
you.&quot; Roxana got tears in her eyes and said, &quot;Tell her I&#39;m really glad <br/>
I know her too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(So - Sandra, consider yourself told &lt;G&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say one more thing about parents praise and especially, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m proud of you.&quot; Its such a general statement - and every kid has <br/>
feelings and even has done things that they think their parents <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be proud of, if they knew. So when a parent says, &quot;I&#39;m proud <br/>
of you,&quot; some kids (great kids whose parents would be surprised to know <br/>
they feel this way) will say to themselves, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be so proud <br/>
if you knew what I sometimes think or do.&quot; That is not the effect the <br/>
parent thinks their praise is having.<br/>

Well Sunday is my day to rest my brain but you ladies are making that very<br/>
hard to do. I let a few posts go by because I didn&#39;t want to take the time<br/>
to respond but this whole thread really has be thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say I ever remember either of my parents telling me they were proud<br/>
of me. Not saying they never did, just that I can&#39;t remember that happening.<br/>
Regarding my mom, I have always felt like nothing I ever did was enough to<br/>
please her. Not anything in school, work, relationships, family, nothing. In<br/>
fact, even now, I just get the feeling like nothing will ever be good<br/>
enough. She gives me cards on special occasions sometimes that say<br/>
otherwise, but her actions tell me I will never be the kind of daughter she<br/>
had hoped for. And deep down I&#39;m thinking I am something for her to be proud<br/>
of, she just can&#39;t bring herself to let me know.<br/>
<br/>
My dad, on the other hand, always made me feel loved and I felt like he was<br/>
extremely proud of me, even though I can&#39;t remember him saying so. He was<br/>
the only person I trusted wholeheartedly and I always knew I had his<br/>
unconditional love and acceptance. He was everything to me and even after<br/>
almost 19 years, he&#39;s missed dearly.<br/>
<br/>
So I can&#39;t remember anything in particular either parent did or didn&#39;t do,<br/>
but it must have been the small day to day conversations, hugs, looks, etc<br/>
that made such a difference in how I responded to each. Point being, I don&#39;t<br/>
think saying I&#39;m proud of you once in awhile, along with seeing how else we<br/>
parent is a wrong thing. I also think one can get that point across well<br/>
without ever using that word too.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say I use that word much, but I have used it. And I have said, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
proud of you&quot; to me kids. I&#39;ve also heard my kids when they were small walk<br/>
around and say &quot;I&#39;m so proud.&quot; In the way they used it, they were extremely<br/>
pleased with themselves about something they did. And when I have used it, I<br/>
have used it in that way also. Being very happy *for them* about something<br/>
they accomplished. The only time I can remember is when one of them have<br/>
handled a situation, like with a cranky sibling, in a manner that we had<br/>
talked about previously. So when I saw that they *got it* and used the tools<br/>
we spoke of to handle something, I did say I was proud of them for not<br/>
losing their temper or hitting and doing the best thing under the<br/>
circumstances. So when I have said I was proud, I pinpointed exactly what it<br/>
was that I was happy with. I&#39;m also hoping, and I think I succeeded in<br/>
letting them know it wasn&#39;t anything I had ownership of, but all their own<br/>
doing. And thinking of the times they have used that word themselves, I&#39;m<br/>
sure they understood how I meant it.<br/>
<br/>
I looked up proud too. It says, &quot;Feeling pleasurable satisfaction over an<br/>
attribute or act by which one&#39;s status or sense of self is measured.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the thinking today, even though I didn&#39;t really want it. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
