get away from the city lights. Two things I miss. One, living in the country <br/>
and two, Alaska!<br/>

I&#39;m so jealous. We&#39;re by DC so the light pollution is so bad we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t even see a superNova. We&#39;re thinking of driving north up <br/>
as far as Quebec this winter to try and see the lights. Any tips on <br/>

watching the show.  I&#39;m in SW Montana.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how far north you&#39;d need to be because my brother in Oregon<br/>
doesn&#39;t usually see them, even though they don&#39;t live in the city. And<br/>
sometimes my friends in Arkansas see them, but not often. But the fall is<br/>
a good time to watch for auroras and you can get tips when to look<br/>
specifically from www.SpaceWeather.com ,  but sometimes the tips come<br/>
late.  I didn&#39;t get a notice to look until this AM.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
Luckily I&#39;m usually up scouting for aliens and UFO&#39;s on clear nights, so<br/>
I spotted the auroras.&lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
There is no scientific evidence to support hearing them, BUT there have been <br/>
other people reporting that effect. So who knows?<br/>
The most fabulous display I ever saw was a very cold, dark, winter night in <br/>
Fairbanks...from our house in Scenic Heights.<br/>
Explosions of hot pink, purple, blues and greens were racing across the sky. <br/>
I was awestruck.<br/>

blue to greenish and occasionally red.  Nothing like the displays in AK. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember when we lived in Fairbanks, the lights were so spectacular! I <br/>
called my Mom today and asked if she ever thought she could hear them and she <br/>
swears there were times... Then we called Dad on three-way and asked him, and <br/>
he says that yes, he is sure there are times when you can hear them. So you <br/>
aren&#39;t alone. &lt;g&gt; I was a kid so I don&#39;t remember that sensation. But my <br/>
folks were excited because they hadn&#39;t thought of the lights in a long time. <br/>
Dad, working in the Gulf and only getting home to Mom, in Oklahoma, on the <br/>
weekends never sees them anymore. :o(  We all say that as soon as one of us <br/>
wins the lottery the first place we go after Disney is a trip to Alaska. Then <br/>
I&#39;m off to Puerto Rico and Iran, but that&#39;s another story. That, and I have <br/>
to buy a lottery ticket to win so... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Sooke? Beautiful.My grandparents lived on Gabriola and on visits <br/>
with them,my sis and I were taken all over the other <br/>
islands,including Vancouver Island.I feel more at home there than I <br/>
do in Port Moody,where I&#39;ve lived for 26 years!<br/>
Another homeschooling Lael? Wow! What are the odds of that?And here <br/>
I thought I was so original!<br/>

Now she seems to divide her time between Victoria and Mayne.  I haven&#39;t met<br/>
her yet in person.  She used to be the editor for H.E.N. or Home Education<br/>
News, a BC oriented magazine.<br/>
