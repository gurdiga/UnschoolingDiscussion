<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you know if the digests count as the same amount of space as the<br/>
&gt; individual emails?  My ds-6 with medical disabilities is often<br/>
&gt; hospitalized suddenly, and it can be days before I check my email.<br/>
&gt; My mailbox has been shut down twice because of excessive mail, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m afraid of tempting fate with a third event.  Consequently, I read<br/>
&gt; the mail at the website...it&#39;s inconvenient, but I&#39;ve been able to<br/>
&gt; keep my mailbox from self-destructing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no idea what your service provider would think of this, but can you<br/>
get a second email box for little or no money?  Then you could subscribe to<br/>
your groups there, and if it self-destructs, no loss of other more valuable<br/>
email.  <br/>
<br/>
Just an idea.<br/>
