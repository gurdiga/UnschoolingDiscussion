<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298375236">As much as I&#39;ve gotten out of this group in the short time I&#39;ve been here, I <br/>
just don&#39;t have the time for it.  It just generates way too many messages for <br/>
me to read.  I know there&#39;s a delete button I can hit, but then I end up just <br/>
deleting them all or none, because I can&#39;t really tell what will be useful <br/>
and what won&#39;t be just from the subject line.  Thanks for all the support and <br/>
advice you&#39;ve offered me in heading in the &quot;right direction&quot; twords <br/>
unschooling, I really do appreciate it! : )<br/>
Good Bye,<br/>
