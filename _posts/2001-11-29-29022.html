<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933411561">I&#39;ve read many books on learning styles (Cynthia Ulrich Tobias&#39; Every Child<br/>
Can Succeed is one that&#39;s often mentioned and it was good for background)<br/>
but the one I like best is<br/>
Discover Your Child&#39;s Learning Style : Children Learn in Unique Ways--Here&#39;s<br/>
the Key to Every Child&#39;s Learning Success, by Mariaemma Willis & Victoria<br/>
Kindle-Hodson. (You think they get paid by the length of the title?) Here&#39;s<br/>
the Amazon link, for info purposes only:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761520139/qid=1007093162/sr=2-3/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761520139/qid=1007093162/sr=2-3/ref=</a><br/>
sr_2_79_3/107-5251376-0356506 (c&p if necessary)<br/>
<br/>
What I liked was the attention paid to other areas besides the basic<br/>
visual/auditory/kinesthetic styles that are usually discussed. The<br/>
evaluations may seem a bit much, but we had fun with them and I learned why<br/>
ds and I are so often at odds with each other. It helped me respect his<br/>
needs more.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Martin Gardner is famous for his puzzles and debunking pseudoscience<br/>
and other things (one of those Renaissance people I admire so much) but<br/>
Amazon didn&#39;t have anything by him on multiple intelligences. That is the<br/>
title of a book by Thomas Armstrong, though, as someone mentioned.<br/>

&#39;Did it make sense not to live for fun? Your brain gets smart, but your head<br/>
gets dumb...&#39;<br/>
