&lt;&lt; I guess we aren&#39;t homeschooling, even though all <br/>
education decisions are made by us (really our son) and none of his <br/>
learning happens in school.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In Tia&#39;s case and some of the California stories I&#39;ve heard, it does seem <br/>
that the school district is not telling folks what to do or how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
My complaints have been with a program in Albuquerque which is school half a <br/>
day, and the other half a day you&#39;re doing homework they assigned and the <br/>
parents report it by the hour in too much detail (more detail than teachers <br/>
have to report).  Because the kids stay through lunch (and second set starts <br/>
before lunch) the schools get full funding for all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Funding isn&#39;t what offends me--I wish the schools got their tax-base money <br/>
rgardless of enrollment.  What gets me to say &quot;not unschooling&quot; is someone <br/>
else dictating the activities, subjects, schedule, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I also suspect that the days of providing money without much accountability w<br/>
ill be short-lived.  I also suspect sometimes that the days of wild <br/>
unschooling might be short-lived too, but I hope I&#39;m wrong.<br/>

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ed.gov/nclb/">http://www.ed.gov/nclb/</a><br/>
Signed into law just two weeks ago by President Bush, the No Child Left<br/>
Behind Act of 2001 (NCLGA) sanctions changes that will impact virtually<br/>
every American primary and secondary school student and educator. Posted<br/>
on<br/>
the Department of Education&#39;s official Web site, the NCLBA pages detail<br/>
the<br/>
Bush Administration&#39;s focus on renewed accountability in the nation&#39;s<br/>
public<br/>
school system. While many of the changes and guidelines have already<br/>
been<br/>
put in place in some states, this new act makes them the law of the<br/>
land.<br/>
Principally, the site reviews the four underlying principles that serve<br/>
as<br/>
spirit of the law: &quot;stronger accountability for results, increased<br/>
flexibility and local control, expanded options for parents, and an<br/>
emphasis<br/>
on teaching methods that have been proven to work.&quot; Aside from detailing<br/>
the<br/>
general provisions of the new law and its history, the site also allows<br/>
users to link to a page outlining the changes to come in their home<br/>
states,<br/>
as well as to other Department of Education sites and reports. [WH]<br/>

 Internet Resources for Children<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ericit.org/weblinks/weblinks.shtml">http://www.ericit.org/weblinks/weblinks.shtml</a><br/>
ERIC Clearinghouse on Information & Technology (ERIC/IT), hosted by the<br/>
Information Institute at Syracuse University, has released a new<br/>
publication<br/>
on Internet resources for children. This site provides links to some of<br/>
the<br/>
best educational resources available online and describes over 50 high<br/>
quality, (mostly) annotated Internet resources for children in grades<br/>
K-8.<br/>
Categories include art, current events, health, history, literature,<br/>
math,<br/>
science, and more. [MG]<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I suspect so too.  I have two friends who are public school<br/>
teachers.  I have friends here dealing with their kid&#39;s ps teachers. <br/>
I&#39;ve a neighbor who&#39;s a special ed teacher and a friend on the school<br/>
board.  What I understand is these folks think parents are not good for<br/>
children.  If they get a great, smart, happy kid in their classroom, it&#39;s<br/>
just in the nick of time, before the parents ruin it.  If they get a hard<br/>
to manage kid, what have the parents done?  They say parents aren&#39;t<br/>
involved but they mean parents aren&#39;t fit to be involved. Is it just<br/>
here?<br/>
The law says &quot;organized course of study&quot;  and &quot;provide six hours of<br/>
instruction&quot; and the superintendent asks more questions every year and<br/>
has more papers he want&#39;s me to sign.( I don&#39;t )<br/>
One day there will be the BIG question and it won&#39;t be ignored. &quot;How do<br/>
we know these parents are providing an education, and how can we make<br/>
them prove it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It bugs me. Because I have an amazing kid.  He&#39;s so amazing people say,<br/>
&quot;This is an AMAZING kid&quot;.  And I tell them every kid is amazing if you<br/>
let them be.  I tell them about how he spends his days and they can see<br/>
it&#39;s good and I hope when they look at their own kids they consider the<br/>
possibilities.  And I&#39;m afraid the more I talk about NOT doing anything<br/>
that even remotely resembles school,  the more the folks who think they<br/>
know better will take notice too.  I don&#39;t think it will be good, and I<br/>
don&#39;t know how to win. <br/>
Survival of the subversives? <br/>
In the mean time though, I&#39;ll go forth and spread the unschooling<br/>
word.&lt;g&gt; Hallelujah, praise Dodd.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401591216">Is that a newer-to-older trend or a smaller-to-larger (population) trend? <br/>
Because California is trussed up like a Christmas goose with legal hoo-ha<br/>
(if my terminology gets too technical, someone let me know &lt;g&gt;). Unschooling<br/>
here is currently easy, but only because California has a powerful private<br/>
school lobby and we unschoolers can hide under their R4 skirts. The private<br/>
school lobby doesn&#39;t mean to protect us, just (as is reasonable) themselves<br/>
by fighting against restrictions for their private schools.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably both, and California&#39;s not that new a state, as new states go.  When <br/>
Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and such places became states they weren&#39;t bound <br/>
by territorial documents, but could write new consititutions and laws, as I <br/>
understand (and I could be wrong).<br/>
<br/>
If restrictions come, we do private schools all over (local Clonlara-type <br/>
things).   <br/>

all.  They actually said at an introductory meeting that they could put the <br/>

would be ok.  During the second year, the government decided that they need <br/>
accountability, so now we have to report.  This is the 8th year, and they <br/>
haven&#39;t upped the accountability level again.  I think they know that many <br/>
would just leave if they did.  As far as unschooling goes, I think we&#39;re <br/>
all smart enough to find ways to unschool, even if the governments tried to <br/>
crack down.<br/>
