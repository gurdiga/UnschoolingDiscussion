<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i agree with this.  so much of what our culture suggests is black or <br/>
white , good or bad.  it tells us that we sit back and are affected by <br/>
things in a particular way.  the problem w/ this is that we never <br/>
really realize what a huge part we play or can play in the way things <br/>
affect us.  our individual perspective is the key factor in every <br/>
experience we have.  if you are doing something which you feel is <br/>
detrimental imo you owe it to yourself to challenge yourself W/O <br/>
placing blame on you OR that which you are doing, being that smoking <br/>
or anything else. <br/>
<br/>
deepak chopra talks about addictions, one of the things he suggests is <br/>
that you should not deny yourself but allow yourself to smoke and as <br/>
the desire wells up and you have a cigarette ask yourself why you are <br/>
smoking - become intimate w/ it and stop shaming yourself for it.   <br/>
but maintain the desire to quit while you are consciously smoking and <br/>
questioning yourself.  this is a radical shift from the more puritan <br/>
perspective of &#39;no pain no gain&#39; mentality but maybe you will find <br/>
more success by being kind, gentle and accepting while maintain a <br/>
concious, guilt-free desire to quit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246791148">Michelle, where do you buy organic tobacco? Do you roll your own cigs? Can <br/>
you make them with filters, or does it look like you are smoking pot all the <br/>
time?! I smoke, too, and I am not ready to quit, but I do resent the <br/>
additives that Big Tobacco has been putting in to make me addicted to their <br/>
product. More info, please?<br/>

&gt;My husband and I both smoke, and have since we were very young......I think <br/>
&gt;the health part has alot to do with the way you look at it, I believe what <br/>
&gt;you believe affects how you are affected by things.  We have been taught <br/>
&gt;that tobacco(plain tobacco)  is sacred, and carries  prayers to the <br/>
&gt;creator.  We do not smoke mainstream brand cigerettes, only 100% <br/>
&gt;tobacco.....we think that the chemicals that are added to the tobacco, are <br/>
&gt;what are most addicting & harmful.  And we choose not to give money to the <br/>
&gt;cigerette compnaies that put chemicals in their tobacco.  But I&#39;ve thought <br/>
&gt;alot on this topic, and I tend to think also that there are many other <br/>
&gt;factors contributing to lunge cancer, which are purposefully not being <br/>
&gt;looked at close enough.  The pollution that cars & trucks make in our <br/>
&gt;cities everyday, must have an effect on the lungs, and no-one is about to <br/>
&gt;say quit driving..they aren&#39;t even going to suggest that this may CAUSE <br/>
&gt;lung cancer.  How about the pollutants of many businesses.and products.you <br/>
&gt;see the the clouds of chemical smoke going into the air, but are we <br/>
&gt;stopping it?? People use paints, and cleaning supplies that have harmful <br/>
&gt;chemicals to the lungs, everyday. The war on tobacco companies is all about <br/>
&gt;money...the facts, and tests are propaganda for one side or the other in my <br/>
&gt;opinion...if.you inflict any extreme ammount of any constituant on any <br/>
&gt;thing for a duration of time, and it will become toxic...High levels , and <br/>
&gt;extremes are toxic of any one thing..vitamins, Minerals nutrients, Our <br/>
&gt;bodies are made as such we need a variety of different things at different <br/>
&gt;stages and times(in my opinion)  Everything in Moderation.... It is not the <br/>
&gt;tobacco itself that is the culprit of lung cancer, in my opinion. I am not <br/>
&gt;saying that high levels of nicotine on an already weak lung will not affect <br/>
&gt;it, surely it will. I think if one leads an overall healthy life, that this <br/>
&gt;is very important & this demonstrates respect for oneself, and the <br/>
&gt;environment, but when it comes down to it, when the time comes , the time <br/>
&gt;comes, whether you&#39;ve been a smoker or not.  I do not think, personally <br/>
&gt;that any death is before it&#39;s time, whatever the cause, and I&#39;am not <br/>
&gt;dismmissing the pain caused by losing  a loved one.... , and mean deeply <br/>
&gt;not to offend anyone who has lost a family member whose autopsy stated lung <br/>
&gt;cancer as the cause, Many Blessings to you, and may they be in <br/>
&gt;peace.....but I think the best thing to suggest if you want to quit smoking <br/>
&gt;is to either just STOP...or at least switch to an all organic tobacco, with <br/>
&gt;no chemicals or additives, at least you will be more likely to quit when <br/>
&gt;you are ready, and won&#39;t be contributing hard earned dollars to a company <br/>
&gt;you do not believe or trust in.  Just my 2 cents.......Totally NOT <br/>
&gt;intending to make anyone mad, or insult anyone else&#39;s beliefs on this one.  <br/>
&gt;I also believe we all have a right to our place in the mind, meaning, I <br/>
&gt;respect others to have the beliefs they have, and to be at the stage in <br/>
&gt;life they are in.  Everything is in it&#39;s place, and everything is in <br/>
&gt;transition.  But lastly, I do believe all plants, including tobacco to be <br/>
&gt;Sacred, a gift from the Earth MOther..and Tobacco particularly to be a <br/>
&gt;Sacred plant , whose smoke carries our prayers to the Spirit world......I <br/>
&gt;do not support BIg Tobacco COmpanies, or any other Large Corporate Entity.  <br/>
&gt;Many Blessings in fullfilling that which you want for yourself.  Michelle*<br/>
