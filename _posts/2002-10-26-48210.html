<br/>
&gt; Ok, I am pretty new to this, but I am wondering about what happens if your<br/>
&gt; 5 year old says he is really interested in a rated R movie, or what if he<br/>
&gt; said he wanted a new video game called Hitman or something like this? Or<br/>
&gt; even how do you all explain some of these nasty things to young kids?<br/>
&gt; My kids pretty much do whatever they feel the need for. But, when it comes<br/>
&gt; to junk food and tv/movies, I get all anxious and feel horrible about some<br/>
&gt; of the stuff out there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would tell them -- they made this movie (or video game) for some adults<br/>
who really LIKE to be scared for fun, and it says here on the rating that<br/>
it&#39;s really scary and gross. Do you remember when (fill in blank) scared you<br/>
in that movie? This one looks even worse. I&#39;ll bet we can find one over<br/>
there that you might like. Oh, look! The new Pokemon is out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It works here (most of the time) because my daughters trust that I&#39;m telling<br/>
them the truth and that&#39;s how I really do think.<br/>
<br/>
If they really, really insist (try to be matter of fact in explaining it and<br/>
not alarming, as it might become a personal challenge to them to see if they<br/>
can Survive the Bad Movie Mom is Afraid Of &lt;g&gt;) you also might need to find<br/>
an adult (dad? uncle? cousin Jane the horror movie buff? :) who is willing<br/>
and able to sit down and watch something they REALLY want to watch with<br/>
them, ready to stop the tape or turn off the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Junk food I fear not. Cheetos for breakfast have yet to give them (or me)<br/>
nightmares.<br/>

Well I know that Joseph especially will see something like a movie ad and <br/>
comment about if it&#39;s good or not for him to see. We know, by experience, <br/>
what bothers him and what doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m not terribly worried about the <br/>
violence he sees because what he enjoys is not &quot;real, scary people&#39; killing, <br/>
like Jason movies but fantastic stuff like giant bugs and worms. He&#39;s okay <br/>
with that and understands that giant things like that don&#39;t exist. He&#39;s also <br/>
okay with robot things like Terminator. Sexual scenes he gets uncomfortable <br/>
with and so we make sure not to have any in the movies he sees. The language <br/>
he really doesn&#39;t seem to get as far as bad words. He knows that he <br/>
shouldn&#39;t say them, he doesn&#39;t hear us say them and to be honest, pretty <br/>
much ignores them when he hears them. We know what he can handle because we <br/>
have sat with him and have seen his reactions. Now of course if I say that I <br/>
think it&#39;s a movie he wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with, he just says okay. He <br/>
knows the difference and knows I understand too. Of course as he gets older, <br/>
things will change.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to know what your child can handle and what he can&#39;t. <br/>
The only way to do that is by sitting with him and discussing and watching <br/>
him to see his reaction. I would think that anything to strong for him he <br/>
woulnd&#39;t want to watch anymore and so you rented a movie for nothing. I <br/>
can&#39;t imagine a 5 year old being interested in things way too graphic for <br/>
them. Anyone else had this happen? A kid seeming too young watching adult <br/>
things?<br/>
<br/>
As far as food, we don&#39;t worry about it at all. I have always said I choose <br/>
my battles very wisely. Harsh word battle but I think you know what I mean. <br/>
Like not sweating the small stuff, and it&#39;s mostly all small stuff!!<br/>

So you did actually let him watch something with a sexual scene in to learn that it will make him uncomfortable??<br/>
<br/>
As far as bad language goes - how do they know it&#39;s bad if they don&#39;t hear it?? My son has not really been exposed to constant bad language. The worst he know is butt head.<br/>
<br/>
As far as violence goes - he doesn&#39;t like watching things that might scare him. Until not very many months ago he couldn&#39;t watch Tarzan without getting scared. Last night he watched Home Alone III and LOVED it and then wanted to watch the movie after that. But when he heard it might be a little scary he changed his mind.<br/>
<br/>
I find it easy to let him choose where he has had the experiences, but more difficult when he hasn&#39;t yet, like sex and bad language. And I just can&#39;t see myself letting my five year old watch a movie with sex scenes, just to see how he will react.<br/>

<br/>
Well yes. But it&#39;s not like we rented a porn for him!! Joe and I were <br/>
waching with Joseph and Sierra. I can&#39;t really remember what movie it was <br/>
but it was a scary bug or monster thing. Had a sex scene thrown in I guess <br/>
for adults. Not real graphic. I man and a women in bed rolling around, naked <br/>
but only seeing boobs, slightly. We didn&#39;t know it was in the movie and <br/>
Sierra didn&#39;t say anything but Joseph voiced that he didn&#39;t like it and it <br/>
made him obviously uncomfortable. It was over before we could stop it and <br/>
that was that. But I know that he doesn&#39;t like to watch it so we check <br/>
movies he wants to see.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As far as bad language goes - how do they know it&#39;s bad if they don&#39;t hear <br/>
it?? My son has not really been exposed to constant bad language. The worst <br/>
he know is butt head.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well there have been a few occasions out in public where the kids would hear <br/>
someone say something and ask what it meant. Yes we hear the word f*ck at <br/>
the grocery store! And the same for some of the movies they want to see. <br/>
Even the scary bug movies have it in. I guess just to get an R rating so <br/>
more people will go and see it. Now they really don&#39;t comment on it and I <br/>
don&#39;t see that it will be a problem for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I find it easy to let him choose where he has had the experiences, but <br/>
more difficult when he hasn&#39;t yet, like sex and bad language. And I just <br/>

just to see how he will react.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I can understand what you are saying. Again, it wasn&#39;t like we set out <br/>
to experiment and see what they could handle. It really was an innocent <br/>
accident but taught us all something. Sierra who is a year younger didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to think it was a big deal. Plenty of time her dad and I are hugging on <br/>
the couch laying down and these people just happened to look naked while <br/>
doing it. No big deal for her. Joseph just didn&#39;t like to look at it. He <br/>
also turns his head if he walks into my room and I&#39;m wearing a bra. This is <br/>
a kid who saw my boobs out all over the county when I was bf. I just try and <br/>
be honest with him and tell him it&#39;s okay when he walks in. In his own time, <br/>
he&#39;ll ask more or be okay with it. I&#39;m certainly not going to go on a rant <br/>
that nudity and sex are perfectly natural if he&#39;s not wanting to hear it <br/>
right now. Although again it&#39;s been mildly said. Am I being confusing??? I <br/>
made that mistake with my first. Listened to an expert that she was ready to <br/>
hear it and she wasn&#39;t at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think what&#39;s most important is to watch and know your children and not <br/>
push yourself to do something that you aren&#39;t comfortable with yet. Baby <br/>
steps works for us adults too.<br/>

Thanks, Mary. Your post helped me to clarify my thoughts. When I trust that<br/>
my child will learn to read and write and all the other things when he needs<br/>
to do that and is ready for it, he will also do that with sex and other<br/>
issues. He is not asking about it at the moment, so he obviously doesn&#39;t<br/>
have a need to know.<br/>

child, scenes that my daughter wouldn&#39;t like didn&#39;t make an impression. I<br/>
recalled Ghostbusters as being amusingly scary because I watched it<br/>
originally with adult eyes but, now seeing it through child eyes, it was<br/>
pretty scary. <br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, if they&#39;re asking about post 1998 (I think) movies, check<br/>
with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com">http://www.screenit.com</a> They give brief but detailed descriptions of<br/>
scenes that might bother a child or parent in oodles of different<br/>
categories. You can read or paraphrase the descriptions to them of the types<br/>
of things that bother them to help them make a more informed decision.<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve had that experience too. Scenes that we thought would be okay, he has found to be too scary and asked us to turn the TV off. I thought he might find Home Alone scary - the whole idea of the little boy being chased by bad people. Especially since we&#39;re still detoxing from living in a country with a very high crime rate and him being worried about baddies, but he loved it. Loved how the little boy tricked the bad people. He said he thinks that boy might even be smarter than him. Ahh... they&#39;re so innocent at that age.<br/>
