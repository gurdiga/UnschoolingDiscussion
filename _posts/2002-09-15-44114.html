I felt your energy all the way from here - where ever you are :) My son<br/>
disliked public school from day one. I knew he had dyslexia and the<br/>
school waited until 5th grade to do something about it even though I am<br/>
a fierce advocate for my son. By then they wanted him tested up the<br/>
wazoo to &quot;prove it.&quot; He was so damaged by frustration and trauma from<br/>
public school humiliation, etc. and being molested there that - in my<br/>
opinion - the stress triggered something like the label bipolar. He is<br/>
90% calmer in the summer when he is not in school. This has been shown<br/>
to be true numerous times. I did not have the support of my  husband to<br/>
homeschool and felt completely overwhelmed. I began showing signs of<br/>
post-traumatic stress disorder because of the torture I was being put<br/>
through advocating for my son and what the school did and said to us.<br/>
Last year it was the same. The school said &quot;we have no money, no space,<br/>
no time, no tutors, etc.&quot; This was when he was on an IEP. The school<br/>
&quot;found&quot; a surplus of 1.5 million dollars after school was out for the<br/>
summer. The special ed teacher told me - because she thought my son was<br/>
going to a therapeutic school and not the public school she works at -<br/>
that she was told to &quot;watch her budget&quot; all year. Hence the kids who<br/>
need the most help go without. So now I am teaching my kids at home. I<br/>
was prepared to go to jail if I had to if they said I couldn&#39;t teach my<br/>
son with &quot;dis-abilities&quot; at home. Thankfully &quot;they&quot; gave me<br/>
&quot;permission.&quot; I am angry, hurt, wounded, etc. over all of this. They are<br/>
MY kids not the school&#39;s. Now that we are &quot;out&quot; we can begin the healing<br/>
process:) Michele<br/>
