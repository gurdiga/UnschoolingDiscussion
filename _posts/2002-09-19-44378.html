&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t like having to medicate my child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then don&#39;t. There is no way that DSS can take your child from you based only <br/>
on the gfact that you refuse to medicate him. Did you check with a lawyer? <br/>
Did you check the laws?<br/>
Sounds like you got bullied or there is more to the story than you&#39;ve shared <br/>
here.<br/>
I can refuse immunizations, I can refuse school, but you&#39;re telling me you <br/>
must medicate a child you don&#39;t want to?<br/>
At worst case, you get the prescription and throw it away. No one can force <br/>
you to put a substance in your child that you don&#39;t agree with.<br/>
I would move before that ever happened....I think you should check into a <br/>
lawyer.<br/>
