<div id="ygrps-yiv-455193035">Today we were walking to the library when we saw a cat<br/>
on a porch yowling pitifully to get inside. But no<br/>
humans were home there. I thought of you all and the<br/>
outside/inside cat discussion,and I realized...oh! I<br/>
said my cats stay in but I neglected to mention that I<br/>
live on Lake Superior, where we still have several<br/>
feet of snow on the ground and more to come. It snows<br/>
predictably from October through mid-May, and I&#39;ve<br/>
seen it snow at least once every month of the year. My<br/>
cats don&#39;t WANT to go outside. A couple times they&#39;ve<br/>
gone out the door, stopped, made WHOA! YUCKY! signals<br/>
with their ears and tails, and scrambled back inside.<br/>
They do enjoy exploring the garage and basement, and<br/>
we make sure not to keep any chemicals they could get<br/>
into out there.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, New Mexico, cats would love going outdoors<br/>
there. Dry, warm. Juli<br/>

It&#39;s the same for 9 months out of the year here as well, not the snow but the <br/>
rain.  The cat often runs out on the porch and either runs right back in or <br/>
meows waiting for us to pick her up.<br/>
