<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696615198">&lt;&lt;but what do you mean by &quot;if we water....&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means trusting children to make choices, to learn.  It means<br/>
realizing that children are quite capable of making intelligent choices<br/>
about their lives and being quite prepared to accept that their choices<br/>
might not be the ones we prefer.<br/>
<br/>
When people start talking about we unschool, but Jr. can&#39;t make intelligent<br/>
choices about television time, they have moved out of the realm of<br/>
unschooling.  When people start talking about, I am quite prepared to<br/>
reinstate limits on things if the kids don&#39;t handle it the way I want them<br/>
to, they have moved out of unschooling.  It is crucial to know where that<br/>
line is and when we cross it (either on the way in to unschooling or on the<br/>
way out). To claim these situations described above as within unschooling,<br/>
waters it down and makes the term useless.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Come on, Julie. That was an old thread which, if I recall, Cindy just ask us not to re-surface again. But to respond to it since you did, you are referring to Bridget and her son. She has stated that he has a medical condition which warrants a strict outline of his day. She has never said she is unschooling him... she&#39;s indicated that to the list repeatedly.  It *was* pointed out to Bridget (by me) that posting her experiences with Wyndham leads one to believe she&#39;s citing unschooling examples and that is incorrect imo.  She has since posted less about her experiences with him and when she does, she makes it *very* clear that he is an exception to the norm and he is *not* unschooled!<br/>
Give it a rest, please.<br/>
