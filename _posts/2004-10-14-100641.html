<div id="ygrps-yiv-293194207">My dd Lilly, age 8, loves to write stories and has had me create a story<br/>
list on yahoo where she can share her stories with other children and read<br/>
stories written by other children.  I have created a private moderated list<br/>
and I&#39;d like to invite any children who are interested to join.  The list is<br/>
open to all ages so please keep that in mind when you submit stories and<br/>
keep them clean.  The stories will come to me first and then as moderator, I<br/>
will send them on to the list.  This will help to keep it safe for our<br/>
children.  If I feel something is unsuitable for the list, I may ask the<br/>
author revise it and send it back again.  If you have children who are<br/>
interested in joining and sharing their stories and reading other children&#39;s<br/>
stories, then please drop me a note and I&#39;ll send them an invitation to join<br/>
the list.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
