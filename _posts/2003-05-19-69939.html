<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m confused by this. The people that commented on this gave a resounding<br/>
&gt;yes answer. My first thought at reading it was definitely no.<br/>
&gt;What &quot;job&quot; are speaking of? Being a mom or being a mom to unschooled kids?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being a mom to unschooled kids.  Being a mom is not a choice anymore.  I am a mom, what kind of mom is still a choice.  Sometimes, though, I wonder about options to unschooling because I feel like I loose my patience a lot and wonder if a different environment would be better for Davan to spend some of her time in.  Most of the time, I think not.  I am working on my patience and Davan wants to be with me, not with someone else, faults and all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well either way, the wording of &quot;feel like I don&#39;t have enough patience&quot;<br/>
&gt;makes me feel like someone just wanted to call it a day and not go on<br/>
&gt;anymore. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s exactly what I wanted that day.  In fact, her dad did the interaction for most of the rest of the day (luckly it was Sunday and he was not at work).  I&#39;m not proud of it.  That&#39;s why I asked if other people had patience problems and are still unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(with the job) I have never felt like that. I haven&#39;t felt like I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t have &quot;enough&quot; patience. What I do feel at times is that I want and<br/>
&gt;need to be better at what I do. No, actually I always feel like I want to do<br/>
&gt;better. But I have never questioned why I do this or feel like I bit off<br/>
&gt;more than I can chew.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is great you never feel that way.  I really wish I never did, either.  I do sometimes &quot;feel like I bit off more than I can chew&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I am a parent.  I came into it willingly.  I love my daughter.  I think unschooling is the best way of life.  We are unschoolers.  However, my question reflected my doubts about if it&#39;s still best if the parent most involved has trouble keeping his/her patience.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like I should clarify at this point that I never physically harm Davan and, while there are angry outbursts, I am able to keep them to &quot;I am angry about what is happening&quot; type comments and never &quot;you stupid little girl&quot; type comments.<br/>

You didn&#39;t need to clarify, for me anyway.  I never once suspected you were <br/>
harming your daughter.  :)<br/>

Thank you Nicholina, that was the clarification I was looking for. So it&#39;s<br/>
the unschooling part that makes you wonder sometimes. I think maybe the<br/>
circumstances as to how you came about to unschool can make the difference<br/>
depending on the person. I know some people who have taken their children<br/>
out of school when the kids themselves weren&#39;t having a &quot;terrible&quot; time, it<br/>
was the parents who didn&#39;t like what they saw. They have expressed at one<br/>
time or another if it was really the right thing for the child. Some parents<br/>
I know who have never had children in school also express that doubt.<br/>
<br/>
I have one child who has always gone to school. When she was having problems<br/>
and not liking it, I wasn&#39;t able to pull her out and homeschool her. By the<br/>
time I was able to take her out freely, she had learned how to manage the<br/>
system and was actually doing better than she ever had. In 8 more days, she<br/>
will be a senior and have only one year left. I think I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>
it more than her!<br/>
<br/>
My other 3 have never been to school. Maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t have the<br/>
doubts that unschooling is the right thing for them. (yet, I&#39;m aware that<br/>
might come as they get older) Because I have had it both ways and see this<br/>
choice as the best, knowing what my other choices really are. If this is all<br/>
fairly new to you, I can understand why &quot;if I&#39;m doing the best thing&quot; comes<br/>
up. And I would also imagine that even people not new to it, having their<br/>
children grow and become different can also bring about the questions. I<br/>
just haven&#39;t had them.....yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yeah, that&#39;s exactly what I wanted that day.  In fact, her dad did the<br/>
interaction for most of the rest of the day (luckly it was Sunday and he was<br/>
not at work).  I&#39;m not proud of it.  That&#39;s why I asked if other people had<br/>
patience problems and are still unschoolers.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I remember being frustrated when Tara was a baby. She was my first and I<br/>
tried for a long time to have her. (to me) She was a very difficult baby.<br/>
She seemed like she hated being a baby. I had NO experience with babies at<br/>
all. My then husband was absolutely NO help even though he had another<br/>
child. Parenting was MY job. My mom was around but I had just lost my dad<br/>
the year before and well, she was having emotions of her own. Tara<br/>
frustrated me. I was younger then and very  inexperienced. I felt alone and<br/>
sometimes I would make sure Tara was with someone and just go and cry<br/>
somewhere. I felt like I wasn&#39;t doing a good enough job and failing her. I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to hang it up though, it just made me more determined. After<br/>
all, I didn&#39;t have much time to feel sorry, I had a screaming baby waiting<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
When Joseph came I was in my late 30&#39;s. New husband and new maturity. I<br/>
forgot all the books and well meaning family members and let my motherly<br/>
instincts take over. I haven&#39;t had that frustrating time like I did with<br/>
Tara since. I&#39;m not at all saying anyone with doubts isn&#39;t mature or<br/>
experienced. Just that this was my experience and how it became so different<br/>
for me because of my circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is great you never feel that way.  I really wish I never did, either.<br/>
I do sometimes &quot;feel like I bit off more than I can chew&quot;.<br/>
I am a parent.  I came into it willingly.  I love my daughter.  I think<br/>

I feel like I should clarify at this point that I never physically harm<br/>
Davan and, while there are angry outbursts, I am able to keep them to &quot;I am<br/>
angry about what is happening&quot; type comments and never &quot;you stupid little<br/>
girl&quot; type comments.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to feel that way and recognizing that it happens every once in<br/>
awhile is a great start as far as I&#39;m concerned. Not seeing that you lose<br/>
patience would be a real problem. You&#39;ll find the way because you want to.<br/>
You just have to have patience that it will come!! I have no doubts just<br/>
from your few posts that you do love your children and do them no harm. I<br/>
never got that impression at all. When we know better, we do better. And<br/>
wanting to always be better as a mom is important, at least for me. Just<br/>
because I never felt like hanging it up doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t realized that<br/>
many times the way I have handled something hasn&#39;t been the best way for my<br/>
kids. After 4 it still happens more than I would like, but hey, I&#39;m only<br/>
human. I will never expect to be perfect but I do want to be able to see the<br/>
best way.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I question if I can do it. For me it&#39;s more finding solutions <br/>
to our issues.<br/>
I have a 3.5 yr. old who screams when she and her 11 yr. old brother are <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
They are at each other constantly but do not want to go it alone when it <br/>
comes to certain things.  If one goes on the trampoline the other does also <br/>
and it usually ends with one (the littlest) coming off screaming or yelling.  <br/>
Sometimes they can sit and watch TV together and others neither one can keep <br/>
their hands off the other.  Usually this is provoked by the 11 yr. old <br/>
taping/touching the 3 yr. old.<br/>
<br/>
When the 3 yr. old screams esp when the baby is sleeping it goes right <br/>
through me.    <br/>
This follows a quick &quot;Stop!  p.l..e.a..s..e&quot;!  I will usually have the little <br/>
one come with me and watch what she was watching in whatever room I am in.  <br/>
This is not working for us or at least I do not see things getting better.  <br/>
The solution is close I just haven&#39;t tripped over it yet.<br/>

impatient mommy moments as you wre forced to get them to do their <br/>
