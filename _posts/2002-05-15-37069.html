<br/>
We got into unschooling accidentally and before we even knew there was <br/>
a name for it.  So I can&#39;t say I went in to it with this goal in mind.<br/>
<br/>
But the most important thing for me has been helping them find out who <br/>
they are.  When I was in school, I was the kid that got picked on all <br/>
the time.  Funny thing is I loved school, I just couldn&#39;t stand most <br/>
of the other kids.  So what I wanted for my girls from the very <br/>
beginning was for them not to have to face what I did in school.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling has helped them develop their own true <br/>
personalities from the beginning.  I didn&#39;t know who I was until I got <br/>
to college.  My own personality was hidden by many things <br/>
including a fear of rejection, a need to fit in, the belief that I was <br/>
too weird to let it out, etc.  My girls on the other hand, have loads <br/>
of self-confidence and self-awareness.  If I had to point to one <br/>
benefit of unschooling, that would be the one I would pick most <br/>
definitely. <br/>
<br/>
Socialization aside - -  from a learning standpoint unschooling has <br/>
worked for us.  My girls know lots of stuff abouthistory and science <br/>
that I learned sometime in school but forgot right after the test.  <br/>
They won&#39;t forget because they learned by seeing it in context or <br/>
because they wanted to or because it was in something else they were <br/>
working on and it related.  I think that our schools are so set on <br/>
everyone learning a set core of stuff that they have forgotten that <br/>
once we reach adulthood, we each need different things.  Unschooling <br/>
allows the mechanics among us to focus on cars and the astronomers to <br/>
focus on the stars.  <br/>

in.  In other words, the basics like cooking, laundry, hygiene, <br/>
house-cleaning.  I want him to be able to support himself (and hopefully a <br/>
family) doing work he loves.  And I want him to have at least some <br/>
understanding of how relationships work, friends, mate, kids, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He seems pretty well on his way with the first, as I&#39;ve gradually &quot;allowed&quot; <br/>
him to take on his laundry, some of his cooking, etc.  He knows how to look <br/>
after himself when he gets sick, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He knows several jobs in the silviculture field already . . . and knows he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do that for  a living.  &lt;g&gt;  I just keep my eyes open for <br/>
any kind of job he might like doing, looking for apprenticeship <br/>
opportunities or whatever.  I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll find at least one thing <br/>
he really likes that pays decently.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we&#39;ve modelled relationships reasonably well for him, though it&#39;s <br/>
hard to help a shy, non-talker with that.  (And I wish I had done a better <br/>
job of labelling emotions for him when he was little.  My daughter is <br/>
really good at doing that with her kids.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funny that this topic has come up as I was just talking to my Mom about this the other day. Since we have been homeschooling I had told her my goal was to get both of my children away from public school. Now that we are unschooling my goals are different. (And I have never told her that I stopped using a curriculum.) <br/>
I want my kids to be able to learn anything they want. I want them to be able to know how and where to look things up and figure them out.I want my kids to be happy, healthy, productive people. I am hoping that they will be compelled to become Christians like their Dad and I. Most of all, I feel as though I am giving them a gift with unschooling. It is the gift of freedom, the freedom to be children and to play to their hearts content. <br/>
That is a great question.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908249328">Well put.  I too loved school and couldn&#39;t stand other kids.  I felt a lot<br/>
of other kids were very cruel to each other.  The people, students and<br/>
teachers, always seemed to find this situation normal. It was believed that<br/>
verbal abuses make you strong and  better prepare you  for &quot;real life&quot;.<br/>
Later on I taught elementary grades briefly. I saw a difference in attitude<br/>
between the just started kindergarten children and the 3rd grader.  I left<br/>
teaching shortly before starting a family. Over the years,  I had time to<br/>
reflect on the controversy of such frame of mind. I didn&#39;t want my children<br/>
to be exposed to PS socialisation, especially not before they can reason the<br/>
difference between just and unjust behaviours.<br/>
The other problem I had with Ps was the way knowledge was delivered. I went<br/>
to school with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. I felt thirsty, most of<br/>
the time, until I finally left schooling as we know it.  I wanted my sons to<br/>
have access to any leaning opportunity the minute they wanted such access.<br/>
Learning from home using the whole world made more sense to me.  When we<br/>
started home schooling, I didn&#39;t want to use the schooling methods in our<br/>
home, only some of  the school resource centre. Later on I read about<br/>
unschooling and realised it fits more what we&#39;ve been doing all these years<br/>
than homeschooling .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186460613">Through unschooling, I hope that my children will have the freedom to realize who they really are. I want them to think for themselves and be comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions without fear of ridicule or judgement.  Whatever they decide to do with their lives, I hope they will make enough money to support themselves and/or their families, but mostly I hope they never know what it feels like to dread getting up every morning.<br/>
   When I finished high school, I couldn&#39;t get away from that place fast enough. I was so relieved that my &quot;learning days&quot; were behind me so that I could be free to live my life. I still feel like so much time was wasted and at almost 30 years old, I still don&#39;t feel like I know who I really am! If my children don&#39;t see their childhood as a waste and if they don&#39;t see any difference in learning and living, then I will feel like our unschooling endeavor was a success.<br/>
   As I was thinking about how to answer this question, I was able to see how far away from the schoolish mentality I&#39;ve already gotten in this short period of time. Thanks!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The other day my 3.5 yr old asked me if he could go to school. I told him<br/>
that he was lucky in that he won&#39;t be going to school, but will get to stay<br/>
home, be with friends, play and learn anything HE wants to learn, not be<br/>
forced to learn something that a teacher wants him to learn. So I guess<br/>
FREEDOM is the goal. Freedom of choice to learn what they want to, freedom<br/>
to study, play, grow and self-educate in any way that works for them.<br/>
Freedom to be whomever they are meant to be without the constant negative<br/>
feedback from peers or adults who may or may not like them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481134813">I was the picked on kid in school too.  That, and my dh&#39;s not too fond <br/>
memories of school are a major reason we began homeschooling and then <br/>
changed to unschooling.  Another was school size, the school has 5 <br/>
kindergarten classes alone.  Once, we were there (my dd&#39;s Scout troop met <br/>
there) and I asked a teacher for help finding the room.  She had to use a <br/>
MAP to find the room!!  Luckily, our neighbors homeschooled otherwise, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have thought it was legal where you have access to public schools.<br/>

&gt; &gt;But the most important thing for me has been helping them find out who<br/>
&gt; &gt;they are.  When I was in school, I was the kid that got picked on all<br/>
&gt; &gt;the time.  Funny thing is I loved school, I just couldn&#39;t stand most<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the other kids.  So what I wanted for my girls from the very<br/>
&gt; &gt;beginning was for them not to have to face what I did in school.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think unschooling has helped them develop their own true<br/>
&gt; &gt;personalities from the beginning.  I didn&#39;t know who I was until I got<br/>
&gt; &gt;to college.  My own personality was hidden by many things<br/>
&gt; &gt;including a fear of rejection, a need to fit in, the belief that I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;too weird to let it out, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wow Bridget.  Do you *ever* sound like me.  I was also the picked on kid,<br/>
&gt;and my fear of rejection is something I&#39;m *still* working on.<br/>

 What do you hope your kids will have gotten from unschooling by the time<br/>
 they&#39;re ready to move on from home? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My main goal was that their sense of self would be so strongly intact that <br/>
the world could not rob their joy, their uniqueness and their natural <br/>
curiosity. Beyond that......<br/>
That the status quo will not matter so much to them as what is good and <br/>
right.  That they would have a deep seated knowledge in their hearts that <br/>
they are intelligent, capable human beings and can learn anything they wish.<br/>
A sense of wonder so awesome that they will never quit seeing how magical the <br/>
world truly is.  Be idealistic tempered with realistic.<br/>
Spirituality that flows naturally and freely from a loving heart and kindness <br/>
rare.<br/>
The ability to follow their dreams and goals, whatever those may be.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And how do you plan to help that along?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It humbles me to think about this. I came out of HS battered emotionally, not <br/>
knowing who I was or what I really wanted. And 15 years later, I am spouting <br/>
of ideals for my children that I couldn&#39;t have dreamed of at the time. <br/>
I will help that along by becoming a better person myself.<br/>
By reading, watching, searching and regaining that sense of wonder (they&#39;ve <br/>
helped me do this already). By delving deep into questions and not pretending <br/>
like I know more than them. By being willing to set everything aside, change <br/>
plans midstream and go off in a new direction when necessary. By listening <br/>
carefully and responding appropriately.<br/>
By respecting these amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the inner <br/>
knowledge they already posess.<br/>
By dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love to the <br/>
earth and my fellow human beings.<br/>
By filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, toys, art <br/>
materials and whatever oddities my children bring home.<br/>
By taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never knew <br/>
existed. By fixing them new and exciting foods from other countries and <br/>
making trips to the grocery store an adventure.<br/>
By making every day an adventure, by my attitude, every mundane chore or <br/>
daily activity sacred by how I approach it.<br/>
Healing myself has definitely been the most important step in assisting these <br/>
worthy individuals in their unschooling journey. I have learned much from <br/>
them, thank the heavens they came here to teach me.<br/>
