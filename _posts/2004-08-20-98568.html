<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>20 Aug 2004, at  2:18pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154763512">I know that next year&#39;s conference is in October in Fla.<br/>
<br/>
Are there dates picked yet?  I want to look ahead on my work schedule and make sure I&#39;m off.  I know its a long way in advance, but the sooner I know the better, so I can find someone to switch.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Kristen<br/>
