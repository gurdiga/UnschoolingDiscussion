<br/>
Any Renaissance recorder music?   A Byrd vocal or keyboard thing?<br/>
Morley madrigals, maybe?  (But the other stuff is more soothing.)<br/>
<br/>
There are CDs of music from Shakespeare plays, or music FOR (period stuff).  <br/>
I have one that&#39;s really boring---all done on guitar. But in its monotony <br/>
it&#39;s kinda charming and would be good for falling asleep to. or maybe even <br/>
listening to as an audience comes in.  Let me know if you need it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Slightly past the period, but maybe easier to come across:<br/>
Telemann or Handel sonatas for recorder/viol da gamba/harpsichord?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Recorder music might be playable on violin or viola, especially if you have<br/>
kids who can play by note name.  I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s much easily<br/>
availalbe renaissance music for viola.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just ask your string players to bring in some music.  Even the suzuki<br/>
books have music that might be appropriate.  I imagine it&#39;s probably more<br/>
important to you, and more enjoyable to the audience, just to take advantage<br/>
of their willingness to play, than to have the music be exactly &quot;period&quot;.<br/>
