<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693075307">Hi Brooke and Joshua.<br/>
We&#39;re here in B.C. too -- in the farm and bush land north of Prince<br/>
George. Perhaps that B.C. stereotype (California north / pioneer<br/>
country) has a ring of truth to it?<br/>
There are many homeschoolers here, not all one big group, though.  There<br/>
are more unschoolers each year, it seems.  I have given my daughter that<br/>
choice from the beginning, and we are happy with it.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t yet done this, you might take a look at the homeschool-ca<br/>
mailing list. I think Debbie (Buzz) is on both these lists too.  (Hi<br/>
Debbie, again.)  There is a lot of information and deep support on the<br/>
ca list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi there Tina, <br/>
yes ...I was on that ca. list for a year but I found there were too many<br/>
posts coming through and that the vein of discussion was often a waste of<br/>
time for me (and off topic...but that was my opinion and not very welcome<br/>
so I never expressed it..others who did got their wrists slapped). I think<br/>
that there are loads of people who are very informed and some wise<br/>
home-schoolers on that list though. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, I have such a strong support group here in the Kootenays.  I<br/>
only wanted specific info and support regarding our choice of unschooling<br/>
and have found that on this list. I really enjoy perusing the flora.com hs<br/>
site once a month or so by their digests.  And yes...I have found the<br/>
occasional piece of valuable info.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in touch, <br/>
Brooke<br/>
