But  maybe the <br/>
Christian homeschooling groups just avoid the tour so the mom in  charge can <br/>
explain that dinosaur bones were created by God to test the  faith of his <br/>
people. <br/>
Would they believe their eyes and their theories over  the word of God?   <br/>
Correct answer:  &quot;no&quot;   If the  Bible says one thing and overwhelming <br/>
physical <br/>
evidence says another, go  with the Bible.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
A few of us unschooling families recently went to Virginia, just the moms  <br/>
and children.  Had a great time playing and talking.  So  wonderful.  Anyway, <br/>
one day we went to The Luray Caverns and the guide was  talking about the <br/>
different types of structures we were looking at.  He  happened to casually mention <br/>
that one formation had fallen so many thousands of  years ago.  Teri happened <br/>
to ask (not sure what possesed her...LOL) &quot;do you  get many people that <br/>
disagree with you on that point&quot;.  Of course she  thought that he was of scientific <br/>
mind.  Turns out he was only a paid  employee.  He started telling us the <br/>
&quot;truth&quot;.  That just as Adam was  created as a grown man, so was the world.  That <br/>
God had created all the  earth as it is complete with dinosaur bones, <br/>
stalactites and stalagmites.   The Earth didn&#39;t have to go through these changes the <br/>
Earth was created complete  and &quot;old&quot;.  That was the &quot;truth&quot;.  <br/>

Well then!<br/>
No sense wasting potential Bible-time on any geology.<br/>
One more thing checked off the list, for homeschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
When I first read that, I shuddered and went to the bathroom and thought <br/>
harsh thoughts for a moment or two.  The &quot;well then&quot; was after my brief recovery.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  According to some surveys I&#39;ve seen as many as half of all Americans don&#39;t believe the theory of evolution. They hold faith based ideas of creation instead. It&#39;s down around 25 or 30 percent here in Canada I think. Scary.<br/>
