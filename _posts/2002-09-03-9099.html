And, what kept hitting me in the face when I spent time at the school was how<br/>
very different our goals were. I believed that respect for the individual<br/>
would lead to the best possible outcome, it became increasingly clear to me<br/>
that the schools goals hardly considered any one &quot;individual&quot; human at all.<br/>
Their goals seemed to be making the most amount of widgets they could out of<br/>
what they considered pretty substandard base materials. If a few  widgets got<br/>
lost or damaged on the way down the assembly line, well, that&#39;s the breaks. <br/>
