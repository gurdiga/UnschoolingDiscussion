<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393045114">I read that it&#39;s very common for 4yo to lie without<br/>
meaning to be dishonest. At that age they don&#39;t<br/>
separate what&#39;s true from what they WANT to be true<br/>
very well. So a 4yo who lies about eating the cookies<br/>
may wish she hadn&#39;t eaten them or even just that she<br/>
hadn&#39;t been caught.<br/>
<br/>
Reading these posts makes me feel relieved to live in<br/>
my little town where my kids are safe playing in the<br/>
neighborhood. My 10yo has a paper route, and he knows<br/>
enough people on the route that if he gets too cold,<br/>
he has a place to warm up, if older kids throw<br/>
snowballs at him, he has places to visit until they go<br/>
away. He&#39;s made great friends with a 94 yo man. Yes, I<br/>
could get paranoid about the 94 yo man, but then I<br/>
would be depriving ds of a wonderful friendship. I<br/>
also let the kids (ds is 8) go without to the library<br/>
2 blocks away. Not alone but with each other. Home<br/>
alone for up to 1/2 an hour is ok for the 10yo. <br/>
<br/>
I know people who think *I&#39;m* over protective and have<br/>
left their kids alone after school since age 8 or 6,<br/>
and who let their 5yo ride bikes around the<br/>
neighborhood. That seems negligent to me, how about<br/>
all of you? Juli<br/>

I agree with you completely, Juli, at least in my suburb of Detroit! <br/>
Plus, my 12-year-old daughter doesn&#39;t actually LIKE to stay home <br/>
alone, or with her younger sister, for more than an hour at a time ... <br/>
and then, certainly NOT at night. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I STILL don&#39;t let my almost 9-year-old daughter off of our <br/>
block, even if she is with another child. Too protective? Maybe. But I <br/>
feel she is not aware of things going on around her enough to let her <br/>
trail off on her own just yet. I DO let my 12-year-old ride her bike <br/>
to friend&#39;s houses a few blocks away and take short bike rides (around <br/>
the block) by herself, but she knows to keep her eyes open and is more <br/>
aware of her surroundings. <br/>

Well, &quot;I&quot; couldn&#39;t handle that kind of stuff but I know, by watching<br/>
other kids in the neighborhood, that some very young children are free to<br/>
roam at will.  The little girl across the street is only 5, is gone for<br/>
hours at a time and her mother is often seen &quot;looking&quot; for her at dusk. <br/>
It&#39;s bone chilling to me., this neighborhood isn&#39;t THAT safe.<br/>

I knew that Mum needed to know where I was when it was <br/>
getting dark, so I had to get back around home when the <br/>
street-lights came on.  Shame we didn&#39;t just carry on <br/>
in this vein with school (or not, as I would have <br/>
preferred)  The more I think about it, the more I find <br/>
my mum was really good at finding common ground about a <br/>
lot of stuff.  Now if I could hold on to that and get <br/>
rid of the emotional bullying I went through as a <br/>
child, I think I&#39;d be doing great!<br/>
