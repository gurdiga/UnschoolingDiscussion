<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174539480">Oh gosh, I remember this so well.  I&#39;d have a baby in the backpack (he<br/>
was usually throwing up down my shirt) and the other would be pulling<br/>
huge chunks of books off the shelf.  Thankfully we have such wonderful<br/>
librarians, they understood.  They had a talk with one about only taking<br/>
one book.  It didn&#39;t help.  :)<br/>
But, they would also sit down with them and read as time permitted.  We<br/>
still are very close to them.  They know us by name and temperament.<br/>
Hee...Hee....<br/>
<br/>
We are all bookworms, and that&#39;s what they want, so I guess they just<br/>
have to live with it.  :)<br/>
