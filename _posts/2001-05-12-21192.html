<div id="ygrps-yiv-535400354">Would anyone like to share their most special Mother&#39;s Day with the group?<br/>
<br/>
Here is mine:<br/>
We were on vacation driving up the California coast a few years back and we stopped at a beach, I think it was called &#39;Agate Beach&#39; near Trinidad.  While DH and I were relaxing on the warm rocks on the beach, our 2 daughters were searching through the rocks picking out the best ones.  Then they went through the baggage searching for a receptacle to put their rock treasures in.  Then that evening after dinner, they presented their Mother&#39;s Day gift to me!  The most beautiful rocks they could find that were polished  and rounded by the waves!  That was my most special Mother&#39;s Day gift!  And I still have them and take them out and look at the precious gems from time to time!<br/>
