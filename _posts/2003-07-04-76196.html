<div id="ygrps-yiv-257852943">&lt;&lt;That sounds like the stuff Keith was reporting that the other engineers<br/>
were<br/>
saying about their own teens, while Keith&#39;s stories were positive and so<br/>
either ignored or made light of (like someone saying, &quot;Yeah, we all had<br/>
summer jobs<br/>
too&quot; when Keith mentioned Kirby&#39;s job, which is NOT &quot;a summer job&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, what is up with that?  When I use Lanora as an example in<br/>
conversations on the virtues of unschooling they say, &quot;But Lanora is<br/>
exceptional, she&#39;s just a really great kid!&quot;, like it happened in a vacuum.<br/>
<br/>
When people talk about how they don&#39;t trust their kids I say how much I<br/>
trust Lanora.  They say, &quot;Yeah, but she&#39;s so honest and trustworthy&quot;.  I<br/>
tell them it&#39;s because she is trusted but they don&#39;t hear me.<br/>

Tons of people (I think even in places like this) have written off my advice <br/>
by just deciding quickly that MY children must be exceptional, while theirs <br/>
are lazy, unimaginative, disobedient kids who would watch tv all day if they <br/>
would let them, or play video games all day if they didn&#39;t stop them, or eat <br/>
sugar all the time and never sleep if they&#39;d let them.<br/>
<br/>
And they go away happy with their well thought out choice of keeping their <br/>
kids in school or in homeSCHOOL.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they&#39;re just one step from change.<br/>
Sometimes if they would turn 30 degrees and look just a LITTLE to one side <br/>
they would see more.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I get that too, and it makes me feel sad. Rain *is* a great kid, but it<br/>
is so much a chicken and egg thing... or maybe all kids start out with<br/>
the potential to be responsible, kind, trustworthy, fun to be with kids,<br/>
but when they&#39;re treated as otherwise it starts to stick. And school just<br/>
a way of telling a kid they can&#39;t be trusted to learn...<br/>
<br/>
Rain and I are both in a musical right now, and I&#39;ve been given a husband<br/>
and two kids for when I&#39;m in the emsemble (none of whom are really<br/>
related to me, but my show-husband is single and so am I and... wait,<br/>
that&#39;s another thread ;-). It&#39;s been interesting for me to notice how I<br/>
&quot;parent&quot; these kids onstage, and how quickly we&#39;ve gotten into a nice<br/>
groove. One of my &quot;daughters&quot; was having trouble &quot;cheating out&quot;, so half<br/>
the audience was seeing her back The director reminded her about it (in<br/>
sort of a shaming way) but it didn&#39;t change much. Her real mother told<br/>
her about it a few times, too, that I heard. I noticed last weekend that<br/>
during the two parts of the show where that had been an issue, I&#39;d<br/>
started putting my arm around her and sort of hugging her to me and<br/>
smiling down at her, which results in her being perfectly placed. At<br/>
another point, she was supposed to end up with her &quot;family&quot; during a<br/>
scary scene, and she was ending up way across the stage - so I started<br/>
making sure I swooped her up with me as I moved to my &quot;husband&quot; and we<br/>
fearfully go to him together. <br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t how the other people treat the kids, or even how most of the<br/>
kids generally treat each other. Most are kind, but the emphasis is on<br/>
&quot;You need to cheat out.&quot; rather than, &quot;How can we arrange things so<br/>
cheating out happens naturally?&quot;. And the kids this, they want to look<br/>
good out there, and have the show look good. <br/>
<br/>
It just seems that so many things get turned into a power struggle rather<br/>
than being solutions-oriented. I do think that&#39;s a big thing Rain has<br/>
gotten out of being unschooled - she focuses on getting things to work<br/>
for everyone, rather than getting people to do things.<br/>
<br/>
And I love the name Lanora, just BTW...<br/>

<br/>
YES!!<br/>
Dar, this (whatever it is &lt;g&gt;) seems to me to be central to people living by <br/>
principle instead of by rules.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes parents can&#39;t think past &quot;what do the kids have to do and what will <br/>
I do if they don&#39;t do it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they look three steps past that to &quot;What do I want the outcome of all of <br/>
this to be?&quot; they can work back from that to &quot;What should I say at this moment <br/>
that could conceivably, potentially lead to that outcome?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Chess is NOT my game.  I don&#39;t like it, I have no patience for it, and <br/>
because it&#39;s a spatial reasoning situation, I can&#39;t think three or four moves ahead. <br/>
 In the SCA, people are SUPPOSED to play chess.  It&#39;s kind of an early badge <br/>
requirement (less so now than when I joined).  Once when people were subtly <br/>
(NOT) encouraging me to play chess, I said &quot;I don&#39;t like chess, I can&#39;t play <br/>
chess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean I couldn&#39;t pass a test on how pieces moved and what the rules <br/>
were; I could have.  What I meant was I can&#39;t play well enough to do anything <br/>
but lose and feel like I&#39;m wasting my time and my opponent&#39;s time as well.<br/>
<br/>
A friend who is a great chess player and knew me well said &quot;What do you MEAN <br/>
you can&#39;t play chess?  I see you think three or four moves ahead when it <br/>
involves people and politics all the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Sure, and if you can tell me which of these pawns wants what, which <br/>
used to be married to which other ones, and which one WANTS to move, I&#39;ll tell <br/>
you which pawn to move first!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He got the point. &lt;g&gt;   I need human factors and motivations.  He was looking <br/>
at it from a mathematical and spatial intelligence, and I don&#39;t have so much <br/>
of that to spare on a game.  I need to save it all for parallel parking and <br/>
putting things in the freezer!<br/>
<br/>
Is is possible that some parents are lacking in the human factors <br/>
intelligences (interpersonal and intrapersonal) and so they just can&#39;t think three moves <br/>
ahead?  Is unschooling going to be difficult for people without those <br/>
intelligences?<br/>
<br/>
(Though Dar&#39;s example wasn&#39;t necessarily a human-factors, and could have been <br/>
more primarily spatial...)<br/>

I was trying to explain to Tara&#39;s father about how we parent here. Trying to<br/>
get him to understand yelling at her, bringing up mistakes she made years<br/>
ago, talking forever about what &quot;could happen&quot; and other such bs things<br/>
aren&#39;t helping her at all. I tried to get him to get it (ain&#39;t happenin!) by<br/>
talking about Joseph and Sierra. What great kids they are to be around. He<br/>
knows that. I thought it would help him see. I ended it with they aren&#39;t<br/>
punished here and look at them. I was told I don&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to punish them<br/>
because they are great kids, not that they are great &quot;because&quot; I don&#39;t<br/>
punish them.<br/>
<br/>
I gave up.<br/>

<br/>
You are so right. And I have seen it here too. It&#39;s not what you do or don&#39;t<br/>
do. You just have naturally delightful, considerate kids who would have<br/>
turned out that way no matter how you parented. It&#39;s nice to see when some<br/>
people do turn that slight degree left or right and see it.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend over here the other day. She enjoys seeing how my kids are<br/>
and especially how Tara and I are with each other. I was telling her about<br/>
when we did the Oprah thing and about what went on here at the house. We<br/>
were asked to sit and look at a picture album. (after us saying we do that a<br/>
lot) I sat at the dining room table and the producer asked Tara would she<br/>
would sit naturally to look with me. Tara answered it would be on my lap. He<br/>
looked surprised until I said that was true. So that&#39;s how they shot it.<br/>
When I told my friend that, she said if she had seen that piece on TV<br/>
without knowing us, she would have assumed it was all set up. But she knows<br/>
us and knows how we are.<br/>
<br/>
Some people just don&#39;t want to see what they aren&#39;t ready for. Or maybe some<br/>
people just don&#39;t want to be ready.<br/>

<br/>
I think there&#39;s also the factor that it&#39;s natural to ascribe adult motives<br/>
to children. Parents will see a child act in a selfish way -- like grab a<br/>
toy from another child -- and assume the child is being selfish and label<br/>
and treat them as selfish and worse.<br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s really a matter of understanding what the world looks like from<br/>
what the child understands and what they&#39;re capable of understanding.<br/>
