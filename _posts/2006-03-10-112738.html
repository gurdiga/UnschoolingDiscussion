<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677833810">I would like some advice about something that is happening every so often in<br/>
our home. My son seems to be reneging on commitments pretty often. I will<br/>
ask him if he would like to do something or talk to him about an opportunity<br/>
has come up. Sometimes he will say yes he does want to do it and at the last<br/>
minute he changes his mind. I have a hard time with this because people are<br/>
counting on us/him to be there and I have made arrangements or changed mine<br/>
and others schedules to do it. We have discussed it and he says that<br/>
sometimes when it comes time to do it he just doesn&#39;t feel like it. An<br/>
example-Last week he was asked to be in a chess tournament at the local<br/>
elementary school where he went to school for 2 years. He said yes and was<br/>
excited about it. I reminded him about it at least 4 times this week and he<br/>
even played chess with him Grandma to prepare for the tournament. We talked<br/>
about it this morning and he said he wanted to go. I made other arrangements<br/>
for the PS kids I watch after school and my husband took his motorcycle<br/>
instead of my car to work so that we could have the car. I prepared snacks<br/>
and such for my dd to have during the tournament and rescheduled our<br/>
appointment with our realtor. Then as I was getting ready to go he said he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to go. He said he just changed his mind and wants to play with<br/>
his friends instead. A year ago I would have yelled at him to get in the car<br/>
and given him a lecture on honoring commitments. Now I know that there must<br/>
be a better way. <br/>
<br/>
Any advice?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
<br/>

If he&#39;s in a play or on a sports team, people are counting on him in  <br/>
a way that&#39;s not as true in most other circumstances.  Don&#39;t pressure  <br/>
him more than is really necessary.<br/>
<br/>
The schedule rearrangement comes kind of in in the category of buying  <br/>
a dozen donuts.  It&#39;s easy to THINK you&#39;re hungry enough to eat three  <br/>
donuts, but if you buy a dozen for four people and each person eats  <br/>
one and the rest are getting stale, it&#39;s not better to pressure  <br/>
people to eat them than it is to just throw them out after a while.<br/>
<br/>
If you traded cars and he doesn&#39;t want to go, the cars will be no  <br/>
less traded if he goes.  Making him feel really guilty won&#39;t help much.<br/>
<br/>
But that said, I do have a practical suggestion.  Don&#39;t make it all  <br/>
or nothing.  Say maybe &quot;Let&#39;s just drive over there  and see if you  <br/>
feel differently,&quot; or see if he&#39;s hungry or doesn&#39;t like his shoes or  <br/>
something plain and practical.  Maybe he doesn&#39;t want to miss a  <br/>
program; can you record it?  Maybe he doesn&#39;t want to go out in the  <br/>
cold.  Maybe if he does get in the car and get there, maybe he&#39;ll  <br/>
want to go in.  Maybe it&#39;s the being at rest that he doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could say &quot;Let&#39;s go and watch a while, and then if you want  <br/>
to come home we can.&quot;  If he gets all the way in and sees the other  <br/>
kids, he might want to stay, or he might not.<br/>
<br/>
The final decision doesn&#39;t need to be made before you leave or even  <br/>
after you get there.  Every moment can be another &quot;pass or play&quot; point.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of looking at it as a &quot;commitment,&quot; think of it as a series  <br/>
of choices.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I mis-spoke. I do not try make him feel guilty at all. It does bother<br/>
me but I have only discussed with him why he doesn&#39;t want to go. Sometimes<br/>
it is not a big deal to decide not to go, but in some cases it is. When his<br/>
Hockey league traveled to Houston a few weeks ago the whole family went and<br/>
my husband took off work. We get there and everything was fine then when it<br/>
is time to get dressed to go to the game he said he doesn&#39;t want to go. He<br/>
wanted to sleep in. <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I really try to make sure that the kids get to do all the<br/>
activities they would like to do. We almost never let cost be an issue<br/>
(Hockey is well over $1000 a year without counting travel). We do the best<br/>
we can to accommodate their interests but it&#39;s getting to the point where I<br/>
just don&#39;t want to mention opportunities for activities because I don&#39;t know<br/>
how he&#39;ll feel when the time comes to follow through. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to force him to do something he doesn&#39;t want to do but I feel<br/>
like I&#39;m at the mercy of his whims. I wouldn&#39;t want to feel that way with<br/>
anyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979961098">I can&#39;t count the times we have changed our minds about going to some<br/>
event we planned on.  Sometimes there was an emergency that prevented<br/>
us but often we didn&#39;t like something about the event or the timing or<br/>
the people or our lives were fully or overly committed.  We bailed out<br/>
at the last minute even though we were originally very enthused.  We<br/>
called these events &quot;commitments&quot; but I think they were just simple<br/>
ordinary choices.  To use the word commitment is to invest certain<br/>
events with a loaded at times heavy sense of duty.  Duty is probably<br/>
not the reason we get excited about going somewhere or doing<br/>
something.  But we promised, our word has to count for something, and<br/>
a number of other objections serve as references to ways that we&#39;re<br/>
used to thinking about commitments.<br/>
<br/>
We could feel the same about words like job, work, chores as we could<br/>
about commitment.<br/>
<br/>
If you and yours are not yet there and can&#39;t label the events in your<br/>
lives &quot;choices&quot; (my family isn&#39;t there yet but we&#39;re closer than we<br/>
used to be!) it may be because of the pressure you put on yourselves<br/>
which then transfers to your child, and anybody else you may meet  ...<br/>
Heck, the grocery clerk may get a little stress from seeing you that<br/>
day.  Being dutiful is an excellent thing and it&#39;s good to be a<br/>
reliable person.  But it isn&#39;t good to be pressured by it.  That goes<br/>
for anybody, adult or child.<br/>
<br/>
Now.  What if the pressure just wasn&#39;t there?  <br/>
<br/>
For that to happen, the people who might be expected to feel pressure<br/>
about car arrangements, lack of money, time, or similar limits, etc.<br/>
would have decided to let go of pressure rather than holding onto it<br/>
and passing it around.  The key is to emphasize, talk about and go<br/>
toward what is wanted.  A sweeter thing to pass around.<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to lighten myself from a sense of duty (otherwise<br/>
known as guilt).  I have been trying to lighten my dh who brings<br/>
pressure home with him from work.  Let go.  Focus on people rather<br/>
than the events intended to benefit them.  Let go of the aspects that<br/>
seem inherent in these things and seem to come from every direction. <br/>
Focus on the precious gifts each person is, refuse to accept pressure,<br/>
avoid passing it around.  <br/>
<br/>
An example.  My little 2 1/2 year old ds wanted to use the spray<br/>
bottle yesterday.  I wasted precious together time being annoyed at<br/>
not having the spray cleaner when I needed it.  After about 15 fuming<br/>
minutes getting pressurized over the fact that not much was done and<br/>
stern with my little boy, I finally realized -- hey, ds just wants to<br/>
figure the spray bottle out.  So I spent some time showing him some<br/>
things about how to use the thing.  Those are things.  Ds is a person<br/>
and that&#39;s what should matter.  He then appointed himself the task<br/>
of spraying the floor wherever I needed it and some places I didn&#39;t...<br/>
;)  A lot went on in that hour or so which we would have missed had I<br/>
not listened to what ds wanted, had I insisted on getting the job out<br/>
of the way.  Realistically speaking, I can clean the floor at other<br/>
times and putting the job off wouldn&#39;t matter even if I were having<br/>
company over.  <br/>
<br/>
I posted this as much to benefit others if it can as I did to clarify<br/>
in my own mind things I&#39;ve been trying to change about the way I think<br/>
and act especially toward my nearest and dearest.  I could re-title<br/>
this post &quot;Commitments or How to Stop Yelling&quot;.<br/>

Well, he&#39;s backing out often enough now that we won&#39;t do it next year. The<br/>
money is not the real issue but it is something we have to think about. We<br/>
are not a rich family. No, I don&#39;t really feel as if the money is wasted if<br/>
he is having a good time doing it and I want him to have the opportunity. I<br/>
think my dh takes it kind of hard because he has to do weeks of side jobs<br/>
before the season starts for us to be able to afford it. My dh never<br/>
complains about the extra work but I can see that it hurts him when our ds<br/>
has those days where he backs out at the last minute. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think &quot;a sense of duty&quot; needs always to be synonymous with  <br/>
guilt.  Sometimes it is, and then it moves from simple duty to  <br/>
burden, and that&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Kathe wrote a great post, and I&#39;m sure she knows duty isn&#39;t always  <br/>
guilt.<br/>
A duty someone else lays on you is way worse than a self-chosen  <br/>
obligation.  If you obligate yourself to do something, you made a  <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
People can opt out of doing their duty, but then it affects them in  <br/>
the integrity, in the &quot;points&quot; they earn to spend with other people,  <br/>
or in the trust others will have in them.  That&#39;s the way I&#39;ve  <br/>
explained it to my kids.  If they want to be trustworthy they need to  <br/>
be very careful about what they attempt or agree to.  Overcommitting  <br/>
isn&#39;t good.  Overextending isn&#39;t good.<br/>
<br/>
Before Keith and I had kids we had people depending on us for all  <br/>
kinds of things.  Our hobby involved committing lots of time and  <br/>
energy and responsibiity.  When we had kids, we moved toward making  <br/>
the kids the top priority, so we would only commit to things when  <br/>
others knew the kids came first.  Few outside projects got as high a  <br/>
priority as we used to give them, but we tried to clarify that.<br/>
<br/>
If Keith volunteers me to do something, that&#39;s not as cool as if I  <br/>
volunteer myself.  My obligation ends up being to Keith in those  <br/>
cases, not to the third party he made a promise too.  And he has  <br/>
spent some of his points with me if he commits me to do something I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t in on.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent commits a child to a project without really checking with  <br/>
the child, without helping the child make a fully informed decision,  <br/>
the parent is failing in a duty to the child, and the trust that is  <br/>
lost will be on the part of the parent to some extent, in the eyes of  <br/>
the child.<br/>

he doesn&#39;t want to stop what he&#39;s doing at that second, particularly if it<br/>
involves playing with friends. My 7.5yo is the same way. Sometimes, too,<br/>
there&#39;s a bit of a buildup for an event and they&#39;re getting cold feet as the<br/>
event approaches.<br/>

I find, too, that when the kids start talking consistently about not wanting<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865818825">One thing I try to do with my kids is to talk about how much money something<br/>
costs by comparing it to something else we could buy.  For instance, if we<br/>
were thinking about joining the gym/pool for the month and they seemed<br/>
interested, but not overly excited, I might say, just to get them thinking<br/>
about the value of it, &quot;the money we would spend to join the pool for the<br/>
month is equivalent to 6 riding lessons. Please think about whether or not<br/>
you really want to join, because that&#39;s a lot of money for us and I don&#39;t<br/>
want to feel like I wasted it if you decide you&#39;d rather not go after we<br/>
join.&quot;  I just try to put things in perspective as to how much money it is<br/>
and when I compare it to something else it makes it easier to see.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you talked about the value of $1000 and how many hours your dh has to<br/>
work to earn that much money?  Did he know what kind of a commitment hockey<br/>
was when he joined or was this his first year?  <br/>
<br/>
I am not one to make my kids stick with something if they didn&#39;t know what<br/>
they were getting into, but if they played hockey last year and knew what<br/>
kind of a commitment it was before they joined and they knew how much it<br/>
costs, I wouldn&#39;t feel to badly about pressuring them to keep the commitment<br/>
they made.  That said, I also try really hard to help my kids realize the<br/>
commitment they are signing up for when they do sign up for something.  That<br/>
means we often go watch for several weeks and make sure that it is something<br/>
they are willing to stick with.  <br/>
<br/>
So far, it hasn&#39;t been a problem and they&#39;ve stuck with the things they&#39;ve<br/>
committed to.  But money is an issue for us and I try to really make sure<br/>
they understand what they are getting in to if they want to do something<br/>
that costs a lot or if they make a commitment where people will be counting<br/>
