&gt; &gt; This is an SOS.  I am new to northern VA, and am in desperate need <br/>

&gt; &gt; contact with another unschooler.  I am a stayhome dad, and my wife,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Charlotte, and I have been trying to implement the unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; philosophy, however imperfectly, for about a year, but having just <br/>
&gt; moved<br/>
&gt; &gt; we&#39;ve only made contact with homeschoolers, who seem a little more<br/>
&gt; &gt; control oriented, to say the least (I myself am far too <br/>
&gt; controlling, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; am trying to mend that, and being around controlling parents doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; help). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope you find others!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, so I&#39;m close, but not close <br/>
&gt; enough for playgroups and such. :-(<br/>
&gt; I can very much relate to being a person trying to figure out this <br/>
&gt; parenting thing while also letting go of my control issues.<br/>
&gt; I got to meet 2 other unschooling moms last week, who came down for a <br/>
&gt; few days vacation together with their kids and I spent the day on the <br/>
&gt; beach with them.   There were 12 kids between us, and I invited 2 <br/>
&gt; other hsing friends I have, so we had 17 kids in all!(Hi Jane if <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re reading this!)  Anyway.... I was reminded that day how I am <br/>
&gt; missing out on having friends that have the same/similiar <br/>
&gt; philosophies that I have.  I don&#39;t know ANYONE IRL who treat children <br/>
&gt; with real respect.  While I have my beliefs and convictions, I find <br/>
&gt; it hard to hold true to them all of the time because I have noone in <br/>
&gt; real life to be a model for me.  All I have is what I&#39;m trying to <br/>
&gt; fight against, for perspective.  It&#39;s very frustrating.<br/>
&gt; Good luck to you!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, good luck! Remember, there are options for finding other unschoolers in <br/>
your area. Post a notice at the local library, grocery store, local free <br/>
bulletin board... <br/>
<br/>
I want to play devils advocate for a minute here about the issue raised in <br/>
the previous posts about control. Only because my best friend, who thinks my <br/>
homeschooling is past Douglas Adams weird, believes my kids are heading for <br/>
certain doom if I don&#39;t squelch even some of their natural exuberance {what I <br/>
call it. hyperactive what she calls it} And *make* them behave! Now she knows <br/>
my kids know how to act in a restaurant, the library or wherever. But this <br/>
issue comes up most often when she is over with her kids, we are trying to <br/>
talk and the all kids are running around having a ball. (After the <br/>
prerequisite three or four screams, she begins the conversation with a sigh <br/>
and &quot;I just don&#39;t understand how you deal with THIS all day!&quot; As if THIS is <br/>
par for the course and how a normal day of learning/living is in our home!) <br/>
We have THIS discussion on a fairly regular basis. &lt;beg&gt; <br/>
<br/>
First as unschoolers, is unschooling just a way we facilitate our children&#39;s <br/>
learning, Or does unschooling extend beyond natural learning and into our <br/>
parenting? Does it have to? Can you (general) be successful in unschooling <br/>
and still have control in your parenting? Is having *controll* a bad thing? <br/>
How can you raise children without some control, if you give up all control, <br/>
won&#39;t you just raise wild *out-of-controll* children who don&#39;t listen or do <br/>
as they are told? We all hear the advice that if you treat children as <br/>
adults, then they will be good, model citizens you will never be ashamed to <br/>
take out in public. But does that really work? It just sounds too easy. Or, <br/>
as my best friend is fond of telling me, &quot;Nancy, if you don&#39;t exert some <br/>
parental authority on them, they will never respect you when they are older!&quot; <br/>
So, does inviting the unschooling philosophy into your life mean <br/>
relinquishing all parental *controll*?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is having *controll* a bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a lot easier for the controller than the controlled.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can you raise children without some control<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you&#39;re equating control with guidance? Giving up control doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean giving up talking and guiding and modeling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if you give up all control,<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t you just raise wild *out-of-controll* children who don&#39;t listen or do<br/>
&gt; as they are told?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is doing what you&#39;re told to do a good thing? It makes it convenient for<br/>
parents but is learning to do as an authority tells you without question a<br/>
good thing? *Is* that a goal you want for your children as adults? Or is it<br/>
a goal you have for your children while they&#39;re living at home that you want<br/>
them to turn off as soon as they&#39;re on their own?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t a lot of us feel trapped by the idea of wanting experts to tell us<br/>
what to do for schooling, medical care, parenting? Is that a good thing?<br/>
<br/>
Or is a better goal learning to understand situations, think through<br/>
consequences and act accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We all hear the advice that if you treat children as<br/>
&gt; adults, then they will be good, model citizens you will never be ashamed to<br/>
&gt; take out in public.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, kids will be kids. If everyone accepted that some kids are very<br/>
exuberant and if every parent recognized their responsibility for guidance<br/>
and respected their children&#39;s capacities for social situations then yes,<br/>
they&#39;d be model children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But does that really work? It just sounds too easy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. *But* making allowances for kids who are not the sit still kind. An<br/>
adult restaurant, church service, shopping, places they may wander off,<br/>
social situations that last longer than 10 minutes and so on may be years<br/>
away for some kids just because that&#39;s their personality.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Nancy, if you don&#39;t exert some<br/>
&gt; parental authority on them, they will never respect you when they are older!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*People* won&#39;t respect others who don&#39;t respect themselves. Do you respect<br/>
adults who exert authority over you?<br/>
<br/>
I think if adults let the kids walk all over them (as in not standing up for<br/>
yourself as a fellow human being with needs and feelings of your own) then<br/>
the kids (and other humans) won&#39;t have much respect.<br/>

Thanks for making contact.  I relate 100 percent.  We know more about<br/>
what not to do that what to do.  Not really what you&#39;d want, is it? <br/>
Anyway, too bad you&#39;re so far away, but we&#39;ll see you around on<br/>
unschooling-dotcom.  <br/>
