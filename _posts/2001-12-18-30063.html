I just had to respond to this!  It&#39;s very interesting to see how people debate.  The thing I find very amusing (in general, not to belittle the poster) is that I use this EXACT argument as proof we&#39;re grazers!  It goes like this:  carnivores can only move their jaws up and down.  Try it with your cat or dog.  Grazers such as horses, deer, etc.  can move their jaws side to side and have flat molars and such to grind up food.  Carnivors simply swallow without chewing.<br/>
<br/>
The other cool argument (although it won&#39;t go over with Christians) is Gorillas.  400 lbs of intellegent, gentle, social, vegan primate!  If I don&#39;t make it as a human next time round, I&#39;m hoping for Gorilla! If there are any left :(<br/>
<br/>
Well, the point was...we all use the same arguments just differently.  And sometimes, we all argue the same thing and don&#39;t know it!  But it makes for lively reading, no?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518696741">Omnivors, so we have &quot;fangs&quot; (eye teeth) and teeth with the ability to tear<br/>
and with the strength to hold on AND we have the molars and side to side<br/>
abilities of grazers.<br/>

  I think you mean to say &quot;fundamentalist Christians&quot;, or whatever the exact<br/>
term is for those Christians (a small minority of the total) who believe in<br/>
a literal interpretation of the Bible (or a particular version therof) and<br/>
so don&#39;t believe in evolution.<br/>
<br/>
  Roman Catholics and most Protestants (Lutherans, Methodists,<br/>
Episcopalians, Presbyterians, etc.) are not told by their own priests or<br/>
pastors that evolution is wrong (though, of course, some of them might<br/>
decide this on their own). Correct me if I&#39;m wrong about any of these<br/>
denominations.<br/>
<br/>
  Is my use of the term &quot;fundamentalist Christians&quot; acceptable to those on<br/>
this list who have the beliefs I&#39;m describing, or is there some other term<br/>
they prefer?<br/>
