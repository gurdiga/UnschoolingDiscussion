<div id="ygrps-yiv-247269416">Adriane is 12 and is a superbly confidant youngster who happens to be more<br/>
interested in make-up and clothes than just about anything else &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
Anyway, she is very involved in 4-H and it requires a significant amount of<br/>
math in the paperwork (keeping feed records, budget sheets, etc.).  For the<br/>
last 3 years, I have talked her through the problems, pointing out patterns,<br/>
etc. and this year she has been able to do it independently, not with great<br/>
joy but without major problems.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday, we are driving back from Fort Worth after spending 4 days living in<br/>
a showbarn with goats.  We are stinky and tired but having a good time.  Out<br/>
of no where, Adriane says &quot;829 plus 829 is 1658&quot;.  I agreed and asked what<br/>
made her think of that.  &quot;The time was 8:29&quot;.  Ok.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane gets out a notebook and pen and starts adding 829 over and over and<br/>
over.  Suddenly she says &quot;Hey there&#39;s a pattern.  The last number is always<br/>
one smaller than it was before&quot;.  I&#39;m thinking that I had explained this to<br/>
her many times before but luckily kept my mouth shut.  She has now spent 3<br/>
days adding 829 and just enjoying the pattern.<br/>
<br/>
I had told her about the pattern many times and shown it to her and she<br/>
forgot it.  She discovered it once for herself and will remember it forever.<br/>
That&#39;s why we unschool.<br/>
