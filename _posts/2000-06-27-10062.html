Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for the inconvenience, eGroups had technical difficulties with<br/>
mail delivery last nigh.  Mail was not delivered for approximately 12 hours.<br/>
The problem has been resolved, and the backlogged mail will be delivered to<br/>
the groups as soon as possible.  Once again we apologize for the<br/>
inconvenience.<br/>
