<div id="ygrps-yiv-358446126">I Feel &quot;unschooling&quot; means non-formal, As John Holt used it. I am non-formal <br/>
in my typing~ i dont use caps or apostrophes~ I KNOW the grammar but i choose <br/>
to let it go on the net..to type faster and let my anal tendencies Go FREE as <br/>
the wind.. I express myself better when im free~ SO lets just let this all go <br/>
and be who we are......wodnerful parents of wonderful children who need <br/>
guidance becasue they dont have the epxerience of our years of life. Mostly <br/>
they need their birthrights: safety, health and love. You are spending a lot <br/>
of time justifying what you are all doing here.....I&#39;m trying to hang in here <br/>
as a group~ not enjoying myslef.... i know its my choice not to read the <br/>
email but im new and i dont want to judge too quickly. ~Denise (foster mom to <br/>
31 kids and adopted 3)</div>
