<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Its my understanding that phone etiquette is different in USA and Canada <br/>
&gt; (or maybe it&#39;s an East/West thing?) but my mother-in-law NEVER says &quot;bye&quot; when <br/>
&gt; she hands up the phone.  My sister-in-law dismisses it as an American thing <br/>
&gt; and laffs.  I don&#39;t laff.  I find it REALY obnoxious - because the line goes <br/>
&gt; dead - courtesy to me is to let the other person know you are done speaking - <br/>
&gt; they do this in Toastmasters even, so there is a &quot;standard&quot; of sorts.<br/>

raised in England.  We are used to the American way of calling someone, &quot;Hi Mik, <br/>
this is Nancy...is Barbara around?&quot;  But to him (and the other fellow) this <br/>
is very rude.  And the kids have always said, &quot;Hi, is Leila home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They feel we should first make small talk with them, before asking to speak <br/>
with their wives or children.  Like, &quot;Hi Mik, how are you today?  Are you <br/>
enjoying all this rain?  (etc, etc)....Well, if she&#39;s not busy, can I speak to <br/>
Barb?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten used to it and it is much more polite, but it&#39;s very hard for the <br/>
kids...still working on it...but very different.<br/>

kids?  and how are the pets?  etc etc.&quot;  I end up saying....&quot;Charlie do you <br/>
want to talk with Jackson?&quot;   &quot;He usually says yes and laughs.&quot;    I guess I <br/>
would rather let whoever needs to talk do it and get on with what I am doing.  I <br/>
am not offended by someone wanting to talk with my husband.   LOL.  <br/>

feel personally insulted if they picked up the phone and I just said <br/>
&quot;Hi Mike, can I talk to Barb?&quot; A little small talk is absolutely <br/>
essential - it is very very bad manners not to ask about the person&#39;s <br/>
health and each person in his/her family&#39;s health, etc., before asking <br/>
to speak to someone else or before getting to the point of the phone <br/>
call.<br/>
<br/>
Americans seem abrupt and rude to them, very often, because we&#39;re so <br/>
&quot;to the point.&quot; There are other ways we seem rude, too. They, for <br/>
example, always spend time going around a room greeting each person in <br/>
the room when they arrive at any kind of get-together and the people <br/>
already in the room ALL stand up and wait for the new arrival to reach <br/>
them, to exchange a few sentences of how are you&#39;s and how is your <br/>
family type stuff. They are not in a hurry at all when it comes to this <br/>
kind of thing - and we Americans seem to them that we just not have <br/>
time to be polite to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Living here, they have to remind themselves that it doesn&#39;t really mean <br/>
we&#39;re snubbing them and that it might &quot;feel&quot; rude to them but that we <br/>
really don&#39;t mean to be rude.<br/>
