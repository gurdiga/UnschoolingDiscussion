<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638331044">&lt;&lt; Part of being a thinking person is to read and listen and then to <br/>
realize what we don&#39;t know, what we need to know, and then to ask <br/>
questions to fill in some of those knowledge gaps.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  People should read and listen andthen think, and figure out what&#39;s <br/>
being said.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If we don&#39;t, and <br/>
we instead jump to conclusions, especially when those conclusions <br/>
imply negativity or some kind of bad behavior on the part of the <br/>
person communicating, then we are only showing our own ignorance of <br/>
the limitations of language, especially in this specific written <br/>
language medium.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that people here are not thinking, and are attacking, must have just <br/>
been from not carefully reading the tone of the forum, the description, and <br/>
maybe from not reading for a while before jumping in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used this analogy before, but it&#39;s apt.  If you go to a party, it&#39;s <br/>
customary, if you&#39;re arriving when it&#39;s already in swing, to look around a <br/>
bit before jumping in and telling stories and rearranging the food table.  F<br/>
irst you watch and see what&#39;s already happening, and get the feel for the <br/>
tone of the crowd.   <br/>
<br/>
On an e-mail list it&#39;s even harder, because you can&#39;t see eyes and facial <br/>
expressions, but you can read for a few days and see how the &quot;party&quot; is going.<br/>
