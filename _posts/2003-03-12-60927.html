 We&#39;re home now and he&#39;s just watching cartoons. My son is more relaxed today <br/>
 than I have seen him in a long time. I can&#39;t wait for him to &quot;graduate&quot; 3rd <br/>
 grade in June so he can come home for a real education. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why on earth would you need him to &quot;graduate&quot; THIRD grade?<br/>
He is being damaged every day he is there. If he&#39;s happy at home, let him <br/>
come home...for good!!!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
