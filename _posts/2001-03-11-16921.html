<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776985757">I&#39;m glad that the subject of unschooling and using workbooks came up <br/>
here.  When deciding to homeschool, unschooling&#39;s definition seemed <br/>
to be our life philosophy for raising our kids just naturally.  I am <br/>
amazed by how many &quot;unschoolers&quot; are using curriculums, textbooks or <br/>
testing their children.<br/>
<br/>
I have doubts sometimes, as a parent, about not &quot;doing enough&quot; for my <br/>
children and their education, I understand that part.  What I don&#39;t <br/>
understand is how you can unschool and force your children into doing <br/>
schoolwork that they don&#39;t want to do.  I agree 100% with those who <br/>
say that workbooks are great for those who want them.  I thought it <br/>
was wonderful to hear from an unschooler who happened to like explore <br/>
the world through literature and textbooks!  But her experience was <br/>
based on, I believe, the essence of unschooling, meaning she chose it <br/>
and was not forced into it.<br/>
<br/>
I have days that I am amazed by all of you that &quot;do&quot; so much to <br/>
educate your children, but when I try to &quot;do&quot; for them, they just <br/>
want to do their own thing.  I&#39;ve always respected that about them.  <br/>
Taking that huge leap of faith that your children will learn what <br/>
they need as they need to know it can be sooo hard, but they really, <br/>
really do!<br/>
<br/>
All of the wonderful suggested readings by John Holt come to mind, <br/>
and the freedom that comes with this kind of living!  I hope that <br/>
more families that consider themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; can truly <br/>
embrace this philosophy.  Good luck to all!<br/>
<br/>

Still being new to this,with my many moments of doubts, I am really <br/>
interested in what other unschoolers do all day.   I have a dd 12yrs <br/>
old. We have only been out of ps for about 10 months.  I find it hard <br/>
to get her motivated at all.  This year is much better than last, but <br/>
that could be because I have mellowed!!<br/>
Would you mind sharing a day in your household with me.<br/>

What do we DO?  That&#39;s always a hard question for us since every day <br/>
plays itself out differently.  So let&#39;s take today as an example...<br/>
<br/>
I have three children (8yo ds,6-1/2yo dd, 3-1/2 yo ds) and a baby <br/>
scheduled in 4 days.  I&#39;ll say that this pregnancy has been very hard <br/>
on me, I&#39;ve been sick throughout it, and that we live in Northern <br/>
Illinois and have had a loooong, winter, just to give you an idea of <br/>
where we are.<br/>
<br/>
The children all wake up at different times and each does something <br/>
like watch tv, color or play gameboy.  I&#39;m a late riser and since we <br/>
have nowhere we have to go today, we are all doing our own things. <br/>
All three spent most of the morning playing with the clay we made <br/>
yesterday.  We make A LOT of clay right now.  We have to read a <br/>
recipe (reading), measure all of the ingredients (math), cook it <br/>
(science, we change it from one substance to another), color it (art <br/>
& science; you wouldn&#39;t believe how many colors red, green, blue, and <br/>
yellow food coloring can make!), then play with it, which involves <br/>
art, creativity, story-telling, designing things, working together, <br/>
etc.  I believe that the clay-playing sparked another game for my two <br/>
oldest and they cleaned up and are playing that.  My youngest is <br/>
playing Arthur&#39;s Reading Race on the PC.<br/>
<br/>
I made the kids some breakfast and then they made lunch for <br/>
themselves and my 6 yo dd made lunch for the youngest, while I&#39;ve <br/>
been on the PC reading my emails!!<br/>
<br/>
Normally, I wouldn&#39;t look at my day in terms of what &quot;branches of <br/>
learning&quot; we are covering, but when you run down a day&#39;s worth of <br/>
living in our home, we cover what our state considers the eight <br/>
branches of learning.  But what I think is the coolest part of what <br/>
we do is the same thing that so many others write about; that moment <br/>
of discovery and all of the &quot;ah-ha&#39;s&quot; that comprise our children&#39;s <br/>
lives and the fact the we get to be part of that with them day in and <br/>
day out!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I usually can&#39;t motivate them to do &quot;school things&quot; that I may want <br/>
to see them do in my periods of doubt.  I believe that we want the <br/>
best for our children and that it&#39;s reasonable to say that we all <br/>
should question our life choices.  That&#39;s probably what led you to <br/>
homeschooling, then unschooling.  The idea of child-led learning is <br/>
on the complete opposite of the spectrum compared to school-led <br/>
learning, and is so counter-culture and against what most of us were <br/>
taught our whole entire lives.  I think it&#39;s safe to say that we are, <br/>
of course, going to doubt occasionally the less-travelled path that <br/>
we are all taking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop my ramblings after I say this, while I&#39;ve been typing this, <br/>
my 3yo son has asked me dozens of questions about the CD he&#39;s <br/>
playing, then my daughter came down and the two of them worked out <br/>
taking turns with the CD, then my 3yo came to me for some hugs and <br/>
kisses while he waits for his turn back, while my daughter is reading <br/>
the Arthur story.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s only 12:20 pm in a day in the life of....<br/>

almost sounds like ours. Naomi usually sleeps in to whatever. (usually up<br/>
around 10-11 am) and we have a late breakfast. Today she played waitress<br/>
and got me a bowl of cereal plus a refill on my coffee. She watches<br/>
disney television most of the time. But does play with paper, pen,<br/>
crayon..etc. Today we are going to meet other local<br/>
homeschoolers/unschoolers and I&#39;m looking forward to it. It&#39;ll be a first<br/>
for us as we&#39;ve only been doing this for 5 weeks.<br/>

Chris<br/>
First let me say I hope the baby arrives on time and all goes well.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your day. I try not to put things into <br/>
categories math/spelling/etc - but there are days when i still do.  <br/>
These days are getting less and less - and unschooling is becoming a <br/>
more natural thing.  How do you make clay?<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we got the sewing machine out. We onlt aquired this over <br/>
the weeekend, and we did have a go when we first got it - but dd was <br/>
too busy *hanging out* with ps friend.  (dd doesnt &#39;play&#39;anymore!) <br/>
Because we had no material we cut up an old sheet and dd made lots of <br/>
small /smaller and really small bags.......<br/>
<br/>
Today she has gone to work with her dad - if she had her way she <br/>
would go everyday.  I work 2 days a week.  She can choose to go with <br/>
either me or her dad - dad wins every time.  If I was to put working <br/>
with dad into lesson plans she would be covering :-  math, PE. <br/>
writing and reading, map reading, people skills, work experience, <br/>
confidence building, and relationship skills.<br/>
My dh is a courier, and dd works when she goes with him, and gets <br/>
*paid* so we can add budgetting to that list as she has to buy her <br/>
own stuff with the money - including clothes.....<br/>
<br/>
But of course i aren&#39;t going to look at it in school terms!!!!1<br/>
