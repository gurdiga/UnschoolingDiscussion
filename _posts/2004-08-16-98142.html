&lt;&lt; You have to be ro-active. Make yourself known. The only drawback is if I <br/>
wanted to go &quot;underground&quot;, it would be impossible! &lt;G&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you mean &quot;ro-ractive,&quot; Scooby?  &quot;O&#39;er active?&quot; &lt;g&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m laughing so hard I have tears in my eyes! &lt;g&gt; Duncan was watching <br/>
&quot;Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf&quot; when I wrote that! LOL<br/>
 <br/>
I mean PRO-active! Get out and do it yourself!<br/>

frequented by homeschoolers.     Used bookstore and health food shops are <br/>
other <br/>
possibilities.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

And after I wrote, I realized that I forgot to include La Leche League----and <br/>
even Sandra didn&#39;t mention it. Many La Lechers (huh?) have older children <br/>
they&#39;re unschooling. They&#39;re a great resource!<br/>
