Do any of ya&#39;ll participate in an unschooling (not<br/>
homeschooling) group or association?  There seem to be<br/>
numerous homeschooling organizations, but I have seen<br/>
few, if any unschooling organizations.  <br/>

When my kids first came out of school, and we discovered unschooling, I <br/>
formed my own group, along with a few of the women in my (you guessed it) LLL <br/>
group. It&#39;s called Unschooling Family Connection ( <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MarylandUFC/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MarylandUFC/</a> ). We strated out as 4-5 moms and the last time I checked we had <br/>
about 100 members.  our group has or will be getting together for Unschoolers <br/>
Night Out (Coffee, no kids) park days, flat water tubing, Trail riding on <br/>
horses, pool days, tent camping, festivals, very casual kids book group, bowling, <br/>
treehouse camping, beach trip for a week, hiking, and we have a weeklong &quot;camp&quot; <br/>
that is a very relaxed, unstructured time.  <br/>
<br/>
I would say about 50% of the email list is composed of locals who are <br/>
somewhere on the unschooling continuum, who really use the list for Things To Do, yet <br/>
never show up at our events. There are probably a few who are much more <br/>
schooly in their educational thinking, but I try to ensure when people request to <br/>
join that we are a support group for UNschoolers and curriculum talk, etc. is <br/>
inappropriate. We are there to help people unschool. There are probably 40 <br/>
local lists in our area (MD counties west of washington,DC) so there&#39;s plenty of <br/>
room for that elsewhere.<br/>
Of the remaining 50% subbed to the list probably half again are occasional <br/>
participants with the remainder being the core group.<br/>
<br/>
The group is 4 years old. I&#39;ve recently moved further west to the eastern <br/>
panhandle of WV and plan to start another Unschooling Family Connection here.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you start your own group? It can be done now in about 15 minutes, <br/>
all you do is start a yahoo group, and make a packet of flyers. We put ours up <br/>
at the health food stores, bookstores and other places like that, and we <br/>
searched the web for various general HS places that would put a little blurb about <br/>
our group. I think we had one at Jon&#39;s Homeschool page, probably NHEN, too. We <br/>
also talked it up alot on the local HS lists.<br/>
<br/>
The Border&#39;s books and Music that we held our night out in, was very pleased <br/>
to host us, we received lots of coffee coupons and the person in charge of <br/>
events went out of her way to make sure that the hsing community was considered <br/>
during teacher week, and other events.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been very very worth it.<br/>

This is great Elissa! Would you mind if I started something like this <br/>
here in Oregon using your format? (IOW copying your desription word <br/>
for word.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
