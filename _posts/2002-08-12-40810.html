<div id="ygrps-yiv-959912272">I had heard of this before but didn&#39;t know any details.  I found this <br/>
article today.  While it is definately worth any price compared to a missing <br/>
child it sounded expensive to me.  Maybe once it has been around longer it <br/>
will get more affordable.  $300 per child + a monthly subscription fee which <br/>
they didn&#39;t say how much it would be, YIKES!<br/>

A Device to Track Missing People<br/>
By SABRA CHARTRAND<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Samantha Runion, Danielle van Dam and Elizabeth Short were snatched <br/>
from their homes, parents everywhere shared the dread and sense of <br/>
helplessness of the girls&#39; families. How do you find a child who has simply <br/>
vanished at the hands of a stranger?<br/>
<br/>
It is at times impossible. But technology does exist that can pinpoint a <br/>
person&#39;s location using orbiting satellites. Now an inventor who originally <br/>
wanted to tap the global positioning satellite system to find her runaway <br/>
dog has won several patents for applying her idea to following and finding <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer Durst, a single mother from Oyster Bay, N.Y., and two partners have <br/>
patented a lightweight, portable G.P.S. transceiver that she says is <br/>
designed to be &quot;form-fitted into a backpack, a baseball hat or a belt,&quot; for <br/>
example. Ms. Durst, Eugene Fowler and Joseph McAlexander have received one <br/>
patent for a &quot;pet locator&quot; and two more for a &quot;mobile object locator&quot; that <br/>
can be used to track animals or people. The Patent and Trademark Office has <br/>
notified them that their fourth patent has been approved, although it has <br/>
not been issued yet.<br/>
<br/>
Their devices can be programmed with boundaries, and if those boundaries are <br/>
exceeded, the devices send messages directly to a cellphone, pager, two-way <br/>
personal assistant, traditional phone or even an e-mail address. Those <br/>
messages are followed by continuously updated geographic information, she <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Up until now, a G.P.S. device could tell you where you are,&quot; Ms. Durst <br/>
explained last week, just days after her latest patent was issued. &quot;But it <br/>
doesn&#39;t tell me where you are. What I&#39;ve done is make it, `Now tell me <br/>
directly where you are.&#39; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hope we don&#39;t get to the point where our kids have to sleep in their own <br/>
homes with this,&quot; she added. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about the negative association that <br/>
comes with the news of these poor abducted children. I had hoped this would <br/>
be a warm, fuzzy application, a way for parents to feel better at an <br/>
amusement park.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, she said she could envision it being used several ways � &quot;if <br/>
my daughter was playing on her bike in front of the house or out in the <br/>
yard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A parent would program the perimeter of the yard or neighborhood into Ms. <br/>
Durst&#39;s gadget. Those coordinates could be changed or updated at any time. <br/>
If the child went for a walk with a parent, the adult could use a password <br/>
to suspend the boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
When the person wearing the gadget leaves the specified perimeter, an alert <br/>
is sent to a designated two-way radio device. Location information follows <br/>
in the form of text, figures, graphics or numbers, and is updated every few <br/>
seconds, in effect following a person down a street, through a neighborhood <br/>
or around an amusement park.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It could say, `Elvis has left the building,&#39; &quot; Ms. Durst explained, &quot;and <br/>
would update the location until the pet or person is recovered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the tracking system is removed for any reason, an alert and last known <br/>
location are transmitted. Ms. Durst said she also designed a model that <br/>
incorporates a &quot;panic button&quot; so someone in distress can send their own <br/>
alarm about their location.<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Durst said she designed the system to notify the person back at the home <br/>
base directly. Other G.P.S. systems send data to a central computer.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want to have to contact a call center,&quot; she explained. &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
want to wait online to find out where my kid is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The device weighs about seven ounces, though Ms. Durst said she hoped it <br/>
would become smaller as the technology advanced. It runs on a rechargeable <br/>
battery and picks up its G.P.S. signals with a flat, patchlike antenna.<br/>
<br/>
Even though abductions by strangers � like those of the Runion, Van Damm and <br/>
Short girls � are rare, countless children are temporarily lost every year <br/>
in crowded amusement parks, at the beach and in shopping malls. Adults are <br/>
also often lost in a variety of ways, too: Alzheimer&#39;s patients sometimes <br/>
wander off, hikers and mountain climbers disappear in the wilderness, <br/>
soldiers go missing in action. Ms. Durst says any of these people could be <br/>
tracked with precision if only they were linked to the G.P.S. system.<br/>
<br/>
But the idea actually started with her dog.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;About three years ago, I was searching for my lost dog in the pouring <br/>
rain,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I&#39;m a divorced mom with two kids at home, and I had an <br/>
invisible fence, but my dog would just break through it. I had the choice of <br/>
once again piling the kids in the car at night to look for the dog, or <br/>
leaving the kids at home alone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Needless to say, I put the kids in the car and drove around in the rain, <br/>
with everyone crying over the dog,&quot; she said. Her search made her think <br/>
about the tracking system called LoJack that many people install in their <br/>
cars. &quot;I thought, there&#39;s LoJack for cars, so we should have LoDog,&quot; <br/>
recalled Ms. Durst, who did not find the dog until the next day.<br/>
<br/>
With two partners, Ms. Durst began work on a pet locator, a lightweight and <br/>
programmable receiver-transmitter that used the G.P.S. and could be embedded <br/>
in a dog&#39;s collar.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;After the initial application for the pet locator, the other applications <br/>
became obvious,&quot; Ms. Durst said.<br/>
<br/>
She and her partners have several prototypes, including one that is part of <br/>
a child&#39;s fanny pack and could be rented to parents at amusement parks like <br/>
Disney World, and one for the military that she said &quot;will send the location <br/>
of a soldier directly to a platoon leader or to each other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She hopes that at the very least, her invention will mean &quot;you&#39;ll never see <br/>
those `Lost Dog&#39; signs again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The system for tracking children or adults is not available for sale yet, <br/>
even though Ms. Durst and her partners have a Web site at www.gpstracks.com <br/>
that offers information about the dog-finding collar. Ms. Durst estimated <br/>
the system would cost about $300, plus a monthly subscription fee. She and <br/>
her fellow inventors, Eugene Fowler and Joseph McAlexander, have won three <br/>
patents: the pet locator is 6, 172, 640, and the &quot;mobile object locator&quot; <br/>
received 6,236,358 and 6,421,001.<br/>
