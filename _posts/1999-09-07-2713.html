<div id="ygrps-yiv-863929600">D.J. raises some points:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do not understand what is the big deal about giving our children<br/>
&gt; guidance in areas where they need nudging. I am well aware that for<br/>
&gt; some people who call themselves &quot;unschoolers,&quot; my way of thinking<br/>
&gt; might be considered politically incorrect.  (BIG WOOOOoooo!)[Image]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So this whole question of how to &quot;unschool&quot; math and writing begs a<br/>
&gt; whole other question: what precisely is meant by &quot;unschooling?&quot;  To<br/>
&gt; me, it means NOT learning the way public schools try to force rigid<br/>
&gt; learning upon kids.  Unschool = NOT school.  And we do NOT school at<br/>
&gt; my house.  We have fun and learn.  That is why I have chosen the term<br/>
&gt; Natural Learners to describe what we do.  It doesn&#39;t smack of the 60s<br/>
&gt; (unhip uncool ungroovy unschool).  It is a natural term that describes<br/>
&gt; a natural process.  You don&#39;t need to get hung up on positions of<br/>
&gt; authority.<br/>
&gt; A mom&#39;s position can naturally be one of guidance.  A kid&#39;s position<br/>
&gt; can naturally be one of being a kid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In another post D.J. says:<br/>
&lt;Perhaps Linda&#39;s<br/>
reaction was because she thought I was dissing what unschooling is<br/>
about.  I am NOT.<br/>
Unschooling is NOT unguided.  It is guidance with the highest awareness<br/>
of sensitivity to the<br/>
kids.  It is allowing kids to learn by living. (It is Yoda style<br/>
guidance!) &gt;<br/>
<br/>
And in another:<br/>
&lt;The whole issue of &quot;pushing&quot; at our house is a non-issue.  There may be<br/>
parents who want to nudge their kids some and there may be others who<br/>
don&#39;t.  It is definitely a parental perogative.<br/>
Your line of questioning is definitely designed to put one on the<br/>
defensive, even as that non-homeschooling mother in the store did to<br/>
that woman who homeschooled her children.  Let us just say that our<br/>
parenting styles probably differ to some degree.  Whether or not you<br/>
have a problem with what I require or do not require of my children is<br/>
really a moot point.  I don&#39;t have any problem with how you are raising<br/>
your kids.<br/>
I knew very well that I was introducing ideas that some people would<br/>
frown on, but I can&#39;t let that stop me from being honest in my post, nor<br/>
can I let people&#39;s pushing their opinions on me sway me from what I<br/>
intend on doing.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now, it seems to me, D.J that you didn&#39;t like the tone of Linda&#39;s<br/>
questions, yet they seemed quite reasonable to me in the context of this<br/>
list. How we each define unschooling is own own business as is how we<br/>
bring up our children. However, this list is, and I quote from the<br/>
onelist description:<br/>
<br/>
Description<br/>
              This is a networking and discussion list for the<br/>
Unschooling.com website.<br/>
              For more information:<br/>
              <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>
<br/>
 Now, in terms of the descriptions of unschooling found on the<br/>
Unschooling.com website I thought Linda&#39;s questions were perfectly<br/>
reasonable. This is the 2nd time since this list started not long ago<br/>
that this sort of discussion has arisen, and the same thing has happened<br/>
on another list I was on. I&#39;m relatively new to internet and lists, so<br/>
perhaps those who have been around longer than I could clarify. Is it<br/>
usual for a list to start with a particular focus, and then to have<br/>
people join and complain about it having that focus?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897038956">In a previous post Carol writes, &quot; Is it usual<br/>
for a list to start with a particular focus, and then to have people<br/>
join and complain about it having that focus?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
to which I respond, &quot;who is complaining?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Carol, I am NOT trying to change the focus of this list.  I LIKE<br/>
unschooling.  I like to share ideas.  I DO NOT like having my style of<br/>
unschooling criticized, nor do I like being accused of things I did NOT<br/>
do such as A. change the focus of this list or B. complaining about the<br/>
lists&#39; focus.<br/>
<br/>
I JUST want to visit and share with parents who unschool.  It seems like<br/>
neither you nor Linda want me around.  It is tempting to just leave, but<br/>
then I might miss out on some good friendships, including ones with you<br/>
and Linda.  Perhaps I am misinterpreting your comments, but it seems<br/>
hard to give them any other spin other than the critizisms they either<br/>
imply or directly state.  It is also entirely possible that I have<br/>
misread your intent and am being overly defensive.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like telling ya&#39;ll, &quot;Like, you guys, LIGHTEN UP  already.  I do<br/>
things differently from ya&#39;ll. SO? Ya&#39;ll are beatin me up, and then<br/>
tellin me I&#39;m complainin! Get real!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If my post initially treaded on your toes, I am truly sorry.  I am not<br/>
being facetious.  I really mean that.  When I get in with a group of<br/>
unschoolers, I always try to be perfectly clear about how I am applying<br/>
that philosophy, since I do have friends whose philosophy and<br/>
application differs from mine.  I don&#39;t want to come across as being<br/>
fake or just cowtowing to whatever opinion comes down the pike.  I may<br/>
agree with it.  I may not.<br/>
<br/>
If I overreacted to Linda&#39;s comments, I am sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Carol you quoted largely from my letters and then somehow seemed<br/>
satisfied that you had proven some point.  What was your point?   You<br/>
said, &quot;Now, in terms of the descriptions of unschooling found on the<br/>
Unschooling.com website I thought Linda&#39;s questions were perfectly<br/>
reasonable.&quot;  Perhaps they were.  I went back to reread some unschooling<br/>
posts from the links you gave me, and the one I read was, &quot;There are as<br/>
many different ways of defining unschooling as<br/>
                 there are people doing it. Reading through what various<br/>
<br/>
                 people have to say about it may help you to a better<br/>
                 understanding, or at least be interesting and make you<br/>
think!<br/>
                 These are not meant to be complete definitions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, I sure didn&#39;t join this list to get into a big hairy argument and<br/>
pollute the listwaves with it, but I will respond to publicly made<br/>
innuendos.  My sincere apologies to all.  I will not address these<br/>
issues again.  Any further differings with how I do things regarding<br/>
unschooling I will post with individuals personally, regardless of where<br/>
they post their comments.  I thank the list participants and moderators<br/>
for being so gracious, and again, I apoligize for creating an entry that<br/>
made so many waves.<br/>

<br/>
Nothing in my post was meant to criticize *you* as a person.  I disagree<br/>
with *your methods*, and that is what I stated- what and why I disagreed.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t have *anything* to do with &quot;not wanting you around&quot;.<br/>

I was stating my very strong disagreement with *requiring* anything<br/>

You disagree.  Not a problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then why do you have such a problem with someone else&#39;s opinions?  That&#39;s<br/>
what I feel is odd- that you want to be able to state your honest opinion,<br/>
but if I do so, I&#39;m attacking you or not wanting you around.  I&#39;m not doing<br/>
either one- I&#39;m simply disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
Did I, in my post, say anything at all about you changing your opinion?<br/>
Did I tell you that you have to do things my way?  No, I said I dislike the<br/>
way you&#39;ve chosen.  I talked about what I think and what I feel.  NOT what<br/>
you should do.  There&#39;s a BIG difference.<br/>

Well... from what I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s pretty typical for the <br/>
unschoolers-with-some-reservations to think that the whole-hog-unschoolers <br/>
are picking on them when the latter write about whole-hog unschooling in <br/>
response to the posts of the former.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t totally grasp why this is, but if we hang on to our inner calm during <br/>
the ensuing discussion, we might finally figure it out. ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
I think this list is a great place to stay for some challenging discussion.  <br/>
I&#39;m happy to have all kinds of interesting people here.  I hope we can work <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574893495">I must have been sleeping when the exchange mentioned below occurred but I<br/>
certainly can speak generally to the subject of diplomacy.  Yes a gentle tone<br/>
accomplishes a great deal.<br/>
<br/>
I myself am guilty of getting just a titch over excited when someone pushes one<br/>
of my many buttons and some times am terse, abrupt, short, acrimonious, and<br/>
sadly probably have my own brand of officiousness which I absolutely detest in<br/>
others.  Did I mention overbearing.  Forgive me in advance and I would hope<br/>
people are thick skinned enough not to judge people on the basis of the<br/>
occasional imprudent statement or &quot;between the lines&quot; snottiness.  People are<br/>
doing the best they can at any given moment and of course we all want to do<br/>
better.  I vote for gentleness even when receiving not so gentle remarks.<br/>

&gt; other question: what precisely is meant by &quot;unschooling?&quot;  To me, it means<br/>
&gt; NOT learning the way public<br/>
&gt; schools try to force rigid learning upon kids.  Unschool = NOT school.<br/>
&gt; And we do NOT<br/>
&gt; school at my house.  We have fun and learn.  That is why I have chosen the<br/>
&gt; term Natural<br/>
&gt; Learners to describe what we do.  It doesn&#39;t smack of the 60s (unhip<br/>
&gt; uncool ungroovy<br/>
&gt; unschool).  It is a natural term that describes a natural process.  You<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need to get hung up<br/>
&gt; on positions of authority.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of which I could have chosen to take personal offence to - being the<br/>
age I am - a teenager in the 60&#39;s and all &lt;g&gt;  The sort of unschooling<br/>
talked about on Unschooling.com is a lot more than just &lt;Unschool+NOT<br/>
school&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I felt Linda was just asking you about aspects of your style of unschooling<br/>
that are different from the styles of many other unschoolers, and those<br/>
talked about on Unschooling.com..<br/>
<br/>
You also said, in 2 different posts<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The whole issue of &quot;pushing&quot; at our house is a non-issue.  There<br/>
&gt; may<br/>
&gt; be parents who want to nudge their kids some and there may be others who<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t.  It is definitely a parental perogative.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Everybody needs a little push now and then.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it is a parental perogative. So is the style of homeschooling. This<br/>
list is for discussing unschooling. Discussion, I thought, involved a<br/>
conversation of some sort, not just a whole lot of people making statements<br/>
which are never commented on? I like to read what others do, ask questions,<br/>
then decide if I stick to my original view, or change in light of new ideas<br/>
and information. And having done that in this case, I have to admit that I<br/>
do push my kids sometimes. But what I hoped to find on this list was support<br/>
for trying to learn to become a more unschooling homeschooler and that is in<br/>
fact what I assumed the purpose of the list  was. I cannot for the life of<br/>
me see how pushing can be part of unschooling.  Perhaps we have a different<br/>
definition of pushing? Perhaps to you it means the same as guidance? But I<br/>
certainly don&#39;t want to ask you to explain how that works for you in a<br/>
unschooling context now, because I feel that you would be likely to take it<br/>
as criticism.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I knew very well that I was introducing ideas that some people would frown<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; on,<br/>
&gt; but I can&#39;t let that stop me from being honest in my post, nor can I let<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s pushing their opinions on me sway me from what I intend on doing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe Linda was pushing her opinions on you. And I don&#39;t see much<br/>
point of being on a list unless I am interested in listening to others<br/>
opinions, with the possibilitity in mind that they *might* sway me because<br/>
they *might* have more experience, or knowledge or insight than me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Perhaps Linda&#39;s<br/>
&gt; reaction was because she thought I was dissing what unschooling is about.<br/>
&gt; I am NOT.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is NOT unguided.  It is guidance with the highest awareness of<br/>
&gt; sensitivity to the<br/>
&gt; kids.  It is allowing kids to learn by living. (It is Yoda style<br/>
&gt; guidance!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Assuming you mean &#39;discussing&#39;? That&#39;s just it. You&#39;re not &#39;discussing&#39;. You<br/>
made statements about what you think unschooling is, but rejected<br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I JUST want to visit and share with parents who unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too. But I have nowhere, ever, in the 13 and a half years I&#39;ve been<br/>
homeschooling and trying to unschool, seeing &#39;pushing&#39; described as part of<br/>
unschooling. Which is why I said &lt;in terms of the descriptions of<br/>
unschooling found on the Unschooling.com website I thought Linda&#39;s questions<br/>
were perfectly reasonable. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems like<br/>
&gt; neither you nor Linda want me around.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a matter of not wanting you personally D.J., around. I don&#39;t own<br/>
this list, so it&#39;s not for me to say. But over the years I have seen many<br/>
support groups, and more recently e-mail lists start out with one focus and<br/>
then change focus, so that, in the case of the support groups anyway, the<br/>
people that wanted the original focus have had to go away and start anew.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is tempting to just leave, but<br/>
&gt; then I might miss out on some good friendships, including ones with you<br/>
&gt; and Linda.  Perhaps I am misinterpreting your comments, but it seems<br/>
&gt; hard to give them any other spin other than the critizisms they either<br/>
&gt; imply or directly state.  It is also entirely possible that I have<br/>
&gt; misread your intent and am being overly defensive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a vegetarian, and I write poetry, and I make hand bound books, I&#39;m into<br/>
homeopathy and natural therapies and homebirth and child-led weaning and we<br/>
have just bought some land that we are going to build on and develop along<br/>
permaculture lines and ...... but I don&#39;t expect to discuss them here. Nor<br/>
do I expect to discuss structured curriculum or &#39;pushing&#39;. Except maybe to<br/>
ask help and support when I feel a surge of pushiness descending on me &lt;g&gt; I<br/>
don&#39;t want or intend to criticise you. Homeschoolers are by nature a strong<br/>
minded lot. But if we can&#39;t question or discuss statements about the nature<br/>
of unschooling, as Linda did, then what&#39;s the point of an &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>
discussion list?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;There are as<br/>
&gt; many different ways of defining unschooling as<br/>
&gt;                  there are people doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. But I still believe there are some things that just aren&#39;t<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39;. Many of which find a place in my life, to my regret. But if<br/>
you eat meat only once a week, it is still intrinsically incorrect to claim<br/>
that that is vegetarian behaviour. The lines are far more blurred with<br/>
unschooling but I still believe that blurry though they may be, discussing<br/>
the lines is part of what this list is about. Denying discussion about<br/>
unschooling *is*, IMO, getting away from the focus of this &#39;unschooling<br/>
networking and discussion&#39; list.<br/>
<br/>
Please, I&#39;m not trying to be horrid to you on a personal level. I have<br/>
friends with all sorts of different religions, lifestyles, homeschooling<br/>
styles. But I don&#39;t like being accused of being intolerant or whatever, for<br/>
saying that I want to *discuss* unschooling on an unschooling list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720528270">Dear Linda,<br/>
Thank you for your post.  I joined this list yesterday or the day<br/>
beofre.  I am NOT a schoolish person, so it is weird to me to be reacted<br/>
to as though I were one.  I am comforted to hear that you and Carol were<br/>
not just trying to get rid of someone who held a viewpoint different<br/>
from your own.<br/>
<br/>
I meant the following post in terms of people taking offense at how I do<br/>
things, not in terms of differences in methods.<br/>
&quot;Any further differings with how I do things regarding unschooling I<br/>
will post with individuals personally, regardless of where they post<br/>
their comments.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In your post, you said rather tersely &quot;Then why do you have such a<br/>
problem with someone else&#39;s opinions?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I DON&#39;T have a problem with others opinions, I have a problem with<br/>
statements that sound more confronting and condescending than oriented<br/>
toward discussion.  As someone else noted, the comments directed toward<br/>
me felt less than courteous.<br/>
<br/>
I will take this discussion group anew and try not to take offense at<br/>
your terse manner of writing.  After all, we can&#39;t hear the tone in one<br/>
another&#39;s voices, and that goes a long way toward meaning in<br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, thank you for your post.<br/>

Carol -- NO ONE is accusing you of being intolerant or whatever for<br/>

Carol, I do not use structured curriculum and any pushing I do again, I<br/>
claim as my own parental perogative, not that I am on some power trip to<br/>
push my kids to do or say or be or whatever nefarious ulterior motive<br/>
you might imagine a parent might have for giving a kid a little nudge to<br/>
do something.  You are reacting to some imaginary ME that doesn&#39;t<br/>

word.  What you imagine I am doing, I most certainly am not.<br/>
<br/>
I am staying with this list because I like the ideas here, and yes, even<br/>
all the people.  I may be PMSing out to the max with my reaction to<br/>

There were several in this digest along with your rudeness.<br/>
Did you read?<br/>
Although you keep trying to sidetrack everyone, there has actually been some <br/>
useful discussion about portfolios, meeting other unschoolers and the <br/>
conference.<br/>
Previous discussions (previous to the angry attacks on some of the long time <br/>
members and the list owner) have included the day to day coming and goings of <br/>
unschoolers, joyful discoveries they&#39;ve made, helping new people understand <br/>
unschooling better and how to relax, acheivments of our children etc....<br/>
It&#39;s funny, cuz I&#39;m on a list that Sandra started and it is the MOST <br/>
wonderful list for discussion of the joyful flow of unschooling.<br/>
None of this snarky meanness I&#39;m experiencing here lately.<br/>
I think HEM has done a wonderful thing in supporting this list and Helen has <br/>
been an angel putting up with some of the ups and downs here.<br/>
If the intent of the list is to discuss unschooling (yes, that covers a whole <br/>
lot of topics, including rap music) then please, let us do it.<br/>

<br/>
I just found a homeschooling portfolio book at the library.  And I<br/>
checked out Linda Dobson&#39;s newer book The First Year of Homeschooling<br/>
Your Child.  I think she does a **great** job in this book of<br/>
understanding how a mom with a child in school might feel.  She<br/>
addresses the frustrations one might feel with a school system that<br/>
sends home a lot of mysterious homework and she acknowledges the fears a<br/>
parent might feel before moving into homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think this book could convert a lot of people who are trembling on the<br/>
brink.  If I were financing a nationwide unschooling revolution, I&#39;d<br/>
probably spend less on molotov cocktails and more on copies of this book.<br/>
