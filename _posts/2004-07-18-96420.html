<div id="ygrps-yiv-543909991">It has been almost a year since Sandra, Joyce, and I took over <br/>
ownership of this list. It&#39;s been a great year and we&#39;re happy that the <br/>
list has grown and people seem to find it useful. We have found that <br/>
our list policies are working well, in general, to let people know what <br/>
to expect from the list. However, we&#39;re changing our policy that people <br/>
wait two weeks before posting and will, from now on, just &quot;suggest&quot; <br/>
that people read for at least a couple of weeks in order to get to know <br/>
the list. We&#39;re making this change because it is a lot of work for <br/>
moderators to constantly keep track of how long new people have been on <br/>
the list and because people have complained about this requirement.<br/>
