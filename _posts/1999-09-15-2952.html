<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306347504">Hello Chelle,<br/>
<br/>
I am farily new to this list too.  I have an 8yo boy that I pulled out of <br/>
public school this year.  He was in a similar situation as your son and it <br/>
was so frustrating!  Last year mine started 1st grade with an IEP for speech, <br/>
reading resource and occupational therapy (for small movements).  This is <br/>
what he had the previous year at a different school (where he was in 1st <br/>
grade also).  Upon evaluation at his new school they pretty much cancelled <br/>
all aspects of the IEP (they said he wasn&#39;t far enough behind too!) except <br/>
speech - but only because he create stories that moved in a logical (or <br/>
chronological) order.  This all despite the fact that he is very hard to <br/>
understand when he talks (he has problems pronouncing many consonants and <br/>
letter blends).  I was so upset when they removed his IEP and he lost all <br/>
extra help he was getting (and desperately needed).  I wish I had pulled him <br/>
out right then and there, but I was still working full time and didn&#39;t see <br/>
how I was going to be able to stay home to homeschool.  He struggled so much <br/>
this past school year, that it just broke my heart.  He ended up HATING <br/>
school with a passion and has such an aversion to everything &quot;schoolish&quot; now. <br/>
 I had signed him up for a reading comprehension class this summer that I <br/>
thought was geared towards kids that were behind in some way.  Boy was I <br/>
wrong.  This teacher had no compassion or care for a child that wasn&#39;t <br/>
keeping up in her summer school class.  After many tears and feelings of <br/>
failure from him, I yanked him from the class.  What is sad is he didn&#39;t have <br/>
any desire to attend a science experiments class (which he loves) due to the <br/>
bad experience in the other class.  <br/>
<br/>
We are now taking our first homeschooling year very slow and very relaxed.  I <br/>
am hoping that he will get his love of learning back and begin to enjoy <br/>
learning new things.  Right now all he wants to do is play with his cars, <br/>
trains or Nintendo or watch tv.  We do a lot of &quot;fun&quot; learning things <br/>
together like baking, playing lots of games and lots of art projects.  I just <br/>
wanted you to know that you are not alone in the frustrating battle against <br/>
public schools and their lack of priority with our children.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I talked to his teacher last week and voiced my concerns and her comments <br/>
 </span></blockquote>were &quot;Well, he isn&#39;t the lowest in the class and you can always retain him <br/>
next year.&quot;  Sheesh, that didn&#39;t fill me with a lot of hope.  The school has <br/>
decided he compensates so qualifies for no extra help though he is 2 grade <br/>
levels behind.  I guess you have to be 3 or 4 grade levels behind to get help <br/>
around there which just does not make sense to me. &gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551004023">Hi Sheri,<br/>
  We do have a lot in common with our sons.  My son also has a speech problem <br/>
and the school has never done anything about it.  He was evaluated once and <br/>
they decided he was ok.  He doesn&#39;t always pronounce his consonants right <br/>
either.  As an example,  my daughters name is Chandel and he always says, <br/>
&quot;Chanel&quot; unless I slow him down and have him pronounce it out better.  Of <br/>
course I have a hearing loss so maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s so obvious to me, he&#39;s <br/>
way harder for me to understand.  <br/>
  I tried like heck to get Everett into IEP but they keep refusing me.  I <br/>
think the school system is going down hill fast.  I can&#39;t believe they dont&#39; <br/>
want to catch up the kids who are little behind to save them from being <br/>
really behind.  It just makes no logical sense to me what so ever.<br/>
  Everett doesn&#39;t hate learning but he&#39;s not thrilled with &quot;school work&quot; <br/>
either.  I kept him home today and we&#39;re doing a trial run here.  I had him <br/>
sit down with me and read the paper.  We plotted places on a map where the <br/>
stories were taking place.  He liked that.  He wasn&#39;t into Dear Ann and Abby <br/>
as much as I was though.  &lt;g&gt;  I&quot;m getting ready to play with money with him <br/>
right now.  He&#39;s so happy to be home day he is right this minute cleaning the <br/>
livingroom for me.  He&#39;s a sweet kid.<br/>
  Thanks for responding, we&#39;ll have to keep in touch as our sons grow.<br/>
  Thank you to everyone who has welcomed me so far.  I&#39;m enjoying the list.<br/>
Smiles,<br/>
Chelle<br/>
