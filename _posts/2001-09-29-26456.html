<div id="ygrps-yiv-452468351">Hi All,<br/>
I&#39;m new here. I&#39;m an unschooling mother of two. Ellie, who is five, and Jake <br/>
who is seven. We live in eastern PA. Jake and Ellie love to play outside, and <br/>
playing with Lego&#39;s, and of course much much more! I enjoy, cooking, being <br/>
with the children, and my husband, Evan. Well, I&#39;m sure we will have many <br/>
more conversations with all of you!!<br/>
talk to you all soon,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996718756">Hello everyone, I&#39;ve been reading most of the posts for a few months now<br/>
and I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Kelly and I have 2 kids<br/>
(daughter 9 and son 4).  We&#39;ve been at home together for a few years<br/>
(after a few months into 1st grade) and what started out as something I<br/>
did because I was able to (because I work at home) has now become a<br/>
priority.  I wouldn&#39;t want it any other way!  I have been all over the<br/>
place with different approaches to learning and &quot;school&quot;, but have<br/>
naturally gravitated toward unschooling. I am still learning/absorbing<br/>
what unschooling IS and is not and how this applies to our lives here<br/>
minute by minute.  I have found this list to be a VERY valuable resource<br/>
toward this end.  I really enjoy how many of the posts provide me with<br/>
insight into my own &quot;stuff&quot; and encourage me to examine my beingness.<br/>
I&#39;m looking foward to the being part of the group!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309143487">Hello - I am new to this group :o) I have 3 kids (ages 9, 7 & 5; <br/>
boy, girl, boy) and live in Omaha, Nebraska.  We have been <br/>
homeschooling for 2 years now & I think I am finally on the right <br/>
track!!!  Such a relief.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there any local support groups for unschoolers?  Might be a shot <br/>
in the dark, but worth asking! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655513898">Hello everyone...I&#39;ve really enjoyed reading on this list. Now it&#39;s <br/>
time to introduce myself...I&#39;m Amanda with DH and DS4 and DD2.5. <br/>
We&#39;ve been HEing for about 1.5 years now, here in the UK. Mostly it <br/>
feels like we&#39;re just parenting at this stage in their lives and I&#39;m <br/>
really looking forward to being able to say we are Autonomous...but <br/>
mostly the energy needs to come from me (which flags alot on the big <br/>
tantrum days - DD is taking up much of my time). We muddle through <br/>
and get messy and go to the park...it&#39;s OK mostly, just very noisy <br/>
and upsetting for DS at those times. Stressful.<br/>
We&#39;re (half)considering moving to California...hence joining this <br/>
list, apart from the very lovely honesty you all convey, which is <br/>
freshing and heartwarming...DH has been offered a job in the bay <br/>
area. We&#39;re coming to Half Moon Bay and Monterey for a week in <br/>
October to get the feel of life over there....any words of wisdom <br/>
much appreciated, in fact, any expat HEing families from the UK out <br/>
there?! <br/>

<br/>
Hi --<br/>
<br/>
California housing is VERY expensive, especially in cities.  I recommend <br/>
that you look at rents and home purchase prices on the internet before <br/>
you come, just so you don&#39;t faint from shock &lt;g&gt; when the hideous <br/>
reality is revealed. &lt;gg&gt;  (I think there is hardly anything for sale <br/>
near Monterey that costs less than $400,000.)<br/>
<br/>
I love homeschooling in California because we have decent weather for <br/>
going to the park with other homeschoolers most of the year.  (Some rain <br/>
from November through March or April, but not continuous, and never any <br/>
snow.)<br/>
<br/>
For great information about homeschooling in California, look at <br/>

<br/>
Also, HSC has an email list through Yahoo Groups:  CA-Homeschooling-HSC. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you do have a nice visit.<br/>
