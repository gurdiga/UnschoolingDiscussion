wasn&#39;t  about unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
       And I am right with you in the middle of that big middle, not on <br/>
either extreme. I don&#39;t know about you guys but my parenting decisions are mostly <br/>
*all* hard decisions, with potential for both good and for harm. And usually <br/>
specific to each situation, tough to generalize about and thankfully unnecessary <br/>
to generalize about. That&#39;s why we avoid standardized things like school, and <br/>
prize real, personal stories, right? :)  JJ<br/>
