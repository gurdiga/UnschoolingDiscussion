<div id="ygrps-yiv-366815667">I&#39;m trying to help a friend who is embroiled in a post-divorce disaster concerning his children. He and his ex have joint legal custody of the 14yos and 15yos. Both have been &quot;diagnosed&quot; by the schools as being ADD and, therefore, mandated to have Ritalin. The mother is in full support of the course and will not hear of another approach. The young men in question do not want to be drugged and the father supports them. The elder son has flat out refused to take any meds and has weaned himself off but is now miserable living with the school system and the mother. The younger son will not be permitted to attend school in the father&#39;s town without meds unless the mother signs an educational consent form which she will not do. Last year, the father had to pay $650 each month to his school district to allow the younger son to attend school there as a non-resident because the mother would not sign the paper. Apparently, this boy encountered some fairly awful situations while in school in the mother&#39;s town because the father feels that to return there would be life-threatening for the boy. Resultingly, the father and step-mother want to homeschool the 14yos.<br/>
 <br/>
The biggest stumbling block in their situation is that the father encounters attorney after attorney, and even the magistrate in charge of his case, who has a son on Ritalin and keeps espousing the benefits. The family already sees that the *benefit* of drugging those who learn differently is mostly derived by the school institution and not the child. Can any of you point me in the direction of substantive information or an attorney in Ohio who can assist these folks? TIA!<br/>

Wow.  I sure wish I could help.  I have two children with ADHD.  Adam was <br/>
first put on Ritalin in 1st grade, and it was awful.  He is one of those <br/>
children that the meds made a lot worse.  He was on 5 different medications <br/>
by the 6th grade,and had been hospitalized once for depression.  Now that he <br/>
is homeschooled, he is off all medication and is doing wonderfully.   I would <br/>
suggest that this parent contact C.H.A.D.D.  They may even have a website, <br/>
but I&#39;m not sure.  They may be able to help him contact an attorney or <br/>
perhaps an advocate that could help him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686957327">I too have a son who has ADD. First he should check the state law. The school <br/>
cannot diagnose ADD or demand medication (of course they can make it very <br/>
miserable for parents and kids if you don&#39;t comply). He is absolutely correct <br/>
in not wanting his kids on Ridalin. No one really knows the long-term effects <br/>
of this drug yet. I know it does teach a child self-medication and thus opens <br/>
the door for later drug abuse, but so would not being understood by so many <br/>
adults. Schools are not willing to deal with the extra care needed to teach <br/>
an ADD child without Ridalin making them an automaton. The schools goal is to <br/>
have quiet children who follow the rules without ever stepping out of line, <br/>
requiring minimum care on the part of the staff. Make sure he does know, <br/>
however, that they will treat his children as &quot;bad&quot; kids, almost as if <br/>
Ridalin were the only way to validate the diagnosis of ADD. That of course, <br/>
can and will follow them on their school records. Let your friend know he has <br/>
support in Texas! Lori in TX</div>

&gt;&gt;What parent could, in good conscious, medicate their child daily like <br/>
&gt;that?<br/>
&gt;&gt; How can we know what the long term effects of such action will be?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I get the impression a significant number of people just haven&#39;t given <br/>
&gt;it a<br/>
&gt;lot of thought. They&#39;ve been raised to defer to &quot;experts&quot; including <br/>
&gt;teachers<br/>
&gt;and doctors, they may be feeling tremendously pressured from other <br/>
&gt;aspects<br/>
&gt;of their lives, and they tell themselves they&#39;re doing what&#39;s best. <br/>
&gt;When<br/>
&gt;junior comes back with more positive comments from his teacher and <br/>
&gt;maybe<br/>
&gt;better grades which are sometimes very subjective, their decision is<br/>
&gt;affirmed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What just blows me away, besides the whole creativity aspect, is that <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;seem to have labeled normal behavior among young males in particular <br/>
&gt;as a<br/>
&gt;disease and are treating them accordingly.  I can&#39;t begin to imagine <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;consequences of that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Of course, if the condition has been carefully diagnosed and <br/>
&gt;medication is<br/>
&gt;&gt;required as a small PART of a course of treatment, with the ultimte <br/>
&gt;goal to<br/>
&gt;&gt;get them functioning without it, that is definately a responsible <br/>
&gt;option.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s a different story and I&#39;m sure there are very conscientious <br/>
&gt;parents<br/>
&gt;who are taking this tack.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800360848">Regarding your comments below on your Ritalin paper....<br/>
Medications can act very differently in a child body vs. an adult body.<br/>
Perhaps what Ritalin does in an adult constitutes grounding pilots.<br/>
However,  what it does for a child with real ADD may be beneficial for some<br/>
period (perhaps even years).<br/>
To really diagnose ADD appropriately,  the child should probably be *at<br/>
least* 5.5 or 6 yo.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my comment on this discussion comes down to......realize it&#39;s<br/>
confusing out there.  I agree many innappropriate diagnostics are done - I<br/>
believe especially on the 3 - 5 year old crowd.  But many parents truly<br/>
struggle into the school age years with this issue.  They appropriately<br/>
seek,  try,  and trust their physician&#39;s advice - and thier own gut<br/>
instincts.  It&#39;s all on the parenting journey.....we don&#39;t have all the<br/>
answers,  but I think most on this list are sincerely doing their best - and<br/>
would be willing to change as *whatever is best* changes.<br/>

One of the things that has always bothered me about Ritalin is the &quot;try it <br/>
and see if it works&quot; line.  The version I have heard is that it won&#39;t have <br/>
the desired effect in kid&#39;s who don&#39;t have ADD/ADHD -- so if it doesn&#39;t fix <br/>
the problem after X months -- then the kid doesn&#39;t have ADD/ADHD and <br/>
something else needs to be done.  I don&#39;t have this problem with my kids and <br/>
I believe there are kids who really do need this med, but this cavalier <br/>
approach to experimenting on a particular kid has always frightened me.<br/>

reflective of the lack of any clinical standard for ADD. It&#39;s not like<br/>
there&#39;s a blood test or any other screening that can actually show the<br/>
presence of a disease.  The checklist that&#39;s used looks like a sick joke<br/>
especially since so many of the traits on it relate to gifted kids. I&#39;d<br/>
think all that would make doctors extremely cautious about prescribing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055991329">GO TANYA!  There is something called ADD and it is something that not only<br/>
needs meds but it needs diagonosing and support.<br/>
<br/>
and then there are schools and people who want to label kids that dont fit<br/>
into the system. these are 2 very different things. I assume the people who<br/>
were talking neg about meds were the ones in teh second group. an active<br/>
kids doesnt need meds!<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in this whole discussion cus we are in the process of<br/>
adopting a child between the ages of 4 and 8 and many of these childrens<br/>
are diagnosed with ADD, way too many for it to be a real problem. Most<br/>
likely they just dont fit the system and tell me who could if you were<br/>
taken away from your parents and probably abused.<br/>
