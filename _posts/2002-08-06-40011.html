 </span></blockquote> Children learn, not from schooling, but from living. And for them, living<br/>
means playing.<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I have a friend in Chicago, Bruce Thomas,<br/>
who runs an organization called The Children¹s Learning Project. After<br/>
extensive research and observation by both Bruce and others, they concluded<br/>
that what children need most of all is play, and what they need least is<br/>
schooling, especially the usual -- ³traditional² --  type that we adults<br/>
experienced.<br/>
<br/>
The more our activities resemble the practices and theories of regular<br/>
school, the less effective they are (educationally and/or otherwise); and<br/>
the more our children¹s, and our, activities resemble play (and leisure) the<br/>
more effective they are. Our kid seemed to know that instinctively, since<br/>
his favorite expression was Churchill¹s, ³I love learning, but I hate being<br/>
taught.²  <br/>
<br/>
Trust Your Kids. <br/>
<br/>
Luz and I were inspired by the writings of John Holt, The Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook by Grace Llewellen, Linda Dobson&#39;s books, Free At Last, by Daniel<br/>
Greenberg (Sudbury), and Mark Twain, ³Don¹t let your schooling get in the<br/>
way of your education.² Looks like the start of a Suggested Reading List --<br/>
does anyone else have suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
John Holt&#39;s books: Teach Your Own,  How Children Learn,  Escape From<br/>
Childhood,  Learning All The Time, Instead of Education,  Never Too Late,<br/>
Freedom and Beyond, How Children Fail, What Do I Do Monday? The<br/>
Underachieving School.<br/>
