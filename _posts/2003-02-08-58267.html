<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 7 Feb 2003, at  8:05pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733066264">I wanted to respond to this thread earlier.  But here is what our day was like today:<br/>
<br/>
The school kids had off (snow).<br/>
<br/>
The kids danced and practiced gymnastics while the other kids videotaped them and they used the video for feedback (and to show me after I got up).<br/>
<br/>
They made their own meals.  They went sledding, and went for a walk to the store.<br/>
<br/>
My son spent lots of time on the computer downloading music and videos.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters and their friend and I came up with a list of things they could do to earn some money.  By the time they were done, they cleaned the whole house. They are using the money to go to the movies. <br/>
<br/>
Tonight my son and youngest daughter had swim team practice.  Then my son went rollerskating with a great group of friends.  My middle daughter went to the movies with her friend, and she is sleeping over.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest and I went out to eat and made arrangements for her to have a friend over tomorrow night when I will take them to the movies.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is home now except my son.  I&quot;m waiting for him to call me to come get him from the roller rink.<br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711199131">We are all really busy this fall, which is a little exhausting, but some <br/>
really cool things. Beth has been working almost every day AND every night, <br/>
because she is down a staff member and can&#39;t hire until January. So she has to fill <br/>
in at meetings. We haven&#39;t had much time with her.<br/>
<br/>
My work, between church, where I&#39;m doing a challenging program (challenging <br/>
for me -- I hope it&#39;s mostly fun for the kids and adults involved), and <br/>
conference planning, is also very busy.<br/>
<br/>
Finally -- Julian. Well, I wish those people who stated that he&#39;d never be <br/>
able to follow-through or focus if he didn&#39;t have &quot;schooly&quot; things could see him <br/>
right now.  (Oh wait...that was his father! &gt;BEG&lt;)<br/>
<br/>
He practices guitar, hard, almost every day. He&#39;s working hard at finishing <br/>
his chain mail shirt so he can wear it to the Renaissance Faire on Saturday. He <br/>
has three or four books going right now.<br/>
<br/>
And he&#39;s taking a course at Harvard University Extension called Evolution and <br/>
Society.  Julian is 14, and the youngest in the class. He marvels that he&#39;s <br/>
one of the few people who talks much in the class, and has opted for staying <br/>
for the optional discussion/debate section afterwards. His first week his <br/>
homework was probably 150 pages of fairly dry, 19th Century Science and Religion <br/>
reading... and he completed and understood all of it. He&#39;s a bit nervous about <br/>
the papers he has to write, because he&#39;s never really done much writing -- <br/>
doesn&#39;t really like it. But he&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
We were laughing on the way home. When Julian was in school in the third <br/>
grade, his teachers wanted to refer him to Special Ed because his handwriting was <br/>
awful and he often wasn&#39;t engaged.  He said, &quot;And my handwriting STILL sucks, <br/>
but I&#39;m pretty engaged!&quot;<br/>
