<div id="ygrps-yiv-865268765">Well, when you think about it, which seems more normal:<br/>
<br/>
-30 kids with 1 adult chaperone in 1 classroom, raising their hands to use the restroom, never seeing kids outside of their 1 year age range except for during lunch (maybe), being seperated from siblings and family members, being isolated from the community<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
-an adult or two (or more) who really LOVE their child and are interested in them, taking them into the community to see how the world really works, communicating with persons much younger and much older, seeing how adults really make a living and forming strong sibling bonds<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a huge issue to you, in most communities there is at least one support group that can provide child interaction.  For the most part, however, I know my kids are fine when they run to me at the playground announcing that they have met a new friend!<br/>

It&#39;s really starting to bug me that so little value is placed on the <br/>
interaction within the family! When we&#39;re home, my kids interact with <br/>
each other, with dh and I, with family and friends on the phone...and <br/>
yet some people see it as just the same as locking them (separately, <br/>
lol) in a closet. <br/>

Often people are surprised that my girls enjoy each other so much.<br/>
<br/>
Fostering healthy sibling relationships is very important and can be very<br/>
rewarding to the kids.  My girls (8 and almost 10) are great friends to each<br/>
other and play together every day all day long.  (They share friends, so<br/>
even when they have friends over, they play together.)  It saddens me that<br/>
so many siblings don&#39;t get along or play with each other but it does take a<br/>
great amount of effort on the part of the parent to help them learn to work<br/>
things out and communicate, and many parents either don&#39;t want to do the<br/>
work it take to help the kids work things out in a positive way, aren&#39;t<br/>
capable of it, or think that sibling rivalry/fighting is normal.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My girls have the benefit of being close in age and sharing the same<br/>
interests.  That helps immensely in keeping their relationship positive.<br/>
But the biggest impact, I believe, is that I have always been right there<br/>
with them to help them put their frustrations into words and to help them<br/>
understand each other and sympathize with each other and find a solution to<br/>
their problems.  I know it&#39;s all worth the time and effort when I hear them<br/>
communicate with each other and work things out on their own.  They listen<br/>
to each other and bargain with each other to find a solution that makes them<br/>
both happy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330767236">UGH. I fully blame the pack mentality within the<br/>
government school system to be a major part of the<br/>
reasons why my brothers and I are not close. <br/>
<br/>
When Sarah had started kindergarten, she really got a<br/>
kick out of having a baby brother and a newborn<br/>
sister. It didn&#39;t take very long at all for her to<br/>
pick up on the viewpoint that siblings are supposed to<br/>
be an annoyance. Sadly, it took a little longer for<br/>
her to lose that attitude than it did for her to pick<br/>
it up!! <br/>
<br/>
I treasure when they are doing things together. Sarah<br/>
read to Logan for an hour and a half last night before<br/>
bedtime, going through every Dr Suess book more than<br/>
once, and some others as well. Every time I turned<br/>
around one of them was running to the bookshelf to<br/>
pull out more books. It was great! <br/>
<br/>
Right now Sarah, Logan and Megan are all curled up<br/>
together watching the YuGiOh movie on DVD. <br/>
