<div id="ygrps-yiv-532591004">My boys, now 14 and 12 have been taking music lessons at a music school since <br/>
they were 9 and 7.  The music school does weekly 30 min. private lessons, and <br/>
several 1 hour  weekly band lessons.  Lots of days to choose from on the <br/>
bands, and the kids go to the band that is on their level.  They also have <br/>
concerts, and a huge 4 day festival held over the Memorial Day weekend, in <br/>
which the kids compete against three other schools.  They also have specialty <br/>
bands in which the kids have to be either invited, or advanced enough to go <br/>
into.  There is also a competition at the festival called show band <br/>
competition, in which each of the four schools puts on a show, any of the <br/>
kids in the school can audition for the show but only the kids in show band <br/>
can play in the band that accompanies the show.  There is a band that teaches <br/>
the kids improv, they must learn the different scales and how to negotiate <br/>
them, this is jazz.  They also have rock combos where the teachers invite <br/>
advanced students to form a rock band and perform.  All of these things keep <br/>
the kids interested and eager to improve.  My eldest son plays the <br/>
synthesizer, electric guitar, and bass.  He has learned to do the sound board <br/>
for performances in and out of the school.  My youngest plays the electric <br/>
guitar and drums, he is also lead singer in the rock band they formed a year <br/>
ago.  At present, they have cut a demo CD and have played many independent <br/>
gigs.  They love the music, and plan to become professionals.  They have <br/>
their friends over nearly every weekend to jam.  They are also involved in a <br/>
budding jazz band that they formed on their on from their theory class, and <br/>
their teacher was so blown away with them that he wants to work with them to <br/>
gig out also.  <br/>
They have been doing this for five years, there were times when they didn&#39;t <br/>
want to practice, and there were times they wanted to quit.  We didn&#39;t let <br/>
them, we simply looked for other ways to make it more interesting, and in <br/>
some cases, let them change instruments.  But they did not loose the love of <br/>
music, and what they wanted to quit was the instrument, not the music. Now <br/>
they play them all, and play any type of music from rock to reggae, they have <br/>
experience in studio recording, live performing outside the sheltering arms <br/>
of the family and school, they can do sound board operation, sing and act, <br/>
Their social activities center around the school, they are there 5 and soon <br/>
to be 6 days a week, because I allow them to be in whatever bands or combos <br/>
they want.  Sounds like a unit study doesn&#39;t it?  LOL.  <br/>
I know this is long, but there are things that can be beneficial, even if <br/>
they are structured and you have to give them a push every now and then. If <br/>
they want the music, they need the leeway to find the instrument, that is the <br/>
thing, finding the right instrument and watch them take off<br/>
