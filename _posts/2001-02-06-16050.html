<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527915593">Hi,<br/>
Whenever I read a book or my children see a show depicting school I point <br/>
out that we have those same things at our house and they don&#39;t have to wait <br/>
for someone to decide how and when they will use them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762226873">I know absolutely nothing about raising triplet boys (or triplets at <br/>
all!!), but just last night we were at a function and my husband sat <br/>
next to a lady that told him she had 10yo triplet boys and three <br/>
other children ages 9, 8, & 7.  5 of her 6 children where at home <br/>
sick and couldn&#39;t attend but she started to tell him what it is like <br/>
for her to have so many 10 yo&#39;s and the others in school and what a <br/>
nightmare it is for her between homework and activities!  My husband <br/>
just lent a compassionate ear, but afterwards we discussed how <br/>
extremely difficult it would be to have so many children in public <br/>
school at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a neighbor that has a 9yo, 3yo and 1-1/2 yo triplets and <br/>
she has been asking me to pass along homeschooling info to her <br/>
because, just having the one in school right now and all the homework <br/>
and expectations, she can&#39;t even imagine what it would be like when <br/>
they all go.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and an observation from last night about perspectives:  A friend <br/>
was complaining about her morning routine with her three children <br/>
before going to school daily - they all have to wake up at 6am, have <br/>
breakfast, groom, etc., and it&#39;s a daily struggle.  I made a comment <br/>
about how there are many mornings in my house that by say, 10am, I <br/>
have to convince my children to eat breakfast and they complain about <br/>
that (having to put down what they are doing at the time) and I have <br/>
pointed out to them how different our schedule and morning complaints <br/>
would be if they were in school.  My friend said, &quot;Well, welcome to <br/>
the REAL WORLD!  What are they going to do when they HAVE to get up <br/>
very early?&quot;  I just replied, &quot;I live in the REAL WORLD, and my life <br/>
is what and how I&#39;ve made it.&quot;  It&#39;s all a matter of what we see the <br/>
REAL WORLD as.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and power to you in all of the decision you&#39;ll have to make <br/>
for your boys with homeschooling/unschooling and beyond!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98910827">My neighbours children came over to play today and her girl pointed at a book <br/>
my girls had left on the floor and said that she&#39;d seen it on the shelf of <br/>
her school library but had never been allowed to take it down as it wasn&#39;t <br/>
for her age group!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling boys or girls is a lot more fun than schooling!<br/>
