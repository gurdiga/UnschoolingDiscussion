<div id="ygrps-yiv-993087842">ran a program this evening on unschooling and I caught just the last <br/>
couple minutes.  It was the Think Out Loud program and so I went to the <br/>
website.  I&#39;m finding on their message board that a lot of responses <br/>
from &quot;unschoolers&quot; are not describing unschooling as I know it.  But if <br/>
you click on the highlighted word &#39;advocates&#39; in the opb text you get <br/>
Sandra&#39;s website homepage, which is nice ;-)  I haven&#39;t felt like <br/>
responding myself yet.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329556304">I called in :) I can&#39;t wait to listen to the whole show, I missed Mary<br/>

were gonna be on...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I heard you!  Mary Gold wasn&#39;t on the show.  No other whole life<br/>
unschoolers were on.  It was really more the eclectic homeschoolers or<br/>
those that only unschool academics, but require chores etc.<br/>
<br/>
It was a little disappointing because they seemed to miss the whole darn<br/>
point of unschooling!</div>
