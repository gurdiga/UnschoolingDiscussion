They had a tribute article to him in one of my painting magazines.<br/>

&gt;Hi all, this is kind of OT, but does anyone know the name of the PBS artist<br/>
&gt;with the curly hair? He is the one who is always painting a &quot;happy&quot; bush or<br/>
&gt;tree.... LOL My DD loves to watch him, but I can&#39;t remember his name and I<br/>
&gt;need the info for an article I am writing on TV and kids.<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;Teri<br/>

still run his program though, it is fascinating.<br/>
