<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964601306">Hi there!  Went away for the weekend and I read through a few digests <br/>
and concluded I just couldn&#39;t fairly read them all.<br/>
I did read some more great ideas for &#39;getting started&#39;.  Harriet loves <br/>
puzzles and I just realized we really only own one.  Gotta fix that.<br/>
