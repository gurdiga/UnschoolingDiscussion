<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127296710"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Kevin is very sick, but he is stable.  He&#39;s sleeping now while getting a <br/>
&gt;&gt;blood transfusion, so I thought I&#39;d distract myself from hovering and <br/>
&gt;&gt;worrying.  &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh Debbie I hope he&#39;s doing better by the time you read this. I&#39;ll be <br/>
thinking about you all and sending healing thoughts your way. (That&#39;s as <br/>
close as I come to praying.)<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
