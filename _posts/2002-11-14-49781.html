<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771318092">When I was a child my best friend Diane and I thought this very <br/>
thing, so we set about to remedy the situation by composing our VERY <br/>
OWN ode to Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
So in the spirit of the upcoming holiday season I&#39;ve decided to share <br/>
this gem with all of you. It has become a standard around our house <br/>
on Turkey Day. As you enjoy this little ditty please remember... <br/>
WE WERE JUST KIDS!!!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;HENRY THE BEAK-SQUEAKIN&#39; TURKEY&quot;<br/>
(sung to the tune of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Henry the Beak-Squeakin&#39; turkey<br/>
  had a very squeaky beak.<br/>
And if you ever heard it, you would say it REALLY squeaked!<br/>
All of the other turkeys<br/>
  gobble-gobbed and called him names.<br/>
They never let poor Henry play in any turkey games!<br/>
Then one quiet Thanksgiving the Pilgrims came to say...<br/>
&quot;Henry with your beak that squeaks, won&#39;t you be our dinner feast?&quot;<br/>
Then how the Pilgrims stuffed him!<br/>
With apples, pears, and things like that.<br/>
Henry the Beak-Squeakin&#39; Turkey<br/>
  don&#39;t know how you lived through that!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome.  Beth</div>
