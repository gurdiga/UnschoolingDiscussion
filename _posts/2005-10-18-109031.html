<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560368728">All those years of schooling have me at a loss, somethings come easy <br/>
as far as speaking math but I&#39;m stuck with fractions and percent <br/>
conversion.  How can I speak 3/4 as a percent in ways that the kids <br/>
can understand?  Truly other than saying it&#39;s the same as .75 cents <br/>
or 75% I don&#39;t know how to speak this, or is that all that matters?  <br/>
This morning Brooke and I played &quot;tic-tac-toe&quot; down at the park on <br/>
the game board and I was showing her that 5/9ths of the squares <br/>
were &quot;O&#39;s&quot; (after our game) however, when it came to putting 5/9ths <br/>
into a percent I didn&#39;t say anything because I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
speak that without being confusing.  &quot;I&quot; only know how to do it on <br/>
paper to break it down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying so hard to incorporate unschooling into our daily lives <br/>
by speaking like I&#39;ve never done.  I AM learning plants and animals <br/>
and trees so that when I see those things my children here me say, <br/>
for instance, &quot;Wow, look at all that Saw Palmetto&quot; or &quot;That Sand <br/>
Pine sure is tall isn&#39;t it?&quot;  I see the beauty in speaking like that <br/>
but when it comes to the math, my brain is stuck on the pencil and <br/>
paper trail.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>

It&#39;s 75 cents, not .75 cents, anyway. &lt;g&gt;   &quot;Cents&quot; is already in hundredths.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to tell them.   They&#39;ll figure it out using money and seeing <br/>
video game timers counting them down and playing neopets where they get a <br/>
certain number of neopoints per game points (different games are different--my <br/>
current favorite gives 20% of the points you earn, so it takes 2500 game points to <br/>
get 500 neopoints).<br/>

That could cause her to avoid tic-tac-toe.   Don&#39;t turn things into math <br/>
lessons.<br/>

Speak like you would if there had never been any such thing as school then.<br/>

I don&#39;t see the beauty in it.   <br/>
Would you speak to an adult friend that way?<br/>
<br/>
Treat them like people, not like students.<br/>

The first link is to an article on what unschooling doesn&#39;t look like, and <br/>
the second is to a page with links to LOTS of typical days (but days worth <br/>
writing about).   I think that will help you lots.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t try so hard! :-) Just make the information available when it&#39;s  <br/>
natural so they can see the patterns. When they&#39;re ready, they&#39;ll get  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just like when they were infants and toddlers. You spoke in  <br/>
complete sentences to them even though you knew they didn&#39;t  <br/>
understand all the words and wouldn&#39;t understand for many years.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know a little about horses and I&#39;ll say appaloosa or palomino  <br/>
rather than horse if I see one. But it will help you get unschooling  <br/>
faster not to equate the memorization of the names of all that&#39;s  <br/>
around them with learning. It looks impressive to relatives but it  <br/>
isn&#39;t the same as understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Richard Feynman, the physicist, said that his grandfather told him  <br/>
that someone could memorize the names of all the birds and still  <br/>
known nothing about birds. That is, if they changed all the birds&#39;  <br/>
names, the memorizer would know nothing! But observing the behavior  <br/>
of birds -- if that interests someone -- asking questions about why  <br/>
they do as they do, is real learning.<br/>
<br/>
Kids do that naturally. They&#39;re always observing and (sometimes  <br/>
silently) asking questions, wondering why. Bouncing on a trampoline  <br/>
and coming to know instinctively that bouncing at an angle will send  <br/>
you off at an angle is real learning. When a child who has done. or  <br/>
played pool or bounced balls or played sports, later takes physics  <br/>
and reads &quot;Angle of incidence equals angle of reflection&quot; they&#39;ll  <br/>
understand that with their whole bodies :-) But the real learning  <br/>
wasn&#39;t in reading the scientific principle but in experiencing how  <br/>
things work.<br/>
<br/>
Relax. Lead rich lives and do things because they&#39;re fun! :-) The  <br/>
learning will follow.<br/>
