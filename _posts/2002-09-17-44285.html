<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632686643">Dear Michelle;<br/>
     Thank you so much for commenting on my post. I am new and had not read<br/>
about your son. I am lucky in that my husband shares my desire to unschool<br/>
and backs me 100%... no reservations. I cannot begin to imagine what this<br/>
has been like for you. Everyone&#39;s situation is different. For me it&#39;s been<br/>
about balancing my child&#39;s needs with the laws of SC, the BS the school<br/>
system puts you through, and DSS&#39; intrusions and threats and my own fears. I<br/>
am not Chris&#39; birth mother and that has added a world of problems that, just<br/>
like your situation, others do not have to face. DSS follows those of us who<br/>
are &quot;reproductively challenged&quot; &lt;GGG&gt; far more closely than others.<br/>
<br/>
    Keep your chin up and don&#39;t lose faith. Your children are lucky to have<br/>
a mom who loves them so much. And your husband will come around in time.<br/>
Take Care.<br/>
<br/>
Brightest Blessings,<br/>
           Virginia<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38243844">Hi Virginia,<br/>
Thank you for your comments as well...sounds as if Chris is blessed <br/>
to have you as a mom...I sympathize with your challenges.  It is not <br/>
an easy path we have chosen.  Just this morning I had an IEP meeting <br/>
with the school...brutal!  I hope that soon my husband will see <br/>
things more clearly.<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Michelle<br/>
