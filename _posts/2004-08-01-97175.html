 <br/>
Is it just the playing that bugs you?<br/>
 <br/>
Just so&#39;s ya&#39; know---you&#39;re not alone!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not a player. Ben loves it, I volunteer him all the time!  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
I HATE Barbies, playing with cars and tracks, making dinosaurs roar,  playing <br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh!---ALL that.<br/>
 <br/>
My strengths are &quot;playing&quot; in the kitchen, &quot;playing&quot; with words,  &quot;playing&quot; <br/>
with books, with movies, with crafts, etc. I have to admit, my &quot;play&quot;  involves <br/>
&quot;reality&quot;. I just can&#39;t get all-fired-up about the &quot;other&quot; kind of  play. <br/>
 <br/>
Oddly, I&#39;m a *nut* for other fantasy stuff, like Santa and fairies. I love  <br/>
parties and birthdays---any reason for a celebration and my party hat is  ON.<br/>
 <br/>
But &quot;play&quot;??? I just can&#39;t get into it.<br/>
 <br/>
So, you&#39;re not alone, Heather. Do your best at those things you *are*  good <br/>
at----in fact, get BETTER at them! Don&#39;t get mad and pouty because of the  <br/>
things you&#39;re not good at. The children will understand. And they&#39;ll find  someone <br/>
who *will* do those things with them.<br/>
 <br/>
Playing IS important---especially in an unschooling life. But play at what  <br/>
you&#39;re good at! Hire out the other stuff! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou Kelly!!!!!!!!!  I so needed to read this. And<br/>
while I will still make an effort to play Barbies from time to time, I&#39;m not<br/>
going to live with mountains of guilt at offering to bake some cookies or<br/>
paint a picture instead.<br/>

I don&#39;t much like bumper cars anymore though they used to be a favourite, I figure it&#39;s the same idea. I drive the real thing now so the thrill&#39;s gone.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I second this, wholeheartedly.<br/>
<br/>
I was never what I used to call a &quot;sandbox mommy.&quot;  And I felt really guilty<br/>
about it for a LONG time.  I just couldnn&#39;t bring myself to get down on the<br/>
floor very much and play imaginary games with the kids.  I consoled myself<br/>
that I loved reading with them, and cooking with them, and a bunch of other<br/>
things, but I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that I should have done more.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that this has come up now, because just last week my 19 yo dd was<br/>
reminiscing about her childhood, and went on and on about how much fun they<br/>
had with me -- going to the library on the bus, just because (we didn&#39;t have<br/>
to -- but we live in a large urban area with good public transport, and it<br/>
was a change of pace) and getting an ice cream cone before the ride home,<br/>
picnics and kite flying, sandcastle &quot;competitions&quot; at the beach, fountain<br/>
&quot;safaris&quot; where we searched out different fountains in the urban landscape<br/>
and dabbled our feet and took lots of pictures, and so forth.  I know I had<br/>
a lot of fun when they were little, and apparently they did too, despite the<br/>
fact that I hated Barbies with a hidden passion.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the point, I think.  Do what you love with your kids, and that will<br/>
be more than enough.<br/>

************************************<br/>
This is sure me too.  I even got to a point where I couldn&#39;t stand to read <br/>
fiction, because I felt life is too short, there&#39;s too much &quot;real&quot; interesting <br/>
stuff out there I want to read before I die!  (I HAVE learned to pop in fiction <br/>
books on tape (don&#39;t feel I&#39;m wasting so much time as I can cook/clean at the <br/>
same time).   I liked the other post about bumper cars too...what is the <br/>
point?  We get to drive the real thing, and pfft!...it&#39;s not that fun!<br/>
<br/>
Today we went to the park and they had a bunch of big stuff to play on (they <br/>
actually still had one of those metal merry-go-round type things we&#39;d injure <br/>
ourselves on when I was little, and a lot of old, metal stuff...not <br/>
wooden...imagine that!).  I had a real good, fun time.  I laughed so much at my boys and <br/>
their cousin (16, 14, and 13) as they&#39;d try and think up new, crazy, <br/>
evil-keinevil type stuff to do on everything, like jumping ONTO the merry-go-round <br/>
(ouch) and off of the swings at full speed.  I even swung too, and pushed the <br/>
merry-go-round as fast as I could while they laughed their heads off.  Definately <br/>
a day to remember!<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of going with what you&#39;re good at, and making the best of <br/>
that.  I can get the kids started at playing with something, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>
spend more than 10 minutes with barbies or trucks :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve touched on a pet peeve  here. :) I used to have people who would come into the bookstore who proudly told me they never read fiction. My response was a quote from somewhere, &quot;Non-fiction has the facts but fiction holds the truth&quot;. A good history book can tell you lots about WW11 Germany but Jerry Kosinski&#39;s The Painted Bird will take you inside and shake you up like nothing else. That all said I&#39;ve been devoured historical stuff lately and ignoring my fiction shelves.:)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I know I had<br/>
a lot of fun when they were little, and apparently they did too, despite the<br/>
fact that I hated Barbies with a hidden passion.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t play Barbies, but I aid and abet Barbie play.   Just last week I <br/>
brought in an upholstered chair for Barbie.  It was a homemade wooden chair, made <br/>
of little lumber scraps and &quot;upholstered&quot; with glued on drapery material.  <br/>
Pretty, but hard as a 2x4.  Barbie doesn&#39;t care.   I wrapped it in tissue paper, <br/>
put &quot;Barbie&quot; on it, and stuck it back in &quot;Barbieland.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Barbieland is an under-stairs closet big enough for kids, not big enough for <br/>
adults, which already had shelves and a light when we moved here.   Holly was <br/>
six, and because of my experience with Kirby&#39;s Ninja Turtle figures and their <br/>
tiny weapons and pizza slices, I knew life would be better for Holly if we <br/>
didn&#39;t have to negotiate Barbie&#39;s shoes and pizza slices, and if I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
check the vacuum cleaner bag, so we gave her that space and she never had to <br/>
clean up Barbie stuff.<br/>
<br/>
At first it was a floor covered with clothes and parts of stuff, with naked <br/>
barbies and kens and Kelly dolls on the shelves.    A couple of times I paid an <br/>
older girl $5 to organize it  some.  They had fun, and Holly was thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Now, six years later, the shelf sections are various Barbie rooms, some with <br/>
rugs or carpets, and wall decorations, and the clothes are in little Barbie <br/>
closets and drawers, the cars and boats are parked in the back corner (the <br/>
stairs make a u-turn, so under the landing is the main room where the light is, and <br/>
parking and storage are  under the short end of the stairs) and nobody&#39;s <br/>
naked.<br/>
<br/>
So although I have rarely held a doll and wiggled it and talked, I have often <br/>
made sure Holly had a guest, the time, and the space to play Barbies.  She <br/>
has something scheduled for this Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s the point, I think.  Do what you love with your kids, and that will<br/>
be more than enough. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
IF...<br/>
It&#39;s more than enough if it&#39;s enough.<br/>
<br/>
Some moms might take that as permission to assume the kids will find their <br/>
own entertainment.   I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good plan for unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
Moms of kids in school have assumed that the kids will get art at school, so <br/>
they don&#39;t need to have art supplies; that the kids will get music at school, <br/>
so they don&#39;t need to provide any musical enrichment; that the kids will have <br/>
a globe at school and maps, so they don&#39;t need to have globes and maps, and so <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all know moms who seem to assume kids will play with all their <br/>
friends at school and so they don&#39;t need to invite kids over, or let their kids <br/>
go play.  They seem to think that making them do homework, watch TV for some <br/>
measured hour or two, bathe and sleep is all they have to do to be good parents. <br/>
 And society will back them up.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers need to provide opportunities for anything they think might be <br/>
important or helpful or necessary. And that&#39;s a lot of responsibility.    Play <br/>
is part of that.  The parents don&#39;t have to play everything their kids want to, <br/>
but they need to import other kids who will, then.   If a kid has a <br/>
two-player video game and the parents can&#39;t or won&#39;t find him a gaming buddy, the <br/>
parent ought to learn to play it.  It&#39;s as cruel as another cruel thing I&#39;ve seen, <br/>
which is buying kids a board game and then declining to play it with them.<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes it&#39;s not enough, and most parents could probably stand to do <br/>
more.  At least boost the flow of other people through their kids&#39; lives.<br/>
