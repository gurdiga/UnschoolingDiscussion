<div id="ygrps-yiv-164891731">Did anyone catch the Sunday New York Times op-ed piece Jan. 16 on what it <br/>
means to be an educated person?<br/>
<br/>
The author argued that an educated person is one who is capable of the <br/>
logical thought required of a jury member in a modern-day trial.<br/>
<br/>
He said that today&#39;s citizens need deductive reasoning, the ability to <br/>
comprehend complicated laws, and the mathematical ability to understand <br/>
large money transactions, compound interest, DNA evidence, and probability.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the public schools often fall short of equipping kids with these <br/>
kinds of mental resources. I wonder if my family and I are doing much <br/>
better, though, without a structured program that attempts to address them.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel that our democracy needs thinking citizens that are capable of <br/>
figuring out what the politicians, ad people and CEOs are really up to.<br/>
<br/>
I think where we tend to fall short (schools and, possibly, homeschoolers) <br/>
is in the mathematics area. Too many people can&#39;t &quot;do that math&quot; for <br/>
themselve and they end up hoodwinked.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else worry about equipping their kids to be capable citizens, <br/>
and what do you do to address it?<br/>

<br>Yes, every day I worry about it! &nbsp;We are taking one day at a time basically. &nbsp;
<br>My oldest is 8 and thankfully he loves math so not only is it easy to teach 
<br>him the basics but I have also begun teaching him in &quot;real life&quot; instances as 
<br>well. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>The one that comes to mind is figuring out a tip. &nbsp;We will go together, just 
<br>my ds8, to a luncheonette while his sister is in dance and I will let him 
<br>figure the tip. &nbsp;10% of the total bill times 2.
<br>
<br>I think teaching good calculator skills (to older kids) is important too. &nbsp;
<br>This way even if they can&#39;t figure it out on paper themselves they have a way 
<br>to check bank interest etc. Exposure to everyday math needs is the important 
<br>thing I guess. 
<br>
<br>I guess the fact that we worry about it will help make sure we prepare them 
<br>better than we were prepared by our parents! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Well, that&#39;s just my 2 cents!

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know what, these days I worry about being a capable citizen.  Some<br/>
issues are so intricate that it&#39;s hard to unravel what the priority should<br/>
be.  Some of the most important information we need to be capable citizens<br/>
are kept from us and we are intentionally distracted by a complict media<br/>
industry.  My frustration level on certain topics is reaching an all time<br/>
high.  I&#39;m becoming cynical enough that I&#39;m really no help in devising<br/>
solutions, or even just holding discussions on those topics.  My children<br/>
ask me about voting and I tell them what?  How do I explain a Jewish enclave<br/>
in Florida somehow voting for Buchanan?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not even sure I can define capable citizen. &lt;sort of a grin&gt;<br/>

<br>Well, I think about it. &nbsp;I think that my kids see/hear their parents talking 
<br>about things in the news and they have gotten/will get our take on politics, 
<br>etc. &nbsp;I also watch the news. &nbsp;I know half the stuff would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; 
<br>in any other setting -- but things come up and get discussed -- earthquakes 
<br>and wars and criminals, etc. &nbsp;Then we spin things our way -- I think we all 
<br>do that -- maybe that&#39;s a good thing. &nbsp;The Presidential election was actually 
<br>educational in our house.
<br>
<br>My 6 yo daughter explained to me: &nbsp;&quot;Mom, I know you always tell us to pay 
<br>attention to what&#39;s going on in the world but I know you&#39;ve also told us this 
<br>is not how elections usually end up.&quot; &nbsp;Something got through. &nbsp;At least she&#39;s 
<br>thinking.
<br>
<br>Money-- they get some -- they spend it. &nbsp;Then they don&#39;t have it anymore. &nbsp;
<br>Then they have to decide if the thing they bought was worth it. &nbsp;We talk 
<br>about it beforehand but some things seem to be learned best by actually 
<br>buying the piece of junk and seeing it break.
<br>
<br>Wide horizons -- a world view and not just a sense that all there is to the 
<br>world is our little town in Florida. &nbsp;That people are extremely diverse. &nbsp;
<br>That money isn&#39;t everything. &nbsp;But it helps pay the bills. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Etc.
<br>
<br>I hope some of these things and others will get through but I don&#39;t know how 
<br>you could sit down and &quot;teach&quot; these important life lessons. &nbsp;
