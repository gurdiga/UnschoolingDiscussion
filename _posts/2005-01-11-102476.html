&gt;I am wondering if there are any<br/>
&gt;members who live in New Hampshire ? I<br/>
&gt;am relocating to there from<br/>
&gt;Massachusetts. I would appreiate any<br/>
&gt;information anyone would have to<br/>
&gt;offer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>

&gt;You have no idea how excited I was to see somebody mention New Hampshire. <br/>
&gt;Unfortunately Sonya, I have no information that could help you as I have <br/>
&gt;just recently decided to unschool my son and have not gotten all of the <br/>
&gt;information that I need. But now would be a great time for both of us to <br/>
&gt;get the information needed and see if we might be able to suport each <br/>
&gt;other.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, if anybody else is from NH and could throw a bit of fact our way, it <br/>
seems that we could really use it.<br/>
Sonya. good luck with your move.<br/>
