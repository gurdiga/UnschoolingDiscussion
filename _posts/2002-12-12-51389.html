<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would like some help, please:) I am still working on immediate family<br/>
&gt; members that believe school &quot;should look like school.&quot; They including my<br/>
&gt; older teen and 21 year old who are no longer in school, think I should<br/>
&gt; sit my two young sons down for atleast 2 hours a day and have them<br/>
&gt; write.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not in Vermont, Michele, so I can&#39;t address your concerns about your<br/>
state.  Maybe someone else can, or you can check with a group in your state.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m wondering if your elder children are having trouble with the<br/>
idea that Mom&#39;s changed.  They know what they had to do, and therefore their<br/>
younger siblings should have to do that, too.  Parents are supposed to stay<br/>
the same, so that they&#39;re predictable and boring.  Unpredictable parents are<br/>
disorienting, I think, to people whose lives are going through lots of<br/>
changes like your children probably are, growing into adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
It might help to talk to them more, read some of the things you read to<br/>
them, explain yourself, or maybe it would just be easier to ignore them.<br/>
Unless they do what you do, it&#39;s pretty hard for them to tell you how to do<br/>
it.  (People here do what you do and we have a hard enough time taking<br/>
advice from each other!)<br/>
