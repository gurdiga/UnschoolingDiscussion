 </span></blockquote>I disagree!  I think it&#39;s vital for my cats&#39; mental health and physical <br/>
fitness that they go out!!  And to keep them in for their own safety, <br/>
well, it really isn&#39;t my fault if other people drive so fast that they <br/>
can&#39;t see or avoid a cat in the road, and my cats can defend <br/>
themselves against other cats, which are their only non-human <br/>
foes in this area, unless you count foxes which I don&#39;t think would <br/>
be that into fighting cats.<br/>
<br/>
Takes all sorts, I know :-)<br/>

Aint that the truth?  Actually, I saw the same show that was mentioned and I <br/>
got an entirely different message.  They were illustrating, through the <br/>
collection of carcasses, just how much the wildlife was being impacted.  <br/>
Guess it&#39;s an even better illustration of how two people can get different <br/>
messages from the same show.<br/>
