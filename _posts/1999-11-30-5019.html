&lt;&lt; OH yeah and I wanted to ask......<br/>
 My kids are sometimes up until 2 AM<br/>
 AM I alone! &gt;&gt;<br/>
    You are Definitely not alone here! We do not get up until 10 am, so <br/>
bedtime is REAL late. I do enjoy it though. I remember the mornings that the <br/>
children were up at 5 and wanted me to cook breakfast. Now they go to bed <br/>
around midnight, and dh and I go around 2. It is a sound 8 for me, the kids <br/>
get about 9, they gab until they pass out! LOL<br/>
