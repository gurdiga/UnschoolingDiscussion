<br/>
&gt;Back when I was asking about chess books, some wonderful person from here<br/>
&gt;recommneded the Usborne Guide to Advanced Chess.  (I had a computer <br/>
&gt;clean-up<br/>
&gt;fit recently and deleted her email, unfortunately.)  But my books arrived<br/>
&gt;yesterday, and everybody here has scanned that one at least once.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;terrific, and just what we needed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks so much, and I&#39;m sorry I forgot who you were!<br/>

That was me!  I am so glad that you are enjoying the chess book.  My son has <br/>
taken back the stack of chess books back to the library for now, so he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have any more recommendations at the moment.  We&#39;ve been really busy <br/>
with summer stuff, and he&#39;ll get back into chess in the fall probably (or <br/>
not!)<br/>
