<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146107702">What will happen if you let tenagers sleep quietly until noon?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what happened here today.<br/>
<br/>
I was being extra quiet.  I moved a hose from the backyard faucet to avoid <br/>
running water under Marty&#39;s window.  He&#39;s 15.<br/>
<br/>
At 10:45 I heard Kirby (17) get in the shower.  I knew he had to open the <br/>
shop at 11:30.<br/>
<br/>
I was outside pulling weeds when I saw Kirby go downstairs in the house.  I <br/>
wondered what he was doing because all his clothes are clean and put away in <br/>
his room, so he wasn&#39;t going to borrow socks from his dad.<br/>
<br/>
He came around the side of the house with two Hansons sodas, which came from <br/>
the garage. He had them to take to work with him.  I asked him if the garage <br/>
door was unplugged (which my husband sometimes does if he&#39;s working right near <br/>
the door).  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby said, &quot;No, I just didn&#39;t want to open it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is someone sleeping up there?&quot; (above the garage, I meant, thinking maybe <br/>
one of his gaming buddies stayed over)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, but Marty&#39;s sick and Holly&#39;s still asleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WELL! <br/>
Well cool.<br/>
He was just going along with my more-quiet-than-usual noise level.<br/>
