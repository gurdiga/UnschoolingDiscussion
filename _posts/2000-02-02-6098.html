<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;cut&gt; everyone seemed fine.  Our discussions over the<br/>
&gt; years have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for them<br/>
&gt; even though they adjusted okay.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, already I have become faintly aware of this. Our 12yo who has wanted for<br/>
always to move to the country, started exhibiting strange behaviour, and it<br/>
emerged that although he loves living here, he was still going through a major<br/>
grieving for all that has been his life until now, and has been left behind. The<br/>
2 that weren&#39;t that keen on moving seem almost to be handling it better -<br/>
perhaps their low expectations enabled them to be pleasantly surprised!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>
&gt; plans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>
&gt; choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do feel bad about this - children have so little choice really, in so many<br/>
areas of their lives. Even when we, as individual families, allow our children<br/>
choice, they soon become aware that other families don&#39;t work like that, and<br/>
that their choice is only theirs by virtue of our choice to allow it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>
&gt; attachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow children<br/>
&gt; so well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>
&gt; draining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, and I&#39;ve never been to good at balancing - I always did choose the swing<br/>
rather than the seesaw at the playground &lt;g&gt;<br/>
