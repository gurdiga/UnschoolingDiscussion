<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948540590">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for some pointers.<br/>
<br/>
We are planning a driving trip down to South Carolina.   We live in Minnesota.<br/>
<br/>
We have quite a few days to site see on the way, but we are trying to figure out where and what we want to spend our time on.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get together with anyone who is on the way if anyone is interested.   Our route will probably take us from Minneapolis - Chicago - Indianapolis - Louisville -  then some way to Atlanta (my dh has an aunt there)  then to Columbia.<br/>
<br/>
I really need some help on our Chicago stay,  Elizabeth?    We want to see Sue the dinosaur,  and I&#39;m a little worried about getting lost in downtown Chicago.   I&#39;ll google the Field Museum,  for sure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Only 66 days until we leave,  wahoo!!<br/>
<br/>

    A few years ago the boys and I really enjoyed the Center of Science and<br/>
Industry. The Childrens Museum was pretty good. The Navy pier is right there<br/>
too so that was interesting. Chicago has so many places to see. We didn&#39;t<br/>
get to the Feild Museum. I&#39;d like to go there sometime. Maybe this fall.<br/>
Hummm...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>you know what my mom and I used to do? Not for many years, but would <br/>
like to do again. We would find really cheap airfare and fly to <br/>
Chicago early in the morning, get a around the town bus pass and <br/>
visit museums, shop a little, eat, and fly home the same night. It <br/>
would take us no time to get there and two hours to get home LOL(the <br/>
timezone difference of an hour with an hour flight) we did this in <br/>
oct 95 and march 97. It was so much fun!<br/>
