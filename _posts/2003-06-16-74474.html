<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323787584">Last night the kids and I were flipping through the channels, and we ran <br/>
across a 1/2 hour show called &#39;How it works&quot; (can&#39;t remember what channel).  It <br/>
takes different &quot;things&quot; and just explains how they work.  Really cool.<br/>
<br/>
But then we ran across a REALLY good documentary on the Discovery Channel <br/>
about cavemen, narrated by Alec Baldwin.  It was so cool because he started at <br/>
the species furthest from us and proceeded up the line, showing each skull, the <br/>
differences from ours and from the species before it and after it (in the <br/>
scheme of evolution) then there&#39;d be a reinactment of what scientists believe each <br/>
group looked like, acted, what they ate, relationships, etc.  Only bad thing <br/>
about the whole show was the commercials!  LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, it got me to thinking I&#39;d like to know of any favorite, <br/>
quality, &quot;educational&quot; (or not) channels and especially shows your families enjoy <br/>
and really get something out of.  I believed for a long time that a TV was <br/>
almost an enemy of homeschoolers, but for the last year have realized how many <br/>
possibilities it has!!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have cable or satellite.  We get seven or eight channels, and have <br/>
lots of videos, DVDS, a Netflix membership and a Hollywood Video a few hundred <br/>
yards out the back door.<br/>
<br/>
Our family gets something out of almost everything they see and do.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, Kirby and Marty are at the gaming shop, and then going to play <br/>
video games or watch wrestling or something at a friend&#39;s house.  Earlier <br/>
Marty was watching The Simpsons.   At the moment, Holly&#39;s watching The Pirates of <br/>
Penzance (which I put on for noise and singalong potential), in the next <br/>
room.  Keith is in the back watching Everwood.  Before that he was working on <br/>
carved crosspiece for a bench he&#39;s making.<br/>
<br/>
Simpsons is a big favorite here.  &quot;Friends&quot; re-runs are on a lot,  PBS kids&#39; <br/>
shows (I watched half of ZOOM today without Holly even being home),   Keith <br/>
just got the first season of Babylon 5 and has watched several of those <br/>
(Father&#39;s Day gift).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a single favorite radio station, but I know which songs I like.  <br/>
Sometimes channel surfing or skimming the listings is the best way to find <br/>
something unexpected (like the show on tree-ring dating of Viking ships we found <br/>
accidently).<br/>

You mean I&#39;m not the only one? &lt;g&gt;  I was taking a break from packing this <br/>
afternoon and caught a few minutes of Zaboomafu.  I came in during the <br/>
animal guessing game.  FIRST of all, I was singing along...THEN I found <br/>
myself shouting PUPPY!!!  When I turned around, I was the only one in the <br/>
room. &lt;sheepish grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I sing the Dragon Tales songs to myself all the time.  My favorite is the <br/>
Hello song.  It&#39;s been my packing buddy today.  My kids laugh at em all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was telling me that a few months ago he was taking a salon owner <br/>
to lunch for business and popped in a CD that had all our MP3&#39;s on it.  He <br/>
figured he&#39;d go light and play Enya.  After two songs this grainy song <br/>
started playing.  It took them both quite some time to figure out it was <br/>
Dragon Tales music I found on the internet!  He was incredibly embarrassed!  <br/>
He tracked to something else and again, after a few songs, We Are The World <br/>
started playing.  He said he took it out and turned on the radio.    <br/>
Evidently, he had copied ALL the MP3&#39;s from our computer, including those he <br/>
had downloaded for me and the kids!<br/>
<br/>
Totally off topic but a good run-off....<br/>
<br/>
He told me that in the middle of working on a job once, he turned to the guy <br/>
he was working with and told him he&#39;d be right back, he had to &#39;go potty&#39;!  <br/>
LOL!<br/>

very catchy!<br/>
  I just recently had a memory of watching a Gallagher special on Showtime as <br/>
a kid, and thought my almost-6yo would really get a kick out of him. (Anybody <br/>
remember Gallagher? He smashed watermelons, though most of his humor made you <br/>
think, sorta like George Carlin.) I ordered a video from half.com. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106335340">National Geographic channel - watched a special on places at extremes, coldest place in the world where people live, driest place, etc.<br/>
History  Channel - watched parts of 4-hour Russia special from Ivan the Terrible to Tsar Nicholas, very much an overview but fun<br/>
Weather Channel - watched Storm Stories on sailing races in Lake Michigan<br/>
<br/>
also like Junkyard Wars very much, don&#39;t remember the channel maybe TLC (the Learning Channel) or the Discovery Channel (now the Science Channel), all about making vehicle-like things from scraps in a junkyard (a British import)<br/>

Most of the channels we frequent have been mentioned, except for the Travel Channel.  They have quite a number of top ten shows that we really enjoy watching, from top ten parks for watching wildlife, to top ten attractions in various cities around the world, to the top ten roller coasters (my daughter is a roller coaster nut).  One of the funniest ones we ever watched was top ten bathrooms in the world!<br/>

Dammit, Sandra, you&#39;re not helping me justify cable/satellite as a learning <br/>
tool to my hubby, tho! We&#39;re in the same boat as you guys, just broadcast TV. <br/>
We&#39;re big Simpson&#39;s fans too, and I&#39;ve got a promise that when the 24 hour <br/>
Simpson&#39;s channel becomes a reality, we can get cable/satellite! lol  <br/>

We like the old Star Trek series because so many of the plot lines are<br/>
based on Shakespeare&#39;s plays.<br/>
We like Star Trek Next Generation because it&#39;s fun to compare the<br/>
changing social and political views from the 1960&#39;s to the 1980&#39;s.  It<br/>
can get a little preachy, but that was the theme of the show - the<br/>
betterment of humanity.<br/>
<br/>
We like Sunday night&#39;s silent films on TCM.   It&#39;s fun to think of<br/>
audiences full of people who just a few years before were watching live<br/>
plays with full color costumes and dialog and music, sitting in a silent<br/>
theater watching a black and white movie. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Toon Heads on the Cartoon Network, Sunday&#39;s...I forget the time.  It&#39;s<br/>
old cartoons with information about the director, and insight to the<br/>
inspiration for the story line and animation.  It&#39;s very interesting.  <br/>
There&#39;s a really fun one called Coo Coo Nut Grove, full of old movie and<br/>
musical stars. <br/>
<br/>
We watch old movies on any channel and like to notice the different hair<br/>
and clothing styles, furniture, architecture, use of language, etc. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>On either the &quot;Independant Film Channel&quot; or &quot;Sundance&quot;, we watched a modern <br/>
movie made in the way old movies were made in the 1920&#39;s.  It was SOOOO wierd, <br/>
but really cool.  They even used a really old camera, with a soft lens.  There <br/>
were long dramatic pauses, and LOTS of overacting...&quot;not realistic looking&quot; <br/>
sets on soundstages.  Darn, I wish I could remember the name....about 2 young <br/>
men living with their mother in the hills of germany or switzerland, who were <br/>
going to butler school...... (I said it was wierd didn&#39;t I?....)<br/>
