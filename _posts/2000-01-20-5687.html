<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344534478">this goes out to mary ellen...you mentioned in you<br/>
post from jan19/20 about using a co op preschool..<br/>
and said it was a good thing..<br/>
well that&#39;s right up my alley about now...my son age<br/>
2 3/4 just started moms and tots class, and just loves<br/>
it...He is already the oldest in this group..and the other moms<br/>
of the closest kids his age are already saying that their<br/>
kids will be going into preschool next Sept.<br/>
This of course leaves us alittle lost, since he has taken so well<br/>
to it (suprising to me)..So there are a bunch of co ops in my<br/>
area that I am looking into..that will hopefully do what this moms<br/>
and tots class does...lots of free play...circle time..songs..<br/>
snack...stories..ect...<br/>
my first visit with one is tomorrow..and then afew next week..<br/>
My husband wonders if this isn&#39;t defeating our purpose of unschooling<br/>
..and i&#39;m not sure i look at it this way...the idea isn&#39;t to put him<br/>
in an academic preschool (there are sooooooooo many here)...I just<br/>
want him to continue with something that he likes plus the added<br/>
benefit of being able to hold his own with other kids...and being <br/>
around other adults....<br/>
please let me know of your experience with the coop you used....<br/>
(ofcourse all this is speculation)....I have no idea what any of these<br/>
are like yet...<br/>
thanks,<br/>
Eileen</div>
