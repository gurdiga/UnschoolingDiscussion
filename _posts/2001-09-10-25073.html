<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044124484">If we are teaching our kids respect, shouldn&#39;t we also respect ourselves?<br/>
 Sometimes for peace and quiet I go shopping by myself.  At those times,<br/>
I say no when the kids ask to go with me.  It is my choice because it is<br/>
my body that I am taking to the store and because taking care of the kids<br/>
at the store would be my responsibility.  Part of learning about life is<br/>
learning that the answer to every request is not always yes.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s important to be honest.  If I don&#39;t want to take them and I say no,<br/>
but then changed my mind because they pleaded or something,  I might feel<br/>
coerced and resentful of my loss of peace.  So I say choice is coupled<br/>
with responsibility.  Whoever has the burden of responsibility is the one<br/>
who gets the choice.  If my children said they wanted to go to the store<br/>
ahead of time, so I could make a choice ahead of time and not last<br/>
minute, it would probably help, because then I could be planning on that<br/>
instead of planning on some peace and quiet.  Then I wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>
disappointed.  So then they are being considerate and learning people<br/>
skills.  Actually, I usually take them and am glad to because they are so<br/>
wonderful I hate being away from them.  What I&#39;m trying to say is,<br/>
sometimes the parent needs to think about his or her own needs first, and<br/>
the child&#39;s needs are secondary, because how can you care for your child<br/>
if you&#39;re not caring for yourself first?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s very important.<br/>
<br/>
But doing things we need to do for ourselves and our own health are separate<br/>
from the things we do to keep the family functioning, eg, meals, cleaning,<br/>
picking up dry cleaning, banking, errands.  Perhaps it&#39;s clearer to say that<br/>
sometimes a *person&#39;s* own needs override *other&#39;s* needs.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s when we place the way we choose to meet the family&#39;s needs over<br/>
the needs of people in the family is when we need to step back and question.<br/>
If we decide it&#39;s okay to inconvenience the kids for our needs -- and kids<br/>
*won&#39;t* see what we&#39;re doing (like making dinner) as selflish self-sacrifice<br/>
because they *do* recognize that we could choose to do things differently,<br/>
we *are* choosing -- then we shouldn&#39;t be surprised if the kids decide it&#39;s<br/>
okay to inconvenience us when they choose to meet their own needs.<br/>
