<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551545228">***It’s not so simple and straightforward as any one educational or<br/>
parenting or political theory would like people to believe.  But still, no<br/>
matter what else the parents believe or deny, the tone and mood they set<br/>
make a difference, for good or ill.***<br/>
<br/>
The chapter on adolescence especially stuck with me. I found hope in the<br/>
idea that the slow development of the prefrontal cortex in young people was<br/>
possibly a way to not saddle us primarily with our genetics. I wanted to be <br/>
able to feel slightly less guilt for<br/>
having passed on faulty genes. If development of the prefrontal cortex is<br/>
shaped by environment and experience, then what parents do, or don&#39;t do,<br/>
makes a difference. How you talk to, and about your child. How you talk to, <br/>
and about others. The choices you make to be honest, calm, rational, <br/>
reliable. All of that matters to the brain development of your child, and <br/>
how that child will live in the world.<br/>
<br/>
***It’s harder, I think, living in high-tech surroundings.  Flush toilets <br/>
are great, but the house isn’t as likely to break if there’s an outhouse.***<br/>
<br/>
When my son was born we were living in a cabin with no plumbing. When the <br/>
power went out for other people around us, as it often did in winter, <br/>
nothing about our lives changed. We still brought our water in from <br/>
elsewhere, we still had wood heat, we still had an outhouse.  We were used <br/>
to life that way. Our biggest challenge during a heavy snow wasn&#39;t the power <br/>
outages, but moose on the path to the outhouse. They were sometimes not that <br/>
enthusiastic about stepping out of our shoveled trail, back into the deep <br/>
snow. I could easily live that way again. If our son was *exactly* like me <br/>
he might not have hated that life if we had stayed. But, we left when he was <br/>
a baby, and it turned out that he&#39;s not exactly like me.<br/>
<br/>
There are problems when things go wrong, whether your flush toilet breaks, <br/>
or your outhouse roof gives way under the weight of snow. :) One hardship <br/>
might be in the expectation that everything will work the way it should, and <br/>
being caught off guard when it doesn&#39;t. Your TV probably will quit working <br/>
one day. A water pipe might break. Your computer could crash. The more <br/>
you&#39;re aware of how good things are when they are good, the easier it will <br/>
be to wade through the times when things are less good. If you&#39;re aware of <br/>
how lucky you are, everyday problems by comparison can seem smaller, and <br/>
more manageable. And being that kind of parent who can cope well in a <br/>
crisis, is good for your kids, too.<br/>
