<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438381492">Yes you all are right.  I was being judgmental.  I am sorry.  Thank you for setting me straight, I have helped her and she is getting help now.  I am now to far away to help.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;bad apple&quot; I was talking about was not the children.  I should have said bad example of unschooling.  Please don&#39;t get me for this.  I mean my hubby isn&#39;t at all interested in this style because of this family&#39;s problem.  He can&#39;t yet get past their problems which would effect any still of schooling, including ps.  I am looking for help to get him interested.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Candice for offering me some help in getting my hubby on the unschooling train.  By explaining that I want to do an &quot;assisted&quot; unschooling verse our friends unassisted unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Are there anyone else that has had a problem getting their spouse excited about unschooling?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. You&#39;re not alone in that situation. My husband was initially wary <br/>
of homeschooling until he saw the results. Then when I told him we were <br/>
phasing over to unschooling he thought I was crazy but acknowledged that I <br/>
was the one who had done the research and so I probably had more information <br/>
to make a good decision.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is easier for my husband because our oldest daughter is clearly <br/>
flourishing under this method of education. She also has chosen a very <br/>
academic path. He can see the value in almost all of her activities. While he <br/>
is still not comfortable with complete unschooling, he sees that she is well <br/>
beyond what she would be doing in a public or most private schools. He sees <br/>
that she is passionate about learning new things and is very well adjusted.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know any other unschooling families, so he has no examples, good or <br/>
bad, to look at. Perhaps your husband would be interested in reading some of <br/>
books about unschooling and its affects. Perhaps a subscription to Growing <br/>
Without Schooling may help. Maybe you could ask if he would be comfortable <br/>
unschooling on a trial basis, and reassessing at the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
What are his specific fears and concerns? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903648118">Dear Sher,<br/>
    I think you might be interested in the book, &quot;The Relaxed Home School: A <br/>
Family Production&quot; by Mary Hood. I hven&#39;t found any website for her but the <br/>
book is available through Amazon. -Amalia-</div>
