<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105154639">I need some advice on how to butt out of my oldest daughters life. She&#39;s making some choices that just don&#39;t sit well with me. I realize that will probably happen at least once with all my kids. And although this doesn&#39;t change the dynamics of what goes on here with the rest of us, it changes things for me. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a real hard time trying to understand why she&#39;s doing what she&#39;s doing. I&#39;m also disappointed.  I need to speak to her about what&#39;s going on and yet I don&#39;t want it to influence how I feel towards her. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll say things I shouldn&#39;t and then her and I will not be as we usually are with each other. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I would really like to know those of you with older kids, that see them make big time mistakes, what is for the best of them and the parent relationship? When do you just know to talk and when to shut up?<br/>
And then does that affect the two of you?<br/>

things didn&#39;t work out, the dad wasn&#39;t much of a person, etc. Of course I <br/>
was delighted to be a grandma, but I was definitely concerned about how it <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557251261">Let me ask this then. Do you think there is a difference when the offspring<br/>
in question is living at home or away? Would it make a difference to you as<br/>
far as what you say and how far you go if your daughter was living at home<br/>
and under 21?<br/>

It is hard Mary - but keeping that longer wider point of view - what <br/>
kind of relationship will this lead to - what kind of adult-to-adult <br/>
relationship will we have? That&#39;s what I keep thinking about - <br/>
constantly.<br/>

  What I have been doing with my son is I said once that whatever I say to him now does not mean he has to do it.  They are suggestions I am making that I conceive will make his life easier.  They are not a list of things to do.  I do the same with both older daughters.  So far I don&#39;t think it has hurt us badly.  Alot of things they know where I stand with, so we don&#39;t even have to bring that up unless they do.  In fact, most things I don&#39;t talk about until they bring it up. My second daughter is in a relationship with a man that is very hard to live with.  Occasionally I will interject with I don&#39;t know why you put up with that shit.  But it is not anything I wouldn&#39;t say to a friend either so I don&#39;t feel like I am going beyond boundaries.            Stepheny<br/>

they have at least a partial understanding of how the outcome could effect <br/>
their lives. There are things that I see long term negative effects and then <br/>
things which will just result in direct painful consequences today where they <br/>
might suffer some but not long term. The more serious the consequences the more I <br/>
might say.<br/>

trouble being able to detach so that I don&#39;t feel such intense pain when the <br/>
lesson is hard one. It&#39;s hard to see your kid hurting even when they brought it <br/>
on themselves and you tried to dissuade them from the path. Some people are <br/>
better at detaching than others. my mom was and even today she makes comments <br/>
that I care too much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282962641">Laura,  <br/>
    That&#39;s such a great way to put it. I&#39;ll have to remember that. Michael<br/>
(18) just got his licence and a car. This weekend he did call to tell me<br/>
where he was but he didn&#39;t let me know he would be gone all night. He<br/>
apologized. He somehow had his phone set up to block all calls. We talked.<br/>
He thought I was mad but I really wasn&#39;t, and told him so. Just concerned.<br/>
It was his first day out with that car alone. That phones my security when I<br/>
worry. <br/>
<br/>
    Today first day to drive to classes and he went to a friends after. I<br/>
called him to find out if he was coming home for dinner. This is going to<br/>
take some getting used to. We are both trying to be good natured about it.<br/>
He get wrapped up in his new found freedom and ability to see his friends. I<br/>
don&#39;t blame him. He had a plan to tell me if he spent the night tonight so I<br/>
know he has thought about my concerns. He even told me he loved me. That was<br/>
really great since I know his friends where right there. :-) I have to keep<br/>
remembering this sig line and keep working on my own anxieties.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Barb E<br/>
&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>
of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yes. AND - Mary - you KNOW your daughter knows what you&#39;d say about <br/>
it (whatever it is), right?<br/>
<br/>
So in a way its too late to say anything - they already really do know.<br/>
<br/>
ON the other hand, I think that the advice given above is a great way <br/>
to say it -- &quot;Sweetheart, you&#39;re an adult, but I&#39;m still your mom and <br/>
my mother&#39;s heart tells me that I need to talk to you about this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or &quot;Bear with me - you KNOW this is my job description...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OR -- start with the assumption she HAS thought it through, heard YOUR <br/>

Kirby&#39;s still on the youngish side for such considerations, but he&#39;s getting <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
What I say when I have the urge to advise is &quot;I&#39;m worried that...&quot; and say it <br/>
that way.   I&#39;m not asking him to change his plan because I&#39;m worried.  I&#39;m <br/>
partly fishing for reassurance, but I don&#39;t always get it.  I&#39;m partly wanting <br/>
to plant the seeds of reconsideration.   I&#39;m mostly gambling on earning an &quot;I <br/>
told you so&quot; if he decides I&#39;m right, but I&#39;ve learned never to cash in those <br/>
&quot;told you sos,&quot; but collect them as money in the bank.<br/>
<br/>
The more I&#39;m right, the more they trust me.  And I try to say very little.<br/>

Yes my daughter does indeed know what I think about the whole situation. I<br/>
have even gone in to her room and told her if she wants to just talk, I<br/>
promise I will just listen and not say anything. &lt;BG&gt; Yesterday I tried<br/>
again and she just doesn&#39;t want to talk about it. So I&#39;m not sure what she<br/>
thinks I know about and vice versa. I know better than to push with her.<br/>
<br/>
Finally yesterday we were in the kitchen and she asked what was wrong. I<br/>
told her I was worried about her and her decisions. She asked why and I told<br/>
her I didn&#39;t think she wanted to hear what I had to say. I still wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
what we both knew or were talking about. I have to go easy with her. So when<br/>
she said she wanted me to say it, I just told her I thought she was thinking<br/>
with her heart and not her head. At that point we both knew what was really<br/>
being said and just stopped. That was definitely the point of not pursuing<br/>
it because it would interfere with her and I.<br/>
<br/>
I just really wonder how some parents can just make such a break with<br/>
concern as soon as their kids turn the magic age of 18. I&#39;ll be like this<br/>
until the day I die. Hopefully better, but still concerned!<br/>

<br/>
When I made choices I knew were not great but the best I could do at the<br/>
time, or choices that would look bad on the outside (like getting pregnant<br/>
after about 1 month of dating a guy -sigh-) I would have done dances of joy<br/>
to hear someone say this to me.  To give me the credit that I *KNEW* what I<br/>
was doing, even if it was not the choice they would make.  To give me the<br/>
credit that I&#39;d *THOUGHT* about it.<br/>
<br/>
And then, when you&#39;ve heard their reasons you can offer other suggestions or<br/>
as &quot;Well, did you think of this idea?  Or was there already a reason you<br/>
chose not to do that one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Giving the person credit for having a brain goes a long way!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(And on that example above?  My mom kinda wigged when I told her.  Got<br/>
really upset.  She called me back the next day and said she was sorry.  Said<br/>
she was reacting emotionally but that getting unexpectantly pregnant at 26<br/>
in the 1990&#39;s was very different from doing it at 18 in the 1960s.  -smile-<br/>
As for how it turned out, we have been married 7.5 years, have 3 kids now<br/>
and still going strong.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could it be that those who appear to be able to make that break easily at 18 <br/>
never were connected to begin with?  I&#39;ve listened to several people tell me <br/>
when this one or that one is 18 they are out. However, I found when that day <br/>
came they found walking the walk a lot harder than talking the talk. (Which made <br/>
me glad) <br/>
<br/>
I also still contend that for parents with kids in school I think that often <br/>
it is the school (and peer pressure) that causes family rifts. The schools <br/>
pressure kids to perform but when they don&#39;t or won&#39;t the schools pressure the <br/>
parents to get the kids in line. Parents who are already stressed out just want <br/>
the kid to get back in line so the school will lay off of them. It&#39;s a viscous <br/>
cycle which often ends up with parents and kids angry at each other. I think <br/>
18 may be the magic age also because that is when school is finally over.<br/>

  Hey! I got pregnant after 1 month of seeing my boyfriend too! (I was 25):) We&#39;ve been married almost 6 years and have two kids. My mom was in Thailand at the time so I told her over the phone. She was very calm and said that she&#39;d had a feeling something was wrong. Looking back it wasn&#39;t wrong at all. <br/>

too. She never made &quot;a break&quot; with that kind of concern and now that I <br/>
have 19, 16, and almost 13 yo daughters, I know how much my mother had <br/>
to deal with and I&#39;m ever more impressed that she handled it so well -- <br/>
always available, never controlling... no power struggles, no &quot;I told <br/>
you so&#39;s&quot; -- amazing.<br/>

Well Kelly, I really needed to hear this. And I really need to remember it.<br/>
I guess that&#39;s half the problem now, me thinking that my daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>
have any brain cells left. I mean  I know what a wonderful, smart and great<br/>
kid she is, then she makes some off the wall decision and I wonder!! And<br/>
without saying it, I need to make sure I don&#39;t let her know I&#39;m thinking it.<br/>
Actions can speak louder than words sometimes. And I get to feeling so<br/>
frustrated right now thinking the smartest thing to do is right in front of<br/>
her face and she&#39;s still not choosing to see it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder.<br/>

Yeah I&#39;m sure that&#39;s it. Can&#39;t really think of any parent I know who had a<br/>
great relationship with their child and then just dumped the whole thing<br/>
when they turned 18 and the told them to get out on their own. With some<br/>
parents, it seems like something they are waiting for all the kids<br/>
childhood.<br/>

I will agree that it&#39;s much harder with school kids, at least for me, but I<br/>
would also think working at it harder would make a difference, even if<br/>
school is involved.<br/>

married life will be like and we didn&#39;t get to try any of those out without<br/>

I had a 5yros from a previous disaster marriage. (I was a very young mom but <br/>
DH is younger than me) I also got pregnant fairly quickly, we had been married  <br/>
7mos. Now the parents of 6 boys our baby is 12. I love being a mom but I do <br/>
look forward to trying out life with just the two of us.<br/>

I don&#39;t usually comment on typos, since it is obvious that you meant<br/>
&quot;vicious cycle&quot;, but on this occasion the accidental phrase conjured up<br/>
wonderful images - it seemed emotive of struggling through knee deep mud,<br/>

how school can prevent slipping through easily and quickly, ideas getting<br/>
