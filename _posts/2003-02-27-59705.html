<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132680132">**I hope this helps and as far as unschooling, I am not sure if this <br/>
qualifies-I know too little about the topic.**<br/>
<br/>
**Unschooling can be a many different things to many different people....that <br/>
is the beauty of thinking with your own mind.  **<br/>
<br/>
Both these statements were made by the same poster within 12 hours of each <br/>
other. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough time to really truly deeply understand the <br/>
concept so as to be undertaking to correct people who&#39;ve been unschooling for <br/>
years and spending much time talking and thinking and writing about the ideas <br/>
and concepts for many of those years.<br/>
