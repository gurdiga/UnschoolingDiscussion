As some of you may know, the Memorial Union suffered a fire about a<br/>
month ago.  Due to this fire, the conference had to be returned to our<br/>
original location from last year where everyone was happy to have good<br/>
parking and food options.  We will have a mingling room as well this<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
