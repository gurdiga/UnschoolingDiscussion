&lt;&lt; why do there have to be TERMS and definitions??!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s how language works.  Each word is a term and each has a definition.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;we were <br/>
manicured in school we didnt homeschool to  be repreimanded on line!!!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Manicured?  <br/>
<br/>
I know the term, and I know the definition, but I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s being <br/>
used here.<br/>
<br/>
The list is for discussing unschooling.  If I wanted to talk about repairing <br/>
old Dodge trucks, it would NOT help for someone to come on and say the <br/>
difference between a Dodge and a Chevy is just words, or that it shouldn&#39;t <br/>
matter whether people use one air filter or another.   To restore a Dodge <br/>
needs Dodge parts and specifications.  To unschool, you need an unschooling <br/>
philosophy and a vision of what successful unschooling looks like.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is whatever anyone wants it to be, we&#39;re trying to put <br/>
radiators in old VW Bugs and someone will be defending it.  &quot;LET HER PUT A <br/>
RADIATOR IN IF SHE WANTS TO.  IF SHE WANTS A RADIATOR LET HER HAVE ONE.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are terms, and definitions, and realities.  <br/>
How can we use English and discuss real things without those?<br/>

I don&#39;t see any bashing going on. I see debate, and free thinking, and<br/>
musing, and mindful thinking.<br/>
The interplay here is helping me to stretch and grow, to understand more<br/>
completely my thoughts and feelings on unschooling.<br/>
I love it. I hope it stays like this.<br/>
