<div id="ygrps-yiv-181369462">&lt;&lt;(...and for a Mom who has never been a 11yob!! &lt;g&gt;) Any personal<br/>
recommendations/favorites would be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks,&gt;&gt;<br/>

This recommendation is tangential, but I think it&#39;s valuable for understanding men/boys.  I LOVE &quot;Iron John&quot; by Robert Bly.  The process of migrating from Mom&#39;s world to Dad&#39;s is different for boys.  Girls don&#39;t have to migrate, eh.  The process has been ridiculed in the pop press as naked men dancing in woods to drums.  But it&#39;s &quot;more&quot; than that.<br/>
