<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646277078">I get out the paper making kit and tell the kids we will finally make<br/>
that paper today that I&#39;ve been talking about all summer.  This gets BIG<br/>
SMILES!  First we tear up the lintners.  Kids say, &quot;this is too hard&quot;.  I<br/>
help and Lisa grabs the scissors.  She notices how &quot;cottony&quot; the lintners<br/>
are.  We talk about what paper is made from and how it was once made from<br/>
papyrus.  Now the paper is torn, so we pour water on it and let it soak<br/>
while we go to Costco (taste samples, find out that mom won&#39;t buy the<br/>
juice with added sugar and that the bunk bed set that says kids under 6<br/>
aren&#39;t allowed on top really means that once the beds are at home parents<br/>
are allowed to make their own rules about who can go on top).<br/>
<br/>
Back home to the paper - decide that we should have torn it in smaller<br/>
pieces but we throw it in the blender anyway with some lovely orange<br/>
dryer lint that we&#39;ve been saving for a loooong time.  The kids decide to<br/>
play with their American Girl dolls while they are waiting for the paper<br/>
to blend.  The dolls are going on a campout so they all need sleeping<br/>
bags.  They use doll quilts for that.  Interesting conversation between<br/>
them and the dolls about what kind of food to bring for the campout.  The<br/>
paper mash doesn&#39;t look quite right but I continue anyway.  Pour the<br/>
slurry into the tub.  &quot;Look kids, I&#39;m going to make the paper now.&quot; <br/>
&quot;This stinks!&quot;  &quot;ooh, I don&#39;t want to put my hands in that!&quot;  OK, so I do<br/>
the first one.  Lisa decides to give it a try.  Makes one piece and goes<br/>
back to her dolls.  I do a few more.  Jackie tries one and enjoys<br/>
stirring up the water with her hands.  She proudly carries her piece of<br/>
paper outside to dry.  (98 degrees outside helps!)  Then she goes back to<br/>
the dolls.  I continue making paper, making occasional comments about<br/>
what I&#39;m doing and asking if anybody wants to do another one.  Nobody<br/>
does.  By the 11th sheet I&#39;m tired of it and have used up most of the<br/>
pulp.  Dump the rest of the slurry in the compost pile and clean up the<br/>
mess.<br/>
<br/>
We sit down to have a snack and study the piece that is almost dry.  Lisa<br/>
wonders how it will be to write on.<br/>
<br/>
Neighbor calls to say she is held up at work so can we meet her son at<br/>
the bus.  Bus is 10 minutes late, but we visit with another neighbor who<br/>
lives near the bus stop.  The 6th grader talks about how middle school is<br/>
soo hard and she will never survive it.  Mom comments on how much they<br/>
had to invest in art supplies.  Finally the bus arrives and my kids take<br/>
off to play with their friends.<br/>
<br/>
Is this unschooling?<br/>
