&gt;&gt; How can someone say &quot;censorship and unschooling cannot exist together&quot; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; not remember that having a relative or neighbor tell their kids &quot;If you<br/>
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; go to school you will never learn to read and never get a job&quot; is harmful<br/>
&gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; their process and their psyches?  Do you let your relatives say just<br/>
&gt;&gt; ANYTHING<br/>
&gt;&gt; to your children?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ahh! But I believe the readers are primarily ADULTS and very precocious<br/>
&gt; children, who don&#39;t need You Sandra to close doors for them!<br/>
<br/>

about things having nothing to do with unschooling, that people are begging<br/>
you to get over and move past, instead of contributing something useful to<br/>
the meat-of-unschooling threads here.<br/>

some friends after the trial was over (my apologies for the off-<br/>

<br/>
Pam<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello dear ones,<br/>
<br/>
Well. One hardly knows where to start!<br/>
<br/>
My jury duty lasted 7 weeks, ending last Friday, just in time for <br/>
me to feel festive for a few days, bury the house in a wash of <br/>
tissue paper and bows, and Get Through Christmas. Since <br/>
Christmas is, for me, a month-long softly glowing celebration of <br/>
tradition, baking and festooning everything including the cat with <br/>
ribbons, you can only imagine what Pam&#39;s Christmas-on-Fast-<br/>
Forward looked and felt like. Joyous like a Roller Coaster. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jury duty. Everyone whines about it, I spent the 7 weeks utterly <br/>
fascinated by the Shakespearean tragedy that had been <br/>
enacted. I wonder if all murder scenarios today were foretold by <br/>
the Bard? My 11 fellow jurors swore never to sit on another <br/>
murder case, I would again in a second.<br/>
<br/>
The play was written thus: Jake Silva, a jealous and abusive <br/>
boyfriend (just 18 years old); Renee Ramos, a &quot;cheating&quot; <br/>
girlfriend (just 18 years old); the stage is set in a small but <br/>
crime-ridden burg and the participants are all members of a <br/>
skateboarding and graffiti gang (first lesson learned: one does <br/>
not want one&#39;s children to cultivate the society of some to most <br/>
skateboarders. Who knew?) This gang-of-children had an older <br/>
&quot;friend&quot; (where &quot;friend&quot; is defined as &quot;pervert child molester&quot;) <br/>
who bought the alcohol for their frequent parties. The <br/>
skateboarding gang called themselves Grim Crew.<br/>
<br/>
The prosecutor was an angry veteran who obviously (and one <br/>
feels not unreasonably) takes every murder case deeply <br/>
personally. He was jovial and Columbo-like towards us jurors, <br/>
but turned red-faced and enraged to some witnesses (including <br/>
our defendant, on the stand for over 2 days during his defense <br/>
testimony). Some of the prosecutor&#39;s camp and anger was an <br/>
act, but it was an act based on him in reality -- he played up his <br/>
natural Columbo-like shenanigans, and waved his arms a bit <br/>
more than required in his rages, but it was, at the root, all him.<br/>
<br/>
The defense attorney I actually felt sorry for, where previously I <br/>
have had a great deal of contempt, at least at times, for the <br/>
species. Hers was a catastrophically difficult task, and I expect <br/>
most of her cases are. I am perhaps still naive, but I think the <br/>
legitimately not-guilty defendants are vastly outnumbered by the <br/>
legitimately guilty. Being a defense attorney seems to me like it <br/>
would be like coaching a perpetually-losing sports team. For all <br/>
that, she was talented. She and the prosecutor had an obvious <br/>
respect for each other. Objections and sidebars were few, <br/>
shouting between the attorneys non-existent.<br/>
<br/>
The witnesses often lied and often lost track of their lies. I filled <br/>
up 7 notebooks of notes on the trial, and I was not the most <br/>
prolific note-taker of the jurors. There was video testimony and <br/>
DNA evidence and false trails laid by the defense and leaps to <br/>
some facts by the prosecution.<br/>
<br/>
The jury was excellent. There was a great deal of common <br/>
sense and little folly. We guarded fiercely those amongst us who <br/>
could not help babbling about the case as they walked down the <br/>
court hallways. *** and *** were always escorted to lunch and <br/>
back by a pack of us, ready to turn the subject as necessary.<br/>
<br/>
The families both attended every day of the trial. We knew them <br/>
on sight and they knew us. The courtroom was like a horrific <br/>
parody of a wedding with the &quot;bride&#39;s&quot; side (the victim Renee&#39;s <br/>
family) and the &quot;groom&#39;s&quot; side (the accused murderer Jake&#39;s <br/>
family).<br/>
<br/>
Renee&#39;s mother was first on the stand, looking sad and very <br/>
tired. I imagine she has looked that way since her daughter was <br/>
murdered over 2 1/2 years ago. Various family members rotated <br/>
in and out in supporting her as the days went on -- Renee&#39;s <br/>
stepfather, Renee&#39;s grandmother, Renee&#39;s aunt.<br/>
<br/>
Jake&#39;s stepmother was there every day, with various supporters. <br/>
Jake&#39;s father was seldom in the courtroom -- one reason was <br/>
that he was a defense witness and could not be present until <br/>
after his testimony, but even after that he was mostly absent. He <br/>
is a small man, physically dwarfed by his young, strong son. He <br/>
looked bewildered, and his testimony was confused. He was too <br/>
honest to lie on the stand and too terrified for his son to tell the <br/>
truth. I felt even worse for him than I did for Renee&#39;s mother.<br/>
<br/>
The crime scene photos were as bad as you can imagine. <br/>
Renee was gang-raped and beaten and strangled, three <br/>
different strangulations with accompanying marks, including the <br/>
final strangulation that killed her. It was 2 to 5 days before they <br/>
found the body. The prosecution, in submitting photos to us on <br/>
the jury, arranged the order of one set to: Renee&#39;s school photo, <br/>
showing a pretty blond girl about a size 5. Then the four boy-men <br/>
and man implicated in her rape. Then the worst of the crime <br/>
scene photos of Renee. I wonder if the prosecution really <br/>
thought that anyone on our jury would not notice and resent the <br/>
tactic?<br/>
<br/>
In spite of the lying witnesses, in spite of the prosecution&#39;s heavy <br/>
hand, we went into the jury room knowing what had happened <br/>
without much to talk about. I was elected foreperson (yes, you <br/>
can all smile here, I know you never doubted it. :) We took a poll <br/>
on the most serious of the three counts, the murder, and came <br/>
to 11 guilty and one undecided.<br/>
<br/>
The undecided was ***, a young man who was the conscience <br/>
of the jury. I will be grateful to him forever for bringing up every <br/>
tiny possible doubt he had and making all of us carefully <br/>
examine it. By the time *** had finished with his last concern, and <br/>
had gone over with the rest of us the evidence that answered <br/>
each concern, we were a sad but resolute body.<br/>
<br/>
Jake Silva is now 20 years old. He has been in prison since a <br/>
few months after Renee&#39;s murder, when he was arrested, and <br/>
he will now be in prison for the rest of his life. Not one of us <br/>
enjoyed sending him there, but not one of us would do it <br/>
differently for the world.<br/>
<br/>
There were bright spots -- our judge liked us because we were <br/>
attentive, we liked him because he was so fair in the courtroom, <br/>
and looked after our comfort. Our main bailiff was the nicest man <br/>
in the world and fussed over us like a hen. I carpooled with <br/>
another juror, an 80-year-old world traveler who wanted to be a <br/>
race car driver in her youth. I closed my eyes a lot as we drove to <br/>
court each day. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad it&#39;s done.<br/>

<br/>
Seven weeks? Isn&#39;t that a bit long? Was it a special case or <br/>
something? (Or are you not allowed to talk about it?)<br/>
<br/>
Helen, who&#39;s somehow *never* been selected for jury duty, but is curious...</div>

two years!  I can&#39;t even imagine taking that long out of my life.<br/>

So you were making the 80 year old drive?<br/>
Was there a third in this carpool?<br/>
