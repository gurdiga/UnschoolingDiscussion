&gt; Tracy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds alright to me, sort of, Tracy - as long as everyone is receptive <br/>
and interested in what going on. What though, exactly, is &quot;normal <br/>
school-ish hierarchy&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
I saw recently a great article in &#39;Growing Without Schooling&#39; entitled: <br/>
Growing Without Education, by Aaron Falbel from Massachusettes. It&#39;s <br/>
about letting go of *education* - the whole mentality of *educating* <br/>
someone.  <br/>
<br/>
Certainly, someone &quot;hogging&quot; the trampoline for 25 minutes doesn&#39;t<br/>
fly if others are waiting....but it seems that so much stress is<br/>
put on educating the group for the goodness of the group - so much<br/>
to do with social politesse, that what is important - the individual <br/>
person - is lost.  Children are &quot;social&quot; like anyone else.  Seems to me <br/>
that purposely teaching so much politesse - instead of just living it <br/>
- puts children in an awkward position - particularly damaging to<br/>
very young children.  <br/>
<br/>
I think these group activities that go down so young interfere <br/>
enormously with play and discovery. We avoid it.  As a child <br/>
grows and comes to understand better language and reasoning - <br/>
certain politeness and consideration for others begins to make <br/>
some sense - and is grasped because it begins to make sense - - - <br/>
then again, maybe not - but that&#39;s not the point.  <br/>
<br/>
Forced sharing and such bugs me enormously. Where is the concern for <br/>
what it *means* to share - where it comes from? <br/>
<br/>
I saw the other night, Jacque Chirac - and a mother and a son - meeting<br/>
and shaking the French President&#39;s hand.  The mother presented President <br/>
Chirac with a piece of pottery that the young child had made.  The child<br/>
burst into tears and said he wanted to keep what he had made.  The mother<br/>
insisted the gift be given and so did Mr. Chirac as he took it and turned<br/>
away, *smiling*.  The child buried his face into the mother&#39;s dress, <br/>
sobbing. Where was the understanding  for *individual feelings* - this <br/>
*child&#39;s feelings?!*  And so Mr Chirac walked off, smiling, with <br/>
something of great importance to someone else. The giving (taking and<br/>
accepting) was more important than anything (anyone) else. It was <br/>
forbidden to fluff the feathers of such &quot;nice&quot; social customs.<br/>
<br/>
Coming back around to the importance of individuality and <br/>
selfness (opposed to &quot;selfishness&quot;): Individuality seems squashed <br/>
in these groups of children put together of the same age - put <br/>
together to do pretty much the same thing and to learn the same thing.  <br/>
I would find it a very special and rare program - one that respected <br/>
the *individual* child.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Educational&quot; or not, something usually still stinks.<br/>
My point is, don&#39;t be afraid to sniff a bit - and recognize a nasty <br/>
smell when you smell it - - -  and agree when a child makes a face <br/>
when he smells the same thing.<br/>
  <br/>
I prefer to be outside.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. You didn&#39;t have to turn away.  Why not speak up for the child?<br/>
A statement perhaps: &quot;She doesn&#39;t want to share right now.&quot;<br/>
&quot;She doesn&#39;t want to give the things she is using right now to others.<br/>
I can understand that perfectly.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Then you&#39;ll get the weird look.  Stay with it for the child&#39;s sake.<br/>
Whether or not the mother &quot;gets&quot; it - something has gone out there and <br/>
has her thinking now....<br/>
<br/>
And Mrs. or Dr. Better Share might then say:<br/>
&quot;What about *sharing*? It&#39;s important to *share*! She knows how to <br/>
share (most likely translation: I have forced her to before and she <br/>
did it - I&#39;ll leave the being &quot;good&quot; at it alone).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a good response might be:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think *respect* is extremely important - more important - *her* <br/>
sense of well being, including feeling alright about having things <br/>
(possessing things - another sticky subject for another post) and to <br/>
be able to continue on with using something if she chooses to - and <br/>
not to be forced to share with someone else because the <br/>
&quot;Good Mommy Show&quot; is on...<br/>
<br/>
(Well, think of the last sentence - don&#39;t say it...)<br/>
<br/>
And so she responds:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How will she ever *learn* to share if I don&#39;t teach her?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Patience. Observation. Believe it or not, I know of a little girl<br/>
who lives in France who was never told to say &quot;Please&quot; - never -<br/>
and she says it often  - because others use the word often with her <br/>
- and no one has ever set out to teach her something ***with the <br/>
assumption that there would ever be a &quot;problem&quot;***.  Sometimes the<br/>
little girl shares, too.  Sometimes, not, but her sense of what it<br/>
means to share comes from herself and is not imposed on her by someone<br/>
else. Her wishes are respected and backed up by her Mom.  This <br/>
preserves and nutures the girl&#39;s well being - her Self.  If she were <br/>
forced to do these things, the root of the whole idea of sharing would <br/>
be lost anyway - making it quite distasteful, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Gee, don&#39;t you think you are making a big deal out of this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is a big deal.  Those plastic veggies are a big deal to her and<br/>
when you force her to give them away, you are giving away and wearing<br/>
away the heart of her.&quot;  (This is a very interesting topic, I think:<br/>
all this crap that children and people have - and hoard - - - makes <br/>
perfect sense where all the trouble comes from.  I think it&#39;s a joke <br/>
the bags of plastic stuff that are lugged to the beach to play with.  <br/>
Isn&#39;t there enough great stuff already there?! And so the fights begin!<br/>
Share!)<br/>
<br/>
You could continue with something like:<br/>
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be a problem in the first place if people respected their <br/>
children&#39;s wishes rather than putting more importance on *ideas* such <br/>
as generosity and politeness - all those little social &quot;niceties&quot; that <br/>
grow too huge, stifling the life out of little people&#39;s play.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so it goes on like that - well, maybe not, if she is a therapist <br/>
and you have &quot;challenged&quot; her &quot;expertise&quot;.  No matter though, the <br/>
important thing is the child heard you - you spoke up for her - and the <br/>
mother now has your very important point of view in her mind. Don&#39;t be <br/>
quiet.  Speak up! Even if they think you&#39;re a fruitcake.  <br/>

<br/>
hi,<br/>
<br/>
i can completely relate with being full of doubt.  for me, i have very little<br/>
to draw on, other than that the way i was raised is not what i want for my kids<br/>
(i love my parents but child &#39;rear&#39; was not their forte:).   so for the first 4<br/>
years i kept a very low profile, keeping personal input to a minimum,  just to<br/>
get my bearings and &#39;try on&#39; being a mom without all the suggestions and<br/>
comments.  it wasn&#39;t until rene&#39; was nearly 4 (just last sept,) and i turned<br/>
40, that i felt i knew what made sense to me ( i got some philosophical base to<br/>
work and grow from) and we could weather all the opinions (spoken or thought, i<br/>
swear sometimes i can read minds, which drives my husband nuts:)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second, from organizing, I&#39;ve learned to &quot;start where people are&quot; (Saul<br/>
Alinsky), rather than tell them flat out where you think they should be.<br/>
That way, you lessen the risk that you&#39;ve lost people from the start by<br/>
making them marshal their defenses--you can help them build a bridge from<br/>
where they are to a potentially better place.  With confrontational<br/>
approach, although that gets a point &quot;out there&quot;, people&#39;s common response<br/>
is to push away.  Maybe just maybe they&#39;ll resentfully reconsider what you<br/>
say later on, but maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i agree and i was thinking that if you are concerned about making someone<br/>
defensive a possible option would be to try and not form an opinion about<br/>
what&#39;s happening, the mother may be less confident then it appears which could<br/>
push her to &#39;control&#39; her child - a sort of knee jerk reaction to live up to<br/>
someone else&#39;s expectation.  make comments as you had mentioned but also sit<br/>
down with the kids and play with them.  often the toy is only interesting<br/>
because another kid is having fun with it.  in my experience the fun is what<br/>
the kids want not the object.   it&#39;s just that they can&#39;t separate the 2<br/>
because at this young age that&#39;s the way life is, kind of an all or nothing<br/>
stance.  we attribute qualities such as greed, selfishness, and meanness to<br/>
little ones when in truth those are simply adult qualities, the kids are much<br/>
too spontaneous to have these kinds of feelings.   yes, they hit and get mad<br/>
and lots of other &#39;frustrating&#39; kinds of things but we do have to be careful<br/>
not to make them out to be so self-conscious, deliberate  and thought out.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s all so very organic and difficult because there are so many theories and<br/>
opinions but what i find that helped me and saved me from feeling like the<br/>
worst mom ever, was to have great compassion for myself and others (whether<br/>
they &#39;deserved&#39; it or not:) because by doing this i kind of forced myself to<br/>
accept the fact that i can&#39;t control really anything, not what others said, not<br/>
they way others raised their kids, nor my own son.  once i understood that he<br/>
had the right to develop and not be controlled, i realized his behavior was<br/>
merely a reflection of his relationship to the world and that that relationship<br/>
was facilitated not only by me but by his age and every other relationship he<br/>
had.  what i needed to do was to interpret what he was communication.   for<br/>
example,  we live next to a daycare and across the street from an elementary<br/>
school.   one day rene&#39; was stomping around (he was around 3) mad and said he<br/>
wanted to be a &#39;daycare kid&#39;, that he didn&#39;t want to be with me, he wanted to<br/>
be next door.   well this went on for sometime, i was really deeply hurt, so i<br/>
left him to &#39;play&#39; in the yard just to think, feel sorry for myself, beat<br/>
myself up, all that kind of thin, but then i realized that what he really want<br/>
was more one-on-one play, which he hadn&#39;t been getting because i had been very<br/>
sick (some weird autoimmune thing that hit me about 18 months before), and we<br/>
had allowed ourselves to get lost in survival mode and weren&#39;t having fun.   so<br/>
it wasn&#39;t that he wanted to be in daycare or that he hated me but this was the<br/>
best he could do to communicate that he was not happy and something needed to<br/>
change.  he was right, we changed and life&#39;s better for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
most popular views of children do not fully grasp or respect the native<br/>
intelligence of children and really focus on the &#39;model&#39; them theory,  but<br/>
respect, faith and observation are key.  the best part of parenting is<br/>
experiencing all the growth,  the worst part is that they have the uncanny<br/>
knack for magnifying all your weaknesses :0   don&#39;t let your doubt override<br/>
your natural good sense, but i think having the doubt now is a good thing<br/>
because you&#39;ll be ready for what&#39;s to come:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603161023">Hi Diane and all,<br/>
<br/>
Your reply to my reply prompted a lot of reflection for me.  First, just let<br/>
me say that my professional background is in social justice-oriented adult<br/>
literacy and I worked for several years in education and organizing along<br/>
these lines before having Annie and deciding to parent full-time.  That&#39;s<br/>
informing some of what I&#39;m going to say.<br/>
<br/>
But your reply also brought home to me that as a mother I&#39;m learning<br/>
*everything* anew, like my entire life before this just evaporated, with<br/>
only some occasional mistily-remembered shreds of the knowledge from my<br/>
&quot;past life&quot; coming in :).<br/>
<br/>
I *have* in the past advocated one-on-one in favor of breastfeeding with<br/>
soon-to-be-moms looking at formula just in stores or with new moms at malls<br/>
in the baby changing rooms--I think it&#39;s because after 27 mos I feel<br/>
comfortable in my experience of bfing that I can speak on it to others as<br/>
well as by modeling extended bfing.<br/>
<br/>
But this mothering thing, sheesh.  Annie&#39;s now entering the psychologically<br/>
challenging part of parenting (the part from after infancy until I die!) and<br/>
I feel like a complete novice every single day at it.  Since I am struggling<br/>
through reflecting and analyzing how I (and DH) want to raise Annie, when I<br/>
see other people&#39;s parenting practices I may disagree (vehemently) and thus<br/>
have renewed resolve in my own choices, but I don&#39;t yet feel the<br/>
inner--I-don&#39;t-know-what to step in educationally, for lack of a better<br/>
word, as I do with bfing issues.<br/>
<br/>
Second, from organizing, I&#39;ve learned to &quot;start where people are&quot; (Saul<br/>
Alinsky), rather than tell them flat out where you think they should be.<br/>
That way, you lessen the risk that you&#39;ve lost people from the start by<br/>

say later on, but maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No. You didn&#39;t have to turn away.  Why not speak up for the child?<br/>
&gt;A statement perhaps: &quot;She doesn&#39;t want to share right now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I should mention that I did say that.  I tried to give an understanding look<br/>
to the mother and said to her and to Annie, &quot;It&#39;s o.k., Juliet wants to keep<br/>
those particular toys to herself right now.  Let&#39;s go find something else.&quot;<br/>
But probably what I said sounded like veiled criticism to the mother,<br/>
because she didn&#39;t know where precisely I was coming from.<br/>
<br/>
I think on the basis of your suggestions, I can imagine in a future<br/>
situation trying to accomplish the same end as you&#39;re aiming for, but by<br/>
slightly different means.<br/>
<br/>
I *could* see trying to take the issue further by talking from my own<br/>
experience, about how we have thought about dealing with &quot;sharing&quot;, that<br/>
Annie doesn&#39;t have to give up anything just because someone else wants it,<br/>
etc. and trying to recognize the mother&#39;s embarrassment, however misplaced,<br/>
rather than point out her logical flaws.<br/>
<br/>
As an acquaintance who is a diversity trainer (strange phrase, but that&#39;s<br/>
what she calls it) said, &quot;There&#39;s a lot of fear&quot;.  She always tries to think<br/>
of people resisting change as afraid of something, and help them overcome<br/>
their fears, no matter how heinous they look once they evince themselves as<br/>
behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the shot in the arm. I really should integrate my past life with<br/>
this one, but I&#39;m so full of doubts and unsurenesses that I&#39;ve got my hands<br/>
full just trying to be a good mother to Annie!  And don&#39;t get me started on<br/>
the little girl&#39;s &quot;kennel cough&quot;, my name for the ubiquitous giveaway of<br/>
kids in daycare...<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday was one of those days (coinciding with my 46th birthday) where I <br/>
felt like the world&#39;s worst mother.  I, too, have been what I would call a <br/>
late bloomer and have only started coming into trusting my inner voice about <br/>
parenting in the past few years.  <br/>
<br/>
We are leaving snowless Michigan for a two week trip to Texas in a few hours. <br/>
 I wish you all a wonderful holiday.<br/>

&gt; That way, you lessen the risk that you&#39;ve lost people from the start by<br/>
&gt; making them marshal their defenses--you can help them build a bridge from<br/>
&gt; where they are to a potentially better place.  With confrontational<br/>
&gt; approach, although that gets a point &quot;out there&quot;, people&#39;s common response<br/>
&gt; is to push away.  Maybe just maybe they&#39;ll resentfully reconsider what you<br/>
&gt; say later on, but maybe not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;No. You didn&#39;t have to turn away.  Why not speak up for the child?<br/>
&gt; &gt;A statement perhaps: &quot;She doesn&#39;t want to share right now.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I should mention that I did say that.  I tried to give an understanding look<br/>
&gt; to the mother and said to her and to Annie, &quot;It&#39;s o.k., Juliet wants to keep<br/>
&gt; those particular toys to herself right now.  Let&#39;s go find something else.&quot;<br/>
&gt; But probably what I said sounded like veiled criticism to the mother,<br/>
&gt; because she didn&#39;t know where precisely I was coming from.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think on the basis of your suggestions, I can imagine in a future<br/>
&gt; situation trying to accomplish the same end as you&#39;re aiming for, but by<br/>
&gt; slightly different means.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I *could* see trying to take the issue further by talking from my own<br/>
&gt; experience, about how we have thought about dealing with &quot;sharing&quot;, that<br/>
&gt; Annie doesn&#39;t have to give up anything just because someone else wants it,<br/>
&gt; etc. and trying to recognize the mother&#39;s embarrassment, however misplaced,<br/>
&gt; rather than point out her logical flaws.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an acquaintance who is a diversity trainer (strange phrase, but that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what she calls it) said, &quot;There&#39;s a lot of fear&quot;.  She always tries to think<br/>
&gt; of people resisting change as afraid of something, and help them overcome<br/>
&gt; their fears, no matter how heinous they look once they evince themselves as<br/>
&gt; behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the shot in the arm. I really should integrate my past life with<br/>
&gt; this one, but I&#39;m so full of doubts and unsurenesses that I&#39;ve got my hands<br/>
&gt; full just trying to be a good mother to Annie!  And don&#39;t get me started on<br/>
&gt; the little girl&#39;s &quot;kennel cough&quot;, my name for the ubiquitous giveaway of<br/>
&gt; kids in daycare...<br/>

or respect?  That I was reflecting upon the dynamics and tactics of<br/>
interacting in these kinds of situations?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what your point is here.  In your first reply you wrote a quite<br/>
directive, extended imagined roleplay/dialogue with the mother and *only*<br/>
the mother.  So that must not have been about the children, right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-53047656">Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for replying.<br/>
<br/>
    (don&#39;t know why this line is appearing on the left side--sorry for the distraction)<br/>
<br/>
    You wrote:<br/>
<br/>
    the mother may be less confident then it appears which could push her to &#39;control&#39; her child - a sort of knee jerk reaction to live up to someone else&#39;s expectation.  <br/>
<br/>
    Oh yeah.  I&#39;ve seen this so often at Gymboree or other places where mothers try to force their children to do things because they think everyone else is doing it, etc.  I also think that in this case, since both parents were child psychologist/therapists that they really wanted to have their kid be &quot;perfect&quot;.  OY OY OY.<br/>
<br/>
    make comments as you had mentioned but also sit down with the kids and play with them.  often the toy is only interesting because another kid is having fun with it.  in my experience the fun is what the kids want not the object.  <br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;m guessing you mean play in general, not play to find a way to make them give up their toys!  :)  Yes, we did that too.  I&#39;m one of those mothers who&#39;s down playing with kids at playdates, who&#39;s with my kid at a playground--not stifling her (I hope), but there if she wants me, involved and playing too.  It&#39;s kind of sad sometimes, because other kids start talking to me and showing me what they can do, etc.  while their mothers are off chatting and it feels to me that they&#39;d really like *their* mothers to be there to see the same things.  (just a side note)<br/>
<br/>
    You then wrote:<br/>
<br/>
    yes, they hit and get mad and lots of other &#39;frustrating&#39; kinds of things but we do have to be careful not to make them out to be so self-conscious, deliberate  and thought out. <br/>
<br/>
    A man at our Ethical culture meeting recently told a story about how he found a little boy throwing rocks at a squirrel in a tree.  He was internally appalled but then he asked the little boy *why* he was doing it. The boy replied &quot;so I can get the squirrel to come down and I can take care of him and have him as a pet.&quot;  Man.  That story has stayed with me.  I always try to ask Annie (even at her age--I hope that it will rub off) what she&#39;s trying to do when something happens that surprises me.<br/>
<br/>
    You continued:<br/>
<br/>
    what i find that helped me and saved me from feeling like the worst mom ever, was to have great compassion for myself and others (whether they &#39;deserved&#39; it or not:) because by doing this i kind of forced myself to accept the fact that i can&#39;t control really anything, not what others said, not they way others raised their kids, nor my own son.  once i understood that he had the right to develop and not be controlled, i realized his behavior was merely a reflection of his relationship to the world and that that relationship was facilitated not only by me but by his age and every other relationship he had.  what i needed to do was to interpret what he was communication.<br/>
<br/>
    This end-part sounds kind of like the ethical culture story...but I&#39;d really appreciate it if you would say more on &quot;his behavior was a reflection of his relationship to the world&quot;, either on- or off-list.<br/>
<br/>
    one day rene&#39; was stomping around (he was around 3) mad and said he wanted to be a &#39;daycare kid&#39;, that he didn&#39;t want to be with me, he wanted to be next door.   (snip)<br/>
<br/>
     this was the best he could do to communicate that he was not happy and something needed to change.  he was right, we changed and life&#39;s better for all of us. <br/>
<br/>
    That&#39;s a very instructive story, especially in the health-situation I&#39;m in right now. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
    respect, faith and observation are key.  the best part of parenting is experiencing all the growth,  the worst part is that they have the uncanny knack for magnifying all your weaknesses :0   don&#39;t let your doubt override your natural good sense, but i think having the doubt now is a good thing because you&#39;ll be ready for what&#39;s to come:) <br/>
<br/>
    Your lips to God&#39;s ears! (or nature&#39;s ears, or whatever...:)<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for your thoughts...<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it is about children but it is the *mother* who was controlling the<br/>
daughter and who was prompting her to share when the child clearly did <br/>
not want to.  The information that the child is alright in feeling<br/>
this way is important for the mother to know.   <br/>
<br/>
I thought there were excellent suggestions about affirming the<br/>
child&#39;s wishes - to the child as well.  I&#39;ve spoken to a child this<br/>
way - and this seems to be a more delicate and gracious approach.<br/>
The mother in the story is very important, though.  My thoughts were <br/>
to offer up the child&#39;s position in a positive light. Certainly, <br/>
this may not be easy - but my point is, we owe it to children to speak <br/>
up.  Some mothers do not realize that it is ok for their children to <br/>
have and not focus constantly on giving so much up.  Certainly, too, <br/>
no one wants to insult any mother.I offered up the conversation <br/>
between two mothers to show that it is about the *issue* at hand - <br/>
and not about offending anyone&#39;s mothering.  I just wanted to say,<br/>
go ahead and say a feeling for the child&#39;s sake if you feel there is <br/>
an injustice going down.<br/>
