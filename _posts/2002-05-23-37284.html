<div id="ygrps-yiv-867965326">Well, I love our uniqueness, but it has nothing to do with whether we <br/>
do or don&#39;t watch TV.  It is a sum of all that we do and the fact that <br/>
the TV is part of it just adds another layer of depth.  I listened to <br/>
Wyndham tell someone that some current movie or TV show (I forget <br/>
which) was going to have Black Adder&#39;s dumb friend in it.  I could <br/>
tell that the person he was talking to had no clue who or what Black <br/>

In England the guy who plays Baldrick is WAY popular--has another show or two <br/>
of his own.    In the U.S. we pretty much only know him from Black Adder, but <br/>
Rowan Atkinson is well known: Mr. Bean (another BBC comedy) has been on some <br/>
PBS stations, and there was the movie, and him doing the voice in Lion King <br/>
(Zazu? the bird).  I&#39;ve heard they don&#39;t care nearly as much in the U.K. for <br/>
Rowan Atkinson as they do for the other guy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can see both sides of this one.  I think it has to do with the fact that <br/>
TV programs get popular and then &quot;everyone&quot; watches those shows and knows <br/>
what they&#39;re about.  That doesn&#39;t happen so much with books.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t watch TV.  I don&#39;t take pride in it, though I used to before I <br/>
started reading this list.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
We got a TV and cable a couple of months ago.  Before that, dh and ds used <br/>
to go next door and watch the in-law&#39;s second TV all the time.  In fact, <br/>
the reason I agreed to get a TV at all was because I realized that it was <br/>
the only way I was going to get some family life.  (I don&#39;t regret it at <br/>
all, by the way.)  Since we got the TV, I&#39;ve been checking listings, seeing <br/>
what I might want to watch.  Once in a while, something sparks my interest <br/>
a bit, and I think I&#39;ll watch it.  But when the time comes, there&#39;s usually <br/>
something else I&#39;d rather do.  (Even reading e-mail)  &lt;g&gt;    I know there <br/>
are probably shows out there that I&#39;d like if I found them, but it just <br/>
seems like too much trouble.  On the other hand, I know there *are* books <br/>
I&#39;ll like, because I&#39;ve already found so many of them in my life.  My <br/>
personal experience tells me that I&#39;m more likely to find a book I like <br/>
than a TV show.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but it&#39;s still seen as &quot;cute&quot; to not be able to do simple math,<br/>
especially if you&#39;re a woman. Whereas not reading is seen as shameful...<br/>
imagine asking your dinner partner for help reading the menu, and asking<br/>
him for help figuring a tip. No one over 10 has ever asked me for the<br/>
former, but many adults have asked me for the latter. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m personally in the &quot;drop the last digit, divide that answer in half<br/>
and add to itself&quot; camp, but doubling the tax works equally well in most<br/>
areas where I&#39;ve lived. It&#39;s a ballpark thing, after all..<br/>

but I can think of many that have math anxiety.  I&#39;m one of them.  <br/>
When I ask for help figuring a tip, it&#39;s not because I&#39;m trying to <br/>
look cute, it&#39;s because I really do want help.  Actually, for me, it&#39;s <br/>
not figuring the tip that bothers me, it&#39;s figuring who owes what if <br/>
I&#39;ve gone to dinner with a bunch of friends and we need to add a tip <br/>
and then divide the whole thing among, say, seven people.<br/>
It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t do it, it&#39;s that I hate to do it and feel <br/>
genuine anxiety when I have to.<br/>
Math was also my most feared/hated subject in school as a child, and <br/>
it had nothing to do with looking cute then either.<br/>

&gt; this <br/>
&gt; way about tv and not about books.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was just having a conversation about books vs. television with my friend <br/>
yesterday. There was a book, Night John, that children were supposed to read <br/>
and report on for a grade (at the school where I worked) However, the book <br/>
contained graphic (of course we all have an imagination) content. The <br/>
teachers didn&#39;t find that there was anything wrong with this and one teacher <br/>
proceeded to tell me, &quot;at least they are not watching it on television!&quot; What <br/>
difference is that the child reads &quot;bad&quot; content on pages as opposed to <br/>
seeing it on television. Either way there is going to be a mental picture <br/>
that the child has conjured up or a visual from the child watching <br/>
television. <br/>
<br/>
I would have to say that I don&#39;t agree with all things, but like I said <br/>
before...I am easy to get along with. <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of things that deem to provide an educational experience for <br/>
our children. Though some things are inappropriate for children, depending on <br/>
their maturity and the feeling of the parent.<br/>
<br/>
My sister has a 9 year old who watches some of everything. When she takes my <br/>
children to the movies I have to tell her what they are allowed to watch and <br/>
what they are not allowed to watch. She doesn&#39;t agree with me on some things, <br/>
but that is absolutely okay.<br/>
<br/>
There are learning experiences around us everyday, some choose to allow <br/>
television to be an integral part of it all, while others choose to use other <br/>
learning directives. It is all okay, why? Because we are parents that have <br/>
different beliefs, yet we can all come together with a common goal, to <br/>
homeschool our children and offer them something different as opposed to the <br/>
norm. We have all decided to step out of the box and open new doors for our <br/>
families. Doors that lead us into different directions, yet when we look back <br/>
at the friendships we&#39;ve made, we all had one common goal...our children and <br/>
their well being.<br/>
<br/>
I said all that to say...that is why I really love this board. I have <br/>
witnessed a &quot;tiny bit&quot; of nastiness, but hey...this is the real world right?! <br/>
I have seen a lot of caring on this board as well...it is a well kept <br/>
balance. It is so good to be able to share your feelings and your concerns <br/>
without being torn apart at a whim. Yet it is also good to get some honest <br/>
feedback from other individuals who have &quot;just about&quot; the same commonality <br/>
that you do.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, thank you so much for being the moderator that you are. I have been on <br/>
other boards before and the moderator is neither here nor there. There is so <br/>
much confusion going on. You apparently have kept your head above water and <br/>
you are doing a wonderful job. <br/>
<br/>
Okay...enough of that...back to unschooling :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny...how you explained that. Only if I thought I looked cute while <br/>
appearing like the biggest idiot in the world! It is funny, when I am around <br/>
other people it is hard for me to focus on math, so anxiety sets in and I <br/>
become the dummy in the room because I can&#39;t stop thinking about what they <br/>
are going to say if I get this problem wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I only took Algebra in High School and don&#39;t remember most of it because I <br/>
haven&#39;t refreshed myself. I will be taking classes at the college next <br/>
semester to finish my pre-algebra units. My 13 year old is moving at such a <br/>
fast pace that he has to take the college courses in math only because I am a <br/>
nutcase when it comes to it. I won&#39;t be able to assist him. This summer he <br/>
will finish his introductory class to Geometry, August he will be taking <br/>
Algebra I, January he will be taking Algebra II, there is no way he will be <br/>
getting any help from me. IN fact he thinks it is funny to come to me and <br/>
say, &quot;hey mom?! I can tutor you for a small fee! LOL  In fact, he is rather <br/>
happy that I am going to be in class with him. As long as I don&#39;t act like <br/>
his mother...sorry, kid, God put me in charge of your life 24/7 :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No - I don&#39;t think AT ALL that most people who have math anxiety and fear and <br/>
admit to not &quot;getting&quot; math are TRYING to be cute or attractive or anything <br/>
like that. In fact, for most people with math anxiety it is the cause of some <br/>
level, large or small, of background discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
But - it is still true that many CONSIDER it cute and attractive. And, it is <br/>
just interesting that in this culture it is totally cool to say &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>
balance my checkbook&quot; but it is horribly shamefully humiliating if it is <br/>
found out that someone can&#39;t read.<br/>

WAY more than I am. She makes a lot of rules and believes that ever making an <br/>
exception will start them on an instant downward spiral.  Her kids are great <br/>
- nice and happy and we all get along fine. The only problem we really have <br/>
ever had is that her 7 yo has been asking her to skip school to do things <br/>
with the &quot;park kids&quot; -- by which he means homeschoolers -- because sometimes <br/>
he comes to our park days when he&#39;s on vacation from his school. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
get why he can&#39;t skip school, too &lt;BEG&gt;. (I don&#39;t think he gets it that the <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now this is funny! Park kids :) I remember when we lived in Arkansas, there <br/>
was this lovely family that lived next door to us. Well, my children were all <br/>
going to school at the time (homeschooled them later on) and they wondered <br/>
why these little kids were always outside early in the morning in their <br/>
pj&#39;s...don&#39;t they go to school too? Well, they would be outside checking the <br/>
morning temp for their science experiments to find the average temp over a <br/>
week...which is a really good experiment. I had to explain to the kids that <br/>
they were going to school too, they just weren&#39;t getting on the bus. if you <br/>
can imagine, after that they hated school. They wanted to do what their <br/>
friends were doing. My oldest son says to me, &quot;I want to check the temparture <br/>
too!&quot; After that I began my homeschooling. My boys absolutely loved it and <br/>
they loved being able to &quot;miss school&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the sister note: I am much more restrictive than my sister is. Yet when s<br/>
he comes over she tries to make it seem as though I should allow my children <br/>
to watch a certain movie because after all they watched another movie that <br/>
had some of the same content. Well, my babies watching a move where someone <br/>
is kicking, or cursing doesn&#39;t mean that they should be exposed to a girl <br/>
with a thong on or a guy walking around in a G string. Two different <br/>
scenarios here. I can&#39;t seem to get this point across to her. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in screening movies before your family watches <br/>
them...a good site... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com">http://www.screenit.com</a><br/>
<br/>
This site is excellent, it tells you the number of profanity words, it tells <br/>
you (in depth) the sexual content of the movie, the imitative behavior...it <br/>
is just really good. I use it all of the time. <br/>

First of all, please don&#39;t take my post as being offensive. I am merely going <br/>
to post my thought on the whole thing. Okay?! :)<br/>
<br/>
You would rather let your child watch a movie with &quot;graphic sex scenes&quot; <br/>
(porn) than gratuitous violence...well I don&#39;t call a movie that has a couple <br/>
of punches that lend a bloody lip gratuitous violence. Neither do I see a <br/>
kick that violent either. But graphic sex scenes...that is a little more than <br/>
&quot;I&quot; care to explain. I guess that is the reason why I say no. When your child <br/>
watches these types of movies, do you explain to them why the man does what <br/>
he does and why the woman does what she does? I would have a REALLY HARD TIME <br/>
trying to explain sexually graphic material. <br/>
<br/>
And again honey, you know as well as I do that everyone has their level of <br/>
belief. So, thanks for allowing me to share.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think &quot;cute and attractive&quot; may not be a choice of words that some <br/>
understand, unless paired with a phrase like &quot;socially acceptable&quot;. Reading <br/>
illiteracy is not attractive, because it is frowned upon. It is the <br/>
foundation for all other education and getting along in our society. But math <br/>
and computer illiteracy are socially acceptable, and people have a certain <br/>
comfort level with it. You don&#39;t need a computer to drive a car(legally), <br/>
read directions, shop at the store. Calculators are available for those who <br/>
are math-impaired. That&#39;s the difference, IMO.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What types of violent shows or movies have your kids asked to watch that<br/>
you&#39;ve said no to?<br/>
<br/>
Do they have the opportunity to watch and decide for themselves that<br/>
something makes them uncomfortable?<br/>
<br/>
Do you fear that violence is sort of the preferred state of humans such that<br/>
children will be drawn to violence to the point that it overrides the<br/>
opposite message they&#39;re getting in the home? Why? What evidence have you<br/>
seen of it in your children?<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense that watching violence will desensitize people to violence.<br/>
But *why* are those people voluntarily choosing to watch violence? Is it<br/>
inate? Or is it a response to something else in their lives?<br/>
<br/>
Why would a child in a loving home be drawn to voluntarily becoming<br/>
desensitized towards violence towards their fellow human beings?<br/>
<br/>
Might some people be drawn to the power inherent in violence because they<br/>
feel powerless themselves? If their own needs are constantly thwarted to<br/>
make them conform to someone else&#39;s idea of how they should be living their<br/>
lives, wouldn&#39;t it be natural for them to want the ability to run their own<br/>
lives and perhaps get back at the power structure that controls them?<br/>
<br/>
If we empower our kids, then they don&#39;t need to look outside themselves for<br/>
a means of empowerment. Then for some violence can be just another form of<br/>
escapism. The idea of which undoubtedly bothers some people! I can see how<br/>
it would be difficult for some to believe that someone without violent<br/>
tendences would want to watch violence. I think we discussed this briefly<br/>
not too long ago and some people suggested watching violence may satisfy<br/>
that primal urge that we know we shouldn&#39;t listen to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a very peaceful person but I love movies like Terminator, Alien, Men in<br/>
Black, Independence Day. :-) I adored Xena. I don&#39;t like &quot;real&quot; violence,<br/>
though, like Bonny and Clyde and In Cold Blood or even Jaws. I think maybe<br/>
escapist violence is like enjoying shooting at targets or improving at Tae<br/>
Kwon Do. It&#39;s possible to appreciate the power without ever wanting to use<br/>
it against someone else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038028896">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list - just joined three days ago - so I am already in <br/>
violation of the suggestion in this group&#39;s &quot;mission&quot; as it&#39;s written up on <br/>
the yahoo site - the one that asks that new members wait for a couple of <br/>
weeks before jumping in. Please forgive! But I couldn&#39;t resist. I&#39;m afraid I <br/>
was one of those brown nosers in school who when the teacher asked a <br/>
question, would push my arm straight up in the air and frantically wave it <br/>
about, while at the same time my mind would be crying out &#39;pick me, pick me, <br/>
oh pick me&quot; in an attempt at one of those pupil-teacher mind melds. Trust <br/>
me, old habits die hard - when Joyce asked for others&#39; opinions on <br/>
sex/violence and the kidlets watching it on tv, my arm shot straight up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always felt that curtailing our children&#39;s viewing habits, whether it <br/>
be movies, tvs or computer games, looks and smells a lot like censorship. <br/>
IMO, the evils that have and continue to occur in the name of censorship <br/>
weigh much heavier than the evils of the &quot;product&quot; being censored. Added to <br/>
that, I hated that my parents were my censors for all those years, and in a <br/>
very real sense, curtailors of my education. Children are naturally <br/>
inquisitive and I want mine to explore whatever it is they want to explore. <br/>
The difference is that I&#39;m able to share it with my kids, either by watching <br/>
with them, or talking about the show/movie afterwards, whereas when I was a <br/>
kid, I had to sneak around on my own to get to see any of that stuff and my <br/>
parents certainly weren&#39;t in on any sharing of it with me.<br/>
<br/>
We are all self-regulators (or we should be)...it&#39;s a good life skill to <br/>
have, and I don&#39;t see any reason why not to have my kids learn it as soon as <br/>
they feel ready for it. My kids are 13 and 15, and so far it seems to be <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
shannon<br/>
...and now I&#39;ll go and write a wee introduction, which of course should have <br/>
come first, but my darned arm shot up too fast.<br/>

&gt;Subject: RE: Re: TV/sex/violence<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any time TV is mentioned here I have to read because it&#39;s probably one of<br/>
&gt;the issues I&#39;m having the toughest time with for unschooling.  This post<br/>
&gt;remembered me though I don&#39;t have very much of a problem with children<br/>
&gt;seeing much of the sex it&#39;s any kind of violence that bothers me.  The TV <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;so graphic, it really makes me nervous to not control it.  I would<br/>
&gt;appreciate understanding how others see this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;joyce k<br/>
<br/>

&gt; The thought has occurred to me lately that people will be doing that with <br/>
&gt; &quot;ADD&quot; in ten or twenty years.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I zoned out because I&#39;m ADD.&quot; <br/>

wouldn&#39;t &quot;play right&quot; -- meaning she&#39;d agree to the rules for playing Marco <br/>
Polo, but then she wouldn&#39;t follow them. The other two finally got tired of <br/>
it and told her to stop cheating. She said, and I quote exactly: &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>
blame me, I have ADD and that means I&#39;m special needs and I can&#39;t help what I <br/>
do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s actually a nice kid, most of the time. She was just being a bit ornery <br/>
and mishevious that day. But it made me REALLY sad to hear her say that. The <br/>
other two girls are homeschoolers and she isn&#39;t. They didn&#39;t know what to say <br/>
- just let it pass by them and went on to play something completely <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
That was last summer - they haven&#39;t played with her during the whole school <br/>
year. I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll be around again when school is out or if they <br/>
just didn&#39;t click anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203115665">How sad to be so defined and constrained by a label.  Public schools <br/>
are so ready to categorize... a misguided attempt that was originally <br/>
intended to &quot;help&quot;,but with all the beaurocracy that goes along with <br/>
a publicly funded system, inevitably degrades into rote <br/>
meaninglessness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528741787">I&#39;m, sorry, I guess I wasn&#39;t clear enough.  I was extrapolating the <br/>
two things out to the extremes to explain MY position better.  So it <br/>
isn&#39;t  porn vs. a fistfight.  It is graphic sex (in the context of the <br/>
movie) vs. seeing people torn apart, beaten to death or blood spurting <br/>
around everywhere solely as the point of the movie (gratuitously).  <br/>
Porn is a category all to itself and can include lots of violence too, <br/>
but the thing about porn is that it exists soelly for the sex, I guess <br/>
in the same way many violent movies exist purley for the violence.  So <br/>
maybe I&#39;m not compare the extreme form fairly?<br/>
<br/>
But to use your example, *why* is a girl in a thong worse that a <br/>
person kicking another?<br/>

&gt; Bridget,<br/>
&gt; First of all, please don&#39;t take my post as being offensive. I am <br/>
merely going <br/>
&gt; to post my thought on the whole thing. Okay?! :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You would rather let your child watch a movie with &quot;graphic sex <br/>
scenes&quot; <br/>
&gt; (porn) than gratuitous violence...well I don&#39;t call a movie that has <br/>
a couple <br/>
&gt; of punches that lend a bloody lip gratuitous violence. Neither do I <br/>
see a <br/>
&gt; kick that violent either. But graphic sex scenes...that is a little <br/>
more than <br/>
&gt; &quot;I&quot; care to explain. I guess that is the reason why I say no. When <br/>
your child <br/>
&gt; watches these types of movies, do you explain to them why the man <br/>
does what <br/>
&gt; he does and why the woman does what she does? I would have a REALLY <br/>
HARD TIME <br/>
&gt; trying to explain sexually graphic material. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And again honey, you know as well as I do that everyone has their <br/>
level of <br/>
&gt; belief. So, thanks for allowing me to share.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045350631">But, see, that&#39;s exactly what I don&#39;t understand!  Why is watching <br/>
something natural, loving and beautiful between two people (or even <br/>
something just lustily enjoyable) so much worse than seeing someone <br/>
blown away or eaten or beaten up?<br/>
<br/>
I can understand people who avoid both with their children, but not <br/>
one people who avoid the sex but not the violence.  I really am just <br/>
curious about the reasoning behind it.  If that is what you do, I&#39;m <br/>
not trying to tell you to do otherwise, I just want to know WHY you do <br/>
it because I don&#39;t understand.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the world but for me, I know that when I <br/>
start watching a lot of violent movies, it means the stress level in <br/>
my life is too high.  When I&#39;m ill or stressed, I watched a lot of Die <br/>
Hard, Leathal Weapon type movies.  They have not besensitized me to <br/>
actual violence.  I still cringe when the there is something on the <br/>
news.  I don&#39;t have any urges to play with guns or knives.  And I <br/>
never have an urge to hit anyone no matter how frustrated I am with <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I came to the conclusion years ago, that I use the movies as an <br/>
excape.  Sort of living vicariously through Bruce Willis and Mel <br/>
Gibson, if you will.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have noticed this year though:  Our exchange student <br/>
laughs at parts of the movie that I find laughter an inappropriate <br/>
response to.  I&#39;ve decided that it has something to do with cultural <br/>
differences, but we haven&#39;t quite figured out what in our respective  <br/>
cultures makes some things funny to him and not to me and vice versa.<br/>
