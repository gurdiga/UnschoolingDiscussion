       -- Views from the world of learning in Japan --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the 6 May 2000 edition of KnoK (pronounced &quot;knock&quot;) NEWS, an <br/>
informal and periodic bulletin concerning issues of learning in Japan. It <br/>
is brought to you by the Covert family -- Kazumi, Kenya and Brian -- a <br/>
multicultural, homelearning family in Osaka, Japan.<br/>
<br/>
KnoK stands for *Kodomo no Kokoro*, meaning &quot;Heart of a Child&quot; in <br/>
Japanese. It is our belief that the heart of any child is indeed at the <br/>
center of true learning, wherever and however such learning may take <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>

             &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDITOR&#39;S WELCOME:  Greetings again, everyone! We&#39;re already a month into <br/>
the new school year here in Japan -- the first school year of the new <br/>
millenium -- and along with it, no doubt, a slew of more news stories to <br/>
appear in the media about how schools appear to be failing Japanese <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
But for us homelearners in Japan, there is a bit of good news of a <br/>
different kind: One year ago this very day, a family in the global <br/>
homelearning community was featured in a prominent news story on <br/>
childraising that was published in a major daily newspaper in Japan&#39;s <br/>
capital city. And guess what: The story even turned out to be respectful <br/>
of, and open to, homelearning as an alternative to school.<br/>
<br/>
It was on 6 May 1999 that the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper ran a lengthy, <br/>
four-segment story on how families in the United States, China, Germany <br/>
and Hong Kong are coping with raising children. Interviewed for the <br/>
lead-in segment was Kathleen Iuzzolino, a homelearning parent based in <br/>
New Jersey.<br/>
<br/>
Ever looking for chances to celebrate homelearning in and out of Japan, <br/>
KnoK NEWS is delighted to share with readers our English translation of <br/>
that original Tokyo Shimbun article, as well as Kathleen&#39;s own revealing <br/>
insights of the interview session with the Japanese reporters.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be outdone by the mainstream media, KnoK NEWS also takes that <br/>
Tokyo Shimbun story one step further and looks briefly at where the <br/>
homelearners mentioned in the Japanese article are today -- one year later.<br/>
<br/>
This edition of KnoK NEWS has turned out to be a double feature, so our <br/>
report this time is being sent in two separate sections: In the first, we <br/>
look at the Tokyo Shimbun coverage. In the second, we wrap up our <br/>
two-part &quot;Q & A on Homeschooling in Japan&quot; by a respected Japanese <br/>
homelearning advocate and parent.<br/>
<br/>
So, enough of the introduction and into the action. With great pleasure, <br/>
we take you back one year ago today to a story that hit the newsstands of <br/>
Tokyo just around evening rush hour....<br/>

<br/>
NEW WORLD AFFAIRS<br/>
<br/>
Raising questions about childraising:<br/>
Moms and dads searching for answers<br/>
<br/>
The decreasing number of children per family in Japan has brought about <br/>
increasing concerns over the care of children. The appearance of Japanese <br/>
government promotional posters featuring popular idol singer Namie <br/>
Amuro&#39;s husband, Sam, holding their child caused a sensation, and stirred <br/>
public discussion about fathers participating in the raising of children.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the case of the youth in Kobe who wounded and killed <br/>
other children over a period of time has attracted much attention, as <br/>
have other brutal acts by youths. Methods of childraising and educating <br/>
are being questioned as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Here, we introduce circumstances around the world where such questioning <br/>
is taking place.<br/>
<br/>
--UNITED STATES:<br/>
<br/>
Kitchen becomes a classroom,<br/>
as distrust of educational system<br/>
fuels decision not to attend school<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is this right?&quot; ask Elizabeth, 12, and Alex, 11, notebooks in hand. &quot;Let <br/>
me see...&quot; responds Kathleen Iuzzolino, 39, running her pen over the pages.<br/>
<br/>
This would be a typical scene at school, yet it is actually an average, <br/>
everyday household kitchen. And these two children would be in sixth and <br/>
fifth grades of primary school, if they were attending school -- but they <br/>
are not.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Homeschooling,&quot; where children are taught in the home rather than being <br/>
sent to school, started spreading throughout the United States more than <br/>
10 years ago. Iuzzolino, who lives in a rural town in central New Jersey, <br/>
began teaching her three boys at home nine years ago. By linking up, she <br/>
and other parents are able to take charge of and share their fortes in <br/>
various subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Iuzzolino is taking charge of chemistry and physics. Counting [one of] <br/>
her three boys, Elizabeth and the other children in her support group, <br/>
Iuzzolino teaches eight children in all, weaving her way through the <br/>
group as she walks around checking their studies.<br/>
<br/>
According to the U.S. Department of Education, at least 500,000 children <br/>
are learning through such kind of homeschooling. That figure was a mere <br/>
10,000 in 1970. All 50 states now allow homeschooling, and more than a <br/>
few are like New Jersey, where, Iuzzolino says, &quot;There are no legal <br/>
restrictions as to what is taught.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is against this backdrop that a distrust of school education has <br/>
developed in the U.S., amid incidents of violence on school grounds and <br/>
falling educational standards. But, as Iuzzolino boasts, &quot;Homeschooling <br/>
provides a detailed education that fits a child&#39;s own level, and this <br/>
gets good results.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A 10-year-old in Iuzzolino&#39;s group is learning about chemistry formulas <br/>
at a comparatively early age; middle school-age youths are also <br/>
proceeding well in high-school level studies. Thanks to this kind of <br/>
learning environment, Iuzzolino&#39;s eldest son, at 15 years old, is allowed <br/>
to attend courses at the local college.<br/>
<br/>
Trust in education in the U.S. has been greatly eroded over the past year <br/>
in the wake of shootings by children, such as the random shooting at the <br/>
high school in a Denver, Colorado suburb.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The ones who know children best are their own parents,&quot; says Iuzzolino. <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s that simple.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
The U.S. segment on homelearning ends there, but the original Japanese <br/>
article goes on to present coverage from:<br/>
<br/>
--China, where the &quot;4-2-1 Syndrome&quot; (four grandparents, two parents, one <br/>
child) that has emerged under the country&#39;s population regulations is <br/>
leading to greater academic expectations on the only child in Chinese <br/>
families by parents and grandparents. A more active role by grandparents <br/>
in the lives of grandchildren has also come about as a result of this <br/>
social phenomenon, according to the story. <br/>
<br/>
--Germany, where the good news is that fathers are taking a more active <br/>
role in their children&#39;s upbringing. The bad news is that crimes <br/>
committed by youths in Germany are on the rise, due in part, the article <br/>
says, to the lagging economic conditions there. <br/>
<br/>
--and Hong Kong, where children are reportedly facing greater social <br/>
pressures than ever, especially from parents, to get into the best <br/>
primary and middle schools. Hong Kong working mothers usually have the <br/>
weekends off, and try to spend that time in &quot;skinship&quot; (physical <br/>
nurturing) with their children, the story says.<br/>
<br/>
LOOKING BACK:<br/>
<br/>
Kathleen Iuzzolino recalls the interview session a year ago in New Jersey <br/>
with the Japanese reporters that led to the story getting such prominent <br/>
placement in the Tokyo Shimbun....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The reporters were out of their New York office and wanted to <br/>
specifically interview American homeschoolers. When I mentioned to them <br/>
that there were Japanese homeschoolers [in Japan], they seemed a bit <br/>
surprised.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The reporters were by far among the most receptive interviewers that <br/>
I&#39;ve run across,&quot; Kathleen says, &quot;and I got *quite* an earful of their <br/>
opinions on what is wrong with Japanese schools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Despite the prevailing Western stereotypes of schoolchildren in Japan as <br/>
being rocket-scientist material, what the Japanese reporters saw at the <br/>
Iuzzolinos&#39; home that day seemed to have left them with positive <br/>
impressions of homelearning as a viable form of education for Japan.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They came here during one of my chemistry classes and took pictures and <br/>
talked with the kids,&quot; she remembers. &quot;They examined the chemistry text <br/>
that I used and exclaimed over and over again that they didn&#39;t know this <br/>
level of chemistry, that it had never been taught to them (which I found <br/>
surprising, considering all the stereotypes).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The reporters&#39; interest in homelearning extended well beyond the day&#39;s <br/>
lessons.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I must have talked to them for two hours after class,&quot; Kathleen recalls. <br/>
&quot;There was one American reporter with them and she just gushed for the <br/>
two full hours. The Japanese reporters, including the newspaper&#39;s New <br/>
York editor, were very complimentary and receptive to homeschooling as a <br/>
whole.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What appeared to be a professional interest in homelearning on the part <br/>
of the Japanese reporters soon revealed itself as something a little bit <br/>
closer to home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At first I thought they were happy that U.S. education had sunk so low <br/>
as to necessitate us do-it-yourselfers,&quot; Kathleen says. &quot;Then I figured <br/>
out that they were happy that they were finding alternatives for <br/>
*themselves*. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;That surprised me the most.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
WHERE ARE THEY NOW?<br/>
<br/>
Where the Tokyo Shimbun left off, KnoK NEWS picks up. Here&#39;s what the <br/>
homelearners who were mentioned in the Japanese newspaper story are doing <br/>
one year later:<br/>
<br/>
--Elizabeth has moved along well over the past year, and is finishing <br/>
studies at seventh-grade level. &quot;[She] has become much more of a leader <br/>
this year than a follower as in the past,&quot; according to Kathleen. <br/>
&quot;Science has helped Elizabeth to become more organized in her thinking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--Alexandra (&quot;Alex&quot;) is at sixth-grade level this year and is a <br/>
ballerina: &quot;Too sweet for words,&quot; notes Kathleen. &quot;Alex tackled <br/>
high-school level chemistry, physics AND biology this year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--The three Iuzzolino boys: Kathleen&#39;s youngest son, Raphael, now age <br/>
six, &quot;started piano lessons this year and blew on through three levels <br/>
since [last] September. He has a remarkable ability to read music -- even <br/>
though he can&#39;t read English yet. He plays, likes to cook with me, and <br/>
gets to ride all over the countryside as we take his brothers here, <br/>
there, and everywhere....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Brandon, 13, is now studying Spanish, art, art history, biology, <br/>
religion, chemistry, physics and piano. He has a black belt in tae kwon <br/>
do and is in training to become a certified assistant teacher. &quot;Right now <br/>
he is an apprentice instructor. He loves teaching kids and adults. He <br/>
spends about three hours a day at his academy. He is also an altar boy <br/>
and a Boy Scout....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Michael, 15, continued taking classes part-time at the local college this <br/>
past year -- &quot;had a marvelous time, loved working with the professors, <br/>
received too many credits and now has to matriculate because of them,&quot; <br/>
says Kathleen. Michael recently gave his first college recital as a <br/>
classical pianist, to a warm reception. He has a 4.0 grade point average, <br/>
as of this writing, and looks forward to entering college full-time in <br/>
the fall. He has been working part-time at his job, pays for his own <br/>
expenses and travel excursions, and is in line for a job promotion at <br/>
work when he turns 16. He too participates in Boy Scout and church <br/>
activities. Adds Kathleen: &quot;He doesn&#39;t consider himself to be <br/>
&#39;homeschooled&#39; any longer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--Kathleen Iuzzolino continues to be a homelearning parent, however. In <br/>
addition to working full time (she and her husband, Mark, are court <br/>
reporters), Kathleen is also teaching chemistry, physics and religion to <br/>
her own and other children. She also teaches an advanced chemistry class <br/>
with her eldest son and other older teens; she has been teaching this <br/>
class for four years. This year will be the last, she says, since several <br/>
of the teens in the group plan to attend college in the fall:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The activities of that older teens class are amazing. Last summer, one <br/>
girl went to Croatia to do missionary work; one went as a U.S. ambassador <br/>
to the Hague Appeal for Peace [May 1999] in the Netherlands, but had to <br/>
give a speech before thousands in Washingon, DC; one went alone to <br/>
Austria; one went alone to Germany; one toured Kenya with his family; and <br/>
one went to Iowa to do church-building missionary work (she&#39;s in Italy <br/>
right now). These kids have amazing lives. Their ages are 14 to 17.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although Kathleen speaks with obvious pride of what all these children <br/>
have been accomplishing, she is also quick to dismiss her own <br/>
homeschooled sons as any kind of child &quot;prodigies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They all have their strengths and their weaknesses,&quot; she says. &quot;Both of <br/>
the older boys have learning difficulties, my oldest with dyslexia and my <br/>
middle with writing difficulties. We have spent their lives concentrating <br/>
on their strengths and letting their weaknesses catch up at their own <br/>
developmental rates.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People always assume that these homeschooling &#39;success&#39; stories are just <br/>
exceptional children and their own children would never be able to <br/>
accomplish such goals,&quot; she said. &quot;I like to point out that homeschooling <br/>
allows *all* children to be &#39;exceptional&#39; children!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As the Japanese newspaper quotes Kathleen Iuzzolino as saying a year ago <br/>
today: &quot;The ones who know children best are their own parents. It&#39;s that <br/>
simple.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Indeed.<br/>
