<div id="ygrps-yiv-276102691">&lt;snip&gt;Some need more help than others in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; arriving at a point where they can be entirely self-driven and self-<br/>
&gt; directed.  **And that *should* be the ultimate goal.**  To help our<br/>
&gt; children become self-sufficient.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I generally find that I need to think things through more whe nthe word<br/>
*should* comes out.....where is this from?  You,  your ideas about what&#39;s<br/>
right and best?<br/>
<br/>
For me,  I hope my children grow into loving,  kind interdependent persons.<br/>
The idea of &#39;self sufficiency&#39; seems ..... &#39;off&#39; base for me and mine.<br/>
Susan....hopelessly behind from celebrating the holidays.....I&#39;ll try to<br/>
keep my keyboard quiet and just try to read and catch up :-)</div>
