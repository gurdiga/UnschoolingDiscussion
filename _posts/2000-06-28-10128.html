<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174047760"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; why else does a parent spank unless they are angry with their child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; behaior? If you&#39;re not angry you wouldn&#39;t need o discipline in any form.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you only discipline when you are angry, but you are in the minority<br/>
there.  A loving parent disciplines when the child needs correction, not<br/>
because the kid is being a brat.  I can be unhappy with the behavior of my<br/>
child without being angry at the child, and when my children disobey rules,<br/>
they need correction, guidance, discipline, whatever you call it.<br/>
<br/>
Do your children ever disobey your rules?  Do they ever do something<br/>
dangerous?  Unless you have *no* rules, they have indeed broken rules at<br/>
some point.  What you did as a result of the child&#39;s actions is discipline.<br/>
<br/>
Discipline is designed to teach, correct, to disciple.  We want to teach our<br/>
children right from wrong.  Therefore, when they exhibit wrong behavior<br/>
(taking a toy from another child, sneaking a cookie, whatever), we teach<br/>
them that that behavior is wrong.  We also administer correction in some<br/>
form because our actions have consequences.  Bad actions have bad<br/>
consequences, good actions have good consequences.<br/>
<br/>
It is because parents have *not* taught their children these simple facts<br/>
that we see so many kids today who sincerely believe that they do not have<br/>
to suffer the consequences of their actions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255966859">Steve and I have certainly had to take a look at this spanking issue and it <br/>
is one whether you homeschool or ps.  We&#39;ve come to the conclusion that we <br/>
cannot tell Zak not to hit people and then hit him.  It&#39;s just not logical <br/>
and my experience of life has been that children follow what you do rather <br/>
than what you say.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very hard not to hit him when he&#39;s done something I don&#39;t like... <br/>
However I do stop and look at why I&#39;m angry with the behavior... I ask myself <br/>
&quot;how much does this really matter?&quot;  &quot;Is this really a problem for me or <br/>
him&quot;.  For example... Before I had Max one day Zak decided to make a cake on <br/>
his own... I went to the bathroom and the phone rang.  I picked it up in the <br/>
bedroom and slowly wandered back into the kitchen, only to find about 10lbs <br/>
(and I&#39;m not kidding) of flour covering everything in the kitchen.  Now as <br/>
you guys know flour is like dust and was absolutely everywhere.  I was <br/>
exhausted and 7 months pregnant and sick and all I could think about was that <br/>
I wanted to wring his neck and hit him so hard that he&#39;d be knocked out <br/>
(thinking about it and doing it are two different things)  However, in a <br/>
split second I stopped myself from reacting and started asking him what he <br/>
was doing.  He told me it was snow and it was snowing in the kitchen.  He <br/>
wanted to see what it would be like to have snow everywhere.  I told him that <br/>
when he&#39;d finished playing snow (there was no flour left) we would be <br/>
cleaning the kitchen instead of going to the park, which was where we were <br/>
suppose to go... He cried and threw a tantrum about not going to the park as <br/>
I calmly explained to him that this was a consequence of his behavior and <br/>
that we needed to clean this mess up... It was an amazing experience for me.  <br/>
Now we talk about consequences all the time and the choices we make in the <br/>
things we do and he seems to understand.  It doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t do <br/>
things that I don&#39;t like, however he knows that sometimes there is a <br/>
consequence to his behavior that he doesn&#39;t like and he has a choice in the <br/>
actions he takes.<br/>
<br/>
Just my little input<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; i don&#39;t believe any research has bore this out.  i have to say imo<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spanking falls more in the realm of tradition i.e. &#39;old habits die<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard&#39;.   so we&#39;ll do anything to justify our need to control rather<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than acknowledge maybe we have been doing things wrong for a very long<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time.  i think this is especially true with parents not appologizing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to their children.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if a parent finds a &#39;justifible&#39; need to spank their child imo they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; should take a long hard look at their relationship w/ that child and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ask themselves some hard questions like &#39;just what am i modeling to my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; child that helps foster this unwanted behavior.&#39;   but most people can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not look at themselves w/ the same critical eye they use on their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; children. it&#39;s just too hard on the ego.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; children?&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Better as in how?  Usually when one wants something better it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; old method doesn&#39;t work.  Spanking does work when it is applied with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; love.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spanking because the parent is angry and it is the last resort does<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work.  I have found that spanking works very well for young<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; children.  You<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-390501559">Okay, I told myself I was going to stay out of this one, but . . .<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with someone else who made a comment about some of the<br/>
attitudes seeming inappropriate for an &quot;unschooling&quot; list. I thought<br/>
unschoolers disliked the artificial environment of schoolish learning where<br/>
it is important to learn a bunch of facts because they will be on a test and<br/>
if you don&#39;t learn them you will have the very artificial consequence of<br/>
performing poorly on the test.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else see the similarity between saying that bad actions have bad<br/>
consequences and I will teach you that by imposing the artificial<br/>
consequence of spanking you when you do what I consider to be a bad action?<br/>
<br/>
That attitude in school teaches many unintended lessons. Learning isn&#39;t<br/>
important, getting a good grade on the test is. Knowing about a subject<br/>
isn&#39;t as important as knowing what your teacher thinks is important. Since<br/>
it is important to get good grades, cheating may become an acceptable<br/>
option. Cheating is only possible for getting grades, not for learning.<br/>
Notice that if learning is important, there is also no reason to cheat.<br/>
<br/>
Spanking also teaches many unintended lessons. The biggest person gets to<br/>
make the rules. It is okay to hurt someone if you don&#39;t like what they are<br/>
doing. Might makes right. Don&#39;t get caught. Lying may become an acceptable<br/>
option if you are trying to avoid physical punishment.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of studies to show that positive reinforcement is much more<br/>
effective than negative reinforcement. Spanking is never necessary to teach<br/>
or correct. There are lots of options and the best one is to avoid the<br/>
problem to begin with. The best dog trainers will tell you that instead of<br/>
swatting a dog on the nose with a newspaper because he had an accident in<br/>
the house, you should take him outside after every meal and at regular<br/>
intervals between meals so he doesn&#39;t have the chance of having an accident<br/>
in the house.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I have always been horrified by the thought of a parent who can<br/>
&quot;calmly, and lovingly&quot; spank their child. I have more sympathy with a parent<br/>
who momentarily &quot;loses&quot; it but can later apologize and admit that they acted<br/>
in anger.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, where did I put my flame-proof suit. There it is. Give me a second to<br/>
get it zipped. I&#39;m now ready to push the send button and stand back from the<br/>
flames.<br/>

&gt;make the rules. It is okay to hurt someone if you don&#39;t like what they are<br/>
&gt;doing. Might makes right. Don&#39;t get caught. Lying may become an acceptable<br/>
&gt;option if you are trying to avoid physical punishment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are lots of studies to show that positive reinforcement is much more<br/>
&gt;effective than negative reinforcement. Spanking is never necessary to teach<br/>
&gt;or correct. There are lots of options and the best one is to avoid the<br/>
&gt;problem to begin with. The best dog trainers will tell you that instead of<br/>
&gt;swatting a dog on the nose with a newspaper because he had an accident in<br/>
&gt;the house, you should take him outside after every meal and at regular<br/>
&gt;intervals between meals so he doesn&#39;t have the chance of having an accident<br/>
&gt;in the house.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Frankly, I have always been horrified by the thought of a parent who can<br/>
&gt;&quot;calmly, and lovingly&quot; spank their child. I have more sympathy with a <br/>
&gt;parent<br/>
&gt;who momentarily &quot;loses&quot; it but can later apologize and admit that they <br/>
&gt;acted<br/>
&gt;in anger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Okay, where did I put my flame-proof suit. There it is. Give me a second to<br/>
&gt;get it zipped. I&#39;m now ready to push the send button and stand back from <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;flames.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Billy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Discipline is designed to teach, correct, to disciple.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to teach our<br/>
&gt; &gt; children right from wrong.  Therefore, when they exhibit<br/>
&gt; &gt; wrong behavior<br/>
&gt; &gt; (taking a toy from another child, sneaking a cookie,<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever), we teach<br/>
&gt; &gt; them that that behavior is wrong.  We also administer<br/>
&gt; &gt; correction in some<br/>
&gt; &gt; form because our actions have consequences.  Bad actions have bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; consequences, good actions have good consequences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It is because parents have *not* taught their children these<br/>
&gt; &gt; simple facts<br/>
&gt; &gt; that we see so many kids today who sincerely believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they do not have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to suffer the consequences of their actions.<br/>

If I don&#39;t control, direct, teach, and correct my children then I am not<br/>

their kids?  Sorry, you are way off.  Go to any kid gathering and you will<br/>

No I don&#39;t see a similarity.  Bad actions *do* have bad consequences.  If I<br/>

you get from it!  He was just being a little boy playing.  I certainly<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have spanked my kids for something like that, and they all did<br/>
similar things when they were younger.  We spank for direct disobediance.<br/>
For instance, if Zac had been throwing the flour around and you told him to<br/>
stop, then he looked at you and threw another handful of flour on the floor,<br/>
*that* would have been direct disobediance.  For me, that would have been a<br/>
spanking *and* helping mom clean up the floor.  The spanking for the<br/>
disobendiance and cleaning because he was the one who made the mess.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand that some people choose not to spank for whatever reasons,<br/>
we do.  As our kids have grown older there are fewer spankings.  There are<br/>
other things that &quot;hurt&quot; worse, like taking away computer privileges.<br/>

Please don&#39;t go yet.  I will no longer be responding to any of these emails <br/>

they are not helping any of us who have just started unschooling and would <br/>

I&#39;m off to the curriculum office in my township today since they have <br/>
&quot;approved&quot; my application to homeschool (I put this in quotes because they <br/>
have no right to approve to disapprove my intent).  I know have to &quot;prove&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301493501">hi dia,<br/>
<br/>
all i know is that if and when i &#39;spank&#39; my son i have always seen <br/>
it(w/out fail) as a failure on my part.  i understand the tempation to <br/>
take &#39;the short cut&#39; of spanking to bring about correct behavior but <br/>
it is my opinion and experience that spanking most certainly does not <br/>
have the child&#39;s best interest at heart and certainly does not aid in <br/>
developing the skill of self-discipline in a child.  rather it is, <br/>
imo, used only as tool for the parents to &#39;get&#39; their way in a timely <br/>
fashion.  so if you choose to spank that is your right and you will <br/>
never find me rallying for more laws which interfere w/ the rights of <br/>
parents.  but for me the price of spanking it just to high and i will <br/>
hope that this will be true for more and more parents as time goes by. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
as you can see from the quotes below there is much research that says <br/>
at the very least there are risks in the use of punishment to control <br/>
children.  what i have consciously choosen to use is a balance between <br/>
trust, understanding, and the authority which naturally grows out of <br/>
this type of relationship.  so please do not tell me that the fact <br/>
that i respect my son (as well as myself) enough to resist controlling <br/>
him via punishment and instead treat him w/ love, and compassionate <br/>
understanding that my family is contributing to the degradation of <br/>
american society.  yes our society has some major problems and one of <br/>
them is that people point their fingers at everyone but themselves.  <br/>
the truth is there is enough blame for everyone.  why don&#39;t you take <br/>
your piece, be it big or small, and improve life in american - i know <br/>
my back yard is messy enough w/ out me having to go pick on you.  if <br/>
we fix ourselves and not be so worried about others, things may just <br/>
begin to get better. <br/>
<br/>
here are some quotes concerning punishment:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;punishing does teach long lasting lessons...  regardless of what we <br/>
are trying to get across by spanking, paddling, or slapping them, the <br/>
message that actually comes through are these: &quot;violence is an <br/>
acceptible way of expressing anger&quot; and &quot;if you are powerful enough <br/>
you can get away with hurting someone.&quot;  for decades, researchers have <br/>
consistently found that children subjected to physical punishment tend <br/>
to be more agressive than their peers, and will likely grow up to use <br/>
violence on their own children.  these effects are not confined to <br/>
victums of what is legally classified as abuse: even &quot;acceptable&quot; <br/>
levels of physical punishment may perpetuate aggression and <br/>
unhappiness&quot;        -alfie kohn: punished by rewards (p.167)<br/>
(footnote 22 from p167:  &#39;research documenting the detrimental effects <br/>
of physical punishment has been published since at least the 1940&#39;s.  <br/>
one interesting study found a clearcut relationship between the <br/>
severity of the punishment received by eight-year-olds and how <br/>
aggressive their peers judge them to be.  more than 2 decades later, <br/>
the researchers tracked down some of these same subjects and found <br/>
that the aggressive children had grown into agressive adults, many of <br/>
whom were now using physical punishment on their own children... even <br/>
more recent research has found that toddlers who are hit by their <br/>
mothers are in fact less likely than their peers to do what they are <br/>
told... and that three-to-five-year-olds who are spanked by their <br/>
parents are more likely than other children to be aggressive while <br/>
playing at day care centers.&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
&#39;the word &quot;discipline&quot; derives from the latin word disciplina, meaning <br/>
&quot;instruction&quot; or &quot;method&quot;.  disciplining children should therefore <br/>
teach them something.  the purpose of punishing is to make someone <br/>
suffer.  making children suffer punishment may teach them humiliation, <br/>
rebellion, or vengefulness, but it rarely teaches them anything about <br/>
correcting behavior.&#39;  -  harville hendrix, phd  & helen hunt, ma, mla <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577029279">I want to just start out by being very clear to everyone that I am talking<br/>
about what we do in ***my*** family here, and I am answering a direct<br/>
question, so please do not post nasty messages about being &quot;judgmental&quot;.<br/>
Got it???<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; So if you and I were making a tuna salad together and I told you to get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mayo and you handed me something else and I said &quot;no I said get me the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mayo<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not the butter&quot; and you still didn&#39;t do as I asked it would be ok to spank<br/>
&gt; you for disobeying me?  Why is it ok to spank a child but not an adult who<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t do what I want them to do?  I&#39;m just interested in the response to<br/>
&gt; this and let&#39;s leave out &quot;but your not my child and we are equals, because<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not a real argument)  If the argument is that spanking stops<br/>
&gt; disobedience then why would children have to be spanked more than once?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, I can&#39;t leave out &quot;you&#39;re not my child&quot; because that is a very<br/>
real part of the issue.  It is not my job to train my peers, it is my job to<br/>
train my kids.  I guess we could make an analogy to countries that use<br/>
physical punishment for criminals,  it is the job of the country to &quot;train&quot;<br/>
in a sense the citizens.  Or at least the job of the country to keep the<br/>
citizens inline with the laws.  I have lived in a country that practices<br/>
physical punishment, and I have to say that there was very little crime<br/>
there.  The consequences of sure and swift harsh punishment was a deterrent<br/>
to crime.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t spank my kids because they don&#39;t do what I want them to do, I spank<br/>
them because they willingly and knowingly break the rules.  We use spanking<br/>
along with other consequences.  I do not hit my children, there is a<br/>
difference.  I was abused as a child, so I know full well what beating is.<br/>
Spanking is not done because I am angry, but as a consequence for actions.<br/>
Beating is done in anger for often unknown reasons.<br/>
<br/>
You asked why kids have to be spanked more than once if it stops<br/>
disobedience.  We can ask the same thing of any form of correction, can&#39;t<br/>
we?  Why do you have to put kids in &quot;time out&quot;, ground a teenager, take away<br/>
a privilege, or give extra work more than once if these are designed to stop<br/>
disobedience?  They have to be done more than once because it is a long job<br/>
to teach our children.  Some things they will do once and never again,<br/>
others they will do over and over.<br/>
<br/>
When we work with our calves to teach them to lead, they do not learn about<br/>
the halter the fist time we work with them.  It takes a lot of time to teach<br/>
them that when the halter is on, they go where we want them to go.  We do it<br/>
by making it uncomfortable for them when they stop, and comfortable for them<br/>
when they go.  I am not trying to equate children with animals here, just<br/>
the concept that it takes time to teach.  Once is not enough.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your posts Dawn!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564147646">I believe very strongly that you can teach your child right from wrong without<br/>
spanking, &quot;swatting&quot;, or hitting them. It is well documented that children from<br/>
birth to age 4 or 5 learn almost exclusively through modeling. When you hit a<br/>
child, or hit another person in front of a child, you are modeling that behavior<br/>
to the child.<br/>
<br/>
What I believe happens when a child is hit is the child learns to fear the<br/>
person who hit them. It might get you results, but at what cost? Hitting a child<br/>
is completely contrary to my idea of unschooling. Just as I would want my son to<br/>
learn for the joy of learning...I want him to do right for the sake of doing<br/>
right. Not because he fears the totally unnatural consequence of a spanking.<br/>
<br/>
You are more than welcome to spank your child if you see fit, but I have to<br/>
disagree that &quot;most people&quot; spank out of love for the child. Wow. I would hate<br/>
to teach that idea of love to ANYONE...much less a small person who is just<br/>
beginning to get a handle on how the world works.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Dia, this will go around and around with no conclusion. I am<br/>
completely perplexed at how you can wave a flag of &quot;moms who stay at home love<br/>
their children more/are better parents/are more conscientious.&quot; and also insist<br/>
that spanking is in the best interest of a child.<br/>
<br/>
This is really all I&#39;m going to say on the subject. I think what is irritating<br/>
me about this unschooling list is there are 3 or 4 people who seem to have<br/>
several thousand hours a day on their hands to post messages, and their views<br/>
run completely contrary to mine. I just don&#39;t have the time, energy,  or desire<br/>
to keep up with these discussions.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe you only discipline when you are angry, but you are in the minority<br/>
&gt; there.  A loving parent disciplines when the child needs correction, not<br/>
&gt; because the kid is being a brat.  I can be unhappy with the behavior of my<br/>
&gt; child without being angry at the child, and when my children disobey rules,<br/>
&gt; they need correction, guidance, discipline, whatever you call it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do your children ever disobey your rules?  Do they ever do something<br/>
&gt; dangerous?  Unless you have *no* rules, they have indeed broken rules at<br/>
&gt; some point.  What you did as a result of the child&#39;s actions is discipline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Discipline is designed to teach, correct, to disciple.  We want to teach our<br/>
&gt; children right from wrong.  Therefore, when they exhibit wrong behavior<br/>
&gt; (taking a toy from another child, sneaking a cookie, whatever), we teach<br/>
&gt; them that that behavior is wrong.  We also administer correction in some<br/>
&gt; form because our actions have consequences.  Bad actions have bad<br/>
&gt; consequences, good actions have good consequences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is because parents have *not* taught their children these simple facts<br/>
&gt; that we see so many kids today who sincerely believe that they do not have<br/>
&gt; to suffer the consequences of their actions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086603692">I have never stated that all parents should spank or that all kids need<br/>
spankings,  I said that it is an effective and valid method of correction.<br/>
If you use other methods of correction, fine.  I resent the outright slams<br/>

<br/>
My kids do not fear me, nor do the children of other families I knw who<br/>
spank.  I also know families who do not spank, and their kids still hit<br/>
other kids.  This arguement sounds good, but it does not hold water.  Kids<br/>
hit other kids regardless of whether they are spanked or not.  But then,<br/>
spanking is not hitting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You are more than welcome to spank your child if you see fit, but I have<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; disagree that &quot;most people&quot; spank out of love for the child. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why do you disagree?  Do you know many people who spank their kids?  And<br/>
have you asked them why they do it?  The people I know who spank their kids<br/>
do it out of a desire to teach their kids, not out of anger.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Putting in my two cents, I quite agree, which is really, when all is said and<br/>
done, why I oppose spanking.  Because, unless I live in Singapore, spanking is<br/>
never the consequence of my action as an adult.  Nor is the purposeful<br/>
infliction of physical pain upon my person.  And certainly not by someone who I<br/>
love and trust.<br/>
<br/>
So (other than my fear, which I grant doesn&#39;t happen very often, that the child<br/>
is seriously physically harmed by spanking, because I believe most parents who<br/>
use physical punishment really do love their children), my real objection is<br/>
that spanking a child does not communicate a realistic picture of consequences.<br/>
And I imagine that is a problem, for if a child learns that what goes on in<br/>
their own family does NOT teach how the world really works, they may learn to<br/>
distrust their entire family experience.  I don&#39;t say they WILL, but they MAY --<br/>
and I have met too many people in my experience who actually did.<br/>
<br/>
So I wish both sides in this one would chill out. Let&#39;s agree that most people<br/>
who spank love their children.  Let&#39;s agree that most spanking does not leave<br/>
long-lasting physical scars.  Let&#39;s agree that adults don&#39;t get spanked (except<br/>
the few who choose it for pleasure), nor are they tortured by authorities when<br/>
they commit crimes, so that if children are learning consequences, it is a very<br/>
indirect and not very &quot;efficient&quot; way to communicate the lesson.  Let&#39;s agree<br/>
that overall, we know little about the side effects. Let&#39;s also agree that the<br/>
side effects may be changing as social attitudes toward physical punishment have<br/>
changed (so that, oddly enough, they could be different  today than they used to<br/>
be.)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s agree that, regardless of our differences on this issue, our job is to<br/>
cherish these bits of star-stuff gathered, for they are the only real future we<br/>
will ever see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608073930">i don&#39;t see it as my job to train my kids... more to teach my kids... what <br/>
they need to know to get along in life... but maybe that&#39;s what you <br/>
meant...when i think of training, i think of pavlov&#39;s dogs and conditioned <br/>
responses... that&#39;s the last thing i want my kids to learn...but i feel real <br/>
bad when i spank/hit whatever... and i always apologize when i&#39;ve lashed out <br/>
physically... i try very hard to eliminate that... but i&#39;m not perfect... i <br/>
want to be, but i&#39;m not... being the parent of an 11 and a 14 year old, i <br/>
find myself making a whole lot of rules... even though i take the time to <br/>
explain the reasons behind them, they still don&#39;t see it and test us <br/>
constantly... i&#39;d really rather not punish ... punishment too often causes <br/>
resent and ultimately worse behavior... but i haven&#39;t found anything else <br/>
that works as well as &quot;if you break the rules, you lose privelages&quot;... which <br/>
is a form of punishment that they choose when they knowingly break the <br/>
rules... i still smack them in the mouth very occasionally, which i always <br/>
regret... and it&#39;s usually because i&#39;m upset by what or how they are talking <br/>
to me ... like i said, i&#39;m not perfect... but i&#39;m trying... it&#39;s the teenage <br/>
years... i remember how hard it was and i have understanding for them, and <br/>
now such incredible understanding for what my own mother went through ... <br/>
lol... poor thing... <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; First of all, I can&#39;t leave out &quot;you&#39;re not my child&quot; because that is a <br/>
very<br/>
 real part of the issue.  It is not my job to train my peers, it is my job to<br/>
 train my kids.  I guess we could make an analogy to countries that use<br/>
 physical punishment for criminals,  it is the job of the country to &quot;train&quot;<br/>
 in a sense the citizens.  Or at least the job of the country to keep the<br/>
 citizens inline with the laws.  I have lived in a country that practices<br/>
 physical punishment, and I have to say that there was very little crime<br/>
 there.  The consequences of sure and swift harsh punishment was a deterrent<br/>
 to crime.<br/>
 <br/>
 I don&#39;t spank my kids because they don&#39;t do what I want them to do, I spank<br/>
 them because they willingly and knowingly break the rules.  We use spanking<br/>
 along with other consequences.  I do not hit my children, there is a<br/>
 difference.  I was abused as a child, so I know full well what beating is.<br/>
 Spanking is not done because I am angry, but as a consequence for actions.<br/>
 Beating is done in anger for often unknown reasons.<br/>
 <br/>
 You asked why kids have to be spanked more than once if it stops<br/>
 disobedience.  We can ask the same thing of any form of correction, can&#39;t<br/>
 we?  Why do you have to put kids in &quot;time out&quot;, ground a teenager, take away<br/>
 a privilege, or give extra work more than once if these are designed to stop<br/>
 disobedience?  They have to be done more than once because it is a long job<br/>
 to teach our children.  Some things they will do once and never again,<br/>
 others they will do over and over.<br/>
 <br/>
 When we work with our calves to teach them to lead, they do not learn about<br/>
 the halter the fist time we work with them.  It takes a lot of time to teach<br/>
 them that when the halter is on, they go where we want them to go.  We do it<br/>
 by making it uncomfortable for them when they stop, and comfortable for them<br/>
 when they go.  I am not trying to equate children with animals here, just<br/>
 the concept that it takes time to teach.  Once is not enough. &gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004326756">&lt;&lt; I believe very strongly that you can teach your child right from wrong <br/>
without<br/>
 spanking, &quot;swatting&quot;, or hitting them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
so do i... i wish i was able to say i never once swatted/spanked/hit whatever <br/>
them...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is well documented that children from<br/>
 birth to age 4 or 5 learn almost exclusively through modeling. When you hit a<br/>
 child, or hit another person in front of a child, you are modeling that <br/>
behavior<br/>
 to the child.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
yes, absolutely and they continue to learn through modeling... of their <br/>
peers, tv, movies, news, etc... ay, therein may be an integral part of the <br/>
problem, imo... it was easy for me to not spank from birth to 5 years old... <br/>
other techniques worked very well to achieve desired behavior<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; What I believe happens when a child is hit is the child learns to fear the<br/>
 person who hit them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
well, maybe not always... i wasn&#39;t afraid of my parents... they never hurt me <br/>
physically... but i didn&#39;t like being spanked, so i &quot;behaved&quot;... i don&#39;t know <br/>
if it was a good thing or not... i do know that i held back doing some <br/>
experimental things that would have not harmed anyone... i remember the thing <br/>
that most upset me as a child was that my parents wouldn&#39;t discuss anything <br/>
... if i thought their decision was unreasonable, that was tough noogies... i <br/>
was not allowed to question it... i had to just know that being forbidden to <br/>
go to my girlfriend&#39;s house was &quot;for my own good&quot;... that stunk... i hated <br/>
it, and i vowed never to do that with my own kids... and i don&#39;t... i always <br/>
explain... probably too much... and i try to say yes to anything that doesn&#39;t <br/>
hurt them or anyone else... <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;It might get you results, but at what cost? Hitting a child<br/>
 is completely contrary to my idea of unschooling. Just as I would want my <br/>

<br/>
natural?  gee, i don&#39;t know what&#39;s natural spankingwise... or even violence <br/>
wise ... i hate it, and disagree with it, but recognize that it has been with <br/>
us since always...<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;You are more than welcome to spank your child if you see fit, but I have to<br/>
 disagree that &quot;most people&quot; spank out of love for the child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
in today&#39;s world i wholeheartedly agree with you... i think with all the <br/>
research on punishment and spanking and it&#39;s ineffectiveness that people <br/>
spank out of habit.. because they were spanked... and maybe sometimes because <br/>
the little kid inside of them that wasn&#39;t allowed to do something is <br/>
asserting power of their child now... i&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of other reasons <br/>
too... including because people believe it&#39;s out of love for their child... i <br/>
think it&#39;s often cultural and tied into our heritage too... a hard thing to <br/>
separate from even in the face of research...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Wow. I would hate<br/>
 to teach that idea of love to ANYONE...much less a small person who is just<br/>
 beginning to get a handle on how the world works.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
well, that&#39;s not always the case... it sure wasn&#39;t with me anyway when i was <br/>
growing up... for the most part, the kind of spanking i got was a cruel <br/>
lesson that i learned very young... younger than my children are... that the <br/>
world is just not fair sometimes... and there are people who wield power over <br/>
you ... it left me with strong rather subcultural principles and avoidance of <br/>
situations that involve me in the violent world of power hungry forces... i <br/>
like it that way... <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; Of course, Dia, this will go around and around with no conclusion. I am<br/>
 completely perplexed at how you can wave a flag of &quot;moms who stay at home <br/>
love<br/>
 their children more/are better parents/are more conscientious.&quot; and also <br/>
insist<br/>
 that spanking is in the best interest of a child.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
we are complex creatures... here to fill in each other&#39;s blanks, imo...<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; This is really all I&#39;m going to say on the subject. I think what is <br/>
irritating<br/>
 me about this unschooling list is there are 3 or 4 people who seem to have<br/>
 several thousand hours a day on their hands to post messages, and their views<br/>

i get jealous sometimes, but not irritated... lol... my leisure hours and <br/>
