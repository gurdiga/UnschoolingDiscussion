the<br/>
Christian ones, if I understand correctly).   A GED is WAY, way cheaper and <br/>
IS<br/>
&quot;accredited&quot; (recognized by the government as an equivalent of public <br/>
school).  In<br/>
New Mexico, if one gets a GED before adulthood, it&#39;s a high school diploma<br/>
straight up, issued by the state board of education.   Says so:  High School<br/>
Diploma right on the diploma they send.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly other states have similar options.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if the GEDs in VA say high school diploma and my three children <br/>
who have one aren&#39;t home now.<br/>
But our experience with the GED was very positive.  When my two oldest <br/>
children, David and Sarah, got their GEDs (in 1995 and 1997) the  law was <br/>
that to receive federal financial aid for college or higher ed a student <br/>
must have graduated from an accredited high school (public or some private <br/>
schools) OR must have a GED.  Since we didn&#39;t consider either public or <br/>
private school much of an option but wanted (needed) the financial aid they <br/>
both got their GEDs.  It was easy, cheap, and quick to do.  Both of them <br/>
were 16 yo when they &quot;graduated.&quot;  David went to community college and did <br/>
well enough to get scholarships when he transferred to a 4-year school.  He <br/>
has a BA in history and philosophy/religion and has been studying for the <br/>
M.Div. at a TN seminary.  Sarah chose cosmetology school and because she <br/>
qualified for financial aid, it was totally free.  She has been a licensed <br/>
cosmetologist since 1998, graduating from that school at age 17.<br/>
My third child, Martha, did not &quot;have&quot; to get her GED to receive college <br/>
financial aid, as the law was changed, but she chose to get it in 2000.  She <br/>
did not &quot;graduate&quot; early, but was only 17 because of her August birthday. <br/>
She also began by attending the local community college and also received <br/>
scholarships when she transferred to a 4-year school.  She will graduate <br/>
this May with a BS in psychology, minors in theater and Bible.  She hopes to <br/>
go to Duke Divinity School next year (we&#39;ll know if she&#39;s accepted next <br/>
week).<br/>
<br/>
When my children or others asked if a GED would stigmatize them, or be <br/>
somehow less impressive than a &quot;real&quot; diploma, I told them that:<br/>
1.  They &quot;proved&quot; they could read, write, and do math, which was more than <br/>
many graduates were doing at the time.<br/>
2. The GED is normed on high school graduates, and passing rates are set so <br/>
that a student must do better than 50 or 60 % (I forget the exact figure) of <br/>
the high school graduates.   That&#39;s certainly not a bad thing and nothing to <br/>
be ashamed of.<br/>
3.  All three of them received a high school diploma from us and our &quot;home <br/>
school,&quot; and they can choose to use that for jobs or schooling, display it, <br/>
or keep it private - that&#39;s all up to them.  But it is recognized as a <br/>
non-accredited high school diploma.<br/>
4. If they chose to go on, then no one would ever really look at their high <br/>
school years - If you have a college or trade school degree an employer <br/>
isn&#39;t usually too concerned about high school.<br/>
5.  If they didn&#39;t go on to any other schooling, a GED would allow them to <br/>
fill in job aps with School - &quot;Homeschool&quot; and Graduated? &quot;Yes&quot; with no <br/>
questions.<br/>
They can use the name of the local high school if they want to, because that <br/>
is on their GED. (None of them ever has, though!)<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve never had any problems doing, studying, or learning what they wanted <br/>
and the GED never hindered them.  It only helped.<br/>
<br/>
Important Note:  A GED also can help students be legally out from under the <br/>
public school&#39;s domain (oversight - reporting, testing, etc.) sooner, <br/>
because they are (in VA anyway) able to graduate at age 16 instead of 18. <br/>
Then they&#39;re free to pursue their own lives without school hassles (for them <br/>
or Mom).  Also, for VA community college, a GED means automatic admission, <br/>
as opposed to some places where 16-17 yo homeschool students want to take <br/>
classes and may be refused.<br/>
