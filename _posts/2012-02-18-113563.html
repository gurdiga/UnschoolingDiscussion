Subject: Question about Oak Meadow School in Vermont<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I would like some information on Oak Meadow online school for homeschoolers in Vermont. If you are an unschooling family and have used this school online and would like to share your experience I would greatly appreciate it. I am very curious to know how the assessment of lower grade students takes place. I couldn&#39;t get any information on their website. Do they have tests, worksheet submission online, etc?<br/>
Thank You<br/>
