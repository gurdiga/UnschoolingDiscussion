 Hi Michelle in DE<br/>
 <br/>
 What&#39;s Love and Logic... I&#39;ve missed a few digests as we were away and <br/>
 decided I had too many e-mails to read so deleted a whole bunch... <br/>

Hi Dawn!  Love and Logic is a type of approach to parenting.  Among us we <br/>
have a couple who teaches the concepts and has given some great advice and <br/>
tips on effectively using the principles of Love and Logic.  The authors of <br/>
the Love and Logic approach are Foster Cline, M.D. & Jim Fay.  They have <br/>
several titles that I know are available in the Library.  In a nutshell, this <br/>
approach to parenting helps the child learn consequences through suitable <br/>
choices provided by the parent.   I would encourage you to read back through <br/>
the last couple of digest b/c there was some GREAT dialogue on the topic.  <br/>
Apparently, many of us have young children and the info. given was <br/>
invaluable.  Thanks  to Carron! <br/>
