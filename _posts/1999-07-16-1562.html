<div id="ygrps-yiv-236200430">Hi everyone!<br/>
    I&#39;m not sure I sent an intro to this list! I&#39;m  FT USing mom to three<br/>
rambunctious boys, 8yo, soon-to-be 7yo and just-turned 3yo. This will be our<br/>
third year (!?!) unschooling here in central Indiana, and we just love it!<br/>
    Right now, the two oldest are out feeding and watering our dogs, and<br/>
then we are heading to one of the state parks near here to a naturalist-led<br/>
program on fireflies!<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;ve been enjoying reading the list:)<br/>
    e-mail ya soon!<br/>
Tamara<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I would be most happy if my children grew up to be the<br/>
kind of people who think decorating consists of building<br/>
enough bookshelves.&quot; -- Anna Quindlen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470415284">hi, i just joined this group. i&#39;m stacie (26), married 9 yrs. to ben <br/>
and mom to zoë (&quot;very, very 5&quot;), madilyn (4 soon) and gavin <br/>
(1, &quot;going on 5&quot;). we live in pasadena, MD. we&#39;ve been &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
since birth. soon i&#39;ll be contacting the county to let them know <br/>
we&#39;re starting kindergarten with zoë. is there anyone else here <br/>
living in maryland?<br/>
<br/>
active interests in this household include: yoga, origami, knitting, <br/>
sculpting, reading, writing, video games, guinea pigs, computers & <br/>
networking, gourmet cooking & grilling, winemaking & tasting, <br/>
dioramas, collage & scrapbooking, U2 (the rock band), environmentally <br/>
friendly homemaking, &quot;indigo children&quot;, indie films, musicals, rubber <br/>
duckies and playing make-believe. <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m looking for an online discussion community because i too feel a <br/>
tremendous weight being home all day with the kids. some days are <br/>
better than others. i believe a little commiseration can go a long <br/>
way! (and heather, it sounds to me like you are doing a fine job! <br/>
&lt;hug&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>
stacie<br/>
//p.s. sorry about no caps. i can only post when &#39;nak&#39;.</div>
