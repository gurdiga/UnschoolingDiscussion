<div id="ygrps-yiv-442895369">Hi Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
Just to be clear, these violent episodes ONLY happen in the presence of<br/>
others?  Do you think that could be because at home, in one-on-one you are<br/>
able to see them coming and head them off faster or do you think that the<br/>
situation of having to &quot;share&quot; you sets her off?<br/>
<br/>
When I was reading your description, I originally thought &quot;Well, I&#39;d want to<br/>
rule out temporal lobe seizures&quot; while those often result in very temporary,<br/>
often bizarre, changes in behavior, they are not situation specific.<br/>
<br/>
If I really felt it was affecting my relationships with people who are<br/>
important to me, including my daughter, I would simply get a baby-sitter for<br/>
those times that I wanted to interact with others.  I do believe that it is<br/>
good to be supportive of your daughter&#39;s need to be with you, but you don&#39;t<br/>
want to wind up resenting her and in essence, becoming her captive.  That<br/>
isn&#39;t desirable or healthy.  I&#39;m not advocating a baby-sitter on a daily<br/>
basis, just for those times when you feel if you have to stay home or deal<br/>
with a tantrum, you will really resent it.<br/>
