<div id="ygrps-yiv-831265828"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, that would be great but he doesn&#39;t read..... and It took a bit to<br/>
&gt; convince him on homeschooling and now I am going to unschooling.... he is so<br/>
&gt; off board he is on another ship. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, maybe it&#39;s time to play....<br/>
Let&#39;s make a deal!<br/>
<br/>
As in, &quot;Honey, we tried school, and it didn&#39;t work.  Let&#39;s try this for a<br/>
certain amount of time (6 months?  a year?  long enough to see some<br/>
results!) and see how it works.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t have to like it, he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to understand entirely, if he chooses not to do so.  That&#39;s his choice.<br/>
It would be fair, though, to expect him to reasonably try, i.e., no negative<br/>
comments, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that unschooling works, because I see results in my own home and<br/>
hear stories from many other folks who see results.  I&#39;m willing to bet that<br/>
you, also, will see positive results.  That can be the deciding factor.<br/>
