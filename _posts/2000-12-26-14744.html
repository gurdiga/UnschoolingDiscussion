<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251962582">Hi Samantha<br/>
It&#39;s funny but I just wrote a similar email to a friend about my 4 1/2 year<br/>
old son.  I don&#39;t spend as much time explaining things to him/ reading to<br/>
him etc, as I did with his two older sisters.  But that hasn&#39;t stopped him<br/>
from learning.  Sitting in the car the other day , (kicking my seat, hands<br/>
flying) he suddenly said, &quot; I know what&#39;s in your body! BOnes!&quot;  He went on<br/>
to add muscle, blood, heart, and with a few hints, got some other organs<br/>
too.  But it was reassuring that he is learning even though  much of his<br/>
life is being dragged around while his older siblings do things.  Also we<br/>
were in a multistory carpark the other day and he was running up and down<br/>
the stairs reading the numbers on the levels!  I only just realized he even<br/>
knew his numbers :-)   He NEVER sits still, always jumping around, on the<br/>
furniture, me, his baby sister :-/, but I have to remember that  his mind is<br/>
going at the same rate :-)  Not to be outdone, his 6 year old sister said to<br/>
me &quot;I want a 2p, a2p, and a 1p and another 2p,2p and 1p.&quot;  She wanted to buy<br/>
a 10 pence licorice twist from the shop we were going to. Needless to say,<br/>
she got the licorice twist. :-)<br/>
Peace<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I just wanted to share something I observed my 5yo dd<br/>
&gt; do today. We had sat down to each lunch together (rare<br/>
&gt; treat kids are usually much to busy to do so lately)<br/>
&gt; Dd said ya know 2 and 2 and 1 make 5.  I was floored<br/>
&gt; wow math. While she was doing this she was rocking<br/>
&gt; back and forth on her knees.  She was constantly in<br/>
&gt; motion while describing simple math problems and also<br/>
&gt; asking me how to spell several words. I also remember<br/>
&gt; when she wanted me to scribe some stories she made up.<br/>
&gt;  She recited the stories nad I wrote them down while<br/>
&gt; she was dancing around the room. She could not sit<br/>
&gt; still.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Peace,<br/>
