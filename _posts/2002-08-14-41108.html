&gt; I work at Toys R Us and was straightening the baby toy aisle the other<br/>
&gt; night.  There were several boxes of this musical light-up gizmo and one box<br/>
&gt; that was slightly different.  Same toy, older packaging.  I read the virtues<br/>
&gt; of this toy, and the old box listed FUN!  On the new boxes there was no such<br/>
&gt; word.  It was replaced by EDUCATIONAL!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s right, Mary J.    Toys and games are &quot;educational&quot; and Public School<br/>
is sold as FUN. It&#39;s another example of all the reversals taking place in<br/>
society and the schools.   Reading is taught as therapy instead of skill.<br/>
Sex is taught as an &quot;activity&quot; to public school kids, while morality is<br/>
&quot;relative&quot; and situational ethics. God and the commandments were<br/>
replaced(not that I favor religion in those schools) by a priesthood of<br/>
employees and unions with different rules.  Failure is not possible in<br/>
school any more (problem is, neither is success)<br/>
<br/>
And pre-unschooling programs have curricula. Go figger. No wonder we have to<br/>
ask, Am I crazy?<br/>
