<div id="ygrps-yiv-704641208">Melanie-- Hi , I am Karen and live in Ind.  I read your post--how fascinating <br/>
to live in Japan!  Well, I have never made soap, but I looked it up on the <br/>
web, and came up with some possible help for you.  There is a lye calculator <br/>
on this web site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-sage.com/services/calculator.html">http://www.the-sage.com/services/calculator.html</a>     If you <br/>
have trouble getting this info, I would be happy to try and get it and send <br/>
it to you.  Basically, be ready to submit which kind of lye you will use- <br/>
solid or liquid.  The calculator will tell you the amt of lye required to <br/>
convert the specified amts of fats and oils to soap.  You will need to know <br/>
what amts of each oil or fat you will use in your recipe.  The list of <br/>
various oils and fats is pretty long to select from on the web page, <br/>
otherwise I would list them here for you.  Well, good luck, and please let me <br/>
know if I can help you.     Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723805692">Melanie, If I remember right, you said it was illegal to use lye in Japan.  <br/>
Here is another site to check into:  Soapmaking.ChatBoard.Org.  Hopefully <br/>
someone can help you figure out what to do.  Good Luck.                         <br/>
