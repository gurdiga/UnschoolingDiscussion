<div id="ygrps-yiv-843453372">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to introduce myself to the group. My name is Marianne, I <br/>
am writing from St. Augustine, Florida. My husband John and I have <br/>
been unschooling my son Jack for 5 years now, he&#39;s 5. :) <br/>
<br/>
I think it was right around the time that Jack turned two that people <br/>
started asking me if he was in school. I just respond with a strange <br/>
expression on my face, &quot;He&#39;s only 2!@#*!?&quot;  Next I would share the <br/>
fact that it didn&#39;t matter anyway because we were homeschooling. Now <br/>
I always get questions like, &quot;So, when are you going to start?&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Are you still doing that homeschooling thing?&quot; or &quot;What about <br/>
algebra?&quot; Ugh! So now I just casually tell people, &quot;Oh, yes, we have <br/>
been homeschooling for 5 years now and it is going wonderfully.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At times it can be a challenge because we have relatives spending <br/>
$10,000 a year, per child, on early education....$10,000 for <br/>
kindergarten!!!!???? I say, just go out and play in the mud, it&#39;s <br/>
free! It does not help that my husband&#39;s family is from the Mainline  <br/>
Philadelphia and have all had a prep school education...I think my <br/>
son will be the first who will not be attending the same school as <br/>
all the other males in the family...not just not attending that <br/>
particular school, but not attending school at all. That seems to be <br/>
difficult for many people to accept. I guess it is not surprising <br/>
that people, both family and some old friends of ours, find <br/>
it &quot;helpful&quot; to quiz Jack on things when we visit. It&#39;s as if they <br/>
are taking an inventory of his knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose the fact that we live a few states away does make it <br/>
easier. As does the fact that our families are made up of some very <br/>
wonderful people. I believe that as Jack gets older and his <br/>
personality shines through, they will all begin to trust the <br/>
discussion we&#39;ve made.<br/>
<br/>
OK, well then, I guess that was a lengthy introduction... hmmm ... <br/>
perhaps I needed more of a sounding board as well.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting everyone and reading all your views as <br/>
well as sharing my own.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome, Marianne! I&#39;m Danielle, unschooling mom of Emily (8), Julia (7 <br/>
in five days) and Sam (5). We live and learn in Northern Maryland, but I <br/>
grew up just off the Mainline--pretty much where it dead ends. ;)<br/>
<br/>
My in-laws come from humble beginnings, but they live outside of NYC, <br/>
leading a solidly middle-class life in a solidly upper-middle class <br/>
area, which translates into some major achievement pressure. My sil <br/>
works in NYC, and my nephew has been doing pre/school, and evals, and <br/>
organized activities for years now, and he&#39;s only 6. *eek!!*<br/>
<br/>
It helps *loads* being in another state and keeping the visits brief and <br/>
to a minimum. My mil has been talking about taking the kids for a beach <br/>
week for a while now, and I just keep politely putting that off. Argh, I <br/>
can&#39;t imagine her having them for a whole week in another state! No <br/>
thank you!<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, glad to have you here!<br/>
<br/>

  Thanks for sharing...sounds like you know exactly what I&#39;ve been going through. Though both my MIL and FIL have passed away, my husband is one of eight and I am one of six. Fortunately, most of his siblings&#39; children are grown and are having families of their own. So those siblings are somewhat removed from that parenting stage of their lives, though many of them are still involved in different school alumni activities. <br/>
   <br/>
  When we first moved so far away from our families, I was slightly hesitant. On my husband&#39;s side, Jack is the 18th grandchild, plus there are an additional 7 great grandchildren. On my side he is one of 8 grandchildren. And here he is living in Florida as an only child. Sometimes I feel a little guilty about him being alone, but in the end, I think it all balances out. When we go up we have a lot of people to see, and many cousins, and Aunts & Uncles to connect with. We usually just have time to play, not compare notes or get caught up in differences in our belief systems.<br/>
   <br/>
  As for your children and your mil, that sounds like a difficult situation. Maybe you could start out with just a weekend. I&#39;m that would be hard considering the distance; however at least it isn&#39;t long enough for her to enroll them in school! :)<br/>

I just rejoined AlwaysLearning and didn&#39;t have my filter set up yet, so <br/>
Marianne&#39;s message went into my inbox where my AlwaysUnschooled stuff <br/>
goes. (Co-list owner at AlwaysUnschooled, list for kids under age 8 or <br/>
so.)  Duh! I just rattled off that intro welcome as if I&#39;d been here <br/>
forever.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about that folks, though I&#39;m glad you found it helpful, Marianne!<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, by way of my own re-intro...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Danielle, unschooling mom to Emily (8), Julia (7 this week) and Sam <br/>
(5)--I guess I kinda gave that info out in my post.<br/>
