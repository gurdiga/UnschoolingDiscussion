<div id="ygrps-yiv-842959130">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I know there are some other military families on this list who unschool.  If<br/>
you would be willing to fill out a questionnaire to help the folks quoted<br/>
below, please email me off list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abtleo@...">abtleo@...</a> or Valarie directly<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starrmoon@...">starrmoon@...</a>   When I last heard from Valarie, she was receiving<br/>
many replies from &quot;schoolinabox&quot; types and was interested in hearing from<br/>
more unschoolers.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Two other military homeschoolers, Sue Patterson and Beth Elliot, and<br/>
&gt; I are writing a book, so far named On The Move: A Guide to Military<br/>
&gt; Homeschooling. Sue is the military coordinator for the National Home<br/>
&gt; Education Network (NHEN) military pages:<br/>
