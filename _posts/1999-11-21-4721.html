<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185923394">1) THANK YOU ALL for your great feedback! You&#39;re right - even if my friend<br/>
had pushed her son to learn the math facts isn&#39;t a guarantee that he would<br/>
have... and he can learn them now if he really wanted to.  I think I&#39;ll<br/>
keep treating math as &quot;fun&quot; - board games, math in real life applications,<br/>
etc.... and on the rare occasion that she does ask for math worksheets,<br/>
I&#39;ll give them to her...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Come to think of it I think your right, but it looks so good on paper.LOL<br/>
&gt;I really love to have those nice little papers to show daddy that we are <br/>
&gt;learning here in hs land. Unschooling is so hard to do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know the feeling - papers would be easy!  At least 3 times a week, my dh<br/>
still asks my 9yo dd &quot;did you do math today?&quot; and my 6yo ds &quot;did you do your<br/>
letters and numbers today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) Art - when my dd was young, we would set her up with all her artwork<br/>
around her - on the walls, floor, etc. and take one picture of all of it <br/>
together... now that we need it for our homeschooling portfolio, I take a <br/>
photo of each individual piece of art, and put the photo in our portfolio.<br/>
It takes up a lot less space! We also let my dd and ds keep their favorite<br/>
works of art, and hang them up in their bedrooms. Usually by the time my 6yo<br/>
ds has a new piece, he&#39;s ready to take down the old one.  My dd is a little<br/>
more sentimental, so I usually put them in a pile and get rid of the less-<br/>
than-favorite ones when she&#39;s unaware (sneaky, I know, but before you know<br/>
it, I&#39;d need a storage unit for all the artwork!).  I keep the favorites<br/>
in a pile for her scrapbook - it&#39;s actually all in a drawer right now, as<br/>
I haven&#39;t actually put anything in a scrapbook... but the drawer is filling,<br/>
so I&#39;ll have to do it soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again all!<br/>
