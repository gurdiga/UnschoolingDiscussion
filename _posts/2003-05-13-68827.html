<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Any time I mention getting together at parties or field trips that<br/>
&gt; they go on, he backs out. For example....there is a camp out in July<br/>
&gt; that is only about 1/2 hour from us (sounded like fun to me). I told<br/>
&gt; him tonight that I would like to go (even though DD is only 2) so that<br/>
&gt; we can start to get to know the local homeschoolers and he does not<br/>
&gt; want to go. His reasoning (if you can call if that) is that he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go because he doesn&#39;t know anyone! I asked him how he<br/>
&gt; thought we were going to get to know anyone if we never went to these<br/>
&gt; things to get to know people?! He didn&#39;t really have an answer except<br/>
&gt; that he has only ever camped with family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds perfectly logical to me!  I&#39;m not big on going to things where I<br/>
don&#39;t know anybody.  I have a much easier time going to something that I<br/>
only know one person in the crowd, just because I feel a little safer.<br/>
Maybe your son feels the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Can you go alone to something, perhaps not as long as the campout?  Then you<br/>
could check out the scene, talk to other parents, and maybe get a phone<br/>
number or two.  If you know people, he might be more relaxed about going.<br/>
