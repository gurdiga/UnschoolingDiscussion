<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309775722">HURRAY!  Kaycee is coming home tonight!  I AM SO GLAD.  Gosh, when they are <br/>
here, they drive you crazy.  When they aren&#39;t, they drive you crazy; especially <br/>
when they are sooooo far away!  I just can&#39;t wait till I see her face!  I <br/>
miss her so very much!  Her plane is not due to land until 10p tonight.  Let you <br/>
all know how she is/how the trip went, sometime this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, LOL, she IS NOT going to be too happy when I tell her that <br/>
Kings Island called w/her work schedule!  She is DUE IN at 10a tomorrow <br/>
(Saturday) morning.  Hmm, thank goodness she&#39;s a kid and can take this stuff!  Me?  <br/>
I&#39;d need a vacation FROM my vacation!  Then again, I&#39;m sure digging up <br/>
Dinosaurs was pretty hard on the body.  And, I&#39;M SURE, 8 teens got A LOT of sleep.  <br/>
NOT!<br/>
