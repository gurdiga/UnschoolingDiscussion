<div id="ygrps-yiv-571929033">I am still exploring unschooling and am in the midst of reading all the wonderful books that you all have suggested however I have a concern not yet answered....<br/>
<br/>
For example, today I asked my daughter to skip count with me in an effort to lean her towards learning her times tables.  I did not mention the words &quot;school&quot; nor &quot;work&quot; however she balked me the whole time and said she didn&#39;t want to do it; she was tired; she was hungry (and we had just eaten lunch!).  In other words she didn&#39;t want to do it and therefore was not going to do it.   I lost my cool and did a bad Mom thing and told her she had to do it and that was that and that in life when she&#39;s a big girl sometimes she must do the things required of her whether or not she likes it.<br/>
<br/>
Are we not teaching our children by unschooling that they can do whatever they want whenever they want and if someone says they must do something are we not perhaps &quot;crippling&quot; them to the point where they won&#39;t do what is required of them??  For example, if they grow up and their boss says, &quot;have that report on my desk tomorrow morning&quot; I&#39;m afraid my kids would say, &quot;I don&#39;t feel like it.&quot;  Life doesn&#39;t work like that!  Unfortunately life is not doing what you want whenever you want all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Am I not seeing this correctly or do you all have the same or similar concerns??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054319266">If the job is important to your dd, she will do whatever is necessary to<br/>
keep it, even getting that report on the boss&#39; desk by tomorrow morning.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think we need to make our children do unpleasant things now in order<br/>
to prepare them for unpleasantness they might run into later in life.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874077380">Well, life CAN be doing what you want IF you want it bad enough.  <br/>
<br/>
We all have the option of telling our bosses that we dont want to do <br/>
something, of course we run the risk of getting fired but the bottom <br/>
line is that (unless you&#39;re in the military) our bosses really cant <br/>
MAKE us do anything that we dont want to do.   So why DO we do <br/>
things that we arent excited about when we&#39;re working? Usually <br/>
because we like the other parts of the job...maybe the pay, the <br/>
hours, the benefits etc.  If you really think about it we ARE <br/>
choosing to do the things our bosses ask us to do, we may SAY <br/>
we &quot;have&quot; to do it but in reality we dont.  We all have the option <br/>
of telling our bosses &#39;no&#39; at any time. <br/>
In my opinion there is a huge difference between situation A: a work <br/>
situation with a boss telling us what to do, and situation B: mom <br/>
and dad telling us what to do.   Mom and Dad telling us what to do <br/>
isnt always like real life where we DO have options and can weigh <br/>
out the consequences for ourselves and make a decision.   <br/>
We can choose to break or follow laws, listen or not listen to <br/>
bosses etc and each choice has a result but in the end we&#39;re free to <br/>
make the choice.  <br/>

This particular daughter has been taking acting classes for 3 years because she wants to and she always knows her lines when she needs to for the various plays she&#39;s in.  I guess I didn&#39;t think of this when faced with a confrontation today.  I still have a lot of unschooling to do for myself but groups like this help me alot and give me the support I need.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452034266">**Are we not teaching our children by unschooling that they can do whatever <br/>

of them??**<br/>
<br/>
Apparently not. :)<br/>
<br/>
My always unschooled 20yo daughter has the strongest &quot;work ethic&quot; of all the <br/>
young adults we know, almost all of whom were well schooled in doing what they <br/>
were told. She always completes assignments on time or early for her college <br/>
classes. She meets deadlines for her job, and fulfills her responsibilities <br/>
there professionally and reliably. She&#39;s been working at the same place for 10 <br/>
years, 5 years as a volunteer and the last 5 as a paid staff member with <br/>
steadily increasing responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
My always unschooled 12yo daughter is a volunteer assistant at her dance <br/>
studio. She&#39;s never missed a day except when she was terribly ill. She&#39;s never <br/>
late - she prefers to have me wake her for early classes but always sets an alarm <br/>
for herself as a backup. Unlike her fellow (schooled) assistants, she makes <br/>
an effort to set an example by always wearing proper dance attire and not <br/>
fooling around during class.<br/>
<br/>
My always unschooled12yo son had a commitment conflict this past Saturday. <br/>
His Lego League robotics team was competing in the regionals, and he had a <br/>
rehearsal for the dance theater piece he has chorus parts in that is performing <br/>
this weekend. He attended the Robotics competition, and then when he got home he <br/>
immediately changed into his dance clothes and asked me to take him to the <br/>
studio to see if they were still rehearsing. He didn&#39;t even need to do that. <br/>
Nobody expected him to show up because he had another commitment, but he felt <br/>
strongly he should go if he could.<br/>
<br/>
A child who won&#39;t cooperate when a mom is trying to quiz her is fighting <br/>
against mistrust. Personally, I hope my kids won&#39;t decide to keep working for <br/>
people who mistrust them, but work to find (or make!) employment at things they <br/>
excell at where they will be valued and needed. The situation you described <br/>
isn&#39;t in any way comparable to the kind of requirements people face as adults.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.<br/>
People who tell their kids what to do and when and how all the time are crippling them more that those who help them decide what&#39;s important and what they want to do and when.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not theory at my house.  My two boys have never been to school and have been steeped in freedom.  They both have jobs. Both have jobs that were offered to them, they didn&#39;t apply.  They&#39;re very conscientious and well trusted.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For example, if they grow up and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their boss says, &quot;have that report on my desk tomorrow morning&quot; I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; afraid my kids would say, &quot;I don&#39;t feel like it.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jobs aren&#39;t handed out randomly.  If and when your kid grows up and takes a job (or becomes a teen and takes a job) it will be by choice, and each moment in ANY life involves a choice of what to do and whether and how.  THAT is life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  Life doesn&#39;t work <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; like that!  Unfortunately life is not doing what you want whenever you <br/>
&gt; want all the time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems you&#39;re telling us how life is as though we don&#39;t live there. <br/>
<br/>
And if you really look at what you do and why, I think you can manage to see that you ARE doing what you want to do each time you make a decision.  And it will make your life more pleasant if you can see that instead of telling yourself (and us, and your kids I&#39;m presuming) that you have to do what you don&#39;t want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something you might read about that.  Some of it came from a discussion kind of like this one.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com//unschool/haveto">http://sandradodd.com//unschool/haveto</a><br/>
<br/>
Marty will go to work because he wants to have that job.  Kirby will go and teach karate because he agreed to and the kids love him and they say so.  <br/>
I just did the dishes because I wanted to.<br/>
I want to do a load of laundry tonight because I have grout-water on my jeans.<br/>
I want to go to bed and sleep as long as possible, because tomorrow is one day I don&#39;t have a need or commitment to get up early.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to do that laundry, but I don&#39;t want my jeans to be stained and stiff.  I didn&#39;t have to do the dishes but I wanted to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, it&#39;s a very difficult concept even though it&#39;s right in our heads and our mouths and our nervous systems.  We don&#39;t do anything differently when it&#39;s realize, just feel different and *be* a different way.<br/>

I agree.  If the mother says &quot;DO&quot; and the child wishes she hadn&#39;t, the only way the child wins the battle of wills is to NOT do.  &quot;That&#39;ll show her,&quot; and when he grows up he asserts his separateness by NOT doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813639305">I went to school and I had a friend that also went to school.  We both had<br/>
part time jobs after school.  I can remember back in high school that if she<br/>
felt like blowing off work, she just called in sick. I can remember way back<br/>
then thinking that was so wrong and that I could never do that.  It wasn&#39;t<br/>
anything my parents said to me or made me do that gave me my work ethic.  It<br/>
was their example.  They always followed through on their commitments, be it<br/>
work, volunteering to do something, or just meeting friends.  They were<br/>
always on-time, even with six kids.  It was important to them and I picked<br/>
up on their attitude.  Just the other day, we were going somewhere with my<br/>
parents and my dad said, &quot;Let&#39;s go, I hate to be late.&quot;  That was the first<br/>
time I had heard it put into words, that I noticed.  I smiled and said,<br/>
&quot;gee, I guess I know where I get that from then.&quot;  :-)<br/>

joy and passion for it are dwindling.  It&#39;s time to move on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273219604"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example, today I asked my daughter to skip count with me in an effort<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to lean her towards learning her times tables.  I did not mention the words<br/>
&quot;school&quot; nor &quot;work&quot; however she balked me the whole time and said she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to do it; she was tired; she was hungry (and we had just eaten lunch!).<br/>
In other words she didn&#39;t want to do it and therefore was not going to do it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t mention school or work but you were still asking her to do work.<br/>
You were still stepping in univited to teach. If she made a couple of<br/>
excuses it sort of implies that maybe you didn&#39;t accept her first &#39;no&#39; or<br/>
didn&#39;t ask if it was something she wanted to do in the first place. If<br/>
you&#39;re thinking in terms of her having to learn the times tables you&#39;ve got<br/>
some schoolish ideas working their way out. Multiplication is a basic thing<br/>
most kids will get, and not nessacarily by way of the times table.<br/>
  If she just didn&#39;t want to do it, I think that&#39;s a good reason not to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m afraid my kids would say, &quot;I don&#39;t feel like it.&quot;  Life doesn&#39;t work<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like that!  Unfortunately life is not doing what you want whenever you want<br/>
all the time.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Life can work like that and I think it&#39;s simply (as if it&#39;s simple! :) ) a<br/>
matter of a shift in thinking. I don&#39;t do much because I &#39;have&#39; to, I do<br/>
things because I choose too or want to. I could see the pile of dishes on<br/>
the counter as something I have to do and therefore a chore or I could see<br/>
it as something I choose to do or want to do because I enjoy having the next<br/>
morning free of dishwashing.<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m making sense but it seems to me that the point of raising<br/>
your kids without the burden of &#39;having&#39; to do stuff or teaching them that<br/>
some things &#39;need&#39; to be done is to let them learn that everything can be<br/>
done with joy or at least without resentment and everything you do is a<br/>
concious choice. ANyhow, life is truly what you make it and you can make it<br/>
about choices or you can make it about chores. I think if you really throw<br/>
yourself into unschooling you&#39;ll find it&#39;s a great way to help your kids<br/>
(and yourself) learn that life is about choices.<br/>
  Good luck!<br/>

 <br/>
My friend Jerome was sexually molested by a priest, many times, starting  <br/>
when he was seven years old.  He had been told to do what adults told him,  and <br/>
to ALWAYS obey the priests and nuns.<br/>
 <br/>
He thought he was doing right by doing what the priest said to do.<br/>
 <br/>
My son who is 18 has had a job for four and a half years, the same  job.  <br/>
Retail work in a gaming shop.  He has twice refused to do  something he thought <br/>
was wrong.  Once it was to stock bumper stickers that  were rudely anti-France, <br/>
right after the business with Iraq began.  He said  it wasn&#39;t right to put <br/>
those out, and he won the issue.  He could have just  done what he was told to <br/>
do.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son who is 16 is never late to his newer job, and has brought work home  <br/>
to do while watching videos.  He is conscientious and responsible.<br/>
 <br/>
How could that be, if it&#39;s necessary to tell kids what to do so that they  <br/>
will be good employees later?  Without me &quot;job training&quot; my children, they  are <br/>
good employees *now.*<br/>
 <br/>
Proof that one does not &quot;have to&quot; do X,Y&Z to ensure that children do  well <br/>
at jobs is important information.  Reminders that too much obedience  and <br/>
orders-following can lead to disaster is just as important to  remember.<br/>

Many parents expect their children to respond to the parent&#39;s request with no hesitation and no questions asked, because the parent is the authority.  They also instruct their children to OBEY other authority figures.  How do these children learn WHEN it is OK to think for themselves?<br/>

Yes, and like it or not, some of the mothers who helped create that  <br/>
obedience find later that their children submitted in obedience to the sexual  <br/>
advances of the father or stepfather or minister at church or a teacher.<br/>
 <br/>
Unthinking obedience is a dangerous thing, and not a gift to give a  child.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Extending things to an extreme point is a way of seeing the essence of <br/>
something. It is a useful way to examine a situation - helps us to <br/>
think more clearly about concepts.<br/>
<br/>
Examining how two things are different is also useful.<br/>
<br/>
So - a more useful response would have been to show that you&#39;ve <br/>
understood the point and then argue it, if you disagree.<br/>
<br/>
For example (I don&#39;t even actually disagree with the point - but I can <br/>
still make a case for the other side just to illustrate what it might <br/>
look like - I mean, it isn&#39;t like I think there is NO merit to the <br/>
other side &lt;G&gt;):<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what you could have said:<br/>
<br/>
*********<br/>
So, you&#39;re saying that if a kid learns that they should do things <br/>
whether they want to or not, if they learn to be obedient and follow <br/>
directions even when they don&#39;t want to do so, that they&#39;ll not be able <br/>
to use their judgment about doing what a boss says, in the future, and <br/>
they&#39;ll submit to their boss&#39;s orders to do things that are <br/>
inappropriate or wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Submitting to sexual advances by a boss is very different than getting <br/>
a report done on command. I expect my child to know the difference <br/>
between doing things they just don&#39;t &quot;feel like&quot; doing versus doing <br/>
things that are outright wrong. I&#39;m not saying kids should be taught <br/>
not to ever use their judgment, but that &quot;I don&#39;t happen to feel like <br/>
it right now&quot; isn&#39;t a ALWAYS necessarily a good reason not to do <br/>
something.<br/>

Today we had a fire drill at school.  Not a fire drill, I think there <br/>
wasa problem in the kitchen, we were out a very short time, and the <br/>
drill happened during passing period.  It was very confusing and my <br/>
class (well, probably all classes) did not file out orderly, it was too <br/>
confusing.  My students are supposed to go down one set of stairs to an <br/>
oustide door but the stairs go down further to the basement. Another <br/>
adult told them to keep going, and they did.  They weren&#39;t supposed to, <br/>
they knew they were supposed to go out the first door but they all <br/>
listened to the adult even though the adult was wrong.  We talked about <br/>
it afterwards, about blindly obeying, and how I want them to question <br/>
authority, even me, and to stand up for what they know is right.  The <br/>
kids should have said NO, we go out this door.  But they&#39;ve been taught <br/>
to blindly obey.  If this had been a real fire or emergency, it could <br/>
have been bad, I could have not known where some kids were, they should <br/>
have exited the building immediately and not gone further into it, etc. <br/>

they knew they were supposed to go out the first door  but they all <br/>
listened to the adult even though the adult was  wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
That is just completely frightening.  <br/>
 <br/>
Did anyone identify the other adult so the person could realize what they  <br/>
could have caused?<br/>

My  students are supposed to go down one set of stairs to an <br/>
oustide door but  the stairs go down further to the basement. Another <br/>
adult told them to  keep going, and they did. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you talked to the other adult in no uncertain terms.<br/>
Sending kids to the basement of a flaming building would potentially be  <br/>
prison-sentence stuff.<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe it should be put in writing and be the subject of discussion at the  <br/>
next faculty meeting.  I SO would not let that go by.<br/>
 <br/>
The fire-escape and fire-drill in this country is NOT new, and not  optional. <br/>
 That stuns me that the kids were hesitant (it&#39;s half a  schoolyear in) and <br/>
that an adult was unsure.<br/>
 <br/>
But then maybe emergency exits are an easy thing for me, and I almost  always <br/>
am aware of where they are, whatever kind of building I&#39;m in.<br/>
 <br/>
That is a HECK of a good example of what teaching a child obedience can do,  <br/>
though.  If the kid is more afraid of disobeying an adult than of staying  in <br/>
a burning building (theoretically burning or really burning), then that  <br/>
obedience has become a life-threatening condition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977211430">&lt;&lt;How could that be, if it&#39;s necessary to tell kids what to do so that they<br/>
will be good employees later?  Without me &quot;job training&quot; my children, they  are<br/>
good employees *now.*&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sixteen year old dd who was unschooled started working at a sub<br/>
shop last May when she was 15.  She was rapidly promoted to full-time,<br/>
given a key over other long term workers after working there less than<br/>
a month although they had to bend a rule not letting workers under 18<br/>
have keys, and before the end of the summer was the main daytime shift<br/>
supervisor.<br/>
<br/>
She started working so that she could save money to record a demo<br/>
album which she did.  But she also has found that she really likes her<br/>
job and that she has a knack for business and management.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, the owners called her in for a meeting and said that she<br/>
is a better worker, smarter, and has better ethics than any other<br/>
employee (they own 5 shops.)  They want her to start on a manager<br/>
training track, and she is very excited about it.  The funny thing is<br/>
relatives and friends keep going on and on about how she&#39;s not going<br/>
to college right now.  She is only 16!!!  She is having fun!  She is<br/>
doing what she wants!  And I certainly don&#39;t think that being<br/>
unschooled crippled her job skills in anyway.  *g*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881708047">I think that was a great success story.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
-=-The  funny thing is<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
And this is not to suggest that I think this is as &quot;far&quot; as she could or  <br/>
should go, but she&#39;s doing the kind of job adults with families do.  It&#39;s a  &quot;kid <br/>
job&quot; insofar as it&#39;s a job kids move in and out of pretty easily, but she  is <br/>
not DOING a &quot;kids&#39; job.&quot;  She&#39;s working at a management level at the age  <br/>
other kids are having to quit because school started again.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby and the gaming shop is kind of like that.  Yeah, they try hard  to keep <br/>
him under 20 hours a week, and he&#39;s only had two dinky raises in four  and a <br/>
half years, but:  he&#39;s the youngest employee, too.  That means  that every <br/>
other human working there (there are six others and the boss).   A couple <br/>
(manager and owner) are working full time and I don&#39;t know  what they make, but they <br/>
work where Kirby works and they have car payments and  mortgage payments and <br/>
whatnot.  It probably won&#39;t be Kirby&#39;s job for life,  but there are people <br/>
there who are 30 and 40 years old.<br/>
 <br/>
They trust him with the whole store and all the money all the time.   When <br/>
they&#39;re doing &quot;remote&quot; things (tournaments at hotels and such) they send  him on <br/>
important errands.  The first time I knew he had been entrusted with  the <br/>
cash to get it off site, it was hundreds of dollars and he was 15 and not  <br/>
driving yet.  I picked him up and he told me what he had so I wouldn&#39;t  throw it <br/>
away or anything, as it was in a crackers-and-cheese box.<br/>
 <br/>
Funky as it is, I see it as success. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760721758">Okay I know this is a little bit of an oldish thread but I&#39;m just <br/>
getting to it. Anyhow, last night, my 6 1/2 yr old sat at the table <br/>
waiting his turn in a board game, merrily &quot;skip counting&quot; by twos <br/>
(2,4,6,8...) He got to 20 and said that was as high as he could go. <br/>
I said That&#39;s cool. You know, over 20 the numbers work the same as <br/>
regular counting even when you count by 2s. He paused a second, then <br/>
continued and stopped at 60 because it was his turn and that had <br/>
priority. We have never yet sat him down to &quot;study&quot; or &quot;practice&quot; <br/>
skip counting. When we play Shrek Monopoly Jr, he has seen us do it <br/>
because there are $2 bills in the game and when we add up who has <br/>
how much money we count 2,4,6,8... Right now his head is full of <br/>
numbers (by his report). 6 months ago it was full of something else <br/>
and 6 months from now it will be something else again.<br/>
<br/>
I second what others have said about work responsibility - we really <br/>
do have a lot of choices as adults. You don&#39;t even HAVE TO pay <br/>
taxes - but there are consequences to that you might not like. You <br/>
don&#39;t HAVE TO obey speed limits, but there are consequences. You can <br/>
miss meetings and deadlines and you&#39;ll probably end up looking for <br/>
another job - but as an adult you can CHOOSE to go ahead and look <br/>
for something else, take an unemployment &quot;vacation&quot;, seek out ways <br/>
to change careers, etc. A child, sitting across from a parent, being <br/>
told &quot;You can&#39;t do x,y,z UNTIL you do this that I&#39;ve determined&quot; has <br/>
very few options and most of them come with undesirable consequences.</div>

I have a ticket to pay, sitting in the back room.  Thanks for the reminder.  <br/>
Friday night on the way home from the folk singing party, the week Cameron <br/>
was visiting.  50 in a 35.  The guy called it 45 to be nice.  Corrales, New <br/>
Mexico.  Don&#39;t speed there.  The village has little other source of income.<br/>
<br/>
I could choose not to mail that in, but I could end up being arrested the <br/>
next time I&#39;m stopped for anything, and that doesn&#39;t sound at ALL fun, so I am <br/>
going to choose to mail that in.<br/>
