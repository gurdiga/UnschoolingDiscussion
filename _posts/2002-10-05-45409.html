&lt;&lt; Can you describe how you do that? In enough detail that we could do it? Or <br/>
 send us to someplace that has enough description of a method that you think <br/>
 would really work? <br/>
 <br/>
 How much time does it take for how big a dome? How many kids? How old and <br/>
how <br/>
 hard is it really, to do it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whoa girl!! Too many questions this early in the A.M. :)<br/>
ok, I could probably describe it, but don&#39;t know if it would make sense....so <br/>
here&#39;s a link that will take you to some newspaper projects including the <br/>
dome.<br/>
2-3 kids can fit inside of it.<br/>
You have to make a bunch of newspaper logs, which is the time consuming part.<br/>
But it&#39;s really cool, and a great fort that is totally recyclable and <br/>
reusable, with totally free materials!!<br/>
And now I&#39;ve given away my secret for the workshop, dang! You all better come <br/>
say hi anyway!! hehe<br/>

did.  Here&#39;s the url for the one we made, in case anyone wants to try it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259065222">Thank you Ren for this,  I had no idea what a geodesic dome even was, I&#39;m anxious to look into doing it.  And I can&#39;t go to the conference so, thanks!<br/>
