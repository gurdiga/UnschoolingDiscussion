<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819748855">Thank you for your reply Lisa<br/>
<br/>
Tutoring or home school I think my main goal is to have a smaller group<br/>
setting like 10 or fewer children.<br/>
I am also a working single mom so I need some assistance to give instruction<br/>
during the working day.  <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking maybe there is stay at home mom or such with previous<br/>
experience in individualized teaching/instruction.  I just don&#39;t know where<br/>
I would find something like that.  So I looked for some email lists and<br/>
different orgs that people may belong to.  That would be wonderful if anyone<br/>
could provide any help.<br/>
<br/>
thank you!<br/>

I doubt  you will find what you are looking for on this list as it is an <br/>
unschooling list. . . a support forum for people who are not sending their <br/>
young people to school and are not using any instructional type material. In <br/>
other words, we would not be giving our children instructions on what, how, <br/>
when to learn things. . . we learn all the time. Also, if you decided to <br/>
unschool (if you wanted to learn more about it) you would have plenty time <br/>
during your off hours for learning opportunities with your children. . . that <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to happen only when you are working outside the home. I know <br/>
there are women on the list who do work outside the home and are still <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as far schools, the closest to unschooling you would find would be a <br/>
free school, and then after that I suspect Waldorf, then Montessori. I don&#39;t <br/>
know if they have those types where you are or not. Where I live all those <br/>
options are available (Philadelphia area). Wish I knew more to help out.<br/>

Mary Griffiths (anyone correct me if I&#39;m wrong) wrote a book called &quot;The <br/>
Unschooling Handbook&quot; which I just loved.  Spend as much time as you can <br/>
researching unschooling and you might find that you love it.  <br/>
