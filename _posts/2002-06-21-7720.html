<div id="ygrps-yiv-569564070">We have a new family member!<br/>
A kitten!<br/>
She&#39;s fluffy, white, blue eyed, has 6 toes on her front paws and is <br/>
absolutely adorable.<br/>
Tamzin has continued with the fruit theme (our other cat is <br/>
named Apple) and has named her Coconut.<br/>
Apple is not impressed with the new arrival, but the dogs have <br/>
taken her arrival in stride.  Angel (the big lab/retriver mix) is <br/>
positively in love with her - very cute -.  She follows her <br/>
everywhere and lays down beside her when she sleeps.<br/>
Two of Tamzin&#39;s friends are sleeping over tonight and they&#39;ve just  <br/>
come into the room pushing her doll stroller with, you guessed it, <br/>
Coconut in it.  She&#39;s a very tolerant and maleable little kitten &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
