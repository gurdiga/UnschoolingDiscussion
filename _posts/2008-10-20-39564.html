<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814967622">I hope this is ok to post here..I&#39;m new and have been doing a lot of <br/>
reading and think I&#39;ve looked for this topic but may have missed it.  I <br/>
have a 6yo ds and a 2 yo dd.  I&#39;ve been starting to implement an <br/>
unschooling lifestyle and am really excited to see the results I&#39;ve <br/>
been reading about...my dh wants to join the yahoo group for <br/>
unschooling dads!  Anyway, my question pertains to my 2yo dd.  I&#39;ve let <br/>
go of my food control issues with both of my kids (today) but want to <br/>
make sure that my little one is good to go with this...will she balance <br/>
out like I believe my older one will?  In other words, she ate candy <br/>
all day today :) and, as she is just 2, will she be as likely to <br/>
balance out as my son at this age?  thanks so much!! <br/>

More likely, but I don&#39;t think &quot;letting go&quot; all at once (as in &quot;eat  <br/>
whatever you want; I don&#39;t care anymore&quot; or any version of that) is  <br/>
as fun as saying &quot;Yes!&quot; or &quot;Why not?&quot; or &quot;Do you want more?&quot;  or &quot;You  <br/>
don&#39;t have to eat that if you don&#39;t want to&quot; several times a day for  <br/>
weeks.<br/>
