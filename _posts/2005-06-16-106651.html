<div id="ygrps-yiv-996830561">I&#39;ve lost track of where the original post is (sorry I&#39;m not so good <br/>
with this stuff yet!)....and I had posted a response, but wanted to <br/>
mention something else.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter who is extremely particular about her food, used to <br/>
have &quot;meltdowns&quot; before we realized how badly lack of food, or too <br/>
much sugar would affect her. At one point - I think she was about 3 or <br/>
4, I gave her a sandwich when she was really losing control. She felt <br/>
better after a couple bites and was restored to &quot;normalcy&quot;...she <br/>
called it a &quot;magic sandwhich&quot; and still at 6 years will refer to it as <br/>
such. And at times when she&#39;s been unreasonable, she&#39;ll reflect on it <br/>
later and mention how she hadn&#39;t had anything good to eat that day (or <br/>
whatever). <br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling nutrition is amazing...;)</div>
