<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466116408">Well - seems I&#39;ve started myself a little project! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m creating not just a LIST of states where unschooling is  <br/>
relatively hassle-free, but an &quot;annotated&quot; list of such states which  <br/>
may also include contact information.<br/>
<br/>
So - here is what I need from all of you who know about your own states:<br/>
<br/>
1. Email me OFFLIST --- please!!<br/>
<br/>
2. Put your state in the subject line<br/>
<br/>
3. Write a very short blurb (paragraph or two) telling what people  <br/>
have to do, to be legal, to unschool in your state.<br/>
<br/>
4. Provide state support organization information if the organization  <br/>
is friendly to unschoolers. Provide your OWN information as a contact  <br/>
person ONLY if you&#39;re willing to have that information posted on a  <br/>
website and have people contact you for state-level information.  <br/>
EMAIL only, please.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want this to all be on the list --- but I&#39;ll post updates and  <br/>
tell you what states I still need information for --- right now I  <br/>
need information for all states other than Texas, California, and  <br/>
South Carolina.  So - if you live in any other state, please send me  <br/>
the info.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
