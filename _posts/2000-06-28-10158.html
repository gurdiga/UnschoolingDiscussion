Hi Dawn!<br/>
<br/>
   Unschooling really came into focus for me when my son became interested in <br/>
dinosaurs.  I made it my job to look for all the dinosaur resources that were <br/>
available to us.  My computer is hooked up with my library, so I spent quite <br/>
a while reserving every dino book, video or audio tape I could find.  When <br/>
all this bounty came in, I left it up to my son what to do with them.  Some <br/>
of the books I really liked were ignored completely by him.  I looked at them <br/>
myself and then took them back.  Some of the resources I didn&#39;t think were as <br/>
good were the ones Colton poured over for hours.  I just littered his path <br/>
with opportunities, and let him take it from there.<br/>
<br/>
   I had a successful idea of a way to learn about dinosaurs while catering <br/>
to one of Colton&#39;s big passions these days, trading cards.  I found a dino <br/>
trading card game that came with a large stack of informative cards.  We <br/>
played the game as per the instructions, but Colton played with it in other <br/>
ways as well.  He would sort the cards into carnivores and herbivores, or <br/>
sort them by time period.  In a short amount of time, while having an <br/>
absolute ball, Colton learned a wealth of information about the topic, <br/>
because he wanted to, and for his own reasons.<br/>
<br/>
   I also took him to our local Science Center for Dino Days and to see an <br/>
IMAX 3-D movie about T-Rex.  In addition, we purchased a set of five computer <br/>
programs about dinos.  I offered these activities and things before I <br/>
invested in them; if Colton hadn&#39;t been interested, that would have been OK.<br/>
<br/>
   Lately, Colton has gotten back into Harry Potter again, and we&#39;ve reread <br/>
the books together.  He is now making his own set of Harry Potter trading <br/>
cards.  I am sure more activities will follow, and I am happy to go along for <br/>
the ride.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849709533">Hi Dawn. It sounds to me like you have a kid with a good attention span who <br/>
is going to stay with a subject until he gets all he needs from it. My 9 <br/>
year old will get intensely interested in a topic, perhaps spending weeks <br/>
reading about space, or doing math squares, or drawing or just playing <br/>
Pokemon. When he gets his fill, he moves on. Sometimes he comes back to it <br/>
later, sometimes not. It has been great watching the way he learns so <br/>
naturally and is so self directed. It is not this way for all kids, so trust <br/>
him and be grateful. As for repetition, remember when you had to read the <br/>
same story over and over, or play peek-a-boo for ever? The best answer I <br/>
have found for this one is to have more kids-the older ones can take turns <br/>
with the repetitive things and none of us get as tired of it!!<br/>
<br/>
Cathie-who just last nite had to decide if we should make the 3 year old get <br/>
off the computer at 10 p.m. or go to bed and leave her there!!<br/>

Thanks for clarifying your intentions... Yes you are right... tensions have <br/>
been high and without the ability to &quot;sense&quot; what people are saying and how <br/>

If you sit down and really think about it, doesn&#39;t Zak know an awful lot <br/>
already?  The reason I ask this is because I found it fairly easy to trust <br/>
that my son was learning on his own.  He had always been interested in <br/>
trains and I know how much he learned about them.  I also know all of the <br/>
other concepts he learned because of trains (counting cars, physics of how <br/>
steam powers engines, etc.) and he would play with trains for hours on end.  <br/>
But the knowledge that came from that interest was endless.  Now he has <br/>
moved on to Skyscrapers and Bridges, Star Wars, Space Program.  It all does <br/>
happen and it is a miracle to watch...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326994805">Dawn,<br/>
i figured when i started h/schooling almost 7 yrs. ago that i would borrow <br/>
the good from ps and leave out the bad. therefore, i try to allow free time <br/>
to play with whatever toys, puzzles, games, etc. as much as possible. we do a <br/>
lot of activities outside the house with 3 of my 4 being &quot;school-age&quot;:13, 8, <br/>
& 5, so inside the house we have down time unless we are doing a unit study <br/>
together or my 2 older sons are working on some math or Bible or English with <br/>
me 1 on 1 (a few times a week). no tv and no vcr and no computer unless <br/>
requested and earned-chores and lessons done. i do what the schools do to <br/>
control to some extent with which toys the children play: i rotate them in <br/>
and out of the toy closet and i leave out and available different learning <br/>
materials-# balancing scale, magnet set, dominoes, etc. all of the toys and <br/>
art supplies and books are on shelves at their level, though, so they can <br/>
pull out something i put away if they really want it. if i see only 1 kind of <br/>
play going on for a long time and not getting more complicated or involving <br/>
anyone else, then i might suggest a supplement to the activity: dressing up <br/>
as the character in the game or activity, involving me or a sibling in the <br/>
game, or writing a story-dictated-about the play. i don&#39;t make the popular <br/>
game/activity vanish, but i will try to move it to a new location.<br/>

our 4+ yos has done this a number of time.  what we did was - gave a <br/>
flash light, showed him the lights switches he would need to turn off, <br/>
reminded him to go to the bathroom .  we ran through the procedure 4 x <br/>
then went to bed. some nights he stayed up &#39;til 1 am but he was happy <br/>
w/ his independence and handled it just fine.  he did this maybe 1/2 <br/>
dozen times for a few months but has not done it for many months now, <br/>

&gt; Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; Questions I have... How do you get comfortable with letting them do <br/>
 </span></blockquote>whatever they want, whenever they want. <br/>
<br/>
i struggled w/ this. my son is only 4 so i don&#39;t have long-term <br/>
experience but what i ran into is,  for example he would ask for <br/>
something like he wanted to learn math so we looked into all kinds <br/>
ways of learning math and he picked out miqoun/cuisenaire rods.  so we <br/>
got a set - books & rods - and he would not sit down and do it.   <br/>
though he continued to ask to be taught math.  i got frustrated <br/>
because i had bought this material and thought &#39;we should use it&#39; but <br/>
when i thought about it for a bit i realized it has nothing to do with <br/>
the money or if and when he uses the material.  it has to do w/ <br/>
enjoying what you have and playing with it.  i believe he will use any <br/>
and all material he asks for, be it today or years from now.  so i <br/>
would say yes let them do whatever they want and try to join in if <br/>
they let you and you want to, or just do your thing near by.  but most <br/>
importantly listen to them, trust them and have fun w/ them.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; started was this something you had to deal with in yourselves or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>were you ok with whatever happened.  <br/>
<br/>
rene&#39; seem to go through phases where he does the same thing over and <br/>
over like he&#39;ll play on the computer for long periods then he won&#39;t go <br/>
near it for long periods, or it could be legos or chemistry <br/>
experiments or whatever catches his fancy.  but everything he does he <br/>
enjoys and what he builds for example becomes more and more intricate <br/>
and fascinating.  i would recommending reading some of the material <br/>
they have available online at sudbury valley school (if you need the <br/>
addy i can get it for you).  it really helped me relax and stop <br/>
focusing on &#39;results&#39; and trust in the nature craving for learning <br/>
that children have.<br/>

problem w/ reading books - i just can&#39;t take reading the same book <br/>
over and over again.  luckily my dh doesn&#39;t mind so rene&#39; gets books <br/>
read over and over by him.  but since i like to read to him in the <br/>
morning i tried to get him to choose chapter books to read but he <br/>
refused. so what i did , just a few weeks ago, was pick a book - <br/>
&quot;carry on mr bowditch&quot;  (a book he had choosen to buy but would not <br/>
let me read him) - and i told him i was reading this myself and that i <br/>
would be happy to read it out loud if he wanted me too and he said <br/>
sure.  now he not only happily listens but actually asks me to read <br/>
another chapter.  so this way we&#39;re both happy!<br/>

place I started looking was on line for alternative schools.  We even thought <br/>
about moving to Northern California (my fav place in the world) so that Zak <br/>
could go to a democratic school... Then we thought about the family <br/>
experience of his grandma and grandpa that he would lose.  (mum and dad <br/>
wouldn&#39;t move there if you paid them and I have no idea why)..  <br/>
<br/>
I think you hit the nail on the head when you said &quot;results&quot;  I think I need <br/>
to look at that idea that I want to see some kind of concrete results instead <br/>
of trusting the process and seeing what happens and the &quot;result&quot; maybe that I <br/>
become not so neurotic about everything in life(LOL)... So there&#39;s a benefit <br/>
for all of us in this family.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, again, much thanks for the input.  I&#39;ve printed off your e-mail for <br/>
hubby to read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553150624">I have the same trouble with the two girls.  We have a routine that they go <br/>
to bed after dinner, bath, and a story. (And Most nights a big fight)  But I <br/>
sometimes feel that they should decide when bedtime would be and we wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have such a fight on our hands.  On the other hand....I REALLY NEED THEIR <br/>
SLEEP some nights.   My husband is a staunch &quot;kids in bed by 8&quot;  kind of guy <br/>
but I was always happiest as a child when I picked my bedtime so this leaves <br/>
me confused.   I&#39;d love to hear everyone elses bedtime routines too.<br/>

kids pick bedtime alone)<br/>

I know that you were responding to Dawns questions but I think that you gave <br/>
some great advice so Thanks!  Also I&#39;d love that webpage you were talking <br/>
about for Sudbury Valley School too!  Lili is 4 and I am new to Unschooling <br/>
so It was nice to see just how someone else does it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;From: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NumoAstro@...">NumoAstro@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi All:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; Questions I have... How do you get comfortable with letting them do<br/>
&gt;whatever they want, whenever they want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i struggled w/ this. my son is only 4 so i don&#39;t have long-term<br/>
&gt;experience but what i ran into is,  for example he would ask for<br/>
&gt;something like he wanted to learn math so we looked into all kinds<br/>
&gt;ways of learning math and he picked out miqoun/cuisenaire rods.  so we<br/>
&gt;got a set - books & rods - and he would not sit down and do it.<br/>
&gt;though he continued to ask to be taught math.  i got frustrated<br/>
&gt;because i had bought this material and thought &#39;we should use it&#39; but<br/>
&gt;when i thought about it for a bit i realized it has nothing to do with<br/>
&gt;the money or if and when he uses the material.  it has to do w/<br/>
&gt;enjoying what you have and playing with it.  i believe he will use any<br/>
&gt;and all material he asks for, be it today or years from now.  so i<br/>
&gt;would say yes let them do whatever they want and try to join in if<br/>
&gt;they let you and you want to, or just do your thing near by.  but most<br/>
&gt;importantly listen to them, trust them and have fun w/ them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Zak at the moment spends hours on the same thing and I worry that<br/>
&gt;he&#39;ll never give up building or playing on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; computer or doing whatever it is he&#39;s doing.  Is this something that<br/>
&gt;comes over time.  When some of your first<br/>
&gt; &gt; started was this something you had to deal with in yourselves or<br/>
&gt;were you ok with whatever happened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;rene&#39; seem to go through phases where he does the same thing over and<br/>
&gt;over like he&#39;ll play on the computer for long periods then he won&#39;t go<br/>
&gt;near it for long periods, or it could be legos or chemistry<br/>
&gt;experiments or whatever catches his fancy.  but everything he does he<br/>
&gt;enjoys and what he builds for example becomes more and more intricate<br/>
&gt;and fascinating.  i would recommending reading some of the material<br/>
&gt;they have available online at sudbury valley school (if you need the<br/>
&gt;addy i can get it for you).  it really helped me relax and stop<br/>
&gt;focusing on &#39;results&#39; and trust in the nature craving for learning<br/>
&gt;that children have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What if the something includes you doing things over and over again?<br/>
&gt;  How involved are you in what they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;if you like it - very involved; if you have no desire to be doing it-<br/>
&gt;as little as you can get away with :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; All day, when they ask?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;no:) i&#39;m a firm believer in honesty and independence&lt;g&gt;.  if they need<br/>
&gt;help - yes, but if they can manage it on their own- no.  i have this<br/>
&gt;problem w/ reading books - i just can&#39;t take reading the same book<br/>
&gt;over and over again.  luckily my dh doesn&#39;t mind so rene&#39; gets books<br/>
&gt;read over and over by him.  but since i like to read to him in the<br/>
&gt;morning i tried to get him to choose chapter books to read but he<br/>
&gt;refused. so what i did , just a few weeks ago, was pick a book -<br/>
&gt;&quot;carry on mr bowditch&quot;  (a book he had choosen to buy but would not<br/>
&gt;let me read him) - and i told him i was reading this myself and that i<br/>
&gt;would be happy to read it out loud if he wanted me too and he said<br/>
&gt;sure.  now he not only happily listens but actually asks me to read<br/>
&gt;another chapter.  so this way we&#39;re both happy!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Feedback would be great.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421224908">I understand exactly what you are saying.  My husband and I find that we <br/>
only have a &quot;private&quot; life after 1am most of the time.  Luckily, we are all <br/>
night owls and he requires minimal sleep.  I, on the other hand, just sleep <br/>
in with the kids (who of course, sleep until 10 am or later since they <br/>
stayed up so late)  Some nights, when we are craving each other&#39;s company, <br/>
we will bathe them early and put them to bed.  This works especially if I <br/>
have to work outside of the home and don&#39;t get home until after dh has them <br/>
in bed.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with whatever you decide.  This is what is working for us right <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Bonnie - who has had a lot of afternoon romps when kids are watching movies <br/>
or outside playing with friends ;)<br/>
