<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105052749">Hi! I know I&#39;m supposed to wait a week or two, but I just joined <br/>
this list an hour or so ago and have been reading dozens of posts <br/>
and I would like to post now, if that&#39;s okay!! :) <br/>
<br/>
First of all, I appreciate the information and advice that is out <br/>
there... I think this list is a wonderful resource! Thank you to all <br/>
the members who take time to put your thoughts into words. This has <br/>
been very helpful to me already!! <br/>
<br/>
Second, my question: my husband and I have been considering HS for a <br/>
long time now... years, really. My son is in First Grade. For a lot <br/>
of reasons I won&#39;t go into at the moment, we thought it would be a <br/>
good idea to try PS. Well, it wasn&#39;t a good experience, and we <br/>
pulled him out... today! What I am hoping some of you might be able <br/>
to help me with (though there will be plenty more in the future!!) <br/>
is how to deal with unsupportive family members. My husband&#39;s family <br/>
is all relatively nearby and are very capable of letting us know <br/>
that this is way, way too hard for us to handle. Educating our own <br/>
child. Apparently, this is a task best left to &quot;professionals.&quot; Only <br/>
the &quot;professionals&quot; were throwing up their hands! <br/>
<br/>
I am hoping to respond to them in a positive, constructive, and <br/>
ultimately pursuasive way. Is that possible? I&#39;m wondering (hoping) <br/>
someone might have had a similar experience. <br/>
<br/>
Well, gotta run! Eyes are getting blurry here!! LOL! Thanks in <br/>
advance for any help! <br/>
<br/>

Just keep telling them this in one form or another.  Otherwise, just hang up <br/>
on &#39;em if they keep giving you grief.  I mean, have some boundaries.  <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/board-topics.html">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/board-topics.html</a><br/>
<br/>
and scroll down to the heading &quot;Dealing with Reluctance&quot; you&#39;ll find <br/>
archives of many discussions about dealing with reluctant family members.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this will help you.<br/>
<br/>
Two things that I think help are (1) being confident in your choices so <br/>
you don&#39;t look like an easy target for bullies.  And (2) Being able to <br/>
hear a person out and nod pleasantly and maybe thank them for caring <br/>
without feeling like you actually need to TAKE their advice.  This <br/>
second one can be very hard, as some shocked family members will say <br/>
very intrusive and insulting things.  Either call them on it or let it <br/>
roll off.<br/>

Stalling tactics work best, and soothing reassurance that if it&#39;s not working <br/>
you&#39;ll put him back in school.  Just make sure it stays where they know that <br/>
YOU are the judges of whether it&#39;s working.   <br/>
<br/>
Instead of saying &quot;He&#39;ll never see the inside of another school&quot; say &quot;We&#39;re <br/>
going to try this for a while and see how it goes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then they can have hope that you&#39;ll fail. &lt;g&gt;  But what usually happens is <br/>
that the kid wins them over.<br/>

Tonight we visited my husband&#39;s grandmother (great-grandmother to <br/>
our kids) and lo-and-behold when I broke the news that we had pulled <br/>
him out of school, she said, &quot;Oh, I have met a woman who has a 6yo <br/>
son in first grade (like Joel) who had to pull her son out, too. He <br/>
and the teacher were just like this...&quot; and she put her two fists <br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
Funny, she&#39;s been the most vocal about her doubts about <br/>
homeschooling, but she has met someone who obviously she thinks <br/>
highly of who has decided to do this, so now it&#39;s okay! LOL! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad. It will make things easier. I think. I hope! :) <br/>

this Home school thing&quot; And she doesnt even know that we dont do book work <br/>

plan to NOT tell anyone about the unschooling. My MIL doesnt even know we <br/>

I never have a good come back!<br/>
I did ask her tonight to start buying Austyn ( age Almost 9) some books that <br/>
he might like - Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Dragon Ball Z, ect.... He NEEDS to read <br/>

I think you will find that your relatives will know at least one family who<br/>
is homeschooling. They may be doing it &quot;differently&quot; than you ... either<br/>
more structure or less or using more &quot;stuff&quot; than you ... but at least they<br/>
will have heard of it and hopefully in a positive light. :)<br/>
<br/>
I made the decision to homeschool when my oldest was 1.  My mom was not all<br/>
that supportive, but then again, I was already doing &quot;weird&quot; (AP) things<br/>
anyway so she was getting used to me. She then was invited over for dinner<br/>
with a family who homeschooled 10 kids!  The 15 yo did ALL the cooking and<br/>
meal planning, down to making the grocery list (and he was a he!) and my mom<br/>
was just so impressed.  She does quiz me sometimes and at one point in the<br/>
past few months, it was a VERY good thing she lives 6 hours away as I was<br/>
about to throttle her ... but we always seem to move beyond it.  I know she<br/>
would like to see more &quot;structure&quot; in our lives in many ways, not just<br/>
schooling so I try to avoid complaining about things where I think she will<br/>
just suggest that. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and enjoy the ride!<br/>

LOL, I&#39;ve never known a child to forget how to read.  Reading is a skill that <br/>
most people use so often.  My 7 year old dd recently started really reading, <br/>
and she said to me, &quot;Mom, I just can&#39;t help myself from reading everything I <br/>
see. [she was referring to signs and written stuff you see outside]  The words <br/>
just pop into my head.  Only a little while ago I didn&#39;t really even notice <br/>
them.&quot;<br/>

He would forget how to say words he knew quite well it was odd.<br/>
