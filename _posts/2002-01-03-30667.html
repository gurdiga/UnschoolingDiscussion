<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481037719">I accidenatlly deleted my digest -LOL! - so I can only respond to the one<br/>
message I remember clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Nicki,<br/>
YOu asked about PCOS symptoms.....it&#39;s polycystic ovarian syndrome.  I found<br/>
the site www.soulcysters.com  to have lots of info and links with good<br/>
articles and research.  The symptoms I can think of off the topof my head<br/>
include......Irregular menstrual cycles (Under 21 days or over 35 or very<br/>
unpredictable,  hirutism (excess facial hair),  male pattern baldness,<br/>
miscarriages and/or ovarian infertility (due to not ovulating),  obesity -<br/>
sugar cravings and excessive appetite,  difficulty losing weight;  mood<br/>
swings.  This syndrome can lead to type II diabetes, cardiovascular<br/>
problems, obesity.<br/>
    The body is not managing hormone levels well.  The increased<br/>
testosterone caauses the increase in facial hair.  The insulin resistance<br/>
causes sugar cravings,  inability to process insulin...leading to obesity.<br/>
    Apparently,  it is an autosomal dominant trait.  First degree relatives<br/>
in one study had a 61% chance to have the syndrome.<br/>
