<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847180889">I agree that children actually notice things for themselves more than<br/>
they repeat what they have heard.  We have strived really hard to bring<br/>
up our children to accept all human beings according to their actions,<br/>
not the way they look on the outside.  Yet recently my daughter started<br/>
saying that fat people were not allowed in her club.  She doesn&#39;t have a<br/>
club but that is the phrase she used.  I asked her why and she said<br/>
being fat wasn&#39;t good.  I talked to her about how different we all are<br/>
but I can&#39;t figure out where she got the idea that fat people were<br/>
unacceptable.  I even explained that there are a lot of people thinner<br/>
than me and some thin people would call me fat but to her that is just<br/>
not going to happen (it&#39;s nice to be loved :-)) but still can&#39;t figure<br/>
out where the notion came from.  I could blame it on something she heard<br/>
but I can&#39;t be sure that it isn&#39;t something she decided herself.  We&#39;ve<br/>
always tried to answer questions straightforward and when she notices<br/>
differences we discuss it.  It just kind of came out of the blue<br/>
recently and shocked me.  I guess I didn&#39;t expect it.  <br/>
 <br/>
One funny thing when Isabel was 3 though, she saw a little boy with an<br/>
eye patch and she whispered loudly, &quot;Mom!  I just saw a pirate!!&quot;  The<br/>
little boy turned around and he seemed to think it was cool that she<br/>
thought he was a pirate.  You never know.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050702728">Dear Rheta,<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t beat yourself up over it.  Kids get that message from the media<br/>
ALL the time in subtle and not so subtle ways.  My two girls have said<br/>
similar things in the past when I was clearly overweight.  I said well what<br/>
about me?  And they&#39;d tell me I wasn&#39;t fat.  :0)  Over the last year I&#39;ve<br/>
really focused on getting fit and eating right.  I&#39;ve lost most of the<br/>
excess weight I carried and I now exercise every day.  If they just said<br/>
that recently, and not when I was fatter, I might have wondered if they got<br/>
that message from me in some way, but I know that isn&#39;t true and it made it<br/>
easier to see that because I was overweight at the time of the comments.<br/>
It makes me sad that society focuses so much on what people look like.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been watching some extreme makeovers on TV recently and I find them<br/>
fascinating but I find it really sad that people feel the need to alter<br/>
their bodies so much through such drastic measures.  I am not talking about<br/>
life saving operations here.  Sometimes the people already seem beautiful to<br/>
me.  Not perfect, but beautiful, but it never seems to be enough for some<br/>
people.  <br/>
