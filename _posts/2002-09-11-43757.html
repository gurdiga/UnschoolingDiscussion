 </span></blockquote>A couple of days ago, Sam with on the floor inventing a four wheeled  K&#39;nex <br/>
structure.  I love K&#39;nex because for some reason Sam has more patience with <br/>
them than many building sets and he&#39;ll build and unbuild and rebuild again <br/>
without feeling frustrated.  But this time he was starting to get frustrated <br/>
and he explodes when he&#39;s frustrated (I&#39;ve just put in a request for &quot;The <br/>
Explosive Child&quot; at the library - Thanks, Pam, for the recommendation.)<br/>
<br/>
So I went over and made sure Nicky was out of the way and sat down with Sam <br/>
and said something about maybe he could swith the black rod for a red <br/>
connected to a yellow cause I could see that the sides weren&#39;t going to be <br/>
parallel the way he was building it.  &quot;NOOOOOOO!!!&quot; he screamed and I said <br/>
something about not liking being screamed at when I was only trying to help.  <br/>
He tried something else that didn&#39;t work and he screamed again.  I&#39;m almost, <br/>
but not quite sure, that I bit my tongue and didn&#39;t say anything about how it <br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t work that way.  I&#39;m sure I made at least one other <br/>
suggestion and he screamed.  I said something about not wanting to be <br/>
screamed at and maybe I should get up and go in the other room.  &quot;NO!  Stay <br/>
there!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, do you want me to help you or not?&quot;  He shook his head angrily, not <br/>
looking up from his building.  &quot;But you want me to stay here?&quot;  He nodded, <br/>
still not looking at me.  I sighed exasperatedly, then took a few breaths, <br/>
fidgeted, looked at the clock and the mess within arm&#39;s reach.  But he&#39;d made <br/>
it pretty clear he just wanted me there, so I calmed down and just watched <br/>
him work.<br/>
<br/>
And while I was just BEING he got it to work even though his cross beam was <br/>
longer than the end pieces.<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, I think my behavior that day was a pretty good example of <br/>
&quot;obtuse.&quot;)<br/>
