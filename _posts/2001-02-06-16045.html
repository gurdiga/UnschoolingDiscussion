<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982107039">Thanks everyine for your suggestions. I am printing them out and digesting<br/>
it a bit. I don&#39;t seem to have as much problem figuring out how he can have<br/>
the knowledge base of sciences as much as the math. Especially math that I<br/>
myself am not familiar with. Although I have Masters degree, I never got<br/>
past geometry. So Algebra II, Trig and Calculus, I have no idea what they<br/>
are used for in the &quot;real world&quot;. My son is interested in the math and<br/>
science field. He is probably going to get some computer certifications<br/>
under his belt before he gets out of high school. Does someone know how the<br/>
higher maths such as Algebra II, Trigonometry and calculus are used?<br/>

They&#39;re used for science.  That&#39;s why all the science recommendations.  He&#39;ll <br/>
find/discover the math in there where it actually lives, rather than in a <br/>
math book!<br/>
