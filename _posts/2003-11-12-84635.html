&gt;reccommend would be apprecitated.  Sandra, she reminds me a little of your <br/>

&gt;seems theatrically bent. Right now she has her beanies doing dance routines <br/>

My daughter loves the Broadway Kids CD&#39;s. They are showtunes sung by kids: <br/>
&quot;I Feel Pretty&quot;  &quot;Hair&quot;  &quot;Cats&quot; etc. There is also a Broadway Kids CD called <br/>
Hey Mr. DJ. It has pop songs sung by kids but the language is cleaned up. My <br/>
daughter listens to the radio versions too, she likes both.  We checked the <br/>
CD&#39;s out from our library and she loved them so much we bought them.  She <br/>
was 4 or 5 then, but still listens to them now. She is 9.<br/>
