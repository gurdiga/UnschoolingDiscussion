<div id="ygrps-yiv-705031103"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;(snipped)In the area we are moving to in NH, we&#39;ve been going there since<br/>
&gt;Christopher was a little and all our neighbors think it is wonderful that <br/>
&gt;we unschool<br/>
&gt;him now. But I hear that there is some testing and such that I have to look<br/>
&gt;into more, guess I just figured that it would be the same as here. I&#39;m now <br/>
&gt;trying<br/>
&gt;to stay out of panic mode as just the thought of having to answer to anyone<br/>
&gt;is making ds and I look at other options.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good luck with that!<br/>
If you need an unschooler to &#39;umbrella&#39; you in her private school, let me <br/>
know.  I&#39;d just list you as &#39;faculty&#39; and your son as a student and ignore <br/>
the heck out of you afterwards.  There&#39;s an upside to having to declare <br/>
yourself a private school in Cali.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(some nice stuff snipped)We have 10 acres and are just<br/>
&gt;completing a small log cabin  from some of the trees on our property and <br/>
&gt;have done<br/>
&gt;it by ourselves also. We have not logged out though as we love as many trees<br/>
&gt;as possible and have a beautiful view of the White Mountains. We would <br/>
&gt;love to<br/>
&gt;put a Yurt up there also, did you find it hard to do? Anyway, it looks<br/>
&gt;beautiful, must have been a nice family thing to accomplish together!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a little harder than I thought it would be, and much easier than I <br/>
feared.  It comes with a picture manual that&#39;s a life-saver.  You&#39;re right <br/>
and it turned out to be a really great thing to do together with the <br/>
family.  The kids were a little dubious at first, but game.  The kids got <br/>
pretty excited when it was actually up and ds refused to sleep anywhere <br/>
else that night!<br/>
<br/>
Fastening the three trellis sections (walls) together was the hardest part <br/>
- except for trying to get the roof insulation and roof covering on between <br/>
gusts of wind.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re really looking at yurts, we liked Pacific Yurts and Nesting Bird <br/>
Yurts the best.  They sometimes even have overstock or have a place on <br/>
their websites where people can list their used yurts.  We chose to go with <br/>
Nesting Bird because it seemed the best deal for what we wanted (and, <br/>
frankly, seemed the best choice all around.)  I&#39;ve heard Pacific yurts are <br/>
pretty nice tho.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to see a pic of your log cabin!  That&#39;s a lot of work!  Did you <br/>
really log and notch all the logs yourself?<br/>
