<div id="ygrps-yiv-180340992">Is there anyone on here who has someone that wants to write to a 10 year <br/>
old boy?  My son would love to talk to other kids but is afraid of the <br/>
chats all of a sudden but misses the daily communication with kids his age <br/>
since we have started unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
His email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:MathieuRyan@...">MathieuRyan@...</a>  if you have a child that would like <br/>
to.  It would be a nice surprise for him to get email from someone other <br/>
than me :o)<br/>
<br/>
His fav. things are digimon, pokemon, robots, animals, and probably about a <br/>
gazillion other things !<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

Too often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve.<br/>
