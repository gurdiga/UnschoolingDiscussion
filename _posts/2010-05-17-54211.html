Daughters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve had deep feeling about duty, for I think it  should only be  <br/>
spoken about in church and sacred places like that, not in someone&#39;s  <br/>
sitting room with everyone drinking tea.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that line is in the book.  If someone knows or has the  <br/>
book and wants to look (maybe it&#39;s online searchable), that might be  <br/>
fun to know.  Maybe the speech was longer in the book, or maybe it was  <br/>
written for the TV script.<br/>
<br/>
I liked it a lot, though, because it reinforces my funny side-theory  <br/>
about &quot;tea party behavior.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would much prefer to discuss duty than to spend a minute in  <br/>
someone&#39;s sitting room with everyone drinking tea.<br/>

And... I found you your context.<br/>
