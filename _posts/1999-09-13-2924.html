What is Homeschooling?<br/>
99% of the population thinks homeschooling is mom sitting at the kitchen <br/>
table teaching everything to her children. In fact, for more than 80% of <br/>
homeschoolers, their mental image of homeschooling is probably the same.<br/>

&quot;If homeschooling your kids is a dream that&#39;s found its way to the back <br/>
burner because of the cost involved, you&#39;re in for a wonderful surprise!&quot;<br/>

Let me offer a slightly different view, and define it this way: <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling is parents deciding and directing the education of their <br/>
children&quot;. Deciding and directing the education, not doing all the <br/>
educating.<br/>
<br/>
When our daughter, Stephanie, was about 12 years old, she had been <br/>
homeschooled for 5 years. She came to us an announced that she wanted to <br/>
take a foreign language this year. We assumed she met French or Spanish, but <br/>
she revealed she wanted to learn Hebrew ! Hebrew ! What do we know about <br/>
Hebrew ? Nothing. But, we didn&#39;t have to learn Hebrew for her to learn <br/>
Hebrew. By the end of that week, we had enrolled her in the bar mitzvah <br/>
course at the local synagogue, and she took Hebrew there.<br/>
<br/>
The assumption for most people is that they have to know it to teach it to <br/>
their children. Not quite true, since the parent doesn&#39;t have to be the one <br/>
to teach it. Consider this -- suppose my child wanted to take violin <br/>
lessons, and I don&#39;t know anything about violin. Does she have to wait for <br/>
me to become proficient in violin before she takes lessons ? Of course not. <br/>
We simply find a suitable instructor and she takes violin lessons. Same with <br/>
art. Same with foreign language, even Hebrew. Well, what about Math, <br/>
English, Science, or History ? Why not ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When my homeschooling son was ready to take Algebra, he took it at the local <br/>
community college. One course as a community student, he didn&#39;t have to <br/>
&quot;apply&quot; for college admission. He simply registered and took the course. See <br/>
the point ?<br/>
<br/>
Too often parents dismiss homeschooling because they have a limited image of <br/>
what homeschooling is. They have the mistaken idea that they are not <br/>
qualified. &quot;How could I ever teach Chemistry or Physics?&quot; they ask. And they <br/>
make their decision about homeschooling based on their limitations. The <br/>
reality is that when you use the resources available in the community, there <br/>
are very few limitations. The parent doesn&#39;t need to know it -- the parent <br/>
needs to know how to find it. That&#39;s homeschooling.<br/>
