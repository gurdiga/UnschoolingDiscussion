 </span></blockquote>    Replying to myself here......this conversation prompted me to leaf <br/>
through my set of Little House books looking for the passage about hair ribbons. <br/>
Doing that, I ran across lots of references to Laura calling her own hair <br/>
&quot;dirty-brown&quot; and saying how Mary had the beautiful golden hair and that everyone <br/>
knew that blond hair was better than brown hair. Found that written several times <br/>
in at least 2 separate books. What struck me as odd, though, was the story of <br/>
the girls getting their hair curled in ringlets for a special aunt&#39;s visit <br/>
with Laura thinking enviously about Mary&#39;s blond hair. When they were done, Ma <br/>
told the girls to go ask the aunt which she liked better, blond hair or brown <br/>
hair. Isn&#39;t that an odd question?? Thankfully, the aunt said she liked both <br/>
equally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532836924">This passage has always stuck with me.  I actually think of it several<br/>
times a week as I&#39;m doing my hair or whatever.  Funny how some things<br/>
just stick in your head.<br/>
