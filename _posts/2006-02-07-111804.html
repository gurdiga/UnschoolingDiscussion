 </span></blockquote>Yup we called them the same thing...we didn&#39;t even have them when I <br/>
was in high school - keypunch all the way baby! In college it was <br/>
keypunch, TTY with an acoustic coupler and for one Pascal <br/>
programming class I had we used TRS80s. I was a work study student <br/>
in the school of business office and helped my supervising professor <br/>
develop the proposal for the first PC lab (big old IBM jobs) - now <br/>
there are not only multiple computer labs on every campus but most <br/>
colleges have the dorm rooms wired for Internet/network access and <br/>
expect students to have/give students laptops for their classwork. <br/>
When I graduated college, I got a top of the line home computer - a <br/>
Commodor 64 with a *color* monitor, an inkjet printer, and a 5 1/2&quot; <br/>
single sided single density *floppy drive*. Whoo hoo! My how times <br/>
change - my 7 yr old DS has a laptop!<br/>
