<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847094610">I must agree with Ren.  This isn&#39;t even healthy!  I don&#39;t want this to come <br/>
across rude, but you need to either let go or get someone else involved!  <br/>
What needs are you having to meet for your husband that he can&#39;t meet for <br/>
himself?  And the pets?  Do the kids not enjoy caring for them?  If you are <br/>
the only one involved with the pets, perhaps finding them another home may <br/>
allow you the freedom to FIND interests of your own.  It is just downright <br/>
unhealthy for anyone not to want to have friends or personal interests.<br/>
<br/>
You might stop and think about what messages you are sending to your <br/>
children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440967406">I would think she has things she does for herself. <br/>
I could relate to her post in part. Especially during the winter months here <br/>
in Maine. But there are things I do for me. I use my computer,sew,read, <br/>
snowmobile and visit with friends. Heck I might even go to Goodwill and find <br/>
some treasures that&#39;s an adventure sometimes. But I will say that at times I <br/>
get in a rut and we just lay around and I might even take a nap. It took a <br/>
while for me to be ok with all the lego&#39;s,Thomas Trains, blocks, movies games <br/>
every where. Not that I frantically cleaned them up cuz I dont.<br/>
 Picking up little toys is not my favorite thing to do I would just assume <br/>
leave them out to come and play any time they wish. I think my biggest <br/>
concern was that my husband would come home to a mess. He says as long as the <br/>
kids are happy he is fine with it. <br/>
My son makes his own lunches just because he likes to. My 3yr old daughter <br/>
helps with the laundry she insists that she help. Sweet the more the merrier.<br/>
A few years ago I was feeling like that so I opened my own. Com and it was <br/>
very successful for quite some time. I even opened a store in the next town. <br/>
That in itself was a huge confidence boost for me. I have since closed the <br/>
business after a horrible week for sales in Sept 2001. Maybe someday I will <br/>
open again or not who knows. I do know that my son misses it. He loved the <br/>
business, shipping boxes, faxing orders and the customers loved talking to <br/>
him. The fact that we un/homeschooled our customers loved.<br/>

To the Mommy that posted this original email do you have hobbies or <br/>
interests?<br/>

 I have a feeling that those mom&#39;s who do little for themselves here <br/>
 have small kiddies at home still - (under 10?).  Please, those of you <br/>
 who say you don&#39;t have time or &quot;desire&quot; to take time out for <br/>
 yourselves - DO IT!   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a 2, 5, almost 10 and 13 y.o.<br/>
I don&#39;t necessarily need time away from them, I have moments through the day <br/>
where they&#39;re doing their own thing and I get to take a breather.<br/>
<br/>
My passions are something I can do with my children. Not that they are into <br/>
the same things, but they are present for so much.<br/>
Having passions and interests does not mean we have to &quot;get away&quot; necessarily.<br/>
It can be something you&#39;re doing at the kitchen table, something you are <br/>
researching, something in your back yard. And while they may not have the <br/>
same intense passion, they get to be a part of your world. Watching you, <br/>
listening to you, being a part of it in some way. <br/>
THIS is what unschooling is about. <br/>
Bringing children into regular life, into many adult worlds. Children can do <br/>
so much more than we give them credit for.<br/>
My two year old cuts stuff up in the kitchen, pours, stirs and helps me cook.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many ways we can have them there, WITH us as we pursue our own <br/>
interests.<br/>
Sometimes an interest may take you away for a short time, THAT is ok.<br/>
I&#39;d hate to think that a child only has an example of someone being the giver <br/>
as a Mom and not a whole person, with loves and desires of her own.<br/>

She does everything for all members of her family except herself.  She saw it <br/>
as selfless, the &quot;motherly&quot; thing to do, a noble sacrifice.  Now that the <br/>
youngest is older and almost ready to get out on her own she is left with <br/>
nothing.  Her husband has always wanted to do for himself and she threw <br/>
herself totally into the kids.  Now she has no hobbies, no friends and no <br/>

&lt;&lt; I still agree with Sorcha (? - not sure now) that your children need to <br/>
see <br/>
 you living your own life.  Not separate from them, alongside them.  From <br/>
 what you have written, it *sounds* like your children and your husband are <br/>
 your entire life.  That sounds good in theory, but in practice it puts an <br/>
 awful lot of pressure and responsibility onto them that may not be apparent <br/>
 now. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really like this.<br/>
Because all of my interests swirl around and involve my children in SOME way.<br/>
<br/>
If your whole life is so focused on them, what happens when they leave and <br/>
you and your dh have no common interests to pursue together?<br/>
Dh and I enjoy triathlon and bike riding together. It&#39;s something we do on <br/>
our own, but the boys were present at our first competition.<br/>
They know about the kids triathlon offerings, but aren&#39;t interested as of <br/>
now. <br/>
But we talk with them about it, they see us training and very often, they <br/>
come to the track with us to run or hang out and play.<br/>
<br/>
I study for falconry on my own, but I get excited and share information with <br/>
them.<br/>
I show them bird cams all over the country and I often see hawks (and now <br/>
they do) to point out here locally.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be going to massage therapy school in Jan. Massage is something we&#39;ve <br/>
always shared as a family. Mark often pays the kids to rub his feet or <br/>
shoulders after a hard day of work. I massage the kids, I tell them different <br/>
reflexology points and they pick it up by MY love for the art of massage.<br/>
<br/>
I share some of my writings with them, as interest allows. I share what I <br/>
write here and at the message boards when they ask. I read articles or <br/>
stories to them to get their opinions.  Sometimes I ask for their input or <br/>
opinion on a topic.<br/>
<br/>
I use my herbs in cooking, I medicate my children with herbs...yet another <br/>
passion that is automatically a part of their lives. They ask me frequently <br/>
what herb would be useful for this or that, or if we could grow a specific <br/>
one.<br/>
Because I enjoy building and gardening, I have built them each their own <br/>
garden bed.<br/>
I offered it to them and if they didn&#39;t want to garden, I would have used the <br/>
bed for my own seeds. They all took me up on the offer and will each be <br/>
growing their own mini-garden!<br/>
<br/>
Because of my interest in Medieval times, I took the kids to an SCA  event.<br/>
They LOVED it, and now we meet up with the local group occasionally and go to <br/>
the local events.  This is an example of our interests overlapping, there&#39;s <br/>
something for each of us in the SCA!<br/>
<br/>
As I pursue my art, the kids get really excited about all the materials and <br/>
possibilities. <br/>
They know quality materials from the cheap and aren&#39;t so easily satisfied by <br/>
the kids art supplies many stores carry.<br/>
Jared appreciates the professional colored pencils and we are currently <br/>
trying to add professional grade oil pastels and pens to our collection.  <br/>
<br/>
And then, there are those things I was never remotely interested in, that I <br/>
am learning about. Electricity, guitar, Japanese anime etc...<br/>
I try to get interested in their interests, because it IS cool to learn new <br/>
things.<br/>
They&#39;ve taught me a LOT. But that curiosity to learn new things is VITAL in <br/>
my opinion, to helping our children be life long learners and seekers.<br/>
<br/>
This is just a sampling of how a mothers interests can swirl and flow through <br/>
the family and not take time away from them at all. On the contrary, it <br/>
enhances our life immensely!<br/>

I&#39;m not sure I understand why you identified as someone who, like <br/>
(was it Sheila?), can&#39;t find any time for herself.  Didn&#39;t you then <br/>
go on to say that you get two hours (midnight til two AM) to yourself <br/>
each day?  So you do have a healthy amount of time to nourish and <br/>
restore yourself.<br/>

I don&#39;t have *outside* interests, but I was the one who posted about <br/>
living alongside your children.  I don&#39;t leave them with sitters, nor <br/>
do I want to go to the mall.  But I don&#39;t sit on the floor playing <br/>
with toys all day.  If you&#39;re taking time for yourself on a daily <br/>

offering my opinion and suggesting an alternative way to view the situation <br/>

posting here if I couldn&#39;t find any time for myself.  This is my &quot;me&quot; <br/>
time.  I used to get down about it and did feel like I was <br/>
sacrificing myself, but lately I&#39;ve really changed my perspective on <br/>
it and realized how much joy there is in doing stuff with my favorite <br/>
people in the whole world--my kids!  <br/>
<br/>
As I often do, I sat down with my kids to plan our day tomorrow.  <br/>
Here is what we&#39;re doing: <br/>
-Going to the eye doctor to see if dd can find any frames she likes<br/>
-Going to an ice cream shoppe to use a free banana split coupon I have<br/>
-Stopping at the post office to mail something to a friend<br/>
-doing a craft project with my daughter<br/>
-building train track with my boys<br/>
-painting our livingroom wall<br/>
-making spaghetti for supper<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the course of the day I will check this list and my other <br/>
favorite message board as much as time will allow. I might get 2 <br/>
hours online or I might get 10 minutes depending on how much my kids <br/>
are needing me.  I will also read in bed for a few minutes before I <br/>
turn my light out.  And the post office trip is for me.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like a fun day to me, and I&#39;m looking forward to it!  Does <br/>
it sound unhealthy to you? <br/>
<br/>
I know that when I don&#39;t give my kids enough mommy time--playing with <br/>
them a lot through the day--their behavior is TERRIBLE!   The more <br/>
mommy time they get, the better the behavior.  I don&#39;t expect them to <br/>
be asking me to play Thomas the tank engine with them when they&#39;re <br/>
16.  I&#39;m going to enjoy it now while they still do!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540791510">I have read most of the &quot;Moms doing what they want&quot; posts.. I havent read <br/>
them all.   But, I do see the clear contradications in them.  Honestly, its <br/>
been too confusing for me to really sort it all out and understand what some <br/>
folks are trying to say.   When the thread first started with Glena, folks <br/>
responded to her &quot;ways&quot; of doing things for her children as for herself and <br/>
not for her children.   THEN, it became.. &quot;oh you do too much for your <br/>
children&quot;    And then of course the debates over who does too much and who <br/>
does too little for themselves.    The advice on this list has spanned from  <br/>
Parents need to  cater to childrens every request  and ignore thier own  <br/>
feelings and needs, to advising others that they do too much for thier <br/>
children and they need to let thier children take care of themselves.     <br/>
<br/>
In reality, parenting is very much a balancing act between ourselves, our <br/>
children, and our &quot;outside&quot; committments and interests.   I do alot for <br/>
myself, I do alot for my children.  I do alot for my extended family, church, <br/>
and friends.  But I know I can&#39;t please all the people all of the time.<br/>

I think it helps to keep in perspective that no matter what you do, somebody <br/>
will not like the way you do things.  <br/>

I&#39;m not sure why either. I just mentioned that I don&#39;t have a desire to go<br/>
out with friends (sans children) or have a sole interest of my own. Meaning<br/>
without my children or husband. And I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t go out doing anything<br/>

grocery store or Target or Walmart visit. Oh, wait, I have an appt. with my<br/>

that I have plenty of alone time every day. Next thing I know I&#39;m a bad<br/>

our principles are, what our goals are, the balance point is going to be<br/>
different. The balance points of those whose priority is for their child to<br/>
have &quot;everything they need to know&quot; or to love and obey God or grow up as a<br/>
whole person are going to be all different.<br/>

She does everything for all members of her family except herself.  She saw it <br/>
as selfless, the &quot;motherly&quot; thing to do, a noble sacrifice.  Now that the <br/>
youngest is older and almost ready to get out on her own she is left with <br/>
nothing.  Her husband has always wanted to do for himself and she threw <br/>
herself totally into the kids.  Now she has no hobbies, no friends and no <br/>
life, she has lost all touch with what passions she had.  I am not sure what <br/>
will happen when the youngest is out all together.  Even her older children <br/>
will tell you that she is always in their life, even now, in an unhealthy <br/>
way.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could she have been a good unschooling mom?<br/>
<br/>
Now that we&#39;re talking about someone who&#39;s not even here and probably not a <br/>
homeschooler anyway, do you think that kind of focus (Pam G., since you know <br/>
her) would have kept her from having an unschooling atmosphere?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we&#39;re wrong to some extent.  Did that mom at least have intellectual or <br/>
artistic leanings of some sort?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Who said &quot;doing what they want&quot;?  Did that phrase come from someone <br/>
defending <br/>
 not having hobbies?  The topic is wrong and flawed.   Moms should live <br/>
 interesting, full, whole, real lives.  Shouldn&#39;t everyone want that?  (I <br/>
 think that&#39;s the argument from the side of those who are saying &quot;You SHOULD <br/>
 have a life.&quot;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the topic morphed into things I DON&#39;T agree with.<br/>
Like if a person doesn&#39;t have a need for outside friends there is something <br/>
wrong.<br/>
My dh is an introvert, he&#39;s perfectly happy hanging with just us and our BIL <br/>
as his social group. He does not attend parties with me, but that does not <br/>
keep my extrovert self from meeting my own needs and going by myself!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling works well with a Mom that has none of her own <br/>
interests.<br/>
Her interests can easily include her children and dh and not take her away <br/>
from them. But a person with NO interests or hobbies of her own is not going <br/>
to have a swirly, bubbling flow of information coming through the house the <br/>
same as someone who does.<br/>
This does NOT go hand in hand with leaving children home or not making them a <br/>
priority.<br/>
It&#39;s not one or the other.<br/>
I have tons of interests and hobbies, but I don&#39;t choose to spend time away <br/>
from my family much (work only for the most part) and I don&#39;t put their needs <br/>
below my own.<br/>
My toddler gets his needs met quickly, even if I have to walk away from <br/>
something I consider important.<br/>
My 13 y.o. can understand &quot;let me finish this first, I&#39;ll be right there&quot; <br/>
unless it&#39;s urgent.<br/>
<br/>
A person with young children is going to naturally be much more likely to put <br/>
her own interests aside for the sake of the children.<br/>
But children develop their own interests and don&#39;t need constant attention <br/>
(that would be hovering) as they get older, so Mom should have time for <br/>
things she dearly loves too!!<br/>
And even with toddlers, I seem to be able to include them in my passions in <br/>
some way.<br/>
Jalen is ultra happy out in the garden with me.<br/>
He digs in the dirt while I work.<br/>
He scoops and pours while I build.<br/>
There are so many things we can do side by side.<br/>
<br/>
It makes me wonder about school damage when someone says &quot;I have NO interests <br/>
of my own&quot;.<br/>
There is some healing that needs to take place in that case, I truly believe <br/>
that.<br/>

 &lt;&lt;Your words were that you had NO interests of your own, outside of your<br/>
family.<br/>
 That&#39;s what we were basing the comments on. That&#39;s all.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those weren&#39;t my words. My words were that I have &quot;no interests solely my<br/>
own.&quot; And that was clarified to mean most of what I do is done with my<br/>
husband or child/children. Big difference from me having &quot;no&quot; interests.<br/>
That&#39;s what the comments &quot;should&quot; be based on and weren&#39;t. There was plenty<br/>
of me alone time in my first post. A few seem to have skimmed right over<br/>
those parts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143859477">Interests, passions, creative outlets, whatever you want to call them, are <br/>
different from alone time.  You can certainly be alone while you do them, <br/>
though, or with a crowd of hundreds/thousands!!<br/>
