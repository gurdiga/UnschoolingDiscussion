&lt;&lt; I like the example of purposely having more music in the house because <br/>
a parent thinks exposure to music is important. When my kids were <br/>
little, I very consciously listened to different styles of music - <br/>
played music to which I would not normally have listened. And I took <br/>
the kids to concerts that I might not have chosen to attend if I had <br/>
not had children whose horizons I wanted to expand. This broadened my <br/>
own experience AND exposed my kids to a far wider variety of music, at <br/>
a young age, than would have happened just by accident. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We did that too.  Still do.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I met in a madrigal group, and I took him to folksinging parties <br/>
and we listened to lots of records together (his had all been stolen so maybe he <br/>
only liked me for my  record collection) and once spent our tax refund on a <br/>
&quot;Kortholdt,&quot; a resin reproduction of a single museum-owned capped double-reed <br/>
Renaissance instrument.<br/>
<br/>
But when Kirby came along, he and I LIKED singing together.  He loved Sesame <br/>
Street. We would talk about musical styles, and by the time Marty came along <br/>
we had a game going to name the style of music on various rendition of the <br/>
ABCs, or other little Sesame Street songs.  About the time Kirby was getting <br/>
sophisticated enough to consider between calypso and reggae, the game had run its <br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
The other day Marty was listening to something, and I thought maybe because <br/>
it was all new and modern it would have some nouveau modernistic style <br/>
designation.  &quot;What is this kind of music called, Marty?&quot; I asked.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at me for a long pause, as though trying to see if it was a trick <br/>
question, and said levelly, &quot;Punk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Punk.  I know punk.<br/>
I just thought it was going to be something more particular, that I might&#39;ve <br/>
missed out on.<br/>
<br/>
He and Holly have been on a techno binge.  Kirby has been listening to 70&#39;s <br/>
funk.<br/>
<br/>
WEIRD, huh?  <br/>
<br/>
And I just realized a couple of days ago that off all my webpages, I had zip <br/>
about music.  Maybe I&#39;ll add this.  I started a page a couple of days ago, but <br/>
couldn&#39;t get the midi link to work from Kirby&#39;s computer, and stalled out.  <br/>
It&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129482961">Well, since you mention it . . .<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I&#39;ve been wondering if you had rented any of the Devo DVDs from <br/>
Netflix when Holly was interested in them a month or so back (thread <br/>
was at unschooling.info).<br/>
<br/>
I liked the &#39;hits&#39; Devo had back in the day, but I never bought any of <br/>
their albums.  Then when I was an older teen I knew this guy through my <br/>
(then) boyfriend who was *really* into Devo.   I didn&#39;t like the guy <br/>
much and this experience left a bad taste in my mouth about Devo.  When <br/>
DH and I first started dating I saw that he had some Devo videos and I <br/>
had a moment of panic.   &quot;What kind of guy IS he????&quot;  LOL  I came to <br/>
really appreciate Devo and am really glad that I gave them a second <br/>
chance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in hearing about your forays into Devo-lution.  ;)<br/>

<br/>
We have one right now.<br/>
Keith has watched all, I watched some, Holly&#39;s asleep so I&#39;m not sure yet, <br/>
but it&#39;s not mailed back yet.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been watching PeeWee&#39;s Playhouse, and on the wall where PeeWee&#39;s escape <br/>
scooter is in the closing scene there are lots of pictures stuck up <br/>
random-bulletin-board style.  Right under George Washington is &quot;J.R. &#39;Bob&#39; Dobbs&quot; of <br/>
the Church of the Subgenius.  and near the front door is a photo (looks like a <br/>
framed autographed 8x10) of Andy Devine.  We were talking about Andy&#39;s Gang and <br/>
the violin-playing cat the other day (she hasn&#39;t seen it, I was trying to <br/>
tell her), and I just got Marty a DVD of an old Roy Rogers movie called Deadwood <br/>
(in preparation for getting him the new series when it comes out on DVD soon) <br/>
and I think Andy Devine&#39;s in that.<br/>
<br/>
The whole 50&#39;s interest of Pee Wee Herman and Weird Al (also a collector of <br/>
50s/60s memorabilia and old educational film strips and such) will tie in to <br/>
Devo stuff quite seamlessly, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Music...<br/>
Roy Rogers sings. (Maybe not in this movie.)<br/>
The Andy Devine story was about animation and instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Things don&#39;t have to have words and a tune to tie in to music!<br/>

Well I had thought &quot;punk,&quot; but then decided I was probably wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I know the difference between doo-wop and girl-group (and there&#39;s overlap), <br/>
but very few people care. &lt;g&gt;  But I like those kind of discussions of where <br/>
something ends and something else begins.<br/>

<br/>
Holly has decided to send Devo back without watching it and she&#39;ll catch them <br/>
later. Keith watched it and had fun, so it wasn&#39;t a total waste of <br/>
Netflix-jism.<br/>

Weeelllll....<br/>
Punk was originally an anti-establishment movement. Isn&#39;t it sorta <br/>
the same thing today? An expression of angst and rebellion against <br/>
anything mainstream?<br/>
Hang out at Hot Topic for a while and you get a feel for it.:)<br/>
&#39;Course, just the fact that there is a chain of stores for <br/>
punk/raver types, tells you that it&#39;s gone sorta mainstream. What a <br/>

I got Will a jacket for xmas that has a skull on the back and studs on the  <br/>
shoulders.  It&#39;s black, of course.  He was kind of shocked when he  opened <br/>
it--he thought it was a little beyond what I would just buy for him  without him <br/>
asking--too punk, he said.  I knew that would be his reaction,  but I knew he&#39;d <br/>
like it, too.<br/>
 <br/>
I remember thinking when I bought it, &quot;How punk can it be if I found it on  <br/>
the clearance rack at Wal-Mart?&quot;  <br/>

Flogging Molly.<br/>

Here&#39;s a bit that matches what I absorbed about punk.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mt.essortment.com/punkrockhistor_rapl.htm">http://mt.essortment.com/punkrockhistor_rapl.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The history of Punk rock music and what it meant, both musically and<br/>
socially.<br/>
<br/>
Like any musical genre, it&#39;s hard to pinpoint that time and place where it<br/>
actually began. But unlike any other musical genre, Punk rock was started as<br/>
a deliberate reaction to the mass commercialism of music. In the year 2000,<br/>
it&#39;s common to see someone &quot;being A punk,&quot; rather than seeing someone &quot;be<br/>
punk.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, the music industry rang eerily familiar in<br/>
its method of promoting trends over music. The public was being spoon-fed<br/>
music that corporations simply intended to make a profit from. The backlash<br/>
to this came to be known internationally as Punk rock.<br/>
<br/>
New York, early 1970&#39;s. Young, virtually unknown artists like Patti Smith,<br/>
the Velvet Underground, and the Dolls of New York(changed later to New York<br/>
Dolls) brought about a new style of &quot;alternative-bohemian&quot; entertainment,<br/>
rooted in a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; attitude. Short, frenetic songs, aggressive,<br/>
sometimes confrontational stage presence, and angry messages against<br/>
consumerism hit the stages at venues like New York&#39;s CBGB&#39;s, starting the<br/>
movement that would be known as punk rock.<br/>
<br/>
Bands like the Ramones and the Talking Heads would evolve out of the punk<br/>
rock movement, and become influences for those who shared a similar distaste<br/>
in what was occurring in the music industry. Some say the underlying roots<br/>
of punk was the frustration and anger from being treated as sheep, while<br/>
others say punk stemmed from the &quot;politics of boredom.&quot; It was both.<br/>
<br/>
Malcolm McLaren has an indelible role in the history of punk rock, either<br/>
beloved or hated for his managerial skills. In February of 1975, the New<br/>
York Dolls, once a forerunner in punk, tried to revive a lagging career by<br/>
hiring McLaren as their new manager. Understanding the value of shock,<br/>
McLaren took the band and reintroduced them as born again communists. They<br/>
draped themselves in communist flags and said catchy phrases like &quot;better<br/>
red than dead.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for the band, they continued to fail.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately for McLaren, they continued to fail.<br/>
<br/>
After his attempt with the New York Dolls, McLaren relocated to England and<br/>
teamed up with his friend Bernie Rhodes. The two nurtured a band that was<br/>
arguably their greatest success, the Sex Pistols. McLaren and the Pistols<br/>
adopted an anarchistic view of the world that made them instaneous<br/>
celebrities. With spiked hair, tattered clothes, and safety pins as jewelry,<br/>
they frequented talk shows and publicly badmouthed fellow artists, bands,<br/>
and musicians. They spoke harshly of the British class system and the<br/>
subjugation of the working class. They made news for concert violence and<br/>
fighting with fans. The Sex Pistols were also as notorious for their<br/>
brashness as they were for their inability to play their instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Their shock value not only brought them fame, but made them the single most<br/>
recognizable punk band. Therefore, many believed that punk rock began with<br/>
the Pistols, while others believed it made punk into a novelty and signified<br/>
the beginning of the end.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the internal turmoil in the punk movement, punk rock made several<br/>
things clear to international audiences. Punk Rock, in its subculture,<br/>
managed to break down many barriers of expression and language. It made an<br/>
indentation in the commericial music industry. It provided a fresh<br/>
alternative to a boring, stagnant music scene.<br/>
<br/>
But most of all, punk&#39;s legacy lies in its introduction of self employment<br/>
and activism. It illustrated that anyone can do it themself, without<br/>
reliance on the commercial media or the luxury of having financial<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532102461"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The Who and Bowie punk?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess, technically they were pre-punk but definately influenced the <br/>
punk scene.  Here&#39;s an interesting site that lists various bands and <br/>
how they fit into the punk history&#39;s timeline:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock</a><br/>
<br/>
I always think of The Who when I think of punk history- mostly due to <br/>
their Quadrophenia album and movie.  Although it is about the &#39;mod&#39; <br/>
and &#39;rockers&#39; clash, I feel like this album and movie really made way <br/>
for the punk movement.  The Who really seemed quite &#39;punk&#39; compared <br/>
to what was going on in their day.  Pete Townsend was the first to <br/>
really smash his guitar and destroy instruments on stage.  They were <br/>
LOUD and went around destroying hotel rooms and driving cars into <br/>
swimming pools when that wasn&#39;t the &#39;norm&#39; for music bands.  <br/>
Interestingly enough, they also &#39;discovered&#39; Jimi Hendrix and gave <br/>
Led Zeppelin their band name.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something interesting I found written about Quadrophenia:<br/>
<br/>
Quadrophenia - The Story<br/>
An Introduction by Marc Leaman <br/>
<br/>
Quadrophenia... the ultimate Who album. The album in which all that <br/>
has gone before comes together into one perfect package. The <br/>
definitive Rock album, although perhaps not the definitive Who <br/>
albumyet still the most &quot;Who&quot; of any Who album. QUAD was the only <br/>
Pete Townshend production for his band, which may be the reason for <br/>
this. Or perhaps it was one of those elusive moments in Art when many <br/>
elements come together and a higher level is achieved. In any case, <br/>
it might be questioned but never dismissed that the essence of Rock <br/>
music was better defined than within these 82 minutes. Unlike <br/>
Townshendís earlier work, TOMMY (a fantasy which reflected the <br/>
yearning for but ultimate rejection of spiritual enlightenment by the <br/>
populous), QUAD is almost stark in its realism. In a brilliant <br/>
display of songwriting prowess, both the story and the music of QUAD <br/>
are multi-leveled and complex. On the surface it is merely the story <br/>
of James Michael Cooper, Mod. With him comes his psychological <br/>
problem, that being a four way split personality (designed to reflect <br/>
the four members of The Who, mislabeled Quadrophenia in reference to <br/>
Schizophrenia). Jimmy is supposed to be four people: a tough guy, a <br/>
romantic, a lunatic, and a hypocrite. Sometimes one could just as <br/>
easily be another, and like real life there&#39;s no real pattern, so in <br/>
the end it seems a writing tool never completely utilized by <br/>
Townshend. <br/>
<br/>
Jimmy is a member of the Mod scene, and (like most teenagers) he&#39;s <br/>
desperately attempting to fit in. And failing, despite being an <br/>
advocate and devoted follower of Mod-consciousness. That&#39;s on the <br/>
surface. Embedded within this story, one can find the adolescent <br/>
angst common to us all. As usual, Townshend was speaking for his <br/>
generation. Jimmy is a typical frustrated teenager (if such a being <br/>
can be said to exist), bound to find THE ANSWERS yet unable to see <br/>
how. Envying the guys who seem to have figured it out, not realizing <br/>
they are no wiser than he. Desiring the girls he cannot approach, not <br/>
yet aware their needs are different yet no less compelling than his <br/>
own. Wanting to be accepted as an adult, while in the core of his <br/>
being he knows that he isn&#39;t really prepared. QUAD captures this <br/>
dilemma so perfectly that it could serve as a primer to help any teen <br/>
get through adolescence. <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take the story itself step by step. &quot;The story is set on a rock <br/>
in the middle of a stormy sea.&quot; So Townshend said at Largo, Maryland <br/>
(or was it Philadelphia?) for the opening of this story. Jimmy is <br/>
sitting on this rock in the bay, with rain pouring on him, reflecting <br/>
on his woes to date. The album opens with the crashing of waves <br/>
against the rock, in the theme of Helpless Dancer. &quot;Is it me, for a <br/>
moment?&quot; &quot;Bell boy&quot; &quot;Love reign o&#39;er me.&quot; Jimmy, feeling tortured by <br/>
it all, screams in agony: &quot;Can you see the real me, can ya? Can YA?&quot; <br/>
The Real Me kicks in as Jim angrily recounts his attempts to be <br/>
understood. He recalls the sessions with his psychiatrist, where <br/>
Jimmy doesn&#39;t feel he&#39;s getting through. The psychiatrist: &quot;never <br/>
betrays what he thinks.&quot; Frustrated, he turns to his mother, but <br/>
unfortunately she can only offer: &quot;I know how it feels, son/Cause it <br/>
runs in the family.&quot; No help there. With wonderful imagery, the song <br/>
shows how the frustration takes Jimmy&#39;s consciousness to a higher <br/>
level (as on an acid trip): &quot;The cracks between the paving <br/>
stones/Like rivers of flowing veins.&quot; Jim notes that even those in <br/>
the neighborhood he knows are really strangers to him &quot;peeping behind <br/>
from every windowpane.&quot; He has lost his girl and cannot figure out <br/>
why. His life is turning to shit, and no one can understand him. He <br/>
fells alienated and alone. <br/>
<br/>
So Jimmy turns at last to a holy man, although so bitter now that <br/>
he&#39;s &quot;full of lies and hate.&quot; The preacher, used to less volatile <br/>
situations, is frightened but doesn&#39;t really understand. So he does <br/>
his best to show Jim the path as he sees it, not able to grasp the <br/>
strength of the forces at work within Jimmyís skull. It&#39;s not enough <br/>
for Jim, and he rejects it ending with the same frustrations, <br/>
intensified. The four personalities then grip him, one by one. <br/>
Musically, this is shown by each theme in the song Quadrophenia. They <br/>
rage through him, and in the end Jimmy is left weakened and <br/>
reflective. <br/>
<br/>
The boy feels he needs a direction. Jim thinks that being a Mod can <br/>
save him; can solve his problems. Even in a less spiritual work, <br/>
Townshend cannot escape the humanís basic drive for spirituality. Mod <br/>
is Jimmyís religion, his buffer from the harsh reality of a life he <br/>
doesnít quite understand. He tires to rationalize his behavior and <br/>
lifestyle to himself, alternately justifying the lifestyle (&quot;Why <br/>
should I care/If I have to cut my hair/I&#39;ve got to move with the <br/>
fashion/Or be outcast.&quot;) and declaring his belief in the truth of it <br/>
(&quot;I&#39;m out on the street again/And I&#39;m leaping along/Dressed right/For <br/>
a beach fight&quot;) but is still honest enough to feel itís not doing <br/>
what he needs it to (&quot;but I just can&#39;t explain/Why that uncertain <br/>
feeling/Is still here in my brain&quot;). Here we also see how rejected <br/>
and separated he feels even form his Mod pals (&quot;Why do I have to be <br/>
the same old row again and again/Why do I have to move with a <br/>
crowd/Of kids that hardly notice I&#39;m around/I work myself to death <br/>
just to fit in&quot;). Even Modism isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s all he&#39;s got. <br/>
His goal becomes being the perfect Mod. This will be his salvation. <br/>
<br/>
So, in search of the relief he so desperately needs, he goes to see a <br/>
top Mod band at a live show (The Who, of course). It&#39;s not long <br/>
before he realizes they are no more than a reflection of their <br/>
audience (&quot;You declared you were three inches taller/You only became <br/>
what we made you&quot;). The band admits to this (&quot;No surprise/I told <br/>
lies/ I&#39;m the punk in the gutter&quot;) and tries to convey a feeling of <br/>
vision (&quot;And yet I&#39;ve lived your future out/By pounding stages like a <br/>
clown&quot;). But Jimmy needs real heroes; someone he can look up to. <br/>
Someone who has successfully dealt with the problems he faces. And so <br/>
this is just another letdown for him. He returns home to find himself <br/>
thrown out, because his mother had found drugs (leapers) in his room. <br/>
<br/>
Alone, he still finds the strength within himself and the idea of Mod <br/>
all he has &quot;discovered&quot; is that these particular people aren&#39;t up to <br/>
his standard. So while he admits that he&#39;s got problems (&quot;I&#39;m a <br/>
loser/No chance to win&quot;), he also has what it takes to overcome them <br/>
(&quot;You&#39;ll all see/I&#39;m the one&quot;). Jimmy gets a job as a dustman. High <br/>
on self-declarations, he maintains &quot;Things are changing/I&#39;m not going <br/>
to sit and weep again&quot; and &quot;Just like a child/I&#39;ve been seeing only <br/>
dreams/I&#39;m all mixed up but I know I&#39;m right&quot; After two days of this <br/>
dirty and nonfulfilling work, Jim quits his job. His answer lies <br/>
elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
Again thrown into depression, he rages against life (&quot;And when your <br/>
soul tells you to hide/Your very right to die&#39;s denied/And when a man <br/>
is trying to change/It only causes further pain&quot;). Like any other <br/>
teen, Jimmy is looking for the fairness in life, and not finding any <br/>
(&quot;And you get beaten up by blacks/Who though they work still got the <br/>
sack...&quot;). In the end, he can find only one solution: giving up (&quot;You <br/>
realize that all along/Something in us is going wrong/You stop <br/>
dancing.&quot;). And that&#39;s no solution at all. Jim begins to feel once <br/>
more that the problem lies within him (&quot;I try to number those who <br/>
love me/And find exactly what the problem is/Is it in my head/Or in <br/>
my heart&quot;). The evidence seems to point in that direction <br/>
(&quot;Statements to a stranger/Just asking for directions/Turns from <br/>
being help/To being questions&quot;); he can&#39;t interact with anyone around <br/>
him. It must be his fault. <br/>
<br/>
Searching for what seems an impossible solution, Jimmy rides out in <br/>
his GS scooter. He is still declaring his Modism (&quot;My jacket&#39;s gonna <br/>
be cut slim and checked/Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open <br/>
neck&quot;), striving to be a perfect Mod. Then Jimmy sees the girl he <br/>
loves with his best friend, which seems to be the final straw, and is <br/>
upset enough to crash the bike. He can only reject everything (&quot;I&#39;ve <br/>
had enough of living&quot;), because it&#39;s all been taken away form him <br/>
anyway. Even the Modism he knows appears corrupt (&quot;I&#39;ve had enough of <br/>
dancehalls/I&#39;ve had enough of pills/I&#39;ve finished with the <br/>
fashion/And acting like I&#39;m tough/I&#39;ve bored with hate and <br/>
passion/I&#39;ve had enough of trying to love&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
Jim has lost everything he loved. This is the low point in his life. <br/>
And yet, though depressed and frustrated, he still clings to the <br/>
belief that Mod can save him. It&#39;s all he has left and he must find <br/>
an uncorrupted group of true believers, so he will at last find the <br/>
people with which to fit in. Other, perfect Modsso he gets pilled up <br/>
and takes the train to Brighton, where he remembers everything as <br/>
being perfectly Mod. <br/>
<br/>
The leapers take him into a surreal mental state, and the whole <br/>
journey is one long observational trip (ìGirls of fifteen/Sexually <br/>
knowing/The ushers are sniffing/Eau-de-cologning/The seats are <br/>
seductive/Celibate sitting/Pretty girls digging/Prettier women&quot;). <br/>
There is no action, just images filtered through a pill-induced haze <br/>
(&quot;Magically bored/On a quiet street corner/Free frustration/in our <br/>
minds and our toes/Quiet storm water/My generation/Uppers and <br/>
downers/Either way blood flows&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
Upon arriving, he finds the seaside rather less than perfectly Mod <br/>
this time. There are no other Mods around, and here Jim is just as <br/>
lonely as at home. So he goes down to the beach (Here by the sea and <br/>
sand/Nothing ever goes as planned) He recalls the &quot;good old days&quot; <br/>
when things were the way they should be (&quot;I am the face/She has to <br/>
know me/I&#39;m dressed up better than anyone one within a mile&quot;), moans <br/>
about his situation (&quot;So how come the other tickets look much <br/>
better/Without a penny to spend/They dress to the letter&quot;), and <br/>
thinks evil thoughts about his former girlfriend and girls in general <br/>
(&quot;How come the girls come on oh so cool/And when you meet them/Every <br/>
one&#39;s a fool&quot;). (Note: At this point, the story becomes a bit <br/>
disjointed. The proper sequence, as the photos show in the booklet, <br/>
has Jimmy seeing the Bell Boy and then stealing the boat. Song-wise, <br/>
it&#39;s the other way aroundwhich makes no sense; how could Jim meet the <br/>
Bell Boy after getting stuck on the rock? So I&#39;m going to report it <br/>
in the correct sequence, or at least the sequence I see as correct.) <br/>
<br/>
Then, for the final time, Jimmy&#39;s heroes are dashed to pieces. <br/>
The &quot;Ace Face&quot; Mod he remembers from his last visit is now seen as a <br/>
lowly Bell Boy. Instead of the swaggering Mod leader (&quot;Ain&#39;t you the <br/>
guy that used to set the paces/Riding up ion front of a hundred <br/>
faces&quot;), we have a bowing-and-scraping fellow, trying to justify it <br/>
all (&quot;I&#39;ve got a good job/And I&#39;m newly born/You should see me <br/>
dressed up/In my uniform) to his former admirer. But as always, <br/>
reality sets in (ìBell boy!/Gotta get running now/Keep me lip <br/>
buttoned down/Carry this baggage out/Always running at someoneís <br/>
heel). Jim has now, truly, had enough. Everything he believed in, all <br/>
of the people he has looked to for leadership or help, has let him <br/>
down. Even Modism has let him down. It was a pale mockery of what he <br/>
wanted, or needed, (really what he thought it was) and was never any <br/>
solutions there. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing there to save him which wasn&#39;t found within himself. He gets <br/>
a bottle of Gin and begins to rage (&quot;Laugh and say I&#39;m green/I&#39;ve <br/>
seen things you&#39;ve never seen/I&#39;ll take on anyone/Ain&#39;t scared of a <br/>
bloody nose/Drink till I drop down&quot;). Every weakness he sees (and <br/>
hates) in himself, he now denies. Every cruel and ugly behavior he <br/>
can think of, all of the things he wants to do but cannot, he claims <br/>
as his own (&quot;You say she&#39;s a virgin/Well I&#39;m gonna be the first <br/>
in/Her fella&#39;s gonna kill me/Oh, fucking will he&quot;). He does, at <br/>
least, realize that he has unleashed the beast within himself (&quot;He <br/>
only comes out when I drink my gin&quot;), but this is a time for the <br/>
beast because there&#39;s nothing left for any other in the life he has <br/>
rejected. Coupled with this are flashes of rationality (&quot;Is it me, <br/>
for a moment&quot;), where Jimmy actually wonders what indeed he really <br/>
is. Who is the real Jim? Is it this me, for a momentor is it that me? <br/>
Or are any of the four James Michael Cooper the real me? <br/>
<br/>
This is the crisis building to the climax; he&#39;s no longer able to <br/>
reconcile the four people that he is. As it all becomes too much for <br/>
his mind to deal with, he is coming closer to a solution. Once again, <br/>
aggravation (not to mention the gin & pills) takes his mind to a <br/>
higher level (&quot;The stars are falling/The heat is rising/The past is <br/>
calling&quot;). All part of the rational Jim trying to figure out what&#39;s <br/>
going on. <br/>
<br/>
Disgusted, angry, and still in a higher state of consciousness he <br/>
steals a boat and heads for a lonely rock in the bay (&quot;I&#39;m flowing <br/>
under bridges/And flying through the sky/I&#39;m traveling down cold <br/>
metal/Just a tear in a baby&#39;s eye/Let me flow into the ocean/Let me <br/>
get back to the sea/Let me be stormy, let me be cold/Let the tide in <br/>
and set me free&quot;). Here, perhaps, he can figure it all out and find <br/>
and answer. The rage within him has cooled, and now he is a bit more <br/>
reflective (&quot;I&#39;m remembering distant memories/Recalling other <br/>
names/Rippling over crayons/And boiling in the train&quot;). And, upon <br/>
climbing up on the rock, the boat drifts away, and he&#39;s stuck out <br/>
there, in the rainwhich is where the story began. His reflection is <br/>
over. The four facets of his personality visualize themselves before <br/>
him in the falling water. He sees them swirling about him, coming <br/>
slowly closer and closer tighter, until at last they overlapand <br/>
coalesce into one. <br/>
<br/>
This is the moment of realization for Jimmy. It all becomes clear, <br/>
all of the problems and also a possible way of solutionfor the only <br/>
solution for any problem must come from within. No one can really <br/>
solve anything for him. He must meet the challenges of life one by <br/>
one and deal with them himself. And more than anything else, trust in <br/>
himself. Sure, he still faces all of the problems he did only moments <br/>
ago. But now he knows he can deal with them. They aren&#39;t as crushing <br/>
as they seemed, insurmountable and impossible. Overjoyed, freed, and <br/>
feeling very spiritual, Jimmy embraces the rain (rather than cursing <br/>
it) and allows the water to run over himwashing away his pain and <br/>
filling his soul. Instead of rejecting love, he must draw it to him <br/>
(&quot;Only love can bring the rain/That falls like tears from on high&quot;) <br/>
and let it cleanse him. Only through the pain can come joy; only <br/>
through the pain can on recognize happiness. And in the end, only <br/>
love matters (Love, reign o&#39;er me&quot;). Jim realizes that love, however <br/>
fleeting and temporarily it may be, is goal worth seeking <br/>
nonetheless. And that without it, life is empty and dry (&quot;On the dry <br/>
and dusty road/The nights we spent apart, alone/I need to get back <br/>
home/To cool, cool rain&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
This ending is typically Townshend. Rarely does he really end a <br/>
story, because in real life there is no endingjust moving on to the <br/>
next situation. The triumph here for Jimmy is that he has climbed a <br/>
level in his development. He&#39;s on his way up. True, he may fall back <br/>
down againbut at least he has learned how to climb and which <br/>
direction to go. <br/>
<br/>
Also, notice that water plays a big part in the spiritual <br/>
realizationjust as in many Townshend songs, like The Sea Refuses No <br/>
River and The Ferryman (which was based on the Buddhist tale <br/>
Siddhartha). This is a common image for many writers aspiring to <br/>
spirituality in their works, and Townshend uses it well. <br/>
<br/>
I have made the case QUAD is less spiritual and more realistic than <br/>
other Townshend works, but thereís no denying the parallels of coming <br/>
to the Universal Mind and Jimmyís embrace of the solution. I still <br/>
read much of the story as more self-affirming than spiritual, but <br/>
songs like Drowned and Love Reign Oíer Me (for two) are quite <br/>
spiritual in essence. <br/>
<br/>
There are flaws in QUAD; not only is the story out or sequence but <br/>
Jimmy&#39;s behavior does not really indicate four separate <br/>
personalities. Townshend, in wanting to create a definitive Who <br/>
album, stretched to the point of attempting to reflect the four <br/>
members of The Who. When in fact the story works just as well without <br/>
this element. The movie version ignores it completely. And it&#39;s just <br/>
as well; it complicates the story with nothing gained. To <br/>
reach &quot;everyman,î as is clearly Townshend&#39;s goal, the hero should be <br/>
an &quot;everyman&quot; after all. Too, the four facets of Jimmy&#39;s behavior are <br/>
common enough to be found in any adolescent. We are, all of us, multi-<br/>
faceted individuals to begin with. <br/>
<br/>
The story is set in a 1964-5 London/Brighton, but again this isn&#39;t <br/>
extremely important. Mod as a cult (in this story) is analogous to <br/>
any group (or religion), even a small group of friends. So again, <br/>
QUAD is a universal tale. Since the vast majority of people (at least <br/>
in the Western cultures) go through a traumatic adolescence, it is an <br/>
extremely universal tale. <br/>
<br/>
Rock Music itself is a reflection of youth and rebelliousness, and <br/>
going through adolescence is the most traumatic part of our youthand <br/>
this makes QUAD the definitive Rock album. At least, the most <br/>
definitive so far...</div>
