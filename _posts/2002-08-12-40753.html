&gt; Subject: Re: MA court case (was Re: 2219 Death from Religion)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My state, FLorida is notorious for its extremely ineffective social<br/>
&gt; services agency. THey keep changing the social service agency&#39;s name<br/>
&gt; (Dept. of Children and Families is what it is called now) so hopefully<br/>
&gt; people will forget the kids who were just murdered, neglected or hurt,<br/>
&gt; and keep funding them. On the other hand I have seen testimony by many,<br/>
&gt; many families whose lives were ruined by social service agencies who<br/>
&gt; tore them apart, ripped kids out of their parents home for no good<br/>
&gt; reason by their own opinions and put them into foster homes where they<br/>
&gt; were raped or abused and neglected.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BUt they change the name of their agency, rather than their<br/>
&gt; fundamentally flawed premise, that the government by intruding and<br/>
&gt; degrading the dignity and rights of its people can get them to &quot;act<br/>
&gt; better&quot;.<br/>

unschoolers need to know what&#39;s in store for children and families when we<br/>
don&#39;t take responsibility ourselves.<br/>
