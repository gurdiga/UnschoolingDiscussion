Here is an excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Many who want to control children (for example, the less imaginative <br/>
members of the teaching profession or parents obsessed with kids&#39; <br/>
grades) become green with envy when they see the energy children pour <br/>
into computer games. So they say to themselves, &quot;The kids like to play <br/>
games, we want them to learn multiplication tables, so everyone will be <br/>
happy if we make games that teach multiplication.&quot; The result is shown <br/>
in a rash of ads that go like this: &quot;Our Software Is So Much Fun That <br/>
The Kids Don&#39;t Even Know That They Are Learning&quot; or &quot;Our Games Make <br/>
Math Easy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The language of these ads betrays the way in which this software throws <br/>
away what is best about the contribution of game designers to the <br/>
learning environment and replaces it with what is worst about the <br/>
contribution of school curriculum designers. What is best about the <br/>
best games is that they draw kids into some very hard learning.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great article.<br/>

Thanks for passing this article along, it was a really great read!<br/>
<br/>
I have seen so much of what he discusses in my son (he&#39;s 12).  The challenge<br/>
of figuring out a new game is definitely his current joy.  We went to a<br/>
different Blockbuster a couple days ago and now there&#39;s a whole new set of<br/>
games for him to try (seems the one closest to us doesn&#39;t have as much<br/>
selection).  He&#39;s excited to try out three new games, one a week, over the<br/>
next three weeks.  And he&#39;s trying to balance that with maintaining his<br/>
FF-XI character level growth along with the friends he&#39;s found online. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I remember a couple years ago he ran into another person at a party who was<br/>
just as into video games as himself and they spent the evening chatting<br/>
about them.  He told me one of the things they talked about how much they<br/>
learn from playing video games.<br/>
<br/>
And as mentioned in the article he&#39;s now moved into developing his own<br/>
games.  When he was younger it was mostly storylines and drawing characters<br/>
and bosses but now he&#39;s using RPG Maker to create his own games.  He also is<br/>
now more interested in the industry itself, watching X-Play to get a feel<br/>
for the whole genre, not just the games he likes playing (RPGs), and surfing<br/>
message boards and fan sites online.<br/>
<br/>
It is really amazing to watch his interest unfold and all the great learning<br/>
that happens along the way.<br/>

My sons love to play computer games.  We do things on the pc, we don&#39;t have a game boy or any of those other things.<br/>
Can you tell me more about creating games?  How would we begin to do this?<br/>
I think the boys would like to move in this directions, though I&#39;m not sure where to start.<br/>
What is  RPG maker?<br/>
<br/>
My boys are 11 and 9.<br/>

Thanks for any help.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s for Playstation, and the newer one for Playstation II.<br/>
<br/>
Marty bought a playstation keyboard so he could do it even better.  Some <br/>
things need to be named and that&#39;s painstaking work if you have to do it letter by <br/>
letter by clicking on the right letter.<br/>

We have both.  Adrian hasn&#39;t done too much with them, yet.  We still <br/>
need to get the keyboard for his PS2, they&#39;re about $20 and make <br/>
using the RPG Maker much easier.  We do know other kids that have <br/>
them and enjoy them very much.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>

<br/>
The &quot;game&quot; is called RPG Maker II and as Sandra mentioned it&#39;s for the<br/>
Playstation 2 console.  I highly recommend the PS2 keyboard and the<br/>
accompanying game guide to help him get off to a good start.  It&#39;s<br/>
challenging enough without the frustration of really slow letter by letter<br/>
data entry using a controller.  But for Joseph it&#39;s been well worth the<br/>
steep learning curve.  He really enjoys it!  It&#39;s given him a great outlet<br/>
for all those stories and adventures he&#39;s been developing in his head. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
For games on the computer Visual Basic (VB) is probably a good place to<br/>
start.  A quick search will bring up lots of sites.  Here&#39;s one I just<br/>
found: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vbexplorer.com/VBExplorer/game_tutorials.asp">http://www.vbexplorer.com/VBExplorer/game_tutorials.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t want to get too deep into coding there is also downloadable<br/>
game development software you can find searching the internet such as<br/>

I have included the link below.  If you go about half way down on the <br/>
home page of the site it says &quot;FREE 4 SCHOOLS.&quot;  I enquired, and they <br/>
gave it to me free as a home school.  We were given the authority to <br/>
share 10 copies.  It&#39;s just a download, and is very simple to install.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how you fare...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960282502">No, it&#39;s not deceptive.  Just because you don&#39;t need to use one, <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean you are not a legal home school.  BUT, the way that I <br/>
did it was contact them via email and tell them that I am a <br/>
homeschool.  This way they already knew, and they were looking for my <br/>
information when it came in.  I umbrellad (sp?) our home school under <br/>
the local home school group and shared the 10 &quot;copies&quot; with those <br/>
that were interested.  It was really easy.  If you&#39;d like to see the <br/>
letterhead that I created for us, email me off list and I&#39;d be glad <br/>
to forward it to you.  I do believe I have it saved...<br/>
