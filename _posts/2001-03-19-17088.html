<div id="ygrps-yiv-39779373">Thank you all for the suggestions I received regarding<br/>
my son&#39;s sleepover!  Just thought I would let you all<br/>
know that the rain and snow did hold off and we were<br/>
able to get the bonfire lit.  All went very well.  We<br/>
ate roasted hot-dogs  till we could have popped.  We<br/>
did roast the marshmallows inside on candles though,<br/>
(that was a terrific idea).  We played many games and<br/>
all was a success.  We did have to answer a lot of<br/>
questions from all of our ps friends.  They were all<br/>
very interested in what we are doing!!  My boys were<br/>
very proud to have the opportunity to show off their<br/>
work and projects.<br/>
<br/>
