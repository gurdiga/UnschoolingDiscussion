&gt; That&#39;s a pretty long and frantic sentence.  <br/>
&gt; They have drugs for that! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (I&#39;m joking, but not.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The kind of stress that will come from that much eager frustration <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t do  you or your kids any good either.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;While it is a very long sentence (82 words), it is grammatically correct.<br/>
&gt;It also did not strike me as frantic or stressed, merely a statement of<br/>
&gt;a complicated thought.  Perhaps this is a case where the reader&#39;s frame<br/>
&gt;of mind plays a part?  As one who had to make a conscious effort to<br/>
&gt;monitor my sentence length, let me say, I don&#39;t mind long sentences and I<br/>
&gt;still use them occassionally myself.<br/>
