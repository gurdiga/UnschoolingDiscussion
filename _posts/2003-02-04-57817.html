&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, my main reason for posting is that I am looking for other unschoolers<br/>
&gt;&gt; and SECULAR groups in Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m no help to you as far as a regular group, but my in-laws live in<br/>
DeKalb, so we do come there pretty regularly.  Maybe we can meet up<br/>
sometime.  I can always go for an excuse to get out of the house for a bit.<br/>
