<div id="ygrps-yiv-380243927">hi, I&#39;ve been lurking about in here long enough to know that I <br/>
respect your opinions, and I need help from like minded folk (hard to <br/>
find outside of cyberspace).<br/>
<br/>
We try to exist in a nuturing home environment, one that validates <br/>
all feelings, not just the good. With 8 and 5 year old boys, we are <br/>
relatively new to unschooling, and so relieved to have finally found <br/>
an &quot;educational philosophy&quot; that fits my heart and intuition.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old seems to perpetually be in an angry or sad state. The <br/>
example that I bring to you today is: I took the boys shopping for <br/>
some cheap-o toys, just for fun. They were browsing around, picking <br/>
up a few things, here and there, when all of a sudden the 5 year old <br/>
yells at me, &quot;Ryan (8 yo) CAN NOT TOUCH ANY of my things. These are <br/>
mine!&quot; I responded, &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want Ryan to touch your new <br/>
things, hmm, I see&quot; The conversation went on like this <br/>
a couple of times when he screamed out &quot;Stop talking to me! I HATE <br/>
YOU!!&quot;. So, I crouched down, said, &quot;It is okay for you to be angry at <br/>
me, or frustrated, or WHATEVER, but it is NOT okay for you to yell at <br/>
me&quot; He just collapsed in my arms for a hug. SO we make our purchases <br/>
and we get to the car and I asked him if he was okay. He replied <br/>
(this is verbatim), &quot;Yah, I&#39;m okay; it is just so hard for me to feel <br/>
excited.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any suggestions how we can work through these hard <br/>
feelings? They are hard, because they make HIM so miserable, and it <br/>
is not on rare occassion. I understand that being <br/>
sad/angry/frustrated is okay, but is it okay <br/>
for it to override excitement and happiness? Am I overlooking <br/>
anything with helping him to feel supported? The above is a typical <br/>
reaction from me. Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble, but I feel like I really need some advice.<br/>
Thanks for just being here,<br/>
Cynthia</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356505422">-=-. We had a meltdown in the store today and I was trying<br/>
to figure out was was wrong, but failing miserably at comforting<br/>
Lilly.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But what happened before the meltdown?<br/>
<br/>
Was she hungry?  Tired?  Sick?  Did she want to go to the store or  <br/>
was she there against her will?  Did she want to walk but being made  <br/>
to ride in the cart?  Was she overwhelmed by the size and busy-ness  <br/>
of the store?    Were you near soap or candles and was the smell  <br/>
irritating her but she wasn&#39;t able to just walk away (or might not  <br/>
have realized what it was as an adult might).  Did she not like the  <br/>
changes of temperature from freezer aisle to bakery, but isn&#39;t old  <br/>
enough to realize what&#39;s what and why at the store?  Were the smells  <br/>
of bread or barbecue making her hungry without her knowing?<br/>
<br/>
I still remember being little and in the store and frustrated when my  <br/>
mom would stop and read cans.  We&#39;d be moving, and then it would all  <br/>
go still and boring.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids don&#39;t much like stores.<br/>
<br/>
I used to let the littlest kid (if he or she wanted to) sit in the  <br/>
basket of the cart and arrange the groceries in and around him, and I  <br/>
would keep up a steady stream of conversation.  I never just looked  <br/>
at packages, I would tell them what I was looking at and why, whether  <br/>
it was ingredients or price or whatever it might be.  I would tell  <br/>
them stories about things we weren&#39;t going to buy, just whatever  <br/>
might be interesting, like different kinds of squash from Mexico, or  <br/>
things grown locally.  If there were South American grapes I might  <br/>
mention that it was winter here, but not in Chile.<br/>
<br/>
Are the parents stressed and complaining at the store?  Or are you  <br/>
hungry or tired or sick or bothered by the size or smells?<br/>
<br/>
Our moods affect our children&#39;s moods.  If I was being attentive and  <br/>
funny and pleasant and sympathetic to them from before we even got in  <br/>
the store it&#39;s like they went with me to do something cool, instead  <br/>
of having to be dragged along to where I had to do something I didn&#39;t  <br/>
really want to do.<br/>

Yes!  Nearly all of the above.  Well, we had just eaten so I don&#39;t think she<br/>
was hungry.  She was tired, but I didn&#39;t know it until she fell asleep in<br/>
the car on the way home.  I asked her if she was tired and she said &quot;no&quot; of<br/>
course, but because of previous experience with me (my fault I know) she<br/>
thinks that being tired during the day means she has to nap.<br/>
<br/>
She did want to go in the store.  We asked her first.  She wanted to ride in<br/>
the cart, but was walking and I didn&#39;t realize this was the problem at first<br/>
as it is unlike her.  When I did realize this I fixed.<br/>
<br/>
She probably was overwhelmed, it was Toys R Us and all the colors and<br/>
activities available...  I can see that.<br/>
<br/>
I think what *I* am wanting, and maybe the other mom too, is how to deal<br/>
with things when we (we, as in the adults) make mistakes.  I know that I<br/>
need to be more observant and I am working my best at that.  AND I am<br/>
getting better, but meltdowns still happen (just much less than they used<br/>
to).  What I really need to know is what I can do when the meltdown is in<br/>
progress.  I asked Lil if she wanted to leave, but of course she didn&#39;t and<br/>
she doesn&#39;t always know the words to express what is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am not asking the wrong questions.  I know what I am doing is the<br/>
wrong way to deal with things.  What I struggle with is having a substitute<br/>
available for when *I* make mistakes.  Does that make sense?<br/>

If you&#39;ve already gotten yourselves into a situation, then you can be  <br/>
super sympathetic and resolve the situation as quickly as possible.  <br/>
Like, if you suddenly realize that walking around in toys-r-us is  <br/>
overwhelming and now she&#39;s having a meltdown, then get yourself  <br/>
really calm and soft and squat down at her level and don&#39;t look tense  <br/>
and keep your voice gentle and say soothing things. And - don&#39;t ask  <br/>
questions at that time - it adds to the frustration because the poor  <br/>
kid is already on overload and now you&#39;re expecting her to think  <br/>
clearly about what it is she wants? Be honest and sympathetic - say,  <br/>
&quot;Oh gosh, this place is kind of overwhelming. Let&#39;s go out and get  <br/>
lunch or ice cream or something, for now, and maybe come back when  <br/>
they aren&#39;t so busy.&quot; If she screams, &quot;NOOOOO I don&#39;t want to go,&quot;  <br/>
then you can move on, very gently, with, &quot;Oh, okay, then let&#39;s go  <br/>
look at the dolls for a while.&quot; In other words, you offer - don&#39;t  <br/>
ask. Then your response is based on her reaction. Try to develop your  <br/>
own interpersonal intelligence as much as you can - try to think from  <br/>
her point of view, try to offer what you think would help her be more  <br/>
happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just from your post, I felt like you&#39;re pressuring her (not meaning  <br/>
to) and that might be some of the source of her frustration. I&#39;m  <br/>
picturing a combination of you not thinking ahead well enough and you  <br/>
expecting her to be able to think ahead too well. Like, you might ask  <br/>
her, &quot;Do you want to go to Toys-R-Us?&quot; and she says, &quot;Yes,&quot; and you  <br/>
just take that as a complete answer. But you&#39;re the mom, you have to  <br/>
think deeper - why does she want to go, what is SHE thinking it will  <br/>
be like, when is a good time for her to be there, will she want to  <br/>
sit in the cart or run around, is she thinking that &quot;go&quot; means &quot;buy  <br/>
toys&quot; or maybe &quot;play with toys?&quot; You have to think about &quot;her&quot; - the  <br/>
real child and what she can handle.<br/>
And, below, you say maybe you&#39;re asking the wrong questions - I think  <br/>
maybe you&#39;re onto something there, but that it is that you&#39;re asking  <br/>
too much of her. I think maybe you&#39;re just asking too many questions.  <br/>
Think more in terms of offering, supporting, encouraging - less in  <br/>
terms of &quot;asking&quot; her to decide or choose. I think you&#39;ll find that  <br/>
reduced her frustration levels.<br/>

&gt; available for when *I* make mistakes. Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. So - from now on, before you go somewhere, have some ideas in  <br/>
mind. BEFORE you even bring it up to her, think, &quot;Okay, thinking  <br/>
about going to Toys-R-Us --- that means a series of possible  <br/>
activities -- (1) getting ready and maybe interrupting ongoing  <br/>
activities (2) car ride (3) time in the store (4) needing to leave  <br/>
the store (5) time spent in line (6) car ride afterward. You have to  <br/>
consider each of those - play out a couple of scenarios in your head  <br/>
for each so you have some options in mind before you even bring it up  <br/>
to her.<br/>
<br/>
Toys-R-Us is a pretty big deal stressful activity for a young child -  <br/>
took a fairly large amount of preparation - I might say: &quot;I&#39;m wanting  <br/>
to go to Toys-R-Us and here is what I have in mind -- going in about  <br/>
an hour, eating a sandwich before we go, getting dressed in pants and  <br/>
shirt and shoes, listening to our new Beatles cd in the car on the  <br/>
way, you can sit in the cart or walk around the store and look at  <br/>
toys and help me pick something out for your cousin&#39;s birthday  <br/>
present, if you find something you want to buy that costs less than  <br/>
$5 we can buy that, too. Does that all sound okay to you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The child might have something to say about all this - &quot;Mom, can we  <br/>
have turkey sandwiches?&quot; or &quot;I want to sit in the cart.&quot; Or whatever  <br/>
- me listing what I have in mind, what I&#39;m picturing happening, is an  <br/>
invitation for her to add to it or object to parts of it, but mostly  <br/>
it means we are less likely to get into a situation where we have  <br/>
very different expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Based on past experience, with my middle child, I would also have  <br/>
said, &quot;This is one of those stores that can be totally overwhelming,  <br/>
so if you start to feel like that, just say so and we&#39;ll cut it short.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IF she had a meltdown in Toys-R-Us, I would figure out what the  <br/>
problem was and learn from it in order not to bring it about again.  <br/>
Generalize to other similar situations. Did I not feed her enough  <br/>
before we left so she was a little hungry? Then next time, bring some  <br/>
crackers or cheese or granola bars or something along for her to  <br/>
munch on in the car on the way. Was it too much to expect her to help  <br/>
shop for toys for another child? Then eliminate that problem by not  <br/>
asking her to do it again - or maybe let her pick out something for  <br/>
herself at the same time. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
She might be, like me, really sensitive to the sound in big stores  <br/>
and shopping malls - that horrible &quot;echo&quot; kind of sound creates a lot  <br/>
of stress in me - over a period of half an hour the stress builds up  <br/>
and it is like I start not being able to think, all I can do is sort  <br/>
of protect my brain from that background sound. I get cranky, short- <br/>
tempered, really really tired. I&#39;ve mentioned this to people who  <br/>
claim they don&#39;t even know what &quot;sound&quot; I&#39;m talking about - so  <br/>
obviously it doesn&#39;t affect everyone the same way. I like the &quot;idea&quot;  <br/>
of going shopping - hanging out with my friends or daughters and  <br/>
looking, together, at clothes and things, but the reality of it, for  <br/>
me, is not at all comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
So - YOU have to figure this out - you are like a detective in a way,  <br/>
or a psychiatrist, trying to understand what your own child is like  <br/>
based on all the clues/evidence. You come to understand how she is  <br/>
experiencing the world, and then you try to support her in ways that  <br/>
work best for her.<br/>

          When begining my unschooling journey I asked what to do with a <br/>

- What is the underlying need that this child has-----<br/>
<br/>
I thought about that for a while and knew that this child needed to <br/>
be able to do the things she thought she wanted to do. I had to not <br/>
have rules and punishments BUT find a way to help her get what she <br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
So what is it that your child is angry and sad about? What does the <br/>
child want that they are NOT getting<br/>
<br/>
this child just turned 3 and now will come ask to do something wild <br/>
and crazy instead of just doing it- she is a experimentor scientist <br/>
and had to try things to understand them<br/>
<br/>
she has a need to check stuff out and see what happens without me <br/>
saying NO NO NO...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022122348">The conversation went on like this<br/>
a couple of times when he screamed out &quot;Stop talking to me! I HATE<br/>
YOU!!&quot;. So, I crouched down, said, &quot;It is okay for you to be angry at<br/>
me, or frustrated, or WHATEVER, but it is NOT okay for you to yell at<br/>
me&quot; <br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
This reminded me of something I just read in Naomi Aldort&#39;s <br/>
book &quot;Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves.&quot; She discusses the <br/>
importance of parents being strong and confident enough to &quot;absorb&quot; <br/>
whatever big feelings- rage, anger, etc- a child is needing to express. <br/>
Up to this point, it seemed you were validating him, then that changed <br/>
when he tried to express himself in a way you felt attacked and judged <br/>
it to be inappropriate. If you &quot;allow&quot; that expression in the moment, <br/>
he will feel you are a safe place to explore those big, difficult <br/>
feelings. You can always discuss later how you/other people feel when <br/>
they&#39;re yelled at, though some would go so far as to say even that is <br/>
unnecessary if we trust our children to know what appropriate social <br/>
behavior is and they will exhibit it when they&#39;re able.<br/>
<br/>
Of course preventing meltdowns in the first place is the ideal and the <br/>
other posts have been so wonderfully thorough on ways to do that. <br/>

<br/>
It could be the &quot;validation&quot; is what pissed him off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-We try to exist in a nuturing home environment, one that validates<br/>
all feelings, not just the good.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There were times and families (some still) in which children&#39;s  <br/>
feelings were universally disregarded or punished.  Then child  <br/>
psychologists and practical philosophers of various sorts saw that  <br/>
and saw that it was bad.  And so parents started being advised to  <br/>
accept that sometimes kids are cranky, and for good reasons, and not  <br/>
to punish them for expressing their honest feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Then some other advisors and parents took that to a ridiculous  <br/>
extreme, and instead of seeing it as a giant step away from the  <br/>
ignorance of the past, they turned it into the irritating ignorance  <br/>
of the future.<br/>
<br/>
Feelings can be accepted, but they&#39;re not all equally &quot;valid.&quot;  And  <br/>
it can be irritating to have someone else telling you how you feel  <br/>
long after the toddler years.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fine to tell a two year old &quot;You wish they had let you play,&quot;  <br/>
but saying &quot;You wish they had let you go with them&quot; to a fifteen year  <br/>
old isn&#39;t at ALL the same.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They were browsing around, picking<br/>
up a few things, here and there, when all of a sudden the 5 year old<br/>
yells at me, &quot;Ryan (8 yo) CAN NOT TOUCH ANY of my things. These are<br/>
mine!&quot; I responded, &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want Ryan to touch your new<br/>
things, hmm, I see&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
He just TOLD you that, why repeat it?  I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s part of  <br/>
what made him mad.<br/>
<br/>
But some thought or memory in him triggered the first statement.  I&#39;m  <br/>
guessing Ryan has forbidden him to touch some of his things.  I&#39;m  <br/>
guessing the parents backed Ryan up.  I&#39;m guessing the younger boy  <br/>
felt powerless and frustrated and was hoping for the same parental  <br/>
backup and protection of his own things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He replied (this is verbatim), &quot;Yah, I&#39;m okay; it is just so hard  <br/>
for me to feel excited.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the thought of getting new toys was reminding him of too many  <br/>
prior clashes over toys?  Would it help any if there were more toys  <br/>
that were not either of theirs specifically?<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little I already had some toys, and sometimes we&#39;d  <br/>
buy something and instead of it being one of theirs, or instead of me  <br/>
saying &quot;It belongs to both of you,&quot; I would say &quot;This one&#39;s mine.&quot;    <br/>
Then I got to say who played with it (in their minds and in reality  <br/>
both) while they were learning to share and learning what &quot;mine&quot;  <br/>
meant.  &quot;Mine&quot; doesn&#39;t need to mean &quot;nobody else ever touches it.&quot;   <br/>
But when the other people are younger, that can be scary, the thought  <br/>
that they might not take care of the thing.  And when the other  <br/>
people are older and maybe better at arguments and physically  <br/>
stronger, that&#39;s scary too.  Those fears produce stress.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I understand that being sad/angry/frustrated is okay,-=-<br/>
<br/>
This might be part of the problem.  While being sad, angry or  <br/>
frustrated should not be punishable offenses, that doesn&#39;t make them  <br/>
&quot;okay&quot; in every sense of the word.<br/>
<br/>
If you can help him avoid those things by making his life smoother  <br/>
and safer and happier, you should!  All parents should, but for  <br/>
unschooling parents it&#39;s part of the basic workings of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs (something that shows that learning  <br/>
doesn&#39;t take place under threat, and that hungry and scared people  <br/>
aren&#39;t in a state to learn much) says that for a person to be in a  <br/>
receptive state, in a happy state, there are basic needs that need to  <br/>
be taken care of first.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I understand that being<br/>
sad/angry/frustrated is okay, but is it okay<br/>
for it to override excitement and happiness? Am I overlooking<br/>
anything with helping him to feel supported?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Instead of waiting until he&#39;s unhappy to wish he was being happy,  <br/>
make the happiness the goal and the priority.  Don&#39;t support the  <br/>
frustration, try to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Am I overlooking<br/>
anything with helping him to feel supported?-=-<br/>
<br/>
 From the story you told, it seems you might be using phrases that  <br/>
sound like they came from a book instead of using your own, honest  <br/>
voice.  I&#39;ve never liked it when people have done that to me.  When  <br/>
people are changing their lives and learning new ways to be,  <br/>
sometimes they take the advice of a book very literally and use the  <br/>
exact phrase that was suggested.  Sometimes they keep on doing that  <br/>
for months or years, at which point they might be adding to the  <br/>
stress instead of alleviating it.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;I understand you&#39;re angry&quot; is better than saying &quot;Stop  <br/>
whining or I&#39;ll spank you.&quot;<br/>
So when one gets to that point of understanding, they should try to  <br/>
make even better choices about what to say in future instances.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good!  Wikipedia  has a page now on Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs.<br/>

<br/>
I want to rephrase that.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Valid,&quot; like &quot;powerful,&quot; has lots of facets.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when Holly is being pouty, I remind her that really her day  <br/>
has been going pretty well (if it has and it usually is), and that it  <br/>
seems a shame for her to focus on a negative part.  She usually sees  <br/>
what I&#39;m getting at pretty quickly and she knows how to turn her  <br/>
moods and cheer herself up pretty well.  And she wants to be happy.   <br/>
And I know some ways to remind her of that without making her  <br/>
angry.   But this has developed gradually over the years.<br/>
<br/>
I use different words every time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been around moms who use stock phrases, either their own or  <br/>
someone else&#39;s.  They use quotes (some families use Bible verses,  <br/>
others might use quotes from songs or dichos (northern New Mexico,  <br/>
families I grew up with) which are like proverbs or maxims (literally  <br/>
in English, &quot;sayings&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying NEVER say &quot;A stitch in time saves nine&quot; or whatever,  <br/>
but don&#39;t say it more than maybe twice in another person&#39;s life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When a mom uses other people&#39;s words instead of her own, she&#39;s  <br/>
creating distance between herself and her child.  It can be seen as a  <br/>
kind of ganging up, whether it&#39;s quoting religious texts (implying  <br/>
the mom and Jesus, Mohammed, Vishnu or the Reverent Moon or somebody  <br/>
both/all want the child to stop doing whatever it is), or whether the  <br/>
mom is ganging up with Benjamin Franklin or Eda LeShan or Adele Farber.<br/>
<br/>
Let those people&#39;s advice infuse you, and then try as soon as you can  <br/>
to speak with your own voice, as you would speak to a friend or  <br/>
someone you just met.  It&#39;s a form of baby-talking a child, in some  <br/>
cases, for the parents to use quotes and other people&#39;s phrases.<br/>
<br/>
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  If it bothers you  <br/>
to have people use stock phrases, don&#39;t do it to other people. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

She might be, like me, really sensitive to the sound in big stores<br/>
and shopping malls - that horrible &quot;echo&quot; kind of sound creates a lot<br/>
of stress in me - over a period of half an hour the stress builds up<br/>
and it is like I start not being able to think, all I can do is sort<br/>
of protect my brain from that background sound. I get cranky, short-<br/>
tempered, really really tired. I&#39;ve mentioned this to people who<br/>
claim they don&#39;t even know what &quot;sound&quot; I&#39;m talking about - so<br/>
obviously it doesn&#39;t affect everyone the same way.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you Pam for all your advice.  That is what I needed.  And yes,<br/>
she is VERY sensitive to sound.  A child crying, toilets flushing, the<br/>
list goes on.  It was a mistake to put her in the situation.  I see<br/>
that now and will be more mindful next time.  Thank you again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600024170">I had to laugh when I read these responses - a kind of &quot;aha! Boy did <br/>
I land in the right place&quot; kind of laugh. This is exactly it, and <br/>
this is what I&#39;m looking for. sigh. <br/>
<br/>
I was raised by fundamentalists, where controlling was the norm, and <br/>
anything but a clone of the parent was considered a failure and a <br/>
disgrace (another sigh). Strong feelings? NOT okay. And I can relate <br/>
on such a deep level to my 5yo. My partner was raised similarly = no <br/>
role models, so I have done a TON of reading (which, apparently, is <br/>
obvious :-) I&#39;m trying to create the atmosphere which I longed for as <br/>
a child, and one that will support my children. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m waiting for &quot;Raising our Children...&quot; to come in the mail, and a <br/>
couple of others. It is hard to rely solely on intuition at this <br/>
stage in my growth, unfortunately. There is nagging self-doubt, and I <br/>
guess I didn&#39;t realize how &quot;artificial&quot; my caring sounds. That&#39;s why <br/>
I so appreciate your responses. It really is like an &#39;aha&#39; moment for <br/>
me; sometimes the obvious just needs to be pointed out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2770975">my daughter does this also and I have not addressed this with her <br/>
mostly because I see it as an HONEST expression of what she is <br/>
feeling in the moment. In that moment she DOES hate me and it is ok <br/>
to hate someone in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I think it fosters REAL emotional communication instead of saying <br/>
things like &quot;it not ok to say you hate someone or do not yell at me&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Since she was little was played the &quot;I hate you&quot; game which went <br/>
like this-- not in anger but in the car I would say I love you and <br/>
she would say I hate you and I would say that ok I hate you too- she <br/>
would then say ok I love you and I would say ok I love you too<br/>
<br/>
my mom and others were astonished that we would play this dialouge <br/>
because it so goes against conventional parenting but we shurgged <br/>
our shoulders and say it is ok<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she says she is mad and does not want to interact and <br/>
sometimes I say &quot;I am mad right now&quot;- she understands it because she <br/>
is allowed to be &quot;mad right now&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Kids are very honest in their emotions and the rest of us <br/>
conventionally raised parents were taught that honest expression is <br/>
wrong and somehow bad.<br/>
<br/>
Once we were outside playing and cassie who was 4 told a friend she <br/>
hated tham and the friend came to tell me that she said that- I told <br/>
the friend that I hate you is ok to say in our house and it probably <br/>
means that she does not want to play right now. The friend looked at <br/>
me in astonishment because she expected I would tell my daughter to <br/>
not say I hate you and play nice. <br/>
<br/>
Get to a place where HONEST emotion is expected and welcomed. You <br/>
know that just because you feel something does not make it bad it <br/>
makes it real and it too passes<br/>

<br/>
I doubt she understood, when she was younger, what &quot;I hate you&quot;  <br/>
means.  She was just playing opposites, I&#39;m guessing.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve discouraged &quot;hate&quot; or hatred in any form.  Even if a kid says  <br/>
&quot;I hate spinach,&quot; we&#39;ll say &quot;You might like it when you&#39;re older.&quot;   <br/>
If they say &quot;I hate that music,&quot; we might say &quot;But Marty really likes  <br/>
it,&quot; or &quot;did you even hate it in [whichever movie]?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think when joy and optimism are the goals (which they aren&#39;t in all  <br/>
families), that it&#39;s good to help kids see that a momentary  <br/>
discomfort isn&#39;t &quot;hatred.&quot;  An aversion doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;hate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hatred hurts the person doing the hating.  If someone hates many  <br/>
things, it makes the person hateful.  Literally full of hate.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes she says she is mad and does not want to interact and<br/>
sometimes I say &quot;I am mad right now&quot;- she understands it because she<br/>
is allowed to be &quot;mad right now&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
We have that, easily.  I can say &quot;That hurt my feelings and I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to talk about it right now,&quot; but we&#39;ll talk about it at some point.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Kids are very honest in their emotions and the rest of us<br/>
conventionally raised parents were taught that honest expression is<br/>
wrong and somehow bad.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Whether any one thing is &quot;wrong&quot; or not doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t  <br/>
some things worse than other things.  An honest expression of &quot;I hope  <br/>
we get to see you next week&quot; is not simply equal but different from  <br/>
&quot;I hope I never see you again,&quot; or &quot;I hope you die.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are some things that should not be expressed, even if they&#39;re  <br/>
thought.  There are some expressions that might could use clarification.<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;I hate you&quot; your daughter means &quot;I don&#39;t want to play with you  <br/>
right now,&quot; I think for the sake of clarity, courtesy and her own  <br/>
soul you should coach her to say what she means.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Get to a place where HONEST emotion is expected and welcomed. You<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you meant to say.<br/>
I hope it&#39;s not what you meant to say.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;I hate you&quot; doesn&#39;t make it real, but it makes it closer to  <br/>
real than is good for a person.<br/>
I want my kids to learn ways to make friends and keep friends, and so  <br/>
I encourage them to be courteous and thoughtful in speech and action.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090948606">This is really timely for me. I�m feeling like such a failure right now with<br/>
my 8 yo son. We were at L&L this year, and decided then that DH and I wanted<br/>
to truly become radical unschoolers, but of course, we�re fighting our own<br/>
upbringings and the last 18 yrs of parenting (he has an 18 yo from a<br/>
previous marriage). I don�t feel that I�m failing my daughter (11) so<br/>
much�I�ve recognized that what she displays as anger (or what I perceive to<br/>
be anger) is actually just, as she put it, feeling annoyed, not angry.<br/>
There�s a big difference to her. And I�m really sensitive to others� moods,<br/>
so I get defensive, feeling it�s all my fault, whatever it is. And that the<br/>
anger or annoyance or frustration is directed at and caused by me. But I�m<br/>
reminding myself that�s not the case usually, and so I try to get a clearer<br/>
understanding from her of what is going on before jumping to conclusions. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However, with my son, I can�t have the same level of conversation. He<br/>
doesn�t want to talk about any of it. He sometimes treats me<br/>
disrespectfully/rudely at home and out in public, and that is such a trigger<br/>
for me. I usually try to continue talking calmly to him and ignore the<br/>
rudeness and hear the message. But that doesn�t always work, especially if<br/>
I�m feeling tired or particularly sensitive. Of course, it�s because I feel<br/>
like I haven�t treated him well in the past, and so this is his normal<br/>
reaction, even if I am trying to do better. I guess I was hoping that giving<br/>
him his freedom would automatically take care of all the past injustices<br/>
he�s felt. And I know that�s not realistic. But I still feel awful and just<br/>
don�t know how to understand him and his needs better. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The other day he was really rude to me and I reacted badly. Then at home, I<br/>
told DH what had happened, and how I feel it�s my fault for not doing<br/>
�something� better, and DH had a talk with him, which wasn�t the kind of<br/>
talk I wanted him to have, because he basically told Thomas that it really<br/>
upset him to see me upset and that if he found that Thomas was treating me<br/>
rudely again, he�d be in lots of trouble. Well, I don�t want him treating me<br/>
well because he�s afraid of getting in trouble!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is just not coming naturally to either of us and so I start beating<br/>
myself up over it. And the fact that I can�t explain well to DH how we�d be<br/>
better parents if we did things differently. It�s just been since September,<br/>
but I want things to be joyful and come naturally right now. I know I have<br/>
choices I can make each time, but I feel pulled into my past reactions. I<br/>
feel like I�m letting my son down each time I do this, and I just don�t know<br/>
what it is that I can do to help him, what it is he needs.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess I�m looking for help, and don�t know what my next step is. I keep<br/>
thinking, gosh, they have all this freedom now, they should see that helping<br/>
with dishes or some chore is a nice thing to do together, and then since I<br/>
don�t want to *tell* them to help I end up trying to guilt them into<br/>
helping. I recognize that. It doesn�t happen all the time, but it happens.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One recent example of how I messed up�I asked Thomas if he would bring in<br/>
one of his drink glasses from the computer desk to the kitchen, since I was<br/>
doing dishes, and he just started yelling at me about how *I* never do<br/>
anything and I make him do everything, which is the complete opposite almost<br/>
of how things really are. I recognize that either this is how he truly sees<br/>
it, or he�s just frustrated about something and this is the first thing that<br/>
comes to mind to say. But I ended up yelling at him that I�ve been doing all<br/>
the cleaning and just asked if he�d bring in one glass. On the other hand,<br/>
the same week he helped put away the silverware while I was doing the rest<br/>
of the dishes, and all I did was ask if he�d help me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I really don�t want to get beat up over this on the list, but I need help<br/>
figuring this out.<br/>
<br/>

Your kid didn&#39;t want to get beat up about bringing in a glass or  <br/>
responding badly, but he needs help figuring things out.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of direct advice as being &quot;beat up&quot; it seems you&#39;re  <br/>
declaring yourself too sensitive to accept input.   We could all coo  <br/>
and soothe you (if any of us felt like spending volunteer time to  <br/>

unschooling).  That&#39;s not what you need.<br/>

rudeness and hear the message.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t working, don&#39;t do it.  If you continue  <br/>
talking calmly when he&#39;s gotten to the point that he&#39;s emotional, how  <br/>
does that help?  Maybe not talking at all would be better.  Just  <br/>
calmly disengage, maybe.  When you feel like talking again, when  <br/>
you&#39;re not in public, when you&#39;ve calmed down, ask him if he can  <br/>
rephrase more calmly.  (That&#39;s one of many ideas; not &quot;the right  <br/>
answer.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
-=- guess I was hoping that giving him his freedom would  <br/>
automatically take care of all the past injustices he�s felt.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you apologized to him?<br/>
Have you explained (briefly, occasionally) why you&#39;ve changed?<br/>
A little explanation is better than too much.<br/>
A little apology is better than too much.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I still feel awful and just don�t know how to understand him and  <br/>
his needs better. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Gradually, one clue at a time, you can figure out how you can make  <br/>
his life more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-DH had a talk with him, which wasn�t the kind of<br/>
talk I wanted him to have, because he basically told Thomas that it  <br/>
really<br/>
upset him to see me upset and that if he found that Thomas was  <br/>
treating me<br/>
rudely again, he�d be in lots of trouble. Well, I don�t want him  <br/>
treating me<br/>
well because he�s afraid of getting in trouble!<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
You might ask your husband if he was treating your son the way he  <br/>
wants your son to treat him and you.  Kids learn better by example  <br/>
than by lecture.  It will take a while for him to trust that you&#39;ve  <br/>
changed, if you can and do change.  You&#39;re not there yet, and it will  <br/>
take a while.  Then it will take another while for him to relax and  <br/>
trust the new situation.<br/>
<br/>

Choices<br/>
<br/>
Unless you considered two or three courses of actions, you didn&#39;t  <br/>
really make a choice at all. Consciously think of two choices before  <br/>
you act�then make the better choice. Your range of choices will get  <br/>
better as you do this. While you&#39;re helping your child learn to  <br/>
choose, you can also learn to choose.<br/>
<br/>
If  you would ordinarily yell, choose between yelling and speaking  <br/>
softly.  If speaking softly works better, but you said too much, next  <br/>
time choose between saying a little bit softly or saying a lot  <br/>
softly.  Yelling is off the list, until the next time you forget to  <br/>
make a choice.  Or maybe you&#39;ll choose yelling over screaming and  <br/>
breaking something.  But think of two things each time and choose the  <br/>
one that&#39;s &quot;getting warmer&quot; in terms of the kind of mom you want to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122363989">-=-I really don’t want to get beat up over this on the list, but I  <br/>
need help<br/>
figuring this out.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your kid didn&#39;t want to get beat up about bringing in a glass or  <br/>
responding badly, but he needs help figuring things out.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of direct advice as being &quot;beat up&quot; it seems you&#39;re  <br/>
declaring yourself too sensitive to accept input.   We could all coo  <br/>
and soothe you (if any of us felt like spending volunteer time to  <br/>
keep you comfortable where you are instead of helping you get  <br/>
unschooling).  That&#39;s not what you need.<br/>
<br/>
** No, I think direct advice is what I&#39;m asking for, but I&#39;m already beating<br/>
myself up over what I feel I&#39;m doing wrong, so I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll get advice<br/>
and not recriminations. That&#39;s all I was trying to say. I know that you can<br/>
respond in ways that can be very critical or maybe just very bluntly to<br/>
parents, but that&#39;s not how you&#39;d respond to a child. I&#39;m just saying, give<br/>
me the advice, give me suggestions for changing, but don’t put me down, or<br/>
how will I listen then? Just as children deserve respect when they don&#39;t<br/>
understand and are asking for advice. I&#39;m not asking for anyone to spend<br/>
volunteer time to keep me comfortable. I wouldn&#39;t be here if I wanted to be<br/>
comfortable. I do need help with getting unschooling and I know that. **<br/>
<br/>
-=-He sometimes treats me<br/>
disrespectfully/rudely at home and out in public, and that is such a trigger<br/>
for me. I usually try to continue talking calmly to him and ignore the<br/>
rudeness and hear the message.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t working, don&#39;t do it.  If you continue  <br/>
talking calmly when he&#39;s gotten to the point that he&#39;s emotional, how  <br/>
does that help?  Maybe not talking at all would be better.  Just  <br/>
calmly disengage, maybe.  When you feel like talking again, when  <br/>
you&#39;re not in public, when you&#39;ve calmed down, ask him if he can  <br/>
rephrase more calmly.  (That&#39;s one of many ideas; not &quot;the right  <br/>
answer.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
** I can see how asking him to rephrase more calmly would work in certain<br/>
situations. In the case of remaining calm while he&#39;s angry, I was hoping<br/>
that by not getting emotional, I wouldn&#39;t be feeding his anger, that he<br/>
would see I was still talking to him and trying to understand what was going<br/>
on, even though he was upset, and sometimes that really does work, he gets<br/>
calmed down and talks to me. Obviously it doesn&#39;t work every time. Not<br/>
talking to him seems like ignoring him--do you mean something else? <br/>
I don&#39;t think that disengaging is always possible, in public, because I need<br/>
to know if he&#39;s coming inside a store with me or staying in the car, etc. If<br/>
I&#39;ve locked the doors because I think he&#39;s joining us, but he wants to get<br/>
in the car instead and yells at me, but I&#39;m already in the store, that<br/>
doesn&#39;t help. In this particular instance, which happened on Thursday and<br/>
prompted me to write in the first place, he had misunderstood where we were<br/>
going, because he wasn&#39;t listening to me while I was talking to my daughter<br/>
about how to get to the store. We were stopping at a thrift shop she wanted<br/>
to go to before it closed. My son got out of the car and started crossing<br/>
the street to go where he thought we were going. I told him where we were<br/>
actually going, tried to explain why I thought he&#39;d gotten confused, and he<br/>
started yelling that that&#39;s not what I had said earlier. Then, as we were<br/>
walking to the store, he was really angry and calling me names, etc. He<br/>
started walking back to the car. I hadn&#39;t really responded to his yelling,<br/>
other than to explain what we were doing, but did ask if he was going to<br/>
wait in the car or if he wanted to come in with us, and he kept up the<br/>
yelling. Then he came inside. While we&#39;re inside he&#39;s still angry, then sees<br/>
a large buck knife in a display case and asks if he can buy it. All of a<br/>
sudden he&#39;s not mad at me. I completely understand how this change can<br/>
happen. I was the same when I was younger--sudden mood change from angry to<br/>
happy, etc. So that&#39;s not an issue. But I don&#39;t know what I could have done<br/>
during all this instead. I am open to suggestions. I know something similar<br/>
will happen again and would like to be prepared.  **<br/>
<br/>
-=- guess I was hoping that giving him his freedom would  <br/>
automatically take care of all the past injustices he’s felt.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you apologized to him?<br/>
Have you explained (briefly, occasionally) why you&#39;ve changed?<br/>
A little explanation is better than too much.<br/>
A little apology is better than too much.<br/>
<br/>
** I&#39;ve apologized for not starting on the RU path sooner, told him I wish<br/>
we&#39;d known about this sooner, and have tried to explain why we&#39;re changing,<br/>
but he&#39;s really not interested in listening to me when he thinks I&#39;m trying<br/>
to talk &quot;seriously&quot; to him. And when I do something completely stupid and<br/>
opposite of what I *want* to be doing as a parent, I apologize. **<br/>
<br/>
-=- I still feel awful and just don’t know how to understand him and  <br/>
his needs better. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Gradually, one clue at a time, you can figure out how you can make  <br/>
his life more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
** I&#39;ve told him since the big Thursday incident that I really want to<br/>
understand him and what it is he needs. I know he can&#39;t tell me himself, he<br/>
probably doesn&#39;t know, just knows when he&#39;s not getting his particular needs<br/>
met. **<br/>
<br/>
-=-DH had a talk with him, which wasn’t the kind of<br/>
talk I wanted him to have, because he basically told Thomas that it really<br/>
upset him to see me upset and that if he found that Thomas was treating me<br/>
rudely again, he’d be in lots of trouble. Well, I don’t want him treating me<br/>

changed, if you can and do change.  You&#39;re not there yet, and it will  <br/>
take a while.  Then it will take another while for him to relax and  <br/>
trust the new situation.<br/>
<br/>
** I have, and DH was saying back in September that he was totally on board<br/>
with RU, after the conference, but he&#39;s not with the kids as much as I am<br/>
and doesn&#39;t need to be thinking about how to be different as much as I do,<br/>
because his time is limited with them. So he listens to what I say about no<br/>
chores, no rules, etc, but he still wants them to clean up after themselves.<br/>
I told him that he doesn&#39;t see the things I see during the day, that keep me<br/>
thinking this can work. He just sees a few hours in the evenings and the<br/>
weekends. He doesn&#39;t observe their behavior like I do. I&#39;m trying to explain<br/>
that this will work if we keep at it, but I&#39;m also still not getting it<br/>
completely, so I have a hard time answering his questions on what to expect<br/>
from the kids, how they&#39;ll change, how this whole thing will work out in the<br/>
end. And when I&#39;m frustrated and tell him about my big blow-up, he sees it<br/>
as a reason not to be on this path. It&#39;s frustrating to say the least. **<br/>

<br/>
Take more time to communicate in advance to him, don&#39;t expect him to  <br/>
just vicariously pick up on what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
I bet you can come to understand him better and cause less  <br/>
frustration in his life if you think more along the lines of multiple  <br/>
intelligences. I think you&#39;re expecting his to be more like yours  <br/>
(and probably your daughter&#39;s) than it is. Try to focus on making  <br/>
sure he has information, in advance, about all kinds of things  <br/>
including where you are going, what to expect there, who is going to  <br/>
be there, what the situation is likely to be, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Treat him more respectfully. I know this was just one sentence out of  <br/>
a lot of stuff you posted, but it really does indicate a lack of  <br/>
understanding of him and his needs. You&#39;re blaming his anger/ <br/>
frustration on him - it is HIS fault because HE wasn&#39;t listening when  <br/>
you were telling your daughter something?<br/>
<br/>
Instead, you could have said: &quot;I didn&#39;t tell him where we were going,  <br/>
didn&#39;t give him direct information about what to expect.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or -  &quot;I dragged him along not even bothering to tell him where we  <br/>
were going, much less making sure he was part of deciding when and  <br/>
where to go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When put that way, it probably doesn&#39;t seem very surprising that he  <br/>
got angry at you, does it?<br/>
