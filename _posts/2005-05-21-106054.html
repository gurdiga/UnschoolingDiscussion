Can someone in the U.K. or thereabout tell us what it is?<br/>
 <br/>
Holly will be involved in a party to watch it, and people are driving all  <br/>
the way from York to the far side of London (long way) to watch it  together.  <br/>
 <br/>
I found this but I still don&#39;t get it.<br/>
Might read a while to see if I can figure it out.<br/>
 <br/>
I have more on Holly and a couple of photos here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326973792">Try this website - an Unofficial info page with a bit of humor. It used to<br/>
get televised in Australia too, probably since we have one of those &quot;State<br/>
run&quot; tv networks mentioned and links to the BBC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-104028003">It is on, from 7 minutes ago.  We haven&#39;t switched over yet. <br/>
<br/>
The Eurovision song contest is a pop music contest where European<br/>
countries elect a pop band to compete.  Last year the Ukraine<br/>
won--they were really good!!  The music is often just awful.  I think<br/>
two years ago (when we didn&#39;t watch) the UK group sang off-key quite<br/>
badly. Each country votes for who they want to win.  Which makes it<br/>
quite interesting to watch for alliances.  It doesn&#39;t always matter<br/>
what the contestants sound like, if you are friendly towards that<br/>
nation, you vote for them.  <br/>
<br/>
There is live streaming from here: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119562054">We&#39;ve seen it a couple times when visiting my husband&#39;s family.  It<br/>
alternates between amusing, boring, hysterical, ear-wracking, and<br/>
musically lovely.  People all around Europe gather in homes to watch it<br/>
- and make fun of some of the artists plus register their vote for the<br/>
winner (by phone or by web).  It&#39;s not always the best musical group who<br/>
wins - it can be very political in nature.  But all good fun and a<br/>
typical European experience for Holly!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765952696">Well then!  <br/>
Thanks for the info. <br/>
I read the contest rules.  GOSH, a 50 year old contest can amass a lot  of <br/>
rules!!! Lots of rules.  There must be Eurovision lawyers.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s the news, I see:<br/>
&quot;Greece won the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest with the song  My number one, <br/>
performed by Helena Paparizou. As next year&#39;s Eurovision  Song Contest <br/>
traditionally takes place in the winning country, we will be going  to Athens next <br/>
year!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I talked to Holly during the broadcast.  She called  us.  I guess they&#39;re all <br/>
asleep now.  She sounded exhausted, after a  week at HesFes.<br/>

That&#39;s cool.  I&#39;ll mention that to Holly.  Because of The  Adventures of <br/>
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, she&#39;s an Abba fan. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
