<div id="ygrps-yiv-489669601">Hi my name is Kim and I am new to the group.  I just<br/>
removed my boys, 4th and 5th grade from public school<br/>
in January.  I had intended on Homeschooling, but<br/>
quickly learned that my children and I are really<br/>
unschooling.  Things seem to be going pretty good.  It<br/>
takes some getting used to, a de-programming period,<br/>
if you will!  However, all in all we are doing pretty<br/>
well, and learning together as we go.  Our most<br/>
difficult task is keeping the 20 month old boy<br/>
satisfied.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, Julie, what type of material do you have?  I am<br/>
in Missouri too.  Where are you located?  I am about<br/>
35- 40 miles south of St. Louis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208642204">Hi Kim,<br/>
  Welcome to the group.I&#39;m Mary.  I unschool with my 5 children in NY.  We <br/>
have a 10yog, 8yog, almost 6yob, 3 yog and a 9mob.  Unschooling is IMHO the <br/>
greatest way to homeschool.  We&#39;ve done the other methods (ordered <br/>
curriculum, mom planned lessons) and have found unschooling to be the best <br/>
way.<br/>
