you can use that to create a better environment for them. Even if they <br/>
go to school, there is better and worse.  Just read, watch your kids, <br/>
think, read some more. Focus on bringing joy into your lives - when you <br/>
are making choices, think of two and choose the one that brings more <br/>
joy, rather than less.<br/>
<br/>
But - that said, we can&#39;t help you &quot;not&quot; unschool, here on this list. <br/>
You can lurk and learn - but if you ask questions, you will hear about <br/>
how to really full-on unschool.<br/>

Social needs are still social needs ... no matter *how* you&#39;re<br/>
homeschooling. The needs of your children to meet, talk, and play with<br/>
others will be yours alone probably completely outside school. We know<br/>
school kids through church, playing at the park, etc., and that relies on<br/>
the parents getting children to events where they can interact with other<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re not actually unschooling, that does not say you and your<br/>
children couldn&#39;t meet with and get to know other unschoolers. I&#39;m sure<br/>
you&#39;d be welcome to learn from others if that&#39;s what you&#39;re interested in.<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;ve been homeschooling and using a curriculum and your kids are 10, 14, <br/>
and nearly 18 and they don&#39;t know how to read, spell, or do math, I don&#39;t see <br/>
how homeschooling is any better than any kind of unschooling.  Using a <br/>
curriculum is supposed to insure that kids can read, spell, and do math, <br/>
especially by the time they reach 18.  A 10 yr old might still not spell or read <br/>
or do math with the ease of an older kid.  Is that the child of concern?<br/>
<br/>
There are ways that kids learn these things without a curriculum.  There are <br/>
kids who finish high school without these skills and they&#39;ve had professionally <br/>
trained people with all the &quot;right&quot; materials helping them.<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a lot to be learned by reading, but when it comes to learning something that&#39;s both hands-on and social, there&#39;s a whole lot of learning that can only come by doing.<br/>
<br/>
Read a little, try a little, wait a little, watch.<br/>
<br/>
Until you try stepping away from the curriculum, there are aspects to unschooling you won&#39;t &quot;get&quot;. Just like if you read and read about riding a horse there would be things that would seem to make sense... until you actually got on the horse and tried putting it all into practice. <br/>
<br/>
Read a bit at all those links for idea and try them. Try describing more of the fun stuff in terms that help your husband see learning happening. Build up your confidence and his so that you can try some more. <br/>

<br/>
Ideas don&#39;t need to be expensive.  Ideas don&#39;t even need to cost money.  Ideas <br/>
are ideas, they come from your head.  Ideas start somewhere and they grow as you <br/>
feed them.  It seems to me, that either you are lacking for any initial spark, <br/>
or you aren&#39;t feeding it to let it grow and evolve into new and interesting <br/>
ideas, ones you can work with. <br/>
<br/>
An idea, any little idea can become something big and life changing.  If you <br/>
take away any perceived goal, it might help.  I have one kid who loves make up. <br/>
 She&#39;s loved it so much that it&#39;s grown and changed and added to our lives in <br/>
ways I never could have imagined when I was simply supplying eye liner and <br/>
interesting palettes with time and interest on my part.<br/>
<br/>
Being sparkly starts with a spark and then letting it grow without getting in <br/>
the way and simultaneously intentionally helping it get bigger.<br/>

Holly said the other night that she was sorry she had spent so much  <br/>
money on makeup in her life.  She&#39;s 18.   My parents didn&#39;t let me  <br/>
wear makeup until I was 15.  So I waited and waited and then wore  <br/>
makeup.  Holly was allowed to wear makeup and she wore it for real,  <br/>
and played with it, and did art on her face with it.  I would buy  <br/>
things for her; later she bought some of her own, and was gifted with  <br/>
makeup by women who used it and knew her interest.   Now she&#39;s pretty  <br/>
much done, for now.<br/>
<br/>
Never in there did I attach to that, not by predicting what she might  <br/>
do with it to make money as an adult, nor in judgmental ways about  <br/>
whether she should not be using it, or using it differently,  It was  <br/>
just makeup.  It wasn&#39;t morality or a future career that she was or  <br/>
was not &quot;succeeding&quot; at.<br/>

-=-There&#39;s a lot to be learned by reading, but when it comes to  <br/>
learning something that&#39;s both hands-on and social, there&#39;s a whole  <br/>
lot of learning that can only come by doing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even people who &quot;get it&quot; (and demonstrate by doing it) still &quot;get it&quot;  <br/>
more fully and more deeply several other times, later on.  There is no  <br/>
one single &quot;getting it,&quot; because the parents have their own layers and  <br/>
layers of history and traumas they might not even think about until  <br/>
the child hits the age the parent was when Something Happened-- <br/>
something scary, frustrating, sorrowful or confusing.  And I missed  <br/>
some of those by having a boy turn that age that came around when my  <br/>
daughter did.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a collection of &quot;getting it&quot; stories:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660964250">Have you searched Yahoo groups for free groups in your area? In some areas, there are a dozen groups (or more). I learn about all sorts of events by belonging to multiple groups. If your kids are really needing socialization *now*, trying more than one group would probably be better than hanging your hopes on just one.<br/>

&gt; I did find a local homeschool support group which I have requested membership from at only $6/year per family. The girls are excited about the opportunity to make new friends. We go to church, too. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Social needs are still social needs ... no matter *how* you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschooling. The needs of your children to meet, talk, and play with<br/>
&gt; &gt; others will be yours alone probably completely outside school.<br/>

Lovely, I do this with Gourika, my DD. I just do it for her because it makes<br/>
her soooo happy. She also loves flashy shoes and clothes. I indulge her for<br/>
her happiness for that moment.<br/>
