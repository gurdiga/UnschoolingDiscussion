Amy Hollingsworth discovers a road less traveled in homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
CBN.com -  Amy is a Regent University Graduate in counseling. She has <br/>
written numerous articles on home schooling that have been published <br/>
in &quot;Home Education Magazine.&quot; She&#39;s also had her work appear on <br/>
various web sites. She wrote a chapter for a book called &quot;Christian <br/>
UN-schooling.&quot; Next week, Amy begins teaching psychology at Mary <br/>
Washington college while continuing tohome school her two children, <br/>
Jonathan, age 9, and Emily, age 7.<br/>
<br/>
Amy says the &quot;hot topic&quot; that everyone including &quot;Time Magazine&quot; and <br/>
&quot;ABC News&quot; is talking about right now is that home schooling is no <br/>
longer a movement of the religious right. Lots of people, both <br/>
religious and non-religious, are doing it.<br/>
