Hi! I&#39;ve been reading this list for a couple months, this is the topic <br/>
that&#39;s begged my reply, so I need to introduce myself, my name is Larla. I&#39;m <br/>
a grown unschooler from NJ, age twenty, who&#39;s learned to use the world as my <br/>
teacher including books, textbooks, kind folks, art supplies, and even <br/>
schools. I&#39;m finishing my last year at Sarah Lawrence College in New York, <br/>
studying theater (multimedia activist performance art) and educational <br/>
reform, cause I&#39;ve got a lot of empathy for kids that have unfree schools <br/>
and don&#39;t yet have the options to leave school...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going into education for a little while as a theater teacher to <br/>
facilitate free expression in schools and help deconstruct emotional, <br/>
academic and physical walls that keep kids in school... am writing a book <br/>
called Homeschooling, The Arts, and Educational Reform, which is why I <br/>
subscribed to this list. If anybody has any suggestions of books to read <br/>
that will help me articulate ideas of unschooling, my goal is to share the <br/>
things that I&#39;ve learned from unschooling and arts with teachers, artists, <br/>
parents and kids, to help inspire change toward holistic free learning in <br/>
and out of schools.<br/>
<br/>
okay, and the reason that i am writing now is cause i agree with sandra, <br/>
that forcing anyone to use any particular book is not unschooling. however, <br/>
books are neutral tools in the world like any other tool. if made to use a <br/>
book the kid may well resent the book. if a kid chooses to use a book and <br/>
truly wants to learn what&#39;s inside it, that is a valid unschooling choice <br/>
and positive use of a tool whether it is a math textbook or calvin and <br/>
hobbes comic book.<br/>
<br/>
math is indeed a language that is used to decribe the world, and most of us <br/>
have learned languages with the help of books. it is dangerous to learn only <br/>
from books, yet i think it is dangerous also to say flat out that what <br/>
another is doing is not unschooling. i chose to use lots of books as an <br/>
unschooler, chose to abandon them when they were boring. if your kids are <br/>
learning everything they want to without books, that&#39;s all good, and if they <br/>
one day say, mama i want to read this book now! then that&#39;s all good too and <br/>
i&#39;m fairly confident that your unschooling path is wide enough to accomodate <br/>
and make connections between that book and everything else in the world.<br/>
<br/>
to the mama bear who&#39;s wondering about the math books she&#39;s using, maybe the <br/>
kid needs a break from math books. or from being told to use them. in the <br/>
meantime find the math in everyday life, cooking and sewing and buying <br/>
groceries and drawing patterns, and if a math book becomes an interest to <br/>
little bear, maybe check out saxon math texts, i used them as a kid, liked <br/>
them cause they had lessons i could teach myself from and included lots of <br/>
examples from real life including science language and experiments, i was <br/>
into science...<br/>
<br/>
keep in mind tho that i liked them only after a long break from math, and <br/>
only when i had picked them out, chose how much to do from them at any given <br/>
time, checked my own work with full access to the teacher&#39;s manual and <br/>
answer guide, fixed my own mistakes with a little input from my papa, and <br/>
was free to skip problems in their often lengthy problem sets, and of <br/>
course, was free to bring the book to the park or coffee shop and to do <br/>
countless hours of doing &#39;nothing&#39;, painting, biking, running around, <br/>
climbing trees, and reading other interesting books.<br/>
<br/>
hmmm a lengthy intro, many thanks to the thoughts that reach me every day <br/>
from this very conscious group of people.<br/>
peace and love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29555690">First off, hi, and I agree with most of what you said.  What I&#39;m curious<br/>
about is, in what way do you think it is dangerous to say what someone is<br/>
doing is not unschooling?  The word unschooling has to mean SOMETHING, just<br/>
like any other word, and I feel very confident in saying that making someone<br/>
do math is not unschooling.  Of course, if my kids want to use a textbook<br/>
(or any other resource), pick it up themselves, and use it how and when they<br/>
choose to that can be part of their unschooling experience.  But if I tell<br/>
my kids, &quot;it&#39;s math time, here&#39;s your book&quot;, or if I make sure we play<br/>
Yahtzee once a week to sneak some math in they are not directing their own<br/>
learning; they are NOT unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;m curious about (but this part isn&#39;t directed at Larla), is<br/>
why people are so anxious to be called unschoolers.  If a parent doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to send their kids to school, but believes they need to be taught<br/>
certain subjects, we have a word for that -  homeschooler.  For me it&#39;s a<br/>
totally different set of beliefs.    -Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485878762">Larla,<br/>
It is really nice to hear form grown homeschoolers.  I personally love it.<br/>
There are many times I doubt, just like most of us do.  Other times I feel just<br/>
fine with our own way of doing things.  This is all normal human behavior, I<br/>
think.<br/>
On the subject of unschooling/homeschooling.  I don&#39;t think it matters one way<br/>
or the other.  I don&#39;t care what if what we do is called anything.  It is just<br/>
life, and we do it to the best we can at each moment.  All I know is we don&#39;t<br/>
send our kids to school.  Beyond that we are just exploring, living, being....<br/>
I think that is why when someone starts asking me alot of questions about<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling...or how I do it, I am usually stymied.  We just &quot;do&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We use whatever we want, whenever we want it...<br/>
Like paper hats and salamanders.  Chicken coops to computers.  I could go on and<br/>
on (even more than I already have)<br/>
Anyway..it is great to hear from you grown homeschoolers.  Sometimes I do worry,<br/>
and when I hear that you&#39;ve done it, your happy, and enjoying life, then I know<br/>
I truly am doing the right thing.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br>Some of us fall between the cracks. &nbsp;Maybe you would think I should just say

<br>&nbsp;I think some of the ideas appeal and they work some of the time for some of

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957012255">Larla, It is so encouraging to hear from a grown unschooler! I struggle with<br/>
meeting expectations and trying not to pressure my children in what they<br/>
learn. I have a Question for you. did you find it dificult going into a<br/>
college environment? Do you think you had more confidence in yourself<br/>
because of your educational lifestyle? I have 5 children of school age and<br/>
my 16 year old daughter has been homeschooled for only three years. I am<br/>
just now learning about unschooling and am fascinated by it.Thanks for your<br/>

&gt; that forcing anyone to use any particular book is not unschooling.<br/>
however,<br/>
&gt; books are neutral tools in the world like any other tool. if made to use a<br/>
&gt; book the kid may well resent the book. if a kid chooses to use a book and<br/>
&gt; truly wants to learn what&#39;s inside it, that is a valid unschooling choice<br/>
&gt; and positive use of a tool whether it is a math textbook or calvin and<br/>
&gt; hobbes comic book.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; math is indeed a language that is used to decribe the world, and most of<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; have learned languages with the help of books. it is dangerous to learn<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; from books, yet i think it is dangerous also to say flat out that what<br/>
&gt; another is doing is not unschooling. i chose to use lots of books as an<br/>
&gt; unschooler, chose to abandon them when they were boring. if your kids are<br/>
&gt; learning everything they want to without books, that&#39;s all good, and if<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; one day say, mama i want to read this book now! then that&#39;s all good too<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; i&#39;m fairly confident that your unschooling path is wide enough to<br/>
accomodate<br/>
&gt; and make connections between that book and everything else in the world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; to the mama bear who&#39;s wondering about the math books she&#39;s using, maybe<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; kid needs a break from math books. or from being told to use them. in the<br/>
&gt; meantime find the math in everyday life, cooking and sewing and buying<br/>
&gt; groceries and drawing patterns, and if a math book becomes an interest to<br/>
&gt; little bear, maybe check out saxon math texts, i used them as a kid, liked<br/>
&gt; them cause they had lessons i could teach myself from and included lots of<br/>
&gt; examples from real life including science language and experiments, i was<br/>
&gt; into science...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; keep in mind tho that i liked them only after a long break from math, and<br/>
&gt; only when i had picked them out, chose how much to do from them at any<br/>
given<br/>
&gt; time, checked my own work with full access to the teacher&#39;s manual and<br/>
&gt; answer guide, fixed my own mistakes with a little input from my papa, and<br/>
&gt; was free to skip problems in their often lengthy problem sets, and of<br/>
&gt; course, was free to bring the book to the park or coffee shop and to do<br/>
&gt; countless hours of doing &#39;nothing&#39;, painting, biking, running around,<br/>
&gt; climbing trees, and reading other interesting books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hmmm a lengthy intro, many thanks to the thoughts that reach me every day<br/>
&gt; from this very conscious group of people.<br/>
&gt; peace and love,<br/>
&gt; larla dey maloney :-)<br/>
