<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741762126">A friend on another list (you&#39;re gonna get fed-up of me saying this, I <br/>
know) has a daughter who&#39;s going for surgery for kidney-bladder <br/>
reflux next week.  She&#39;s desperate for some support, does anyone <br/>
know of any email lists or suchlike specifically for this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, everyone<br/>
Tracy</div>
