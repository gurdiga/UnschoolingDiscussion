<div id="ygrps-yiv-101229028">I highly suggest the Movie &quot;Balto&quot;<br/>
NOT DOG NOT WOLF<br/>
examine the expression on his face when he realizes he does not fit in<br/>
anywhere. How would you feel in his position? How well would you like to be<br/>
the one who made him feel like that?<br/>
Workbooks as time fillers you know the&quot; Mom I&#39;m board bit.&quot; I point to them<br/>
and say well you could work in your book. Usually they find something else<br/>
to do something with real educational value. LOL<br/>
It is also note able that I have Post Polio Syndrome which means I sometimes<br/>
have to spend days in bed. When they have to keep quiet because light and<br/>
sound are excruciating. Making games and the like keep me busy, and feeling<br/>
usefull, while being quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Yes we do have structure but i discovered it quite by accident. Just keeping<br/>
the &quot;log&quot; of our school days. It looks good on paper should anyone ask &quot;so<br/>
what have you been doing&quot;<br/>
Have you ever researched Biological time clocks (structured lives) we just<br/>
watched some lectures fromm http://www.hhmi.org or<br/>
http://www.holidaylectures.org/webcast<br/>
We found it very interesting. Lin III found them while researching genetic<br/>
engineering. Have fun learning something new every day.<br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone is trying to make you feel alone here...this IS <br/>
an unschooling support board though. The goal is to support and <br/>
define life within the unschooling context.<br/>
Things that don&#39;t sound like unschooling will get pointed out.<br/>
Not in an effort to make anyone feel bad, but to keep the &quot;spirit of <br/>
unschooling&quot; clear.<br/>
If what you are doing works for your family that is wonderful! It&#39;s <br/>
just hard to label some of that unschooling.<br/>
yk?<br/>
Sorry for your health problems.<br/>
It would be hard.<br/>
Try to understand the intent of people posting to keep a clear <br/>
picture of what unschooling is, for those that are new and seeking it <br/>
is especially important to get a &quot;feel&quot; for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226326959">I guess this Group is not for me either then. Because I do feel <br/>
rejected, Our local group is no help either because they feel we do <br/>
nothing! They feel All learning has to be spoon fed. That children <br/>
would never want to do workbooks on their own and I guess the <br/>
consensis is the same here among unschooler.<br/>
