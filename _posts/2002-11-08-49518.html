<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868696449">Hey dear listmates-<br/>
<br/>
I need some help here. <br/>
<br/>
My children are all interested in drama - especially my daughter, Nell 16.<br/>
There is an exceptional drama program offered through the public<br/>
highschools here. . . and she cannot participate. Why? - she homeschools.<br/>
Unfair? - yes. I have friends on the mainland who homeschool/unschool and<br/>
several of their children are involved in French Club, running track,<br/>
choral groups, Science clubs, etc with their public schools - no problem.<br/>
However, the Hawaii statutes are really clear on the subject -<br/>
homeschoolers may not participate. On discussing this with a very<br/>
sympathetic state representative - she asked if I could gather copies of<br/>
some state statutes from other states and we could sit down and talk and<br/>
perhaps introduce some action on this. I feel motivated to take this<br/>
somewhere - so I need help. If anyone might have access to a copy of their<br/>
states&#39; statutes on homeschooling, especially as it applies to<br/>
homeschoolers participation in public school activities, I would appreciate<br/>
getting a copy - either by snailmail or email.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks.<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785862247">Hi Lee,<br/>
May I suggest talking to the local HS group about this first? There may be <br/>
some people who would NOT like you to open up this controversial subject and <br/>
it would be nice to let them know. They may agree or not but at least let <br/>
them know that you are requesting a change in the current law.<br/>

<br/>
She CAN participate, but she needs to be enrolled in school, so the school <br/>
will get the funding to cover her and so their insurance will cover her, and <br/>
so they will have proper authority over her.  <br/>
<br/>
Few schools even allow visitors anymore.  And more than sitting in a <br/>
classroom, things like theatre involve the danger of bodily harm.<br/>
<br/>
-=- she asked if I could gather copies of<br/>

<br/>
Some states go district by district.<br/>
<br/>
Some districts here require a kid to enroll half time, but they might require <br/>
you to take &quot;solids&quot; and not &quot;electives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The schools are not like the library.  People enroll.  Those who are enrolled <br/>
are allowed by law to be there and those who aren&#39;t aren&#39;t allowed by law to <br/>
be there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been that way for a long, long time.<br/>

<br/>
I think the other part of the issue that it&#39;s valuable to look at is how<br/>
does the law dictate tax money flowing to the schools.  I would bet that<br/>
schools in states that allow teens to do high school activities only if<br/>
they enroll for half a day only get funding for kids that attend half a<br/>
day.  And the funding that they get may be full funding, not half.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the money!  Carpe dinero!  Cherchez le funds!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043114843">In the meantime, find out about your local community theatre. My 12 yo <br/>
is in that, along with some other homeschoolers, and it has been <br/>
wonderful. There won&#39;t be as many parts for them as with a school group, <br/>
but they don&#39;t have to wait until high school to participate either. <br/>
Additionally, some groups run summer drama camps for kids. Another <br/>
option is to use 4H or some other means to start a small group yourself. <br/>
My 12 yo is putting together a group of teens to write and perform small <br/>
environmental plays at local festivals. She&#39;s writing the script for a <br/>
play that would be a sequel to the Lorax. (she never liked the end.) She <br/>
also makes movies, casting herself, siblings, and friends.<br/>
<br/>
I think what you want to do is great, but there are other options for in <br/>
the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>

You should go over to the NHEN legislative discussion message boards and <br/>
get some input there. Don&#39;t do this without input from other homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Also - there are summaries of all states&#39; laws there and links to more <br/>
information.<br/>
