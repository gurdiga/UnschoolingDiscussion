 </span></blockquote>Susan and all those who think &quot;no limits on tv&quot; means the tv will be on <br/>
constantly....<br/>
<br/>
that just isn&#39;t the case in unschooling families that I know of that <br/>
have no limits.<br/>
<br/>
The kids have interests that they are involved in and that keep them <br/>
busy and the kids become selective about what they want to watch. They <br/>
choose to watch or not - they aren&#39;t just drawn in and glued to the tv <br/>
with their brains disengaged.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little I simply made them offers they didn&#39;t want to <br/>
refuse, to join me in other activities -- not because I thought tv was <br/>
evil or dangerous, but partly because, like you, I&#39;m bugged by the <br/>
sound. Sometimes we&#39;d sit in front of the tv, with it on, and get <br/>
started with something and, when they were involved, I&#39;d ask, &quot;Can we <br/>
turn the tv off - the sound is bothering me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of just going with &quot;no limits&quot; -- maybe you could just stop <br/>
thinking about the tv one way or the other - but focus on providing <br/>
such a stimulating interesting exciting environment and enjoying that <br/>
with your kids?<br/>
<br/>
And - consider wireless headphones for the tv - they&#39;re a blessing for <br/>
those of us who get cranky when there is background sound going too <br/>
much of the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638784852">&lt;&lt;So last week I decided to take the plunge and let the kids spend as much<br/>
time as they wanted watching tv and playing on the computer.  By late<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
What do you say to your husband about how you feel? <br/>
<br/>
It�s ok to say to the kids, �Hey guys that�s a little too loud for me.�  Try<br/>
to avoid �Turn down that crap!!! I can�t stand it anymore!!!� ;)<br/>
<br/>
We bought Jayn a set of small and comfy headphones for her TV. I don�t know<br/>
if they will also work with the computer yet.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the sound of someone doing something we don�t agree with<br/>
wholeheartedly can be more grating than if we were genuinely supportive of<br/>
it. Sometimes it is just plain too loud. My dh is a ham radio operator �<br/>
sometimes it is like having five boring strangers in your living room having<br/>
a boring conversation about how stupid and boring the other guy is.<br/>
Occasionally it is funny or informative. I usually go to the other room when<br/>
he is doing a big session. If I need to be right there and tuning it out<br/>
hasn�t worked, I say, �Honey, that�s a little too loud�. Generally he just<br/>
hasn�t noticed my discomfort. He also has a set of headphones. Hey wait a<br/>
minute�I�m the only one without headphones! <br/>
<br/>
(PS: The actual amount of time on will likely decrease once the kids truly<br/>
realize you aren�t going to go back to limiting.)<br/>

Ask them to turn it down? Maybe get earphones for the kids and the husband? <br/>
Earplugs for you? Or take a walk/get out of the house? <br/>
<br/>
It bothers me sometimes too. We have three TVs. Duncan likes to play the <br/>
video games or watch cartoons in the den with me, but sometimes I ask him to take <br/>
it up to his room so that I can have some quiet. Cameron&#39;s TV is hardly ever <br/>
on. He listens to music or is playing music most of the time now. Ben & I don&#39;t <br/>
turn it on anymore unless there&#39;s something we want to watch; but when we <br/>
first got married, it was constant.<br/>

Hi from another Susan!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you did this, but when I let go of tv<br/>
restrictions, I let the kids watch as much as they<br/>
wanted, play nintendo as much as they wanted, play on<br/>
the computer, etc. and I walked away, thinking that<br/>
was what I was supposed to do.<br/>
<br/>
I got on my computer and spent way too much time<br/>
sitting here reading the archives at<br/>
Unschoolingdiscussion and all the other lists, looking<br/>
stuff up, playing games, did the housework and<br/>
laundry, read books, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t try to engage the kids on any level.  I threw<br/>
some food their direction at the proper times of the<br/>
day, and that was about it.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder they never turned off the tv!  I didn&#39;t sit<br/>
and watch with them, I didn&#39;t make suggestions about<br/>
going places or things we could do together.<br/>
<br/>
I kept thinking, &quot;when they have had enough they will<br/>
turn it off and come ask me for something else to do.&quot;<br/>
 It wasn&#39;t until I read a post here that said<br/>
something to the effect that turning on the tv and not<br/>
offering (strewing) other things is not good.  That if<br/>
tv is the only choice offered, why would they choose<br/>
anything else?<br/>
<br/>
Now they choose to watch tv a lot, and we do, but I<br/>
might also say, &quot;Does anyone want to make cookies?  go<br/>
to the store?  hey, the new air and space museum is<br/>
open, let&#39;s go check it out!&quot; and they are just as<br/>
likely to choose one of those things.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion here that was most helpful to me<br/>
was not to just drop all restrictions all at once, but<br/>
to just say &quot;yes&quot; more and more when asked, and ease<br/>
into it.  <br/>
<br/>
When I dropped all the restrictions at once the first<br/>
time we tried it, the kids were sort of scared and<br/>
lost, didn&#39;t adjust well, and I threw up my hands and<br/>
declared that unschooling didn&#39;t work and went back to<br/>
our miserable way of doing things because it felt<br/>
safer.  <br/>
<br/>
This time we eased into it a bit more slowly, and as<br/>
we (I) gained confidence, and said &quot;yes&quot; more and<br/>
more, the kids have felt safe and cared for and free<br/>
all at once.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

There is usally a phase that the kids will go through where they <br/>
really will sit and watch tv or play on the computer all day, simply <br/>
to see if you will stick to your &quot;no limits&quot; new attitude.  I think <br/>
that, as they realize that you really will not go back to limiting <br/>
their time, this will slack off.  <br/>
<br/>
However, you have to make sure that there are other options <br/>
available to them.  My DD watches tv or movies a lot.  If you read <br/>
some of my old posts, this used to bother me, and sometimes still <br/>
does until I start to notice that she&#39;s not just watching tv.  She <br/>
is playing with her toys, turning on her radio and singing along, <br/>
getting out her books and reading them, playing story games with me, <br/>
playing board games with me.  And, if the weather permits, we go to <br/>
the park a lot or go out do other things that we all enjoy as a <br/>
family.  She can be really into a movie or tv show and, as soon as I <br/>
say, &quot;let&#39;s go play with Blue (her dog)&quot; she turns around and heads <br/>
straight for the back door.  Or if I say &quot;Karen, want to go out and <br/>
do _______&quot; she looks at me and yells &quot;yes!&quot;  Just make sure that <br/>
there are other options available to them. <br/>
<br/>
As for the noise, I like to have the tv on for background noise <br/>
myself.  I can be cleaning or cooking or even reading and I will <br/>
still have the tv on.  So, I can&#39;t help you there...hopefully others <br/>
can.  :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Continuous noise really gets to me, and I live with 5 children age 6-15 and 3 <br/>
TV&#39;s, 2 computers, PS 2, and N64 in a rather small apartment.  All of us also <br/>
like to listen to music and play several instruments!  It is not unusual to <br/>
find everybody in the same room singing different songs!  Two of my children <br/>
also seem to have problems with a lot of background noise.  The other 3 seem to <br/>
think *the noisier, the better*.  Here are some things I&#39;ve done to help me <br/>
deal.<br/>
<br/>
We try to separate sources of noise as much as possible...one computer <br/>
upstairs, one down; same with the video games.  Everybody is encouraged to shut <br/>
doors to avoid spreading noises to other parts of the house.  We have headphones <br/>
available for people to use when they are listening to things by themselves.  <br/>
These are used most often by Emily who likes to watch music DVD&#39;s on the main <br/>
TV.  Everybody feels free to ask others to turn things down if they start to <br/>
feel stressed out by the noise levels.  We all try to be respectful of each <br/>
other and take turns having our favorite *sources of noise* on.  Everybody also <br/>
turns anything off if they&#39;ve stopped listening/watching.  Sometimes if I&#39;m the <br/>
one with a problem, I&#39;ll go for a walk by myself or invite one of my children <br/>
to go with me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395977870">When we first got the TV, I was really irritated by the noise too. What <br/>
worked for me was to take a deep breath and realize that this, too, will <br/>
pass. At first they watched constantly, but now only when they want to, <br/>
and I&#39;m also not so used to the silence. It&#39;s better.<br/>

<br/>
So how do you handle it with your dh?<br/>
<br/>
Our kids have the right to as much respect (possibly more) than we show<br/>
other adults.  Do you tell dh it is time to turn off the tv and do something<br/>
useful?  Do you resent the noise?  Do you stare daggers at him, hoping he<br/>
will turn it off?  Do you keep your mouth shut and find something to<br/>
entertain yourself?  Do you watch with him?<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest, if the tv is annoying to you, you go find you something to<br/>
do for a few weeks and let the kids explore the tv.  They will watch some<br/>
really cool stuff and some real fluff and some stuff that may make you<br/>
uncomfortable.  This is why it would be better for you to quit worrying<br/>
about what annoys you and spend some time with your kids doing what seems<br/>
important to them.  They will want to share the really cool stuff with you<br/>
and you will want to share the &quot;uncomfortable stuff&quot; with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142177986">Okay, I am probably speaking waaaay out of turn here since I&#39;m brand <br/>
new to unschooling and this list... It&#39;s just that so much about <br/>
unschooling is making sense to me right now, but I am having a <br/>
really hard time getting my head around this one. I am just finding <br/>
it so counterintuitive that there is so much support for television <br/>
among unschoolers. I assumed people would have access to television, <br/>
but it surprises me that people are comfortable with making it a <br/>
such a large part of their lives. If it&#39;s considered undesirable for <br/>
a child to sit in a classroom being fed someone elses curriculum on <br/>
someone elses schedule, how is TV any better? I guess I think of TV <br/>
as just network curriculum on network schedule usually with some <br/>
advertising to boot. It doesn&#39;t seem equivalent to having firsthand <br/>
life experiences, as isn&#39;t it just a way of watching other people&#39;s <br/>
(mostly fabricated) third or fourthhand life experiences through a <br/>
lens? I don&#39;t hate TV, but I definitely don&#39;t put it on equal <br/>
footing with a lot of other activies.  Is it just about letting the <br/>
child make the choice? Are subject matter and program ratings <br/>
controlled by the child as well? These are probably sounding like <br/>
boring newbie questions, but, as I said, I&#39;m just hitting a major <br/>
blindspot here. If my kids don&#39;t watch TV, would unschoolers tell me <br/>
to turn it on, or is it just that if my kids are already watching <br/>
that I shouldn&#39;t tell them when to turn it off?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience,<br/>

they can experience Mars on the Internet live in real time, right now? And isn&#39;t <br/>
reading a book even further removed from firsthand life experience than <br/>
viewing? Do you recoil from reading based on this same reasoning?<br/>
<br/>
       You know, it&#39;s possible for the act of reading itself to be a <br/>
firsthand and extremely engaging experience. That&#39;s how I&#39;ve always felt about <br/>
reading, and it seems to have rubbed off on my kids. But we&#39;re exactly the same way <br/>
about movies and plays and opera and television too. Live or filmed or aired on <br/>
tv or printed on the page or merely observed in a train station, we&#39;re drawn <br/>
to the Power of Story in every form. <br/>
<br/>
       About being new to unschooling and just not getting this part, I <br/>
wonder if it would help you to articulate to yourself exactly what it is you do get <br/>
about it. Why you are drawn to it and how you picture it being good for your <br/>
kids. Then it might be easier to see tv within that frame instead of through <br/>
the teaching-judging-evaluating frame. I&#39;ve come to believe what&#39;s wrong about <br/>
school isn&#39;t so much the stuff it imposes on kids. It&#39;s what it takes away or <br/>
diminishes or spoils.  JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494537364">Thanks, your response was very insightful. I guess I am trying to <br/>
resolve two things here, the first is my own logical disconnect from <br/>
my understanding of unschooling and the role of TV (I just didn&#39;t <br/>
expect to find the enthusiasm for TV here that I did - feeling TV <br/>
was a bit schoolish) and the second thing was coming to terms with <br/>
my own issues surrounding TV in my own home. I got the impression <br/>
from this board that if I didn&#39;t embrace the TV I wasn&#39;t really <br/>
embracing an important element of unschooling, and I&#39;m a bit <br/>
skeptical about whether I can make that leap. The first question, <br/>
I&#39;m pretty close on, but I have a ways to go on the second. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t put reading in the same category as TV since it <br/>
leaves so much more to the imagination - relying on the reader to <br/>
create a substantial body of original supplementary material, <br/>
whereas TV does so much of that for you. I agree that there are many <br/>
things TV does better than any other medium, but I have a hard time <br/>
accepting that it should recieve equal weight to other activities, <br/>
or be accepted entirely uncritically.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess that&#39;s what hangs me up here - I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s so much <br/>
what&#39;s wrong with TV, or a particular program, but I think it has a <br/>
tendency speak louder than other media (flashier, available 24x7, <br/>
easier to absorb, so many channels) and crowd out other things. I <br/>
guess I am just someone who sees real value in a little boredom. I <br/>
know when my son has a few minutes of it, that&#39;s when his best ideas <br/>
seem to hit, and I worry that the TV will interfere with that... I <br/>
know it does for me. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am enjoying reading everything on this board a great deal, <br/>
thanks for being here.<br/>

&gt;        Why use this criterion to limit what&#39;s available to your <br/>
kids, when <br/>
&gt; they can experience Mars on the Internet live in real time, right <br/>
now? And isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; reading a book even further removed from firsthand life experience <br/>
than <br/>
&gt; viewing? Do you recoil from reading based on this same reasoning?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;        You know, it&#39;s possible for the act of reading itself to be <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; firsthand and extremely engaging experience. That&#39;s how I&#39;ve <br/>
always felt about <br/>
&gt; reading, and it seems to have rubbed off on my kids. But we&#39;re <br/>
exactly the same way <br/>
&gt; about movies and plays and opera and television too. Live or <br/>
filmed or aired on <br/>
&gt; tv or printed on the page or merely observed in a train station, <br/>
we&#39;re drawn <br/>
&gt; to the Power of Story in every form. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;        About being new to unschooling and just not getting this <br/>
part, I <br/>
&gt; wonder if it would help you to articulate to yourself exactly what <br/>
it is you do get <br/>
&gt; about it. Why you are drawn to it and how you picture it being <br/>
good for your <br/>
&gt; kids. Then it might be easier to see tv within that frame instead <br/>
of through <br/>
&gt; the teaching-judging-evaluating frame. I&#39;ve come to believe what&#39;s <br/>
wrong about <br/>
&gt; school isn&#39;t so much the stuff it imposes on kids. It&#39;s what it <br/>
takes away or <br/>
&gt; diminishes or spoils.  JJ<br/>

9. unlimited tv and computer time<br/>

<br/>
None of those is equivalent to any other. Why limit your kids to life they<br/>
can experience first hand when other resources can get them more of the<br/>
world in a different way?<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s okay if kids don&#39;t watch National Geographic Channel. It&#39;s okay if<br/>
kids enjoy Spongebob Squarepants and Simpsons and Ed, Edd and Eddie. Would<br/>
we be nervous if kids were reading the same stories in books, or watching a<br/>

What if you felt that way about museums? How would that affect your<br/>
children? Wouldn&#39;t it be a good idea to figure out how to let go of that<br/>

they were done or tired or bored. These are the hallmarks of being &quot;fed <br/>

interst my kids, I&#39;ll bring it home. If they&#39;re interested they&#39;ll watch <br/>
it; if not, they won&#39;t. Likewise if they see a video they think they&#39;ll <br/>
like at the library we&#39;ll get it. If I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll like it I&#39;ll <br/>
tell them so, but they really don&#39;t *want* inappropriate stuff--partly <br/>
because it&#39;s not forbidden fruit.<br/>

it, yes, you might want to turn it on. But not just because it&#39;s their <br/>
new &quot;curriculum&quot; and now they *have to* do this. It wouldn&#39;t make any <br/>
sense, would it?<br/>
<br/>
But it would be kind of mean to let a show on your child&#39;s most pressing <br/>
interest go by without viewing or taping when you knew it was there and <br/>
just didn&#39;t tell them about it.<br/>

Nobody makes a child watch prescribed television programs for six hours a day <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;just&quot; any one thing, and letting a child make a choice shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
described with a &quot;just.&quot;  Letting children make choices is HUGE.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are subject matter and program ratings <br/>
<br/>
controlled by the child as well? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Controlled?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think I know what you mean, but do you know what you mean?  <br/>
Subject matter comes from the makers of the programs, and those programs are <br/>
not just thrown off without a thought.  You see how many people are in the <br/>
credits.   It&#39;s not like some few home videos.  And &quot;ratings&quot; come from <br/>
committees of people who don&#39;t konw your kids at all whatsoever.   Those are just <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I just read a book a friend sent me.  It said on the cover it was for ages <br/>
8-12.   How silly.   He sent it so I could read it and we could discuss it.  <br/>
We&#39;re 50.   I&#39;m not going to offer it to my kids.  It&#39;s a total school story to <br/>
which they would not relate whatsoever.  Ratings like that are not applicable <br/>
to unschooling nor to much else in the real world.<br/>

school isn&#39;t so much the stuff it imposes on kids. It&#39;s what it takes away or <br/>
diminishes or spoils.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I spoke with someone who has just taken a 14 year old out of <br/>
school.  <br/>
The mom is a sociology professor and was not the most receptive person I&#39;ve <br/>
talked to, but we have a mutual friend who recommended she talk to me, so we <br/>
hung in there through the conversation for her sake.  She assured me there was <br/>
much about reading instruction I didn&#39;t know.  Her son&#39;s dyslexic and she&#39;s <br/>
invested in the system.  So it goes.  <br/>
<br/>
She was wanting opportunties for her son to meet other homeschoolers.  The <br/>
teens do things on Tuesdays, but she teaches that day.  She said he was a good <br/>
athlete and I mentioned Marty&#39;s ork ball games on Sundays.  She asked what they <br/>
were like, and interrupted me within the first three sentences and said &quot;He <br/>
might think it&#39;s too silly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I said &quot;Then we don&#39;t want him there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was abrupt, but honest to god, kids who are so messed up by school that <br/>
they can no longer play would be a HUGE drag on that game.  I told her there are <br/>
kids there from 9 to 19 who&#39;ve played it for over a year and it&#39;s a good <br/>
workout and they usually play two seven-point games and have a blast.<br/>
<br/>
But I was sad that she couldn&#39;t at least hear me out and THINK to herself &quot;he <br/>
might think it&#39;s too silly&quot; and then think to herself what a damned drag that <br/>
really was for him.<br/>
<br/>
School tells kids some books aren&#39;t to be read after you&#39;re twelve, or that <br/>
if a kid is two years younger than you are, you are justified in belittling or <br/>
ignoring him unless and until you&#39;re both over 21 and he outranks you in some <br/>
now-inconceivable way.<br/>
<br/>
And school, by those methods, creates false layers of &quot;maturity&quot; which people <br/>
pull on like masks, and they &quot;act their age&quot; in unnatural and non-useful ways.<br/>

Too much thinking and control on your part.   <br/>

If your house and your life have lots of interesting aspects and <br/>
opportunities and you observe your children instead of steering them, life will be bigger <br/>
and richer today, right now.  You&#39;ll learn sooner how natural learning works <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300042168"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&lt;feeling TV was a bit schoolish&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  ------------------------------------ <br/>
  Are you thinking about SpongeBob and Kim Possible, or PBS series like Liberty&#39;s Kids and Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided--all of which we love in our house and hold our attention equally. <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;I guess I don&#39;t put reading in the same category as TV since it <br/>
  leaves so much more to the imagination - relying on the reader to <br/>
  create a substantial body of original supplementary material, <br/>
  whereas TV does so much of that for you.&gt;<br/>
  ------------------------------------------<br/>
  TV does no more of that than a book. My kids spend countless hours of imaginative play recreating stories from movies and tv, embellishing, rewriting, adding. I would argue that tv and movies fuel far more imaginative play than books, and we read a lot of books, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;but I think it has a tendency speak louder than other media (flashier, available 24x7, <br/>
  easier to absorb, so many channels) and crowd out other things.&gt;<br/>
  ----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
  Books, last time I checked, were available 24/7 as well. Books are far more portable than tv, making them potentially even more pervasive. When novels first became popular, parents and experts railed against them for precisely this reason--they could be carried with you anywhere, take up time from more useful activities at any moment, and they could be hidden!<br/>
<br/>
  Just some more things to think about. Keep reading, thinking and asking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531705327">HA! You ought to see the Rosemond column in my local paper today, <br/>
headlined &quot;Mothers face hurdles with home-schooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       It&#39;s about a 6-year-old being hsed since August, after kindergarten at <br/>
school last year.<br/>
<br/>
       The mom writes that his motivation to work was &quot;never&quot; a problem at <br/>
school but he won&#39;t do his &quot;work&quot; for her at home.<br/>
<br/>
       &quot;I have beautiful and interesting hands-on Montessori materials for <br/>
him. Nonetheless, the [discipline] problems are nearly constant. Today for <br/>
example, he ended up in his room by 10am, allowed to have only books and no screen <br/>
time for the rest of the week. I punished him for complaining, for lying down <br/>
(saying he was tired), not following directions and generally goofing off. Am <br/>
I on the right page here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
      Rosemond tells her yes. Put him back in school so he can be forced and <br/>
broken. You can&#39;t police him well enough on your own yet. (And naturally <br/>
policing and controlling and limiting are what learning is all about!)<br/>
<br/>
       As an unschooler, my sad thought was that the mom was honoring the <br/>
beautiful hand-on Montessori materials and HER need to obey her own internalized <br/>
rules every minute of every day,  much more than she was willing to honor her <br/>
living, breathing, learning little boy. <br/>
<br/>
       Ironic, when you consider that Montessori materials are supposed to be <br/>
all about first-hand, child-constructed learning and discovery. How could <br/>
even a mom brainwashed by authority decide that Montessori should be forced on a <br/>
schedule as &quot;work&quot;? How could she not see the daily deprivation she doggedly <br/>
inflicts with her &quot;eat this with a smile, or starve&quot; power struggle approach to <br/>
a six-year-old? It&#39;s no different than power struggles over eating and <br/>
chores, and imo it can induce similar disorders and disabilities. <br/>
<br/>
       Meanwhile, can there be much doubt that internalized rules create <br/>
misery for both parents and kids?<br/>
<br/>
      Obviously this mom isn&#39;t coming HERE for advice. She wanted confimation <br/>
for her authoritarian approach, and got it. (Doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t miserable <br/>
though!)  The reason I bring it here is to show that even when your child is <br/>
home doesn&#39;t mean the spectre of school is lessened, unless you consciously <br/>
and conscientiously make it so. <br/>
<br/>
       And also, to show even committed unschoolers stumble over an <br/>
internalized rule now and then. Blind spots, Joyce just called them.<br/>
<br/>
       For me it was never the badness of tv, thank goodness, but I did try <br/>
hard for years to impose the &quot;goodness&quot; of arithmetic and daily piano practice. <br/>
With the predictable &quot;miserable&quot; results for all concerned.<br/>
<br/>
       In fairness, I didn&#39;t know then that what we were doing was considered <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; -- we were making it up as we went along, without outside help <br/>
-- but I see now that these were two unschooling blind spots that my <br/>
first-born had to live through.  JJ<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I&#39;ve come to believe what&#39;s wrong about <br/>
&gt; school isn&#39;t so much the stuff it imposes on kids. It&#39;s what it takes away <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; diminishes or spoils.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday I spoke with someone who has just taken a 14 year old out of <br/>
&gt; school.  <br/>
&gt; The mom is a sociology professor and was not the most receptive person I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; talked to, but we have a mutual friend who recommended she talk to me, so we <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hung in there through the conversation for her sake.  She assured me there <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; much about reading instruction I didn&#39;t know.  Her son&#39;s dyslexic and she&#39;s <br/>
&gt; invested in the system.  So it goes.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She was wanting opportunties for her son to meet other homeschoolers.  The <br/>
&gt; teens do things on Tuesdays, but she teaches that day.  She said he was a <br/>
&gt; good <br/>
&gt; athlete and I mentioned Marty&#39;s ork ball games on Sundays.  She asked what <br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; were like, and interrupted me within the first three sentences and said &quot;He <br/>
&gt; might think it&#39;s too silly.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I said &quot;Then we don&#39;t want him there.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was abrupt, but honest to god, kids who are so messed up by school that <br/>
&gt; they can no longer play would be a HUGE drag on that game.  I told her there <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; kids there from 9 to 19 who&#39;ve played it for over a year and it&#39;s a good <br/>
&gt; workout and they usually play two seven-point games and have a blast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I was sad that she couldn&#39;t at least hear me out and THINK to herself <br/>
&gt; &quot;he <br/>
&gt; might think it&#39;s too silly&quot; and then think to herself what a damned drag <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; really was for him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; School tells kids some books aren&#39;t to be read after you&#39;re twelve, or that <br/>
&gt; if a kid is two years younger than you are, you are justified in belittling <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; ignoring him unless and until you&#39;re both over 21 and he outranks you in <br/>
&gt; some <br/>
&gt; now-inconceivable way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And school, by those methods, creates false layers of &quot;maturity&quot; which <br/>
&gt; people <br/>
&gt; pull on like masks, and they &quot;act their age&quot; in unnatural and non-useful <br/>
&gt; ways.<br/>

The equal weight point: everyone has different ways of collecting <br/>

have to make it all up yourself.&quot; That&#39;s is equally ridiculous!<br/>
<br/>
My dad still worships books, but that was what he was born with! And the only <br/>
way to receive information was the written word----it was accessible to <br/>
whoever could read! Times have changed! Information comes in all SORTS of ways now! <br/>
You don&#39;t HAVE to get your info that way---and ONLY that way.<br/>
<br/>
Books do NOT give many of the opportunities that TV does. That bias towards <br/>
books is ages old: two generations ago, all we had were books---well, books and <br/>
word-of-mouth and hands-on. Then came radio---a window was opened! Look at <br/>
what happened when TV came into our lives----what tremendous doors were opened! <br/>
And then the internet: the whole WORLD was at our fingertips!<br/>
<br/>
The inventions of radio, TV, and the internet did not close the doors on <br/>
books and reading----more books are being published every day---more than ever! <br/>
They just add TO the world of books.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bibliophile. I LOVE books. Many on this list do. But we also see the <br/>
value of TV. We don&#39;t put one over the other. They ARE both equal in learning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>NO one said *anything* should be accepted uncritically!<br/>
<br/>
This is probably the *most* critically thinking group you&#39;ll ever run across. <br/>
And we&#39;re giving our children the same chances/opportunities to be just as <br/>
critical----of what they watch, read, listen to, do, eat, etc. Bad TV is bad <br/>
TV----but a bad book is a bad book TOO! There is good and bad in both media (not <br/>
to mention art/clothing/food). It should be up to our children to decide <br/>
critically what&#39;s good and bad to *them*. If they can learn that when they&#39;re <br/>
young, they won&#39;t sit and vege-out as adults! They will watch what they find <br/>
interesting ONLY. They will read what interests them; they will eat what&#39;s good for <br/>
them; they will make decisions based on &quot;critical thinking&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Our children are living proof that it works. Schooled kids don&#39;t have the <br/>
opportunity to see anything as equal or to think about what they&#39;re doing. The <br/>
thinking is done FOR them. All day. For 12 to 20 years! &quot;Critical thinking&quot; is a <br/>
school buzz-word right now, but it&#39;s kind of funny to me that the one thing <br/>
they&#39;re NOT allowing the children to do is think---much less, critically!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I got the impression <br/>
<br/>
from this board that if I didn&#39;t embrace the TV I wasn&#39;t really <br/>
<br/>
embracing an important element of unschooling, and I&#39;m a bit <br/>
<br/>
skeptical about whether I can make that leap.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To embrace&quot; seems to be used here in an emotional way.  Can&#39;t you just <br/>
accept or consider something without thinking of it as &quot;embracing&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re supplying your own emotional undertones.  Emotional undertow.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess I don&#39;t put reading in the same category as TV since it <br/>
<br/>
leaves so much more to the imagination&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it leave TOO much to the imagination, and some people aren&#39;t very <br/>
imaginative.   Take reading music, for example.  Few people (fewer than 1% of <br/>
even professional musicians, I&#39;d guess) can look at sheet music and hear what <br/>
it would sound like.   So written music isn&#39;t music.<br/>
<br/>
Shakespeare was never meant to be read.  It&#39;s meant to be play-acted, with <br/>
some people on stage and some off, here and there, some characters aware of what <br/>
has transpired, and some unaware; some fooled, and some in the know.  If you <br/>
think for a moment that reading Shakespeare will allow your children to use <br/>
their imaginations, and watching a play or a movie would not, you just haven&#39;t <br/>
thought about Shakespeare enough.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;relying on the reader to <br/>
<br/>
create a substantial body of original supplementary material, <br/>
<br/>
whereas TV does so much of that for you.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wildebeasts.  <br/>
Try imagining those from a description in a book.   Try imagining how they <br/>
would move, from one still photo.  <br/>
<br/>
A giraffe.  <br/>
Try imagining how they would run, full speed, from having seen them in a <br/>
book, or at the zoo.  Try imagining how they would eat from tall trees e that <br/>
there are many <br/>
<br/>
things TV does better than any other medium, but I have a hard time <br/>
<br/>
accepting that it should recieve equal weight to other activities, <br/>
<br/>
or be accepted entirely uncritically.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keep thinking.<br/>
Nobody&#39;s asking you to accept anything uncritically.<br/>
If you reject it uncritically or you&#39;ve borrowed others&#39; criticism without <br/>
really examining it to see if it SHOULD be your own, that is accepting something <br/>
uncritically.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess that&#39;s what hangs me up here - I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s so much <br/>
<br/>
what&#39;s wrong with TV, or a particular program, but I think it has a <br/>
<br/>
tendency speak louder than other media (flashier, available 24x7, <br/>
<br/>
easier to absorb, so many channels) and crowd out other things.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you were in a public place and there were four things going on and one was <br/>
really attractive, colorful, different, and people were laughing and enjoying <br/>
it, wouldn&#39;t you go there too?  Would that be a sin?  Would the other things <br/>
be better served or more valuable if the most interesting thing were shut down <br/>
and sent away?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess I am just someone who sees real value in a little boredom. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s another prejudice some people pick up without critical <br/>
thinking.  It&#39;s a thing which is parroted by many mean parents.  &quot;Boredom is good for <br/>
you.&quot;  It means &quot;Get away from me,&quot; in worst cases.   Some parents say &quot;If <br/>
you&#39;re bored mop the floor.&quot;  I wonder if any of them think they&#39;re the first to <br/>
say it, or that it&#39;s kind or helpful?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote years ago after learning something new and profound <br/>
from another homeschooling mom on a bulletin board for unschoolers:  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore">http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore</a><br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I <br/>
<br/>
know when my son has a few minutes of it, that&#39;s when his best ideas <br/>
<br/>
seem to hit, and I worry that the TV will interfere with that... I <br/>
<br/>
know it does for me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re thinking about time to think, and not about boredom.<br/>

<br/>
Forgot to comment on the choice of the word and idea &quot;easier to absorb.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our culture in general has considered hard work to be virtue, difficulty to <br/>
produce character, and easiness to be a sin.<br/>
<br/>
We have &quot;if it tastes bad it must be good for you&quot; which probably started out <br/>
as a joke but turned into a deeply held belief.    How many of us have heard, <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not SUPPOSED to be fun&quot; about learning or working or taking a bath?<br/>
<br/>
So if life is not &quot;supposed to be fun,&quot; or easy, then what unschoolers do <br/>
must be bad and sinful.<br/>
<br/>
We have layers of cultural prejudice to take off before we can see directly <br/>
and clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Will a child be less clean if he had fun in the bath or shower?<br/>
Will medicine work better, REALLY, if it tastes nasty?<br/>
Is a job really better at the end if the person did it reluctantly instead of <br/>
with joy?<br/>
<br/>
Is TV worse because information can be gathered more easily?<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is for the child to have many connections inside, the easier the <br/>
better!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I admit, I am constantly amazed at all the different kinds of knowledge <br/>
that Sandra has on so many different topics and how she explains so much stuff <br/>
on levels I&#39;ve never even dreamed of.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Really, it&#39;s this:  I&#39;ve had fun my whole life, putting new ideas together <br/>
with old ones.  Building a model of the universe that connects the dots from <br/>
music to history to science to art to things I own to things I&#39;ve seen to things <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  And speaking of music, I didn&#39;t finish something about books and <br/>
imagination.  Music isn&#39;t meant to live on paper.  Paper is a vehicle for getting it <br/>
back into the air again.<br/>
<br/>
Books aren&#39;t always meant to live on paper.  Some books are poetry, or plays, <br/>
or music, or games, or recipes.  They&#39;re vehicles for getting words back into <br/>
the air, to get people to move or act certain ways, to put real food into new <br/>
bowls.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not for reading and IMAGINING music, or food, or playing games with <br/>
other people.<br/>
<br/>
A friend who has a master&#39;s in early childhood ed has made her young son <br/>
(he&#39;s 7 now) sit behind the couch while his dad is watching movies or TV so that <br/>
he&#39;s not just watching tv, but he&#39;s using his imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the information conveyed in a movie has to do with body language, <br/>
subtle facial glance, costume, action.  But she thinks (WRONGLY) that he can just <br/>
imagine it from hearing dialog and music.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s embarrassing.<br/>

cliffs&quot; and was looking at pictures while she was telling me more.  Tadaaa!!! <br/>
Instantaneous trans-atlantic communication with images without getting out of <br/>
my chair in Albuquerque.<br/>
