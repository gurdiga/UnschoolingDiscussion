<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088594086">Thanks for the encouragement.  This is what I hope will happen too.  I&#39;ve only attended 2 meetings so far and my kids really enjoy going.<br/>

   <br/>
  &gt; I recently <br/>
  &gt; started attending monthly playgroups with a local homeschooling<br/>
  &gt; group but find that the adult conversations usually revolve around<br/>
  &gt; curriculums so I have nothing to offer.  At the first meeting I<br/>
  &gt; mentioned that we were unschoolers and got a few polite nods and<br/>
  &gt; more than a few raised eyebrows.  Later a woman whispered to me that<br/>
  &gt; she was interested in learning more about unschooling.  It was<br/>
  &gt; obvious that she didn&#39;t want anyone to hear us!<br/>
<br/>
  Stick with it. Your description sounds a lot like my group when I first<br/>
  started going. There are more unschoolers now than when I started, but more<br/>
  importantly, some people in the group have become very close friends for me<br/>
  and my kids. After a while, the kind of schooling people do doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
  as much as the level of respect they have for each other.<br/>
