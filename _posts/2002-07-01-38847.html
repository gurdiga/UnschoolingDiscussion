<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079292662"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am wondering... Why isn&#39;t the UU church Christian? Because they accept<br/>
&gt; every one? Isn&#39;t that a basic tenant of Christianity?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The UU church is not considered Christian by other Christians.  I don&#39;t<br/>
believe that they think they are, either.  Christians believe in the Trinity<br/>
(Father, Son, Holy Spirit) and that Jesus Christ is the path to God.  The<br/>
Unitarians believe in 1 God (unity, unitarian), but many routes to that God,<br/>
and each of us must find our own.  By the way, the Unitarians go back to our<br/>
founding fathers (and then some), but merged with the Universalists only in<br/>
the last 50 years, I believe, if even that much.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this, why aren&#39;t the Catholic, Mormon and other churches considered<br/>
&gt; Christian, by other Christian denominations? They consider themselves<br/>
&gt; Christian. I just don&#39;t get this whole *I&#39;m a Christian, but they aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; because they are ____! I don&#39;t care if they call themselves Christian, their<br/>
&gt; not!* attitude. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Catholics, back in Vatican II, made many changes to their practice of faith,<br/>
and accepting salvation outside the Catholic church is one of them.<br/>
However, getting those changes to be part of the belief system of the<br/>
members takes time.  Lots of time.  (Last rites is another, for example.  It<br/>
went out with Vatican II, in the 1960&#39;s.  You&#39;d never know it, people still<br/>
ask for it.)<br/>
<br/>
Many protestants, particularly the &quot;mainline protestans&quot; like Lutherans,<br/>
Methodists, Presbyterians, etc. have no problem with Catholics.  Some other,<br/>
more conservative denominations do.  The emphasis of the Catholic faith is<br/>
on the sacraments (baptism, communion, etc.), and less on your personal<br/>
relationship with Jesus Christ.  To some people, the sacraments are the<br/>
route to a relationship with God, to others they are so much ritual hooey,<br/>
and Catholics are missing the boat by not having that relationship with<br/>
Christ.  Hence, they aren&#39;t Christian enough for certain folks.<br/>
<br/>
Mormons consider themselves Christian, and technically, they are, since<br/>
Christians are the followers of Christ.  However, the Book of Mormon, and<br/>
the 3 other Mormon books that form the basis of their faith tell stories of<br/>
a different nature of Jesus Christ, which do not come under the commonly<br/>
accepted canon of Christian literature, the Bible.  Because their belief<br/>
system is SO different than most other Christian denominations, for the most<br/>
part, they are not accepted as Christian by other Christians.<br/>
<br/>
The Jews have every bit as many problems with fundamentalism and who&#39;s<br/>
Jewish and who&#39;s not as the rest of us.  Those of us with Christian<br/>
backgrounds just aren&#39;t as familiar with them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In fact the Catholics and Episcopalians are getting really chummy!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Episcopal church is the American branch of the Anglican church (Church<br/>
of England), which split from the Catholics after after the Reformation &<br/>
Counter-Reformation, which is where most Protestant churches began.  As a<br/>
result, they have always had very close ties to the Catholics.  To an<br/>
extent, the Episcopal church stands between Catholic and Protestant; a bit<br/>
of each and not totally either.  In the last few years, however, the<br/>
Episcopal church signed a major agreement with the Evangelical Lutheran<br/>
Church (the largest American Lutheran denomination) which basically says<br/>
they can share everything from pastors onwards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So the fundamentalists are really just trying to protect people&#39;s<br/>
&gt;souls by pointing out who is and isn&#39;t Christian. Sort of the Consumer<br/>
&gt;Reports of the True Christian faith ;-) (I&#39;m teasing partly but not totally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know you&#39;re teasing, Joyce, but it&#39;s amazing how accurate that really is.<br/>
Some Christians can be very exclusive about who is and who isn&#39;t saved,<br/>
based on whether they go to the &quot;right&quot; Church and whether their faith is<br/>
true enough.  That frightens me some, that Christians can be so unloving,<br/>
but also that we have so much trouble respecting differences and seeing how<br/>
our beliefs are similar.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m married to a guy that&#39;s TOTALLY into this stuff, and I&#39;ve learned it by<br/>
default.  ;)  I hope that if you&#39;re still reading that it was somehow<br/>
useful.  If not, you should have deleted me long ago!!  :)<br/>
