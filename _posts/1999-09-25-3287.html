<div id="ygrps-yiv-159370364">I also enjoyed David Guterson&#39;s book Family Matters as an intro to<br/>
homeschooling.  He covers all the usual objections and shares how his<br/>
father (an attorney) didn&#39;t like homeschooling but strongly believed in<br/>
parents&#39; right to do so.<br/>
The Teenage Liberation Handbook is great too.  Full of examples and<br/>
resources of how to learn any &quot;subject&quot; in a real-life situation.  Also<br/>
liked The Unschooling Handbook, hmm, now that I think of it I haven&#39;t<br/>
seen that one in a while.  Who did I loan it to?.....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; From the annotation in the HOlt catelogue<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it sounded like the kind of gently persuasive book she would enjoy<br/>
reading<br/>
and find herself agreeing with in spite of herself. I&#39;m just so tired of<br/>
arguing with someone who is uninformed. I was surprised she agreed to<br/>
read<br/>
something about homeschooling b/c she is so absolutely certain that we<br/>
are<br/>
ruining our children&#39;s lives and that schools are the one and only way.<br/>
So, Iguess I&#39;m putting a lot of stock in your book as the first book<br/>
she&#39;s<br/>
ever read on the subject! If she&#39;s willing after reading your book, I&#39;ll<br/>
send her some of Holt&#39;s.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
