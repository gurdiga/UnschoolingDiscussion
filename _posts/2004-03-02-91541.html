<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883830170">We recently moved from a home in the country in Tennessee to our <br/>
hometown in Texas. For the first time my children are in a <br/>
subdivision and it has been more of an adjustment for me than for <br/>
them. Being used to riding bikes on country roads they didn&#39;t pay <br/>
much attention to whatever vehicle may be coming their way.<br/>
<br/>
Nathan just turned 9. He ran to the front door clutching his stomach <br/>
calling for me. The door was locked and big brother told him to go to <br/>
the back door but Nathan decided he wasn&#39;t hurt so bad and hastened <br/>
to mount his bike once more.<br/>
<br/>
At lunch he told me that he had 3 bike wrecks and the bragged that <br/>
during the last one in an attempt to avoid a crash with his brother <br/>
Jonathan he crashed into <br/>
the house. He was very proud of his bruises. I asked him why he kept <br/>
crashing and he responded that he was riding Matthew&#39;s &#39;big&#39; bike and <br/>
that the brakes are out. We talked about possibly riding a different <br/>
bike.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the afternoon I heard a truck come to a loud and sudden <br/>
stop. I thought that a dog had been hit. I rushed to the door to hear <br/>
a man saying he&#39;s okay----he&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
I thought he was talking about the dog. I realized that the man was a <br/>
freind that I had grown up with and who introduced me to my husband. <br/>
We had not seen each other for about 24 years. So, it was quite a <br/>
reunion and he met 5 of our 8 kids. <br/>
<br/>
He told me that he nearly hit my son while I thought he was trying to <br/>
miss the dog!!  He also told me that the same thing happened to him <br/>
when he was a boy but he actually colided with the car and his father <br/>
beat the fire out of him so that he would never make such a &#39;stupid <br/>
mistake&#39; again. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, after he left Nathan told me that when he was coming down the <br/>
slant of the driveway he saw the truck. Knowing the brakes didn&#39;t <br/>
work well he couldn&#39;t stop so he started turning his bike and he <br/>
heard the man hit his brakes. <br/>
<br/>
I was pretty rattled by this and wanted all the kids to stay off <br/>
their bikes for a while. We talked about how everyone <br/>
felt about it and then they traveled by foot to the fort on the <br/>
corner which they are building but before long the bikes were on the <br/>
road again. I am still nervous about this but the kids aren&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152524625">I&#39;m sorry, but if the brakes weren&#39;t working properly what in the WORLD was he doing out on the bike?! I&#39;d be having a very long talk with him...although I can imagine the situation is probably quite a lesson in safety in the first place! YIKES! Glad to know that he is ok though!!!!<br/>

<br/>
And consider:  taking the bike to a shop and paying to get the brakes fixed <br/>
is probably cheaper than even the co-pay on a trip to the emergency room.   <br/>
Just do it, even if you&#39;re poor.  It&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Dad&#39;s SAY they will fix brakes, but they don&#39;t always do it in timely fashion.<br/>
<br/>
I used to just ask my husband to do things, but sometimes I say &quot;I was <br/>
wondering if you want to fix this this afternoon or whether I should just take it to <br/>
the shop tomorrow.&quot;   It&#39;s more &quot;inspiring&quot; than if I just say &quot;Could you fix <br/>
this if you get around to it?&quot;   To a kid, a day without a bike can seem like <br/>
a week, and a week...  they can forget how to ride a bike in a week!!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

As I said, he told me at lunch that the brakes were not working <br/>
properly and that was the first I had heard of it. And he was <br/>
suppossed to be on his own bike for the rest of the day because the <br/>
brakes on his bike are fine. The point was that he was aware of the <br/>
situation and handled it in a way which kept him safe because he <br/>
didn&#39;t panic. And yes----the bike with the bad brakes has been put <br/>
away until it can be fixed.<br/>

<br/>
It might be different with unschooled kids who very rarely get &quot;long talks&quot; <br/>
and are accustomed to REAL talking.<br/>
<br/>
We met a new-to-homeschooling family (mom and son dyad) last weekend.  Very <br/>
sad.  He&#39;s adopted, she&#39;s not apparently big on interpersonal skills, he&#39;s 14, <br/>
and they seem to have NO emotional or personal connection whatsoever.  Marty <br/>
(15) was talking to me about it and said &quot;It would be really sad not to have a <br/>
relationship.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like another planet, with teenaged school-kids as opposed to longterm <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
Marty has a best friend who has been in and out, in and out of <br/>
school/homeschool, and he&#39;s now in high school on ritalin.  His mom is a source of <br/>
frustration and cash, not a trusted friend of his.<br/>

<br/>
I remember as a kid the boys having bikes without brakes.    That challenge was a big part of the fun.  They knew what the conditions were and enjoyed learning how to navigate in those conditions.  Sounds like your son has real sense of his environment.<br/>
