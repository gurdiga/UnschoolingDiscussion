search Amazon for &quot;Fleischman&quot; and &quot;history&quot; in the juvenille section and see <br/>
what comes up?<br/>

(Although the book was published recently and may not be available in <br/>
paperback yet.)<br/>

&lt;&lt;Exactly!  Except it wasn&#39;t that big of a step for me (actually there was NO<br/>
<br/>
BIG STEP) as I have been defying my parental control my entire life.  It<br/>
<br/>
made for a really rocky childhood, but it certainly made it easier to be an<br/>
<br/>
adult with control of my own life later.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Hey, Nanci.  No wonder it seems like you have your head screwed on so <br/>
straight.<br/>
<br/>
(I mean, your many philosophical posts seem to reflect a lot of wisdom.  <br/>
Starting to think for yourself at an early age seems to have paid off.)<br/>
