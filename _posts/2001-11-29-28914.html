When oldest dd was 5, I had her in kindergarten here. Things weren&#39;t going<br/>
well and I was pushed to my limits with that system. I knew *nothing* about<br/>
homeschooling; I was of the belief that I&#39;d be breaking the law if I didn&#39;t<br/>
send her to school. Well, the day came that I could take no more and I<br/>
removed my child from that system without a &#39;plan&#39; of a next step. I had<br/>
visions of being put in jail for what I was doing but heck, I just had that<br/>
gut feeling that it was the thing I should be doing regardless the<br/>
consequences.<br/>
This behavior rarely happens in me, though. I tend to like to have read<br/>
about others trying things out first before I stick my neck out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t read Holt until a year or two ago. It was great that he agreed<br/>
with me on so many points. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get the feeling that anyone was looking to authors to tell them<br/>
anything was &quot;okay&quot;. Sometimes, though, an author will write a book that<br/>
explains with detail and discussion pretty much what I&#39;ve been stumbling<br/>
along trying to say, and it seems that it would be eaiser to suggest that<br/>
someone read X book than to spend hours trying to share the same basic<br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I went on a date with a guy a few weeks ago who was telling me how great<br/>
he though John Rosemond was. I did suggest that he read John Holt, or<br/>
A.S. Neill, since clearly he was at least ten dinnertime conversations<br/>
away from even beginning to get it, and I wasn&#39;t really interested in any<br/>
more dinners, at that point.<br/>
<br/>
He had no kids of his own. Thankfully.<br/>

You are on an unschooling list here.  If you keep insisting unschooling<br/>
doesn&#39;t work, of course the people who know it does are going to debate<br/>

<br/>
I will be more than happy to answer this.<br/>
I have read many books on unschooling, Holt, Griffeth, articles by Jeanne<br/>
Mustfeldt, Helen and Mark,  the teenage Liberation Handbook, GWS, Blah Blah<br/>
Blah. I read these because I wanted something different than what I knew.<br/>
ALl I knew about was mass school learning. This doesn&#39;t mean I am *relying<br/>
on someone else to tell me what I think is right* I have been looking for<br/>
information that supports my ideas and found it. I have also read The Well<br/>
Trained Mind, What your Child Needs TO know by X grade, and otehr books that<br/>
are more geared towards classical education. I found that it wasn&#39;t for us.<br/>
I think that type of learning environment can be damaging and not just<br/>
because John Holt said so. For me and I think for many of us here on<br/>
unschooling boards and email lists (and this is just supposition because I<br/>
don&#39;t have all these people emailing me off list to talk about the list),<br/>
unschooling is just a term used to<br/>
define a shift in lifestyle to a more equal relationship with my children.<br/>
This includes child led learning.<br/>
For our family trhis may at some point include textbooks - IF my child<br/>
decided to learn algebra and chose to use my old college textbooks or get<br/>
some from the PS sales, or whatever. Unschooling isn&#39;t necessarily about<br/>
using or not using specific materials. It is about respecting a child&#39;s<br/>
autonomy.<br/>
and not following arbitrarily defined developmental guidestones.<br/>
The idea of unschooling was first brought up in society by John Holt, many<br/>
others then embraced his ideals and carried them further. We are not relying<br/>
on one person to tell us how to think. It is very helpful when people are<br/>
taking a different path in life to stick together and write talk and read<br/>
about that path.<br/>

concepts, they are pounced on in a big way.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t see this happening at all. I see alot of healthy open debate.<br/>

for a few days there I was hearing nothing but catch phrases and book<br/>
recommendations.  No personal accounts, no reasons for beliefs.  It&#39;s<br/>
seemed much better here since I asked the question though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981243140">Elissa wrote and it&#39;s worth repeating:<br/>
For me and I think for many of us here on<br/>
unschooling boards and email lists (and this is just supposition because I<br/>
don&#39;t have all these people emailing me off list to talk about the list),<br/>
unschooling is just a term used to<br/>
define a shift in lifestyle to a more equal relationship with my children.<br/>
This includes child led learning.<br/>
For our family trhis may at some point include textbooks - IF my child<br/>
decided to learn algebra and chose to use my old college textbooks or get<br/>
some from the PS sales, or whatever. Unschooling isn&#39;t necessarily about<br/>
using or not using specific materials. It is about respecting a child&#39;s<br/>
autonomy.<br/>
and not following arbitrarily defined developmental guidestones.<br/>
The idea of unschooling was first brought up in society by John Holt, many<br/>
others then embraced his ideals and carried them further. We are not relying<br/>
on one person to tell us how to think. It is very helpful when people are<br/>
taking a different path in life to stick together and write talk and read<br/>
about that path.<br/>
