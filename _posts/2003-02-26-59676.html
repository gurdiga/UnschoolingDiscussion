<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292429232">**I have times when I don&#39;t wanna read.  I&#39;m just not in the mood.  Yea, in<br/>
school, maybe it would have been more fun than a lot of the things we did.<br/>
But if you&#39;re not in the mood to read, is sitting quietly, staring at a book<br/>
to make a teacher happy, while feeling surly inside REALLY going to help a<br/>
child&#39;s love of reading?**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t love &quot;sustained silent reading&quot; either.  But I loathed some of<br/>
the things we read in Lit class.  (Yes, Joseph Conrad, I&#39;m talking to<br/>
you!)  So, seeing educators believe that kids should get to pick what<br/>
they read is a tiny step in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously we can do better &quot;sustained silent reading&quot; in our homes, as<br/>
well as &quot;sustained loud reading&quot; and &quot;interrupted loud reading&quot; and all<br/>
the other kinds of reading. &lt;g&gt;  And when we&#39;re not reading, we&#39;re still<br/>
learning and having a good time.  I think unschooling is better, cooler<br/>
AND more fun than any school program.<br/>
<br/>
However, I was also happy to read a couple of &quot;official&quot; books about<br/>
reading programs that said, essentially, if you WANT kids to read<br/>
enthusiastically, for god&#39;s sake DON&#39;T make them do book reports.  This<br/>
strikes me as a valuable insight.  It&#39;s funny to see how much the school<br/>
establishment fights against it and wants to keep it&#39;s hallowed book<br/>
reports, though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really pretty off topic here, so I think I should stop.<br/>
