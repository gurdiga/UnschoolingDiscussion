<div id="ygrps-yiv-605799880">We don&#39;t enforce a bedtime, but we do expect the kids to be upstairs by 9:00 <br/>
or so.  We usually start the bedtime routine about 8:30 to give everyone a <br/>
chance to brush teeth and choose stories, then we read the stories and send <br/>
the kids off to their rooms.  They&#39;re free to go to sleep or play or read or <br/>
whatever.  But we also let them know if we&#39;ll be coming to get them up early <br/>
in the morning for an activity or a field trip.  Otherwise, they can sleep in <br/>
as long as they want.  <br/>
<br/>
That way Gary and I have time for ourselves without the kids feeling that <br/>
they have to be in bed in a dark room.  They usually don&#39;t last long before <br/>
they in their beds.  Zack (who&#39;s 8) especially has learned that if he stays <br/>
up too late it&#39;s hard to wake up in the morning when you have to.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243417467">This is such a tough subject sometimes.  We have a 14 yo and he&#39;s gone through <br/>
so many bedtime stages over the past year.  Right now his favorite time is <br/>
night time.  He&#39;s usually up all night long, reading, playing on the computer, <br/>
reading some more, chatting on-line and usually hits the pillow around 3-5AM.  <br/>
Then all of a sudden he&#39;ll decide that he wants to be awake during the day so <br/>
we can do some activities together and he&#39;ll stay up all day until he totally <br/>
crashes and switch his schedule to a &quot;normal&quot; schedule for a week or so.  Then <br/>
before you know it, something&#39;s happens that keeps him up all night and we&#39;re <br/>
off again.<br/>
<br/>
To say that we have to sleep at night is so restricting.  There are so many <br/>
things that can happen during the night hours that we don&#39;t worry about when <br/>
he&#39;s up or down.  Not too long ago there was the meteor shower that the best <br/>
time to observe it was after midnight so away we went - up to the mountains to <br/>
watch this great event.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it gets annoying... when he gets involved in a computer game at 2 in <br/>
the morning and all you can hear (when I want to sleep) is the sound of boom-<br/>
boom... and Sean giggling!!!  But I guess those are the nights I&#39;m not sleeping <br/>
that heavily anyway... oh well, this too shall pass.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366478750">When Zachary has been going to school we put him to bed at 7:30pm, but last <br/>
night he laid in bed with us and talked till 9:30pm when he fell asleep and <br/>
Steve took him back to his own bed.  I really enjoyed this time we spent <br/>
together.  Today he&#39;s been saying how much he wants to be with me and not <br/>
somewhere else.  He also likes staying up late and talking to us after Max <br/>
has gone to bed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862437581">Dawn- LOL, I wondered the same thing. I have a 7 year old who has the <br/>
tendancy to be a nightowl. Now, I don&#39;t mind at all if he stays up with me, <br/>
but once I reach the point that I have to go to sleep, I&#39;m sorry, but he&#39;s <br/>
gotta go down too. I just don&#39;t feel comfortable leaving my 7 year old child <br/>
awake to do as he pleases. What ended up happening is he would wait until I <br/>
was sound asleep and then come out to the livingroom and turn on the computer <br/>
or television. I dislike keeping my children from things that they are <br/>
interested, but I draw the line at a certain point, and him watching <br/>
seductive commercials on television while I&#39;m sleeping is definately past <br/>
that point. We put a code on our television for the nighttime hours so that <br/>
it can only be accessed if we know about it and the computer is off limits <br/>
only because my son tends to explore the operating system which with <br/>
supervision I don&#39;t mind, but he&#39;s been known to crash the entire system if <br/>
not watched LOL. I keep a stack of books in the toyroom and sometimes we&#39;ll <br/>
wake up in the morning to find him crashed on the toyroom couch with a book <br/>
and a lego spaceship. I don&#39;t make a big deal about this however. It&#39;s hard <br/>
to define that bedtime line sometimes LOL.<br/>

he was a walking, talking baby (he would wake up at 2:00, WIDE awake, and I <br/>
would put him in a high chair with snacks and a long cartoon show, where he <br/>
would watch for a while, and then fall asleep on the tray.  That wasn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.  That was dealing with a kid whose wakefulness didn&#39;t follow the <br/>
clock.  The high chair was to keep him from being &quot;loose&quot; in the house, <br/>
because sometimes I myself could NOT wake up enough to deal with him, and if <br/>
we&#39;d been talking it would have woken my husband up.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm. I&#39;ve been leaving my 8 yr old kid awake do do as she pleases for<br/>
years now. OTOH, I pretty much trust her to do stuff that is safe for her<br/>
to do by herself... I am pretty dead sure that she won&#39;t go for a walk<br/>
around the block by herself, or set up our chemistry set and start mixing<br/>
stuff at random, because we&#39;ve talked about these things and agreed. I&#39;m<br/>
not concerned with her watching seductive tv commercials - ymmv, but I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine her going out and looking for them, and if she happens to<br/>
see one it would just be more fodder for conversation. Usually she reads<br/>
or plays or draws, I think she likes having the whole house quiet and to<br/>
herself so that she can really take over a whole room for a set-up (we&#39;ve<br/>
only had a 1 bedroom place for years).  That said, lately she has been<br/>
going sleep around the same time I do, between 11 and midnight, I think<br/>
because she enjoys talking with me in bed.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie didn&#39;t sleep through the night until 3 1/2, but by then I wasn&#39;t<br/>
waking up with her, I just left things out for her and she played a bit<br/>
and had a drink and then came back to sleep. I would close the bedroom<br/>
door and wake up if she went to open it, but s long as she stayed in the<br/>
bedroom I could kind of doze...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983438417">Heee....  Heee....<br/>
Okay...what does this say about us?<br/>
That we are totally relaxed?????<br/>
Our kids go to bed whenever.  Oldest is 8, then 6 and 5.<br/>
Sometimes they are up past me or their Dad.<br/>
Our daughter, the youngest, can sometimes stay up way late, and then sleep until<br/>
11 am.  That is just her natural rhythm.<br/>
We definitely like to sleep late.  Me and my daughter the most.<br/>
The boys are usually up before me.  They will play, do computer games, listen to<br/>
tapes, go visit Grandma (up the driveway), go to the barn, or make breakfast long<br/>
before I am up.<br/>
When we were putting an addition on our house, all five of us shared a bedroom.<br/>
We had wonderful talks while all lying in bed, and i never slept so good!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343824983">Hi Pat,<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t ask me but I have trouble keeping my nose out of things :)<br/>
<br/>
You appear in your post to be making it very clear to your kids that you<br/>
want them to go to bed early.  It seems that no bedtimes is new at your<br/>
house as well.  It seems quite likely to me that they are &quot;gorging&quot; on<br/>
staying up late and that it is a very normal part of the process.  When a<br/>
restriction is lifted we often over-indulge.<br/>
<br/>
My 11yo goes to bed around 9:30 of her own choosing.  She used to have a<br/>
bedtime of 9:30.  Again, when I came to my senses about the issue, she<br/>
started staying up quite late.  She didn&#39;t go to bed until dh and I did.<br/>
This lasted for about a month.  She was tired in the morning and I pointed<br/>
out the possible connection.  Then she went for several months of sometimes<br/>
staying up and sometimes going to bed.  Now it is quite unusual for her to<br/>
stay up past 10.<br/>
<br/>
I think with the unschooling frame of reference most of the same connections<br/>
are made (if you stay up late you are going to feel bad tomorrow and so kid<br/>
learns to moderate on sleeping) but are made at a slower rate than if the<br/>
parent simply steps in to moderate for them.  Parents can make a rule of<br/>
bedtimes and have kids in bed at 9:30 starting tonight.  Kids can monitor<br/>
their own sleeping and over the course of months come to the same behavior<br/>
(or not, some kids don&#39;t need as much sleep). But first, the kids have to<br/>
revel in their new found freedom a bit, explore it, test their personal<br/>
limits.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658113220">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input.  I think one of the areas that we are running into trouble here is with my dh.  In the past, the kids and I were always in bed by 10 and my dh had a quiet house to himself.  He would go to bed between 11:30 and midnight.  Now we are all up until midnight and he is grouchy about the noise.  So even though we have told them they can set their own bedtime we are now battling about noise.  He is being a little inflexible because one night he stormed out of bed because he heard them talking.  They said something like &quot;where do you want to sleep tonight?&quot; I would prefer to just ignore the issue and let it settle down on its own.  Dh feel his rights are being compromised.  I&#39;m always the one in the middle trying to do what is right for everyone.  Tough job!<br/>

His rights are being compromised? Are you serious? What about the <br/>
right to spend quality time with your kids? Are his kids a nuisance <br/>
to him? Always asking questions and laughing? <br/>
I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t understand why he wouldn&#39;t be tickled pink that he <br/>
now has an extra 1 1/2 hrs to spend learning how his kids think, <br/>
interact with others, or even just spend their free time.<br/>
Now dh has to be in bed by 8pm. He often pushes it to 9pm because <br/>
he&#39;s afraid he&#39;ll miss something. He&#39;s rather irritated when we have <br/>
evening or weekend activities. Not that he was always like this. <br/>
There was a time where he really wanted the kids to &#39;go away and <br/>
leave him alone&#39; Engaging little creatures they are they eventually <br/>
won him over with smiles.<br/>

risers. Some of the field trips. But it&#39;s not too bad usually for us. I only <br/>
go to the things that start at 10:00 or later and are close to our house. <br/>
Unless something sounds really good like Monkey or Parrot Jungle. Those kind <br/>
of things that are far away have us leaving at 9:00 a.m. Pretty darn early <br/>
for all of us except my husband.<br/>
<br/>
All our park days start at 11:00-11:30 and that&#39;s perfect for us. We do have <br/>
3 planned filed trips in the next few weeks that start at 10:00 but since <br/>
Joseph and Sierra never eat as soon as they get up, by the time they&#39;re <br/>
hungry, we&#39;ll be back home again!! The baby won&#39;t even know we&#39;re gone!! So <br/>
I guess we&#39;re pretty lucky after all. If it was up to my husband, he&#39;d have <br/>
us all meet at 8:00 a.m. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t allow HIM to plan any field <br/>
trips!!!<br/>

This past week, Draven (2.5 y/o) hasn&#39;t been getting down for a nap until 6<br/>

But, we sleep till at least noon every day...most of the time later.<br/>

<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
I have a few ideas.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t &quot;choose their own bedtime.&quot;<br/>
They go to sleep when they&#39;re sleepy.  That&#39;s a different thing.  It helps, <br/>
I&#39;m sure, that they&#39;ve never had &quot;a bedtime,&quot; but if kids think they have a <br/>
bedtie but they get to pick when it is, they still &quot;have a bedtime.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It might seem a subtle difference, maybe, to people who are new to the idea, <br/>
but I think it&#39;s big.<br/>
<br/>
If bedtime used to be 9:00, but a child is tired at 7:30, and if the <br/>
principle is &quot;go to bed when you&#39;re sleepy,&quot; he&#39;ll go to bed at 7:30 if he&#39;s sleepy.  <br/>
Or at midnight.   But it will be about sleepiness, not bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s been just a short while and their used to be strict rules, they will <br/>
still be frolicking in the freedom.  Just as it takes a while to deschool and <br/>
for kids to find joy in what used to be &quot;school subjects&quot; (they might never, <br/>
ever find joy in school-appearing schoolwork), any change from rules to <br/>
principles will take a while for pendulum-swing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They are staying up later and later every day but not waking up much later.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you require them to get up at a certain time before?  It&#39;s hard to break <br/>
a habit like that, especially if you used to get in trouble if you got up <br/>
later.  It might be a long time before they can break that conditioning.<br/>

<br/>
How old are your kids?  How many are there?<br/>
<br/>
It makes a huge difference if you are going from bedtimes to &quot;no set<br/>
bedtimes&quot;.  Younger-ish kids can get more and more wound up as they &quot;binge&quot;<br/>
on staying up.  You might try gradually moving in to it.<br/>
<br/>
If they normally go to bed at 8, don&#39;t say anything until 8:30 or 9:00.<br/>
Then GRADUALLY, just let it fade away.  Still have your evening rituals,<br/>
perhaps a bath, reading a book, cuddling on your bed for a movie, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

I just wanted to add to this idea, that when Jayn is asleep in the morning,<br/>
just as if dh is sleeping, I go out of my way to stay a little quieter -<br/>
unless there is something we are scheduled for at a particular time (rare).<br/>
We also have almost black out curtains in the bedroom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16163589">We have a very small house (950 square feet) and 6 people who live in <br/>
it with very different sleep patterns so our bedtime &quot;ritual&quot; has <br/>
kind of evolved in a way that takes in the considerations of everyone.<br/>
 At some point, we all end up in the living room and spend time <br/>
talking.  We usually start out discussing what happened today and <br/>
what&#39;s going on tomorrow.  Then we spend time just talking and joking <br/>
around.  Sometimes the discussion are very deep and important.<br/>
<br/>
When all is said and done, it&#39;s bedtime meaning that if you&#39;re tired <br/>
you can go to sleep (not that you can&#39;t before but everyone looks <br/>
forward to this time so much that when someone is ready to go to <br/>
sleep, we all start to gather) and if you&#39;re not, you can do what you <br/>
want that won&#39;t disturb the sleepers.  We&#39;re flexible with our <br/>
sleeping places to so if you want to do something that might distrub <br/>
someone, that other person can head to a room where it&#39;s going to be <br/>
quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Because we&#39;re a theatre family, the times we meet can change <br/>
drastically depending on whether we&#39;re doing a show or not.  When we <br/>
have our big show in April, we eat dinner around 11 pm, talk and then <br/>
get to bed around 1 am.  When my son was doing his movie and had to <br/>
be on the set at 5 am, we were usually done discussing things at 8 <br/>
pm.  Right now, we meet between 9 and 10.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928490815">Thank you for your suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, Julie to answer your questions, their ages are nearly 8 and<br/>
nearly 12.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little to late for me to do it gradually. I tried to do that for the<br/>
first few days, but they realized quickly what I was doing. I agree with you<br/>
that they may be binging and it may abate in time, how long would you guess<br/>
I should expect it to take?<br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra&#39;s point about a bedtime having particular connotations is a<br/>
good point, however, I get the impression that there are certain things that<br/>
my kids push to the backs of their minds. (I think it&#39;s an ADHD thing, but<br/>
I&#39;m not sure.) All their lives there are several things that they appear not<br/>
to notice, one is they don&#39;t recognize their own fatigue and they don&#39;t<br/>
recognize when they have to go to the bathroom until it&#39;s dire. I remember<br/>
being amazed at other kids their age who would tell their parent&#39;s they were<br/>
sleepy or would stop playing and curl up in a parent&#39;s lap and sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when they were younger and I would see them wiping their eyes. I<br/>
would point out to them that it was a signal that their body was trying to<br/>
send them that they were sleepy. Not only would they argue that it wasn&#39;t<br/>
true, but they learned not to let me see them wiping their eyes. (Not<br/>
because I was forcing them to go to bed then, but I think they didn&#39;t WANT<br/>
to know when they were tired.)<br/>
<br/>
As far as when they wake up -- I *think* we&#39;ve been doing this long enough<br/>
that it&#39;s not because of when they are accustomed to waking up. Robyn, we do<br/>
work hard to be quiet and to keep the lights down. (Kitty cat is annoying me<br/>
by walking around the house mewing loudly enough to wake the dead, though.)<br/>
I actually think my biggest enemy is biology. When their bladder is full<br/>
they go to the bathroom, realize it&#39;s light out and they don&#39;t go back to<br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I have another question though -- what if you actually need to get up early<br/>
the next day. Next week my cohousing community is going to a reservation and<br/>
we&#39;re turning it into a birthday party for my daughter. We&#39;re going in just<br/>
a few cars so I don&#39;t want to miss-the-boat per se. Do I still let her sleep<br/>
in and go in a separate car and miss part of her surprise party?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888006119">I don&#39;t know your children&#39;s ages but I tell my three year old that <br/>
when we are tired or hungary we get grouchy. I do. He does. Dada <br/>
does. I have said this for most of a year.<br/>
<br/>
So, he understands when he is starting to have difficulty with things <br/>
not working to his liking, getting louder, upset more frequently, <br/>
unable to decide what he wants, difficulty waiting to take turns, not <br/>
hearing when he is asked to stop taking, pushing, hitting, etc. I <br/>
describe what I see. And explained that it seems that he is tired or <br/>
hungary because I see xyz. We have done this enough times that he <br/>
says &quot;I&#39;m tired, I need a nap.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m hungary, I want food.&quot;<br/>
More recently, he has begun saying &quot;I want to go nite-nite&quot;. Other <br/>
times he is too engaged to stop, but the message is the same later.<br/>
<br/>
There is never any punishment for these behaviors. The behaviors are <br/>
his body telling him information. I try to help him have the words <br/>
for describing what is happening to his body. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, when I am getting tired or hungary, I tell him I am <br/>
getting grouchy, I need to eat or rest. And tell him that my body <br/>
feels healthier afterwards. Erik now tells me &quot;my body doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
healthy, I need to sleep&quot; or to eat. He does these things that HIS <br/>
body told him it needs, and he says &quot;I feel better&quot;. The point is *I* <br/>
am not telling him what to do or what his body needs. I am telling <br/>
what I see and how it impacts me. This has been empowering to him and <br/>
relaxing my need to monitor him.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>

It just takes time for them to reset their internal clocks so that they sleep in more when <br/>
they stay up later. It took us several months before it seemed everyone slept when tired <br/>
rather than trying to &quot;stay up&quot; or &quot;get up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. :)<br/>

couple of months and she LOVES to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
As far as them being a mess the next day or trying to decide about waking<br/>
them up......think of what you would do if they were adults.  How would you<br/>
handle it if an adult was staying up all night and then being a crab the<br/>
next day?  What if you were planning a surprise for your dh early one<br/>
morning?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;one is they don&#39;t recognize their own fatigue&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both of my sons are like this.  Both would be labeled ADHD if they were in<br/>
school.  They fight it and fight it and fight it.  The problem is that then<br/>
they are mean to the girls the next day.  It is a balancing act.  I want the<br/>
boys to make their own decisions but I can&#39;t let the consequences of those<br/>
decisions negatively impact the girls.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thank you for your suggestions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First of all, Julie to answer your questions, their ages are nearly 8 and<br/>
&gt; nearly 12.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a little to late for me to do it gradually. I tried to do that for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; first few days, but they realized quickly what I was doing. I agree with<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; that they may be binging and it may abate in time, how long would you<br/>
guess<br/>
&gt; I should expect it to take?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think Sandra&#39;s point about a bedtime having particular connotations is a<br/>
&gt; good point, however, I get the impression that there are certain things<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; my kids push to the backs of their minds. (I think it&#39;s an ADHD thing, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure.) All their lives there are several things that they appear<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; to notice, one is they don&#39;t recognize their own fatigue and they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; recognize when they have to go to the bathroom until it&#39;s dire. I remember<br/>
&gt; being amazed at other kids their age who would tell their parent&#39;s they<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; sleepy or would stop playing and curl up in a parent&#39;s lap and sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember when they were younger and I would see them wiping their eyes.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; would point out to them that it was a signal that their body was trying to<br/>
&gt; send them that they were sleepy. Not only would they argue that it wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; true, but they learned not to let me see them wiping their eyes. (Not<br/>
&gt; because I was forcing them to go to bed then, but I think they didn&#39;t WANT<br/>
&gt; to know when they were tired.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as when they wake up -- I *think* we&#39;ve been doing this long enough<br/>
&gt; that it&#39;s not because of when they are accustomed to waking up. Robyn, we<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; work hard to be quiet and to keep the lights down. (Kitty cat is annoying<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; by walking around the house mewing loudly enough to wake the dead,<br/>
though.)<br/>
&gt; I actually think my biggest enemy is biology. When their bladder is full<br/>
&gt; they go to the bathroom, realize it&#39;s light out and they don&#39;t go back to<br/>
&gt; sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have another question though -- what if you actually need to get up<br/>
early<br/>
&gt; the next day. Next week my cohousing community is going to a reservation<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re turning it into a birthday party for my daughter. We&#39;re going in<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; a few cars so I don&#39;t want to miss-the-boat per se. Do I still let her<br/>
sleep<br/>
&gt; in and go in a separate car and miss part of her surprise party?<br/>
