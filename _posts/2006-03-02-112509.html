<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737421936">After reading John Taylor Gatto&#39;s Underground History of American<br/>
Education, where Gatto talks about how child education became a thing<br/>
of government and business interests and passed into law mid-1800&#39;s<br/>
through 1920&#39;s in all the major mass manufacturer and coal production<br/>
countries, I was struck.  Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m overwhelmed by what Gatto<br/>
writes about, people as &quot;products&quot; of schooling.<br/>
<br/>
I subscribe to a book excerpt website and here&#39;s an excerpt from a<br/>
poet and critic of the time, which I thought interesting for<br/>
unschoolers who read Gatto.  The work that is Aristotle&#39;s life has<br/>
definitely been used extensively by school systems, and according to<br/>
Gatto, not for purposes of making intelligence grow.<br/>
<br/>
From Delanceyplace.com:<br/>
    In today&#39;s excerpt, T.S. Eliot comments on Aristotle.  Eliot, one<br/>
of the towering poets and literary critics of the 20th century, is<br/>
discussing the nature of Aristotle&#39;s genius in his article &#39;The<br/>
Perfect Critic&#39;.  The importance of the statement here is his <br/>
assertion that great analysis is not the outcome of some repeatable<br/>
process or method, but instead comes from intelligence alone:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Aristotle is a person who has suffered from the adherence of<br/>
persons who must be regarded less as his disciples than as his<br/>
sectaries.  One must be firmly distrustful of accepting Aristotle in a<br/>
canonical spirit; this is to lose the whole living force of him.   He<br/>
was primarily a man of not only remarkable but universal intelligence...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    ...in his short and broken treatise he provides an eternal<br/>
example-- not of laws, or even of method, for there is no method<br/>
except to be very intelligent, but of intelligence itself swiftly<br/>
operating the analysis of sensation to the point of principle and<br/>
definition.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>His book and point of view are very industrial-NE-U.S. and there is a  <br/>
lot of the country for which his &quot;facts&quot; aren&#39;t true.<br/>
That book frustrates me.  Had he called it the history of education  <br/>
in urban New England I wouldn&#39;t have cared.<br/>

That&#39;s cool.<br/>
Socrates is also used and abused by educators who twist the &quot;Socratic  <br/>
method&quot; to justify their lame school-style Q&A.<br/>
