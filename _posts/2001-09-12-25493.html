<div id="ygrps-yiv-378581538">If any of you know someone who was at WTC and has not been found this is<br/>
worth a read.  Skip the technical stuff at the beginning and just read<br/>
the last part if you want.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget<br/>
PS - I think it is legit because the source I got it from is pretty<br/>
reliable.  I know the tech stuff is pretty accurate and the companies<br/>
talked about do exist.  Also, those in the Broadcast business are feeling<br/>
pretty hard hit right now.  There were more than 10 stations on those<br/>
buildings and many of them were manned transmitter sites.<br/>

Subject: [RT] Rescue tool at WTC...more info.<br/>
<br/>
Motorola and Broadcast Electronics have teamed up to build and send to<br/>
NYC<br/>
a RF package which will emit a less than 100 watt signal into the rubble<br/>
and<br/>
pick up still buried smart cards. Operating around 180 Khz, the<br/>
transmitter simply generates an unmodulated carrier. The smart card<br/>
receives<br/>
the signal and generates a second very low power reply signal slightly<br/>
offset from the primary RF carrier.<br/>
<br/>
A high sensitivity receiver is monitored manually for what sounds like<br/>
computer hash, the sound of a smart card emission.  Directivity is<br/>
good.  Penetration is around 5-8ft.  Anything more would have required a<br/>
1KW transmitter and would get into EMI/RFR as well as power dissipation<br/>
issues.  The antenna is very lossy and the power is basically absorbed by<br/>
the transmission line in the loop antenna.  Trust me, it gets warm with<br/>
even 100 watts. But we were testing though walls and steel storage<br/>
cabinets to see if the signal is getting through.<br/>
<br/>
BE built and shipped the box to Schaumburg Friday. It is my understanding<br/>
Jerry Westberg personally drove it from Quincy to the Motorola<br/>
Campus.  FWIW, it had a BIG apple (Apple computer logo) drawn on the side<br/>
of the RF deck.<br/>
<br/>
A team of engineers worked non-stop until 2AM this morning from Friday to<br/>
get this thing on a plane to NYC by 7AM EDT.  Most you know Greg Buckwald<br/>
from his AM stereo days.  He&#39;s there heading up the effort. A couple of<br/>
my<br/>
stations contributed parts to the lab side of the research and I was at<br/>
the  campus helping test and pack the system before leaving late last<br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
They may need some assistance from local broadcast AM and LMR shops in<br/>
keeping the gear running.<br/>
<br/>
Please forward contact names and &quot;best chance to find&quot; phone numbers to<br/>
my<br/>
address off-list.<br/>
<br/>
We all realize they have a slim chance of finding someone alive at this<br/>
point.  However, if it aids the rescuers in any way towards speeding the<br/>
location of still alive victims or recovery of the departed, it will have<br/>
served its purpose and served it well.<br/>
<br/>
The system sent, BTW is the alpha version.  It is pre S/N 000001.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your support and help.<br/>
