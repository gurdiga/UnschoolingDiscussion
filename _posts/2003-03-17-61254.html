Naturalist intelligence (&quot;nature smart&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Naturalist intelligence allows people to distinguish among, classify, and use <br/>
features of the environment. Farmers, gardeners, botanists, geologists, <br/>
florists, and archaeologists all exhibit this intelligence, as do students <br/>
who can name and describe the features of every make of car around them.<br/>
<br/>
In a recent article, &quot;Are there additional intelligences?&quot; Gardner examined <br/>
two more candidate intelligences, naturalist, and spiritual, but ended up <br/>
rejecting spiritual--at least for now--because it does not meet the eight <br/>
criteria named earlier. He is still amassing evidence for other suggested <br/>
intelligences. For example, existential intelligence--manifest in somebody <br/>
who is concerned with fundamental questions of existence--does not, as yet, <br/>
seem to meet all criteria. If decisions about intelligences are to be taken <br/>
seriously, Gardner believes, they must depend upon examination of the <br/>
available data. So at this point, one might say that the existential <br/>
intelligence is the &quot;half&quot; in the 8-1/2 intelligences.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097356343">That&#39;s an interesting perspective on it - I&#39;m not sure what I<br/>
make&#39; over all&#39; of the &quot;intelligences&quot; concept.  Like a lot of<br/>
labels it helps me think about angles on a question that might<br/>
otherwise escape me.  I&#39;ll have to ponder it with this child.<br/>
<br/>
It is certainly true that I have seen her from the time she could<br/>
walk doing things with the natural world that were not just<br/>
precocious, but astounding.  She catches birds in her bare hands<br/>
without hurting them as if they were beads from a Mardis Gras<br/>
parade.  Already (we are 3 weeks before typical last frost date)<br/>
I have had my first tick from a &quot;come see&quot; trip to a pet rotting<br/>
log; the 6 half shelves around the kitchen window are looking<br/>
back at me through the walls of netting covered Mason jars.<br/>

Well don&#39;t just watch her.  Watch other kids stumble through spider webs <br/>
without noticing, not knowing a bird&#39;s nest from a pile of trash swirled into <br/>
the corner by the wind, etc.<br/>
