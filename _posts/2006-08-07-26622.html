<div id="ygrps-yiv-855943207">Hi all.  I apologize if this is not in keeping with the structure of <br/>
the list.  I know that questions regarding local homeschooling laws <br/>
are discouraged.  I&#39;m not sure where this one falls.  If anyone has <br/>
any answers, please feel free to e-mail me privately if you like.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for some info on behalf of my (15 yo next week) son.  He <br/>
has suddenly become very interested in getting a job, but my <br/>
understanding of the law (we&#39;re in FL) is that he will be very <br/>
limited in terms of hours he can work during the school year and <br/>
places that can hire a fifteen year old.  We are not registered with <br/>
our county&#39;s homeschooling division, but are enrolled in an umbrella <br/>
school where we only submit &quot;attendance.&quot;  Still, as I would have <br/>
expected, the law does not seem to make allowances for unschoolers.  <br/>
So my son had the bright idea that perhaps some of the parents on <br/>
this list may have children his age who have gotten jobs.  Any ideas <br/>
for getting around the restrictions?  I know that having a GED is one <br/>
option for avoiding being bound to the local &quot;school schedule,&quot; but <br/>
he has to be 18 for that, plus does not feel ready for it.  Perhaps <br/>
he should just wait a year or so.  I want to help him as much as I <br/>
can, but I&#39;m stuck.  I&#39;ve suggested perhaps voluntering somewhere <br/>
until he&#39;s a bit older, but his motivation for getting a job is <br/>
making some money to save for a future car, so he&#39;s not interested.  <br/>
Anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks so much.<br/>

<br/>
I wrote letters for both of my boys saying they were homeschooled,  <br/>
citing the state&#39;s flexibility on &quot;school days&quot; (homeschoolers  <br/>
declare their own schooldays), and said I could work around the hours  <br/>
they needed Kirby (or Marty) to work.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid goes to a private school that has a week off, the state laws  <br/>
about school night don&#39;t apply; that kid&#39;s on vacation.  So if a  <br/>
place wants a kid to work late on Wednesdays, you could  <br/>
(theoretically, if they were questioned, or whatever) just say that  <br/>
Thursdays aren&#39;t schooldays at your school.<br/>
<br/>
This might not apply where you are, but it worked fine here.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t matter that they weren&#39;t registered.  That&#39;s not the  <br/>
store&#39;s problem at ALL, but the store could say &quot;He did not have  <br/>
school the next day,&quot; and &quot;we have his mother&#39;s approval in writing&quot;  <br/>
and all like that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The law won&#39;t &quot;make allowances for unschoolers,&quot; but you should be  <br/>
able to make allowances for the law.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them you &quot;do your schooling&quot; at night, or tell them the plain  <br/>
truth--that because you are doing this flexibly at home, your 30  <br/>
hours a week can easily fit around their schedules.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe get your  umbrella-school coordinator to write a letter stating  <br/>
things like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479515122">Wendy,<br/>
<br/>
why doesn&#39;t he start his own business?  could he mow lawns... do yard work<br/>
and landscaping... walk dogs... pressure wash decks and houses?  my sis<br/>
lives in FL, so I know all of these things are always needed and wanted, esp<br/>
 in the higher class neighborhoods... and being in FL is nice because you<br/>
aren&#39;t really restricted by the weather.<br/>
<br/>
you all could sit down and brainstorm for ideas and then see what he wants<br/>
to do from there.<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s my 2 cents...<br/>
<br/>

Cameron&#39;s first job was at a deli making the milkshakes and scooping <br/>
the ice cream cones. He cleaned and was available on &quot;off&quot; hours. He <br/>
even volunteered to come in and clean on Easter Sunday. They LOVED him! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; They paid him under the table until he turned 15. Then he filled <br/>
out the W-2 and got paid for real. He worked there for almost a year <br/>
when he went to work for a caterer.<br/>
<br/>
Cam&#39;s been housesitting for years though---BIG money in that. He spends <br/>
the night and cares for the plants and pets and house.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t had any problems with the law. &lt;g&gt; We just haven&#39;t followed <br/>
it! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are social security forms you can fill out as a <br/>
homeschooler (NOT as an unschooler!) to get by the underage laws. We <br/>
never used them, but I know they are out there. I&#39;d suggest just <br/>
hooking up with a local place where you do a LOT of business (like our <br/>
deli) or a grocery nearby where they see him out and about during the <br/>
day. Or have him start his own business---like the pet/houseesitting or <br/>
poop-scooping (I keep telling people about this that business and <br/>
NOBODY takes me up on it! It would be ESPCECIALLY good in FL where all <br/>
those elderly have dogs but don&#39;t want to go out and scoop---he could <br/>
make a mint!!!)<br/>
<br/>
It IS possible, you just have o do the legwork. Call the SS office.<br/>

to also get Zoe a work permit (needed in Illinois from 14-16) but she  <br/>
ended up getting paid under the table.<br/>
<br/>
Check your state laws and figure out what you absolutely have to do  <br/>
and work around the rest. School hours could be anything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130707550">My youngest dd (9 almost 10) really enjoys her pen pals. (pony pen pals, of<br/>
course)  She has four of them right now and just sent for 2 more.  She<br/>
always looks forward to their letters and she is pretty prompt about writing<br/>
back.  She has almost always written her letters on the computer and printed<br/>
them out because she didn&#39;t feel like her hand writing was neat enough to be<br/>
legible.  (and sometimes it wasn&#39;t)   Quite often her pen pals write back to<br/>
her in long hand and she has noticed how neat some of them write.  I think<br/>
it inspired her to try harder to write neatly.  This last batch of pen pal<br/>
letters that she sent out were all written in long hand and they were not<br/>
only neat, but she actually used capital and lowercase letters<br/>
appropriately.  Since she began writing, she&#39;s used almost exclusively<br/>
capital letters when writing in long hand.  She just found it easier than<br/>
printing lower case letters.  When writing on the computer she has always<br/>
used both lower case and upper case letters.  I was pleasantly surprised at<br/>
just how lovely her letters were.  The punctuation was right on too, except<br/>
in one or two places.  It never ceases to amaze me to see how things all<br/>
come together when the kids have a purpose for something and they are ready<br/>
for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432598695">Thank you to everyone who has offered ideas and encouragement  about my son&#39;s <br/>
job quest.  You all have really given us some great places  to start, but <br/>
more than anything, you&#39;ve given me a much-needed boost in  confidence.  I was <br/>
feeling rather restricted by the &quot;school-oriented&quot; laws,  but now I&#39;m reminded <br/>
that we intentionally live our lives outside of the  school bubble and that we <br/>
can do whatever we put our minds to.  I needed a  dose of reality.  Thanks <br/>
again.<br/>
