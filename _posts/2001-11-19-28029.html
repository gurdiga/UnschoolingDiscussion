<div id="ygrps-yiv-62793347">To me, unschooling is simply saying goodbye to the institution of school, <br/>
the waiting in lines there, the cafeteria lunches, the dreary assignments <br/>
for kids whose imaginations have already flown  to some other plane. It&#39;s <br/>
about involving our kids in real life -- planning and fixing meals, reading <br/>
a book they want to read and not having to wait in line to talk about it. <br/>
It&#39;s about ditching worksheets where kids are supposed to add up pictures of <br/>
coins, and replacing them with real circumstances where kids can count and <br/>
spend real actual money. And replacing all those other fake assignments <br/>
with, hey, real life!<br/>
<br/>
It is *not* about abandoning our parental responsibilities, such as, if we <br/>
feel it necessary, requiring chores, bedtimes, family mealtimes, limits or <br/>
bans on certain foods, respect for others, limits on TV and Nintendo, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I just felt it was necessary to make this quick distinction.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; It is *not* about abandoning our parental responsibilities, such as, if we<br/>
&gt; feel it necessary, requiring chores, bedtimes, family mealtimes, limits or<br/>
&gt; bans on certain foods, respect for others, limits on TV and Nintendo, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of people (lots and LOTS of people, and even more if they knew what we<br/>
were doing) think that unschooling is abandoning our parental<br/>
responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think NOT feeling it&#39;s necessary to require chores, bedtimes, family<br/>
mealtimes, limits or bans on certain foods, respect for others, limits on TV<br/>
and Nintendo, etc. is abandoning parental responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious about exactly what real families you know who don&#39;t require<br/>
(deep breath) chores, bedtimes, family mealtimes, limits or bans on certain<br/>
foods, respect for others, limits on TV and Nintendo, etc. do or don&#39;t do<br/>
that you attribute to abandoning parental responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
If one person says, &quot;I limit television so my children won&#39;t spend all day<br/>
stuck in front of a box&quot; and another person says, &quot;I don&#39;t limit television<br/>
and my children don&#39;t spend all day stuck in front of a box&quot;, I&#39;m not real<br/>
clear on why some would think the first option more parentally responsible<br/>
than the second.<br/>

they come to do them.<br/>
Our son has never been required to do *chores*.  He&#39;s never been asked to<br/>
clean his room.  He&#39;s never been told to take out the trash.  He does<br/>
these things anyway, because he has lived in a house where he sees people<br/>
doing what is needed.  He learned about keeping his environment livable<br/>
by living in it.  He learned about helping by being helped, and having a<br/>
chance to help.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a child who lives in a loving home will become an ax<br/>
murderer if he&#39;s required  to clean his room.  I just question whether<br/>
the &quot;requirement&quot; is really necessary to a learning person.<br/>
<br/>
I have never felt it was my parental responsibility to *require* things<br/>
of my child.  Parental responsibility for me, is providing a safe and<br/>
loving place for him to learn and grow in his own way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5825611">Perhaps, the use of the phrase &quot;abandoning parental responsibilities&quot; <br/>
stemmed from the fact that you often sound like you are advocating <br/>
total and complete abandonment of parental responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that is what you mean to be saying.  But I do see why <br/>
others respond to you as if it is what you say.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175218191">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new....I&#39;m still unlearning....I&#39;m also in a fragile state due to recent<br/>
personal tragedies....but I&#39;m trying, so please go easy on me....<br/>
<br/>
For clarification sake, what you (the general group, from what I&#39;ve read so<br/>
far) seem to saying is that I shouldn&#39;t restrict things like TV, junk foods,<br/>
messiness....  How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?  And<br/>
chores, you say no to those too...so after dinner, when my child asks to be<br/>
excused &lt;gasp!  still unlearning, still deciding what of all of this I&#39;ll<br/>
take and what I&#39;ll leave, but yes I did say &quot;asks to be excused&quot; gasp<br/>
again!&gt; and I say &quot;sure, please take your dishes in to the kitchen&quot; , it&#39;s a<br/>
&#39;bad&#39; thing?  So much of what I learned and the way I was brought up has to<br/>
be thrown out the window....stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>
manners, being responsible, etc.  (My mom decided hair length on my<br/>
college-aged brother.)<br/>
<br/>
A couple of questions/comments....<br/>
<br/>
I had a miscarriage in 99, my DD was 1 1/2.  In the aftermath of that event<br/>
she watched LOTS more tv (videos, we don&#39;t have cable) than ever<br/>
before...she&#39;d watch a couple of hours a day, as opposed to a half hour<br/>
every couple of days.  I noticed a HUGE decline in her ability to engage in<br/>
activities herself.  She had never before been &#39;bored&#39; and now she&#39;d walk<br/>
around the house, see nothing that interested her and ask to watch tv.<br/>
Prior to this she&#39;d have gotten engaged in any number of things...from water<br/>
play, to toys, to books, etc.  Her imagination seemed to be put on hold.<br/>
Her behavior also changed.  She was suddenly unable to cope with everyday<br/>
minor things...they&#39;d throw her into a tailspin....she also became<br/>
uncooperative (alright, maybe we were asking her to do a chore...).  I was<br/>
amazed to see the changes in her and I considered them negative<br/>
changes....so soon after we went back to limited video viewing and her<br/>
imagination seemed to kick in again.  But, you&#39;re telling me that if she<br/>
wants to watch videos, I should let her watch them...all day if that&#39;s what<br/>
she wants....  (Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>
emotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>
behavior....)  And what about the types of videos?  Do I get any say in what<br/>
she watches?  She&#39;s 3 1/2, btw.  And you never ask your kids to pick up<br/>
their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?  If DD cuts up a piece<br/>
of paper into hundreds of tiny pieces of paper on the dining room floor and<br/>
walks away....can&#39;t I later ask her to pick them up?  Or do I have to wait<br/>
for &#39;natural&#39; consequences to kick in...<br/>
<br/>
Also, why is it a bad thing if we grow, raise, purchase, cook, and provide<br/>
for our family healthy, wholesome, organic foods? I work really hard to do<br/>
this!   DD usually (unless the day is out of control altogether) gets to<br/>
decide what she wants for breakfast, lunch, and snacks from what we have in<br/>
the house.  On occasion she decides dinner and/or will make dessert.  She<br/>
has a bagel...everyday almost.  She has grilled cheese....everyday almost.<br/>
She gets up on the counter and looks in the cabinets or in the fridge for<br/>
snacks/drinks.  She can select anything....all of it is fairly to very<br/>
healthy.  She and her dad go for doughnuts on Saturday mornings as a<br/>
treat....they also share twizzlers from time to time.  I did restrict<br/>
Halloween candy....she could have two pieces after she at her meal &lt;gasp!&gt;<br/>
but then the dog ate all the rest so that was that.  We have always talked<br/>
about healthy v. non healthy foods.  It&#39;s OK to eat non healthy foods, but<br/>
not all the time...it&#39;s the healthy foods that help us grow and stay fit.<br/>
It was wrong to say this?  It&#39;s the truth (as I see it...you may disagree)<br/>
Hmmmm, I have some difficulty applying unschooling across the board....I<br/>
look forward to continuing to &#39;listen&#39; to your conversations....this is all<br/>
so very interesting to me....<br/>
<br/>
Can I stay if I take some and leave some?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; snacks/drinks.  She can select anything....all of it is fairly to very<br/>
&gt; healthy.  She and her dad go for doughnuts on Saturday mornings as a<br/>
&gt; treat....they also share twizzlers from time to time.  I did restrict<br/>
&gt; Halloween candy....she could have two pieces after she at her meal &lt;gasp!&gt;<br/>
&gt; but then the dog ate all the rest so that was that.  We have always talked<br/>
&gt; about healthy v. non healthy foods.  It&#39;s OK to eat non healthy foods, but<br/>
&gt; not all the time...it&#39;s the healthy foods that help us grow and stay fit.<br/>
&gt; It was wrong to say this?  It&#39;s the truth (as I see it...you may disagree)<br/>
&gt; Hmmmm, I have some difficulty applying unschooling across the board....I<br/>
&gt; look forward to continuing to &#39;listen&#39; to your conversations....this is<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; so very interesting to me....<br/>

&gt; Can I stay if I take some and leave some?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am curious about exactly what real families you know who don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; require...<br/>
&gt; &gt;  chores..., etc. do or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that you attribute to abandoning parental responsibilities.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious too.  How does having control really make someone a more<br/>
&gt; &gt; responsible parent?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Deb L<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If one person says, &quot;I limit television so my children won&#39;t spend<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all day<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuck in front of a box&quot; and another person says, &quot;I don&#39;t limit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; television<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and my children don&#39;t spend all day stuck in front of a box&quot;, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not real<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clear on why some would think the first option more parentally<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsible<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; than the second.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548660498">&lt;&lt; Perhaps, the use of the phrase &quot;abandoning parental responsibilities&quot; <br/>
stemmed from the fact that you often sound like you are advocating <br/>
total and complete abandonment of parental responsibility.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m trying to get people to reexamine what &quot;responsibility&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t abandoned my children in any way.<br/>
I&#39;m not an irresponsible parent in any way (except from the point of view of <br/>
those who think kids should be in school, or on a schedule, or tested).<br/>
<br/>
So if there are people on a list who believe and defend the idea that it is <br/>
neglectful to develop a new awareness of what children can do if given the <br/>
leeway to do it, then unschooling is going to be difficult to discuss <br/>
productively.<br/>
<br/>
I think the root word of &quot;responsible&quot; being &quot;respond,&quot; that I&#39;m wanting to <br/>
respond to my children where they are in each moment.  (Quite likely the <br/>
intended &quot;response&quot; in the history of the word/concept is to have to report <br/>
to someone higher up that you have sufficiently ignored the child and broken <br/>
his spirit to earn the praise and approval of the authority above you; I&#39;m <br/>
not reporting to other authorities, I am living with my family.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358261114">&lt;&lt; But, you&#39;re telling me that if she<br/>
wants to watch videos, I should let her watch them...all day if that&#39;s what<br/>
she wants....  (Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>
emotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>
behavior....)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you seem to be blaming TV without the surrounding factors.<br/>
<br/>
AND she was getting older every day, every hour.  What was fascinating to her <br/>
before was old now.  Kids need new input, and they need things to do WITH the <br/>
adults, not just in the same building with the adults.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And what about the types of videos?  Do I get any say in what<br/>
she watches? -=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re asking this as though you think there is some need to do everything <br/>
some other person&#39;s way.  Do it your way.  There is a river of information <br/>
here, and some of it will change your life if you want, and some won&#39;t, and <br/>
none of it is binding on you (except in that way that if you had never heard <br/>
of it you wouldn&#39;t be responsible for considering it).<br/>
<br/>
-=-And you never ask your kids to pick up<br/>
their mess or are you talking only about their rooms? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Of course I ask my kids to pick up messes, but not on a schedule.  I don&#39;t <br/>
say &quot;by 11:00 every morning there must be no speck of your stuff in any <br/>
public area, and this must be done every day before you may eat lunch.&quot;    If <br/>
there&#39;s not about to be something happening on the table, Marty&#39;s card <br/>
sorting and Holly&#39;s art can sit there.  When it&#39;s time to eat or play a game, <br/>
they move their stuff.  Or they move it when they want it.  Or I move it <br/>
(gently) if I need the table and they&#39;re not around.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-If DD cuts up a piece<br/>
of paper into hundreds of tiny pieces of paper on the dining room floor and<br/>
walks away....can&#39;t I later ask her to pick them up?  Or do I have to wait<br/>
for &#39;natural&#39; consequences to kick in...-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a natural consequence if you want it picked up and she has to quit doing <br/>
something fun to come pick it up.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s NOT a natural consequence if you say &quot;paper on the floor costs you half <br/>
your allowance&quot; or &quot;Because there was paper on the floor, you&#39;re grounded.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But a little kid probably can&#39;t pick up all that paper alone, and if you help <br/>
her it could be made a game.  You could wet your fingers and  let the paper <br/>
stick to them and drop it in the trash like magnetic cranes at the wrecking <br/>
yard.<br/>
<br/>
Modelling creativity and joy is part of the job.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, why is it a bad thing if we grow, raise, purchase, cook, and provide<br/>
for our family healthy, wholesome, organic foods? I work really hard to do<br/>
this! -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not bad.  Nobody said it was bad.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s OK to eat non healthy foods, but<br/>
not all the time...it&#39;s the healthy foods that help us grow and stay fit.<br/>
It was wrong to say this?  It&#39;s the truth (as I see it...you may disagree)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the people who let their kids choose are telling their kids that <br/>
Tootsie Roll is just as good for them as apples are?  They&#39;re not.   I&#39;m not <br/>
keeping my kids ignorant of what foods are and what they&#39;re good for.   I&#39;m <br/>
keeping them relatively ignorant of shame and of what it feels like to be tol<br/>
d what and where and how to eat every meal of the day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Can I stay if I take some and leave some?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It that weren&#39;t the case, nobody could stay.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither of us ask to be excused, we might say &quot;excuse me&quot;. OTOH, I have<br/>
asked her to bring her dishes into the kitchen, or to make a &quot;dish run&quot;<br/>
and round up any other dishes left in the living room, or carry a basket<br/>
full of laundry to the bedroom since she&#39;s going there... and she rarely<br/>
says no and if so, there&#39;s a good reason. I think the key is ask,<br/>
though... she certainly could say no, but she doesn&#39;t... we&#39;re just used<br/>
to working together and helping each other.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you think that that might have had more to do with your being in a<br/>
state of grief and perhaps less available than formerly? Ah, wait, I see<br/>
that you dismiss this idea farther down - but why?  It makes a lot of<br/>
sense to me. It could also be part of the process of learning to<br/>
self-regulate, like when kids who have never been allowed to eat more<br/>
than one piece of candy are suddenly able to eat all they want, they<br/>
often stuff themselves silly, since that&#39;s what everyone has expected<br/>
that they will do all of their lives if they were given that freedom.<br/>
Freedom often takes some getting used to.<br/>
<br/>
It also sounds like pretty typical 1 1/2 yr old developmental stuff,<br/>
especially is you were starting to expect her to do chores at that age.<br/>

no...<br/>

&gt; to do  this!   <br/>

sort of a mix of things like tofu meatloaf (Cacie loves this, the rest of<br/>
us think it&#39;s got a really weird texture) and broccoli and carrots and<br/>
choclate frogs and peppermint ice cream and sushi and bagels and rice<br/>
crackers and chips... whatever. We all go shopping most of the time...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a kind of simplistic truth. Straight sugar will help you<br/>
grow, too, it has calories. I have talked about vitamins, and about<br/>
protein and carbs and sugar... Cacie plays soccer, so on Saturday she<br/>
spends two hours running up and down the soccer field. We&#39;ve done some<br/>
research on carbohydrates and proteins and stuff, and she finds that a<br/>
lot of sugar or fat before the game makes her feel ill after a half hour<br/>
or so... I have also noticed that she tends to get emotionally<br/>
overwrought more easily if she hasn&#39;t had food in a while, especially<br/>
protein... my brother was like this as a kid, so I&#39;m a little familiar<br/>
with it, although I can go a day without eating and not feel any ill<br/>
effects.So, I&#39;ve spent years now trying to point out the connection and<br/>
she&#39;s pretty good now about grabbing some food when she&#39;s feeling that<br/>
way... of course, it&#39;s not a sure thing, sometimes she doesn&#39;t eat for<br/>
hours and is fine, but if she does feel sad for no reason it&#39;s often a<br/>
clue..<br/>
<br/>

&gt; total and complete abandonment of parental responsibility.<br/>
<br/>

responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
I would think myself irresponsible if I took the right to make their own<br/>
choices from my children.<br/>
<br/>
My parental responsibility is to provide the kind of home and life that<br/>
gives my children choices, and trusts them to make the ones right for them.<br/>

Sometimes Kirby will come gallumping in kinda surly and say &quot;I  need some <br/>
protein.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And we plan ahead about it too.  If he&#39;s going to be involved for something <br/>
for over four hours, we try to make sure his last act before plunging into <br/>
the activity is to have a few ounces of protein and some water.<br/>

In New Mexico, dehydration can be a serious factor in a lot of kid grumpiness <br/>
(and adult grumpiness).  Even in the winter it&#39;s dry.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;For clarification sake, what you (the general group, from what I&#39;ve read so<br/>
&gt;far) seem to saying is that I shouldn&#39;t restrict things like TV, junk foods,<br/>
&gt;messiness....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s quite a bit of disagreement here on these issues.  I think <br/>
you need to do what works best for you and your family.  On the other hand, <br/>
I&#39;ve changed my attitude toward some of these things (like TV) as a result <br/>
of these discussions, so keeping an open mind is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you&#39;re asking permission.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a lot that goes into the bedtime decision.  Some kids tend <br/>
to go to sleep when they get tired.  I actually had *one* like that.  Other <br/>
kids get wound up and cranky when they get tired, but fight sleep as if it <br/>
were the enemy.  I think those kids need to be treated a bit differently in <br/>
terms of the bedtime thing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a mother&#39;s sanity is pretty important to her kids.  Many mothers <br/>
don&#39;t keep their sanity well if they don&#39;t get some alone or <br/>
alone-with-hubby time at the end of the day.  I think it&#39;s to their kids&#39; <br/>
advantage if the mother gets that time, one way or another.  Some mothers <br/>
don&#39;t specify a bedtime so much as a time for everyone being reasonably <br/>
quiet and in their own space (or at least out of the parent&#39;s space).  And <br/>
then there comes a time when your kid will want to stay up later than <br/>
you.  I fought the idea with my youngest (now 14), thinking that I *had* to <br/>
have that time after everyone went to bed to do my writing.  My son was <br/>
persistent and I finally realized that I could do my writing in the morning <br/>
just as well as at night.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you&#39;re paying attention to your child&#39;s needs and wants, <br/>
and trying to make sure that all of their needs and at least some of their <br/>
wants get met, one way or another, you&#39;re being a responsible parent.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And<br/>
&gt;chores, you say no to those too...so after dinner, when my child asks to be<br/>
&gt;excused &lt;gasp!  still unlearning, still deciding what of all of this I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;take and what I&#39;ll leave, but yes I did say &quot;asks to be excused&quot; gasp<br/>
&gt;again!&gt; and I say &quot;sure, please take your dishes in to the kitchen&quot; , it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;&#39;bad&#39; thing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being polite is a bad thing?  &lt;g&gt;  I guess the reaction to that one would <br/>
depend on what happens if the child doesn&#39;t do what was asked.  When Lars <br/>
was younger, we didn&#39;t insist on any chores.  He loved helping us, and we <br/>
felt we got more of a contribution to the work of the family by *not* <br/>
assigning chores.  Then he got older.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now he has *one* regular after-dinner clean-up chore.  He is *asked* to do <br/>
other things, like chopping kindling and bringing in firewood, because <br/>
these things are very difficult and painful for me.  And Dad is working <br/>
really hard and I don&#39;t want him to have to do it when he comes home.  Lars <br/>
is pretty reasonable about doing these things.  It&#39;s a compromise that <br/>
works for our family.  We&#39;re very flexible, though.  When Lars was working <br/>
with his dad full time for a few weeks, he was just too bagged at the end <br/>
of the day to do his cleanup chore.  So I did it.  No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So much of what I learned and the way I was brought up has to<br/>
&gt;be thrown out the window....stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>
&gt;manners, being responsible, etc.  (My mom decided hair length on my<br/>
&gt;college-aged brother.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yikes!  And he let her?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;A couple of questions/comments....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a miscarriage in 99, my DD was 1 1/2.  In the aftermath of that event<br/>
&gt;she watched LOTS more tv (videos, we don&#39;t have cable) than ever<br/>
&gt;before...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son was about the same age when my first marraige broke up.  He watched <br/>
a *lot* of Sesame Street, etc. while I was trying to get my head back together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  But, you&#39;re telling me that if she<br/>
&gt;wants to watch videos, I should let her watch them...all day if that&#39;s what<br/>
&gt;she wants....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some folks are saying that.  Not all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  And what about the types of videos?  Do I get any say in what<br/>
&gt;she watches?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There you go, asking permission again.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Again, listen to what everyone is saying, but make up your mind according <br/>
to what will work for you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And you never ask your kids to pick up<br/>
&gt;their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?  If DD cuts up a piece<br/>
&gt;of paper into hundreds of tiny pieces of paper on the dining room floor and<br/>
&gt;walks away....can&#39;t I later ask her to pick them up?  Or do I have to wait<br/>
&gt;for &#39;natural&#39; consequences to kick in...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There wouldn&#39;t *be* any natural consequences to that which would actually <br/>
affect her.  If she leaves them there, they obviously don&#39;t bother <br/>
her.  Personally, I don&#39;t have a problem with asking older kids to pick up <br/>
after themselves.  I&#39;d do the same if I had a messy adult roommate.  With <br/>
little kids, it works a lot better to start picking up and ask them to do <br/>
it with you.  Even if she only picks up one or two pieces, you could thank <br/>
her for her help and point out how much nicer things look now.<br/>
<br/>
I also figured out recently that if I just go ahead and clean up the house <br/>
to a certain point, and keep putting other people&#39;s things where they <br/>
belong when they get left out, that the rest of the family starts to follow <br/>
suit after a while.  I always left other people&#39;s stuff where it was, and <br/>
got annoyed about the fact that they never seemed to notice it.  Now I find <br/>
that they notice it sooner because I&#39;ve been keeping things tidier.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, why is it a bad thing if we grow, raise, purchase, cook, and provide<br/>
&gt;for our family healthy, wholesome, organic foods? I work really hard to do<br/>
&gt;this!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen anyone say this.  I think maybe what some people are saying <br/>
about the food issue is to not make it into almost a religion, a moral issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I did restrict<br/>
&gt;Halloween candy....she could have two pieces after she at her meal &lt;gasp!&gt;<br/>
&gt;but then the dog ate all the rest so that was that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope the dog was ok.  Chocolate is poison to dogs, especially little ones.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We have always talked<br/>
&gt;about healthy v. non healthy foods.  It&#39;s OK to eat non healthy foods, but<br/>
&gt;not all the time...it&#39;s the healthy foods that help us grow and stay fit.<br/>
&gt;It was wrong to say this?  It&#39;s the truth (as I see it...you may disagree)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  But I also think you need to be careful not to put so much <br/>
emphasis on how bad some foods are that they become the desired forbidden <br/>
fruit.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hmmmm, I have some difficulty applying unschooling across the board....I<br/>
&gt;look forward to continuing to &#39;listen&#39; to your conversations....this is all<br/>
&gt;so very interesting to me....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a process.  I think that if you just decided that one person <br/>
here was right and you were going to do everything &quot;her&quot; way (whichever <br/>
&quot;her&quot; you chose) that you wouldn&#39;t be unschooling at all.  You&#39;d merely be <br/>
following &quot;her&quot; curriculum.  &lt;g&gt;  My advice would be to let go of the <br/>
things that you can see now are not important to control.  As you see that <br/>
working well, think about what you could let go next, and try that, always <br/>
keeping a close eye on how it&#39;s affecting your child and your family.  It <br/>
has to work for your family.  If it isn&#39;t working, try to see why and find <br/>
a way to change things so it will work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can I stay if I take some and leave some?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say that you would be thinking for yourself, and that&#39;s a *good* thing.<br/>

&gt; play, to toys, to books, etc.  Her imagination seemed to be put on hold.<br/>
&gt; Her behavior also changed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe that children&#39;s ability to regulate their TV viewing is vastly<br/>
different in times of crisis and difficulty.  When real life isn&#39;t fun and<br/>
interesting, then TV viewing can go up and up.  The extra viewing can squeeze<br/>
other things out of life temporarily.  This isn&#39;t great, but I don&#39;t think a<br/>
mom should beat herself up if she is busy grieving or ill or healing and her<br/>
kids watch &quot;too much&quot; TV.  I hope a parent in this situation would be gentle to<br/>
herself and agonize as little as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I think the advice that&#39;s often given in this forum, about kids being able to<br/>
self-regulated their viewing, is intended for normal to good life<br/>
circumstances.  I don&#39;t think this general advice fits well in extreme<br/>
situations.  (And I&#39;m not trying to blame people for their life circumstances.<br/>
Just saying that common denominator advice may not suit them at that time.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992938157"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never have. She goes to bed when she&#39;s tired, just like the rest of us<br/>
&gt; do. We&#39;re probably one of the few families in America who have never had<br/>
&gt; a fight over bedtime...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t generally fight about it either.  She gets to read or play in bed<br/>
and she often falls asleep doing so.  At our house though some of us don&#39;t<br/>
go to bed when we are tired....we stay up on the computer or reading or<br/>
watching TV &lt;gasp, smile&gt; and need someone to urge us into bed.  If she&#39;s<br/>
really into something and wants to, she can stay up a little longer and we<br/>
just turn off the light at the same time...so it&#39;s like trading the in bed<br/>
reading/playing time for whatever she was doing.  Probably more parental<br/>
involvement here on our part than some of you.  (but, that&#39;s OK I tell the<br/>
woman in the mirror, smile)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll take and what I&#39;ll leave, but yes I did say &quot;asks to be excused&quot;<br/>

&gt; Neither of us ask to be excused, we might say &quot;excuse me&quot;. OTOH, I have<br/>
&gt; asked her to bring her dishes into the kitchen, or to make a &quot;dish run&quot;<br/>
&gt; and round up any other dishes left in the living room, or carry a basket<br/>
&gt; full of laundry to the bedroom since she&#39;s going there... and she rarely<br/>

&gt; though... she certainly could say no, but she doesn&#39;t... we&#39;re just used<br/>
&gt; to working together and helping each other.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, it&#39;s a request, and she does once in a while say, &#39;no thank you&#39;, but<br/>
she usually does bring them in.  The asking to leave the table thing...oh,<br/>
that&#39;s just so bred into us!  Hmmmm....I&#39;ll think on letting that go...<br/>

&gt; Do you think that that might have had more to do with your being in a<br/>
&gt; state of grief and perhaps less available than formerly? Ah, wait, I see<br/>
&gt; that you dismiss this idea farther down - but why?  It makes a lot of<br/>
&gt; sense to me. It could also be part of the process of learning to<br/>
&gt; self-regulate, like when kids who have never been allowed to eat more<br/>
&gt; than one piece of candy are suddenly able to eat all they want, they<br/>
&gt; often stuff themselves silly, since that&#39;s what everyone has expected<br/>
&gt; that they will do all of their lives if they were given that freedom.<br/>
&gt; Freedom often takes some getting used to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  Could be it.  Maybe if it had continued she would have turned them off<br/>
herself.  I&#39;m not sure why I blame the TV solely...as I said to Sandra...I<br/>
might not be willing to admit that grief got in the way....that I wasn&#39;t<br/>

word....  I wasn&#39;t asking her to chop wood (we heat with it) or make her bed<br/>
so I could bounce a quarter off it!  It was (what I consider)<br/>
developmentally appropriate stuff...like, here Em, help mommy put away all<br/>
your sand toys back in the sand box before we go back inside....  She&#39;d<br/>
throw herself on the ground and scream during the TV binge time and hadn&#39;t<br/>
done that prior to it.  Yes, yes, yes...there could have been other<br/>
influences, coincidentally occuring at the same time....  But, don&#39;t think<br/>
she had a chore list and I was freaking out because she wasn&#39;t doing them<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sure you can ask, as long as it&#39;s asking and not commanding. Often people<br/>
&gt; say ask when they mean command. Asking implies that the answer could be<br/>
&gt; no...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ask means ask for me.  Commands are only used in emergency safety<br/>
issues...like &quot;STOP!&quot; when she runs at top speed along the top of the<br/>
playground equipment toward the unprotected edge over which she&#39;d drop to<br/>
certain injury....used very rarely and mostly during that scarey time when<br/>
she could walk and run all over but had no sense of what would happen if she<br/>
plummeted....  We generally think it&#39;s better to fall out of tree and break<br/>
an arm than to never climb a tree...but we do have some limits to this.<br/>
Anyway, yes, generally she&#39;s asked...sometimes, if I need the house picked<br/>
up (so I can impress people with how clean it is, as if no one actually<br/>
lives here) then it&#39;s less negotiable....but I always help her if it&#39;s<br/>

about energy levels, but we haven&#39;t reached the point of researching carbs.<br/>
She&#39;s only 3 1/2 and it&#39;s really not a big issue for her.  She gets the junk<br/>
at her granparents&#39; or friends&#39; houses and occasionally at ours or at a<br/>
restaurant.  She doesn&#39;t have to beg for stuff so it&#39;s just not a big deal.<br/>
She knows grandma susie has the sweet cereal and at home she always asks for<br/>
a bagel (multigrain/organic....but she doesn&#39;t know that, she just knows she<br/>
likes them).<br/>
<br/>
I have also noticed that she tends to get emotionally<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; overwrought more easily if she hasn&#39;t had food in a while, especially<br/>
&gt; protein... my brother was like this as a kid, so I&#39;m a little familiar<br/>
&gt; with it, although I can go a day without eating and not feel any ill<br/>
&gt; effects.So, I&#39;ve spent years now trying to point out the connection and<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s pretty good now about grabbing some food when she&#39;s feeling that<br/>
&gt; way... of course, it&#39;s not a sure thing, sometimes she doesn&#39;t eat for<br/>
&gt; hours and is fine, but if she does feel sad for no reason it&#39;s often a<br/>
&gt; clue..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!  THis happens to both my DD and I.  Hubby can go for hours and hours<br/>
without eating and be fine!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726042197">I find that giving freedom of choice to my sons as been much harder on us as<br/>
parents. We had to be conscious of leading by example and think twice about<br/>
our own choices.<br/>
And then there are chores! A very inadequate word when living in a familly<br/>
community. How about familly participation in familly affairs, like washing<br/>
clothes, dishes, bathrooms, vehicles ect... cleaning and organizing home,<br/>
cooking, shopping, budget and so on. How would they learn to do these things<br/>
for themselves if they don&#39;t do them first with us?<br/>
Am I the only one feeling that way?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746189600">Hmm...What if everyone in the house said &#39;no thank you&#39; to doing the <br/>
dishes?  You would have a pretty messy house pretty soon.  If a child <br/>
lives in the home and gets all the benefits of being in the home, why <br/>
shouldn&#39;t the child do his/her fair share of the housework?  Is it <br/>
fair to let one (or two) people do all of the housework?  <br/>
<br/>

sees.  <br/>
My husband and I pick up after ourselves, so does our son.<br/>
We take dishes to the sink and rinse them, so does he.  <br/>
We clean up when someone&#39;s coming over, ( scrape up at least one layer of<br/>
cat and dog hair ) so does he.  <br/>
<br/>
Children learn by example.  If they are shown the bad example, they learn<br/>
the bad example.  Same with the good.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think children who live in a house where big people are happy to<br/>
do their part, are going to be any less happy to do theirs.  Sandra has<br/>
said modeling, creativity and joy are a factor, and I believe this is<br/>
true.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new....I&#39;m still unlearning....I&#39;m also in a fragile state due to<br/>
&gt; recent<br/>
&gt; &gt; personal tragedies....but I&#39;m trying, so please go easy on me....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For clarification sake, what you (the general group, from what I&#39;ve read<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; far) seem to saying is that I shouldn&#39;t restrict things like TV, junk<br/>
&gt; foods,<br/>
&gt; &gt; messiness....  How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?  And<br/>
&gt; &gt; chores, you say no to those too...so after dinner, when my child asks to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; excused &lt;gasp!  still unlearning, still deciding what of all of this<br/>
I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; take and what I&#39;ll leave, but yes I did say &quot;asks to be excused&quot; gasp<br/>
&gt; &gt; again!&gt; and I say &quot;sure, please take your dishes in to the kitchen&quot; ,<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;bad&#39; thing?  So much of what I learned and the way I was brought up has<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be thrown out the window....stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>
&gt; &gt; manners, being responsible, etc.  (My mom decided hair length on my<br/>
&gt; &gt; college-aged brother.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A couple of questions/comments....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had a miscarriage in 99, my DD was 1 1/2.  In the aftermath of that<br/>
&gt; event<br/>
&gt; &gt; she watched LOTS more tv (videos, we don&#39;t have cable) than ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; before...she&#39;d watch a couple of hours a day, as opposed to a half hour<br/>
&gt; &gt; every couple of days.  I noticed a HUGE decline in her ability to engage<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; activities herself.  She had never before been &#39;bored&#39; and now she&#39;d<br/>
walk<br/>
&gt; &gt; around the house, see nothing that interested her and ask to watch tv.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Prior to this she&#39;d have gotten engaged in any number of things...from<br/>
&gt; water<br/>
&gt; &gt; play, to toys, to books, etc.  Her imagination seemed to be put on hold.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Her behavior also changed.  She was suddenly unable to cope with<br/>
everyday<br/>
&gt; &gt; minor things...they&#39;d throw her into a tailspin....she also became<br/>
&gt; &gt; uncooperative (alright, maybe we were asking her to do a chore...).  I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; amazed to see the changes in her and I considered them negative<br/>
&gt; &gt; changes....so soon after we went back to limited video viewing and her<br/>
&gt; &gt; imagination seemed to kick in again.  But, you&#39;re telling me that if she<br/>
&gt; &gt; wants to watch videos, I should let her watch them...all day if that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; she wants....  (Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>
&gt; &gt; behavior....)  And what about the types of videos?  Do I get any say in<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; she watches?  She&#39;s 3 1/2, btw.  And you never ask your kids to pick up<br/>
&gt; &gt; their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?  If DD cuts up a<br/>
&gt; piece<br/>
&gt; &gt; of paper into hundreds of tiny pieces of paper on the dining room floor<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; walks away....can&#39;t I later ask her to pick them up?  Or do I have to<br/>
wait<br/>
&gt; &gt; for &#39;natural&#39; consequences to kick in...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, why is it a bad thing if we grow, raise, purchase, cook, and<br/>
provide<br/>
&gt; &gt; for our family healthy, wholesome, organic foods? I work really hard to<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; &gt; this!   DD usually (unless the day is out of control altogether) gets to<br/>
&gt; &gt; decide what she wants for breakfast, lunch, and snacks from what we have<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the house.  On occasion she decides dinner and/or will make dessert.<br/>
She<br/>
&gt; &gt; has a bagel...everyday almost.  She has grilled cheese....everyday<br/>
almost.<br/>
&gt; &gt; She gets up on the counter and looks in the cabinets or in the fridge<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; snacks/drinks.  She can select anything....all of it is fairly to very<br/>
&gt; &gt; healthy.  She and her dad go for doughnuts on Saturday mornings as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; treat....they also share twizzlers from time to time.  I did restrict<br/>
&gt; &gt; Halloween candy....she could have two pieces after she at her meal<br/>
&lt;gasp!&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; but then the dog ate all the rest so that was that.  We have always<br/>
talked<br/>
&gt; &gt; about healthy v. non healthy foods.  It&#39;s OK to eat non healthy foods,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; not all the time...it&#39;s the healthy foods that help us grow and stay<br/>
fit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It was wrong to say this?  It&#39;s the truth (as I see it...you may<br/>
disagree)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmmmm, I have some difficulty applying unschooling across the board....I<br/>
&gt; &gt; look forward to continuing to &#39;listen&#39; to your conversations....this is<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; so very interesting to me....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Can I stay if I take some and leave some?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Aimee<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;who&#39;s mind is being awakened&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am curious about exactly what real families you know who don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  chores..., etc. do or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you attribute to abandoning parental responsibilities.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious too.  How does having control really make someone a more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsible parent?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Deb L<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, but we are saying the these things don&#39;t cause the problems that parents<br/>
who restrict them fear they will.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of what&#39;s said as a new set of rules, but a new way of living<br/>
with your child. More as her partner in her discovery of the world rather<br/>
than her leader or trainer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are your reasons for having a set bedtime? What do you fear will happen<br/>
if she stays up as late as she wants?<br/>
<br/>
Some parents who like an hour or two alone together in the evening say it<br/>
works well if they suggest a time the kids head to their rooms to read or<br/>
listen to tapes or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
You can suggest it, but I suspect at 3 1/2 she won&#39;t want to be alone.<br/>
<br/>
If you give her freedom, be prepared for her to run wild with it. She&#39;ll<br/>
disregard how tired she is and want to stay up as late as possible. (Same<br/>
with anything that&#39;s been controlled and restricted.) Eventually she&#39;ll get<br/>
back in touch with how her body feels and know she doesn&#39;t have to grasp as<br/>
much night as she can before it&#39;s controlled again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>
&gt; manners, being responsible, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How long does it actually take to learn manners? People seem to think it<br/>
takes 18 full years of training ;-) But if we treat them the way we&#39;d like<br/>
them to treat us and others, then they&#39;ll learn. They&#39;ll want others to feel<br/>
as nice as our being respectful does to them. (It will take some kids longer<br/>
than others.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>
&gt; emotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>
&gt; behavior....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably not the sole cause, but I bet it&#39;s a good part of it. I suspect you<br/>
weren&#39;t as engaged with her as you had been. Kids are sensitive to moods and<br/>
the way they react isn&#39;t necessarily how we expect them to. As others said,<br/>
she was also discovering something new, exploring something heretofor<br/>
restricted. I also remember my daughter at 2 wanted to watch 101 Dalmations<br/>
over and over and over in a day, so there&#39;s the age factor.<br/>
<br/>
But is an adverse reaction really a bad thing? Isn&#39;t that our body&#39;s way of<br/>
talking to us? And isn&#39;t ignoring it part of mastering our bodies? If she<br/>
never gets to experience those feelings how will she learn to recognize it<br/>
when her body is saying it needs a change of pace?<br/>
<br/>
If you see her getting cranky or whatever, you can suggest a new activity<br/>
that&#39;s better than TV like a trip to the playground or the store or doing<br/>
something with you in the house. She may turn it down, but offer<br/>
periodically (not nag) so she has the opportunity to experience how<br/>
something new affects her body. She may need to watch for a while. She may<br/>
need several opportunities doing something different to see the connection.<br/>

think they&#39;d have on her?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter can watch anything she wants and she chooses what interests her<br/>
and what she feels comfortable with which isn&#39;t beyond the bounds of what I<br/>
would have chosen for her. (Well, asthetically speaking I don&#39;t think I&#39;d<br/>
choose Ed, Edd and Eddie ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You, of course, do have a &quot;say&quot; since you won&#39;t be taking her into an adult<br/>
video store to pick something out, but you probably won&#39;t send her down the<br/>
grownup drama aisle either. But not because they would be bad for her but<br/>
just because they&#39;d bore her silly. (Though my daughter was fascinated by<br/>
all 3 hours of Dances with Wolves at 5 or 6 so you never know!)<br/>
<br/>
So your &quot;say&quot; is to help her find the types of things that would interest<br/>
her. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Quite frankly there rarely are natural consequences to the kids for avoiding<br/>
chores. Do kids care if the living room floor can&#39;t be walked through? Do<br/>
they care if the toilet or tub is dirty? Do they care if there aren&#39;t any<br/>
clean dishes in the house? (They&#39;d probably, rightly from their point of<br/>
view, suggest paper plates ;-) From *their* point of view it makes a lot<br/>
more sense if the toys are kept out where they can easily be played with.<br/>
<br/>
Kids *do* have different points of view. The things they care about *are*<br/>
different. We don&#39;t need to train them to care. Time will take care of that<br/>
-- *if* you&#39;re thinking of them taking care of themselves as adults. If<br/>
you&#39;re thinking of them caring about how the house looks, don&#39;t hold your<br/>
breath ;-) We *think* we provide them with a home and they should care about<br/>
it&#39;s upkeep. But we don&#39;t. We provide them with what *we* want to give them.<br/>
It&#39;s ours, not theirs. If it was theirs, they&#39;d get a say in how it was<br/>
decorated and what state of cleanliness (or not) was acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
If you help them pick up, if you ask for help (and allow one of the answers<br/>
to be no thanks without anger), kids will pitch in.<br/>
<br/>
As for their rooms, would you want your daughter deciding when you should<br/>
clean your room and to what state of cleanliness? It might be cute the first<br/>
time ;-) but it would get old pretty quick. Especially if you didn&#39;t see the<br/>
reason for the standards she was imposing. When you feel the urge to clean<br/>
it you can ask her if she doesn&#39;t mind if you straighten up. If she doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to help, I bet she will at least for a while.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, why is it a bad thing if we grow, raise, purchase, cook, and provide<br/>
&gt; for our family healthy, wholesome, organic foods? I work really hard to do<br/>
&gt; this!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s helpful to see this as something you want to give to your<br/>
family not something that they are asking for and must have. They will<br/>
survive on junk. You want to offer take the time and effort to offer them<br/>
something better. If you talk about why you make the choices you do rather<br/>
than why your daughter needs to eat in such and such a way -- as it sounds<br/>
like you do -- then she&#39;ll understand the reasoning behind your choices.<br/>
That won&#39;t necessarily mean she&#39;ll agree for herself. She might need to try<br/>
things out for her self. (That&#39;s the heart of unschooling anyway ;-) But<br/>
there&#39;s a difference between freely exploring and rebelling from control.<br/>
The second is often done not because the child necessarily wants to but just<br/>
because it&#39;s forbidden.<br/>

&gt; unsanitary, are you just going to say, &quot;Oh, he decided he didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to clean up after himself&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is like saying, &quot;what if you let your child play with a ball anytime he<br/>
wanted and he took it and beat the neighbor to death with it?&quot; If that<br/>
happened, it wouldn&#39;t be about the ball or playing therewith.<br/>
<br/>
If a family is waist-deep in filth, I don&#39;t think the cure is assigning a<br/>
chore list with punishments for not doing them.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is portraying their family as Mom and Dad, Serfs and Children, Lords<br/>
of All They Survey. My family helps each other, without the need for rules<br/>
that say to do that. As a family, we all clean some on our own. We&#39;re<br/>
willing to clean or help to clean if another person asks us to.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is neater than the average homeschooling families&#39; I know. This<br/>
isn&#39;t due to anything other than the fact I like to clean. When I&#39;m<br/>
stressed, I&#39;m very likely to organize a drawer or do a load of laundry.<br/>
Creating order in my universe calms me.<br/>
<br/>
But even with that, I know other families who have our basic cleaning<br/>
philosophy and social workers aren&#39;t lining up outside their door.<br/>
<br/>
A toddler will want to get hold of the dishrag, and will be incredibly proud<br/>
of herself when she throws away her first piece of trash. In my experience,<br/>
this desire to be part of the family and do what the rest of the family is<br/>
doing does not wane with age, unless we purposely stamp it out.<br/>

is that she usually does bring her dishes in...almost every night...she<br/>
hasn&#39;t said no in a very long time...and you know what?  Sometimes I don&#39;t<br/>
bring mine in either....I&#39;m so tired, I just wait until morning.  Or I bring<br/>
them in and leave them in the sink until morning....they eventually get<br/>
done.  In our case I don&#39;t think we&#39;d get to social services<br/>
intervening....WAY before that our medium tolerance for crap everywhere<br/>
would have caused us to clean up...or I would step out of unschooling and<br/>
say, &quot;What a minute!!!  I can&#39;t live like this!!!  What can we do?&quot;  I&#39;m<br/>
starting to see that for my family it doesn&#39;t have to be so incredibly<br/>
rigid.  And around here, if I need help with the dishes I get it....  If DH<br/>
needs it with the farm, he gets it... If DD needs it with cleaning up the<br/>
playroom or reading etc. she gets it.  It&#39;s just been working that way.<br/>
<br/>
It is true for me...what someone else said....I did my time leaving other<br/>
people&#39;s messes around waiting for them to clean them up.  I&#39;d just stew and<br/>
stew about it.  If I clean them up or just ASK them to clean them up...well,<br/>
the results have been better.  Or, when someone says &quot;where are the<br/>
scissors?&quot; and we can&#39;t find them....that&#39;s a lesson on it&#39;s own.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yep, it&#39;s a request, and she does once in a while say, &#39;no thank<br/>
&gt; you&#39;, but<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure you can ask, as long as it&#39;s asking and not commanding.<br/>
&gt; Often people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; say ask when they mean command. Asking implies that the answer<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; no...<br/>

&gt; &gt; For clarification sake, what you (the general group, from what I&#39;ve read<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; &gt; far) seem to saying is that I shouldn&#39;t restrict things like TV, junk<br/>
foods,<br/>
&gt; &gt; messiness....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, but we are saying the these things don&#39;t cause the problems that<br/>
parents<br/>
&gt; who restrict them fear they will.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t think of what&#39;s said as a new set of rules, but a new way of living<br/>
&gt; with your child. More as her partner in her discovery of the world rather<br/>
&gt; than her leader or trainer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What are your reasons for having a set bedtime? What do you fear will<br/>
happen<br/>
&gt; if she stays up as late as she wants?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some parents who like an hour or two alone together in the evening say it<br/>
&gt; works well if they suggest a time the kids head to their rooms to read or<br/>
&gt; listen to tapes or whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can suggest it, but I suspect at 3 1/2 she won&#39;t want to be alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you give her freedom, be prepared for her to run wild with it. She&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; disregard how tired she is and want to stay up as late as possible. (Same<br/>
&gt; with anything that&#39;s been controlled and restricted.) Eventually she&#39;ll<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; back in touch with how her body feels and know she doesn&#39;t have to grasp<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; much night as she can before it&#39;s controlled again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>
&gt; &gt; manners, being responsible, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How long does it actually take to learn manners? People seem to think it<br/>
&gt; takes 18 full years of training ;-) But if we treat them the way we&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; them to treat us and others, then they&#39;ll learn. They&#39;ll want others to<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; as nice as our being respectful does to them. (It will take some kids<br/>
longer<br/>
&gt; than others.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>
&gt; &gt; behavior....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Probably not the sole cause, but I bet it&#39;s a good part of it. I suspect<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t as engaged with her as you had been. Kids are sensitive to moods<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the way they react isn&#39;t necessarily how we expect them to. As others<br/>
said,<br/>
&gt; she was also discovering something new, exploring something heretofor<br/>
&gt; restricted. I also remember my daughter at 2 wanted to watch 101<br/>
Dalmations<br/>
&gt; over and over and over in a day, so there&#39;s the age factor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But is an adverse reaction really a bad thing? Isn&#39;t that our body&#39;s way<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; talking to us? And isn&#39;t ignoring it part of mastering our bodies? If she<br/>
&gt; never gets to experience those feelings how will she learn to recognize it<br/>
