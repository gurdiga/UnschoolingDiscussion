&quot;why are so many people (who went through the school system) phobic<br/>
about math?&quot;  My guess is that many people would label themselves as math<br/>
phobic/ can&#39;t do math/don&#39;t get math.  It would be difficult to feel like<br/>
you could introduce math to your children if you feel that way - you won&#39;t<br/>
be able to answer their questions etc, etc.</div>

Phobia&quot;, mainly because she is funny!  How many of us remember &quot;Yours is<br/>
Not to Question Why, just Invert and Multiply!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a wonderful kids&#39; book called &quot;Math Curse&quot; by Jon Scieszka<br/>
and Lane Smith.  Mrs. Fibonnaci puts a curse on one of her students so<br/>
that everything the child looks at or thinks about turns into a math<br/>
problem!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
