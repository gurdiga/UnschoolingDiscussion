 </span></blockquote>As I said in my email to you when you emailed me offlist (which I asked you <br/>
not to do), you are simply not listening and doing the same things you accuse <br/>
others of doing. <br/>
<br/>
You could not get me to see &quot;your way&quot; offlist and so now you try onlist. <br/>
Okay. . .good. . . this is where it belongs as I said to you. I refuse to <br/>
start talking about people offlist as you seem to be intent on doing. Trying <br/>
to get people to take sides with you or Sandra is futile. I disagree with <br/>
Sandra many times. . . just ask her. I have no problem with stating my <br/>
opinion even when it is different from hers. If I perceive an insult from her <br/>
then I have made it my problem.  The way I try to read posts is from the <br/>
standpoint that everyone  is coming from a place of sincerely wanting to help <br/>
and offer viewpoints that they believe may help people. This is what I <br/>
believe to be true of Sandra, even though I may disagree with her on some <br/>
things. This is what I try to believe of everyone on here. <br/>
<br/>
There is a great opportunity here . . . to learn. I, for one, am going to <br/>
focus on that.<br/>
