<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479787789"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: Linda Dobson &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ldobson@...">ldobson@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;FYI.  Preliminary comments are not mine - but could have been...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Linda<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;-----------------------<br/>
&gt;&gt;Thought you all might be interested in checking out an editorial by Jeff<br/>
&gt;&gt;Berry in the recent Creative Loafing <br/>
&gt;&gt;If you have high blood pressure, take care!  Mr. Berry feels<br/>
&gt;&gt;homeschooling should not be legal - and his view of homeschoolers is<br/>
&gt;&gt;unfortunately as limited and uninformed as that of many of our<br/>
&gt;&gt;legislators.  We need better - and more accurate publicity!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok Linda, somebody HAD to do it.  I realize that I am preaching to the<br/>
choir here, but I just HAD to say something about this.<br/>
<br/>
I am incensed!  What is actually funny is how really far off Mr. Berry is<br/>
from the truth.  I realize that editorials are opinion papers, and as such<br/>
he is entitled to his opinion about homeschooling in general.  But I find<br/>
it laughable for him to present his opinion in such a manner as to suggest<br/>
that this is well educated, and well thought out, fact!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...it has become rather fashionable among the conservative kook set...&quot;<br/>
Hmmm....well I guess I should be thankful for Mr. Berry&#39;s enlightenment.<br/>
Here I thought I would be having trouble finding supportive friends in this<br/>
community due to it&#39;s conservative nature, but I guess, according to him I<br/>
must fit right in!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...their youngsters, who are insulated in a loving home far away from<br/>
gangs, violence and people of other races.&quot;<br/>
Again, I must say I find this laughable.  Particularly since the little<br/>
girl we are adopting is AA.  Growing up in the heart of San Francisco, as I<br/>
did, it is almost impossible to not love and partake of a multitude of<br/>
cultural influences, let alone harbor racial prejudice and hatred.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mom occasionally refers the kids to some printed material written by a TV<br/>
evangelist...&quot;<br/>
Well I guess I better learn who these evangelists are and where to find<br/>
their printed word, as I should be utilizing it in my homeschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;...far from the corrupting influences of teachers with college &quot;degrees&quot;<br/>
and people whose religion, race or political ideology may be different from<br/>
their own.&quot;<br/>
Well, I must say they would have to run away from home to get away from<br/>
people with college in their backround.  I am one of the few people in my<br/>
immediate family who does NOT hold one or more degrees (including my<br/>
husband) and I did attend college for 5 years, with a focus the last two on<br/>
elementary education.  That is, until I realized that the kids I really<br/>
wanted to teach were my own future children, and that I was far more<br/>
passionate about that than about teaching in the ps system.  As for the<br/>
other reference to people that are different, all I can say is, there were<br/>
not ENOUGH of them, nor enough education about other lifestyles and<br/>
cultures, in ps to suit my taste and that is also a factor in my<br/>
homeschooling decesion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Removing a child from school is to reject the very basis of human<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;intelligence in an enlightened society. It prevents children from<br/>
&gt;acquiring passable social skills, it deprives them of the opportunity to<br/>
&gt;forge lasting personal relationships, and it causes ignorance and<br/>
&gt;outright stupidity on a grand scale. Home schooling creates an atmosphere<br/>
&gt;of insular paranoia that breeds intolerance and suspicion of people who<br/>
&gt;are different.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That certainly is a violently strong negative opinion he has there.  I<br/>
wonder what happened to him to make him so hateful, paranoid, intolerant<br/>
and suspicious of people who choose to be different?  Well perhaps her<br/>
never acquired those important social skills in Public School or learned to<br/>
be open minded and think for himself.  Then again, he could just be<br/>
ignorant and stupid on a grand scale.<br/>

Exactly!  For this reason, I deliberately deleted that piece.  I see no <br/>
reason to waste my valuable time, let alone my equilibrium over someone who <br/>
is stupid and ignorant!  Hey guys! Reading and debating this type of tripe is <br/>
like watching wrestleling, it is all contrived to pull your chain.!<br/>

Anyway, I said all that at the onset of the message.  I did choose my forum<br/>
however, as a friendly one.  I was obviously not debating the issue, as<br/>
none of you would take his side.  It was meant more as a joke really, a<br/>
comment on how very pitiful he is, than anything else.<br/>

Nanci,<br/>
I know that you weren&#39;t debating, I am sorry if you misunderstood me.  I <br/>
meant, I can&#39;t even read those kinds of things cause they make me so mad and <br/>
so frustrated cause I can&#39;t do anything about it, just like I get mad at <br/>
wrestling.  Sorry to have worded it to where it sounded the other way.<br/>
