<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The truth is we approach handwriting by using the computer.  My son&#39;s <br/>
handwriting is actually fine,  but he has some perfectionist tendencies <br/>
and hates his writing.  He doesn&#39;t like to do a lot of writing,  but <br/>
he does write thank you letters, etc. on the computer.  He handwrites <br/>
his role-playing stuff but that doesn&#39;t seem to bother him because <br/>
it&#39;s just for him.  I wonder if  learning  cursive may be outdated.  <br/>
Some kids love it (my daughter did),  but if not, do they really need <br/>
it.  Most of us eventually come up with our own print/cursive combo, <br/>
and most writing other than some personal letters is now done on the<br/>
computer. <br/>

I don&#39;t have much to offer you on the subject of handwriting, in fact I&#39;ll<br/>
listen to what does come through with interest as my son has a small motor<br/>
problem.  ....But I can tell you that a good friend of mine runs a web site<br/>
for work at home moms and it is the portal, so to speak, for those women and<br/>
for women who need or want to find some work at home opportunities or ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719454237">Leave it be.  When they get to the point where it is important for them they<br/>
will learn it.  My daughter works on her signature because she has now had<br/>
occasion to use it but handwriting eh? who really needs it much these<br/>
days...really?  Our six year old copies letters all the time though she can&#39;t<br/>
read much at all.  Her sister never copied letters, hand writes poorly and<br/>
reads years beyond her age. Handwriting is, in fact,  a great place to drive<br/>
everyone totally nuts. Many a happy learner has been made miserable by well<br/>
intentioned &quot;teachers&quot; putting pressure on them.   Leave it be.  This is of<br/>
course very much from the unschooling perspective.<br/>
