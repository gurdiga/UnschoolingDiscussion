<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322358899">Lots of good recommendations on constipation - it seems to be a<br/>
common thing for little girls.  When we were dealing with it with<br/>

poop.&quot;  A reminder was all that was needed usually.<br/>

| Hi,<br/>
| I am fairly new to the digest... have been lurking about a<br/>
month or so,<br/>
| trying to get a feel for &quot;you&quot;.<br/>
| We live in the Des Moines, Iowa area.  (I noticed there is a<br/>
Des Moines, WA<br/>
| :-)<br/>
| We have two kids ages 9 (boy) and 3 (girl).<br/>
|<br/>
| I am a public school teacher.  (Thus, we keep ours at home..<br/>
:-)<br/>
| I found the comment interesting about children getting along<br/>
better with<br/>
| public kids.  We have found just the opposite with our son.  He<br/>
can&#39;t stand<br/>
| so many of the public kids rude language and lack of manners.<br/>
Not to say<br/>
| that kids staying home don&#39;t have that too, but we must train<br/>
them, right?<br/>
|<br/>
| A question?<br/>
| Any one have a remedy for constipation and irregularity for our<br/>
3 yr. old<br/>
| daughter?<br/>
| She eats like a bird too.  We&#39;ve tried pears; she gets burned<br/>
out on them.<br/>
| Applesauce seems to constipate her.. odd huh?<br/>
| Any ideas would be appreciated.<br/>
|<br/>
| Thanks for the neat ideas and suggestions.<br/>
| I love the hula hoop &quot;game&quot;  :-)<br/>
| I need to try that one with myself and in the school classroom.<br/>
(I use some<br/>
| unschooling approaches at school too.)<br/>
|<br/>
| Take care!<br/>
