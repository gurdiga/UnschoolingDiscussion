<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Keiran has never been very interested<br/>
&gt; in art so sometimes I offer but he always turns me down.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I dare you to consider playing with your food art, and see if he&#39;d turn you<br/>
down!  At 5, Tim hated to color with crayons, thought coloring books were<br/>
totally stupid, and refused to bother making a craft that somebody else had<br/>
designed.  <br/>
<br/>
However, we&#39;ve spent many a fun day decorating sugar cookies with<br/>
wild-colored frostings (make them yourself with food coloring and canned<br/>
frosting, the experimenting is fun) and playing with spray cheese and egg<br/>
salad, our two favorite sandwich &quot;paints&quot;.  Oh, and gingerbread houses at<br/>
Christmas are great art projects.  Just don&#39;t call them that!<br/>
<br/>
We also made pretzel letters one day.  I make salt-dough clay and he models<br/>
with it, and he loved ooblik.  Let me know if you need recipes, I can<br/>
probably dig them out of someplace.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t push, he&#39;ll come when he&#39;s ready.  If you want to instill a love of<br/>
literature, love it yourself.  Listen to books out loud yourself.  You don&#39;t<br/>
have to make him do it, you know.  Maybe he&#39;d listen at bedtime?<br/>
