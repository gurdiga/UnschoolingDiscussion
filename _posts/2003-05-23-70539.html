<div id="ygrps-yiv-448765448">Hi.<br/>
I am new to this list, have been unschooling for almost 12 years. Actually<br/>
12 1/2, but I didn&#39;t know what it was the fist six months of my oldest son&#39;s<br/>
life :o)<br/>
I am finding this thread really interesting, as I was just thinking about<br/>
this the other day.<br/>
I was thinking about the draft and wondering why it is assumed at 18 all<br/>
boys are fit (emotionally or otherwise) to go into the military. Why is that<br/>
a magical number at which time you throw your kids out, they are all of a<br/>
sudden grown up???<br/>
My kids are 12 1/2 ds, 10 ds, 8 ds, 6 ds, and 2 dd. We do different things<br/>
at different milestones. At 10 we take just the birthday kid to the Fort.<br/>
It&#39;s up in the mts., they have buffalo prime rib, really nice. At 13 we are<br/>
creating a bday book. We have written to family, friends, famous people,<br/>
etc. and asked them to contribute stories, pictures, recipes, words of<br/>
wisdom. We will give it to our kids with the understanding that they can<br/>
share or not as they choose. Sometimes grandparents can be pushy. I am not<br/>
sure about 16, 18, or 21. We are still working on those. What have you all<br/>
done?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that anyone assumes they are. I suspect it was chosen because<br/>
it&#39;s the age when most are done with high school and before too many of them<br/>
have started families.<br/>
<br/>
And if they aren&#39;t done with high school, then, the thinking may have gone,<br/>
the military might be a better use of their time.<br/>
