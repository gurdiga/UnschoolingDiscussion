<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093207669">Ok,  I was just on unschooling.com and saw another Kelli posting things and it wasn&#39;t me.  Weird!   Maybe I better say Kelli T.?  Does anyone know the Kelli that posted on &#39;Boy that wouldn&#39;t leave the park&#39; on 9/7?  Hopefully she has a different last initial!  <br/>
<br/>
Kelli T.  who thought her name was original enough to not worry about this kind-of thing.<br/>
