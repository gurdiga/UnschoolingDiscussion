I&#39;m so sorry that happens.  I feel like you in that what is important to me<br/>
is the people - especially my own family!  I remember years ago we went to<br/>
my BIL&#39;s for Christmas.  They had a lot of the family staying with them, so<br/>
not enough beds for everyone.  My SIL thought we would be more comfortable<br/>
at a house, in beds, fewer sharing the bathroom, etc., so she had us stay at<br/>
the house of one of their friend&#39;s.  It was like a mansion to us, very<br/>
luxurious, but I was afraid of the children touching anything.  The worst<br/>
part of it was that our family felt left out, like from late night,<br/>
sit-around discussions and other little things that mean so much in making<br/>
memories.  My husband especialy wanted to stay up late and talk to his<br/>
brother and mom, whom he only saw about once a year.  So even though my SIL<br/>
did it for really kind reasons, plus some practical such as the bathroom<br/>
needs, it left us feeling outside the group.  We would much rather have just<br/>
slept on the floor of the den in sleeping bags.   But not everyone is like<br/>
that.  I don&#39;t think my in-laws would enjoy it if that&#39;s what we offered<br/>
them when they came to visit us. Actually, except for one time that they<br/>
spent the night with us and slept on a hide-a-bed, they always stayed with<br/>
their friends who had really big houses with lots of extra bedroom space.<br/>
Oh, well.  It&#39;s not always even a clean house, but sometimes just<br/>
expectations of comfort that put barriers between people and how they choose<br/>
to live.  I&#39;d rather have space on a couch (I can&#39;t do the floor very well<br/>
anymore) and stay at someone&#39;s home than to be away and miss out on spending<br/>
time together.  That&#39;s how my children are, too, and I&#39;m really thankful.<br/>
