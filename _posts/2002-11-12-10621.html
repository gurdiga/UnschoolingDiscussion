Yes, I am very lucky to be alive and even luckier to even walk (errr<br/>
hobble) away from the accident (seat belts are a wounderful thing).  I did<br/>
not understand, until I actually saw the car yesterday, why all the<br/>
emergency personel kept asking me in total disbelief and amazement, &quot;You<br/>
walk away from that?&quot;  The passenger side (the entire side) was totally<br/>
caved in, for which I am grateful that I did not have a passenger with me<br/>
(a passenger would not have survived.)  I am also grateful that the driver<br/>
of the other car (no passengers either) was not injured.<br/>
<br/>
I managed to only receive some cracked ribs, a broken left wrist and<br/>
damaged left knee.  The knee damage includes a chip fracture and possible<br/>
torn ACL.  I will get an MRI on my knee on Wednesday to determine the<br/>
extent of the musscle damage as well as a CAT scan on thr wrist to see if<br/>
it needs pinned.  I will know on Friday if I need any surgery.<br/>
<br/>
Nanci is holding up very well considering how my stupidity brought me so<br/>
close to death.  I do suspect that she will need a much deserved break<br/>
when things start to settle down some.  Now, back to my regularly<br/>
scheduled lurking.<br/>
