<div id="ygrps-yiv-858483459">I would hate it if Sandra left this list. Her advice and examples <br/>
from her family&#39;s unschooling life have been of enormous help to me. <br/>
As she has said many and many and many a time, please let&#39;s discuss <br/>
unschooling and get away from personalities. Which is what she has <br/>
done. When a person comes on here and says she is an unschooler, but <br/>
requires a small amount of schoolwork, and Sandra among others says, <br/>
no that&#39;s not unschooling, then that is not attacking the person, <br/>
that is discussing unschooling and what it is and isn&#39;t. And it&#39;s <br/>
happened with lots of other people who&#39;ve joined the list with <br/>
similar views of unschooling and how you can be an unschooler but <br/>
still require math/writing/reading/whatever. Some of them have <br/>
learned a lot from such discussions and have changed how they <br/>
homeschool because of the discussions. But when the person who got <br/>
that pointed out to her then gets a big chip on her shoulder and <br/>
spends the next two months saying how she&#39;s been attacked on every <br/>
issue discussed and mentions Sandra&#39;s name over and over, ad nauseum, <br/>
that&#39;s focusing on personality. There is a difference. <br/>
