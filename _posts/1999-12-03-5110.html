<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102987037">The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), located in Virginia,<br/>
has notified Loving Education at Home (LEAH) and New York Home<br/>
Educators&#39; Network (NYHEN) that it &quot;desires to make some changes to the<br/>
home school law of New York.&quot; At the same time, HSLDA attorney Dewitt<br/>
Black rightfully notes, &quot;It is always difficult to bring about a<br/>
favorable change in a home school law even with unity within the home<br/>
school community, but it will be virtually impossible to get a change in<br/>
the law if we are divided.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    NYHEN is making available a listserve so that New York homeschoolers<br/>
can discuss this issue. If we are divided, we could potentially wind up<br/>
with worse regulations during this current climate of increasing testing<br/>
and accountability.  Should the regulations be opened up?  Is this the<br/>
right time? Is legislative relief the right avenue?  What is the history<br/>
of New York homeschooling&#39;s regulations? There are many questions to<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
    NYHEN is happy to offer this forum to New York homeschoolers and<br/>
other interested parties.  Please join in the discussion and have your<br/>
voice heard.  To join, send a blank email message to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onelist.com/community/NY-alert.">http://www.onelist.com/community/NY-alert.</a> You will receive a welcome<br/>
message with instructions on how to post. There is absolutely no cost to<br/>
join.  Your input is vitally important to the future of New York<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Linda Dobson<br/>
Coordinator, New York Home Educators&#39; Network</div>
