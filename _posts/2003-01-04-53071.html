&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good point!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (And I want to generalize here, without picking on Tia.  Please excuse<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me.)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re excused.  &lt;g&gt; I actually agree with you, Betsy.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to point out that I wasn&#39;t being critical of Teresa for asking a<br/>
question.  What I saw in her post was something that we seem to get every<br/>
couple of months here.  Someone relatively new here, who has already made<br/>
some comments about the tone of this list, trying to draw an even newer<br/>
member (or in this case a returning member) into agreeing with their<br/>
complaints about the tone, about the so-called in group, the so-called<br/>
rules.  That&#39;s what *I* heard in Teresa&#39;s comments and question.  If that<br/>
wasn&#39;t her intent, then I apologize.  If it was, I&#39;d like to know why she<br/>
thinks this list should change to suit the newer members when it seems to<br/>
suit something like a thousand people quite well.<br/>
There are people on all my lists whose posts I don&#39;t care for.  I either<br/>
skip their posts or read and then ignore them.  Those people&#39;s posts might<br/>
be just the thing someone else needs.  Who am I to say they shouldn&#39;t post<br/>
or should post differently?<br/>
I&#39;m one of those who found Sandra&#39;s post off-putting when I first joined.  I<br/>
even left for a while.  But I came back because those posts from Sandra, and<br/>
a number of others, turned out to be exactly what I needed to read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671658123">Tia, that was very well stated.<br/>
I just wish we could get back to talking about unschooling (again!) instead <br/>
of what this list should be.<br/>

Thank you for saying this Tia.  I have done exactly the same thing on a<br/>
few different occasions, left because I disagreed or my feelings were<br/>
hurt.  But I always come back because I need this list.  Of all the<br/>
unschooling lists I belong to this is my favorite, people are smart,<br/>
willing to discuss just about anything, and don&#39;t put up with bulls**t.<br/>
I like that.  Keep it up.<br/>
