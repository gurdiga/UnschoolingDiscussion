Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  They were beautiful....sometimes we are so <br/>
busy for whatever reason, we forget to recognize the everyday mircles we have <br/>
right at our finger tips.  Thanks for helping us remember the simply things.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Oh, so grateful...<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, 24 May 2000 13:47:13 EDT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dear Friends,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I started my morning with some bad news.  I found out that the daughter <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;a woman on another list I belong to just died after fighting a hard cancer<br/>
&gt;battle since the beginning of the year.  She was only eight years old.  <br/>
&gt;This<br/>
&gt;hit me pretty hard because I am coming up on three years since the <br/>
&gt;diagnosis<br/>
&gt;of my own breast cancer.  I sat in the computer room, staring out the <br/>
&gt;window,<br/>
&gt;wondering why I am still here when this precious soul, who barely had a<br/>
&gt;chance to taste life, is gone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    As I sat by the window thinking, and admiring what promises to be a<br/>
&gt;beautiful spring day, I noticed kids gathering at the bus stop.  I started<br/>
&gt;thinking how different my morning would be if I had to get my son off to<br/>
&gt;school.  I went back upstairs to snuggle with Colton, who had migrated from<br/>
&gt;his bed to mine.  We were joined by our troublemaker Boo Cat, and my sweet<br/>
&gt;Anya, the happiest dog in the world.  My son and I played with the animals<br/>
&gt;and talked about everything and nothing for a solid half hour.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Colton was able to linger over a breakfast of strawberry toast and a<br/>
&gt;blackberry shake while I read to him from one of the books in the Redwall<br/>
&gt;series.  Our plans for the rest of the day will probably include pouring <br/>
&gt;over<br/>
&gt;the new dinosaur books we picked up at the library yesterday, playing some<br/>
&gt;math games, a LOT more reading, and a long bike ride.  What luxury!  What a<br/>
&gt;gift!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Cancer taught me a valuable lesson.  I learned to live my life with<br/>
&gt;boundless enthusiasm, loving my family and friends with reckless abandon.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;learned that so many things I used to think were important just don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;matter.<br/>
&gt;  These are a few of the things that DO: Sitting with Colton for twenty<br/>
&gt;minutes while we watch a bird take a bath in the water that drips from our<br/>
&gt;picnic table.  Answering the phone to discover it&#39;s my husband, taking a<br/>
&gt;moment from his busy day to call and say he loves me.  Laughing with my<br/>
&gt;family until tears run down our cheeks and our sides ache.  Taking the time<br/>
&gt;to really listen when Colton wants to tell me more information about <br/>
&gt;Pokemon.<br/>
&gt;  Taking my husband&#39;s hand when we walk together.  Telling my son I am so<br/>
&gt;happy to be his mom.  This is all holy ground.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Life is so fragile and fleeting, but at the same time it is achingly<br/>
&gt;beautiful.  I am grateful that I now see the world with new eyes, that I <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;found the sacred in the mundane.  Yes, there are heartbreaks and difficult<br/>
&gt;valleys we must walk.  But all along the path, there are blessings that <br/>
&gt;move<br/>
&gt;me to tears.  I plan to seek them out and revel in them.  Drink deeply of<br/>
&gt;life, my friends, and go give someone you love a hug.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Blessings,<br/>
&gt;Carol<br/>
<br/>
