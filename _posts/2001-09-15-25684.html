&lt;&lt; Also, our local homeschool group is SO <br/>
 school-at-home oriented and when I go around them, I find myself tending to <br/>
 be really anxious and look for<br/>
 a curriculum.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have trouble fitting into our local HS group myself. They all do school <br/>
at home and 99% are Christian. I am neither a Christian nor a school at homer <br/>
(my own word ;o) ) I have been left alone ablout my choice in unschooling but <br/>
I do feel the pressure or whatever the vibe is. I think they know I am not <br/>
Christian. Children of 5 don&#39;t watch what they say YKWIM. <br/>
<br/>
   Basically we just do normal day to day stuff and learning happens every <br/>
day. I answer questions and such and it just happens.<br/>

local group.  But how DO you find local unschoolers?  I am on a local list <br/>
that is suppsed to be for homeschoolers and unschoolers alike but it only <br/>
seems to be homeschoolers. And why is unschooling so scary to some people <br/>
anyway?  I know what you mean - they dont mess with me about unschooling but <br/>
I see this funny look in their eye when I mention it.  I dont know if it is <br/>
fear......or maybe they are just not familiar with it. That could be it.  <br/>
Well, if they let me stay in long enough, maybe I can unlearn enough so that <br/>
some of them will want to unschool too!<br/>
