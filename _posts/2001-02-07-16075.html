<div id="ygrps-yiv-965546639">My 8 year old went to kindergarten, and one of the things she hated the most<br/>
was that they gave them 25 minutes to each lunch AND have recess.  She never<br/>
had enough time and always got a stomach ache.  Also, the noise level in the<br/>
cafeteria was unbelievable. As for the bus, I drove her to school, but on<br/>
the days we went on field trips I was horrified by the bad driving that went<br/>
on, as well as the things that go on behind those seats (one little girl had<br/>

It sounds like you already have some great ideas. We don&#39;t have this problem, <br/>
since Melina went to school through second grade, she remembers well what it <br/>
was like. Maybe you could play school with her for a few days, complete with <br/>
hand raising, requests to go to the bathroom, scheduled times to eat and <br/>
learn things.<br/>
<br/>
Does she want to eat lunch at school and ride the bus to have those <br/>
experiences, or does she want to spend that time with her friends? Maybe you <br/>
two could volunteer to go to the school and help with some project and she <br/>
could have the chance to see it from the inside and maybe even stay for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

I wonder if your daughter knows that you realy dont get that much <br/>
time to &#39;play&#39; with friends at school, and friends do tend to fall <br/>
out and play with other children more at school than at home.<br/>
Riding the school bus can be very scary.  It was on the school bus <br/>
that my dd would get bullied (OK we are talking middle school here.  <br/>
Perhaps its not as bad at primary school level). <br/>
Lesson time is so short when you are doing something you like and so <br/>
long when you are doing something you hate...........  and on those <br/>
beautiful summer days when you could be sat outside reading a book - <br/>
you are stuck in a class room.<br/>
Of course your dd wont understand this and perhaps she does have to <br/>
experience it first hand to appreciate what she has now......... <br/>

<br/>
My two oldest did go to kindergarten and riding the bus was initially <br/>
a big deal.  They both ended up asking me to drive them to/from <br/>
school daily.  My son had a really bad experience on the bus (being <br/>
put on the wrong one, the school not knowing where he was, the <br/>
teacher saying it was his fault, etc.).  At the beginning of this <br/>
school year my daughter said she was going to miss being at the bus <br/>
stop with her friends (go figure), so I let her wake up and go to the <br/>
bus stop & she only did this once (wasn&#39;t as thrilling as she <br/>
thought).<br/>
<br/>
This whole school year I&#39;ve let my children call their friends after <br/>
school periodically only for them to find that their friends can&#39;t <br/>
play after school due to lots of homework, chores or activities.  <br/>
They do call my children when they CAN play, though.  So the kiddies <br/>
have seen first hand that their ps counterparts are not having all of <br/>
this fun after school.  I&#39;ve had the parents of these ps children <br/>
call to apologize and to complain to me about how their children <br/>
really don&#39;t get to have &quot;fun&quot; after school and how much homework <br/>
their children get (poor kids!).  The other parents and myself make a <br/>
good effort to get the kids together when they can though (usually <br/>
weekends).<br/>
<br/>
Also, the big question that I get from, I think, every ps mom that I <br/>
know is, &quot;How can you stand being with your children 24/7?&quot;.  I want <br/>
to reply, &quot;How can you stand NOT being with your children all day?&quot;, <br/>
but I don&#39;t.  I had a lot of this during and after winter break!  <br/>
When pushed, I usually, briefly, respond by saying that we do not <br/>
recreate a classroom environment at home and that my children are <br/>
very independent throughout the day (hence, mom&#39;s computer time <br/>
here!).  A whole lifestyle is very hard to explain to anyone (why do <br/>
I have to explain myself anyways?)  How many of you have asked other <br/>
parents how they can send their kids to school or questioned their <br/>
decision to send them?  Just wondering...</div>

situation.  They thought that was great (although the bus was full of <br/>
families, and not kids-only).  I took them some places on the city bus, took <br/>
a lunch--went downtown on outings.  After just  a couple of these, they <br/>
didn&#39;t want to ride the bus anymore.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  How many of you have asked other <br/>
parents how they can send their kids to school or questioned their <br/>
decision to send them? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We do that just by not sending ours.<br/>
When someone tells me one of their kids has to go home, or go to bed, or <br/>
whatever &quot;because tomorrow&#39;s a school day&quot; and I just gaze at them, that&#39;s <br/>
all the reminder they need that &quot;school day&quot; doesn&#39;t exist at my house and <br/>
they just took their kid away from a truly enriching situation for the <br/>
purpose of (at worst) following a schedule-rule, or (at best) helping them be <br/>
well-prepared for six hours of less enriching activities the next day.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago there were about ten other kids my kids&#39; age within an eight-house <br/>
stretch of the neighborhood.  It was great, and one of the best parts was <br/>
those kids went to four different elementaries (five, if our homeschooling <br/>
was counted), so their relationships in the neighborhood were smoother and <br/>
more even than if most had gone to one school.  Sometimes my kids would get <br/>
up early and walk some of them the five or six blocks to school (and some <br/>
went to a school across a major road, by request of the mom, and there was a <br/>
Catholic parochial school for two girls, and the boy on the other side went <br/>
to a Christian academy--quite the assortment!).  They did it fewer than half <br/>
a dozen times, I think, mostly because the walk back was boring.  I reminded <br/>
them that at least they didn&#39;t have to stay all day against  their will and <br/>
THEN walk back!<br/>

<br/>
I do this every time a parent complains about having to turn in early or <br/>
revolve around someone else&#39;s schedule; or about their child&#39;s teacher, <br/>
homework load, classmates, etc., which is quite often. When I sit at the dojo <br/>
waiting for my daughter&#39;s class to end, I hear this talk all the time. (A few <br/>
years ago I was the main one complaining, although I dare say I was active in <br/>
trying to make changes.)<br/>
<br/>
The dojo is a particularly good example because there are four or five <br/>
homeschooling families there, including the former owner and his son who is <br/>
one of the senseis. Homeschooling doesn&#39;t feel like an oddity there. Some of <br/>
the of moms (all SAHMs) go on about how good we hsers have it but they have <br/>
the usual reasons why they can&#39;t homeschool. <br/>
<br/>
Their kid would hate it. They don&#39;t have the patience. The kid is gifted and <br/>
needs special instruction. The kid needs to be socialized. You&#39;ve heard them <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
I just let them know that if they ever change their minds, I have lots of <br/>
resources. I try to avoid being too pushy or judgmental because I don&#39;t want <br/>
to create an us v. them situation, but I am unashamedly overflowing with the <br/>
joys of our lifestyle.<br/>

They do call my children when they CAN play, though. <br/>
So the kiddies <br/>
have seen first hand that their ps counterparts are not <br/>
having all of <br/>
this fun after school. I&#39;ve had the parents of these <br/>
ps children <br/>
call to apologize and to complain to me about how their <br/>
children <br/>
really don&#39;t get to have &quot;fun&quot; after school and how <br/>
much homework <br/>
their children get (poor kids!). The other parents and <br/>
myself make a <br/>
good effort to get the kids together when they can <br/>
though (usually <br/>
weekends).<br/>
<br/>
Also, the big question that I get from, I think, every <br/>
ps mom that I <br/>
know is, &quot;How can you stand being with your children <br/>
24/7?&quot;. I want <br/>
to reply, &quot;How can you stand NOT being with your <br/>
children all day?&quot;, <br/>
but I don&#39;t. I had a lot of this during and after <br/>
winter break! <br/>
When pushed, I usually, briefly, respond by saying that <br/>
we do not <br/>
recreate a classroom environment at home and that my <br/>
children are <br/>
very independent throughout the day (hence, mom&#39;s <br/>
computer time <br/>
here!). A whole lifestyle is very hard to explain to <br/>
anyone (why do <br/>
I have to explain myself anyways?) How many of you <br/>
have asked other <br/>
parents how they can send their kids to school or <br/>
questioned their <br/>
decision to send them? Just wondering...</div>
