<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420171035">I&#39;m on a roll with posting tonight. Thoughts keep popping and I need to express them.<br/>
<br/>
My mother and her husband are here from out of town to be with us over the weekend. <br/>
They&#39;ve been very supportive of all our parenting choices all along. When we switched over <br/>
to unschooling, my mom was curious in that wonderfully supportive way. (I&#39;m lucky.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, today she told me how much she saw the wisdom of this kind of educational <br/>
philosophy and how it was impacting her grandparenting. She found herself really paying <br/>
attention to the unique ways our kids express themselves and then thinking how she and <br/>
her husband could fit in to who they are.<br/>
<br/>
One funny example of how this worked itself out. My 8 yr old daughter decorated her <br/>
granddad with all kinds of objects (leaves, a blanket, a hair brush, a dog chew toy, etc.) to <br/>
create a &quot;human collage.&quot; My mom laughed because she said that she and her husband <br/>
had talked about letting the kids have their way with them and not being fussy old people. <br/>
Thisw was a surprising manifestation of that commitment! <br/>
<br/>
It was such a magical picture to watch emerge. My step dad sat quietly while my daughter <br/>
worked her art on him. They didn&#39;t need to talk. They just needed to connect and the <br/>
grandpa acted as a willing human canvas. We took photographs at the end.<br/>
<br/>
That picture of supportive creativity spoke to me. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, I&#39;ve noticed, creates optimism. We see good in the natural bent of our <br/>
children. We affirm that good and look for ways to support and enhance it. There is space <br/>
for their quirks and gifts and we say yes to them.<br/>
<br/>
I told my husband tonight that what I value most about the women on this list is their <br/>
unflappable faith in their kids. It&#39;s just so nice to be a part of a group who think their kids <br/>
are cool and capable and interesting. <br/>
