<div id="ygrps-yiv-589227997">Hello everyone! I need someone to put a lot of favorite songs onto less <br/>
than a dozen blank cds or one mp3 disk. Some cds are from the library <br/>
and there is a wait on a few of them. I&#39;ll pay you $40 plus provide all <br/>
the blank cds. We live in Tualatin. Thanks!<br/>
