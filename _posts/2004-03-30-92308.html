<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166148981">This is from a mom on the message boards. I know there is a mom here who also <br/>

My husband died one month ago, and I go to work in two weeks. Basically, I&#39;m <br/>
feeling pretty miserable, and it&#39;s only natural-but it&#39;s not just my dh&#39;s <br/>
death that is wearing on me. It&#39;s the fact that my family&#39;s way of life is being <br/>
threatened. Family-they love me-but they have no faith in me whatsoever it <br/>
seems like. Only if I say that dh and I had made such and such decision before he <br/>
died is my opinion respected. I&#39;m really starting to get pissed off about it. <br/>
<br/>
I think you will all be pleased and maybe even proud to know I&#39;m standing <br/>
firm on the unschooling/homeschooling choice we made years ago. I gave my parents <br/>
a piece of my mind when they began to push too hard. There are other family <br/>
members who are watching closely and speculating openly. I wish they&#39;d shut the <br/>
hell up. <br/>
<br/>
I know single parents homeschool, I just don&#39;t know any who do. Are you out <br/>
there? This a new path I&#39;m treading, a new role-widow, single, career mom and I <br/>
don&#39;t want to lose that old, comfy role of homeschooler. References, <br/>
resources, anecdotes, opinions...all are welcome. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802709369">I&#39;ve never found any single-parent specific homeschooling stuff... I <br/>
know there are a couple of us who hang out at the Mothering <br/>
discussion boards and here ... We&#39;re an incredibly tiny percentage, <br/>
even more so as unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
I know this is kind of mixing topics, but I doubt a *single <br/>
parenting* forum is appropriate for someone who is so freshly <br/>
grieving (even when available).  If only because the difference <br/>
between someone *dying* and someone *leaving* is incredibly acute at <br/>
this point in the journey (even if the grieving process is the same, <br/>
it doesn&#39;t *feel* the same to someone who has been widowed).  <br/>
<br/>
I posted for Jenny & am sending lots of strength and peace her way.  <br/>
<br/>
~diana, <br/>
Living proof that today&#39;s mighty oak is yesterday&#39;s nut who stood her <br/>
ground!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98013293">I&#39;ve been on a couple of single-parent homeschool lists, but haven&#39;t <br/>
found them very useful. They tend to be low-traffic and mostly <br/>
curriculum-oriented. Questions of particular concern to single moms tend <br/>
to be very individual, like what kind of work to do and what to do about <br/>
child care, and the members aren&#39;t numerous enough on these boards to <br/>
provide much overview.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling board and this list are probably better options, since <br/>
they&#39;re relatively high traffic and populated by mostly like-minded <br/>
people whose options are more likely to mesh.<br/>
