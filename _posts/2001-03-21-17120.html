<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699949716">It just takes some time to gain confidence..I agree with reading as many of<br/>
the wonderful &#39;unschooing&#39; type books that you can get your hands on.<br/>
&quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith is a one of my favorites. Also<br/>
on the unschoolers web page..read all of Sandra Dodd&#39;s essays...there is<br/>
tons of info and encouragement in the archives too!<br/>
<br/>
My girls are 16, 10 and 5yrs old. We have been learning at home for 8yrs<br/>
now. Sometimes they are very busy with projects and ideas, and sometimes<br/>
they don&#39;t seem to be doing much of anything. They learn in spurts and<br/>
starts and stops..the same as I do.<br/>
<br/>
Your girls are so young yet, just give them time to play, takes lots of<br/>
walks outdoors, trips to the library and bookstores, craft and hobby<br/>
shops..they will find things that they are interested in believe me!<br/>
<br/>
As far as handling the relatives.. I just didn&#39;t share allot about our<br/>
personal lives with the ones that weren&#39;t supportive..at least not in the<br/>
beginning. Now they are all used to how we do things, and my kids are living<br/>
proof that &#39;unschooling&#39; does work.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Hello<br/>
&gt;I am in Rhode Island and have 2 terrific daughters (8 and 5) and we<br/>
&gt;have been officially unschooling since Jan.  Because I have some mild<br/>
&gt;opposition and also some family members that ask &quot;what did you DO in<br/>
&gt;school today?&quot;  and because I haven&#39;t been doing this for long...I<br/>
&gt;suppose I am not as secure as I&#39;d like to be.<br/>
&gt;My oldest lacks that persistent intrest driven motivation that I keep<br/>
&gt;hearing about...she is kinda wishy-washy about her likes and has<br/>
&gt;trouble making up her mind.<br/>
&gt;I try to guide her now and then with suggestions and support but she<br/>
&gt;is a tuff one --- We have tried classes that interest her, but she<br/>
&gt;usually ends up not wanting to go any more.<br/>
&gt;Sorry so long...anyone out there have a success story to a great kid<br/>
&gt;like this ?   Any suggestions ?<br/>
&gt;Thanks ! </span></blockquote></div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I am in Southern Jefferson County, Missouri.  Where<br/>
are you located maybe we could get together for a<br/>
field trip or something. If we are even remotely close<br/>
geographically. I just pulled my kids out of public<br/>
school in January so we are very new to all of this.<br/>
Most of the time we just &quot;wing it&quot;<br/>
