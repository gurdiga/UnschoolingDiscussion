<div id="ygrps-yiv-621798360">Hi,<br/>
I divorced my first husband when our daughter was 11 months old. Since then<br/>
I have had three more wonderful children but have chosen not to marry again<br/>
or even live with a man again!<br/>
At this time in my life, my family is complete the way we are!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Brooke</div>
