<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; NOT ONCE has any of my employers or clients asked, &quot;Do you<br/>
&gt; have a degree?&quot; (This always amazes me actually.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I run into this all the time.  I teach music lessons (violin, viola, cello,<br/>
bass, and beginning piano).<br/>
<br/>
I get referrals from schools, music stores, and other people who know I<br/>
teach.  Most of those folks know I teach because I told them so.  Some of<br/>
them *may* have heard me play one of those instruments.<br/>
<br/>
The two questions parents ask when they call is, &quot;Do you have room for<br/>
another student&quot;, and &quot;What times to you have available?&quot;.  I&#39;ve had maybe<br/>
five people *ever* ask for my credentials.  I&#39;ve been teaching for 17 years;<br/>
over half my life. <br/>
<br/>
Fact is, I have great credentials.  I can do what I say I do, I have<br/>
reasonable success as a teacher, and I&#39;m not a child abuser. .  BUT NOBODY<br/>
ASKS!!!  I think it&#39;s wierd, and a bit frightening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732777097">I just wanted to put in my 2 cents about having a degree.  <br/>
Although I don&#39;t plan on using my master&#39;s in Ed anytime in the near (or far <br/>
actually) future... it does give me an option of a career if our family <br/>
situation ever changes and I need to find good employment that would (barely) <br/>
support us.   And it&#39;s at least a career that allows time off at holidays, out of <br/>
work by 2:00 every day(school starts early here), and summer home with the <br/>
family.  <br/>
btw, most of our course work in Ed was about paperwork, classroom management, <br/>
and lesson plans.  Never actually learned how to &quot;teach&quot; anything anyways, <br/>
that stuff is common sense.  Also, that woman might not of had to leave her <br/>
child in daycare to get the degree.  I did mine at night, it took 2 years part <br/>
time of 1-2 nights a week.  Seems most grad classes around here aren&#39;t in a <br/>
typical all day M-F setting like undergrad.   <br/>
I wonder what she would think if she knew how much we&#39;ve been discussing <br/>
this?  Now that would be interesting for a thesis.<br/>

I wish!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there was objection to college degrees in general, just to the <br/>
idea that getting a master&#39;s degree in education so that one could homeschool <br/>
was somewhere between goofy and overkill.<br/>
