<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496797459">Sorry to hear that.  We got ours probably 6 years ago or so and the audio is<br/>
fine.  The dubbed accents are sometimes a little funny, but we can<br/>
understand everything said.  These videos are ones that I wish would be<br/>
dubbed a little better and re-released on DVD.   They are that good!<br/>
