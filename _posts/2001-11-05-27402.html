<br/>
 Checking out of the grocery store, I noticed that the bag boy was eyeing my<br/>
two adopted children curiously.  They often draw scrutiny, since my son&#39;s a<br/>
blond Russian, while my daughter has shiny black Haitian skin.<br/>
<br/>
The boy continued staring as he carried our groceries to the car.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, he asked.  &quot;Those your kids?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, they are!&quot; I answered proudly.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;They adopted?&quot; he asked.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;I thought so,&quot; he concluded.  &quot;I figured you&#39;re too old to have kids that<br/>
small.&quot;<br/>
