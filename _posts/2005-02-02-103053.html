<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816179818">Last night at my book group, one of the members (who happens to be a teacher) brought up the recent article in Parade Magazine, by Norman Mailer.  In it, Mailer suggests that TV commercials are responsible for children&#39;s short attention spans, and therefore, a decline in reading: &quot;High school students were showing reduced interest in books. In 2002, among our teenagers and young adults, the drop from 1982 in books read annually came to more than 25 percent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;snipped from this article by Norman Mailer: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://archive.parade.com/2005/0123/0123_one_idea.html">http://archive.parade.com/2005/0123/0123_one_idea.html</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sixty years ago, children would read for hours. Their powers of concentration developed as naturally as breathing. Good readers became very good readers, even as men and women who go in for weight-lifting will bulk up. The connection between loving to read and doing well in school was no mystery to most students.<br/>
<br/>
Every parent has had the experience of picking up a 2- or 3-year-old who is busy at play. All too often, a tantrum occurs. Even as adults, we have to learn to contain our annoyance when our thoughts are broken into. For a child, an interruption to one&#39;s concentration can prove as painful as a verbal rebuke.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I said at book group that I didn&#39;t think Mailer supported his premise in the article, but several other women in the group vehemently agreed that TV causes people to read less and agreed that commercials do cause short attention spans.  It wasn&#39;t the main topic of our discussion, so no more was said about it.<br/>
<br/>
I though about it later and a couple of things came to mind.<br/>
<br/>
1. The article was written by an &quot;expert&quot;, therefore the information should be considered accurate.  Norman Mailer - after all, isn&#39;t a successful published writer an &quot;expert&quot; in reading and writing?  Never mind that there is no actual research or evidence to support his statements - 25% decrease in books read annually among high school students and young adults.  How did they gather that data?  And the children who read &quot;for hours&quot; 60 years ago?  Who was keeping track?<br/>
<br/>
2.  We have no way of knowing how much these &quot;high school students and young adults&quot; would have read if they&#39;d lived before TV.  I suspect there have always been people who did not spend a lot of time reading.  Some people enjoy sitting with a book, others prefer to do other things.  The supposed decline in reading is blamed on TV, when we don&#39;t even know that there actually is a long term decline in reading.  It seems to me, based on bookstores and the popularity of book groups, that reading is alive and well.<br/>

Those games require a lot of attention. So I don&#39;t<br/>
think attention spans have declined all that much.<br/>
<br/>
I think there have always been people who liked to<br/>
read and people who didn&#39;t. Perhaps reading wasn&#39;t as<br/>
important 100 years ago as it is now and so the<br/>
non-readers weren&#39;t noticed as much.<br/>

Well how does he know it&#39;s not granola bars, or FM radio?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The connection between loving to read and doing well in school was no <br/>
mystery to most students.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
School only rewarded verbal skills and mathematical ability, so of course <br/>
reading would improve school performance.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And the children who read &quot;for hours&quot; 60 years ago?  Who was keeping <br/>
track?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read for hours 40 years ago, as escape.  That sort of escape was rewarded <br/>
and praised.  (Not by my mom, but I was learning to ignore her by then.)   <br/>
Other sorts of escape ranged from frowned-upon to illegal.  But reading was virtue.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I suspect there have always been people who did not spend a lot of time <br/>
reading.  Some people enjoy sitting with a book, others prefer to do other <br/>
things. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely, and I think Howard Gardner&#39;s better to listen to about such <br/>
things than someone who himself (Mailer) is a word-rutting language hound.  I love <br/>
language, but I know that most people don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It seems to me, based on bookstores and the popularity of book groups, <br/>

<br/>
No kidding!  There are book stores and magazine racks EVERYWHERE, and those <br/>
kids who are &quot;not reading&quot; but &quot;just being on the internet,&quot; what---is it <br/>
reading aloud to them?  Are they just listening to music?  (Those who do could show <br/>
you all kinds of sites with lyrics and discussions of upcoming albums and <br/>
tours and legal cases involving copyright and analysis of musical styles, and...) <br/>
  Are they just watching videos?  (Ditto the all kinds of sites argument.)<br/>
<br/>
Correlation isn&#39;t cause.<br/>

Marty has been reading graphic novels.  They&#39;re 200 page comic books, <br/>
basically, it seems.   He said the first book he ever sat down and read all the way <br/>
through without stopping, and without noticing he was doing it, was Sin City.  <br/>
(He says it&#39;s a comic book.  I&#39;m not particular. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
His dad read it too, and there are others in line after Marty&#39;s through.<br/>
<br/>
The other night some of the boys were saying they had read that a movie was <br/>
being made of Sin City, and the script was going to be the words in the comic <br/>
and the story boards were going to be the very frames from the comics.<br/>
Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, Benecio del Toro, Jessica Alba and <br/>
another famous actor or two.<br/>

Amazing how people can agree so wholeheartedly that TV is the baddie....and<br/>
totally overlook the way that fragmented school programs are breaking kids&#39;<br/>
attention into short spans all day 5 days a week!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675992448">60 years ago (that would be the 1940s, just barely post-Depression <br/>
and heading into the war years), your choices if you wanted <br/>
entertainment and/or information were do it yourself or read. Unless <br/>
you had scraped up some cash and could go to a movie - and once you <br/>
saw whatever was playing that week, that was it for a bit until the <br/>
next movie arrived, no multiplexes back then.<br/>
<br/>
30 years ago, you could do it yourself, read, watch a limited number <br/>
of TV channels (we got maybe 7 channels back then), or go to a <br/>
movie - duplexes were big so you could choose between TWO movies. <br/>
PCs were non-existant and things like Pong and PacMan were just <br/>
getting going.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are a whole lot more options available for <br/>
entertainment/information gathering so reading (as in picking up a <br/>
book and reading for hours) is not the premium it once was.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, we were watching TV and the cellphone rang. I muted the <br/>
TV while DH answered it and DS (6 1/2) just switched from <br/>
watching/listening to watching/reading the captioning (which we have <br/>
set to pop up automatically when the TV is muted) without missing a <br/>
beat then switched back once the call was over.</div>

the winter X games) opened up a whole discussion of Mad magazine. DS <br/>
was thrilled and surprised to discover that DH has a whole book of <br/>
Spy vs Spy around somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The thing I dislike about the commercials is that the volume <br/>
changes - and we don&#39;t have one of those automatic sound evener <br/>
systems.<br/>
<br/>
As far as reading, heck, the commercials are when I read a page or <br/>
two before getting back to the show. And that&#39;s when lots of people <br/>
head to the &quot;reading room&quot; (also know as the &quot;thinking room&quot;, <br/>
the &quot;throne room&quot; and a whole bunch of eupehmisms).</div>

Radio or what may have been called &quot;the Wireless&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There is a public radio station that is receivable sometimes that plays old<br/>
radio mysteries and other serials. Sometimes they would produce radio<br/>
versions of popular films - with the films&#39; stars reading. <br/>
