<div id="ygrps-yiv-634904847">I found it!!!!!! Let&#39;s try again.<br/>
<br/>
My son is rather an old soul and so very different from our other 3.<br/>
Much more complex. He just doesn&#39;t get keeping his hands to himself<br/>
with his sister. I also don&#39;t go with the never hit thing and have<br/>
explained that whole scenario. He gets that, he understands that it&#39;s<br/>
not nice to hit or even productive within the family. But when his<br/>
sister frustrates him, like I know she&#39;s good at doing, he just<br/>
smacks her without thinking. He knows he shouldn&#39;t, he admits to me<br/>
that he did it and why. I just can&#39;t seem to get him to come to me or<br/>
say something to her first. His first reaction is to pop her one. Now<br/>
it&#39;s not really bad.(meaning she&#39;s not really physically hurt) He doesn&#39;t<br/>
use anything but his hand and it&#39;s<br/>
not a punch or anything and she gets very dramatic when he does it.<br/>
The whole thing ends up a major deal on both parts. Whatever I&#39;ve<br/>
been saying isn&#39;t getting it.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen every day but enough for me to worry why I can&#39;t<br/>
solve this. You can tell right away he&#39;s sorry he does it but just<br/>
doesn&#39;t think about it first. We&#39;ve worked out together all kinds of<br/>
other ways for him to solve the problem but when the time comes, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t use any of them. These are the 2 that are 13 months apart.<br/>
They are almost 7 and 8. She&#39;s the younger one.<br/>

We used to have a problem with our DD pushing her younger brother whenever <br/>
he frustrated her. What *we* did was to give her a time-out, and then talk <br/>
to her about why it&#39;s not okay to push as a first reaction. Luckily for us, <br/>
she just hates time-outs, so after a few of those, she eventually learned <br/>
it wasn&#39;t okay. Or maybe it&#39;s an age thing? YMMV, of course :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well that works with our Sierra because she doesn&#39;t really like time outs. <br/>
Maybe that&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t hit like Joseph does. But Joseph actually time <br/>
outs himself. He likes and actually needs his time alone far more than any <br/>
of us in the family. So time outs don&#39;t work cause he likes that. So we <br/>
don&#39;t do time outs with him anymore. And to clarify again, our time outs are <br/>
not &quot;go to your room&quot; it&#39;s more like a &quot;I know you must be upset maybe you <br/>
need some time to think about, etc&quot;<br/>
So that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to find what does work for him to get the point. I <br/>
find that most of what works with the knowledge I have doesn&#39;t work with <br/>
Joseph. He challenges me in all ways!<br/>
