<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741578611">Yeah but I have a 2 1/2 year old who would be so angry if he weren&#39;t<br/>
allowed to play with the computer.  He&#39;s loves it and asks to get up<br/>
in my lap when I&#39;m on the computer.  One of his favorite words is<br/>
videoclips.<br/>
<br/>
I found Monke&#39;s article irritating based on logic not just on<br/>
unschooling or gentle parenting.  I prefer to think the Gigantic<br/>
Generalizations in the article don&#39;t apply to me and my family because<br/>
we&#39;re special.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My main objections rest in the word &quot;allow.&quot;  Quoting:<br/>
<br/>
::::All that screen time is supplemented by the hundreds of impressive<br/>
computer projects now taking place in schools. Yet these projectsthe<br/>
steady diet of virtual trips to the Antarctic, virtual climbs to the<br/>
summit of Mount Everest, and trips into cyber-orbit that represent one<br/>
technological high after anothergenerate only vicarious thrills. The<br/>
student doesn&#39;t actually soar above the Earth, doesn&#39;t trek across icy<br/>
terrain, doesn&#39;t climb a mountain. Increasingly, she isn&#39;t even<br/>
allowed to climb to the top of the jungle gym.::::<br/>
<br/>
Wordy, isn&#39;t it?  I was intrigued by the word &quot;allowed&quot; there because<br/>
I at first fell into a misinterpretation that the child was allowed to<br/>
go online SOMEtimes whenever she was NOT allowed to play on the jungle<br/>
gym.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what the writer meant.  I think the<br/>
implication was that children cannot climb on the jungle gym while<br/>
online.  This is like saying &quot;the sky is blue.&quot;  I would guess and be<br/>
correct to say that children climbing on the jungle gym cannot<br/>
simultaneously use the swing either.  And grass is usually green too.<br/>
	<br/>
::::&lt;snip&gt; ... students came back down to the Earth of their immediate<br/>
surroundings with boredom and disinterestand a desire to get back<br/>
online.::::<br/>
<br/>
Well there you have it.  It seems there&#39;s a distinct disadvantage to<br/>
exactly the behavior the writer advocates.  Not allowing children<br/>
access to the computer equals boredom and disinterest.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
there&#39;s a benefit to withholding special choices that adults choose to<br/>
cordon off from children --educationally or in any way.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the virtue of allowing outdoor play but not allowing choices? <br/>
When children know choices are there, not allowing them the power to<br/>
make decisions means we don&#39;t trust their abilities or motives or<br/>
whatever.  It doesn&#39;t mean they make bad or good decisions.  It means<br/>
they aren&#39;t allowed to make decisions AT ALL.  I can attest to<br/>
detesting this way of growing up.  <br/>
<br/>
I can also attest to the difficulty in spite of what my heart says of<br/>
breaking away from the ingrained belief that children should be<br/>
decided for and adults should be in total control.  It&#39;s not easy. <br/>
I&#39;m consciously allowing ds as many choices as possible.  I&#39;m getting<br/>
better at it but still have much to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
In a real way, withholding choices from children is a long time in<br/>
which both children and adults lack certain choices in naturally,<br/>
peacefully and happily relating to one another because parents allow<br/>
experts to tell them children aren&#39;t capable of making good decisions.<br/>
 I can already see this playing out between me and ds and dh too for<br/>
that matter.  When one person grabs control of another&#39;s choices, it<br/>
always causes grief.  Conversely when we are in concert with one<br/>
another, so to speak, each person has their own unique precious thing<br/>
to say in their own voice, something we would otherwise miss altogether.  <br/>

&gt; My sister - who has no children, and doesn&#39;t necessarily agree that<br/>
&gt; home/unschooling is best for mine - sent me this link today.  I read<br/>
&gt; the article, then read the below post from Sandra (haven&#39;t read the<br/>
&gt; newsweek article yet); thought it intriguing that the exerpts Sandra<br/>
&gt; made highlighted the benefits of the Internet/computer use, whereas<br/>
&gt; the education/computer &quot;expert&quot; in the Orion article bemoans the<br/>
&gt; computer&#39;s tendency to separate kids from real life. (Didn&#39;t someone<br/>
&gt; once say that about TV...?)<br/>
&gt; Guess it&#39;s a matter of user-failure -- or success!!<br/>

And you are too right.. that IS a benefit.  Whew!  Not allowing<br/>
computer time is liable to make the computer seem way more valuable<br/>
and cool to these kids, true.<br/>

he&#39;s talking to school people.  Picture me whining a bit here.  ;)  Or<br/>
not.  It just seems odd, what he&#39;s proposing these teachers do with<br/>
their classes.  It doesn&#39;t compute much in the real world.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah I see your point.  I meant grief in terms of taking away choices<br/>
that obviously conflicted with the person&#39;s wishes to whom the choices<br/>
would probably have the most impact.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest difference between Marty and the majority of anybody in<br/>
the Western world is his decision&#39;s informed by what HE wants to do<br/>
with his time.  Many people have no idea what they want and really it<br/>
doesn&#39;t usually enter into the equation.  This includes a lot of nuns,<br/>
monks, soldiers and other uniformed folk.  My dh works in a factory<br/>
where uniforms are provided and it&#39;s so ironic to see the humanity<br/>
peaking out the seams of those uniforms which are obviously despised<br/>
by many of the workers for whatever reason (and I&#39;m sure there&#39;re many<br/>
reasons).  When the buzzer/bell rings a parade begins between shifts.<br/>
 Dh gets comments on his hair during work, and I would say that&#39;s the<br/>
easiest thing for people to get by with in terms of nonconformity.  <br/>
