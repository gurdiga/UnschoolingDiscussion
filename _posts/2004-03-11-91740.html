<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138130980">I have been a lurker for sometime now.  I was reading the past posts <br/>
on Bedtime and the toothbrushing.  My issue I have is with my 3 yr <br/>
old.  She does not want to got to bed at night.  We tend to be <br/>
flexible.  Both up until this past summer use to sleep with us.  We <br/>
would all get ready for bed, go into bed and after they fell asleep <br/>
my dh and I would get up. Then we got them twin beds in the same room <br/>
we use to sleep in and moved out our bed to the next room.  I lay <br/>
down with Hannah and dh with Emme. Hannah my 3 yr old about two <br/>
months ago stopped nursing.  But for the past few weeks she won&#39;t go <br/>
to bed without fighting first.  I thought she was testing me, and I <br/>
have stuck to it.  Resulting in her crying before bed everynight.  <br/>
<br/>
Her sister (6 in april) gets tired at bedtime and wants to go to <br/>
bed.  Am I missing something?  Should I let her stay up?  I have in <br/>
the past.  I sat on the couch with her and she stayed up until she <br/>
passed out next to me.  It was about 11pm.  Then she either sleeps <br/>
late or wakes up grumpy.  <br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how others here handle bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Any comments or advice welcome.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m the only one in the house that has a bedtime, and that&#39;s because I <br/>
have to get up in the morning.  My kids usually go to bed between 9 and <br/>
11, sometimes later.  They sleep fairly late too, past 9 most days, <br/>
unless there is a reason to get up.  Occassionally they need to get up <br/>
early, so they do so, and then go to bed earlier that night to make up <br/>
for the sleep.  Other times they stay up later--I have many fond <br/>
memories of spending quiet hours watching a movie or just reading side <br/>
by side with one or both of my children at 3 am.  Both my kids have <br/>
always been nightowls, and I usually am too, when I&#39;m not working. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really see a need for a bedtime for unschooled kids. <br/>
<br/>
Occassionally we have times where it&#39;s obvious my kids aren&#39;t getting <br/>
enough sleep.  We talk about it and find solutions and it all works <br/>
out.  They are learning to listen to their body regarding sleep, not to <br/>
watch a clock.<br/>

&quot;late&quot; is a problem?  We don&#39;t have a schedule here as to when we <br/>
&quot;should&quot; go to sleep or wake up.  We sleep when we&#39;re sleepy and get up <br/>
when we get up.  That usually means that me and the kids (just-turned-3 <br/>
and 4-1/2) go to bed sometime around 11pm or later;  DH follows his own <br/>
times due to his job.<br/>
<br/>
I am usually up by 8am, my DD (3) usually gets up sometime before 10am, <br/>
and my DS sometimes sleeps until noon (but he doesn&#39;t nap like DD <br/>
usually does so sleeping that long kinda lumps a nap in too. ;&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
If we have someplace to be the next morning we do try to get to bed a <br/>
little earlier, but sometimes it just doesn&#39;t happen.  Try just <br/>
following their lead as to when they want to sleep and wake and see <br/>
what happens.  Good luck.  :)<br/>

I found ways to give her the attention without the nursing.  I think she really needed the reassurance that I would be with her even if we weren&#39;t nursing.  One of the things we did was I would lay down with her until she fell asleep.  Now she is 9 and she has recently started wanting me to lay down with her at night.  I think she&#39;s needing the extra attention because I&#39;ve been busy with a couple of projects.  I stay with her at night until she tells me I can go.  I know I can say &quot;needs attention&quot; on this list and not have people think my daughter is greedy.  To me, providing attention is one of my critical functions as mother.   Hope this helps you some.  Deirdre</div>

<br/>
We don&#39;t have a bed time or a nap time here.  My DD is almost 3 (in <br/>
May) and we have never had a schedule.  She sleeps when she is <br/>
tired.  Sometimes she will take a nap at 10 am for 2 hours, <br/>
sometimes she will nap at 2 pm for an hour and sometimes she doesn&#39;t <br/>
take a nap at all.  I&#39;ve had people ask me how I schedule my errends <br/>
and such, if she is not on a nap schedule.  I simply go out when I <br/>
need to go out, if she falls asleep in the car (which she usually <br/>
does), I put her in the storller and she will either stay asleep or <br/>
not.  <br/>
<br/>
As for bed time, it really depends on if she has had a nap that <br/>
day.  If not or if she took an early nap, she goes to bed around <br/>
7:30 or 8pm.  If she took a nap, she goes to bed between 9 and 11 <br/>
pm.  We don&#39;t anywhere to be most mornings (almost never as a matter <br/>
of fact because I hate rushing to get ready in the mornings) so it&#39;s <br/>
no big deal if she goes to bed late.<br/>
<br/>
I have never had a hang up on the bedtime schedule (I have other <br/>
hang ups that I&#39;ve had to take a hard look at but, this wasn&#39;t one <br/>
of them).  :)  Mostly because, out of everyone that I have seen who <br/>
has a set bedtime, it is almost always a screaming yelling match to <br/>
get the child in bed.  I just don&#39;t want or need that stress in my <br/>
life.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I am wondering how others here handle bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Any comments or advice welcome.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
My younger three are 9, 8 and 3. We start the bedtime process around 11 now<br/>
because we are all getting up earlier. My husband moved his office at home<br/>
and we are trying to get on an earlier schedule because of that. Living in<br/>
south FL, it&#39;a also easier to get moving earlier in the summer because of<br/>
the heat. So the bedtimes changed from 12 or 1 to 11. Wake up times went<br/>
from noon to 9 or 10.<br/>
<br/>
Our children have always had their own rooms and beds from about the age of<br/>
1. We never all slept in the same bed either. So moving beds or rooms and<br/>
not nursing could be the cause of some of her disagreement over bedtimes. My<br/>
3 year old started that awhile ago. Staying up later for her would not make<br/>
her sleep later the next day. A lot of kids seem to wake around the same<br/>
time no matter how late they go to bed. Then you have a grouchy kid. So her<br/>
staying up a lot later was not an option. I found that when the other 2 went<br/>
to bed, just keeping Alyssa up after them was enough to satisfy her. About<br/>
10 minutes after the other 2 were tucked in, I would ask if she wanted to go<br/>
to bed because it was later and she would happily go. I guess she liked the<br/>
idea of being the last child to go into the room. Sometimes it was 20<br/>
minutes or so but never long enough to make her grouchy the next day. That<br/>
lasted about a week and now she goes when her sister and brother does. It<br/>
was an easy solution. Hope you find one as well.<br/>

That&#39;s not good for her health.<br/>
It&#39;s not good for her peace of mind.<br/>
It&#39;s not good for sleeping itself.<br/>
It&#39;s not good for her relationship with you.<br/>

It is heartbreaking to her to have to go to bed without you. She has always <br/>
gone to bed with you in the past, nursing, snuggled against you, warm and safe. <br/>
Now you want her to get into a cold bed without you, without that warmth... <br/>
I&#39;m guessing as you nursed her you would rub her back, stroke her hair, kiss <br/>
the top of her head, say soft, loving words? Is there something in your life now <br/>
where the whole family HAS to get up at a specific time? If not, why can&#39;t <br/>
she go to sleep later and wake later? Would doing that give you someone on one <br/>
time with your older daughter? I&#39;m not saying you should resume nursing or that <br/>
you were wrong to quit when you did, just that since you have left that part <br/>
of her (and your) life behind why complicate it by taking the rest of it away <br/>
too?<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids stopped nursing around three, three and a half. Both my kids <br/>
still sleep with me and Darin whenever they want. If my kids are ready for bed <br/>
and I&#39;m not they will get into my bed together and watch a movie. They have <br/>
their own beds and bedrooms, and I would hazard a guess that they sleep in <br/>
their own beds three nights a week. And Jack probably sleeps with his sister two <br/>
and a half of those three nights. (so Moly is more ready for independent sleep <br/>
than he is at this point) If I&#39;m ready but they aren&#39;t, they may stay up and <br/>
watch TV in the living room or play a gamecube game. Sometimes I wake up to one <br/>
or both sitting at the foot of my bed playing playstation2. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like going to bed by myself most of the time. I am used to a warm <br/>
body against me. Darin has been gone at school for three weeks now. (We go get <br/>
him tomorrow!!!) I have had the kids and dog sleep with me every night since he <br/>
has been gone, and more for me than them. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have grumpy kids, rather I don&#39;t have kids who are grumpy from lack <br/>
of sleep, grumpy for other reasons, just not sleep. There are no tears at &quot;bed <br/>
time&quot; because bed time isn&#39;t despotic or mandatory. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282531701">Thank you all for your replies.  I realized we have gotten away from <br/>
the way we parent here.  I no longer have my support system of other <br/>
parents who attachment parent.  My mother has seeped into my brain.  <br/>
She keeps commenting that I am letting my girls &quot;run the show&quot;.  For <br/>
the most part I do not listen to her.  Part of me wanted to show her <br/>
that it wasn&#39;t true, instead of knowing that it is not true and <br/>
continue on with our family unit.  The girls do have a lot of say.  <br/>
And we have always tried to put their wellbeing and their needs <br/>
first.  My oldest taught me that when she was a baby.  When she was a <br/>
baby we said good bye to her crib and got lots of comments for <br/>
holding and tending to Emily too much.  I knew we were doing the <br/>
right thing.  So I want to thank you for putting be back on track.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest(emily) had always been easy at bedtime.  When it was late <br/>
we read books to her and then I would lay down with her in our bed.  <br/>
We have been doing this since she was 6 months old.(she is 6yrs now)  <br/>
When Hannah came along everything changed.  With Emily regressing <br/>
into her Autism and finding out she was autistic, I nursed hannah for <br/>
everything including bed.  When we decided together that she was <br/>
going to wean I still layed in bed with her and rubbed her head until <br/>
she fell asleep.  Recently she has decided that she isn&#39;t ready to <br/>
sleep but she was trying to keep up her sister.  So my dh would take <br/>
her into the livingrm and sit with her.  Then she would insist that <br/>
she was ready and would lay in her bed and then say that she wasn&#39;t <br/>
ready. <br/>
Now I feel really bad for this month of crazy bedtime demands.  I let <br/>
my mother bother me.  I was hiding the fact that Hannah was still <br/>
nursing past 3yrs.  She has never approved of my parenting or my <br/>
decision to homeschool, she was on me for a bit about hannah going to <br/>
preschool.  Saying that Hannah needs to go to preschool so that she <br/>
would learn to respect adults, and learn how other kids her age <br/>
should be.( I didn&#39;t realize ~hOw~ bad that sounded until I just <br/>
wrote it)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for letting me take a good look at what was <br/>
happening.  I posted because that was not how I wanted to parent.  I <br/>
DO NoT want her to cry every night over something like this. We do <br/>
not plan anything in the mornings anyhow because Emily(6) has a hard <br/>
time leaving too early for something.  I am surrounded by other moms <br/>
who put their kids in preschool in 3-5 days a week and take them to <br/>
this and that expecting too much.  We are always the last to leave <br/>
their dance class because we are not rushing off.  I was starting to <br/>
catch myself rushing them for no reason. aaahhh.<br/>
<br/>
 I feel very alone in my parenting.  I am an attachment homeschooling <br/>
mom of a child with asperger&#39;s who is on a special diet and has some <br/>
special needs, and a very spirited little one who has been a life <br/>
saver in our family, and makes us all laugh hard. <br/>

&gt; mom of a child with asperger&#39;s who is on a special diet and has some<br/>
&gt; special needs, and a very spirited little one who has been a life<br/>

special places I haven&#39;t thought of that people have found <br/>
unschooling/attachment parenting people in person?  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve <br/>
thought of:<br/>
<br/>
1.  La Leche League, because Sandra mentions that&#39;s where <br/>
she &quot;started.&quot;  Except I have a 6-year-old, and it doesn&#39;t seem fair <br/>
to drag him to a place full of babies only (I&#39;m envisioning a support <br/>
group meeting, but maybe I&#39;m wrong).  That&#39;s been my hesitation in <br/>
checking it out.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Homeschooling groups:  I&#39;m surrounded by fundies and I just don&#39;t <br/>
know if I have the strength to sort through them in what is probably <br/>
a futile attempt.  Every group in my local area has the <br/>
word &quot;Christian&quot; in their name, and many require a certain belief, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Unschooling.com local area boards:  I have emailed and left phone <br/>
messages for a couple people through these, but one of the moms <br/>
mentioned that &quot;we try to do reading, math and writing every day, but <br/>
we unschool everything else.&quot;  After reading people on this list, I&#39;m <br/>
not ready to go there.<br/>
<br/>
It probably sounds like I&#39;m being too picky, but I am looking for <br/>
someone like-minded that I can really share with, watch in their <br/>
interactions, learn from and not feel embarrassed when I keep trying <br/>
to help my sons get what they want, even when they are upset and <br/>
crying.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance . . .<br/>

Pretend you HAVE a group and list it in the NHEN database? Describe it <br/>
as you wish it was - a group that is inclusive and supports attachment <br/>
parenting and unschooling and eclectic homeschooling. So the group is <br/>
just you for now - go to the same place each week and maybe somebody <br/>
will join you sometime.<br/>
<br/>
OR - give a talk about unschooling - again, just pretend you&#39;re a group <br/>
wanting to put on the talk. Advertise it, rent a room somewhere, and <br/>
see who shows up (you&#39;ll need to be ready to actually talk about <br/>
unschooling, too, of course).<br/>

I&#39;ve forgotten what state you&#39;re in...maybe some of us already know <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399988119">Have you been to the special needs folders on the Message Boards at<br/>
unschooling.com? Lots of empathy and support there. Come to the conference �<br/>
it can get you through the year in some ways. <br/>
<br/>
We like Jayn to �run her part of the show� � because it really is still us,<br/>
the adults, allowing her to do so, so that she gets to make decisions. The<br/>
only time we have conflicts is really when I have slid into being<br/>
controlling, all unaware, and am making arbitrary demands. Sometimes they<br/>
are not arbitrary, but she doesn�t happen to agree with my reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
My mother used to say things that were like a few drops of horrible poison<br/>
about my husband, that would then fester in my mind until I talked to him<br/>
about whatever it was. She recently had a stroke, and has changed a lot in<br/>
that her choice is to be happy and grateful, instead of judgmental all the<br/>
time. Also she is on medication that makes her loopy. However in the old<br/>
days I finally had to say to her �I never see anything wrong with him until<br/>
you point it out. Are you really trying make me to get a divorce?�. That<br/>
slowed her down, as she really hadn�t realized that she wasn�t helping � her<br/>
paradigm: the wife is supposed to remake the husband into a better man � I<br/>
don�t feel that is my job at all! Now she persists in giving me credit for<br/>
�teaching� Jayn everything Jayn works out entirely for herself. Since it is<br/>
hard to know how lucid Mum is at any time, I don�t try to set her straight<br/>
every time. She lives far away so her negative impact is now minimal.<br/>
<br/>
Robyn L. Coburn<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She keeps commenting that I am letting my girls &quot;run the show&quot;.  For <br/>
the most part I do not listen to her.  Part of me wanted to show her <br/>
that it wasn&#39;t true, instead of knowing that it is not true and <br/>
continue on with our family unit.  The girls do have a lot of say. &gt;&gt; <br/>

I&#39;ve considered before.  I like the idea of giving a talk.  (Well, it <br/>
makes me a little nervous, but I still like it.)<br/>
<br/>
And I live in Michigan, but in West Michigan -- Grand Rapids.  I <br/>
think there are people here near Ann Arbor and Detroit (with whom I&#39;d <br/>
be very willing to meet as well) -- but I don&#39;t know of any near GR <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528043360">Try giving your La Leche contact a call. That&#39;s actually how I hooked up with my homeschooling group.<br/>
<br/>
When we moved, I had found a couple of religious groups that I just wasn&#39;t interested in (and once they knew more about me, they wouldn&#39;t have been either!). When I felt my kids were old enough, I wanted to volunteer to help other mothers and look into becoming a lactation consultant. I ended up talking to one of my local LL leaders, who was so nice, patient and helpful. She invited me to the meeting, but I asked if I could bring my children since I homeschool. She told me that all 4 of the leaders homeschooled, so that was fine. I asked her what support group she was part of and I ended up meeting them a couple nights later for a Mom&#39;s Night Out.<br/>
<br/>
This has been a *great* bunch of women, and it turns out that 2 of the 4 LL leaders unschool as well. I&#39;d be completely lost without these two overlapping groups. It&#39;s amazing how much I still get out of LL meetings even though I&#39;m no longer nursing. The attachment parenting part of it just goes way beyond nursing, and I&#39;ve found that unschooling is so much a continuation of that philosophy in our lives. I&#39;m hoping to become a leader, too, this year.<br/>

&lt;&lt;It&#39;s amazing how much I still get out of LL meetings even though <br/>
I&#39;m no longer nursing. The attachment parenting part of it just goes <br/>

continuation of that philosophy in our lives. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, this is the part I&#39;m kicking myself for not realizing.  People <br/>
would talk about La Leche and I would think, &quot;I&#39;m nursing, I&#39;m not <br/>
having trouble nursing.  Why would I need it?&quot;  I had no idea of the <br/>
other things there I could learn.<br/>

I will call the them, though.  Thanks to all helping me think this <br/>
through (I&#39;m still reading the posts).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347553027">Is there a home schooling list for your state?  If so, maybe you could put<br/>
out an advertisement on the list for like-minded people.  You could host a<br/>
get-to-know-you at your house or at a local park or something.  Send the<br/>
message every week for a few months and see who shows up.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234702549">I wanted to respond to your message.  But first just in case my <br/>
message sounds like I&#39;m attacking yours, I&#39;m not.  I feel as though I <br/>
need to clarify a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This sounds harsh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a bit harsh, being firm with Hannah for not wanting to go to <br/>
bed.  The situation is that we as a family had decided on a bedtime<br/>
(which has always been flexable).  Hannah would then say after <br/>
getting in bed with me she was no longer tired.  So my husband would <br/>
take her and I would lay down with my older daughter.  Than after 10-<br/>
15min would then say she wanted to go to bed.  We would then get back <br/>
in bed and snuggle and then she after fussing a bit. Would state she <br/>
didn&#39;t want to sleep.  I would ask her if she wanted me to keep <br/>
rubbing her head.  Then I would say ok I will take you into the other <br/>
room.  NO! she would scream and cry.  &quot;then you want to go to <br/>
sleep?&quot;  NO! she would scream and cry again.  If it continued I would <br/>
remove her from the room because it starts to bother my older <br/>
daughter. Then Hannah and I would sit on the couch and try to talk it <br/>
out.  She would then confess Yes she was tired and was ready to go to <br/>
sleep.  I would then bring her in and rub her head and within seconds <br/>
she will be asleep.  One issue was that we would go through this <br/>
every night. Even if She was the one comming to me wanting to go to <br/>
bed.<br/>
<br/>
To me Harsh would be telling her in a demanding voice it is bedtime <br/>
no matter what, and putting her in her room by herself.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s not good for her health.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s not good for sleeping itself.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not good for her relationship with you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are the reasons I came asking.  I shouldn&#39;t have used the word <br/>
fighting.  I would try not to raise my voice.  It felt like a fight <br/>
because we were going back and forth.  Bed-no bed. <br/>

together find a time for bed, restful sleep. We have never sent them <br/>
to bed.  We have our routine.  Emme needs it. It is part of her she <br/>
can&#39;t go to bed with out the routine.  <br/>
