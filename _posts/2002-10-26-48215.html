<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780406614">Part formal introduction, I think I started posting without one.  I work at<br/>
home and tend to only post when I have the time or something has really gotten<br/>
to me. And part reply to Myranda, who is concerned about the responses of some<br/>
on this list.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Cherry.  I&#39;m 29, a wahm mother to 1 son, Caesar.  I was introduced<br/>
to unschooling by my friend Beth Ali, she&#39;s also on this list.  <br/>
<br/>
The subject reads overwhelmed because I&#39;m very busy with work right now and<br/>
I&#39;ve had to read almost 100 posts in one sitting.  Many of the posts made me<br/>
cry.  They bring up painful memories.  The subject reads appreciative because<br/>
they provided an opening for me and my husband to have a really great<br/>
discussion this morning and because they gave me a sense of hope.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very grateful for Sandra and Ren and others who are willing to be brutally<br/>
honest about the revulsion they feel about abuse.  Neither my husband or I had<br/>
people in our lives willing to stand up for us.  I was sexually abused by my<br/>
father and he was beaten by his.  In my family no one ever said I was a liar<br/>
or denied the abuse but they also never took my father to task about the<br/>
abuse.  Everyone continued to treat him as if he was a decent human being. <br/>
Until this morning my husband had never said that he feels anger at his<br/>
mother, who never hit him, but did condone his abuse by not stopping it.  We<br/>
both felt like no one really cared that we had been hurt.  I think it led us<br/>
to excuse alot of abusive, coercive behavior in people.  For both of us our<br/>
abuse ended when we vehemently said no to our abusers.  I remember so clearly<br/>
being at the kitchen sink and my father coming up behind me and touching me. <br/>
It was primal instinct more than anything that made me push him off of me and<br/>
start screaming no.  My husband says his father was beating him with a broom<br/>
stick, which broke.  He picked up a piece of the stick and threw it at him. <br/>
He said he&#39;ll never forget how shocked his father looked. <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes a voracious, no pussy-footing around NO is what&#39;s needed to stop<br/>
abuse.  Abuse is not nice or gentle or kind and the response to it can&#39;t be<br/>
nice or gentle or kind.  Brutal honesty, like all things can be used for good<br/>
or bad, in the case of the posters on this board I believe it&#39;s being used for<br/>
good.  Take intentions into account before criticizing.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the desire to understand and accept people and give positive<br/>
responses (I&#39;m a Sagittarius ;-)  But it can&#39;t be at the expense of an<br/>
innocent child&#39;s well-being.  And no matter how many ways the christians try<br/>
to spin it spanking diminishes the spirit.  People who spank should not expect<br/>
positive or gentle responses to them or their discipline choices when they do<br/>
not give positive or gentle responses to their own children.  My own parents<br/>
did not give beating-type spankings, they would hit us on an open hand with a<br/>
wooden paddle.  But it put fear and mis-trust in us.  Even before I was<br/>
molested there was a dark cloud on me and my family because of it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS-I also want to add that my belief that children choose their parents<br/>
happened because I was a very promiscious teenager and I never got pregnant<br/>
(never got stds either)  I even had a boyfriend (who had children with other<br/>
women) ask me why I didn&#39;t get pregnant.  I&#39;ve been pregnant twice by my<br/>
husband, the first time I miscarried.  When our son was born I had a strange<br/>
sense that he was the same spirit that had been with us before and he was now<br/>
choosing to be with us because the time was right.</div>

What a lovely thought.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do too. Much to my mother&#39;s disgust. (She&#39;s visiting from England <br/>
this week....)<br/>
She has been ranting on that kids should be seen and not heard, <br/>
should show adults respect just because they are adults, should <br/>
brush their hair and look &#39;proper&#39;, should be &#39;well-mannered&#39; <br/>
(whatver that is), shouldn&#39;t have opinions that differ from an adults. <br/>
The list goes on and on.<br/>
She even had a go at me for saying please when i asked my <br/>
daughter to pass something as &#39;children should obey without any <br/>
expectations and obey instantly&#39;<br/>
<br/>
As you can imagine things have been a little stormy, not heped by <br/>
the fact that she broke her tooth on Day 1 and needed root canal <br/>
treatment by day 5 (man, dentists charge a lot don&#39;t they and <br/>
guess who paid...) so she&#39;s been tetchy with pain and doped on <br/>
codeine.<br/>
<br/>
I need a holiday.<br/>

would be easier to see her in small doses once a month than big <br/>
dose once a year.<br/>
Ho hum.<br/>
