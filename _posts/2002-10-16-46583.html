Bedtimes - We have no set bedtimes, but DH and I both start our days at 6 am. He has a very physically draining job he&#39;s at 10 hrs a day, I am always up and down and running here and there with the kids. We&#39;re both totally bushed by 11 pm. Both boys are always still up and going at that time if I let them, I usually send them to bed around 10-10:30ish so they&#39;ll be asleep before I pass out. They both fall asleep within 5-10 minutes, so I know they&#39;re tired. They never protest or ask to stay up longer. No matter what time they go to bed, they&#39;re up by 6:30 am, have been since they were a year old. I can&#39;t let them stay up alone, they just get into fights and end up hurting each other, and they get so loud they wake everyone else up. They will also go outside, and that scares me. Do y&#39;all think I&#39;m being too &quot;controlling&quot; by telling them to go to bed, and if so what do you think I should be doing differently?<br/>

&quot;Hey, guys, you know how I always tell you to go to bed? Well, are you okay<br/>
with that or do you want to try something different?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Different could be you go sleep in their room for a few months. Different<br/>
could be they come sleep in your room. Different could be they make the<br/>
agreement to not bash each other &lt;g&gt; and you see how that goes.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t sleep in their room, I have to sleep with the baby or she doesn&#39;t sleep. I sleep in the living room, and they do sometimes join me, especially when it storms or when there&#39;s something good on TV. Oh, and they&#39;ve made the agreement not to hit, not to leave the house without letting someone know, etc, but they always do it anyway, saying &quot;they forgot&quot; the agreement or they &quot;just wanted to do it&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s more fun&quot;. Maybe they just need to get a tad bit older? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917910373">With one of my children I would make a safe area to play while I slept nearby.   This could be in your children&#39;s room, or in the living room, or by  your room, with the door open, for instance, and a gate blocking the stairs, even a young child could be left to play while mom and dad slept in the adjoining room.  That way you could monitor fights. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more concerned about their going out at night alone.  That would worry me.  Perhpas you need to make clear that you are willing to allow them to stay up and play, but not if they go outside/fight.  That if they do that they need to stay in their room(s)? Yes that is limiting, but I&#39;m not totally against limits.<br/>
<br/>
However, if they aren&#39;t protesting your sending them up then perhaps it really isn&#39;t limiting them in anyway. Perhaps it feels good to them in some way.  I know there are those who would protest that, however, your children aren&#39;t putting up a fight, or beg for just one moment.  Maybe they like how things are.<br/>

  **That would work, if they&#39;d be quiet enough for the rest of us to sleep. &lt;g&gt; Brett has no concept of a &quot;whisper&quot; or even a low speaking voice, he yells everything! Maybe we need to find some games to play that use quiet voices. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m more concerned about their going out at night alone.  That would worry me.  Perhpas you need to make clear that you are willing to allow them to stay up and play, but not if they go outside/fight.  That if they do that they need to stay in their room(s)? Yes that is limiting, but I&#39;m not totally against limits.<br/>
<br/>
  **Yes, they are usually happy in their rooms, for a time anyway. But when left unsupervised, they run in and out of each other&#39;s room, taking toys and other items, and of course, hitting. Brett&#39;s usually the one who does the hitting and hurting, Tyler just takes it, bless his heart! <br/>
<br/>
  However, if they aren&#39;t protesting your sending them up then perhaps it really isn&#39;t limiting them in some way.  I know there are those who would protest that, however, your children aren&#39;t putting up a fight, or beg for just one moment.  Maybe they like how things are.<br/>
<br/>
  ** Haven&#39;t looked at it that way. Bedtimes are about the one and only subject they won&#39;t really give me any answers about when I ask them. The only thing they&#39;ll say is that they never want to go to sleep, and that they don&#39;t know. Maybe it&#39;s because they really don&#39;t have a preferance at this point?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896837171">Myranda,  I am also running into the same thing with my 5 yr. dd,  She gets so exhausted that she cries over everything and even when I say, lets go snuggle and read together, she knows it leads to bed so she is very feisty with it.  For us its best if we start some &#39;down&#39; time around 8:00 or so and then slowly winds down and we can play a little and read a little.  <br/>
Now tonight she was yelling at me and crying several times,  finally she decided it was OK if dad lays with her and reads a book.  <br/>
So, I am also struggling with this,  my 7 and 9 year olds seem to have come to grips with the bed thing.  But it seems like Kyra, the 5 yr old, doesn&#39;t know quite what to do yet.<br/>
Now I am going to try and unwind and get some rest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>sleep. I sleep in the living room, and they do sometimes join me, especially<br/>
when it storms or when there&#39;s something good on TV. Oh, and they&#39;ve made<br/>
the agreement not to hit, not to leave the house without letting someone<br/>
know, etc, but they always do it anyway, saying &quot;they forgot&quot; the agreement<br/>
or they &quot;just wanted to do it&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s more fun&quot;. Maybe they just need to<br/>
get a tad bit older?<br/>
<br/>
For the going outside thing, can you put the kind of lock on the doors that<br/>
needs a key to open?  Or a latch that they can&#39;t reach?  As to the fighting,<br/>
how about asking how they think it should be dealt with.  They might have<br/>
some ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093665744">Good idea, I need to look at some latches and see what we can install. We&#39;ve got a regular front door, and two sliding doors. Especially with the baby starting to walk, I want some way to secure them. I can just see one of them running out and leaving the door wide open for the baby to go out! About the fighting, we&#39;ve all talked to them about it over and over, asked what causes it, what can be done to stop it, etc. Brett simply wants to hurt Tyler when Tyler does something he doesn&#39;t like. According to him, the only way to stop it is to keep Tyler away from him and quiet all the time, and that certainly isn&#39;t possible! The last time it happened, Brett slammed Tyler&#39;s head into the doorframe because Tyler had turned the fan on in his room, and Brett didn&#39;t like the noise. It&#39;s definitely fun around here sometimes!<br/>

This happened not long ago with my barely two year old grandson.  Twice,<br/>
they discovered he was missing and ended up finding him at the edge of or<br/>
actually *on* a busy road.  Yikes!  The front door now has furniture in<br/>
front of it, the back door leads to a fenced back yard, and the side door is<br/>
locked with a lock he can&#39;t undo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41685001">Oh, that would be so scary!! We&#39;ve always lived in the boonies, and you can&#39;t even see a road from where we are now, but there&#39;s a lot of mean dogs and barbed wire and electric fences around here that I&#39;d be scared of!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m more concerned about their going out at night alone.  That would worry <br/>
me.  Perhpas you need to make clear that you are willing to allow them to <br/>
stay up and play, but not if they go outside/fight.  That if they do that <br/>
they need to stay in their room(s)? Yes that is limiting, but I&#39;m not totally <br/>
against limits. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just last night I told boys who are 13, 14 and 14 to STAY IN THE HOUSE.  It <br/>
was 11:30, Marty had two overnight guests, and I heard the troublemaker of <br/>
the batch say &quot;Well let&#39;s go outside.&quot;    I said people were trying to sleep <br/>
and they needed to stay inside and do something quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Had it been a Saturday night with adults in the house and had I not been <br/>
stuck on the couch I might have been more likely to negotiate or to inquire <br/>
as to why they wanted to go outside and how quiet they were going to be.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a forever rule about in or out.  It was that last night I didn&#39;t <br/>
want them going out.  They accepted it really well, because they knew it was <br/>
iffy about them coming over anyway since my broken leg is living in the den <br/>
this week.<br/>
