extremely cute at this age but I wonder if it might be a problem later on or <br/>

<br/>
Cute as it can be---and it DOES go away! :-(<br/>
<br/>
Cameron couldn&#39;t say Y&#39;s. &quot;Yap&quot; would be &quot;lap&quot; and &quot;young&quot; would be &quot;lung&quot;. <br/>
It went away at about 4, I guess. I miss it.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan, on the other hand switched the two---like your daughter. We would <br/>
recite &quot;Big L Little L. Little Lola Lopp. Left leg. Lazy lion licks a lollipop.&quot; <br/>
ALL with Y&#39;s! &lt;G&gt; &quot;Big e-wa yitta e-wa. Yitta yoya yopp. Yeft yeg. Yazy yion <br/>
yicks a yawyee pop.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested that we needed to cut his tongue underneath---that she had <br/>
had the same problem and the &quot;clipping&quot; had corrected it after a while. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing that it corrected WHEN she was ready---in spite of the knife! (Kind of <br/>
like the reading that happens when everyone focuses on it for months and <br/>
months! &lt;G&gt;) I figured that, since I didn&#39;t know any adults who couldn&#39;t say their <br/>
L&#39;s, it wasn&#39;t a permanent problem.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway---it stopped shortly after his sixth birthday. He&#39;ll be eight in <br/>
March. It shows up very occasionally when he&#39;s tired or very sleepy. I miss that <br/>
too! <br/>

And she did okay.<br/>

She has trouble with &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot; both I think.<br/>

My adopted son talks the same way, and he is 10.  BUT...he was/is very <br/>
developmentally delayed (though he&#39;s catching up in leaps and bounds now and LOVEING <br/>
&quot;homeschool.)  He was in speech at school, but I&#39;ve noticed after the summer <br/>
and now that he&#39;s home full time, he&#39;s beginning to speak a little more <br/>
clearly.  His is/was pretty severe, but the caseworker said both his parents spoke <br/>
exactly the same way, as adults.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the &quot;lazy lion licked a lolly pop&quot; Dr. Seuss book to <br/>
practice.  I&#39;ll get it from the library next time.  He actually likes doing <br/>
&quot;speech&quot; stuff (when he&#39;d bring home practice sheets from school last year) so he&#39;ll <br/>
probably enjoy reading it together.<br/>
