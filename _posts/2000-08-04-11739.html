&gt; Hi, I am looking forward to being apart of this loop. I have four children<br/>
&gt; ages 16, 14, 12, 10. We have always homeschooled. We started out quite<br/>
&gt; structured and have been loosing up more and more each year. I first heard<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; unschooling when we went online a few years ago. Now I consider us to be<br/>
&gt; apart of this wonderful lifestyle. The kids do use Math-u-See math books<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; it is their choice and I do not require it. Matter of fact my 10 year old<br/>
&gt; said he does not want to do it for a while and that is ok. We also read<br/>
aloud<br/>
&gt; together almost daily and enjoy it very much. Right now we all have an<br/>
&gt; interest in ancient history, so that is what we have been reading. Boy I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; learned a lot. It is so interesting. (But we did take a break to read the<br/>
&gt; newest Harry Potter book recently!) The kids came to me yesterday telling<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; somethings they would like to check out. The oldest saw the book<br/>
Blueprints<br/>
&gt; for Geometry in a catalog and wants to try it. The 14 yr. old wants to<br/>
learn<br/>
&gt; Japanese, an interest that stems from the Japanese terms they use in<br/>
karate.<br/>
&gt; All the sudden this summer all the kids have gotten excited about playing<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; sax and clarinet we have here. The boys found art and science books they<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to try.  And this is pretty much how it goes. We live in the country on a<br/>
few<br/>
&gt; acres. We live pretty simply except for this pc which has become a<br/>
necessity.<br/>
&gt; We do love the internet! :)<br/>
&gt;     My husband works a lot of hours in the summer for a construction<br/>
company<br/>
&gt; but winter is coming. The kids and I earn money selling items on ebay. And<br/>
&gt; the kids clean a house for a neighbor to pay for karate classes. The kids<br/>
&gt; also race BMX. Seems like we are seldom bored.<br/>
&gt;     I look forward to meeting you all<br/>

This is too good! My daughter loves Mark Twain, has all his books and loves <br/>
his quotes. But she had not heard this one. Thanks for the laugh<br/>
