<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004664813">**English has 26 letters and 44 sounds. Simple.**<br/>
<br/>
Bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
Those 44 sounds are represented by (I don&#39;t have the time to look it up right <br/>
now) way more than 44 letters or letter groups. PLUS many of those letter <br/>
groups represent more than one sound. Several of the vowel groups represent <br/>
numerous sounds, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES PHONICS HORRIBLY HORRIBLY DIFFICULT FOR <br/>
KIDS WHO ARE NOT MEMORIZING WHOLE WORDS BUT TRYING TO SOUND THEM OUT EACH AND <br/>
EVERY TIME THEY SEE THEM.<br/>
<br/>
Every damn time someone posts about how easy phonics is to teach they do the <br/>
little routine with short vowel sounds and single consanants in a CVC <br/>
pattern. Yup, that&#39;s easy. It&#39;s also NOT more than 50% of what kids are <br/>
trying to read.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I don&#39;t have time to get into a longer discussion on this <br/>
issue, as I&#39;m leaving for NY in the morning and I&#39;ll be gone for 2 weeks. <br/>
I&#39;ll probably run past it when I come back, though.<br/>

Ned, did you write this article yourself?<br/>
