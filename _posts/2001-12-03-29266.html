<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it is more in how you veiw the words and the language.  Long<br/>
ago, I learned to disassociate the negative connotation from<br/>
descriptive words like willful and also from ones like dyslexic.  I<br/>
personally have been called everything from abrasive to the deamon<br/>
bitch.  The words don&#39;t affect my self-worth.  It took me years to<br/>
learn, it took my kid&#39;s days to learn - but that was because they had<br/>
an example to learn from.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, words have great power.  But you know what, they have no power <br/>
over me anymore.  As one who was the kids made fun of in grade <br/>
school, I learned that those people who use words that way do so <br/>
because they don&#39;t know the true meaning of power.<br/>
My kids learned very much earlier than I that words are words <br/>
and &quot;Filet Mignon&quot; and &quot;dead cow flesh&quot; mean the same thing.  They <br/>
know that if I say they are &quot;lazy&quot; it means they share my tendency to <br/>
be inactive.  They don&#39;t view it as an insult, they view it as an <br/>
observation.  And they are quite free with making the same <br/>
observation about me and I appreciate it when they do because <br/>
sometimes I need to hear it too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532594496">I realized that there is potential for a bit of confusionin a <br/>
coupleof my posts today . . . so I&#39;ll post the explanation before <br/>
someone attacks the inconsistency.<br/>
<br/>
First I said that no one here said that they say things like &quot;lazy <br/>
and willful&quot; to their children.  Then later I said that I would not <br/>
censor those words from my household.  <br/>
Both things are true or were when I said them.  I would not advocate <br/>
that you all start telling it like it is in your homes because it <br/>
sounds like most of you do not have the kind of language usage in <br/>
your homes that we have here.  My kids have had 16, 14 and 10 years <br/>
to learn about words and how we play with them here.  I would <br/>
advocate that you help your kids learn about the effects of language <br/>
before you let them out in the world where they could be hurt by a <br/>
lack of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that&#39;s clear!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know your kids, obviously, but I would be curious to know how *they* use words with other people. IOW, do they use language that their friends are confused by or find offensive because they (the friends) haven&#39;t had 10, 14, & 16 yrs. worth of hearing them used to describe oneself?  It&#39;s hard for me to comprehend what effect it would have on a person to have been told for years that they&#39;re &#39;x&#39;(fill in your word which means it&#39;s some trait that needs changing).<br/>
I remember hearing as a child, *repeatedly*, that I couldn&#39;t learn; that I wasn&#39;t a smart kid. That did *lots* of damage to me and I grew to believe those words. Instead of focusing on what I could not do, I wish someone had focused on what I *could* do. <br/>
So, back to the reading thing... if it&#39;s something my dd cannot do well, I can try to *help* her do better but at the same time, I absolutely *have* to keep my focus her natural abilities  and go from there. <br/>

No, they don&#39;t have trouble communicating with others.  In fact, <br/>
Rachel was complimented by a local college&#39;s admissions counselor on <br/>
her ability to communicate well.  What my kids have (all three of <br/>
them) is an advanced set of linguistic registers (see definition <br/>
below) for their respective ages.<br/>
It&#39;s funny because I never really thought about it before.  I never <br/>
actively taught them situational language but they have picked it up <br/>
in a way many people never do. <br/>
<br/>
register (LANGUAGE STYLE)noun [C/U] SPECIALIZED <br/>
the style of language, grammar and words used for particular <br/>
situations <br/>
People chatting at a party will usually be talking in (an) informal <br/>
register.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Typically, the term linguistic regsiter is used to describe the<br/>
specialized language used by people of a certain occupation, or with a<br/>
certain specialized interest... lepidopterists have a linguistic<br/>
register, for example, and so do philatelists, or physicians. Calling<br/>
your families, um, quirky ways of defining words a linguistic register is<br/>
stretching it. Also, typically a group&#39;s lingustic register won&#39;t involve<br/>
defining a word similarly to the way the rest of the world uses it,<br/>
except without any negative connotations. <br/>
