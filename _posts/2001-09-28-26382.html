<div id="ygrps-yiv-466605415">&lt;&lt; In what circumstances do you think school-at-home would be better for any<br/>
kid than unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When a parent has no imagination whatsoever and no willingness to take a <br/>
child anywhere interesting or get him any games, or when the parents says <br/>
&quot;That is STUPID&quot; about movies, books, magazines, games, music, art that the <br/>
child likes.<br/>
<br/>
(The question wasn&#39;t directed at me, but I have seen families which couldn&#39;t <br/>
have unschooled, but the kid was bright enough he could have learned on his <br/>
own in some structured fashion for the purpose of then getting OUT of that <br/>
&quot;home.&quot;  And in such cases, I&#39;d think school might be better than the <br/>
homeschooling, depending on the kid.  If the kid had the social skills, <br/>
appearance and money to buy cool stuff--meaning if the kid could skim the <br/>
social ocean--school might be better.  If the kid had major impediments or <br/>
bully-magnetism--physical, mental, emotional, social--then I think structure <br/>
would beat school.)<br/>
<br/>
[quote from a different post; I know]<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really resent the implication that because I dont have this belief that I <br/>
am dishonest or pretending. . . that is total lack of respect for anothers <br/>
views.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As opposed to the assertion/suggestion here that those who think some things <br/>
ARE better than others are just not sufficiently evolved?  (or didn&#39;t read <br/>
that one book?)  So add to insufficiently evolved, showing a total lack of <br/>
respect for others.  That is neither true  nor fair.  It is dramatic, though, <br/>
and if the goal is drama it worked.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think the goal is logic, but maybe I&#39;m wrong.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one (myself included) said that, no one(myself included) implied that to <br/>
my knowledge. I  believe you are talking about me and the Conversations with <br/>
God book. . . I offered it up as a possibility. Not that anyone would be more <br/>
evolved by having that belief system or reading that book. . . just as a <br/>
possibility some may want to consider if so inclined, just as you talk about <br/>
books, ideas or whatever that inspire you. <br/>
<br/>
The only place you are getting this idea about &quot;not being as evolved&quot;  is <br/>
from your own mind because I never put that out there. What is this about? <br/>
You said it was not a personal conversation, yet you continue to pick apart <br/>
my words and make it appear as though I am saying something I am not. <br/>
<br/>
I offered the information about what I believe to be true for me, what I <br/>
believe in, yet you continually pick it apart and put words in my mouth and <br/>
try to find errors in what I am saying. If this is not personal I don&#39;t  know <br/>
what is.  I love some of the things you have to say, I have told you so in <br/>
personal email. . . I have said so onlist when I felt so inclined. Yet, <br/>
anytime I disagree with you, you pounce on me. Please don&#39;t insult me by <br/>
saying you aren&#39;t having a conversation with me. . . you are by posting my <br/>
words and then saying they mean something other than what I actually said. I <br/>
really would love to be able to come to some kind of an understanding on <br/>
this. . . I have no wish to bicker back and forth, being accused of things <br/>
that aren&#39;t true. My intent has been to explain my viewpoint and have it <br/>
respected as that.  I don&#39;t think that is too much to ask. . . however, when <br/>
someone says I am dishonest and pretending in having my beliefs, I  sure am <br/>
going to speak out about it. That is not drama. . . that is truth. <br/>

an unschooling parent is to support the child&#39;s interests and give him<br/>
opportunities to learn about different things, and someone not doing that<br/>
is not unschooling, but neglecting. <br/>

&gt; the only one who can answer them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was not a questioning I was replying to. . . it was this statement <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I do think, though, that there are some things that are just better, and<br/>
pretending otherwise is dishonest. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure  this statement reflects a desire to understand. . .I could be <br/>
wrong but to me it says I am dishonest if I don&#39;t believe in the betterness <br/>
theory.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The philosophy seems to be saying in a way what the Indian greeting<br/>
&gt; &quot;Namaste&quot; says: &quot;I honor that place in you where the whole Universe resides.<br/>
&gt; And when I am in that place in me and you are in that place in you, there is<br/>
&gt; only one of us.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can see how getting people to a place where they can feel that everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; soul is equal would be a peacefilled place. I can see respecting that people<br/>
&gt; are where they are because their journey has been much different. I can see<br/>
&gt; how someone feeling pride that their position is superior to other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; could make the prideful person stop growing and self-examining.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can see that judgementalism and pride can lead to some unhealthy places.<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;m not seeing how eliminating judgementalism and pride -- if that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what this philosophy is about -- doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s own pitfalls. (Which is<br/>
&gt; all that people are asking in their own way.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; How would your philosophy handle abusive, hurtful parenting and nurturing<br/>
&gt; parenting? I can&#39;t see how one isn&#39;t better than the other. How can eating<br/>
&gt; food not be better than eating sand? How can music not be better than<br/>
&gt; fingernails on a chalkboard?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By perception. The way I handle abusive parenting is by reaching out to the <br/>
parent (still very difficult for me to do, although my husband is great at <br/>
it) and offering a helping hand. You may not be able to see how one isn&#39;t <br/>
better, because you are not in that situation. . . you are not on THAT <br/>
particular soul&#39;s journey. I don&#39;t know what those two souls may be working <br/>
on on a cosmic scale. . . some particular lesson or growth they may be trying <br/>
to accomplish. It doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t step in and offer assistance, as that <br/>
may be my role in observing them. . . but I cannot say that I personally am <br/>
better than that parent, because to me, I simply am not. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Too often, I think, people judge things on a limited number of factors, eg,<br/>
&gt; a more expensive bigger house is better than a less expensive smaller house.<br/>
&gt; Yet there are hundreds of factors that could make the smaller house more<br/>
&gt; suitable in a particular situation. How does the philosophy avoid<br/>
&gt; acknowledging that more suitable isn&#39;t better? That pros outweighing cons<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t better?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I have answered that several times already. I&#39;m going to post <br/>
something that explains it a bit further in another email. Thanks for the way <br/>
you posed your questions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would you offer the same assistance to everyone who is parenting differently<br/>
than you are? Why offer assistance to an abusive parent if you don&#39;t feel<br/>
there&#39;s some problem with the path they are on, eg, a *better* way for them<br/>
to be? Do you need to wait for them to ask?<br/>
<br/>
Or is this all just a way of eliminating superior words of good/bad and<br/>
better/worse and using more descriptive terminology like nurturing/hurtful<br/>
and supportive/neglectful? I can see that. I never tell my daughter she&#39;s<br/>
good since that&#39;s too vague. I say things like helpful or thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
And yet how can anyone ever intervene in a hurtful situation without making<br/>
a judgement that being loving is better than being hurtful? Can we step in<br/>
to stop injustice without sending the message that justice is better than<br/>
injustice?<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the pitfall of not judging, of stopping oneself from feeling<br/>
this is better than that. (I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s possible to be totally<br/>
nonjudgemental, but I&#39;m open to someone trying to explain it. *And* explain<br/>
how this type of viewpoint won&#39;t allow injustice to continue.)<br/>
<br/>
For example, if someone is being mean to someone because they are black or<br/>
Jewish, if being nice is equal to being mean, doesn&#39;t that eliminate a<br/>
reason to intervene?<br/>
<br/>
I feel I&#39;m perfectly capable of understanding that a bigot has reasons for<br/>
being a bigot without stopping myself from feeling being kind is better than<br/>
being mean. I&#39;m also capable of feeling my religion is better than other<br/>
religions without feeling that I&#39;m superior or needing to force my beliefs<br/>
on anyone of different beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand if someone finds it difficult to separate feeling what they<br/>
have is better from feeling others are less worthy of the oxygen they<br/>
breathe that eliminating good/bad could be a useful place to view the world<br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
But, I guess, I don&#39;t see judging things as better/worse as the root cause<br/>
of a &quot;superiority complex&quot;. I think the cause comes from assuming that<br/>
someone who is making different choices is lacking in knowledge or<br/>
compassion. I don&#39;t think the answer lies in eliminating good/bad,<br/>
black/white thinking, but in person with the &quot;superiority complex&quot; gaining<br/>
knowledge about how the other person can think the way they do and<br/>
compassion through that knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I think by eliminating the better/worse thinking, that leaves a vacuum that<br/>
people *could* fill with understanding and compassion. I don&#39;t know that<br/>
it&#39;s a given, though. I think it could also be filled with distancing from<br/>
one another. Live and let live.<br/>
<br/>
I used to participate in the Point/Counterpoint folder of AOL&#39;s<br/>
homeschooling board. I debated with a *lot* of fundamentalist Christians. I<br/>
came to understand how they believe as they do. It took a lot of work to<br/>
gain that knowledge. And because I understood them, I could understand how<br/>
others also have good (to them) reasons for why they do things.<br/>
<br/>
To me the elimination of better/worse feels like someone&#39;s idea of a short<br/>
cut past the knowledge to just accepting that everyone has good (to them)<br/>
reasons. But I&#39;m not confident that the longer journey isn&#39;t necessary for<br/>
many or most people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to make as clear as possible what *I&#39;m* talking about but I&#39;m<br/>
still not certain that we&#39;re talking about the same thing. We may be<br/>
defining words differently so even though we&#39;re each using common words,<br/>
they may not be conveying the meaning we intend.<br/>

<br/>
Is that what *this* conversation is about? I guess I&#39;m having a different<br/>
converstation. Won&#39;t be the first time! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
*If* someone offers a suggestion here on a list clearly marked as<br/>
unschooling which isn&#39;t unschooling, I&#39;ll speak up. *If* someone insists<br/>
that something they do in their own family is unschooling when I don&#39;t<br/>
believe it is, I&#39;ll speak up. *If* someone says something that contradicts<br/>
what they&#39;re saying (eg, this is not coercive when the example looks to me<br/>
like being coercive) I&#39;ll speak up. (And if someone offers a coercive<br/>
parenting suggestion, some will speak up and offer less coercive<br/>
suggestions, because to some people that is also part of unschooling and to<br/>
others it isn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
I believe those *if*s have happened when people did object to a suggestion<br/>
or relate something from their life. So if people are saying that, it&#39;s only<br/>
part of the picture. If some people aren&#39;t understanding that, then it&#39;s<br/>
probably contributing to the confusion and it&#39;s no wonder no one can<br/>
understand what the objection is.<br/>
