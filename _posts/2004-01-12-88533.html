<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589660924">Another idea would be to find a way to frame them individually and hang them <br/>
all over the bathroom (or other room). This idea would allow you to rotate the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My grandparents have their guest bathroom with little mirrors, all in pretty<br/>
frames, just like this.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a great idea, and I, too am now thinking of doing something like this.<br/>
<br/>
In my first apartment that was mine, all mine and no one else&#39;s, I had a<br/>
wall just like this--I taped brown craft paper to the wall and went to town.<br/>
All those bumper stickers I didn&#39;t have a bumper for.  All those fun things<br/>
my friends said.  All those wonderful things I read somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a marvelous idea, there are plenty of ways to hang it that won&#39;t damage<br/>
walls, and I&#39;m gonna do it again!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749436361">Good idea Laura but I have so many quotes. It&#39;d cost me a fortune in<br/>

you could use a plain light colored wallpaper and just write on it.<br/>
<br/>
By problems down the road I was thinking about trying to remove different <br/>
kinds of paper. Make sure whatever you do that you first prepare the walls with a <br/>
primer. You mean you would just paint over it all later? I think maybe that <br/>
stuff is called Kilz or something like that. Walls look better if you remove <br/>
the old paper. However  these are just the thoughts of someone who is married to <br/>
the business, LOL<br/>

    I hadn&#39;t thought of all the different papers, thanks. I have to take the<br/>
wallpaper in the bath down anyway, it&#39;s really dark. Putting up a light<br/>
color and writing on it, now that would work. The computer room is already<br/>
an off white color paint.<br/>
<br/>
    Robyn thanks for the tips to keep them straight. The painted walls<br/>
aren&#39;t textured and I&#39;ll be extra carefull picking wallpaper for the bath.<br/>
I&#39;ve never wallpapered before so this will be a whole new experience. I&#39;ve<br/>
heard fabric softener removes the old paper and glue well. Anyone tryed<br/>
that? :-)<br/>

If it&#39;s fairly recent wallpaper it&#39;s probably &quot;strippable&quot;, which means you<br/>
can peal the top of the paper off just by grabbing an edge and pulling.  The<br/>
the rest of the paper and the glue would still be on the wall.  Spray it<br/>
with plain water, wait about five minutes, then peal it off too.  Wash the<br/>
walls and you&#39;re ready to go.  If it&#39;s really old wallpaper, call in a<br/>
professional.  (You don&#39;t really have too, but non-strippable wallpaper is a<br/>
b*tch to get off.) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree about the bitch part! Our previous house was only 4 years old and in<br/>
some places had 3 layers of wallpaper. (The guy was one of the contractors<br/>
in the development. I *hope* he was the wallpaper guy because, though he was<br/>
excessive in his need to repaper and his need to buy cheap, ugly paper, he<br/>
did a good job. But the repairs he did around the house really stunk!)<br/>
<br/>
But you can rent a steamer made specifically for that purpose. It looks like<br/>
a vaccuum with a pad at the end that you hold over an area and get it<br/>
soaked. Then you scrape the wall with wide bladed putty knife.<br/>
<br/>
You can also do it by hand, wetting a part of the wall with a sponge and<br/>
letting it soak in and then scraping. I honestly don&#39;t know that the steamer<br/>
helped that much but it might depend on the paper.<br/>
<br/>
I also had to soak and scrape some of the walls repeatedly after all the<br/>
paper was off because the glue was really heavy.<br/>
