&lt;&lt; Was this list set up for all unschoolers or just<br/>
long-timers.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fans of John Holt.&quot;<br/>
I assumed by that description that it would be people who had already read <br/>
Holt, and therefor not beginners.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling.com is a GREAT source for new unschoolers.  I hold people&#39;s hands <br/>
there and tell them their children really will learn to read.  I wasn&#39;t <br/>
expecting to do that here.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If newbies didn&#39;t post and just read how would<br/>
newbie&#39;s questions get answered?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe by just reading?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if a newbie had<br/>
a burning question that maybe old news to long-timers?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
None of this involved a newbie&#39;s burning question.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I do think that if a<br/>
not-so-confident newbie read it, they may not feel<br/>
comfortable asking a question or stating an opinion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say none, I said &quot;less.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;but those with less experience<br/>
should probably do more <br/>
reading and less writing at first, at least.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I walk up to a conversation in progress, I listen a while.  Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
not the sort of thing I can or should get into.  Maybe it is.  But I wait, <br/>
and see how it&#39;s going.  And if I did join it, I wouldn&#39;t totally change the <br/>
subject and ignore all indications that it wasn&#39;t appreiciated.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I feel that would be a shame for this list and could<br/>
possibly make it a bit stagnant, with only the<br/>
&#39;experienced&#39; unschoolers choosing the subjects<br/>
discussed. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WHY would it be (a strong word) SHAME?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this group will be stagnant.  I don&#39;t think experienced <br/>
unschoolers discussing things would feel stagnant at all.  And there are TONS <br/>
of unschooling lists, sites and forums, I&#39;m pretty sure.<br/>
<br/>
Is it our duty to help new unschoolers?  I know of not one of the &quot;old <br/>
timers&quot; here who has not put in hundreds or thousands of hours doing so, and <br/>
most are still doing it.  I got a newsletter just today written and mailed <br/>
out by Carol Narigon.  She&#39;s been helping other unschoolers since Holly <br/>
couldn&#39;t speak English.  What if Carol and I and some of our other veteran <br/>
friends wanted to have a list where we could be with other experienced <br/>
unschoolers?  Would that be a shame?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And this subject may have never come up if a newbie<br/>
hadn&#39;t posted about it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems the same subjects do come up every six months or so.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I, personally, haven&#39;t been tracking all of it because<br/>
I&#39;ve been busy and the sheer volume has been<br/>
overwhelming for me right now (I&#39;m still days behind!)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was a shame in itself, that the volume of posts surpassed previous <br/>
members&#39; ability to keep up with them. But it will pass, and live will go on.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am grateful for all the insight and awareness of the<br/>
more experienced unschoolers on this list have to<br/>
offer, but does that mean that the rest of us have<br/>
nothing meaningful to offer or contribute? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This has been discussed to death, sorry.  Contribute it!!<br/>
Let&#39;s stop talking about WHETHER people have meaningful things to contribute <br/>
and read these meaningful contributions.<br/>

You are absolutely right. <br/>
Like I said, I&#39;m seriously behind on my reading and I<br/>
should know better by now than to post such delayed<br/>
replies. <br/>
Unfortunately, there are probably quite a few other<br/>
delayed replies coming (most of them silly and they&#39;ll<br/>
all probably come on the same digest!).<br/>
