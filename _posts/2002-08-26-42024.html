<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544967372">Today is happy, happy not-back-to-school day for us!<br/>
<br/>
And better yet, I have finally convinced my neighbor who had serious doubts<br/>
about sending her daughter to the school here that she didn&#39;t HAVE to send<br/>
her child to school!  Her daughter is so, so happy; she really did not want<br/>
to go to kindergarten, she wanted to stay home &quot;like Tim&quot; (my son).<br/>
<br/>
Horray, another homeschooler in my life!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719719102">Today my brother is taking his three kids to get haricuts, to the office<br/>
store to find the list of items the kids are all required to have (About $20<br/>
per kid - ouch! but one can&#39;t forget that box of Kleenex!) Setting all the<br/>
backpacks up (Emily put on the oldest&#39;s BP and fell backwards like an upside<br/>
down turtle) buying lunch supplies, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
Today we are packing a lunch and heading to a beautiful lakeside beach in<br/>
the mountains of central Maryland with my Mom and a number of joyful, stress<br/>
free, wonderful families for our annual Not Back To School Picnic & Swim.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;ll have the better day.<br/>
