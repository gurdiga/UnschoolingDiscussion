I think the idea of handling unschooling critics with this kind of humor<br/>
is brilliant.  I would so like to be this kind of person.  I&#39;m afraid my<br/>
first instinct is to go for the jugular, which can be a little messy at a<br/>
holiday table.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for opening my eyes to a new possibility!  <br/>
<br/>
You chimps are all right.<br/>
