<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788887646">I came across this in today&#39;s NYTimes interview with Anne Tyler,  who <br/>
wrote Accidental Tourist, Breathing Lessons, Amateur Marriage -- <br/>
 <br/>
Q - Food plays an important role in the books. What is it about food, family <br/>
dinners, sharing a meal? <br/>
<br/>
A - &quot;I&#39;m amazed at the number of times someone says, describing how some <br/>
crisis began, `Well, we were just sitting around the supper table.&#39; Surely it <br/>
can&#39;t all be coincidence. And people&#39;s attitudes toward food reveal so much about <br/>
them. Are they feeders or hoarders? Enjoyers or self-deniers? Food is a very <br/>
handy tool for any writer interested in character.&quot;<br/>

       BTW, I found it interesting that she doesn&#39;t do signings or meet face <br/>
to face --email interviews only, she grew up Quaker in the rural South, and <br/>
she says her real heroes are the ones who can endure, grant privacy to others <br/>
around them, and yet manage to produce some warmth.  :) JJ<br/>
