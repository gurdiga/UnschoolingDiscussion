<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196688575">&lt;&lt;I still wouldn&#39;t let my child play with a dog that has a tendency to<br/>
bite&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on the dog, the kid, and the circumstances.  We have 2<br/>
dogs that are litter mates, obtained from a no-kill shelter and in poor<br/>
health.  The female is a psycho dog.  She used to be very aggressive to the<br/>
male and will occasionally growl and bark at imaginary things.  She has<br/>
never bit one of the kids.<br/>
<br/>
The male is happy-go-lucky.  He has bit my kids on 3 occasions.  Twice were<br/>
accidents, everybody playing in the sprinkler, the dog biting at the water<br/>
and caught on ankle.  He bit my 8yo once on purpose but not with intent to<br/>
cause the injury.  8yo and dog were really roughhousing with a toy and 8yo<br/>
grabbed the toy and ducked it under his chin.  Dog bit to get the toy back,<br/>
like he would do to another dog.<br/>
<br/>
If I were going to worry about injury, I worry about the female.  For the<br/>
male, we talk to the kids about not playing so rowdy with him because he<br/>
inadvertently hurts people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534040050">We had a Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound) that had been abused.  We were driving<br/>
down the road one day and say a dog chained inside this little open fronted<br/>
shed.  She was about 9 months old.  She had exactly enough length of chain<br/>
to sit down but not lay down.  Her neck was a mess, not only raw but the<br/>
bugs had been visiting.<br/>
<br/>
We &quot;bought&quot; her and took her home and took care of her injuries.  However,<br/>
for the rest of her life if you pulled on her neck she would snap.  this was<br/>
a reflex.  She would let go as soon as she realised that she had hold of a<br/>
human body that wasn&#39;t trying to hurt her.  She never broke the skin but she<br/>
bit a whole bunch of people.<br/>
<br/>
We eventually gave her to a woman that raised sheep that the coyotes had<br/>
been getting too and Just Plain Kate became a sheep guardian, which she was<br/>
very good at!<br/>
<br/>
My son (6 at the time) was more hysterical over giving her away than when<br/>
she bit him.  And he was hysterical then because he thought she would get in<br/>
trouble, not because she bit him.<br/>
<br/>
It just really depends on the dog and how/why they bite.  It also always<br/>
amazed me that no matter how many times we explained to folks that they<br/>
couldn&#39;t pull on her collar or leash, they always did it.<br/>
