<div id="ygrps-yiv-486306094">This just reminded me of a fun math-y game that we play on the subway by <br/>
looking at the numbers on our tickets:<br/>
<br/>
take any four numbers, from  0 to 9 , and add, subtract, divide, <br/>
multiply or find square roots to give a sum of &quot;10&quot;. You could use it <br/>
for license plates while driving to the conference, maybe?<br/>
