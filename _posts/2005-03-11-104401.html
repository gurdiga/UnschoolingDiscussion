<div id="ygrps-yiv-592338485">We can  still ride for an hour in the car having only sporadic occasional <br/>
functional  sentences uttered (mostly by me), but I have been asking him whether <br/>
he wants  music, or talking, or time to think. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
I would hate to be asked. BIGtime.<br/>
I don&#39;t want someone to ask me whether I want to talk or think.<br/>
 <br/>
When I get in the car, if the other person is talking, we talk.  If  the <br/>
other person turns the radio on or asks for a tape or CD or whatever, we do  that. <br/>
 If osmoene says something while the music&#39;s on and it&#39;s short and  <br/>
incidental to what we&#39;re seeing or it&#39;s quick, the music stays on.  If it&#39;s  something <br/>
that needs real conversation, I turn the music down or off.<br/>
 <br/>
Having to declare in advance whether one wants music, talk or quiet is  <br/>
unnatural and seems more likely to cause stress than peace.  <br/>
