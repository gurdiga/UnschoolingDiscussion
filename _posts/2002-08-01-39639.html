<div id="ygrps-yiv-114477652">Unschoolers and others,<br/>
<br/>
There is a protest against phonics among us. Why? Must I apologize for<br/>
stating facts? My posts are not for everyone. If you have your own ideas,<br/>
fine. Mine are for others. Also, I&#39;m not talking about particular children<br/>
or your children who have learned things seemingly by magic,  but the vast<br/>
numbers of &quot;average&quot; kids who want to learn to read and are ready and need<br/>
to be shown HOW....right NOW, or sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Even though some kids seem to pick it up by osmosis, they are learning<br/>
skills. It is not magic. The skills (collectively) are called Phonics. I<br/>
agree that it does not always require teaching, and certainly not<br/>
factory-style rote repetitions. But when teaching is requested, it needs to<br/>
be right; it needs to be useful; it needs to provide skills, and today it<br/>
needs to be fast and easy.<br/>
<br/>
It needs to be phonics...the nuts and bolts of reading.<br/>
<br/>
English is a phonetic language. It was designed (imperfectly due to<br/>
complications in England with other languages in use there) as a compromise<br/>
between Latin and northern European tongues, and several forces have<br/>
influenced the evolution of modern American English. That doesn&#39;t change the<br/>
basic  simple fact...the letters stand for spoken sounds.<br/>
<br/>
The idea (the discovery) behind English is phonetics. In order to read, we<br/>
MUST be able to turn printed letters into sounds -- whether they are spoken<br/>
or silently &quot;read&quot; to ourselves. Until a child can do that, reading is not<br/>
happening.<br/>
<br/>
To repeat: If we can read this, we are using phonics to do it (not something<br/>
else).<br/>
<br/>
Phonics and Phonetics:<br/>
Phonics is a method of learning to read by learning the phonetic value<br/>
(sounds) of letters and groups of letters. Phonetics is the study of speech<br/>
sounds -- the sounds of languages. For my purpose here, those are virtually<br/>
interchangable -- with distinctions, but not differences.<br/>
<br/>
If there are other concepts about learning to read, fine, but they do not<br/>
tell us HOW to read. The ability to read, unlike the abilities of walking<br/>
and talking, requires specific knowledge. It&#39;s not esoteric, or difficult,<br/>
but it is specific.  Unlike walking and talking our native tongue, reading<br/>
is not &quot;natural,&quot; it is a sophisticated skill.<br/>
<br/>
All the &quot;motivation&quot; in the world does not teach us to read. We can be<br/>
surrounded by books and such, but that doesn&#39;t give us the skill that&#39;s<br/>
needed. All such &quot;immersion&quot; is mere therapy. Many are not &quot;getting&quot; it<br/>
today, and those kids end up in a growing disaster -- special ed. It&#39;s not<br/>
instruction in skills. We don&#39;t usually throw children into deep pools to<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; them to swim. Hey, it has worked, but there&#39;s a down side for too<br/>
many.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra sends this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;VA HUSPEDEL WILL CALL DAD TO REE SKEGUEL MRI&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(translation: VA hospital will call Dad to re-schedule MRI)<br/>
Little Holly, who took that telephone message, knows that in order to write,<br/>
she needs to use letters to represents sounds. She did a great job. She<br/>
proved that she knew the principles of phonics. She can learn to spell some<br/>
other time, if she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
My point is this: Holly would not have been able to write the message if she<br/>
had not had the skill and knowledge she had. I am not suggesting that<br/>
parents sit down and torture their kids with rote learning or even gentle<br/>
persuasion. I am also not suggesting that people not surround their kids<br/>
with motivations to read and write. (Literacy is vital to survival in our<br/>
society)  I am simply stating the facts of how the English language works.<br/>
<br/>
All the &quot;exceptions&quot; that are cited seem to be used in trying to prove that<br/>
phonics is not a fact, but they are still merely exceptions to the rules.<br/>
The vast majority of English words follow the simple patterns of its<br/>
origins.  Who doesn&#39;t know that there are exceptions?<br/>
<br/>
I am not talking about &quot;why&quot; a child reads or should learn to read. It<br/>
really doesn&#39;t matter why. What matters is HOW to do it. The HOW is<br/>
phonics...Letters stand for sounds...make the simple connection between<br/>
letters and sounds and Bingo, I can read. If I don&#39;t make that connection, I<br/>
can&#39;t.  Can anyone tell us another way?<br/>
<br/>
No. So why is there any argument?<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I&#39;m writing this is so that when children ask about learning<br/>
how to read, parents and others will know how to help them. Sure, read to<br/>
them for motivation, show them the necessity of reading in order to learn<br/>
about the world, let them know the joys and satisfactions that come from<br/>
reading, etc. But when they want to know HOW, they need the specific skill<br/>
that comes from knowing that letters stand for sounds. They need to know the<br/>
letters and their related sounds.<br/>
<br/>
What separates a kid who can read from one who can&#39;t read. One knows the<br/>
connection between letters and sounds; the other doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
They need to know. It doesn&#39;t mean that they need to be taught. Many kids,<br/>
including mine, learned it on their own. BUT THEY DID LEARN IT, because<br/>
without it, they can&#39;t read. Sounding out (decoding the print) is a first<br/>
step, and soon children get so good at it that they don&#39;t notice that<br/>
they&#39;re doing it. They have advanced their skills into fluency and<br/>
understanding. <br/>
<br/>
I am not talking about &quot;interpreting&quot; or, as WL enthusiasts say,<br/>
&quot;constructing meaning.&quot; I am talking about finding out, as exactly as<br/>
possible, what the author is saying -- accurate transmission of particular<br/>
words -- that&#39;s the purpose of written language. Interpreting is needed when<br/>
trying to understand pictographic languages (such as Chinese) in which<br/>
pictures (characters) stand for ideas, not specific words. Try drawing a<br/>
picture of Truth, or Freedom, or polite or desperate...and you&#39;ll see that<br/>
words work better.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m not talking about &quot;understanding&quot; what is read. That depends on<br/>
the experience of the reader. Understanding is a level beyond simple<br/>
reading, but reading comes first. We cannot &quot;understand&quot; what we can&#39;t<br/>
decipher (read). <br/>
<br/>
Someone asked if I have ever been a school teacher. Yes. Two years in<br/>
elementary grades; one year high school -- all grades, most subjects,<br/>
private schools; one year college -- continuing ed (adults). My professional<br/>
training (and part-time career) was/is in architecture, and I have had many<br/>
occupations.<br/>
<br/>
For those who might be interested in the origins of writing, and therefore<br/>
reading, I would advise going to any good encyclopedia. There you will find,<br/>
as I have, that phonics is not just a fad or a fancy that modern &quot;theories&quot;<br/>
of schooling can discard as &quot;out of fashion&quot; or &quot;no longer useful&quot; in a<br/>
world of therapy and excuses. Phonics is the basis of the English language.<br/>
<br/>
For those who want some facts about the world of Whole Language and its<br/>
equally evil twin, Outcome Based Education (OBE), I suggest the book, &quot;The<br/>
OBE/Whole Language Fraud,&quot; by Samuel Blumenfeld...available from Paradigm<br/>
Books. Blumenfeld also clears up the myth that people from New Zealand<br/>
&quot;invented&quot; Whole Language, and that it was successful there. It was the same<br/>
failure there that it was in Israel, USSR, Cuba, and is today in our<br/>
country. California has recently changed back from WL to phonics-based<br/>
reading instruction because of the massive failure of WL that took the state<br/>
from near the top to the very bottom in just ten years. Trouble is, they<br/>
need to retrain the teachers -- that&#39;s the hard part.<br/>
<br/>
Blumenfeld also tells the true history of the origin of Whole Language in a<br/>
book called &quot;The New Illiterates.&quot;  It was developed in about 1903 to teach<br/>
deaf people to read. Phonetic languages are difficult for people who can&#39;t<br/>
hear or speak, since they have no concept of sound. Whole Language connected<br/>
words to pictures, allowing a person to make a connection between print and<br/>
the real world. It became popular in public schools in the twenties as<br/>
&quot;look-say,&quot; but it is extremely limited, and as a learning method for<br/>
hearing people it can be debilitating. Today, critics mockingly call it<br/>
&quot;Look-Say-Fail.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The great &quot;success&quot; of WL is that it feeds millions of kids into Special<br/>
Education -- a fraud even worse, and more damaging, than the Whole Language<br/>
mistakes it is purported to cure.<br/>

<br/>
What you stated was not all factual.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not protest against phonics.  It&#39;s objection to the claim that phonics <br/>
is more than just one of many tools readers use to decipher written English.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Even though some kids seem to pick it up by osmosis, they are learning<br/>
skills. It is not magic.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, it is real, honestly  natural learning and involves more than one skill.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But when teaching is requested, it needs to<br/>
be right; it needs to be useful; it needs to provide skills, and today it<br/>
needs to be fast and easy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When questions are asked, they can be answered without being a course in <br/>
phonics.  If it&#39;s a phonics question, great!  If phonics games are played, <br/>
great!  <br/>
<br/>
WHY does it need to be fast and easy?<br/>
<br/>
Why does it need to be fast?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It was designed (imperfectly due to<br/>
complications in England with other languages in use there) as a compromise<br/>
between Latin and northern European tongues,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t designed.  It evolved.  It is not a compromise.  It is a living <br/>
language with a rich and still-evident history.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Unlike walking and talking our native tongue, reading<br/>
is not &quot;natural,&quot; it is a sophisticated skill.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Speaking a language is very sophisticated.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;All such &quot;immersion&quot; is mere therapy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That immersion is real life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Many are not &quot;getting&quot; it<br/>
today, and those kids end up in a growing disaster -- special ed. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many kids don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; phonics.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We don&#39;t usually throw children into deep pools to<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; them to swim. Hey, it has worked, but there&#39;s a down side for too<br/>
many.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And neither has anyone here thrown their children into a deep pool of <br/>
language and left them to d. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly picked up those sophisticated skills on her own, from immersion in <br/>
language, from playing, from asking questions, from reading, gradually, <br/>
without &quot;instruction.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not talking about &quot;why&quot; a child reads or should learn to read. It<br/>
really doesn&#39;t matter why. What matters is HOW to do it. The HOW is<br/>
phonics...Letters stand for sounds...make the simple connection between<br/>
letters and sounds and Bingo, I can read. If I don&#39;t make that connection, I<br/>
can&#39;t.  Can anyone tell us another way?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We apparently can tell it, but you apparently don&#39;t care to read it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No. So why is there any argument?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Because you&#39;re stuck and will not consider what others are telling you <br/>
IS happening in their homes on July 31, 2002.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What separates a kid who can read from one who can&#39;t read. One knows the<br/>
connection between letters and sounds; the other doesn&#39;t.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is simplistic and it isn&#39;t in a narrow and immediate sense true.<br/>
<br/>
I have kids who knew letters and their sounds years before they could read.  <br/>
I wasn&#39;t in a hurry and they weren&#39;t either.  JUST knowing phonics rules <br/>
isn&#39;t the same as reading.  And there are readers who don&#39;t &quot;know the rules.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Try drawing a<br/>
picture of Truth, or Freedom, or polite or desperate...and you&#39;ll see that<br/>
words work better.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well in ideographic writing systems, the picture and the word would have been <br/>
the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, I&#39;m not talking about &quot;understanding&quot; what is read. That depends on<br/>
the experience of the reader. Understanding is a level beyond simple<br/>
reading, but reading comes first. We cannot &quot;understand&quot; what we can&#39;t<br/>
decipher (read). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounding out words without comprehension isn&#39;t reading.  It&#39;s decoding.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Phonics is the basis of the English language.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like it would mean something, but it doesn&#39;t.  ALL spoken human <br/>
language is made up of sounds, and so phonics can be said to be the basis of <br/>
any language.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For those who want some facts about the world of Whole Language and its<br/>
equally evil twin, Outcome Based Education (OBE), I suggest...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a list of 850 people whose kids don&#39;t go to school (with a few <br/>
exceptions), who are unschoolers almost all.   There&#39;s no need to badmouth <br/>
school here.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess I must be an illiterate ignoramus. I have absolutely no idea of what <br/>
the *phonic rules* are. I learned to read well before I ever went to school. <br/>
My first school was the American School in Iran and they *taught* us much the <br/>
same way my Mom had been *teaching* me at home. When we came to the States <br/>
and I started school here, phonics was part of the curriculum. I never could <br/>
*get it.* My teachers sent notes home, my Mom (who doesn&#39;t know phonics <br/>
either) tried to help me. Finally, after two agonizing years, my Mom told me <br/>
not to worry about it. She told me I could read (no matter what the teachers <br/>
said) and that if I failed phonics it didn&#39;t matter to her. What a relief! <br/>
I read well, have excellent comprehension skills and still have no idea what <br/>
phonics are about. I am sure phonics work for some, but for me it is not the <br/>
be all and end all of learning to read. To me, reading is magical. <br/>

But you aren&#39;t stating facts. That&#39;s why folks here disagree with you. Then there&#39;s your inability to correct yourself when errors are pointed out -- such as your persistence in confusing &quot;whole word&quot; with &quot;whole language&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
I went many years reading well above grade level, tested out of reading instruction in school (tested at grade 12+ level when in 2nd grade), and didn&#39;t learn to sound out words until I was in junior high school, when I needed a method to differentiate between similar-looking names in an archaeology book. <br/>
 <br/>
Both my children are sight-readers, as was my father. We are all self-taught, and all voracious readers. (And all three generations heard the same thing in school &quot;You read too much, it&#39;ll hurt your eyes.&quot;) <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone who can only read by sound has no conception of the process of sight-reading. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220416424"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;There is a protest against phonics among us. Why?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a protest against phonics. Just a suggestion that phonics do not always <br/>
have to be the first step in helping a child learn to read. Way before <br/>
phonics and letters there are things a parent can be doing. And if a child <br/>
is not getting letter/sound association, they can still be reading. I&#39;ve <br/>
seen it in my own child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Must I apologize for stating facts?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. But they are the facts as you see them. I&#39;ve seen those &quot;facts&quot; have a <br/>
very different effect on children when stated as the be all and end all of <br/>
reading. In fact, intensive phonics instruction has hurt many of our <br/>
children and hindered their reading progress.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My posts are not for everyone.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well they are publicly posted. That seems to mean they&#39;re open to everyone. <br/>
Some of us are simply disagreeing with the statement that the &quot;best&quot; or <br/>
maybe even only way to help a child to read is to start with phonics <br/>
instruction. We&#39;re simply stating the &quot;fact&quot; that some kids come to reading <br/>
through a back door and don&#39;t start that way at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Also, I&#39;m not talking about particular children or your children who have <br/>
&gt;&gt;learned things seemingly by magic&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow. Kind of a snarky comment on an unschooling list. I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; my <br/>

of a lot of homeschooled and schooled children&#39;s learning-to-read experience <br/>
--  early and too-intensive phonics instruction hurts many children by making <br/>
reading a tedious chore and results in many children being labeled as having <br/>
reading disabilities when what they really needed was more time and freedom <br/>
from pressure.<br/>

&gt; Wow. Kind of a snarky comment on an unschooling list. I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; my <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It can &quot;seem&quot; like magic, of course,  to those who think kids have to be <br/>
provided with some sort of systematic phonics instruction, when kids DO learn <br/>
in their own idiosyncratic ways without any direct phonics instruction at all <br/>
- it can seem like magic even to their parents. Almost all of us are taking a <br/>
little (or big) leap of faith by NOT using a &quot;program&quot; (at least with our <br/>
first child &lt;G&gt;) and it is exciting and amazing to us - just like magic - <br/>
when the kids not only learn to read,  they LOVE to read. AND - another <br/>
magical wonderful thing is that learning to read WITHOUT having been taught - <br/>
they&#39;ll always have that experience to draw upon - they&#39;ll always feel full <br/>
ownership of their own learning, not ever feel like they have to rely on <br/>
someone else for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331667363">&lt;I guess I must be an illiterate ignoramus. I have absolutely no idea of what <br/>
the *phonic rules* are.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here. After 35 years, I don&#39;t remember *how* I learned how to read <br/>
but, I do remember reading the insipid Dick and Jane.<br/>
<br/>
In my ongoing journey to unschooling, I&#39;ve taken some steps off the <br/>
beaten path and have tried to teach my now 9 yr old by intensive phonics <br/>
instruction.  (I apologize publicly now and I have to her also.)  :-)  I <br/>
used the Writing Road to Reading and I&#39;ve never been so confused in my <br/>
life!  How could I have been fluently reading (and spelling) all of <br/>
these years without it?  I promptly sold the book with a good luck/buyer <br/>
beware warning.<br/>
<br/>
I do find phonics rules interesting now at age 40, but only because *I* <br/>
want to learn more about them and also because I&#39;m fascinated at how I <br/>
learned to read, spell, and write without them.<br/>
<br/>
I do have three boys 14, 13, 12 who can read.  And I&#39;d have to say <br/>
almost magically as I don&#39;t know how it happened.  My 14 yr old read at <br/>
3.5 and was spelling things in mirror image with magnetic letters on the <br/>
fridge at 4.  The other two learned around 6.  My 9 yr old is just now <br/>
reading some and she&#39;s known the sounds for years.  My 6 yr old da knows <br/>
the basic letter sounds and has no idea how to put them together.  I&#39;m <br/>
in no hurry and she doesn&#39;t appear to be either.  But this *peace* on my <br/>
part has been long coming.  I guess I&#39;m just slow on the learning curve.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015261026">When we talk about math here, many people have said and shown that when a <br/>
child needs to know something, he can learn it.  Until it has a real <br/>
application, or until the very moment has come that 5% or 10% won&#39;t do it, <br/>
they need to know 6.8%, then it&#39;s not the time that that learning will seem <br/>
meaningful.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;ve talked about reading in the same way.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids learn in various ways, in starts and fits, with spurts and lulls, and <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; them something like a silent &quot;e&quot; at the end of &quot;like&quot; makes a long <br/>
&quot;i&quot; is like showing someone how to set up a division &quot;problem&quot; without <br/>
actually having any reason to divide.<br/>
<br/>
My kids figured out multiplication by &quot;skip counting&quot; and goofing around with <br/>
pennies and stuff, and by me giving them a blank multiplication table for <br/>
them to fill in if they wanted to, as a puzzle.  I didn&#39;t give them <br/>
terminology or time limits or reasons.  It was fun for its own sake.  And <br/>
they discovered the cool patterns of fives and nines and twos and threes all <br/>
on their own.<br/>
<br/>
When kids learn to read in the &quot;whatever/however&quot; way, they discover the <br/>
differences between hat, fat and rat and hate, fate and rate on their own.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t take long, it&#39;s not rocket science, and it doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
called &quot;phonics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it did not help ONE BIT when I was a kid and reading comic books and <br/>
trying to pronounce in my head &quot;Yosemite Sam.&quot;  Turns out, I discovered after <br/>
a couple of years, that he name was NOT &quot;Yoze-might&quot; Sam.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224086294">When I was little, my parents and older siblings read to me, following the <br/>
words with a finger as they did. By the time I was three, I was reading to <br/>
them. I did so by recognizing repeating patterns of letters. Gradually, I <br/>
learned to read more and more complex words, without ever realizing that <br/>
there was any direct connection between the letters on the page and the <br/>
sounds they made.<br/>
<br/>
In second and third grades, they taught us to read, using phonics. I <br/>
distinctly remember the day that I realized that the individual letters <br/>
represented sounds rather than being part of an abstract pattern that <br/>
represented both the sound and the meaning of a word. It was quite an <br/>
epiphany, and the start of a lifelong fascination with the mechanics and <br/>
evolution of language.<br/>
<br/>
Am I a better reader for having learned phonics? Perhaps. Has it enhanced my <br/>
enjoyment of reading? Definitely. Was it essential in learning to read? Heck <br/>
no--by the time I learned phonics, I&#39;d been reading for years.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I watched my son go through a similar process when he taught himself to <br/>
read at about the same age.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yesterday one of the kids asked me how to pronounce &quot;caste.&quot; She&#39;d just heard <br/>
someone use it in context and realized it was the same word she&#39;d always <br/>
assumed had a long &quot;a&quot; sound. Yes - we often do use phonics rules that we&#39;ve <br/>
figured out usually work - to sound out words we don&#39;t know - but it isn&#39;t <br/>
good enough, by itself, and doesn&#39;t have to be taught - it is an ability that <br/>
can just be picked up along the way.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter said: &quot;So the ONLY way to know how to pronounce that word is to <br/>
ask someone who knows (looking in the dictionary is just a way asking the <br/>
person who wrote it in there &lt;G&gt;)? It is just &quot;passed on&quot; from person to <br/>
person?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Yep. That&#39;s right.<br/>

Here is some information I got from Barnes & Noble (http://bn.com)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;ABOUT THIS ITEM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Annotation<br/>
&gt;Preschool to Grade Two. Bestselling children&#39;s author Betty Miles <br/>
&gt;reveals the secrets behind reading, one of life&#39;s most important and <br/>
&gt;enjoyable skills, in a &quot;how to&quot; book for children who are just <br/>
&gt;getting ready to learn how. Armed with confidence and aided by <br/>
&gt;exuberant, colorful illustrations, children will delight in <br/>
&gt;discovering that they are actually reading. The opening two sections <br/>
&gt;are about the process. The last section gives 19 selections to read <br/>
&gt;such as poems, knock-knock jokes, an alphabet of names, and a <br/>
&gt;double-page spread of a school scene with labels, dialogue balloons, <br/>
&gt;and a chalkboard message.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From the Publisher<br/>
&gt;Best-selling children&#39;s author Betty Miles reveals the secrets <br/>
&gt;behind one of life&#39;s most important and enjoyable skills in the <br/>
&gt;first-ever &quot;how to&quot; book for children who are just getting ready to <br/>
&gt;read-and for the parents, relatives, teachers, and friends who want <br/>
&gt;to help them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  From the Critics<br/>
&gt;From School Library Journal  <br/>
&gt;Sylvie Wickstrom&#39;s pictures are delightful. In a style somewhat <br/>
&gt;reminiscent of Janet and Allan Ahlberg&#39;s work, she populates the <br/>
&gt;pages with appealing multi-ethnic children and clearly rendered <br/>
&gt;animals and objects that illustrate verbal concepts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From Joanne Schott - Quill & Quire  <br/>
&gt;It has taken a long time for a book to appear that addresses pre- <br/>
&gt;and beginning readers directly, letting them know what reading is <br/>
&gt;all about. This one, from an educator and former editor of the Bank <br/>
&gt;Street Readers, does just that in a friendly, conversational way. . <br/>
&gt;. . The book is not designed to teach reading but to reassure and <br/>
&gt;encourage pre-readers and beginning readers by giving them <br/>
&gt;confidence. The text addresses the new reader directly and <br/>
&gt;personally. Sensible and unpretentious, it should be a real help in <br/>
&gt;demystifying reading. -- Quill & Quire<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sheila, I think it is fabulous. As the last paragraph suggests, it is <br/>
not a how-to book, but a book about boosting reading confidence for <br/>
both child and parent. Evan actually loved the book because it is <br/>
about what he already knows and not about what he is lacking in <br/>
knowledge; for example:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;When you talk, you say words. When you read, you read words [...] <br/>
&gt;You already know most of the words you&#39;re going to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the first part. The second part talks about the SIX WAYS (Ned, <br/>
are you counting) we learn to read and one of them is (Yes, Ned) by <br/>
&#39;sounding out words&#39;. The third part has poems, jokes and mini <br/>
stories like &#39;The Mad Story&#39; (You did it! I did not!).<br/>
<br/>
Check out the book with him and see where it takes you.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>

the author&#39;s way of writing the character&#39;s speech to show how he talked, and <br/>
gave me the word &quot;dialect.&quot; (I didn&#39;t SHOW her the word.)<br/>
<br/>
So I impressed the teacher in my book report, talking about how the author <br/>
used dialect to illustrate the character. She obviously hadn&#39;t read the book. <br/>
When I discovered soon after that the word Educate was really spelled that <br/>
way and did NOT have a G or J, I was mortified.  (I am amused that I must <br/>
have been young enough (I was an early reader) to not recognize the spelling <br/>
of Educate, but able to use my mother&#39;s discussion of dialect in a book <br/>
report.)<br/>

I would say reading has a thousand parts and that I&#39;d show him two right now. <br/>
 If he&#39;s having fun, keep playing with it.  As soon as he&#39;s frustrated <br/>
reassure him that he will pick up 900 of those parts all by himself and <br/>
you&#39;ll be glad to help him if he ever finds anything that seems hard.  If you <br/>
talk about it as a longterm but fun thing, each little clue adds to the <br/>

<br/>
When I&#39;m aware and careful, if my kids are frustrated about other kids being <br/>
able to do something they can&#39;t I try to remain really calm and share with <br/>
them some of that calmness instead of matching their frustration and <br/>
nervousness.  And I&#39;ll work into the conversation naturally a question like <br/>
&quot;Do you think Joey&#39;s sometimes sad because you can roller blade better than <br/>
he can?&quot;   or &quot;When you&#39;re playing a game and your friends can&#39;t play it as <br/>
well, do you help them out?  Remember when Kirby used to help you?&quot;   And I <br/>

&gt; sister).  Will you teach me how to read? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s asking for direct help, I&#39;d give some to him - but I wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
carried away and assume that he wants some sort of ongoing &quot;lessons.&quot; I <br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t go out and buy a lesson book or reading program. I&#39;d find <br/>
a number of ways to approach it.<br/>
<br/>
Games for Reading by Peggy Kaye. LOTS of great ideas in there. Have fun, play <br/>
games, he&#39;ll be learning to read - if he is ready he&#39;ll soak it up and it&#39;ll <br/>
happen. If he isn&#39;t ready (and it isn&#39;t terribly uncommon for younger <br/>
brothers to want to read like older sisters and yet not be developmentally <br/>
ready), you&#39;ll need to find ways to let him feel good about being on the road <br/>
to reading.<br/>
<br/>
Ask what words he wants to read - write them on an index card, let him draw a <br/>
picture on the other side, if he wants to. Keep &quot;HIS SPECIAL WORDS&quot; in an <br/>
envelope somewhere where he can take them out and read anytime he wants. He <br/>
can write sentences or phrases, too, but often kids are happy with just <br/>
special words. My daughters all did this and loved to take out their words <br/>
and would &quot;read&quot; them aloud to anybody who would listen - over and over.<br/>
<br/>
You can write action words on cards -- &quot;JUMP&quot; and &quot;STOP&quot; and &quot;RUN&quot; and &quot;HOP&quot; <br/>
and so on --- then you flash the card and he does the action -- use only a <br/>
set of words that all start with a different letter, at first. Or write them <br/>
in different colors. This is a fun &quot;reading game&quot; -- that might be satisfying <br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
Patty Wolcott&#39;s books are GREAT for kids to really read big words fairly <br/>
quickly. They are not controlled-vocabulary books - and they are fun to read, <br/>
have a bit of rhythm/sound to them that makes them pleasant to read over and <br/>
over. And that&#39;s what you do with them - read them over and over -- there is <br/>
so much repetition that the kids memorize lots of the pages and begin to <br/>
recognize the words -- even big words like &quot;marvelous.&quot; They start to look at <br/>
the words carefully to see what the differences are between them - so that <br/>
they can distinguish them. They usually first recognize them by the first <br/>
letter sound and then the context -- pictures and repeated sentences. The <br/>
Marvelous Mudwashing Machine and The Cake Story were our favorites. They&#39;re <br/>
out of print -- but available used and in libraries. <br/>
<br/>
The Bob Books and other little sets of controlled vocabulary books are good <br/>
if your child enjoys them - not as a reading program - just to have a play <br/>
with. Somebody gave us the first set and my youngest  daughter carried them <br/>
around in a little lunch pail for months - with a set of colored pencils -- <br/>
she used them as coloring books (they are simple black and white line <br/>
drawings). I read them to her, she memorized them and read them to herself. <br/>
She was happy with that. She wasn&#39;t REALLY reading -- she didn&#39;t recognize <br/>
the words in the Bob books in other contexts for a couple of years after <br/>
that. But it set the stage and she was satisfied. Trying to give her direct <br/>
phonics instruction was a wasted and frustrating effort - even as casually <br/>
and informally as I did it. She did not retain even the most simple <br/>
letter-sound connections - until she&#39;d accumulated a LOT of sight words in <br/>
her reading vocabulary and began to sort out the phonics patterns herself.<br/>

find this book -- trying to remember the title and author. Searched on google <br/>
forever for books with titles that were ALMOST but not quite that one.... I <br/>
was starting to think I&#39;d completely imagined it.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great book!!!! It is cheap - and filled with great ideas and is so <br/>
very respectful of kids being in charge of their own learning!!!!<br/>

&gt;-=-Specifically, he says, &quot;Mommy, I wish I could read like (his <br/>
&gt;sister).  Will you teach me how to read?  -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would say reading has a thousand parts and that I&#39;d show him two right now. <br/>
&gt; If he&#39;s having fun, keep playing with it.  As soon as he&#39;s frustrated <br/>
&gt;reassure him that he will pick up 900 of those parts all by himself and <br/>
&gt;you&#39;ll be glad to help him if he ever finds anything that seems hard.  If you <br/>
&gt;talk about it as a longterm but fun thing, each little clue adds to the <br/>
&gt;picture.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;d show him the logo on a McDonald&#39;s cup or a Wal-Mart bag and ask <br/>
him what it was.  When he says, &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; or &quot;Wal-Mart&quot;, then I&#39;d <br/>
say, &quot;YOU CAN READ!&quot;  And at that point I&#39;d either let it go, or if he <br/>
was interested, explain to him that, like learning baseball (in our <br/>
case--you should use something else he&#39;s has experience with), he&#39;s not <br/>
going to learn all of it at once, or be perfect at it right away, that <br/>
recognizing McDonald&#39;s and Wal-Mart (or what have you) is just one of <br/>
the first things he knows how to read...which ties right in to the <br/>
explanation Sandra gave above.  <br/>
<br/>
No lie, Will could recognize and tell other people letters when he was <br/>
18 months old.  He could read the word &quot;Exit&quot; when he was about that <br/>
age, too.  His very tall dad used carry him around on his shoulders, and <br/>
point out exit signs in stores.  He got to where he could read it when <br/>
we wrote it down.  Once a friend of ours was carrying him around a car <br/>
dealership.  Will was very little, less than 2.  Our friend pointed out <br/>
a huge letter painted on the window and said &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot; and Will <br/>
said, &quot;H&quot; and it was.  Our friend was amazed and astounded and thought <br/>
Will was a baby genius.  But really, H was just one of the letters that <br/>
was easy for him to recognize (because it looks like a tie-fighter).  <br/>
<br/>
All his verbal life we&#39;ve been affirming for him that he could read some <br/>
things, and that he could and would learn others as time went on.  We <br/>
didn&#39;t do flash cards or 100 easy lessons or anything.  But we did spend <br/>
a lot of time in doctor&#39;s waiting rooms, or car dealerships or church or <br/>
wherever, and capitalized on the fact that there&#39;s rarely much else to <br/>
do in those places except read or point out letters.  Eventually, all <br/>
those experiences added up to reading for him, at age 7, when he got <br/>
&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; for Christmas.  Read it through that very night.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not a late reader by any stretch, but he is an unschooled reader, <br/>
all the way.  Learned from living life.<br/>
