NE Ohio for decades!! They were my FAVORITE item there-besides the <br/>
bellbeefer... Now they have those nasty &quot;styrofoam&quot; Cinnamon Twists. How close is the <br/>
nearest Taco Bell to the conference hotel?!<br/>

styrofoam Cinnamon Twists, but I didn&#39;t know the current lingo.<br/>
<br/>
They look like pork rinds, but I think they&#39;re air, grease, cinnamon  <br/>
and sugar.<br/>
