<br/>
You can let a post pass without comment if you feel it is dragging on and on <br/>
or over and over.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to be rude and resort to name calling.<br/>
<br/>
Let me rephrase the line that bothered you so much... I, personally,l think <br/>
that unschooling is honorable and good.<br/>
<br/>
I will also add that it is good and honorable that you help so many people <br/>
find unschooling and you write and speak and are an advocate for something so <br/>
wonderful for children.  That is never been in question.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it is good and honorable that we recognize there are things we <br/>
can/should do to help make this world better, not just for our families.  The <br/>
things we can do are small for sure but don&#39;t we all owe something?<br/>
<br/>
You give back in ways that you feel you can.  Others find other causes to <br/>
help remedy in some small way, things they feel passionately about, some <br/>
change things in big ways and some even affect others for the better or worse <br/>
without even trying.<br/>
<br/>
I just feel that you can live in the present and still care about injustices <br/>
(that do happen every single minute of every single day) and those who can&#39;t <br/>
help themselves or speak for themselves to have a better existence in either <br/>
small ways or big ways.<br/>

  Glena I have to say you might not resort to name calling but you get your passive digs in from what I can see. Maybe a little directness would address this better.I tell my kids to use their words to tell the person what they are feeling or how they were affected or what they want from that person. You didn&#39;t namecall but you are no cleaner in this battle between you and sandra<br/>
