&lt;&lt; Public cyber charter schools are free.  Well, not free, but paid for <br/>
 by tax payers instead of by the student&#39;s family. <br/>
 <br/>
 You can disenroll and do whatever is required in your state to <br/>
 homeschool at anytime.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, we were in one of those and this is true. Our first two years of <br/>
homeschooling we used a place like this for a computer class, some preschool <br/>
fun stuff and tumbling.<br/>
Oh, and a sciency kind of class where we planted a garded, grew earth worms, <br/>
made tea from herbs and so on.....<br/>
<br/>
BUT, there are programs, like those in Alaska, where the public school <br/>
enrolls homeschooled children and shares the funds they receive for that <br/>
child with the parents.<br/>
You get reimbursed for anywhere from 1200-1400 dollars worth of supplies, <br/>
which sounds wonderful. My sis bought a trampoline, they got a computer, art <br/>
supplies, cool science stuff etc...<br/>
But every year the restrictions get worse and worse.<br/>
Most of the people are running schools in their home and grading their child.<br/>
The worst part is you can&#39;t leave the program after you have spent some of <br/>
the money.<br/>
