<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626605351">I forgot, does anyone here have any experience with on-line publishing? Our<br/>
daughter, Chloe 10, has written a great story &quot;An Alien in the Bathroom&quot; and<br/>
we were interested in finding out ways of &quot;sharing&quot; this with others. I also<br/>
had received (a while back) a link to a homeschoolers on line newspaper<br/>
written by kids in Arizona, anyone know more about it? I need to learn more<br/>
about computers so I can save this info for later dates!! Someone homeschool<br/>
me, please!<br/>

Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I thought I&#39;d send you a newsletter to let you know the latest <br/>
regarding our very first issue (due February 1st)!<br/>
<br/>
We have about 7 poems and 5 stories so far.  However, please don&#39;t <br/>
forget to share what you are doing in unit studies, or your favourite <br/>
math problem or recipe.  Plus we have a new category for jokes!  We <br/>
also need items for beauty (including inner beauty), and fashion.  <br/>
Plus arts & crafts and hobbies.  Get those items in now!  We&#39;re <br/>
waiting!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to your eager and enthusiastic response!<br/>
<br/>
Mrs T.<br/>
