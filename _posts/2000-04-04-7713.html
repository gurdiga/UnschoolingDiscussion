<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681361135">I think a mother who firmly decides to breastfeed should do<br/>
so.  I have 3 children and nursed all of them.  Some people<br/>
were very uncomfortable with it and couldn&#39;t be in the same<br/>
room while I was doing it.  Go with your gut feeling.  No<br/>
matter what you do, people will question the decision you<br/>
make either way.  AS IF it is their decision to make!  My<br/>
husband was uncomfortable at first (his whole family was<br/>
that way!) But he realized what a great thing it was and<br/>
supported me when he saw the weight gain and money saved!<br/>
The rest of his family never came around but who cares, it<br/>
was our baby.<br/>
Good luck and stand firm, whatever you decide!<br/>
