<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801418069">maybe it started out with something a bit less than good, but this <br/>
debate on spanking (which btw I have not been following: been too <br/>
busy by a LONG shot) brought it to mind.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old, whose passion at this point is computer games, had <br/>
been playing off and on all day long. He had gotten to a higher level <br/>
than ever on one pretty cool game called Kid Chameleon...which <br/>
doesn&#39;t save. IOW, if he is to get to that level again, he will have <br/>
to start over at level one (stupid game, in that regard)<br/>
<br/>
well, he&#39;d been playing it for hours, literally. Like, at least three <br/>
without stopping. I had some things I absolutely HAD to do on the <br/>
computer, and it had to be right then, because I am coming down with <br/>
something and had to get to bed. Normally, I let him play however <br/>
long, but this time it simply had to be the way it was. I thought it <br/>
over &quot;If he were an adult, would I ask him to finish up soon?&quot; Yes. I <br/>
HAD to do computer stuff. (and yes, I do know adults who spend hours <br/>
at a time on the computer)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...that&#39;s the part that is &quot;a bit less than good&quot;: making him <br/>
get off when he was obviously very into the game and having a great <br/>
time at it.<br/>
<br/>
He did get off when I insisted, and went into major trauma mode. He <br/>
cried, he stormed off, he got VERY upset. I finished my computer <br/>
stuff pretty quick (under 10 min) while he wailed in his room. He <br/>
came back upstairs after I was ready for bed, sobbing and crying that <br/>
he hadn&#39;t ever gotten to that level before. What I didn&#39;t understand <br/>
at the time was, he couldn&#39;t start at that level; he has to start the <br/>
game over completely.<br/>
<br/>
And here is where I did something good. Instead of rolling my <br/>
eyeballs and telling him to calm down, get over it, grow UP...I sat <br/>
down with him, put my arm around him as he sobbed, and said &quot;That&#39;s <br/>
pretty frustrating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah...hic...frustrating...hic...It took me CENTURIES to get to that <br/>
level! Sob, cry, wail...not centuries...but YEARSSSSSS!&quot; and so <br/>
forth. I said to him &quot;You&#39;ve been playing that game today. Nov. 22 is <br/>
NOT years, it is one day&quot; he stopped crying and looked at me.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay, but ALL DAY LOOONNNNNGGGG! sob, cry, wail&quot; and then I asked <br/>
him if we had other games that don&#39;t save &quot;ye-heh-hessss&quot; sob, cry, a <br/>
little less wailing. I asked him what games, and he told me a few, <br/>
and then I remembered a puzzle game I like that doesn&#39;t save, and <br/>
told him I knew how he felt, because that game frustrated me, too.<br/>
<br/>
By this time, he was done crying and started telling me the favorite <br/>
parts of some of his games (we were lying down in my room, me and all <br/>
the kids) and answering questions about the games that I was asking <br/>
him. We talked about having a two-hours-at-a-time limit per person... <br/>
with each turn at the computer being only two hours, then handing it <br/>
over for someone else&#39;s two-hour turn. I also asked him if he needed <br/>
me to help him govern this part of his life,(i.e. restrict his time <br/>
at the computer) or could he govern himself. He thinks he can govern <br/>
himself. <br/>
<br/>
Within less than a half hour after I made him get off the computer, <br/>
we were lying in bed together, calmly reading The Hobbit.<br/>
<br/>
This could not have happened if I had not been in &quot;Compassion Towards <br/>
Kids&quot; mode, and I do have this list to thank for that. It is <br/>
impossible to say how the evening might have been different if I&#39;d <br/>
gone at the overwhelming emotional response with an emotional <br/>
response of my own...or with a physical response such as &quot;give you <br/>
something to CRY about, kid&quot; and swatting him on the butt. One thing <br/>
I can say for sure...in former &quot;control-the-kid&quot; mode, we would have <br/>
had more crying, longer &quot;recuperation,&quot; and broken fellowship that <br/>
would have needed mending.<br/>
<br/>
well, just another little stepping stone in my own journey<br/>
<br/>
thanks alla youse. much wisdom to be found, here.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121255883">HeidiC, that was a pretty cool story.  I still feel really sorry for your <br/>
son, though.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We talked about having a two-hours-at-a-time limit per person... <br/>
<br/>
with each turn at the computer being only two hours, then handing it <br/>
<br/>
over for someone else&#39;s two-hour turn. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t need two hours.  Lots of times people don&#39;t need two hours.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe just a &quot;who&#39;s next&quot; rule would work?<br/>
<br/>
It has helped us IMMENSELY to have two computers.  I have an expensive <br/>
Macintosh, but Kirby has a PC made of many used components which friends of his help <br/>
him keep operational.  He&#39;s bought a  new this-or-that from time to time. His <br/>
total expense with upgrades has been under $550 I think.  (I threw in another <br/>
$50 because I dont know how much his new laser-mouse cost, whatever the <br/>
non-roller-ball things are called, and I have one too but I don&#39;t know its name <br/>
right now.)<br/>
<br/>
If someone really has to check e-mail or send something, we have two places <br/>
to appeal, and usually one or the other is available.  <br/>
<br/>
I know not everybody can afford that, but it&#39;s  helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I have gone to bed and then gotten up later to get on the computer if my kids <br/>
couldn&#39;t easily relinquish it.  Last night Marty had waited for me, and when <br/>
I let him on I didn&#39;t even say &quot;but I need it back.&quot;  I just let him have it <br/>
for the rest of the evening.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This could not have happened if I had not been in &quot;Compassion Towards <br/>
<br/>
Kids&quot; mode, and I do have this list to thank for that. It is <br/>
<br/>
impossible to say how the evening might have been different if I&#39;d <br/>
<br/>
gone at the overwhelming emotional response with an emotional <br/>

<br/>
had more crying, longer &quot;recuperation,&quot; and broken fellowship that <br/>
<br/>
would have needed mending.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can still remember specific incidents from when I was a kid when there was <br/>
SO much noise and crying and spanking and fear and resentment, and my mom just <br/>
SEETHING with self-righteous anger, angry with us for &quot;making her mad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What a waste.  It didn&#39;t make me love her more or trust her.<br/>
<br/>
I love reading the stories here of people who might also have experienced <br/>
times like that and not only never gotten an apology themselves, but been made to <br/>
apologize for the inconvenience to the parent of the parent having to throw a <br/>
fit.  (Talk about tantrums, my MOM used to have some!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice being around people who are working at peaceful lives.<br/>
<br/>
My mom died earlier this month, and when being debriefed by friends and <br/>
relatives about it, and about how I was doing, I came to see that though things <br/>
with my mom were bad for me, the legacy of that is my conscious awareness that <br/>
there are better ways, and my interest in helping others see them.<br/>
<br/>
When someone&#39;s life wasn&#39;t very bad, they have less incentive to move away <br/>
from it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve known WAY worse lives than mine was.  But just because someone has <br/>
no feet doesn&#39;t mean I should go barefooted in the snow and shut up about it.<br/>
<br/>
Just when I think I&#39;ve made my kids&#39; lives as good as I think they can be, I <br/>
find a way to make them even better.   The natural human instinct to play the <br/>
game to the highest possible level can work in places other than business and <br/>
video games.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is it optical mouse? We have those too - they are less buggy and don&#39;t need<br/>
cleaning so much.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Whenever I hear people fussing about their kids being on the computer (not<br/>
here of course), I get baffled. Jayn at 4, is already an old hand at playing<br/>
computer games both on disc and on the internet (eg Nick Jr, Barbie.com,<br/>
Pocket Polly). The first time she started being interested in keyboards - we<br/>
gave her an old one to play with - I was full of delight. The pretend<br/>
computer didn&#39;t last long - the real ones are so much more interesting. I am<br/>
so impressed with her ability already with clicking the mouse etc. She is<br/>
just going to grow up enjoying being computer literate with no work on my<br/>
part.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband built our two desktop computers ( ie his and mine) from scratch,<br/>
purchasing most of the components at Fry&#39;s Electronics. I guess they cost<br/>
about $600, and are fast. Add to that extra software over the years and the<br/>
odd new motherboard, a hardware firewall, and now wireless technology, the<br/>
cost goes up - but still less than you might have paid for a new fully built<br/>
one with equal memory and speed. Last week we bought laptops for he and I,<br/>
so Jayn has pretty much inherited my old computer. I only get on it to look<br/>
at stuff that is historical - my old &quot;favorites&quot; list eg - or send faxes. I<br/>
get to haul my laptop to the bedroom and hang out with Jayn while she<br/>
watches Swan Lake for the umpteenth time.  It has become not uncommon for<br/>
all of us to be engaged in electronic stuff at the same time - computers,<br/>
research, writing, games. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A word about costs - if you use your computer in your money earning - be it<br/>
graphics, creating invoices, writing articles, sending invoices (ie<br/>
jobsearch expenses) - don&#39;t forget that it is all deductible to greater or<br/>
lesser degrees.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I stand at the front door to our apartment and look in to the living<br/>
room I see bookshelves lining the walls, the pretty big TV, Jayn&#39;s table<br/>
covered with art stuff, my sewing corner, the dining table kicked off on an<br/>
angle (because we use the dining room part of the L-shape as our office with<br/>
two armoires) and Jayn&#39;s toy &quot;room&quot; which is made from the coat closet and<br/>
nearby area. Shelves and storage cubes - it is actually under reasonable<br/>
control considering she has no room of her own to put her stuff in. Books,<br/>
magazines, art works in progress. Clutter but not out of control, and I tidy<br/>
before visitors as well as pick up each day. I think it is an enriched<br/>
environment, and indicative of a very creative and active little girl.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yet whenever a parent visits our home for the first time, the invariable<br/>
initial comment, made with greater or lesser degrees of sniffing disapproval<br/>
is &quot;What a lot of toys&quot;. The ones who get invited back are the few who say<br/>
it with delight.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I can still remember specific incidents from when I was a kid when there<br/>
was <br/>
SO much noise and crying and spanking and fear and resentment, and my mom<br/>
just <br/>
SEETHING with self-righteous anger, angry with us for &quot;making her mad.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Me too. One time I was eating spaghetti, and my mother walked past and hit<br/>
me hard on the back. To this day I don&#39;t know what I did or said to set her<br/>
off. I wasn&#39;t choking - she was raging about??? All I remember of my<br/>
childhood with my mother is an endless round of being hit, and her being<br/>
sorry later, and I had to be the comforter. Happy times in my childhood are<br/>
always connected to other things - sometimes school (especially high<br/>
school), holidays with my grandmother, friends. But I have no happy memories<br/>
of my mother when she was not angry with me. I am so determined that Jayn<br/>
will have a different picture of family life.<br/>

possibly count the thousands of nights that I didn&#39;t get enough sleep as a<br/>
child because my mother hit me, sending me into a crying or silent fit, then<br/>
made me suffer through her apologizing for the next 1-10+ hours until I<br/>
swore many times that I forgave her.  The rare times that I refused to<br/>
forgive her right away, she kept me awake until I did.  It was torture.  I<br/>
got to the point that I made up homework to try and get away from it.<br/>
Emotional blackmail should never be done on a child (or any person!, but<br/>
especially a child).<br/>
<br/>
I do love and care about my Mom, but I am grateful that I don&#39;t see her more<br/>
than a handful of times a year, because I get physically ill everytime a<br/>
visit is near and it lasts until the visit is over.  My personality changes<br/>
some, too, and I am working on that.<br/>

My condolences to you Sandra.  You were just talking not too long ago about<br/>
your mom not answering the phone when you called.  I had no idea she was<br/>
that close to dying.  I realize the two of you were not that close, but it&#39;s<br/>
still hard to lose a family member.  ((((()))))<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, it&#39;s like nothing ever before.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d feel orphaned if I was old enough to be a grandmother.  <br/>
But a kind of visceral feeling came and stayed with me for a couple of days.  <br/>
Instincts I couldn&#39;t recognize were urging me to do something I couldn&#39;t figure <br/>
out.  It felt as real as the instinct to pick up a crying baby, but I didn&#39;t <br/>
know what I was supposed to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Probably wash the body and bury it or something.  Maybe call all my relatives <br/>
and declare myself alpha female (or however the chimps do).  Maybe put on my <br/>
medieval clothes and sing a song in Anglo Saxon.    So I picked up my mom&#39;s <br/>
ashes, called relatives and told them she died at home in her bed which was the <br/>
way her mother died, which was the way she wanted to die, and I watched Arwen <br/>
sing a song in Anglo Saxon on the extended Two Towers DVD.<br/>
<br/>
It was the closest I could come to settling those nerve-signals that probably <br/>
only come once in a lifetime.<br/>
