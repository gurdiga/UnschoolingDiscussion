<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884820200">Kirby&#39;s birthday is today (so is Amy/arcarpenter&#39;s--Happy Birthday!) and he&#39;s <br/>
having a costume party with &quot;movie character&quot; theme.   I was going to be <br/>
Fiona from About a Boy, but decided to be a nun instead.    I thought I&#39;d just <br/>
tell people who asked that I was the nun from that movie... you know, the movie <br/>
with the nun, and then name a different movie every time.     They should be <br/>
movies the teens might&#39;ve seen, and my list so far is<br/>
Blues Brothers<br/>
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back<br/>
Dogma<br/>
The Sound of Music<br/>
Sister Act<br/>
<br/>
I could say &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; and then sing, but that wasn&#39;t a movie, just a <br/>
pop song.   None of them were born then anyway.<br/>
<br/>
For things they won&#39;t recognize that have nuns, I thought of <br/>
Lilies of the Field<br/>
Two Mules for Sister Sara (fake nun, but still...)<br/>
Brother Sun, Sister Moon<br/>
El Cid<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing people here will have lots of ideas I&#39;m just not getting at the <br/>
moment.<br/>

and knocks the little girl&#39;s IV out with her guitar&#39;s neck.<br/>

Hmm and I think there are nuns in South Pacific and in McHale&#39;s Navy <br/>
(the movie)- they run orphanages generally<br/>
<br/>
Oh and it&#39;s TV but there&#39;s a nun who runs an orphanage in MASH (I&#39;m <br/>
not sure if she shows up in the movie version or not).<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t forget A Change of Habit with Elvis Presley and Mary Tyler <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Marty   mentioned that one last night.   Good one!<br/>
<br/>
One friend showed up after work without a costume, and Kirby&#39;s threat was <br/>
anyone not in a costume had to strip and go as a porn star, so he said that to <br/>
Cathyn, who said &quot;Okay, whoever wants to see the fat white guy naked, raise your <br/>
hand.   Marty (as Dr. Strangelove) raised his gloved hand STRAIGHT UP in the <br/>
air and was beating it back down with the other hand, as though desperately <br/>
trying NOT to vote yes.   Good use of character. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Brett showed up late in a cow costume, Marty asked him if that single glove <br/>
he was wearing was Brett&#39;s, from Hallowe&#39;en, they discussed it, decided not, <br/>
and then Brett very straight-facedly said to Marty &quot;Your Michael Jackson costume <br/>
sucks.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
We were wishing we&#39;d had black fishnets and a little plaid blanket, so that <br/>
Marty could&#39;ve broken into a little bit of Dr. Scott from Rocky Horror.    Next <br/>
time, maybe, now that he&#39;s gathered all the costume bits.   <br/>
<br/>
The dark shades were a last minute find, $1.50, and they seem just <br/>
right--high and round and wire-rimmed and dark.   Holly and I found them at Savers.    <br/>
<br/>
Marty as Dr. Strangelove is here:<br/>
