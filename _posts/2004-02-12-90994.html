<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960917632">I have been up til, hmmm it&#39;s 4:22am now, so a long darn time. I have <br/>
read all the posts on the TV issue and may I say that you all are <br/>
just cool.  I loved the answers, so varied and so right on the money. <br/>
I copied and pasted a bunch and sent them to my dh. We had a talk <br/>
about tv tonite, so it was providential that I found the thread.<br/>
<br/>
See, I have not been on the pc for almost a week. Last I was here, I <br/>
posted quotes from Gatto and Pam thought I didn&#39;t like tv because of <br/>
it. May I state that we have Dishnetwork w/tivo recieves and HBO, 4 <br/>
tvs, 4 dvd players,2 or 3 cd players, 3 vcrs, 2 laserdisc players,2 <br/>
or 3 laptops, 3 pcs, hundreds of cds, dvds,laserdics, <br/>
videotapes,video games (oh yeah 2 gaming systems so far) ,  a new <br/>
minivan with cd/dvd player and 2 dropdown screens and 6 cd player <br/>
plus navigation system (it&#39;s the new Nissan Quest and it ROCKS!). My <br/>
husband is an avid EQ player. My 14 year old son wants to be a film <br/>
maker (and has a new kick ass digital movie camera).  WE LOVE TV!!!  <br/>
I also, personally, LOVE books. Love them to bits. I am always <br/>
reading about 10 at a time. And I can&#39;t stop buying them. I am <br/>
totally addicted to books. So, hey, go figure.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I worry about the balance of tv when my kids lie on the couch <br/>
several afternoons in row watching the same Spongebob dvds. We all <br/>
know all of them by heart...no joke.&lt;g&gt; But then other stuff happens, <br/>
on other days, that doesn&#39;t involve tv and I realize it&#39;s no big <br/>
deal. My dh is another story, but thank God ( and I do, coz I&#39;ve <br/>
praying about it) dh is finally starting to come around.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all, I just love this list.<br/>

You are right that it is the same impulse or need being met.  We kind of <br/>
missed the toddler book repetition age (my son didn&#39;t like books a great <br/>
deal as a toddler and was nursed to sleep for many years, instead of <br/>
being read to sleep.)   Anyway, the video repetition surprised me when I <br/>
observed it, because it&#39;s rare for me to watch anything twice, at least <br/>
in the same day or even month.  I had (and probably still have) some <br/>
pro-book, anti-other-media prejudice.  I could ignore that feeling <br/>
through ONE showing of The Three Ninjas, or other low-budget kid video, <br/>
but after the third or fourth viewing, my conscience was screeching <br/>
about &quot;wasted time&quot;.  And, clearly, although parents may joke about <br/>
getting bored reading the same book over and over, I don&#39;t think anyone <br/>
thinks an extra repetition of a bedtime story is a waste of the child&#39;s <br/>
time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121674390">** My DD will watch a movie so many times that we all know the words by<br/>
heart.  Then, just like that, she won&#39;t want to watch again for a<br/>
LONG time and it&#39;s on to another one.  I know all the words to Babe,<br/>
Finding Nemo, Lion King (I could go on and on) now she&#39;s on to Lion<br/>
King 1 1/2 (she watched that one maybe 4 times yesterday).**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve composed mental thank you letters to Steve Jobs and Pixar, because <br/>
when my son was in the preschool age range (about 5 years ago), &quot;Toy <br/>
Story&quot; was the only Disney movie that I still enjoyed after the 10th <br/>
viewing.  I consider that quite an artistic accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
** When it wasn&#39;t so cold out, we were almost never home during the day<br/>
so I&#39;m waiting for the spring and warm weather again so that we can<br/>
all get out of the house.  I like tv too but, I&#39;m tired of knowing<br/>
what&#39;s on every hour of the day.  :)**<br/>
<br/>
Kind of the same thing is going on here.  We got 150 channels of Dish TV <br/>
in October, and after Xmas when it was rainy here, we burrowed down and <br/>
watched tons of TV.  On days when we are home, I would estimate that my <br/>
son watches at least 4 hours of TV (which sound like a lot) and I watch <br/>
a similar amount, but I might be folding laundry or sewing or even <br/>
reading magazines while the TV is on.  It seems like TV is the dominant <br/>
thing around here, and I realize it has a lot to do with us not being <br/>
very connected to our new community and me not having lots of energy and <br/>
ideas.  And my child doesn&#39;t have siblings.  But, some days we aren&#39;t <br/>
home all day.  On Tuesdays and many Fridays we leave the house at 10am <br/>
and play all day and don&#39;t come back until 8 or 9 or even 10 pm.  There <br/>
aren&#39;t any &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; from the rumored &quot;TV addiction&quot;.  ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be accurate for me to say that my son has a steady diet of <br/>
nothing but TV and Playstation.<br/>

would ever presume to &quot;teach&quot; it or claim to know it.  They read it over and <br/>
over, mark it up, read other people&#39;s commentary, read it with a particular <br/>
person/place/thing in mind, read it over for years.<br/>
<br/>
And so I withheld my criticism of Marty watching Dumbo daily for weeks, or <br/>
Holly watching Stand By Me again, sometimes twice in a day.  Also, my kids tend <br/>
toward things with music, and they want to learn all the words, and both those <br/>
movies have songs.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re good people who know a few movies and videos really, really well. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

sure what it is but, she seems to take something new away from each <br/>
viewing.  We also read books over and over and over and over again, <br/>
she loves books as much as she does movies.  Then, the same things <br/>
happens.  We she gets a new book, it&#39;s the only one she wants me to <br/>
read to her, until even she can read it.  Then, it&#39;s on to another <br/>
book.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to be the same way as you.  If she was reading a book 10 <br/>
times, I was fine with that.  But, watching a movies 10 times, that <br/>
can&#39;t be good for her.  Until I joined this list.  Now, it really <br/>
dosen&#39;t bother me when she watches tv most of the day, for a couple <br/>
of reasons.  She really dosen&#39;t watch it all day (even if sometimes <br/>
it feels that way) and, even if she does watch most of the day, she <br/>
is almost always doing something else too.  Pulling out her toys to <br/>
play with me, coloring, playing with Play Doh, Pretending <br/>
___________,.  And, it is almost never hard to pull her away with <br/>
other, &quot;more worthwhile&quot; activities.  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;LOL&gt; makes me think of all those nights of nursing and reading simulataneuosly...and then the tandem nursing and trying to read simultaneously...need really long arms for that one!  Finally the girls figured out that it was really difficult to nurse two kids and hold a book all at the same time.  So eventually my older daughter became the book holder and my younger turned the pages!  Oh what solutions we find &lt;g&gt;<br/>

We have two children who don&#39;t like change.  Kirby used to be disturbed if <br/>
furniture was rearranged or we lost a bowl he liked.  He&#39;s better now at <br/>
nearly-grown.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly rants when re-run schedules are changed.  If she&#39;s used to watching <br/>
Simpsons at 5:00 she does NOT want to turn the TV on and find Friends or Dharma <br/>
and Greg.  And it&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t like those shows, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s <br/>
5:00, and should be Simpsons.<br/>
<br/>
She understands that primetime schedules change and there are specials.  That <br/>
doesn&#39;t bother her.  It&#39;s just the re-runs that she tells time by.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I&#39;d get home from school and could tell what time it was <br/>
within five or ten minutes by what was on TV, and whether it had just been a <br/>
commercial, or been a while since a commercial.  When they moved the Gilligan&#39;s <br/>
Island re-runs I had to start using a clock again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756855955">Oh Sandra,<br/>
I had to laugh at your post about kids learning time (and btw math - fractions, proportions) via the tv schedule<br/>
<br/>
Recently my dh was upset that my dd couldn&#39;t tell him what time they were going to arrive somewhere when it was 6:38 in the morning and the ride was an hour and half long.  She was off by twenty two minutes.  He&#39;s wondering how she&#39;s going to learn this stuff....I&#39;ve explained that when she was running her art program for homeschool preschoolers she had to keep her eye on the clock and plan accordingly.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s supportive of unschooling in theory so may appreciate the concept of learning time and adding fractions via her tv watching.  otoh, my own parents and siblings would look at me loopy if I tried to explain the value of tv in terms of learning about time and math concepts - but she can learn that from a book - they would say &lt;lol&gt;<br/>

There are a few shows that I watch regularly in the evening, but my favorite thing to do is fall asleep to a movie I really like. So, I&#39;m just as bad as the kids! *g*<br/>

Jayn watches her videos and recorded shows over and over. When she has a new<br/>
dvd, I notice that she will not be paying close attention to the whole thing<br/>
� but goes in and out, plays dolls or other games with the movie on in the<br/>
room. Then when it ends she wants it again. She is upset if she returns to<br/>
the room where her movie was playing and it has been turned off in the<br/>
interim. I figure she ends up seeing the whole movie in segments over the<br/>
course of a few days. Then she will put it away in her dvd box, until she<br/>
wants to watch again at some unpredictable time in the future. She always<br/>
comes back to them eventually. I can�t see us ever tossing any of her dvd�s.<br/>
Thank goodness they take up so much less space than videos. Renting doesn�t<br/>
work for us either, since she will always want to watch them again later.<br/>

I am the same way about favorite movies and books. I sometimes just get a<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t stand to see the same thing over and over, though my kids do that<br/>
too.  We have some.<br/>
<br/>
But my favorite place is the library where they have a pretty nice selection<br/>
of videos, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We got rid of cable bec. it just didn&#39;t seem worth the money....and we<br/>
didni&#39;t really have the money to start with, but we have Netflix, and that<br/>
is so much fun to just order whatever and have it come in the mail. Their<br/>
selection is AWESOME!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was just wondering if a lot of you  buy or do you enjoy<br/>
renting/borrowing?<br/>

We have tried renting movies but, she loves to watch them so many <br/>

money renting AND buying it.  I&#39;ve simply resigned myself to buying <br/>
anything that looks like she&#39;ll like it.  Most of the time, I like <br/>
them too so, no big deal.  :)<br/>

I have given away books before (to the library or sold some on <br/>

even if I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll want to read them again.  My DH puts <br/>

We occasionally get DVDs as gifts, but rarely do I buy them.  Not only do I<br/>
hate to spend the money, but I get tired of having so much stuff around!<br/>
I&#39;m really working on de-cluttering and simplifying.  Normally we get ours<br/>
from the library.  Our library system is excellent.  Almost anything you<br/>
order will be delivered to your nearest branch in 3 to 5 days.  If you want<br/>
it right away, you can check on-line then go to the particular branch that<br/>
has it and pick it up.  There are 20-some branch locations within half hour<br/>
of our house. You can keep them 5 days, then renew for another 5 if they<br/>
aren&#39;t reserved by someone else.  If it&#39;s a new or particularly in demand<br/>
movie the wait may be longer, so we may rent it if we don&#39;t want to wait.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164656402">We do have an extended cable package with cable internet. We use the TV quite a bit, with Discovery, Discovery Health, Discovery Wings, National Geographic, Nickelodeon, Disney and ToonDisney being the usual channels being watched. There&#39;s also many music channels, so I&#39;ll often have them on as background noise. <br/>
 <br/>
We only recently bought a DVD player, and are slowly building up a collection. We rent first if possible to see how well-liked something will be. I&#39;d rather not buy one to be only watched once or twice then never again. We had quite a collection of videos before they wore out or were lost in the move. Among them we had nearly all of the Veggie Tales movies up to that point, and quite a few Disney movies, a few Rugrats and a couple Blue&#39;s Clues.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re not buying any more videos at this point, although if something isn&#39;t available on DVD that we want to rent but is available on video we&#39;ll be able to still rent. We only rent once a payday though..so maybe twice a month.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t stand to see the same thing over and over, though my kids do that<br/>
too.  We have some.<br/>
<br/>
But my favorite place is the library where they have a pretty nice selection<br/>
of videos, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We got rid of cable bec. it just didn&#39;t seem worth the money....and we<br/>
didni&#39;t really have the money to start with, but we have Netflix, and that<br/>
is so much fun to just order whatever and have it come in the mail. Their<br/>
selection is AWESOME!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74609310">&lt;&lt;How many of you buy dvd&#39;s/videos?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We used to buy quite a few videos and then dvd&#39;s, once we bought the <br/>
dvd player.  My MIL and FIL gave us an entire collection of the <br/>
Disney movies on video so we didn&#39;t have to buy many of them.  <br/>
However, we did buy a few blue&#39;s clues, veggie tales, bear in the <br/>
big blue house and so on.  We stoped buying them (and started <br/>
recording them from the Disney channel) when we were really tight on <br/>
money.  Now that we no longer have the money issues, we are once <br/>
again buying dvd&#39;s but mostly ones that aren&#39;t on Disney.  Things <br/>
like Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc.  But, if we didn&#39;t have the <br/>
money to do that, we wouldn&#39;t, we would probably rent or get from <br/>
the library as well.<br/>

I will watch a movie many times as well (though not over and over in <br/>
the same day).  I have a large collection of movies that I may not <br/>
watch for months and then decide &quot;I haven&#39;t seen that one on a <br/>
while, why not?&quot;  I have seen Gone With The Wind so many times, I <br/>
think that I could play Scarlett!  :)  <br/>
<br/>
I was just watching an episode of Friends that I have seen I don&#39;t <br/>
know how many times and JUST got a joke in it.  That&#39;s when it <br/>
clicked with me why my DD likes to watch over and over, she can <br/>
always pick up something that she missed the first or tenth time <br/>
around (especially when she will walk away from it for long periods <br/>
of time to play).<br/>

our time.  We have done that with some video games the kids ended up not<br/>
really playing.  (I couldn&#39;t bear to part with my Tetris Worlds, even though<br/>
I never get to play.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166492063">I buy classics, like My Fair Lady, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and some <br/>
Disney films the kids want to see over and over again. I also buy my <br/>
son&#39;s train videos, although that&#39;s a rare treat, since they&#39;re quite <br/>
expensive. We get most of our videos from the library--7 day checkout <br/>
with up to two renewals, and they have most of the stuff we want to see. <br/>
Recent films are $1/day, but that&#39;s not much of an issue for us yet.<br/>
<br/>
Someday I&#39;ll try Netflix, but right now we&#39;re doing fine with the <br/>
library selection.<br/>

To clarify, again -- I was commenting on GATTO, not on you. I&#39;m <br/>
uncomfortable with John Gatto being made out to be some kind of <br/>
authority - on an unschooling list. That&#39;s all. He had some great <br/>
insights about schools, where he worked for most of his adult life. <br/>
They are useful to read in order to understand some of the reasons <br/>
schools are the way they are -- but he doesn&#39;t know ANYTHING more than <br/>
anybody here about television and unschooled kids. Zippo.  (Different <br/>
than - Zippy &lt;BEG&gt;)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend Gatto all the time as a jumping off point for those who still <br/>
believe that school is the way to go---who aren&#39;t sure whether they can make the <br/>
jump----or for the husband who&#39;s teetering on the edge. And he&#39;s a great <br/>
resource for &quot;concerned&quot; grandparents, family, friends, and neighbors who are <br/>
insisting that school is mandatory for learning. Gatto gives his &lt;biased&gt; POV, but <br/>
he&#39;s VERY convincing!<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to talk to someone who&#39;s read The Underground History who has not <br/>
come away with a new view of public education. And they are more likely to <br/>
pull a child out of school, or be grateful that their grandchild has been!<br/>
<br/>
So, I tell them to read Gatto and then Holt. Then that they must come to the <br/>
conference. The revelation is miraculous.<br/>

comes from being a teacher for many many years. He hasn&#39;t had anything <br/>
to do with unschooling and is not at all an authority on unschooling.<br/>

I like &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; too - it had a great influence on my thinking <br/>
about school and on what I didn&#39;t want to bring into our home FROM <br/>
school. Good for dads who don&#39;t have the inclination to read a lot - <br/>
the book is a series of essays and they can get the main points even if <br/>
they only read a couple of them.<br/>
