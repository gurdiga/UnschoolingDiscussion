<div id="ygrps-yiv-72928398">I am having trouble with my 15 year old. I began unschooling just this<br/>
year. He never liked school and was traumatized there. He is dyslexic<br/>
and considered bipolar. No medication. He is beginning to get in trouble<br/>
outside of our home when he is with one friend. They are in the age of<br/>
hormones/testosterone. He wants to fight with people lately. He just<br/>
quit counseling after over 4 years with the same therapist. A nice man.<br/>
My son said he couldn&#39;t tell him some things because he was afraid/trust<br/>
issues. My son wants to get his permit to drive. I feel I need to put a<br/>
warning on the car if he does. He tried to read the drivers manual and<br/>
threw it down. He couldn&#39;t read it very quickly. There are too many<br/>
words and the print is very small. I told him I would go over it with<br/>
him. He has a short attention span lately. He says he is &quot;retarded&quot; and<br/>
there is no use. He said he had to ask his friend what time it was the<br/>
other day because he couldn&#39;t tell. This is something new. He does very<br/>
little work for me - if any. He reads yet not very often. He draws<br/>
pictures. My greatest fear is him starting a life of crime. He won&#39;t<br/>
back down even to the police. One police officer threatened him over the<br/>
weekend -swore at him about his &quot;attitude&quot; etc. I called the police<br/>
chief. What it sounds like is that officer was off duty visiting a<br/>
relative when he saw my son. My son looked at him because he had a<br/>
police vehicle that was different than the ones in our town. What is<br/>
scary is that if this officer was acting like he was on duty when he<br/>
wasn&#39;t. The police chief from this officers town told me that towns<br/>
officers don&#39;t go into our town to help out. The police chief from that<br/>
town wouldn&#39;t write down anything I was saying. He said talking was good<br/>
enough and that he wouldtalk to this officer to get his side of the<br/>
story. The family this officer was visiting had the same last name and<br/>
they have a reputaton in our town as being unhappy and very grouchy.We<br/>
live in a small town. I love my son unconditionally and with an open<br/>
mind. He knows he is loved and has family support. We were just able to<br/>
purchase a second vehicle so I am hoping I can get my son interested in<br/>
going other places. I know I will need to come up with some money:) to<br/>
keep him occupied. A few of my other kids are starting a<br/>
business/crafts. My son seemed semi-interested. He does like art. I went<br/>
out and purchased some art materials for my son and his friend. I want<br/>
to keep them occupied the bes I can:) Thanks for listening. Michele <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960229523">I&#39;ve been thinking about your post for a few hours now and some of the <br/>
things your 15yo son does are similar (if in smaller episodes) to what my <br/>
13yo does, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He is beginning to get in trouble<br/>
&gt;outside of our home when he is with one friend. They are in the age of<br/>
&gt;hormones/testosterone. He wants to fight with people lately.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps he would be interested in taking an Aikido class?  He&#39;ll have a <br/>
chance to work in a safe environment, throwing people around the room and <br/>
otherwise &#39;attacking&#39; them, but he&#39;ll also be learning how to defend <br/>
himself from harm *and* if it&#39;s a good dojo/sensei learn about assertive, <br/>
non-violent behavior.  I&#39;m recommending Aikido because I&#39;m mostly <br/>
acquainted with it as a martial art, because your son seems to be dealing <br/>
with some frustration in his life and is starting to release that stress in <br/>
physical ways, and Aikido is both physical, non-violent and almost <br/>
impossible to start a fight with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He just<br/>
&gt;quit counseling after over 4 years with the same therapist. A nice man.<br/>
&gt;My son said he couldn&#39;t tell him some things because he was afraid/trust<br/>
&gt;issues.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, he doesn&#39;t sound like a very good therapist, no matter how &#39;nice&#39; he <br/>
is/was.  Or maybe he wasn&#39;t a good fit for your son.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My son wants to get his permit to drive. I feel I need to put a<br/>
&gt;warning on the car if he does. He tried to read the drivers manual and<br/>
&gt;threw it down. He couldn&#39;t read it very quickly. There are too many<br/>
&gt;words and the print is very small. I told him I would go over it with<br/>
&gt;him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sit down and nonchalantly start to read it to yourself.  Then start to read <br/>
it out loud, as if to yourself.  As he&#39;s being physical, maybe he could <br/>
have something to play with with his hands, while he&#39;s listening.  (or if <br/>
he&#39;s open to your just reading it to him, do that!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He has a short attention span lately. He says he is &quot;retarded&quot; and<br/>
&gt;there is no use.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ouch.  That&#39;s gotta hurt.  I have no ideas for this one.  Of course he&#39;s <br/>
not or it&#39;d be really obvious.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He said he had to ask his friend what time it was the<br/>
&gt;other day because he couldn&#39;t tell. This is something new.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Give him a digital watch, preferably one that does other things too, like a <br/>
compass or that has a laser or something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  He does very<br/>
&gt;little work for me - if any.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither do I, but I suppose that&#39;s okay. (smile)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He reads yet not very often. He draws<br/>
&gt;pictures.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then help him draw pictures!!!  Is this one of his passions?  Get him <br/>
pencils, sketchbooks, charcoal... take him to new places with interesting <br/>
things to draw.  Try to draw yourself.  Offer to bind his artwork together <br/>
into a book.  Find an artist/cartoonist/whatever he could visit/be mentored <br/>
by.  Check out all the drawing books from the library you can find, sit at <br/>
a table in the middle of the house, and try to teach yourself to <br/>
draw.  He&#39;s bound to make off with a few of them.  Go to the museum and <br/>
say, &quot;Shoot, you can draw better than that!  Maybe you should be a world <br/>
famous artist so you can support me in the style to which I&#39;d like to be <br/>
accustomed!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My greatest fear is him starting a life of crime. He won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;back down even to the police.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does he commonly have difficulty expressing his anger and &#39;negative&#39; <br/>
feelings?  Aikido again.  I heard something the other day, where a world <br/>
champion prize fighter was on the subway with a friend.  A drunk guy gets <br/>
on and shoves into the prize fighter as he passes by.  The friend say, <br/>
&quot;Man, why didn&#39;t you deck the guy?  You&#39;re strong enough to take him!&quot;  The <br/>
prize fighter say, &quot;I don&#39;t have to.  I&#39;m powerful enough, I can afford to <br/>
be polite.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your son is finding it difficult to &#39;find his power&#39;, and fighting is <br/>
an easy way to find something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  We were just able to<br/>
&gt;purchase a second vehicle so I am hoping I can get my son interested in<br/>
&gt;going other places.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go with him.  So something he wants to do.  Just *be* there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;A few of my other kids are starting a<br/>
&gt;business/crafts. My son seemed semi-interested. He does like art. I went<br/>
&gt;out and purchased some art materials for my son and his friend.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there you go.  ...and you don&#39;t have to spend a lot of money either, if <br/>
money is an issue.  charcoal (briquettes) on sidewalks are kind of cool (or <br/>
even charcoal from your last fireplace-fire.  Plaster of paris dried into <br/>
chunks makes a great white chalk  (as does drywall)  String and some nails <br/>
in spare bits of board can be cool.  Duct tape rocks!<br/>
<br/>
concentrate on the art (and aikido) and let the rest go.<br/>
