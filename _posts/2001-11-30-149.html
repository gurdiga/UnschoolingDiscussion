&gt; make<br/>
&gt; music up, or to waste their time &quot;playing wrong&quot; when they should go<br/>
&gt; to a<br/>
&gt; teacher and be taught JUST how to hold a guitar, or JUST how to use a<br/>

&gt; &quot;right.&quot;<br/>

&gt; There are English teachers who shun street rhymes or jokes or regional<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; dialects in favor of &quot;reading level&quot; and appreciation of &quot;good<br/>
&gt; literature&quot;<br/>
&gt; (meaning the same things the teacher was forced to read and told how<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; appreciate).<br/>

up from being a literature snob.  We&#39;ve benefitted a lot from letting<br/>
lowbrow, popular stuff into our life without (much) guilt.<br/>
<br/>
Right now we are having big fun reading the Animorphs series of books.<br/>
