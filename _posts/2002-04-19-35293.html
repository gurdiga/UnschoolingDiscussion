<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024306051"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I figured it would be punny from the name.  Sounds like one my <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Between the Lions is on PBS and Treehouse.  My children find it aggitating.  I would have to agree, to say the least!  They seem to think that children have VERY short attention spans.  Every two seconds (slight exaggeration:) they change topic, scene, everything.  Once they we&#39;re reading a story my kids really like (Click, Clack, Moo...Cows that Type - Hilarious book!).  Right in the middle of the story they switched to something new!  My kids were like &quot;WHAT? Where&#39;s the rest of the story?&quot;  Very annoying.  Reminded me of school &quot;oops there&#39;s the bell, stop everything and go to your next class!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, my 5 year old just loves the play on words.  And they have Gwains World - which is alot like the faces on Electrical Company.  Two knights charge at each other with parts of words.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168101299"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I just love that show.  It was very gentle and entertaining and there<br/>
&gt; was never any mention of school.  And the family LIVES TOGETHER IN THE<br/>
&gt; LIBRARY!  How cool is that?!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was my dream as a kid.  I wanted to live in the library.  We had an<br/>
old, old library in our town; heaven knows who built it and when, but it had<br/>
5 floors, but it was split level on EVERY level.  So this little old place<br/>
had 9 floors of books, all about 5 or 6 steps apart.  As a teenager I used<br/>
to walk to the library, grab a stack of books and go hid behind one of the<br/>
pillars between the stacks on the top floor and listen to the rain on the<br/>
roof above me while I read.  Such a great place.<br/>
<br/>
They built a nice new library a couple years ago.  My Mom took us to visit<br/>
it the last time we were there.  It was so sterile and proper library-ish.<br/>
I hated it.  Old dreams die hard.<br/>

Do you know what happened to the old library building? Did they tear it <br/>
down? Use it to store old tax-files? Is someone living in it now?<br/>
