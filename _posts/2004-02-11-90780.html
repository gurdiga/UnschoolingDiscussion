heard of hsing and the idea did not occur to me naturally like it did to some <br/>
people.(This was several years ago, 10 at least) I think first people have to <br/>
think about there being another option. Hsing is much more prevalent today so I <br/>
cannot imagine that there are still people who are unaware that it is <br/>
available. The only thing I can think of in that case is that they are scared, they <br/>
think it&#39;s going to get better or they just aren&#39;t mad enough yet. Of course I <br/>
am not talking about the people who still think it&#39;s just fine.<br/>

Or they think you must be a right-winged fundamentalist to homeschool. <br/>
They&#39;re more &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; and just can&#39;t commit to the religious aspects <br/>
that *must* accompany homeschooling. It took a good bit of research on my part to <br/>
understand differently. I&#39;d contacted every curriculum dealer in the country <br/>
that I could find, received a stack of curriculum catalogues three-four feet <br/>
high, and couldn&#39;t believe the creationist bent on everything. Or more weirdly, <br/>
the strict gender roles I found. <br/>
<br/>
It was reading John Holt that I found unschooling---and Mary Griffith had <br/>
this great resource section in the back of her book. Up &#39;til then I was in the <br/>
dark. (And I didn&#39;t even learn to use the internet until I wanted to know more <br/>
about unschooling! &lt;g&gt; Old dog//new tricks/learningallthetime, right?)<br/>
<br/>
So if your only vision of homeschooling is WORSE than school, school&#39;s a <br/>
better option!<br/>

*****************************************************<br/>
It always amazes me how different peoples&#39; perceptions can be from each<br/>
other&#39;s when they have access to basically the same information.  When I<br/>
started looking at homeschooling, I found a local support group that offered<br/>
a packet of information for new homeschoolers.  It had a book list of<br/>
recommended reading, listed some websites and magazines to check out, etc.<br/>
They had a monthly newsletter and activities for families.  I read all about<br/>
homeschooling, or so I thought.  I knew that Christians sometimes<br/>
homeschooled, just like Pagans sometimes homeschooled and Jews sometimes<br/>
homeschooled.  I didn&#39;t even realize until 3 years later when we moved to<br/>
another city that there was such a thing as &quot;The Christian Homeschooling<br/>
movement&quot; and that it was a big one!  Up until that point I had assumed that<br/>
everyone homeschooled because they loved being with their kids or didn&#39;t<br/>
believe in institutional learning for one reason or another!<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the old story where three blind men are trying to describe<br/>
an elephant, but they are only &quot;seeing&quot; the one small part of it that they<br/>
can feel!<br/>

You only took your teenage daughter out of school a year or two ago, <br/>
right? And all your other kids went all the way through school.<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t you be able to answer your own question better than most of <br/>
the rest of us?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never &quot;took&quot; my daughter out of school.  She just decided she didn&#39;t want <br/>
to go anymore.  She hadn&#39;t been to school for 180 days combined in three years <br/>
and she just decided she didn&#39;t want to attend anymore.  My other children <br/>
were free to make that choice as well.<br/>
<br/>
One of my son&#39;s decided sometime in the fall of his twelfth year not to go <br/>
anymore and so he didn&#39;t.  My other two children went to high school some, were <br/>
not enrolled for periods of time at all, went for another semester or two but <br/>
they both have diplomas from public school.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve said before we never invested ourselves in anyway in the public school <br/>
system.  It was always an option.  The only other &quot;option&quot; that I knew (other <br/>
than what we were doing) was a curriculum based homeschooling atmosphere and I <br/>
certainly didn&#39;t want that for my children.<br/>
<br/>
If your children WANT to go to public school or private school or college, by <br/>
choice, it still doesn&#39;t mean you turn control over to the school.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people do it blindly and completely.  The question wasn&#39;t why do <br/>
children go to public school, it&#39;s why do parents hand over complete control and <br/>
decision making power regarding their children to a government entity?<br/>

Where I live (inner city housing project), everyone we have met thinks that <br/>
you have to be financially well-off and well educated (college degree) to home <br/>
school.  When I meet new neighbors, they are shocked that I hs and live here.  <br/>
I also get a lot of comments that Emily (15) will never amount to anything <br/>
because she&#39;s not going to highschool and preparing for college.  Interestingly, <br/>
these are the same people who hire Emily to tutor their highschool age <br/>
children. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I never looked at any, but I&#39;ve peeked in a few at used bookstores.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly and I were at a thrift store, and they had a box of <br/>
Alpha-Omega stuff marked $19.95.<br/>
<br/>
We looked at some.  It seemed a family had not wanted the religious stuff.  <br/>
It had eight or ten workbooks on Christianity, and then one fatter workbook on <br/>
world cultures.  It seemed also to be about religion from a Christian point of <br/>
view.  No surprise.<br/>
<br/>
What DID surprise me was that the illustrations were AWFUL.  Truly cheap and <br/>
ugly line-drawn junk.  And the maps were no better.  There are GORGEOUS maps <br/>
in the world, but these were lines, with same-size lines for rivers.  They <br/>
looked like the maps from kids&#39; reports, reproduced in plain black on white.   <br/>
<br/>
And talk about trivial nothingness, it was the most over-simplified view of <br/>
the world I&#39;d ever seen.  <br/>
<br/>
It was preparation for standardized tests and nothing more, it seemed to me.  <br/>
I was sad.  Some kids (lots of kids) suffer that lame dusty stuff every <br/>
&quot;schoolday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was sadder than watching the news.<br/>

Unschoolers don&#39;t do that, so perhaps you could find another list more suited <br/>
to the questions you&#39;re asking.  <br/>
