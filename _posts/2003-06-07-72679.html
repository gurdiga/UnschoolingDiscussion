<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902499695">Hi! <br/>
<br/>
After several months of craziness around here, things are finally calming<br/>
down and I thought I&#39;d drop back in. I don&#39;t have a lot of time, as I&#39;m<br/>
working a bit now, but I end up with a couple nights a week sitting here<br/>
staring at the computer screen with no e-mail to read. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone&#39;s doing good, and having fun! <br/>
 <br/>
