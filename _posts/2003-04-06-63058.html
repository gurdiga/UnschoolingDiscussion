<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189720082">&lt;&lt; However, when someone came back with the &quot;full new<br/>
member treatment&quot;, which wasn&#39;t very positive - full of &quot;you need to do<br/>
it this way&quot; types of advice, well...  It seemed like someone was trying<br/>
to fit me into a mold that&#39;s just not my size.  I didn&#39;t ask for advice,<br/>
but got it in spades.<br/>
*This list just tells it the way it is. Sometimes that&#39;s the way we need to <br/>
be spoken to so that we can OPEN OUR EYES! I came to this list to with an <br/>
attitude just like yours but now I thank this list for all the help they have <br/>
given me. The molding doesn&#39;t hurt, I promise.<br/>
&lt;&lt;I stated the truth in the beginning - we will be doing a cross between<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling.  I don&#39;t believe in the complete<br/>
structure that seems to go hand in hand with homeschooling, but complete<br/>
unschooling would not fit my family&#39;s situation either.  We&#39;ll be in a<br/>
gray area.  If that offends anyone, you are entitled to your feeling and<br/>
opinions just the same as anyone is. <br/>
*You are not unschooling if you are still homeschooling. This list is for <br/>
unschooling so you can&#39;t get mad if people disagree with what you want to do. <br/>
Check out other lists that cater more to your style or read, read and read <br/>
from this list and you will learn. <br/>
&lt;&lt;It seems like most on the list that have spoken up so far disagree with<br/>
almost everything I&#39;ve tried to say.  Fine, disagree all you want to.<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for approval or disapproval, but do whatever makes you<br/>
feel better - neither will help me or my child so I&#39;m not giving it any<br/>
attention.<br/>
*I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s advice to you is making them feel better!  <br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t plan on leaving the list, but I definitely won&#39;t be very vocal -<br/>
why encourage the criticism?<br/>
*Why belong to a list that you don&#39;t like and will not be vocal in?<br/>
&lt;&lt;None of this is being posted to encourage a reply.  Personally I&#39;d<br/>
rather see this topic die out.  What I thought was a simple introduction<br/>
has gone awry.  If anyone feels moved to respond all I can ask for is to<br/>
please do it privately - there have *got* to be better things to talk<br/>
about...<br/>
*Yes, there are better things to talk about....What you came here for.... <br/>
Unschooling <br/>
