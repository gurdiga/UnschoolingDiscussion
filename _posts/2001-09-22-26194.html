  Hi, Susan!  Long time no see!  :-)  What occurrred to me (if it&#39;s allowed <br/>
on the trains) are bubbles, &quot;pretty bubbles in the air&quot; &lt;g&gt;...Could she get <br/>
some *very* concentrated soap liquid (for refills) and one bubble-blowing <br/>
setup w/small container and wand?  Looks of &quot;down time&quot; could be filled <br/>
watching bubbles float across the parkinglots outside the stations (if kids <br/>
can&#39;t do this inside, due to regulations). <br/>
<br/>
  Another idea: the book __Cat&#39;s Cradle__ (put out by Klutz Press) comes <br/>
complete with string and *easy* instructions for all those yarn/finger games <br/>
you may have done as a child.  <br/>

 something.  Paper clips?<br/>
 <br/>
 And then paper clips turn into coat hangers.  <br/>
 <br/>
 Sometimes there are LOTS of paper clips and sometimes none, and then there <br/>
 will be wire coat hangers you&#39;ve never seen before.<br/>
