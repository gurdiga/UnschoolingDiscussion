<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833721049">When I first subscribed to this list it was because I wanted to find out how to encourage and facilitate my kids learning. I saw unschooling only as a method of education.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am here to change myself so that my kids can be free and happy. And I see unschooling as a way of life. <br/>
<br/>
So much change in 6 short months. I know I have a long way to go but it feels good to have started.<br/>
