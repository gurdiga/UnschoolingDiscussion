It&#39;s been a long time, I hope you are generally well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very interested in the whole Buddhist faith, perhaps when your Brain<br/>
isn&#39;t so mushy you could explain more to us.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152209068"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m not Buzz but I found Lama Surya Das&#39;s book _Awakening the Buddha<br/>
&gt;Within_ to be an excellent work on Buddhism.  Surya grew up on Long<br/>
&gt;Island (he was Jewish); he felt something was missing spiritually and<br/>
&gt;ended up in Nepal in the 70s studying with Tibetan Buddhist lamas.<br/>
&gt;He explains Buddhist teachings very clearly for a Western audience.<br/>
&gt;The specific lineage he explains is Dzochgen which is a type of<br/>
&gt;Tibetan Buddhism.<br/>

&gt;How the heck are ya mate!<br/>
&gt;Didn&#39;t realize you were on this list.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s me, though when I read the post I realized that I forgot to turn<br/>
my sigline back on after writing to a &quot;normal&quot; person.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really great thanks Buzz, and only found this list yesterday... I was<br/>
messing around on Onelist looking for unschooling lists as some of the ones<br/>
I was on seem to be dying and I missed some of the conversations, so here I<br/>
am, and it was good to see some familiar &quot;faces&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t have enough spare time to be at the computer too much these<br/>
days, life is busy especially now it&#39;s almost spring and there are kids and<br/>
lambs everywhere, fences that need work etc etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
