<div id="ygrps-yiv-326376384">Hi All,<br/>
I have been reading several post lately that include children that are<br/>
interested in game programming. I have an 11yo son who is very eager to<br/>
learn game programming and has sifted through a lot of internet research to<br/>
find stuff out. I am really thrilled to see him on his own so eager and<br/>
capable to find tid-bits of this and that, but I would love to help support<br/>
this interest and help him find a good beginner book (there just doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be anything written for a beginner at his level of understanding).<br/>
Does anyone know of good sources of info on game programming? In my research<br/>
it seems like there is a ton of different languages that different games<br/>
use. What is a good one to start with?<br/>
Also, I think it would be a great thing to get the kids that are all<br/>
interested in this to start being pen-pals. They could help each other out<br/>
by sharing the bit and pieces that they know with each other and have<br/>
someone to share their excitement with.<br/>
You can e-mail me personally if this sounds good to you. It is really<br/>
exciting to me to have kids learn from each other and often it works out<br/>
really good because they can explain things in their &quot;language&quot;.<br/>
