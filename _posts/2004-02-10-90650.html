<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713434698">Just wanted to let anyone who might be interested know that the <br/>
actual Exin castles are avail for sale on ebay.  Since I am extremly <br/>
interested in castles and the mid-evil ear in general, I decided to <br/>
see if I could find a set of them after Sandra explained what they <br/>
were.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, I found some on ebay (no big surprise there).  However, <br/>
most of the sets are sold by one person and are only by &quot;buy it <br/>
now.&quot;  Also, Exin has several Far West sets that have forts and old <br/>
west towns.  <br/>
<br/>
I bought a set of each (a castle and a fort), told my DH that it was <br/>
for our DD but it&#39;s really for me!  :)<br/>
