<div id="ygrps-yiv-366451796">Kolleen, I actually did read it in a book, but I appreciate your<br/>
additional descriptions.  I am thinking of copying it and giving it to my<br/>
husband, who is now in disagreement with me about a lot of new ways that<br/>
I have been learning .<br/>

Here&#39;s the summary:<br/>
<br/>
CONCLUSIONS <br/>
<br/>
      There is no authority in the Bible for the corporal punishment of <br/>
children with rod or otherwise, except in the Proverbs of Solomon. It is <br/>
only Solomon who recommends child-beating. Never the Lord. <br/>
<br/>
      Solomon&#39;s child-rearing methods worked very badly for his own son, <br/>
Prince Rehoboam. Solomon has an undeserved reputation for wisdom. In <br/>
reality, he left his country oppressed and impoverished. In his later <br/>
years, he turned to idol worship and practiced &quot;the abominations of <br/>
Chemosh and Moloch&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
      There is no support for he beating of youth outside of Solomon&#39;s <br/>
Proverbs. Solomon&#39;s views are controverted both by Jesus and the Apostle <br/>
John. <br/>
<br/>
      Paul warned Fathers against the anger and resentment that might be <br/>
aroused in their children by corporal punishments. The way of love was <br/>
better. <br/>
<br/>
      St. Paul deplored the punishment of youth by human fathers who <br/>
chastised youth &quot;for their own pleasure&quot;. Only divine chastisements were <br/>
righteous. <br/>
<br/>
      Jesus and John saw children as being close to God and urged love <br/>
rather than fear in education. <br/>
<br/>
      If a Christian henceforth grabs for a rod or a paddle because &quot;the <br/>
Bible says so&quot;, he is heeding the words of an idol-worshipping king, <br/>
rather than the words of Christ. <br/>
