<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368645466"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt; Also, are the websites that come up when I used<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Google reliable sources?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sources of what?  That was an interesting queston and I don&#39;t know how to<br/>
&gt; respond!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Google is as reliable (or not) as any part of the internet.  Learning to<br/>
judge reliability on the internet is an interesting study.  You&#39;ve got to be<br/>
skeptical.  You&#39;ve got to think about who it is that&#39;s putting this info out<br/>
there.  You&#39;ve got to check more than one site, and if you really want<br/>
reliability (in publishing, for instance) you&#39;d need to check the info<br/>
against other sources.  I often use Google or Yahoo as a starting point to<br/>
see just what&#39;s out there.<br/>
