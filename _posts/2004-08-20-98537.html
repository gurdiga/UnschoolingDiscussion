<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345573744"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What about seed intended for wild birds?  We just bought 50 lbs or so at<br/>
&gt;Costco for $8 or so, and I did stick my hand in and it felt great!  It <br/>
&gt;could also<br/>
&gt;be used for sorting.  You could plant some later and see what grows, and <br/>
&gt;sweep<br/>
&gt;the rest up and put it in a bird feeder, or throw it out for pigeons<br/>
&gt;somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bird seed balls!  Cut the rim off two round balloons (different colors if <br/>
possible).  Fill one with bird seed, then slip the other balloon over the <br/>
first one, covering the hole.  Very fun to squish, portable and non-messy, <br/>
for when that matters.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But do not leave one in the bottom of a big box of toys in a closet, because <br/>
when Marty finally pulled some long-term old-junk storage out of his closet <br/>
and we took the biggest box out in the yard to see what was salvageable from <br/>
when mice lived in his room for a while one winter, we found husks of birdseed <br/>
and the little balloons.<br/>
<br/>
Friends of ours who are jugglers made Marty a set of birdseed juggling balls, <br/>
and I don&#39;t know where the other two went, but one became mouse food.<br/>
<br/>
I also now recommend NOT using big boxes to store toys.   Had he sorted <br/>
things into smaller boxes or even had smaller mixed-junk boxes, that mess wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have been as big or as...    varied.   <br/>

Just passing on what we learned a couple of weeks ago. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And I washed plastic toys for hours, thinking all the while &quot;hunta virus--how <br/>
long can it live on the surface of action figures or Lego?&quot;   <br/>

If you misspell a search using Google, it often will give you a more common<br/>
search and ask if that&#39;s what you meant to search for.<br/>
