What do people often think children need to be taught?<br/>
<br/>
- to sleep through the night<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181779984">Not to mess with things... but the list could go on.<br/>
<br/>
And on and on and on.  There&#39;s a lot more things that children *could*<br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
This list, though, is intended to be a list of essentials only, right?<br/>
<br/>
In which case it could be a lot shorter, couldn&#39;t it?  I am not sure what<br/>
would go on a short list.  That&#39;s the thing with lists.  :)  They&#39;re best<br/>
for jumping off of springboard style.  You wouldn&#39;t want to keep to nothing<br/>
but the essentials for long.  Life gets a whole lot more complex very<br/>
quickly.  At which point the short list will no longer do.<br/>

<br/>
Having heard Pam&#39;s talk, I think it wasn&#39;t intended to be a list of  <br/>
all the things anyone&#39;s ever believed needed to be taught, but a list  <br/>
of samples of things real people still, in that moment, believe need  <br/>
to be taught.   Everyone probably has some ideas of what can&#39;t be  <br/>
learned naturally.<br/>
