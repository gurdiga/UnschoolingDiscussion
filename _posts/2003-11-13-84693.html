Johnson County : Fire kills girl, 10, chained to bed<br/>
BY ERIC HAND<br/>
<br/>
Posted on Thursday, November 13, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Nothing was left in Molly Holts bedroom except an electric heater, a bed<br/>
frame, a chain and the two padlocks that kept her from escaping the fire<br/>
that killed her early Monday morning, Johnson County sheriff s deputies<br/>
said. <br/>
<br/>
The fire destroyed her familys wooden, two-bedroom home on County Road<br/>
4430 about eight miles north of Clarksville. <br/>
<br/>
Deputies arrested her parents after discovering the 10-year-old girl was<br/>
chained at her ankle and padlocked to the bed frame. <br/>
<br/>
On Wednesday, Circuit Judge Dennis Sutterfield set a cash bond of<br/>
$100,000 each for Lloyd Lee Holt, 32, and Teresa Dick, 31, who escaped<br/>
the fire with their two other children, Johnson County Chief Deputy Jerry<br/>
Dorney said. He believed the other children were about 3 and 5. <br/>
<br/>
The fire began about 11 p.m. Sunday in the front of the house near<br/>
Mollys bedroom, Dorney said. Investigators believe the fire was<br/>
electrical, and arson wasnt suspected, he said. <br/>
<br/>
Holt, Dick and the two younger children escaped through a window in the<br/>
back bedroom where they were sleeping, Dorney said. <br/>
<br/>
Nearly two hours later, when firefighters and deputies arrived, the house<br/>
was gone, except for its tin roof and brick chimney, he said. <br/>
<br/>
In the two hours after the start of the fire, the family apparently tried<br/>
to make a 911 call. Their phone was burned. The keys to their car and<br/>
pickup lay somewhere in the fire. The nearest neighbor lived more than a<br/>
half-mile away, Dorney said. <br/>
<br/>
They set off on foot  Holt in coveralls, Dick in a raincoat, and the two<br/>
surviving children in their underwear, Prosecuting Attorney David Gibbons<br/>
said. A passing couple picked the family up and took them to Holts<br/>
brothers residence, Dorney said. <br/>
<br/>
There they finally made a 911 call at 12:45 a.m. <br/>
<br/>
Holt and his brother, Henry Holt Jr., returned to the rubble and met<br/>
deputies as they arrived. Lloyd Holt told them his daughter was inside<br/>
and he wasnt able to get her out, Dorney said. <br/>
<br/>
Deputies found Mollys skeletal remains under the bed frame. <br/>
<br/>
A metal link chain was looped around the frame and twice around her left<br/>
ankle, where two padlocks secured her, Deputy Coroner Ashley Davis said. <br/>
<br/>
Davis pronounced Molly dead at 2:39 a.m. He said she probably woke up and<br/>
tried to crawl to the door but died of smoke inhalation. Very little of<br/>
her body remained by the time he arrived, he said. &quot;Every time I think<br/>
Ive seen everything, you see something new. It just blows your mind,&quot;<br/>
Davis said. &quot;You cant even imagine it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Gibbons said he would likely charge the couple with manslaughter. He said<br/>
it was no justification, but the girl &quot;may have been mentally challenged<br/>
to some degree and may have had some behavioral problems.&quot; He didnt<br/>
think the chaining was a recent development. The girl may have received<br/>
special schooling in Clarksville, Gibbons said. <br/>
<br/>
Joy Wilson, director of Forrester-Davis Center for the Developmentally<br/>
Disabled in Clarksville, could not be reached for comment. Julie Munsell,<br/>
spokesman for Department of Human Services, cited federal privacy laws<br/>
when declining to reveal any health-related services Molly received. But<br/>
she said the department had assigned investigators to ensure the welfare<br/>
of the surviving children. <br/>
<br/>
Molly hadnt attended school for three years, according to Clarksville<br/>
Superintendent Don Johnston. Johnston said Molly transferred to the<br/>
district in 1999 and completed first grade in 2000. <br/>
<br/>
In August 2000, Dick filed paperwork allowing home schooling for her<br/>
daughter, Johnston said. <br/>
<br/>
Holt and Dick were being held Wednesday in the Johnson County jail in<br/>
lieu of bond. The surviving children are with Holts brother, Dorney<br/>
said. Holt and Dick are scheduled for arraignment in Circuit Court on<br/>
Jan. 15.</div>

Remember to say...it happened at night, while the child was sleeping, just as <br/>
if she were in public school.  <br/>
<br/>
sad and horrifying.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know this family but the report said that the girl was at least<br/>
rumored to have mental or behavioral issues.<br/>
<br/>
I have worked in psychiatric facilities and homes for children with severe<br/>
and profound mental retardation.  Restraints are certainly not uncommon,<br/>
would not be considered abuse by the powers that be.  For example, one child<br/>
would repeatedly chew on his hands like an infant.  Not a problem for an<br/>
infant because they grow out of it.  When the child has been doing it for 17<br/>
years, the tissue breaks down and infections set in.  I remember this child<br/>
in restraints for hours long periods each day.  It was ordered by her doctor<br/>
and considered therapeutic.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I guess it brings us back to the fact that, yes, some parents can and will<br/>
&gt; use the privacy of homeschooling to conceal abuse and/or neglect. There<br/>
are even<br/>
&gt; people who abuse children in the name of homeschooling. It doesn&#39;t justify<br/>
&gt; laws that make it hard to homeschool (because it&#39;s not that hard to<br/>
conceal<br/>
&gt; anyway), but we can&#39;t pretend it doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Argh....that poor girl.<br/>
