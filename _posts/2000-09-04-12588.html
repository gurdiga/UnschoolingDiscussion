<div id="ygrps-yiv-230150446">not only that Nance but TX teachers *TEACH* the TAAS test<br/>
ALLLLLLLLlllllllllllll YEARRRRRRRRRRRRR LONGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG ... and ...<br/>
after the tests are completed in the spring, they have parties in their<br/>
classrooms to CELEBRATE; give me a *break*!!!   another pathetic thing that<br/>
happens is *some* teachers have been caught HELPING their students by giving<br/>
answers (gotta get those correct answers @ all costs, don&#39;t you know) BUT<br/>
THE ANSWERS WERE *WRONG*!!!  (ha)<br/>
<br/>
for a good chuckle or if you&#39;re really bored, you can take a look @ the TAAS<br/>
test for yourself @ their website and see how ridiculous this test really is<br/>
... and ... don&#39;t forget the kidlets STUDY FOR IT!!!  BLAH :P<br/>

&gt; I was taken by how impressed everyone in the article is that X% &quot;passed&quot;<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; TAAS.  This is not a particularly demanding test, and all the focus seems<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be on how many kids can pass it.  Not do well on it.  Just pass.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So we are going to spend lots and lots of hours aiming at the lower half<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the class and making sure everyone can pass a meaningless test.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh goodie.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, where was that web page about the Independent Party.  They may lose<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; at least I don&#39;t have to hear this particular brand of hogwash.<br/>
