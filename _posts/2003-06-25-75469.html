<div id="ygrps-yiv-643980645">&lt;&lt; They mostly prescribe topical drying<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; agents or, in severe cases, antibiotics.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    A friend&#39;s brother had bad acne and started using  Dial soap on his face. <br/>
 Yup, the cheap yellow stuff.  The antibacterial properties seem to be what <br/>
cleared it up. If it&#39;s really bacteria, it seems wiser to topically apply then <br/>
take pills internally, anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
    This was after using special systems that cost a fortune, like <br/>
Proactive(?), dermatologists, prescriptions, ect.   It seems like it would be drying, I <br/>
can&#39;t stand using that stuff on my hands, much less my face, but if you&#39;re <br/>
oily, I suppose that wouldn&#39;t be much of a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
My two cents on what worked for one person, at least a bar of $2 soap isn&#39;t <br/>
an expensive experiment.  <br/>
