Just been reading this informative article by Sandra and found it  <br/>
helpful. My two girls often come and say they are bored. It usually  <br/>
results in them sitting on my lap for a one on one chat about  <br/>
something then by us tickling each other relentlessly and having fun  <br/>
laughing together. Then after a while they usually skip off saying  <br/>
they had remembered about something they wanted to do earlier and  <br/>
off  they go to another part of the house.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes worry about my children in that I may not be providing  <br/>
them with enough of myself if my energy tanks are low and I am  <br/>
exhausted some evenings.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Sandra, your article made me not feel like I am doing anything  <br/>
negative and strengthened my belief in what I am doing.<br/>
