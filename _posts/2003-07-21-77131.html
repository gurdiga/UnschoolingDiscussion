 </span></blockquote>My son is 9, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you, and others on the list can help me out.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something that just happened here that is a good example of an issue <br/>
that  I have been dealing with lately, and I need some advice.<br/>
<br/>
When my son and his friend came up to get his walkie talkies, they were here <br/>
for a while, and went outside.  When I went to the kitchen I noticed the back <br/>
door was open.  Now, earlier, when they came in, I mentioned to them to please <br/>
close the door, the air conditioning was on, he said it was already closed, <br/>
no problem.  <br/>
<br/>
But when they left, I guess Alex went first, and his friend didn&#39;t close the <br/>
door behind him.  I went outside and told Alex what had happened.  He told me <br/>
he was sorry, that the cats could have gotten outside. ( we have two indoor <br/>
cats, I don&#39;t really care that much about the ac, but I was upset about the cats <br/>
possibly getting out, and so was he).  I asked him if he could please leave <br/>
the house last to make sure the door gets closed, he said sure.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, that&#39;s all fine and good.  And maybe I&#39;m expecting too much at his age, <br/>
or maybe this will develop as he gets older, but things like this happen all <br/>
the time, and he feels sorry afterwards, but it doesn&#39;t *seem* to make him any <br/>
more aware *next time* he makes a choice, even in a similar situation.  He <br/>
just does whatever occurs to him at the time, still very impulsive. <br/>
<br/>
Is it too early, age wise, maturity wise, for me to expect him to look down <br/>
the line a few choices later and see where he could possibly get in trouble? Is <br/>
that kind of abstract thought too ambitious a desire for him?  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if that is something that *I think* he should do, but not a <br/>
reasonable thing to expect from him.  Now, I tend to be a control freak, I am aware of <br/>
it, is this my controlling nature and I&#39;m putting it onto him?<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s becoming so independent, so fast, and he just doesn&#39;t have the life <br/>
experience yet to make good decisions, and he&#39;s still at the point where he is <br/>
learning from his mistakes, instead of what I think he should be starting on, <br/>
which is to make better, more thought out decisions that help him avoid those <br/>
mistakes in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe, like Sandra said earlier, I should be journaling about these things <br/>
instead of writing to the list, but, I have been considering this for a while, <br/>
and I am stuck, I need perspective.  And I trust you guys to give me the <br/>
straight shit.  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things can I do, not coercive, but to help him, make better <br/>
decisions on his own.  He feels badly after things like this, and I don&#39;t think <br/>
that guilt is helping him make better decisions.   I want to help him, but it&#39;s <br/>
almost like I don&#39;t trust myself to do a good job helping him with this, that <br/>
some of the guilt he feels is my fault for not helping him enough.  <br/>
<br/>
*sigh*  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s something he can be conscious of unless<br/>
there were some huge reason that would make it more important than what is<br/>
important to his 9 yo self.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told this story before so those who&#39;ve heard it can roll their eyes and<br/>
move on ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We have  bright hallway and a dark bathroom so even in the day it&#39;s natural<br/>
to turn on the light. But when coming out the bright hallway gives no clue<br/>
the light behind you is still on. I&#39;ve left it on dozens of times even<br/>
though I&#39;m pretty contientious about turning off lights.<br/>
<br/>
How could the rest of the family make me turn it off every time I leave the<br/>
bathroom? Should the yell at me? Should they punish me? Should they shame<br/>
me? Should they sit me down and have a discussion with me?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a solution that would make me be more aware. I do turn it off<br/>
later, as do others, when they see it on.<br/>
<br/>
What about some automatic closer for the door? If money&#39;s tight, what about<br/>
designing something with a weight and pulley?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I have no great answers that will solve the *problem* other to say I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s a big deal. He doesn&#39;t seem to be forgetting things that would<br/>
really cause harm to him or someone else. I do understand about the cats<br/>
though as we have 2 indoor only ones here also. Maybe a bell on the door<br/>
would remind him as he&#39;s opening it, and it makes noise that it needs to be<br/>
closed. Would be easier than even a hinge.<br/>
<br/>
As far as forgetting though, just the fact that he seems to care later makes<br/>
it just that he forgets. With kids, and some adults as well, they can just<br/>
have so much on their minds, or one very important thing, that they bipass<br/>
everything else.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 middle kids are 7 and 8. They both play chess quite well, so the<br/>
thinking ahead is very much there. But they forget things a lot too. It&#39;s<br/>
just not important to them. I asked Joseph to get me something yesterday. I<br/>
gave him specific instructions as to where it was in my purse. He came back<br/>
and said it wasn&#39;t there. I went and looked and it was right where I said it<br/>
was. He had everything right but the inside of the purse part, he looked on<br/>
the outside of it. He got most of the imformation right but didn&#39;t quite<br/>
keep all the parts intact. It wasn&#39;t real important to him. He was doing me<br/>
a favor and had all the intentions of getting it done, just didn&#39;t work out<br/>
that way. So I do just what my husband does, or I do for him when one of us<br/>
forgets. Sometimes a reminder and most times it just gets done by one of us.<br/>
It does get better as they get older and hang onto non important thoughts<br/>
better. The one thing I do find works for my children, when something is<br/>
important to me, is to have them look at me while I&#39;m asking for the favor.<br/>
Someimes just asking over the kitchen counter isn&#39;t enough. They hear me but<br/>
really aren&#39;t listening!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rain is a pretty darn wonderful 10 yr old, mature for her age in many<br/>
ways, helpful, responsible... but this is exactly the kind of thing she<br/>
does, and it&#39;s exactly what gets under my skin. When I lose it with her<br/>
(and I do, rarely, but sometimes I yell) it&#39;s generally about something<br/>
that she did without thinking - and usually I&#39;m yelling something like,<br/>
&quot;Think! Why don&#39;t you *think* before you do things?!?&quot;. It does seem odd,<br/>
that she can think through these really long intricate strategies for<br/>
games and pretending and such, but she can&#39;t remember to put away her<br/>
laundry before the cat lies on it and sheds and dumps it onto the floor<br/>
where it gets dirty, and then she puts it back in the dirty laundry<br/>
hamper... or to not leave sugary stuff in her room until the ants invade.<br/>
Stuff like that... I&#39;m not sure it has to do with lack of life<br/>
experience, for Rain anyway. If she thought it through she&#39;d figure out<br/>
why what she was doing wasn&#39;t a good idea, but she doesn&#39;t think to do<br/>
that. Her mind is on other things...<br/>
<br/>
What I try to do (and I don&#39;t think yelling is a good thing to do, and I<br/>
do apologize when I do it) is to remember these things myself, and to try<br/>
to set up the situation so she will make the better choice. When I give<br/>
her laundry to put away I ask if she can put it away right then, and if<br/>
not I keep it in the basket. If I see her going off with a snack I try to<br/>
ask her a few hours later if all the dishes are out of her room. (This<br/>
would all be much easier if she would actually permit me to enter her<br/>
room, but she won&#39;t, usually). It does seem better now than when she was<br/>
8 or 9.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m one of those who didn&#39;t have a real stellar childhood, and this<br/>
sort of forgetting was not dealt with very kindly (I remember being made<br/>
to drink from the toilet once because I forgot to flush), so it hasn&#39;t<br/>
been easy. Rain may struggle not to yell at her kids when she has them,<br/>
but I believe that she won&#39;t have the same struggles not to hit them.<br/>

also enlist my oldest daughter&#39;s help in helping me remember things (like<br/>

<br/>
Maybe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have littler kids too?  Sometimes when a mom has little kids and<br/>
looks at that nine year old he looks really big and ready for<br/>
responsibility. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes even when there are no younger kids it&#39;s hard to remember that<br/>
bright, witty, cleaver person is &quot;only&quot; nine, and nine is still so young.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll get there.   Right now the running commentary in his head isn&#39;t<br/>
about taking care of things around the house and meeting other peoples<br/>
needs and being responsible.  Right now it&#39;s just about nine year old<br/>
stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s pretty cool that kids can be kids and not have bigger<br/>
worries that household or family stuff might suffer if he&#39;s not on top of<br/>
things.   I think it&#39;s a credit to his parents that he&#39;s still idealistic<br/>
at nine and taking for granted his parents are managing things he doesn&#39;t<br/>
need to worry about. <br/>
<br/>
We had sick and dying people in our house when Dylan was eight and nine. <br/>
 He became very responsible because he saw every minute of every day how<br/>
many important things needed to be done.  If I could erase that I would,<br/>
and give him back his eight year old self before all the big reality of<br/>
life hit him.   <br/>
<br/>
***What kinds of things can I do, not coercive, but to help him, make<br/>
better <br/>
decisions on his own. ***<br/>
<br/>
Just love him and think about how young nine really is.  Patient<br/>
reminders and help about important things will do wonders.   Thinking how<br/>
cool it would be to be nine again and not have all that responsibility<br/>
about family members and critters and laundry and bills might stir some<br/>
sweet feelings in you when you&#39;re most frustrated at being the one who<br/>
has to remember everything for everyone. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234714245">Chit-chat about why things happened the way the did. Predict in advance <br/>
how things will turn out and then talk about why your prediction was <br/>
accurate or not.<br/>
<br/>
There is a fun game to play that sort of emphasizes thinking ahead - <br/>
you can do it as teams as a sort of party game or just as individuals <br/>
just to play around.<br/>
<br/>
Each person (team) writes each step involved in making a peanut butter <br/>
sandwich (or some other process - make up different ones). Write them <br/>
sequentially, one step at a time, and try to write every single thing <br/>
down that has to be done. Then another person or team gets up with some <br/>
supplies (preset so that everybody knew in advance what the supplies <br/>
were and where they were, etc.) and follows the directions as the first <br/>
team reads them off - but just one step at a time. So - if you said: <br/>
&quot;Dip the knife into the peanut butter,&quot; you&#39;d better have first said, <br/>
&quot;Open the drawer,&quot; &quot;Take the knife from the drawer,&quot; and &quot;Open the <br/>
cupboard,&quot; &quot;Take the peanut butter from the cupboard,&quot; and &quot;Open the <br/>
jar of peanut butter,&quot; because if you didn&#39;t already say all those <br/>
things, its going to be pretty hard to dip a nonexistent knife (since <br/>
you didn&#39;t get it from the drawer into an invisible and unopened jar of <br/>
peanut butter.&quot;  Laugh at how hard it is to think of everything - have <br/>
fun. Make allowances, don&#39;t be so strict that it isn&#39;t fun - as soon as <br/>
they realize they&#39;ve left out a critical step and what the consequences <br/>
are - go ahead and let them fill in the needed steps so they can move <br/>
on. The point is to have fun and, on the side, there is a certain <br/>
amount of focus on planning ahead &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
