<br/>
I think especially in the beginning, when we&#39;re trying this new way of <br/>
thinking and dealing with our kids, that people expect instant results.  <br/>
Actually, at least with Love and Logic, nothing is instant.  We consider <br/>
childhood a training ground for turning out responsible adults.  That takes <br/>
some time.  And practice.  And fine tuning to see what works with your <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I can honestly say that after employing Love and Logic for the last two years <br/>
with our kids, we&#39;ve had some really good results.  But, it was a learning <br/>
process for all of us.  As we were experimenting with all this, if we gave <br/>
our 3 year old two choices, and if she refused to accept those two choices, <br/>
we learned to make the choice for her.  On certain occasions she has <br/>
surprised us with a third choice that is perfectly acceptable to us.  Like:  <br/>
Do you want to sit quietly, or do you want to go to your room for a while?  <br/>
She said, I&#39;d rather go sit in the kitchen.  Fine -- she has made a choice, <br/>
retained some control and dignity, and we have what we want.  She&#39;s stopped <br/>
jumping on the couch.  If she says, NO, I won&#39;t stop jumping, she is still <br/>
young enough that I can pick her up and carry her away from jumping on the <br/>
couch, and I tell her in a calm voice that continuing to jump was not a <br/>
choice, and that since she wouldn&#39;t make a choice, I had to do it for her.  <br/>
Then I would say, Do you want to walk to your room, or should I carry you?  <br/>
She learned in short order that continuing the behavior was not an acceptable <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
We employ a broken record approach, too.  As calmly as we can, we repeat, <br/>
That is not a choice.  Your choices are. . .  They say, NO, I want to do <br/>
this.  Again, that is not a choice.  Your choices are . . .  Okay, since you <br/>
won&#39;t make a choice, I have to do it for you.  I choose. . .<br/>
<br/>
For Love and Logic to work, you have to be willing to allow your children to <br/>
live with the consequences of their actions (just like we do!).  Now, if my <br/>
son, who is now 8, refused to stop or accept one of those choices, he&#39;s a <br/>
little more difficult to physically control.  You may not want to risk the <br/>
natural consequences of allowing your child to fall off the couch, so <br/>
sometimes we have to &quot;manufacture&quot; consequences.  Then, we go for the <br/>
thinking words:  People who jump on couches often fall and hurt themselves.  <br/>
People who jump on couches don&#39;t get dessert (or TV, or Nintendo, or whatever <br/>
the treat of the moment is).  We didn&#39;t tell him not to jump on the couch, <br/>
and his choices are implicit:  if he chooses to jump on the couch he could <br/>
get hurt and he will lose dessert.  For particularly obstinate situations, <br/>
we&#39;d up the ante until we got the behavior we needed, but we would rarely <br/>
tell him to outright stop.  That we save for truly dangerous situations (like <br/>
tonight when he started to walk out into a line of traffic in a parking lot <br/>
while he was looking at his new Pokemon cards).  We were so surprised when, <br/>
in pretty short order, he started responding.  He realized that he had <br/>
choices to make and that we were willing to make those for him and to stand <br/>
by the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, kids can really play us like a violin.  If they suspect that we&#39;ll <br/>
give in, they&#39;ll keep at us until we do.  In Love and Logic, we give many <br/>
choices because we want our children to learn to make responsible choices as <br/>
teens and adults.  We also let them live with the consequences because those <br/>
consequences are a much better teacher than any words or orders I give them.  <br/>
<br/>
It takes practice, and I tell my workshop participants from the get go that <br/>
some methods and devices and words and choices work better than others on <br/>
different children.  It takes consistency and practice.  And it takes time to <br/>
learn to craft appropriate choices and thinking words and consequences.  <br/>
That&#39;s why we do a 4 or 6 week workshop -- to give people lots of time to <br/>
experiment and practice in class, to bring their problem situations to the <br/>
class for comment and suggestions, to share successes.  I don&#39;t mean to make <br/>
this sound like a commercial for Love and Logic, but if anyone is interested <br/>
enough to participate in a workshop, you might want to log onto <br/>
www.loveandlogic.com for more information.  There&#39;s a lot of interesting <br/>
stuff there.  They can also give names of people in your area who give <br/>
workshops.  <br/>
