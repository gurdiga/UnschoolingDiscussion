Subject: Homeschoolers in the library<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
        I was asked by a local parent to make support for homeschoolers in<br/>
the library my research project.  My research, so far, shows a growing<br/>
interest by public librarians in providing resources for this particular<br/>
group of parents and children.  On the other hand, the Internet and books<br/>
with lists of resources for homeschools seldom, if ever, mention using the<br/>
public library.  So, for my project, I thought I would see 1) what resources<br/>
the public libraries provide; 2) who uses those resources and how often; and<br/>
3) what resources the parent/teacher and children need/want.  I suppose I<br/>
could ask the libraries, but I thought the real answers would/should come<br/>
from the homeschoolers themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
    Please send the attached questionnaire to any homeschoolers you are able<br/>
to reach and ask that they send the reply to me at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:maryann-w@...">maryann-w@...</a>.  <br/>

Thank you.<br/>
