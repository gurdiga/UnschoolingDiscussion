<div id="ygrps-yiv-734864358">I was wondering if anyone has any opinions of the Sudbury Schools.  <br/>
There is one about an hour from me, and I&#39;ve been toying with the <br/>
idea.  The Circle School&#39;s website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.circleschool.org/">http://www.circleschool.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted before about my daughter feeling like she needs more time <br/>
with friends, that there&#39;s not kids her age on our block and she&#39;s <br/>
not getting a lot of free play time with homeschooled kids.  I was <br/>
thinking maybe it would be a solution.  Maybe they would allow part <br/>
time enrollment, maybe 2 days a week, which would be perfect.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone&#39;s not familiar with this style of school, it&#39;s not <br/>
very &quot;schoolish&quot; at all.  It is a building with a ton of resources <br/>
and adults as resource persons where kids have the freedom to do what <br/>
they want all day.  Kids and adults all have equal votes in <br/>
everything, including the hiring and firing of teachers.</div>

<br/>
A friend from my homeschool group just moved to Oregon because of a Sudbury <br/>
school. Her and her two children saw a program about it, I think it may have <br/>
been 60 Minutes. Anyway, as soon as it was over, both of her children said <br/>
that&#39;s where they wanted to go. She had been pretty relaxed with them on <br/>
homeschooling. They were both getting older and looking for something else. <br/>
So, for her children, she up and moved to Oregon. That was the only place <br/>
that had a Sudbury school that was public. She couldn&#39;t afford the other <br/>
ones. I haven&#39;t heard from her as of yet but if you would like to know how <br/>
the kids are faring, (I would) I can try to find her.<br/>

have heard is some people say it&#39;s warm and inviting and some people say the<br/>
opposite. So it sounds like, as with any group, a lot depends on the child<br/>
and on the mix of children who happen to be there at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
And some of the offshoots have changed the original idea and may be more<br/>
eclectic than unschoolish.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Teenagers go to school out of state lots.<br/>
Specialty schools (arts, theatre) draw families to other states pretty <br/>
regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my kids don&#39;t go to school, a school is one thing I think would <br/>
be worth moving and buying another house for.   If one of them DID need a <br/>
particular teacher or school for something important to them, I&#39;d think about <br/>
it.    If I were unhappy where I was or a single mom, I would JUMP at it.<br/>
<br/>
Moving for a job seems less important to me (depending on the job, of <br/>
course--a professorship somewhere, or a vice-presidency of something, that&#39;s <br/>
moving stuff for sure).  Moving to be near relatives or friends seems good.  <br/>
Moving to avoid unemployment has ancient roots.  But just moving to get a few <br/>
thousand dollars more a year, uprooting kids for chance of a slightly better <br/>
life, seems not as desirable to me.  Maybe because I don&#39;t like change in my <br/>
personal life so much.  And I saw the sadness in kids who had to move too <br/>
much when they were little, who came through my school or neighborhood for a <br/>
year or less.  And I wasn&#39;t in a military town.<br/>
<br/>
I hope those kids really like that Sudbury school and make some friends to <br/>
last their whole lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066516968">My best friend&#39;s son (who is my son&#39;s best friend!) attends a Sudbury School <br/>
in the Hartford , CT area, which just started. Nick was heavily involved in <br/>
the planning, etc., and really feels like the school is HIS. I don&#39;t know <br/>
about schools that have moved away from the basic philosophy, but it&#39;s <br/>
supposed to be pretty much an unschooling school. Even young children can <br/>
determine what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE rules, but they are determined by the kids. Nick, having left <br/>
public school to do this, LOVES it. And this is still a very small, new <br/>
place. If you have more specific questions about it, I&#39;m sure he and his mom <br/>
would be happy to answer them.<br/>
<br/>
I would say the big difference is that Sudbury Schools do not stress learning <br/>
as a family like unschooling does. But if for some reason I HAD to send my <br/>
son back to school, I&#39;d like it to be a Sudbury School.<br/>

said that they run from 1500-9500 depending on income level.  That&#39;s <br/>
nothing that I heard or read from the school officially though. I <br/>
also read on their site that you can do a one week trial before you <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have friends whose children go to the (public charter) Sudbury-<br/>
type school that is here. I think we actually have two of them in <br/>
this area. The kids that go there seem to really enjoy it and get a <br/>
lot out of it. If my kids wanted to go to school when they&#39;re older, <br/>
I can easily see them gravitating towards something like this, as it <br/>
seems to have the same basic respect for children determining their <br/>
own life paths and learning that we do at home. <br/>
<br/>
I have heard some negative things about democratic schools, and like <br/>
anything, I think the dynamic of the school probably depends a lot on <br/>
the kids and parents involved in it at any given time. As they are <br/>
run by democratic process, they are probably more fluid and change <br/>
more over time than more traditional beauracracies.<br/>
