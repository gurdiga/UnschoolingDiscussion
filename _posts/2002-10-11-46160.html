<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562557777">Background:<br/>
I&#39;m a Brownie Girl Scout leader.  Last year I was a co-leader in a Daisy<br/>
troop of 6 girls, with the only homeschooler being my daughter (there<br/>
are currently no homeschool troops in the area and no interest,<br/>
either).  My co-leader and I, became Brownie leaders with the same group<br/>
of girls plus 7 more this year (all new Brownies, and ALL public or<br/>
private schooled).  9 are 6 year olds, 3 are 7 year olds, 1 is an 8 year<br/>
old.  <br/>
<br/>
Problem:<br/>
Our meetings start being very chaotic and stressful for me, my<br/>
co-leader, and most importantly, the girls.  The only way that the chaos<br/>
has been minimized is when the girls are given a thousand rules.  The<br/>
&quot;main&quot; leader over the whole troop has seen these girls go wild and has<br/>
come over shouting out rules &quot;No one can throw away their trash until<br/>
the whole group can go together.&quot; &quot;No one is allowed to go to the<br/>
restroom until after circle time, then only in pairs.&quot;  &quot;No one is<br/>
allowed to touch another paint until the lid of the old one is put back<br/>
on.&quot;  &quot;No one is allowed to wiggle.&quot; etc. etc. etc.  This is stifling<br/>
the girls, but whenever I try a more unschooling approach (what an<br/>
oxymoron!) everyone goes wild.  When &quot;we&quot; demand them to listen, they<br/>
don&#39;t.  When &quot;we&quot; demand silence, they whisper.  on and on.  I say &quot;we&quot;<br/>
because even though I am not the one enforcing or shouting these rules,<br/>
the girls view me in the lump of &quot;Authority figures that demand this&quot;,<br/>
so I am a party to it, especially when I haven&#39;t been able to come up<br/>
with any alternatives.  I&#39;m definitely an introvert and this is draining<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
With the new girls, there is a pre-established clique of 3 and they are<br/>
driving me bananas, too.  They always vote together, sit together<br/>
(ignoring everyone else), etc.  When I&#39;ve separated them (so that they<br/>
could learn the names of the other girls and vice versa), they&#39;ve<br/>
ignored the other girls and have just talked louder to each other.  <br/>
<br/>
Many of the girls aren&#39;t feeling listened to.  I am trying my best to<br/>
hear them, but the others aren&#39;t letting this happen.  The rigidness<br/>
that the main leader invokes works (temporarily) and that can be calming<br/>
to me.  The girls hate it and I hate it because of that.  It is not the<br/>
way I thrived best as a young girl, either.  I just don&#39;t see any<br/>
different solution from the adult standpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Questions:<br/>
Should I quit?<br/>
Should I take my daughter out of Girl Scouts entirely since we both get<br/>
stifled in such a rigid environment?<br/>
Should I try to change the whole troop dynamics?<br/>
Should we go over a written list of &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;expectations&quot; or<br/>
something of that sort?  I know my daughter wouldn&#39;t like that, but<br/>
these &quot;schooled&quot; girls seem to only follow that sort of direction,<br/>
rather than internal rights and wrongs.<br/>
Should I get the group split in half?  (This actually wouldn&#39;t work,<br/>
since a Brownie troop &quot;has&quot; to be a minimum of 8.)<br/>
Girl Scouts is seeming so &quot;schooly&quot; to me and in all the negative ways. <br/>
I&#39;ve heard others on this list say that they have their girls in troops,<br/>
so what can I do to make my troop more successful like theirs?<br/>
<br/>
What I could really use are some real life suggestions on how to make<br/>
this work.  The girls are all really good and kind and smart.  However,<br/>
they are clearly brainwashed into thinking that whenever &quot;they&quot; are in<br/>
charge of what is going on, then it is free rein to be wild banshees.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think that I can change that in 2 hours a week, but I&#39;d love to.<br/>
<br/>
All suggestions welcome.<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  I&#39;m really getting a lot out of this list.  Every question that<br/>
I&#39;ve posted so far has really been listened to and answered.  I<br/>
appreciate that and I feel that I am a better person and a better mother<br/>
for all of your help.  Many thanks!!!!</div>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter is a junior girl scout this year (she&#39;s 9). She did 6 months<br/>
of (as we call it) Dysfunctional Brownies, and she loved the concept but<br/>
was really frustrated by the chaos and arguing (kids and adults). The<br/>
troop she&#39;s in now has 9 or 10 girls, and the rest have been together for<br/>
three years. The leader started unschooling a couple years ago, and her<br/>
daughter is Rain&#39;s best friend (and her other daughter is the co-leader).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been an interesting ride. The girls are all really, really different<br/>
from each other - some are in the Britney Spears and &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so fat!&quot;<br/>
mode already, some live in really dysfunctional families. Two are from<br/>
another culture and try very hard to be quiet and respectful, and are<br/>
often aghast at the noise and activity level of the other girls. From<br/>
what I hear, the first year or so was rough, but they have really banded<br/>
together and become a group, and they&#39;ve welcomed Rain as part of the<br/>
group. <br/>
<br/>
I think it will probably take time for the girls, especially the new<br/>
girls, to gel as a group. I don&#39;t think rigid rules will help with this<br/>
in the long run, although they seem to help in the short run. As I<br/>
understand it, girl scouts are supposed to be about the girls being<br/>
decision-makers, and maybe you could point that out to the co-leader. I<br/>
would also try to plan really active meetings - since most of the kids<br/>
have been in school all day, I imagine they really need to let loose.<br/>
Maybe you could have a clean up the playground day, or a scavenger hunt,<br/>
or try some sports - just tire &#39;em out, but also focus on activities that<br/>
build a sense of community. It seems that the more they&#39;re interested in<br/>
the activities and feel ownership, the easier it will be to get them<br/>
focused. Also, if they have a goal to work towards - Rain&#39;s brownie troop<br/>
went horseback riding - that might help them focus more.<br/>
<br/>
I actally think going over (or creating) a list of rules or guidelines<br/>
would be helpful, especially with input from the girls. You could start<br/>
with the girl scout law and promise, I think they talk about stuff like<br/>
that... but it probably would help everyone feel safer to at least know<br/>
what the expectations are. Rules like &quot;Be quiet when the leader is<br/>
talking&quot;  seems rigid and not so community-building, but since there is<br/>
something in the girl scout stuff about being a sister to other girl<br/>
scouts, something like &quot;treat troop members and leaders with<br/>
consideration&quot; might work better.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think things will change overnight, and there may always be a<br/>
fair amount of noise and chaos. Honestly, I couldn&#39;t lead a troop,<br/>
because I have a pretty low tolerance for that. Rain&#39;s leaders, however,<br/>
are much better at going with the flow, and they can see when things are<br/>
just loud and active, and when they&#39;re out of control. There are a fair<br/>
numbr of arguments, too, and there are girls that stick together and one<br/>
girl who apparently annoys just about everyone - but she&#39;s still<br/>
included.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116084623">I have some experience with this.  When my daughter was 6, I led a <br/>
Brownie troop.  It wasn&#39;t unschool-style at all.  I planned <br/>
everything, although I picked things I knew they would like.  I had 8 <br/>
girls.  2 of them were a big problem.  They stole, destroyed other <br/>
people&#39;s projects, and made things generally difficult.  They are a <br/>
big part of the reason why I quit.  The other reason was all the <br/>
rules and paperwork anytime we wanted to go aywhere. Also just that I <br/>
felt I wasn&#39;t giving my boys as much time as I was giving my <br/>
daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
I took a year off, then got together with a friend and had a troop <br/>
with just three girls--her two and my one.  It worked out nice.  <br/>
<br/>
This year, I decided to go with a regular troop again.  I called a <br/>
few girls from our old troop and was going to open the troop up to 15 <br/>
girls at the sign ups our council was having.  Then they started <br/>
giving me trouble.  They started telling me that my  friend&#39;s <br/>
daughter (who plays with my daughter all the time) couldn&#39;t be in the <br/>
troop.  My friend&#39;s daughter is 7, and the guidelines for being in a <br/>
troop are at least age 8 or grades 3,4,5, and 6.  I signed her up as <br/>
a fourth grader and they wouldn&#39;t let me do it.  They said they were <br/>
concerned that the material is too much for a 7 year old.  I said <br/>
that her mom wasn&#39;t concerned, would be present at all meetings, and <br/>
that the mom&#39;s decision should be enough.  They kept insisting that a <br/>
7 year old is a 2nd grader and that&#39;s all there is to it.  Then they <br/>
said I couldn&#39;t have the meetings in my house.  I said forget it, I&#39;m <br/>
done with the girl scout organization!  So now we have a &quot;girls&#39; <br/>
club&quot; in our house.  It is totally unschooled style.  The girls pick <br/>
all of the activities. I told them that I would do everything in my <br/>
power to help them do the activities that they want to do.  We will <br/>
also have some fundraisers to help with the costs of activities. <br/>
However, I had the luxury of choosing who I invite and have no <br/>
problems with any of the girls in the group.  <br/>
<br/>
I did find some places on the web with badges in stock and was either <br/>
going to buy sashes for them or sew them. (www.joycrest.com is the <br/>
best badge place I found).  But they said they would rather make <br/>
scrapbooks up of their activities instead of buying badges, so I&#39;ll <br/>
just bring the digital camera along to our activities.    <br/>
<br/>
I checked with my insurance agent and he said that my home liability <br/>
insurance is enough to cover this type of thing.  I also had the <br/>
parents sign liability waivers and forms giving me permission to take <br/>
them to the emergency room.  <br/>
<br/>
I threw that out because it is one option you might want to <br/>
consider.  <br/>
<br/>
If you keep the existing troop going, then maybe you might want to <br/>
consider choosing activities and meeting places where they can run <br/>
wild.  Maybe they need to &quot;deschool&quot; from the idea that when they&#39;re <br/>
in charge they run wild.  Maybe meet at playgrounds for awhile.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know if you live in an area where there are a lot of <br/>
playgrounds that you could drive to in a reasonable amount of time, <br/>
but if you do, maybe you could have meetings at 4 different <br/>
playgrounds and then vote on which was your troop&#39;s favorite <br/>
playground.  Then maybe you could do something extra special for your <br/>
favorite playground as a troop.  Maybe volunteer to paint a bench, or <br/>
clean up all the litter, or plant flowers or something.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they spend so much time cooped up in school that they NEED to <br/>
run.  Maybe take them to Mcdonalds and let them loose in the play <br/>
area for a meeting.  Or find a big field and bring some equipment <br/>
(frisbees, balls, badminton rackets) but no rules.  Just let them <br/>
run.  Maybe they could even handle a scavenger hunt, where they <br/>
divide into two groups, or draw names and go with a partner, and look <br/>
for a list of things you give them.  <br/>
<br/>
Another idea is the hobby badge.  In my brownie troop, I had a night <br/>
where everyone got a table to set up their special hobbies.  Someone <br/>
brought a coin collection, someone brought a beanie baby collection, <br/>
someone brought her drawings, etc.  They each got time to tell <br/>
everyone about their special hobby.  Since they love to talk about <br/>
their interests, they took a lot of time setting up their tables with <br/>
their collections.  <br/>
<br/>
We also did secret pals (which is for one of the badges).  At the <br/>
beginning of the year, everyone drew names but didn&#39;t tell whose name <br/>
they drew.  Throughout the year, they did something special for their <br/>
secret pal--a little gift on their birthday or Christmas, little <br/>
notes or cards, etc.  At the end of the year, everyone guessed who <br/>
had been giving them treats all year and gave their secret pal a <br/>
thank you present.  (We had a $5 limit).  That gives the girls a <br/>
chance to focus on someone who they might not normally focus on--<br/>
paying attention to when their birthday is, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I know a leader who handed her brownies a badge book and had them <br/>
each pick a badge.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;do whatever you want at the meetings&quot; <br/>
but &quot;choose whatever badge you want to do at the meetings&quot;.  That&#39;s <br/>
not a totally unschooling approach though.  <br/>
<br/>
Another idea is that as soon as they earn their first badge, give <br/>
them their badge right away instead of waiting until the end of the <br/>
year.  Kids that age sometimes don&#39;t really know what a badge is or <br/>
how cool it is to have one for the sash until they get their first <br/>
one.  Then they want more.  But I wouldn&#39;t use the badges as <br/>
manipulation like schools use grades.  Maybe they don&#39;t care about <br/>
badges.  That&#39;s cool too. Maybe they just want to have fun doing <br/>
stuff like run and play and make up their own games with their own <br/>
rules like they don&#39;t get to do all day in school.  <br/>
