<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977884920">IF YOU CANNOT AVOID STANDARDIZED TESTS...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
...then just invalidate the results. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Here is a short piece from the February 2000 issue of <br/>
Home Education Magazine&#39;s online newsletter . They unfairly called this <br/>
&quot;Sandra Dodd Cheats on Tests.&quot; I never did! I&#39;m simply and subversively <br/>
recommending that in the absence of the opportunity to avoid them altogether, <br/>
the second best option might be invalidating them. (The paragraph beneath <br/>
appeared in the newsletter too; I&#39;ve added links but not text to it.)<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOLING.COM <br/>
<br/>
On the topic of testing: I have a very serious suggestion which will seem <br/>
like a joke, but I&#39;m absolutely soberly recommending this: <br/>
<br/>
Cheat. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t cheat to get a better score or a worse score. Just invalidate the test <br/>
either by taking too long, or making a pattern with all the answer marks in <br/>
odd-numbered sections, or using dice to decide anything for which the answer <br/>
isn&#39;t absolutely obvious to the child. <br/>
<br/>
If the parent and child both know in advance that the scores could not <br/>
POSSIBLY actually begin to attempt to reflect the child&#39;s &quot;actual&quot; knowledge <br/>
or intelligence or aptitude or value, then that number will lose its juju and <br/>
its ability to harm the child-parent relationship. <br/>
<br/>
Of all the things I believe strongly, one which has changed my life as <br/>
profoundly as any one other belief is my personal knowledge that test scores <br/>
can and do (can&#39;t fail to) affect the treatment a child receives at his <br/>
parents&#39; hands. High scores, low scores, average scores--no matter. Parents <br/>
cease to treat the child as his original, known self and color him soul deep <br/>
with that number. <br/>
<br/>
My life would have been different. My husband&#39;s life would have been <br/>
different, without those 5th and 8th grade ITBS scores. I venture to say <br/>
without even knowing who is reading this that your life would have been <br/>
different, and specifically I believe your life would have been better, had <br/>
not you been branded with a number on your &quot;permanent record&quot; (there&#39;s a big <br/>
mean scary joke, the &quot;permanence&quot; and important parts) as a young innocent <br/>
ten or thirteen year old full of potential, at some unknown point on a <br/>
learning curve which might soon be at its settled-out point, or might just be <br/>
beginning. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This really hit home with me.  All through my grade school years, I <br/>
loved school.  I felt very smart, I caught on very quickly.  I could <br/>
see outside the box.  I got &quot;straight A&#39;s&quot;  Then jr. high happened, <br/>
and that was the end of my academic confidence.  From then on I <br/>
couldn&#39;t score well on anything.  I no longer felt special, just <br/>
dumb.  While my grades went up slightly in high school and I gained <br/>
some confidence through student government I knew I could never be <br/>
the lawyer I had dreamed about for so long.  No teacher ever treated <br/>
me like I knew anything.  I still caught on quickly and paid <br/>
attention to EVERYTHING going on around me.  I learned the material, <br/>
but that didn&#39;t matter, I couldn&#39;t score well on any test I took.  I <br/>
completely bombed the SATs.  No one ever encouraged me to go to <br/>
college anyway.  No one ever told me about going to community college <br/>
first and work my way to a four year school.  No one ever told me <br/>
about financial aid or student loans.  I was ignored, because of bad <br/>
test scores.  I thought college was only for smart rich kids, because <br/>
that is what I was told through being ignored.<br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt I would have become a lawyer and my life would be <br/>
very different if one teacher, one mentor, or even one of my parents <br/>
would have encouraged me to go for it anyway.  Bad test scores = no <br/>
college, that was the message I got.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t change my life now.  I&#39;m happy where I am.  I&#39;m happy I <br/>
have a business where I can be with my children.  I&#39;m happy I&#39;ve <br/>
learned all about unschooling.  I&#39;m happy that my children don&#39;t have <br/>
to go to public school and have all the confidence sucked out of <br/>
them.  I&#39;m happy they won&#39;t take a standardized test, if I can help <br/>
it.  But if they do I will surely have them &quot;cheat&quot;:)  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you Sandra, for sharing this with us.<br/>

Tammy, this is really, really sad.<br/>

It might not be too late to go to college.  I don&#39;t know your geography or <br/>
finances, but don&#39;t write it off forever and ever!<br/>

a Child Development Associate Credential.  To keep that credential <br/>
current I&#39;m required to take a college course in a specific time <br/>
frame.  I&#39;ve not ruled out a BA in something, LOL.  Don&#39;t really know <br/>
anymore.  A short time ago I thought about a teaching degree, but no <br/>
more.  I&#39;m almost 40 and time with my children is precious right <br/>
now.  <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to stand as an example of the correctness of your article.  <br/>
I&#39;m living proof of how damaging test scores are.  I had honestly <br/>
never thought about it until I read your words today.  I did not fail <br/>
the system the system failed me.  I actually feel freed by your words.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

As more colleges offer more kinds of Distance Learning on the internet,<br/>
you may be able to find something that meets your needs that you can do<br/>
from home at whatever time is convenient to you.<br/>
<br/>
(My husband is working on a teaching credential this year.  We are<br/>
certainly hoping that he will be able to do a lot of his continuing<br/>
education online in the future.)<br/>
<br/>
Rick went to traffic school online when he got a speeding ticket a<br/>
couple of years ago.  That was a lot more pleasant than spending a whole<br/>
Saturday locked up with a bunch of other scofflaws listening to the<br/>
world&#39;s longest lecture.<br/>
