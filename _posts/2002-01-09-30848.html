Hold that thought (&quot;maybe we&#39;ll open our doors to some wayward teens&quot;)!<br/>
There are sooooo many kids out there that need a loving home or even to know<br/>
that there is somewhere they can go if they simply need to &quot;get away&quot; for<br/>
awhile.<br/>
<br/>
The rewards are tremendous!<br/>

&gt; Hi Candy,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my book 4 is almost newborn! We have always had a family bed. I might<br/>
also add that they all breast fed until they were around 5.  My partner and<br/>
I were together for almost 9 years before we had any kids so sex where ever<br/>
and when ever wasn&#39;t an issue. Our kids are now 18, 12 and 7. The 18 year<br/>
old slept in our family bed or his bed with dad or little brother or little<br/>
brothers bed etc...until he was 13 or 14. He never sleeps with any of us<br/>
anymore :~( and we miss him.<br/>
&gt; We have a king size with a single on the side for the four of us who are<br/>
left. Our 12 year old is with us unless he stays out at a friends or has<br/>
friends sleep over. Our baby, who&#39;s 7 already, is still always with us. They<br/>
all have a bedroom complete with a bed and at times, if someone is sick,<br/>
can&#39;t sleep, or wants to have sex, we play musical beds and sleep where ever<br/>
we&#39;re most comfy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My oldest was extremely clingy and never slept out, except for at my moms,<br/>
until he was well into his teens. I admit I was worried and had many well<br/>
meaning people warning me, when he refused to attend sleep overs or even<br/>
large parties with friends, and we pushed him at times always with negative<br/>
results. Anyway, to make a long story short, he just got back from a 2 week<br/>
road trip to Key Largo with his old girl friend and we spent the time<br/>
cleaning and decorating his room to keep our loneliness at bay :~).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These years of family living have been the best years of my life and I&#39;m<br/>
not looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house. Soon I&#39;ll be looking<br/>
for a support group for people who didn&#39;t send their kids to their rooms or<br/>
to school and can&#39;t live with the peace and quiet. Or maybe we&#39;ll open our<br/>
doors to some wayward teens or become foster parents or something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy your little one and don&#39;t be afraid of being too close. These are<br/>
your years together, make the most of it, it will be over before ya know<br/>
it!!!! You can have sex anywhere but in bed, so what. Just hope your libido<br/>
doesn&#39;t disappear when she does:~)<br/>

&gt;   I am so glad I found this group!!! My husband and I agonize over this<br/>
very thing. Our daughter is 4 and an only child.  If she can&#39;t sleep with<br/>
us, she cries,  and after listening to sobbing for a while, it seems to<br/>
really put a damper on the mood. :o) We have tried doing a schedule of one<br/>
night in our bed, and one night in her&#39;s, but I have to admit that I am so<br/>
used to her sleeping with us, that if she does not wind up in our bed, I<br/>
can&#39;t sleep, I keep checking on her because it is so unusual!! I know it is<br/>
important not completely neglect your marriage, but I think my daughter&#39;s<br/>
need to sleep with us has actually gotten worse the last 6 months instead of<br/>
better.  I always thought as she got older, her need for independence would<br/>
increase, and she would enjoy her room. We have even tried completely<br/>
remodeling her room to make it what she likes. We got her involved in<br/>
choosing the theme, colors, furniture, ect. we got her a bed that looks like<br/>
a house, even went out and found a pink TV to match everything! She does<br/>
love her room, but not enough to sleep in it.We are somewhat at a loss of<br/>
what to do next! She really does not take naps very often any more, and it<br/>
just breaks my heart to tell her she can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on<br/>
what has worked? I just joined the group yesterday, so I may have missed<br/>
earlier discussions.<br/>

&gt;     &gt; I could really relate when you say you just can&#39;t relax.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know how<br/>
&gt;     &gt; much feedback you&#39;ll get on this one  :), but lately my normal<br/>
routine after<br/>
&gt;     &gt; &#39;the door is closed&#39;, no matter what time of day or night, is taking<br/>
a<br/>
&gt;     &gt; suspicious quick peek - under the bed and in the closet!  Talk about<br/>
&gt;     &gt; &#39;paranoia&#39;!  lol  The little critters are EVERYWHERE!!!  Though, I<br/>
can&#39;t say<br/>
&gt;     &gt; this has hindered us too, too much... we did manage to have SIX!<br/>
Haha!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Very cool. I guess bc I have just one child I would feel guilty<br/>
shutting<br/>
&gt;     my door to him at night. He wouldn&#39;t have any one else to bounce off<br/>
of<br/>
&gt;     and would feel, I&#39;m afraid, left out, y&#39;know? Not having siblings to<br/>
hang<br/>
&gt;     out w/when mom and dad are otherwise occupied and not letting him in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;     bedroom. He has his own bed and room but we have an &quot;open bed&quot; policy<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;     he often ends up in ours sometime during the course of the night. He&#39;s<br/>
&gt;     five.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     &gt; Ps- Also I enjoyed what you wrote on the TV thread about your<br/>
college friends<br/>
&gt;     &gt; - that was a pretty balanced remark...  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Thanks.<br/>
