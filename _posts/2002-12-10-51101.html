&lt;&lt;  I kinda wonder if he really was dyslexic or if <br/>
he just wasn&#39;t ready yet.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I vote &quot;just not ready.&quot;<br/>

Today Holly is 11 years and five weeks old, and started reading The Boxcar <br/>
Children.  This is her first more-text-than-pictures book.   <br/>
<br/>
Her writing/spelling are invented.   She wrote a letter to Santa because I <br/>
told her it would be useful to have a list.  She addressed it &quot;Dear Sandra&quot; <br/>
and crossed out Sandra and wrote Santa.  But here&#39;s what about the envelope:<br/>
<br/>
Her return address says <br/>
Holly Dodd<br/>
2905 N.e.           (she forgot the street name...)<br/>
87112 ABQ        (the &quot;7&quot; was backwards)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the &quot;to&quot; address is in the right place, and she used an old National <br/>
Wildlife Federation stamp as a postage stamp.   <br/>
<br/>
It says:  <br/>
Old Nick<br/>
123 Nothe Pull R.D.<br/>
NN<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So her address had &quot;NE&quot; but his was &quot;NN.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
Spelling isn&#39;t great.  The proper format for addressing an envelope she has <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
Geography and humor, pretty good!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was more worried with my #1 experimental model than I am with either of the <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Marty asked how to spell a couple of words earlier in the evening.  I don&#39;t <br/>
remember what they were, but they were the same level of difficulty as adults <br/>
ask about.   <br/>
