 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get lots of examples. Here are some from my family:<br/>
<br/>
1) 9 yr old son has a volunteer job on Tuesday mornings, taking care of<br/>
animals at an Ecology Center. Refers to it as his &quot;Job&quot; and takes it very<br/>
seriously.<br/>
<br/>
2) 13 yr old daughter takes Tae Kwon Do. We can only really afford one class<br/>
and I only want to do one driving trip. She uses all her allowance and walks<br/>
a mile to take an extra class.<br/>
<br/>
3) Whatever else is happening, they always know when it&#39;s 10:00 and the<br/>
Simpsons are on.<br/>

Ah, we picked this one up for free at the book depository. It&#39;s by Farley <br/>
Mowat, published in 1961.<br/>
Mine has &quot;discard&quot; stamped on it, but hey, it was FREE!! :)<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t Be&quot; and &quot;The Boat That Wouldn&#39;t Float&quot;. Very entertaining. He wrote <br/>
also the book titled &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; , very controversial, I think he made <br/>
it up, not really researched. Good read tho.<br/>
