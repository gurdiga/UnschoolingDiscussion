Homeschooled Girls are Invited to Submit Writing<br/>
<br/>
I am a 17 year old homeschooled girl and enrolled with Clonlara&#39;s home based<br/>
education program.  How would a book titled, You Are Not Alone: a book for<br/>
and by adolescent homeschooled girls, sound?  The title isn&#39;t definite yet.<br/>
I want to be able to help girls close to my age get through tough parts in<br/>
the homeschooling experience.  Girls born in 1980-1990 are welcome to submit<br/>
a story of their homeschooling experiences. I am looking for essays, poems,<br/>
song lyrics, art-work, and journal entries on the following topics*; family<br/>
relationships (grandparents too), homeschooling processes (ie: how you do<br/>
it, your goals in life, your dreams), transition process (ie: institution to<br/>
homeschooling), self images (physical and emotional), peers (ie: best<br/>
friends, guy friends, girl friends), mentors, personal Interests (art work,<br/>
songs, whatever!!!).<br/>
<br/>
*If these catagories don&#39;t offer what you need. Please do not feel<br/>
restricted with the above choices!  But your contribution has to be focused<br/>
around homeschooling/unschooling. Please spread the word to other<br/>
homeschooling girls.<br/>
<br/>
