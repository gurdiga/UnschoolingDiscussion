<div id="ygrps-yiv-295262054">We are new unschoolers and I have had my share of &quot;is this really going work&quot; thoughts since January.   So I thought I would share about a wonderful unschooling moment.   We have two daughters 8 & 11.   Our oldest is very into nature and stays most of her life outdoors exploring.  About two weeks ago I found her in a drainage ditch by my parents home.  (we are living with them until we finalize our home)  She was catching minnows.  The jar she started with seems a bit too small so her friend next door gave her a larger aquarium to use.  She set it up outside on the deck and began researching to find out what kind of minnow she had.  We got up to 40 some at one point.  She would spend hours (I am not exaggerating) sitting in front of this aquarium just observing them.  She realized a few of them were pregnant.  Then came Mother&#39;s Day.  Rachael went outside about 8 am only to find one of the minnows was giving birth!  And not to eggs but to live young.  This was absolutely the most incredible thing I had ever seen.  This went on for hours.  Our family who came for mother&#39;s day lunch got all excited and my cousins who are a bit younger than I am were taking pictures for school.  Rachael got upset when the other minnows starting eating the babies so she seperated the mom and babies.  The poor mother gave birth for 8 hours (somthing like 50 babies) and finally died.  Rachael pushed the last two babies out of her.  My dh and I were amazed at the knowledge Rachael was spouting out to us during all of this.   As I was taking pictures and having a grand time. I kept thinking to myself and occasionally said out loud for the benefit of those not understanding why we do what we do that this was not an event likely to happen in a classroom.  Since the birth of the babies Rachael stayed on her mission to discover what kind of fish would give birth the live young.  And alas!  She researched until she found that she had a misquito minnow.  <br/>
<br/>
My dh and I were watching our girls playing with their friends in the park last night when my dh looked at me and said....&quot;I really like our life&quot;.  &quot;Our girls are learning more because we are giving them the opportunity to be kids and explore the world without time frames or an assignment that takes the fun away and adds dread.&quot;  He also made the comment that growing up in the country he had never seen anything like what Rachael had discovered.  I think that goes back to the not having time to be kids and explore the world without limits and time frames.  <br/>
<br/>
Through this journey of unschooling, we both have made huge adjustments on how we parent.  It is making such a difference in our lives and I love it.  <br/>
<br/>
There have been days that I worry about our younger daughter because she tends to stay bored or not have the curiousity that our older dd has.  But what I have come to realize is our family has been through an awful lot in these past 6 months with moving and still not in our own home.  She has taken this transition harder than any of us.  She just needs time.  Moving into our own home soon will help too.  <br/>
<br/>
For those who are just starting out in this journey I want to tell you, it is worth it!  And for those of you who are seasoned unschoolers, you are my encouragement when I have the thought, &quot;is this really going to work?&quot; Thanks!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402006065">We&#39;re new unschoolers, too, and one of the things I like best about <br/>
it is how much I&#39;ve been re-examining my own views.  I recently read <br/>
John Taylor Gatto&#39;s UNDERGROUND HISTORY OF AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION, <br/>
and I found myself not only questioning the value of education as an <br/>
institution, but the whole of corporate America.  Anyhow, I&#39;ve <br/>
started to question everything a lot more, which is a good thing, and <br/>
I love the fact that my kids ask lots and lots of questions.  I&#39;ve <br/>
tried to explain to others who have expressed concerns over our <br/>
methods that blind obedience is not, and never has been, our goal.  <br/>
When my husband or I are being unreasonable, my older son (who is 6 <br/>
1/2) has no problem asking &quot;why,&quot; and often it is his fresh question <br/>
that will make me think, &quot;Now why am I asking him to do this?  Do I <br/>
have a reason or am I just issuing orders?&quot;  I try to treat them like <br/>
I&#39;d like to be treated, which is with courtesy and respect, and I <br/>
have to say, they respond very positively to this.  Anyhow, I love <br/>
your Mother&#39;s Day story, and I imagine you&#39;ll remember this one for a <br/>
long time.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; What an inspirational story for me as I begin the journey to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>freedom with my family.  What an awesome experience for your <br/>
daughter, and for all of you to be a part of.  I remember fondly the <br/>
times I spent outdoors in my youngest days -- fishing for leaves in a <br/>
ditch, playing in the hayloft, sitting in the middle of a raspberry <br/>
patch fort.  Now that was life!  Then I went to school...and those <br/>
times dwindled away.<br/>
<br/>
I want so much to live this way with my children.  I sent them out in <br/>
our fenced-in backyard the other day, only to have them return in <br/>
10min out of boredom.  This happens alot, even though they have a <br/>
wooden fort with a slide and swing, a kid&#39;s 4 wheeler, and a plastic <br/>
playhouse,as well as a myriad of other toys.  How I wish we could <br/>
take the fence down so they can just explore on our 9 acres!!  But as <br/>
quick as the thought comes, the safety issues enter my mind.  Our <br/>
house sits close to the road (what if they went up front without my <br/>
knowledge and something happened?) and there is a pond about 150ft <br/>
back from the house (what if they decided to fool around and <br/>
accidentally fell in before they can swim)?  They are 3 & 5yo.  Too <br/>
young to be trusted outside for long without supervision because of <br/>
these perceived threats?<br/>
<br/>
We are planning to move soon (bigger house) but if that does not <br/>
happen we have discussed filling in the pond so we can relax!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble.  I applaud your success and positive outlook <br/>
concerning your younger dd.  Time -- what we ALL need!<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely.  I don&#39;t think those are perceived threats, but real safety<br/>
concerns ... so why can&#39;t you be out with them exploring?  I can understand<br/>
having a fenced in play area, but if most of their time outside is spent<br/>
exploring your wonderful property with you then I would imagine the play<br/>
toys in the fenced in area may seem more exciting the odd time they are<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
We are right now looking at moving to a larger property, maybe 5-10 acres<br/>
with a pond or stream.  My kids are older (6, 10, 12) and can swim but I<br/>
plan to be out there with them a lot.  Not hovering over them, but hanging<br/>
with them and enjoying our exploration.  As well as working on the many<br/>
projects we have been coming up with!  The kids are fully involved in<br/>
viewing potential properties and discussing them as well as costs, logistics<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We are planning to move soon (bigger house) but if that does not happen<br/>
we have discussed filling in the pond so we can relax! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Really?  I think that would be one less wonderful opportunity for someone to<br/>
explore right in their own backyard.  Wouldn&#39;t another safe option be to<br/>
spend lots of time exploring your property with them?<br/>

<br/>
Yes, we do have many snuggling moments.  She is very much our emotional barometer.  I have been trying to be extra careful to stop and play cards when she asks me to or ride bikes.  This whole unschooling journey has caused me to slow down and be more &quot;present&quot;.  Life is simply too short and if we are not careful is will slip right by us.  <br/>

I am now thinking that phrase could be said for life in general.  I don&#39;t want to be another&#39;s robot of thoughts and feelings.  I want to be true to who I am and I feel like that only makes be a better parent, wife, sister, etc.   <br/>

Perhaps, but the pond poses other problems as well.  It is not easy <br/>
to maintain, and if let go they sometimes become an algae/critter <br/>
hole. Okay for getting a glimpse of a muskrat or water snake <br/>
occasionally, but not fully enjoyable/usable.  Given all the issues, <br/>
Our pond sits right smack in the middle of the property, which is <br/>
inconvienant.  We feel we would rather have the space to put a barn <br/>
or pavilion up.  We have great woods on the back of the property, but <br/>
because our land is very long and narrow, it is quite a walk to go <br/>
exploring.<br/>
