&quot;I better not ever see you doing X&quot; seems like a clear message to <br/>

Yes, I dooo agree. I&#39;ve caught myself many times saying that and I <br/>
would think &#39;that didn&#39;t come out right&#39;.... LOL. I know I do slip <br/>
though and have said it w/o thinking about it and correcting <br/>
myself.. ugh.. I have talked to the boys. Hmm... My youngest does <br/>
NOT care for her to keep them for a long time, but Laine, (middle <br/>
child) says he DOES care. So what to do now?? I don&#39;t know WHY it <br/>
was bothering me so much! Guess I wasn&#39;t looking at things from <br/>
different view points.. BUT. now, that I&#39;ve stupidly brought it up---<br/>
 I have to end it also. :) So.... For all you advice givers... GIVE <br/>
AWAY! LOL!!!  <br/>

  Or............. Should I just not mention it again? Hmmm.. Think I <br/>
could do that? But- if Laine DOES say something- what then??? :)</div>

Make some suggestions/do some practicing of things he could say to his<br/>
sister to make his feelings clear to her?? Do some delving to find out why<br/>
getting the toys is important to her? It seems like an odd situation anyway.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; getting the toys is important to her?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that would be a good thing to try to figure out.  Why does <br/>
she want their toys so badly?  <br/>
<br/>
Some thoughts to get your thinking going.  Could it be that she still <br/>
likes to play with &quot;younger&quot; toys and they have better &quot;little kid&quot; <br/>
toys than she does?  I know that while my daughter is getting older <br/>
and liking &quot;older kid&quot; stuff, she also has days when she sits and <br/>
plays with &quot;little kid&quot; stuff as though she were still 5. It&#39;s sweet <br/>
actually. :)  Maybe if you get to yard sales or thrift shops and let <br/>
her buy whatever she wants, she&#39;ll pick out some &quot;baby stuff&quot; of her <br/>
own. :)  <br/>
<br/>
Are most of your toys individual toys?  My kids have stuff that <br/>
belongs to them individually of course.  But a lot of our toys are <br/>
toys that belong to the whole family.  Matt got a t-wrecks hotwheel <br/>
set for Christmas and Luke got the ice mountain hothweels set, but <br/>
the general understanding with those types of gifts is that just <br/>
because Matt got to open the t-wrecks and Luke got to open the ice <br/>
mountain doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not really the whole family&#39;s <br/>
toys.  So anyone can play with anything anytime and they aren&#39;t kept <br/>
in bedrooms, they&#39;re kept in the playroom.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138032589">Why not sit down with all three kids together and talk about what the kids<br/>
are saying to each other, what they really mean, what their expectations are<br/>
about the toys?<br/>
<br/>
My 4 yo Michelle gives her toys away to her older sister Marsie who is 7.<br/>
But what she means is her sister can borrow them to play with, she doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean to keep.  Marsie comes in mad as a hornet because Michelle wants her<br/>
toy back.  So we talk with both girls, on going, about what exactly each one<br/>
means.  We still hit bumps about it but it is getting better.<br/>
