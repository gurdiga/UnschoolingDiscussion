We have 7 kids and uh....you all know where I am going with that one.<br/>
We have a van, but I don&#39;t see anyone handing me a a 9 & up passenger van <br/>
because they are complaining that I have a seat on the floor between 2 <br/>
captain chairs.<br/>
Anyhow, besides that Teyha are darling 1 year on will sit in a car seat for <br/>
5-10 minutes and ALL HELL will break loose!!!! <br/>
I will not let her cry (we are talking lake swelled tears here),hollar, & <br/>
scream for 5-20 minutes until I get where I am going so one of the older ones <br/>
will get her and put her in their laps and seat belt the both of them and she <br/>
is content as a peach.....<br/>
She hates being restrained and will raise ____ to the highest!!!!!! She has <br/>
to be free and she will fight tooth and nail to be free....<br/>
When it ain&#39;t right, you will hear about it......<br/>
The things is....she just turned 1 a month ago.<br/>
