<div id="ygrps-yiv-369309288">Nancy,  Did you see the Charlie Rose interview with Ron Howard last night?<br/>
They talked a lot about how he wanted to convey reality with Fellowship of <br/>
the Ring, because Tolkien invented it out of a need for English Myth.<br/>
With the Norman invasion of England, their mythology was erased...he felt <br/>
that other cultures had their mythology, but the English needed <br/>
theirs...hence, the realistic feel of Lord of the Rings.<br/>
It was written as though it was what happened many, many years ago....and <br/>
they wanted that feel in the movie. I thought he acheived that beautifully.<br/>
The scenery was so incredible, the cinematography astounding.<br/>
Not to mention all the costuming and props.<br/>
I guess they didn&#39;t rent any of the props from a warehouse, everything had to <br/>
be built especially for the movie.<br/>
They discussed details like what kind of silverware elves would eat with, and <br/>
then made it.<br/>
I hope it wins a bunch of awards!  Great interview anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Pat, I know the struggle you are going through. I&#39;ve been there to some <br/>
degree myself in the past.<br/>
One thing I did before I was totally unschooling, was create &quot;unit studies&quot;. <br/>
They weren&#39;t your traditional unit studies that most moms do in a homeschool <br/>
situation, because I didn&#39;t make them do paperwork type stuff.<br/>
The kids picked a topic and I would gather art, science and other fun <br/>
projects centered around that topic.<br/>
We all did them together and I would even make a snack that fit the topic. We <br/>
made cottage cheese &quot;turtles&quot; when we did the ocean theme.<br/>
It was fun, the kids didn&#39;t balk because it was all project, hands-on <br/>
oriented things.<br/>
If they got bored with something, they could walk away, or move on to <br/>
something else.<br/>
Our butterfly unit involved hatching butterflies and releasing them, visiting <br/>
a butterfly house etc...<br/>
I say school has drained you of  YOUR desire to learn.<br/>
Life is fascinating, there is a ton of cool things to see and do.<br/>
I realize that there are different levels of interest from person to <br/>
person....but if you have NO desire to learn about new things, that is <br/>
detrimental to unschooling.<br/>
I think once that desire is drained, it takes a long time to reignite that <br/>
flame of desire.<br/>
Don&#39;t give up.<br/>
Think about things you always felt intimidated to try in school...maybe <br/>
painting a picture, or photography? What excited you as a child? <br/>
Think about things that bring pleasure to you....watching enjoyable movies <br/>
has been mentioned. How about a water fight, painting with your feet or body <br/>
on large paper, building a terrarium, visiting pet stores, taking a tour of a <br/>
bakery and baking some bread at home...? The ideas can go on and on.<br/>
Life is HUGE, the world is cram packed with interesting people, places and <br/>
things.<br/>
If there is no desire to find out about some of this, then I say you&#39;ve been <br/>
hurt by school!!<br/>
I also love being home and puttering. Most days the simple things are just <br/>
what we need. But there needs to be some desire for knowledge, desire to find <br/>
out when questions arise.<br/>

&gt; Ren<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m one of those people who were &quot;damaged&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;ve had trouble being a &quot;role model&quot; for my kids when it comes to <br/>
delving into interesting topics(except for the topics of unschooling <br/>
and parenting).<br/>
I am still at the flitting stage.  I find myself a little bit more <br/>
and more interested in geography.  I&#39;ve touched on religions a bit.<br/>
played around with basic math(though I did get through college <br/>
algebra), I&#39;m learning a little bit more each spring about gardening <br/>
by trial and error and questions to friends.  I could go on and on <br/>
with little examples of me growing with the experience of <br/>
unschooling, but I am no where near what a lot of people seem to be <br/>
in their parenting and zeal for life and learning.<br/>
BUT(a big one too) My kids are not turning out like me.  We go to the <br/>
library quite often(my mother never took me to one).  We talk a lot <br/>
and really know each other(I didn&#39;t have that as a child either).  I <br/>
read to them and we have been through countless books together. <br/>
Redwall being the current one.  (Another thing I never got from my <br/>
mom).  I love my mom and think she was a very good one.  She just <br/>
didn&#39;t think our education was her job(thought she would interfere <br/>
with our schooling) and she didn&#39;t do anything to encourage us <br/>
outside of school(and not much in it either).<br/>
Aynway, my point is, that it&#39;s taking me YEARS to grow and rediscover <br/>
that wonder I had so long ago in my life.  My children don&#39;t have any <br/>
stuggles with this.  <br/>
Though I could be doing more, and am stuggling to do so, my kids are <br/>
curious and learning and living a free and happy life.  I am so happy <br/>
I can give them this freedom.  <br/>
I am so happy I can give myself this freedom!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joanna - this was just so NICE.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really think it takes that much to unschool - but one thing that is <br/>
really difficult for many of is is what you&#39;ve been able to do - let the kids <br/>
be different (and better) than we are ourselves. That is exhilirating and <br/>
kind of addicting - to see how the kids take off in different ways that we, <br/>
ourselves, never could. If we &quot;control&quot; too much of their education - we <br/>
never really get that joyful &quot;free and happy&quot; feeling that you expressed.<br/>
<br/>
It can be a fine line between &quot;offering&quot; a swirling, interesting, stimulating <br/>
life filled with possibilities and &quot;pushing&quot; nonstop learning opportunities <br/>
onto our kids. Not every unschooling house has to be filled with nonstop <br/>
activity and visitors and travel and so on. People can live great unschooling <br/>
lives that aren&#39;t as wild or exciting as some others. <br/>
<br/>
Now that my kids are older and have specific interests and activities that <br/>
they&#39;re involved with, I YEARN for the days when a slow rambly walk out in <br/>
nature, followed by a bubble bath and some read-aloud time, was plenty of <br/>
activity for the day. I try really really hard to KEEP long days with no <br/>
planned activities included in our weekly schedule. When I check my calendar, <br/>
to see if we can do something, I always have in my mind which days of the <br/>
week I&#39;m reserving to be just &#39;hang around&quot; days. On those days, Roxana will <br/>
often spend hours and hours in her room - reading and writing or singing or <br/>
just listening to music. Rosie will spend hours puttering around the house <br/>
(making little messes everywhere &lt;G&gt;) - &quot;just&quot; playing -- with dolls or <br/>
stuffed animals. I call those our &quot;benign neglect&quot; days - when I purposely <br/>
try to avoid interfering with them. I also try to really respect our weekly <br/>
park day time and let the kids have as LONG a day as possible without adult <br/>
interference. We usually get to the park about noon and leave around 5 or so <br/>
and even later as the days get longer. Those long hours seem important to me <br/>
for some reason - I don&#39;t like to go late and leave early - feels like <br/>
cutting off something. I know that, for years, the best park time has so <br/>
often been the last hour or two - after a few hours of play, the kids seem to <br/>
settle down into a calm intenseness that feels more deep and focused. I can&#39;t <br/>
really articulate what it is  -- but it feels to me like they are learning <br/>
something really worthwhile at those times. Maybe somebody else can express <br/>
this in words.<br/>
<br/>
Joanna, like you, I try to focus on what I am giving the kids - the freedom <br/>
and the support to be themselves and to really know themselves and to choose <br/>
the direction their lives take rather than feeling as if life is imposed on <br/>
them by outside forces.<br/>
<br/>
That is so much more important than learning about any specific subject <br/>
matter - if they grow up feeling &quot;in charge&quot; of their own lives -  all I can <br/>
say is WOW!!! <br/>

also has taken the joy out of life.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest reason I want to unschool my children is because I don&#39;t <br/>
want them to grow up feeling the way I do.  I think this is also the <br/>
reason there is so much emotion tied to all this.  I am frustrated <br/>
that I am having trouble giving them a life I think is so important.<br/>
<br/>
I met another homeschooling mom at soccer practice the other day.  <br/>
She was saying she prays for joy in her life all the time and yet she <br/>
has chosen to force her children to do all the work involved in a <br/>
classical education eventhough they don&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
I told her I am battling the problem of not having enough joy in my <br/>
life and I will not do that to my kids.  After all children aren&#39;t <br/>
born without joy, it is taken away from.  My kids will be allowed to <br/>
enjoy their lives even if it means they do not fit the model for <br/>
success.<br/>

There is a kind of rough thing said in AA meetings.  I think it applies here, <br/>
but try not to be offended by the crude nature of the saying.  It is this:<br/>
<br/>
You have one foot in the past and one foot in the future and you&#39;re pissing <br/>
all over today.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All this processing here is you worried about the future, and you wounded <br/>
about the past, and you afraid of whether you can do things.  What are your <br/>
kids doing RIGHT THIS SECOND as you&#39;re reading this?  What are you planning <br/>
to do in a half an hour?<br/>
