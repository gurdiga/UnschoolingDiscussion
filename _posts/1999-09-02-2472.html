<h4>Tea Lover Denise</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688224405">I babysit my 7-mo grandson and unschool our 16-yo daughter. I subscribe<br/>
to about seven lists, all but one in digest form.<br/>
<br/>
Digests are a lifesaver, IMHO. I read through them every morning with a<br/>
cup of tea (this is essential LOL). If I see a post which I would like<br/>
to read again/ponder, or one to which I want to respond, I drag them<br/>
into one of two folders I created: &quot;To Read&quot; or &quot;To Reply.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It works for me!<br/>
