If anyone else has something they&#39;d like to see printed in HEM please <br/>
feel free to send it along as well, but understand that I&#39;m just <br/>
collecting articles right now and nothing will be dealt with until <br/>
Kim clears up her backlog from this summer.<br/>
<br/>
We always love seeing articles from new writers - they often have a <br/>
fresh and different way of putting things. For a copy of our <br/>
editorial guidelines and rates of payment just send me a message with <br/>
the word &quot;guidelines&quot; in the subject line and my autoresponder will <br/>
return our guidelines automatically the next time I&#39;m online.<br/>

O&#39;Hara. I was wondering. I&#39;m sorry to hear she was having such personal <br/>
family difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
My self esteem is not nearly as fragile as I made it sound in my &lt;sniff, <br/>
sniff&gt; previous post. ;-) Actually, I have corresponded with Kim before and <br/>
she even accepted my very first article for the upcoming Nov/Dec issue. <br/>
::happy! happy! joy! joy! :o):: (Can you tell I&#39;m a new writer and a bit <br/>
excited?)<br/>
<br/>
Since my post yeterday I have already sent my Nintendo article off to Sandra <br/>
to include on her website. Being the speedy webmaster that she is, it&#39;s been <br/>
online for over 12 hours now! I think I&#39;ll leave it there since there seems <br/>
to be a buzz about Sandra, the conference and video gaming. So maybe the <br/>
article is best there and might get seen by a few people who are really <br/>
ready to hear what I am saying.<br/>

Playstation anymore or about the Teletubby game he bought Andrew (and I think <br/>
Zoboomafoo too.)<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve started thinking of unschooling I&#39;ve been able to relax a lot more <br/>
about things like TV and videos and video games...I&#39;ve always thought of them <br/>
as great time wasters...but as this article shows...for a child those things <br/>
can be a springboard for so much more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-793597319">Thanks Mary for the article,  I&#39;m going to use it to try and inform my mother about how video/computer games can be beneficial to a developing mind. Funny how as adults we can spend hours on the computer(like my mother does) but if our children do its &quot;omg.. there is something weird about him!&quot;  Trying to open up some minds in my family.  Thanks all.  Kelli<br/>
