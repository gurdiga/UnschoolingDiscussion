She interviewed me for a LONG, long time, and said she&#39;d tell me when  <br/>
the article came out.  I just came across a reference to it on the  <br/>
blog of someone I don&#39;t know, looking for something else. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an okay article.  As usual, someone deeply ignorant of  <br/>
unschooling was quoted in opposition of it.  It seems inevitable.<br/>
Maybe only only the ignorant are opposed.<br/>

<br/>
Why do colleges even *have* remedial math courses?  They have them for the many students who come out of K-12 without the math skills considered necessary to succeed in college - not for the few unschoolers with idiosyncratic skills.<br/>

in this way:  I&#39;m kinda making up the numbers for the illustration  <br/>
because I&#39;m not positive of them, or maybe I did guess them right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
97<br/>
98<br/>
99<br/>
100<br/>
121   121 was the lowest college-credit math class.<br/>
<br/>
The other four were four levels of remediation.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby, with nary a math lesson, tested into the 99.<br/>
NOT the first two, which filled up with high school graduates or high  <br/>
school dropouts.  By the time one is allowed to drop out, he should  <br/>
have had fifteen years of math instruction, 55 minutes a day, 180  <br/>
days a year.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had zero, but had learned his math from games, puzzles, using  <br/>
money in real ways (like calculating tips and his 30% discount at the  <br/>
gaming shop), working, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He finished second in that class, and had the highest final test score.<br/>
