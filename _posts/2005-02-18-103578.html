We could probably put it onto the book discussion schedule over at Always<br/>
Unschooled later in the year. We pretty casually do one book a month.<br/>

**I guess I&#39;ll jump in here &lt;G&gt;.  Hi, I&#39;m Rue :0) (that&#39;s my first name - my<br/>
last name&#39;s Kream).  I have two daughters, Dagny, who&#39;s 12, and Rowan, who&#39;s<br/>
8.  This is my first book, and it is called Parenting A Free Child: An<br/>
Unschooled Life.  It is being published by Unbounded Publications<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ubpub.com/)">http://www.ubpub.com/)</a>.  I&#39;m not sure when it will be out.   ~Rue<br/>
