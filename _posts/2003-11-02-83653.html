<div id="ygrps-yiv-498100829">I just saw in the newspaper today that Whale Rider has been released on<br/>
DVD. This movie got great play here in the Hawaiian Islands, for obvious<br/>
reasons. But, everyone everywhere ought to see it. Poignant, moving,<br/>
beautiful. Without a doubt, one of my most favorite films EVER.<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>
