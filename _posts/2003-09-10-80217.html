<div id="ygrps-yiv-567165618">Here&#39;s what Frank Smith (spoke at the Sac HS conference 2002) says about reading in &#39;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&#39;:<br/>
&quot;Learners must see themselves as members of the clubs of readers and writers.....Where there is print in the home, the evidence is that children know what it is for, and they participate in making use of it, learning from the company they keep.&quot;<br/>
He talks about how all children consider themselves members of some kind of literacy club, but often learn there that they are not members of the club when  they arrive at school.<br/>
Hope I put that in a way that makes sense; it seemed to me to relate to several things you guys were saying about reading. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This wasn&#39;t my personal experience, however I agree with you.  The very<br/>
first words I spoke to my 1st grade teacher when my mother introduced me<br/>
were not &quot;hello&quot; or even a shy &quot;hi&quot;, but &quot;I&#39;m never going to learn to<br/>
read.&quot;  And I came from a very literate family, with books everywhere and<br/>
people reading them.  My 2nd grade year was hell; we were required to read<br/>
out loud.  Evidentially I was sick with really bad strep-throat all year.<br/>
My Mom couldn&#39;t figure out why it kept coming back!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s really important to feel like a member of the club, though.<br/>
Clearly I didn&#39;t - even without the &quot;help&quot; of school, however school really<br/>
cemented my opinion about reading.  I didn&#39;t become free from this handicap<br/>
until I was 35.  I really always wanted to enjoy reading, and I&#39;m so<br/>
grateful that it finally happened for me.<br/>
<br/>
Tia&#39;s suggestion about pointing out that a kid really *is* a member of the<br/>
club, and that there are no outrageous requirements to get in (or stay in)<br/>
has been so helpful for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
