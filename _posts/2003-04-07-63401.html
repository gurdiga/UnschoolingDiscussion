<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599594175"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; THIS is the kind of thing we can talk about. See, you don&#39;t have to be<br/>
&gt; some &quot;perfect&quot; unschooler to talk about substantive stuff here - this<br/>
&gt; issue of kids having big dreams, but apparently not &quot;getting it&quot; that<br/>
&gt; there are things they have to do to fulfill those dreams - this is<br/>
&gt; something that lots of unschooling parents have to figure out how to<br/>
&gt; handle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good topic for us to chew on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to see lots about this one.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
