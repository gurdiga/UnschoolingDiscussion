<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866375006">-=-...  She started copying word for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; word out of the book.  ...<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really curious why a person would want to do that.  Any ideas?  It&#39;s<br/>

&gt; interested in castles.-=-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember being in about third or fourth grade --just learning cursive--and<br/>
copying word for word from &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web&quot;.   I did it because I liked<br/>
practicing my handwriting--and I loved &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web&quot;!!!<br/>
