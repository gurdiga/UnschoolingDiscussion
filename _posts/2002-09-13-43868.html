<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920866716">I have a gifted daughter, who is 8 years old.  She has always been <br/>
homeschooled, but up until March, we&#39;d been doing &quot;school at home&quot; <br/>
and battling on a daily basis.  I found &quot;unschooling&quot; - and it makes <br/>
PERFECT sense to me/us.  We love it.  (We don&#39;t understand why <br/>
EVERYONE doesn&#39;t do it!!!)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is still close with her &quot;school at home&quot; friends.  She <br/>
has been asking to do her old Math U See workbooks, and asked me to <br/>
buy her Language Arts workbooks.  I was happy to oblige.  She wants <br/>
to be sure her school-age peers don&#39;t &quot;get ahead&quot; of her.  She&#39;s <br/>
always been ahead of them, and doesn&#39;t want to fall behind, or feel <br/>
less intelligent.  She wants to learn Algebra, like her older <br/>
cousin.  <br/>
<br/>
What should I do about this?  In one way, I&#39;m happy to see that she <br/>
is motivated, but am concerned that she is so focused on what others <br/>
are doing.  She LOVES unschooling and doesn&#39;t want to go back <br/>
to &quot;school at home&quot;.   She wants to be a hairdresser when she grows <br/>
up, so Algebra isn&#39;t out of necessity, for her future profession.  I <br/>
figured she&#39;s learn things like Algebra when she NEEDED it (IF she <br/>
needed it), but didn&#39;t expect this!<br/>
<br/>
Any words of wisdom would be appreciated. <br/>

whatever reason, I would help her by providing materials for that and maybe <br/>
even an algebra book, possibly teachers edition so she could learn it on her <br/>
own. Make it known to her that she doesn&#39;t have to follow through with it <br/>
all if she decides she doesn&#39;t want to learn it after all. She may surprise <br/>
you again by learning it all quite well whether she thinks she&#39;ll need it or <br/>
not. As long as it&#39;s what she wants to do, what harm could there be?<br/>

Get her a book on algebra, or maybe just do a google-search on algebra. <br/>
Perhaps you can find some worksheets for it that would at least get her <br/>
started, and be able to see if it&#39;s something she really, *really* wants to <br/>
do. Just a thought.<br/>

<br/>
3 + X = 6 - solve for X. That&#39;s algebra, I remember writing up some<br/>
problems like that for Rain a few years ago.<br/>

is algebra. We all play it and think its great fun but how is it <br/>
algebra?<br/>

<br/>
If she ends up running a whole chain of salons, the algebra could come<br/>
in handy.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll leave the decision up to you whether you want to buy her schooly materials.<br/>
<br/>
Key Curriculum Press makes some nice math materials, that are available<br/>
at some teacher supply stores.  They sell a series of pamplet books<br/>
called Key to Algebra and each part is sold separately.  That would give<br/>
you the opportunity to just buy the first part and let her have it and<br/>
not care much whether she used it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821519147">When I was into doing school at home or when I go<br/>
through the stages of am I doing enough my kids pull<br/>
out this math series that an unschooler told me about<br/>
called Key Curriculum Press.  They have a good series<br/>
on Algebra.  It shows how Algebra is used on an<br/>
everyday basis and kids can work at their own pace. <br/>
They come with an answer key that I just gave to my<br/>
son if he wanted to check it himself.  He hasn&#39;t done<br/>
it for awhile but if he wishes it it is there.  I used<br/>
this because I am inedpt in math and have a mental<br/>
block beyond division and really wouldn&#39;t know how to<br/>
present it any other way except in a book.<br/>
