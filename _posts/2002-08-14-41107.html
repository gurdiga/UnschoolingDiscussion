&gt;&gt;&gt; This pre-unschooling time so far is full of doubts.  How come my<br/>
&gt; 10 <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; year old can&#39;t find any thing to interest him? He&#39;s still waiting<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for me to tell him what to study<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I would just tell him that he doesn&#39;t have to study anything<br/>
&gt;&gt; anymore.  Tell him all he has to do is play.<br/>

&gt; Sheila,<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the encouragement.  This goes against everything I was<br/>
&gt; ever taught. I think it is a matter of me deschooling more than my<br/>
&gt; son.<br/>

Wow !  Did ya&#39; see that lightning strike ?<br/>
<br/>
Tina describes the way many parents feel. The idea is that if a kid isn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;studying&quot; something, time is being wasted, and the kid&#39;s future is in<br/>
jeopardy. That&#39;s fear tactics.  Sheila&#39;s advice (&quot;don&#39;t bug him about not<br/>
&#39;studying&#39; something&quot; ) agrees with a great deal of evidence on child<br/>
development that says kids don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to study stuff, they need to freely<br/>
investigate their surroundings on their own terms -- that&#39;s called play, and<br/>
it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;organized sports&quot; (necessarily).<br/>
<br/>
What happened (above) was that Tina recognized that it was she herself who<br/>
needed to unlearn the false assumptions that &quot;educators&quot; want us all to<br/>
believe -- that we NEED their services and that they know how to raise our<br/>
kids better than we do.<br/>
<br/>
Let me add to Sheila&#39;s elegant post:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had two sets of kids. One set (twins, b&g, went to a variety of<br/>
schools, mostly the public, and came out stressed badly and not knowing much<br/>
at all -- even fearful of learning. The other, a boy ten years younger,<br/>
never set foot in a school (except Montessori briefly when he was 4 and<br/>
dropped out on his own - he quit at 4 ! - and also took a night class in<br/>
converstational French when he was 12. A French woman spoke French and in<br/>
eight sessions he learned to speak that language better than I had learned,<br/>
taking French for six years every day in a &quot;good&quot; private school) and<br/>
learned everything in sight -- without a moment of stress or unhappiness or<br/>
coercion or anyone telling him what to think or do or -- least of all --<br/>
study. <br/>
<br/>
The transition from being required to study things that don&#39;t interest a<br/>
person to becoming interested/curious in something by one&#39;s self is<br/>
delicate. School makes learning compulsory, and therefore onerous. . . it is<br/>
on other people&#39;s terms and there will be tests, so you don&#39;t even know<br/>
which information is important and which is not. That creates stress, and<br/>
changes learning from an enjoyable experience into a threatening one. It<br/>
takes kids a while to see that learning can be enjoyable experience, once it<br/>
has become a &quot;duty&quot; done for gold stars or other people smiles.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t need incentives to learn about things that interest them. But<br/>
schools give &quot;rewards&quot; and soon kids only learn for the &quot;rewards&quot; instead of<br/>
the joy and satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
Advice: Give the boy things like maps, real tools -- such as tape measures,<br/>
microscope, magnifying glass, binoculars, a sewing machine, paint, have a<br/>
junk yard bring a wrecked car and put it in your yard. etc. Those are toys<br/>
for people who do real things. He will play with them. (don&#39;t tell him what<br/>
to do with them, though, just make them available, visible) He just needs<br/>
access to the real world, he&#39;s 10. Life is long.<br/>

I can&#39;t claim to be an unschooler, but I can identify with this. My 12 year <br/>
old boy recently bought the video &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; -- a silly take-off of <br/>
Caddyshack (you may not even know what the heck that is -- but they&#39;re both <br/>
golfing movies). Anyway, he asked if we could go golfing sometime. I&#39;m not a <br/>
golfer, but I said yes, and we went to a driving range and rented a couple <br/>
clubs and had at it. It was such a joy to do something with my son wherein I <br/>
didn&#39;t know any more than he did. I don&#39;t mean to imply that I know more than <br/>
him in everything else, but only that here was something of general interest <br/>
that we both were ignorant of. We just mimicked the guys we&#39;ve seen on TV, <br/>
and those around us, and hacked away for an hour. He did really well, and <br/>
picked up some pointers from a guy next to us who was creaming the balls <br/>
while looking as if he was barely trying.<br/>
<br/>
It will be awesome to see where this goes, and to learn it together, and <br/>
hopefully it will help me to take a back seat to him in other areas as well.<br/>

I agree that foreign language learning/forgetting is a great<br/>
illustration of how pointless it is to &quot;teach&quot; someone something before<br/>
they have a desire or need to learn it.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes use it to whap people over the head when they are being<br/>
unsupportive of unschooling.  &quot;Did you take a foreign language in high<br/>
school?&quot;  &quot;Can you say anything besides Hello?&quot;<br/>
