&lt;&lt; Or you could spend some time talking to how ever many people it takes to <br/>
explain &quot;unschooling&quot; a term they may not have heard of before. . .  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do that all the time.<br/>
If I can&#39;t do it one more time to help an always-unschooled child into <br/>
college, maybe I should&#39;ve just sent him to school.<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t need to explain a term.  You need to describe how the children <br/>
learned.  <br/>
<br/>
There have been links to info on books on creating transcripts listed here <br/>
already, and there are samples of how to describe unschooling QUITE honestly <br/>
