&lt;&lt; Perhaps she should seek out the &quot;Get a sense of Humor&quot; or the &quot;Get a Life&quot; <br/>
lists. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have both a big busy life and a good sense of humor.  What I just don&#39;t <br/>
have is tolerance for a barrage of negativity based on sky-is-falling <br/>
falsehoods.  Partial truth isn&#39;t truth.  Mostly truth isn&#39;t truth.   A <br/>
pitcher of lemonade with even a little turd in it is...  not &quot;mostly <br/>
lemonade.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Last night I was moving files from my old computer to a new one and came to <br/>
&quot;the unschooling barrage,&quot; which was a set of about a dozen e-mails people <br/>
used to request to read to find out about unschooling.  For years and years <br/>
the best sources of information were infrequent magazines, newsgroups and <br/>
just a couple of online bulletin boards.  The internet wasn&#39;t very useful <br/>
yet, and to read an article you had to download it slowly onto your computer. <br/>
 Everything seemed dusty, and it was slow.<br/>
<br/>
The information in that barrage was pretty valuable and it convinced people <br/>
that unschooling could work.<br/>
<br/>
Today, though, anyone with internet access can get that much information in <br/>
an hour, with color pictures, and can bookmark the pages to get back to <br/>
later.  Those with questions can go to www.unschooling.com and have answers <br/>
in minutes or hours.  State law and policies and associations can be found in <br/>
moments.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all good for beginners.  But there is a depth to unschooling which <br/>
isn&#39;t downloadable or bookmarkable.  Those who unschool for a couple of years <br/>
don&#39;t need it.  Those who do it for life come to hurdles and slumps and <br/>
problems and they can use  the help of others who have experienced those <br/>
fears and situations.  I&#39;ve been involved in online homeschooling discussions <br/>
since Kirby was five.   He&#39;s sixteen now, and two other children are <br/>
following behind him who haven&#39;t been to school and haven&#39;t been &quot;schooled.&quot;  <br/>
There are other people online, in various discussion groups, whose kids had <br/>
no school, or a little, or lots of damaging school, and they&#39;re volunteering <br/>
time and effort to help others unschool peacefully.  <br/>
<br/>
I have never been on political discussion lists.  Some are very political.  <br/>
Some are specifically about homeschooling laws and policies and watchdog <br/>
groups about HSLDA situations, and on and on.  That&#39;s not my interest.<br/>
<br/>
www.unschooling.com isn&#39;t a political forum.  It&#39;s about how unschooling can <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
This discussion list is associated with www.unschooling.com and I&#39;ve been <br/>
involved with that forum since it began.  I&#39;m not the list owner, but the <br/>
list owner has asked twice for it not to turn into school-bashing.  I&#39;m not <br/>
the moderator, but moderator is trying to avoid the negativity which will <br/>
keep this from being a haven for unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
So why pick on me?<br/>
