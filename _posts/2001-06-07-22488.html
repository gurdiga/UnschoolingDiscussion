<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742896986">What state are you in?  My advice is to know the law, be prepared to follow<br/>
it and don&#39;t give the state (or any other official) any more than the law<br/>
requires.  I would also insist that any official &#39;requesting&#39; info<br/>
demonstrate a legal right to the information.<br/>
<br/>
But then, I&#39;m something of a rebel.  You&#39;ll have to decide what level of<br/>
risk you&#39;re comfortable with.  I won&#39;t go out on a limb far enough to<br/>
clearly put at risk the removal from my home of my child, for instance...but<br/>
would consider civil disobedience if I felt it would help make a necessary<br/>
point without harming my child.<br/>
<br/>
Sure am curious about the friend telling you to expect to be turned in...is<br/>
she going to turn in the report personally or wait for someone else to<br/>
complain?<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi, I am planning on homeschooling my 10 yr special needs son<br/>
&gt; this fall. He needs some routine and structure, but not the sit at<br/>
&gt; his desk and do worksheets all day. I do want some though. I would<br/>
&gt; like to work moree in areas he enjoys to keep his interest. If any<br/>
&gt; one has any favorite sites you would like to share I would sure<br/>
&gt; appreciate it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I have been told by a friend, (cps worker) that I should count<br/>
&gt; on being turned in since he is special needs. She said she would<br/>
&gt; be the one sent and just keep good records. My question is has any<br/>
&gt; one been turned into CPS for homeschooling? and what kind of records<br/>
&gt; should I keep. There are no specifics here that I have been told<br/>
&gt; or read, just have to have 180 days of school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877443198">I am in Indiana. No she won&#39;t be turning in a report personally.<br/>
Apparently she has had to go out on complaints from school<br/>
personell when special needs kids get pulled for home schooling.<br/>
She is a nice gal. Said she would be the one sent and she<br/>
would be here late in the pm so will have dinner as there won&#39;t<br/>
be anything else to do as she knows me. We have guardianship of<br/>
Erik so have to be careful anyway in this area. We have to report<br/>
to the court every year as to his progress in all areas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707613619">Slightly OT, I guess &lt;g&gt;  We love that movie!!!  Could be because Auntie<br/>
owns a house right around the corner and it was kinda like watching a movie<br/>
made in your own house and yard.<br/>
