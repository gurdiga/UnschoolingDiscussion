<div id="ygrps-yiv-895767294"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;     Thinking back to my childhood and now w/ my relationship w/ my mother. <br/>
&gt;I now see she doesn&#39;t have confidence in me and this is probably a huge <br/>
&gt;piece <br/>
&gt;to the puzzle. Thank you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nicki, I have the same issue (almost) with my decisions about my son. And <br/>
its only in the past few years has my mom said any kind of comment about <br/>
my choices. I mean ANY. She was a &#39;hands-off&#39; mother and sometimes, as a <br/>
teen or a young adult, I wish I had input that could of helped me. She <br/>
offered none.<br/>
<br/>
And after reading posts from Tia and Dar, I realize its not that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have confidence in me, its because she doesn&#39;t have confidence in <br/>
HERSELF! Confidence to know that she gave me the modeling and grounding <br/>
that was necessary for me to make informed and intelligent choices.<br/>
<br/>
Its her issue, not yours. Do yourself a favour and keep reminding <br/>
yourself. Its not easy. <br/>
<br/>
Parents are the ones that should tread the lightest, because their words <br/>
cut the hardest.<br/>
<br/>
warm regards,<br/>

ps. I&#39;m sure your doing great with your children, from your posts you <br/>
sure sound like it!</div>
