<div id="ygrps-yiv-631245553">And we had unlimited access to television/other electronic entertainment <br/>
(excluding violent or overly sexual stuff), until, for one of our children,<br/>
our 10-year-old son, it became so seductive of his time, that he was missing<br/>
out on too much else.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
He was missing out on &quot;too much else&quot; of what? Things he wanted to do (in<br/>
which case, he would have done them) or things you wanted him to do? If he<br/>
had been reading the exact same number of hours he was watching TV, would<br/>
you have been as concerned? What if he was reading &quot;junk&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
The cornerstone of unschooling is trust that our children will make good<br/>
choices for themselves in learning. Once I decided to trust my children to<br/>
learn what they needed, it wasn&#39;t hard for me to see that I could also trust<br/>
them to eat what they needed and to do what they needed, even if it was what<br/>
some would label &quot;junk&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A Johnny Bravo cartoon led my 8 year old and I into a prolonged discussion<br/>
of Shakespeare not too many weeks ago. She came to me and asked, &quot;Who is<br/>
ShakesBeard?&quot; (this being how Johnny pronounced it on TV). I explained<br/>
briefly, she was interested as she likes plays, and it took off from there<br/>
and isn&#39;t done yet.<br/>
<br/>
This is not an isolated incident. TV is not &quot;junk&quot; to us -- in fact, I have<br/>
to admit I find the terms &quot;junk&quot; food and &quot;junk&quot; TV to be elitist crappola,<br/>
if I can be blunt. Everything around us, including a cartoon on TV, is a<br/>
potential gateway to fascinating new worlds.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
My point is this: electronic forms of entertainment are so fun and<br/>
addictive, to all of us-- here I sit writing on an email loop, rather than<br/>
playing with my kids (I did take a break from writing to go outside and<br/>
break off an icicle for my son to eat :-) ) – that my explanations to my<br/>
children of how important it is to move your body, cannot match the draw of<br/>
these electronic marvels.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of fun things in the world. I am much more interested in my<br/>
children&#39;s choosing happily what to do with their time than I am explaining<br/>
to them how important it is for them to move their bodies. The result: they<br/>
move their bodies without my explanations, when they need to and want to.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
I think limits, as controlling an action as it is, might actually be<br/>
advisable, if only for a short time, to point out the “other side” of the<br/>
picture, not only to the kids, but to ourselves.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not real clear on what you&#39;re getting at. You think that those of us<br/>
living happily with freedom should all set limits on TV so we can see &quot;the<br/>
other side&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
No thanks.<br/>

physics law, how does it go, a body at rest stays at rest.  Once he <br/>
got started he was glad to be doing more active stuff.  If you were <br/>
to ask him, &quot;in retrospect, would you rather have stayed home and <br/>
watched television or are you glad you came skiing&quot;, a question I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t ask, as it would obviously be sarcastic, I&#39;m sure you can <br/>
guess his answer.  It&#39;s hard to get started on something, but once <br/>
you do, you are usually glad you did.  Without the unlimited presence <br/>
of television, it has been just enough of a lack of opportunity to be <br/>
passively entertained, that he has found other ways to spend his time <br/>
enjoyably, and, I would add, much more enjoyably.  I&#39;m sure he would <br/>
say the same.<br/>

it has been challenging to my mind, but I&#39;m in NEED of sleep, and <br/>
here I am seduced away from what I believe is truly best for me.   <br/>
And who will suffer -- not only me, because I will be grumpy and <br/>
irritable tomorrow, but also my family, who will have to deal with my <br/>
sleep-deprived irritability and lack of enthusiasm for the healthier <br/>
activities in life - enjoying my time with my husband & kids. <br/>

Well I&#39;m not exactly sure what to say about the whole tv thing. I can&#39;t <br/>
argue with what you say has happened. I just know my kids have always and <br/>
are still known to get up right in the middle of a tv program and just walk <br/>
away and find other things to do. I just never heard of a child with real <br/>
unlimited opportunites becoming a zombie because of it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as you doing the same thing if he was reading a book. I think that&#39;s <br/>
sad. As one who remembers being so immersed in Dirty Harry that I brought it <br/>
to the dinner table and read between bites, without my parents saying <br/>
anything but laughing as to how much I was enjoying the book, I would hate <br/>
to think how I would have felt if they thought it was junk reading and made <br/>
me stop to go outside and play.<br/>

<br/>
What kind of reading do you consider to be &quot;junk&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It&#39;s a nice by-product <br/>
<br/>
of the game, but it doesn&#39;t make the game valuable when played <br/>
<br/>
excessively to the exclusion of other pysical & social interactions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many times when parents try to declare the value of their children&#39;s <br/>
interests, the parents are wrong.  &quot;Excessive&quot; is hard to define.  If you <br/>
make him stop while he&#39;s still having fun, he will feel deprived.  If you let <br/>
HIM stop when he wants to, he will stop.  <br/>
<br/>
Yu-gi-oh is social interactions.  If he prefers it in any one instance to <br/>
another social interaction, it seems he&#39;s be the best judge of that.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest, Kirby (16), is the one who runs the Yu-gi-oh tournaments at Active <br/>
Imagination, where he works.  Every Monday night.  One family comes from <br/>
nearly fifty miles away.  Another family had to move to Iceland.  They had <br/>
really liked Kirby, and they exchanged gifts the last week before the <br/>
departure.  One dad takes his son who usually lives with his mom.  That&#39;s one <br/>
of the only things they get to do together.  Much of the value is not <br/>
directly related to the cards!<br/>
<br/>
Kirby goes with Holly to another gaming shop a time or two a week to play <br/>
Harry Potter cards.  This is the coolest thing Holly and Kirby have ever <br/>
shared.  It doesn&#39;t involve their brother Marty, and doesn&#39;t involve me or <br/>
their dad.  It&#39;s a gaming situation that&#39;s not at Kirby&#39;s reglar <br/>
hang-out/place of work.  Holly&#39;s really proud to have her cool brother go.  <br/>
Kirby is proud that Holly&#39;s big in the middle of that group (it&#39;s mostly <br/>
homeschoolers), and she&#39;s getting better at the game.   There couldn&#39;t be <br/>
very much that I could come up with that would be more important than that to <br/>
them.  <br/>

go of controls, or if they find something new, they&#39;re going to be<br/>

But if a child isn&#39;t happy doing what he&#39;s doing, I&#39;d tackle that and talk<br/>
to him about it. Rather than identifying the TV as the problem for him and<br/>
imposing a limit, I&#39;d talk about what he wants and how he can get there.<br/>

Learning how to recognize problems and find solutions is a whole lot more<br/>
powerful and useful life skill than having someone else diagnose your<br/>

self-regulate. Of how they DON&#39;T become fat, lazy zombies. We can write until <br/>
our fingers bleed.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t BELIEVE it&#39;s possible with your children. If you can&#39;t CONCEIVE <br/>
of any other way for them to be. If you can&#39;t TRUST in them---forever, NOT <br/>
six weeks or five months or some other arbitrary time, then...you&#39;re RIGHT. <br/>
Your son WILL be happier with limits on the TV, video games, Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, <br/>
and books---and he&#39;ll be delighted and compliant doing other things YOU find <br/>
more important.<br/>
<br/>
But please don&#39;t call yourselves UNschoolers, because what unschooling is all <br/>
about is---TRUSTING the CHILDREN!<br/>
<br/>
YOU pulled yourself away from the computer last night---of your own volition, <br/>
because YOU knew you might be crabby the next morning if you didn&#39;t get off <br/>
and get some sleep. What if I had come in and TOLD you (right in the middle <br/>
of it all) that you&#39;d been on long enough. Go to bed. Or that, while you&#39;re <br/>
on today responding to THIS post, you need to be washing MY dishes and <br/>
mopping my floor---or skiing ot flyfishing---no matter how important this <br/>
e-mail is to you RIGHT NOW?<br/>
<br/>
We have ALL grown up to self-regulate. Every one of us. NOT because someone <br/>
beat it into us as children (although that&#39;s how most of us were raised), but <br/>
because we&#39;ve had time enough away from people who DO require us to do <br/>
certain things at their whims. Parents! Who of us wasn&#39;t told, &quot;When YOU&#39;RE <br/>
paying the rent, you can stay up all night and eat what you want, but while <br/>
you&#39;re under MY roof....&quot; Even if YOU didn&#39;t hear it from your parents, <br/>
you&#39;ve heard it on TV shows and from other families. It permeates our <br/>
culture.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re saying that the CHILDREN can learn to self-regulate EARLIER than WE <br/>
did. Don&#39;t you remember friends at college who had been so regulated at home <br/>
that they went WILD???<br/>
<br/>
Trust the children. THAT&#39;s UNschooling. <br/>

<br/>
If we make a blanket statement that kids will self-regulate if TV is<br/>
unlimited, and parents take that to mean they shouldn&#39;t listen to what their<br/>
kids are saying in their behavior, then the advice becomes rule based and<br/>
not awareness based.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a mistake to zero in on what the child is doing as the problem.<br/>
The problem lies in *why* the child is not happy. If a child is freely<br/>
choosing (of whatever) and isn&#39;t happy, then the problem is helping them<br/>
help themselves be happy.<br/>
<br/>
If he wanted to go skiing and felt he couldn&#39;t leave the TV, then perhaps<br/>
the problem is he didn&#39;t feel he had control of what he could watch when.<br/>
(As in he was at the mercy of the times the TV stations chose to show<br/>
things, which perhaps seemed random to him. And often *does* seem that way<br/>
with cable. They shift programs around way more often than broadcast<br/>
channels do.) The answer could be recording his favorite shows so he could<br/>
watch them when *he* wanted to.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello Joyce -- Yes, we had thought of this possibility, and over a <br/>
year ago we invested in TiVo ( wonderful electronic invention, by the <br/>
way).  It has helped, but it has also harmed.  Now all his favorite <br/>
programs are recorded, so he can walk away and be assured that he <br/>
won&#39;t miss something, but now he has almost 30 hours of television <br/>
recorded (shows he has chosen for TiVo to save) and we have enabled a <br/>
system which createds even more opportunity to watch television, <br/>
because there is always something on that he likes.  Electronic <br/>
devices - good & bad.  Overall, though, I would say good.  It has <br/>
allowed him to choose skiing over television. As for the reason he is <br/>
unhappy when he gets away from the television, I believe it has to do <br/>
with the way he settles into a passive, one-dimensional mode, and <br/>
then coming back to action and multi-tasking takes some time, and the <br/>
transition time is the most miserable time.  Once he has been away <br/>
from the television for a while, his happier & friendlier personality <br/>
shines! In peace -- Lynda</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452070162">I was very unfocused, unorganized and a procrastinator all through my school<br/>
life and I was far from *unschooled*.  I was fairly controlled academically.<br/>
<br/>
Hated school was the problem...most likely because I had undiagnosed LD and<br/>
ADD (wasn&#39;t seen as a girl problem then).  <br/>
<br/>
I still can&#39;t focus, and my son still complains I have the worst attention<br/>
span... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not certain that anything fits together as neatly as we would like.<br/>
Their are children who were controlled so tightly throughout their lives<br/>
that as soon as they could get away with something they screwed their lives<br/>
up royally. Other&#39;s remain *good scouts* all their lives.  Or learn to<br/>
appear as if they were good scouts.<br/>
<br/>
I think too often we deem a certain method of childrearing will lead to a<br/>
certain outcome, and I&#39;m not certain it is true. A lot of it depends on<br/>
seeing the child and what the child needs, rather than toeing a certain line<br/>

Lynda,<br/>
Welcome to the list and I hope you find useful information here.   I have<br/>
posted the intro to this list  for you to read.    The focus of this list<br/>
is unschooling and trusting children.    I don&#39;t get a sense from your<br/>
post that this is your goal.    Perhaps you didn&#39;t read long before<br/>
posting and maybe it would help you to do that to see the purpose of the<br/>
list. <br/>
Deb L<br/>
<br/>
~~~Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn<br/>
what they need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling<br/>
parent is a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning<br/>
with curiosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the<br/>
what, when, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to<br/>
Shakespeare to Spongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or<br/>
you&#39;d like to find out more about how video games and life in general are<br/>
filled with learning, come join us! <br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling<br/>
is *not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest<br/>
in unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you<br/>
keep in mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in<br/>
ways designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>
unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>
debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations.~~~~<br/>

hard time doing it on their own. And yes, they generally dropped out or <br/>
struggled pathetically through until a friend or professor showed them the <br/>
ropes. But the unregulation at home was NOT the problem. These were kids <br/>
whose parents ran their lives, so they had NO practice making decisions. Kids <br/>
who start at a young age have no probelm making decisions and setting goals <br/>
as young adults. It&#39;s the kids who are  told who, what, when, where, and how <br/>
much that struggle.<br/>

I personally see a 15 year old and a six year old consistantly making better <br/>
and better choices---because they CAN.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It depends.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing much good can come of questioning the values of deeply respecting<br/>
and trusting children that are discussed on the list. The discussion would<br/>
be over whose values are &quot;better&quot; rather on how well those values work in<br/>
reaching a goal of respecting and trusting children.<br/>
<br/>
Just as unschooling is accepted as a given here, so is trusting and<br/>
respecting children. Trusting and respecting children isn&#39;t up for<br/>
discussion any more than unschooling is. What would the purpose be?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, questioning what people are basing their beliefs and<br/>
practices on is useful. It&#39;s very helpful to examine why we believe what we<br/>
beleive.<br/>
<br/>
But if those beliefs don&#39;t match yours, then the list won&#39;t be as useful as<br/>
it will be to those whose values are reflected here. Just as a carnivore<br/>
won&#39;t find much use in a vegetarian list unless they share some of the same<br/>
goals. But where the carnivore&#39;s goals differ or clash, they should keep<br/>
those to themselves.<br/>

transfer our points over into his bank account (which is up to 140 NP <br/>
interest per day), and trying to break 1000 on Destruct-o-Match.<br/>
<br/>
What I was also doing was thinking about what I need to do and have to speak <br/>
in Saskatoon in a couple of weeks.  I can do pattern games and also think in <br/>
words.  I can&#39;t do word-stuff (reading and writing) and also plan <br/>
word-related stuff.  So I was doing pattern games so that I was awake enough <br/>
to think and so I could let my mind wander over the &quot;assigned territory.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
But without Keith here to remind me to go to sleep, without Marty here to <br/>
want me to get off the computer, I just went and went, and didn&#39;t go to sleep <br/>
until 5:00 a.m.  <br/>
<br/>
Another factor was I&#39;m not sleeping in my own bed this weekend, but staying <br/>
up in the front of the (rambly big) house, with Holly.  I hate to go back in <br/>
the back and leave Holly all alone in the front without her intimidating big <br/>
brothers around.  So I slept in Marty&#39;s bed.  At 5:00 a.m. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954583617">I think you&#39;d be doing a huge service to him to help HIM understand <br/>
this aspect of his nature - and begin now to work out how he&#39;s going to <br/>
live with it as he grows up.<br/>
<br/>
My 18 yo has always been like this too - transitions are always the <br/>
unbalanced icky difficult squirrely times for her.  It was true at 5 <br/>
years old and it is still true at 18. The difference is that she knows <br/>
it and she has her ways of coping with it and settling herself and <br/>
dealing with it. She had to experience it herself to learn that, though <br/>
-- along with lots of talk and suggestions and support from us, of <br/>
course. The kind of self-awareness she has now, is gained over time and <br/>
with experience. It is one reason I encourage parents NOT to set strict <br/>
tv times - for those kids who do have problems with tv (and they do <br/>
exist), I don&#39;t see parents taking control over from the kid as the <br/>
best way to help the kid learn how to handle it themselves. And I think <br/>
them learning to handle it is more important than the fact that they <br/>
get grumpy and difficult along that path.<br/>

early. You were logged on when I was up @ 6:30---MY time! &lt;G&gt; Go get some <br/>
SLEEP! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
