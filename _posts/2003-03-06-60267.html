sentences.  <br/>
<br/>
All that black is harder to read, so I often skip it.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing<br/>
out on some good stuff, though.  White space helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True thanks for the reminder :)<br/>
Did some research lately trying to help my husband build his<br/>
business and with letters asking for some ones business brief<br/>
information is easier for the attention span. There is only so much<br/>
the eye can take in {at least the way most of us were taught to<br/>
read} I think speed reading is a whole another technique.<br/>
<br/>
If you {like i do sometimes ~ sorry} tend to go on and on without<br/>
breaks people get board. <br/>
I tend to get frustrated having to re find my place {or going back<br/>
to try to understand what the author meant} again and again in a<br/>
long non-spaced email.<br/>
<br/>
Also I find if I read and reread my letter before i send I can catch<br/>
those things that might offend {which is never my intent}. Since<br/>
most of our body language tells a person how we feel, email can be<br/>
misleading to what the person is trying to say. This is the main<br/>
thing I keep in mind when reading an email, especially if I tend to<br/>
disagree with their views. Overlooking this {or when someone is just<br/>
plain trying to start something ~ LOL} is how I feel most &quot;list<br/>
wars&quot; are started.<br/>
I looked up on google for links, some might go a bit off topic but<br/>
hope they help :)<br/>
