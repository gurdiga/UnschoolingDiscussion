<div id="ygrps-yiv-481243918">Sooooo.....what did Raymond say?  I&#39;ve been on tenterhooks all afternoon!  I was out last night with several homeschooling mom friends, having an adult dinner party, watching &quot;Babette&#39;s Feast&quot;, and discussing God, parenting, learning and sex, so I missed the episode.  (Didn&#39;t someone say he had some &quot;unschooling thoughts&quot;?)   Debi<br/>
