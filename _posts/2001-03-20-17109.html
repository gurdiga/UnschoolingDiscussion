<br>Nope.
<br>
<br>Sounds like you&#39;re muddling along just like we are. &nbsp;Good for you.
<br>
<br>We have a 6 yo girl and a 7 yo boy. &nbsp;Isn&#39;t it great to have the luxury of

<br>(Can you tell I have no clue???) &nbsp;
<br>
<br>He seemed very relieved when I joked to him: &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s OK. &nbsp;You&#39;re still young.&quot;
<br>
<br>And this morning he wanted to know what the word &quot;obsession&quot; meant. &nbsp;His 
<br>little sister explained it to him and used Pokemon as her example. &nbsp;He sure 
<br>got it with that explanation!
<br>
<br>Well, done rambling. &nbsp;Probably some nice people will come on here and offer 
<br>some wonderful book titles and official advice. &nbsp;You really should read them 
<br>all too. &nbsp;Or not. &nbsp;Spring is here!
<br>
<br>Welcome and have fun!

<br/>
Don&#39;t know about success stories, (apart from dd1 (5yo) <br/>
deciding she wants to learn to read and making a pretty <br/>
good job of it, for a first week, anyhow!) but the <br/>
first thing I&#39;d say is &#39;deschool!!!&#39;  Everyone needs <br/>
time to come to terms with a change in lifestyle, and <br/>
the change from institutionalsied schooling to <br/>
unschooling (that is, autonomous learning, rather than <br/>
&#39;school-at-home&#39; or unit studies, both parent-led forms <br/>
of home-ed) is a biggie.  Getting rid of the ideas that <br/>
one cannot choose what to do and when, that one must <br/>
follow the herd or open oneself to ridicule or worse <br/>
(does anyone else like the song, &#39;Teenage Dirtbag&#39; or <br/>
is it just me?? LOL  Love the video!!) that one must <br/>
learn what someone else tells us is valuable and the <br/>
things we are interested in are valuable in themselves, <br/>
not because some teacher says so...  can you see that <br/>
this is going to take a lot of adjustment?  <br/>
<br/>
Giving your children the time and space to make these <br/>
adjustments will be a great gift for them.  Be there <br/>
with them, support them in what they do and don&#39;t want <br/>
to do.  Oh, and give yourself the time too!  Unless you <br/>
were unschooled, you were in that system a lot longer <br/>
than they have been!  <br/>
<br/>
HTH a bit...<br/>
Tracy<br/>
PS  There are loads of books around, but since I <br/>
haven&#39;t read many, I&#39;ll let other folk tell you about <br/>
them :-)</div>

<div><font face="Pooh" size="4">Best bet...because she was in school so long is to 
provide SOME sort of homeschooling like a workbook or a unit study. My daughter 
is in 4th, 10 years old and out of ps for 6 weeks. She chose to pick up a 5th 
grade math book, a science book and also using lots of books from the library. I 
get thematic unit studies each week from <a rel="nofollow"

blessing. This weeks study is on horses. Last weeks was St. Patricks Day and 
they use Acrobat reader for the pdf files that they send to you via email. 
Biggest emphasis you can make is lots of reading, lots of outdoor play, plant 
some spring plants or herbs now to plant outside later. Do lots of crafts

<br/>
It&#39;s uplifting when kids get old enough to find out there will ALWAYS be <br/>
things that they know and understand that their moms don&#39;t, and that they can <br/>
learn things from all over the place, not just from their parents.  Pokemon <br/>
is a pretty great quick step to that.  It&#39;s a very complex &quot;world&quot; they can <br/>
learn from other kids, from websites, and books (there&#39;s a $10 Pokemon guide <br/>
that&#39;s well worth the money even if kids can&#39;t read yet).<br/>
<br/>
Once they get that they can learn about Pokemon, other things will seem (and <br/>
likely BE) less daunting and complex.<br/>

<br/>
I say &quot;They don&#39;t _go_ to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s older brother likes me a lot, but he doesn&#39;t really get <br/>
unschooling.  He used to say to the kids &quot;Do you like your teacher?&quot; and they <br/>
would look at him, waiting for an explanation, and say &quot;We don&#39;t HAVE a <br/>
teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sure you do!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stuff like that.  Just trying to make conversation, but it was awkward, and <br/>
irritating for the kids.  If I was there I would (again) say &quot;It&#39;s not like <br/>
that, it&#39;s like a string of good Saturdays.  It&#39;s not like teaching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think their uncle&#39;s finally getting there, and Kirby&#39;s 14. &lt;g&gt;  But he has <br/>
boys about that age, two of them, and they&#39;re BIG into competitive, <br/>
homework-laden school in South Carolina, so this living in the dirt in <br/>
Albuquerque and NOT having homework seems (probably) like so much sloth and <br/>
sin to him, at the core.<br/>
<br/>
But because he likes me he tries to understand.<br/>

<br>It is neat when the kids teach me things -- something they notice and point

&gt;people. They are interesting, very social and get along with everyone.<br/>
&gt;Adults like them, kids like them, we like them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ditto, what she said.  I think unschooling (and possibly relaxed<br/>
homeschooling) is a good method for raising really nice children.  I just<br/>
spent a sunny afternoon at the park with our homeschooling group, and I&#39;m<br/>
really feeling happy and confident about how fabulous the kids are.  (Yes,<br/>
sometimes there is minor squabbling, but I&#39;m not looking for perfection.)<br/>
<br/>
I was even looking at these kids and thinking that these open-ended days at<br/>
the park are so satisfying that some of the kids will grow up and be noted<br/>
humanitarians.  My logic seems to be that they are getting really filled up<br/>
with satisfying experiences and some day this will overflow onto others<br/>
around them.<br/>
<br/>
Flip side -- I don&#39;t think being sent to a (hypothetical) school that has a<br/>
lot of playground bullying is any kind of way to get kids to love their<br/>
fellow man.<br/>

 Sorry so long...anyone out there have a success story to a great kid <br/>
 like this ?   Any suggestions ? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My dd enjoys going to classes and when she gets what she wants out of<br/>
it she then quits.  I am the same way.  I think this is a great time to try<br/>
out things, go different places, take a class here or there if they are<br/>
interested.  I wouldn&#39;t enroll my kids in anything to expensive that I felt<br/>
I had to get my money out of.  In fact my dd joined a hs show choir<br/>
which costs a bit up front for shirt and first month class.  After the first<br/>
month I askedher if she still enjoyed it that if she didn&#39;t I woulnd&#39;t pay for<br/>
next month (or buy the cool jazz shoes and pants).  She said she <br/>
still wanted to continue, so we are.  I value free play time and encourage<br/>
it much in my kids.  Yesterday they didn&#39;t want to go to park day but<br/>
stay home and play in their tent. I think my kids are really neat little<br/>
people. They are interesting, very social and get along with everyone.<br/>
Adults like them, kids like them, we like them.  Kick back, relax, and<br/>
when you get paranoid go on a field trip (and read essays and message<br/>
boards at unschooling.com!!!!)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t know -- I guess having the tent up in the living room today isn&#39;t <br/>
 all <br/>
  that ambitious looking but . &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love this. Two years ago my youngest then 8 decided to make a room of his <br/>
own downstairs in a large corner by the woodburner. ( he shares a room <br/>
upstairs normally)<br/>
He put up blankets to section it off from the rest of the room and then <br/>
hauled his mattress downstairs. He hung his favorite drawings on his walls <br/>
and brought in a little shelf for his favorite things. And for a winter this <br/>
was his &quot;room&quot;. He often played it snf always slept in it and sometimes a <br/>
sibling would sleep with him! It probably made my house look messy to company <br/>
but we do not get many visitors because we are so far  from town and I am not <br/>
very picky anyway. After that winter Coyote was back upstairs and the tent <br/>
was gone. I had kind of forgotten about his tent room till this post was on <br/>
the list. Life really is a lot of fun isn&#39;t it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983303796">Hey hey hello! Nice to meet you and all that jazz. :)<br/>
I understand the mild opposition thing, cuz even my<br/>
family that is all for &quot;homeschooling&quot; has a hard time<br/>
with this whole unschooling thing, even though I was<br/>
unschooled for most of my life, just not officially or<br/>
knowingly. They want to see the kids DOING something<br/>
for &quot;schoolwork&quot; or soemthing.  I&#39;d like to think of<br/>
myself as a fairly intelligent/successful person and I<br/>
left ps in the middle of 3rd grade and went to a very<br/>
small private school (where my mom was my teacher for<br/>
5th grade) until the end of 5th. from then we bought a<br/>
curiculum (which wasn&#39;t used...except the cool paper<br/>
they sent. and the pencils.&lt;g&gt;)and another one for<br/>
high school (which wasn&#39;t used. I&#39;m just not that kind<br/>
of gal. I guess I never was.) While I can&#39;t say that I<br/>
am what SOME people would consider a &quot;success story&quot; I<br/>
would like to share that I was alot like you say your<br/>
daughter is and I would get fired up about something<br/>
but it would be shortlived, and I would be interested<br/>
in something else before I was done with the first<br/>
interest. (Some might think it&#39;s due to being<br/>
Gemini.)Dolphins I was always interested in. Never<br/>
failed, but rarely finished a project related to them.<br/>
It was the projects, though, not the subject, that I<br/>
lost interest in. But as an adult, I feel am a<br/>
&quot;success&quot;, in that I am totally free to be myself, to<br/>
learn what I want..( I think I&#39;m still unschooling<br/>
myself, actually)..when I want (provided the kids are<br/>
compliant)...and my older sister who GRADUATED from ps<br/>
asks me when she can&#39;t figure out something that they<br/>
average observer would think &quot;oh, she didn&#39;t go to<br/>
school, she won&#39;t know that.&quot;  I was bored off and on<br/>
alot...but my mom was super creative and would just<br/>
tell us (me and 2yrs younger sis) things to PLAY, and<br/>
I think we learned alot in that proccess. Also my<br/>
parents tried to do the classes thing for me<br/>
too...well, I wanted it too, sometimes, and I would<br/>
go...I can&#39;t even tell you how many &quot;introductory<br/>
classes&quot; I went to and decided never to go back. They<br/>
were nice enough people, but the whole idea of it<br/>
being a &quot;class&quot; I think just made me almost nausious<br/>
from anxiety. My sis on the other hand took the same<br/>
gymnastics thing I did and stuck with it and did<br/>
recitals at the mall, etc. While I was free to sit and<br/>
observe. I think that part about it being ok for me to<br/>
not be interested in those things was truly good for<br/>
me. My mom was always concerned (cuz she a mom and<br/>
that&#39;s what moms do)but she also knew she couldn&#39;t<br/>
MAKE me do anything I didn&#39;t want to with a clean<br/>
conscience. My point about it being good for me is<br/>
that now and thru my teen years, from all that sitting<br/>
and observing other people mostly,with the occasional<br/>
participation on my part, was actually TEACHING me. I<br/>
was very interested in psychology when I was 15 and<br/>
since I had the tremendous love of reading (the MOST<br/>
important thing to teach a child, IMO, cuz with that<br/>
they can learn anything) I studied and read alot on<br/>
the subject. It enabled me to see into other people<br/>
better and empathetically feel what they might be<br/>
feeling. As a result of that I am a pretty good<br/>
listener, and more to the &quot;success&quot; point - writer. My<br/>
friends and family have been trying to get me to<br/>
finish a novel since I was 16, and to tell the truth,<br/>
I&#39;ve read some of the stuff people BUY out there and I<br/>
probably could do really well, if I wanted to pursue<br/>
it. I think the things about me that I count as a<br/>
success are things that directly resulted from me<br/>
being a wishy washy many interests frequently bored<br/>
sort of kid who was &quot;taught&quot; at home and allowed<br/>
freedom to do what I felt, even if other people looked<br/>
down upon that. A feeling of loving protection flowing<br/>
from my parents was what I felt when I knew or heard<br/>
them getting a hard time about me and defending me and<br/>
their parenting. le sigh. Your dd will be<br/>
fine...probably better than fine, even....who knows<br/>
what kind of a HUGE success she&#39;ll be when she&#39;s older<br/>
and say &quot;Thanks mom, for having faith in me.&quot;<br/>
MAYBE her success will be that she will unschool her<br/>
own kids and know what they&#39;re going through and be<br/>
able to defend them and her mothering/teaching skills<br/>
well, having seen you do it yourself in her younger<br/>
years. <br/>

on your emails is 1940. Therefore your posts go to the bottom of my list.<br/>
Some people might miss what you have to say unless it is the fault of my<br/>
own computer. Just thought you might like to check it out.<br/>

Thanks, Carol!  I&#39;m using a really obscure mail program (Cyberdog) and this<br/>
is it&#39;s Y2K bug.  (For real!)  I promised I would switch to a better<br/>
program once I got my house on the market, and I&#39;m still procrastinating. <br/>
Better do it this weekend.<br/>
