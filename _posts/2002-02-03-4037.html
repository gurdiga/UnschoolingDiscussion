<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484829606">Okay, I know I rambled in my last post, but there were a few things I <br/>
thought of that my kids have really enjoyed at various times.  So, in no <br/>
particular order they also like the invisible man model, rock tumbler, <br/>
totally gross chemistry kit, magic sets, crystal growing kits, prisms, wires <br/>
and circuitry stuff, and coin collecting books.<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking that, of course, it&#39;s more than just having stuff around <br/>
for the kids and exploring with them. We also have our own stuff and stuff <br/>
going on that they are free to explore with us. Stuff like tie-dying, candle <br/>
making, writing, deck building, gardening, sewing, costuming, embroidery, <br/>
landscaping, and I suppose e-mailing. ;-) Our home is filled with art that <br/>
we love, by famous, not so famous, tribal and local artists. We also travel <br/>
as much as we can afford. We share as much or as little as we each want.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I&#39;m really done now. It was actually a good exercise for me to see how <br/>
much we have going on around here. Different from other posters, but totally <br/>
ours. Is that authentic?<br/>

<br/>
It depends whether you told us to educate us, or told us because you just <br/>
wanted to, and whether you thought we should learn what you do on our own at <br/>
our own pace or whether you were willing to tell people, and if so, did <br/>
someone directly ask or did you make an assumption, and you anticipated their <br/>
potential need?<br/>
<br/>
Or did you just kind of intuitively mix all that together and make your own <br/>
independent decision?<br/>
<br/>
If someone here rejects &quot;totally gross chemistry&quot; because of your <br/>
recommendation (reactionary) are they thinking for themselves?  If they go <br/>
buy it because your family uses it, are they thinking for themselves?<br/>

<br/>

too much fun, apparently. I just kept rambling on beyond all reasonable <br/>
expectations. &lt;g&gt; It started as just an answer, but then I got on a roll <br/>
there and ended up just having fun thinking about it all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Or did you just kind of intuitively mix all that together and make your <br/>

 </span></blockquote>K. I&#39;ll go with that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If someone here rejects &quot;totally gross chemistry&quot; because of your<br/>

<br/>
Why not? Perhaps they&#39;ve tried my recommendations before and found that our <br/>
tastes/styles/interests really do not agree. Therefore they&#39;ve learned not <br/>
to take my suggestions. Trial and error? Considered opinion? Judgment call?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If they go buy it because your family uses it, are they thinking for <br/>
&gt;&gt;themselves?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so. If out of that ridiculously long list they chose that one thing <br/>
to get, there was a lot of thinking going on. Look at how many things they <br/>
didn&#39;t choose to buy, while finding that one thing that seemed interesting. <br/>
(BTW, that Totally Gross Chemistry Kit is on clearance at Barnes & Noble. <br/>
Just a couple of bucks. You mix household items to make virtual snot and <br/>
stuff. Very educational. ;-))<br/>

I had fun reading it.  I liked the rolling &quot;we have that; we don&#39;t have that; <br/>

<br/>
It interests me when people want to copy physical plant instead of concept.  <br/>
I know some people are more literal than others, and I think it helps to see <br/>
the range of what various other homeschooling families do. <br/>
<br/>
Those who recreate school (schoolroom, chalkboard, flag, desks, bulletin <br/>
board) have it easiest.  Others are still trying to find a model.  For some a <br/>
house full of games and toys isn&#39;t appealing.  My husband and I already <br/>
collected games and had various toys (science and history clutter) before we <br/>
decided or happened upon having kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I was thinking in making my list so long. I wanted to show that <br/>
the list of cool stuff can go on forever. I was probably unconsciously <br/>
trying to make sure it wasn&#39;t very schooly/educational sounding stuff. I <br/>
didn&#39;t want anyone to think they had to have a science kit, for instance. <br/>
That&#39;s probably why the stuff on my 2nd list didn&#39;t occur to me initially. I <br/>
thought it sounded very &quot;let&#39;s learn science&quot;. Then I thought, wait!, my <br/>
kids LOVE those things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear what other folks have found kinda cool.<br/>

idea that I could have what *I* wanted in my house, made it easier to <br/>
understand that I should give my kids the same consideration. I could <br/>
probably do with a few less Barbies or action figures, though. &lt;g&gt; The kids <br/>
would obviously disagree.<br/>

dabble with a lot of it and go back to their old favorites more often.  But, <br/>
how will they know which things or activities pique their interest if they <br/>
don&#39;t have exposure to lots of different experiences? I find renewed <br/>
interest in previously ingnored stuff when I strew it about from time to <br/>
time too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;I&#39;m concerned that I am not setting a good example for my kids regarding <br/>

or appreciate the cost of it or the time to maintain it and space to store <br/>

<br/>
If they were in school, would you begrudge them a classroom full of supplies <br/>
and cool stuff? Would it bother you that they didn&#39;t consider what the lab <br/>
equipment cost or the fundraising needed to build that new gym or where the <br/>
teacher was going to store the classroom games? You don&#39;t have to have all <br/>
or any of the stuff on my list. You can get what *does* interest your kids <br/>
(and you!).<br/>
<br/>
I find lots of stuff on clearance, at flea markets, homeschool swaps and <br/>
garage sales. When the kids are done with something, we either give it away, <br/>
swap it, or sell it at our own garage sale. (Another experience in and of <br/>
itself!)<br/>
<br/>
I know my kids appreciate what they have. They appreciate the stuff, but <br/>
more than that they appreciate the richness of their lives in terms of love <br/>
and involvement. They know that not all kids live this way.<br/>
<br/>
We spend many hours in volunteer activities and raise  money for causes we <br/>
believe in. Much of it is completely initiated by my kids. There&#39;s lots of <br/>
examples to set in addition to frugality.<br/>

as I don&#39;t think you should feel guilty for getting stuff (if it&#39;s within <br/>
the budget), I also don&#39;t want anyone to feel like they&#39;re short changing <br/>
their kids somehow because their idea of stuff is different than mine. And <br/>
really, try those garage sales!<br/>

one day. Look around, see what catches your family&#39;s interest. It might take <br/>
you all in a completely different direction than you&#39;re thinking right now. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. Maybe you could slow down a little, too, and just start perusing the <br/>
stuff you already have. Take out things and put together seemingly <br/>
incompatable items. Sandra&#39;s one-time example was playdough and legos, I <br/>
think. Take something outside that you usually use indoors. Borrow a wildly <br/>
different CD from the library and play it while you&#39;re seeing how many <br/>
bubbles within bubbles you can blow with a straw and some liquid soap. Scour <br/>
the internet for cheap and easy crafts and science projects. (We had so much <br/>
fun with alka seltzer rockets one day.) Explore. Think. Do. Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re doing lots of this already, BTW. I&#39;m just hoping I didn&#39;t <br/>
throw you into a need for stuff because of my silly list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t *need* or *want* anything right now but I&#39;m hoping to have things when they are ready.  Like one day after watching a show about Egypt featuring an archeologyst removing debri from a tomb, they went down in our basement as if they were in a tomb and hid clay figures in cat litter.  It was in a storage area of the basement that is lined on both sides with wide metal storage shelves.  It gives the feel of a tunnel when you are in the center aile.  It would have been perfect *if* I had had rolls of brown craft paper.  They could have covered the shelves with brown paper and drawn heiroglyphs on it.  It would have been soooooo cool.  But I didn&#39;t have the brown paper.  I got the paper a few days later and told them what they could use it for but they had moved on to something else.  So I want to be there with fun stuff when they get inspired.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know but I want this great place where we can do cool stuff.  I want to give my kids the life in my dreams.<br/>
<br/>
And I really should try those sales but I hate to go shopping.  We have one car and I get it 1 or 2 days a week to grocery shop and run special errands.  To me shopping is like going to a museum, I&#39;m only good for 2 hours.  That is why we got a museum membership - 2 hours or I lose interest.  I love shopping on-line.  Ebay is about my speed for sales.  We got a huge box of K&#39;nex for $80.00.  My dd hasn&#39;t had to take about any of her models since we got it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I know my kids appreciate the life they have.  They talk about that a lot. <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Isn&#39;t that just a wonderful discussion to have?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I almost started to cry the first time my 12 yo dd told me how much she loved me for homeschooling her and how she knew other kid&#39;s moms would never do that for them.<br/>

Just like the &quot;moving a puddle&quot; article (my favorite of all things I&#39;ve <br/>
written), you can tell someone about having moved a puddle, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean they  should go and find a puddle to move.  It means be aware that <br/>
something that seems small or worthless might be really wonderful and <br/>
far-reaching.  So if you look at someone&#39;s list as a checklist, or if you go <br/>
looking for a specific thing, you might miss the wonderful, rare and <br/>
exclusive item or opportunity that was presenting itself to you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But, beware,  you might wind up with tons of stuff that they&#39;ll never take <br/>
an interest in. It&#39;s really hard to predict the fabulous twists and turns we <br/>
all take on our way to discovery. It won&#39;t follow a straight line, and it <br/>
won&#39;t look like school. And part of life is about going out and finding your <br/>
own stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Like one day after watching a show about Egypt featuring an archeologyst <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL! This sounds great! I&#39;m just going to assume it was litter straight out <br/>
of the bag and not taken from the litter box. :-P Did you join them on their <br/>
dig?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It was in a storage area of the basement that is lined on both sides with <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds perfect just the way it was. How imaginative and creative and fun! <br/>
You adding the idea of heiroglyphics may have interested them or it may not <br/>
have. Even if you had that stuff right at the moment. They got out of the <br/>
activity what they wanted and needed and had fun doing it. How wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It would have been soooooo cool.  But I didn&#39;t have the brown paper.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe because it would have felt to you like a really great unit study? You <br/>
don&#39;t need all of that for the kids to get a cool new exposure to life in <br/>
ancient Egypt. They got that. Schools add a lot of the stuff they do just to <br/>
keep the kids busy. You don&#39;t have to do that. You are free to let them flit <br/>
on to the next great discovery. They won&#39;t lose what they experienced about <br/>
ancient Egypt. They&#39;re not learning it for the test. They&#39;ll bring it back <br/>
out when the need arises for them. Probably to make a cool connection about <br/>
another new discovery.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I got the paper a few days later and told them what they could use it for <br/>
&gt;&gt;but they had moved on to something else.  So I want to be there with fun <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think having stuff on hand is a great idea. But more important is to be <br/>
with your children *in the moment*. In *their* moment. If they&#39;ve moved on, <br/>
move along with them. They may decide heiroglyphics sound cool 6 months from <br/>
now. They won&#39;t lose anything by trying it then. And they may find 87 uses <br/>
for that paper in the meantime. It all counts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I know but I want this great place where we can do cool stuff.  I want to <br/>
&gt;&gt;give my kids the life in my dreams.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahhh, you&#39;ve got to know what I&#39;m going to say here. Your kids want the life <br/>
in *their* dreams, and it may look different from yours. Just as my earliest <br/>
readings on homeschooling advised me not to rush right out to spend a lot on <br/>
curriculum, I&#39;m going to suggest that you not buy every cool thing you think <br/>
you might need on hand to complete your children&#39;s learning experience. Take <br/>
some time to see where they lead you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And I really should try those sales but I hate to go shopping.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then wait for the sales to find you. Keep your eyes open when you are in a <br/>
store for something that you think might be fun. BTW, did you know about all <br/>
the cool homeschool discounts you can get at stores like Barnes & Noble <br/>
(20%), Zainy Brainy (10%) and Media Play (15%)? And you&#39;re right, e-bay is <br/>
always fun too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I almost started to cry the first time my 12 yo dd told me how much she <br/>

studies.<br/>

Both, all and neither. <br/>
If you were going to a buffet (okay, ever buffet, salad bar and smorgasbord <br/>

we would say &quot;See what looks good when you get there!&quot;<br/>

Then only get stuff that YOU will like yourself, for yourself, if it turns <br/>
out they have no interest.<br/>
<br/>
And just because nobody shows an interest in the next year or two doesn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both. ;-) I didn&#39;t go out and pick out all of that stuff all by myself. I <br/>
started out with some basic art supplies, maps, computer, books and toys. <br/>
The rest evolved with the kids&#39; interests. Nor did we accumulate it all in <br/>
one week. And forget about deciding ahead of time how and when *I* was going <br/>
to have the kids use it, or what *I* expected them to learn from it. I can&#39;t <br/>
predict where their interests will take us next. I just hang on for the <br/>
ride. :-D<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I hope I get to find the stuff for them because I have fun doing it.&gt;&gt;<br/>

books or magazines. I do the same with my dh and friends. They do the same <br/>
for me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;ll trip up their natural joy in exploring a new discovery if you <br/>
point out all they&#39;ve learned each time. It might start feeling kind of <br/>
schooly, which may make them back off from going further with it. They will <br/>
still learn, even if you don&#39;t  talk to them about them the learning. To me, <br/>
our time is better spent in the actual exploration rather than me making a <br/>
mental checklist of subjects or &quot;basics&quot; covered. (Which I&#39;m not sure if you <br/>
were thinking of or not.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me either. But when thinking about keeping learning a priority, don&#39;t <br/>
discount your role in it all. Maybe one time you&#39;ll decide on the spur of <br/>
the moment to change your swim time so that you can participate in an <br/>
exciting adventure like the one your kids just had. (It won&#39;t be the last <br/>
one, promise.) Think of the priority impact that will make. And no, I&#39;m <br/>
really not saying you shouldn&#39;t have gone to swimming. Really! Just <br/>
something to think about. You are important in all this. More important to <br/>
them than curriculum, the basics, timetables or schedules.<br/>
<br/>
*You* can be part of the joy in their joyful learning. :o)<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Ok, I won&#39;t mention anything about what they&#39;ve learned.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about times I&#39;ve talked with a kid about what he or she knows, <br/>
or how it was learned.  Usually it has been in response to them telling me <br/>
that another kid or someone they know said something to them like &quot;You won&#39;t <br/>
get into college,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;If you went to school you could read better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or sometimes when a kid is in some other way making one of mine feel <br/>
inferior, later I&#39;ll run a comparison on something or other, like...  &quot;He <br/>
reads novels, but you&#39;re a better skater, and you understand game rules <br/>
better.&quot;  That kind of summary reminder stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Tonight Kirby was talking to me about a gameboy advance game he has, Breath <br/>
of Fire.  I asked him if it was something Holly could play.  She&#39;s ten.  When <br/>
he was ten he could read better than she can now.  I&#39;m surprised she wasn&#39;t <br/>
the earliest reader (my pro-girl, early-female development prejudice).  <br/>
Anyway, all he said was it took a lot of reading.   And neither of us said <br/>
anything hopeful or negative about her reading, nor did we reminisce about <br/>
his.  He can read all he wants to now, and she can&#39;t read well enough to play <br/>
Breath of Fire yet.  That&#39;s all.  It&#39;s no different in emotional content than <br/>
if I&#39;d said, &quot;Can you take the trash out?&quot; and if he&#39;d said, &quot;I&#39;m barefooted, <br/>
but Marty has shoes on, and I took it last time.&quot;  &quot;Okay.&quot;  Just <br/>
practicalities, no drama, no angst.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was younger I had more dramatic angst, because I felt the pressure <br/>
of relatives.  It&#39;s all gone now.  I&#39;ll probably feel it some more when he&#39;s <br/>
18 and in college or not, with the spotlight on that transition.<br/>

DD sees all possibilities when looking at things.  Sometimes it appears to others that she does not know what she is doing because they are looking for her to do things the *one* way they know how.<br/>

We told them that we were doing everything we could to give them more quality of life and freedom but feel our quality of life and freedom is being diminished by this behavior.   I told them normally we would be doling out the punishments but we won&#39;t be doing that anymore because we trust that we can work this whole thing out.  We trust that they can be more responsible and considerate.  They both agreed that they could and would.  I was satisfied with how everything went, I guess, except I definitely coerced them into *wanting* to make some changes.  ??????????????? <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you were talking about angst you expressed when Kirby was younger.  Could this have been why Kirby is a better reader?  Are there any negative side affects from displaying your angst?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>.............<br/>
I would say something.  Not only is it wrong and rude.<br/>
It was hurtful.  Takes the breath away as surely as a<br/>
punch in the stomach. <br/>
<br/>
My father (I didn&#39;t grow up with him) and his wife<br/>
are/were both engineers with NASA.  They are both<br/>
supportive of all of the children that they encounter<br/>
(well, except for their won, but they learned from<br/>
that).  They send wonderful things to Roy which he<br/>
enjoys.  Such as a circuit board when he was 5 (he<br/>
called it an &quot;electricity map&quot;...and he was correct).<br/>
Solar powered model car to put together.....Roy loves<br/>
this stuff.  And he composes and writes his own<br/>
thankyou notes, which are almost illegible.  Which<br/>
they do appreciate as all the schooled grands and<br/>
others DON&#39;T write any notes. <br/>
<br/>
They feel that perhaps Roy is the one who may be the<br/>
engineer of his generation.  Dunno, don&#39;t really care.<br/>
 But he does have fun thinking about patterns and flow<br/>
and stress, and playing with the goodies they send.<br/>
(including Inspector Gadget video)<br/>
<br/>
The point is that REAL engineers don&#39;t say things like<br/>
your !*&$^&^!!! neighbor did.  Real engineers<br/>
encourage in subtle ways.<br/>
<br/>
My grandfather was a civil engineer (Ana polis), my<br/>
father an electrical engineer (GA. Tech), my uncle a<br/>
geological engineer (GA. Tech), my step father (13yrs)<br/>
civil engineer (GA. Tech)....... the only time I was<br/>
allowed to say &quot;Hell&quot; was the GA. Tech school song.  I<br/>
don&#39;t recall any of them EVER saying to anyone that<br/>
they would never get to be an engineer, too.<br/>
<br/>
G&#39;Ma Louise, my father&#39;s wife, in her 70s now, is<br/>
still working as an engineer That is what FUN is to<br/>
her, now. They live in Huntsville. (G&#39;Pa Bill has<br/>
shifted more to archaeological spelunking.) G&#39;Ma<br/>
Louise has promised me that if Roy needs help with<br/>
math or trig or any of it beyond what I remember<br/>
(which ain&#39;t much) she will help via the net or phone,<br/>
whatever works.  That is YEARS down the road, if at<br/>
all.  But they don&#39;t push it.  However they don&#39;t<br/>
discourage either!<br/>
<br/>
Gracious! the world is hard enough without making it<br/>
harder on purpose! <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t abide people who say things like that to<br/>
children!<br/>
<br/>
Can you move?<br/>

<br/>
I coerce people into wanting to make changes all the time.  That&#39;s <br/>
inspiration. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember a discussion with some of the total non-coercion proponents once, <br/>
about persuasion.  If persuasions a sin there, maybe it&#39;s just because <br/>
they&#39;re not good at persuasion.  I don&#39;t know.  I think it&#39;s a great tool in <br/>
life in general, and if nobody&#39;s feeling tricked or duped or embarrassed when <br/>
it&#39;s over, then it was free will exercise.<br/>
<br/>
With kids, you were just stating some facts.  If I say &quot;The mess in the den <br/>
is really getting to me.  Could you guys at least get your own stuff out?  <br/>
And I need help with laundry folding.&quot; I&#39;m wanting them to do something.  <br/>
Lots of things.   I&#39;m just not saying &quot;Anything still in here in an hour is <br/>
trash&quot; or &quot;Marty YOU clean it all up, because you&#39;ve been the least helpful <br/>
lately.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sandra, you were talking about angst you expressed when Kirby was younger.  <br/>
Could this have been why Kirby is a better reader?  Are there any negative <br/>
side affects from displaying your angst?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t display it much, I just let it make my stomach acid dance.<br/>
<br/>
There were two and a half reading lessons when Kirby was seven (six or <br/>
seven).  Horrible.  I would love to take those back.  I was afraid of his <br/>
grandma.  Everybody is.  If he had read at two on national TV she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have been happy.  I just hadn&#39;t figured that out, quite, in those days.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still aware of some thing, like my kids don&#39;t have good handwriting, but <br/>
having taught jr. high I remember kids who&#39;d been in school for nine or ten <br/>
years who didn&#39;t have either.   The difference is my kids haven&#39;t been made <br/>
to rewrite boring homework, or gotten bad grades in penmanship, or points <br/>
taken off a grade because they wrote something illegibly, or shamed or <br/>
laughed at in front of 30 people repeatedly for years.   They&#39;re happy guys <br/>
whose writing&#39;s bad, instead of shamed to the core guys whose writing&#39;s bad.  <br/>
  Kirby&#39;s is starting to show some improvement.  He wants to take driver&#39;s <br/>
ed, and he&#39;s learning to cook.  He wrote down a recipe the other day.  Nobody <br/>
made him.<br/>

was no good at it. The rest of us started cracking up. Like Quinn, she has <br/>
done nothing formal in math, but can flip numbers and concepts around like a <br/>
pro. On cue, each of  us started pointing out where she was using &quot;math&quot; <br/>
without realizing it. It was all said in a playful, sweet way. She laughed <br/>
with us and got it pretty quick.<br/>

was homeschooled.  All the reassurance by her dad and others did no <br/>
good.  She seems to have pretty much given up the idea of an academic <br/>
career of any kind.....sad.  If Bonnie had still been alive, you can bet <br/>
she would have blasted her mother in Tessa&#39;s presence for that remark, but <br/>
Dennis was trying to keep the peace with her family.<br/>
