 </span></blockquote>We bought a $350 dollar one, and although it was nice, I was very <br/>
surprised that we couldn&#39;t really see any better than with an <br/>
inexpensive one.  I guess I was expecting to get really up close <br/>
pictures of planets, like what they get from orbiting satellites or <br/>
something.  Anyway, while it was fun, I was disappointed, and we <br/>
ended up selling it in a garage sale after we had enjoyed for three <br/>
or four years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391855724">Our community has an astronomy club.  They have meetings and public sky<br/>
views.  The people there are happy to share what they know.  Also might<br/>
be a good place to buy used.  Maybe your community has something like<br/>
that.  Here is a link to ours.  Maybe they have other links that might be<br/>
useful to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669164794">In The Complete Home Learning Sourcebook, Rebecca Rupp<br/>
writes great stuff about telescope buying. Your<br/>

it. Juli<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tanya,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         My husband has been researching buying telescopes very <br/>
recently.  What he has discovered is that unless you want to spend <br/>
close to 1000 bucks or more, there isn&#39;t a lot of difference between <br/>
a $300 telescope and a GOOD pair of binoculars.  They have binoculars <br/>
designed for astronomy for around $300. Some benefits of binoculars <br/>
were pointed out to him including wider viewing range, portability, <br/>
etc.  He was also advised to get binoculars that had special motors <br/>
that would not shake to help with viewing space.  Just a thought.<br/>
