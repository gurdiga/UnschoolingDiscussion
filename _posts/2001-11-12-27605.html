<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836054906">Hey Linda, Jacli here :) <br/>
Just when you thought it was safe...<br/>
You are too funny!  We live in Boca Raton so the only crime<br/>
we&#39;re<br/>
truly worried about is the outrageous prices at the local<br/>
grocerie stores,<br/>
the mashed-up-moldy-utterly-gross stuff they try to push<br/>
off as fruit<br/>
and the thin soggy mess that they have the nerve to call<br/>
New York style pizza here.  In fact I haven&#39;t had a decent<br/>
double dough extra large in I don&#39;t know how long.  Now<br/>
that&#39;s criminal!<br/>
<br/>
Take care - it&#39;s gone down to 71, I&#39;m going to buy a<br/>
sweater - brr! :)<br/>

Bully for you! <br/>
Yes, you hit the nail on the head. We are up in the 50&#39;s<br/>
and its like a heat <br/>
wave.<br/>
The snow did melt and went away. I know its just lurking<br/>
out there ready to<br/>
dump on us again when we least expect it!<br/>
Florida has a wonderful ring to it! I should like to bask<br/>
in everything it <br/>
would have<br/>
to offer, except for the crime. See I know this as I watch<br/>
wayyy to much TV,<br/>
which ha ha, scares me right into staying where I am at. <br/>
And like ND doesn&#39;t have the crime, but in the winter the<br/>
kooks all seem to <br/>
leave!<br/>
thinking again way to much! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629589666">(I had to reply to you on this one also!) kind of reading emails backwards <br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Ok I am here to tell you 71 is a heat wave!<br/>
70 is considered a beautiful warm day here in ND.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the education on Florida, my small mind is<br/>
opening to the thought that your windows aren&#39;t barred up,<br/>
and life isn&#39;t so consumed with &quot;bad boys, bad boys what ya gonna do when<br/>
they come for you?&quot; people. ha! Moldy fruit and sloppy pizza hmmmmm........<br/>
<br/>
We have Pizza Hut, (among others pizza places) they do have a NEW YORKER<br/>
that is good. Our bananas in the stores are sometimes still green.<br/>
Of course for the topic of pizza, I have heard so much about authentic New <br/>
York<br/>
pizza, that it would the pizza chains around here to shame. It must be good.<br/>
<br/>
My 16 year old son got his first deer this weekend. (thanks to my ex, the <br/>
hunting<br/>
fever wore off on to my baby).<br/>
So, he called home last night and told me to get some newspaper ready,<br/>
as he was bringing home a hind quarter&gt; <br/>
I was freaking out!!!!! It was like a killer called and said he was on his <br/>
way!!!<br/>
Like .........there was going to be a hind quarter of anything brought into <br/>
my<br/>
home! LOL NO WAY!!!<br/>
I am not into deer anything, unless its produced by Disney!<br/>
<br/>
So ponder on this one!<br/>
