<div id="ygrps-yiv-445922000">I do not think I have ever posted I have a 2 yr old and plan to unschool. I am so thankful to all the groups I am on I have learned so much in the past 2 yrs.<br/>
I have learned about myself the most. I guess I am looking for a why?<br/>
why do parents live through their children?? low self worth and esteem?<br/>
They take an activity that a child likes or is gifted in and force push eat sleep breath that activity until the child HATES it!<br/>
When I was small I used to LOVE to sing by my self --My mother figured her fathers gift of voice passed on to me-she always wanted to be a singer-- so I HAD to have lessons I didn&#39;t WANT lessons.<br/>
<br/>
well soon after I got lessons and all I heard was oh it is your money maker---&quot;you have learning disabilities and dyslexia so it will be difficult for you later on&quot; <br/>
by 13 singing opera (rolling the eyes)I am still scared of public performance.<br/>
lessons contests shows like those poor kids in those beauty pageants!!<br/>
here is where i got a major attitude how I dealt with my stress and hate of singing--I put on a FAKE ego that I was the BEST and I became a ruthless competitor. I announced I wanted to quit at 15 -they came at me with the $$$ AMOUNT I would OWE THEM back for 3 yrs of lessons!!! who does this??<br/>
<br/>
after yrs of this I had NO desire to go to college. I hated every second of school why would I go on. ya well I HAD to go to an arts school for singing because &quot;that is your bread and butter&quot; Message to me was your too stupid to work in the real world so you have to sing for your supper.<br/>
Got there after one semester and I was 18 I quit I have never sung again I still cannot even sing in the car to myself after 17 yrs. <br/>
<br/>
some parents are just as guilty as public schools when it comes to being dream killers---my son his gifts& talents what ever they may be are his and for him. sorry for the vent.-Q-</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386376426">Hear hear!!   So true.  So important to treasure our children&#39;s gifts and allow them the peace to enjoy them without requirements. At a young age I was told to either audition for Julliard or stop playing piano. I quit.  I hated performing.  Every recital was so anxiety producing! Fortunately I made my own rules for guitar and singing. I allow my children to decide what instruments they want to learn.  <br/>

One isn&#39;t necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can&#39;t be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.<br/>
