<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916718201">Yes, it has been a huge problem for our children.  But with experience, we&#39;<br/>
ve learned to bring it largely under control.<br/>
<br/>
 You see, we live in Portland, Oregon.  Before we moved here, we suspected<br/>
it was a good place to homeschool.  Talk about understatement!  After a few<br/>
years in this area, we&#39;ve got lots of hard evidence that if there ever were<br/>
a contest for America&#39;s homeschooling mecca,  Portland would easily make the<br/>
short list.<br/>
<br/>
 Everywhere we go, we run into homeschoolers.  We have associations with<br/>
scores of homeschooling families.  Without exception, they are all involved<br/>
in a variety of activities.  There are homeschooling roller-skating parties,<br/>
archery classes, a homeschooling basketball group, access to high school<br/>
band, community college courses, and varsity sports for teenage<br/>
homeschoolers, co-op language classes, volunteer opportunities, daytime art<br/>
classes, music classes, singing groups, theater productions, science labs at<br/>
a local museum, organized field trips practically every day of the week,<br/>
girl and boy scouts homeschooling groups--the list goes on an on.<br/>
<br/>
 And that, dear reader, is the core of our children&#39;s&#39; socialization<br/>
problem:  too many activities, and too little time.<br/>
<br/>
 Homeschoolers, without the constraints of a 6-hour-a-day school schedule,<br/>
are extremely vulnerable to falling into the trap of  too many outside<br/>
activities and too much social interaction.  This can be dangerous<br/>
especially if we hope to teach our children to appreciate and enjoy the<br/>
quiet reflective life.<br/>
<br/>
 So, my wife Mandy and I are learning to apply the brakes; to slow things<br/>
down a bit.  One step we&#39;ve taken is to develop a weekly schedule of sorts.<br/>
We don&#39;t hold hard and fast to this, but rather use it as a guide.  It looks<br/>
something like this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Monday<br/>
At home academically-oriented day; also clean-the-house day.  Our children<br/>
usually spend the late afternoon and early evening outside playing with the<br/>
neighborhood children.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday<br/>
Co-op learning with other homeschoolers; also some academics, and afternoon<br/>
outside play with neighborhood children.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday<br/>
Mandy and children volunteer at the library.  At the moment, they shelve<br/>
books, label items, and help with other projects.  We try to do some<br/>
academics as well and, of course, there is time for afternoon outside play<br/>
with neighborhood children.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday<br/>
Slow day (intentionally); sometimes co-op classes; evening achievement group<br/>
for our daughter and soon cub scouts for our son.<br/>
<br/>
Friday<br/>
Family outing day; this can be a volunteer project which we do as a family<br/>
(our current one is helping out a pioneer living history museum), or going<br/>
to the beach, visiting historic sites, the zoo, public gardens, museums,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 This general plan helps us to pace ourselves throughout the week, and<br/>
provides a &quot;first-line defense&quot; against the constant barrage of social<br/>
activities.  It gives us a sensible framework.  It also enables us to enjoy<br/>
regular unrushed time together.<br/>
<br/>
 So, if you&#39;re thinking about homeschooling, and you live in a city with<br/>
tons of homeschoolers or lots of interesting things to do, you&#39;ll definitely<br/>
need to come up with a strategy to keep the socialization problem under<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
 Because, unless you do, you could easily slip into the oversocialization<br/>
trap.  Believe me, you don&#39;t want that.  It&#39;ll wear you out, and could<br/>
seriously detract from the quality of your homeschooling experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563354513">Over-commitment is our current nemesis!<br/>
<br/>
My son is in Webelos, Karate (classes twice a week), speech therapy  and<br/>
Little League.  He has a lawn mowing business with one paying customer,<br/>
plus he is responsible for mowing our 1 1/2 acres.  He is practicing for a<br/>
karate demonstration, hence, has two extra karate classes per week.  Plus,<br/>
we get together with another homeschooling family one day a week.  All this<br/>
is fun, however..............<br/>
<br/>
I find that chores are what get the short shrift.  I realized yesterday<br/>
that I need to schedule in cleaning time and daily put-away-all-our-junk<br/>
time.  Groceries are already scheduled in.<br/>
<br/>
And, now there is gardening, which draws me like a magnet.<br/>
<br/>
Arghhh...............<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; in a variety of activities.  There are homeschooling roller-skating<br/>
&gt; &gt;parties,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; archery classes, a homeschooling basketball group, access to high<br/>
school<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; band, community college courses, and varsity sports for teenage<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; homeschoolers, co-op language classes, volunteer opportunities, daytime<br/>
&gt; &gt;art<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; classes, music classes, singing groups, theater productions, science<br/>
labs<br/>
&gt; &gt;at<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; a local museum, organized field trips practically every day of the<br/>
week,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; girl and boy scouts homeschooling groups--the list goes on an on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;  And that, dear reader, is the core of our children&#39;s&#39; socialization<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; problem:  too many activities, and too little time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;  Homeschoolers, without the constraints of a 6-hour-a-day school<br/>
schedule,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; are extremely vulnerable to falling into the trap of  too many outside<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; activities and too much social interaction.  This can be dangerous<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; especially if we hope to teach our children to appreciate and enjoy the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; quiet reflective life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;  So, my wife Mandy and I are learning to apply the brakes; to slow<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; down a bit.  One step we&#39;ve taken is to develop a weekly schedule of<br/>
&gt; &gt;sorts.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We don&#39;t hold hard and fast to this, but rather use it as a guide.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt;looks<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; something like this:<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Monday<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; At home academically-oriented day; also clean-the-house day.  Our<br/>
children<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; usually spend the late afternoon and early evening outside playing with<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; neighborhood children.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Tuesday<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Co-op learning with other homeschoolers; also some academics, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;afternoon<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; outside play with neighborhood children.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Wednesday<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Mandy and children volunteer at the library.  At the moment, they<br/>
shelve<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; books, label items, and help with other projects.  We try to do some<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; academics as well and, of course, there is time for afternoon outside<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; with neighborhood children.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thursday<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Slow day (intentionally); sometimes co-op classes; evening achievement<br/>
&gt; &gt;group<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; for our daughter and soon cub scouts for our son.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Friday<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Family outing day; this can be a volunteer project which we do as a<br/>
family<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (our current one is helping out a pioneer living history museum), or<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to the beach, visiting historic sites, the zoo, public gardens,<br/>
museums,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;  This general plan helps us to pace ourselves throughout the week, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; provides a &quot;first-line defense&quot; against the constant barrage of social<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; activities.  It gives us a sensible framework.  It also enables us to<br/>
&gt; &gt;enjoy<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; regular unrushed time together.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;  So, if you&#39;re thinking about homeschooling, and you live in a city<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tons of homeschoolers or lots of interesting things to do, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt;definitely<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; need to come up with a strategy to keep the socialization problem under<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; control.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;  Because, unless you do, you could easily slip into the<br/>
oversocialization<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; trap.  Believe me, you don&#39;t want that.  It&#39;ll wear you out, and could<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; seriously detract from the quality of your homeschooling experience.<br/>
