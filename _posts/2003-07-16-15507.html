<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would be Anne Murray, I believe...<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve been sitting here trying to think how it might make sense with a <br/>
female singer...  These are the lyrics she sings (some are different from the <br/>
Monkees version)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I could hide &#39;neath the wings of the bluebird as she sleeps 1<br/>
The six o&#39;clock alarm would never ring<br/>
But it rings and we rise, wipe the sleep out of our eyes2<br/>
The shavin&#39; razor&#39;s cold and it stings 3<br/>
<br/>
CHORUS<br/>
Cheer up, sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean <br/>
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen? 4<br/>
<br/>
I once thought of you as a white knight on a steed 5<br/>
Now you know how happy we can be<br/>
Oh, and our good times **started then<br/>
With a dollar one to spend** 6<br/>
But how much baby do we really need? 7<br/>
<br/>
1 Well, &quot;sleeps&quot; doesn&#39;t make any more sense than &quot;sings,&quot; and it doesn&#39;t <br/>
rhyme, but perhaps Anne is afraid of heights.<br/>
<br/>
2 Note that this time, both of them have to get up. Well, that seems more <br/>
fair. It would also explain better why Jean, mentioned later, is a bit cranky.<br/>
<br/>
3 So...let&#39;s assume Anne&#39;s let the legs go a little while, and she has to <br/>
meet someone important. She brings out the old razor, and it&#39;s cold, and she only <br/>
has ivory soap, so there are quite a few nicks going on there too.... On the <br/>
other hand, maybe the razor isn&#39;t hers...maybe it&#39;s Jean&#39;s, and Jean is just <br/>
too damned lazy (or cranky) to buy a good sharp razor.<br/>
<br/>
4 We&#39;ve established that in this version, Jean has to get up too, so I can <br/>
understand the mood problem. No one really WANTS to get up at six.<br/>
<br/>
However, we&#39;re still left with the question: Who is Jean????<br/>
Well, a couple of possibilities. First, Anne is Canadian, so perhaps Jean is <br/>
from Quebec, and is male. If that&#39;s the case, maybe Anne is the Daydream <br/>
Believer, and Jean is the home coming Queen. Perhaps this song is lamenting the <br/>
fact that she has feelings for her gay male friend, who alas, does not return <br/>
them.  Maybe he&#39;s staying with her while recovering from a bad relationship, <br/>
which is also the reason why he needs to cheer up.<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is this. There have been rumors for years that Anne is a <br/>
lesbian. Maybe Jean is female, and her lover. Then either of them could be the <br/>
DB or the HQ.<br/>
<br/>
5 Well, if Jean is a gay male, and Anne was under the impression that he <br/>
could save her or something, and was happy about that, then that would explain the <br/>
whole white knight thing. But later, she reflects that they don&#39;t really need <br/>
that, and she can just nurse Jean through this hard time.<br/>
<br/>
If Jean is female, then we&#39;re just being sexist to assume that a white knight <br/>
can&#39;t be female, now aren&#39;t we?<br/>
<br/>
6 Well, this is clearly an example of misheard lyrics (the original said <br/>
&quot;Without dollar one to spend&quot;) but it works too. The Monkees version is just a <br/>
little poorer. You can have a good time with $1.01.<br/>
<br/>
7 Whatever the situation, I think Anne and Jean are gonna be alright.<br/>
<br/>

not the Homecoming Queen...<br/>

knight would make perfect sense!  The rest of the song makes even less sense<br/>
then, of course.<br/>

in,&quot; but who&#39;s to argue with art?).<br/>
