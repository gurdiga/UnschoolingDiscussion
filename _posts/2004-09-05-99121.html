<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837748430">Marty really likes the Beatles, and we&#39;ve listed quite a bit to a tape I made <br/>
years ago for Keith when he was having to drive a lot.  It has Beatles &#39;65, <br/>
Something New and Yesterday and Today.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I&#39;d simply now buy those on CD.<br/>
<br/>
THEY ARE NOT THERE.<br/>
<br/>
What the heck!?<br/>
<br/>
The CDs seem to be of all British albums, which I can respect.  I have long <br/>
had British LPs in addition to my English stuff (though I never had &quot;Beatles <br/>
for Sale&quot;), but this is disturbing.  <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m ordering &quot;Past Masters&quot; (something I think is new to CD) but it&#39;s not <br/>
going to have all that stuff.  And part of the whole thing with albums is <br/>
hearing those songs in the order they were originally.  Usually that&#39;s wonderful.  <br/>
(Worst exception:  Yellow Submarine coming right after Here, There and <br/>
Everywhere on Revolver; could&#39;ve lived without that, but Revolver IS on CD).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know why they didnt just put each album to a CD as was done with so <br/>
many (all?) other groups?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I couldn&#39;t just keep making cassette tapes from the albums I <br/>
have, it&#39;s just that CDs are easier for my kids to use than tapes or albums.<br/>
<br/>
(I would have put this question at unschooling.com, but it&#39;s down, and so I&#39;m <br/>
misusing this list a little bit; sorry.)<br/>

You can change the cassettes into cds yourself.  Go to Radio Shack <br/>
(or some type of electronics store--best buy, circuit city, staples, <br/>
etc.) and buy a cord that costs $3-$6.  I don&#39;t know the name of the <br/>
cord, but the Radio Shack people should know what you&#39;re talking <br/>
about and be able to help you find it.  One part of the cord will <br/>
pluck into an earphone jack (like how walkmans have earphone jacks).  <br/>
The other end of the cord plugs into the back of the computer.  <br/>
There&#39;s a slot on the back of the computer where the sound card is <br/>
for it to plug into.  <br/>
<br/>

Converting cassette tapes is not difficult. You will need an audio <br/>
system in your computer, something almost all new machines have. Run <br/>
a cable from the line-out port of your tape player or receiver to the <br/>
line-in port of your computer&#39;s sound system.<br/>
<br/>
I would use the free Audacity software to convert the sound to <br/>
digital and clean up any pops or hisses. You can download Audacity <br/>
at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about.php">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about.php</a><br/>
<br/>
Once you have your music on your hard drive, you can export it to <br/>
CDs. The software that comes with your DVD burner will do that, as <br/>
will many free programs.<br/>
<br/>
All of the things you want to do are mainstream issues today. Just <br/>
about any modern computer will do fine.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll save this for when I have a modern computer! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
(Really.  Thinking of upgrading, but another used car seems like the next <br/>
project.)<br/>
