<div id="ygrps-yiv-205292615">I was wondering if anyone can help me out with this one. I live in <br/>
Oak Park, Michigan. Does anyone know if you need a teacher <br/>
certification to home school your child in Michigan? I went to the <br/>
state board of Education site, but it wasn`t real clear on this <br/>
issue.Other than claiming exempt for religious reasons. Their has to <br/>
be another way. I would appreciate any help on this one. Thanks in <br/>
advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785324691">I live in BC  Mi and have been homeschooling for 7years.  In Mi. you do not <br/>
need<br/>
anything. You do not even have to register and if you do we usually say to <br/>
write on the registration that it is voluntary.  There is a great group of <br/>
unschoolers and some eclectic type in  Ann Arbor.  The group is called <br/>
clonlara and they have been around for over 30 years  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clonlara.org/&quot;">http://www.clonlara.org/&quot;</a>&gt;Clonlara School was <br/>
founded in 1967 as an innovative, private day school functioning as a day <br/>
school serving 5 through 18 year&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
be sure to check out the convention in June, you should go if you can. It is <br/>
fun for both the parents and children.  <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contact me with any other questuons<br/>
