&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes,  but not everyday like some would think after watching the <br/>
Wizard of Oz.  I&#39;ve lived in Kansas for all, but about 10 of my 43 <br/>
years,  and I&#39;ve only seen one tornado (when I was 10).  We had some <br/>
damage a few years ago from a funnel that passed overhead,  but we <br/>
were in the basement at the time.  I do consider a basement or storm <br/>
shelter almost a necessity here - wouldn&#39;t want to live in a mobile <br/>
home although some do.  We have a lot of wind here on a daily basis <br/>
even without any storms.  What we want now is some snow!!!!<br/>
We&#39;ve had such a dry, warm fall that our biggest problem has been <br/>
prairie fires.  People routinely do controlled burns here on <br/>
farmland.  It makes the soil richer and does away with the scrubby <br/>
brush that tends to take over.  With dry weather like we&#39;ve had,  <br/>
it&#39;s easy for those burns to get out of control,  so we&#39;ve had some <br/>
burn bans,  but we&#39;ve still had problems.  We finally got some rain <br/>
so that should help.  For awhile we could walk out the front door,  <br/>
smell fire,  and know that the praire was burning somewhere.<br/>
