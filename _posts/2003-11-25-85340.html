<div id="ygrps-yiv-178835920">SO...I looked and yes, I&#39;m rather close to make it worth going to (just a couple hours away on the Cape) but...it&#39;ll take some planning. Would be nice if just Sarah and I could go and even stay in a local hotel as a special treat rather than rushing home and back up the next day.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d like to hear from others who have gone before about their experience. Sandra, I understand you&#39;re one of the presenters?<br/>

One of the best parts of conferences is being in the hotel where the <br/>
conference is.  Do that if you can, even if you have to borrow the money.   I think it <br/>
will make a big difference in the weekend, and honestly in your whole life.<br/>

Feel free to interrogate him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It will definately make a huge difference in your experience.  I room <br/>
shared with 2 other families last time to make it affordable.  We had <br/>
a great time and no one complained about being cramped and no one <br/>
fought over the bathroom.  I know there will be people looking to <br/>
room share.  Even if you only share with one other family, that cuts <br/>
your hotel bill in half.  Transportation costs from the cape has got <br/>
to be less than a tank of gas.  You&#39;d pay too much on gas driving <br/>
back and forth, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What we did after hours:  <br/>
*We sat around the pool drinking wine and getting to know each other <br/>
until the security guard kicked us out an hour after he was supposed <br/>
to (he wouldn&#39;t stay and have a glass of wine with us, I asked). <br/>
*Unable to tear ourselves away and allow this night to end, a group <br/>
of us went to one room to hang out a little longer.<br/>
*Teens hung out together until 3 am when they were ready for bed <br/>
(remember a lot of teens are coming from a time zone where 3am for us <br/>
is only midnight to them.)<br/>
*We still made the 9am speaker (most of us). <br/>
<br/>
Yes, come Elizabeth.  It will change your life.<br/>
