<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862857355"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; but the constant questions mess with my concentration and I make dumb<br/>
&gt;mistakes like sewing the wrong side together. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I made a small quilt for my mom for Xmas.  I wrote down for her what all<br/>
the colors and shapes in it symbolized.  I told her that the binding<br/>
symbolized -- ahem -- &quot;persistence&quot;, because I invented so many wrong ways<br/>
to do it -- wrong sides, wrong direction, wrong everything.<br/>
