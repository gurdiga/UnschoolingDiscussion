Question here, what are the chances of me having crayons with lead in them<br/>
now?<br/>
are there any still floating around out there, that maybe I have picked up<br/>
at a garage sale or something? the reason I ask is my daughter and her<br/>
friend melted crayons in my microwave (with permission)  with intent to<br/>
remold them into shapes, anyway, it totally zapped my microwave!!! and Mary<br/>
Ellens husband is going to fix it, and the first thing he asked is if the<br/>
crayons had lead in them!  we acctually laughed at this , we had no idea<br/>
!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916136515">Just to let you know that we basically stick with Crayola crayons for this<br/>
reason.  There are lots of &quot;made in China&quot; and generic crayons which we never<br/>
use in our home.  Some crayons that have been given to us as promotions<br/>
(restaurants etc.) we don&#39;t keep.<br/>
<br/>
While on the subject of contaminants I no longer buy Sauces such as flavoured<br/>
soy sauces from non- American sources.  This is because I heard a Hong Kong<br/>
gentleman on the radio talking about how the high levels of a suspect substance<br/>
in his company&#39;s oyster sauce were perfectly legal in Hong Kong even if<br/>
standards were much tighter elsewhere.  (as if to say he didn&#39;t understand what<br/>
the big flap was about....he wasn&#39;t breaking any laws.)<br/>
