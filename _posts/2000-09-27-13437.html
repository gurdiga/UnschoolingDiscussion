<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432650882">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this Unschooling thing.  We have many children from blending families together.  Some are in public school others in private, due to ex-es choice.  <br/>
<br/>
We want to homeschool our children that live with us.  I like the sound of unschooling homeschool but I want to know more about it.  My brothers went through BECCA and our older daughters were in ACE.  A friend uses Bob Jones and another uses &quot;See Math&quot; (I think that is what it is called).  So I am know about homeschooling choices.<br/>
<br/>
I just found the web sight for FIAR which sounds good.   What else do you do?  How do you know your are getting the right lessons taught for the right level of learning.  Yes I know I am still thinking of schooling but humor me.  I really think this might be the way we go.  I want structure with freedom.  I will be homeschooling with babies running around so I need that freedom.<br/>
<br/>
No one this year is the right age and living with us.  But that changes from year to year.  Last year we had our daughter living with us and this year she is with her mom<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315958130">I&#39;m in a similar boat.  DD in ps because her mom wouldn&#39;t even consider<br/>
something better just moved in with us last year.  DS in college lives with<br/>
mom but looking to escape but doesn&#39;t want to move in here.  (3 bedrooms & 4<br/>
kids is full he&#39;d make 5)<br/>
<br/>
We use Math U See, Teaching Reading at Home & the WISE GUIDE and the<br/>
LIBRARY!!  The kids do a lot of computer games which are educational & make<br/>
them use math, reading & spelling.  We work on DD&#39;s Girl Scout merit badges<br/>
& found a web page that matches them to homeschool type curriculum to check<br/>
off for our yearly evaluation.  She has a blast.  The boys (4 & 2) run in &<br/>
out but aren&#39;t interested in learning to read or write.</div>

Because each child is learning something he didn&#39;t know before.  &quot;The right <br/>

<br/>
Just wanted to chime in and second this idea! I found the unschool mesage boards to be incredibly helpful in learning about unschooling. I would check in and read every morning and then think and digest the ideas while on my walk..Now, I check in once a week or so, and the message boards are still very helpful - esp if I am feeling any unschooling worry or angst! :-)..Leonie W. <br/>

 </span></blockquote> We don&#39;t have a schedule which is part of the joy of unschooling. <br/>
Today I have a migraine (I should be in bed really rather than sitting <br/>
here). My 3 kids (10, 9 and 7) have made candles and are now <br/>
heating up bits of food over the candles in little dolls frying pans to <br/>
&#39;see what happens&#39;. They&#39;ve been doing it about 3 hours I think and <br/>
are having a fab time. Tomorrow a friend might come round and the <br/>
kids will play, at some point we gotta get groceries.<br/>
Days normally pass like that. Yestrady we watched 3 movies. The <br/>
Day before my two youngest decided to do online maths tests. <br/>
This table is covered with bits of paper with adding up sums all over <br/>
them.<br/>
Some days they might pull out a workbook (very rare at the mo) <br/>
other days we watch TV, read books, look up stuff on the net. They <br/>
choose what to do, if anything, when they feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I wouldn&#39;t make &#39;schedules&#39; cos that leads to pressure <br/>
and anxiety that you are not sticking to it and that will affect your <br/>
children. I think unschooling isn&#39;t about pressyre and coercian.<br/>
One day at a time is my motto.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976221292">Ok,so I&#39;m still confused,is there supposed to be learning from doing these normal everyday things,for example,do you make dinner a math project or what learning is going on.I hope that doesn&#39;t sound like I think you&#39;re not teaching your kids anything,I just got a book on unschooling but haven&#39;t had time to read through it yet.I think I&#39;d rather my kids be unschooled,I just worry about if they are & will learn anything.If you go to the movies,do you make them tell about the story line or something?Sorry about all the questions,I just want to know exactly what all of you here do with your kids.Maybe I do some unschooling & didn&#39;t know it. :) My girls would be thankful if we did unschooling,I&#39;m sure. :)<br/>

Try thinking about you - how do you learn things? Do you go read a book on gardening and then write a book report? No, you read it, enjoy it, and maybe talk about it with family or friends, maybe plant a few things yourself, right? Same thing with your kids. If they&#39;re interested in something, help them find ways to learn about it - books, movies, internet, etc. They&#39;ll learn what they need to from it! Then, if they&#39;re still interested, you can offer for them to look into it more or make something related to it. We&#39;re putting finishing touches on some paper mache caterpillars that came from an idea out of some nature magazines. If you had to write a book report on every book you read, what would happen? You&#39;d soon stop reading books! Or you&#39;d read, trying to file things away to remember to put in the report, and you&#39;d not get any enjoyment or real learning out of it. If you really want or need the reassurance of hearing them talk about what they&#39;ve gotten from a book or movie, ask them. Something like &quot;I liked that funny guy who always had a green hat on, but I can&#39;t remember his name, do you know?&quot;. Or &quot;I bet Daddy would like for you to tell him what we saw today at the museum since he couldn&#39;t go with us.&quot; Cooking dinner is just that - sure they&#39;ll get math and reading and home ec skills out of it, but it&#39;s still just cooking dinner. Not a project, just a fact of life. :-)<br/>
<br/>
HTH!<br/>
Myranda<br/>
<br/>
  Ok,so I&#39;m still confused,is there supposed to be learning from doing these normal everyday things,for example,do you make dinner a math project or what learning is going on.I hope that doesn&#39;t sound like I think you&#39;re not teaching your kids anything,I just got a book on unschooling but haven&#39;t had time to read through it yet.I think I&#39;d rather my kids be unschooled,I just worry about if they are & will learn anything.If you go to the movies,do you make them tell about the story line or something?Sorry about all the questions,I just want to know exactly what all of you here do with your kids.Maybe I do some unschooling & didn&#39;t know it. :) My girls would be thankful if we did unschooling,I&#39;m sure. :)<br/>

  most days. Today&#39;s goes: <br/>
<br/>
  12:30 Drive Alex to Davis<br/>
<br/>
  1:00  Rain to Teen Movie Thing (although they made it  9 and up movie<br/>
  thing just for her), me to coffee<br/>
<br/>
  4:15 Rain to soccer scrimmage<br/>
<br/>
  6-ish Dinner at Chez Taco Bell<br/>
<br/>
  7:30 Carousel Rehearsal for Rain, painting Carousel sets for me<br/>
<br/>
  9:30 Drive home, hope  Nana was willing to go outside with the neighbors<br/>
  at least once<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s a schedule based on doing the stuff we want to do, not on anything<br/>
  schooly....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Renee.  Welcome to this list!  Here&#39;s a link that can be helpful.  It&#39;s <br/>
very short and sweet and might help you understand what unschooling <br/>
is.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pacinfo.com/~handley/unschool.html">http://www.pacinfo.com/~handley/unschool.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Also, check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/library/index.shtml">http://www.unschooling.com/library/index.shtml</a> which has <br/>
lots of essays and reading recommendations that can help you understand <br/>
what this is all about.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, unschooling is ultimately trusting your children.  It&#39;s <br/>
knowing that your children have a natural desire to learn, and getting out <br/>
of their way so that they can learn the way they need to.  Think about it <br/>
this way:  You didn&#39;t teach your children to walk and talk; they <br/>
learned.  It&#39;s an important distinction.  But that&#39;s how we humans do <br/>
it.  We learn what&#39;s important for us to learn.  When a child has a need to <br/>
learn to read or understand the way math works, he or she learns.  We know <br/>
what we need to learn, and if we&#39;re in an setting that&#39;s not pressured, we <br/>
can be in touch enough with ourselves to know what we need.  That&#39;s our <br/>
role as parents: To allow our children the space they need to be in touch <br/>
with themselves so they can follow their hearts and learn what they need <br/>
and want to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s what I have gotten out of unschooling so far.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>
new at it, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get lots of other better answer than <br/>
this.  My feeling is that when children are allowed to unschool, they are <br/>
given the freedom to be themselves without the pressure of others&#39; <br/>
expectations.  This list is very helpful in reminding each other how we can <br/>
best protect our children&#39;s space to be themselves.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> It&#39;s pretty normal to be doubtful at first, especially when you are <br/>
used to workbooks and tests &#39;measuring&#39; learning ina  recognisably <br/>
acceptable form.<br/>
All living is learning. It can&#39;t be helped. It just happens. Your child <br/>
watching a candle flame is learning,  looking out of the window at <br/>
clouds is learning.<br/>
I suspect you mean by &#39;learning&#39; the narrow framework of <br/>
acceptable &#39;knowledge&#39; that children are forced to learn in school. If <br/>
you think about the vast sum of human knowledge and then <br/>
compare that to the tiny section that schools have judged to be <br/>
necassary you can see that schooling doesn&#39;t begin to cover all <br/>
that it means to be a human being.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I feel that enabling my child to be a confident human <br/>
being, able to make his or her own way in life is the most valuable <br/>
ability that I can help my child with. If you know &#39;how&#39; to learn and <br/>
how to trust your own judgement then the things that are <br/>
necassary to exist in this world are at your fingertips.<br/>
If your child feels that &#39;academic&#39; subjects are necassary to get on <br/>
in life then those are easily acquired with unschooling too. <br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t preclude workbooks and text boooks or even <br/>
college but day to day living can help a child acquire knowledge of <br/>
those academic subjects often without recourse to dry and boring <br/>
textbooks.<br/>
A few examples...<br/>
Maths is one of the easiest. Young children love to count and <br/>
descibe the porperties of objects. Songs often have counting <br/>
games, cookery involves fractions, multiplication and division, <br/>
weights, measures. Sewing teaches shapes, lengths.<br/>
Children constantly ask questions about their environment..&#39;why is <br/>
the sky blue, why are flames hot, why do we eat food&#39;.<br/>
History is all around us, even in the US. Me and my brood used to <br/>
hang out in castles (I&#39;m from the UK)<br/>
<br/>
As the child gets older their interests become more complex. Mine <br/>
recently took out every book the library possessed on ancient <br/>
egyptians. My 10 yo has become interested in WW2 and asks <br/>
endless questions of her grandma who was born in 1935 and grew <br/>
up during the Blitz in England.<br/>
My 9 yo has expressed the desire to become a vet so has taken to <br/>
asking for maths workbooks and biology textbooks. Maybe the <br/>
interest will pass. It is up to him.<br/>
I am sure that if they require academic qualifications for something <br/>
they wish to do in the future then they are equiped to obtain that <br/>
knowledge required for the piece of paper.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t question my kids to &#39;test&#39; or &#39;check&#39; on their learning. It <br/>
is theirs alone to do with as they will. Usually they are so excited <br/>
about it they share it eagerly. Often when I&#39;m lying in the bath!!! My <br/>
daughter read all the Horrible Histories and I&#39;ve recieved a blow-by-<br/>
blow account of nearly all the books. My son was so thrilled to <br/>
discover that multiplication was really just adding up lots of times <br/>
that I missed an episode of Stargate while he told me all about it.<br/>
<br/>
All this seems to happen in bits and pieces. Often they do nothing <br/>
but slaughter things on the PlayStation for days on end and <br/>
sometimes I feel anxious about their future but when I look at the <br/>
big picture, the long time frame, I see them turning into confident <br/>
human beings that have many interests.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps. I think I rambled a bit.<br/>

I just noticed you said you have a book but haven&#39;t read it yet.  You should <br/>
read it!  Otherwise we end up writing everthing that&#39;s already in your book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you go to the movies,do you make them tell about the story line or <br/>
something?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want to teach them to hate movies you might want to do that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the course of everyday real life people DO talk about movies though, and <br/>
that will happen.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people take their kids out of school, but they take the school home <br/>
with them.<br/>

&gt;Date: Tue, Oct 29, 2002, 2:29 PM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ok,so I&#39;m still confused,is there supposed to be learning from doing these<br/>
&gt; normal everyday things,for example,do you make dinner a math project or<br/>
&gt; what learning is going on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We just eat our dinner and sometime during that dinner everyone will learn<br/>
something (peas are revolting or Dad has a big shipping day tomorrow or the<br/>
cat likes pickles or E=MC squared, or whatever else happens to come up<br/>
during our dinner in the natural flow of things).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I hope that doesn&#39;t sound like I think you&#39;re not<br/>
&gt; teaching your kids anything<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t do Me Teacher, You Student. We do learn from each other, including<br/>
them learning from me and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I just got a book on unschooling but haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; had time to read through it yet.I think I&#39;d rather my kids be unschooled,I<br/>
&gt; just worry about if they are & will learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What book? Read that and here and at www.unschooling.com -- you won&#39;t know<br/>
if you want to try unschooling or how to not be worried, if you don&#39;t make<br/>
time to find out. Unschooling works best when paired with Unworrying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you go to the<br/>
&gt; movies,do you make them tell about the story line or something?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is Un Schooling. No school. Not Doing School, even in disguise,<br/>
or with a spoonful of sugar. It&#39;s about banishing school (including tests,<br/>
grades, book reports, enforced curriculum, unit studies, dress-down Friday,<br/>
dress codes at all, grade levels, homework, raising hand to go to the<br/>
bathroom, getting to bed early so you can catch the bus, etc.) from our<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe I do some unschooling & didn&#39;t know it. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t. :) Unschooling is not what you do between the math workbooks and<br/>
reading practice. You can&#39;t do it part-time.<br/>
<br/>
I think you would find it very helpful to go to www.unschooling.com and read<br/>
the message boards there (not to say you&#39;re not welcome here, too, but it&#39;s<br/>
useful to go to the message boards because there are lots and lots of<br/>
messages just waiting there that will answer many of your questions about<br/>
What Unschooling Is).<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<br/>
It may sound strange to someone who was once starved for information,<br/>
but the opportunity to read for a week without sleeping is not<br/>
universally regarded as a treat.  ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
... on the other hand, I probably would also be unenthusiastic about<br/>
sleeping for a week without reading.  &#39;Specially if I had to give up unschooling.com.<br/>

<br/>
Some people find it helpful, either for themselves or a nervous husband, to<br/>
keep a journal of what the kids do, noticing the &quot;educational value&quot; of what<br/>
they do.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing it for long because you want to move as<br/>
quickly as you can away from subjects and &quot;educational value&quot; to the value<br/>
of everything they do.  Also, talking about working and learning makes it<br/>
sound like you still think learning has to be hard work.  It really doesn&#39;t.<br/>

to answer your questions,i just came across the unschholing book by accident & I skimmed through it but it&#39;s more like a novel,I was hoping to find maybe a list of what unschoolers do in a regular day since I really don&#39;t have time right now t read an entire book with our house for sale,etc.<br/>
 <br/>
i can&#39;t see why they would hate movies if i ask them about it,when i watch something with my husband we discuss it,so i see nothing wrong about initiating the conversation.<br/>
 <br/>
lastly,my kids have never attended school of any sort so they do not know what &quot;real&quot; schools do.<br/>

&lt;&lt; ,I just got a book on unschooling but haven&#39;t had time to read through it <br/>
yet.. . . . .Sorry about all the questions,I just want to know exactly what <br/>
all of you here do with your kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just noticed you said you have a book but haven&#39;t read it yet.  You should <br/>
read it!  Otherwise we end up writing everthing that&#39;s already in your book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you go to the movies,do you make them tell about the story line or <br/>
something?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want to teach them to hate movies you might want to do that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the course of everyday real life people DO talk about movies though, and <br/>
that will happen.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people take their kids out of school, but they take the school home <br/>
with them.<br/>

  The first unschooling book I ever read was Mary Griffith&#39;s The Unschooling <br/>
Handbook. IMO, it&#39;s a great introduction to unschooling. It also features <br/>
antidotes by unschooling families about their days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Nicole!  Do you see how discussing a movie you watched with your kids <br/>
is really different than &quot;making them&quot; tell you the &quot;story line&quot;?  The <br/>
former is natural and just what friends do when they see an interesting <br/>
movie; the latter is testing.  I have always noticed that my son resists <br/>
questions that are asked of him to test what he knows, and rightly <br/>
so.  There&#39;s an ulterior this-is-good-for-you intent that goes along with <br/>
such questioning, and kids can see right through it.  If you  &quot;make&quot; them <br/>
tell you the story line of a movie, as though you want to make sure they <br/>
got out of it what YOU meant for them to get out of it, they will more than <br/>
likely not want to participate with you in these discussions.  It&#39;s just <br/>
not real life, which is what unschooling hopefully is.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>

Please forgive me, Amy (I just couldn&#39;t resist this one).<br/>
