<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t allow unguided TV watching for my children.  They mostly watch<br/>
&gt; PBS kids and Nick Jr. shows.  If there are other shows on that we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; consider harmful, they can see them - Megan watched Modern Masters on<br/>
&gt; HGTV last night.  I don&#39;t let her watch much Carol Duvall though since<br/>
&gt; Carol is such a &quot;poor, incompetent me&quot; person (or was the last time I<br/>
&gt; watched it).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. DH&#39;s grandma raved about this woman so I checked it out when we<br/>
had DirecTV. She does the &quot;oh, *I* would never be able to do that, you&#39;re<br/>
so talented&quot; spiel. I think she means it as a compliment to the other<br/>
person but it comes out as a put down of herself. She really could be a<br/>
good role model if she allowed herself to be; she does seem to have talent<br/>
and she come across as such a nice person.<br/>
