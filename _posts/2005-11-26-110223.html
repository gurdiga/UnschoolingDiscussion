<div id="ygrps-yiv-360437891">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group and our family is pretty new to homeschooling <br/>
and unschooling as a means of education. My kids have actually <br/>
dragged me into this method of learning kicking and screaming (sort <br/>
of). I wanted to work, earn money, buy better opportunities! We have <br/>
17/g & a 9/b. <br/>
<br/>
For our daughter, her grades began plummeting in her 7th year; as <br/>
did her spirit. She ended up grounded and with priviledges taken <br/>
away for half the year, each year. I&#39;d notice a change in her <br/>
attitude around the 3rd week of September and her attitude got <br/>
increasingly worse throughout the school year. You&#39;d think I&#39;d get <br/>
it, but alas... <br/>
<br/>
As for our son, during the last semester of 2nd grade we knew <br/>
something was wrong in his public education, but we didn&#39;t know <br/>
what. He wasn&#39;t sleeping well, was very anxious at bed time; he&#39;d <br/>
worry about so many things. We know/knew he&#39;s a very sensative <br/>
child, but this was absurd! Though we tried, we couldn&#39;t see what <br/>
was really wrong. Where was all of this anxiety coming from? <br/>
<br/>
We visted therapists. After last year, I finally threw my hands into <br/>
the air and said &#39;that&#39;s it, no more public school - period.&#39; The <br/>
transition has been tough. Our son we found out through testing is <br/>
mildly dyslexic. Both our children are above their grade level <br/>
intellectually and were not only bored half to death, but also felt <br/>
left out, overlooked, different.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s our own fault I realize. I never like school, why would they? <br/>
Since our kids were born, we&#39;ve always tried to show them what <br/>
wonders await them in the arts, sciences, literature, open thought, <br/>
etc. <br/>
<br/>
We started out homeschooling because in this area of the country, <br/>
there is only homeschooling. Its only been through links like <br/>
Sandra&#39;s that I&#39;ve found where we fit in this whole education <br/>
odyssey. It&#39;s scary, and we do it one day at a time, because the <br/>
alternatives are unacceptable for our family. We are still learning.</div>

for, or was it her broken spirit (&quot;her attitude got increasingly <br/>
worse&quot;)?  I&#39;m sensitive to what you wrote because as a teenager I went <br/>
through a similar downward spiral in school and in happiness and was <br/>
similarly punished.<br/>
I believe you said she was 17yo- which means there isn&#39;t a whole lot <br/>
of time left to repair your relationship, and if I were you that would <br/>

Has she (or have you) read The Teenage Liberation Handbook?  <br/>

I think it&#39;s about taking ownership for your choices.  When you <br/>
implement something in your home (e.g. grounding a child) those events <br/>
don&#39;t just happen, they happen because of your choices and your follow <br/>
through.<br/>

people read for two weeks.   If you didn&#39;t get a &quot;welcome to the list&quot; e-mail that <br/>
said that, please let us know so we can remedy that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the least bit offended, and I&#39;m sorry you seem to have been.    The <br/>
ideas are for discussing.   The discussion can help you change if you let it <br/>
wash over you and think about it instead of resisting it.<br/>

been in my experience.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How would you think it&#39;s right if it&#39;s hard and not fun?   If unschooling <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel good to you, don&#39;t do it.   It won&#39;t work.   If you&#39;re doing what <br/>
you don&#39;t want to do, don&#39;t.   It won&#39;t work.    We can probably help you enjoy <br/>
unschooling and find the ease and the fun, if you want to.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m supposed to be guiding - really need.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But if you live lightly and openly, you won&#39;t need to find out what they <br/>
really need.   If you give them the freedom to pick and choose and explore and <br/>
inquire, THEY can find out what they really need.   You don&#39;t need to figure out <br/>
what they really need to eat,    you just need to make a variety of foods <br/>
available and let them choose what they need.   Same with learning anything.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You used &quot;she&quot; as the subject of that sentence, as though she did<br/>

the mom, right?-=-<br/>
-=-How would &#39;we grounded her&#39; sound different? How can I take<br/>
blockages out that I don&#39;t know exist?<br/>
<br/>
Keith was in a car accident once.   He was asleep in the front seat, not <br/>
driving, not awake.   The mother of the woman who was driving called me and it was <br/>
clear from the questions she was asking that she thought Keith had been <br/>
driving.    I said no, no--MARGARET was driving.   I heard Margaret tell the story <br/>
a few days later, and she said &quot;The car wrecked.&quot;    Had she said &quot;I wrecked <br/>
the car,&quot; even her own mother would have gotten the picture. &lt;g&gt;   By making <br/>
the car the subject of that statement, the performer of the action, Margaret <br/>
dodged confronting and admitting her own part in what happened.   &quot;I wrecked the <br/>
car.&quot;    The car didn&#39;t just wreck.<br/>
<br/>
And similarly, you told us that your daughter kept ending up grounded, and <br/>
losing privileges.<br/>
Your daughter didn&#39;t do that.   Those things weren&#39;t natural, inevitable <br/>
consequences.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you believe they were inevitable.   They were consequences <br/>
imposed by your or your husband or both.   And so when you&#39;re in a place (like <br/>
this list) where we&#39;re discussing changing from one way of thinking and seeing <br/>
and being to another, the clearer you can be with your thoughts and the way you <br/>
express them, the closer you&#39;ll be to a newer, better way.     The clearer you <br/>
are, the more clearly people can help you see the next stepping stone.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I thought, still think, as a diagnosis its<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling works the same with all kinds of kids.   The labels don&#39;t help.   <br/>
He will do better (though it&#39;s too late) without thinking there&#39;s something <br/>
wrong with him.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-As for that, some of my most favorite people in this world (past and<br/>
present) were diagnosed similarly.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I bet every single one of them would have been happier to have felt whole and <br/>
good and right instead of feeling &quot;diagnosed.&quot;<br/>

they &quot;hurt&quot; a bit, just breathe through them and try to consider them  <br/>
to whatever extent you can. It helps to make a conscious effort to  <br/>
imagine them being said by someone who is smiling gently and speaking  <br/>
sweetly - that really IS the reality, but the printed word hides that.<br/>
<br/>
It is really good that you said right out that you didn&#39;t understand  <br/>
what Sandra meant about the difference between saying, &quot;She got  <br/>
herself grounded,&quot; versus &quot;We grounded her.&quot; I think if you explore  <br/>
that question more deeply it might be a HUGE key for you - to amazing  <br/>
insights about alternative ways to &quot;see&quot; and think about your kids  <br/>
and their learning. I know that, for right now, it might appear to be  <br/>
some kind of nitpicking about languge - but you might just want to  <br/>
trust us, at least for the moment, that it is that kind of self- <br/>
examination that will jumpstart a whole new wonderful way of relating.<br/>

We&#39;re not offended. You came looking for unschooling help/advice/insight. We&#39;re trying to help you out. It&#39;s<br/>
best here (and in general!) not to take things too personally and to look at all advice objectively---look <br/>
at your life and your choices a bit more objectively too!<br/>

  My daughter with Asperger&#39;s has expressed the same sentiments, Honor.  I did everything I could to talk myself and her out of testing and a diagnosis because I didn&#39;t want to label her.  The trouble was, she kept telling me something was &quot;wrong&quot; with her and she wanted to find out what it was!  At age 12, she asked if there were any tests out there she could take to find out what was making her feel so different and possibly, depressed.  The dx has helped the whole family understand and support her to an even greater degree than before, but most of all it has helped her understand her own gifts and struggles and to accept herself.  Like you , we don&#39;t disclose often, and it is left up to her if and when we do.  I don&#39;t advise testing for everyone, but I do believe looking at each child as an individual is important, and sometimes testing is the right thing to do.  <br/>

talking about how his mother would ask for his advice but then not follow<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309468741">Our son seemed to see the diagnosis as a relief. His demeaner changed perceptively, his <br/>
shoulders lifted and he seemed to feel unburdened. He was, apparently, believing <br/>
something really was wrong with him (we were stunned and devestated to learn that he <br/>
felt this way about himself). <br/>
<br/>
Maybe its a flaw in me, but I don&#39;t see labels as &#39;something wrong&#39;, more of a way to see <br/>
how someone else might think, and process information. As a mom, I&#39;ve tried to cherish <br/>
my children the best way I know how, but if I don&#39;t know what makes their hearts fly, I <br/>
don&#39;t feel I can be as helpful to them on their journeys.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; But if you live lightly and openly, you won&#39;t need to find out what they <br/>
&gt; really need.   If you give them the freedom to pick and choose and explore and <br/>
&gt; inquire, THEY can find out what they really need.   You don&#39;t need to figure out <br/>
&gt; what they really need to eat,    you just need to make a variety of foods <br/>
&gt; available and let them choose what they need.   Same with learning anything.<br/>

&gt; Keith was in a car accident once.   He was asleep in the front seat, not <br/>
&gt; driving, not awake.   The mother of the woman who was driving called me and it was <br/>
&gt; clear from the questions she was asking that she thought Keith had been <br/>
&gt; driving.    I said no, no--MARGARET was driving.   I heard Margaret tell the story <br/>
&gt; a few days later, and she said &quot;The car wrecked.&quot;    Had she said &quot;I wrecked <br/>
&gt; the car,&quot; even her own mother would have gotten the picture. &lt;g&gt;   By making <br/>
&gt; the car the subject of that statement, the performer of the action, Margaret <br/>
&gt; dodged confronting and admitting her own part in what happened.   &quot;I wrecked the <br/>

<br/>
  Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s a very good question. I am not sure how to answer--as there are many ways I treat her differently than before.  Mostly, it&#39;s more acceptance of how she relates to the world, and a specific understanding of her confusion in the world. It&#39;s also knowing where to step in and assist and where to step back and let her figure things out on her own.  Before, I was in a constant state of parental confusion because I wasn&#39;t sure where the behaviors were coming from and why they were &quot;better&quot; on some days and &quot;worse&quot; on others. It can seem, to others, that people on the spectrum are being inconsiderate on purpose, when it is really just social or communication or sensory or anxiety issues.  I blamed myself for bad parenting when things were bad, and that, in turn, caused bad parenting. Now I can see the patterns to the behaviors much more clearly and react more appropriately. <br/>
  Because we went through the testing and the results together, we have a common framework to start our discussions when things aren&#39;t going well.  We can be proactive with issues, now that we know them specifically, by, say, talking about characters in books we read or movies we&#39;ve seen that have the same struggles, and how they worked through them or simply adapted and lived with them.  I also understand how difficult certain things really are for her, and I am much more likely to be there cheering her on when she decides to stretch herself.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess all in all, I am more understanding and more positive, less confrontational and impatient with her than before the diagnosis.  Maybe I could have come to the same place another way, eventually.  But, for us, the testing was a step in the right direction.  My daughter doesn&#39;t see the results as a label, but instead, as an explanation for behaviors that were strange and uncontrollable.  Now that she knows where they stem from, she can choose, throughout her life, whether to address them or not.  The results don&#39;t make us try to &quot;fix&quot; her, just understand and accept and dwell more on her unique abilities.  Because as she well knows, those of us with the greatest struggles also can have the greatest gifts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577006041">It can seem, to others, that people on the spectrum are being inconsiderate on purpose, when it is really just social or communication or sensory or anxiety issues.  I blamed myself for bad parenting when things were bad, and that, in turn, caused bad parenting. Now I can see the patterns to the behaviors much more clearly and react more appropriately. <br/>
<br/>
**********************************<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I can totally relate to this part of your post.  The parental confusion is a real problem.  Trying to differentiate where the behavior comes from is difficult with some children, and if you guess wrong, you might end up making bad parenting choices in the sense that you are trying to address the behavior without knowing what the need is.  And kids can&#39;t always articulate their need.  Behaviors can look like they are discipline problems, and if you are already unschooling, it can really be deflating.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a diagnosis is what tells you what the needs are.  And it can really affirm you as a parent so that you know its not necessarily your parenting that is the problem.  Then you can find better information on how to address the needs that are unique to the diagnosis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-912523320">Actually, we&#39;ve been working on our relationship all during these past years, but I knew <br/>
this year that if I didn&#39;t take make better choices for our lives, our relationship would <br/>
disintigrate to the point of non-existence. Sadly, I&#39;ve been in denial. <br/>
<br/>
When I looked back with honesty about when I began to notice we were loosing our <br/>
connection, I had to admit it really was about 4rth grade. We put her in a different school, <br/>
that was a little better, then changed to yet another school and she began to thrive again - <br/>
briefly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking back at the decisions I made and believe me, I ache. I was raised in poverty <br/>
both economically and emotionally. I thought I was doing what was best for her by <br/>
exposing her to the social atmosphere found in public schools. Letting her go were I <br/>
couldn&#39;t. It was wrong. All she really wanted was to be with me, but please understand, I <br/>
didn&#39;t think I could possibly be enough for her. <br/>
<br/>
Confronting what I consider now how I&#39;ve ignored her true needs, has been a painful, <br/>
embarrasing and shameful realization. When she was in my womb, I wanted her so very <br/>
much to love and cherish. And we did, for many years our learning, reading, exploring <br/>
music and cultures different than our own; that was our mainstay. My fears about not <br/>
being able to provide more for her and in truth, my husbands expectations, led me to <br/>
conclude that I needed to be in the job market. <br/>
<br/>
Last year, I finally decided to stop the insanity and do something drastic no matter what <br/>
the cost - take both of our children out of public schools. I was terrified, but convinced we <br/>
did not and should not have to lose our family to education. Fortunately, my husband was <br/>
very supportive and feels healing our family is of far more importance than our financial <br/>
income. No small thing for him either since his childhood home was similar to mine. (By <br/>
the way, our school district is considered one of the best in our area and the high school <br/>
touts its &#39;Blue Ribbon&#39; status far and wide. Needless to say we are surrounding by athletes, <br/>
and intense parental involvement in all things school related.)<br/>
<br/>
Seeing a psychologist who works with families like ours and understands so many of the <br/>
dynamics that enter into our decisions and not having to ever return to her high school, <br/>
our daughter&#39;s attitude and spirit seems to have helped her recapture something of her <br/>
younger years, a thoughtful, curious, creative and incredible human being. I&#39;m incredibly <br/>
grateful that she hasn&#39;t turned away from me, and that our relationship is showing signs <br/>
of healing, growth and forgiveness. <br/>

<br/>
I have a friend who has probably never been diagnosed Asperger&#39;s but I&#39;d bet <br/>
she would be.   Unfortunately she seems to see nothing wrong with herself <br/>
whatsoever.   She decided long ago that her parents were just mean and stupid and <br/>
that everyone around her is inferior to her and anyone who doesn&#39;t understand <br/>
her isn&#39;t worth messing with, and her solution to enteratining is to just <br/>
invite everyone she knows and let them sort it out.   So she invites sworn enemies <br/>
and stalker/stalkee   and newly divorced couples because she admits she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to figure out who not to invite, so she carefully invites <br/>
everyone.   If she realizes that someone has been invited without a <br/>
potentially-disasterous counterpart, she thinks she has been discourteous to the counterpart and <br/>
hunts him down.   <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem to be that she likes the fireworks or the turned-down invit<br/>
ations.   She just doesn&#39;t know how else to &quot;be fair.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
It might do her some good to consider Asperger&#39;s because she might think that <br/>
maybe, just maybe, there are others perceiving an aspect of the world that <br/>
she&#39;s blind to.   Maybe they&#39;re really not just stupid, and maybe her &quot;fairness&quot; <br/>
and oblivion aren&#39;t virtues.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer she married one of my best friends, but that&#39;s just how life jumps up <br/>
and bites you sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a balance between thinking something&#39;s wrong and realizing that it&#39;s <br/>
just an array of points on the scales of social skill/awareness, interpersonal <br/>
intelligence, capacity for input before sleep is required, whatever-all, is the <br/>
ideal.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one reason I love (LOVE) to look at unschooling and life in the light <br/>
of Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligence Theory.   Some people can&#39;t sing, but <br/>
that&#39;s okay--they can probably remember historical dates and names, and do word <br/>
puzzles, and cook.   Some can&#39;t cook, but can probably play tennis and nurse <br/>
wounded birds and fix bikes.   Some can&#39;t fix bikes, but...    well...    they can <br/>
do something else cool. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need to know whether my kids will ever want to fix bikes.   They <br/>
haven&#39;t yet but might still.   There are things they wanted to do today, and I <br/>
helped each one of them a time or two, and checked on them between times, and <br/>
have been ordering Christmas gifts I think they&#39;ll like and use.   I don&#39;t need <br/>
to know more, and they don&#39;t need to know more than they know right now.   I <br/>
can hear Holly laughing as she&#39;s talking to Marty in the room above me.   Kirby <br/>
was here after work for several hours, but is now visiting friends to play <br/>
XBox.   They&#39;re busy and happy and that means they&#39;re learning.<br/>

Sandra&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
No, because I did know of everything else first.  I had my children in a magnet school from k-3 that professed the theory of multiple intelligences. So I read, at that time (and prior to that, in college) all I could find on the theory, though none of the teachers apparently did ;)  I felt, from the time my daughter was two, that she processed the world differently than most children(I had been an early childhood teacher for 10 years prior to her birth, and I KNEW all kids were different)-- that she was truly &quot;misunderstanding&quot; the world.  <br/>
<br/>
The school considered her typical because she stayed on grade level (though I could see her struggling and hating the environment and becoming seriously depressed by the age of 8 due to social and organizational issues, mostly.)  They refused to listen to my concerns.  Her pediatrician never felt there was any real &quot;problem,&quot;either.  <br/>
<br/>
We began relaxed homeschooling then, with a continual move toward unschooling.  By age 11, things were getting rough again, emotionally, for my daughter, (I have discovered her difficulties become more intense at each developmental milestone.) As I became more interested in unschooling, I began emailing lists and private persons, asking advise on unschooling and psychological testing, etc. because I just didn&#39;t think labeling was a good thing and I couldn&#39;t come to terms with what to do. I didn&#39;t get much response at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, I decided to just listen to my daughter.  And, at age 12, she definitely articulated her need for an explanation for how she could try SO hard, but just not &quot;get&quot; how to fit in, and why things that came so easily to most other children were so difficult or impossible for her. She also developed some facial ticks, for which we could find no medical explanation. We chose, together, to get her tested, because we were looking for relief from the stress and because she trusted me enough to ask for something as bizarre to our lives as a test.  <br/>
<br/>
Believe me, there is nothing worse than sitting in a doctor&#39;s office, hearing a person who knows nothing of your daughter&#39;s unique specialness, list what is &quot;wrong&quot; with her.  But, my daughter, as I said before seemed relieved--like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders--when we reviewed the findings, together.  And, though I hated the doctor&#39;s arrogance at the time, he was very supportive of not attending school, and did give me some decent advise about handling my daughter&#39;s complexities.  He didn&#39;t push medications, as I had feared. But instead, only offered us the option to consider them under certain circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who really KNOW their children, really KNOW when something is amiss.  That is how I felt--like there was an elephant in the room that no one but my daughter and the 3 other people in her immediate family would acknowledge.  Parents who really KNOW their children also listen and act when their children ask for help.  Since the diagnosis, I feel as if I know my daughter even better than before--like she and I and her sister and her father have more pieces of the puzzle that is her.  Understanding how her mind works has helped us understand our own minds better, too.  It has made us all more empathetic, compassionate, and self-evaluative. And at 14, she knows too, that she has parents who, when she opens herself up to them, will help her through her pain, by taking her out of school, or taking her in for testing, or taking her wherever she needs to be taken.  <br/>
<br/>
As for unschooling, the diagnosis has helped make that work better,too-- simply because understanding your child to a greater degree can only enrich your relationship with him/her. And I believe that is what unschooling is really about.<br/>

RECOMMENDED he be pulled from school.  He had never had any problems <br/>
in school--in fact he excelled (they were talking &quot;Gifted and <br/>
Talented&quot;) and was well liked by kids and teachers alike.  Granted <br/>
when he came home, it was like a tornado set down in the middle of <br/>
the house and he never saw the point of school in general.  She <br/>
also &quot;diagnosed&quot; him as having Sensory Integration Dysfunction <br/>
(which many autistic people also experience) which was helpful in <br/>
explaining some of his behaviors (Why does he chew holes in his <br/>
shirts? etc.)  I never treated him differently as a result of that <br/>
label, and don&#39;t think of it at all.  (I don&#39;t mean to compare it to <br/>
Asperger&#39;s)  <br/>
<br/>
My point is that though they may be few and far between, there are <br/>
some great therapists.  There are even some that advocate <br/>
home/unschooling.  <br/>
