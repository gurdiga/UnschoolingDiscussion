intelligence.<br/>
I don&#39;t even know how anyone could prove truth to the 34 million in lost<br/>

Did he not sign it because he didn&#39;t show up for work? Did he disagree with<br/>
the plan? Is this information coming from a credible source?<br/>
Do you know George Bush&#39;s friend that bailed out George W.? Why would<br/>
someone want to bail out a son of a friend unless they thought they were<br/>
getting some sort of deal? My dad has some wealthy friends, and although<br/>
they like my dad, they don&#39;t have any interest in spreading that wealth my<br/>
way,or bailing me out when I need it.<br/>
I do prefer politicians that have some real business experience, not just<br/>
learned theories even if the experience is considered a failure, because<br/>
people grow and learn from &quot;failing&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825125023">*SOME* people grow and learn, others tread water.  It would seem that we are<br/>
getting a recycled Gulf War, all the same players, all the same reasons.<br/>
Only difference would be that this time the fallout of the money brokers/oil<br/>
barrons&#39; gread is that death has appeared on our doorstep.<br/>
