<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951327249">Our day has finally come! We&#39;re moving tomorrow. Christopher is the <br/>
only one that is not nervous, he&#39;s ready to go. It&#39;s amazing how much <br/>

amazing how much we as parents are changing....slowly&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Just wanted to say thank-you to everyone on the list for all of your <br/>
wisdom and interesting conversations. We&#39;re going to take a break now <br/>
and regroup as a family and hope to be back sometime late August.<br/>

One last thing before I do go and the subject gets old. I wanted to <br/>
apologize for posting a link to a RUL. For the part I was on there, I <br/>
did not see no dislike of this list or of Sandra. Had I known the <br/>
story or had seen what went on before, I would have never posted the <br/>
link that caused so much nonsense. I love this list and the people <br/>
here and would never want anything bad to be said about either. For <br/>
those that are still mailing me, putting blame on me for all of this <br/>
starting, please realize that I wouldn&#39;t be on RUL, defending Sandra <br/>
nor this list if I didn&#39;t feel so strongly about them, I just<br/>
wouldn&#39;t waste my time. <br/>
<br/>
Have a nice summer everyone!<br/>

YIKES! <br/>
I didn&#39;t think it was a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, right after you posted that here, I posted it on Always Learning <br/>
because someone asked about other lists.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone from this list has been blaming Kim for anything, please don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the move goes well, Kim!!  We&#39;ll see you here when you&#39;re settled.<br/>
