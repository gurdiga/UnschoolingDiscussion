<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839950496">I don&#39;t know much about it, but aren&#39;t feral children usually alone?  The<br/>
example used was of two children who came up with their own language, I<br/>
think (not that they were feral, they obviously weren&#39;t).  That made me<br/>
wonder, is a possible reason feral children don&#39;t develop language<br/>
because there is no one to talk to.  <br/>
