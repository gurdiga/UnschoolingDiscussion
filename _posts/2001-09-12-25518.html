<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955036845"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;What would be a good response to the testing question???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Testing is probably useful in classes of 20 - 30 kids.  How can the teacher <br/>
&gt; possibly know who &quot;got it&quot; and who didn&#39;t.  We *know* what our kids &quot;get&quot; <br/>
&gt; and know because they&#39;re with us so much.  The homeschoolers I know who do <br/>
&gt; use testing say that it only confirms what they knew anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Tia... I knew this.  It was just one of those moments when you&#39;re under <br/>
attack from someone who doesn&#39;t understand and it&#39;s been a long week and your <br/>
brain has turned to temporary mush... not like that ever happens to anyone <br/>
else, right??  This is a Jeanmarie thing, huh?<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll print this out and keep it in my desk for the next time.<br/>
