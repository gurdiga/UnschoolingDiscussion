<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; Tell Dylan I agree with him, he should leave something for the wee <br/>
&gt; one who <br/>
&gt; lives in his tree. I recommend something warm, it may have been <br/>
&gt; years since <br/>
&gt; someone left something soft and fluffy for him to wrap up in. Of <br/>
&gt; course the <br/>
&gt; honey and maybe some nuts. An oatmeal cake would be nice too. <br/>
&gt; Homemade bread <br/>
&gt; and a bit of butter and/or cheese. Something shiny and new, he may <br/>
&gt; not have <br/>
&gt; had anything new, all his own, for a long time. A shiny brand new <br/>
&gt; penny, or <br/>
&gt; maybe a pretty bead? Do you know about those little tiny glass <br/>
&gt; beads? (seed <br/>
&gt; beads) Have Dylan make a small necklace out of some. Don&#39;t forget to <br/>
&gt; leave <br/>
&gt; something at Samhain!<br/>
