<div id="ygrps-yiv-942449609">All of you got these when you subscribed to the list, but once in a <br/>
while I like to send them to the list so that we can all be reminded of <br/>
them. Also, we occasionally modify them, so they may not be quite the <br/>
same as when you first joined, so please do read them over. If you have <br/>
questions or comments, you can write directly to the list owners, but <br/>
please refrain from responding on the list itself. Thank you.<br/>

UnschoolingDiscussion Posting Policies<br/>
<br/>
Please read carefully BEFORE posting on the list.<br/>
<br/>
It is our sincere wish to provide a forum for those seeking to deepen <br/>
their<br/>
understanding of the unschooling philosophy. The primary purpose of this<br/>
list is to encourage the critical examination of ideas, beliefs and<br/>
viewpoints.<br/>
<br/>
Questioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very uncomfortable <br/>
and<br/>
sometimes responses to that process can stand in the way of people <br/>
getting<br/>
what they need out of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, we offer the following to help our members get the<br/>
most from the list:<br/>
<br/>
1. We suggest that you read for at least a couple of weeks before <br/>
posting. Spend that<br/>
time getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members. This will help you <br/>
decide if this list is worth<br/>
  your time or whether some other list might be more useful to you in <br/>
meeting your needs.<br/>
<br/>
2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity <br/>
to<br/>
critically examine your own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not the<br/>
person with whom you are disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to <br/>
public<br/>
examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute<br/>
positively to the unschooling discussion or help people understand<br/>
unschooling better. For example:<br/>
<br/>
    * Posts should add something to the discussion, not just say things <br/>
like,<br/>
&quot;Me too,&quot; or &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    * This list is international. State specific questions are best <br/>
answered<br/>
elsewhere. (Try <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/">http://www.unschooling.com/</a> click &quot;Message Boards&quot; then<br/>
&quot;Across the Continent, Around the World&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
    * This list&#39;s focus is learning through unschooling, not <br/>
homeschooling<br/>
politics. Discussions of legislative and legal issues can be found at<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/forum">http://www.nhen.org/forum</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
    * List members should refrain from meta-discussion, that is, <br/>
commenting or<br/>
complaining about a discussion instead of contributing to it. Examples <br/>
of<br/>
meta-discussion are: &quot;This list is not very friendly.&quot; &quot;That response <br/>
seemed<br/>
overly defensive.&quot; &quot;Why do my posts get criticized and not others?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6. Avoid using loaded terminology. For instance, &quot;If you have no TV<br/>
restrictions why don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?&quot; will get you <br/>
more<br/>
useful responses than, &quot;I don&#39;t see how your kids learn anything if all <br/>
they<br/>
ever do is sit around like zombies watching unlimited TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
7. It is not useful to inform the list that you believe someone else is<br/>
being rude or discourteous; please trust the rest of the list to <br/>
recognize<br/>
rudeness for themselves. Saying, &quot;Jane was rude to me,&quot; just bogs down <br/>
the<br/>
list. It is also a waste of everyone&#39;s time when participants attempt to<br/>
correct or improve other list members&#39; manners. It never works and <br/>
always<br/>
disrupts the list. Avoid<br/>
statements such as: &quot;Jane, here is my suggestion of how you could write <br/>
more<br/>
nicely so people wouldn&#39;t think you are being rude.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
8. Our brains automatically supply a &quot;tone&quot; to posts as we read. It can <br/>
be<br/>
helpful to imagine your best friend speaking the words you are reading, <br/>
in<br/>
the gentlest, most well-meaning tone you can imagine. It is <br/>
unacceptable to<br/>
attack the &quot;tone&quot; of the list or to make generalizations about it. &quot;I&#39;ve<br/>
been on many other lists and this one is the rudest I&#39;ve seen,&quot; would be<br/>
unacceptable. Instead, attempt to create a positive, helpful tone with <br/>
your<br/>
own posts by setting the example you hope others will follow.<br/>
<br/>
9. Envision every post and response as a dish at a potluck dinner. You <br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
love every dish at a potluck any more than you will love every poster&#39;s<br/>
style of help. But a dish/post may be exactly what someone else needs. <br/>
If<br/>
you don&#39;t like a certain list member&#39;s offerings, skip them and<br/>
leave them for others.<br/>
<br/>
10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we <br/>
often<br/>
don&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of our<br/>
conversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, without body<br/>
language or inflection, all we have to go on are your words and they <br/>
should<br/>
say what you mean. If you say, for example, you &quot;never&quot; do something, it<br/>
should not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking to<br/>
deepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do that, <br/>
all<br/>
new list members are initially moderated to prevent spamming and catch <br/>
posts<br/>
that could disrupt the list. People will also be moderated if they <br/>
disrupt<br/>
the usefulness of the list. Potentially disruptive posts will be <br/>
returned<br/>
for revision.<br/>
