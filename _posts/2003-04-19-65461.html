<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727498356">A bit overwhelmed by the volume, but loving it here!<br/>
<br/>
The snip below (I think I&#39;m up to Wednesday&#39;s messages now) is what I&#39;m<br/>
reasponding/reacting to at the moment.  We have a lot of &quot;you&#39;re stuck<br/>
with us&quot; and &quot;yes I am your real mom, although I&#39;m not your birth mom&quot;<br/>
moments.  Puberty is coming on strong, and dh & I are both having<br/>
significant health things at the moment...  Change - and potential<br/>
change - can be hard for some of us to live with.<br/>
<br/>
Youngest, and only still at home, child is the only one of our  4 who&#39;s<br/>
never gone to school.  She&#39;s 10 now.  Her middle sibs left the system @<br/>
middle school, the oldest went all the way through (OT/brushing helped<br/>
him!).  Oh, she did go to a &#39;therapeutic&#39; preschool part time for a<br/>
while, I went with her at first -- the goal there was to help her<br/>
learn/experience that I interacted with her differently than the<br/>
teachers did, and that I also interacted with her differently than I did<br/>
with the other kids.  Eventually I started leaving her there (at first<br/>
just going to another room for a few minutes), so she could grow an<br/>
understanding that I could be out of sight and she could know where was,<br/>
and that I would come back.  &lt;sigh&gt;  She joined us before she was 2, we<br/>
don&#39;t know a lot about her time before that but we were at least family<br/>
#6 for her.<br/>
<br/>
What an adventure life is!  Thanks, everyone!<br/>

kids who&#39;ve done both.  Trapping and holding them too hard isn&#39;t guaranteed <br/>

was testing to see if he was going to be sent away yet again.  I thought<br/>
that was a wonderful way to reassure him.<br/>
