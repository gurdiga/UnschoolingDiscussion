<div id="ygrps-yiv-305661529">did you ever hear about the distilled water fad, that went through the <br/>
health food-iacs culture not all that long ago? The advice was, drink only <br/>
distilled water, until they discovered that doing so saps the cells of all <br/>
their electrolytes and salts, causing an imbalance that could kill you.<br/>
<br/>
Man, the things that are put out there as facts.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidC whose preferred liquid is WATER. Well Water. mmmmm. Deep <br/>
Subject.<br/>

<br/>
  If kids will  get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;liquid into them in ANY way, it&#39;s good.<br/>
&gt;Also just noticed some brilliant scientist said it seemed that tea and <br/>
&gt;coffee<br/>
&gt;  DID qualify as &quot;liquids.&quot;    Yeah, DUH.  I&#39;ve been amused  and disgusted<br/>
&gt;through these last few water-worshipping years about how much  water people <br/>
&gt;were<br/>
&gt;supposed to drink (also a &quot;truth&quot; rescinded lately) and they&#39;d  say &quot;tea<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t count.&quot;   Tea is just water that leaves soaked  in.  Puhleeeze.   <br/>
&gt;People<br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t be so gullible, and maybe  scientists are lately as gullible and<br/>
&gt;misguided as anyone.<br/>
