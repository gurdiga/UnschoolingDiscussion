<div id="ygrps-yiv-259605120">Hey a Kansas unschooler! I wonder how many more are on the list. We live <br/>
about 60 miles from Wichita. We unschool four here ages 17, 15, 13, 11. We <br/>
are the only unschoolers I know of in our area, but there may be others that <br/>
I do not know about. <br/>
<br/>
Since I do not live around Topeka I do not know about the unschooling support <br/>
groups, but I do know that there are none in my area. All the groups here <br/>
require the statement of Faith too and one of the groups gets a bit too pushy <br/>
on curriculum choices. We do not belong to either group. I can not believe <br/>
that a support would require you to test your children. That is crazy. <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know you better. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521229048">HeHeHe! I knew there had to be at least one more unschooling family in this <br/>
state! :o) Anyway... you live near Wichita? My dear husband grew up in and <br/>
around there and he graduated from Dexter Ks, highschool! And I spent most of <br/>
my summers in Lindsborg, Hutch, and Mcpherson...!!! I still have family in <br/>
that area and some in Haysville, and my brother-in-law and his wife live in <br/>
Stafford. ~Just had to give my family tree! :o) And the search for a group <br/>
goes onnnnnnn! Have a great day! <br/>
