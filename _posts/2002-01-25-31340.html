I think there&#39;s something going on that has nothing to do with the ISP you are using. I have experienced problems with several lists I&#39;m on as well as this one (occasionally). Cindy, didn&#39;t you post something one time about how or rather, why these things happen? I can&#39;t remember the details, but you had a good explanation as I recall.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200297573">I can&#39;t speak for any but myself but . . . <br/>
 I feel like I&#39;m living in a group commune.  There are now six adults <br/>
here that span three generations.  There is only 1 &#39;child&#39; left and <br/>
he sometimes seems to have a few too many parents.  But it all works <br/>
out pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel went to a friends house last night and, well lets just say <br/>
they are the opposite of what a good family should be and leave it at <br/>
that.  I asked her if she realized how much better her life is when <br/>
she got home.  She does.  We talked about how the way the dad is <br/>
handling the current situation is only making it worse.  At 16 she <br/>
understands more about human nature than many adults I know.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is Jenni who is reacting to the &quot;socialization&quot; question <br/>
in a rather interesting manner. Her current mantra is &quot;Socialization, <br/>
schmocialization, who needs it?  I&#39;m gonna be a hermit and read for <br/>
the rest of my life!&quot; This was prompted by the mother in the above <br/>
named family who told her that she should get out there and mingle <br/>
more.  <br/>
<br/>
It is interesting around here!  We took an exchange student this year <br/>
too so we have that added dynamic.  Sometimes it feels like a college <br/>
dorm here.  So many people, so many interests, such interesting <br/>
discussion.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t speak for any but myself but . . .<br/>
&gt;  I feel like I&#39;m living in a group commune.  There are now six adults<br/>
&gt; here that span three generations.  There is only 1 &#39;child&#39; left and<br/>
&gt; he sometimes seems to have a few too many parents.  But it all works<br/>
&gt; out pretty well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rachel went to a friends house last night and, well lets just say<br/>
&gt; they are the opposite of what a good family should be and leave it at<br/>
&gt; that.  I asked her if she realized how much better her life is when<br/>
&gt; she got home.  She does.  We talked about how the way the dad is<br/>
&gt; handling the current situation is only making it worse.  At 16 she<br/>
&gt; understands more about human nature than many adults I know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then there is Jenni who is reacting to the &quot;socialization&quot; question<br/>
&gt; in a rather interesting manner. Her current mantra is &quot;Socialization,<br/>
&gt; schmocialization, who needs it?  I&#39;m gonna be a hermit and read for<br/>
&gt; the rest of my life!&quot; This was prompted by the mother in the above<br/>
&gt; named family who told her that she should get out there and mingle<br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is interesting around here!  We took an exchange student this year<br/>
&gt; too so we have that added dynamic.  Sometimes it feels like a college<br/>
&gt; dorm here.  So many people, so many interests, such interesting<br/>
&gt; discussion.<br/>

my children but I find the Gesell Institute&#39;s books on the younger ones<br/>
helpful.  It lets me know that what they are doing is a normal developmental<br/>
stage.  I think it could be harder to find good teen development books<br/>
since that seems to be a time in our children&#39;s lives which gets such<br/>
bad press.<br/>

Nah--it&#39;s not hard to find good teen books.  Lots of them out there.<br/>
Unfortunately, many are geared to discussing *school* issues, though.<br/>

Each child is different but overall, my experience with teens is that a hs&#39;ed teen is more calm, more mature in *all* aspects of life, and is 99% of the time a joy to be with. Then, that one percent... that&#39;s the hormonal time that you can do nothing about except to stay out of their way!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350987478">The bottomline, IMHO, with teens is to recognize going into it that there is<br/>
no such thing as &quot;what to expect&quot; or &quot;normal developmental stages&quot; or<br/>
anything else.  This is the stage in your child&#39;s life when they and their<br/>
bodies become totally individual.  There are absolutely no two alike at any<br/>
given &quot;stage&quot; or even at any given hour, day or week.  This is the time when<br/>
they really start to unfurl their wings and &quot;test&quot; the boundaries.  Some are<br/>
going to just glide on through all the physical and emotional changes going<br/>
on in their bodies and minds and others are going to struggle and fight<br/>
their way through this time.<br/>
<br/>
Mom needs a good shoulder to lean on, a readily available safety net to<br/>
catch them if they fall and lots and lots of patience.<br/>
<br/>
I personally feel that unschooling kidlets have an advantage.  They don&#39;t<br/>
spend 8 hours aday with the constant peer pressure.  They have had the<br/>
opportunity to learn how to make decisions, to form their own set of values<br/>
and, the most important part IMNSHO, already know that they are an equal and<br/>
valued member of their family, not &quot;just a kid.&quot;<br/>
