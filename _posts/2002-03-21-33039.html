<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644476450"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;And, communication doesn&#39;t take the spoken or written word nor the<br/>
&gt;understanding of the definition of words.  I lived for several months in<br/>
&gt;Baja without the benefit of any knowledge of the Spanish language.  Nor did<br/>
&gt;anyone speak English in the villages I lived in.  We got along quite nicely<br/>
&gt;and managed to &quot;communicate&quot; quite well.<br/>

There are so many forms of communication that go outside of language. <br/>
Maybe thats why I find language so confining. It is limited.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it is all that we have in this digital forum. But, <br/>
thankfully, not all that we have in life.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to define a word so that it fits into *insert person of choice <br/>
here* idea will only frustrate everyone since that person of choice is <br/>
different for all.<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK, Holt coined the term and GWS people worked the closest with him. <br/>
Everyone else after that is just a follower. If you want to form your own <br/>
club, find your own word. Otherwise, its not a good idea to put people <br/>
down for their opinions.<br/>
<br/>
For years I ran a BBS in Germany. My colleagues spoke a little English at <br/>
first, and then learned more. Eventually they even became proficient at <br/>
slang. What a wonderful learning experience for all.. what a wonderful <br/>
way to be so adaptable and not so angry at having to own words.<br/>
