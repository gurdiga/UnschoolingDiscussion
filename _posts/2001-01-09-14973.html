<br>There&#39;s probably some merit to this but, otoh, the reason some of us started <br>hsing (and have ending up doing a sort of blended unschooling sort of on good <br>days and we&#39;ll see how things change over time!) is that the ps system was <br>unable to meet our gifted kids&#39; needs. &nbsp;We have discovered many other good <br>things about hsing, but g/t issues were the beginning of the problem with ps. <br>&nbsp;Some kids really are g/t and some aren&#39;t and there&#39;s no use comparing them <br>or denying either one exists.

Oh, I definitely agree with you, Nance, and there will be some kids who are never considered gifted no matter how they are schooled. My point was just that maybe more kids would be allowed to explore their true potential and more might be considered gifted if more were homeschooled.<br>
