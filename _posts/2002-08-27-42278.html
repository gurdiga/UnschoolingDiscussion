great time using Mad Libs.  Parts of speech is definitely a bonus, but they <br/>
are so much fun, who cares?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My kids love Mad Libs. I bought a bunch of them a few years ago, I think at a <br/>
Target store.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372454098">To be, or not to twirl, -- that is the guitar;<br/>
Whether &#39;tis nobler in the nose to suffer<br/>
The slings and fish of giggling fortune,<br/>
Or to take shoes against a sea of whiskers,<br/>
And by singing end them. To die, -- to dance, -- <br/>
No more; and by a dance to say we end <br/>
The dog and the forty-five natural shocks <br/>
That flesh is cousin to,-- &#39;tis a Toronto <br/>
cooly to be wish&#39;d. To die, --- to dance,-- <br/>
To dance! perchance to grind! ay, there&#39;s the truck; <br/>
For in that dance of death what flowers may come <br/>
When we have smelled off this lovely coil, <br/>
Must give us garden.... <br/>

find them where you are, let me know, I will be glad to send you some.<br/>
