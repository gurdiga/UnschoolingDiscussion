<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932309233">OK. It has been about 3 months since we stopped limiting Jason&#39;s (6 yo) junk food. I want to say<br/>
up front that I have not given up...I do believe that this will work. But I really could <br/>
use some advice here. I honestly felt pretty good about giving up this restriction...<br/>
Jason has always been a picky eater but we have never been overly controlling about<br/>
food (we never forced him to eat what he did not like or force him to eat certain amounts).<br/>
But we did limit junk food. I expected binging which is what we got. What I did not expect<br/>
was for him to start eating less healthy food. He used to always eat a great breakfast...<br/>
french toast, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, lots of options. Now he rarely eats<br/>
breakfast or just eats fruit chews or gold fish. Most days he eats maybe half a peanut<br/>
and jelly sandwich and the rest junk...chips, candy, ice cream etc. He used to eat<br/>
apples, nectarines, grapes, peaches, pears...maybe once a week he will eat 1 piece of<br/>
fruit. There were a couple of days where I did plead with him to eat *something*<br/>
nutritious...I still gave him the option, but really put on the pressure...not <br/>
overly proud of it but it was killing me.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I have been talking with him about trying to eat more healthy food...not<br/>
limiting junk food. I have told him that I have no problem with him eating as much<br/>
junk food as he wants, as long as he eats *some* healthy food. I have still left<br/>
it up to him, but he knows that this is an issue with me. Which is maybe why he<br/>
still hasn&#39;t stopped the binging? My biggest problem is that his choices of eating<br/>
terribly have resulted in him being difficult to be around. He is a very bouncy<br/>
boy to begin with...with a diet of mostly sugar he bounces off the walls somedays.<br/>
It makes it hard for him to go to sleep and since we don&#39;t *make* him go to sleep<br/>
he has been staying up until 11 or 12. Then the next day he is whiney and cranky<br/>
and generally hard to deal with. <br/>
<br/>
So what exactly are the natural consequences of eating unhealthily? Mostly what I<br/>
have seen is crankiness, general disagreeableness, difficulty going to sleep and <br/>
I am the one having to deal with it. I will admit that I am at a loss on how <br/>
exactly to handle this...do I point it out (which seems to be creating another power<br/>
 struggle...the only difference is that I am not making him listen to me, he still <br/>
gets to choose but he definitely knows that I am not happy). Do I just go about like <br/>
I don&#39;t care (which is not the truth)? How can I change my attitude about this...I need <br/>
fresh perspective....dh is ready to call this a failure. He is starting to lose<br/>
patience with Jason about it.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, I have seen small signs of improvement...he has turned down cake. He did not<br/>
eat all his halloween candy. If Kyle gets candy, Jason does not always beg for some<br/>
too. Maybe I have just not let it go long enough? Or maybe I am doing something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
And the reason that I am not stopping this experiment (as dh calls it) is because I told<br/>
Jason that I wouldn&#39;t and I have seen that it works great for Kyle (almost 3). He<br/>
definitely eats more junk food, but he still eats a varied diet and will ask for healthy<br/>
food when he wants it. He can drink soda, but his drink of choice is choc milk. I am<br/>
very pleasantly surprised at how well Kyle has been moderating himself and kicking myself<br/>
for how we handled Jason...we had not put any restrictions on him until he was around 2.5<br/>
or 3 yo...now we are trying to undo what 3 years of limitations has created...<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369365210">Minor, but not so minor:<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as &quot;unschooling.&quot;  <br/>
There are similarities, but trusting a child to choose good foods isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When Keith and I still expected our kids would go to school &quot;on schedule,&quot; we <br/>
weren&#39;t making or enforcing a bedtime, and were letting them eat food in <br/>
whatever order, not bugging them if they refused food, and letting them have <br/>
as much of it as they wanted.  <br/>

<br/>
Three months isn&#39;t so long.  And depending how strong the &quot;rules&quot; were, it <br/>
might take longer with some than others.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now he rarely eats<br/>
breakfast or just eats fruit chews or gold fish. Most days he eats maybe half <br/>
a peanut<br/>
and jelly sandwich and the rest junk...chips, candy, ice cream etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe change the array of available foods so there are new and different fun <br/>
things he hasn&#39;t tried.  If you have the same stuff all the time, mix it up.  <br/>
 Don&#39;t replace ice cream and candy right away?   Are you still making him <br/>
food?  Can you find some dips for fruit that would make it fun and different? <br/>
 Slice it up cute around a little dish of some kind of dip?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Recently I have been talking with him about trying to eat more healthy <br/>
food...not<br/>
limiting junk food. I have told him that I have no problem with him eating as <br/>
much<br/>
junk food as he wants, as long as he eats *some* healthy food.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like that would encourage him to eat MORE than he wanted to.  To <br/>
add &quot;healthy&quot; food to &quot;as much junk as he wants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of people dividing the world into educational and &quot;just <br/>
playing&quot; or &quot;waste of time.&quot;  It&#39;s not a good way to enable children to <br/>
choose what they actually like or want.  If they know you consider some of it <br/>
&quot;good for them&quot; and the other &quot;a waste,&quot; that might affect their decisions, <br/>
especially if there&#39;s any resentment or backlash.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499729947">How about...filling the fridge with those fruits you mentioned? <br/>
Slicing cheese and making it available for snacking? My mil swears <br/>
that the only way to eat oatmeal is...in a cookie! L Oatmeal cookies <br/>
have fiber and egg and butter and raisins and nuts. Don&#39;t have the <br/>
junkfood as part of the staples of your pantry and fridge. Bring them <br/>
out for special occasions, even have a special occasion once a day! <br/>
Let him eat as much of what you provide, as he wants, and provide <br/>
wholesome stuff.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well 3 months isn&#39;t a really long time and you have admitted to some outward <br/>
behavior that goes against totally letting go. So in essence it hasn&#39;t even <br/>
been a total 3 months of total non restriction. Depending on the child and <br/>
the parent, it will take awhile for things to even out. And even then, some <br/>
kids are totally erratic anyway. My kids have such swings in their eating <br/>
habits it would drive me crazy if I worried. Some say to look at the week <br/>
and it will balance. Sometimes I would probably have to do it by months with <br/>
my kids!!<br/>
<br/>
Next thing is to maybe not have so much &quot;junk&quot; food available. Just because <br/>
you don&#39;t want to restrict doesn&#39;t mean you have to have tons of junk <br/>
available all the time. If you run out, say so and offer what else you have <br/>
available. If your child asks for more to be replaced, you can promise to <br/>
get it the next time you go shopping. I also find what works well with my <br/>
kids is to just put certain foods out and if it&#39;s there, they will eat it. I <br/>
don&#39;t do this as a trick but more as conveniece for me if I have things to <br/>
do and would like the flow not to ber broken with getting 3 kids 3 different <br/>
foods and 3 different times. I&#39;ll put out a bowl or plate of whatever and <br/>
most of the time, someone eats most of what&#39;s there. You can do that with <br/>
fruit or whatever you like. Kids love finger foods and my kids love to dip <br/>
stuff. Their dip of choice is creamy white, which is ranch dressing. They <br/>
put it on stuff I can&#39;t even stomach to think about. Not sure where it came <br/>
from as I hate the stuff!!!! They also like cheese dip and recently salsa. <br/>
My kids also like to eat things with toothpicks. I buy the fancy colored <br/>
plastic ones and they love that too. Make it fun and different. Cut shapes <br/>
and offer little bowls of different things.<br/>
<br/>
Just hang in there, which it seems like you want to do anyway and it will <br/>
work out fine. Good luck with being patient!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Stephanie, I&#39;m no expert on this kind of thing, but I grew up in a <br/>
household where my mom taught us to eat healthfully... and it <br/>
has stuck with all three kids. In our home, I just don&#39;t buy what I <br/>
don&#39;t want the kids to eat. There is no soda, no fruit chews, no <br/>
junk food. We make homemade cookies.<br/>
<br/>
We are not manaichal about it. I do buy Doritos on sale <br/>
sometimes and we eat homemade maple syrup on pancakes <br/>
(which means 2 cups of sugar, some extract and water), they put <br/>
jam in their plain yogurt or mini chocolate chips.<br/>
<br/>
But I never buy candy, never buy soda, never buy lunchables, <br/>
never buy stuff I don&#39;t want them to eat. And then we talk about <br/>
food and what it&#39;s made of, why some foods are healthier than <br/>
others. My dh is less nutritionally conscious than I am, but he is <br/>
adamant about limiting sugar intake for the reasons you <br/>
mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
There is a huge fruit bowl out on the counter at all times. When <br/>
someone says, &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; I point to the fruit bowl. Or they can <br/>
get some yogurt. Or make a piece of toast. Or eat some crackers <br/>
and cheese. Sometimes I hop up and just make a healthy <br/>
snack. The kids eat whatever is put before them when they&#39;re <br/>
hungry and I haven&#39;t made a big deal about foods being <br/>
taboojust seen as occasional or every day. <br/>
<br/>
So the times they eat sugar are for treatsafter Halloween <br/>
(when I pay them to give up any candyit&#39;s like a mini auction <br/>
and they love it!), at parties, when we are at a a buffet <br/>
restaurant...<br/>
<br/>
My kids like candy like the next kid, but they don&#39;t crave it, don&#39;t <br/>
nag for it and eat it as a treat.<br/>

Are you still making those yummy breakfasts? When my kids  are choosing more <br/>
less-nutritious foods, I start making lunches and breakfasts that I feel <br/>
happy with, and THEN say, Lunch is ready! Usually they are happy that someone <br/>
made a meal and put it on the table so they eat it. (Not that it is so rare <br/>
to do so here) I cut up fruit and put it in front of them. I stop waiting for <br/>
them to tell me what they want and I just give them something. They are free <br/>
to turn it down and sometimes they do, but not usually.<br/>

<br/>
I hear this all the time, but we have a HUGE glass bowl filled with M&Ms, a <br/>
bowl filled with Pistachios, and a bowl overflowing with shelled sunflower <br/>
seeds. (When there are NO guests in the house), guess which bowl needs <br/>
refilling the most? Sunflower seeds. When we have guests (adults OR <br/>
children!) the M&M bowl is emptied immediately!<br/>
<br/>
The cupboard is always stocked with chips (potato and corn), crackers, and <br/>
candies. I bake a lot, so there is always brownies or cookies or a cake <br/>
nearby. The &#39;frig&#39; is full of snacks. My boys LOVE cut up peppers, cukes, and <br/>
carrots with dip. Can&#39;t keep enough around. Weird fruits are popular---the <br/>
weirder, the better.<br/>
<br/>
We always have Cokes and tea and fruit juices and chilled water and chocolate <br/>
milk. No one is chosen more often that the others.<br/>
<br/>
Ice cream, two or three flavors.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, they pick and choose. They even go look in the cupboard (filled with <br/>
&quot;junk food&quot;) and ask, &quot;Don&#39;t we have ANYthing to eat?&quot; &lt;G&gt; They COULD <br/>
literally sit and eat &quot;junk&quot; all day. They don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
If all food is considered &quot;equal&quot; (not good or bad for you) I think more <br/>
&quot;GOOD&quot; food will be eaten because the BODY makes the choices, NOT the head.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of kids whose food was restricted as toddlers/young children. As <br/>
SOON as they were able to make their own choices, they ate ONLY &quot;junk&quot;. <br/>
Because they COULD.  Mine make wise choices, because they CAN.<br/>

The main reason I can understand what you&#39;re syaing is having <br/>
lived in a sorority house. 25% of the girls had eating disorders. <br/>

driven by their heads.<br/>

<br/>
Yep. But I want to add that in my family of origin, learning about <br/>
healthy eating and having that as our primary diet has translated <br/>
into three adults who make healthy choices and don&#39;t pig out on <br/>
junk. So I guess I think the attitude must be key here.<br/>
<br/>
When our kids are at a friend&#39;s house, I haven&#39;t noticed them <br/>
binging on junk. So perhaps we&#39;ve struck some kind of balance <br/>
here too.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I bake a lot, so there is always brownies or cookies or a cake <br/>
nearby. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I made two big trays of brownies.  The first tray went over about 30  hours.  <br/>
I ate more than anyone.   The second tray was untouched last night, so I cut <br/>
it up and put it in a plastic storage box.  <br/>
<br/>
I could put it out today, and I might, but the menu today besides birthday <br/>
cake is Marty&#39;s request: <br/>
 croissants (bought) and stuff to put in them for sandwiches<br/>
<br/>
so we&#39;re putting out ham, turkey, salmon<br/>
cream cheese with green chile<br/>
lettuce and tomatoes<br/>
pickles<br/>
cheese<br/>
<br/>
devilled eggs (because Holly has lately come to love them)<br/>
<br/>
chips and dip (Keith made the dip)<br/>
<br/>
We have two homemade baquettes of cheese bread, which I&#39;m going to slice <br/>
lengthwise and melt mozarella into, and then have spaghetti sauce out for <br/>
dipping.  That will be &quot;appetizer&quot; (lunch) around 12:15, after which Marty <br/>
has games planned, and wants the main food at 3:30 or so.  It&#39;s a <br/>
noon-to-dark-thirty party.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t get candy or cheetos or anything like that, and none of the kids <br/>
who will be here will be unhappy (or even notice).   Few of them even love <br/>
cake, although this one&#39;s a from-scratch fancy white cake (Marty&#39;s favorite) <br/>
which involved beating egg whites (generally more work than I love) and will <br/>
be three layers with homemade frosting (which I&#39;ll do in a few hours).  <br/>
<br/>
I expect the turkey and salmon to be gone before anything else.<br/>
Eggs next.<br/>
<br/>
The age range of kids will be ten (if Adam shows) to eighteen, not counting <br/>
some adults.<br/>

refilling the bowl, and they&#39;ll probably get tired of them.<br/>
<br/>
Halloween is one of the best tests for people wanting to stop being the <br/>
food-controllers for their kids.  If kids eat two candies a day, or whatever, <br/>
they can manage to eat every bit of it, even stuff they don&#39;t like.  If they <br/>
try to eat it all at once, lots will end up in the trash or they&#39;ll get to <br/>
the point that they don&#39;t want to see it for the rest of the week, or year.<br/>
<br/>
We have an advantage, having done this way always (thanks in part to an <br/>
article in Mothering Magazine many years ago, and because my husband binges <br/>
and I didn&#39;t want to do anything against which a binge would be reactionary, <br/>
hoping to help the kids avoid that).   It has been many years since any child <br/>
here finished holiday candy (Christmas, Easter, Halloween) before the next <br/>
holiday rolled around.  Often they end up throwing their stash away because <br/>
the outsides of the wrappers are getting dusty (New Mexico does that) and <br/>
they already have new candy from the last holiday, in a box lid or bowl <br/>
somewhere in their room.  We never make a big deal about it one way or <br/>
another.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby takes Red Vines with him to the anime convention he goes to.  He took <br/>
two of the plastic buckets (from costco) of 200 or however many last year, <br/>
and they were gone in one day (he gives them out to anyone who comes and <br/>
asks).  Last year and this he&#39;s signed up to have his convention badge say <br/>
&quot;Licorice Boy.&quot;  So if any of you are at Nan Desu Kan in Denver this fall, <br/>
look for him.  He&#39;ll probably take three or four buckets this year.   When he <br/>
has an of that in his room at home, he&#39;ll eat one or two a day, if he <br/>
remembers, and it will get hard before it gets gone.  Unless he has a lot of <br/>
company.<br/>

I did want to point out the over-use of &quot;junk food&quot; in this thread and in <br/>
general life.   I think ho-hos are prob&#39;ly junk food.  But not all imperfect <br/>
or B-string or whatever food is &quot;junk.&quot;  I think it needs to be nearly no <br/>
nutritional value whatsoever to be junk.   Grilled salmon is better than a <br/>

implosion coming on, a drive through fish sandwich is the perfect antidote to <br/>
my having forgotten to eat well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147914087">I have been thinking about this food issue for a while now. My 2 girls<br/>
will pretty much eat any fruits or vegetables that they grow and pick. So<br/>
during the summer time they eat plenty of strawberries, blackberries,<br/>
peaches, cherries, pears, apples, and a variety of garden vegetables.<br/>
They are not all too interested in junk food, and I don&#39;t bake that much<br/>
in the summertime. The winter time is a different story. They will eat<br/>
some store bought fruits and veggies, but only if they are fresh, ie: no<br/>
canned or frozen. They don&#39;t even care for the fruits or veggies that we<br/>
canned ourselves. But they do tend to fill up on junk food all winter. I<br/>
try to buy junk food of the healthful sorts, with no artificial colors or<br/>
flavors, no MSG, low fat, low amount of refined sugar, and do bake a lot.<br/>
And herein lies the problem. The oldest is starting to get pretty chunky.<br/>
It may be just a stage thing (she&#39;s 5), but I don&#39;t want it to become a<br/>
health problem. I was wondering, do all of you who let your children eat<br/>
whatever they want have concerns for their childrens&#39; weight? And I am<br/>
not talking from a societal view, but a health view. I know that lack of<br/>
exercise during the winter months is also a contributing factor, and I<br/>
have seen some of the weight come off during the summer months, but never<br/>
the same amount that was put on. Is this something I should be concerned<br/>
about? How do you all handle the unhealthy aspect of allowing your<br/>
children to eat whatever they want?<br/>

once!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, it hasn&#39;t quite happened for me yet.  I chose peanut M&Ms for my substitute for smoking last year.  It took about 6 months of binging(and about 20 lbs.) for me to quit craving them (or cigarettes).  <br/>
<br/>
I was one of those kids who was severely (imo) restricted regarding junk food.  We could not have sugary cereals (always had to be Cheerios, Rice Crispies, Chex), no kind of Little Debbie&#39;s or snacky cake type stuff, pretzels--no chips, and we couldn&#39;t even chew gum.  I remember vividly when I was about 10 or 11 going through my mother&#39;s old discarded purses for any forgotten sugar free gum that she might have had stashed for herself (she didn&#39;t share either).  <br/>
<br/>
As soon as I was old enough to walk to the store, my main allowance expenses were 1 large bag of Doritoes, 1 box of Little Debbie&#39;s (Swiss Cake Rolls is my all time fav.), and a 45 RPM record.  I would go to my room, listen to my new music and eat, and eat, and eat.  I felt like I was really getting away with something.  My mother didn&#39;t know about it or she probably would have found a way to stop my indulgences.  I ended up gaining about 30 lbs. in Jr. High School due to this bad habit.  I still haven&#39;t conquered this need to &#39;treat&#39; myself whenever I want.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I have a friend who was allowed all kinds of junk to eat and she ended up gaining a lot of weight too........so I guess poor eating habits happen for different reasons for different people but for me it was definitely the restriction that led to the bingeing.  <br/>
<br/>
For my kids, I try so hard to model good eating behaviors but it&#39;s still hard not to want to eat crap all the time.  They are allowed pretty much whatever they want but I have always limited quantities.  Such as, only 1 snack cake a day, 1 soda a day, chips only with a sandwich (or a meal) instead of allowing them to snack on them at will.  I have even relaxed these &#39;rules&#39;( maybe about 4-5 months ago) and I have already noticed a difference in their eating.  My daughter biggest request from the store this week was canned spinach (yuck!).  My son&#39;s was celery.  <br/>

for so long? But after 3 or 4 large bags of M&Ms you *can* leave them alone<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest son (raised by dad and stepmom for 12 years, family is conservative <br/>
christian and &quot;training&quot; their children - you get the idea) is overweight. <br/>
His food intake has been restricted and regulated for his whole life. No <br/>
seconds at the dinner table, he could only eat as much as the adults.<br/>
He used to sneak upstairs to their kitchen after everyone was asleep, and <br/>
eat. He told me it was because there was no one there to tell him not to, so <br/>
he would take advantage of that. He could finally eat in peace. He just came <br/>
in and told me that he would wake up at 4:00 in the morning to do this, then <br/>
go back to bed after he ate a couple sandwiches.<br/>
Sad. After being here for almost 4 months, he doesn&#39;t have to do this <br/>
anymore. Once he realized I wasn&#39;t going to restrict him, he didn&#39;t have to <br/>
sneak.<br/>
It breaks my heart to think of the hurt I didn&#39;t see.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720790737">I was wondering, do all of you who let your children eat<br/>
whatever they want have concerns for their children&#39;s weight? And I am<br/>
not talking from a societal view, but a health view. I know that lack of<br/>
exercise during the winter months is also a contributing factor, and I<br/>
have seen some of the weight come off during the summer months, but never<br/>
the same amount that was put on. Is this something I should be concerned<br/>
about? How do you all handle the unhealthy aspect of allowing your<br/>
children to eat whatever they want?<br/>
Wende<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wende, I find that allowing them to eat what they want when they want<br/>
actually helps keep the weight down. I do, on occasion say; okay to the<br/>
cookies, but then something nutritional, if they&#39;ve been going at cookies<br/>
and candies a lot over a set period of time, but most of the time, they ask<br/>
for something, and if we have it they get it.  My worry is actually the<br/>
opposite; mine are all on the small side.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, most of the children who I see who are overweight are from the<br/>
regulated, clean your plate, dessert after more nutritional food (one mom<br/>
wouldn&#39;t let her child have more blueberries until she had more veggies or<br/>
chicken, can&#39;t remember which. Because blueberries were sweet and she wanted<br/>
her to not be so use to sweet tastes.)  <br/>
<br/>
I look at it this way; if you have a cookie and a sandwich, you are getting<br/>
the cookies from both.  If all you want is a cookie, that is all the<br/>
calories you are going to get.  What eating a good meal before dessert does<br/>
is train the body to eat more than it is hungry for in order to satiate the<br/>
taste buds. If you satisfy both your physical/emotional and sensory needs<br/>
with one thing, then you are not adding more food into your body than you<br/>
want.  <br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann<br/>
mom to one sick little girl (Tehila, my 3.5 threw up 3x---last time on<br/>
breast milk) so if I&#39;m rambling that is why...well, that is what I&#39;m saying<br/>
is why,  it may or may not really be true.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure but I would guess maybe one needs to look at the family <br/>
history. Some families just have large people in them no matter how they <br/>
eat.<br/>
<br/>
I really have no one on my families side that is heavy. My husband really <br/>
doesn&#39;t either but I have seen one aunt put on the weight and his sisters <br/>
tend to be a bit overwweight but I wouldn&#39;t say large.<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest, (not my husbands biological daughter) comes from a very <br/>
overweight family. They are always dieting and always big. As in fat big. <br/>
Once I got away from her dad, I let her eat the way she wanted to. Her <br/>
sister, (me ex step daughter who I am very close to) is very overweight and <br/>
still has issues now at age 28. Tara was away from her dad and with my <br/>
husband now from age 4 on. She is not overweight at all. I don&#39;t worry about <br/>
her getting that way and she doesn&#39;t diet, although she&#39;ll have the same <br/>
anxiety pains every once in awhile that most 17 year old girls have like, <br/>
&quot;does my stomach look fat in this outfit?&quot; She&#39;s a lot better now than she <br/>
was even a year ago. The Oprah show helped that a lot and she is pretty well <br/>
pleased with herself now.<br/>
<br/>
Our other 3 children are not even looking like I have to worry about weight. <br/>
My 8 yr old Joseph is downright skinny. Of course pictures of me at that age <br/>
show the same incredibly skinny legs!!! The two younger girls are not big at <br/>
all. The kids all wear sizes of their ages and most a year younger even.<br/>
<br/>
So although there is potential there for them to possibly have a problem, I <br/>
don&#39;t worry or see it at all.<br/>

I know that sometimes there are a lot of psychological attachments to<br/>
food. I know of one set of parents who were obese themselves, who<br/>
literally starved their child to the point where he could not properly<br/>
digest his food, and eventually died, because of their fears of him<br/>
becoming overweight. I know another family, a rather large one with 11<br/>
children, have the &quot;first one at the table gets the most food&quot; attitude,<br/>
and it is not very fun watching them eat like scavengers till every last<br/>
morsel is gone. These eating habits follow them all through life. I&#39;m<br/>
just wondering, did your son sneak food because he was actually hungry?<br/>
You said he would sneak down when we could eat in peace. Was he actually<br/>
finding peace in eating? Now that he has a choice, does he eat more<br/>
nutritious foods only when he is hungry? I ask, because my daughter seems<br/>
to be a muncher. She wants to eat all day long, but won&#39;t really eat much<br/>
at a sit down meal. I was not that concerned about it, but it seems to be<br/>
getting to the point where she can&#39;t go anywhere or do anything without a<br/>
snack. A box of raisins for the 5 minute car ride, crackers while<br/>
watching a tape, granola bar while she is painting, etc.etc. I&#39;ll will<br/>
ask her if she is hungry and she will tell me no. It is like she is<br/>
munching for the sake of munching. I don&#39;t want her to start bad habits<br/>
she will have problems braking later, but I don&#39;t want to deprive her<br/>
either. Is this just a stage?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397421517">I&#39;d love to see the input on this one, because I have a little girl <br/>
chunking up, too. Only her chubiness started this summer, when her <br/>
appetite EXPLODED! She&#39;s really active...my goer, my non-stopper, <br/>
night owl, explorer, gonna give her momma a heart attack, afraid of <br/>
nothing but spiders...and so I haven&#39;t worried about her, but <br/>
there&#39;s definitely a baby fat look to her round little face and <br/>
plump belly. Who is the artist who painted mothers and children, <br/>
where there&#39;s a little girl getting in a tub of water and her mother <br/>
hovering behind her...that little girl&#39;s belly looks just like my <br/>
Katie&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t ever stopped her from eating how much she wants. Heck, my <br/>
boy eats like a dad-blasted bird, tall and skinny, and I never push <br/>
more food on him. The dinner table has always been pretty much a <br/>
free zone. Eat until you&#39;re full. If I don&#39;t push MORE food on <br/>
Robby, I know it would be wrong to try and stop Katie from eating.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t junky food, either. We don&#39;t have much of that sort of <br/>
stuff in the house. Box of mac n cheese once in awhile. Just lots of <br/>
the wholesome stuff, with frequent treats. <br/>
