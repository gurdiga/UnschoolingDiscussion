<div id="ygrps-yiv-659773400">Isn&#39;t it awesome?! You covered alot of material that wouldn&#39;t be taught <br/>
until much higher grades in ps, without forcing your child to sit and be <br/>
filled with information that he wasn&#39;t interested in. The things he is <br/>
learning now are going to stay with him, because they matter to him.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to look for some constellations now, as they fit right in to <br/>
this interest in mythology. That star guy on pbs is great-in 5 minutes he <br/>
can get you all inspired to go out and look at the sky, and he tells you <br/>
exactly how to find things. Thursdays classroom on the net has good stuff <br/>
about stars and meteors and such, also.<br/>

&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just wanted to share our recent interest catalyst.  Yes it was... THE TV.<br/>
&gt;(g)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Alex (6) surprised me at breakfast the other day by asking me about the<br/>
&gt;story of Macbeth. Through our ensuing conversation, I learned that there<br/>
&gt;had been something on Arthur about Macbeth.  Also, this week, the movie<br/>
&gt;of choice in the house has been Hercules (Disney).  This was being<br/>
&gt;requested 2 times a day!  Well, it does have great music and some pretty<br/>
&gt;funny dialog, so I was roped in each viewing.  This led to some of the<br/>
&gt;following questions from Alex:  Who was Odysseus, who was Pandora (of The<br/>
&gt;Box fame), what was the Trojan Horse, what is Cerebus.  We looked in the<br/>
&gt;encyclopedia for some answers and also got books from the library.  There<br/>
&gt;are some great books for kids about what you would consider &quot;adult<br/>
&gt;stuff&quot;.  Alex has been reading (or read to) about the adventures of<br/>
&gt;Odysseus, the Trojan War, and Greek Mythology.  We also got a kick out of<br/>
&gt;learning the 12 labors of Hercules and then noticing what was made<br/>
&gt;mention of in the movie.  Also, we got a great book called the Tales of<br/>
&gt;Shakespeare, which has some of the plays in a sort of comic book lay out.<br/>
&gt;  Very cool.  Yesterday we read Macbeth and Romeo & Juliet.  Alex really<br/>
&gt;liked all the fighting and mayhem.  I wanted to cry at the end of R & J.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry this was so long, I just thought it was all way too cool.<br/>
