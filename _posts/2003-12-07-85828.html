<div id="ygrps-yiv-206040161">A premiss that some people seem to associate with unschooling is the idea<br/>
that we are to provide all the possible choices imaginable to our children<br/>
and then let them choose what they want. This is not, in my opinion, what<br/>
unschooling entails.<br/>
<br/>
I think that many people are confused about this because of some of the<br/>
questions mainly about &quot;limits&quot;, the thread about appropriate movies, the<br/>
thread about showing children all religions so they can &quot;choose&quot;, etc.....<br/>
<br/>
Or the recent &quot;gun&quot; thread,  To which Sandra responds with this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It&#39;s not pro-gun, it&#39;s anti-controlling.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Toy guns or video games, like television, food, bedtime, reading, clothes,<br/>
&gt;etc., all involve issues of learning, experimentation, thought, sharing,<br/>
&gt;individual preference, and the same arguments against requiring or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>restricting or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;mom-chosen limits apply to guns as to so many other things<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What this reflect IS a premiss of unschooling.  Unschooling means trusting<br/>
your child above any &quot;ideas&quot; (like hating guns) you have in regards to a<br/>
life which isn&#39;t yours- your child&#39;s.  What we are saying is that IF our<br/>
child chooses something, we trust it.  &quot;Anti-controlling&quot;, &quot;non- coersive&quot;-<br/>
those are other ways to define &quot;trust&quot;- because if we trust a child, that he<br/>
is going to try his best to make benificial decisions, there is no need to<br/>
&quot;limit&quot; something or &quot;control&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
We are NOT saying it is our job to give the child every thing we can think<br/>
of even if we disagree with it.<br/>
<br/>
That is like saying, &quot;here you go- these are all the movies you can choose<br/>
from, I will describe them- cartoon, anime, documentary, porno, horror...&quot;,<br/>
or &quot;there are alot of ways people behave in the world, today I will show you<br/>
honesty, love and generosity, and tomorrow I will show you deceit, hate, and<br/>
greed- you choose!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Part of our parenting job- probably the most important one- is just living<br/>
our life well (this is said all the time on the list- about being<br/>
interesting, kind people ourselves).  In our culture, this entails a bunch<br/>
of choices- what to eat, where to get information, who to be with. etc.<br/>
Being unschoolers doesn&#39;t mean we have to offer our kids things we wouldn&#39;t<br/>
choose for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Um, so, for example...you and your husband are vegetarian, for many reasons.<br/>
You have children- you continue to be vegetarian, so your children are<br/>
vegetarian.  Trusting, or &quot;no limits&quot; doesn&#39;t mean offering your kids meat.<br/>
It also doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t explain your ideas to your kids about being<br/>
vegetarian and give them information about vegetarians.<br/>
<br/>
What it DOES mean, though, is if your kids are offered meat and wish to<br/>
except it, you don&#39;t &quot;limit&quot; them, or forcebly make a decision for them.  It<br/>
means reconsidering our &quot;ideas&quot; if they go against something our child does-<br/>
not necessarily changing them, but sometimes (many times) it does mean<br/>
looking at life differently and changing ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
This is a scary thing for people sometimes- giving our kids information and<br/>
then holding back our imprinted desire to &quot;make&quot; them do what we want.  But<br/>
it is what trust really looks like.<br/>
<br/>
When you trust your kids like this, a corollary is that they trust *you*.<br/>
You become more powerful than you ever could be by force-- what you say and<br/>
do is very valued by your kids--because they know you care more for them<br/>
than anyone else in the world and you would only tell them what you honestly<br/>
think. In other words, your kids will likely choose to become vegetarians.<br/>
But if they don&#39;t- you and your kids know that they will be accepted and<br/>
loved nonetheless, you might even help them prepare meat- or do more<br/>
research on veg. and you could even change your mind about it.<br/>
<br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;His mom believed him when he told her he didn&#39;t smoke it, and she listened<br/>
 </span></blockquote>when he said that since he got in trouble for it anyway, next time he was<br/>
going<br/>
to try it.  She said, &quot;I trust you.  I know you want to experiment.  If you<br/>
think it&#39;s becoming a problem, talk to me so I can help you.&quot;  And she left<br/>
it<br/>
at that.<br/>
<br/>
I think having my mind blown up and out by what my kids think and do is one<br/>
of the greatest things about being a parent :-)<br/>
