<div id="ygrps-yiv-930005803">&lt;&lt;No way!  That&#39;s what my DS called it!  Too funny.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is funny!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 2yo DD is really into horses, but doesn&#39;t say the last part of the<br/>
word.  When she sees them she gleefully yells &quot;Whore!!!  Mama,<br/>
whoooooore!  Whore, Mama, whore!&quot;  Cracks me right up at what other<br/>
people must be thinking.  ;~)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh!!!  What a scream!  I can just imagine!<br/>
<br/>
One time, when we were driving around, this woman kept cutting me off and <br/>
slowing down almost to a stop in front of me.  I mistakenly called her a <br/>
bitch under my breath...or so I thought.  We finally got around her and <br/>
about 10 minutes later, ended up next to her at a stoplight.  Just as we <br/>
stopped, Haleigh (then 19 months old) yells out, &quot;There&#39;s the bitch Momma!  <br/>
There&#39;s the bitch!  Look Momma, I see the bitch again!&quot;  It was summer, all <br/>
the windows were down, including the &#39;bitch&#39;es windows.  She heard it all.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t help that Haleigh was pointing *right* at her!  It was terrible <br/>
because we were laughing so hard we couldn&#39;t just ignore it and hope it <br/>
would go away.  The harder we laughed, the more Haleigh yelled it.  Ugh! LOL <br/>
  I can only imagine what she thought of us!  Haleigh was teeny tiny for her <br/>
age and talked like crazy.  That poor woman....mwahahaha!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676931758">&lt;&lt;&lt;My 10yo (when she was much younger) would say &quot;daddy shaved off his<br/>
mouth-brow&quot; LOL.<br/>
You know, your eyes have eyebrows and his mouth had a mouthbrow.<br/>
Hehe<br/>
<br/>
Ang&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh how funny!  A couple of years ago, my girlfriend and I were on the phone <br/>
while my husband was shaving next to me.  He usually keeps his head shaved <br/>
with a &quot;1&quot; on the clippers and had missed a strip of one of his side burns.  <br/>
For the life of me, I could not get SIDE BURN out and ended up calling it a <br/>
cheekbrow.  They laughed so hard I almost felt like a kid and wanted to cry! <br/>
LOL  They STILL say cheekbrow and roar with laughter every time they say it.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, I just love to be the butt of their jokes.  :/<br/>
