&lt;&lt; Karen, I&#39;d be very interested in<br/>
 hearing what made you decide to go with unschooling.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
Mostly, becoming a parent.  My views on what things are better for children <br/>
really changed after becoming a mother.  Prior to that, I believed in all day <br/>
kindergarten, and set up a full day program for the school I worked at.  I am <br/>
so against it now.  Up until about 2 yrs ago, I had never even heard of <br/>
homeschooling, much less unschooling.  After reading all I could get my hands <br/>
on about it, I knew it was absolutely the right and best way to go, and am so <br/>
glad that I have &quot;seen the light&quot; !  BUT, there are still those times when <br/>
the &quot;teacher&quot; in me wants to take over; but, I keep trying! :)  ~Karen</div>

in me still wants to get in the way at times, too.  at the same time, the<br/>
unschooler in me gets in the way when i&#39;m at work.  that is what causes me<br/>
more angst now. i want to let them have their freedom, but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mesh will with the program i teach in.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am sure this is difficult.  It&#39;s not easy to have &quot;2&quot; mind sets; and it&#39;s <br/>
not easy to change a mindset, even if you no longer agree with it in <br/>
principle.   It&#39;s similar to having a habit that is hard to break, even <br/>
though you know it is wrong.  ~Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909682868">i was hs&#39;ed for one school year in 1974-75 when i was in jr. high.  i went<br/>
back the following year for several reasons, but the hs&#39;ing was just a<br/>
stop gap measure my parents employed due to our living circumstances at<br/>
the time.  they certainly weren&#39;t trying to be &quot;radical&quot; or anything.<br/>
