AN OWED TO THE SPELL CHEQUER<br/>
<br/>
(CANDIDATE FOR A PULLET SURPRISE)<br/>

I have a spelling checker,<br/>
It came with my PC.<br/>
It plane lee marks four my revue<br/>
Miss steaks aye can knot sea.<br/>
<br/>
Eye ran this poem threw it,<br/>
Your sure reel glad two no.<br/>
Its vary polished in it&#39;s weigh.<br/>
My checker tolled me sew.<br/>
<br/>
A checker is a bless sing,<br/>
It freeze yew lodes of thyme.<br/>
It helps me right awl stiles two reed,<br/>
And aides me when eye rime.<br/>
<br/>
Each frays come posed up on my screen<br/>
Eye trussed too bee a joule.<br/>
The checker pours o&#39;er every word<br/>
To cheque sum spelling rule.<br/>
<br/>
Bee fore a veiling checker&#39;s<br/>
Hour spelling mite decline,<br/>
And if we&#39;re lacks oar have a laps,<br/>
We wood bee maid too wine.<br/>
<br/>
Butt now bee cause my spelling<br/>
Is checked with such grate flare,<br/>
Their are know fault&#39;s with in my cite,<br/>
Of nun eye am a wear.<br/>
<br/>
Now spelling does knot phase me,<br/>
It does knot bring a tier.<br/>
My pay purrs awl due glad den<br/>
With wrapped word&#39;s fare as hear.<br/>
<br/>
To rite with care is quite a feet<br/>
Of witch won should bee proud,<br/>
And wee mussed dew the best wee can,<br/>
Sew flaw&#39;s are knot aloud.<br/>
<br/>
Sow ewe can sea why aye dew prays<br/>
Such soft wear four pea seas,<br/>
And why eye brake in two averse<br/>
Buy righting want too pleas.<br/>
<br/>
There are 25 mistakes in the title and the first two verses of this <br/>
poem - but as they are all real words, the computer spell checker <br/>
would not spot them. The complete poem has (by the author&#39;s count) <br/>
225 words, 127 of which are wrong but would not be picked out by a <br/>
spell checker.<br/>
