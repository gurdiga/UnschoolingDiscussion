<div id="ygrps-yiv-961715938">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just subscribed about a week ago, and have been lurking... thought it<br/>
was about time I introduced myself. My name is Nicole, I&#39;m 29 and<br/>
pregnant with my first, due in about 3 weeks! My boyfriend (or<br/>
&quot;baby-daddy&quot; in talk-show lingo) Terry and I live in rural Kentucky. <br/>
<br/>
While Terry is more traditional about things, I tend to research and<br/>
look for the best alternative... which is usually NOT the way &quot;most<br/>
people&quot; do things. At least not the people we know. For instance, I find<br/>
a vegetarian lifestyle the best way to live, for my own health and<br/>
karma. Terry likes to grill burgers and hotdogs. I have decided on<br/>
homebirth with a trained midwife as the best way to go - and although<br/>
Terry still thinks it&#39;d be &quot;safer&quot; to have the baby in the hospital, he<br/>
is going along with me on this one. Homeschooling/unschooling sounds<br/>
like a terrific idea to me, although I was not quite as poisoned by<br/>
public school as most folks have been... I went to &quot;alternative&quot; schools<br/>
in Kansas grades K-6, where kids are given more autonomy and<br/>
resposibility and learn stuff outside the 3 R&#39;s (i.e. we had a garden<br/>
and a class in geology, made papier mache volcanoes, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
I realize now that the stuff I learned because I took it upon myself -<br/>
outside of school - is the stuff I still know and use today. Stuff that<br/>
was drilled into my head in high school and college, I don&#39;t know<br/>
anymore and could give a rat&#39;s butt. ~:^ )  I did have some meaningful<br/>
social interaction in school, and a few really terrific teachers, but<br/>
was not involved in much extracurricular activity.<br/>
<br/>
Terry had a traditional ps education, and says his parents never had any<br/>
interest in his schooling at all - didn&#39;t care whether he did his<br/>
homework, etc. He has a phobic aversion to reading, whereas I am a<br/>
compulsive reader! Anyway, we&#39;ve been lightly discussing the<br/>
homeschooling topic, and he seems to be open to it, though not to the<br/>
extent that I&#39;d like. One thing that helps is the dubious quality of the<br/>
public schools around here, and the fact that they&#39;ll hire anyone off<br/>
the street to be a teacher because they&#39;re desperate. Another thing is<br/>
that he thinks I&#39;d be an excellent teacher (he thinks I ought to get one<br/>
of those jobs - no thanks!), and so well suited to educating our<br/>
daughter. I touched on the philosophy of unschooling (vs.<br/>
homeschooling), but he&#39;s one that takes his knowledge a little bite at a<br/>
time, so we&#39;ll see. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear more on the discipline topic, please. The Aletha Solter<br/>
excerpts make sense, but how do her ideas work in the real world?<br/>
<br/>
How about a recommended reading list? Not just for educating but for<br/>
parenting in general. I need something to take to the small-town<br/>
library, see if I can challenge them a bit to find what I want to read.<br/>
~:^ )<br/>
<br/>
Thanks y&#39;all!<br/>
