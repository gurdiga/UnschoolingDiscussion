<br/>
Registration is open now for this summers Always Learning Live symposium.  Pam Sorooshian, Jill Parmer and I will be the primary presenters this summer, but there will be panels and discussions with some or all of our kids, and others.<br/>

I know there are people here who never post, and some people don&#39;t like the quick text chats*, and some people truly prefer being in person at a more leisurely pace, where they can perceive things other than words, words, words.  So a symposium where people can listen, and ask questions, or just observe interactions, can be valuable (even to those who tend to write, write, write).<br/>
<br/>
Then in winter, Joyce Fetteroll and Deb Lewis will be in Albuquerque for Always Learning Live #2.<br/>
Next summer, Schuyler Waynforth and her husband, David, and their children, will be featured.<br/>
<br/>
Even for those who can&#39;t attend at all, there&#39;s a coloring-contest opportunity (Holly says &quot;call it art modification, not &#39;coloring contest&#39;&quot;), and that&#39;s lower down on that page.    Anyone who wants to take a shot at messing with/improving/riffing on that logo could get attention (at least) or a prize.  I will share any art that&#39;s sent to me, and do various cool things with some of them.<br/>
<br/>
Many people find value in meeting some of the people they&#39;re &quot;reading,&quot; and in seeing longtime unschooing families interacting in person. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest, Kirby, will turn 25 during the conference and we&#39;ll have a party for him there.<br/>
