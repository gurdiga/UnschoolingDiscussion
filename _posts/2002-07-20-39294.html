&gt; how bad life is and get used to it.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure this is not a new topic on this list, but I just dealt with this <br/>
recently.  At a Father&#39;s Day gathering at the in-laws&#39;, my husband&#39;s aunt and <br/>
I got into the old and tired &#39;socialization&#39; discussion.  When I explained <br/>
that my girls met with their homeschooled friends at park day at least twice <br/>
a month, the oldest (9) attends the Gifted Student Program (at her own <br/>
desire!) one day a week, as well as they meet numerous children from all over <br/>
the country when we&#39;re out doing our travel reviews, all she could counter <br/>
with was, &quot;Well, those are all kids *just* like her.  How is she going to <br/>
know what to do when little Johnny calls her a bad name?  That&#39;s the real <br/>
world!&quot;  AAAARRRRGGGGGG!  When I pointed out to her that the parents in our <br/>
homeschool groups vary from Fundamentalist Christians to devout Atheists, <br/>
from Yuppie professional types to tattoo artists, from ages 19 to <br/>
40-something, the point of our different backgrounds was lost on her.  It was <br/>
still important for my kids to know what to do when they are called names.  <br/>
Finally she quit when I said, &quot;Well, you know they&#39;ll do that to each other <br/>
when they hit late adolescence....guess it&#39;s lucky I have two...&quot;  Some <br/>
people!  No matter how much they think they want to be educated, they just <br/>
don&#39;t listen!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and thanks for your support on the &#39;lurking&#39; mode.  I usually try to lurk <br/>
awhile to get the feel before I jump in...I&#39;m glad you could all identify <br/>
with the &#39;dust&#39; plaque...LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I gave a brief intro as a homeschooling mom to two daughters (9 and 5 in 13 <br/>
days - she&#39;s counting!)...we love the philosophy of unschooling!  What freaks <br/>
we are considered to many, people just don&#39;t get it.  My question is <br/>
this...how much &#39;guidance&#39; are parents allowed before we&#39;re not really <br/>
considered &#39;unschoolers?&#39;  Izzy (9) chooses all of her topics and such, but I <br/>
do have a guideline (although very loose) which keeps her kind of <br/>
well-rounded in my opinion.   It&#39;s nothing major, just encourages her to <br/>
spread her learning between the computer, educational tv, fiction and <br/>
non-fiction, and even a little seatwork.  She always gets to choose which <br/>
show/book/workbook/cd/etc., but I give her a simple guideline of about 30 <br/>
minutes of each per day.  Of course, if she watches 4 hours of ER on TLC in <br/>
one day, that &#39;fulfills&#39; her &#39;requirement.&#39;  *I&#39;m VERY flexible on this.  She <br/>
gets to pick the workbook, etc.  Once we&#39;re &#39;back in the groove&#39; (all her <br/>
neighbor friends are back to school) she has to be doing something <br/>
&#39;eduationally productive&#39; between 9 (like she gets up that early...LOL) and <br/>
2ish...if she can explain to me why playing with LEGOS is educational (which <br/>
she can by skill very well...LOL) then fine, if she can tell me that playing <br/>
with Barbies &#39;is teaching me to be nurturing and requires cooperation with <br/>
Lilly (little sister)&#39;, then fine.  But I allow no junk TV or <br/>
Gameboy/Nintendo/PlayStation, etc. until after 2...does this sound like some <br/>
sort of unschooling?  Or am I way off???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your support and advice (I know no one here would bash <br/>
my theories for sharing them, right???? You seem Waaaayyyyyy too nice and <br/>
supportive for that!)<br/>

&gt; rooms, tons of sunny windows for all my plants, big wrap-around-porch, <br/>
&gt; shade <br/>
&gt; trees for tree houses and tire swings, a creek somewhere on the property, <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; both my kids, their significant others, and their kids. That&#39;s what I want. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Be careful what you wish for...LOL...  I failed to mention in my short intro <br/>
that we also do the multi-gen thing....my husband and I are both <br/>
&#39;semi-retired&#39; (great for early 30&#39;s) - he&#39;s was injured in the military, so <br/>
we have a pension from that, and I toy with hobbies that give us &#39;fun money&#39; <br/>
(presently teaching child care inservices).  Anyway, last summer we decided <br/>
to put a 1,800 sq. ft. addition onto my parent&#39;s home (basically a huge MIL <br/>
suite), and we all live together.  It&#39;s super - we each have our own separate <br/>
living quarters, and split all the bills 50/50.  I cook dinner for everyone <br/>
almost every night, the girls have both parents home with them, my parents <br/>
are closer to retirement since we help with the bills, the girls get some <br/>
gardening experience with my mom (brown thumb here), and get to visit with <br/>
their grandparents on a regular basis.  We all travel a bunch (my mom and dad <br/>
are presently in GA at a Harley rally, then they leave for three weeks for a <br/>
ride to Newfoundland in early August - we were gone all of April & May) so it <br/>
works VERY nicely!  It&#39;s a great plan, Nancy, and we hope that someday we <br/>
will share this house with our girls, then they could with each other, their <br/>
kids, etc. I would really love to see families getting back to this way of <br/>
life, people think we&#39;re so odd, but this was a common (and often necessary) <br/>
arrangement until, what, the nineteenth century?  It really gives us all <br/>
support and a terrific feeling of family.  I think we&#39;d all be somewhat <br/>
better off if we had this kind of support network as the norm rather than the <br/>
exception!<br/>
