<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Okay, so...does scheduling classes mean you&#39;re not unschooling? Is <br/>
&gt; one definition of unschooling &quot;Zero Structure&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gotta have structure, IMO. NOt etched in stone, strictly followed, <br/>
&gt; hour to hour scheduling. THAT doesn&#39;t work for anyone. But, you know, <br/>
&gt; structure. Like, a load of laundry a day and shine your sink every <br/>
&gt; day. Or, run the vacuum twice a week. Or maybe a daily goal of <br/>
&gt; writing 1,000 words, if one has a longer term goal of being a writer. <br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is THAT averse to the principles of unschooling?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh! another idea that came to mind for my way of doing this. MIght <br/>
&gt; not call it unschooling. Might call it Natural Learning or Learner <br/>
&gt; Led Education. and, when asked, might just say &quot;Oh, we don&#39;t follow a <br/>
&gt; set curriculum. We learn about the things that interest us.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; howzat sound?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the difference is whether the structure is desired by the individual. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Julian likes some structure. He has decided to set times for himself several <br/>
days a week that he calls &quot;study halls,&quot; in which he does some sort of <br/>
academic-y thing -- reads some history or literature, sometimes does some math on a <br/>
cd-rom. He decides what to do and how long. Recently he added practicing his <br/>
guitar every day.<br/>
<br/>
This was not my idea; it was his, and he&#39;s very happy with it. He also <br/>
occasionally takes classes or does programs locally, like through MIT, and he has <br/>
guitar lessons. So there&#39;s a bit of structure. But he does it because  for his <br/>
own reasons (he felt that it was too easy JUST to play computer games or JUST <br/>
read certain kinds of books without doing the other stuff he liked more <br/>
intentionally.) and his own way. My role, at his request, is to put his &quot;study hall&quot; <br/>
times in my calendar and remind him if he forgets. <br/>
<br/>
Structure isn&#39;t a bad thing...many people find it really useful, and my Virgo <br/>
child is one of them. The difference is that it&#39;s his own.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I stumbled upon the Junior Police Academy here, while on a website looking <br/>
&gt; for something altogether unrelated.  I KNEW Marty would be interested.  <br/>
&gt; Should I <br/>
&gt; have waited to see if he would stumble across it too?  That would be cruel.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s already signed up and has been to the orientation and fitted for his <br/>
&gt; uniform. It&#39;s all paid for by the Police Athletic League.  It lasts a week <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s really excited about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Two different friends of mine sent me information on a Weird Al concert <br/>
&gt; scheduled here for August.  I might eventually have discovered that on my <br/>
&gt; own, but <br/>
&gt; they WANT me to go and they want us all to sit together.   So they told me <br/>
&gt; because they knew and they knew I would want to know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m treating my kids the way I treat my friends.  Unschooling is not some <br/>
&gt; sort of test on which they can&#39;t cheat, and getting help from adults would <br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; cheating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never signed them up for classes they didn&#39;t want to take, but letting <br/>
&gt; them know what&#39;s available doesn&#39;t violate any unschooling principles, for <br/>
&gt; me.  <br/>
&gt; Holly was in my office the other night and said &quot;what&#39;s this?&quot; about the UNM <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continuing Education catalog.  I picked it up and flipped through, reading <br/>
&gt; what kinds of classes they have, and explained that they&#39;re mostly one-day <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; short-term things, not for college credit, just for fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wasn&#39;t trying to press her to enroll.  I was just answering her question <br/>
&gt; and giving her six or eight examples to give her the range.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Around here we have this great resource....it&#39;s called The Family Resource <br/>
Center, and they arrange all kinds of opportunities in the community-- museum <br/>
classes, walks with llamas, visits to a raptor rehab center, etc., etc.... You <br/>
join up, then you get access to all this cool stuff. When the new lists come <br/>
out every two months, Juls and I sit down and look at things he&#39;s interested in, <br/>
and we sign up. <br/>
<br/>
I see my &quot;job&quot; in this as a resource person. I know things Julian is <br/>
interested in, AND I know HIM really well, so I know when I see stuff that he MIGHT be <br/>
interested in it, even if he never thought about it before.  So, I ask. <br/>
Sometimes if he says no at first, and I REALLY am sure, I tell him a bit more, and <br/>
he trusts me, even if he&#39;s not sure. On those times, I have NEVER been wrong, <br/>
and they&#39;ve become real passions for him. But we both know it comes from my <br/>
paying LOTS of attention to him and knowing him really well.<br/>
<br/>
I think my role in unschooling for him is that I already know more about the <br/>
world, and I can share that. I have resources he doesn&#39;t. But I share. Come to <br/>
think of it, there are lots of ways in which his passions have also become <br/>
passions of mine.<br/>
