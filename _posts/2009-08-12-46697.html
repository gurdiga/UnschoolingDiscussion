<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151979663">=====I&#39;m not going to let my toddler just walk across the street by himself<br/>

That all depends on the street.  My daughter did cross the street all by<br/>
herself when she was two.  It was a quiet residential side street, and I had<br/>
already checked to make sure no cars were coming.  Now at four, she knows<br/>
which streets are safe to cross and which are not, and she is fully capable<br/>
of looking for cars on her own.  Driveways were still a little tricky a year<br/>
ago, but she can handle those now, too.<br/>
