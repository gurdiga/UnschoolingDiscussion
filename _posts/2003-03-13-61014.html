<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362037206">Hello everyone, I have a friend who has a son in Kuwait right now and she passed this along to me, I thought some of your children might enjoy making pictures or writing to some of the soldiers to cheer them up a bit.  She has told me that some of the soldiers don&#39;t receive mail, and her son has said that the letters from home are the only things keeping some of them sane, even though they don&#39;t know us.  They need our support!!<br/>
