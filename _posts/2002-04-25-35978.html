<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563902156"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m looking for mom&#39;s who either are homeschooling a child in<br/>
&gt; Kindergarten or who has recently.  I&#39;m not exactly 100% sure what<br/>
&gt; unschooling is, but I think it&#39;s what I have in mind for my son.  I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t wait to chat with ya&#39;ll.<br/>

Welcome!  Just listen for awhile and you&#39;ll learn more than you ever thought<br/>
you&#39;d want to know about unschooling.  It&#39;s facinating.<br/>
I don&#39;t live in Massachusetts, but I&#39;m unschooling my 5 year old son, who<br/>
could be in kindergarten this year (but we&#39;re glad he&#39;s not!).  We do what<br/>
we&#39;ve always done; I didn&#39;t add anything in particular when he hit five,<br/>
although I did start keeping some sketchy records to make the-sorts-that-<br/>
might-care happy.  We just kept reading and exploring the world; we go<br/>
places, and play outside, and talk and think.  That&#39;s about all it seems to<br/>
take; he&#39;s soaking up life like a sponge.<br/>
