<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921288896">I, too, kill every plant I touch - except Pothos Ivy.  They can be shriveled<br/>
up and dead looking, leaves all wilted, and they somehow revive when I<br/>
finally get around to watering them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never overwatered them, though (can&#39;t remember to, plus they are up<br/>
high so I need to get out the step stool, making it more involved than just<br/>
dumping a half-empty glass of water over them on the way to the kitchen).<br/>

has all these meanings and is supposed to survive everything and bring you luck <br/>
and prosperity...needless to say it was the unlucky one.<br/>
