I have an English degree and have dropped out of grad school three times <br/>
(English and American Studies), and there wasn&#39;t a math requirement.<br/>
<br/>
If I were taking sciences there would have been math.<br/>
If I had majored in psychology there would have been statistics.<br/>

university.<br/>
<br/>
And if a transcript shows a fair amount of math or if a high score on the ACT <br/>
enables a student to bypass the intro class, that&#39;s another way to get by <br/>
what might be a requirement for other people.<br/>

Different colleges even within same universities.<br/>
<br/>
I took a math for non-majors course, but it wasn&#39;t required.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s required at UNM now that there is either a math or science <br/>
course, and that might have been my requirement too.  I took biology and <br/>
geology, both 101 classes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, speaking from this POV . . .  The college I go to, and Rachel <br/>
wants to, does give placement tests to determine where you start in <br/>
the Math program.  They also give a quick English test to determine <br/>
need for College Prep English.  The English test is easy and is just <br/>
intended to find those who need the prep course before taking the 101 <br/>
course.  The math test os more complicated and can allow you to test <br/>
into various levels.  My dh tested straight into Calc I way back when, <br/>
I tested into Advanced Alg/Trig (and should have made them place me <br/>
lower).<br/>
<br/>
All of the universities and Colleges that our exchange student is <br/>
looking at have placement tests too.  I&#39;m sure there are other U&#39;s and <br/>
colleges that don&#39;t do this.  They probably have stricter admissions <br/>
policies so they don&#39;t need it.<br/>
