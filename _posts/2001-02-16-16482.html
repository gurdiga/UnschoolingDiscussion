<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044203721">That is exactly what I came to the computer this morning to complain <br/>
about!!!!!!!  I was so upset.  I usually DO watch ER, but I probably won&#39;t <br/>
anymore.  It sounded like a public service anouncement. It made parents who <br/>
chose not immunize sound STUPID STUPID STUPID<br/>
<br/>
Really, how often does someone actually get one of these diseases when they <br/>
don&#39;t immunize their children.<br/>
<br/>
doctor: &quot;rich people think only poor kids get immunized and they don&#39;t have <br/>
to, if everyone stopped immunizing small pox would come back, polio...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
mother: &quot;But there&#39;s a link between vaccinations and autism.  Doctor:  There <br/>
is no link!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
mother: &quot;is my son going to be alright?&quot; doctor:  &quot;1 in 500 children with <br/>
measles die&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and then of course there was a commercial during ER promoting some vaccine.  <br/>
I think it was hepatitis.  It said &quot;1 and 10,000 people die from hep(?)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing just infuriates.  The vacc. issue has been on my mind a lot <br/>
lately because my husband wants to go to school in the evenings but he is <br/>
required to take certain vacc. first, which is ridiculous considering that <br/>
the Army has already forced him to take SO many shots, including the flu <br/>
shot, and he most certainly have to take the anthrax shot before he goes to <br/>
Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
If I want to use the hourly daycare so that I can go to a doctor&#39;s appt. <br/>
(they will not allow children to accompany me during appt) then my kids&#39; <br/>
shot records have to be up to date.  So if I don&#39;t do that then how am I <br/>
supposed to get my teeth cleaned or whatever???<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it&#39;s getting to where people can&#39;t make their own decisions <br/>
anymore!!!!  I thought this was a free country.<br/>
<br/>
Ok.  I&#39;m done venting.  I was a little annoyed last night and I&#39;m still <br/>
annoyed.<br/>

&gt;Now, for hanging up, I hang them on the clothes horse<br/>
&gt;(or line) on the hanger already, that way they dry<br/>
&gt;straight, take up less space and go straight on the<br/>
&gt;rail when done!  Someone take me away, I&#39;ve gone<br/>
&gt;Stepford...  But I don&#39;t iron, though...<br/>

&gt;(heeh, just made that up) I know complain about piles<br/>
&gt;of DIRTY clothes. Not me. I love washing and drying<br/>
&gt;them. Seriously. I really really like it. I just<br/>
&gt;really really don&#39;t like folding and putting them<br/>

&gt;Hanging them up is worse. Ugh. I&#39;ll need much more<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; am young first of all (23), look even younger (one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lady thought I was 14!!!!!), always have a different<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; color of hair. The least accepted was an accidental<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pink color (I was going for bright red, but ..um...it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t work) it is currently growing out from its very<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, I&#39;m Bobbie, and I&#39;m a packrat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, there isn&#39;t a cure. Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly<br/>
&gt; &gt; junk-free<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and<br/>
&gt; &gt; books,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who<br/>
&gt; &gt; has won<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; come<br/>
&gt; &gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my<br/>
&gt; &gt; mom&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; house<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on<br/>
&gt; &gt; that pile<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own<br/>
&gt; &gt; house?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of<br/>
&gt; &gt; magazines<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means<br/>
&gt; &gt; nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old -<br/>
&gt; &gt; ack!.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; bathrooms<br/>
&gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room<br/>
&gt; &gt; table in<br/>
&gt; &gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little<br/>
&gt; &gt; pathways<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet<br/>
&gt; &gt; music, etc..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when<br/>
&gt; &gt; we were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my<br/>
&gt; &gt; way back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; on as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200<br/>
&gt; &gt; pounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great<br/>
&gt; &gt; tips<br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I died my hair blue twice, during shcool hols.  This<br/>
&gt;supposed wash-in-wash-out stuff reacted with the perm<br/>
&gt;in my hair and went green.  The fairly strict private<br/>
&gt;school I was at never batted an eyelid, though I could<br/>
&gt;have said it was uniform colour...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;My dd has a dress style all of her own. She wears a<br/>
&gt;crop top. Some <br/>
&gt;times a bra with a crop top over the top. A tank top<br/>
&gt;type t. shirt <br/>
&gt;and then another tank top over that. If we go out she<br/>
&gt;then puts her <br/>
&gt;USA *yellow* (her favourite colour)jersey on. Even if<br/>
&gt;the sun is <br/>
&gt;really hot and blue skies and every body is sweating in<br/>
&gt;t.shirts. <br/>
&gt;She has her undies on with boxers over that and her<br/>
&gt;skirt on top of <br/>
&gt;those. knee length white socks with coloured stripes<br/>
&gt;around the top <br/>
&gt;(dads) and her black sneakers. Some times she wears<br/>
&gt;her yellow polka <br/>
&gt;dot bandana on her head and/or her yellow scarf around<br/>
&gt;her <br/>
&gt;neck....... She wants to put a *pink* rinse through<br/>
&gt;her hair........<br/>

&gt;I was the only one home, and I&#39;m sick, so I sat down to peel kindling and<br/>
&gt;watch TV, not knowing what was on.  I watched NBC, a couple of very lame<br/>
&gt;sitcoms and then E.R., which I had never ever seen before.  It seemed to be<br/>
&gt;AMA propaganda.  Doctors were always right, patients were idiots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m hoping it wasn&#39;t typical of all their programs, but I&#39;ll try not to <br/>
&gt;watch<br/>
&gt;it anymore anyway.<br/>

&gt;Oh.  Playing with the bark from cedar.  It&#39;s easy to split, and the bark <br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;about 30 layers, sometimes that can be stripped into really thin, curly <br/>
&gt;bits.<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s a mindless sort of thing to do while I watch videos, but tonight I <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;too weak and brainless to find a video so I watched TV.   And filled up a <br/>
&gt;box<br/>
&gt;with easy-to-start tiny kindling.   I was creating excelsior, but am not<br/>
&gt;going to pack anything in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also it&#39;s a good excuse to sit right at the hearth and play with the fire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I doubt Americans guessed any better than you did, Carol.  Sorry.  (My<br/>
&gt;friends and relatives would have known.  I give the stuff away to friends<br/>
&gt;with fireplaces, so they have something artsy to use instead of newspaper <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;start fires.  And I give it to them in ratty baskets I get from garage <br/>
&gt;sales.<br/>
&gt;  When the baskets get old they&#39;re kindling too.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree with that. That&#39;s all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It really chaps my hide when someone (well meaning, of<br/>
&gt; &gt; course) hears me say something about something I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; want my son doing or something like that and says<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s just a boy thing. You won&#39;t be able to help it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; yeah right. And as for my daughter...she wants to be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; firefighter and a mommy and build houses and a dancer<br/>
&gt; &gt; and drive a white truck that she works on herself when<br/>
&gt; &gt; she grows up. (She plays tea party with my mom and<br/>
&gt; &gt; thier porcelain dolls...all feminine like...and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; says &quot;let me see if I have anymore. I&#39;ll be right<br/>
&gt; &gt; back, I&#39;m just going out to my truck.&quot;) And her<br/>
&gt; &gt; brother resented that suddenly all the dolls that used<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be his were suddenly assumed by everyone that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; were hers. He loves dolls.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; it has been shown that people even treat the<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; when the sex of the fetus is known.  So we will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; never be able to PROVE<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what is inherently female vs male behavior and what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is cultural.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; heard of one culture that has 6 words for gender.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924382466">&lt;&lt; Really, how often does someone actually get one of these diseases when <br/>
they <br/>
don&#39;t immunize their children.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AND, how often does a child with measles (and with no apparent spots, or else <br/>
I was sitting too far from the TV, too sick, near too much smoke) just lay <br/>
down and die from an inability to breathe?  First, the hospital had to tell <br/>
the parents it was measles. I&#39;ve seen measles; I&#39;ve had measles (TWICE as a <br/>
child, although they assure people once does it) and you can tell when you <br/>
have measles.  <br/>
<br/>
Now another thing I saw yesterday was The Grinch movie.  The mayor had had <br/>
his tonsils out twice! &lt;g&gt;   Holly asked what tonsils were.  I told her <br/>
they&#39;re a couple of little things in the throat that they used to cut out of <br/>
everybody, but now they don&#39;t.  I told her that the swollen place she had had <br/>
low under her chin (I touched the place) might have been one, but no problem <br/>
(the swelling went down in one day).  <br/>
<br/>
Mine were cut out when I was five.  Hooray for modern medicine.  I&#39;m SURE <br/>
they told my parents if they didn&#39;t consent I would die.  I&#39;m sure medical TV <br/>
shows in those days would&#39;ve had no compunction about showing a family <br/>
hesitating about a tonscilectomy and the kid dying without a whimper.   I <br/>
remember the ride to the emergency room at night.  I was standing in the back <br/>
seat of the car throwing up in to a basin in the front seat.  The next day I <br/>
was taken back, to a day clinic (I didn&#39;t spend the night either time), where <br/>
in a big prep room a nurse smiled, showed me a big piece of cheesecloth <br/>
folded up and said, &quot;Do you want to smell my perfume?&quot;  I nodded.   It was <br/>
ether.  I saw it coming and smelled the not-at-all-perfume, and all went <br/>
black.  That could&#39;ve been the last thing I ever saw, and it would have been <br/>
a lie from an expert who&#39;d scared my parents practically to death.<br/>
<br/>
Why would infected tonsils make a kid puke, y&#39;think?  Puking is a symptom of <br/>
tonscilitis?  <br/>
(Maybe it is, but it seems goofy to me.  If I was clear to puke my throat <br/>
wasn&#39;t swollen shut.)<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I have no opinion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

where the kid was at home due to a school shooting andhis parents were<br/>
afraid to let him go back.  It didn&#39;t make hs&#39;ing look like we now it to<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] ER and vaccinations<br/>
&gt;Date: Fri, 16 Feb 2001 07:37:28 -0500<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That is exactly what I came to the computer this morning to complain<br/>
&gt;about!!!!!!!  I was so upset.  I usually DO watch ER, but I probably won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;anymore.  It sounded like a public service anouncement. It made parents who<br/>
&gt;chose not immunize sound STUPID STUPID STUPID<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Really, how often does someone actually get one of these diseases when they<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t immunize their children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;doctor: &quot;rich people think only poor kids get immunized and they don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;to, if everyone stopped immunizing small pox would come back, polio...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;mother: &quot;But there&#39;s a link between vaccinations and autism.  Doctor:  <br/>
&gt;There<br/>
&gt;is no link!!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;mother: &quot;is my son going to be alright?&quot; doctor:  &quot;1 in 500 children with<br/>
&gt;measles die&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;and then of course there was a commercial during ER promoting some vaccine.<br/>
&gt;I think it was hepatitis.  It said &quot;1 and 10,000 people die from hep(?)&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The whole thing just infuriates.  The vacc. issue has been on my mind a lot<br/>
&gt;lately because my husband wants to go to school in the evenings but he is<br/>
&gt;required to take certain vacc. first, which is ridiculous considering that<br/>
&gt;the Army has already forced him to take SO many shots, including the flu<br/>
&gt;shot, and he most certainly have to take the anthrax shot before he goes to<br/>
&gt;Kosovo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I want to use the hourly daycare so that I can go to a doctor&#39;s appt.<br/>
&gt;(they will not allow children to accompany me during appt) then my kids&#39;<br/>
&gt;shot records have to be up to date.  So if I don&#39;t do that then how am I<br/>
&gt;supposed to get my teeth cleaned or whatever???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I mean, it&#39;s getting to where people can&#39;t make their own decisions<br/>
&gt;anymore!!!!  I thought this was a free country.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok.  I&#39;m done venting.  I was a little annoyed last night and I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt;annoyed.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Now, for hanging up, I hang them on the clothes horse<br/>
&gt; &gt;(or line) on the hanger already, that way they dry<br/>
&gt; &gt;straight, take up less space and go straight on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;rail when done!  Someone take me away, I&#39;ve gone<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can&#39;t think why.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pink color (I was going for bright red, but ..um...it<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, I&#39;m Bobbie, and I&#39;m a packrat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, there isn&#39;t a cure. Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; junk-free<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; books,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has won<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; come<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mom&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that pile<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; magazines<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ack!.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bathrooms<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; table in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pathways<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; music, etc..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tips<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>

&gt; &gt;type t. shirt <br/>
&gt; &gt;and then another tank top over that. If we go out she<br/>
&gt; &gt;then puts her <br/>
&gt; &gt;USA *yellow* (her favourite colour)jersey on. Even if<br/>
&gt; &gt;the sun is <br/>
&gt; &gt;really hot and blue skies and every body is sweating in<br/>
&gt; &gt;t.shirts. <br/>
&gt; &gt;She has her undies on with boxers over that and her<br/>
&gt; &gt;skirt on top of <br/>
&gt; &gt;those. knee length white socks with coloured stripes<br/>
&gt; &gt;around the top <br/>

&gt; &gt;I was the only one home, and I&#39;m sick, so I sat down to peel kindling and<br/>
&gt; &gt;watch TV, not knowing what was on.  I watched NBC, a couple of very lame<br/>
&gt; &gt;sitcoms and then E.R., which I had never ever seen before.  It seemed to <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt;AMA propaganda.  Doctors were always right, patients were idiots.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m hoping it wasn&#39;t typical of all their programs, but I&#39;ll try not to<br/>
&gt; &gt;watch<br/>
&gt; &gt;it anymore anyway.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Oh.  Playing with the bark from cedar.  It&#39;s easy to split, and the bark<br/>
&gt; &gt;has<br/>
&gt; &gt;about 30 layers, sometimes that can be stripped into really thin, curly<br/>
&gt; &gt;bits.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  It&#39;s a mindless sort of thing to do while I watch videos, but tonight I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt;too weak and brainless to find a video so I watched TV.   And filled up a<br/>
&gt; &gt;box<br/>
&gt; &gt;with easy-to-start tiny kindling.   I was creating excelsior, but am not<br/>
&gt; &gt;going to pack anything in it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also it&#39;s a good excuse to sit right at the hearth and play with the <br/>
&gt;fire.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I doubt Americans guessed any better than you did, Carol.  Sorry.  (My<br/>
&gt; &gt;friends and relatives would have known.  I give the stuff away to friends<br/>
&gt; &gt;with fireplaces, so they have something artsy to use instead of newspaper<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;start fires.  And I give it to them in ratty baskets I get from garage<br/>
&gt; &gt;sales.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  When the baskets get old they&#39;re kindling too.)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I am sooooo glad that I was raised by a family of liberated folks.  I had<br/>
&gt; &gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt;own hammer and saw before I was 5 and helped my dad work on motorcycles.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Of<br/>
&gt; &gt;course, my grandmother was the first to own a motorcycle in NY and there<br/>
&gt; &gt;were lots of other non-traditional folks in my family &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Eldest son (who will be 30 in November) still has some dolls (latest ones<br/>
&gt; &gt;are from that crocodile/nature show thingy) which he collects.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It was always a hoot to see the looks on the faces of folks that didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;know<br/>
&gt; &gt;him when they saw his room.  In the would tromp with my defensive lineman<br/>
&gt; &gt;son to the bedroom with the case of &quot;dolls&quot; and other collectibles like<br/>
&gt; &gt;Kermit and Chubacka (sp?).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We never put a his and hers on anything in our family!  Much more fun <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with that. That&#39;s all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It really chaps my hide when someone (well meaning, of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; course) hears me say something about something I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; want my son doing or something like that and says<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s just a boy thing. You won&#39;t be able to help it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right. And as for my daughter...she wants to be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; firefighter and a mommy and build houses and a dancer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and drive a white truck that she works on herself when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; she grows up. (She plays tea party with my mom and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thier porcelain dolls...all feminine like...and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; says &quot;let me see if I have anymore. I&#39;ll be right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back, I&#39;m just going out to my truck.&quot;) And her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; brother resented that suddenly all the dolls that used<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be his were suddenly assumed by everyone that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were hers. He loves dolls.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when the sex of the fetus is known.  So we will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never be able to PROVE<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is inherently female vs male behavior and what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is cultural.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heard of one culture that has 6 words for gender.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps we humans once needed to have men be<br/>

&gt; &gt;&#39;alien&#39; although there is a waiver form. Anyone know anyone who&#39;s used<br/>
&gt; &gt;it?<br/>

Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] ER and vaccinations<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That is exactly what I came to the computer this morning to complain<br/>
&gt; about!!!!!!!  I was so upset.  I usually DO watch ER, but I probably won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; anymore.  It sounded like a public service anouncement. It made parents<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; chose not immunize sound STUPID STUPID STUPID<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Really, how often does someone actually get one of these diseases when<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t immunize their children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; doctor: &quot;rich people think only poor kids get immunized and they don&#39;t<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to, if everyone stopped immunizing small pox would come back, polio...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; mother: &quot;But there&#39;s a link between vaccinations and autism.  Doctor:<br/>
There<br/>
&gt; is no link!!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; mother: &quot;is my son going to be alright?&quot; doctor:  &quot;1 in 500 children with<br/>
&gt; measles die&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and then of course there was a commercial during ER promoting some<br/>
vaccine.<br/>
&gt; I think it was hepatitis.  It said &quot;1 and 10,000 people die from hep(?)&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The whole thing just infuriates.  The vacc. issue has been on my mind a<br/>
lot<br/>
&gt; lately because my husband wants to go to school in the evenings but he is<br/>
&gt; required to take certain vacc. first, which is ridiculous considering that<br/>
&gt; the Army has already forced him to take SO many shots, including the flu<br/>
&gt; shot, and he most certainly have to take the anthrax shot before he goes<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; Kosovo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I want to use the hourly daycare so that I can go to a doctor&#39;s appt.<br/>
&gt; (they will not allow children to accompany me during appt) then my kids&#39;<br/>
&gt; shot records have to be up to date.  So if I don&#39;t do that then how am I<br/>
&gt; supposed to get my teeth cleaned or whatever???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I mean, it&#39;s getting to where people can&#39;t make their own decisions<br/>
&gt; anymore!!!!  I thought this was a free country.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok.  I&#39;m done venting.  I was a little annoyed last night and I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; annoyed.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Now, for hanging up, I hang them on the clothes horse<br/>
&gt; &gt;(or line) on the hanger already, that way they dry<br/>
&gt; &gt;straight, take up less space and go straight on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;rail when done!  Someone take me away, I&#39;ve gone<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pink color (I was going for bright red, but ..um...it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t work) it is currently growing out from its very<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, I&#39;m Bobbie, and I&#39;m a packrat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, there isn&#39;t a cure. Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; junk-free<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; books,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has won<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; come<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mom&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that pile<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; house?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; magazines<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ack!.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bathrooms<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; table in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pathways<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; music, etc..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tips<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I died my hair blue twice, during shcool hols.  This<br/>
&gt; &gt;supposed wash-in-wash-out stuff reacted with the perm<br/>
&gt; &gt;in my hair and went green.  The fairly strict private<br/>
&gt; &gt;school I was at never batted an eyelid, though I could<br/>
&gt; &gt;have said it was uniform colour...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Tracy<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My dd has a dress style all of her own. She wears a<br/>
&gt; &gt;crop top. Some <br/>
&gt; &gt;times a bra with a crop top over the top. A tank top<br/>
&gt; &gt;type t. shirt <br/>
&gt; &gt;and then another tank top over that. If we go out she<br/>
&gt; &gt;then puts her <br/>
&gt; &gt;USA *yellow* (her favourite colour)jersey on. Even if<br/>
&gt; &gt;the sun is <br/>
&gt; &gt;really hot and blue skies and every body is sweating in<br/>
&gt; &gt;t.shirts. <br/>
&gt; &gt;She has her undies on with boxers over that and her<br/>
&gt; &gt;skirt on top of <br/>
&gt; &gt;those. knee length white socks with coloured stripes<br/>
&gt; &gt;around the top <br/>
&gt; &gt;(dads) and her black sneakers. Some times she wears<br/>
&gt; &gt;her yellow polka <br/>
&gt; &gt;dot bandana on her head and/or her yellow scarf around<br/>
&gt; &gt;her <br/>
&gt; &gt;neck....... She wants to put a *pink* rinse through<br/>

&gt; &gt;I never thought of red food colouring!  My dd is olive skinned with<br/>
&gt; &gt;black hair, so not sure if it would work - but definetly alot cheaper<br/>
&gt; &gt;than hair dye.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My son from my first marriage, was born with ginger hair, he hated<br/>
&gt; &gt;it, so when he was 14yrs old he dyed it black, didnt like it put some<br/>
&gt; &gt;thing else on and ended up with GREEN hair!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am the absolute oposite to a pack rat -  I hate clutter and I<br/>

&gt; &gt;I was the only one home, and I&#39;m sick, so I sat down to peel kindling and<br/>
&gt; &gt;watch TV, not knowing what was on.  I watched NBC, a couple of very lame<br/>
&gt; &gt;sitcoms and then E.R., which I had never ever seen before.  It seemed to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt;AMA propaganda.  Doctors were always right, patients were idiots.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m hoping it wasn&#39;t typical of all their programs, but I&#39;ll try not to<br/>
&gt; &gt;watch<br/>
&gt; &gt;it anymore anyway.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Oh.  Playing with the bark from cedar.  It&#39;s easy to split, and the bark<br/>
&gt; &gt;has<br/>
&gt; &gt;about 30 layers, sometimes that can be stripped into really thin, curly<br/>
&gt; &gt;bits.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  It&#39;s a mindless sort of thing to do while I watch videos, but tonight I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt;too weak and brainless to find a video so I watched TV.   And filled up a<br/>
&gt; &gt;box<br/>
&gt; &gt;with easy-to-start tiny kindling.   I was creating excelsior, but am not<br/>
&gt; &gt;going to pack anything in it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also it&#39;s a good excuse to sit right at the hearth and play with the<br/>
fire.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I doubt Americans guessed any better than you did, Carol.  Sorry.  (My<br/>
&gt; &gt;friends and relatives would have known.  I give the stuff away to friends<br/>
&gt; &gt;with fireplaces, so they have something artsy to use instead of newspaper<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;start fires.  And I give it to them in ratty baskets I get from garage<br/>
&gt; &gt;sales.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  When the baskets get old they&#39;re kindling too.)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I am sooooo glad that I was raised by a family of liberated folks.  I had<br/>
&gt; &gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt;own hammer and saw before I was 5 and helped my dad work on motorcycles.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Of<br/>
&gt; &gt;course, my grandmother was the first to own a motorcycle in NY and there<br/>
&gt; &gt;were lots of other non-traditional folks in my family &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Eldest son (who will be 30 in November) still has some dolls (latest ones<br/>
&gt; &gt;are from that crocodile/nature show thingy) which he collects.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It was always a hoot to see the looks on the faces of folks that didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;know<br/>
&gt; &gt;him when they saw his room.  In the would tromp with my defensive lineman<br/>
&gt; &gt;son to the bedroom with the case of &quot;dolls&quot; and other collectibles like<br/>
&gt; &gt;Kermit and Chubacka (sp?).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We never put a his and hers on anything in our family!  Much more fun<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt;way otherwise mom wouldn&#39;t have gotten to race at Sears Point %-}<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with that. That&#39;s all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It really chaps my hide when someone (well meaning, of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; course) hears me say something about something I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; want my son doing or something like that and says<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s just a boy thing. You won&#39;t be able to help it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right. And as for my daughter...she wants to be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; firefighter and a mommy and build houses and a dancer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and drive a white truck that she works on herself when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; she grows up. (She plays tea party with my mom and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thier porcelain dolls...all feminine like...and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; says &quot;let me see if I have anymore. I&#39;ll be right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back, I&#39;m just going out to my truck.&quot;) And her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; brother resented that suddenly all the dolls that used<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be his were suddenly assumed by everyone that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were hers. He loves dolls.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never be able to PROVE<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is inherently female vs male behavior and what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is cultural.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heard of one culture that has 6 words for gender.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps we humans once needed to have men be<br/>

&gt; &gt;to see the embassy doc for a medical exam and explain why ky kids are<br/>
&gt; &gt;not immunised. It&#39;s one of the conditions for enetering the US as a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020091045">There is more than one kind of measles and lots of times roseola is<br/>
misdiagnosed as measles.<br/>
<br/>
As to the whole tonsils thing, I think it was one of those money makers.<br/>
And, no, generally speaking, tonsils don&#39;t cause puking.  Very sore throat,<br/>
fever, hard to swollow.  In fact, more kids died from the operation (figures<br/>
were at something like 10 x) than could ever be blamed on the tonsils!  They<br/>
also NOW think that the tonsils actually serve some purpose which I don&#39;t<br/>
remember the specs on as it crossed my desk about 10 years ago.  Blame it on<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; Really, how often does someone actually get one of these diseases when<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t immunize their children.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AND, how often does a child with measles (and with no apparent spots, or<br/>
else<br/>
&gt; I was sitting too far from the TV, too sick, near too much smoke) just lay<br/>
&gt; down and die from an inability to breathe?  First, the hospital had to<br/>
tell<br/>
&gt; the parents it was measles. I&#39;ve seen measles; I&#39;ve had measles (TWICE as<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; child, although they assure people once does it) and you can tell when you<br/>
&gt; have measles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now another thing I saw yesterday was The Grinch movie.  The mayor had had<br/>
&gt; his tonsils out twice! &lt;g&gt;   Holly asked what tonsils were.  I told her<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re a couple of little things in the throat that they used to cut out<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; everybody, but now they don&#39;t.  I told her that the swollen place she had<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; low under her chin (I touched the place) might have been one, but no<br/>
problem<br/>
&gt; (the swelling went down in one day).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mine were cut out when I was five.  Hooray for modern medicine.  I&#39;m SURE<br/>
&gt; they told my parents if they didn&#39;t consent I would die.  I&#39;m sure medical<br/>
TV<br/>
&gt; shows in those days would&#39;ve had no compunction about showing a family<br/>
&gt; hesitating about a tonscilectomy and the kid dying without a whimper.   I<br/>
&gt; remember the ride to the emergency room at night.  I was standing in the<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; seat of the car throwing up in to a basin in the front seat.  The next day<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was taken back, to a day clinic (I didn&#39;t spend the night either time),<br/>
where<br/>
&gt; in a big prep room a nurse smiled, showed me a big piece of cheesecloth<br/>
&gt; folded up and said, &quot;Do you want to smell my perfume?&quot;  I nodded.   It was<br/>
&gt; ether.  I saw it coming and smelled the not-at-all-perfume, and all went<br/>
&gt; black.  That could&#39;ve been the last thing I ever saw, and it would have<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; a lie from an expert who&#39;d scared my parents practically to death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why would infected tonsils make a kid puke, y&#39;think?  Puking is a symptom<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; tonscilitis?<br/>
&gt; (Maybe it is, but it seems goofy to me.  If I was clear to puke my throat<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t swollen shut.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than that, I have no opinion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
OH yes.  1986/87, the year Kirby was a baby, the pediatrician I was using <br/>
(private, high-priced, only partly covered by insurance, before I went to an <br/>
HMO that wouldn&#39;t have dreamed of doing tubes in ears in a conscious human, I <br/>
think) NEVER ceased trying to get me to approve tubes in ears.  I let him <br/>
tell me about them in detail, but I just said making a hole in a perfectly <br/>
sound eardrum sounded insane, and no.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby never even had an ear infection in his life, as far as I could tell.<br/>
<br/>
You know why he &quot;needed ear tubes&quot;?  When the doctor looked into his ear <br/>
canal, it was red in there.  You know why?   Kirby hated that doctor and used <br/>
to scream his head red every single time.  I said, &quot;Because he&#39;s crying, he&#39;s <br/>
red.  The doctor would say &quot;He must be in pain.&quot;  Yeah, uh-huh. <br/>
<br/>
Subsequent babies didn&#39;t have to suffer through so many routine doctor&#39;s <br/>
exams because I learned from that doctor (and a couple of others) that they <br/>
are truly looking for things that are wrong because they&#39;re afraid of being <br/>
sued if they miss something, and they don&#39;t make money when they say &quot;What a <br/>
healthy baby--don&#39;t come back until he&#39;s sick.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn&#39;t watched that show for the first time ever (E.R.) I would&#39;ve been <br/>
glossing over these messages as something that didn&#39;t apply to me, but like <br/>
astronauts looping around the moon to gain momentum, the mention on that show <br/>
is going to increase the volume of the pressure to immunize, and lots of <br/>
those who are parents helping other parents won&#39;t know where the increased <br/>
noise came from.<br/>

My daughter was diagnosed with ADHD. Symptons were &#39;inability to sit still
in class, asking quastions out of turn, fustrated tantrums, inattention
when teacher was droning on...&#39;
<br>I will admit that I did despair because her behaviour was appalling
from very young. If I hadn&#39;t been me I may have succumbed to the Ritalin
road but I went to a homeapath first and also removed all wheat, sugar
and junk from her diet. There were huge improvements in her behaviour.
Then I removed her from school which she found boring. Hey presto, a different
child.
<br>I&#39;m not knocking anyone who has difficuklties with a hyperactive child
but this does seem a very modern and at the moment US/UK phenomena. Also
knowing that the drug companies have a hand in drawing up the DSM (psychiatric
symptons bible) does make me a tad suspicious.
<br>I&#39;ve also watched people give their children highly coloured fizzy
pop and wonder why the wee lad can&#39;t sit still. Having drunk some I felt
odd and had the shakes like I&#39;d had too much coffee - who needs drugs when
you can have a slurpee :) -it just seems to me that drug companies need
problems.
<br>There is/was a case going through the US courts where the drug companies
are being accused of making up ADHD.
<br>Anyway, my rant over.

Well it&#39;s a re-naming of hyper-activity, which was not a disease.  There&#39;s <br/>
some big list of mental health disorders which psychologists use.  They have <br/>
numbers.  Some of them are a scream!!  Does anyone know of a list of these <br/>
online?  So you  need to have a real disorder with a number for insurance to <br/>
cover the visits, or whatever.  Some reason undoubtedly having to do with <br/>
finances.  Making it a disorder makes it *real.*<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always thought of hyper activity as the boredom of those who need to <br/>
move.  I&#39;d rather see (or be) hyperactivity than slugdom anytime, but that&#39;s <br/>
just me.<br/>

No.   I&#39;ve always been where they let the whole family in for most of the <br/>
visit.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Depends on the insurance. The doctors must be paid.  If a person has no <br/>
insurance they pay directly, or they apply for the state to pay for it (or <br/>
part of it)--that varies from place to place.  Indigency funds, or low-income <br/>
exemptions, or whatever.  They&#39;ll be called different things.<br/>
<br/>
There are HMOs (health maintenance organizations) where you buy kind of a <br/>
membership to the chain of hospitals, and if you get sick you have to go to <br/>
one of their places.  We&#39;re in one of those.  We still pay $5 or $10 per <br/>
visit, and $10 for a prescription, but that&#39;s a flat rate regardless of <br/>
whether it would have been $18 or $100 otherwise.  And if the prescription <br/>
would have been $8 we still pay $10 &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
There are insurance companies which will pay a percentage of your costs, <br/>
regardless of which doctor, but those seem to be on the decline, and HMOs are <br/>
on the rise.<br/>
