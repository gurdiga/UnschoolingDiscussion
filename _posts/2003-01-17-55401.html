<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917343417">Hi, Folks.  I hope you don&#39;t mind this OT question for anyone who lives in <br/>
or around Washington, DC.  I&#39;m going to Washington tomorrow to attend the <br/>
march and rally.  I was wondering if a lot of snow fell in that vicinity <br/>
yesterday.  I know it&#39;s going to be mighty cold tomorrow, but I was <br/>
wondering if it&#39;s going to be messy, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

15 below zero tonight; that should make it feel right balmy in D.C.!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966299315">I am new to the reality of unschooling but I have been an unschool wanna-be<br/>
for years. I have homeschooled in a mainstream sense for the past 8 years. I<br/>
have read the reasoning behind the un-schooling model and understand the<br/>
freedom it offers an individual learning to be a whole person.<br/>

How do you get past the natural instincts to want to protect your kids from<br/>
what you have been led to believe is a taboo?  Or maybe you really feel like<br/>
it may hinder them later in life.<br/>
<br/>
This probably seems trivial but my 19 year old had a tattoo put on his arm<br/>
as a form of &quot;self expression&quot; on his 18th birthday and now my ds2 who<br/>
turned 18 today wants to do the same thing. I imagine my 14 and 11 year olds<br/>
will follow suit as well now.<br/>
<br/>
Why does this bug me so much and what can I read to help me let go of the<br/>
control drug that continues to permeate my mind?<br/>

&lt;&lt; How do you get past the natural instincts to want to protect your kids from<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t get past it.  I just don&#39;t allow myself to live their lives for them.<br/>
<br/>
You can express yourself about it.  You can say &quot;Wait until you&#39;re 18, okay?&quot; <br/>
and they can say, &quot;Okay&quot; because they love you.<br/>
<br/>
Keith told Holly he didn&#39;t want her to get her ears pierced, but that they <br/>
were her ears.  She thought about it for months, and talked to him another <br/>
couple of times about WHY he doesn&#39;t like pierced ears, and talked to other <br/>
people.  <br/>
<br/>
She decided to get them pierced, a couple of years ago.  They&#39;ve never healed <br/>
well.  Even if she goes without earrings for a long time they stay oozy.  She <br/>
has tried hypo-allergenic and surgical steel.  Hasn&#39;t tried gold, didn&#39;t want <br/>
to spend the money on it.    She kinda regrets the piercing, but not totally. <br/>
 And Keith hasn&#39;t said &quot;told you so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This probably seems trivial but my 19 year old had a tattoo put on his arm<br/>
as a form of &quot;self expression&quot; on his 18th birthday and now my ds2 who<br/>
turned 18 today wants to do the same thing. I imagine my 14 and 11 year olds<br/>
will follow suit as well now.&gt;&gt;&gt;...<br/>
<br/>
Well he waited until 18.  Why?  <br/>
<br/>
Did it on his birthday.  Why?<br/>
<br/>
You mean the 14 and 11 year olds will want to do it when they&#39;re 18?<br/>
Would they be less likely to do it at all if you said &quot;Hey, get one now if <br/>
you want&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If they didn&#39;t know you think they&#39;re bad, would they have been less likely <br/>
to want to express themselves so permanently?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why does this bug me so much and what can I read to help me let go of the<br/>
control drug that continues to permeate my mind?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just think about why you do NOT have a tattoo.  <br/>
And you still don&#39;t have one, even if the rest of them get twelve apiece.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582802056">I had to reply to this, yes I had those feelings many times.<br/>
My oldest who is a girl, did everything right, almost<br/>
too right.  When her brother reached 14, she told me<br/>
to cut him some slack, and not hold him down as much<br/>
as I held her. And so, with a bad taste, I changed my way<br/>
of parenting, and cut him alot more slack.<br/>
He is a very good kid, of course, public schooled all the way.<br/>
There are things I don&#39;t approve of, and wish I could wave<br/>
that magic wand,  I think I misplaced somewhere. lol<br/>
He didn&#39;t only go for one ear pierced, he has both.<br/>
I thought the joke would be on him, when the first would<br/>
start to hurt, and he would say forget this! and take it out.<br/>
Oh, no...he had no problems what so ever.<br/>
<br/>
My sanity lies in the fact that these children could being doing<br/>
much worse, and thank the lord, for guiding them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443880087">Years ago, before 3 of the 4 children, Joe and I were throwing around both <br/>
getting tattoos. We lived next door ot a guy who did them and from what I <br/>
saw of his artwork, he was great. We were both just discussing and tossing <br/>
around ideas and places where to put them!<br/>
<br/>
I came home from work one day to have Joe show me his upper arm. He had this <br/>
huge wolf on it. I had never seen a tatto freshly done and the look of it <br/>
was unreal. I laughed and told him to go and wash it off. I thought it was <br/>
one of the ugliest things I had ever seen. When he told me it was real, I <br/>
must admit I cried. All of a sudden this gorgeous arm on my guy was ruined <br/>
with a wolf that looked like he was wiggin!! I was very upset and then of <br/>
course, so was Joe. The next day I was on the phone inquiring about removal. <br/>
Very costly to have removed what he had done.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward about 11 years later. Joe still has a tatto although he went <br/>
and had it fixed. It&#39;s now a tiger and I have no problems with it anymore. I <br/>
freaked out over something I had no right to freak out about. It wasn&#39;t my <br/>
body and he didn&#39;t need my permission to go and have it done. It never <br/>
caused any problems of any kind and really, is no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Tara had her ears pierced the first time when she was about 7. I don&#39;t <br/>
automatically do that when the girls are born. They decide to have it or <br/>
not. Tara now has her ears pierced three times each. She asked ahead of time <br/>
and I had no problem with it. I&#39;ve seen her through her dark period when all <br/>
the clothing was black and her makeup was also color coordinated!<br/>
<br/>
She wanted her belly button pierced at 13. I wasn&#39;t sure at the time what I <br/>
thought so I said she had to get permission from her dad. (not my husband) <br/>
Something like that I do need to have his okay on or else if he wanted, we <br/>
could have trouble. Of course he said no and to be honest, I was off the <br/>
hook. Well she brought it up again when she was 15. Obviously something she <br/>
hadn&#39;t forgotten about. She had grown into and incredible young lady and <br/>
when I really thought about it, what was the big deal??? So again, I told <br/>
her she had to have her dad say okay, but I helped her work on him. &lt;BG&gt; In <br/>
the meantime, we went through where we would go, and exactly what would <br/>
happen in the process. She knew if it was a hassle, she could remove it. SHe <br/>
still wanted to get it done, I convinced her dad and off we went. Tara, me <br/>
and Joe. SHe got her belly button pierced while I held her hand and Joe was <br/>
in the other room getting the wolf made into a tiger!!<br/>
<br/>
The belly button looks adorable and now she wants a tattoo. SHe&#39;s been <br/>
talking about a small one for years also. I have no problem with that <br/>
either, but it is definitely something her dad will not give permission for. <br/>
So she knows she&#39;ll have to wait until she&#39;s 18. She&#39;s got another year. If <br/>
she still wants to, Joe said he would take her.<br/>
<br/>
I see when I don&#39;t limit her choices, she actually makes very good <br/>
decisions. Even if one if adverse to piercings and tattoos, I can&#39;t see <br/>
where Tara&#39;s choices offend. She works with many young adults who have <br/>
different colored hair and face piercings and tattoos. It hasn&#39;t seemed to <br/>
hinder them from working. Possibly they might not get a certain job they may <br/>
want later in life, but I somehow think it won&#39;t bother them much or they <br/>
will find a way around it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058101816">Hi, Shyrley!  I&#39;m comin&#39; down there on a bus from Warwick, New York with <br/>
the local Women In Black group, so, as you can imagine, I&#39;m gonna be <br/>
dressed in all black (and lots of it in layers, too,  to protect from the <br/>
frigid weather).  Owing to the cold weather, Liam has decided he&#39;d rather <br/>
stay home, and I think it was a good choice, although he wants to get up <br/>
with me at 4 in the morning so he can help me get ready.  What a guy!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re going!  I&#39;ll keep my eyes open for your hat and Heather&#39;s <br/>
camo jacket.  See you in D.C.<br/>
<br/>
Marji, preparin&#39; for a chillin!<br/>
