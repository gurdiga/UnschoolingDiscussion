<div id="ygrps-yiv-443733196">And if you do, do you celebrate that event? (Diploma of any kind, ceremony, party, dinner <br/>
out for recognition of high school completion...)<br/>
<br/>
What does graduation mean to you or your kids? How do you determine that your child has <br/>
crossed that threshhold? (Do you actually assign credits and use a guideline from a school <br/>
or do you simply choose an age and call it the end or some other way of evaluating?) Does <br/>
it matter to either your kids or you?<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t offer any kind of homeschool diploma or graduation, would you share your <br/>
thinking about that and offer another perspective?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360240975">Thank you. This is somewhat what I expected to hear and I needed to hear it spelled out. <br/>
We have had a combination of schooling (as you know) and have only unschooled in <br/>
earnest for a year. Perhaps the best way to handle it is to ask him what he wants. When I <br/>
added up credits, I found that he (as a mid year junior technically) is only 1 and a half <br/>
credits from &quot;graduation&quot; as far as schools go. What he &quot;needs&quot; is stuff he&#39;s already doing <br/>
on his own so there won&#39;t be any trouble completing those credits (if we are going to go <br/>
that route). But I found myself wondering whether it would be meaningful for him or not.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest change for us in the last few weeks is that he has become clearer about what <br/>
his future employment will be and is working hard on that (video gaming) now. He <br/>
dropped a class, dropped a sport and is giving lots of time to computers and learning <br/>
Klingon. :)<br/>
<br/>
We are invited to a graduation planning meeting for next year for his peer group of <br/>
homeschoolers and it got me thinking about whether that is even relevant for him. I <br/>
wondered if closure of any kind is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! (I&#39;d be interested in other opinions as well.)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This has been on my mind a lot lately, and I&#39;d like to hear others&#39; opinions <br/>
too.  NY state requires that you list a grade level for your kid each year.  <br/>
This year Emily (15yo) is listed as a senior.  She has unschooled in academics <br/>
for the last 5 years, but the year before that she attended ps in 7th grade at <br/>
10yo.  <br/>
<br/>
We have always loosely categorized what she does into subjects for school <br/>
district paperwork.  I consider her an *adult* in our home, and she is very <br/>
mature for her age.  She really wants some kind of recognition for graduation.  We <br/>
do not know of any other unschoolers in our area, and all the school-at-homers <br/>
we know make a big deal out of graduation.  (Caps and gown, diplomas, <br/>
parties, presents)  Emily doesn&#39;t want to be left out, but she also realizes that we <br/>
don&#39;t see learning as something that you graduate from.  (although I&#39;d be <br/>
happy to celebrate no more state paperwork for her &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I want to do something big for her this year because this is what she <br/>
wants...but I don&#39;t want to set a precedent of thinking that graduation is a <br/>
big deal in my other, entirely unschooled, children.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to detach your celebration from a &quot;graduation&quot; point of view, <br/>
turning 16 (which I assume she will be doing this year) in a great time to <br/>
celebrate a young lady&#39;s life achievements.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest had a sweet 16 party, a very formal affair (because she likes that <br/>
sort of thing), engraved invitations a sit down dinner in the ball room at the <br/>
Officers Club at Quantico, very formal, very Sarah like.  She had about 100 <br/>
friends and family and she had a GREAT time, the kids danced the night away and <br/>
she said she felt like a princess.<br/>
<br/>
Each family member said a certain something about a particular year in her <br/>
life and lit a candle in remembrance of that year, and then Sarah lit the last <br/>
candle because she was lighting the path to her uncharted future with all the <br/>
loved ones and friends surrounding her and supporting her on her journey.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest girl turns 16 this year, we are still in the planning stages.  <br/>
She LOVED Sarah&#39;s party, but she&#39;s exploring other options.  When she decides, <br/>
I&#39;ll make it happen for her.<br/>
<br/>
If your child is older, you can still do a celebration of the child&#39;s life, <br/>
just because you are happy they are your child and a part of your family.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest boy who went to public school sporadically during high school and <br/>
left in Oct. of what would have been his 12 year, expressed some regrets about <br/>
not getting a diploma.  ( probably more of a regret that he saw lots of cash <br/>
and checks coming in the mail to the younger boy who was graduating from public <br/>
school).<br/>
<br/>
So for his 21st birthday, we planned a big trip to Myrtle Beach, SC, fishing, <br/>
the beach, all the things he liked.  We had a house with lots of friends and <br/>
family, we were celebrating Matthew&#39;s importance in our life with friends and <br/>
family.  On our last night there, his father and I took him to dinner and I <br/>
gave him a &quot;diploma&quot;.  I ordered it offline.  You could make them yourself, but <br/>
this was an official signed with a seal and presented in a leather folder, <br/>
just like the public school ones.  It had his name and date and my name as <br/>
administrator and his dad&#39;s as principal.  He loved it.  The two small laminated <br/>
cards have come in handy when for jobs he&#39;s had to show he&#39;s a high school <br/>
graduate (but not according to our State).<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of ways to celebrate our children, probably just asking your <br/>
child some questions will point you in the right direction, unless it&#39;s a child <br/>
like my Cait who changes her mind every other week!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I guess I need to add that none of these celebrations that we&#39;ve had <br/>
for our children made them feel like it was time to leave home.  They know I <br/>
would not be celebrating them leaving.  Even though to my kids it was a joyous <br/>
time when the two older ones moved out on their own, and I WAS happy FOR them, <br/>
I was VERY sad for me, certainly not in a party throwing kind of mood!<br/>
<br/>
best of luck as you decide.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753148172">Huh!  Someone asked for something I had saved, and this happened to be in <br/>
that file, from 13 months ago:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I were out grocery shopping, and talking about Kirby turning<br/>
seventeen this year. I said I used to want to have a big eighteenth birthday<br/>
celebration for him, like a graduation, but I no longer want to do that. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to declare an end to his learning, nor to his living with us if he<br/>
wants to stay. Keith said he had no ideas either, but that was fine. Said<br/>
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to get him drunk and take him to a whorehouse, so<br/>
there&#39;s probably going to be no rite of passage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby wouldn&#39;t want any of that anyway. ANOTHER good thing. When he turns<br/>
eighteen, he&#39;ll have more legal rights, but there won&#39;t be the effect of huge<br/>
tension released. He&#39;ll have no restrictions suddenly lifted.<br/>

<br/>
Can you share more about how your kids have gone off to college gradually? And working <br/>
too? This is something I can see happening in some way, but I am trying to wrap my mind <br/>
around it. There are cautions from every quarter about how students will not finish if they <br/>
don&#39;t start with a full load and that scholarship moneys aren&#39;t avaialbe to part time <br/>
students. etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
But the idea of one or two classes at a time really appeals to me. I&#39;m in grad school one <br/>
class at a time and am loving it for that reason! I&#39;m LEARNING! (Instead of cramming)<br/>
<br/>
So how is it working for your kids? Any insights, observations would be appreciated.<br/>

Hi.  Who needs scholarship money when by using the credit-by-<br/>
examination, internship, portfolio presentation, and other non-<br/>
traditional college options, one can earn a fully accredited four-<br/>
year college degree for under $5,000, in less than two years?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;But the idea of one or two classes at a time really appeals to me. <br/>
I&#39;m in grad school one class at a time and am loving it for that <br/>
reason! I&#39;m LEARNING! (Instead of cramming)&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But is most of that learning going on in the classroom, or during the <br/>
time you are reading and studying and researching, thinking, on your <br/>
own?  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&gt;So how is it working for your kids? Any insights, observations <br/>
would be appreciated.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter who is 16 is using credit-by-examination right now, <br/>
planning to earn about 30 college credits before she has reached the <br/>
age when the state can&#39;t regulate her (beyond compulsory attendance <br/>
age).  She is working on taking the five CLEP exams this spring, then<br/>
has plans for some AP and some DANTES (DSST) exams next year.  Then <br/>
she might just go on to work and study independently to take GRE <br/>
exams which can earn from 3-30 college credits each.  In the meantime <br/>
she is now the sole teen at an adult ceramics studio, working on her <br/>
designs and skills, is starting drawing classes at a wonderful studio <br/>
nearby, and is working on jewelry making skills with two individuals <br/>
we know.  Since her college major was to be in art she feels she is <br/>
already doing what she wants and is less and less inclined to &quot;go to&quot; <br/>
college.  <br/>
<br/>
Last summer, at 15, she was accepted in and granted a scholarship to <br/>
attend a pre-college program at Earlham College where she earned <br/>
college credit for a raku ceramics course there.  She loved this <br/>
course and the college and was very gung-ho about going there.  She <br/>
still loves this college, but time and her experiences with credit-by-<br/>
examination have given her some perspective.  She now questions <br/>
whether sitting around in classrooms and spending four years of her <br/>
life in the small college town where Earlham is located, or in any <br/>
other college town, is what she really wants to do.  <br/>
<br/>
She knows she has other options, and some very good options, too.  <br/>
And she also knows she can do what she wants, have a great deal more <br/>
freedom, for much less money, if she writes her own ticket.  She will <br/>
end up with a college degree, but she may choose to do it &quot;her way.&quot; <br/>
At this point she is getting lots of pressure from friends who each <br/>
want her to go where they are going; to Earlham, to a good art <br/>
school, to a college in Boston, or to a college near where we live.  <br/>
But she is getting more convinced that she doesn&#39;t want to do any of <br/>
those things, but rather to put together her own package, combining <br/>
credit-by-examination, independent study and internships, portfolio <br/>
presentations, private instruction, and perhaps a few on-campus <br/>
courses here and there, if she finds some she can&#39;t resist.  She is <br/>
also using MIT&#39;s Open Course Ware courses for some independent study <br/>
work.  So many options, so little time!  <br/>
<br/>
I am impressed that she has pulled this together all by herself, and <br/>
is forming her own package, just as she has done with the rest of her <br/>
education.  This will give her much more freedom to be who she is and <br/>
to do all the things she loves, not just a few while she is busy <br/>
filling required course work at some high-priced college.  The most <br/>
impressive thing of all is that her independent decisions have now <br/>
drifted over to her dad who is thinking of getting paralegal <br/>
credentials, on his own.  Now that&#39;s real &quot;child-led&quot; learning, with <br/>
the child leading the way, being the role model, and the parent <br/>
following!  <br/>

in my field of sutdy and felt I hit a wall in my thinking. Having classroom lectures from <br/>
scholars in the field as well as the in-class check and balance of discussion and cross-<br/>
experiences has taken me to the next level. I&#39;ve benefitted greatly from my instructors <br/>
expertise and also their challenges to my thinking. My reading and study at home have <br/>
become far more meaningful as a result.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t trade this experience for anything.<br/>

It&#39;s the very reason I *didn&#39;t* do an online MA and opted for the in-class sort. I also <br/>
appreciate the the university I chose is reputable in its field. The professors are truly gifts <br/>
in my life.  <br/>
<br/>
What I like better in my graduate program than undergraduate studies is the pace is more <br/>
reasonable, I&#39;m focused on a narrower field of study and the valuable interaction of <br/>
professors and students.<br/>

&gt; exams which can earn from 3-30 college credits each.  In the meantime <br/>
&gt; she is now the sole teen at an adult ceramics studio, working on her <br/>
&gt; designs and skills, is starting drawing classes at a wonderful studio <br/>
&gt; nearby, and is working on jewelry making skills with two individuals <br/>
&gt; we know.  Since her college major was to be in art she feels she is <br/>
&gt; already doing what she wants and is less and less inclined to &quot;go to&quot; <br/>
&gt; college. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can really see this. She sounds like she has a clear idea of who she is and how to get to <br/>
where she wants to go.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But she is getting more convinced that she doesn&#39;t want to do any of <br/>
&gt; those things, but rather to put together her own package, combining <br/>
&gt; credit-by-examination, independent study and internships, portfolio <br/>
&gt; presentations, private instruction, and perhaps a few on-campus <br/>
&gt; courses here and there, if she finds some she can&#39;t resist.  She is <br/>
&gt; also using MIT&#39;s Open Course Ware courses for some independent study <br/>
&gt; work.  So many options, so little time!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I am impressed that she has pulled this together all by herself, and <br/>
&gt; is forming her own package, just as she has done with the rest of her <br/>
&gt; education.  This will give her much more freedom to be who she is and <br/>
&gt; to do all the things she loves, not just a few while she is busy <br/>
&gt; filling required course work at some high-priced college.  The most <br/>
&gt; impressive thing of all is that her independent decisions have now <br/>
&gt; drifted over to her dad who is thinking of getting paralegal <br/>
&gt; credentials, on his own.  Now that&#39;s real &quot;child-led&quot; learning, with <br/>
&gt; the child leading the way, being the role model, and the parent <br/>
&gt; following!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t that cool? thanks for sharing a vision of what the alternative may look like. I <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958151788">At 13, almost 14, Roya applied to Cypress Community College under their <br/>
&quot;Concurrent Enrollment&quot; program. She had to have her school sign the <br/>
form saying she could &quot;benefit from college level work.&quot; I signed it.<br/>
<br/>
She took a voice class. She&#39;s a singin&#39; kid and a voice class was great <br/>
for a first class for her. I scoped out the teacher in advance (just <br/>
looked at the schedule, went to one of her classes and stood outside <br/>
the door for a while, listening). She had a great experience and the <br/>
next semester did the same thing, but added a psychology class. Then <br/>
she joined the debate team and a performance singing group. And took a <br/>
ceramics course. Each semester we had to reapply for the &quot;concurrent <br/>
enrollment&quot; program. She took ceramics every semester - including <br/>
summer. When she was 16 her ceramics instructor suggested her for a job <br/>
opening at Laguna Clay Company, and she was hired. She worked on <br/>
Saturdays only for a while, but eventually they wanted her to work more <br/>
hours and gave her increasing responsibilities. She worked there for a <br/>
couple of years, branched out at the community college, taking pretty <br/>
much whatever caught her fancy.<br/>
<br/>
At almost 19, she took one semester off, quit her job, spent all her <br/>
savings traveling around the country for 6 months.<br/>
<br/>
Now she&#39;s back, taking a full course load including Spanish, Marine <br/>
Biology, and Math, filling in the general education requirements she <br/>
needs to transfer to a University of California campus. She&#39;s got a job <br/>
in the college ceramics lab, just 10 hours per week. When she completes <br/>
her general ed requirements, during the summer, she is planning to take <br/>
off a full year, this time, before transferring to a University as a <br/>
junior.<br/>
<br/>
My second daughter also took a voice class as her first course, at 14, <br/>
then the following couple of semesters took voice as well as some <br/>
computer classes. She also took a history of opera course. Her primary <br/>
involvement at the college has been to audition for and get parts in <br/>
their musicals and taking theater courses. She is now 16 and is taking <br/>
tap dancing and musical theater techniques this semester.<br/>
<br/>
My third daughter is now 13 and currently has no interest in community <br/>
college courses - she is very involved with 4H, soccer, Girl Scouts, <br/>
and her Dungeons and Dragons games. If she starts college early and <br/>
gets into it gradually, it&#39;ll probably be by taking dance classes, to <br/>
start with.<br/>

&lt;&gt;Oh definitely in the classroom. I had been learning independently <br/>
for the last three years in my field of sutdy and felt I hit a wall <br/>
in my thinking. Having classroom lectures from scholars in the field <br/>
as well as the in-class check and balance of discussion and cross-<br/>
experiences has taken me to the next level. I&#39;ve benefitted greatly <br/>
from my instructors expertise and also their challenges to my <br/>
thinking. My reading and study at home have become far more <br/>
meaningful as a result. I wouldn&#39;t trade this experience for <br/>
anything.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Julie:<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s great if you are finding classes satisfying, even inspiring.  <br/>
I look back on my years in undergrad and grad school and find that <br/>
the most memorable experiences and the ones that have stuck with me <br/>
for 30-40 years of my life after college, were the experiences I had <br/>
outside the classroom.  These included my volunteer involvement in <br/>
groups, in political action, in specific interests I developed on my <br/>
own, in jobs I took to earn money.  I could recall only a handful of <br/>
classroom situations that were significant for me, in the long run.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&gt;What I like better in my graduate program than undergraduate <br/>
studies is the pace is more reasonable, I&#39;m focused on a narrower <br/>
field of study and the valuable interaction of professors and <br/>
students.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I like best about doing certain studies on my own, for jobs that <br/>
I took, is that the pace was realistic, was real life based, not <br/>
class or semester based.  For example, I supported myself for years <br/>
as a journalist, though I never took a single journalism course in <br/>
high school or college.  But I knew I could write.  So when I applied <br/>
for a job in journalism I simply submitted some sample articles and <br/>
took whatever assignments they gave me, learning by the seat of my <br/>
pants, bridging the manual typewriter age into the computer and IT <br/>
age during my career.  The best lesson I learned about journalism was <br/>
that nothing mattered more, in most cases, than the amount of space <br/>
that my story would be allowed to take in the publication.  The <br/>
deciding element was column inches or word count over content most of <br/>
the time.  Even if the story was about life and death.  And I learned <br/>
to meet deadlines while brutally chopping down and editing my own <br/>
copy to fit the space the editor was willing to give me.  I learned <br/>
that I could do interviews over the phone or over the internet, but <br/>
that the in-person interview was almost always much better for me, <br/>
that I could sometimes get three different stories/sales out of an in-<br/>
person interview.    <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;I can really see this. She sounds like she has a clear idea of who <br/>
she is and how to get to where she wants to go.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, clear for today, and ever-changing, adapting, adjusting to new <br/>
information.  My daughter also works and has found she learns a great <br/>
deal in each job she has taken, if only that she has narrowed down <br/>
her fields of interest by eliminating those that just don&#39;t appeal to <br/>
her at all when she is really out there working in that field.  She <br/>
has learned a great deal about workplace politics and dealing with <br/>
supervisory and subordinate workplace personnel, and accompanying <br/>
stresses, life lessons that will stay with her.  She has observed <br/>
that many of the problems with any career are people problems, not <br/>
the work itself.  These are important lessons for anyone.  She has <br/>
discovered that the same work, done in different places, can be very <br/>
different, as far as enjoyment and job satisfaction go.  And she has <br/>
learned that many work skills are best learned on-the-job.  But then <br/>
she is more right-brained than left, and more kinesthetic, learning <br/>
by doing, than auditory or visual.  So different strokes for <br/>
different folks, right?<br/>

       To me formal study, especially by the graduate school level, is meant <br/>
to integrate with all the other influences on your thinking and your life. The <br/>
better it is, the harder it is to tell what difference it made. It&#39;s <br/>
interactive and personal. Like unschooling! :)<br/>
<br/>
       Maybe it&#39;s because I was always studying something or other formally, <br/>
at the same time I was having my life. But that&#39;s how I see it, and how I hope <br/>
my unschooling kids will see it looking back. :)  JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803001385">Suggestions for budding artists:<br/>
<br/>
Enter county shows with them, homemaking fairs, let others see her talent.<br/>
What about apprenticeing with an artist? What about the painting lessons at<br/>
like Hobby Lobby?<br/>
<br/>
My 86yo grandmother is an artist.  She taught herself through correspondence<br/>
courses (she was the wife of a ranch hand and they always lived way out in<br/>
the boonies)and later through that guy on PBS.  Eventually, she took a class<br/>
here or there.<br/>
<br/>
Now Granny supports herself giving lessons, selling her paintings and doing<br/>
custom work.  She has painted backgrounds for museums, even the side of a<br/>
tour bus for a country singer.<br/>
<br/>
I love going to her house because you find little pieces of magic<br/>
everywhere.  Her bathroom in her studio has wood paneling.  She knocked out<br/>
one of the knotholes and put a picture of an eye back there.  You are<br/>
sitting on the pot and suddenly become aware of this eye looking at you<br/>
through the hole.  Lots of first timers come out squealing.<br/>
<br/>
She painted a beautiful mountain scene in the window panes of her garage.<br/>
She painted her toilet so it looks like marble.  One time she got bored and<br/>
painted her pickup with a brush.  You just never know and I love that about<br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to your daughter.<br/>

Yes, this has been the process that my older three have taken - not so much with speciific course or career goals in mind but by  investigating options and courses of interest. They didn&#39; t do this all by themsleves - still don&#39; t - as with many things here it became a co-operative  effort - I would see items in the newspaper or online about alternative entry to uni and pass it on; someone else would tell of a possible volunteer or paid position that was opening up. That sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39; t know if our direct experiences would be of use to you, Julie, as we live in Australia and the part time and external study options are pretty much accepted here - with the fee deferrment scheme applicable to all these options. My older boys have elcted to do a number of their courses externally or online, where possible,  as it fits their personal rhythms ( sleep in late!) and their paid work/volunteer work schedules....Leonie<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was truer for me after my undergread studies in my twenties. I have a hunch that <br/>
hormones play too big a role in undergraduate programs. learning about love and <br/>
sexuality is far more compelling than West African tbial warfare histories, kwim? :)<br/>
<br/>
But as a grad student in my forties, I&#39;m so appreciative of the scholarship of those who&#39;ve <br/>
put in years of learning so that they can unpack the information and findings in their field <br/>
in a meaningful way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
hese included my volunteer involvement in <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; groups, in political action, in specific interests I developed on my <br/>
&gt; &gt; own, in jobs I took to earn money.  I could recall only a handful of <br/>
&gt; &gt; classroom situations that were significant for me, in the long run.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is sad to me and yet also, I understand it too. It&#39;s the reason so many of us unschool. <br/>
We don&#39;t have positive classroom learning experiences to draw on.<br/>
<br/>
I still contend that teaching combined with the ability to study for oneself is the most <br/>
effective way to learn (whether that learning comes through a terrific coach in baseball, <br/>
throwing pots with a professional cermaics artist or going to grad school in a good <br/>
program).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; contributed what to who I am today. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how I feel about it. And I honestly find the routine of meeting weekly and working <br/>
through a progression of materials helpful. I was learning a lot on my own, but I started <br/>
finding that all those I spoke with (I read lots of books with others on line) agreed with <br/>
me... and that wasn&#39;t enough. I knew there were whole schools and disciplines of thought <br/>
associated with my field of study that I couldn&#39;t uncover on my own, wouldn&#39;t discover on <br/>
my own.<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps that&#39;s what makes grad school so satisfying. And it helps that the other <br/>
students enjoy being there and come to class prepared (unlike most undergraduate <br/>
programs).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;        To me formal study, especially by the graduate school level, is meant <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly! One of the ideological dangers (imo) of unschooling is to be suspicious of all <br/>
education conducted by teachers. But it seems to me that whether we self-educate use a <br/>
tutor do an apprenticeship or take a college course, the goal is the subject evaluation of <br/>

You obviously never tried to sit through a required class that spent <br/>
ten weeks exclusively on &quot;The Rape of the Lock,&quot; by Alexander Pope.  <br/>
Suffice it to say that I cannot remember a single line from that <br/>
poem.  The good news is that this class convinced me that I was <br/>
definitely in the wrong graduate program and I switched from English <br/>
Literature to Philosopohy the next session.<br/>
<br/>
My test of what counted is what I remember. I can remember tiny <br/>
little details from jobs I held in high school, details that have <br/>
stuck with me for 40+ years since.  I remember hours and hours spent <br/>
in the law library doing high school debate team research.  But I can <br/>
only remember a few lectures from college, and very few instructors, <br/>
by name or by anything significant they imparted to me.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I vividly recall trying to go over a jump on my <br/>
horse, blindfolded, bareback, with my arms folded in front of me at <br/>
13.  I remember my jumping instructor&#39;s face and voice very well, and <br/>
that was 45 years ago.  I remember ski instructors from that same <br/>
period and how they taught me to challenge gravity by leaning down <br/>
the slope.  I remember art and my art teacher from elementary <br/>
school.  I remember weaving at my harness loom in the basement of one <br/>
of my grade school buildings, a reward granted when we completed our <br/>
work quickly.  I remember my debate coach from high school, and one <br/>
literature teacher who did some amazing things to inspire a lifelong <br/>
love of Shakespeare.  I remember my high school algebra teacher who <br/>
threw the book at me, literally, all the way across the room.  I also <br/>
remember being stunned to learn that I had scored in the 97th <br/>
percentile on mathematical aptitude in college after being convinced <br/>
by this algebra teacher that I was a total loser at math.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember some Sanskrit poetry from an undergrad course on <br/>
comparative literature.  I remember one education psychology speaker <br/>
who stood on the table and spoke about how he&#39;d been designated as <br/>
having an IQ two points above a rock, basically, but had, through his <br/>
own perseverence and determination, earned a PhD in Educational <br/>
Psychology.  I remember the chain-smoking philosophy professor and <br/>
how the ashes fell from his cigarettes as he paced back and forth in <br/>
front of the epistomology class.  That class inspired me to write <br/>
great poetry.  I remember the creative writing professor who made <br/>
sexual advances on me then gave me a D because I refused his <br/>
advances.  I remember the department chairman who, learning of this <br/>
right before I graduated, changed that D to a B.  I worked in the <br/>
department office so he knew me well and knew my writing abilities. <br/>
That was back in the days of paper records and punch cards.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember tiny details about the coffee house I helped run in <br/>
undergrad and grad school; the designs carved into the tables made of <br/>
wire spools, the finicky sound system, the long nights spent with the <br/>
cadre of anti-establishment friends and folk musicians who helped run <br/>
the place, the smell of the spiced cider we served.<br/>
<br/>
I have a good memory for anything that registered as important to me, <br/>
but I remember little from my college classes, very little indeed.  I <br/>
remember many things about activities in which I was involved, and <br/>
people with whom I made friends, and life lessons that still sustain <br/>
me, but only snippets of anything that I sat through for all those <br/>
hours to earn degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling was an easy transition for me, since it was all too clear <br/>
that structured institutionalized learning had held little import in <br/>
my real life.  Not the &quot;becoming&quot; life of a coed, when one was <br/>
supposed to identify oneself by one&#39;s major and what one was going to <br/>
be someday.  But my real life, the one where I am who am in the here <br/>
and now, not in some abstract becoming.  <br/>

Thank you for all the responses.  I am going to start checking on some<br/>
fairs, Hobby Lobby, etc for my budding artist.  And maybe I will be lucky<br/>
enough to not have to write that narrative transript! :-)  I have to stop<br/>
and remember to breathe most days so not to panic.  I try to remind myself I<br/>
am doing what I feel is best  in spite of the input my mother and mother<br/>
in-law like to so freely give.  Like last night for instance....My mother<br/>
in-law informs me she is not seeing anything the girls are writing. (we are<br/>
temporarily living with my in-laws during our transition) She goes on the<br/>
let me know that my 8 year doesn&#39;t do as well as the 8 year old she tutors<br/>
and how pitiful my Madison is because she isn&#39;t up to speed with the public<br/>
school.  I added the public school thing she just stopped at she was<br/>
pitiful.  Now to completely understand the situation, she is a Pre-K/5-K<br/>
teacher in a public Montessori school and my mother is a retired school<br/>
teacher. UGH!   Of course no one saw me and my 11yo up until 1 a.m. last<br/>
night trying to decode some crazy computer game that used all the grammar<br/>
skills because my daughter couldn&#39;t stop until she figured it out!   Thanks<br/>
for letting me spill this morning, I needed to air somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
This group has been so good for me.  I appreciate your honesty and your<br/>
realness.<br/>

Here it would be important to read your state&#39;s laws or regulations <br/>
carefully to see if this is required, is spelled out in them.  In our <br/>
state this is not required, so if a superintendent asked for this <br/>
type of thing we would strongly suggest that home educators print out <br/>
a copy of the regs, mail them or hand them to the superintendent, and <br/>
ask him or her to please indicate (cite chapter and verse) precisely <br/>
where the regs say that.  In other words we would ask the educators <br/>
to cite chapter and verse.  It turns out we often end up educating <br/>
the educators this way.  But if we are prepared, know the regs, keep <br/>
copies at the ready, then we may smooth the path for the next home <br/>
educator.  <br/>
<br/>
As for transcripts, I had to prepare a modified narrative transcript <br/>
for my daughter when she applied to attend a summer pre-college <br/>
program last year at 15.  I used one of the free transcript templates <br/>
available on the web, filled it in with all the information <br/>
appropriate to her curriculum, what she had done.  Since we were also <br/>
applying for a scholarship I made sure that I attached complete <br/>
information on all of her &quot;extracurricular&quot; activities, too (though <br/>
we clearly do not think of these as extracurricular).  The college <br/>
asked for SAT or ACT scores and instead I submitted a brief letter <br/>
explaining why we do not participate in this type of testing.  They <br/>
also requested letters from her teachers and a guidance counselor.  I <br/>
offered to write these, but suggested that since I am <br/>
teacher/mother/guidance counselor that this might get a little <br/>
redundant.  I never heard another word about test scores or letters.  <br/>
She not only was accepted but was granted a full scholarship.  And <br/>
she loved her experience in this summer program at this liberal arts <br/>
college ranked as one of the top ten for non-conformists (Earlham <br/>
College).  <br/>
<br/>
This may not work at all colleges, but then perhaps the ones where it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work are not the ones an unschooled teen would really want <br/>
to attend.  I figured we had nothing to lose.  If the school got all <br/>
uptight about these requirements, then we would know some important <br/>
things about that school.  If they did not, and Earlham College <br/>
clearly did not, then we would know we were on the right track.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135468732">Thank you Norma for your input.  Our state really doesn&#39;t have any strict<br/>
regulations.  I journal everyday on what each child has done that day so if<br/>
I should need back up I have it.  Luckily our state does not require any<br/>
standardized testing at the end of the year.  Perhaps the journal I keep<br/>
will help me in the future for transcript needs, etc.<br/>
