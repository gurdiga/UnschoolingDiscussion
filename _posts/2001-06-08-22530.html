&gt; Did you happen to attend UNC-CH between 1980 and<br/>
&gt; 1984?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was 15 to 18 between 1980 and 1984, and don&#39;t know what UNC-CH is. &lt;g&gt; So,<br/>
no, I don&#39;t think so, and, what is UNC-CH? (I&#39;ll play game show contestent<br/>
though: &quot;Uh, &#39;University of North Carolina, Charlotte?&quot; Now you say, &quot;No!<br/>
You ARE the Weakest Link! Goodbye!&quot; ;)<br/>
<br/>
I am often being mistaken/thought of for other people, though. Lots of<br/>
people tell me they know someone who sounds/behaves exactly like I do. I am,<br/>
apparently, some sort of cloning experiment gone horribly wrong. &lt;gg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I admit it, I didn&#39;t get enough sleep.<br/>

Thanks for making me feel old, Pam ;-).  UNC-CH is the University of <br/>
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the place where I did all the things <br/>
that will keep me from ever running for political office.  Well, <br/>
maybe I wasn&#39;t that bad ... <br/>
<br/>
Pam Hartley was my best friend my freshman year of college.  I knew <br/>
it was a long shot, but thought I&#39;d throw out the question.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your croupy 3yo feels better!<br/>
