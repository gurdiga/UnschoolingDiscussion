&gt; realized<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;you meant her baby shower. <br/>

because I really thought I&#39;d be the only one. Since I never breastfed, I assumed it <br/>
was some kind of baby holder that had a non-slip cover of sorts, since the <br/>
wee ones are so slippery in the shower!!! LMAO. So everytime I read someone else <br/>
thought they were made for the shower, I feel much better.<br/>
