<br/>
I assume that you were confused and meant this for<br/>
Nancy and not me.  I have not been doing much<br/>
gardening or anything else lately, as I am very ill<br/>
right now.  I have been feverish off and on and the<br/>
glands in the left side of my throat are visable<br/>
swollen.  Feels like I have broken glass in my throat<br/>
every time I swallow.  I don&#39;t want to go to the doc<br/>
and shell out a bunch of money, so am hoping that this<br/>
is something I can kick on my own.  Any ideas folks?<br/>
<br/>
By the way Pris, I remember you too hun.  I have just<br/>
been too sick to post.<br/>
<br/>

Take lots of vitamin C and Echinacea...drink lots of water and orange juice, and sleep, sleep, sleep!!  If that doesn&#39;t work, go to the Dr,<br/>
and tell him to keep his huge bills, just give you some antibiotic since that is what he would do anyway....<br/>
Get better soon!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154527125">sounds like mumps or tonsilitis. Could be strep...its been going around real good right now. You&#39;d better go in anyway whether you want to or not..no herbal remedy will work against any of the above.<br/>

***I was thinking the same thing. The &quot;crushed glass&quot; feeling is common with<br/>
strep, isn&#39;t it? And mumps, too if I remember right. Good luck Nanci. I feel<br/>
for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418692716">I feel your pain, Nanci. Literally. I am just gettin<br/>
gover such yuckiness myself. My glands finally aren&#39;t<br/>
swollen anymore and my fever FINALLY went away. I twas<br/>
only there off and on for like three dayz....(but then<br/>
there is that whole loss of concept of time when you<br/>
have a fever...)...but that was QUITE enough. I now<br/>
have this ANNOYING cough and stuffed/runny nose that<br/>
weren&#39;t there with the fever and aches, and I almost<br/>
wish I could switch back to the easier part...being<br/>
the fever/aches...cuz now I FEEL better, but every<br/>
time I try to talk or laugh or DO anything I go into a<br/>
coughing fit. UGGGGHHH!!! <br/>
I just drank alot of echinacea/elderberry tea and took<br/>
loads and loads of vitamin C and garlic and took lots<br/>
and lots of baths. Oh heavenly baths. What world the<br/>
world be without them. Oh, and rested. I have this pet<br/>
peeve, or theory or whatever you want to call it. If<br/>
you are really sick. Stop. Let yourself be sick. and<br/>
Get over it. Most people in my family are obsessive<br/>
&quot;get-things-done&quot;ers and therefore they never truly<br/>
get a sickness out of their system until it finally<br/>
catches up with them and knocks them flat on their<br/>
butts for not taking a day or two off and resting<br/>
sooner. So if that&#39;s possible for you, I highly<br/>
recommend it. Catch up on some Jerry Springer or<br/>
something. :)<br/>
