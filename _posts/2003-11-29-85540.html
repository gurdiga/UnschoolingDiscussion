<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763385937">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Julie and I have been a member here for a long while but had to<br/>
go no e-mail because of time constraints.  However, I am in need of some<br/>
help and I knew just where to go to get it.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 7 and we unschooled in K last year and I was pretty happy with the<br/>
results.  Even though my hubby has tons reservations about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher that does our evaluation is supportive and I was told<br/>
understands the unschooling concept.  She does a variety of methods with<br/>
her children, including some unschooling (if it is possible to do just<br/>
some?) and unit studies with her children.  She was kind and offered a<br/>
couple of suggestions for me to read about teaching language skills,<br/>
reading and beginning math stuff for ideas to mull over.  Of course after<br/>
reading this information,  I got a little panicked but tried (still trying)<br/>
to keep a handle on it. <br/>
<br/>
 When my dd suddenly decided that she was ready to learn to read and was<br/>
desperate for me to &quot;teach&quot; her because she wants to &quot;be able to stay up<br/>
all night to ready as many chapters of her chapter books as she wants&quot; : D,<br/>
we began a phonics workbook and sight word workbook to get started as I<br/>
hadn&#39;t a clue where  to begin to &quot;teach&quot; someone to read.   My thoughts are<br/>
once she gets the basics, she will take off on her own.   Most days she<br/>
really enjoys doing the workbooks and asked to do them first thing in the<br/>
morning before she &quot;gets too tired&quot; and they start making her &quot;frustrated&quot;<br/>
was her word, which she seems to have a low frustration tolerance and wants<br/>
to give up easily.  <br/>
<br/>
She IS learning both the sight words and getting a firm grasp on the<br/>
phonics of words with what we have done so far.  She was thrilled to read<br/>
her books.... even though they aren&#39;t chapter books and took her &quot;forever&quot;<br/>
as she puts it : D     <br/>
<br/>
However, I can see some of her enthusiasm going down hill  :  * (  We<br/>
talked about it today.  I told her my goal was for her to love to learn<br/>
things.  However sometimes I can see that  she is not enjoying learning and<br/>
ask what she thought the problem might be.  She told me it was her little<br/>
brother (4.5) being to noisy while she is trying to work then we<br/>
brainstormed some ways to get around that issue.  <br/>
<br/>
But I am having a nagging feeling that it is the more the method (even<br/>
though she does seem to be enjoying the workbooks most days) than anything<br/>
else.  My goal still is to have her LOVE to learn, but I want to help her<br/>
get where she wants to go as well.  Does anyone have any thoughts or<br/>
suggestions?  Ideas in helping her &quot;learn&quot; to read?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for being here for a place for me to turn!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751554631">Reading:<br/>
Tell her that some of the most important ways to learn to read is to WATCH <br/>
people reading, have them read to you and even watch the page as they read <br/>
to you.  Then settle her in your lap, haul out her favorite book and read <br/>
it to her.  If you can manage it (with a lapful of kid/s) glide your finger <br/>
underneath each word as you&#39;re reading it.<br/>
<br/>
She can either relax and just listen to the story or she can watch your <br/>
finger go across the page as she hears the words.<br/>
<br/>
Frustration-free and she&#39;s still &#39;working on reading&#39;!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  The joy my daughter gets from learning comes, I think, from being able to discover, sound out and read words on her own. I don&#39;t do any work with her on it other than reading to her or answering questions. This makes it slower than what public school kids might do but think of it (and explain it to DH) this way. In school it&#39;s as if they&#39;re building a foundation for a building. They hand out shovels to the kids (maybe miss a couple). Tell them to quickly dig. It&#39;s a haphazard hole when it&#39;s done but nevertheless they are ordering to build the foundation really fast. When it&#39;s done, most of kids have an ok idea of what a foudation should be but for some it&#39;s not strong enough to build further on. And nevermind the few kids still stuck down in the hole. At home your daughter is building her own understanding of words and reading. If left alone she&#39;ll experiment with sounds, likely write out a lot of gibberish, use logic to deduce what signs say. She&#39;s building her foundation one step at a time and she not only understands every step but thouroughly enjoys it. It took me a long time to catch on to this but I can see my daughter work through it all the time on her own. She may be a late reader when it comes but her understanding and love of words, reading and languagewill likely be more complete than most PSers. You&#39;re unschooling and this is why...To give her the joy of learning that most kids are denied. Sit back, relax and enjoy the show. :)<br/>

<br/>
This is SOLID!!! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very clear and true in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
My three learned to read differently, but solidly, and with more clarity than <br/>
kids get who are swept along the stream with the rest.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night a big group of kids played Quiddler, a spelling game with cards.  <br/>
I was glad they were letting Holly play.  There were seven kids, all <br/>
homeschooled, most unschooled.   Holly was youngest at twelve and the rest ranged 14-19.<br/>
<br/>
They had my favorite college edition &quot;American Heritage&quot; as reference, and <br/>
except for passing through once in a while, and them calling out to me &quot;Isn&#39;t <br/>
[whatever] a word?&quot; and I&#39;d spell it well enough for them or tell them what the <br/>
word was they were thinking of if I could tell.<br/>
<br/>
After a bit I asked one of the boys whether they were letting Holly spell <br/>
however she could and letting it count.  This was overheard in the next room, <br/>
though, and they laughed.  Marty said, &quot;Holly has called ME on a couple of <br/>
things.&quot;   So to cover my overcompenstation for what I thought would be Holly&#39;s <br/>
&quot;behindedness,&quot; I said in the same tone and for everyone, &quot;So are you letting <br/>
Marty spell as well as he can and giving him a break?&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Turns out they were NOT giving people breaks for invented spelling, but <br/>
neither did anyone seem to be grumpy or frustrated, so I didn&#39;t mess with them any <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Professionals wouldn&#39;t think Holly&#39;s spelling should be that good after only <br/>
a year and some of real reading, but her vocabulary was already big before she <br/>
could read, so she didn&#39;t start with the one-syllable stuff, neither in <br/>
reading or spelling.<br/>

When my son was at the approximate age and developmental stage I turned <br/>
the Between the Lions TV show on a lot.  (It was on every M-F morning.) <br/>
  Sometimes he watched and sometimes he did his own thing.  I think the <br/>
show is enjoyable and presents reading and literacy stuff in several <br/>
good ways.  (For instance: combining sounds, stories with little words, <br/>
compound words, sounding out really big words, what it&#39;s like to be an <br/>
author.)  My son is really attracted to anything with music and jokes <br/>
and pretty much repelled by worksheets.   Other kids love worksheets and <br/>
hate puppets or thinly disguised educational content. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YMMV,<br/>
