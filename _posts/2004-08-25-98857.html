Subject: Civil War Battlefields Trip<br/>
<br/>
Hi all --<br/>
<br/>
Please excuse the cross-post, but I want to reach as many people as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Liam (16) and I are taking a road trip this October (hopefully) to visit<br/>
Civil War battlefields, and I was thinking that some of you might have input<br/>
about good places to stop and see on the way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a guidebook for National Civil War Parks, and we are looking at<br/>
sites in Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania -- all<br/>
the major battle sites, plus Appomatox Courthouse and Washington DC.  We&#39;ll<br/>
also be travelling the Natchez Trace from southern Mississippi to southern<br/>
Tennessee and taking a look at some non-Civil War sites there, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Question first:  Have you been to any CW sites that were particularly<br/>
riveting that we just shouldn&#39;t miss?<br/>
<br/>
Second: We&#39;ve only got two weeks altogether, and will be driving from<br/>
Houston to DC and back, so time is of the essence.  What would you<br/>
particularly recommend in the DC area?  We just can&#39;t do the whole thing,<br/>
and this is not the trip for it.  I was thinking of Ford&#39;s Theater...are<br/>
there any other particular CW sites that we should visit there?  (I<br/>
know....I&#39;m checking online too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Third: Any great places to eat or stay?  We&#39;re looking at a tight budget,<br/>
but can splurge once in awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth:  Good scenic routes?  In particular, can anyone tell me if<br/>
Interstate 81 through western Virginia is good?  I&#39;d love to be able to get<br/>
off the interstates altogether and take back roads, but we just won&#39;t have<br/>
the time.  The map looks like 81 goes right through the long middle of the<br/>
W. Virginia mountains on the west and the Blue Ridge on the East.  Is it<br/>
nice there, or have they managed to make that interstate as boring as so<br/>
many others?  We will, however, be able to take back roads for select<br/>
periods.  Any favorites?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your time in responding!<br/>

I live in Staunton VA, right at the intersection of I-81 and I-64 East.  We<br/>
also love going to the Civil War sites and have been to lots of them.  I can<br/>
suggest places to stop and routes you might take to see as much as possible<br/>
in this area of the country.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been to Vicksburg, MS and Chattanooga/Chickamuagua parks and enjoyed<br/>
them both.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put it in the closest to chronological order that makes sense<br/>
travelling a circuit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d go up I-81 into VA (you&#39;ll be travelling through the Great Smoky Mts. in<br/>
TN) and  stop at Lexington.  There you&#39;ll find Stonewall Jackson&#39;s House<br/>
(I&#39;d skip it with time constraints) and the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery,<br/>
where he is buried.  Right down the road is Washington & Lee University,<br/>
with Lee Chapel on the grounds, where Robert E. Lee is buried.  At the VMI<br/>
Museum you could see Jackson&#39;s horse (I forget his name) and other Civil war<br/>
memoribilia.  This is a very small town and worth getting off the interstate<br/>
to drive through.  Everything is right on/by the main street (Hwy 11)<br/>
through town.<br/>
<br/>
Continue north on 81 to New Market Battlefield.  The VMI cadets marched from<br/>
Lexington to there and fought in that battle - very moving story.  We&#39;ve<br/>
never spent the time or $ to go to the private museum that&#39;s next door, so I<br/>
can&#39;t say if it&#39;s any good.<br/>
<br/>
West on I-66 to Manassas (Bull Run) where the first land battle took place.<br/>
It&#39;s amazing that people from DC came out in their carriages for a picnic to<br/>
see the show!  Also, it&#39;s the place where &quot;Stonewall&quot; got his nickname.<br/>
<br/>
Into DC - Ford&#39;s Theater is great, but be sure and check times and rehearsal<br/>
schedules!  We took my MIL there and couldn&#39;t get in because of a rehearsal.<br/>
Across the stree is the &quot;House where Lincoln died&quot; - They give a lot of info<br/>
in a little time.<br/>
<br/>
North you want to see Antietam (MD) and Gettysburg, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
If you come back down I-95 to Fredericksburg (nice site, interesting because<br/>
of them crossing the river), go slightly west and also see Chancelorsville<br/>
(where Jackson was shot) and The Wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
If you have time and want to, continue south on 95 to see Richmond (capital<br/>
of the Confederacy) and Petersburg (supposed to be good - I haven&#39;t been to<br/>
that one).<br/>
<br/>
Go west, either from Chancelorsville, Richmond, or Petersburg (all smaller<br/>
roads through the Piedmont - rolling hills - scenic) to Appomatox<br/>
Courthouse.<br/>
<br/>
West through Lynchburg to I-81 and south.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s plenty more to see here, and the country along I-81 is beautiful, I<br/>
think.  As you travel north, first you&#39;re in Mts., but then in the Great<br/>
Valley of VA, with the Alleghenies on the west and the Blue Ridge on the<br/>
east.  You could take a little time to go up on the Blue Ridge Parkway if<br/>
you like mt. views, but you&#39;ll get plenty of those along the trip anyway.<br/>
Also, you could get off the Interstate some and travel Hwy 11(the<br/>
Lee-Jackson Hwy).  It was the main route even back in the 1800s. You&#39;ll see<br/>
little towns (like villages), some interesting eating places,<br/>
bed&breakfasts, and lots of antiques shops.  But I&#39;d mostly stay on 81 to<br/>
get to places faster.<br/>
<br/>
Other things to see - in Staunton, where I live, there is the Blackfriar&#39;s<br/>
Playhouse, the only re-creation in the world of Shakespeare&#39;s indoor<br/>
theater.  Beautiful place, great plays!<br/>
<br/>
Also, The American Frontier Culture Museum, with working farms, English,<br/>
German, Scotch-Irish, American blend, but from an earlier era than the Civil<br/>
War.<br/>
<br/>
Along the entire valley there are caverns (as in TX).<br/>
<br/>
In DC the new American Indian Museum will be open at the Smithsonian.<br/>
Sounds fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope this helps and was not too boring for anyone else reading it!<br/>
I&#39;m from Arlington, VA and lived in TX for years, so have made many trips<br/>
back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
In case you don&#39;t have this, I&#39;d recommend getting the Passport book at the<br/>
National park service.  You can save money just getting the cancellations in<br/>
another book or notebook, but my kids really treasure their special<br/>
passports).   Get cancellations at all of the National sites, but also ask<br/>
at non-national park sites if they have a stamp (like the Alamo does).  It&#39;s<br/>
a wonderful keepsake.<br/>
<br/>
Well, sorry this was so long.  Have a wonderful trip!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  This was part of the Shenandoah campaign, right?  I <br/>
don&#39;t know much about this.  Interesting angle on the VMI cadets.  <br/>
We&#39;ll probably be seeing some of this story when we watch &#39;Gods and <br/>
Generals&#39; soon, so I just might add it in, although we&#39;ve got a lot <br/>
on the plate already!<br/>

to visit friends in western North Carolina -- but you couldn&#39;t have <br/>
know THAT (unless you really were looking over my shoulder last night <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I needed to know.  It is a large valley -- the maps <br/>
weren&#39;t entirely clear.  I didn&#39;t know how close the mountains would <br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
  You could take a little time to go up on the Blue Ridge Parkway if<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds cool, even though we&#39;re trying to keep this trip focused <br/>
on the Civil War.  I&#39;m of Scots-Irish extraction, and my dad&#39;s family <br/>
comes from that neck of the woods.  I&#39;ll have to find this online.  <br/>
Maybe we&#39;ll stop if we&#39;re on battlefield burnout.  (I almost <br/>
certainly will be by this time.)<br/>
