<br/>
There are three fingering charts there.<br/>
Ignore the first and third.<br/>
The middle one might be what you want.<br/>
<br/>
The two holes on the left are the thumbs.  Black means covered up.  White <br/>
means open.<br/>
<br/>
With almost any such rustic flute, instruments might be slightly different <br/>
from each other and one fingering chart  might not work for all of them, but it <br/>
will give you an idea.<br/>
