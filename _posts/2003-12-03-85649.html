and how much the world has changed since then and if it&#39;s a good thing or a <br/>
bad thing and I was surprised at how astute some of Sarah&#39;s observations were. <br/>
She said it&#39;s easier to be a family without all the modern things that <br/>
distract us from spending time with each other. <br/>
<br/>
Not that she or I want to change our lives drastically, but it was also I <br/>
think a &quot;spend more time with me&quot; moment too. &lt;&lt;<br/>
*******************************<br/>
We once went 10 days without power.  We live way out in the woods and trees <br/>
often fall on the power lines.  It was last winter when much of the east coast <br/>
was out.  We ended up buying a generator at about day 5 (this happens to us, <br/>
for at least 4 or 5 hours or more, about 5 times per year) but before we did we <br/>
really enjoyed ourselves.  Lots of card games, stories, board games, etc.   <br/>
Plus, we have a well run on electric, so no electric means no water.  We had to <br/>
carry buckets from the creek and buy drinking water.  The boys all peed in <br/>
the woods to keep the water consumption down.  <br/>

anyone else who unschools in my area. &lt;&lt;<br/>

**********************************************<br/>
I know how you feel.  We have one unschooling family about 1 hour away, but <br/>
their youngest is 15, oldest is heading off to college, and they are <br/>
crafters/shoe makers that sell at shows and work out of their home, so they&#39;re often too <br/>
busy to get together.  <br/>
<br/>
I, too, have been trying to let go more.  This is the first year we&#39;re <br/>
homeschooling our adopted son, who was in special ed at school and floundering, so I <br/>
worry a little about him.  He is always busy with something though! :o)<br/>
<br/>
Is there still an email list for &quot;beginning unschoolers?&quot;  I never did sign <br/>
up for the other lists, though I wish I had<br/>
