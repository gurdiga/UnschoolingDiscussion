<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717445613">Hello Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am always nearby on her play-dates.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thankfully I too have not &#39;had&#39; to leave Lenelle with daycare or other <br/>
types of people and thus far the biggest clashes we have run into on <br/>
the subject of food* have been with Grandma and Grampa (my parents) <br/>
who are actually trying to understand and support which makes things <br/>
easier. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would not be leaving her with someone .....unwilling to let her <br/>
 </span></blockquote>eat her food, or leave it either (and I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;would always  have the food bag to leave with her)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can remeber that a packed lunch or picnic (just like the toy bags I <br/>
would bring to entertain her during DR. visits and other type <br/>
activities I&#39;d think  she might get bored in) couldn&#39;t hold a candle <br/>
to what others had.                <br/>
Usually I will bring/send a snack all the children can share as a <br/>
contribution to the other household wether <br/>
they eat it during the time shared or consume other things and have <br/>
whatever we&#39;ve given them some other time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It sounds like your daughter is &quot;testing those boundaries&quot; to use <br/>
 </span></blockquote>some jargon from modern parenting. <br/>
<br/>
LOL well dipping back into &#39;modern parenting jargon&#39; I would counter <br/>
&quot;you suggest that like it&#39;s a bad thing&quot; also understanding that who <br/>
would say that would I think also be saying &quot;Kids test boundaries to <br/>
show us they need us to enforce rules to show we care, and are <br/>
concerned about them&quot;.<br/>
But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what my daughter is doing, any more than I <br/>
believe that&#39;s why all kids, who are doing it, do it. (pauses to ask <br/>
&quot;was that a mental tongue twister ;&gt; )  <br/>
<br/>
As a child I hated the phrase &quot;kids NEED rules/structure/discipline&quot; I <br/>
always knew I wouldn&#39;t go crazy without grown ups breathing down my <br/>
neck and wasn&#39;t totally the thriving child that I was because they <br/>
were. But then I couldn&#39;t then and still cannot now tell how much of <br/>
who I was and am is totally instinctive and how much I simply grasped <br/>
firmly and early from the structure I was born and raised into.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are we still talking about food*?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this about food? Was it ever? Are things ever really about what <br/>
they seem to be about on the surface? Were you thinking this when you <br/>
posted your original message or are you only asking me if I see the <br/>
connection in what I posted? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;Would never&quot; is a big phrase. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry for makining a generalization which then appears to nullify <br/>
itself  I was only trying to illustrate what currently appears to be <br/>
true:  3 different families all homeschooling without any other firm <br/>
similarities that I can think to highlight.<br/>
Currently one set of kids seems to adhere to a certain set out food <br/>
guidelines where ever they go. Lenelle and I are still on a path to <br/>
finding food comfort zones and the other childrens mother was telling <br/>
me &quot;my kids eat one way at home but at a recent party they jumped at <br/>
the chance to eat something  I don&#39;t give them (don&#39;t want them to <br/>
have) tho they don&#39;t protest not getting it around the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Does &quot;qualms&quot; mean these are children who are afraid of their <br/>
&gt;parents, or punishment?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The quote is &quot;without qualms&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I am taking offence but are you in fact from your <br/>
&#39;enlightened&#39; space suggesting or insisting that those who are not at <br/>
the place you see yourself or whom may never be are some how not <br/>
right? Failing or fooling themselves and or their children. As if <br/>
there is really only one right way to rear, learn, grow, teach, be <br/>
taught. <br/>
<br/>
I do feel as a homeschooling parent that I and other homeschooling <br/>
families I encounter are more connected to and therefore enlightened <br/>
about our own individual children and in that way a bit more about all <br/>
children. With such new perspectives it does seem like if we could <br/>
impart then some of our wisdom to &quot;ordinary parents&quot; and have it take <br/>
hold it could transform in a positive way many of the things we look <br/>
out and don&#39;t like to see in our world. But not that this is a simple <br/>
process or an over night evolution. And not that more truth or  wisdom <br/>
to parents about themselves or their children would lead them to <br/>
exactly where we have come to or where we are going.<br/>
            <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When consequences are seamlessly obvious, they need not be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>mentioned.<br/>
I cannot blindly agree with this statement. I like it in theory but it <br/>
has yet to totally pan out in my life. <br/>
<br/>
Example: From her father my daughter inherited bed wetting which has <br/>
lasted from the time she was out of diapers until this summer.<br/>
<br/>
He was not around when she was 4 so I didn&#39;t know it was from him at <br/>
the time but subsequently he has told me he wet the bed till about <br/>
this age. Meanwhile I did everything it seemed there was to be tried <br/>
to curtail bed wetting without trying to make our life crazy or <br/>
resorting to drugs. After I had tried different things to no avail we <br/>
accepted it and life went on.<br/>
<br/>
But as she got older and from time to time the whole problem would <br/>
upset her. Being powerless to control her bladder through the night <br/>
while she slept we discovered that going potty b4 bed led to a dry <br/>
night 95% of the time even if she had a beverage right before she fell <br/>
asleep. Go figure......<br/>
<br/>
So it was clear &quot;if you do not want to wake up wet, wet before bed&quot; <br/>
but would she do that? NO <br/>
<br/>
Like cutting off ones nose to spite ones face she resented her body <br/>
not doing what she wanted so she refused to accomidate it the way it <br/>
needed only to then pout whine and otherwise be upset morning after <br/>
morning waking up in a cold puddle.<br/>
<br/>
Gritting my teeth every a.m. did no good so when I didn&#39;t want to hear <br/>
her whining the next day I would insist she go potty the night before. <br/>
Not to mention my desire at times to save on laundry.<br/>

... I want to suggest the idea that in the wider parenting world the <br/>
words &quot;implementing limits&quot;, or more usually &quot;setting limits&quot;, is a <br/>
buzz word phrase - politically correct jargon of supposedly aware <br/>
parenting, which can often be translated into &quot;controlling the <br/>
children&#39;s behavior&quot;. ....&quot;Limits&quot; can mean &quot;what parents tolerate in <br/>
their comfort zone&quot;. ....Lists that discuss unschooling often include <br/>
so much that is about changing your parenting on a deep thought level, <br/>
so using these part-time buzz words may spark unexpected semantics <br/>
based responses. &quot;With our thoughts we make the world&quot;. With (only) <br/>
our words, we make our thoughts known online. .. Another modern <br/>
parenting idea is &quot;Give your children choices&quot;. ... it just looks like <br/>
manipulation - hmmm, actually it *is* manipulation .... a huge <br/>
improvement over no choices at all and fear based obedience, but not <br/>
as enlightened as unschooling can be. Gosh, it sounds smug to use <br/>
&quot;enlightened&quot; but it still seems the best word... Unschoolers are <br/>
usually on a path towards real choices that their children &quot;make&quot; <br/>
rather than being &quot;given&quot; or &quot;permitted&quot;. Sometimes this means <br/>
gritting your teeth and biting your tongue. Occasionally these real <br/>
choices are likely to have crummy (but presumably not life or limb <br/>
threatening) results, especially when the children are young. For most <br/>
&quot;ordinary parents&quot; the teeth gritting over bad choices comes when the <br/>
youngster is grown up or in their late teens and is suddenly &quot;given&quot; <br/>
(translation: mandatory acceptance) responsibilities and adult <br/>
behavior expectations. We get to practice gritting for way longer. <br/>
;)... A principles-based lifestyle, instead of a hierarchy...<br/>
It becomes about letting go of the need to ensure that they are <br/>
&quot;learning from their mistakes&quot; ...... the suspicion that the parents <br/>

=========<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things that I have found helpful. First, there are <br/>
waterproof crib pads--the full crib size are best--that are very helpful <br/>
either on top of the sheet if the child will tolerate them or under the <br/>
sheet to at least protect mattress pad and mattress. That way, you&#39;re <br/>
only washing the crib pad and maybe the sheet. My girls were fine having <br/>
them on top of the sheet, and I could just shift a new one in if one had <br/>
an accident. My guy balks at having it on the top--doesn&#39;t like the way <br/>
it feels. So, with him, I end up washing the sheet and the pad, but I&#39;ve <br/>
always got a load of laundry I can throw in with it. *g* No shortage of <br/>
that here!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I credit my sister-in-law with this one, you can put a sleeping <br/>
child on the potty and get them to empty their bladder one more time <br/>
before you go to sleep. It&#39;s amazing, but it actually works. I, on the <br/>
other hand, told her that you can give a sleeping child medicine with a <br/>
dropper. So, together, she and I make a pretty good team. :)<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I just figure that my job is to facilitate and clean up <br/>
messes without blinking an eye. Eventually they will stay dry, use the <br/>
potty and make it through the night. I figure, a parent can either fight <br/>
it and be resentful, or they can clean up and offer opportunities <br/>
without comment. I&#39;ve found the second approach far easier.<br/>

include fear of punishment or fear of parent&#39;s disappointment in them,<br/>

Which (or what else) did you mean? <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers seek to set up a life of communication and joy with their<br/>
children so that the &quot;qualms&quot; don&#39;t have to exist. If there are no<br/>
&quot;Restrictions&quot; set up entirely for parents&#39; reasons, then there is not<br/>
concept of &quot;straying&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Not that I am taking offence but are you in fact from your <br/>
&#39;enlightened&#39; space suggesting or insisting that those who are not at <br/>
the place you see yourself or whom may never be are some how not <br/>
right? Failing or fooling themselves and or their children. As if <br/>
there is really only one right way to rear, learn, grow, teach, be <br/>
taught.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers try not to think in terms of teaching or being taught generally.<br/>
There are as many ways of learning as there are children, but the general<br/>
principle that learning is continual, automatic and unstoppable applies all<br/>
over. If interest comes first, learning is joyful - as compared to learning<br/>
how to do the minimum to pass, or learning how to keep out of trouble, or<br/>
learning that rules are more important to some Moms than happiness. (I&#39;m NOT<br/>
directing this latter idea *personal* way - just noting that it can happen.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I do feel as a homeschooling parent that I and other homeschooling <br/>
families I encounter are more connected to and therefore enlightened <br/>
about our own individual children and in that way a bit more about all <br/>
children. With such new perspectives it does seem like if we could <br/>
impart then some of our wisdom to &quot;ordinary parents&quot; and have it take <br/>
hold it could transform in a positive way many of the things we look <br/>
out and don&#39;t like to see in our world. But not that this is a simple <br/>
process or an over night evolution. And not that more truth or  wisdom <br/>
to parents about themselves or their children would lead them to <br/>
exactly where we have come to or where we are going.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you Unschooling? I ask because you are calling yourself a &quot;home&quot;-<br/>
schooler. On this list the words are not interchangeable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to better understand Jayn&#39;s needs and desires and fulfill<br/>
them on a daily basis, without the baggage from my own traditionally<br/>
parented childhood and school education, intruding. I don&#39;t know that we<br/>
speak for all children, although many of us on this list are passionately<br/>
interested in child development theories, if only to compare the general<br/>
experience with ours. <br/>
<br/>
The collective wisdom on these lists is to help people get to Unschooling<br/>
better, because those of us who are living it have such joyous lives with<br/>
our children - even when there are challenges. However unless a parent is<br/>
actively seeking this wisdom, any notion of how their children&#39;s lives could<br/>
be improved tends to elude them, and they continue to argue, including for<br/>
restrictions to varying degrees.<br/>
<br/>
The first challenge to parents when they start learning about Unschooling is<br/>
to change their thinking. One important facet of that is to change our<br/>
internal dialogue and language use. <br/>
            <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; When consequences are seamlessly obvious, they need not be <br/>
mentioned.<br/>
I cannot blindly agree with this statement. I like it in theory but it <br/>
has yet to totally pan out in my life. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope no-one agrees to any statements &quot;blindly&quot;, no matter who makes them. <br/>
<br/>
Another way to state this idea is: Children will learn all they need to from<br/>
their mistakes, without parents needing *make sure* they learn something, or<br/>
even point out that the mistake happened. Children don&#39;t need an accident<br/>
(like something fell and broke) pointed out to them, if the broken pieces<br/>
are on the floor in front of them.<br/>
<br/>
Like if there has been a spill, I give Jayn a chance to pick the stuff up.<br/>
Often she asks me to do it. I don&#39;t say anything along the lines of, &quot;You<br/>
spilled that because you were doing such-and-such...&quot;. The only time I would<br/>
say this type of line would be if Jayn asked me what happened, and it would<br/>
be information not teaching. That has not occurred yet, to my recollection. <br/>
<br/>
I am trying very hard to stop making any comment at all, including a cheery,<br/>
&quot;Oops&quot; although sometimes Jayn seems to want reassurance - such as that she<br/>
can get another. We laugh a lot at spills and topples. Better than grumping<br/>
about them. I&#39;d be grumping all day long some days, otherwise. I choose not<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Example: From her father my daughter inherited bed wetting which has <br/>
lasted from the time she was out of diapers until this summer.<br/>
<br/>
He was not around when she was 4 so I didn&#39;t know it was from him at <br/>
the time but subsequently he has told me he wet the bed till about <br/>
this age. Meanwhile I did everything it seemed there was to be tried <br/>
to curtail bed wetting without trying to make our life crazy or <br/>
resorting to drugs. After I had tried different things to no avail we <br/>
accepted it and life went on.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have thought your daughter&#39;s bed wetting was in the same area of<br/>
discussion as a mistake made, especially since it seems out of her control<br/>
to alter how fast her body grows.<br/>
<br/>
I never made any kind of big deal about Jayn (now 4.5) sometimes wetting the<br/>
bed - and it is a family bed - in the time between being fully out of<br/>
diapers, and her little bladder being grown big enough to last all night -<br/>
as has occurred until close to her 4th birthday. I&#39;m pretty convinced that<br/>
bedwetting at 4 is pretty average, to judge by stories from other parents in<br/>
my local group and here. Acting like it is a big unusual &quot;inherited&quot;<br/>
phenomenon may give it more power in your mind and hers.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully hearing that you eventually accepted it will help other parents do<br/>
so at once, without needing to put themselves and their kids through the<br/>
attempts at curtailing it that made you feel your life was crazy. Just jump<br/>
straight to the relaxed part. Many others have already made practical<br/>
suggestions to help with this.<br/>

(voices in the head/conscience).    I don&#39;t want kids to be qualms-free, if <br/>
they&#39;re headed toward doing something that will have to be cleaned up after <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t comment on that one when it first came around. <br/>
If she&#39;s wetting the bed, she shouldn&#39;t be out of diapers at night.<br/>
<br/>
If bedclothes and laundry are more important than comfortable sleep, it might <br/>
be easier for the parent to shift perspective and change priorities than to <br/>
cling to the idea of what the child should or should not be doing.    Marty <br/>
peed the bed (gradually less) until he was nine or so, but wearing a small adult <br/>
diaper was cheaper than a load of laundry every day and more comfortable for <br/>
Marty.<br/>
<br/>
Sleep is more important than keeping up with the Jones&#39;s development charts.  <br/>
Or I think it should be, if the child is important.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Acting like it is a big unusual &quot;inherited&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I think it is a genetic thing.  I never did, and Kirby and Holly never did.  <br/>
Marty, who is like his dad in just about every perceivable way, did and his <br/>
dad had.  But his dad had been shamed and yelled at and derided.  Marty wasn&#39;t.  <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Peeing before bedtime didn&#39;t prevent Marty from peeing the bed later.  <br/>
Getting him up in the middle of the night didn&#39;t prevent it either.    It was just <br/>
preventing him and me from sleeping a long, quiet sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind telling it, and Marty has said he doesn&#39;t mind me telling it, <br/>
becaue if one child is spared one shaming session, it&#39;s worth sharing it again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670560923">Hiyas Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
The best news is that (fingers crossed and all that especially after <br/>
reading that your son had troubles until age 9 sigh) this summer has <br/>
been DRY!!! lol<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can agree with that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If we had a door,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have doors? Do tell ;o;<br/>
<br/>
I too hope people are learning from this list and the discussion and <br/>
not leaving over what they are reading rather than hitting Next and <br/>
moving on from things they do not agree with or want to be bothered <br/>
with but then again sometimes when people really get talking a person <br/>
can realize what&#39;s really important to them and how to move totally <br/>
away if the conversations aren&#39;t a part of that.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t go into a lot of detail about my daughters bed wetting but <br/>
here are some of the reasons I didn&#39;t suggest we go back to diapers:  <br/>
the first 6 months after she was potty trained she slept dry through <br/>
the night. In which time we gave away most of what we had used for <br/>
diapers (cloth stuff) so they weren&#39;t even around plus when those <br/>
first few wet nights occured I just thought they would be passing <br/>
glitches.<br/>
<br/>
2 years later when we discovered (and I think when also her body had <br/>
changed and grown a bit more in the bladder department) that night <br/>
time wetting could all but be avoided it seemed only natural that we <br/>
could then shift our behavior to do that.<br/>
<br/>
So it was like WOW we had a dry night which followed potting before <br/>
bed lets try that again, and we did. Till we knew it really worked. <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t worried about when she would stop or the laundry the whole <br/>
thing only became an issue when she realized she could get around wet <br/>
a.m.s but she refused to & she wanted to be upset about it too.<br/>
<br/>
She always slept through the night so it was never that her sleep was <br/>
interupted and in the a.m. she could get out of her wet things and <br/>
into one of my T shirts to bum around the house or head straight to <br/>
the tub on her own. And for months I continued to do her bed (which <br/>
has a plastic mattress so just strip it, wipe it clean, let it dry <br/>
and re make it).<br/>
<br/>
My X said the same thing his mother shamed him over the issue when he <br/>
was a child which I think is so sad.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing<br/>
