<br/>
Little books for big imaginations<br/>
<br/>
Why do deer have smelly feet? What animal is the world&#39;s best jumper? When<br/>
do chickens do the cha-cha? What happens if you tickle a rat? Find out with<br/>
the KIND News Book of Critter Clues and the KIND News Book of Critter Views,<br/>
two books that are sure to be a hit with your homeschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
Recently published by the nonprofit National Association for Humane and<br/>
Environmental Education (NAHEE), these pocket-sized books make reading,<br/>
learning, and natural science a blast with their kid-friendly formats and<br/>
quirky facts about animals and their behaviors. Both  books can be used by<br/>
students alone or in groups, while homeschooling parents can easily<br/>
incorporate them into their lessons.<br/>
<br/>
The KIND News Book of Critter Clues features fun (and tricky) clues to 30<br/>
familiar wild animals and pets. Answer keys reveal the identities of mystery<br/>
critters plus fascinating facts about their behaviors, history and habitats.<br/>
The KIND News Book of Critter Views is packed with humorous illustrations<br/>
and amazing-but true-tales from the world of animals. Information for the<br/>
books was culled from KIND (Kids In Nature&#39;s Defense) News, NAHEE&#39;s<br/>
award-winning newspaper for elementary school-age children.<br/>
<br/>
The KIND News Book of Critter Clues and the KIND News Book of Critter Views<br/>
are priced at just $2.50 each. To order online, visit www.nahee.org. Checks<br/>
