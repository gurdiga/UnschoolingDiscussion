 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s ALL Role playing...any time that someone takes on a ROLE which is not<br/>
their own, they are role playing.  In the more traditional sense of the<br/>
term as referring to fantasy gaming, it refers to Dungeons and Dragons,<br/>
Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, GUURPS (based on Middle Earth from Tolkien,<br/>
Gamma World (a post apocolyptic one where you can be a sentient plant or<br/>
animal or a mutation that is some combination or variation, etc) and a<br/>
hundred others with a hundred other themes.  There are vampire ones,<br/>
historical ones from various time periods, science fiction ones, and on and<br/>
on.  <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;games&quot; ususally comprise of a &quot;module&quot; or storyline (complete with<br/>
dialogue of the folks the players run into, maps and a quest object or some<br/>
other reason to get the action going.)  Using various types of dice when<br/>
things must be determined randomly or semi randomly (everything from<br/>
determining a character&#39;s physical attributes to whether or not they slip<br/>
on a algae covered rock) and a Game Master who leads the action (sometimes<br/>
overruling the dice) and is privy to all the maps and info in the module<br/>
and acts as an impartial (we hope) referee/coach/storyteller/etc a group of<br/>
people have an adventure!  The variations and possibilities are endless, as<br/>
is the potential for fun!<br/>
