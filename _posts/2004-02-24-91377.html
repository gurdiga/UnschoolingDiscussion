<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054229920">They have all kindergarteners in this town going to school in one place, which happens to be on the local military installation. (I&#39;ll give the principal some serious credit. On 9/11, as soon as they locked down, he went to the main gate and personally stepped on every single bus in order to greet the children as they arrived because up until then, the base was &quot;open&quot; and none of them were used to seeing armed soldiers there. He did that twice a day, everyday all school year and will keep doing so until or unless the base is stood down to open status again) Then, the base children in grades 2 to 4 stay on the base, the off-base children go to ABC Elementary; then 5 graders from both have a building alone, 6 to 9th are at the Junior High and then 10 to 12th at the Sr. High. <br/>
 <br/>
Definitely some social experimentation going on. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170408199">It really makes no difference what grade levels are at a school anyways because from our experience the kids have lunches only with their grade. They are only allowed out to play supervised by their own classroom teacher. Portables are a normal place for many of them to spend their whole day. So except for the bus ride even if there are 6 grades in a school they have absolutly no time to intermingle. The schools are so overcrowded that they don&#39;t have assemblies anymore, they don&#39;t even have performances put on by the whole school. Instead each grade level will have some sort of performance through out the year put on in conjuction with a PTA meeting. So say in October all the grade one classes will put on a program for the parents at the PTA meeting. This way they ensure a good turn out to the PTA meeting, since most of the grade one parents will come to see their children. Sneaky or Opportunist?Hmm.lol..<br/>
<br/>
This was the whole reason I took my kids out of school. The overcrowding and lack of any type of fun. Even before I knew anything about unschooling. We had left a very small neighbourhood K-8 school (400 kids whole school, still had hour lunches and 20 minute recesses twice a day) and came to an overcrowded school with 1000 students that are never allowed to socialize in any way.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My dd Emily&#39;s only school experience was 7th grade at the local Jr. High that <br/>
included 7th and 8th grade.  Her primary reason for attending was that she <br/>
really wanted to see what school was like.  She was 10 yo and 2 or 3 yrs. <br/>
younger than the other 7th graders.  When I enrolled her, I filled out about 20 <br/>
forms that all asked for her birthday.  I also turned in a health form with her <br/>
age on it and a standarized test report with her age on it.  <br/>
<br/>
The day after we received her first quarter report card in the mail, I was <br/>
called in to a meeting with the principal and a guidance counselor.  They told <br/>
me that they had just found out that Emily was 10 (they had made a chart of <br/>
their ages in science and the teacher had spread the news around to her other <br/>
teachers and some of them had expressed concerns that Em was only 10 to the <br/>
guidance counselor.)They made it sound like I had tried to keep it a secret!  They <br/>
said that Em would have to immediately go to the 5th grade in another school <br/>
because the social environment in their school was inappropriate for a 10 yo.  <br/>
I pointed out that Em&#39;s average was a 99, and she was highest on the honor <br/>
roll for the 7th grade, and she was taking 8th grade math and high school French <br/>
1.  I also pointed out that Em had lots of friends, had never had any sort of <br/>
problem in school, and even looked older than many of the other students. <br/>
(Note no one had realized she was any younger than them until she pointed it out.) <br/>
 They were still determined to have her immediately placed in the 5th grade, <br/>
which would have been devasting to her!  After threatening a law suit based on <br/>
them providing an appropriate education for all students...including <br/>
appropriate academics...they let her stay.  They did make me write a notarized letter <br/>
stating that I was keeping Em in that school against their best judgment and <br/>
that any problems caused by it were entirely my fault, lol!<br/>
<br/>
What I though was funny was that if the school was socially inappropriate for <br/>
a 10yo, how could it be socially appropriate for a 12yo?<br/>

They&#39;re worried about sexuality.<br/>
<br/>
Some (maybe most, maybe all) states have laws that don&#39;t allow for kids <br/>
failing more than two grades, or being moved ahead more than one.  It&#39;s more <br/>
important that they&#39;re of similar age than that they&#39;re of similar academic <br/>
anything.  <br/>

been common practice to have boys &quot;held back&quot; several times so by the <br/>
time they&#39;re playing HS sports they&#39;re full-grown men, and therefore <br/>
