 pesticide laden crop as well (not to mention moldy)<br/>
 one should always buy organic.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Jill, Yes, now I have learned that peanuts, when roasted in cottonseed <br/>
oil, and peanut butter are bad, too.  Are reg. peanuts when roasted in the <br/>
shell ok?  I&#39;m starting to wonder if anything is safe to eat or drink.    I <br/>
have given up chocolate a year ago, soft drinks (since March), all caffeine, <br/>
sugar, white bread, grapes, bacon, frozen dinners, processed meats and <br/>
cheeses, chips;and while I am learning how to stabilize my blood sugar, I <br/>
don&#39;t eat potatoes or corn or white rice, either.  I have to eat about every <br/>
2 hrs, but it seems as if the options are narrowing.  In my hypoglycemic <br/>
books, there are lists of specific fruits I cannot have due to the high <br/>
fructose levels, and specific vegetables to be very leery of due to the high <br/>
glycemic /starch levels.  So, I feel like I keep giving foods up, only to <br/>
find the ones that seem ok, are still bad., like strawberries.  I want to eat <br/>
healthy, most of all, but I don&#39;t know what actually is safe now.  Does <br/>
anyone feel this way?  Well, it&#39;s time for a snack... I think I&#39;ll have some <br/>
cheddar cheese.  According to the Hypo-G book, it&#39;s a good choice.  I am <br/>
nursing a baby, and have got to eat foods that will give some &quot;sustenance&quot;, <br/>
so I hope I won&#39;t learn now that this is terrible, too.  :)  ~Karen</div>
