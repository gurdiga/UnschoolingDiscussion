nature&#39;s secret weapon for calming a toddler??  Some days I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m<br/>
tired of it, but most days I&#39;m glad he still nurses.  He was the high needs<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828970609">My second child (now 17yo) nursed until I said *enough* - 5th birthday was the<br/>
last day. But hearing everyone talking about what their toddlers call it, makes<br/>
me laugh - I learnt the hard way that an obscure word or phrase might be<br/>
better. When #2 was about 3 1/2 we were at a homeschool gathering, I was in the<br/>
middle of setting out lunch for the starving millions, including my own older<br/>
child, when #2 started asking for milk. I said &#39;no, wait till I have finished<br/>
setting out lunch&#39; - I knew it wasn&#39;t &#39;urgent&#39;, he was just hungry and bored,<br/>
and once lunch was out, would just as happily have a sandwich and then go play<br/>
(please believe me on this, I knew this particular behavoiur pattern).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he asked again for milk, and again I said &#39;wait&#39;, where upon another<br/>
mother, glaring at me, commented that there was no need for him to wait, and<br/>
before I could explain, handed him a glass of cold cow&#39;s milk from the carton<br/>
in the fridge. The look of disgust on his face was priceless - as was the look<br/>
of horror on the woman&#39;s face as my ds hurled the glass, contents and all,<br/>
straight at her!<br/>
<br/>
One of the other nice things that happenned, which goes to show you shouldn&#39;t<br/>
judge people by appearances, happened at a party we had at our house as a<br/>
farewell for one of dh&#39;s workmates who was leaving the country. Ds #2 (again)<br/>
this time 4 1/2yo, fell and hurt himself quite badly. You guessed it - after<br/>
being mopped up by dh, all he wanted to do was nurse. I was sitting with about<br/>
four guys, 3 parents, and one about 19, loud, foul-mouthed, full of grubby<br/>
jokes.... you get the picture. Along comes this huge 4 1/2 yo and this awful<br/>
woman (me) picks him up and starts nursing him!<br/>
<br/>
Well, the 3 fathers, quickly left, looking slightly ill. The aforementioned<br/>
19yo moved slightly to cover me from view from the rest of the room, said &#39;my<br/>
mum nursed all of us till we were qite old, I can still remember it&#39; then sat<br/>
and chatted to me the whole time :-)<br/>
<br/>
I saw him for the first time in years about a month ago, in a bar at a get<br/>
together of dh&#39;s old work mates. He still tells rude jokes, made sexist<br/>
comments about attractive women who walked into the bar, etc. but how could I<br/>
hate him? I will always see past the bravado to the sweet sensitive guy that I<br/>
saw that day all those years ago.<br/>

Tell me about it!  My second child was my first nursing toddler. We lived in <br/>
Seattle at the time and he used the words &quot;nurse&quot; and &quot;titty&quot; Except that he <br/>
was not very articulate so all anyone heard was, &quot; Ah wan nuh&quot; or &quot;Ah wan <br/>
tee.&quot; When my youngest came along, I continued to use the same words. Then <br/>
when she was one we moved back to the East Coast. Before I knew it I had a <br/>
highly articulate toddler demanding,&quot; Give me titty!&quot; Oh well, it was a bit <br/>
embarrassing but we survived:&gt;) Thanks, Carol, for your great stories. They <br/>
really made me laugh! -Amalia-</div>
