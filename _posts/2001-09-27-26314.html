You might be teaching him to ignore you.<br/>

And do you really say &quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t...&quot; instead of &quot;I don&#39;t&quot;?<br/>
Try not to baby-talk him.<br/>

3 is too young to share, generally. They just aren&#39;t ready to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I would guess that he is now fighting because he has been basically forced,<br/>
as it would be from *his* point of view, to share through being told that it<br/>
is an important or essential characteristic of goodness. <br/>
<br/>
My dd has never been forced to share things that she owns, nor had any kind<br/>
of insistence made on doing it. I do all I can to facilitate her reluctance<br/>
to share as has been necessary, such as taking responsibility to say that<br/>
certain special toys are &quot;put up and not available to others today&quot; or<br/>
taking on the role of intermediary and saying things like, &quot;Jayn isn&#39;t ready<br/>
to share that toy today&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
The result is that Jayn now (starting from 4.5 or so) constantly and<br/>
generously shares almost all of her toys with her visitors and at the park.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You are talking about a three year old, right?  Three is really really <br/>
little.  When your three, or five, or even seven year old is your <br/>
oldest, it is easy to think of them as BIG.  They aren&#39;t though, no <br/>
matter how mature they seem at times, three year olds are very very <br/>
little.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I did a lot of distracting with my kids when they were <br/>
three.  I would also never expect other kids to share at the park and I <br/>
would *never* force my child to share their toys with others (especially <br/>
strangers).  Maybe the child that brought the large ride on toy to the <br/>
park doesn&#39;t have a place at home where they can play with it?  Why <br/>
should they have to give up their only time with their toy to others?  I <br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t let anyone touch my bicycle when I take it to the <br/>
park...  I also don&#39;t let anyone play with my car, or listen to my CDs, <br/>
or touch my bag, or take my food, etc.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, sharing is way overrated.<br/>

Montessori school (mom and dad would have unschooled if they&#39;d  <br/>
known).  When asked about sharing, the teachers would say to the  <br/>
parents, &quot;Would you share all you clothes with me?  How about your  <br/>
house?&quot;  And the point was taken.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>People generally DO share their bikes when we take them to our park  <br/>
days. And their scooters. And their sand toys. And their wooden  <br/>
swords. And their balls and even Game Boys. And we share food a LOT!  <br/>
(Amy goes to the same park day as I do, by the way.) Kids are  <br/>
encouraged to ask, not just pick up somebody else&#39;s stuff, but I know  <br/>
that parents talk to their kids before getting to the park and pretty  <br/>
much make sure that they don&#39;t bring things they don&#39;t want to share.  <br/>
Sometimes younger kids, 2 and 3 year olds, don&#39;t want to share and  <br/>
usually parents will try to put the item away or find an alternative  <br/>
for the child who wants the item.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a social faux pas to bring something VERY attractive  <br/>
and big and unusual and super cool to a &quot;group&quot; activity where the  <br/>
general &quot;culture&quot; is that things are brought and shared - and then  <br/>
not share it.  I&#39;m pretty sure that the person who brought it was  <br/>
someone not familiar with our group and most likely was just thinking  <br/>
that it was something fun for her child to play with at the park -  <br/>
not thinking of it as &quot;group&quot; time. I&#39;m also guessing that if there  <br/>
were problems with other kids that she&#39;ll most likely have realized  <br/>
it and won&#39;t do it again.<br/>
<br/>
Park days are mostly for kids to play with other kids - make  <br/>
friends.  It isn&#39;t very conducive to that when kids have super-cool  <br/>
toys that they won&#39;t share with other kids, so as a practical matter,  <br/>
it makes sense not to bring them to park days.<br/>

are clear as to which type of situation we are going<br/>

help? A &quot;toy-luck&quot; or a &quot;BYOT&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186445510">Why does he have to share? I missed that step in your e-mail.  <br/>
<br/>
He shares you with a 15 month old.  That is a lot to share.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
something he can control at all.  But, a toy, a piece of candy, a big<br/>
riding something at the park, all of those things can be held and kept<br/>
and enjoyed all by himself.  And a 15 month old can be distracted so<br/>
much more easily.  <br/>
<br/>
Forcing sharing often seems to produce children who no way no how want<br/>
to share.  I once watched a little 3 year old boy who&#39;d borrowed a<br/>
scooter from us at a campground and who had invented this really fun<br/>
game to play with it have it taken away from him by his mother because<br/>
some other little girl noticed that he was playing with it.  Not only<br/>
did she take the scooter away from him, but she then played with the<br/>
other little girl, leaving him with nothing to do and noone to play<br/>
with.  As I watched I thought about how he would learn very quickly to<br/>
play where no one could see him, how he would learn that enjoying<br/>
something publically could lead to having whatever he was playing with<br/>
be taken away from him.<br/>
<br/>
Simon and Linnaea, who will give away their last piece of chocolate<br/>
without thinking, or will search the house for toys they want to give<br/>
to friends before they go home, are far less likely to share with each<br/>
other than with any other person. There seem to be too many power<br/>
struggles between siblings to expect consistent sharing.  I just try<br/>
and give them space to not share, doing things like offering to play a<br/>
game with Linnaea when Simon won&#39;t let her play with his Yu-gi-oh<br/>
cards, or helping Simon find something special to eat when Linnaea<br/>
won&#39;t share something special to eat that she has.  It stops the<br/>
fighting between the two of them and takes away the sense of loss from<br/>
the one left out.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My dd has never been forced to share things that she owns, nor had any kind<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with all the people who say that 3-year-olds aren&#39;t ready/able to<br/>
share, and they do it willingly when they&#39;re not forced to.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of &quot;sharing&quot; can turn terrorizing. My 7yo used to bring her<br/>
scooter to a park day, and she would share it willingly with no problems.<br/>
One day, a group of girls got together and tried to enforce their rules for<br/>
when and how she shared the scooter upon her. A family who has a lot of<br/>
schooled children but also friends in the group had come that day, and those<br/>
children in particular seemed very fixated on *making* my daughter share. I<br/>
intervened when I saw what was going on. It was pretty awful -- a pack<br/>
chasing and yelling at her, telling her that she had to get off because it<br/>
was so-and-so&#39;s turn. When I came up, I think the girls expected me to help<br/>
them force the scooter from her. It had truly never been an issue before<br/>
that day -- she enjoyed seeing her friends have fun riding her scooter.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it&#39;s dramatically more of a challenge to set up the kind of<br/>
situation that Robyn describes when you have two toddlers!<br/>
<br/>
My 20-month-old and 3-year-old oftentimes will start grabbing things from<br/>
each other. The 20-month-old, for example, even when he has his own little<br/>
bowl of pomegranate seeds, might see that his older sister has some and try<br/>
to take hers from her as well. Which of course is completely developmentally<br/>
normal -- but I understand that it&#39;s hard on everyone, particularly my older<br/>
girl (in my family it&#39;s not helped by the fact that the younger one has a<br/>
naturally more aggressive quality *and* he weighs within a pound or two of<br/>
what she does). And sometimes either one of them will only want precisely<br/>
what the other one has.<br/>
<br/>
I think what helps is, yes, distraction and intervention. I don&#39;t mean in a<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s all sit down and share&quot; way, but in a &quot;Here, come sit down with me.<br/>
Let&#39;s read a book while you&#39;re eating the seeds&quot; -- and then place them on<br/>
different sides of me so it&#39;s less of an issue. Also, making sure that we<br/>
don&#39;t have a situation of scarcity: &quot;Would you like more seeds? We have<br/>
lots. I can cut another pomegranate.&quot; My little kids do love it when I give<br/>
them a *big* bowl of whatever -- I think they like the feeling of abundance<br/>
(I know I would). And, even though we have a lot of toys, we don&#39;t have as<br/>
many as might be needed a certain points; there&#39;s also the effect of one<br/>
toddler wanting whichever toy the other one has because its value is enhance<br/>
by its position in the other child&#39;s hands.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I assess the situation and see which of them seems to be<br/>
particularly interested in a given toy right then and there try to bring the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the AU list, we talk about *lots* of tools, primarily parenting tools <br/>
that fit in with and encourage an Unschooling lifestyle. It&#39;s a good <br/>
place to hang out with other mothers of young kids, dealing with similar <br/>
ages and stages in a way that naturally transitions into unschooling.<br/>

&gt; intimidation, the scream. I going to be really put out if he starts<br/>
&gt; peeing on things.===<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>3 year olds explore LOTS of things. That&#39;s their job, what they&#39;re <br/>
programmed to do. If you and your husband are making sharing into an <br/>
issue, something he &quot;must&quot; do because it&#39;s the &quot;right&quot; thing to do, then <br/>
*you* are creating the power struggle. You guys are creating an <br/>
environment where your son needs to resist in order to preserve his own <br/>
autonomy. You guys are setting up an adversarial relationship that your <br/>
son is picking up on and fitting in the best way he can. He&#39;s learning <br/>
all the nuances of being adversarial--quick before anyone can notice or <br/>
stop me, look really mean, be really loud.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ===My husband is of the school of &quot;do unto others&quot; he wants us to wander<br/>
&gt; around screaming and snatching things to &quot;show him&quot; &quot;what it&#39;s like&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ummm... NO===<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, no. Model the behavior you value. Modeling is your single <br/>
greatest tool at this age; kids learn from how they&#39;re treated. If you <br/>
want him to act badly, treat him badly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ===My Mom thinks he&#39;s too young and I should just distract him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ummmm... No===<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not? What&#39;s wrong with distraction? It doesn&#39;t work with all <br/>
children, but it&#39;s a great tool to defuse a situation and keep from <br/>
setting up an adversarial exchange. If you&#39;re trying to teach him a <br/>
lesson about sharing, then I can see why you might be hesitant to lose <br/>
an opportunity to do so. But, I&#39;d suggest that you focus on the joy of <br/>
relationship building and let go of the idea of teaching him lessons. <br/>
Let him learn from life by your modeling and your gentle involvement as <br/>
his ally, helping him get what he wants rather than foiling his desires <br/>
and bending him to your image of who you&#39;d like him to be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ===Up until now I&#39;ve always explained. Showed him how sad his sister<br/>
&gt; looks. How angry Daddy looks. Dear son, please notice how upset you<br/>
&gt; are when the boy at the park won&#39;t share the car he brought. Dear son,<br/>
&gt; please notice how much fun is had with you and your friends when you<br/>
&gt; share your toys. Mommy LOVES sharing with you. Mommy doesn&#39;t grab<br/>
&gt; things from you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; talk talk talk example example example<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and then at wits end &quot;Go to the bedroom and chill out&quot; NOW<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What am I missing here?===<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the problem is that your focus is still on making him share. <br/>
Pointing out how his choice affects his sister can be really helpful, <br/>
but not in the context of &quot;look how bad she feels, share now or take a <br/>
time out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found more successful is helping my kids negotiate use of <br/>
common toys and supporting their ownership over their own toys. So, my <br/>
approach might differ depending upon the ownership. Children need to own <br/>
their things in the same way we do. I wouldn&#39;t force dh to share his <br/>
ipod out of a principle that sharing is good, yet, he freely chooses to <br/>
share his older ipod shuffle with the kids. Sharing is good, generally <br/>
speaking, but not always and in all cases.<br/>
<br/>
If it were something of common ownership, I&#39;d help the kids arrive at a <br/>
solution that worked for them both. It&#39;s really hard to share. Start <br/>
there; start by validating and showing him that your on his side. Then <br/>
move to the observation of the other&#39;s reaction: she looks really sad <br/>
because she sees how much fun you&#39;re having with it. Then, I&#39;d ask if we <br/>
could come up with a solution, which with such young kids might end up <br/>
being as vague as &quot;could you tell her when you&#39;re done using it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Especially if your son has been forced to share, he will need lots of <br/>
time and space to get the idea that you&#39;re not going to force him to do <br/>
that anymore, to realize that you&#39;re on his side rather than against <br/>
him. What worked for us for quite a while was offering a specific time <br/>
frame or number of turns that made it easier for the waiting person, but <br/>
that was something we arrived at together rather than something I <br/>
imposed, and it was in the context of not being forced to give something <br/>
up. There were no time-outs or loss of something for a day backing it <br/>
up, only the idea that it is really hard to wait.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ===He went from not sharing to out and out straight in the eye <br/>
&gt; defiance ===<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, because he&#39;s trying to retain his sense of self, his sense of <br/>
sovereignty over himself. Can you re-read the words below and see how <br/>
adversarial they sound? How would you react to someone doing the same <br/>
thing to you? Defiant? I know I would.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; ===He wants to know what is going to happen when he doesn&#39;t share. Up<br/>
&gt; until now he&#39;s gotten a talk from mommy and the toy in question given<br/>
&gt; to the other child or taken out of the scenario for the rest of the <br/>
&gt; day.===<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ===Also, why am I so bothered by a child in our playgroup bringing a<br/>
&gt; large ride on toy and not sharing it with anyone? In our family the<br/>
&gt; rules is if you bring something to the group expect to share it with<br/>
&gt; the group. If you don&#39;t want to share it leave it at home.===<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe do some reading around about rules vs. principles. Think about the <br/>
difference for a while and see if it doesn&#39;t change your perspective; it <br/>
did mine. Sandra&#39;s collected some stuff here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with your mom.  My sister and her dh just adopted a little girl from<br/>
India.  If Morgan is doing something they would rather her not do or is<br/>
something that will hurt her, they don&#39;t get into a lengthy conversation<br/>
about it.  They simple distract and/or move her to something she can do.<br/>
Children don&#39;t understand adult chatter.  They learn mostly by doing.  So<br/>
IMHO I believe the distracting (ie. Moving to something new) or modeling the<br/>
behavior we want from them teaches far more than ranting or long<br/>
explanations.  My girls are 10 & 13 and that is what I still do with them.<br/>

&gt; three. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still do it, and my youngest is 13.<br/>
Sometimes when one of them is spinning off into hyperactive-land or getting <br/>
cranky and seeming on the edge of saying something regrettable, I will just <br/>
call him or her over and ask an unrelated question, or just say &quot;Are things going <br/>
okay?&quot; and it breaks the crazy-spell.   Sometimes the kid needs a moment away <br/>
and a mom to blame it on.   Sometimes he&#39;s really thirsty or hungry or just <br/>
needed a breather, and then goes back in and things are better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-IMO, sharing is way overrated.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s necessary at school, though, isn&#39;t it?   Maybe that&#39;s where it was <br/>
glorified.   <br/>
Twenty kids needed to share one see-saw (before they were declared to <br/>
dangerous to exist) and take turns on the swings, and all that.<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, my kids are really generous with each other when it <br/>
comes to video games, computers, food and cash.   It&#39;s been that way since they <br/>
were little, too, and I think it&#39;s because they were loved and attended to and <br/>
encouraged and they didn&#39;t feel needy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493504967">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I do think it&#39;s dramatically more of a challenge to set up the kind of<br/>
situation that Robyn describes when you have two toddlers!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it is even more important for children with siblings to be<br/>
supported in their personal ownership of certain toys or items. I&#39;m guessing<br/>
that there are a lot more toys that are &quot;group owned&quot;, as well as<br/>
hand-me-downs, in a larger family. Jayn has no difficulty in understanding<br/>
what is hers and what is not. It must be a whole different dynamic when some<br/>
things quite literally belong to all the kids.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Sometimes I assess the situation and see which of them seems to be<br/>
particularly interested in a given toy right then and there try to bring the<br/>
other one off to do something with just me alone. Sometimes I&#39;m wrong, and<br/>
there&#39;s a huge protest from the one I&#39;ve tried to distract -- or the one<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing is clear. Helping children with sharing, whether only&#39;s or<br/>
siblings, requires a lot of proactive energy on the part of the parents,<br/>
both to head off potential conflicts, and to resolve those that flare up<br/>
despite best intentions. The first step is to get away from the notion that<br/>
sharing is a crucial indication of character, so must be taught from the<br/>
earliest ages. <br/>

belong to which kid. My girls have so many common interests and so  <br/>
often it would be silly to have duplicates of the same items, so they  <br/>
share a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Robyn&#39;s point is a REALLY good one. When kids have had things of  <br/>
their own that are special and that they don&#39;t share - when their  <br/>
parents are supportive and protective of them not wanting to share,  <br/>
then they could be reminded of that at the park when a child has  <br/>
something they don&#39;t want to share. Might make it a little easier t  <br/>
understand. I could imagine saying, &quot;Maybe that is so-and-so&#39;s  <br/>
special toy, just like you have your special whateveritis.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I still think it isn&#39;t cool to take a super amazing wonderful BIG  <br/>
(hard to miss) toy to a park day and ride it all over the park and  <br/>
not let anybody else ride it. That&#39;s a parent not &quot;getting&quot; what park  <br/>
day will be like and how to help their own child make friends. But  <br/>
maybe there were extenuating circumstances that we don&#39;t know about -  <br/>
maybe the kid was scared to death to go to the park and mom really  <br/>
wanted to go and taking the special toy was a way both could be  <br/>
happy. Who knows?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, we have been in just such a scenario. Sam has a hard time being <br/>
with other people, sharing, making transitions, etc. (Some people may <br/>
have seen a bit of this at the picnic Sunday, though overall he was <br/>
amazing at the conference and saved much of his discharging for this <br/>
past week at home.) My girls, however, tend to be very social and like <br/>
to get out to things like park days. A couple times we&#39;ve been able to <br/>
be there and meet everyone&#39;s needs by bringing some toys that Sam and I <br/>
can play together and which he&#39;s NOT willing to share, usually small <br/>
toys that fit in a backpack and we set up somewhere off to the side on a <br/>
blanket. Not terribly sociable as far as Sam and I are concerned, but <br/>
for our family it works out as a win/ win. Sam and I get special time <br/>
together one on one and the girls get to play with their friends. <br/>
Sometimes this is the only way we can all get to park day. I try to <br/>
explain our situation as gently as possible to younger kids who wander <br/>
over, wanting to play, and occasionally Sam has chosen to share and <br/>
invite someone into his game.<br/>

forgetting. Distraction is a wonderful tool and I really shouldn&#39;t<br/>
knock it. We do us distraction more than anything else in our home. I<br/>
guess I just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t over using it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The evening after I wraote this I went and reread some of the NVC<br/>
website articles. I tries to look at this more from my sons<br/>
perspective. I thought about how Morgan has really gotten good at<br/>
walking lately and is in more and more of the house than ever before.<br/>
How she&#39;s better at following him than she was before and how he<br/>
doesn&#39;t get as much alone time as he used to. (he&#39;s more of an<br/>
introvert.) And of course how he hasn&#39;t had alot of Mommy alone time<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Friday night I made sure we snuggled a little extra. Saturday morning<br/>
instead of sitting in my chair and knitting I sat on the pillows with<br/>
Quin and his cars and played with him. When Morgan came over I made<br/>
sure to offer her something from a different group of toys than what<br/>
Quin was playing with. Then we talked about how hard it is sometimes<br/>
when other people come over to play, but how it&#39;s more fun with more<br/>
people too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, why am I so bothered by a child in our playgroup bringing a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I spent some time thinking about this one too. I don&#39;t share my car at<br/>
playgroup, though, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d mind either.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought about how a few months back my son didn&#39;t want to share<br/>
toys at playgroup. I didn&#39;t force him too but I also didn&#39;t &quot;watch&quot;<br/>
his toys for him either. He quickly learned it was alot of work to<br/>
actively hoarde his toys and it wasn&#39;t much fun either. <br/>
<br/>
I also thought about how the person didn&#39;t seem very familiar to me. I<br/>
though aout how I am much faster to share with my established friends<br/>
than with a complete stranger.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the analogy that was posted about the toy-luck or the BYOT. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son is 3 years and my daughter is 15 months<br/>

others and share and I want them to feel that as well. AND It fits<br/>

<br/>
The best way to get them to be generous is to be generous with them  <br/>

take time, but it works much better than making them.<br/>

child will have different challenges than unschooling three or four. Toy<br/>
squabbles are more likely with younger kids, though, who would have<br/>
difficulties understanding property rights even if there were a whole lot of<br/>
specific divisions.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve noticed, though, is that with the range of my kids&#39; ages that<br/>
there aren&#39;t a whole lot of toys that *everyone* wants to play with,<br/>
particularly at the same time. And the older kids have more possessions that<br/>
are &quot;theirs.&quot; <br/>

The best way to get them to be generous is to be generous with them  <br/>
-- while not expecting them to be generous in return. :-) It will  <br/>
take time, but it works much better than making them.<br/>

 <br/>
And TOO often, children who are *made* to share start to *hoard* and <br/>
NOT share because they can&#39;t trust to be able to hold on to their own stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
You *can* force someone to share---as long as you are in control. Selfishness<br/>
happens when what&#39;s yours never feels as if it really IS.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve found that the most generous people have been &quot;only&quot; children who never <br/>
really *had* to share with a sibling.<br/>
 <br/>
Be generous. They will too when they&#39;re ready. <br/>

Right.<br/>
<br/>
I think forced sharing isn&#39;t really *sharing*, it&#39;s actually *lack of <br/>
ownership*.<br/>

We&#39;ve seen this happen with our own children, now 15, 11, and 7.5.  When<br/>
they were young we tried never to &#39;make&#39; them share anything that belonged<br/>
to them.  If they wanted to share, that was fine, and if they didn&#39;t want to<br/>
share, that was fine too.  My mother was the one who pointed out to us that<br/>
nobody forces adults to share possessions, so nobody should force children<br/>
to share theirs either.  The only guidance our children have received with<br/>
respect to sharing and generosity has been the modeling of the behavior from<br/>
the adults in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
This past Thursday my 15 year old spent the majority of the day at the mall<br/>
with one of her friends.  She took her hard-earned babysitting money with<br/>
her to buy a few outfits for herself.  She did buy a lot of cute clothes for<br/>
herself, but what struck me the most is that she also came home with a pair<br/>
of earrings for her 11-year-old sister, a rubber, Lance Armstrong-type<br/>
bracelet for her brother (he collects bracelets like that), a bar of Godiva<br/>
chocolate for me, and one for her dad.<br/>
<br/>
My mom told me it would happen naturally if we didn&#39;t force it and, as<br/>
usual, she was right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576082158">I would also like to clarify. I was not upset with the<br/>
Mom or the child for not sharing. My son had been<br/>
upset so I took him for a walk around the pond and we<br/>
discussed/remembered times when he and sometimes his<br/>
friends didn&#39;t want to share and how it feels on both<br/>
sides of the equation. He then decided to play in a<br/>
different area where he couldn&#39;t see the car. <br/>
<br/>
My comment was at the end of my post on sharing. I was<br/>
wondering why days later I was still stuck on the<br/>
incident.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out to be the mixed messages I had grown up<br/>
with about sharing. Which I&#39;ve been sorting out over<br/>
the weekend. As well as how that translates to me<br/>
being an example to my children and how I react to<br/>
their sharing or not.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my son really wanted to play with that little<br/>
boy but he couldn&#39;t get past the car to play with him.<br/>
I felt sad for both of them. I would really like to<br/>
see them at the park again. <br/>
