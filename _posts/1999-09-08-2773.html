<div id="ygrps-yiv-329431506">Re: how do they learn math symbols and math on paper:<br/>
Seems that if I child understands math concepts, it should be fairly easy<br/>
to learn the symols when needed.  We have to internalize &quot;oneness&quot; of<br/>
something before we can understand what &quot;1&quot; really means.  (borrowing<br/>
from John Holt here).<br/>
Same is true of writing.  If you can&#39;t formulate a coherent thought in a<br/>
conversation, how could you be expected to write anything meaningful?<br/>
