<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226460140">Hi Bob,<br/>
My name is Tempe, and we&#39;ve been homeschooling since the fall. My <br/>
daughter went to K last year in the public school. She did well, but <br/>
to me, it all ended up feeling very packed. The amount of material <br/>
they are required to pack in in a year seemed so much. She learned <br/>
to read, which on one hand is good, and on the other hand I&#39;m of the <br/>
mind that I think doing that in K is a little early. At the time, I <br/>
was still working full time and very pregnant with our third child, <br/>
so homeschooling didn&#39;t seem like a possibility. But by April, I <br/>
left work and stayed at home with the two youngest. And by April my <br/>
daughter was coming home saying school was &quot;boring...all we do is <br/>
work, work, work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was already thinking about homeschooling (I had thought about it <br/>
since before we had kids) and had read lots (I highly recommend John <br/>
Holt - Teach Your Own and Learning All the Time are two I&#39;ve read, <br/>
Linda Dobson, Ann Larson Fischer).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I used the summer as a trial period to see how it might be <br/>
staying home all the time with three. It was great. We went to the <br/>
beach, had playdates, went to a few fairs and festivals and mostly <br/>
played!<br/>
<br/>
I had been thinking about maybe making up my own curriculum, or <br/>
maybe unschooling, but started feeling anxious just before <br/>
the &quot;official&quot; school year started. And yet I could see how the kids <br/>
were indeed &quot;learning all the time&quot;. It&#39;s amazing to witness! <br/>
Needless to say I started the year with some bought curriculum, and <br/>
there were some really good books we read from it, but overall by <br/>
the end of the first quarter, it felt like i was pulling teeth. My <br/>
daughter was resistant to daily reading aloud, and to the math <br/>
workbook, and one day I just followed my heart and said to myself&quot; <br/>
Okay, I&#39;ll try it for a few days (unschooling), and ujst see what <br/>
happens.&quot; Well, it was two days later that I found my daughter and <br/>
son (4) curled up in their closet and she was reading to him. It <br/>
brought tears to my eyes. Once i took the pressure off, she did this <br/>
stuff on her own, because she wanted to! And they played and played <br/>
all day. That was all I needed. I could see that in everything we <br/>
did in a day they were learning. From then on we&#39;ve been <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is learning math and amazes me what she can figure out <br/>
in her head on her own, but we&#39;re not using workbooks and I&#39;m not <br/>
quizzing her, it just happens in our daily life. We weigh things at <br/>
the store. We compare things - size, weight, whatever.We play games <br/>
with money and the kids pay for things with their own money <br/>
sometimes. A lot of what the kids do is play, but i can see that <br/>
they learn so much from that. We play board games, we read a lot <br/>
before bedtime, we paint, cut, glue, listen to all sorts of music. <br/>
She doesn&#39;t write a lot, but she can when she wants to. She asks for <br/>
help spelling what she wants. We take walks and talk about things we <br/>
see. My daughter fell in love with a song we have by Mary Chapin <br/>
Carpenter, called &quot;Halley came to Jackson&quot;. We have it on a tape <br/>
that has that same song on both sides, so it will play over and over <br/>
in our car tape deck - That song got us talking about comets, and <br/>
about Halley and Hale-Bopp and that I had seen Hale-Bopp, and how <br/>
old would each of us be the next time Halley comes around (every 76 <br/>
yrs). And so on and so on.<br/>
<br/>
My experience has been that you just have to try it and be open to <br/>
seeing all kids learn in just living everyday life. And as others <br/>
have said, you can put things in their path and if it interests <br/>
them, you can go with helping them find out more of what they want <br/>
to know/experience.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is long. I have one more thing...not a day goes by when i <br/>
don&#39;t think about how grateful i am to be at home with my kids <br/>
homeschooling. It&#39;s often when we&#39;re outside playing, and I think <br/>
about how &quot;right now my daughter would be inside, in school&quot; or the <br/>
bus goes by at 4 and I think, &quot;Winter would just be getting home <br/>
now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! And Easy Does It...The idea of unschooling can be <br/>
overwhelming because it is unstructured, but it&#39;s worth it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341283920">Hi Tempe,<br/>
<br/>
You certainly don&#39;t need to apologize about the length of your <br/>
response. I loved reading it. I nearly got tears in my eyes, too. I <br/>
know what you mean about watching your little ones and just <br/>
appreciating them for who and what they are right then and there. I <br/>
remember taking Hannah to preschool two years ago and how she cried <br/>
when we left her, how I couldn&#39;t carry her in from the car, because <br/>
she&#39;d struggle and not want me to put her down. And as I think back, <br/>
I feel so sad and wonder &quot;why?&quot; Why was it so important that she go <br/>
to preschool, or sign up for soccer, or do all the other things that <br/>
all the other kids were doing? <br/>
<br/>
I feel like we were putting expectations on her to be something or <br/>
someone that she wasn&#39;t ready to be and I feel bad about it now. My <br/>
daughter loved to learn even before we sent her to preschool. I can&#39;t <br/>
say that preschool has increase it any, and perhaps decreased it a <br/>
little. The only thing that I feel preschool has done for her is <br/>
teach her how to &quot;fit in&quot; in the social scene of the other preschool <br/>
kids. And who really cares about that anyway?! She&#39;s learned how to <br/>
whine. She&#39;s mastered it actually. :) No doubt something that works <br/>
when you&#39;re trying to convince another preschooler to play the game <br/>
you want to play, and likely something she sees modeled on a day-to-<br/>
day basis.<br/>
<br/>
It was nice to read about your family and I&#39;m glad that homeschooling <br/>
and more specifically unschooling is working for you. I&#39;ll be sure to <br/>
read your response to my wife (I plan to read them all to her) and <br/>
I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be encouraged by your experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for taking the time to write that &quot;long&quot; response. I <br/>
enjoyed it all!<br/>
<br/>
Bob</div>
