<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343887811">Well, here&#39;s an interesting article about British schoolkids. Homeschoolers <br/>
probab;ly couldn&#39;t pull this off because there probably aren&#39;t enough of <br/>
us--and more importantly, we could never agree on the logistics.  ;)<br/>

Children Cause Earthquake in Giant Jump<br/>
<br/>
By Michael Holden<br/>
Reuters<br/>
<br/>
LONDON (Sept. 6) - Around a million British school children succeeded in <br/>
causing an earthquake Friday, jumping up and down simultaneously in the <br/>
world&#39;s largest scientific experiment.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of schools around Britain were asked to send children out into the <br/>
playgrounds at 11 a.m. local time to jump up and down for a minute in hopes <br/>
of creating a measurable quake.<br/>
<br/>
Organizers of the Giant Jump event, held to mark the launch of the <br/>
government&#39;s Science Year, said it had been a success.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;We&#39;re almost sure we had a million people out there jumping for us. We got <br/>
some kind of result at every single seismometer around the country,&#39;&#39; Nigel <br/>
Pain, director of Science Year, told Reuters.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;We generated something like a hundredth of a serious earthquake -- that&#39;s <br/>
not an enormous amount of energy but it&#39;s significant.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The exact number of people taking part would have to be verified, but he said <br/>
it was an unofficial world record.<br/>
<br/>
Early estimates suggested 75,000 tons of energy had been released during the <br/>
minute of jumping.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Because it&#39;s dissipated across the whole country it didn&#39;t do very much <br/>
damage. But drop that in one spot and it would have caused quite a big hole <br/>
in the ground,&#39;&#39; he added.<br/>
<br/>
Over the next two weeks the results from around the country will be analyzed <br/>
to see if the event registered on the Richter scale.<br/>
<br/>
Scientists said a million children with an average weight of 110 pounds <br/>
jumping 20 times in a minute would release two billion joules of energy and <br/>
trigger the equivalent of an earthquake measuring three on the Richter scale.<br/>
<br/>
The event has also attracted serious attention from scientists including the <br/>
Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), which maintains Britain&#39;s nuclear <br/>
warheads.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately the world didn&#39;t split in two as one of the children surveyed <br/>
before the event believed would happen, nor did the Earth leave the Sun&#39;s <br/>
orbit as feared by another.<br/>
<br/>
A third came up with a more likely, if less exciting scenario: &#39;&#39;There will <br/>
be lots of hospital visits from people with sprained ankles.&#39;&#39;<br/>
