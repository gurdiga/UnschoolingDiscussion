<div id="ygrps-yiv-701408737">Hello all,<br/>
  I think my waiting period is up -if this message posts than it&#39;s true!<br/>
<br/>
  My question is :  with 3 children, I would like to enjoy their activities<br/>
with them, but they&#39;re often at different ends of the house!  Below you&#39;ll<br/>
find my story regarding av stuff in our house, but I&#39;m not able to be with<br/>
each of them as I was before we started tv/video games since they&#39;re<br/>
splitting up around the house.  My ds is loving the video games, while my<br/>
daughter wants to garden with me in the sunshine.  I&#39;m feeling so torn!  And<br/>
then there&#39;s the 2 year old that&#39;s either running in between or wrecking<br/>
their projects (in their minds) etc.  Before tv/video games, we would often<br/>
do crafts together at the table, etc. and I would at least *feel* like I was<br/>
spending time with them.  How have other parents balanced their time with<br/>
each of their children?  Is it the squeaky wheel?  Inviting them to be near<br/>
you?  Taking turns which child you are spending time with?  In increments of<br/>
time, or until games or mini-projects (is - planting her flower) is done??<br/>
<br/>
  I have been transformed lately by moving towards letting go of controlling<br/>
my kids lives, and letting them make their decisions.  I was doing that<br/>
already in many areas of their lives, however I was very controlling when it<br/>
came to tv, video games, and videos.  I have completely switched, now<br/>
letting them play/watch whenever they want.  They were thrilled!  I&#39;m<br/>
definitely going through growing pains, at the same time feeling really<br/>
surprised by some of the positive fallouts that I hadn&#39;t anticipated - such<br/>
as much more open communication, more open processing of feelings with my ds<br/>
(video games are either *really* frustrating or *really* exciting - gives us<br/>
lots of opportunity).  I&#39;m still having reservations, but I&#39;m trying to just<br/>
*be* with this process.<br/>
<br/>
