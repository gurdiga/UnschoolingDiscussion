<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163091816"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When you control money you &quot;give&quot; your kid, the amount you control is not<br/>
&gt; allowance. If there&#39;s some left over that the child can spend (or save, or<br/>
&gt; give away) at his/her discretion, that amount is the actual allowance.<br/>

With all due respect, I disagree.  Our son has a choice where every cent of<br/>
it goes.  As you might recall, the 10% to save and 10% to &quot;things bigger<br/>
than self&quot; was &quot;OUR deal with him&quot;.  He was part of that decision, and we<br/>
showed him what 10% of his money would look like.  Those amounts are<br/>
principles my husband and I live by, and Tim, wanting to be like his<br/>
parents, like those amounts, too.  (The child is 6.  He still wants to be<br/>
like his parents.  It&#39;s nice.)  Since we as a family believe in supporting<br/>
&quot;good&quot; beyond our home, he chooses to whom his church/charity money goes.<br/>
And his long-term savings are for *his* expenses; however, putting a set<br/>
amount aside each week helps him see how to plan for future needs without<br/>
losing a great deal of today&#39;s money.  It&#39;s been impressive to him that so<br/>
little money each week (.50 euro cents) turns into a lot in not very long.<br/>
(That&#39;s a worthwhile lesson, I think, especially considering the number of<br/>
folks I know that have absolutely no savings.)<br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s about learning to manage money.  It&#39;s not about my control of<br/>
his money, but about his control of his money.<br/>
