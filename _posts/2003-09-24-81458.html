<div id="ygrps-yiv-60314470">As well as Algebra Unplugged, which was already mentioned, I&#39;ve enjoyed <br/>
Algebra Survival Guide by Josh Rappaport. It&#39;s written in question and answer <br/>
format and is very understandable. Key to Algebra from Key Press is also a <br/>
possibility. Pages are easy on the eyes and it is very non-threatening looking.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought of this with regard to the National Geographic . . .all the <br/>
issues, back to 1888 are on Cd ROM. We&#39;ve enjoyed looking at these, although I <br/>
still like the pictures in the actual magazines better!<br/>

Thank you. She did do the Key To Press Algebra last year but <br/>
didn&#39;t retain a thing. :( We&#39;ll look for that Survival Guide. Thanks <br/>
again.<br/>
