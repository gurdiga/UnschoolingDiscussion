<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588073966">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I have a five-year-old that I plan on homeschooling, or better yet unschooling.  I&#39;m getting tired of people saying, he must be in kindergarten.  Then I said I plan on homeschooling and they look at me like I have twelve heads. My mom, who is not fond of the idea is nagging me about &quot;getting started&quot; with Parker&#39;s education.  <br/>
 <br/>
My question I have is on unschooling.  I don&#39;t even mention to others that I&#39;m planning on this because I feel it would be like pouring rubbing alcohol on an open wound.  How, what when do I start all this?  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218095269">You begin with yourself.  Your son already knows what to do.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t need to change anything he&#39;s doing.  You need to find a way <br/>
to get comfortable with telling people that you love your son so <br/>
much that you&#39;d only do what is best for him and you feel that <br/>
homeschooling is what is best.  You don&#39;t need to explain to <br/>
everyone, either.  Certain people in your life care about your son <br/>
and want to know he&#39;s ok, but others are only being nosy.  You know <br/>
who is who.  I know it&#39;s not easy to go against the mainstream, but <br/>
everyone of us on this list is doing it.  I still have people in my <br/>
life that think my kids should be in school, but I just talk about <br/>
the weather when I see them, or a friendlier subject, like politics--<br/>
lol.  We have agreed to disagree.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep reading all you can about unschooling and one day you will have <br/>
the confidence and conviction that will either convince others, or <br/>
shut them up.  There&#39;s lots of great articles on sandradodd.com plus <br/>
you can hang out here and the other unschooling lists.  <br/>

Jayn always answers that we are homeschooling to outsiders asking school<br/>
questions. Unschooling is too tough a concept to explain to those who don&#39;t<br/>
have a compelling interest or desire to really understand.<br/>
<br/>
You might like to also join UnschoolingBasics@yahoogroups.com which focuses<br/>
more on people beginning the process than this list. But don&#39;t take that as<br/>
an invitation to leave here! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Read all the Unschooling articles and stuff at www.sandradodd.com. After<br/>
that you might try &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter. You<br/>
might enjoy &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; although a lot of that information<br/>
will come to you for free over time if you stay on this list and U/B.<br/>
<br/>
You may be able to find some good articles about the fallacy of Early<br/>
Academics for your mom. She might enjoy some John Holt. I am lucky because<br/>
mine lives in another State, and I don&#39;t have to field her lack of<br/>
understanding very often. I focus on telling her what cool things Jayn is<br/>
doing, and letting Mum quantify for herself the learning in the activities.<br/>
When she starts on what Jayn &quot;should&quot; be doing, I *immediately* end the<br/>
conversation cheerfully: &quot;No she shouldn&#39;t well gotta go love you&quot; Click.<br/>
Then I send her further information via e-mail. I have posted before about<br/>
finding a source that she respects for that info.<br/>
<br/>
Ensure that you have a clear idea of the laws in your state. www.nhen.org<br/>
and click on the Legislation link. In my case, CA, I still have a year of no<br/>
paperwork to go, so I can get doubters to be quiet with, &quot;She&#39;s not school<br/>
age yet anyhow, just extra tall.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Join a secular, inclusive play-focused support group in your area, but don&#39;t<br/>
get sucked into too many &quot;reading readiness&quot; or &quot;curriculum&quot; conversations.<br/>
I say secular, because many of the religious based groups focus heavily on<br/>
religious curriculums and classes rather than free play at the park. One of<br/>
the things I need to do for my personal sanity is keep out of school<br/>
conversations, including school-bashing and horror stories, although<br/>
sometimes a few of these are good for silencing the opinionated.<br/>
<br/>
Just begin by playing, just like you probably have been doing. Keep<br/>
reminding yourself that everything is learning. Live in the present without<br/>
a secret agenda of educational goals on any timetable. Be ready for wonder,<br/>
joy, sparkling inventions and a journey of truly knowing your child&#39;s<br/>
authentic personality and individual brilliance.<br/>
<br/>
Here is fairy tale I wrote a little while ago. Welcome to the walking park.<br/>
<br/>
***********************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time there was a place where almost all the people lived on a<br/>
train. The train went forward at a great pace and of course stayed on the<br/>
tracks, so the view was the same from all the windows. Most of families<br/>
stayed in the same carriage for the whole journey.<br/>
<br/>
Some families didn&#39;t care for the train, so they got on their bicycles<br/>
instead. Many of these families followed right beside the train, and pedaled<br/>
as hard as they needed to, to stay with it. Others followed the increasingly<br/>
numerous bike paths that were set up that started at the depot and ended at<br/>
the terminus, but were often more winding and scenic than the train route.<br/>
<br/>
At some distance from the tracks, was a garden park that was full of<br/>
walkers. The walkers meandered around sometimes, and at other times were<br/>
seen to be walking briskly forward or even jogging. To the astonishment of<br/>
passing cyclists, sometimes walkers in the beautiful garden were seen to be<br/>
lounging around on the grass, or smelling the flowers. As for the people on<br/>
the train, they could barely see the garden, let alone notice the<br/>
inhabitants.<br/>
<br/>
At the gateway to the garden there was always a gate keeper. People who had<br/>
jumped off the train, as well as the occasional passing cyclist would<br/>
inquire about how to get in, and the gate keeper would smile and say that it<br/>
was a walking park, and the only thing inside was foot traffic. Sometimes<br/>
hostile cyclists would come close to the gate and shout out that the walkers<br/>
weren&#39;t going anywhere and should be cycling also, or try to show off with<br/>
trick riding, but the walkers would always just keep walking, sitting,<br/>
jogging or dancing along, having such a good time that lots of folks<br/>
abandoned their bikes and joined in.<br/>
<br/>
One day a cyclist arrived at the gate and wanted to go cycling in the park,<br/>
because it looked so beautiful. The gate keeper said, &quot;This is a walking<br/>
park. There are no directions, or maps, or paths.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The cyclist replied, &quot;But this is a free country and I should be able to<br/>
cycle if I want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The gate keeper said, &quot;Then go cycle. There are hundreds of bike paths, but<br/>
this is a walking park.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The cyclist said, &quot;You can get along so much faster on a bike. There are<br/>
fewer distractions. Biking is better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The gate keeper said, &quot;Biking is not better in a walking park. The people<br/>
who are walking here have agreed that no-one can ride a bike in here. Your<br/>
bike will be perfectly safe outside the gate if you ever want to come out<br/>
and use it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The cyclist went off in a huff, but was back the next day. <br/>
She said, &quot;What if I agree to walk, can I go in and carry my bike?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Walking in the beautiful park is way harder if you are hauling around your<br/>
useless bike. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; How, what when do I start all  this? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re already starting by researching all you can. Reading here, for  <br/>
example. Read John Holt&#39;s books in order. Want a dose of &quot;stay away from  school at <br/>
all costs&quot;? Read John Taylor Gatto (good ammo for grandparents and  friends). <br/>
Alfie Kohn. Valerie Fitzenreiter.<br/>
 <br/>
Start looking for the learning that&#39;s happening every day NOW, so that  <br/>
you&#39;re not unfamiliar with it when he becomes &quot;school age&quot;. Maybe write down  what <br/>
he&#39;s doing so that you CAN see it (sometimes the printed word is more  <br/>
powerful than just thinking it in your head).<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s much easier to just keep on doing what you&#39;re doing than it is to be  in <br/>
the school system for several years and THEN try to make the leap! You&#39;re  <br/>
already ahead of the game! &lt;g&gt; The more comfortable *YOU* feel about  <br/>
unschooling, the easier it is to explain to others and to accept that what  you&#39;re doing <br/>
is good and right. Start getting comfortable! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-806899403">We&#39;ve been planning on homeschooling/unschooling since DS was little <br/>
(he&#39;s 6 now, we decided by the time he was walking). Anyhow, we <br/>
generally just said &quot;homeschooling&quot; and didn&#39;t even go into <br/>
unschooling with most people. However, now that we&#39;re &#39;established&#39; <br/>
ie DS is a year past &quot;school age&quot;, as a way to &quot;break the ice&quot; and <br/>
introduce the idea, when folks asked us about weekend plans and such <br/>
recently, we talked about the unschooling conference we were excited <br/>
about going to/had a great time at. That broached the subject. Those <br/>
who caught it, asked about it - the rest just &quot;assumed&quot; it was the <br/>
same as homeschooling (whatever that conjures in their minds) and <br/>
moved along.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found interesting in the last couple of weeks - since the <br/>
conference specifically - is people asking DS about school. They&#39;ll <br/>
say &quot;Did you start school yet?&quot; or &quot;What grade are you in this <br/>
year?&quot; or something and he says &quot;I don&#39;t go to school.&quot; So, they <br/>
move on to &quot;Oh, so does Daddy/Mommy teach you at home?&quot; And he <br/>
says &quot;No, I teach myself&quot;. They give a little smile - that kind of <br/>
grown-up look that says Oh you think you teach yourself huh? And <br/>
then I&#39;ll say He&#39;s exactly right. And the smile sort of drifts as <br/>
they try to sort out what that means. I&#39;ve had some good discussions <br/>
of the concepts lately with some friends on unschooling. What is <br/>
interesting to me is the confidence and firmness in DS&#39; tone when he <br/>
says that - he used to just defer to me or DH after the initial &quot;No <br/>
I don&#39;t go to school&quot;. I think seeing all those other kids who live <br/>
life the way he does really had an impact - even though we basically <br/>
hung out in the pool most of the weekend.</div>

That&#39;s a great one!  I just suggested it to a friend yesterday at our<br/>
unschoolers&#39; get together.  She&#39;s going out west to spend a week with<br/>
in-laws who are not keen on homeschooling, not to mention unschooling!<br/>
