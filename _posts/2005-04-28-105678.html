The author joined the list specifically to send this, and so asking her to  <br/>
read for a week or two seems inappropriate, but approving a post does too.   So <br/>
in a compromise move, I have stripped off the quoted posts and am  sending <br/>
the text of the message.<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t need to discuss the particulars of a conference here.  Let&#39;s  stick <br/>
to the philosophical differences and generalities, please. <br/>

SUBJECT: Not really unschoolers <br/>
<br/>
Greetings  Chris and Tuckerville,<br/>
<br/>
I saw each of your posts on this list and would  like to comment, as both the<br/>
founder and producer of the Rethinking Education  Conference series in Dallas<br/>
(our next conference is coming up, visit  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rethinkingeducation.com">http://www.rethinkingeducation.com</a><br/>
for details) and a follower of TCS for  many years.  First, to address Chris&#39;<br/>
memory of a few years back in  which a child at the conference called 911<br/>
(not once but twice!).  At no  point did I or other conference organizers<br/>
explain away the seriousness of  the incident as &quot;kids will be kids&quot;.  In<br/>
fact, as soon as police showed  up in response to the 911 call, the organizer<br/>
at the microphone (we were in  the middle of our Talent Show) asked for<br/>
parents&#39; help in finding the culprit  and resolving the problem.  Many<br/>
parents left the room immediately to  check on their children and a young boy<br/>
admitted to his father that he had  dialed 911, not having any idea that<br/>
police would show up, much less that it  was a felony to commit this act.<br/>
The father and mother both pulled the boy  aside and then addressed the<br/>
audience with an apology.  After a  discussion with the police, it was<br/>
determined that the act was not  malevolent, but innocent.  No charges were<br/>
filed and no further  incidents occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Further, I don&#39;t have any reason to believe that a  TCS audience, child or<br/>
family would permit a criminal, dangerous or felonious  act to be committed<br/>
by their child.  Tuckerville in my estimation  misunderstands TCS philosophy<br/>
when stating &quot;the child can flat out refuse to  consider anyone else&#39;s<br/>
feelings,  needs and desires, and the parent  would be philosophy-bound not<br/>
to coerce them  in any way, regardless of  the direness of the situation.&quot;<br/>
My experience and study of TCS tells me that  while it is never appropriate<br/>
to coerce a child to right action, a TCS parent  would never stand by to<br/>
witness a child engaged in activity dangerous to  himself or another.  The<br/>
parent would be compelled to remove the child  from the situation, e.g., the<br/>
classic argument of the child running into a  busy highway.   This is a<br/>
crucial element of the philosophy not  often discussed, and in my personal<br/>
experience not an issue where TCS is the  standard, consistent parenting<br/>
model.  <br/>
<br/>
In my experience and  study of TCS, in families where the authoritarian model<br/>
of parenting is being  replaced with a TCS model, there can be quite a lot of<br/>
fluctuation in  behavior, both from the children and the parents, as everyone<br/>
struggles to  establish solidarity and reliability in communication style.<br/>
As a parent who  has raised three children, now grown, with a TCS approach<br/>
(although frankly I  never knew there was a label for it, now known as TCS),<br/>
I can attest to the  complete lack of motive a child has to rebel or act in<br/>
dangerous behavior  when raised in an environment where his parents can<br/>
ALWAYS be trusted to give  their honest opinions,  give reliable information<br/>
on all subjects the  child is curious about, and both respected and trusted<br/>
to make the best  decisions for both himself and others affected by his<br/>
decisions (all TCS  tenets).  A child raised in such an atmosphere seeks his<br/>
parents&#39;  opinions and counsel and while he might not always follow the<br/>
advice, he  knows his decision will be respected.<br/>
<br/>
I have been a part of discussions  and debate on TCS for years, and I<br/>
sympathize with the difficulty in  understanding it and putting it into play<br/>
- it certainly is a radical  alternative from the traditional parenting model<br/>
of &quot;do what I say because I  said so&quot;.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, TCS is a<br/>
revolutionary approach with  great promise.<br/>
