 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you failed at learning nothing new that day.  I know your question<br/>
(above) isn&#39;t really the point, but I figured maybe you&#39;d like to fail again<br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
A solo instrument doesn&#39;t need a conductor, and neither does a small group.<br/>
Everybody can see each other, and they can watch and listen.<br/>
<br/>
In an orchestra, people can&#39;t see each other very well, and there is a<br/>
slight sound lag from back to front and side to side.  So first and<br/>
foremost, the conductor is there to beat time.  Sort of like a silent<br/>
metronome.  The conductor is also &#39;driving the train&#39;, and will speed up and<br/>
slow down to enhance the music.<br/>
<br/>
Also very important, though, is his or her ability to interpret the music<br/>
and convey their interpretative wishes to the musicians.  If you have 100<br/>
people in the orchestra, trust me, they have 100 different ideas on how the<br/>
music should sound.  My quartet (4 people) sits around for hours on end<br/>
playing the same pieces and arguing over interpretation.  Imagine that<br/>
multiplied by 100. <br/>
<br/>
So the conductor, during rehearsals, stops the group, makes comments like,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;d like a more rich sound at this point&quot;, and &quot;I can&#39;t hear the oboe<br/>
melody very well at this spot, so the strings are too loud&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The very best conductors can do that quickly, precicely, and with a minimum<br/>
of words.  They can show what they want through their gestures.  Saves time<br/>
stopping and starting, and allows them to make adjustment even during<br/>
performances.  That&#39;s important because time is money, and precious few<br/>
groups have sufficient rehearsal time.<br/>
<br/>
And, in rare event that somebody DIDN&quot;T know their part very well, the<br/>
conductor can help them get &quot;un-lost&quot;.  No chance your conductor is<br/>
superfluous.  <br/>

<br/>
And sometimes it happens that one person is waiting for a musical cue from <br/>
another one, but that person is off, or late, or some other musical <br/>
trainwreck in the making, and the conductor will catch that and wave cues to <br/>
both of them to get them back with the group.  Sometimes when a conductor <br/>
seems momentarily intense and panicked it&#39;s that someone slipped and there&#39;s <br/>
danger of others slipping on the same slippage. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After so much vocal music, now when I get single-part music and can&#39;t see the <br/>
other parts I&#39;m really not thrilled.  It&#39;s kind of a fun challenge, like a <br/>
maze, when the music&#39;s unfamiliar.  But I&#39;m getting older and less patient <br/>
with musical mazes.  I want to see the whole thing.  With orchestral music, <br/>
having each person have a score wouldn&#39;t work at all, though.  Conductors <br/>
turn pages A LOT. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

played in an orchestra that had to stop and start again because of a train<br/>
wreck.  I hope I never have to again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They may know their part, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve got it memorized.<br/>
If you&#39;re expecting to hear a certain bit and don&#39;t hear it, then you have<br/>
to wait until you hear something else that&#39;s familiar before jumping in.<br/>
Sometimes one whole section will jump in at the wrong time, so that the<br/>
orchestra is actually in two different places at once.  It&#39;s not that hard<br/>
to do.  Imagine that you&#39;ve got 8 measure rest on two consecutive lines of<br/>
your music.  They&#39;re even about the same place on the line.  Many is the<br/>
time I&#39;ve jumped down to the second one and gotten hopelessly lost.  Only<br/>
the conductor can straighten that one out, if she&#39;s lucky.  Granted, this<br/>
pretty well never happens with professionals.  But the conductor does a lot<br/>
more than keep the group together.  She&#39;s right out front and hears<br/>
essentially what the audience hears.  If she can&#39;t hear that important<br/>
little bit from the oboes because the first violins are too loud, the<br/>
audience won&#39;t be able to hear it either.  Of course the violins ought to be<br/>
listening for the oboe and play softer if they can&#39;t hear it, but there are<br/>
tons of other things they have to think about at the same time.  The<br/>
conductor can motion for less sound, and they&#39;ll see it and respond right<br/>
away.  *If* they&#39;re pros.  We have some in one of our orchestras who never<br/>
seem to look up at all.  &lt;g&gt;  The rest of the orchestra has to carry them<br/>
along.  And then there&#39;s the fact that an orchestral piece will almost never<br/>
have the same tempo all the way through.  There might be a section that&#39;s<br/>
meant to go slower.  Somebody has to decide how much slower, and that&#39;s the<br/>
conductor.  In a small group, one person would be designated as the leader,<br/>
but in a big group not everyone would be able to see that person.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Realize that we&#39;re talking about large groups here, Kelly.  Orchestras or<br/>
marching bands, that size.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played orchestras where I wasn&#39;t the best cellist (quite often!), and<br/>
from 6 stands back, just in front of the trombones or percussion (depending<br/>
on the setup), I can&#39;t hear ANYTHING.  Yes, I know my part.  And there are<br/>
probably 9 other people playing it.  But I can&#39;t hear them well, either.<br/>
<br/>
Now imagine how the first oboe player feels.  She (he?) has 212 measures of<br/>
rest, and she thinks she has counted them right.  But it&#39;s hard to hear for<br/>
sure, because she sits right in front of the 4 french horns, and they&#39;re all<br/>
playing full out right now and she&#39;s going deaf.  But when they&#39;re done, the<br/>
strings will noodle away softly and she&#39;ll play her pretty solo part.  Let<br/>
me tell you, if she doesn&#39;t come in there, it&#39;s trainwreck time!  The<br/>
strings know there is a problem, but how to solve it?  Repeat the bar?  Slow<br/>
up and wait?  Figure she&#39;ll come in eventually?  Somebody do something fast!<br/>
<br/>
Therefore you need a conductor!<br/>

FYI: noodle: (new-dull) technical, music.  (1.) noun: the repetitive<br/>
patterns of notes that the violins play during pretty parts of orchestral<br/>
pieces.  usually boring.  (2.) verb: the playing an organist does waiting<br/>
for something to happen during the church service or before a wedding, as<br/>
in, to noodle around.</div>
