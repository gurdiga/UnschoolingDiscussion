<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008229332">Hi!<br/>
I am new to the whole unschooling thing so I joined<br/>
this list a few weeks ago and have been lurking. I<br/>
live in SC and have 3 children. I am still trying to<br/>
figure out how unschooling works in practice. I<br/>
understand the theory! I have been enjoying the posts<br/>
immensely.<br/>
<br/>
 I had to laugh about the personality  posts because I<br/>
am Type B.  Definitely not A. I love to sit on my<br/>
porch and hang out.  We do a lot of school on our<br/>
porch! Lots of folks in the Low Country of SC love<br/>
their porches!<br/>
<br/>
I went to the coolest herpetology presentation not<br/>
long ago by a woman who works for an ecology lab.  I<br/>
talked with her afterward, and she said she wasn&#39;t<br/>
into rigid definitions about what unschooling was or <br/>
wasn&#39;t, and  thought it somewhat depended on the<br/>
person&#39;s reference point.  Other unschoolers might not<br/>
call her an unschooler but she definitely leaned that<br/>
way.  She said she had to make compromises because her<br/>
husband was more traditional about school.  He was<br/>
ex-military.<br/>
<br/>
Her co-workers definitely saw her as an unschooler.<br/>
She said if her kids weren&#39;t so bright that someone<br/>
would probably already have turned her in to DSS for<br/>
academic neglect.  She grew  up in Boston and knew<br/>
John Holt when he was a teacher.  She said she always<br/>
knew she wanted to homeschool her kids according to<br/>
John&#39;s philosophy. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, all that to say that it was the first time I<br/>
had ever met someone who was Type A and was into<br/>
unschooling. I asked if a Type A unschooler was an<br/>
oxymoron and she said, &quot;Nah. I just take all my energy<br/>
and put it into laying out opportunities and resources<br/>
for my kids to choose from and doing stuff I want to<br/>
learn.&quot; She said that she is probably ADHD, but has<br/>
learned how to harness the excess energy into other<br/>
avenues.<br/>
<br/>
She did mention that her children didn&#39;t have the same<br/>
personality that she did.  She would love for them to<br/>
embrace unschooling more, but they are not all that<br/>
spontaneous like she is and they didn&#39;t have to be<br/>
constantly on the go quite as much.  She said they are<br/>
more reluctant to go and search out what they want to<br/>
learn and stick with it.  Sometimes they want her to<br/>
do too much of the work, but she is gently nudging<br/>
them to do more on their own. <br/>
<br/>
She said they take after her husband that way and it<br/>
is sometimes frustrating to her.  She told me not to<br/>
sweat the small stuff and to do homeschooling<br/>
whichever way suited me and my kids. <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was interesting when she said sometimes<br/>
we want to teach our kids they way we want to be<br/>
taught rather than how they want to be taught.  So she<br/>
thought many styles of homeschooling could be<br/>
considered unschooling IF the child chooses that.  She<br/>
thought  unschooling was all about choices, learning<br/>
all the time, and learning outside the box.  She<br/>
wished that someone had unschooled her, but she is an<br/>
unschooler now.  She said she is always learning new<br/>
skills and hopes that role modeling rubs off on her<br/>
kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it is cool that I had never heard of<br/>
unschooling before and then I saw an article about it,<br/>
found this list, and met the ecology woman all in the<br/>
space of a few weeks.  I   find it all very exciting!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dee is a really interesting woman. We&#39;ve never met IRL, but we&#39;re virtual <br/>
friends and have spoken on the phone a couple of times. She and a friend will be <br/>
presenting a funshop or two at the conference. I think she&#39;s bringing a baby <br/>
alligator and other critters! &lt;G&gt; Look for the funshop description soon.<br/>
<br/>
Her kids help her at work A LOT. She works at the SC ecology lab. (She <br/>
reminds me of Deb L a lot---love of nature, hands-on, and funny! &lt;G&gt;)  She&#39;s told me <br/>
several stories of what they&#39;ve done: my favorite is that her kids have <br/>
hand-fed snakes dead, blendered frogs! <br/>
<br/>
She also has wonderful stories about John Holt (so neat to know someone who <br/>
actually KNEW John Holt, our patron saint! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I saw an article about it, found this list, and met the ecology woman&quot;...and <br/>
will be at the the unschooling conference in Columbia and a new member of <br/>
SOS???...&quot;all in the space of a few weeks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to meeting you soon, Rachel!<br/>

Sounds pretty familiar to the inside of me!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m lucky that my kids are all really active and curious and easily amused.<br/>
They don&#39;t like books the way I did when I was a kid, but I see clearly lots <br/>
of reasons why, and after my initial disappointment (which lasted years &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
now I&#39;m coming to get over it, and to consider selling lot of my books to make <br/>
more room for their games.    <br/>
<br/>
All my hundreds of non-fiction books which have served me well all my life, <br/>
and whose contents I know so well that I can find information for people in <br/>
fifteen minutes are totally obsolete now, and are a drop in the ocean of <br/>
information available on either of two computers in this house which take no more <br/>
space than two dozen books and are updated regularly (unlike my books!).<br/>

<br/>
It would be just cruel to use LIVE blendered frogs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of hand-feeding mice blendered snakes.   You could feed a lot of <br/>
mice on one of those big rodent-eating snakes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781221348">Sandra, I can really relate to the book problem...with my last pregnancy <br/>
I nested for about 6 months and decided I needed to get rid of some of <br/>
my books.  I found a retirement home and donated over 1000 books.  It <br/>
felt so great...and sad...it&#39;s like parting with old friends.  I would <br/>
have rather donated them to a nursing home, but all the local ones would <br/>
only accept large print.  I also donated about 200 children&#39;s books to <br/>
the Catholic school across the street.  I&#39;ll NEVER do that again.  They <br/>
didn&#39;t even have the courtesy to say thank you.  I still have over 1000 <br/>
books.  One of these days, I really should go through them again.  <br/>

the books as if I were at a travel agency just trying to decide where to <br/>
go next...<br/>
