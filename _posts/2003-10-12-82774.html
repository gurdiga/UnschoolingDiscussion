<div id="ygrps-yiv-585298555">My opinion on each of your questions from the perspective of living in Mass. <br/>
<br/>
1. From what I know homeschooling in Mass. is pretty easy.  I&#39;ve had it<br/>
a little rougher than other HS families I know of in other towns locally (it goes by the local school<br/>
super how much the want to interpret the law) but I still think dealing with the local<br/>
school has been easy and unstressful, except for being unprepared for my first school year<br/>
and the paperwork they sent me which I thought looked very intimidating.  That&#39;s what it<br/>
was though just intimidating not tough at all.  There are enough unschoolers here that you <br/>
don&#39;t have to feel isolated but you *have* own a second car unless you live in the city <br/>
which is even more expensive than living in the suburbs and having a second car probably.<br/>
Since living here in the eastern part of Mass. is so expensive though having a second car <br/>
isn&#39;t easy on one income, unless dh is college educated and gets a high paying job <br/>
close to Boston where he has to sit in bumper to bumper traffic for miles and miles every <br/>
work day.  The self employed homeschool families I know of do seem to do ok but buying a <br/>
house would be a problem for a new homeschooler moving into the area imo.  Most homeschoolers <br/>
I know here own their homes and bought them before the house prices started skyrocketing.   <br/>
<br/>
2. You can be relaxed here and no one really bothers you if you homeschool but imo there<br/>
is the feeling among nonhomeschoolers and neighbors that both parents should work, not <br/>
homeschool, so you can afford the SUV,BIG house and after school activities.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t feel like it was this way the more West you go in Mass. but I&#39;ve never lived<br/>
in another part of Mass. <br/>
<br/>
Dh and I were seriously thinking of moving to Brattleboro, Vermont.  For all the reasons<br/>
you&#39;re looking for.  My RI dad called Brattleboro Battleboro.  It&#39;s full of homeschoolers,<br/>
hippies, co-ops, 7 used bookstores, indie films, nudist campground ect.  It&#39;s like no other <br/>
town I&#39;ve ever been too here in the states.  It actually reminds me of the UK in that people<br/>
dress, act, and do what they feel.  Tattoos and multiple piercings are not required but a <br/>
lot of people there in Brattleboro did seem to have them.  ;o)  A christian homeschooler <br/>
I know in NH won&#39;t go to Brattleboro.   <br/>
<br/>
NH seems to have a lot of christian homeschool groups.  All the homeschoolers<br/>
I knew from Mass. who moved to NH either stopped homeschooling or joined<br/>
christian homeschool groups because they couldn&#39;t find any others.  The groups do seem <br/>
to have alot of activities, and the former Mass. homeschoolers seem happy they moved<br/>
to the country with the slower life and much cheaper housing.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
3. The town center of Brattleboro is full of artists.  Dh and I would love to move there <br/>
but people do seem to need to be self employed and I&#39;m not sure they need another used<br/>
bookstore.  &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t remember a British grocery store.  The town always<br/>
had many tourists when we visited a few times last year so I think such a shop could do ok.<br/>

<br/>
I have a question for everyone in the northeast and canada.  Me and <br/>
dh have decided that we want to relocate.  Huge decsion for us!  <br/>
Right now we are in the preliminary stages of getting the business <br/>
ready to sell, figuring out how his parents will survive or if they <br/>
should come with us and of course where our business would do well.  <br/>
We are considering the northeast (narrowed down to VA, MD, DE, CT, <br/>
ME, MA, PA, NH, VT and even considering PEI in Canada.  <br/>
<br/>
1: How are these states for homeschooling, obviously unschooling in <br/>
terms of being relaxed?<br/>
2. We really want to live a more relaxed, laid back lifestyle.  Any <br/>
recommendations on cities that have an appreciation for that instead <br/>
of what car you drive? (we live in Boca Raton, FL now pretty much a <br/>
place of excess and we have had our fill)<br/>
3. completely OT: We run a british grocery business and bakery.  We <br/>
would like to continue that and specialize in teas and such.  Anyone <br/>
know any places that are needing of such a thing or would appreciate <br/>
artisan baking and the such.  <br/>
<br/>
Any info would be appreciated since we don&#39;t kow much about the <br/>
specifics of those places.  THANK YOU!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060145696">Not far from the Brattleboro area is the Monadnock Region in NH with my <br/>
biggest recommendation being Peterborough. <br/>
<br/>
Peterborough is very much &quot;Our Town&quot; and has lots of music and arts <br/>
opportunities.  It is close enough for day trips and there is TONS to do <br/>
for day trips in the surrounding area.  It has a lovely downtown area <br/>
with lots of neat specialty shops and unique boutiques.  This is a town <br/>
that has so far resisted most of the trappings of homogenized America -- <br/>
no fast food restaurants, for example.  I would bet your British <br/>
specialities/artisan baking would be well accepted.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the comment that most homeschooling groups in NH are <br/>
Christian-based, however, there is a secular, all-inclusive <br/>
homeschooling group, Monadnock Homeschoolers, that has been going strong <br/>
over the last few years, even though it&#39;s not formally organized by any <br/>
stretch of the imagination.  I&#39;m not sure how unschooling would fit <br/>
specifically with the requirements of the state which are fairly loose <br/>
and there are portfolio review teachers out there who are <br/>
unschooling-friendly.  I will put in this disclaimer:  I haven&#39;t looked <br/>
into it too hard as my sons aren&#39;t old enough to require registration <br/>
and we&#39;re moving to CA next Spring to be closer to family, I&#39;d be happy <br/>
to send you my booklet on homeschooling requirements in the state, if <br/>
you&#39;d like to look it over though.<br/>
<br/>
Prices for housing in the area are going up, but a lovely home on a good <br/>
piece of land can be had in the area for under $300K with prices <br/>
generally starting around $150K.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How exciting to be able to pick up and do this!  If in your place, I&#39;d <br/>
probably choose to be up in the New Brunswick/Nova Scotia area -- there <br/>
are some lovely pieces of property right on the water for inexpensive <br/>
prices even in Canadian dollars to be had.<br/>

in Western Mass. in &quot;the happy valley&quot; as it is sometimes called.  Western <br/>
Mass. was a great place to live.   My stepfather is living there now and <br/>
moved there from Cambridge to get away from the things you seem to want to <br/>
leave.  There are a lot of small and larger, village-y like towns and five <br/>
major colleges (Amherst, Smith, Hampshire, UMass and My. Holyoke).  I lived <br/>
in both Northampton and in Amherst and there is a large college pop. but <br/>
the locals have a firm standing.  Unless it&#39;s changed a lot, you don&#39;t feel <br/>
overrun by the college pop.   I gave my step-father a book named _Home <br/>
Town_ by Tracy Kidder, that is about Northampton.   Reading it convinced my <br/>
step-father&#39;s wife (my mother is no longer alive) to check out the area.  I <br/>
have read it and don&#39;t know exactly what did this, but it is a good <br/>
book.  There are a lot of possibilities in that area and it is beautiful; <br/>
mountains, valleys,  great swimming watering holes in hidden bits of the <br/>
forests, a huge variety of culture and of people...  I would love to move <br/>
back there.  I don&#39;t know about the local hschooling laws there though.<br/>

feel free to give more!!!!!!!!)  I have written down all the <br/>
suggested areas and that should really help get us started.<br/>
<br/>
It is very exciting to finally be able to do this.  I don&#39;t know how <br/>
long it will take to actually make the move.  I really do want to <br/>
find something more peaceful!  If anyone things of any other areas, <br/>
please let me know.  You have all been wonderful!!<br/>
