<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720246525">Well...the wonderful weekend is over, wah! :)<br/>
On the other hand, I am exhausted and glad to be home. It was SO cool to hear Sandra speak (man is she funny!) instead of seeing her laying in a hospital bed loopy on morphine (although she was funny then too).<br/>
<br/>
Jalen chasing was my main activity at the conference, but I got to meet Shannon and Heidi and Pam S and HECK, just about everyone! Except YOU MaryB, whom I did expect to see and was disappointed. Ya missed a great event!<br/>
I have to tell you all, Mary&#39;s T-shirts were COOL (she sent some to the conference), I especially liked that &quot;Warning: radical unschooler&quot; T.<br/>
So you all should check out her site if you want some cool unschooling T-shirts.<br/>
<br/>
Some highlights were:  Seeing Sandra and one of the Dad&#39;s peeling roasted green chili&#39;s in Kelly&#39;s kitchen last night. The whole house smelled like chilis from New Mexico....aaah.<br/>
My SHY dd getting up on stage with Joanna Wilkinson&#39;s dh and dd to sing &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot; to close the talent show.<br/>
Hearing Marji sing in her angelic voice as everyone teared up while listening.<br/>
Sitting up late in the hallway singing along with Sandra, Bob Wilkinson, Elissa, Stepheny and some other night owls. <br/>
<br/>
There were so many great moments....and great people! It&#39;s amazing to be surrounded by likeminded folks, truly amazing.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of you make it to the New England conference next year...and don&#39;t forget I&#39;m hosting the 2005 BEACH PARTY, right here in P&#39;cola!:) <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to be back, all filled up with happy unschoolish memories. Thank  you Kelly Lovejoy, you are a GODDESS!!<br/>

Just couldn&#39;t swing it this year. Glad you liked the shirts. Sounds like it<br/>
was an awesome time. And your party is in 2005? What month are you planning<br/>
on? I hate the beach but my kids and hubby love it so I&#39;m outnumbered. Can&#39;t<br/>
see why we couldn&#39;t make it in my own state!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789105331">As a newbie, I felt the conference was just wonderful.  Thanks to all the people that made me feel so welcome.  The energy floating from the group of people was overwhelming! <br/>
<br/>
 My children thoroughly enjoyed it and Alyssa my quietest talked all the way home!  Just from listening and observing, Frankie, 9 learned to speak in even tones, well most of the time&lt;G&gt;.. and how to tell people that he needs something, or doesn&#39;t need something. <br/>
<br/>
 We already had a tangle with mom over what she thinks I should do with my unruly children... No surprise, just kind of felt like she was feeling kind of upset over &quot;no discipline&quot;... I offered to let her read Valerie&#39;s book after I was done.  It is an enjoyable thought provoking book...  <br/>
<br/>
I loved all the speakers, the emotions that I went through this weekend were some that I had thought were long gone... the what it&#39;s like to wonder, and the what if&#39;s are back...Sandra was worried about Marty spending so much time with my girls, and I thought the same about the girls being with him and Trevor, glad they were having a great time.  I am proud of them and felt good that I could trust them and their judgement.  <br/>
<br/>
To the ladies in 518, I thoroughly enjoyed the cheese and crackers, conversation, and thank you.  <br/>
<br/>
The talent show was great, I have to say the Yo-yo&#39;s were delightful, but it was all great!  I want to take belly dancing lessons LOL..  <br/>
<br/>
Ren&#39;s energy was great to see, I loved watching her look for water at the pool... she found it&lt;S&gt;The kids all want to raise money somehow to come to pensacola for the funfest... don&#39;t know if we can do it yet.<br/>
<br/>
 Crystal and Nicole were great roomies... Elissa was my buddy out at the pool, as we both watched her son jump and jump....<br/>
<br/>
Kelly is not a slavedriver.. and you worked so hard. Thank you Kelly, you were wonderful and thank Ben again for helping me find my way around Columbia... I did not move the car again until I left, and I went the wrong way when I pulled out from the hotel... just me I guess, good thing I 95 is pretty straight&lt;BG&gt;  The kids all want to raise money somehow to come to pensacola for the funfest... don&#39;t know if we can do it yet.  Hope to see you all again next year...<br/>
 <br/>
Marji, please send the tabs for the guitar, maybe I&#39;ll be fingerpickin by next year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456001498">Well, I think we are &quot;recovered&quot;.. nah, maybe &quot;recuperated&quot;.. no, <br/>
both of those sound like we suffered an illness or accident..lol, <br/>
HEY, I know, we are &quot;rested up&quot; from the Conference.  :-)    We <br/>
probably had one of the shortest drives, aside from SC residents, so <br/>
I really feel for folks that had cross country trips.  But, still, <br/>
the kids were keyed up and all the new and fun stuff and just the <br/>
high energy environment.   It took a day or so to settle down and <br/>
come back to &quot;real life&quot;.   But, one of the great things is, a lot of <br/>
what we experienced at the conference IS our real lives.  We just <br/>
don&#39;t have 300 other folks to share it with.. at once!  <br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed meeting folks and putting names with faces.  Most <br/>
folks were pretty much just how I pictured them... some, I didnt <br/>
really have a solid image in my mind, so it was really neat seeing <br/>
them and now having a visual to go with thier posts. Oh, I changed my <br/>
email to be ME instead of my husbands name.. lol.  So now folks don&#39;t <br/>
have to wonder what &quot;grlynbl&quot; means..  Now, I am just TeresaBnNC.. <br/>
pretty cut and dry, no more guessing.. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
 Actually, I didn&#39;t get to &quot;connect&quot; with as many folks as I had <br/>
hoped.  My kids demanded a lot of my attention and they wanted to me <br/>
to be with them.  JP was fine zipping about on his own and playing <br/>
with Pam G&#39;s boys.   Anna began to feel more comfortable on Saturday <br/>
and she made one good friend whom we plan on seeing as often as <br/>
possible. She and I enjoyed making jewelry and pounding flowers. I <br/>
was so engrossed in those activities that I missed a couple of talks <br/>
that I really wanted to hear!.. But, thats OK, we were having a lot <br/>
of fun with folks doing the funshops.    JP and Ethan loved making <br/>
chain mail. Ethan wondered around, watching Yu-Gi-Oh duels and <br/>
playing PS2.  The good thing about Ethan&#39;s experience at the <br/>
conference was that he did not NOT like it. Ususually he does not <br/>
like crowds and &quot;busy &#39;ness&quot;  But he was fine and he tolerated it <br/>
pretty well. I could tell that he was more relaxed and didn&#39;t have <br/>
his gaurd up as much as he usually does around other children.   They <br/>
were all disappointed that we didn&#39;t do anything for the talent show. <br/>
We had bounced a few ideas around and talked about some different <br/>
things, but we never made any concrete plans.  Now they have decided <br/>
that next year we will definitely do our &quot;thing&quot; at the conference.   <br/>
I think that next year, they will have even more fun and be even more <br/>
comfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to also add my thanks and &quot;applause&quot; to Kelly and Ben.  They <br/>
were both lovely and gracious hosts at the conference and made us <br/>
feel very welcomed and at home in Columbia. <br/>
<br/>
Well, the kids are ready for breakfast!  It was nice meeting some of <br/>
you guys in person.  I bet I actually met more folks on this list <br/>
than I am aware of.. lol.. I didn&#39;t realize who Bob and Joanna were <br/>
til this morning when I read some posts.  And Stepheny, I met her at <br/>
the pool.. and now I know who she is online.   ..ACKKK,  I gotta go, <br/>
the natives are restless.. WANT FOOD!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553562863">Heidi, I just wanted you to know how many folks loved your &quot;get out <br/>
of hell free&quot; tag, the fairy and the gold necklace. Mary&#39;s T shirts <br/>
were great too. Pam&#39;s frog bag and quilts were fought over. I helped <br/>
Kelli with the raffle and all the homemade items were much <br/>
appreciated and admired. The Sam wilkerson scholarship fund helped <br/>
many people come according to Kelli. It would be great to move the <br/>
conference around. Kelli and Ben have really busted butt to do it <br/>
right. I got involved so to learn how to do a conference and to meet <br/>
people because normally I sit in the corner. I&#39;m kind of anti social <br/>
unless I&#39;m actually doing something that forces me to interact. <br/>
<br/>
It would be great to establish a movable unschooling conference. <br/>
Kelli and Ben have started a wonderful event and she is such a great <br/>
person to work with. If this ever happened, I would jump at the <br/>
chance to help again. Unschoolers everywhere should have this caliber <br/>
of an event. Someone here (or at the conference) said....&quot;build it <br/>
and they will come&quot;. And we did. The guidelines and knowledge are out <br/>
there....so now, how do we move it around and keep it growing as well <br/>
as Kelli and co. have started it out? I understand that we&#39;ll be in <br/>
Peabody Mass with Kathyrn Baptista next year. I&#39;m so in hopes I&#39;ll <br/>
get to go and help again. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726763652">We got back from the conference last night.  It was such an <br/>
incredible experience.  Anyone who couldn&#39;t make it this year should <br/>
find a way to get there next year.  Beg, borrow or steal.  It is too <br/>
wonderful to miss.  <br/>
<br/>
We had 10 people (3 adults, 4 teens, and 3 big kids) sleeping in our <br/>
room plus all the teenagers that were just hanging out and not once <br/>
did we fight over the bathroom.  We just all lived together so <br/>
nicely.  I feel like I&#39;m writing a Hallmark Card, but it&#39;s the <br/>
truth.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids made such good friends.  I loved seeing so many unschooled <br/>
kids from so many different walks of life and of all ages getting <br/>
along so well together.  It made me proud to say I&#39;m an unschooler <br/>
after I saw the way these kids behaved.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a great time hanging out at the pool, and later, in room 518, <br/>
drinking a little wine and just talking about anything and everything.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all who spoke for sharing your lives with us.  I came back <br/>
with so many useful tools to help make my children&#39;s lives a little <br/>
easier and a lot more fun.  <br/>
