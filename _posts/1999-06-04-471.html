<div id="ygrps-yiv-140630704">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really been enjoying the wonderful posts to this new list and I<br/>
thought it was time I added my intro.  As this turned out longer than I expected,<br/>
I&#39;ll phrase my request first: does anybody have copies they can forward to me of<br/>
the digests from the list, numbers 1- 28 inclusive?<br/>
<br/>
I am Mandy Tyler, my children are Aedan (6) and Keszia (5); I&#39;m in<br/>
West Auckland, New Zealand.  My partner is Lance; his daughter Meagan is 8.5 and also<br/>
homeschooled.  (I may as well admit it now, her mother and I get on<br/>
really well!  Some people find that really strange.  Oh yes, and my<br/>
ex-husband and I actually get on as well.  Weird, huh?).  All 3 children<br/>
are using the Oak Meadow curriculum as a jumping-off point - it is very Rudolf<br/>
Steiner-ish in philosophy and we&#39;re really enjoying it.  Covering the<br/>
basics but lots of fun involved as well.  We do a couple of hours of<br/>
this 3 mornings a week, and the other two mornings go to a playgroup<br/>
(not a homeschool one, but really enjoyable).  The rest of the time the<br/>
kids unschool..  The kids also go to swimming lessons on Saturday mornings<br/>
with their dad, and spend time with him every weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We tried unschooling in 1997 without any curriculum while the kids<br/>
were younger, and really enjoyed it.  The only reason we bought a<br/>
curriculum at all last year was basically my own insecurity.  We well<br/>
and truly proved that lots gets done in each subject using<br/>
unschooling...do I explain the signature line at the end of my message?<br/>
I kept daily records of everything the kids did for all of last year,<br/>
and much to my surprise Eleanor of the Home Educators list in Australia<br/>
offered to publish it for me.  It is basically a report about what we<br/>
achieved in each subject last year, using the relaxed unschooling<br/>
method.  The kids were 4 and 3 at the time. There are about 4000<br/>
educational references to things we did, under the appropriate subject<br/>
headings.  It would be particularly useful to (a) people starting out<br/>
homeschooling; (b) people who don&#39;t understand how unschooling can work,<br/>
(c) parents with preschoolers interested in homeschooling them and (d)<br/>
people looking for a method of record-keeping. It includes about 50<br/>
photos/copies of the children&#39;s work.  It can be purchased directly<br/>
through me for US$20 including p&p.  I hope that didn&#39;t seem like a shameless plug!<br/>
<br/>
I also have an enormous list of bookmarked sites divided into subject<br/>
areas, - hotlink for this in my sig line - and I run the New Zealand Unschoolers list, on<br/>
which there are about 40 members.<br/>
<br/>
I am a serious addict of the overseas homeschooling email lists, as well as<br/>
Unschooling-dotcom 8-) - the US ones: Home-ed list, Unschooling List, Unschoolers Circle,<br/>
younglearners; and also of course there is my own list and the other (main) NZ<br/>
homeschooling<br/>
list, Hefnet.  Among others.  Oh dear - how shall I find time to read it all!! 8-)<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is long enough for a first post - I shall enjoy getting to<br/>
know everybody more as the list progresses!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Mandy Tyler<br/>
