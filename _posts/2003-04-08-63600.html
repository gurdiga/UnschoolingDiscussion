&lt;&lt; I can see that I have a lot to learn before I can even begin to school <br/>
them properly &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The whole point is to not school, NEVER, EVER. Get school and &quot;work&quot; out of <br/>
your life.<br/>
Making them do things to appease you is only going to lead to anger and <br/>
resentment, no true learning.<br/>
If your dd likes tv and not the work you give her, then DROP the work and <br/>
watch tv with her!!!<br/>
Unschooling is not a method of getting certain information into your <br/>
children. <br/>
It is totally trusting that THEY know what they need for their lives and <br/>
enjoying their interests (and your own) with them WITHOUT making a &quot;plan&quot; or <br/>
&quot;work&quot; or school of it!!<br/>
Breathe deep and let it go....just say NO to school. :)<br/>
Pretend like you&#39;re on vacation with them today Yoki. You are going to find <br/>
fun things to do together and DO them, just because you love each other and <br/>
want to have a joyful day. Then start living EVERY day like this and you&#39;ll <br/>
be unschooling.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

 I like for them to be surrounded by whatever they love. Personalizing their <br/>
 rooms is a (relatively) cheap and artistic way to create a &quot;haven&quot; and to <br/>
let <br/>
 them really get into their interests. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with Kelly!! (and Duncans bat cave IS really cool!)<br/>
A childs room should be exactly what they love, it should calm and soothe and <br/>
surround them with what they love best...their own haven.<br/>
Jared and Jalen have a ship/ocean themed room right now. There is a ship&#39;s <br/>
wheel, wooden pirate, starfish, miniature sailboats etc...all over the walls. <br/>
The whole room is painted with blue and clouds and one wall has an ocean <br/>
mural with a ship sailing past  and &quot;ships and sails and pirates tails&quot; <br/>
curving it&#39;s way above the ship.<br/>
There is a lighthouse shelf and a rowboat shelf.<br/>
And you know what?<br/>
Jared&#39;s tired of it. <br/>
He and Trevor chose it together when they shared the room and now Jared wants <br/>
his TRUE love, dragons and castles.<br/>
So we&#39;ve planned the re-do complete with castle walls surrounding him on <br/>
every side.<br/>
I just have to find the energy to commit myself to this project again..sigh.<br/>
AND find someone to sell the ship themed stuff to.....<br/>

painted the walls like an ocean with lots of fish, turtles, etc.  And the <br/>
ceiling is blue.  The windows have fish netting hanging on them with sea <br/>
shells glued on.  They sleep with us but their room is still how they like <br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482790352">Thanks! That is good advice. And they do seem to take in more when we just have a crazy day and do whatever. At the end of the day they have learned more than when we have sat down to a day of lessons. And today we were by a friend&#39;s house so they were completely exposed to a different lifestyle.
