<div id="ygrps-yiv-69061121">Hey Julie... Sweet cloud rice syrup looks something like honey.  The <br/>
&quot;Hypoglycemia/Diabetes Cope Book&quot; has a lot of recipes in it that call for <br/>
this sweetener, so I just got some a few days ago, and just tried it <br/>
yesterday in oatmeal cookies.  Even though they were not as sweet as cane <br/>
sugar, to me , they taste very good.  After giving up refined sugars for the <br/>
last 6 wks, this tasted sweet to me, so it&#39;s a matter of &quot;taste&quot; so to speak  <br/>
:)  !  Another alternative is called &quot;Sweet Balance&quot;.  I stumbled across this <br/>
while researching out some hypo-g recipes.  It is an all-natural sweetener <br/>
made from fruit.  It is not a chemical, and is safe for anyone, including <br/>
pregnant women.  In the article, it explains that it tastes like sugar, has <br/>
no aftertaste, or chemical taste.  It is not high glycemic, and will not <br/>
affect blood sugar levels adversely.  So, I talked with a person  there, and <br/>
decided to order some, and it should be here any day now.  I am really <br/>
excited about this, as it sounds just like what I&#39;ve been looking for!  It <br/>

Hey, thanks for the information.  I am going to the health food store today <br/>
when dd wakes from a nap.  I will look for this.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this book good?  Where did you find it? <br/>
I have noticed that I am feeling better since I cut out tons of refined <br/>
sugars, &quot;white&quot; stuff and started vitiam B-complex.  This started out as a <br/>
temporary thing but I think I will make it more permemant.  It is worth the <br/>
feelings of more energy.  I had a little sugar on my oatmeal this morning and <br/>
I have been feeling really sluggish today.<br/>
I would love to hear more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799627326">To anyone following this thread:<br/>
I understand that cutting out refiend sugar is a good thing, esp. for those<br/>
of us with blood sugar level problems. My question is, If you  replace them<br/>
with alternative sweetners aren&#39;t there potential effects of these? Of<br/>
course, I realize the ideal thing is not to even use these, but I&#39;m not sure<br/>
I can give up soda (tisk, tisk on me). Anyway I&#39;d appreciate info on this.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amy<br/>
