&lt;&lt;  As for junk food, I have stopped limiting the junk food, but our budget <br/>
dictates that we buy the healthy stuff first because we can&#39;t really afford <br/>
to stock equal amounts of both junk and healthy stuff. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never known anyone who owned as much &quot;junk&quot; food as healthy food, EXCEPT <br/>
kids just out of their parents&#39; homes who had it limited!<br/>
<br/>
It seems that people who first hear of the idea of letting kids choose have <br/>
freakish ideas about houses FULL of candy, without any &quot;real food,&quot; and kids <br/>
watching porn and snuff films on one screen while playing from their <br/>
assortment of every video game ever manufactured on earth.  <br/>

  Well, that certainly wasn&#39;t what I personally envisioned when I decided to stop limiting, but I&#39;ll grant that some people do probably think that.<br/>
<br/>
  We never had many limits to start with, so it wasn&#39;t really a big deal.<br/>
