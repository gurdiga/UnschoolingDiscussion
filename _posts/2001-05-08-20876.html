Aren&#39;t you in Louisiana like I am? The law says that even in public schools <br/>
the children only are required to go from age7 to age17. I wonder why they <br/>
made you register so early. If that is the case, I will have to register <br/>
early too. Thanks for the warning.<br/>

&gt;I registered as a private school because we received a warning of<br/>
&gt;truancy note from the school board. Laurie was FIVE years old! I was<br/>
&gt;appalled. I have no idea how they got our name.<br/>

&gt; &gt; In Louisiana, we did end up registering as a private school after<br/>
&gt;just not<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing anything for awhile (then my father turned me in to the<br/>
&gt;school board).<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since moving here to PA. I have done nothing so far, which is my<br/>
&gt;inclination<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway, wherever I am. If I am pushed here, I will probably<br/>
&gt;register with one<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the independent schools that deals with the school board for you.<br/>

<br/>
I was in Louisiana at the time...and was taken by surprise on the <br/>
registration. I was told by others there that it wasn&#39;t necessary <br/>
until age seven. No clue why I was singled out. It&#39;s no big deal if <br/>
you don&#39;t register until they tell you. I&#39;d wait if I were you...just <br/>
my opinion. You are aware that you can register as a private school <br/>
and not have to tell the schoolboard anything you are doing? All we <br/>
did was make up a school name and send in a single sheet of paper (we <br/>
made a letterhead on the computer) with the following:<br/>
<br/>
name of school<br/>
address of school<br/>
principal&#39;s name (me)<br/>
teacher&#39;s name (me)<br/>
number of students...one<br/>
<br/>
that was IT! Once a year I sent that in and said that we were a <br/>
private school. No questions about curriculum, who the child was, or <br/>
anything else were ever asked. It&#39;s MUCH easier than sending them <br/>
examples of the child&#39;s work each year. They don&#39;t have time to read <br/>
it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Where in Louisiana are you? I was in Lake Charles/Sulphur.<br/>

<br/>
That is so wonderful that there are unschooling groups now. I would <br/>
have loved knowing there was another family 20 years ago. Just to <br/>
know you weren&#39;t alone. The only homeschoolers I could find were <br/>
homeschooling for religious reasons. I was still the black sheep even <br/>
with homeschoolers. &quot;our&quot; school was Holt-Neill High. Laurie decided <br/>
on that name. :-)<br/>

Have a great time when you go home. :-)  I moved 2600 miles north to <br/>
Canada and to be honest, I only miss Laurie. But she&#39;ll be here <br/>
Monday night!  I did fake the bayou smell by cleaning the &#39;seaweed&#39; <br/>
out of the pond here. I used it as mulch on the organic garden. Made <br/>
me think of a crawfish boil. <br/>
