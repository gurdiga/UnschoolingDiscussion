<br/>
I am new to the idea of unschooling and I am still trying to figure out what to do and when.<br/>
<br/>
DO you do any planning and if you do how do you do it?? Do you do any recording and again how do you do it?? Do you make use of the traditional units of learning/subjects??<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your ideas<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i&#39;m probably not the best person to answer this since i&#39;m able to sign my<br/>
own kids&#39; annual assessment for the state, but no, no, and no.  I toss<br/>
stuff in a box that they have done....sometimes.  i try to offer up things<br/>
i think they might be interested in (but that usually backfires).  I try<br/>
to keep stuff around that i think will be helpful to them (and sometimes<br/>
it is).  But the more i stay out of their way, the better off we all are<br/>
