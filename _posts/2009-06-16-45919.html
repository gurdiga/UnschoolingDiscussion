<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110935053">My 10 year old daughter has been taking a free puppet class at our local library.  Today was the performance.  They had met two Mondays from 1:30 to 3:00.  I thought I had read that the performance was at 3:00 today.  Instead, it was at 2:30 (only a 15 minute performance).  I had been sitting in the library with my 7 year old son waiting for the performance.  I saw a bunch of people exiting the room where the kids had been practicing and I had a bad bad feeling that I missed the performance (and I did).  <br/>
<br/>
I rushed into the room and my daughter was standing at the front crying because I had missed it.  Someone I know made a comment to me in a rude voice as I was rushing in which didn&#39;t help the situation.  Evidentally, she was the only child without someone there to watch it.  I feel so incredibly horrible.  I took her onto my lap and told her how sorry I was and how bad I felt.  I was in tears myself.  I have never missed any thing my children have been involved in. <br/>
<br/>
The saving thing is that one of the librarians videotaped it and will put it on youtube and the fact that because the kids were behind curtains, she didn&#39;t know I wasn&#39;t there until afterwards, so it didn&#39;t affect her performing her lines.   But, that is no comfort to my daughter (or me).  She is a non reader right now and both of us worked hard getting her lines memorized (well, she memorized the lines, I coached her).  She is so disappointed in me, and I&#39;m so angry at myself for not thinking about checking to make sure of the time of the performance.  She&#39;s been sad all evening and tonight as I lay down with her she told me that she is still so sad that I wasn&#39;t there to watch her performance.  I honor that and know she needs that time to be sad and to be disappointed in me.  I&#39;m disappointed in myself. I let her down.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that from now on, I must be more diligent about double checking things and not assuming, but that&#39;s hind sight.  I just want to somehow make things right again.  I know there are no do-overs for this particular event, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from wishing I could go back in time and have a do-over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949207286">We love the do-over concept, both actually deciding to have one and talking <br/>
about if only we could have a do-over. Have you used those words with your <br/>
dd?<br/>
<br/>
I think one more conversation - even offering a do-over - maybe she could <br/>
show you her part?<br/>
<br/>
Or watch the dvd together as your do-over.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I run the box office and concessions sales for our college theater. My <br/>
youngest daughter was in a big dance show - in one piece. This was the <br/>
first and, so far, only time she&#39;d ever been in a show. The show&#39;s <br/>
director and I were in the lobby - I was setting up the concessions for <br/>
intermission. The director TOLD me that Rosie&#39;s piece would be the first <br/>
one after the intermission. I was waiting in the lobby and the director <br/>
went into the theater. About 10 minutes later, I suddenly realized that <br/>
I was hearing the END of the music for Rosie&#39;s dance number. I rushed in <br/>
just in time to see the bows. I&#39;d MISSED it. The director had changed <br/>
her mind and decided not to have an intermission. I was FURIOUS. I <br/>
cried. I yelled at the director in front of a bunch of people. I totally <br/>
lost my temper. I could hardly face my daughter and tell her what had <br/>
happened because I knew how upset she&#39;d be.<br/>
<br/>
Just saying - we got through it.  As hard as we try to do everything we <br/>
possibly can for our kids, there will be frustrations and let-downs and <br/>
disappointments in life. Because these are inevitable, we don&#39;t need to <br/>
manufacture them by imposing &quot;natural consequences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you had to go through it - I know exactly how you feel when you <br/>
let down your little one! Maybe try to make up for it by doing something <br/>
special for her.<br/>
