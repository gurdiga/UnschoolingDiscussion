&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, HUH!   Cheating!<br/>
<br/>
A   young (former) friend of mine once said cleverly (NOT) &quot;I would say &#39;f- - <br/>
- you,&#39; but I&#39;m not going to.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Test questions have always been frustrating, and in the early 70&#39;s there were <br/>
attempts to make tests &quot;relevant,&quot; and so there was a test designed to be <br/>
updated and make more sense.   And then THOSE qustions were sent around because <br/>
it had to do with subway schedules and elevators and stuff.   Most people in <br/>
the   U.S. don&#39;t live anywhere near a subway (and most of those not even near a <br/>
bus), and many in towns with no elevators whatsoever except maybe in the <br/>
two-story hospital, if they have one.    So those questions too were rejected.<br/>
<br/>
In the same season, though, testing itself was being studied and analyzed to <br/>
death, and the way some tests were devised for a while (maybe still, but I <br/>
doubt it), when they started doing computer scoring, was that there were better <br/>
answers and worse answers.   Responses were weighted so that they could get the <br/>
REALLY high scores (see how many best answers a person had).   So if someone <br/>
picked that 2nd answer that seemed almost as good as the first, that could <br/>
show on the scoring too.<br/>
<br/>
But for test scores to be very useful, all involved have to understand <br/>
them--every school counsellor, teacher and parent... and that just wasn&#39;t likely to <br/>
happen.   So standardized tests went through some awkward days and some fancy <br/>
experimental days, and are probably still constantly revised because of <br/>
complaints that some aspect or other wasn&#39;t fair.<br/>
<br/>
But for unschoolers, it doesn&#39;t matter.   We can encourage kids to go with <br/>
more creative answers.   A very badly worded question (trivia or real-life or <br/>
standardized test) can create more mirth and learning than a well-worded one, if <br/>
the mom&#39;s attitude about it is light and happy instead of dark and angry.   <br/>
If learning is the goal, not testing, then we as unschoolers should not invest <br/>
negative energy in or around testing.   It&#39;s just a thing, like a fence or a <br/>
menu, or like an old pair of shoes maybe we should throw away.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example of a much better answer, a story Pam Sorooshian posted some <br/>
time back:<br/>
<br/>
================<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are 72 students in a school and 6 classes. How many students are <br/>
in each class?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie says - &quot;There could be any number from zero to 72 in a class.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The answer is 12.<br/>
<br/>
================================<br/>
<br/>
And my favorite from my kids, when they were little, and a pre-school <br/>
BrainQuest card showed line drawings of a table, lamp, chair and bed and asked which <br/>
one used electricity.    It was a great moment.   The kids looked at me with <br/>
the most wonderful little-kid looks of &quot;What!?&quot; and said all of them could, but <br/>
none of them had to.    Sure enough, there are electric tables (we owned two, <br/>
with outlets mounted in the side, and a light table), and certainly beds in <br/>
hospitals use electricity, and our neighbor had just bought a recliner that <br/>
could lift her up and out of it, and they&#39;d seen recliners that had heat and <br/>
massage features.    They were also familiar with kerosene lamps, oil lamps and <br/>
battery lamps, and the picture-question clearly showed an electrical outlet, I <br/>
think, so batteries wouldn&#39;t have counted.    <br/>
<br/>
So for my kids, that was not a question with a simple &quot;right&quot; answer.   Good <br/>
for them!!!<br/>

the school district and there are umbrellas out there that don&#39;t <br/>
require anything but attendance (that is, email them a list of &#39;school <br/>
days&#39; and you&#39;re done, just so they can say Yes you &#39;attended&#39;).<br/>

#1, those aren&#39;t the only two choices<br/>
#2, most states don&#39;t have the requirements your state has<br/>
#3... see below<br/>

looking <br/>
for and another may not be able to see where any of the questions are <br/>
headed.  Questions are often not without intentions even in real life. <br/>
In real life you would want to avoid putting intentions onto your <br/>
questions.  But that&#39;s the whole point of standardized tests.  Paradox:<br/>
<br/>
question reality.. yeh but question someone&#39;s knowledge.. maybe you&#39;ll <br/>
get all kinds of seemingly &quot;wrong&quot; answers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would be a bother to have to test ds to meet state requirements. <br/>
But <br/>
I agree.  Illogically worded questions would excite mirth as easily as <br/>
anger, and mirth would be a good choice.  The cool thing is, in some <br/>
states at least -I think all of them-, it doesn&#39;t matter if kids pass<br/>
or <br/>
fail.  As long as the tests are completed and sent in, the school aged <br/>
kids are all accounted for.  (I&#39;m not sure about the laws, so nobody <br/>
quote me on that.)  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need to invest ourselves <br/>
in outcomes.  Otherwise, I&#39;ll be writing something like this: &quot;Dear <br/>
Senator/ Congressperson, if you legislate that I teach to the test at <br/>
home, I promise you a failing grade on YOUR test by voting against<br/>
you.&quot;<br/>

headcount or look at the attendance sheets because in real life you <br/>
might not want to assume something based on what it&#39;s handy to do in <br/>
your head with math.  A handier thing to know: how to deal with real<br/>
life.<br/>

questions with very specific goals (intentions) that the questionee <br/>
might not share at all, then or ever.  Therefore the question could be <br/>
interpreted in wildly different ways, even if they&#39;re based on some <br/>
mundane factoid that anyone can look up.  Such questions aren&#39;t meant<br/>
to <br/>
test the farther reaches of the knowledge of the person(s) being<br/>
questioned.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot gets said about questioning.  Richard Prystowski and I did a  <br/>
talk on encouraging kids to ask questions and answering them in ways  <br/>
that draw out more thought sometimes, or straight out sometimes  <br/>
(depends on the question and the situation and mood and all that).   <br/>
In there somewhere he said there is such a thing as a stupid question  <br/>
(or maybe he said bad question)--a question to which you already know  <br/>
the answer.<br/>
<br/>
I agree sometimes, but there are times to ask a question in order to  <br/>
get the other person to think about it.  Things like &quot;What&#39;s the  <br/>
worst thing that will happen if you don&#39;t go to work today?&quot;   Or  <br/>
&quot;Have you considered other options?&quot;   The questioner might have a  <br/>
good idea of the answer, but the purpose of the question is to help  <br/>
the other person think through a decision, not to get information.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they&#39;re hypthetical questions intended to ellicit an  <br/>
emotional response, and if the questioner is in a position to help  <br/>
care for that person&#39;s emotional wellbeing, I see no sin in that.  If  <br/>
a kid is upset about a relationship problem with a friend, I might  <br/>
say &quot;Is there anything you could do to make it better?&quot;  or &quot;Did you  <br/>
do the best you could do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times over the years someone has claimed that this list  <br/>
or some related discussion was not respecting the Socratic method or  <br/>
some such, by which the complainant meant to say that asking random  <br/>
questions and then considering all the diverse answers was &quot;the  <br/>
Socratic method.&quot;   Not so.  With the Socratic method, there&#39;s a  <br/>
Socrates--a teacher--and there are others who are being led to the  <br/>
difficult ideas by questions designed by the teacher.  He knows where  <br/>
he&#39;s headed, but he&#39;s figured out the philosophical principle over  <br/>
years of thought and is hoping to get this person who hasn&#39;t figured  <br/>
it out to go through the thought processes to get there.  If he just  <br/>
states the principle, the other person might not ever really get it.   <br/>
If the other person comes to it through the rearrangement of his own  <br/>
thoughts then he will &quot;discover&quot; it, even though he was fairly much  <br/>
led there by someone who knew what and where &quot;it&quot; was.<br/>
<br/>
With the Socratic method, the questioner knows the answer.  But it&#39;s  <br/>
lame to apply that to something concrete or measurable (which schools  <br/>
sometimes do) and it&#39;s sadistic to do it about practical matters in  <br/>
your own home.  That can be infuriating.  If I lost my keys and Keith  <br/>
knew where they were, he should say &quot;They&#39;re right here,&quot; not ask me  <br/>
a series of questions designed for me to remember where I left them.   <br/>
Asking those kinds of questions if you do NOT know can be helpful  <br/>
(&quot;What jacket were you wearing when you had them last?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any good to condemn all questions of a type  <br/>
without considering the circumstances and purpose and helpfulness of  <br/>
them.<br/>

I&#39;d like to explore *when* it might be reasonable to answer our <br/>
children&#39;s questions with a question (rather than with an answer).  I <br/>
don&#39;t answer with an answer when it&#39;s a simple spelling question, for <br/>
instance.  (Especially a spelling question in the heat of the action in <br/>
World of Warcraft. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Would their be right and wrong ways to use the Socratic method in an <br/>
unschooling setting?<br/>
<br/>
My stab at it would be that the Socratic method is fine as long as it <br/>
isn&#39;t like some kind of intellectual version of the playground game <br/>
&quot;keep away&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose the guidelines that apply here are &quot;keep going only as long as <br/>
it holds their interest&quot; and the &quot;don&#39;t exasperate your children; it <br/>
isn&#39;t edifying (or nice).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a dear friend who has written a book, Teaching Science Skills at <br/>
Home: Without Being a Rocket Scientist, that encourages the use of the <br/>
Socratic method.  I&#39;m trying to think through the question of how well <br/>
the ideas in this book fit with unschooling.  I think they fit pretty <br/>
well, but any learning resource can be misused.  (It&#39;s a very recent <br/>
book, so I&#39;d be surprised if anyone on this list has read it.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-529612454">I&#39;ll answer with a question if I need more information as to where <br/>
one of DS&#39; questions is coming from - those out-of-the-blue type <br/>
things. I always keep in mind the story of the mom of a young boy <br/>
who comes to his mom and asks Where did I come from? She sits him <br/>
down and calmly(despite her fluttering heart at it being &#39;too <br/>
soon&#39;), with picture books and all, explains the whole process of <br/>
reproduction. When she&#39;s done, he is sitting quite silent and almost <br/>
stunned. She asks if he has any questions or comments and he <br/>
says &quot;Wow! Jimmy said he was from Cleveland!&quot; Thus, I make sure I <br/>
know what information is being elicited before I venture too far off <br/>
the path.<br/>
<br/>
Questions with questions is also something I do when there is no one <br/>
answer to something and I can ask a &quot;what do you think?&quot; or &quot;how <br/>
would you do that?&quot; type question. <br/>
<br/>
Things like how to spell and what does 2+9 equal? we just answer <br/>
right out and move on. Sometimes I&#39;ll follow up the answer with a <br/>
question to find out what&#39;s happening in his head to prompt that <br/>
question (unless it is obvious).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=================================<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be the same right or wrong as in any social  <br/>
situation with friends.<br/>
<br/>
I used to run philosophy discussions in an SCA context, and while  <br/>
some might have thought we were brainstorming, it wasn&#39;t that.  A  <br/>
question would be thrown out that would lead people toward  <br/>
philosophical ideals or practicalities, and their answers might be  <br/>
questions, kind of like what happens on this list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But when kids are REALLY little, and a mom shows instead of just  <br/>
spilling the answer, that&#39;s kind of that thing.  You show them  <br/>
something like... 2x3.  If they&#39;re asking how many donuts three  <br/>
people get out of half a dozen you could say &quot;two&quot; but if the donuts  <br/>
are right there, it might be more useful to physically manipulate  <br/>
them into three piles.  But I think really it would be even MORE  <br/>
useful to add some things like &quot;What if one person doesn&#39;t want any?   <br/>
What if I only want one?&quot;  I wouldn&#39;t press the kid to answer (like a  <br/>
test) at all, but just throw it out to show that the question has a  <br/>
simple mathematical answer, but with the addition of human factors  <br/>
it&#39;s a different question.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there&#39;s a calm long moment, and sometimes the donuts are in  <br/>
a bag in the back of the car and it&#39;s raining hard and the kid&#39;s  <br/>
really hungry and the answer should be &quot;TWO&quot; without further  <br/>
artistry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Those discussions can be fun AND logic-skills-building.  When a  <br/>
little kid is asking (as I think they all do) whether an umbrella  <br/>
would help break his fall if he jumped off the roof holding one, or  <br/>
if maybe a towel tied around his neck like a Superman cape MIGHT help  <br/>
him fly,  if he jumps right and thinks lovely thoughts...  the parent  <br/>
could say &quot;Stay off the roof or you&#39;ll get a spanking,&quot; or maybe ask  <br/>
a leading question like...  (depending on the mood of the kid and all  <br/>
possibly considered factors) &quot;How would the towel help?&quot;   or &quot;If  <br/>
people could fly, don&#39;t you think lots of them would be doing it?&quot;   <br/>
At least that way you don&#39;t embarrass him by saying, &quot;Oh sure--we all  <br/>
tried it and it doesn&#39;t work.&quot;  And if he&#39;s interested you could find  <br/>
some stuff about Icarus and some of da Vinci&#39;s designs for possible  <br/>
flight.  (Google makes that stuff a snap now!)<br/>

That&#39;s a great example.  Everyone at my house seems to have been born <br/>
too tame (or too cautious) for roof jumping, but I still remember the <br/>
childhood thrill of the umbrella tugging upwards when a strong wind gust <br/>
hit.<br/>
