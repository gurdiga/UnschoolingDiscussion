<div id="ygrps-yiv-229676660">I&#39;ve posted here a few times but have mostly been an observer during<br/>
this first year of homeschooling DS12.<br/>
<br/>
We know that a portfolio is the way to go for DS.  He has a learning<br/>
disability and has major test anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
How do unschoolers prepare a portfolio?  What should go in, how much<br/>
info should be given, how should it be organized, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I have all of his public school IEP&#39;s along with samples of school<br/>
work from then.  Should these be included as a &quot;starting point&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
DS works at a local TV station one day a week.  He runs the camera<br/>
for a live show and is learning all aspects of production.  He also<br/>
runs the sound system for our childrens church (and will<br/>
soon &quot;graduate&quot; to the youth sound system).  Video and sound are the<br/>
two main areas of interest in DS&#39;s life.  He already is pretty sure<br/>
that he wants to go into sound/video as an adult.  I am making<br/>
arrangements for him to also &quot;work&quot; (observe) at a recording<br/>
studio.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is done only when he needs to read something like<br/>
instructions, internet access/info, etc.  He is certainly not one<br/>
who wants to pick up a book and &quot;read for fun&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He has taught himself how to make a slide show with music on his<br/>
laptop.  Has taught himself quite a bit about digital photography,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have many of his multiplication facts memorized but knows<br/>
how to use a calculator to get information that he might need.<br/>
<br/>
He has a small dog and is completely responsible for it&#39;s daily<br/>
care.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, he spends the day at our large church working where<br/>
needed.  Usually cleaning, organizing, etc.  I am trying to instill<br/>
good work ethics in DS.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is truly ALMOST a perfect fit for this young man.  But<br/>
how in the world do I document what we are learning/living in our<br/>
daily life</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941409457">We don&#39;t want to get into too much talking about how to meet specific  <br/>
state requirements here. I&#39;m collecting state level information about  <br/>
how people handle unschooling in their states, but I don&#39;t have  <br/>
anything from Ohio, so far.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate offlist email from people who unschool in Ohio,  <br/>
though.<br/>
