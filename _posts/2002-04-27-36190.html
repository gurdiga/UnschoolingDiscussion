<div id="ygrps-yiv-523571591">**So perhaps this is another hot button word problem.  When I say he<br/>
goes to &#39;school&#39; over there the quote marks signify that that is what<br/>
we call it, but not necessarily what it is.  I suppose we could<br/>
just call it the Alan Parsons Project instead.<br/>

:::: a tangent ::::<br/>
<br/>
It just struck me that maybe the reason the words &quot;school&quot; and<br/>
&quot;schooled&quot; sound so bad to me is that they sound a lot like &quot;scold&quot;,<br/>
which has very unpleasant connotations.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m getting video and audio clip of a teacher from any Charlie Brown<br/>
video using that WAH-WAH voice to teach/scold a kid.)<br/>
