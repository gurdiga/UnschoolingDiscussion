<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446258681">I have a friend who hangs postcards from ribbons.  Three or four to a ribbon, <br/>
and they&#39;re  hanging like drapes on one side of her living room.   The ribbon <br/>
is fastened with I THINK hot glue (tiny dabs?) or rubber cement, along the <br/>
mid-line of the text side.  They&#39;re hung so they&#39;re usually facing out, but if <br/>
they turn that&#39;s okay.  If you use rubber cement, you should be able to get it <br/>
off later without destroying the card.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925053092">I put brown craft paper up on one out of the way wall in my first &quot;all mine&quot;<br/>
apartment.  I put posters, bumperstickers, written slogans, etc, on it.  I<br/>
also could hook buttons on it.<br/>
<br/>
Worked really well.  And was easy to take down and store.<br/>
<br/>
Foam core could work just as well, I would think.  And if you did a couple<br/>
panels of it, you could also swap them out when the get full.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636669827">HI Danielle,<br/>
Marvelous idea!  Get stick it.  It&#39;s a Sticky compound that let you <br/>
attach posters, children pictures, post card, neat pictures from <br/>
magazine... on walls while leaving no marks.  It&#39;s also reusable.  It <br/>
works better if you warm it up in your hands first.  It is sold at <br/>
stapples and some groceries stores.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752228180">We&#39;ve glued them to masonite boards cut to whatever shape and size we<br/>
like.    That&#39;s permanent though, you can&#39;t get the cards off later.  We<br/>
put that decoupage goo over the top to keep them clean.   You can hang<br/>
the decorated masonite boards like pictures and they&#39;re easy to store if<br/>
you want to take them down.<br/>
<br/>
You lose the information on the backs of the cards, but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter much if they&#39;re obvious landmarks. <br/>
<br/>
You could divide up the postcards, some each, from each trip and make a<br/>
board for every kid.  That way, if they want them later they don&#39;t have<br/>
to decide who gets which memories.   <br/>
<br/>
You can decorate the board the way you would a scrap book page, with<br/>
other photos and memorabilia. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve wondered about drilling holes through the boards and looping several<br/>
boards together on little key ring loops, or something and hanging them<br/>
like a calendar so we could flip through a few different trips if we<br/>
wanted. <br/>

<br/>
That sounds like the simplest idea. Use spray glue to the foam core.<br/>
<br/>
Or use a really big criss-cross ribbon board so the display easily be<br/>
changed. I&#39;ve also seen chicken wire stretched over a frame as a display<br/>
board - postcards tucked in by their corners.<br/>
<br/>
The latest issue of Martha Stewart Living has someone using their souvenirs<br/>
as decorative art by making enlarged color copies of tickets, programs and<br/>
postcards and group framing in poster frames on a coordinating background.<br/>
The enlarged things look very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Also you could try scanning and printing on to iron on transfer paper and<br/>
creating fabric with them - fabric goes on to walls with liquid starch then<br/>
pulls off with no damage to either wall or fabric. Or throw pillows or<br/>
drapes or placemats or........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640327739">Or posterboard?  I would go to my local craft store<br/>
and check out their scrapbooking aisle.  Spray<br/>
adhesive, scissors that cut different designs to make<br/>
&quot;photo mats&quot; around the postcards in different colors,<br/>
and then collage them on different color posterboard. <br/>
That would look cool.  How about covering it all up in<br/>
clear contact paper so they don&#39;t get dirty or<br/>
moist....It sounds like so much fun!  lol <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689009153">You can buy large sheets of that plastic that is used instead of glass for <br/>
picture frames (?) from the large home construction stores like Home <br/>
Depot.  Then you could mount the plastic to the wall and mount the cards to <br/>
the plastic in whatever fashion you wanted, framed or otherwise.  I was <br/>
also thinking about page protectors in a set of inexpensive frames from <br/>
garage sales, or something like that.  Think <br/>
transparent/plastic/protective.  Otherwise you could get rolls of butcher <br/>
paper, or leftover rolls of newsprint from printers and use that as your <br/>
base, but those might not last very long.  Canvas floorcloth with several <br/>
layers of artists gouache to stiffen it would give you a literal canvas to <br/>
attach to your walls and then you could attach the postcards....<br/>
