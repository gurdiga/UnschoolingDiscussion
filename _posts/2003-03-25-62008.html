<div id="ygrps-yiv-54204962">Dear Jana,<br/>
<br/>
My first thought for you is to read the book of John in the bible.  It is the <br/>
whole story about Jesus and what he has to offer and why he came to earth.  <br/>
It sounds like you may have read it before, but now you can read it through <br/>
different eyes so to speak for a different reason, you instead of your <br/>
daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand your thoughts about church.  I just started a bible study called <br/>
BSF (bible study fellowship).  Apparently, it is all over the world.  We have <br/>
been studying the book of John since September and it has been extremely <br/>
meaningful to me personally.   Jesus did not go to church.  I think just <br/>
reading a bit on your own time might really help your daughter and maybe you <br/>
in a new way this time.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
Mary</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s kind of crazy to say &quot;Jesus didn&#39;t go to church.  There was no such <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus did go to the temple.  Maybe not every Sabbath, but there were <br/>
religious observances.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Church&quot; didn&#39;t exist in any form until quite some time after the crucifixion.<br/>
