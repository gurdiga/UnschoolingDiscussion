Ya know, I&#39;ve been thinking so much about this. It&#39;s not that I want a name for dd&#39;s problem  (if I&#39;m accurate in assuming it *is* a problem) or a label. I agree with your assessment of what a label can do to a kid.<br/>
I&#39;m just frozen in my boots thinking, on the one hand... maybe a professional in that field could help my dd.

 </span></blockquote>So, leaving out labels, what do you do when your  kid - at 4, at 8, at 12<br/>
- comes to you and says, &quot;I want to know how to read this book?&quot; And say<br/>
the kid is dead-earnest - he&#39;s not doing this because he wants to please<br/>
me, or because he feels like he&#39;s not &quot;keeping up&quot; with other kids - and<br/>
wants to throw himself into this, but what he&#39;s figured out for himself<br/>
isn&#39;t taking him where he wants to go.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would talk to my kid about the process of reading... I have<br/>
some theories, one is that most people have a preference for either<br/>
learning through phoentics primarily or learning through sight primarily<br/>
(and then most seem to gather skills in the other appraoch through<br/>
reading). I would talk about the differences, about how people who<br/>
process information visually may be more comfortable with sight reading,<br/>
and those who process aurally may prefer phonetics. We would discuss<br/>
where this child seemed to be on this continuum.  Then, if he wanted to<br/>
actually &#39;do&quot; something,  I would gather materials that I thought might<br/>
help, maybe Teach Your Child to Read or Reading Reflex or Explode the<br/>
Code for phonics, probably a collection of picture books and comic books<br/>
for sight words. We could go through the things he thought looked<br/>
interesting at the speed he wanted to do it, we could follow the &quot;rules&quot;<br/>
in  book or not,  we could quit if he wanted to. One of the things Cacie<br/>
wanted when she first started reading was for me to read a book to her -<br/>
longish books, like 50 or 60 page early reader chapter books  - and then<br/>
she would read them to herself. That was her process, that and Archies.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some families go this route, and the kids gain reading<br/>
proficiency and eventually became fluent readers. Would they have become<br/>
fluent readers anyway? I don&#39;t know, but it seemed to make them happy to<br/>
be able to read more than they had the week before, so I don&#39;t think it<br/>
matters. They enjoyed the process. <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I am a licensed professional in the field of learning disabilities,<br/>
acccording to the states of California and Arizona...<br/>

Check out the post I sent with an example of her writing (these are emails sent among family members... dh is a computer geek and we all have computers.. .relics, I might add, but computers just the same). It&#39;s *really* not like we don&#39;t communicate face to face &lt;g&gt; but I encourage dd to write stuff to me to help her along.<br/>

Julie<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad I ask you because I want to diffuse this misunderstanding immediately! I do *not* believe there is a proper age to be reading. My concern with dd is that she *wants* to read but struggles, etc. <br/>
I am *not* forcing her to see a therapist but I question the wise women on this list about the wisdom of doing this or not. I want to know what others think. Personally, I prefer to steer clear of therapists because I didn&#39;t find them to be very helpful for my personal situation a long time ago. <br/>
With regard of pushing to learn basics.... again, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s right to do or *not* do.  I wonder if kids need that basic knowledge of adding & subtracting & reading to be *able* to do all the other glorious things their little hearts lead them to! I don&#39;t KNOW!!! I did teach the basics with one child but not with the other, as stated earlier. The one that is unhappy is the one not taught. <br/>
I believe this list has enough room to be open for discussion of variations on how to get to a comfortable level of unschooling and problems, ideas and support surrounding these issues.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sarah, its possible that your fears and insecurities about whats right is <br/>
the basis of the unhappiness of the &#39;one not taught&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Its a leap of faith. Its not easy.<br/>
<br/>
Trust yourself. Trust yourself. Have patience. Did I mention trust <br/>
yourself?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have the time or inclination, try picking up Legacy of Trust by <br/>
Daniel Greenberg. Its statistical data of 30 years of students and their <br/>
lives after a school that unschooled.<br/>
IF that will help you with your fears. <br/>
<br/>
Nobody said it will be easy. When the leap happens, you&#39;re going to look <br/>
at the fears in a whole new light.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not to mention them not understanding at all what you have been doing (or in <br/>
their mind, not doing) for the last several years. I think it would be <br/>
difficult to explain unschooling to a therapist. <br/>
<br/>
Her notes sound pretty normal to me. . . lots of unschooled kids I know type <br/>
like that or write like that. One thing I was thinking of doing with Lelia <br/>
was a mother/daughter journal, where we write back and forth to each other. <br/>
She is really interested in it. . . and its a way for her to see my writing <br/>
style, words spelled correctly (hopefully most of them anyway), etc. Maybe <br/>
your daughter would be interested in that. And it wouldn&#39;t be like you were <br/>
correcting her, but just sharing thoughts, ideas, or whatever you want to <br/>
with her.  I also was thinking maybe some of Shel Silverstein&#39;s books might <br/>
be cool for her to read, in particular we love &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;. . . no age <br/>
on it, but a cool book to read. And what about, reading books she is <br/>
interested in with her, and her reading a paragraph or however long she wants <br/>
to read, and then you reading some and going back and forth like that. If she <br/>
wants to learn but those Level Books aren&#39;t doing it for her, go on to <br/>
something else. Does she like American Girl books? Lelia just skipped all <br/>
those level books.  But I am thinking finding books like that would be good. <br/>
I don&#39;t guess she has a younger sibling, because I havent heard you mention <br/>
one, but Lelia loves to read to her little brother, and she enjoys the books <br/>
he has. Just throwing out ideas as they pop in my head. . . please dont feel <br/>
you have to respond or anything. . . just trying to be helpful :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But if I gave you my Certified Specialist recommendations they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be true to unschooling... <br/>
<br/>
Cacie wrote like that when she was reading at about the level you<br/>
described your daughter being at. I remember. Now she reads pretty much<br/>
everything fluently and her spelling is more conventional, although not<br/>
at &quot;third grade level&quot; according to the schools. I&#39;ve seen it evolve,<br/>
though. Her latest thing has been noticing that sometimes the  /w/ sound<br/>
is spelled &quot;wh&quot;. She&#39;s overgeneralized the pattern, so she writes<br/>
&quot;which&quot;, but also &quot;whith&quot;, &quot;whish&quot;, and she even threw in a few extra h&#39;s<br/>
in words that started with s. She still asks me to spell words sometimes<br/>
- for a while she would ask me to spell almost every word, I think mostly<br/>
because she didn&#39;t want to go to the effort of sounding them out to spell<br/>
them. That was probably the stage she got to right after the stage where<br/>
she wrote like your daughter. My policy has always been to spell words<br/>
she asks me to spell for her, none of that &quot;What&#39;s the first sound you<br/>
hear?&quot; or anything. I do think that helped, especially for her, because<br/>
she does do so much by sight.<br/>
<br/>
I also didn&#39;t do any &quot;encouraging&quot; Cacie to write to &quot;help her along&quot;, so<br/>
she has gone months without writing a word. Usually, when she starts<br/>
writing again after a dry spell her spelling will be improved from where<br/>
she left off, and she&#39;ll be incorporating some new punctuation marks (her<br/>
latest is putting apostrophe before every s, whether it&#39;s a plural or a<br/>
possessive).  It is hard sometimes to wait... I loved writing when I was<br/>
a kid, I wrote a couple of 100+ page novels when I was a year older than<br/>
she is now. She tells great stories, she always has great ideas for books<br/>
she wants to write, but she&#39;s still frustrated by the mechanics. She<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to dictate anymore... so she sometimes gets 2 or 3 sentences<br/>
down and that&#39;s it, but it&#39;s okay, it&#39;s her pace...<br/>
<br/>
I did write to this very list a few months ago when Cacie was feeling<br/>
self-conscious about her spelling during a drama class. At the time, I<br/>
offered to do something more formal if she wanted, maybe go through the<br/>
Dolch ( list and see which words she knew how to spell, and then pick<br/>
three a week or so and go over them and learn them... you could suggest<br/>
that, Cacie didn&#39;t take me up on it. The nice thing about that list is<br/>
that you can pretty much guanantee she&#39;ll know how to spell some of them<br/>
already, she seems to know &quot;me&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;mom&quot;, &quot;that&quot;... quite a<br/>
few. If you learn the first 50 or so it suddenly seems that you&#39;re<br/>
spelling has vastly improved, because they are so common. Three a week<br/>
sunded manageable... but Cacie didn&#39;t take me up on the offer, and she&#39;s<br/>
feeling better about writing now anyway....<br/>
<br/>
I guess really, I think what you should do next depends on what she does<br/>
next. I guess I think it would be easier to focus on small, doable things<br/>
rather than huge things like &quot;reading better&quot; or &quot;spelling better&quot;.  If<br/>
she comes to you and is unahppy because she can&#39;t spell as well as she<br/>
wants to, maybe you could look at what she&#39;s writing and say something<br/>
like, &quot;Well, did you know that the /ng/ sound at the end of a word is<br/>
always spelled &quot;ing&quot;? That&#39;s one you&#39;ll use a lot, and it doesn&#39;t really<br/>
sound like those letters.&quot; Maybe that would help her to feel like she&#39;s<br/>
getting somewhere, because clearly she is.<br/>

sound like those letters.&quot; Maybe that would help her to feel like she&#39;s<br/>
getting somewhere, because clearly she is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Fantastic! I&#39;m doing something right! I&#39;ve been doing this the last few weeks and some things stick, others don&#39;t yet but that&#39;s ok. <br/>
Dar, I&#39;m not in a race to get her on some &#39;magical&#39; level of her peers. I could give a flip about that. I just want what every parent wants.. a happy child. I&#39;m going to work on building her self-confidence in her more natural areas and see if the pieces don&#39;t start falling into place.<br/>
Now, I said it before.. I&quot;ll say it again. Thanks for the advice. I&#39;m going to stop hogging these boards and let somebody else have a turn!<br/>

I guess I don&#39;t see what you see here.  I don&#39;t see anyone FORCING a<br/>
therapist.  I see someone with an unhappy child who has tried everything<br/>
suggested and nothing has worked.  <br/>

On the other hand, maybe that same professional would rake us over the coals<br/>
for our unschooling lifestyle, consider it harmful to my child<br/>
and............ well it&#39;s at this point that my imagination runs wild :(.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, that;s a great point. It can be scary. Is there a local HS list that<br/>
you could write to and ask for names of anybody in the field? That may be<br/>
helpful because then they would be &quot;on your side&quot;<br/>

&gt;for sight words. We could go through the things he thought looked<br/>

leaving it all up to the child to do alone, that&#39;s ridiculous! It is<br/>
