&lt;&lt; venom towards working mothers disturbs me &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think disgust is a better term... That a woman or her husband would chose <br/>
to put their children somewhere for 70 hours a week (without the reason being <br/>
significant hardship such as death of one spouse) Why bother having them is <br/>
my question?  I believe you can have the best of both worlds if you just <br/>
figure out what you want.  If you really want to be in the working world <br/>
though, and that&#39;s ok, then don&#39;t have kids.  Don&#39;t babies and toddlers <br/>
deserve more than a couple of hours a day with the people who supposedly are <br/>
their parents?<br/>
<br/>
I think what bothers me is that there are so many people who are so cavalier <br/>
about this.  I have a friend (ex actually) who is 8 weeks pregnant and plans <br/>
on putting her child in daycare so she can get back to her life... Maybe that <br/>
will change.  I hope so for her child&#39;s sake.  There are tons of kids born <br/>
out of wedlock to teenagers and women who want to satisfy their own needs of <br/>
having a child and then they put them in daycare.  Again what&#39;s the point.  <br/>
<br/>
We could go around and around with this subject but I think I&#39;ll bow out of <br/>
this one from now on.  I know for a fact (reseaarch published and that I&#39;ve <br/>
done for my thesis) that daycare is harmful to children and unless it&#39;s for <br/>
dire straits that it&#39;s done, it&#39;s unnecessary..  Maybe some reading on what <br/>
happened to children in Bosnia when they were taken from their parents and <br/>
put in group homes and what&#39;s happening to those kids now might be useful... <br/>
The ones that are being adopted in this country have attachment disorders and <br/>
are sociopaths.  When babies don&#39;t have attachment they miss a link in the <br/>
process of development that cannot be replaced or made up later.  We are <br/>
seeing the results of this in our ps and with kids that go around hurting <br/>
other children for no apparent reason.<br/>
<br/>
Just some more fodder for the group.<br/>

have a relevance in this society we live in... Unless of course you don&#39;t <br/>
live in America then I guess it isn&#39;t your concern..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i agree. my brother in law and his wife are the first ones to admit that<br/>
they like their cars, house, vacaions, health club memberships, etc. And<br/>
they are willing to work 40+ hrs a week for it and are not willing to give<br/>
this up to have kids.<br/>
i respect this position more than having kids to see just on the weekends.<br/>
