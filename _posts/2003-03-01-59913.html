<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494227902">When I was growing up, my best friend had a stormy relationship with <br/>
her mother. They had yelling and screaming fights when I was there, a <br/>
lot. My friend would scream things like &quot;I hate you!! I&#39;ll never be <br/>
like you!!&quot; etc.. The mom, one of the wisest people I&#39;ve ever met, <br/>
would sometimes lose it and yell back but as soon as my friend ran <br/>
from the room and slammed the door of her bedroom, her mom would look <br/>
over at me and say &quot;Herman&#39;s heart is in the right place.&quot; (Herman <br/>
was her nickname for my friend) Then she and I would talk about <br/>
whatever for a while. Then the mom would go to the door of her <br/>
daughter&#39;s room and say in a cutsefied voice &quot;I love you Herman!&quot;, my <br/>
friend would sometimes growl at her and sometimes reply, in a similar <br/>
cutsefied voice, &quot;I love you too ma!&quot; and we would all get back to <br/>
drinking coffee and talking about whatever. Sometimes my friend would <br/>
ask me whether I came over to be with her or her mom, I always said <br/>
both. <br/>
     Anyway, this mom was diagnosed with an aggressive kind of skin <br/>
cancer. My friend, without even thinking twice, dropped out of high <br/>
school to take care of her. I cut out a lot to help because Judy, the <br/>
mom was my friend too. We made her dinners and took her to <br/>
appointments and cleaned house for her. We had parties with our <br/>
friends at her house. She was lying on the couch feeling awful and <br/>
she spent her time with a bunch of teenagers!!! We were not exactly <br/>
the quiet, studious crowd (I was but I was an oddball, the rest were <br/>
what wouldve been called &quot;burnouts&quot;).<br/>
     When Judy was dying, she asked to be taken home from the <br/>
hospital, they would not discharge her. My friend walked up to the <br/>
nurses and said, &quot;I am taking my mom home.&quot; They gave her some flak <br/>
about paperwork and my friend said she was not interested in <br/>
paperwork, but her mom&#39;s wishes. She picked her mom up and walked <br/>
down to the car with a nurse following her with papers. She was with <br/>
her mom when she died a few weeks later. Judy called me at work 30 <br/>
minutes before she died and asked me &quot;Take care of Herman for me.&quot;I <br/>
said I would.<br/>
     The thing about Judy which left such an impression on me was <br/>
that she was able to look past her daughter&#39;s acting out and see the <br/>
real person inside. She did not speak to the acting out Herman but to <br/>
the wonderful Herman inside. My friend and I have both tried to do <br/>
this with our own children when they drive us crazy for whatever <br/>
reason. And...yes, in case you were wondering, my friend is an <br/>
unschooling mom and has been for 10 years. Also, many of the <br/>
teenagers who hung out in her mom&#39;s living room listening to heavy <br/>
metal music  while she lay on the couch still know each other. It is <br/>
amazing what one mom&#39;s attitude toward her child can accomplish!! I <br/>
hope this story is encouraging.<br/>

VERY. What an awesome story, thanks.<br/>
I&#39;m especially impressed with Hermans abililty to ignore the establishment <br/>
and honor her mother. That was really neat.<br/>
