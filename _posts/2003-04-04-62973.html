<div id="ygrps-yiv-800218516"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot;24hrmom&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:24hrmom@...">24hrmom@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if you recall, but there is a brief passage in Altas Shrugged<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about a homschooling mother with two young sons - she has chosen raising a<br/>
family as her &quot;career&quot;:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;They did not have the look she had seen in the children of the outer<br/>
 </span></blockquote>world - a look of fear, half-secretive, half-sneering, the look of a child&#39;s<br/>
defense against an adult, the look of a being in the process of discovering<br/>
that he is hearing lies and of learning to feel hatred. The two boys had the<br/>
open, joyous, friendly confidence of kittens who do not expect to get hurt,<br/>
they had an innocently natural, non-boastful sense of their own value and as<br/>
innocent a trust in any stranger&#39;s ability to recognize it, they had the<br/>
eager curiousity that would venture anywhere with the certainty that life<br/>
held nothing unworthy of or closed to discovery, and they looked as if,<br/>
should they encounter malevolence, they would reject it contemptuously, not<br/>
as dangerous, but as stupid, they would not accept it in bruised resignation<br/>
as the law of existence.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Thanks for posting this. I remember seeing Ayn Rand on the Donohue show when<br/>
I was a young teenager and she made a huge impression on me  - not<br/>
necessarily positive or negative, but I remember thinking that she was<br/>
utterly unlike any human that I knew. So I read this book sometime right<br/>
after that, and I also have a vague recollection of this section of the<br/>
book.  I didn&#39;t feel the book was terribly depressing either, I think it<br/>
gave voice to some things I was mulling over at that moment in my life.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for sharing.<br/>
