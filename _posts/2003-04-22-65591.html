<div id="ygrps-yiv-616834742">It&#39;s been a challenge for us to find books that interest both our older and younger daughters as they are 4 1/2 years apart and the younger, now 9, sometimes only wants something very gentle and familiar near bedtime. Some things that have appeal for both:<br/>
Owls in the Family  (forgotten author) <br/>
Rascal by Sterling North<br/>
The Incredible Journey<br/>
(can you tell we like animals?)<br/>
The Enchanted Forest Series by Patricia Wrede could also appeal to several levels, as it has adventure and mixed up fairy tale characters keep showing up in clever ways, which is funny for older listeners. These were our faves for a loooong time. <br/>
Sometimes we just have to read seperately, but right now we are reading Streams to the River, River to the Sea, about Sacajawea. I just don&#39;t read the really gory parts aloud, sometimes have older dd 14 read that paragraph to herself. (like the description of a buffalo bull dying, etc.) Younger dd does not want to hear it. <br/>
Instead of reading aloud to them whatever they are reading at the moment, I usually pick a book that we are reading aloud together, one that I think will interest both. <br/>
