<div id="ygrps-yiv-529714553">I just wanted to comment about the breastfeeding issue.� It was always my intention to breastfeed, we did not buy any bottles, formula nothing.� My pregnancy<br/>
was high-risk, at 33 weeks I went to a perineonatogist (?), every week for a BPP-30 minutes of fetal heart monitoring and extensive sonogram until I<br/>
delivered.� That was in addition to my regular obstetrician visits.� This was my 5th pregnancy-no children.� Between 41- 42 weeks the decision was made to<br/>
induce me, even though I was in labor.� Eleven and a half hours later, our daughter was born.� Thirty-six hours later we went home.� Three days later my milk<br/>
came in.� Within in three more days, nursing produced much anguish and many tears from both of us.� Husband made the suggestion to give her a bottle.� I<br/>
refused.� I called La Leche League, my doctor, etc.� Nothing helped and I was in no state to &quot;go to them&quot; for help.� I started pumping into bottles, great<br/>
relief.� A few weeks later we switched to formula and the whole atmosphere changed.� Instead of a home that was full of stress and chaos, it was filled with<br/>
contentment and a baby who was satisfied and starting to sleep 5-6 hours at night.� Since then I have lost another pregnancy and have come to the conclusion<br/>
that I never will uncover the &quot;joys&quot; of breastfeeding.� That is fine by us.� Our family is perfect the way it is and we all know the benefits that nursing<br/>
have, but for some of us it is not the &quot;best&quot; thing for the family.<br/>
I am not trying to discourage breastfeeding, but there are those among us that can&#39;t, or choose not to and it is not wrong to choose what works well.� My<br/>
daughter is now almost six years old and she is hardly ever sick!� Three colds, three ear infections, chicken pox, croup and one mild case of pneumonia.� I<br/>
would say being ill 9 times in 6 years, is not that bad.� That is a lot less then her cousins who were all breastfed for a year or more!<br/>
I feel that there are breastfeeding advocates out there that are just as demeaning as anti homeschoolers.� It is once again about choices for your family, no<br/>
one elses.� What is right for you, is not what is right for others.� I do support the right to breastfeed in public, where ever because it is natural and it<br/>
is a choice.� But for those who tend to be overzealous, it is not for everyone.<br/>

I hope nothing I said made you think that I believe breastfeeding is the only healthy way to do it, because that is not how I feel. Sometimes it&#39;s hard for<br/>
others to understand what you mean over e-mail.   I only nursed my son for 2 months and he is one of the healthiest kids I know.  He rarely ever gets sick.  He<br/>
has a health record about the same as your daughters, which I consider very good also, compared to other kids I know.   Breastfeeding is the most natural way to<br/>
feed our babies but sometimes there are extinuating (sp?) circumstances that make it impossible.  My pastor and his wife just had their 3rd girl and both the<br/>
first and the 3rd refused to nurse.  They just wanted nothing to do with it.  They had to start using formula, also.  The oldest is now 5 and a healthy, adorable<br/>
little girl and the youngest is now 4 months and is very healthy as well.  I agree that it has to be what works best for the family.  Their youngest is very<br/>
content with daddy as well as mommy and friends, where mine knows where her food comes from and isn&#39;t so content with dad or others.  I love having my daughter<br/>
with me wherever I go but sometimes I wish that my husband and I could go to dinner alone.<br/>
<br/>
Now with attachment parenting did you go out every once in a while, just you and your husband, or was the baby always with you?  Also, when baby fell asleep did<br/>
you put her in a crib or ... what did you do?  I&#39;m just curious.  I know some of you have talked about keeping the baby in a sling on you, but I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
for the sake of my back.  I don&#39;t have the greatest back as it is, and I would think that it would make it worse.  I would love to hear what you, and anyone<br/>
else, have to say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125422618">Hi Andi,<br/>
<br/>
Your story doesn&#39;t actually seem like a different viewpoint to me, just a<br/>
sad story of someone who really wanted to do something that&#39;s clearly best<br/>
for a baby but often extremely difficult, and didn&#39;t have the necessary<br/>
support.  La Leche was totally necessary for me the first year; I&#39;m so sorry<br/>
that you didn&#39;t get what you needed from them.  I also called pretty much<br/>
every registered lactation consultant in Philadelphia.  I&#39;m probably on<br/>
their &quot;insane women&quot; list now...:)<br/>
<br/>
Just because it&#39;s from our bodies doesn&#39;t mean it always comes naturally and<br/>
smoothly.  As another example, I know that unmedicated, unintervened birth<br/>
is clearly best for babies, but Annie did not get one of those.  I regret it<br/>
every day and think about it every day.  And we probably won&#39;t have another,<br/>
so I won&#39;t get to experience the kinds of births I read about that other<br/>
women have.  It hurts every time I read one, even though I&#39;m happy for the<br/>
women.  I relive the horrible beginning I gave Annie.  The one birth I will<br/>
have experienced was horrible and almost tragically fatal.  I ain&#39;t no earth<br/>
mother, even though I&#39;m still nursing Annie at 25 mos.<br/>
<br/>
Having things we wish had gone differently is probably totally par for the<br/>
course for parenting.  We do the best we can, always reflecting and trying<br/>
to foresee whatever problems will arise and be as informed as we can and<br/>
*still*, fate disposes.<br/>

&gt;I remember vividly the pain of breastfeeding.  It can be very painful, but <br/>
&gt;with time gets better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep -- I&#39;m very fair and with the first baby, I figured I had all the nipple<br/>
cracking and agony for three weeks because I wasn&#39;t positioning her right<br/>
(so said the helpful chirpy folks with more fortunate skin tones who never<br/>
had a moment&#39;s twinge of discomfort). I was incredibly stubborn, though (not<br/>
an ususual occurence &lt;g&gt;) and after a few weeks, I toughened up and things<br/>
went fine.<br/>
<br/>
So with the second baby, I knew all about positioning. I positioned the heck<br/>
out of that tyke. Still three weeks of holding in yelps of agony at latch<br/>
on, cracked nipples, the works. But I knew it would get better, and it did,<br/>
and she&#39;s two tomorrow and still nursing up a storm.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not always an easy journey, and if I have one complaint about La Leche<br/>
et al (at least some members) it&#39;s that assumption that everyone can have a<br/>
nice easy time of it. Many can, some can&#39;t, and if it gets too hard or<br/>
people don&#39;t WANT to yelp for three weeks, it&#39;s not a grave sin against<br/>
babykind...<br/>

Hey, I&#39;m back. &lt;g&gt; Been a busy few weeks here, I&#39;ve been skimming and not<br/>

have let them spend the night with friends, together, 4 times.  My husband is <br/>
from Jamaica and they 1, let the kids sleep in the same bed with them for <br/>
however long it takes, 2, don&#39;t ever leave with baby-sitter, if the kids <br/>
aren&#39;t welcome, they don&#39;t go.  Of course, in Ja, things are a lot different <br/>
then here in the US.  Lots of things are better here economically, but not to <br/>
the benefit of families and kids.  We are together 24/7 and I really don&#39;t <br/>
find that a problem.  I nursed both boys till they were 12 months, at which <br/>
point, much to my disappointment, they weaned themselves.  Every thing I have <br/>
ever done in my 50 years of life has been against the grain of whatever was <br/>

Andi,<br/>
    I sure hope that I wasn&#39;t demeaning in any way when I talked of <br/>
breastfeeding.<br/>
As I have said, I did not nurse my first two children (I also had alot of <br/>
difficulties in trying to nurse my first one).  However, I was finally able <br/>
to nurse my last two children.  This has made me very excited about nursing, <br/>
but I do not look down on those women who do not nurse.  Most of my friends <br/>
did not, as it was not as popular when we were having children.  The health <br/>
difference that I pointed out was between my own four children.  My first two <br/>
were sick alot with colds, allergies, ear infections etc.  My last two were <br/>
not sick much at all.  To me, that was a big blessing!!  My oldest was sick <br/>
so often with ear infections, that he couldn&#39;t even hear or talk for the <br/>
first 4 years of his life.  We were in the doctors office every time we <br/>
turned around.  That is exhausting!!!  I was thrilled when we didn&#39;t have to <br/>
go through that again!<br/>
     I am sorry for all your problems with miscarriage.  I also had <br/>
miscarriages after our fourth child, and I know how devastating that can be.<br/>
     Blessings to you and your beautiful 6 yr. old daughter :-)<br/>

Faith,<br/>
     My back isn&#39;t the greatest either.  I had an old Cosco (I think that is <br/>
right) cloth back/front baby carrier.  It was a pain strapping the baby in <br/>
(it took a few minutes to get everything hooked up right) but the straps <br/>
criss-crossed my back and had another strap around the small of my back.  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t uncomfortable at all, unless I had been walking or standing for long <br/>
periods of time (in which case my back would hurt anyway*g*).  Anyway, at a <br/>
LLL meeting, I heard about the sling, so I went right out and bought one.  <br/>
Well that thing *Killed* my back &lt;grrrrhhh&gt;.  I tried it on my hips and all <br/>
different positions.  Finally the LLL leader said that everyone couldn&#39;t use <br/>
them, that some people liked other packpacks better.  She still highly <br/>
encourage slings (for most people they are great), but for some people with <br/>
bad backs they don&#39;t work!  I loves my other carrier though.  I wore my <br/>
children nestled up against my chest and had both arms free to do dishes or <br/>
other jobs.  (if only it was easier to get them strapped into the thing <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872204576">Andi, I am sorry that breastfeding did not work for you.  If you did<br/>
everything you could do than you don&#39;t owe anyone an apology. <br/>
Congratulations on your precious daughter!  I&#39;m sure she means even more<br/>
to you for everything you went through.<br/>
Breastfeeding is an issue were &quot;informed choice&quot; stands out loud and<br/>
clear.  The majority of people who don&#39;t breastfeed did not have adequate<br/>
support or did not have adequate information before making the choice.<br/>
I can&#39;t speak to your situation.  I wasn&#39;t there and don&#39;t know all the<br/>
details.  La Leche League Leaders are VOLUNTEERS and are not required to<br/>
make home visits.  (Although some will, did you ask?)  Because most LLL<br/>
Leaders have children at home, making home visits would require that they<br/>
find a babysitter or bring their children with them.  Lactation<br/>
consultants are paid, and many of them will make home visits, for a fee.<br/>
When we talk about breastfeeding and health issues, its a numbers game. <br/>
Breastfed children can become ill.  Artificial baby-milk fed children can<br/>
be quite healthy.  But if you look at 1000&#39;s of children, those who were<br/>
breastfed are less likely to be seriously ill, less likely to be<br/>
hospitalized for illnesses, and have shorter durations of illness.  In<br/>
some parts of the world, children not breastfed die everyday!<br/>
In spite of the small number of women who truly CAN&#39;T breastfeed, it is<br/>
still the best choice for all the rest!  We have no problem making<br/>
parents feel bad if they don&#39;t use car seats or vaccinate (debatable<br/>
isssue).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418463601">Hi gang,<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like another lively discussion is up and coming, since the subject <br/>
of breastfeeding has been brought up.  I happily nursed son #1 until he <br/>
weaned himself.  Son #2 was nursed for several months and then started <br/>
formula.  I am now happily bottlefeeding my daughter.  All three of the kids <br/>
have thrived on their food.  <br/>
<br/>
Please, please, let&#39;s not get started on Breast Vs. Bottle.  That has got to <br/>
be the most flame-inducing topic I have ever run across on any board or list <br/>
I have ever been on.   Everyone has their own reasons for choosing one or the <br/>
other.  Also, if we could be sure to post this discussion under the subject <br/>
line of Breastfeeding then anyone who is not interested could skip over those <br/>
posts.  <br/>

Thanks a million!  : )<br/>

<br/>
Why Nurse A Toddler? <br/>
 <br/>
by Dr. Jack Newman<br/>
<br/>
 More and more mothers are choosing to breastfeed their babies, but<br/>
unfortunately, many moms feel that they need to stop before one year. You<br/>
may ask, &quot;But why would anyone want to nurse a toddler? How will he become<br/>
independent?&quot; Dr. Jack Newman answers our concerns and reveals the often<br/>
overlooked benefits of nursing a toddler. <br/>
 <br/>
Breastfeed a Toddler - Why on Earth?<br/>
Because more and more women are now breastfeeding their babies, more and<br/>
more are also finding that they enjoy breastfeeding enough to want to<br/>
continue longer than the usual few months they initially thought they would<br/>
do it. <br/>
<br/>
UNICEF has long encouraged breastfeeding for two years and longer, and the<br/>
American Academy of Pediatrics is now on record as encouraging mothers to<br/>
nurse at least one year and as long after as both mother and baby desire.<br/>
Breastfeeding to 3 and 4 years of age has been common in much of the world<br/>
until recently, and breastfeeding toddlers is still common in many societies. <br/>
<br/>
Why should breastfeeding continue past six months?<br/>
Because mothers and babies often enjoy breastfeeding a lot. Why stop an<br/>
enjoyable relationship? <br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
 But it is said that breastmilk has no value after six months.<br/>
Perhaps this is said, but it is wrong. That anyone can say such a thing<br/>
only shows how ignorant so many people in our society are about<br/>
breastfeeding. Breastmilk is, after all, milk. Even after six months, it<br/>
still contains protein, fat, and other nutritionally important and<br/>
appropriate elements which babies and children need. <br/>
 <br/>
Breastmilk still contains immunologic factors which help protect the baby.<br/>
In fact, some immune factors in breastmilk which protect the baby against<br/>
infection are present in greater amounts in the second year of life than in<br/>
the first. This is, of course as it should be, since children older than a<br/>
year are generally exposed to more infection. Breastmilk still contains<br/>
factors which help the immune system to mature, and which help the brain,<br/>
gut, and other organs to develop and mature. <br/>
<br/>
It has been well shown that children in daycare who are still breastfeeding<br/>
have far fewer and less severe infections than the children who are not<br/>
breastfeeding. The mother thus loses less work time if she continues<br/>
nursing her baby once she is back at her paid work. <br/>
<br/>
It is interesting that formula company marketing pushes the use of formula<br/>
(a rather imperfect copy of the real thing) for a year, yet implies that<br/>
breastmilk (from which the imperfect copy is copied) is only worthwhile for<br/>
6 months. Too many health professionals have taken up the refrain. <br/>
<br/>
I have heard that the immunologic factors prevent the baby from developing<br/>
his own immunity if I breastfeed past six months.<br/>
This is untrue; in fact, this is absurd. It is unbelievable how so many<br/>
people in our society twist around the advantages of breastfeeding and turn<br/>
them into disadvantages. We give babies immunizations so that they are able<br/>
to defend themselves against the real infection. <br/>
<br/>
Breastmilk also allows the baby to be able to fight off infections. When<br/>
the baby fights off these infections, he becomes immune. Naturally. <br/>
<br/>
But I want my baby to become independent.<br/>
And breastfeeding makes the toddler dependent? Don&#39;t believe it. The child<br/>
who breastfeeds until he weans himself (usually from 2 to 4 years), is<br/>
generally more independent, and, perhaps more importantly, more secure in<br/>
his independence. He has received comfort and security from the breast,<br/>
until he is ready to make the step himself to stop. <br/>
<br/>
And when he makes that step himself, he knows he has achieved something, he<br/>
knows he has moved ahead. It is a milestone in his life. Often we push<br/>
children to become &quot;independent&quot; too quickly. To sleep alone too soon, to<br/>
wean from the breast too soon, to do without their parents too soon, to do<br/>
everything too soon. Don&#39;t push and the child will become independent soon<br/>
enough. What&#39;s the rush? Soon they will be leaving home. You want them to<br/>
leave home at 14? <br/>
<br/>
Of course, breastfeeding can, in some situations, be used to foster an<br/>
over-dependent relationship. But so can food and toilet training. The<br/>
problem is not the breastfeeding. This is another issue. <br/>
<br/>
What else?<br/>
Possibly the most important aspect of nursing a toddler is not the<br/>
nutritional or immunologic benefits, important as they are. I believe the<br/>
most important aspect of nursing a toddler is the special relationship<br/>
between child and mother. <br/>
<br/>
Breastfeeding is a life affirming act of love. This continues when the baby<br/>
becomes a toddler. Anyone without prejudices, who has ever observed an<br/>
older baby or toddler nursing can testify that there is something almost<br/>
magical, something special, something far beyond food going on. A nursing<br/>
toddler will sometimes spontaneously break into laughter for no obvious<br/>
reason. His delight in the breast goes far beyond a source of food. <br/>
<br/>
And if the mother allows herself, breastfeeding becomes a source of delight<br/>
for her as well, far beyond the pleasure of providing food. Of course, it&#39;s<br/>
not always great, but what is? But when it is, it makes it all so worthwhile. <br/>
<br/>
And if the child does become ill or does get hurt (and they do as they meet<br/>
other children and become more daring), what easier way to comfort the<br/>
child than breastfeeding? I remember nights in the emergency department<br/>
when mothers would walk their ill, non nursing babies or toddlers up and<br/>
down the halls trying, often unsuccessfully, to console them, while the<br/>
nursing mothers were sitting quietly with their comforted, if not<br/>
necessarily happy, babies at the breast. <br/>
<br/>
The mother comforts the sick child with breastfeeding, and the child<br/>
comforts the mother by breastfeeding.</div>

I atribute breastfeeding that taking in account the contamination here at downtown,  owr sons are very healthy on a proportion of : more time been breastfed=more healthier they are.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522617097">I have nursed my daughter in a car.  A few times.  I was NOT driving. <br/>
 My daughter would be in her car seat, firmly and safely buckled.  This <br/>
was when she was facing backwards, and I was facing forwards.  I would <br/>
simply lean over the seat and let her nurse.  It came in handy a few <br/>
times, but the woman in question was DRIVING herself, baby was not in a <br/>
car seat, but in her arms.  This is downright dangerous.  A year or so <br/>
ago a newborn was killed in a roll over crash.  The mother also was <br/>
breastfeeding the baby, but mom was buckled in, baby was not, mom had <br/>
taken newborn (2 or so months old) out of the seat and was holding her. <br/>
 Everyone survived, some were injured but all survived.  Everyone else <br/>
was buckled in.  I just don&#39;t get why the woman couldn&#39;t have stopped <br/>
and nursed on the side of the road (this mom was not driving).  <br/>
<br/>
The times I nursed janene in the car seat were times where stopping <br/>
wasn&#39;t safe, the one time I remember clearly was on the way to vegas, at <br/>
night, in the middle of no where.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302573065">I wanted to say thank you for all the breastfeeding dialogue, it has <br/>
been really helpful to me, if not too disruptive to the list. But i <br/>
agree that breastfeeding/child led weaning parallels unschooling in a <br/>
way. And all this discussion has given me an appreciation for the <br/>
nursing relationship I have had with my younger two, and missed out <br/>
on the older one (the one that was sent to school for years).<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to the post about being busy nursing on vacation, we <br/>
went to myrtle beach when my youngest was 5 weeks old. The trip was <br/>
planned before the conception LOL. I am not a big vacation taker, and <br/>
i spent most of the time in the airconditioned suite being with my <br/>
baby boy, while everyone else ran around town. <br/>
<br/>
And then there was the boat trip to Johnstown to collect shells, <br/>
Ashlyn was not even two, and was scared on the boat. We sat in the <br/>
back of the boat trying to keep a blanket from blowing off as I <br/>
tandem nursed for the only time in public. I am a very discreet <br/>
nurser, and that was a challenge. My sister took delight in taking <br/>
advantage and snapping a picture. LOL<br/>
<br/>
My daughter who nursed until three was given a baby bottle of water <br/>
on a road trip when she was almost a year old, and she never would <br/>
take a pacifier. She would occasionally do the bottle of water. She <br/>
wouldn&#39;t wean when I was pregnant and completely dried up. SHe nursed <br/>
until her brother was a year old, and I tried for months distracting <br/>
her away from nursing. She was more &quot;attached&quot; in the sense that she <br/>
cried more, was in the sling constantly, even when I was first <br/>
pregnant with brother. <br/>
<br/>
Now my 2yo son has never had any artificial nipple, so now my theory <br/>
that he is less attached/more independant and will wean sooner <br/>
probably will not play out. He was not in the sling that much at all, <br/>
very happy and independant, but shy and loves mommy and baby milk. He <br/>
has only been able to say Baby Milk for a few weeks, but he talks <br/>
about it in his sleep. <br/>
<br/>
So, I am not going to push the weaning. I am going to continue the <br/>
don&#39;t offer/don&#39;t refuse, but man he nurses a lot as long as we are <br/>
home. I need to get out more. He also wakes up a lot in the night to <br/>
nurse, which I get tired of. <br/>
<br/>
My dh, being more proactive, up and decided to get a tv and hook a <br/>
vcr in their room to get them both to sleep in there. I can&#39;t say it <br/>
is working. And BL(before this list), I was very much against tv&#39;s in <br/>
bedrooms. So, whatever. They both ended up with me the same night, <br/>
and he hit the couch. My almost 4yo sometimes likes to sleep in her <br/>
bed, but that night she had bad dreams about mommy and daddy getting <br/>
hurt. So screw the TV. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;ll have plenty of time to sleep without kids when they are <br/>
growing up too fast, and I will lay awake wondering where the time <br/>
went and wishing for just a few more moments of cuddling with my <br/>
babies....<br/>

Enjoy this time, get yourself enough sleep. Find ways to nap and do <br/>
other stuff when you can.<br/>
