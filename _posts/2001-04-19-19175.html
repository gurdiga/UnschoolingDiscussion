<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390541121">Lynda, how did you get involved in this? Do you foster<br/>
parent, or just take in kids you know? I would love to<br/>
do this. I&#39;ve taken in teens who needed a place to be<br/>
for a while, but never anything official. I would like<br/>
to foster parent, but I&#39;m a little nervous about it.<br/>
We do exchange students, but it&#39;s not the same. I want<br/>
to help kids who need help. I have so much love for<br/>
kids to give that I want to give it to kids who need<br/>
me or someone like me. Do you have info? Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846090740">I would recommend two books - on the personal hygiene issues, <br/>
American Girl Library has a great book - The Care & Keeping of You, <br/>
the Body Book for Girls.  Their description is: This &quot;head to toe <br/>
guide&quot; answers all your questions, from hair care to healthy eating, <br/>
bad breath to bras, periods to pimples, and everything in between.<br/>
<br/>
The second book is the Teenage Liberation Handbook, by Grace <br/>
Llewellyn. It&#39;s a great overview of unschooling, and freedom for <br/>
teenagers, and a general idea of ways to help them learn on their own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723079791">All the kids and one of our horses (this is a whole other story &lt;g&gt;) have<br/>
brought home the &quot;walking wounded.&quot;  We take them in and do the best we can<br/>
to help them heal.<br/>
<br/>
The latest is 16 and from a single parent home.  Mother is an alcoholic, was<br/>
a drug addict, had lived with a Chinese mafia member and sold drugs so you<br/>
can image what his home life was.  He had no home, she had been evicted and<br/>
he was living from spare bed to spare bed while she spent his Social<br/>
Security survivors benefits.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been living with us off and on for a year now.  He was in the throw<br/>
away school and now is eating up learning because no one is forcing him to<br/>
go to school.  Would you believe biology and psychology?  He makes me tired<br/>
with all that he wants to learn.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, there are two kinds of foster homes, licensed and legal<br/>
guardians.  With the licensed home you get paid to care for kids.  With the<br/>
legal guardians you go to court and become the legal guardian.  In the above<br/>
case he asked us if we would become his legal guardian.<br/>
<br/>
With your track record with doing the exchange student programs you should<br/>
have a step up in the process.  Also, if you are willing to take teenagers<br/>
you will also be in a group that they are begging for!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, every state and then each county within the states are different.<br/>
I&#39;d check with your local licensing agency (usually through Social Services<br/>
or CPS).  If you are a minority or half of a mixed family, they are really<br/>
looking for you!<br/>
<br/>
The only thing you need to remember and it sure helps is that you aren&#39;t<br/>
going to cure these kids in most cases, you will help them but alot of them<br/>
can&#39;t be totally &quot;fixed.&quot;  Our motto is &quot;We love you as you are, let&#39;s grow<br/>
together.&quot;  One of our &quot;kids&quot; learned cross-stitch and did this for us.<br/>
With that in mind you don&#39;t set yourself or the kids up for failure or hurt.<br/>

to teenagers when I was younger and a lot of those girls just needed someone to
