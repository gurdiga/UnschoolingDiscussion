Our culture seems to assume that any choice a child makes will be a &quot;bad&quot; <br/>
one. When I started to believe, to Trust, that my children WILL make good <br/>
choices, they STARTED to make good choices.<br/>
Talking about different types of foods, modeling healthy eating behaviors, <br/>
and helping them choose (rather than choosing for them) will enable them to make <br/>
the right choices for themselves.<br/>
This may take time for children who have been previously restricted, whether <br/>
or not the restrictions were overt or subtle.<br/>

Elissa wrote that, and it&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
And whether their choices are &quot;good&quot; or not in the beginning, until a parent <br/>
takes off that chihuahua harness and those blinders and those rules (off the <br/>
child or off themselves, wherever they&#39;re strongest), the child cannot possibly <br/>
make choices, because there are no choices to make.<br/>
<br/>
Some adults feel bound by their own upbringing and by being observed and <br/>
&quot;tested&quot; and judged by their parents or neighbors or whoever, and in such cases <br/>
even the parents haven&#39;t learned to make choices.   Theyre living on automatic, <br/>
and working to turn their kids into automatons too.<br/>

Thought requires enough space to think.<br/>
Freedom requires some time to decide.<br/>
<br/>
Decision making can&#39;t begin to happen when all the answers are prescribed and <br/>
only a small set of outcomes are &quot;right.&quot;<br/>
