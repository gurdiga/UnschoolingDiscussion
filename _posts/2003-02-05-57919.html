 </span></blockquote>We live in a similar situation in VA. There are no quick trips to the store. <br/>
You get used to the driving though. It&#39;s well worth living in the country. As <br/>
my husband says, &quot;You can piss off your balcony without your neighbor giving <br/>
you grief (I think he did this once just to say he did it).&quot; <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right about the overnights. All my daughter&#39;s friends are 30 to 45 <br/>
minutes away. In fact pretty much everything is this far away. I don&#39;t even <br/>
think of it most of the time, just factor in the driving time when we&#39;re <br/>
&quot;going to town.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
There are times though that I wish there were kids close by. My son has one <br/>
friend about 5 minutes away, but my daughter has no one nearby. One year we <br/>
actually had a neighbor with a daughter. What a great year for Carly. <br/>
Unfortunately the next year the girl went to middle school and wouldn&#39;t <br/>
associate with my elementary aged daughter (they were only 1 1/2 years apart <br/>
in age) anymore. AGH! Ah well, so we drive a lot (sports practices, play <br/>
practices, voice lessons, homeschool group, friends houses, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
Any unschoolers want to move to beautiful central VA? Builders are putting in <br/>
large acre homes on a recently purchased farm across the street. They don&#39;t <br/>
seem to be destroying the woods. <br/>
<br/>
Enough rambling,<br/>
