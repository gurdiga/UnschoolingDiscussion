<div id="ygrps-yiv-931348127">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
      I wrote a while back about video game use and my 6yo son - I have since relaxed quite a bit, and he plays as long as he wants, for the most part, unless we&#39;re going out.  I have seen big benefits - such as improved self-esteem (!), more connection with Dad, improved &quot;navigating skills&quot; - he can&#39;t read, but somehow gets around all the menus of the video games without any help!<br/>
<br/>
      The one thing left for me around the kids choosing what they want all the time is that we&#39;re not spending as much time outside together as we used to.  I&#39;m pulling out sprinklers, going to the beach, buying bubbles, going to the park, rollerblading, biking, inviting friends over, and feeling like I&#39;m standing on my head to entertain them out-of-doors!  Once I relax, or stop &quot;entertaining&quot;, they run back inside, and I wish that I could put my feet up outside, and have them play outside in the fresh air near me, without any effort on my part.  Has anyone else felt this way in the summertime?  I&#39;m shuddering inside as I think of winter coming - it&#39;s so much harder for me to get all 3 kids outside, dressed, etc in the cold, cold winter.  I&#39;m really appreciating the nice weather!<br/>
<br/>
      Also, one other question - how do you know if you&#39;re providing enough stimulation?  I read Sandra&#39;s comment about providing globes, musical opportunities, etc.etc. - and I felt a momentary panic.  What if the draw towards the video games is in part because of nothing better to do? How would I know? What other activities have you offered in your homes for active, curious 6 year old boys?  I also have a 2 year old boy, who gets into everything as all 2 year olds do, which is sometimes limiting in what we can do together as a family.<br/>
<br/>
      Thank-you in advance!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Except that you do offer them tons of other things and he heads back.  That <br/>
sounds like a really good indication that his first choice is the game.<br/>
<br/>
My son got logged off his game after 17 straight hours.  -sigh-  Wish I <br/>
could get 17 hours to devote to something I love with no one interfering <br/>
and no one denigrating it.<br/>
<br/>
And what if the draw of the game is that he loves it?  Why try to draw him <br/>
away from it if he enjoys it?  It helps to think of all activities as <br/>
having value--not just outside activities.  Or not just family activities.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No offense, but.... (which usually means somebody is about to be <br/>
offensive, but in this case it means I&#39;m asking you not to take <br/>
offense) -- if something is drawing kids to it, it IS because there is <br/>
nothing better to do.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just a fact. IF they saw something else as &quot;better to do,&quot; <br/>
they&#39;d do that instead.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to work really hard and provide really cool things to do in <br/>
order to excite them about other things, it means they&#39;re REALLY  <br/>
enjoying the video games. That&#39;s good - they are doing things they <br/>
really like.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you shouldn&#39;t work quite so hard and instead let them choose to <br/>
play video games more - since they obviously are really enjoying it!<br/>
<br/>
I was tempted to say to put the video games outdoors, if the kids being <br/>
outdoors is really important to you. Then I remembered how my husband <br/>
turned our tv to face out the back window once, when it was really hot <br/>
inside and he wanted to sit on the patio and watch tv. Nothing wrong <br/>
with that, imo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I think back<br/>
On all the crap I learned in high school<br/>
It&#39;s a wonder<br/>
I can think at all<br/>

games is in part because of nothing better to do? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Globes were an example of things I&#39;ve heard parents say they didn&#39;t need/want <br/>
at their houses.  Kids won&#39;t turn off a video game to play with a globe <br/>
they&#39;ve had for years, and globes get outdated too.  It&#39;s not about globes <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby learned to read maps from the first Nintendo player&#39;s guide, with the <br/>
full Mario world laid out from beginning to end, with the locations of all the <br/>
rewards and dangers.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What other activities have you offered in your homes for active, curious 6 <br/>
year old boys? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why &quot;in your homes&quot;?   That&#39;s the problem with &quot;home&quot;-schooling, too much <br/>
emphasis on home.   Active curious six year old boys need movement in and around <br/>
new things they haven&#39;t seen before.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also have a 2 year old boy, who gets into everything as all 2 year olds <br/>
do, which is sometimes limiting in what we can do together as a family.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When we had little kids we would try to focus on them. Find a park the baby <br/>
liked, and the other kids could find things to do there too.   Find a concert <br/>
or puppet show the baby could like and the other kids probably had fun too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Once I relax, or stop &quot;entertaining&quot;, they run back inside, and I wish <br/>
that I could put my feet up outside, and have them play outside in the fresh air <br/>
near me, without any effort on my part. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You would be gaining the picturesque feel-good American family moment, and <br/>
they would be gaining...  what?  Fresh air?  Open some windows in the house and <br/>
get a fan that blows air in, maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
Fresh air is overrated sometimes, and the air outside isn&#39;t always fresh. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 Still there&#39;s this &quot;out in the fresh air&quot; ideal.   My mom used to say &quot;Get <br/>
your nose out of that book and go out and play.&quot;    She was partly jealous that <br/>
I could have a life without her, a life different from hers, and she was <br/>
partly wanting to feel like she was a good mom by controlling me and having me do <br/>
something she could checklist, report to anyone who asked.  &quot;Are they getting <br/>
enough exercise and fresh air?&quot; or whatever.   <br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday Holly was talking about sitting in one tree we have, when she <br/>
was little, and drawing. I told her I used to go up on our barn and draw.    <br/>
What I didn&#39;t tell her was I was on the barn because my mom chucked me out of <br/>
the house.  So sitting (just sitting &lt;g&gt;) 20 feet up on the edge of a pitched <br/>
tin roof seemed kind of like revenge.  Was it safe?  Comfortable?   Nice view.  <br/>
Nice possibility of death.   In retrospect, I think being in my own little <br/>
half-underground room right off the kitchen, without fresh air, reading a book, <br/>
would&#39;ve been better.<br/>
<br/>
My mom didn&#39;t know what I wanted or needed.  She just knew vaguely in herself <br/>
that I shouldn&#39;t be getting to choose, that she was the mom and should be in <br/>
control of where I was, what I was doing, and what air I was breathing.<br/>
<br/>
She herself was sitting listening to the radio, drinking beer and smoking <br/>
cigarettes, if she wasn&#39;t in the yard putzing, pulling weeds, and smoking <br/>
cigarettes.<br/>

<br/>
At our old house we were bursting at the seams.  We had a big covered patio, <br/>
bigger than any room inside.  Keith helped the neighbors move and they gave <br/>
him a big color TV.  He put it on a folding table against the wall of the house <br/>
so no rain or snow could get to it, and he used to watch Babylon 5 out there, <br/>
even in the winter (wrapped in a blanket, sitting on the couch that didn&#39;t fit <br/>
inside anymore).  Several times the kids hooked the Nintendo up out there.  <br/>
It worked because the patio had a totally solid roof and there wasn&#39;t any glare.<br/>

<br/>
Kirby&#39;s birthday was last Thursday, and they put four TVs upstairs (his, <br/>
Marty&#39;s and two borrowed from friends) all hooked up to play 16 player Halo.  They <br/>
played for hours that night, and then the next day, and Saturday people <br/>
played.  Sunday they didn&#39;t.  Monday a couple of people played.  They could&#39;ve done <br/>
that on one TV.  Gradually other friends have taken their parts of the big <br/>
set-up home.   Yesterday, Tuesday, I asked a couple of times, &quot;Aren&#39;t you guys <br/>
going to play Halo?&quot;  A couple of kids watched a movie up there, because an <br/>
X-box will play a DVD.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I was pressing them to play was that if they&#39;re done, Keith could <br/>
use his folding table back, and I miss having Kirby&#39;s TV in his room.  It&#39;s <br/>
really nice for me to be able to put in a familiar movie, or a new one, and use <br/>
the computer in his room.  But for almost a week now, no TV in his room.  And <br/>
they&#39;re not playing Halo anymore.   <br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t control these kids. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Not only is it more descriptive -- of unschoolers in particular though not<br/>
for strict school at homers -- but it would highlight a weakness of<br/>
schooling. With the word homeschooling educators imagine kids locked away<br/>
from their peers with just mom at home. With world schooling we&#39;d be<br/>
&quot;pointing out&quot; (without having to point it out) that we were out in the<br/>
world and they were the ones locked away. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is it exactly - except that I too enjoy being in the fresh <br/>
air, as well as with my kids, and when we&#39;re hiking, or outside, <br/>
anywhere, I have a great time.  Spiritual.  That kind of thing.  I <br/>
guess I was looking for other people that too enjoy getting outside, <br/>
but don&#39;t get the same enthusiasm from their kids.  But your <br/>
description of the &quot;should&quot; part of the getting outside equation is <br/>
also a part of it, too. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve received feedback from the list about how great video games are, <br/>
and I&#39;m not thinking that this is my concern right now.  My concerns <br/>
are not so much about video games (I&#39;ve truly seen many benefits tied <br/>
to making their own decisions, whether it&#39;s video games or not), but <br/>
about making sure that there are enough other enticing opportunities <br/>
in case they&#39;re interested, as well as meeting my own needs for <br/>
outdoor time.  I really appreciated your ideas about parks, puppet <br/>
shows, etc.  We do that, but not as much as I&#39;d like, I guess.  It&#39;s <br/>
the rest of the time that they...make their own decisions about stuff <br/>
while we&#39;re hanging out at home.  Which is great.  But then I&#39;m back <br/>
to whether or not we have enough to do around the house for them.  If <br/>
I&#39;m not interacting with them (or even if I am) then my son is <br/>
playing video games. And I do play with them, but of course, not all <br/>
the time. I&#39;m not so concerned about my daughter - she reads, plays <br/>
Barbies, nurtures her guinea pig, writes stories, watches the <br/>
occasional movie, does all sorts of things that I can appreciate.  I <br/>
guess it&#39;s also because I don&#39;t often see my son enjoying anything <br/>
else but the video games.  Again, not about the video games, per se, <br/>
but wanting to make sure I&#39;ve got enough around here, in case he&#39;s <br/>
interested.  I remember a thread a while back about quilting shows, <br/>
and the suggestion was that a 9 year old boy would not like them, <br/>
likely, so do things more age/gender appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
So, again, what other things have people on this list offered <br/>
(toys,activities) for active 6 year old boys who love woodworkiing, <br/>
sports (he&#39;s extremely athletic and capable), beyblades?  Kind of <br/>
into crafts, but not so much.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What if they don&#39;t want anything more to do than just sit and play <br/>
video games.  Sometimes my daughter just draws.  Nothing else, just <br/>
draws.  Sometimes I just read.  We do lots, but sometimes we just <br/>
need to veg.     <br/>
<br/>
***How would I know?*** <br/>
<br/>
The way you&#39;d know is because it wouldn&#39;t be working.  The kids <br/>
would be whining or complaining or even straight out asking for <br/>
something to do.  If they&#39;re not, then it&#39;s probably ok.  Also, how <br/>
do they act when you take them away from the video games?  Are they <br/>
happy you suggested something else or reluctant to go?    <br/>

the world as a book opening up. The world is our &quot;text&quot; book!<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is a great way to get the kids excited about going outside and<br/>
hiking, Michele. You can find out more at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.letterboxing.org">http://www.letterboxing.org</a> and<br/>
you can see our stamp if you follow the Letterboxing link from my webpage<br/>
below.<br/>
<br/>
Lboxing is kind of a scavenger hunt/ hike/ outing. It gives a reason to go<br/>
somewhere new, and a goal for the hike, which in my experience makes all the<br/>
difference with kids. We were out hiking the other day, without letterboxing<br/>
and the kids flagged about 15 minutes in--they&#39;re 7, 5 and 4. For a lbox,<br/>
they can hike about 2 or 3 miles--just to put it in perspective. It&#39;s a lot<br/>
of fun, and it&#39;s great to do as a diversion on long trips. You can find some<br/>
boxes on the way and take some time out of the car. Once the kids get older,<br/>
we&#39;ll probably graduate to geocaching, which is similar but with a GPS and<br/>
souveneirs. It sounds like great fun, too.<br/>
<br/>
We also rock climb, which gets the kids outdoors a lot. We go climbing<br/>
pretty much every weekend as a family. We also built a climbing wall off the<br/>
kids&#39; climber, and we&#39;ll all play around on that several times a week. My<br/>
youngest--4 and only son--probably plays on it the least, for what it&#39;s<br/>
worth. He&#39;s pretty happy to be inside playing his new Scooby-Doo game or<br/>
some other computer game. Dh and youngest dd (5) probably use it the most,<br/>
and it&#39;s been some really great bonding time for them. I climb during the<br/>
week some, but I&#39;m mostly outside putzing with my gardens or my chickens.<br/>
The kids like coming in and out at their liesure. They help some, get bored<br/>
or hot and go back in. They also play outside with neighbors a lot--it&#39;s<br/>
always more fun with extra kids. They like feeding the fish or trying to<br/>
catch frogs in the pond. We&#39;ve got lots of fun stuff outside--and lots of<br/>
fun stuff inside. They&#39;re pretty much free to choose whatever, except when<br/>
they&#39;re totally bouncing off the walls and I &quot;suggest&quot; we all go out for a<br/>
game.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, but it&#39;s really cool to see how the globes change. My youngest, Sam<br/>
(4), loves maps. We pick them up where ever we see them: atlas type maps,<br/>
topo maps, cartoon maps, shopping maps, tourist maps, treasure maps, you<br/>
name it. He loves holding a map and giving directions. He&#39;s still has a hand<br/>
drawn treasure map, colored on his placemat at a restaurant three weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
So even an outdated globe can be fun to pull out and look at given the right<br/>
context. No, it&#39;s not about the globe itself, but more about having fun<br/>
stuff and finding fun stuff that you can pull out at the right time. That&#39;s<br/>
the point I like in Sandra&#39;s house as a museum article.<br/>

  Yeah, we should call it world schooling!<br/>
<br/>
  Not only is it more descriptive -- of unschoolers in particular though not<br/>
  for strict school at homers -- but it would highlight a weakness of<br/>
  schooling. With the word homeschooling educators imagine kids locked away<br/>
  from their peers with just mom at home. With world schooling we&#39;d be<br/>
  &quot;pointing out&quot; (without having to point it out) that we were out in the<br/>
  world and they were the ones locked away. ;-)<br/>

Boy, I got lucky. I was in Year 7, reading in the playground. I looked up<br/>
and yikes, the place was deserted. The bell had rung and I didn&#39;t even hear<br/>
it. I hurried back to class, probably 10 minutes late, and said, &quot;Sorry I<br/>
was reading.&quot; The teacher just told me to sit down, without anger. This was<br/>
the same teacher who we managed to crack up uncontrollably by attaching cut<br/>
out paper hands to our rulers to hold up instead of our hands. To this day,<br/>
I know it was funny, but THAT funny?<br/>
