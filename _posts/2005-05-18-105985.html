<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025487843">It seems everyday I find a wonderful reason to be unschooling. However<br/>
recently I have come across a biggie. I just found out our school<br/>
district is sending the kids entering 5th grade to the middle school.<br/>
It means an extra 2 hours a day for these kids. My youngest would be<br/>
with these kids. It seems the elementary schools crowded themselves<br/>
when they started all day kindergarten. <br/>
<br/>
I imagine if I hadn&#39;t pulled him last fall I would have done it<br/>
this one. BTW  the middle school and high school share a bus out this<br/>
way.So these 10 yos will be riding a bus with kids as old as 18 ,<br/>
seems kinda scary. (No offense to anyone who has teenagers) <br/>
<br/>
When that old yellow bus comes rolling around 6:45 am on the first day<br/>
of school next year you bet I&#39;ll be holding my boys extra<br/>
close!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder how many calls I&#39;ll be getting to ask about<br/>
homeschooling?? hmmmmm... <br/>
