I think it was you who asked me if the name of that program for children with <br/>
autism was Sonrise, and yes, it is, and it also has another part to it that <br/>
is just for individual or family empowerment.<br/>

told me. . . but I know some friends went this summer for a 8 week thing and <br/>
I believe it was in New York. . . at least between here (Philly) and Vermont. <br/>
:) I know. . .a lot of area between there. The people who run it (I think its <br/>
called the Sonlight Foundation . . . the name of the entire program) are <br/>
coming to my friend&#39;s house to give a program about the whole thing. . . not <br/>
necessarily the autism part, but the entire program. <br/>
