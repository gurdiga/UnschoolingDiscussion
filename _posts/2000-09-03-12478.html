repeatedly.  However, what could possibly be more appropriate to this list <br/>
than a request for help in working out a difference of opinion with DH?  <br/>
Answers to how to work out this particular &#39;problem&#39; could just as easily <br/>
translate to how to work out when to begin reading, or what counts as <br/>
&#39;school&#39;.  Look at how many  requests there are for things like &quot;what&#39;s a <br/>
normal 5 (2, 3, 13, etc) yr old?&quot;  &quot;How can I show DH (or other <br/>
relatives/neighbors/school officials) that unschooling is right for me?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;When do baby teeth fall out?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen a topic yet that didn&#39;t give someone an opportunity to learn <br/>
and grow.  If there wasn&#39;t a need, the questions would never be asked!<br/>
<br/>
This is only my opinion, but I think the original post was an appropriate <br/>
subject which brought out lots of differing opinions and different view <br/>
points, every one of which was &#39;tainted&#39; by the poster&#39;s own personal <br/>
experience.  That&#39;s how it works.  Try not to take it personally (hard advice <br/>
for a personal topic, I know!).   <br/>
<br/>
It comes down to personal responsibility.  Learn from the topic, contribute <br/>
to the thread or use the delete key!<br/>

I know your feelings are hurt right now and there have been hot tempers, IMO, <br/>
but don&#39;t let it keep you away.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059896548">Okay. Now I am over my hurt and I am just plain angery. I have <br/>
something to say on the subject of corporal punishment. There is a <br/>
time and a place for it. In the situation that I shared about my son <br/>
running off in a packed mall I had repeatedly discussed the matter of <br/>
running off and explained to him repeatedly that I must be able to <br/>
see him at all times when we are in public. I would have explained <br/>
further as to some of the dangers, kidnapping being number one, <br/>
however I did not feel this was appropriate at his age. And maybe I <br/>
could have come up with other danger/reasons as to why I had to see <br/>
him at all times, however, at the time I was not in a situation to <br/>
readily come up with these as it was the first time I was having to <br/>
deal with this situation, he is my oldest child. He did understand <br/>
the rule of not running off and I knew he understood because he had <br/>
exhibited his understanding by not running off when it was obvious <br/>
that he wanted to. He understood. This day he was preoccupied by the <br/>
colors and lights of a near by store and forgot the rule and left me <br/>
to go to the store to explore. I would have had no problem taking him <br/>
there to look if he had just asked, but he didn&#39;t. He placed himself <br/>
in a potentially dangerous situation. The danger was that the mall <br/>
was packed. It was a weekend and in the afternoon. It was extremely <br/>
likely that he could have been kidnapped by some pervert. Anyone <br/>
watched the news lately. You know what they do to kids they take. The <br/>
danger was that whoever may have took him very likely could have <br/>
molested him in ways that you or I could never imagine that anyone <br/>
could molest, then killed him, dimembered him, cooked him and <br/>
devoured him. Any and every one of these things was likely to have <br/>
happened to him. Just as likely as it to get cut when playing with a <br/>
knife. However, he wasn&#39;t playing with a knife. He sepparated himself <br/>
from the safety of his mother without her knowledge. And to tell me <br/>
that I am abusive because I spanked him on his bare hiney for this is <br/>
ludicriss. To judge me and say that I damaged him physically, <br/>
mentally, and sexually because I spanked him on his bare hiney is <br/>
utterly rediculous especially in comparison to the possible damage of <br/>
the danger he placed himself in at that time and possibly in the <br/>
future if I had not taken the opportunity to express to him the <br/>
severity of his choice to run off. He made a choice that he knew was <br/>
wrong and I held him accountable for that choice. And after I spanked <br/>
him let him know that I still loved him. And I also let him know how <br/>
scared I was when I didn&#39;t know where he was, that I thought I would <br/>
never see him again. I hug and kiss my children every day. In nearly <br/>
6 years there hasn&#39;t been a day gone by that we haven&#39;t shared this <br/>
affection toward each other. I have always made it a point to let my <br/>
children know that there is nothing they can do or say that will make <br/>
me stop loving them. They could commit the worst crime and I will <br/>
still love them. That doesn&#39;t mean that I will agree and support what <br/>
they do. It means they will always have a place in my heart and that <br/>
place will never shrink. They know I love them and I know they love <br/>
me. So if you think that I am abusive because I spanked my child <br/>
almost 2 years ago that is your opinion. It is my opinion that you <br/>
judge too quickly seeming that you passed this judgement on me not <br/>
knowing me, my background or really much of my personal situation. <br/>
And I guess if that is the responsibility you want that is your <br/>
choice to pass that type of judgement on another person. And in <br/>
defense of DH. Just because he thinks that we should start using a <br/>
switch on the children does not make him physically abusive either. <br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean that I agree with him however it doesn&#39;t make him <br/>
abusive. Everyone has thier way of dealing with certain situations. <br/>
And just because one way is harsher than another doesn&#39;t mean it is <br/>
abuse. If the public/govn&#39;t starts dictating how a parent can and <br/>
can&#39;t disapline thier child then we all may as well send our children <br/>
to public school and let the govn&#39;t raise all children. Here is an <br/>
article that explains the difference between abuse and over <br/>
discipline. There is a huge difference. And just because a person <br/>
spanks thier child does not mean that they have over disciplined <br/>
thier child. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cpswatch.com/reports/discipline.htm">http://www.cpswatch.com/reports/discipline.htm</a> Corallyn</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85247908">Piffle!  Now, I tried to keep this from going there but you are insisting,<br/>
so here it is!  I am a mandated reporter and hitting a child until your<br/>
hand hurts or using objects to hit them with is abuse as defined by the<br/>
codes of  every state.<br/>
<br/>
A four year old is a child and if the child got away from an adult, it is<br/>
the ADULT&#39;s responsibility!  Period!<br/>
<br/>
As to judging, this isn&#39;t a case of defining &quot;is.&quot;  Who someone is or isn&#39;t<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any weight.  Each and every abuser states they love their<br/>
children or spouse.  Every single solitary one of them!  That doesn&#39;t<br/>
justify hitting.<br/>
<br/>
That article is one person&#39;s opinion and not the defintion of child abuse. <br/>
Also, the case that she uses to define the difference between excessive<br/>
discipline and abuse is typical of how an abuser starts.  In most cases<br/>
they escalate to serious damages to the children.  Luckily for this one<br/>
particular child that there was a worker who had the time to continually<br/>
run out and play interference for him.  In the long run the sister will<br/>
probably grow up the happier and more well balanced person!  The son will<br/>
probably end up a candidate for the Maury or Jenny Jones shows!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770430823">While is sounds like you absolutely love and adore your son, your <br/>
facts are incorrect about kidnapping... Read Gavin De Becker&#39;s Books <br/>
and you will find that most children and kidnapped (if at all) by the <br/>

of kidnaps that are by perverts and strangers.  The majority of kids <br/>
that are molested and kidnapped actually know the person and the <br/>
person is usually brought into the home by the parent!!!  Friends, <br/>
teachers, coaches and more likely to kidnap and molest kids than <br/>
some &quot;pervert&quot; walking down the street.<br/>
<br/>
In his books he talks about parents worrying about kids being <br/>

people close to them... <br/>

that&#39;s not to say I wouldn&#39;t be utterly beside myself if my son ran <br/>

<br/>
My opinion on spanking is still the same and has nothing to do with <br/>
whatever you wrote initially.  I didn&#39;t read that post... my response <br/>
was to what someone wrote about corporal punishment.  I still believe <br/>
spanking is abusive and if you don&#39;t that&#39;s ok, that&#39;s what you are <br/>
comfortable with.  However I notice you spend a lot of time defending <br/>
it and being outraged that other people think spanking is abusive.  <br/>
That&#39;s life... People in this world seem to all have differing <br/>
opinions about things and just because they don&#39;t jive with yours <br/>
does not mean they are offensive, rude or whatever you want to call <br/>
it.  In my opinion, and that&#39;s exactly the only opinion I can give, <br/>
spanking is abusive.  If you and I don&#39;t agree that&#39;s really ok with <br/>
me.  I don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s approval of my belief system.</div>

abuse as defined by the codes of  every state.<br/>
<br/>
First of all I am not the one who insisted. YOU all are the ones who <br/>
chose to judge me on based on something that happened nearly 2 years <br/>
ago and if you think I am abusive to my kids call CPS on me. I really <br/>
don&#39;t give a flying______. I know what they will find. Spanking a <br/>
child one time on the bare bum doesn&#39;t not make an abuser. You can&#39;t <br/>
judge a person on ONE INCIDENT. And I don&#39;t care what your position <br/>
is. I don&#39;t care if you are a mandated reporter you are not in the <br/>
position to judge me on something you heard over the internet about <br/>
someone you never met. If you knew me personally and then chose to <br/>
judge me on what you know of me that would be completely different, <br/>
but the majority of the people who have replied to my post have <br/>
judged me based on one incident 2 years ago. Now, maybe it is that <br/>
you all think that I am a liar and therefore if I spanked him as such <br/>
2 years ago then I spank him like that every time he does something <br/>
inappropriate, but that is assuming and you have no evidence as such.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; A four year old is a child and if the child got away from an adult, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it is the ADULT&#39;s responsibility!  Period!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are absulutely right. It is my responsibility. I am responsible <br/>
for how I teach my children and at preasant the choices they make and <br/>
how I deal with those choices. And how they turn out as adults is a <br/>
reflection on me as a parent. I give them choices to make. Age <br/>
apropriate choices every day i.e. picking up after themselves, what <br/>
program do you want to watch, what story would you like to read, and <br/>
there are choices they make everyday on their own that I am not even <br/>
aware of, and they are aware of the rules. When one of these rules is <br/>
broken my manner in dealing with it is such that I allow them to take <br/>
a certain amount of responsibility for that. It is my responsibility <br/>
to teach my children that there are conciquences for the choices they <br/>
make whether it is for good or bad. This does not mean that the <br/>
responsibility I allow them to take is in the palm of my hand or a <br/>
stick or a whip or any other object. But at five almost six years old <br/>
he tends to blame me for him being sent to his room or having the toy <br/>
taken away or loosing a privilidge and the fact is that I would not <br/>
do any of these things for no reason. Which is what he tends to think <br/>
I do. And I explain to him that it is his behavior that is <br/>
inappropriate and that when he is ready to act appropriate then he <br/>
may have the privilidge returned. And  our day goes on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As to judging, this isn&#39;t a case of defining &quot;is.&quot;  Who someone is <br/>

That doesn&#39;t justify hitting.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So if a person states that they love their children and spanks them <br/>
for something they did wrong even if it was one time they are then <br/>
defined as an abuser and need to be dealt with by the state? If <br/>
that&#39;s the case the state has some serious problem.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That article is one person&#39;s opinion and not the defintion of child <br/>
 </span></blockquote>abuse.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay so let me ask you this. By definition you mean the govn&#39;ts <br/>
definition.(Correct me if I am wrong) So now the govn&#39;t defines what <br/>
is right and what is wrong. And their diffinition is the only one <br/>
that is right? So they are right to say that drinking is a good <br/>
thing. Because if it were bad it would be illegal, right. That <br/>
abortion is a good thing. Because if were bad it too would be illegal <br/>
That you are monitarily responsible if a person breaks into your home <br/>
and they get hurt in the process. Because if this were the case <br/>
people would not be held accountable for incidents of this type. I am <br/>
sorry but I don&#39;t let the govn&#39;t, or anyone else for that matter, to <br/>
define my life for me. Nor do I want to define another person&#39;s life <br/>
for them. I take full responsibility for my actions and I am teaching <br/>
my children to do the same. Isn&#39;t that part of why most of us chose <br/>
to homeschool in the first place. IMO, if anyone allows another <br/>
entity to define for them what is right and what is wrong may as well <br/>
send their kids to PS because they will definately learn that there <br/>
and it would be much easier on the parents offering all that free <br/>
time. (The last part of this sentance was said with sarcasm.)<br/>

with.  However I notice you spend a lot of time defending it and <br/>
being outraged that other people think spanking is abusive. That&#39;s <br/>
life... People in this world seem to all have differing  opinions <br/>
about things and just because they don&#39;t jive with yours does not <br/>
mean they are offensive, rude or whatever you want to call it.  In my <br/>
opinion, and that&#39;s exactly the only opinion I can give, spanking is <br/>
abusive.  If you and I don&#39;t agree that&#39;s really ok with me.  I don&#39;t <br/>
need anyone else&#39;s approval of my belief system.<br/>

not look at the facts is what seems to have happened here and there <br/>
is a huge difference. I feel I have been judged based on one icedent. <br/>

The problem I had was that you stated that you hit your child until your<br/>
hand hurt.  That presents a picture of going beyond a mere spanking and<br/>
certainly far beyond a swat on the fanny.  And the only reason that one<br/>
could have for pulling down the pants and hitting the bare bottom is to<br/>
make the experience more painful.  I have no problem with someone getting a<br/>
wake-up call such as a swift swat on their sitting down end or even a<br/>
couple of swift ones with their clothing on.<br/>
<br/>
The experience of having the pants pulled down is one which creates a<br/>
feeling of defenselessness, embarassment and degredation of self-esteem.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am sure that there are other folks on the list that feel the same<br/>
as I do, children do not belong to us, they are simply put into our care<br/>
and they are not a sub species, they are simply SMALL people.  I would not<br/>
expect an adult to have their pants pulled down and get a beating,<br/>
therefore I do not do that to a child simply because they are smaller and I<br/>
have them in my power.<br/>
<br/>
But what was the real clincher were a few other statements that you made. <br/>
Namely that your hubby feels they need a switch taken to them, that now is<br/>
the time to begin using a switch (like there is some rule written that says<br/>
at a certain age we begin using objects to hit children with) and you<br/>
repeated saying that you would probably do it again.  It was the sum total<br/>
of what you did added to what you said and what you said you would still<br/>
do.<br/>

&gt; I can see that it is your opinion that it doesn&#39;t matter what the <br/>
&gt; situation was. There is absolutely no good reason for spanking your <br/>
&gt; child. I can respect that opinion and I don&#39;t agree with it. I am not <br/>
&gt; going to defend myself any further because it is pointless. I agree <br/>
&gt; to disagree, as my mother tells me. And I can accept that. No hard <br/>

&gt; &gt; You are absulutely right. It is my responsibility. I am responsible <br/>

&gt; &gt; I think Lynda was trying to say (correct me if I&#39;m wrong <br/>

&gt; running away and punishing the child for your lack of responsibility <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to make any sense... There is no judgement in that... <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s just a fact... If you are the responsible one for a situation <br/>
&gt; and something happens in that situations, then I would be apologizing <br/>
&gt; to my son for not watching him well enough that he could get away <br/>
&gt; from me, not hitting him for something that children do... They don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; understand at 4 yrs old they could get lost or someone could hurt <br/>
&gt; them...They just see things that they like and off they go, which is <br/>
&gt; why it&#39;s our job as adults to not let that happen.  But why should <br/>
&gt; your son suffer consequences for your inability to take care of him?  <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s just a thought...and one I only just thought off....It doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; make you a bad parent, just a typical reaction to the thought that <br/>
&gt; you are not perfect and chose to take an action that wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; appropriate given the situation.  Why is it so difficult to admit a <br/>
&gt; mistake.  Spanking a child because they ran away when it was the <br/>
&gt; responsibility of the adult to make sure they didn&#39;t run away doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; make any logical sense to me and it certainly wouldn&#39;t make any to a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673943095">When I work in radiology we got all the child abuse cases and I remember<br/>
three that were really bad.  I could only take it so long and quit because<br/>
I was about to go postal and take out a parent or two.<br/>
<br/>
One little girl (4 yo) looked just like Shirley Temple with all the honey<br/>
blonde curls and dimples.  That is what dimples you could see through the<br/>
bruising.  She had bruises (with finger prints) up and down her arms and<br/>
obviously punch bruises on her ribs.  The babysitter brought her in because<br/>
she was having trouble breathing.  The parents arrived a little while later<br/>
screaming that no one had the right to tell them how to care for their<br/>
child and that she had, (yeah right) fallen down the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
One little boy (18 months) came in with hypothermia because he had been<br/>
thrown through a window and left out all night on the lawn.  You see, he<br/>
cried too much.  Maybe because he had cigarette burns and pins stuck under<br/>
his little fingernails.  After counseling he was returned to his parents, 3<br/>
months later he was dead.<br/>
<br/>
The ultimate in &quot;abuse&quot; was when a father got peeved at his wife and &quot;to<br/>
teach her a lesson&quot; picked up their 12 yo daughter from school and took her<br/>
to where her mother worked.  He honked the horn and then blew up the car! <br/>
We got a body bag with pieces in it!  The mother is still<br/>
institutionalized!<br/>
<br/>
All the psych reports on these folks showed that spanking was the norm for<br/>
discipline and that they felt no one had any business telling them how to<br/>
treat their children.  It is really a scary world out there for small<br/>
people!<br/>

I&#39;m not aware of it, in WA state school teachers are allowed to spank as <br/>
discipline and they use a paddle to do so.  For that matter, if they were to <br/>
use a bare hand it would probably be considered assault.  A paddle is <br/>
standard.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, according to my SIL, who is a local city cop, even leaving marks <br/>
does not a batterer make...The standard is that the marks are considered <br/>
transient if they go away in 72 hours.  Therefore, spanking until one&#39;s hand <br/>
hurts could easily fall within legal range.<br/>

go on with life. I held him again and expressed my love for him and <br/>
let him know that there was nothing he could do to make me stop <br/>

children to this degree. And I didn&#39;t just say it in passing. I held <br/>
him until was calm and he was ready to leave. And I allowed him to <br/>
decide when he was ready to leave. That is when the ordeal was over. <br/>
Was it on his mind for some time after that? Probably. I hope it was <br/>
something that he pondered for some time. Not just the spanking but <br/>
everything that had happened. Everything that was said. What he did <br/>
and what my response was to what he did. And my expression of love to <br/>

behave worse than the most defiant child. And yes, I have see adults <br/>
and heard stories of things that adults did that yes I think some <br/>
adults do need a swift kick in the seat of the pants. I also believe <br/>
that if more parents were less afraid of CPS there would not be as <br/>
much of a discipline problem among the youth and young adults today. <br/>
I would rather see a parent discipline thier child with corproal <br/>
punishment than do nothing at all. My DH sees this every day. He is a <br/>
police officer. And he comes home and tells me of parents who say to <br/>
him, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t want to hit my child because what if CPS comes to <br/>
my house?&quot; Ya know what, the law does not state that you can&#39;t hit <br/>
your child as a form of punishment. This is dirrectly from the Texas <br/>
Penal Code SubchapterF. Special RElationships 9.61. Parent-child.<br/>
(a)The use of force, but not deadly force, against a child younger <br/>
than 18 years is justified:(1)if the actor is the child&#39;s parent or <br/>
stepparent or is acting on loco parentis to the child; and (2) when <br/>
and to the degree the actor reasonbly believes the force is necessare <br/>
to discipline the child or to safeguare or promote his welfare. (b) <br/>
For the purposes of this section, &quot;in loco parentis&quot; includes <br/>
grandparent and guardian, any person acting by, through, or under the <br/>
direction of a court with jusrisdiction over the child, and anyone <br/>
who has express or implied consent of the parent or parents. The law <br/>
does not state that you can not hit your child. It says reasonable <br/>
but not deadly force. There was no risk of death to my child and I <br/>
went further than what a lot of people would have by reasuring him of <br/>
my love and allowing him to decide when he was ready to leave the <br/>
situation. I didn&#39;t spank him and then tell him to quit crying and <br/>
to &quot;fix his face&quot; as I have seen many parents do. I allowed him to <br/>
express his emotions and when he said he was ready, then we left and <br/>
not before.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did not say I would still do this. What I did say was given the <br/>
exact same surcumstance and the situation that I was in at the time I <br/>
would make the same decission. There are also other cercumstances <br/>
that I have not revealed and I am not sure it would make a difference <br/>
but here they are. At the time DH had been an officer for about 1.5 <br/>
years. We were living in a drug and gang infested neighborhood. This <br/>
is an area that we were living in prior to DH becoming a police <br/>
officer and we were working on getting out. The mall we were at was <br/>
the nearest mall to the neighborhood although it was in a much better <br/>
town about 10 min up the freeway. However, everyone in my <br/>
neighborhood went to this mall. There were a lot of good clean honest <br/>
peopl who went to this mall and I also know that there were a lot of <br/>
scum who went to this mall because I knew who my next door neighbors <br/>
were and what type of business they were running. And most of the <br/>
people in the surrounding area were into the same business. These <br/>
were the same type of people that my husband had been arresting and <br/>
been putting behind bars for 1.5 years. And although he patrolled a <br/>
neighborhood that was a good 20-30 miles away he did run into people <br/>
from our end of town while on patrol. The people in our neighborhood <br/>
knew what he did for a living. They knew he was a police officer. And <br/>
even those who didn&#39;t know us knew because they look out for each <br/>
other. Also, It is hard to hide a police officer leaving for work in <br/>
full uniform. Do you know how many of these criminals would love to <br/>
get thier hands on the family of an officer simply because the <br/>
officer was doing his job. The threat of my son being kidnapped at <br/>
the mall that day was real. It was more real to us than to someone <br/>
who isn&#39;t in law enforcement. And maybe the person would not have <br/>
done any of the things I proposed but the threat of the danger he put <br/>
himself in was so much worse than the spanking he rescieved. It was <br/>
worse than him playing with a knife or near the hot stove. It was his <br/>
life as he deserves have it lived being turning into one of illegal <br/>
horrors that one should never have to be forced into. That is the <br/>
real threat that he faced that day. And it is a real threat. DH has <br/>
had drug dealers threaten his life on many occasions because he <br/>
caught them and then put them in jail. And a threat on anyone&#39;s life <br/>
is real, especially that of a police officer. And I still stand <br/>
behind my decission that day to spank my child in the manner that I <br/>
did. Have I spanked like that since? No. Have I spanked/swatted him <br/>
since? Yes. Will I in the future? probably. I can&#39;t predict the <br/>
future, but yes I probably will. Will I spank him to the degree that <br/>
I did that day? I again, I can&#39;t predict and speculate every <br/>
situation that can and will arise, but it is always an option.<br/>

we spanked, that was a primary rule.  No spanking out of anger.  If I was too <br/>

broken bones or showed signs of trauma over the family&#39;s discipline plan, I&#39;d <br/>
have felt differently and made an appointment with the parents and telling <br/>
them of my concerns.  Not that it matters, but the mother is a nurse.  That <br/>
puts her in a disclosure position and also means she has had formal child <br/>
abuse prevention/reporting training.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have to say it as it&#39;s on my mind... But I must assume you and<br/>
&gt; Valerie live in the backwaters of Tennessee, or some hick mountain<br/>
&gt; top in West Virginia and not in the modern world where people don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; treat their children as objects to be controlled.  Hubby just<br/>
&gt; said &quot;and these kind of people unschool?&quot;  My husband just said if he<br/>
&gt; saw someone spanking a child he&#39;d go over and intervene, whether the<br/>
&gt; other parent liked it or not, and he&#39;s actually done that once before<br/>
&gt; when someone was yanking on their child&#39;s arm when they were getting<br/>
&gt; them out of a car... I guess it&#39;s a personal preference this spanking<br/>
&gt; thing... but for the life of me I cannot see any logic in it, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; all emotion based and based on how the parent is feeling at the time,<br/>
&gt; which is rageful.  If it wasn&#39;t based on emotion a parent could make<br/>
&gt; an appointment with their child at say 5pm to be spanked and everyone<br/>
&gt; would be happy... That&#39;s never the case so therefore it must be done<br/>
&gt; out of rage... How would you like it, if you did something that I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t like and I grabbed you and spanked you?  You would be utterly<br/>
&gt; humiliated and appalled by my behavior.  So what&#39;s the difference?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I could see some logic in this whole spanking issue, then I might<br/>
&gt; agree with it... But it doesn&#39;t matter what way you say it, how you<br/>
&gt; present an argument for it, it&#39;s not logical and if it&#39;s not logical<br/>
&gt; for an adult then it&#39;s certainly doesn&#39;t make any sense to a child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again my HO and now I&#39;ll go and put on an even bigger suit of armour<br/>
&gt; and try and calm down over this issue, which I actually thought was<br/>
&gt; dead until I read this post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dawn F<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Valerie, a huge THANK YOU. Someone finally stepped in and agrees<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; me that just because I spank my children does not make me abusive.<br/>
&gt; &gt; What Valerie just described as the form of spanking she uses is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same form that I normally use. It is not abuse. A big sigh of<br/>
&gt; relief<br/>
&gt; &gt; for Valerie&#39;s post.<br/>

although it was addressed to public schools:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To me the worst thing seems to be for a school principally to work with<br/>
methods of fear, force, and artificial authority. Such treatment destroys<br/>
the sound sentiments, the sincerity, and the self-confidence of the pupil.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As to your question of &quot;so that makes it ok????&quot; That is what every <br/>
&gt; &gt; parent has the right to decide for their family what works best. Can <br/>
&gt; &gt; you imagine if the govn&#39;t started dictating what we could and <br/>
&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t do in the privacy of our homes? Which, by the way, I think <br/>
&gt; &gt; they do too much of to begin with, but that is another topic. Corallyn<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; but there are laws that state that it&#39;s wrong and illegal to hit spouses,<br/>
&gt; employees (even those employed in the privacy or our homes), or any other<br/>
&gt; adult.  Why are children, who have no choice but to be in the home they<br/>
&gt; are being raised in (as opposed to spouses who can leagally leave) be<br/>
&gt; different?  Lots of times the laws are wrong, and in the case of laws<br/>
&gt; concerning children, they are often wrong.  It&#39;s easy to overlook the<br/>
&gt; little ones who can&#39;t fight back and can&#39;t vote.<br/>

&gt;  The problem with &quot;If the child had broken bones or showed signs of trauma&quot;<br/>
&gt;  being the criteria is that most of the damage done by abuse is<br/>
&gt;  psychological and quite frequently deeply buried and doesn&#39;t manifest<br/>
&gt;  itself until much later in life.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my previous post &quot;signs of trauma&quot; is not limited to physical symptoms.  <br/>
It could have included such things as the child being &#39;too attached&#39; to one <br/>
or both parents, or avoiding the parent(s), or cringing when called or <br/>
touched, or being afraid of punishment for simple things such as spilling <br/>
milk.  <br/>
<br/>
Many times there are signs that the child or parent would not recognize, even <br/>
if confronted.  Quite often the abused child will staunchly defend the <br/>
abusive parent.  Had I seen/felt anything that told me the children in my <br/>
example were having difficulties with their parents&#39; style of discipline, I <br/>
would have spoken up.  The children are now adults and I still get no sense <br/>
of them having been traumatized by the discipline methods of their parents.<br/>
<br/>
It was/is not a style I&#39;m comfortable with and not one I adopted.  I have <br/>
talked with my oldest child.  We did use spankings with him when we could <br/>
think of nothing else.  When I have talked with him about it, I&#39;ve made a <br/>
point of listening not only with my ears, but with my heart and gut.  It has <br/>
not caused him ongoing trauma.  To decide that spanking will automatically <br/>
cause ongoing angst is simply not a given.<br/>
<br/>
Please try to keep in mind that I&#39;m coming from this with a viewpoint of <br/>
being a child abuse survivor.  Believe it or not, I&#39;m a strong advocate for <br/>
the needs of children and do lots of volunteer work with children.  I have <br/>
lots of personal experience and have done a great deal of study (some formal <br/>
and lots informally) in this area.  I abhor domestic violence.  I have <br/>
personally intervened with family members and others helping put a stop to <br/>
abusive situations in and out of my extended family.  However, I do not think <br/>
spanking is automatically battering or a form of child abuse.  Many disagree <br/>
with me. <br/>
<br/>
The big problem with trying to legislate, mandate or dictate one set of child <br/>
abuse symptoms is that we are individuals.  What affects one person one way <br/>
affects another in an entirely different way.  For example, in my opening <br/>
paragraph, every symptom listed could indicate a very troubled child.  OTOH <br/>
every symptom could equally mean a difference in personality or some innocent <br/>
need.  I think that&#39;s where CPS has run into such problems.  In order to try <br/>
to help the children that truly need help/rescuing a set of guidelines are <br/>
established which then lead to a set of rules that are adopted which then <br/>
become THE standard without any means to check whether THE standard fits this <br/>
child/family.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not picking on you, Lynda.  This just happens to be attached to your <br/>
post. Your point about psychological scars not showing up for years is very <br/>
well taken and I agree.  For that reason (and many others), it behooves each <br/>
of us as parents/caretakers to do the best job we possibly can with the <br/>
children entrusted to us.  However, there is no way for me to judge via the <br/>
internet whether someone is a good parent.  I&#39;m not willing to go there.<br/>
<br/>
IMO the tragedy of this thread is that a mother was looking for support in <br/>
reaching her husband because they had a difference of opinion concerning the <br/>
discipline methods to be used in their family.  As a mother, she felt DH was <br/>
headed in a direction which was too harsh to her tender heart and wanted help <br/>
finding a way to reach DH and help him understand her position.  <br/>
<br/>
In response, she got gut level reactions to her example only...an example she <br/>
shared with us to demonstrate the difference in expectations between herself <br/>
and DH.  <br/>
<br/>
IMO she got very little help with her actual question.  She got <br/>
(figuratively) shoved up against the wall and cornered emotionally.  How did <br/>
that help?  Now, she has to try and deal with having been called names, <br/>
&#39;informed&#39; that she and her husband are both abusive parents, with the <br/>
implication that they have no right to these children.   From there we got <br/>
geographical and parenting slurs hurled, creating lots of defensive people.  <br/>
Again, this helped how?<br/>
<br/>
IMO We&#39;ve really missed the boat here, folks.  This was a great chance to <br/>
share skills, knowledge and information with each other.  Instead it turned <br/>
into a &#39;cat fight&#39; &lt;insert apologies to all the cat lovers!&gt;  I&#39;m sure in a <br/>
day or two things will be more back to normal.  I&#39;m equally sure that a few <br/>
months down the road some innocent newbie will open this thread again (or <br/>
another with similar reactions).  I sincerely hope we can be more adult and <br/>
diplomatic in our discussions when that opportunity arrives.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614067868">How come I always come into these things when everyone&#39;s been <br/>
worked up already???  All right, I own up, I&#39;ve been involved in <br/>
one or two of these things myself, I know, but recently...  hmmm.  <br/>
Anyway, again, I find myself saying that, from a distance of a <br/>
couple of days reading through a lot of posts at once, I didn&#39;t see <br/>
anyone being disrespectful of anyone.  I found people stating their <br/>
position on corporal punishment (without being directly judgmental <br/>
about anyone who was doing it) I found people expressing their <br/>
distaste for a topic that tends towards heated debate (which, I <br/>
think (and this is one of those BIG ymmv situations, thanks to this <br/>
list for that phrase!!) is a bit &#39;off&#39; considering this is an unschooling <br/>
list, and has been pointed out, if the habits of cats are acceptable <br/>
topics, then why not &#39;my dh and I have different ways of dealing <br/>
with things and I&#39;m not comfortable with his ways?&#39;)  I saw not <br/>
very much actual response (some, but not much) to what Corallyn <br/>
was asking, which is how to respectfully talk to dh and tell him <br/>
how you feel about what&#39;s going on and work out acceptable <br/>
solutions for both of you.  Hmm.  Can anyone see any parallels <br/>
here between this topic of conversation and all those &#39;small-<br/>
person-discipline&#39; threads?  Isn&#39;t it reassuring to know that by <br/>
parenting positively, encouraging our children to use their minds, <br/>
and express themselves safely when they have a problem we <br/>
might be &#39;edjumacating&#39; a future generation of parents who <br/>
WON&#39;T have to ask each other how to deal with their spouses??? <br/>
 (ducking and running for that last one, OK!!)  I liked all the <br/>
&#39;aware-parenting&#39; stuff.  I liked the personal history of dealing <br/>
with hubby&#39;s differences.  I think if people find it necessary to use <br/>
the delete key, perhaps they don&#39;t need to tell everyone else who&#39;s <br/>
enjoying the subject.  JMO, etc etc...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;smiles!&gt;  Gladly.  I would say your&#39;s is a great example of why one can&#39;t <br/>
use this &#39;symptom&#39; as a sure sign of child abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Some abused children cling very tightly to the abusive parent.  It seems to <br/>
be a means of staying &#39;in touch&#39; so the child can avoid offending the abusive <br/>
parent.  A means of trying to be love-able enough to the parent that the <br/>
parent won&#39;t hurt them.<br/>
<br/>
Very sad when it is a symptom of child abuse.  Made even sadder, IMO, because <br/>
it is also a sign of a great parent/child relationship.  The point being that <br/>
if you can&#39;t see the action in context of the family relationship, there is <br/>
no way to know if it is &#39;normal&#39; or not.  There have been cases where <br/>
teachers or other &#39;officials&#39; have used the parental attachment as &#39;proof&#39; <br/>
that there was abuse or other inappropriate relationship between parent child.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let it scare you off from continuing to nurse your child or have them <br/>
sleep with you!  Some kids/families need more nurturing than others.  I think <br/>
it&#39;s a good thing.  Keep up the good work.<br/>
<br/>
(Oops!  there I go judging a parent via the internet.  &lt;bg&gt;)<br/>

Did that help any?  Was that what you were asking?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476002312">Dawn, I dont&#39; understand your reasoning. It can go both ways. If you <br/>
think that children should be dealt with in the same manner that we <br/>
deal with adults then that limits a parents choices of discipline to  <br/>
nothing more than reasoning. If you want to hold them to the same <br/>
standard as adults then are you going to call the police when your <br/>
children take something from another family member without asking? Or <br/>
when they hit eachother/fight? If this is the case why homeschool? <br/>
You will be allowing the govn&#39;t to raise your children anyway and you <br/>
may as well save yourself the time and send them to ps. Corallyn<br/>
