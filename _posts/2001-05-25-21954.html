<div id="ygrps-yiv-261407176">Well, I found &quot;Peel Me a Grape&quot; and was able to download a portion of it in MP3 format for Dana to listen to, she will be thrilled.  Apparently, Diana Krall has included this song in her repertoire - the only cd I have of hers is not the one where it is included(of course).<br/>
<br/>
How funny that my 5yo loves a &quot;torch song&quot;.  I think it is because when I was pregnant with her, I could only tolerate jazz or classical.  Pop, country or news radio made me quite nervous.  In fact, when she was a baby and would get fussy, all I had to do was put on some jazz and she would calm right down.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite jazz program is &quot;The Ed Love Program&quot; on NPR - maybe it is only a Detroit thing, but he is super, and plays the greatest stuff.  Not the new age, regurgitated for the demographics, but the hard nose, true jazz.  He did a simulcast of Ken Burns PBS Jazz program, and about a week later played Duke Ellington at the Newport Jazz Fest(1954?) that was out of this world.  I have it on my wish list.  Jazz gets in my soul, there is something about it I cannot describe.  Thankfully, my daughter shares my eclectic taste in music - I can&#39;t wait til she can hit some of the blues and jazz clubs here in Detroit - she would love it - but I think 5yo is a bit young&lt;g&gt;.  On Weds nights at the zoo, they have jazz programs, and in our little suburb they have free shows on weeknights in the summer that she and I adore.  We would love if Daddy came with us, but jazz is not his thing - and that is okay.<br/>
<br/>
Dana loves musicals, she knows &quot;Grease&quot; verbatim, she loves &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot; and many more that I can&#39;t think of right now.  One of my personal favorites is &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; - I better rent them soon so we can have a jazz party =)  I am so thankful we have this in common.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This sounds like my house:-) We own quite a few<br/>
musicals on video because we all love watching them so<br/>
much, even the 16mo! And when the Jazz special was on<br/>
PBS, we all watched it together, our 9yo ds LOVED<br/>
it:-)<br/>
My kids go crazy for anything with Gene Kelly or<br/>
Howard Keel in it, now I ask you, how many of todays<br/>
kids even know who these actors are?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Kirby was little (seven or so) he had been immersed in music and videos, <br/>
and I remember one day there was a kids&#39; chat for homeschoolers on AOL, and I <br/>
was typing for him--reading what the other kids were saying and transcribing <br/>
what Kirby would say.  It was cute--he would talk to the screen and I would <br/>
write it.  He wasn&#39;t talking to me directly.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked &quot;who&#39;s your favorite singer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said &quot;Julie Andrews&quot; and I typed that and hit send, while eight or nine <br/>
of the others said &quot;Amy Grant,&quot; and in Kirby said &quot;and Michael Jackson.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing on there when the flurry of responses was done but Julie <br/>
Andrews, Michael Jackson and a slew of &quot;Amy Grants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was one of those highly-illustrative moments.<br/>
<br/>
With most kids, schooled or not, when you say &quot;Who&#39;s your favorite singer&quot; <br/>
you&#39;ll get the answer which means &quot;Which famous current performer are you <br/>
most willing to identify with?&quot;  Kirby thought they actually meant which <br/>
singers do you think are the best singers.  <br/>
<br/>
I was very proud of him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I figured the other kids were limited to Christian music.<br/>
Or maybe they were copying.  Cheating!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
That&#39;s how I came to play clarinet in 5th grade.  I didn&#39;t know what <br/>
instruments were my options when I went to band signup, so I copied from the <br/>
kid next to me.  She had copied too.  The whole row of us ended up playing <br/>
clarinet! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This reminds me of myself...I transferred from a very conservative Christian <br/>
school to a public school in 5th grade. We took a survey on What is your <br/>
favorite song? The other kids wrote down whatever was at the top of the Top <br/>
40 at the time and I wrote down The Star-Spangled Banner. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s funny!!<br/>
I started out playing French Horn in 4th grade but I had to walk a <br/>
mile to and from the schoolbus and so I decided at some point to <br/>
switch to a lighter instrument. I ended up on the clarinet. Just <br/>
think, I could&#39;ve been the world&#39;s best French Horn player if we <br/>
lived closer to the road, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I think the reason I started on French Horn in the first <br/>
place was that my mom wanted me to play the clarinet. Rebellion <br/>
already! The same reason I took Latin instead of the Spanish my mom <br/>
wanted me to take. I must admit that I now wish I had gone for the <br/>
Spanish... One more reason not to mess with what your kids want to <br/>
learn. I probably would&#39;ve chosen Spanish myself without interference.<br/>

Paul, and Mary in concert, and one of them has both of<br/>
these songs on it. My kids love these too:-)<br/>
