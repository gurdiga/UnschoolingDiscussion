Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] How many of you use traditional texts.....<br/>
 someone<br/>
&gt; pointed out that some unschoolers *do* use texts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just wondering how many of you do and in what capacity......<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use texts per se, but I do use work books, computer games, etc.<br/>
Sometimes I offer the suggestion, other times they ask.<br/>

&lt;&lt; to unschool your children, and do you assign work each day or let the <br/>
 child decide when and how much? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For me and how I view unschooling, to assign work would be the kiss of death <br/>
on unschooling.  I don&#39;t want to do &quot;school at home&quot; otherwise I might as <br/>
well send him somwhere so I decided to let things flow and see what he wants <br/>
to learn.  I can measure what he&#39;s doing (if I am absolutely gripped about <br/>
judging him) by keeping a daily journal of what he&#39;s done in the day and what <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed he learned from what he&#39;s been doing.<br/>
<br/>
I have absolute faith in God (or whatever anyone wants to call &quot;it&quot;) that Zak <br/>
will be ok no matter what with the unschooling.  It&#39;s me that needs the work <br/>
done on myself to let go and have faith.  He doesn&#39;t need to be de-schooled <br/>
because he doesn&#39;t really know what it means.  He went to pre school for <br/>
about 6 months and has already forgotten that he was there.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Oh, and lastly for real-I always keep in mind that *I&#39;m* the one with the<br/>
 book addiction, not ds (although he&#39;s picking up on my affliction). I don&#39;t<br/>
 really buy texts for him.  He&#39;s just my excuse. :-) I hope he&#39;ll take an<br/>
 interest in them, just as I&#39;d hope he&#39;d take an interest in anything I enjoy<br/>
 doing, but I don&#39;t force him. (Not that I haven&#39;t tried in the past.  Boy<br/>
 did I learn my lesson! And ds was the teacher.)<br/>

can obtain more books-  It is a good thing my family is financially <br/>

 <br/>
 I am asking because in my previous post re: my 9yo ds (who is not <br/>
 motivated to do one math and one language lesson a day), someone <br/>
 pointed out that some unschoolers *do* use texts.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No I don&#39;t assign anything.  I don&#39;t say what would you like to learn today<br/>
(well maybe I might say &quot;hey this looks neat, &quot;I&quot; would like to try this <br/>
today,<br/>
do you want to do it too?&quot;--they always do or at least might say as soon<br/>
as they finish what they are currently involved in.  I seldom interrupt them<br/>
to do something different.  Just when they look like they are looking for<br/>
something).<br/>
<br/>
A text is just a book and unschoolers use books : )  As long as the child<br/>
isn&#39;t being forced to use the textbook it is just like any other book in our<br/>
library (we actually dont&#39; have any textbooks, but then again I am just not<br/>
drawn to them, I suppose if I found one cheap at a garage sale I would buy<br/>
it : )<br/>
