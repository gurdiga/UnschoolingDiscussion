<div id="ygrps-yiv-939037940">Hi, all:<br/>
<br/>
I found an excellent math site, especially for girls, but many of the <br/>
games/math exercises would be good for boys, too. Here is the link <br/>
that will take you directly to the Game and Activities portion of the <br/>
site. I&#39;m printing ALL of them off now! I can&#39;t wait to give these to <br/>
my girls and let them go at it:<br/>

Have fun!<br/>
