<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690636753">Having had many addicts in my life -<br/>
I think the difference is when it interferes with the rest of your life <br/>
and causes harm.  I can be really focused myself, but when I leave for <br/>
a week and have to go with out, I may *miss* my usual focus, but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t cripple me to be without it.<br/>
My friend who is now 15 or 16 years sober says he still feels the itch <br/>
all the time and has to work every day to stay away - not even butter <br/>
rum lifesavers for him.<br/>
<br/>
Does that give any clarification?  I know it isn&#39;t a concrete answer...<br/>
