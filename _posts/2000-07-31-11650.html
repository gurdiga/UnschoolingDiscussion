<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340519504">Dear Everybody,<br/>
<br/>
First of all, thank you so much for your sympathy and support -- it was a <br/>
relief to be listened to and the e-hugs felt good after all that emotional <br/>
battering I&#39;d been enduring. Then the thoughtful answers I received really <br/>
strengthened my resolve and made me realize that I can and should do <br/>
something about this situation.<br/>
<br/>
I am saving all the postings to re-read because there were so many great <br/>
ideas. I am going to look at trying the 3 strikes and you&#39;re out method, <br/>
which I have actually heard of before in a slightly different form. I think <br/>
I would need to find something very specific to apply this to, such as <br/>
name-calling or yelling &quot;shut up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also agree totally that when I respond in kind by yelling it just makes it <br/>
worse -- as someone put it, &quot;Suddenly you have two 5yo&#39;s in the room!&quot; I <br/>
need to be calm. For that, I need to be rested and collected, as much as <br/>
possible. I do appreciate the people who urged me to &quot;take care of myself.&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s a necessity for having patience. When I&#39;m very tired or feeling <br/>
cranky/resentful, I have no patience and quickly devolve into a 5yo!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you are all wonderful. It is so valuable to me to have a group like <br/>
this to turn to, with people of such varied backgrounds and ages. I really <br/>
took to heart the words of the mother of nine, I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t have your <br/>
name in front of me at this moment. But as someone else said, with nine <br/>
kids, you have lots of credibility and experience. Also, Kiraul and Cathie, <br/>
you seemed to have a really loving yet firm approach that I strive for <br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
I think there may also be some validity to the notion that some of this <br/>
really rank behavior has to do with the kids&#39; age and stage. I know that in <br/>
the past, sometimes when I was at wits&#39; end with something, it would <br/>
suddenly just go away, whether it was from some physical cause or, as <br/>
someone suggested, because of something going on in the kids&#39; lives.<br/>
<br/>
I really think that when the family is home as much as we are, it&#39;s easy to <br/>
slip into rudeness. But it is also imperative that we treat each other with <br/>
respect. Otherwise, I do start getting sick of having them around and can <br/>
fully understand why some people say &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand to have them home all <br/>
day.&quot; Because sometimes I can&#39;t stand it either!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Annette<br/>
