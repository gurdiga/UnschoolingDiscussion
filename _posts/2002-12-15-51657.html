<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Northern Virginia. The family is military and new to the area though. Not sure<br/>
&gt; where they came from before.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see a lot of this with military people.  They tend to be very strong on<br/>
respect of elders and the whole discipline thing.<br/>
<br/>
But, you know, if Sandra&#39;s kids speak politely to her because that&#39;s what<br/>
they hear, then it makes sense.   Let&#39;s face it, your commander or NCO<br/>
doesn&#39;t usually *ask* you to do things, with please neatly tacked onto the<br/>
end of the request!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hard for military families to do differently, because it<br/>
requires the military member to exist in 2 totally different worlds.  The<br/>
one with strict order and discipline, and the one at home with respect of<br/>
all ages, flexability and all that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m married to a truly great guy who&#39;s totally committed to unschooling and<br/>
child-led learning, and he sometimes has a hard time making the switch.  I<br/>
imagine it is really tough for people learning to change their style.<br/>
