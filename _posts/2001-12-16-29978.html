&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blame Lindh&#39;s permissive parents<br/>
&gt; By Jeff Jacoby, 12/13/2001<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IT ISN&#39;T THE CASE that the parents of John Walker Lindh - the Marin<br/>
&gt; County child of privilege turned Taliban terrorist - never drew the line<br/>
&gt; with their son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; True, they didn&#39;t do so when he was 14 and his consuming passion was<br/>
&gt; collecting hip-hop CDs with especially nasty lyrics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And true, they didn&#39;t interfere when when he announced at 16 that he was<br/>
&gt; going to drop out of Tamiscal High School - the elite &quot;alternative&quot;<br/>
&gt; school where students determined their own course of study and only saw<br/>
&gt; a teacher once a week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And granted, they didn&#39;t put their foot down when he decided to become a<br/>
&gt; Muslim after reading &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; and took to<br/>
&gt; wearing long white robes and an oversized skullcap. On the contrary: His<br/>
&gt; father was &quot;proud of John for pursuing an alternative course&quot; and his<br/>
&gt; mother told friends that it was &quot;good for a child to find a passion.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nor did they object when he began spending more and more time at a local<br/>
&gt; mosque and set about trying to memorize the Koran.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nor when he asked his parents to pay his way to Yemen so he could learn<br/>
&gt; to speak &quot;pure&quot; Arabic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nor when he headed to Pakistan to join a madrassa in a region known to<br/>
&gt; be a stronghold of Islamist extremists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And his parents didn&#39;t balk when he went to fight in Afghanistan - but<br/>
&gt; that, at least, they didn&#39;t know about: He hadn&#39;t told them. Perhaps he<br/>
&gt; had learned to take their consent for granted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Only once, it seems, did Frank Lindh and Marilyn Walker actually deny<br/>
&gt; their son something he wanted. When he first adopted Islam and took the<br/>
&gt; name Sule yman, they refused to use it and insisted on calling him John.<br/>
&gt; After all, he had been named for one of the giants of our time: John<br/>
&gt; Lennon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Their refusal must have amazed him. For as long as he could remember,<br/>
&gt; his oh-so-progressive parents had answered &quot;yes&quot; to his every whim,<br/>
&gt; indulged his every fancy, permitted - even praised - his every passion.<br/>
&gt; The only thing they insisted on was that nothing be insisted on. Nothing<br/>
&gt; in his life was important enough for them to make an issue of: not his<br/>
&gt; schooling, not his religion, not his appearance, not even whether he<br/>
&gt; stayed in America or moved - while still a minor - to a benighted Third<br/>
&gt; World oligarchy halfway around the world. Nothing. Except, of course,<br/>
&gt; their right to call him by the name of their favorite Beatle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Devout practitioners of the self-obsessed nonjudgmentalism for which the<br/>
&gt; Bay Area is renowned, Lindh and Walker appear never to have rebuked<br/>
&gt; their son or criticized his choices. In their world, there were no<br/>
&gt; absolutes, no fixed truths, no mandatory behavior, no thou-shalt-nots.<br/>
&gt; If they had one conviction, it was that all convictions are worthy -<br/>
&gt; that nothing is intolerable except intolerance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But even in Marin County, there are times when children need to hear<br/>
&gt; &quot;no&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t.&quot; They need to know that there are limits they must<br/>
&gt; respect and expectations they must try to live up to. If they cannot<br/>
&gt; find those limits at home, they are apt to look for them elsewhere.<br/>
&gt; Newsweek calls it &quot;truly perplexing&quot; that John Lindh, who &quot;grew up in<br/>
&gt; possibly the most liberal, tolerant place in America ... was drawn to<br/>
&gt; the most illiberal, intolerant sect in Islam.&quot; There is nothing<br/>
&gt; perplexing about it. He craved standards and discipline. Mom and Dad<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t offer any. The Taliban did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even when it was clear that their son was sinking into Islamist<br/>
&gt; fanaticism, they wouldn&#39;t pull back on the reins. When Osama bin Laden&#39;s<br/>
&gt; terrorists bombed the USS Cole and killed 17 American servicemen, John<br/>
&gt; Lindh e-mailed his father that the attack had been justified, since by<br/>
&gt; docking the ship in Yemen, the United States had committed &quot;an act of<br/>
&gt; war.&quot; Frank Lindh now says that the message &quot;raised my concerns&quot; - but<br/>
&gt; that didn&#39;t stop him from wiring his son another $1,200. After all, says<br/>
&gt; Dad, &quot;my days of molding him were over.&quot; It isn&#39;t clear that they ever<br/>
&gt; began.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It came as a jolt to his parents when John Lindh turned up at the<br/>
&gt; fortress near Mazar-e-Sharif, sporting an AK-47 and calling himself<br/>
&gt; Abdul Hamid. But the revelation that their son had enlisted in Al Qaeda<br/>
&gt; and supported the Sept. 11 attacks brought no words of reproach to their<br/>
&gt; lips.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; John Lindh deserved &quot;a little kick in the butt&quot; for keeping them in the<br/>
&gt; dark about his plans, his father said, but otherwise they just wanted to<br/>
&gt; &quot;give him a big hug.&quot; His mother, meanwhile, was quite sure that &quot;if he<br/>
&gt; got involved with the Taliban he must have been brainwashed.... When<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re young and impressionable, it&#39;s easy to be led by charismatic<br/>
&gt; people.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, it is, and it&#39;s a pity that that didn&#39;t occur to her sooner. If she<br/>
&gt; and Frank Lindh had been less concerned with flaunting their<br/>
&gt; open-mindedness and more concerned with developing their son&#39;s moral<br/>
&gt; judgment, he wouldn&#39;t be where he is today. His road to treason and<br/>
&gt; jihad didn&#39;t begin in Afghanistan. It began in Marin County, with<br/>
&gt; parents who never said &quot;no.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>

This is exactly what so many in PS need to hear today.  This IS what brought about the whole problem in the U.S.A. today, and in fact, the whole world.  Maybe that is also what led bin Laden into his role.  He got too much money and power and not enough guidance.<br/>

say that maybe the son was reacting to morals. Morals that *maybe* he <br/>
feels the US and its horrific foreign policy has brought upon itself. <br/>
(This is NOT to take away from the pain that has happened)<br/>
<br/>
Is is not the secure child that fights for what they feel is right, right <br/>
down to the moral fabric of their being. NOT to be brainwashed by a <br/>
superpower that brainwashes its citizens by not telling them of their <br/>
covert actions and consequences over the years?<br/>
<br/>
This American Taliban fighter probably has more morals, sense of right <br/>
from wrong and knowlege of the USA&#39;s foregin policys than most of the <br/>
American people.<br/>
<br/>
I commend his ferver to fight for what he sees as right. As opposed to <br/>
condem the parents for giving him the will to stick up for his beleifs.<br/>
<br/>
Let me end this with Noam Chomsky&#39;s speech at MIT. It may clear up my <br/>

<br/>
Everyone knows it&#39;s the TV people who run the world [crowd laugher]. I <br/>
just<br/>
got orders that I&#39;m supposed to be here, not there. Well the last talk I<br/>
gave at this forum was on a light pleasant topic. It was about how humans<br/>
are an endangered species and given the nature of their institutions they<br/>
are likely to destroy themselves in a fairly short time. So this time <br/>
there<br/>
is a little relief and we have a pleasant topic instead, the new war on<br/>
terror. Unfortunately, the world keeps coming up with things that make it<br/>
more and more horrible as we proceed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to assume 2 conditions for this talk.<br/>
<br/>
The first one is just what I assume to be recognition of fact. That is <br/>
that<br/>
the events of September 11 were a horrendous atrocity probably the most<br/>
devastating instant human toll of any crime in history, outside of war. <br/>
The<br/>
second assumption has to do with the goals. I&#39;m assuming that our goal is<br/>
that we are interested in reducing the likelihood of such crimes whether<br/>
they are against us or against someone else. If you don&#39;t accept those two<br/>
assumptions, then what I say will not be addressed to you. If we do accept<br/>
them, then a number of questions arise, closely related ones, which merit <br/>
a<br/>
good deal of thought.<br/>
<br/>
One question, and by far the most important one is what is happening right<br/>
now? Implicit in that is what can we do about it? The 2nd has to do with <br/>
the<br/>
very common assumption that what happened on September 11 is a historic<br/>
event, one which will change history. I tend to agree with that. I think<br/>
it&#39;s true. It was a historic event and the question we should be asking is<br/>
exactly why? The 3rd question has to do with the title, The War Against<br/>
Terrorism. Exactly what is it? And there is a related question, namely <br/>
what<br/>
is terrorism? The 4th question which is narrower but important has to do<br/>
with the origins of the crimes of September 11th. And the 5th question <br/>
that<br/>
I want to talk a little about is what policy options there are in fighting<br/>
this war against terrorism and dealing with the situations that led to it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll say a few things about each. Glad to go beyond in discussion and <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
hesitate to bring up other questions. These are ones that come to my mind <br/>
as<br/>
prominent but you may easily and plausibly have other choices.<br/>
<br/>
Well let&#39;s start with right now. I&#39;ll talk about the situation in<br/>
Afghanistan. I&#39;ll just keep to uncontroversial sources like the New York<br/>
Times [crowd laughter]. According to the New York Times there are 7 to 8<br/>
million people in Afghanistan on the verge of starvation. That was true<br/>
actually before September 11th. They were surviving on international aid. <br/>
On<br/>
September 16th, the Times reported, I&#39;m quoting it, that the United States<br/>
demanded from Pakistan the elimination of truck convoys that provide much <br/>
of<br/>
the food and other supplies to Afghanistan&#39;s civilian population. As far <br/>
as<br/>
I could determine there was no reaction in the United States or for that<br/>
matter in Europe. I was on national radio all over Europe the next day.<br/>
There was no reaction in the United States or in Europe to my knowledge to<br/>
the demand to impose massive starvation on millions of people. The threat <br/>
of<br/>
military strikes right after September.....around that time forced the<br/>
removal of international aid workers that crippled the assistance <br/>
programs.<br/>
Actually, I am quoting again from the New York Times. Refugees reaching<br/>
Pakistan after arduous journeys from AF are describing scenes of <br/>
desperation<br/>
and fear at home as the threat of American led military attacks turns <br/>
their<br/>
long running misery into a potential catastrophe. The country was on a<br/>
lifeline and we just cut the line. Quoting an evacuated aid worker, in the<br/>
New York Times Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
The World Food Program, the UN program, which is the main one by far, were<br/>
able to resume after 3 weeks in early October, they began to resume at a<br/>
lower level, resume food shipments. They don&#39;t have international aid<br/>
workers within, so the distribution system is hampered. That was suspended<br/>
as soon as the bombing began. They then resumed but at a lower pace while<br/>
aid agencies leveled scathing condemnations of US airdrops, condemning <br/>
them<br/>
as propaganda tools which are probably doing more harm than good. That<br/>
happens to be quoting the London Financial Times but it is easy to <br/>
continue.<br/>
After the first week of bombing, the New York Times reported on a back <br/>
page<br/>
inside a column on something else, that by the arithmetic of the United<br/>
Nations there will soon be 7.5 million Afghans in acute need of even a <br/>
loaf<br/>
of bread and there are only a few weeks left before the harsh winter will<br/>
make deliveries to many areas totally impossible, continuing to quote, but<br/>
with bombs falling the delivery rate is down to * of what is needed. <br/>
Casual<br/>
comment. Which tells us that Western civilization is anticipating the<br/>
slaughter of, well do the arithmetic, 3-4 million people or something like<br/>
that. On the same day, the leader of Western civilization dismissed with<br/>
contempt, once again, offers of negotiation for delivery of the alleged<br/>
target, Osama bin Laden, and a request for some evidence to substantiate <br/>
the<br/>
demand for total capitulation. It was dismissed. On the same day the <br/>
Special<br/>
Rapporteur of the UN in charge of food pleaded with the United States to<br/>
stop the bombing to try to save millions of victims. As far as I&#39;m aware<br/>
that was unreported. That was Monday. Yesterday the major aid agencies <br/>
OXFAM<br/>
and Christian Aid and others joined in that plea. You can&#39;t find a report <br/>
in<br/>
the New York Times. There was a line in the Boston Globe, hidden in a <br/>
story<br/>
about another topic, Kashmir.<br/>
<br/>
Well we could easily go on....but all of that....first of all indicates to<br/>
us what&#39;s happening. Looks like what&#39;s happening is some sort of silent<br/>
genocide. It also gives a good deal of insight into the elite culture, the<br/>
culture that we are part of. It indicates that whatever, what will happen <br/>
we<br/>
don&#39;t know, but plans are being made and programs implemented on the<br/>
assumption that they may lead to the death of several million people in <br/>
the<br/>
next couple of weeks....very casually with no comment, no particular <br/>
thought<br/>
about it, that&#39;s just kind of normal, here and in a good part of Europe. <br/>
Not<br/>
in the rest of the world. In fact not even in much of Europe. So if you <br/>
read<br/>
the Irish press or the press in Scotland...that close, reactions are very<br/>
different. Well that&#39;s what&#39;s happening now. What&#39;s happening now is very<br/>
much under our control. We can do a lot to affect what&#39;s happening. And<br/>
that&#39;s roughly it.<br/>
<br/>
Alright let&#39;s turn to the slightly more abstract question, forgetting for<br/>
the moment that we are in the midst of apparently trying to murder 3 or 4<br/>
million people, not Taliban of course, their victims. Let&#39;s go back...turn<br/>
to the question of the historic event that took place on September 11th. <br/>
As<br/>
I said, I think that&#39;s correct. It was a historic event. Not unfortunately<br/>
because of its scale, unpleasant to think about, but in terms of the scale<br/>
it&#39;s not that unusual. I did say it&#39;s the worst...probably the worst <br/>
instant<br/>
human toll of any crime. And that may be true. But there are terrorist<br/>
crimes with effects a bit more drawn out that are more extreme,<br/>
unfortunately. Nevertheless, it&#39;s a historic event because there was a<br/>
change. The change was the direction in which the guns were pointed. <br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
new. Radically new. So, take US history.<br/>
<br/>
The last time that the national territory of the United States was under<br/>
attack, or for that matter, even threatened was when the British burned <br/>
down<br/>
Washington in 1814. There have been many...it was common to bring up Pearl<br/>
Harbor but that&#39;s not a good analogy. The Japanese, what ever you think<br/>
about it, the Japanese bombed military bases in 2 US colonies not the<br/>
national territory; colonies which had been taken from their inhabitants <br/>
in<br/>
not a very pretty way. This is the national territory that&#39;s been attacked<br/>
on a large scale, you can find a few fringe examples but this is unique.<br/>
<br/>
During these close to 200 years, we, the United States expelled or mostly<br/>
exterminated the indigenous population, that&#39;s many millions of people,<br/>
conquered half of Mexico, carried out depredations all over the region,<br/>
Caribbean and Central America, sometimes beyond, conquered Hawaii and the<br/>
Philippines, killing several 100,000 Filipinos in the process. Since the<br/>
Second World War, it has extended its reach around the world in ways I <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
have to describe. But it was always killing someone else, the fighting was<br/>
somewhere else, it was others who were getting slaughtered. Not here. Not<br/>
the national territory.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Europe, the change is even more dramatic because its <br/>
history<br/>
is even more horrendous than ours. We are an offshoot of Europe, <br/>
basically.<br/>
For hundreds of years, Europe has been casually slaughtering people all <br/>
over<br/>
the world. That&#39;s how they conquered the world, not by handing out candy <br/>
to<br/>
babies. During this period, Europe did suffer murderous wars, but that was<br/>
European killers murdering one another. The main sport of Europe for<br/>
hundreds of years was slaughtering one another. The only reason that it <br/>
came<br/>
to an end in 1945, was....it had nothing to do with Democracy or not <br/>
making<br/>
war with each other and other fashionable notions. It had to do with the<br/>
fact that everyone understood that the next time they play the game it was<br/>
going to be the end for the world. Because the Europeans, including us, <br/>
had<br/>
developed such massive weapons of destruction that that game just have to <br/>
be<br/>
over. And it goes back hundreds of years. In the 17th century, about<br/>
probably 40% of the entire population of Germany was wiped out in one war.<br/>
<br/>
But during this whole bloody murderous period, it was Europeans <br/>
slaughtering<br/>
each other, and Europeans slaughtering people elsewhere. The Congo didn&#39;t<br/>
attack Belgium, India didn&#39;t attack England, Algeria didn&#39;t attack France.<br/>
It&#39;s uniform. There are again small exceptions, but pretty small in scale,<br/>
certainly invisible in the scale of what Europe and us were doing to the<br/>
rest of the world. This is the first change. The first time that the guns<br/>
have been pointed the other way. And in my opinion that&#39;s probably why you<br/>
see such different reactions on the two sides of the Irish Sea which I <br/>
have<br/>
noticed, incidentally, in many interviews on both sides, national radio on<br/>
both sides. The world looks very different depending on whether you are<br/>
holding the lash or whether you are being whipped by it for hundreds of<br/>
years, very different. So I think the shock and surprise in Europe and its<br/>
offshoots, like here, is very understandable. It is a historic event but<br/>
regrettably not in scale, in something else and a reason why the rest of <br/>
the<br/>
world...most of the rest of the world looks at it quite differently. Not<br/>
lacking sympathy for the victims of the atrocity or being horrified by <br/>
them,<br/>
that&#39;s almost uniform, but viewing it from a different perspective.<br/>
Something we might want to understand.<br/>
<br/>
Well, let&#39;s go to the third question, &#39;What is the war against terrorism?&#39;<br/>
and a side question, &#39;What&#39;s terrorism?&#39;. The war against terrorism has <br/>
been<br/>
described in high places as a struggle against a plague, a cancer which is<br/>
spread by barbarians, by &quot;depraved opponents of civilization itself.&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
a feeling that I share. The words I&#39;m quoting, however, happen to be from <br/>
20<br/>
years ago. Those are...that&#39;s President Reagan and his Secretary of State.<br/>
The Reagan administration came into office 20 years ago declaring that the<br/>
war against international terrorism would be the core of our foreign<br/>
policy....describing it in terms of the kind I just mentioned and others.<br/>
And it was the core of our foreign policy. The Reagan administration<br/>
responded to this plague spread by depraved opponents of civilization <br/>
itself<br/>
by creating an extraordinary international terrorist network, totally<br/>
unprecedented in scale, which carried out massive atrocities all over the<br/>
world, primarily....well, partly nearby, but not only there. I won&#39;t run<br/>
through the record, you&#39;re all educated people, so I&#39;m sure you learned<br/>
about it in High School. [crowd laughter]<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll just mention one case which is totally uncontroversial, so we <br/>
might<br/>
as well not argue about it, by no means the most extreme but<br/>
uncontroversial. It&#39;s uncontroversial because of the judgments of the<br/>
highest international authorities the International Court of Justice, the<br/>
World Court, and the UN Security Council. So this one is uncontroversial, <br/>
at<br/>
least among people who have some minimal concern for international law,<br/>
human rights, justice and other things like that. And now I&#39;ll leave you <br/>
an<br/>
exercise. You can estimate the size of that category by simply asking how<br/>
often this uncontroversial case has been mentioned in the commentary of <br/>
the<br/>
last month. And it&#39;s a particularly relevant one, not only because it is<br/>
uncontroversial, but because it does offer a precedent as to how a law<br/>
abiding state would respond to...did respond in fact to international<br/>
terrorism, which is uncontroversial. And was even more extreme than the<br/>
events of September 11th. I&#39;m talking about the Reagan-US war against<br/>
Nicaragua which left tens of thousands of people dead, the country ruined,<br/>
perhaps beyond recovery.<br/>
<br/>
Nicaragua did respond. They didn&#39;t respond by setting off bombs in<br/>
Washington. They responded by taking it to the World Court, presenting a<br/>
case, they had no problem putting together evidence. The World Court<br/>
accepted their case, ruled in their favor, ordered the...condemned what <br/>
they<br/>
called the &quot;unlawful use of force,&quot; which is another word for <br/>
international<br/>
terrorism, by the United States, ordered the United States to terminate <br/>
the<br/>
crime and to pay massive reparations. The United States, of course,<br/>
dismissed the court judgment with total contempt and announced that it <br/>
would<br/>
not accept the jurisdiction of the court henceforth. Then Nicaragua then<br/>
went to the UN Security Council which considered a resolution calling on <br/>
all<br/>
states to observe international law. No one was mentioned but everyone<br/>
understood. The United States vetoed the resolution. It now stands as the<br/>
only state on record which has both been condemned by the World Court for<br/>
international terrorism and has vetoed a Security Council resolution <br/>
calling<br/>
on states to observe international law. Nicaragua then went to the General<br/>
Assembly where there is technically no veto but a negative US vote amounts<br/>
to a veto. It passed a similar resolution with only the United States,<br/>
Israel, and El Salvador opposed. The following year again, this time the<br/>
United States could only rally Israel to the cause, so 2 votes opposed to<br/>
observing international law. At that point, Nicaragua couldn&#39;t do anything<br/>
lawful. It tried all the measures. They don&#39;t work in a world that is <br/>
ruled<br/>
by force.<br/>
<br/>
This case is uncontroversial but it&#39;s by no means the most extreme. We <br/>
gain<br/>
a lot of insight into our own culture and society and what&#39;s happening now<br/>
by asking &#39;how much we know about all this? How much we talk about it? How<br/>
much you learn about it in school? How much it&#39;s all over the front <br/>
pages?&#39;<br/>
And this is only the beginning. The United States responded to the World<br/>
Court and the Security Council by immediately escalating the war very<br/>
quickly, that was a bipartisan decision incidentally. The terms of the war<br/>
were also changed. For the first time there were official orders<br/>
given...official orders to the terrorist army to attack what are called<br/>
&quot;soft targets,&quot; meaning undefended civilian targets, and to keep away from<br/>
the Nicaraguan army. They were able to do that because the United States <br/>
had<br/>
total control of the air over Nicaragua and the mercenary army was <br/>
supplied<br/>
with advanced communication equipment, it wasn&#39;t a guerilla army in the<br/>
normal sense and could get instructions about the disposition of the<br/>
Nicaraguan army forces so they could attack agricultural collectives, <br/>
health<br/>
clinics, and so on...soft targets with impunity. Those were the official<br/>
orders.<br/>
<br/>
What was the reaction? It was known. There was a reaction to it. The <br/>
policy<br/>
was regarded as sensible by left liberal opinion. So Michael Kinsley who<br/>
represents the left in mainstream discussion, wrote an article in which he<br/>
said that we shouldn&#39;t be too quick to criticize this policy as Human <br/>
Rights<br/>
Watch had just done. He said a &quot;sensible policy&quot; must &quot;meet the test of <br/>
cost<br/>
benefit analysis&quot; -- that is, I&#39;m quoting now, that is the analysis of <br/>
&quot;the<br/>
amount of blood and misery that will be poured in, and the likelihood that<br/>
democracy will emerge at the other end.&quot; Democracy as the US understands <br/>
the<br/>
term, which is graphically illustrated in the surrounding countries. <br/>
Notice<br/>
that it is axiomatic that the United States, US elites, have the right to<br/>
conduct the analysis and to pursue the project if it passes their tests. <br/>
And<br/>
it did pass their tests. It worked. When Nicaragua finally succumbed to<br/>
superpower assault, commentators openly and cheerfully lauded the success <br/>
of<br/>
the methods that were adopted and described them accurately. So I&#39;ll quote<br/>
Time Magazine just to pick one. They lauded the success of the methods<br/>
adopted: &quot;to wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war<br/>
until the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government themselves,&quot;<br/>
with a cost to us that is &quot;minimal,&quot; and leaving the victims &quot;with wrecked<br/>
bridges, sabotaged power stations, and ruined farms,&quot; and thus providing <br/>
the<br/>
US candidate with a &quot;winning issue&quot;: &quot;ending the impoverishment of the<br/>
people of Nicaragua.&quot; The New York Times had a headline saying &quot;Americans<br/>
United in Joy&quot; at this outcome.<br/>
<br/>
That is the culture in which we live and it reveals several facts. One is<br/>
the fact that terrorism works. It doesn&#39;t fail. It works. Violence usually<br/>
works. That&#39;s world history. Secondly, it&#39;s a very serious analytic error <br/>
to<br/>
say, as is commonly done, that terrorism is the weapon of the weak. Like<br/>
other means of violence, it&#39;s primarily a weapon of the strong,<br/>
overwhelmingly, in fact. It is held to be a weapon of the weak because the<br/>
strong also control the doctrinal systems and their terror doesn&#39;t count <br/>
as<br/>
terror. Now that&#39;s close to universal. I can&#39;t think of a historical<br/>
exception, even the worst mass murderers view the world that way. So pick<br/>
the Nazis. They weren&#39;t carrying out terror in occupied Europe. They were<br/>
protecting the local population from the terrorisms of the partisans. And<br/>
like other resistance movements, there was terrorism. The Nazis were<br/>
carrying out counter terror. Furthermore, the United States essentially<br/>
agreed with that. After the war, the US army did extensive studies of Nazi<br/>
counter terror operations in Europe. First I should say that the US picked<br/>
them up and began carrying them out itself, often against the same <br/>
targets,<br/>
the former resistance. But the military also studied the Nazi methods<br/>
published interesting studies, sometimes critical of them because they <br/>
were<br/>
inefficiently carried out, so a critical analysis, you didn&#39;t do this <br/>
right,<br/>
you did that right, but those methods with the advice of Wermacht officers<br/>
who were brought over here became the manuals of counter insurgency, of<br/>
counter terror, of low intensity conflict, as it is called, and are the<br/>
manuals, and are the procedures that are being used. So it&#39;s not just that<br/>
the Nazis did it. It&#39;s that it was regarded as the right thing to do by <br/>
the<br/>
leaders of western civilization, that is us, who then proceeded to do it<br/>
themselves. Terrorism is not the weapon of the weak. It is the weapon of<br/>
those who are against &#39;us&#39; whoever &#39;us&#39; happens to be. And if you can <br/>
find a<br/>
historical exception to that, I&#39;d be interested in seeing it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, an interesting indication of the nature of our culture, our high<br/>
culture, is the way in which all of this is regarded. One way it&#39;s <br/>
regarded<br/>
is just suppressing it. So almost nobody has ever heard of it. And the <br/>
power<br/>
of American propaganda and doctrine is so strong that even among the <br/>
victims<br/>
it&#39;s barely known. I mean, when you talk about this to people in <br/>
Argentina,<br/>
you have to remind them. Oh, yeah, that happened, we forgot about it. It&#39;s<br/>
deeply suppressed. The sheer consequences of the monopoly of violence can <br/>
be<br/>
very powerful in ideological and other terms.<br/>
<br/>
Well, one illuminating aspect of our own attitude toward terrorism is the<br/>
reaction to the idea that Nicaragua might have the right to defend itself.<br/>
Actually I went through this in some detail with database searches and <br/>
that<br/>
sort of thing. The idea that Nicaragua might have the right to defend <br/>
itself<br/>
was considered outrageous. There is virtually nothing in mainstream<br/>
commentary indicating that Nicaragua might have that right. And that fact<br/>
was exploited by the Reagan administration and its propaganda in an<br/>
interesting way. Those of you who were around in that time will remember<br/>
that they periodically floated rumors that the Nicaraguans were getting <br/>
MIG<br/>
jets, jets from Russia. At that point the hawks and the doves split. The<br/>
hawks said, &#39;ok, let&#39;s bomb &#39;em.&#39; The doves said, `wait a minute, let&#39;s <br/>
see<br/>
if the rumors are true. And if the rumors are true, then let&#39;s bomb them.<br/>
Because they are a threat to the United States.&#39; Why, incidentally were <br/>
they<br/>
getting MIGs. Well they tried to get jet planes from European countries <br/>
but<br/>
the United States put pressure on its allies so that it wouldn&#39;t send them<br/>
means of defense because they wanted them to turn to the Russians. That&#39;s<br/>
good for propaganda purposes. Then they become a threat to us. Remember,<br/>
they were just 2 days march from Harlingen, Texas. We actually declared a<br/>
national emergency in 1985 to protect the country from the threat of<br/>
Nicaragua. And it stayed in force. So it was much better for them to get<br/>
arms from the Russians. Why would they want jet planes? Well, for the<br/>
reasons I already mentioned. The United States had total control over <br/>
their<br/>
airspace, was over flying it and using that to provide instructions to the<br/>
terrorist army to enable them to attack soft targets without running into<br/>
the army that might defend them. Everyone knew that that was the reason.<br/>
They are not going to use their jet planes for anything else. But the idea<br/>
that Nicaragua should be permitted to defend its airspace against a<br/>
superpower attack that is directing terrorist forces to attack undefended<br/>
civilian targets, that was considered in the United States as outrageous <br/>
and<br/>
uniformly so. Exceptions are so slight, you know I can practically list<br/>
them. I don&#39;t suggest that you take my word for this. Have a look. That<br/>
includes our own senators, incidentally.<br/>
<br/>
Another illustration of how we regard terrorism is happening right now. <br/>
The<br/>
US has just appointed an ambassador to the United Nations to lead the war<br/>
against terrorism a couple weeks ago. Who is he? Well, his name is John<br/>
Negroponte. He was the US ambassador in the fiefdom, which is what it is, <br/>
of<br/>
Honduras in the early 1980&#39;s. There was a little fuss made about the fact<br/>
that he must have been aware, as he certainly was, of the large-scale<br/>
murders and other atrocities that were being carried out by the security<br/>
forces in Honduras that we were supporting. But that&#39;s a small part of it.<br/>
As proconsul of Honduras, as he was called there, he was the local<br/>
supervisor for the terrorist war based in Honduras, for which his <br/>
government<br/>
was condemned by the world court and then the Security Council in a vetoed<br/>
resolution. And he was just appointed as the UN Ambassador to lead the war<br/>
against terror. Another small experiment you can do is check and see what<br/>
the reaction was to this. Well, I will tell you what you are going to <br/>
find,<br/>
but find it for yourself. Now that tells us a lot about the war against<br/>
terrorism and a lot about ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
After the United States took over the country again under the conditions<br/>
that were so graphically described by the press, the country was pretty <br/>
much<br/>
destroyed in the 1980&#39;s, but it has totally collapsed since in every <br/>
respect<br/>
just about. Economically it has declined sharply since the US take over,<br/>
democratically and in every other respect. It&#39;s now the second poorest<br/>
country in the Hemisphere. I should say....I&#39;m not going to talk about it,<br/>
but I mentioned that I picked up Nicaragua because it is an <br/>
uncontroversial<br/>
case. If you look at the other states in the region, the state terror was<br/>
far more extreme and it again traces back to Washington and that&#39;s by no<br/>
means all.<br/>
<br/>
It was happening elsewhere in the world too, take say Africa. During the<br/>
Reagan years alone, South African attacks, backed by the United States and<br/>
Britain, US/UK-backed South African attacks against the neighboring<br/>
countries killed about a million and a half people and left 60 billion<br/>
dollars in damage and countries destroyed. And if we go around the world, <br/>
we<br/>
can add more examples.<br/>
<br/>
Now that was the first war against terror of which I&#39;ve given a small<br/>
sample. Are we supposed to pay attention to that? Or kind of think that <br/>
that<br/>
might be relevant? After all it&#39;s not exactly ancient history. Well,<br/>
evidently not as you can tell by looking at the current discussion of the<br/>
war on terror which has been the leading topic for the last month.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned that Nicaragua has now become the 2nd poorest country in the<br/>
hemisphere. What&#39;s the poorest country? Well that&#39;s of course Haiti which<br/>
also happens to be the victim of most US intervention in the 20th century <br/>
by<br/>
a long shot. We left it totally devastated. It&#39;s the poorest country.<br/>
Nicaragua is second ranked in degree of US intervention in the 20th <br/>
century.<br/>
It is the 2nd poorest. Actually, it is vying with Guatemala. They<br/>
interchange every year or two as to who&#39;s the second poorest. And they <br/>
also<br/>
vie as to who is the leading target of US military intervention. We&#39;re<br/>
supposed to think that all of this is some sort of accident. That is has<br/>
nothing to do with anything that happened in history. Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
The worst human rights violator in the 1990&#39;s is Colombia, by a long shot.<br/>
It&#39;s also the, by far, the leading recipient of US military aid in the<br/>
1990&#39;s maintaining the terror and human rights violations. In 1999, <br/>
Colombia<br/>
replaced Turkey as the leading recipient of US arms worldwide, that is<br/>
excluding Israel and Egypt which are a separate category. And that tells <br/>
us<br/>
a lot more about the war on terror right now, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
Why was Turkey getting such a huge flow of US arms? Well if you take a <br/>
look<br/>
at the flow of US arms to Turkey, Turkey always got a lot of US arms. It&#39;s<br/>
strategically placed, a member of NATO, and so on. But the arms flow to<br/>
Turkey went up very sharply in 1984. It didn&#39;t have anything to do with <br/>
the<br/>
cold war. I mean Russian was collapsing. And it stayed high from 1984 to<br/>
1999 when it reduced and it was replaced in the lead by Colombia. What<br/>
happened from 1984 to 1999? Well, in 1984, [Turkey] launched a major<br/>
terrorist war against Kurds in southeastern Turkey. And that&#39;s when US aid<br/>
went up, military aid. And this was not pistols. This was jet planes, <br/>
tanks,<br/>
military training, and so on. And it stayed high as the atrocities <br/>
escalated<br/>
through the 1990&#39;s. Aid followed it. The peak year was 1997. In 1997, US<br/>
military aid to Turkey was more than in the entire period 1950 to 1983, <br/>
that<br/>
is the cold war period, which is an indication of how much the cold war <br/>
has<br/>
affected policy. And the results were awesome. This led to 2-3 million<br/>
refugees. Some of the worst ethnic cleansing of the late 1990&#39;s. Tens of<br/>
thousands of people killed, 3500 towns and villages destroyed, way more <br/>
than<br/>
Kosovo, even under NATO bombs. And the United States was providing 80% of<br/>
the arms, increasing as the atrocities increased, peaking in 1997. It<br/>
declined in 1999 because, once again, terror worked as it usually does <br/>
when<br/>
carried out by its major agents, mainly the powerful. So by 1999, Turkish<br/>
terror, called of course counter-terror, but as I said, that&#39;s universal, <br/>
it<br/>
worked. Therefore Turkey was replaced by Colombia which had not yet<br/>
succeeded in its terrorist war. And therefore had to move into first place<br/>
as recipient of US arms.<br/>
<br/>
Well, what makes this all particularly striking is that all of this was<br/>
taking place right in the midst of a huge flood of self-congratulation on<br/>
the part of Western intellectuals which probably has no counterpart in<br/>
history. I mean you all remember it. It was just a couple years ago. <br/>
Massive<br/>
self-adulation about how for the first time in history we are so<br/>
magnificent; that we are standing up for principles and values; dedicated <br/>
to<br/>
ending inhumanity everywhere in the new era of this-and-that, and<br/>
so-on-and-so-forth. And we certainly can&#39;t tolerate atrocities right near<br/>
the borders of NATO. That was repeated over and over. Only within the<br/>
borders of NATO where we can not only can tolerate much worse atrocities <br/>
but<br/>
contribute to them. Another insight into Western civilization and our own,<br/>
is how often was this brought up? Try to look. I won&#39;t repeat it. But it&#39;s<br/>
instructive. It&#39;s a pretty impressive feat for a propaganda system to <br/>
carry<br/>
this off in a free society. It&#39;s pretty amazing. I don&#39;t think you could <br/>
do<br/>
this in a totalitarian state.<br/>
<br/>
And Turkey is very grateful. Just a few days ago, Prime Minister Ecevit<br/>
announced that Turkey would join the coalition against terror, very<br/>
enthusiastically, even more so than others. In fact, he said they would<br/>
contribute troops which others have not willing to do. And he explained <br/>
why.<br/>
He said, We owe a debt of gratitude to the United States because the <br/>
United<br/>
States was the only country that was willing to contribute so massively to<br/>
our own, in his words &quot;counter-terrorist&quot; war, that is to our own massive<br/>
ethnic cleansing and atrocities and terror. Other countries helped a <br/>
little,<br/>
but they stayed back. The United States, on the other hand, contributed<br/>
enthusiastically and decisively and was able to do so because of the<br/>
silence, servility might be the right word, of the educated classes who<br/>
could easily find out about it. It&#39;s a free country after all. You can <br/>
read<br/>
human rights reports. You can read all sorts of stuff. But we chose to<br/>
contribute to the atrocities and Turkey is very happy, they owe us a debt <br/>
of<br/>
gratitude for that and therefore will contribute troops just as during the<br/>
war in Serbia. Turkey was very much praised for using its F-16&#39;s which we<br/>
supplied it to bomb Serbia exactly as it had been doing with the same <br/>
planes<br/>
against its own population up until the time when it finally succeeded in<br/>
crushing internal terror as they called it. And as usual, as always,<br/>
resistance does include terror. Its true of the American Revolution. <br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
true of every case I know. Just as its true that those who have a monopoly<br/>
of violence talk about themselves as carrying out counter terror.<br/>
<br/>
Now that&#39;s pretty impressive and that has to do with the coalition that is<br/>
now being organized to fight the war against terror. And it&#39;s very<br/>
interesting to see how that coalition is being described. So have a look <br/>
at<br/>
this morning&#39;s Christian Science Monitor. That&#39;s a good newspaper. One of<br/>
the best international newspapers, with real coverage of the world. The <br/>
lead<br/>
story, the front-page story, is about how the United States, you know <br/>
people<br/>
used to dislike the United States but now they are beginning to respect <br/>
it,<br/>
and they are very happy about the way that the US is leading the war <br/>
against<br/>
terror. And the prime example, well in fact the only serious example, the<br/>
others are a joke, is Algeria. Turns out that Algeria is very enthusiastic<br/>
about the US war against terror. The person who wrote the article is an<br/>
expert on Africa. He must know that Algeria is one of the most vicious<br/>
terrorist states in the world and has been carrying out horrendous terror<br/>
against its own population in the past couple of years, in fact. For a<br/>
while, this was under wraps. But it was finally exposed in France by<br/>
defectors from the Algerian army. It&#39;s all over the place there and in<br/>
England and so on. But here, we&#39;re very proud because one of the worst<br/>
terrorist states in the world is now enthusiastically welcoming the US war<br/>
on terror and in fact is cheering on the United States to lead the war. <br/>
That<br/>
shows how popular we are getting.<br/>
<br/>
And if you look at the coalition that is being formed against terror it<br/>
tells you a lot more. A leading member of the coalition is Russia which is<br/>
delighted to have the United States support its murderous terrorist war in<br/>
Chechnya instead of occasionally criticizing it in the background. China <br/>
is<br/>
joining enthusiastically. It&#39;s delighted to have support for the <br/>
atrocities<br/>
it&#39;s carrying out in western China against, what it called, Muslim<br/>
secessionists. Turkey, as I mentioned, is very happy with the war against<br/>
terror. They are experts. Algeria, Indonesia delighted to have even more <br/>
US<br/>
support for atrocities it is carrying out in Ache and elsewhere. Now we <br/>
can<br/>
run through the list, the list of the states that have joined the <br/>
coalition<br/>
against terror is quite impressive. They have a characteristic in common.<br/>
They are certainly among the leading terrorist states in the world. And <br/>
they<br/>
happen to be led by the world champion.<br/>
<br/>
Well that brings us back to the question, what is terrorism? I have been<br/>
assuming we understand it. Well, what is it? Well, there happen to be some<br/>
easy answers to this. There is an official definition. You can find it in<br/>
the US code or in US army manuals. A brief statement of it taken from a US<br/>
army manual, is fair enough, is that terror is the calculated use of<br/>
violence or the threat of violence to attain political or religious<br/>
ideological goals through intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear. <br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
terrorism. That&#39;s a fair enough definition. I think it is reasonable to<br/>
accept that. The problem is that it can&#39;t be accepted because if you <br/>
accept<br/>
that, all the wrong consequences follow. For example, all the <br/>
consequences I<br/>
have just been reviewing. Now there is a major effort right now at the UN <br/>
to<br/>
try to develop a comprehensive treaty on terrorism. When Kofi Annan got <br/>
the<br/>
Nobel prize the other day, you will notice he was reported as saying that <br/>
we<br/>
should stop wasting time on this and really get down to it.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s a problem. If you use the official definition of terrorism in<br/>
the comprehensive treaty you are going to get completely the wrong <br/>
results.<br/>
So that can&#39;t be done. In fact, it is even worse than that. If you take a<br/>
look at the definition of Low Intensity Warfare which is official US <br/>
policy<br/>
you find that it is a very close paraphrase of what I just read. In fact,<br/>
Low Intensity Conflict is just another name for terrorism. That&#39;s why all<br/>
countries, as far as I know, call whatever horrendous acts they are <br/>
carrying<br/>
out, counter terrorism. We happen to call it Counter Insurgency or Low<br/>
Intensity Conflict. So that&#39;s a serious problem. You can&#39;t use the actual<br/>
definitions. You&#39;ve got to carefully find a definition that doesn&#39;t have <br/>
all<br/>
the wrong consequences.<br/>
<br/>
There are some other problems. Some of them came up in December 1987, at <br/>
the<br/>
peak of the first war on terrorism, that&#39;s when the furor over the plague<br/>
was peaking. The United Nations General Assembly passed a very strong<br/>
resolution against terrorism, condemning the plague in the strongest <br/>
terms,<br/>
calling on every state to fight against it in every possible way. It <br/>
passed<br/>
unanimously. One country, Honduras abstained. Two votes against; the usual<br/>
two, United States and Israel. Why should the United States and Israel <br/>
vote<br/>
against a major resolution condemning terrorism in the strongest terms, in<br/>
fact pretty much the terms that the Reagan administration was using? Well,<br/>
there is a reason. There is one paragraph in that long resolution which <br/>
says<br/>
that nothing in this resolution infringes on the rights of people <br/>
struggling<br/>
against racist and colonialist regimes or foreign military occupation to<br/>
continue with their resistance with the assistance of others, other <br/>
states,<br/>
states outside in their just cause. Well, the United States and Israel <br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
accept that. The main reason that they couldn&#39;t at the time was because of<br/>
South Africa. South Africa was an ally, officially called an ally. There <br/>
was<br/>
a terrorist force in South Africa. It was called the African National<br/>
Congress. They were a terrorist force officially. South Africa in contrast<br/>
was an ally and we certainly couldn&#39;t support actions by a terrorist group<br/>
struggling against a racist regime. That would be impossible.<br/>
<br/>
And of course there is another one. Namely the Israeli occupied <br/>
territories,<br/>
now going into its 35th year. Supported primarily by the United States in<br/>
blocking a diplomatic settlement for 30 years now, still is. And you can&#39;t<br/>
have that. There is another one at the time. Israel was occupying Southern<br/>
Lebanon and was being combated by what the US calls a terrorist force,<br/>
Hizbullah, which in fact succeeded in driving Israel out of Lebanon. And <br/>
we<br/>
can&#39;t allow anyone to struggle against a military occupation when it is <br/>
one<br/>
that we support so therefore the US and Israel had to vote against the <br/>
major<br/>
UN resolution on terrorism. And I mentioned before that a US vote<br/>
against...is essentially a veto. Which is only half the story. It also<br/>
vetoes it from history. So none of this was every reported and none of it<br/>
appeared in the annals of terrorism. If you look at the scholarly work on<br/>
terrorism and so on, nothing that I just mentioned appears. The reason is<br/>
that it has got the wrong people holding the guns. You have to carefully<br/>
hone the definitions and the scholarship and so on so that you come out <br/>
with<br/>
the right conclusions; otherwise it is not respectable scholarship and<br/>
honorable journalism. Well, these are some of problems that are hampering<br/>
the effort to develop a comprehensive treaty against terrorism. Maybe we<br/>
should have an academic conference or something to try to see if we can<br/>
figure out a way of defining terrorism so that it comes out with just the<br/>
right answers, not the wrong answers. That won&#39;t be easy.<br/>
<br/>
Well, let&#39;s drop that and turn to the 4th question, What are the origins <br/>
of<br/>
the September 11 crimes? Here we have to make a distinction between 2<br/>
categories which shouldn&#39;t be run together. One is the actual agents of <br/>
the<br/>
crime, the other is kind of a reservoir of at least sympathy, sometimes<br/>
support that they appeal to even among people who very much oppose the<br/>
criminals and the actions. And those are 2 different things.<br/>
<br/>
Well, with regard to the perpetrators, in a certain sense we are not <br/>
really<br/>
clear. The United States either is unable or unwilling to provide any<br/>
evidence, any meaningful evidence. There was a sort of a play a week or <br/>
two<br/>
ago when Tony Blair was set up to try to present it. I don&#39;t exactly know<br/>
what the purpose of this was. Maybe so that the US could look as though <br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
holding back on some secret evidence that it can&#39;t reveal or that Tony <br/>
Blair<br/>
could strike proper Churchillian poses or something or other. Whatever the<br/>
PR [public relations] reasons were, he gave a presentation which was in<br/>
serious circles considered so absurd that it was barely even mentioned. So<br/>
the Wall Street Journal, for example, one of the more serious papers had a<br/>
small story on page 12, I think, in which they pointed out that there was<br/>
not much evidence and then they quoted some high US official as saying <br/>
that<br/>
it didn&#39;t matter whether there was any evidence because they were going to<br/>
do it anyway. So why bother with the evidence? The more ideological press,<br/>
like the New York Times and others, they had big front-page headlines. But<br/>
the Wall Street Journal reaction was reasonable and if you look at the<br/>
so-called evidence you can see why. But let&#39;s assume that it&#39;s true. It is<br/>
astonishing to me how weak the evidence was. I sort of thought you could <br/>
do<br/>
better than that without any intelligence service [audience laughter]. In<br/>
fact, remember this was after weeks of the most intensive investigation in<br/>
history of all the intelligence services of the western world working<br/>
overtime trying to put something together. And it was a prima facie, it <br/>
was<br/>
a very strong case even before you had anything. And it ended up about <br/>
where<br/>
it started, with a prima facie case. So let&#39;s assume that it is true. So<br/>
let&#39;s assume that, it looked obvious the first day, still does, that the<br/>
actual perpetrators come from the radical Islamic, here called,<br/>
fundamentalist networks of which the bin Laden network is undoubtedly a<br/>
significant part. Whether they were involved or not nobody knows. It <br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
really matter much.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the background, those networks. Well, where do they come from? We<br/>
know all about that. Nobody knows about that better than the CIA because <br/>
it<br/>
helped organize them and it nurtured them for a long time. They were <br/>
brought<br/>
together in the 1980&#39;s actually by the CIA and its associates elsewhere:<br/>
Pakistan, Britain, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, China was involved, they <br/>
may<br/>
have been involved a little bit earlier, maybe by 1978. The idea was to <br/>
try<br/>
to harass the Russians, the common enemy. According to President Carter&#39;s<br/>
National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the US got involved in mid<br/>
1979. Do you remember, just to put the dates right, that Russia invaded<br/>
Afghanistan in December 1979. Ok. According to Brzezinski, the US support<br/>
for the mojahedin fighting against the government began 6 months earlier. <br/>
He<br/>
is very proud of that. He says we drew the Russians into, in his words, an<br/>
Afghan trap, by supporting the mojahedin, getting them to invade, getting<br/>
them into the trap. Now then we could develop this terrific mercenary <br/>
army.<br/>
Not a small one, maybe 100,000 men or so bringing together the best <br/>
killers<br/>
they could find, who were radical Islamist fanatics from around North<br/>
Africa, Saudi Arabia....anywhere they could find them. They were often<br/>
called the Afghanis but many of them, like bin Laden, were not Afghans. <br/>
They<br/>
were brought by the CIA and its friends from elsewhere. Whether Brzezinski<br/>
is telling the truth or not, I don&#39;t know. He may have been bragging, he <br/>
is<br/>
apparently very proud of it, knowing the consequences incidentally. But<br/>
maybe it&#39;s true. We&#39;ll know someday if the documents are ever released.<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s his perception. By January 1980 it is not even in doubt <br/>
that<br/>
the US was organizing the Afghanis and this massive military force to try <br/>
to<br/>
cause the Russians maximal trouble. It was a legitimate thing for the<br/>
Afghans to fight the Russian invasion. But the US intervention was not<br/>
helping the Afghans. In fact, it helped destroy the country and much more.<br/>
The Afghanis, so called, had their own...it did force the Russians to<br/>
withdrew, finally. Although many analysts believe that it probably delayed<br/>
their withdrawal because they were trying to get out of it. Anyway,<br/>
whatever, they did withdraw.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the terrorist forces that the CIA was organizing, arming, and<br/>
training were pursuing their own agenda, right away. It was no secret. One<br/>
of the first acts was in 1981 when they assassinated the President of <br/>
Egypt,<br/>
who was one of the most enthusiastic of their creators. In 1983, one <br/>
suicide<br/>
bomber, who may or may not have been connected, it&#39;s pretty shadowy, <br/>
nobody<br/>
knows. But one suicide bomber drove the US army-military out of Lebanon. <br/>
And<br/>
it continued. They have their own agenda. The US was happy to mobilize <br/>
them<br/>
to fight its cause but meanwhile they are doing their own thing. They were<br/>
clear very about it. After 1989, when the Russians had withdrawn, they<br/>
simply turned elsewhere. Since then they have been fighting in Chechnya,<br/>
Western China, Bosnia, Kashmir, South East Asia, North Africa, all over <br/>
the<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
They are telling us just what they think. The United States wants to <br/>
silence<br/>
the one free television channel in the Arab world because it&#39;s <br/>
broadcasting<br/>
a whole range of things from Powell over to Osama bin Laden. So the US is<br/>
now joining the repressive regimes of the Arab world that try to shut it <br/>
up.<br/>
But if you listen to it, if you listen to what bin Laden says, it&#39;s worth<br/>
it. There is plenty of interviews. And there are plenty of interviews by<br/>
leading Western reporters, if you don&#39;t want to listen to his own voice,<br/>
Robert Fisk and others. And what he has been saying is pretty consistent <br/>
for<br/>
a long time. He&#39;s not the only one but maybe he is the most eloquent. It&#39;s<br/>
not only consistent over a long time, it is consistent with their actions.<br/>
So there is every reason to take it seriously. Their prime enemy is what<br/>
they call the corrupt and oppressive authoritarian brutal regimes of the<br/>
Arab world and when the say that they get quite a resonance in the region.<br/>
They also want to defend and they want to replace them by properly <br/>
Islamist<br/>
governments. That&#39;s where they lose the people of the region. But up till<br/>
then, they are with them. From their point of view, even Saudi Arabia, the<br/>
most extreme fundamentalist state in the world, I suppose, short of the<br/>
Taliban, which is an offshoot, even that&#39;s not Islamist enough for them. <br/>
Ok,<br/>
at that point, they get very little support, but up until that point they<br/>
get plenty of support. Also they want to defend Muslims elsewhere. They <br/>
hate<br/>
the Russians like poison, but as soon as the Russians pulled out of<br/>
Afghanistan, they stopped carrying out terrorist acts in Russia as they <br/>
had<br/>
been doing with CIA backing before that within Russia, not just in<br/>
Afghanistan. They did move over to Chechnya. But there they are defending<br/>
Muslims against a Russian invasion. Same with all the other places I<br/>
mentioned. From their point of view, they are defending the Muslims <br/>
against<br/>
the infidels. And they are very clear about it and that is what they have<br/>
been doing.<br/>
<br/>
Now why did they turn against the United States? Well that had to do with<br/>
what they call the US invasion of Saudi Arabia. In 1990, the US <br/>
established<br/>
permanent military bases in Saudi Arabia which from their point of view is<br/>
comparable to a Russian invasion of Afghanistan except that Saudi Arabia <br/>
is<br/>
way more important. That&#39;s the home of the holiest sites of Islam. And <br/>
that<br/>
is when their activities turned against the Unites States. If you recall, <br/>
in<br/>
1993 they tried to blow up the World Trade Center. Got part of the way, <br/>
but<br/>
not the whole way and that was only part of it. The plans were to blow up<br/>
the UN building, the Holland and Lincoln tunnels, the FBI building. I <br/>
think<br/>
there were others on the list. Well, they sort of got part way, but not <br/>
all<br/>
the way. One person who is jailed for that, finally, among the people who<br/>
were jailed, was a Egyptian cleric who had been brought into the United<br/>
States over the objections of the Immigration Service, thanks to the<br/>
intervention of the CIA which wanted to help out their friend. A couple<br/>
years later he was blowing up the World Trade Center. And this has been<br/>
going on all over. I&#39;m not going to run through the list but it&#39;s, if you<br/>
want to understand it, it&#39;s consistent. It&#39;s a consistent picture. It&#39;s<br/>
described in words. It&#39;s revealed in practice for 20 years. There is no<br/>
reason not to take it seriously. That&#39;s the first category, the likely<br/>
perpetrators.<br/>
<br/>
What about the reservoir of support? Well, it&#39;s not hard to find out what<br/>
that is. One of the good things that has happened since September 11 is <br/>
that<br/>
some of the press and some of the discussion has begun to open up to some <br/>
of<br/>
these things. The best one to my knowledge is the Wall Street Journal <br/>
which<br/>
right away began to run, within a couple of days, serious reports, <br/>
searching<br/>
serious reports, on the reasons why the people of the region, even though<br/>
they hate bin Laden and despise everything he is doing, nevertheless <br/>
support<br/>
him in many ways and even regard him as the conscience of Islam, as one<br/>
said. Now the Wall Street Journal and others, they are not surveying <br/>
public<br/>
opinion. They are surveying the opinion of their friends: bankers,<br/>
professionals, international lawyers, businessmen tied to the United <br/>
States,<br/>
people who they interview in MacDonalds restaurant, which is an elegant<br/>
restaurant there, wearing fancy American clothes. That&#39;s the people they <br/>
are<br/>
interviewing because they want to find out what their attitudes are. And<br/>
their attitudes are very explicit and very clear and in many ways <br/>
consonant<br/>
with the message of bin Laden and others. They are very angry at the <br/>
United<br/>
States because of its support of authoritarian and brutal regimes; its<br/>
intervention to block any move towards democracy; its intervention to stop<br/>
economic development; its policies of devastating the civilian societies <br/>
of<br/>
Iraq while strengthening Saddam Hussein; and they remember, even if we<br/>
prefer not to, that the United States and Britain supported Saddam Hussein<br/>
right through his worst atrocities, including the gassing of the Kurds, <br/>
bin<br/>
Laden brings that up constantly, and they know it even if we don&#39;t want <br/>
to.<br/>
And of course their support for the Israeli military occupation which is<br/>
harsh and brutal. It is now in its 35th year. The US has been providing <br/>
the<br/>
overwhelming economic, military, and diplomatic support for it, and still<br/>
does. And they know that and they don&#39;t like it. Especially when that is<br/>
paired with US policy towards Iraq, towards the Iraqi civilian society <br/>
which<br/>
is getting destroyed. Ok, those are the reasons roughly. And when bin <br/>
Laden<br/>
gives those reasons, people recognize it and support it.<br/>
<br/>
Now that&#39;s not the way people here like to think about it, at least <br/>
educated<br/>
liberal opinion. They like the following line which has been all over the<br/>
press, mostly from left liberals, incidentally. I have not done a real <br/>
study<br/>
but I think right wing opinion has generally been more honest. But if you<br/>
look at say at the New York Times at the first op-ed they ran by Ronald<br/>
Steel, serious left liberal intellectual. He asks Why do they hate us? <br/>
This<br/>
is the same day, I think, that the Wall Street Journal was running the<br/>
survey on why they hate us. So he says &quot;They hate us because we champion a<br/>
new world order of capitalism, individualism, secularism, and democracy <br/>
that<br/>
should be the norm everywhere.&quot; That&#39;s why they hate us. The same day the<br/>
Wall Street Journal is surveying the opinions of bankers, professionals,<br/>
international lawyers and saying `look, we hate you because you are <br/>
blocking<br/>
democracy, you are preventing economic development, you are supporting<br/>
brutal regimes, terrorist regimes and you are doing these horrible things <br/>
in<br/>
the region.&#39; A couple days later, Anthony Lewis, way out on the left,<br/>
explained that the terrorist seek only &quot;apocalyptic nihilism,&quot; nothing <br/>
more<br/>
and nothing we do matters. The only consequence of our actions, he says,<br/>
that could be harmful is that it makes it harder for Arabs to join in the<br/>
coalition&#39;s anti-terrorism effort. But beyond that, everything we do is<br/>
irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you know, that&#39;s got the advantage of being sort of comforting. It<br/>
makes you feel good about yourself, and how wonderful you are. It enables <br/>
us<br/>
to evade the consequences of our actions. It has a couple of defects. One <br/>
is<br/>
it is at total variance with everything we know. And another defect is <br/>
that<br/>
it is a perfect way to ensure that you escalate the cycle of violence. If<br/>
you want to live with your head buried in the sand and pretend they hate <br/>
us<br/>
because they&#39;re opposed to globalization, that&#39;s why they killed Sadat 20<br/>
years ago, and fought the Russians, tried to blow up the World Trade <br/>
Center<br/>
in 1993. And these are all people who are in the midst of ... corporate<br/>
globalization but if you want to believe that, yeh...comforting. And it <br/>
is a<br/>
great way to make sure that violence escalates. That&#39;s tribal violence. <br/>
You<br/>
did something to me, I&#39;ll do something worse to you. I don&#39;t care what the<br/>
reasons are. We just keep going that way. And that&#39;s a way to do it. <br/>
Pretty<br/>
much straight, left-liberal opinion.<br/>
<br/>
What are the policy options? Well, there are a number. A narrow policy<br/>
option from the beginning was to follow the advice of really far out<br/>
radicals like the Pope [audience laughter]. The Vatican immediately said<br/>
look it&#39;s a horrible terrorist crime. In the case of crime, you try to <br/>
find<br/>
the perpetrators, you bring them to justice, you try them. You don&#39;t kill<br/>
innocent civilians. Like if somebody robs my house and I think the guy who<br/>
did it is probably in the neighborhood across the street, I don&#39;t go out<br/>
with an assault rifle and kill everyone in that neighborhood. That&#39;s not <br/>
the<br/>
way you deal with crime, whether it&#39;s a small crime like this one or <br/>
really<br/>
massive one like the US terrorist war against Nicaragua, even worse ones <br/>
and<br/>
others in between. And there are plenty of precedents for that. In fact, I<br/>
mentioned a precedent, Nicaragua, a lawful, a law abiding state, that&#39;s <br/>
why<br/>
presumably we had to destroy it, which followed the right principles. Now <br/>
of<br/>
course, it didn&#39;t get anywhere because it was running up against a power<br/>
that wouldn&#39;t allow lawful procedures to be followed. But if the United<br/>
States tried to pursue them, nobody would stop them. In fact, everyone <br/>
would<br/>
applaud. And there are plenty of other precedents.<br/>
<br/>
When the IRA set off bombs in London, which is pretty serious business,<br/>
Britain could have, apart from the fact that it was unfeasible, let&#39;s put<br/>
that aside, one possible response would have been to destroy Boston which <br/>
is<br/>
the source of most of the financing. And of course to wipe out West <br/>
Belfast.<br/>
Well, you know, quite apart from the feasibility, it would have been<br/>
criminal idiocy. The way to deal with it was pretty much what they did. <br/>
You<br/>
know, find the perpetrators; bring them to trial; and look for the <br/>
reasons.<br/>
Because these things don&#39;t come out of nowhere. They come from something.<br/>
Whether it is a crime in the streets or a monstrous terrorist crime or<br/>
anything else. There&#39;s reasons. And usually if you look at the reasons, <br/>
some<br/>
of them are legitimate and ought to be addressed, independently of the<br/>
crime, they ought to be addressed because they are legitimate. And that&#39;s<br/>
the way to deal with it. There are many such examples.<br/>
<br/>
But there are problems with that. One problem is that the United States <br/>
does<br/>
not recognize the jurisdiction of international institutions. So it can&#39;t <br/>
go<br/>
to them. It has rejected the jurisdiction of the World Court. It has <br/>
refused<br/>
to ratify the International Criminal Court. It is powerful enough to set <br/>
up<br/>
a new court if it wants so that wouldn&#39;t stop anything. But there is a<br/>
problem with any kind of a court, mainly you need evidence. You go to any<br/>
kind of court, you need some kind of evidence. Not Tony Blair talking <br/>
about<br/>
it on television. And that&#39;s very hard. It may be impossible to find.<br/>
<br/>
You know, it could be that the people who did it, killed themselves. <br/>
Nobody<br/>
knows this better than the CIA. These are decentralized, nonhierarchic<br/>
networks. They follow a principle that is called Leaderless Resistance.<br/>
That&#39;s the principle that has been developed by the Christian Right<br/>
terrorists in the United States. It&#39;s called Leaderless Resistance. You <br/>
have<br/>
small groups that do things. They don&#39;t talk to anybody else. There is a<br/>
kind of general background of assumptions and then you do it. Actually<br/>
people in the anti war movement are very familiar with it. We used to call<br/>
it affinity groups. If you assume correctly that whatever group you are in<br/>
is being penetrated by the FBI, when something serious is happening, you<br/>
don&#39;t do it in a meeting. You do it with some people you know and trust, <br/>
an<br/>
affinity group and then it doesn&#39;t get penetrated. That&#39;s one of the <br/>
reasons<br/>
why the FBI has never been able to figure out what&#39;s going on in any of <br/>
the<br/>
popular movements. And other intelligence agencies are the same. They <br/>
can&#39;t.<br/>
That&#39;s leaderless resistance or affinity groups, and decentralized <br/>
networks<br/>
are extremely hard to penetrate. And it&#39;s quite possible that they just<br/>
don&#39;t know. When Osama bin Laden claims he wasn&#39;t involved, that&#39;s <br/>
entirely<br/>
possible. In fact, it&#39;s pretty hard to imagine how a guy in a cave in<br/>
Afghanistan, who doesn&#39;t even have a radio or a telephone could have <br/>
planned<br/>
a highly sophisticated operation like that. Chances are it&#39;s part of the<br/>
background. You know, like other leaderless resistance terrorist groups.<br/>
Which means it&#39;s going to be extremely difficult to find evidence.<br/>
<br/>
And the US doesn&#39;t want to present evidence because it wants to be able to<br/>
do it, to act without evidence. That&#39;s a crucial part of the reaction. You<br/>
will notice that the US did not ask for Security Council authorization <br/>
which<br/>
they probably could have gotten this time, not for pretty reasons, but<br/>
because the other permanent members of the Security Council are also<br/>
terrorist states. They are happy to join a coalition against what they <br/>
call<br/>
terror, namely in support of their own terror. Like Russia wasn&#39;t going to<br/>
veto, they love it. So the US probably could have gotten Security Council<br/>
authorization but it didn&#39;t want it. And it didn&#39;t want it because it<br/>
follows a long-standing principle which is not George Bush, it was <br/>
explicit<br/>
in the Clinton administration, articulated and goes back much further and<br/>
that is that we have the right to act unilaterally. We don&#39;t want<br/>
international authorization because we act unilaterally and therefore we<br/>
don&#39;t want it. We don&#39;t care about evidence. We don&#39;t care about<br/>
negotiation. We don&#39;t care about treaties. We are the strongest guy <br/>
around;<br/>
the toughest thug on the block. We do what we want. Authorization is a bad<br/>
thing and therefore must be avoided. There is even a name for it in the<br/>
technical literature. It&#39;s called establishing credibility. You have to<br/>
establish credibility. That&#39;s an important factor in many policies. It was<br/>
the official reason given for the war in the Balkans and the most <br/>
plausible<br/>
reason.<br/>
<br/>
You want to know what credibility means, ask your favorite Mafia Don. <br/>
He&#39;ll<br/>
explain to you what credibility means. And it&#39;s the same in international<br/>
affairs, except it&#39;s talked about in universities using big words, and <br/>
that<br/>
sort of thing. But it&#39;s basically the same principle. And it makes sense.<br/>
And it usually works. The main historian who has written about this in the<br/>
last couple years is Charles Tilly with a book called Coercion, Capital, <br/>
and<br/>
European States. He points out that violence has been the leading <br/>
principle<br/>
of Europe for hundreds of years and the reason is because it works. You<br/>
know, it&#39;s very reasonable. It almost always works. When you have an<br/>
overwhelming predominance of violence and a culture of violence behind it.<br/>
So therefore it makes sense to follow it. Well, those are all problems in<br/>
pursuing lawful paths. And if you did try to follow them you&#39;d really open<br/>
some very dangerous doors. Like the US is demanding that the Taliban hand<br/>
over Osama bin Laden. And they are responding in a way which is regarded <br/>
as<br/>
totally absurd and outlandish in the west, namely they are saying, Ok, but<br/>
first give us some evidence. In the west, that is considered ludicrous. <br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
a sign of their criminality. How can they ask for evidence? I mean if<br/>
somebody asked us to hand someone over, we&#39;d do it tomorrow. We wouldn&#39;t <br/>
ask<br/>
for any evidence. [crowd laughter].<br/>
<br/>
In fact it is easy to prove that. We don&#39;t have to make up cases. So for<br/>
example, for the last several years, Haiti has been requesting the United<br/>
States to extradite Emmanuel Constant. He is a major killer. He is one of<br/>
the leading figures in the slaughter of maybe 4000 or 5000 people in the<br/>
years in the mid 1990&#39;s, under the military junta, which incidentally was<br/>
being, not so tacitly, supported by the Bush and the Clinton <br/>
administrations<br/>
contrary to illusions. Anyway he is a leading killer. They have plenty of<br/>
evidence. No problem about evidence. He has already been brought to trial<br/>
and sentenced in Haiti and they are asking the United States to turn him<br/>
over. Well, I mean do your own research. See how much discussion there has<br/>
been of that. Actually Haiti renewed the request a couple of weeks ago. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t even mentioned. Why should we turn over a convicted killer who was<br/>
largely responsible for killing 4000 or 5000 people a couple of years ago.<br/>
In fact, if we do turn him over, who knows what he would say. Maybe he&#39;ll<br/>
say that he was being funded and helped by the CIA, which is probably <br/>
true.<br/>
We don&#39;t want to open that door. And he is not he only one.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, for the last about 15 years, Costa Rica which is the democratic<br/>
prize, has been trying to get the United States to hand over a John Hull, <br/>
a<br/>
US land owner in Costa Rica, who they charge with terrorist crimes. He was<br/>
using his land, they claim with good evidence as a base for the US war<br/>
against Nicaragua, which is not a controversial conclusion, remember. <br/>
There<br/>
is the World Court and Security Council behind it. So they have been <br/>
trying<br/>
to get the United States to hand him over. Hear about that one? No.<br/>
<br/>
They did actually confiscate the land of another American landholder, John<br/>
Hamilton. Paid compensation, offered compensation. The US refused. Turned<br/>
his land over into a national park because his land was also being used <br/>
as a<br/>
base for the US attack against Nicaragua. Costa Rica was punished for that<br/>
one. They were punished by withholding aid. We don&#39;t accept that kind of<br/>
insubordination from allies. And we can go on. If you open the door to<br/>
questions about extradition it leads in very unpleasant directions. So <br/>
that<br/>
can&#39;t be done.<br/>
<br/>
Well, what about the reactions in Afghanistan. The initial proposal, the<br/>
initial rhetoric was for a massive assault which would kill many people<br/>
visibly and also an attack on other countries in the region. Well the Bush<br/>
administration wisely backed off from that. They were being told by every<br/>
foreign leader, NATO, everyone else, every specialist, I suppose, their <br/>
own<br/>
intelligence agencies that that would be the stupidest thing they could<br/>
possibly do. It would simply be like opening recruiting offices for bin<br/>
Laden all over the region. That&#39;s exactly what he wants. And it would be<br/>
extremely harmful to their own interests. So they backed off that one. And<br/>
they are turning to what I described earlier which is a kind of silent<br/>
genocide. It&#39;s a.... well, I already said what I think about it. I don&#39;t<br/>
think anything more has to be said. You can figure it out if you do the<br/>
arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
A sensible proposal which is kind of on the verge of being considered, but<br/>
it has been sensible all along, and it is being raised, called for by<br/>
expatriate Afghans and allegedly tribal leaders internally, is for a UN<br/>
initiative, which would keep the Russians and Americans out of it, <br/>
totally.<br/>
These are the 2 countries that have practically wiped the country out in <br/>
the<br/>
last 20 years. They should be out of it. They should provide massive<br/>
reparations. But that&#39;s their only role. A UN initiative to bring together<br/>
elements within Afghanistan that would try to construct something from the<br/>
wreckage. It&#39;s conceivable that that could work, with plenty of support <br/>
and<br/>
no interference. If the US insists on running it, we might as well quit. <br/>
We<br/>
have a historical record on that one.<br/>
<br/>
You will notice that the name of this operation....remember that at first <br/>
it<br/>
was going to be a Crusade but they backed off that because PR (public<br/>
relations) agents told them that that wouldn&#39;t work [audience laughter]. <br/>
And<br/>
then it was going to be Infinite Justice, but the PR agents said, wait a<br/>
minute, you are sounding like you are divinity. So that wouldn&#39;t work. And<br/>
then it was changed to enduring freedom. We know what that means. But <br/>
nobody<br/>
has yet pointed out, fortunately, that there is an ambiguity there. To<br/>
endure means to suffer. [audience laughter]. And a there are plenty of<br/>
people around the world who have endured what we call freedom. Again,<br/>
fortunately we have a very well-behaved educated class so nobody has yet<br/>
pointed out this ambiguity. But if its done there will be another problem <br/>
to<br/>
deal with. But if we can back off enough so that some more or less<br/>
independent agency, maybe the UN, maybe credible NGO&#39;s (non governmental<br/>
organizations) can take the lead in trying to reconstruct something from <br/>
the<br/>
wreckage, with plenty of assistance and we owe it to them. Them maybe<br/>
something would come out. Beyond that, there are other problems.<br/>
<br/>
We certainly want to reduce the level of terror, certainly not escalate <br/>
it.<br/>
There is one easy way to do that and therefore it is never discussed. <br/>
Namely<br/>
stop participating in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Message over 64 KB, truncated)</div>

  Preach on, Lynda!   <br/>
<br/>
  This is exactly what so many in PS need to hear today.  This IS what brought about the whole problem in the U.S.A. today, and in fact, the whole world.  Maybe that is also what led bin Laden into his role.  He got too much money and power and not enough guidance.<br/>

    &gt; Blame Lindh&#39;s permissive parents<br/>
    &gt; By Jeff Jacoby, 12/13/2001<br/>
    &gt;<br/>
    &gt; IT ISN&#39;T THE CASE that the parents of John Walker Lindh - the Marin<br/>
    &gt; County child of privilege turned Taliban terrorist - never drew the line<br/>
    &gt; with their son.<br/>
    &gt;<br/>
    If she and Frank Lindh had been less concerned with flaunting their<br/>
    &gt; open-mindedness and more concerned with developing their son&#39;s moral<br/>
    &gt; judgment, he wouldn&#39;t be where he is today. His road to treason and<br/>
    &gt; jihad didn&#39;t begin in Afghanistan. It began in Marin County, with<br/>
    &gt; parents who never said &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
