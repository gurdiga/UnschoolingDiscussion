<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024857717">LIfe is learning...<br/>
Unschooling --- learning--- isn&#39;t set at an age limit, I didn&#39;t think!<br/>
Preschool, post school.. whatever age..<br/>
I am 40 and still learning.. UNSCHOOLING!<br/>
Doesn&#39;t matter the age, does it?<br/>
Let&#39;s not pick such pettiness to argue over.<br/>
Ned, obviously, likes getting your goats, is my observation...<br/>
Silence often neutralizes these types..<br/>
No flame.. no fire..<br/>
<br/>
We should all have an in person get together.. at Ned&#39;s  :-)  <br/>
You&#39;d love it, right Ned?<br/>
We&#39;ll all be over at T&#39;giving time.. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Keep laughing!  Keep smiling!!<br/>
Life is too short to lose out on joy and laughter..<br/>
Lighten up, folks!  :-)<br/>
