<div id="ygrps-yiv-590751606">The answer to question #1 will come as you go further into the novel, but a<br/>
&quot;daemon familiar&quot; is a visible, touchable, intimate outside of the body<br/>
&quot;soul&quot; in Lyra&#39;s world.  I don&#39;t want to say much more, because the book<br/>
will tell you much more eloquently as it unfolds and lets you in on more of<br/>
what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy is wonderful!  I bought it for my son and<br/>
step-daughter after reading reviews at Amazon.com, but even that didn&#39;t<br/>
prepare me for the elegant, intelligent and compelling writing, the complex and easy to<br/>
care about characters, the edge of your seat story or the way it gets you<br/>
thinking about much larger themes.  I started reading it to my step-daughter<br/>
and couldn&#39;t put it down.  She would get mad at me for reading ahead while<br/>
she was asleep!  Again...I won&#39;t say anything else and let you read on!<br/>

idea to read it.  THANKS<br/>

I figured the book would get into it but I just wondered if there was some <br/>
&quot;background&quot; info on them in general, not really pertaining to the book.  <br/>
