<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175759272">um... I read the article you are talking about and I read the book...<br/>
<br/>
I think that C.C. is really not about what is in the center of what,<br/>
but about how babies have evolved to expect certain treatment at<br/>
certain stages of their lives... like, the baby expects to go through<br/>
the labour and birth, expects being held and breastfed, expects to be<br/>
near a caretacer at all times... the author suggests that this is how<br/>
human babies have been treated until recently and that the new things<br/>
like cribs, being left alone in nurseries, being fed formula on a<br/>
schedule, etc - are confusing babies and making them screwed up<br/>
psychologically for the rest of their lives. <br/>
<br/>
The way I think CC works with uschooling: the author suggests that<br/>
children expect to become part of adult society by being around the<br/>
adults, by learning through watching... like, one of the the examples<br/>
she uses is the two year old girl, who have been watching other women<br/>
work, wanting to join in and do the work herself. I this that&#39;s<br/>
pretty much unschooling in the nutshell, no?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140612526">I had wondered the same thing. It seems like the net result is very <br/>
similar in practice (to the degree that it is even possible to be <br/>
100% CC in the idustrialized world) but the reasoning that gets you <br/>
there is a shade different. I think in both cases you have natural <br/>
learning, and a shift away from schoolish paradigms, and you also <br/>
have children that are not inhibited in their endeavors or <br/>
overmanaged, but the difference is more pronounced in the mind of <br/>
the parent. As an unschooler I would probably see myself more as a <br/>
facilitator for the child, where as a cc&#39;er I would see myself more <br/>
as a model for the child. Not that a cc child has any obligation to <br/>
emulate the model, or that either role is mutually exclusive, but I <br/>
think it&#39;s the idea that in unschooling, the parent would find <br/>
themselves drawn into the child&#39;s world (playing yu-gi-oh for <br/>
example) and in cc the parent would just do adult work (make it <br/>
accessible) and let the child join in the adult world (or not) at <br/>
their own inclination. The parent works alongside the child, but the <br/>
parent doesn&#39;t really play per se, or follow the child&#39;s passions - <br/>
that is up to the child. I think both philosophies can inform each <br/>
other because they both work on the principle of giving your <br/>
children autonomy, but they do not seem interchangeable. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read the Continuum Concept and for me the thrust of the book was <br/>
primarily about how we raise babies and young children - about how <br/>
our human biological destiny has certain expectations about birth, <br/>
breastfeeding, being held in-arms, etc. and that it can be traumatic <br/>
for infants to be without these things that their bodies expect. It&#39;s <br/>
an interesting book, though I don&#39;t necessarily agree with all of the <br/>
author&#39;s assertions, I think it is very thought-provoking and <br/>
something worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t see Unschooling as particularly child-centered, <br/>
at least not the way it plays out in our family. DH and don&#39;t hang <br/>
around our children, waiting for them to want to learn or do <br/>
something and then instantly jump in to help them learn things. <br/>
Largely, each member of our family goes about our own interests, and <br/>
when someone needs helping out, we help each other out. Because our <br/>
society is more complex than that of the native Yequana that Liedloff <br/>
writes about, there is of necessary more things that I need to do for <br/>
my kids. I need to tranport them places, for instance. But they learn <br/>
things alongside adults - like cooking, housework, reading, <br/>
gardening, writing, building, or putting together a grocery list. <br/>
Learning as just part of life is, I think, pretty compatible with <br/>
what Liedloff describes in her book.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What I found hard to reconcile to unschooling is the idea that adults should<br/>
*not* play children�s games with children, in favor of the above type of<br/>
example almost exclusively, which I read in an article/excerpt on the<br/>
website. I have not read the whole book. The attachment parenting of babies<br/>
stuff made sense, but I had already received all that information from other<br/>
sources. I also didn�t like the description of the father at the restaurant<br/>
ordering the daughter�s, who was not a baby, food without any consultation.<br/>
His take charge decision making, without �fuss�, was presented as a great<br/>
thing for both kids and adults. There was definitely a sense pervading the<br/>
article that parents know best, and that children should *only* mimic adults<br/>
rather than have their own childish activities. Perhaps the book expands in<br/>
other directions. I�m not likely to read the whole thing though, since I<br/>
don�t want to start feeling guilty that I put baby Jayn down on her mat to<br/>
play sometimes. ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That often happens with unschooling...but then again the mom might be <br/>
trying to do work and the two year old would beg her to stop doing <br/>
the work and come play with her. <br/>
<br/>
It seems the continuum concept people would say that the mom should <br/>
continue with her work and the child should know not to expect the <br/>
mom to go play.  If the child wants the mom, the child joins in with <br/>
the adult thing.  The unschooler would say to drop the work and go <br/>
play with the child.  <br/>
<br/>
Yet www.continuum-concept.org seems to be pretty proud that John Holt <br/>
endorsed them.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking because sometimes finding a balance is difficult for me.  <br/>
I know I&#39;ve been told (at unschooling.com?)  that it&#39;s important for <br/>
moms to pursue their own interests, yet when I try to pursue my own <br/>
interests I feel I&#39;m always having to tell a child &quot;later&quot; to <br/>
something they want to do.  If I&#39;m focusing on being a mom who meets <br/>
her children&#39;s needs, then sometimes I don&#39;t have time to even think <br/>
about what my interests might be, let alone persue them.  Sometimes <br/>
it seems that my kids are more demanding than some others&#39; kids from <br/>
the impression I get here from some posts.  <br/>
<br/>
So how the continuum concept adults doing their work and kids being <br/>
free to either do the adult work or play on their own versus <br/>
unschooling mom whose kids want her playing legos, watching blues <br/>
clues, and helping with kid crafts all days is interesting to me <br/>
right now.  I appreciate the responses. :) <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Always&quot; is a bad word to be thinking or using.  <br/>
<br/>
Once might be too much, or maybe five times with an invitation for the child <br/>
to stay and watch what you&#39;re doing might be pretty cool for the kid and you <br/>
both.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I&#39;m focusing on being a mom who meets <br/>

<br/>
With toddlers, that&#39;s true of a lot of people, but toddlers get older by the <br/>
second.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So how the continuum concept adults doing their work and kids being <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
unschooling mom whose kids want her playing legos, watching blues <br/>
<br/>
clues, and helping with kid crafts all days is interesting to me <br/>
<br/>
right now.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The book and research weren&#39;t about western civilization, though.  My boys <br/>
can&#39;t see their dad at work.  It&#39;s a closed shop and they would need &quot;need to <br/>
know&quot; kinds of security clearance approval.  Lots of families are in that <br/>
situation.  Moms who are emergency room nurses are not going to be seen by their <br/>
kids, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In a simpler culture in which people work together in the presence of the <br/>
children, other things can happen.  <br/>
<br/>
In a culture such as ours where children are expected to have &quot;the task&quot; of <br/>
spending many of their youthful years learning a body of knowledge (however <br/>
dopey and arbitrary doesn&#39;t matter, the expectation remains), if a mother chooses <br/>
to step off the assembly line, she has done so in the company of her child <br/>
and there ARE still expectations and &quot;requirements.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers know the secret, that the required material is out there, in the <br/>
air and the drinking water.  So although we can have confidence that our <br/>
&quot;method&quot; will produce some results the others of our (vast and scattered) tribe <br/>
expect, we do need to spend time with our children for lots of reasons.  In a <br/>
&quot;continuum concept&quot; ideal tribe, the kids are never expected to all be elsewhere. <br/>
 The parents are cooking, weaving, farming, repairing, telling stories, etc., <br/>
in the natural presence of children.<br/>
<br/>
Our culture seems to be moving QUICKLY away from the presence of children <br/>
being considered natural in any way.<br/>

I think it&#39;s helpful to people who are starting off with breastfeeding or <br/>
family bed or attachment parenting or unschooling to have the reassurance that, <br/>
anthropologically speaking, children learn from the world around them.  It <br/>
helps people in western culture to see something about how people would live <br/>
naturally, as we tend to live in very contrived and false-to-biology ways.<br/>
<br/>
So reading Leidloff will help unschoolers, but it&#39;s not an interchangeable <br/>
thing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not addressed to me but here&#39;s my contribution. The Child-Free people. I respect people who don&#39;t want to have children. They know what&#39;s best for them. However, when I&#39;ve heard some of the people associated with this movement speak or be interviewed they carry on a) as if parents are mindless minions of domineering children, b) the burden children can be to someone&#39;s life and c) how just plain awful it is that parents get all those special privledges at work. <br/>
    Toughening laws against youth offenders and shutting them away instead of caring about them. Just get them out of our sight.<br/>
    The demonization of teenagers. Again, out of our sight, they steal stuff anyway.<br/>
    Mothers on TV. OK, some are okay but that one on CSI, the redhead? Her daughter was there to drive one plot and then gone again. Keep her out of our sight. (Sidenote - Has there ever been a  female corpse on either CSI that wasn&#39;t slim, young and dressed scantily?)<br/>
  School. Of course. <br/>
    The move to keep teenagers out of adulthood. No sex, no drugs untill you&#39;re out of school. And NO getting out of school or you&#39;re a bum. We don&#39;t want to see them on the streets anyway...they steal stuff.<br/>
    Actually I think I&#39;m making more of a case for how we treat teenagers. Which is horribly. That&#39;s been bothering me a LOT lately.  <br/>
    I&#39;m rambling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well when I&#39;m thinking &quot;culture&quot; and change all in one thought, I&#39;m thinking <br/>
of hundreds of years.   <br/>
<br/>
Quickly is within two or three generations.   Kindergarten is pretty much a <br/>
given now, and wasn&#39;t around a hundred years ago (not as a &quot;grade in school&quot; at <br/>
any rate), and now there are grown people who wouldn&#39;t know kindergarten was <br/>
a recent thing.<br/>
<br/>
Early reading is recent.   Kids used to go to school at 7 or 8, not 4 or 5.  <br/>
So much of the &quot;reading difficulty&quot; is nothing but that.  Same system, kids <br/>
MUCH younger.<br/>
<br/>
Daycare as a given thing is new.  Leaving kids with grandmothers or aunts, <br/>
not so new; taking them to child-storage areas outside the home, new.<br/>
<br/>
It is new for children to have their own rooms.  It&#39;s cool, for the sake of <br/>
privacy and taking care of their Barbies (new) and Lego (new), but biologically <br/>
and as to mammalian behavior, you never see a fox dig six little holes and <br/>
put one kit in each saying &quot;See ya in the morning!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s new with huge schools where the kids are separated into &quot;their own <br/>
grade&quot; for them to be discouraged or even forbidden to play with kids who are older <br/>
or younger.  In a one-room school, or even two or three room schools, mixed <br/>
age is &quot;normal&quot; and accepted as an asset and advantage.   When kids aren&#39;t in <br/>
school, playing in mixed-age groups is seen as good and sensible.   So the <br/>
&quot;kids his own age&quot; phenomenon and concern are VERY new, culturally speaking (and I <br/>
hope will be temporary).<br/>

&gt; The word QUICKLY caught my attention -- are there things you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; seeing lately that make you think the trend is really intensifying?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well when I&#39;m thinking &quot;culture&quot; and change all in one thought, <br/>
I&#39;m thinking <br/>
&gt; of hundreds of years.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quickly is within two or three generations.   Kindergarten is <br/>
pretty much a <br/>
&gt; given now, and wasn&#39;t around a hundred years ago (not as a &quot;grade <br/>
in school&quot; at <br/>
&gt; any rate), and now there are grown people who wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
kindergarten was <br/>
&gt; a recent thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Early reading is recent.   Kids used to go to school at 7 or 8, <br/>
not 4 or 5.  <br/>
&gt; So much of the &quot;reading difficulty&quot; is nothing but that.  Same <br/>
system, kids <br/>
&gt; MUCH younger.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Daycare as a given thing is new.  Leaving kids with grandmothers <br/>
or aunts, <br/>
&gt; not so new; taking them to child-storage areas outside the home, <br/>
new.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is new for children to have their own rooms.  It&#39;s cool, for <br/>
the sake of <br/>
&gt; privacy and taking care of their Barbies (new) and Lego (new), but <br/>
biologically <br/>
&gt; and as to mammalian behavior, you never see a fox dig six little <br/>
holes and <br/>
&gt; put one kit in each saying &quot;See ya in the morning!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s new with huge schools where the kids are separated <br/>
into &quot;their own <br/>
&gt; grade&quot; for them to be discouraged or even forbidden to play with <br/>
kids who are older <br/>
&gt; or younger.  In a one-room school, or even two or three room <br/>
schools, mixed <br/>
&gt; age is &quot;normal&quot; and accepted as an asset and advantage.   When <br/>
kids aren&#39;t in <br/>
&gt; school, playing in mixed-age groups is seen as good and <br/>
sensible.   So the <br/>
&gt; &quot;kids his own age&quot; phenomenon and concern are VERY new, culturally <br/>
speaking (and I <br/>
&gt; hope will be temporary).<br/>

need me a lot!  <br/>
<br/>
I have a group of friends who I&#39;ve known for years  who I like to <br/>
talk to online very regularly.  I&#39;ve been spending two hours a day <br/>
online lately, and that&#39;s just not working for my family.  Till I <br/>
spend that time online, do necessary cooking/cleaning/household <br/>
tasks, other stuff like showers and appointments, there&#39;s not much <br/>
time left for cool projects, games, and long conversations with the <br/>
kids.  I&#39;ve been finding myself saying, &quot;Yeah, that would be cool to <br/>
do someday&quot; but then someday never comes.  That&#39;s not the kind of <br/>
mommy I want to be.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a sobering conversation with my daughter tonight when I tucked <br/>
her in.  She&#39;s been bored lately.  Nothing she&#39;s doing is interesting <br/>
her.  She came right out and told me if I would spend less time on <br/>
the computer that I&#39;d be able to do more things with her.  She&#39;s <br/>
right. :( <br/>
<br/>
So today I told my friends that I need to cut the time I spend with <br/>
them, explained why, and asked them to remind me if they see me doing <br/>
more than occasionally popping in to say hi.  I can&#39;t afford to get <br/>
into long, deep conversations on a regular basis if I&#39;m going to be <br/>
the kind of mommy I want to be.  <br/>
<br/>
The time will come when my kids won&#39;t need me so much and I&#39;ll have <br/>
more time for me and my own interests.  <br/>

They&#39;d be in a hut next to mine and our kids could play while we <br/>
talked.  But talking to my friends online doesn&#39;t allow for any <br/>
interactions with my kids.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll be 52 on Saturday and I remember so well how I waited all summer <br/>
IMPATIENTLY for 2nd grade to start because that was when they would <br/>
pull out the learn-to-read books (Dick and Jane). A week went by. <br/>
Another week. And another. I complained almost DAILY to my mom that we <br/>
weren&#39;t learning to read yet. I remember very very clearly the day the <br/>
very first big book was put up on the easel and we read: &quot;Come, Dick. <br/>
Come, come.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay - stop LAUGHING those really were the words. Can you imagine?<br/>
<br/>
And then I remember there was a picture of Spot, the dog, shown <br/>
crouched down over some little creature, I can&#39;t remember if it was a <br/>
squirrel or a bird or what - and Dick is saying to Spot, &quot;Look, Spot. <br/>
Look, look. Oh, look. See, see. Oh, see.&quot; And I&#39;m thinking that when <br/>
the teacher turns the page, the dog will have snatched up that little <br/>
creature and make a meal out of it. Yikes! (Not so, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - nobody was in any hurry to get us reading. Not like today at <br/>
all. And - doesn&#39;t anybody notice that we had far fewer kids with <br/>
serious reading problems in those days? And those that read later were <br/>
considered slower, but not disabled.<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait - I forgot - they blame today&#39;s problems all on tv, don&#39;t <br/>
they!!!<br/>
<br/>
Well - tv was new then and kids spent many many hours watching a whole <br/>
lot of cartoons and western movies (that was most of the kids&#39; fare) <br/>
plus Howdy Doody, Romper Room, Chucko the Clown (he may have been <br/>
local), Captain Kangaroo, and Sheriff John. I Love Lucy!!! And I loved <br/>
game shows - especially &quot;What&#39;s My Line.&quot;<br/>

seeking and I have to say that it is hard to nail down because the <br/>
equilibrium point shifts constantly as the kids grow and change and <br/>
life circumstances change and WE grow and so on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the point at which people will recommend to a mom that she pursue <br/>
some of her own interests is when she seems totally co-dependent on her <br/>
children for her own emotional satisfaction, or intellectual satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
I have always liked music, and I remember going through a few years when the <br/>
only music I &quot;studied,&quot; researched and learned was Raffi (I would tell the <br/>
kids which songs were traditional and which were his originals), or Sesame Street <br/>
(I often knew who had written it), or Animaniacs (they had some really great <br/>
stuff).  Weird Al was the closest I was coming sometimes to adult music. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
But that&#39;s not a bad thing.  Holly and I have looked for lyrics and composer <br/>
for a names song that Bob and Olivia sang on Sesame Street long ago.  It has <br/>
two lines that the go together.  The first lines are &quot;I like my name, it fits me <br/>
to a T, I like my name, it even sounds like me...&quot;  (Just in case any of you <br/>
happen to have a lead we don&#39;t have.)<br/>
<br/>
So one of my interests easily overlapped with what was going on in their <br/>
lives already, and I wasn&#39;t feeling crowded.   It&#39;s efficient and good in many <br/>
ways when unschooling parents can get truly interested in kid-stuff when their <br/>
kids are little.   <br/>
<br/>
But when and if a mom is complaining that she feels she has no life, people <br/>
recommend that she find something that seems lifelike to her.  If she complains <br/>
that she&#39;s tired of kids&#39; music, people recommend she listen to some other <br/>
kinds of music on her own.  It&#39;s not always so much a recommendation for the <br/>
mom&#39;s sake (though in part it is) as it is &quot;find something that will soothe you <br/>
so that you don&#39;t torment and resent the kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And as the kids get older, it&#39;s helpful for them to see parents pursuing <br/>
interests not just because the kids might be interested in doing the same things, <br/>
but because they see how to balance a life with a hobby in it.    My husband&#39;s <br/>
been doing woodwork for a few years now, and he mostly uses it as a relaxing <br/>
time and an artistic outlet.   The kids will go out and watch him and talk to <br/>
him sometimes.  They&#39;re learning a little about what kinds of woods carve more <br/>
easily and about how much scrap there might be from a project, and what the <br/>
safety considerations of hand carving are, and how patterns can be transferred, <br/>
but not because anyone&#39;s telling them, just because they&#39;re there.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody else (not even me, even though I messed a little with woodcarving <br/>
years ago) has said &quot;Can I try it?&quot;  They might someday, and they might never.  <br/>
That&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it would be good for a parent to have a hobby that totally <br/>
excluded a child, something so dangerous or removed that the child couldn&#39;t even <br/>
see them do it.   Really fragile hobbies like pouring, firing and painting <br/>
little ceramic things, might be cruel to do in front of kids you don&#39;t want to <br/>
have touching anything.   I quit sewing for a few years when the kids were little <br/>
because I didn&#39;t have room to leave my things out and I didn&#39;t want a toddler <br/>
to get pins and needles in him or on the floor while I was changing the baby.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sky King. Mighty Mouse. Ranger Hal.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember Ranger Hal, but in the Sky King era there was a show called <br/>
Fury, about two kids who had a horse named Fury, and lived with their dad and <br/>
a grumpy old male &quot;hand&quot; who played housekeeper and childminder. (I think it <br/>
might&#39;ve been Harry Morgan, but I&#39;m not sure.)  They missed their mom, and I <br/>
felt sorry for them.<br/>
<br/>
I liked Whirlybirds, about two guys in one of those then-new two-passenger <br/>
helicopters who would rescue people.  I used to sit  and watch every movement of <br/>
the pilot and imitate it where I was sitting, and I was pretty sure I <br/>
could&#39;ve flown a helicopter.<br/>
<br/>
I remember my television watching involving a lot of thinking about the <br/>
characters and situations, about danger and love and coping.<br/>
<br/>
Sgt. Preston of the Yukon was sometimes a little too exciting for me.  I <br/>
feared for his dog&#39;s safety.  I think the soundtrack music was scary sometimes.  <br/>
But because of that show I became more interested in remote ranger stations and <br/>
horse-back patrols.  I wasn&#39;t in Canada, but even in New Mexico there were <br/>
rescue teams and sheriff&#39;s deputies who worked on horseback, and my neighbor was <br/>
a fish&#39;n&#39;game officer.  And because of that show I learned that there WAS a <br/>
&quot;Canada&quot; and they weren&#39;t part of the U.S. and they had &quot;Royal Mounties.&quot;  So I <br/>
was ripe to figure out why they had &quot;royal&quot; if they didn&#39;t have a king, and <br/>
all that ties in to that.<br/>
<br/>
I hung out with my mom quite a bit too, and I learned songs from her and she <br/>
told me stories of when she was little (the depression, itinerant <br/>
cotton-picking in west Texas, black-out nights in Carlsbad during the war) but I think I <br/>
learned more from TV shows.<br/>

<br/>
I used to sew a lot when the kids were little, but did it after they went to<br/>
bed.<br/>
<br/>
DH is a fireman for a hobby.  The kids see him get to drive the Santa into<br/>
town on the firetruck and occassionally go down to the station with him when<br/>
he needs to pick something up or whatever.  For the most part, the kids&#39;<br/>
view of his hobby is that his pager goes off and he leaves, often not<br/>
returning for hours.  It isn&#39;t much of a problem because I am here.<br/>
<br/>
I used to study karate many nights a week.  I was with the kids during the<br/>
day and in the evenings, dh was with them, focusing on them, so it wasn&#39;t<br/>
much of a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I can see where it would be a problem if the kids were left to their own<br/>

Good points.  I remember when TV&#39;s Mad About You did the baby thing --<br/>
 I was pregnant at the same time as Jamie.  And then they had the <br/>
baby -- and after a few episodes, life was back to normal.  They were <br/>
out and about without the baby, constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Really didn&#39;t match my experience at the time, y&#39;know?<br/>

<br/>
Ok, I have to defend Catherine Willows here.  -smile-  They don&#39;t talk much<br/>
about ANYONE&#39;s private life on the show, on purpose.  Her daughter actually<br/>
gets mentioned a bit more than, say, Jorja Fox&#39;s cat or something.  They<br/>
also talk some about the head guy&#39;s deafness, but that&#39;s about it.<br/>
<br/>
And when she does talk about her, it&#39;s realistic.<br/>
<br/>
Now is the point were I mention that I am a HUGE Marg Helgenberger fan, have<br/>
been since China Beach.  So I tend to pay a lot of attention to her, er,<br/>
character.  Yeah, that&#39;s it, her character--no, no, not the gorgeous figure<br/>
and totally diverting face, really, honest......<br/>

&gt;Yeah.  In a simpler culture my best friends wouldn&#39;t be online.<br/>
&gt;They&#39;d be in a hut next to mine and our kids could play while we<br/>
&gt;talked.  But talking to my friends online doesn&#39;t allow for any<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking about this.<br/>
<br/>
How valid is it that the grownups in these societies NEVER play with their<br/>
kids.  That just doesn&#39;t seem like human nature.  Ok, so they need to spend<br/>
more daily time on subsistence, fair &#39;nuff.  And it&#39;s just way more<br/>
important in those societies that this kind of things gets done, daily, on<br/>
time, etc.  (I mean, honestly, we can always do the dishes tomorrow, or<br/>
after the kids are asleep, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
But I still can&#39;t imagine a human society where Mom and Dad or Uncle Louie<br/>
NEVER drops what they are doing with a laugh and chases the kids around the<br/>
campfire for a couple minutes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965734014">Some other of what she writes about in this tribe sounds a little <br/>
off, to me, too. There were knives lying about, and the babies played <br/>
with them but didn&#39;t have injuries? REALLY? I very much doubt that, <br/>
especially in light of other reading, where another anthropologist <br/>
describes scars on some of the children. They play without fear <br/>
around an open pit and no one ever falls in? Really.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the book, but found it to be a bit &quot;Noble Savage&quot;. Not that <br/>
we in civilized western society don&#39;t have room for improvement, <br/>
but ...can it possibly be that human beings always get along with <br/>
each other, without envy, strife, enmity? I simply can not believe <br/>
that. She either didn&#39;t observe them long enough, nor in enough <br/>
detail, or not objectively enough. IMO<br/>

sometimes write the words himself) when he was 3 and 4, because he <br/>
wanted to have something to show my writer&#39;s group when they came to <br/>
my house.  He doesn&#39;t care to do that anymore, but he still has a <br/>
great relationship with everyone in the group.  And we&#39;re pretty good <br/>
about working around when I need some writing time -- sometimes I jot <br/>
down ideas while he&#39;s playing, and I just put down the pen when he <br/>
needs something or he&#39;s ready for me to play.  Sometimes I go off for <br/>
a night with my laptop (Christmas present -- thank you, lovely <br/>
husband) and get the ideas down that have been circling in my head <br/>
all week.  I usually write something down before I go to bed at night.<br/>
<br/>
I think the hobbies where there are sharp things -- working with <br/>
stained glass comes to mind -- can be the worst.  I had a friend who <br/>
did that -- she had a separate room with a door that closed.  But <br/>
even so, if she was working during naptime and her daughter came to <br/>
get her, she had to stop at the door for fear of stepping on sharp <br/>
shavings or breathing in chemicals, or distracting mom during a <br/>
delicate operation.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if it&#39;s your passion, you can find a way.  Take <br/>
classes at a studio one night a week, or wait until the kids are <br/>
older.  They do grow up -- that toddler stage lasts for such a short <br/>
time.<br/>
