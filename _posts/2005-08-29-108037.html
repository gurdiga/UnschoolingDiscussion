 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a New Orleans-origin word, I think, and probably the only Americans, <br/>
even, who would know about it are those who read/care/know about folklore and <br/>
religion and such.    Someone who&#39;s superstitious or afraid of the voodoo-related <br/>
religions in the south will be more likely to have come across that word, I <br/>
guess, or people who have that anthropological curiosity about what&#39;s what.<br/>
<br/>
In Treasure Island by Stevenson, there&#39;s the passage about the black spot <br/>
(some kind of death threat consisting of a darkened black circle on a piece of <br/>
paper).   I lifted the quotes from here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.talewins.com/Treasures/Kids/Island/29.htm">http://www.talewins.com/Treasures/Kids/Island/29.htm</a><br/>
so Chapter 29<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re trying to intimidate Long John Silver by delivering them a black <br/>
spot, some kind of death threat, but he spooks them way worse in return by telling <br/>
them what bad luck it is that one of them has cut a Bible.   Dick, whose <br/>
Bible it is, says that it will still be good (&quot;It&#39;ll do to kiss the book on <br/>
still&quot;--for swearing oaths or for getting a blessing, I think--what Bibles would be <br/>
kissed about).   Silver assures him no, that being cut it will have lost its <br/>
power and be no more good than a ballad-book.   Dick would kinda like to have a <br/>
ballad book and perks up, but that doesn&#39;t keep him from feeling he&#39;s cursed <br/>
himself and their group plan.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
 &quot;The black spot! I thought so,&quot; he observed. &quot;Where might you have got the <br/>
paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain&#39;t lucky! You&#39;ve gone and cut this <br/>
out of a Bible. What fool&#39;s cut a Bible?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Ah, there!&quot; said Morgan. &quot;There! Wot did I say? No good&#39;ll come o&#39; that, I <br/>
said.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Well, you&#39;ve about fixed it now, among you,&quot; continued Silver. &quot;You&#39;ll all <br/>
swing now, I reckon. What soft- headed lubber had a Bible?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;It was Dick,&quot; said one.<br/>
<br/>
. . . .<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;So that&#39;s the toon, is it?&quot; cried the cook. &quot;George, I reckon you&#39;ll have <br/>
to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I&#39;m not a revengeful man. <br/>
But that was never my way. And now, shipmates, this black spot? &#39;Tain&#39;t much <br/>
good now, is it? Dick&#39;s crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, and that&#39;s about <br/>
all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;It&#39;ll do to kiss the book on still, won&#39;t it?&quot; growled Dick, who was <br/>
evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;A Bible with a bit cut out!&quot; returned Silver derisively. &quot;Not it. It don&#39;t <br/>
bind no more&#39;n a ballad-book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Don&#39;t it, though?&quot; cried Dick with a sort of joy. &quot;Well, I reckon that&#39;s <br/>
worth having too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Here, Jim--here&#39;s a cur&#39;osity for you,&quot; said Silver, and he tossed me the <br/>
paper.<br/>
<br/>
It was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was blank, for it had <br/>
been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of Revelation--these <br/>
words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon my mind: &quot;Without are dogs <br/>
and murderers.&quot; The printed side had been blackened with wood ash, which <br/>
already began to come off and soil my fingers; on the blank side had been written <br/>
with the same material the one word &quot;Depposed.&quot; I have that curiosity beside <br/>
me at this moment, but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single <br/>
scratch, such as a man might make with his thumb-nail.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824629164">That idea that the Bible was holy until it was damaged and now it&#39;s just a <br/>
regular book (even though the idea was put forth by a manipulative kind of <br/>
psychopathic fictional character &lt;g&gt;) has to do with juju.   Does one copy of a <br/>
bible have power?  <br/>
<br/>
In the good old days of the monolithic Catholic church in Europe   (good old <br/>
days for the Catholic church, anyway), there were Bibles with covers made of <br/>
gold and jewels, containing holy relics.   The Bible itself was a reliquary, so <br/>
in addition to it being hand written by monks and hand-illustrated on <br/>
hand-made paper and hand-bound, it had a monetary value and it contained some <br/>
sanctified item (a piece of the true cross, maybe, or a bone or some hair from a <br/>
saint, or who knows what).    THAT book certainly ought not to have a piece of <br/>
paper cut out of the back of it.<br/>
<br/>
A commercially-produced Bible, even in the early 19th century though, has got <br/>
to be much less sanctified, if it is at all.   And a Bible produced in 2005, <br/>
on a high-speed press, manufactured in runs of hundreds of thousands, what <br/>
degree of original juju does that have?<br/>
<br/>
Yet there was recently an international incident of huge proportions because <br/>
someone claimed that someone did something disrespectful to a copy of the <br/>
Koran.     And I&#39;m sure children have been severely shamed and punished for casual <br/>
mistreatment of Bibles, even without purposeful destruction.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s just worship of the physical form of the book.<br/>

<br/>
--------------<br/>
In New Orleans, vodou is often called hoodoo (a further corruption of<br/>
vodou), and in that city a fetish (i.e. any kind of charm, amulet, or<br/>
magical means of protection) is commonly called a juju. Louisiana has<br/>
a pronounced French influence and juju comes from the French word<br/>
joujou, &quot;toy, plaything&quot;.  Sometimes (especially if one is a fan of<br/>
New Orleans singer and composer Dr. John), one will come across the<br/>
word gris-gris which is a leather bag containing a juju.  The word<br/>
gris-gris has been known since the 17th century when a traveler in<br/>
West Africa noted that &quot;They wear about their Neck, Arms, and Legs,<br/>
and even bind about their Horses, little leathern Bags, which they<br/>
call Grisgris, in which are enclosed certain Passages of the Alcoran<br/>
[i.e. the Koran] to secure them from venemous Beasts, etc.&quot; <br/>
Unfortunately, although its African origin is indisputable, the<br/>
precise etymology of this word is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
It seems such a nice parallel to find the Koran used as the juju in<br/>
the gris-gris from the 17th century, given the discussion of books<br/>
(and even the Bible) as juju.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928383129">Hi that&#39;s really interesting. An old neighbour of mine was from <br/>
Pakistan. We live in a very mixed area with lots of people from <br/>
everywhere with a very large ex Pakistani population. Most UK families <br/>
originaly from Pakistan visit there quite frequently. <br/>
<br/>
The last time I saw my neighbour they were not long back from visiting <br/>
Pakistan and the youngest son had a necklace round his neck with a <br/>
small leather pouch on. I asked my neighbour what it was and she said <br/>
she&#39;d got it in Pakistan and it was to protect him and contained some <br/>
herbs and other things.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have a Dr John tape somewhere with all the stuff about gris <br/>
gris on it.<br/>
