<div id="ygrps-yiv-819299172">I know this is WAY late (I have the digest version and often don&#39;t even<br/>
get to that), but I have a 3 1/2 year old who loves to stay up late but...<br/>
beginning when she was 16 months old she began staying up until 2 or 3 or<br/>
4 or 5 (!!!) am.  Every night.  It was excruciating.  We tried everything,<br/>
homeopathic remedies (two doctors), herbs, essential oils in her bath or<br/>
boiling on the stove, bedtime routines, stories, acupressure, diet, you<br/>
name it and nothing worked.  (I was ready to take her to a regular medical<br/>
sleep doctor type...I was SO desperate) It went on for 18 months like<br/>
this. At times I just coped, I made cookies, cleaned the house, started a<br/>
journal (you can actually do many things at any hour of the night, except<br/>
call friends!) We finally figured out that she had a 25 hour body clock<br/>
and we let her cycle around the clock (it was difficult, napping from 2 am<br/>
to 5 am, waking up for 8 hours sleeping from 1 pm to 9pm and up &quot;for the<br/>
day&quot; at 9pm) napping and sleeping whenever she wanted. She was in a better<br/>
mood and mom was more relaxed, although it hard to explain to neighbors<br/>
why you&#39;re sleeping from 11 am till 6 pm.  And it kind of worked.  It took<br/>
two weeks to get to a &quot;reasonable&quot; bedtime of 10pm and she would still<br/>
cycle going to bed later and later each night and then sort of<br/>
&quot;self-correct&quot; by not napping one day.  She finally gave up napping when<br/>
she 3 years and a few months and that ended it.  Now she wakes up between<br/>
8:30 am and 9:30 am, and if she naps (which is only once or twice a week<br/>
now) she&#39;s up until 1 am (she doesn&#39;t need a lot of sleep).  So,  if you<br/>
followed all that, has anyone ever had this experience?  Many little ones,<br/>
it seems, have periods when they don&#39;t go to bed until the wee hours.<br/>
But, has anyone been through the wee hours thing for months and<br/>
(torturous) months on end?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Wini<br/>

When my one son (now 5) was little 3 months--3 years<br/>
He would stay up NO NAP all day and then not go to bed until 1 AM!!<br/>
AND he was very fussy till he was 18 months UGH<br/>
HE now sleeps whenever---usually 1 am or earlier (but he is impossible to<br/>
get to sleep until he is ready) and he gets up at 12 or 1 in the<br/>
afternoon--sometimes earlier<br/>
I try to take an hour off the wake up and add it to the sleep time, but he<br/>
corrects the problem and we are back to late late late nights<br/>
I have to really struggle to keep him on a &quot;normal&quot; schedule--I.E. 9 PM to<br/>
9pm----HE sleeps very hard when he is asleep......He has alot of allergies<br/>
(TONS) AND I am sure that has something to do with it<br/>
I give up with all of them as my one daughter (10) likes to stay up until 12<br/>
or later all the time<br/>
They are up so much now that the baby is sometimes up till 12 AM!!<br/>
I know it is part ME (we have been up late remodeling another house and<br/>
don&#39;t get home till 10 PM) and it is that they have different rhythms---They<br/>
all sleep in my bed though so when one has one schedule and one has another<br/>
it makes it difficult to adjust.....But I am enjoying my fairly new approach<br/>
(OH WELL)---It seems to work for ME!<br/>
SOS...who got up at 7 and then slept from 9-11....I think I am as nutty as<br/>
they are now!!</div>

How so?  I mean, how do you believe his allergies are connected to his<br/>
circadian rhthym?  What is he allergic to?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that his allergies made it so that he woke up ALOT---since he would<br/>
frequently stop breathing and have to change position to start again and<br/>
breathe through is mouth etc..so this caused him to awaken a little and then<br/>
he would be awake and he also also had belly aches etc.....AND all that<br/>
wonderful stuff...I think that he just got into the habit<br/>
of......awakening...and with all these allergies and sinus troubles<br/>
etc....he could not get back to sleep---I am beginning to think that he also<br/>
slept better after the world went to bed and there was not so much dust--car<br/>
pollution---etc...going around--(he also has slight asthma---I have never<br/>
treated it and he seems to have outgrown most of it!)---tho I am confident<br/>
if I would have treated it his body would be adjusted to the medication and<br/>
not been able to fight it and grow stronger---(I unknowingly drank<br/>
contaminated water for two months during my pregnancy!!)<br/>
I did have him tested and he is allergic to about everything!<br/>
I mostly stay away from milk and milk products and processed food etc...it<br/>
helps and he gets acidophilus (SP I am sure) that helps his belly and<br/>
digestion....I try to organic as much as I can and that helps also---BUT and<br/>
this is the best advice that I ever got---HE craves, intensely at times,<br/>
that which he is allergic to (so if you are questioning if allergic to<br/>
something or not---it is usually that which they love since when one is<br/>
allergic their bodies cannot extract the vitamins and minerals as well!)<br/>
 HAVE fun<br/>
SOSusan....thanks<br/>
