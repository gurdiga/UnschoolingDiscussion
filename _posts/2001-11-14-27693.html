<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306467669">Thanks everyone who offered &#39;food for thought&#39; in regard to my neglectful<br/>
neighbor&#39;!<br/>
<br/>
lovemary:<br/>
you wrote that you know some 10 yr olds can be left alone.  I agree that<br/>
some are mature enough to handle this.  My oldest is not yet 10,  but we&#39;ve<br/>
started talking about what  her parameters would be when she is old enough<br/>
to be left for short time periods.<br/>
<br/>
This boy,  however,  had no idea when his father would return,  had no way<br/>
to contact him in an emergency,  did not know his mother&#39;s cell number (she<br/>
was out of town anyway),  and his father had not notified any neighbor to be<br/>
a backup in case of emergency...or in case of anything...like needing to use<br/>
a bathroom!<br/>
<br/>
Nance:<br/>
You are on the same page with me in needing to vant about this!  I was<br/>
FUMING angry!!  And wanted to sort it out before acting....and wanted to<br/>
make sure the child is toip priority.....ands wanted to maintain a positive<br/>
relationship with him.<br/>
<br/>
We have lived behind them for almost 10 years,  so I&#39;ve known him almost his<br/>
whole life.  And I have seen his parents struggle all along.  His father is<br/>
a heavy drinker...well,  let&#39;s not mince this...he&#39;s an alcoholic.  His mom<br/>
works 2nd shift about 4 nights/week.  She is in big-time denial and talking<br/>
to her has never helped in the past.  I had a &#39;little run-in&#39;  with the Dad<br/>
a few weeks ago because his sons play here at least five out of 7<br/>
days/week....they don&#39;t ever call,  just show up on the street (So dad can<br/>
say,  well,  I never sent them to your house,  just your street.)  I&#39;ve had<br/>
to drop his kids off with him,  knowing he&#39;s asleep on the couch (in early<br/>
evening or afternoon, anytime)  but he&#39;s &#39;asleep&#39; from drunkenness.  I have<br/>
seen this neglect get worse over time.<br/>
<br/>
I have an attatchment to the kids...I think foster care would not be a good<br/>
life....I feel the father would retaliate (against several neighbors if he<br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out who called),  and I fear this.  And I know how difficult<br/>
it is for social services/CPS workers to be able to get evidence,<br/>
especially of neglect.  The son would be called a liar by his father and the<br/>
social worker would not have anything clear to go on,  and the boy&#39;s<br/>
confusing world would probably become more so.<br/>
<br/>
Samantha said:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; So I might connect up with the Mom when she gets back<br/>
&gt; &gt; and say. Your son got locked out of the house when you<br/>
&gt; &gt; were out of town. I would be happy to keep an xtra key<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the kids so they can get in the house when they<br/>
&gt; &gt; get locked out. Build a connection if you feel up to<br/>
&gt; &gt; it. That&#39;s what community is about isn&#39;t? It&#39;s what I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would hope I would have the courage to do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thank you for your calm, reasonable approach,  which is the path I usually<br/>
prefer.  As I stated earlier,  the mom is not reasonable to talk with since<br/>
she&#39;s deeply entrenched in the ruse of denial...about the neglect,<br/>
abuse(?), the drinking.  I know he at least abuse her verbally,  it&#39;s<br/>
horrible to see and hear..who knows what else may happen behind closed<br/>
doors?  Several neighbors do tend to &#39;watch out&#39; for the kids....it&#39;s a<br/>
balancing act......trying to figure out what&#39;s best for the family.  Would a<br/>
call to CPS wake them up?  I wish I knew it would,  I&#39;d do it.  My immediate<br/>
&#39;feeling&#39; was to lock that dad up and hope he&#39;s removed....but it was a<br/>
visceral response.<br/>
OTOH, someone asked me how I&#39;d feel if something happens to one of the kids<br/>
while he&#39;s neglecting them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From Nance:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sounds likes a better solution to me.  Or something to let her know that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; went on and you are available to help in some small way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, this is not that uncommon a situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My recent encounter:  A young boy (I though 6 or 7 yo, turned out he was 8<br/>
&gt; (but he had to think about it!)) came to the door selling that school<br/>
&gt; fundraiser stuff (notice my ladylike restraint).  Alone!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was one of the half-days of ps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In our first encounter I asked where his Mom or Dad were -- &quot;Oh, Dad&#39;s at<br/>
&gt; work until 6:00 and Mom&#39;s at work too.&quot;  OK -- half day of school.  He&#39;s<br/>
&gt; alone until 6:00, from 1:00 on.  This was about 1:30 -- he could have been<br/>
&gt; missing until 6:00 before anyone even knew!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ack.  I did the wrong thing and told him to come back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I should have just had him wait out on the front deck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I called the school.  No, he was not supposed to be selling door to door.<br/>
&gt; But, no, it was not the school&#39;s problem and there wasn&#39;t anything they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do about it.  &quot;Well, the first words out of his mouth are that he&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>selling<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this stuff for XYZ School.&quot;  No matter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, he came back and I had him sit down out on the front deck and gave him<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; good talking-to.  And he &quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot;-ed me and seemed to be heading in the<br/>
&gt; direction of his house.  From what I gathered about 5-6 blocks away.  He<br/>
 </span></blockquote>also<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; claimed that nobody had ever told him that he shouldn&#39;t be going up to<br/>
&gt; strangers&#39; homes or that he shouldn&#39;t be out by himself.  He was 8 -- and<br/>
&gt; little -- I could have picked him up under one arm!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope he made it home.  Should I have taken him home?  Who knows what I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have been in trouble for in that case.  But it seemed wrong to send him<br/>
 </span></blockquote>off<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the school is at fault for pumping these little kids up about the<br/>
&gt; trinkets they can win for selling enough of this junk.  And the parents<br/>
 </span></blockquote>are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at fault too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, as the school&#39;s assistant prin told me, this is not an uncommon<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Vent over!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082559618">When the kids a bit older, if you&#39;re still neighbors, you might want to <br/>
consider hooking him up with AlaTeen (he doesn&#39;t need to be a teen), which is <br/>
an AlAnon group for kids.  It gives them a head start on realizing this <br/>
drinking is not their doing, that they&#39;re not the only one in that situation, <br/>
and ways to feel better (and not to waste their time and energy trying to <br/>
&quot;fix&quot; the drunk).<br/>
