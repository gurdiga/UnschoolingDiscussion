I am sure others on this list will have some great sites for you ( I<br/>
look forward to seeing them myself) I have a personal favorite that you<br/>
may find useful. It is an essay by Marnie Ko called Life is an<br/>
Education. find it at<br/>

I hope I got that link right, I will double check it in a bit and repost<br/>
if it is wrong. Best wishes to you in your endeavor to show your husband<br/>
the many benifits of home education/unschooling. <br/>
