I am sure that if you are concerned about being a good parent then you are a<br/>
good parent.  A parent that loves their kids and honestly tries to do right<br/>
by them is almost always a good parent.<br/>
<br/>
If you love your kids they will feel it and know it,,,always.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds to me like you have a great relationship with them.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry you had a bad night last night and it is probably definately<br/>
effecting how you are feeling.  I think you just need a big hug.<br/>
<br/>
(((((((((((((((((((((   H U G )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps and it is okay on my part about parenting questions.<br/>
Parenting is a big part of unschooling I am sure.  Anyway it is all for the<br/>
kids, and isn&#39;t that why we are here?  For their best interests?<br/>

A few people were swearing by it. (I clicked on his name on the Amazon page<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m trying to grapple with my fears that my son will be <br/>
deprived academically from hours zoning out on TV. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wish you could cheaply and easily come and watch TV with my kids a couple <br/>
of days.  They&#39;re plenty expressive and talkative about what they&#39;re seeing.  <br/>
I think they would still be learning if they weren&#39;t chatty, but the fact <br/>
that they are makes a big picture window into their learning.<br/>
<br/>
The hours zoning out on TV won&#39;t deprive him academically if he&#39;s watching <br/>
things that interest him, with pictures of people, places, things which he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have seen otherwise, with music and dancing and sports he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have heard or seen otherwise, with costumes and equipment and animals and...<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s encouraged and not shamed, TV will seem bigger and better, too.<br/>
Parental encouragement is all that makes the difference between a toddler <br/>
exploring a park or being a bad boy who left the playground.  (Look! I&#39;ve <br/>
slipped right into a parenting discussion without intending to!)  When Kirby <br/>
was little he sat by me a lot.  He wanted me to set him on the swings and <br/>
push him.  He wanted me to watch him go down the slide.   Marty wanted to go <br/>
far and climb high.  So rather than telling him no, I would find older kids <br/>
to go with him and climb with him to help him down if necessary, or I would <br/>
follow behind him far enough that he had that feeling of being all alone in <br/>
the wide world, but he still wasn&#39;t out of sight of me.  Too many mom&#39;s, when <br/>
they say &quot;Don&#39;t go out of sight of me&quot; mean &quot;I&#39;m going to sit right here and <br/>
not move, and so that limits your range of movement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That limited range of movement can happen if a mom just wants to stay home <br/>
and not change any of her ways or beliefs or practices, too.  And if watching <br/>
TV for four hours is as bad as climbing up a hill looking for wild <br/>
strawberries even though there was no way to get lost, but the kid is told <br/>
&quot;bad&quot; anyway, there is sorrow where there didn&#39;t need to be any.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315936527">There&#39;s never been an aha moment for me. It&#39;s just been a series of little<br/>
aha blips in my schoolish mindset. Being of an engineering bent, I adore<br/>
linear, step by step learning. I love the feedback that a textbook gives --<br/>
getting the right answer and having a physical indication of progress<br/>
through the book -- and the feeling of completeness.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that saved my daughter from having that foisted on her was<br/>
that I&#39;d always wondered why learning in school had to be so dull. It was<br/>
satisfying in the sense of accomplishment it provided. But tedious. Watching<br/>
historical movies was fun and interesting. Reading history texts was sleep<br/>
inducing. (My mother thought the D in gym was amusing. &quot;How was it even<br/>
possible to get a D in gym?&quot; she wondered. ;-) And it *is* ridiculous. What<br/>
*really* is there to grade in gym? She didn&#39;t think D in history, the only<br/>
other D I ever got, was so amusing.)<br/>
<br/>
So, even though I read everything I could on AOL&#39;s homeschooling boards<br/>
while my daughter attended preschool, I hung around with the unschoolers for<br/>
fun because *they* were having so much fun. Their ideas on learning were way<br/>
too fuzzy for me. No one was working towards a particular academic goal. It<br/>
was &quot;just throw everything at the kids and see what comes out&quot;. Way too<br/>
unsettling for an engineer!<br/>
<br/>
And yet the theories behind unschooling started to make sense. (Sandra and<br/>
PamS were especially helpful :-) And I found I could actually explain it to<br/>
others even when I wasn&#39;t sure I totally bought it myself. I did<br/>
intellectually but it was ripping my poor engineering heart out ;-) But I&#39;m<br/>
also an artist -- an artist inhibited by engineering love of one right<br/>
answer -- so perhaps that part of my brain asserted itself and saved my<br/>
daughter from Calvert ;-)<br/>
