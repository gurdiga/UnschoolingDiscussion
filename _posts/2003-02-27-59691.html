****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

    Why is it you are so concerned with college and testing? My son, 17yo,<br/>
who has been school free since end of 4th grade just took the entrance exam<br/>
for a community college here. No problems. He starts the end of march. He&#39;s<br/>
doing what he wants, when he wants. Oh and I feel we did diddley sqaut since<br/>
1996 but have fun with our lives. ;-)<br/>

&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live.&quot;<br/>

  There have been many people have asked me about unschooling, college, and SAT&#39;s.  I was passing along information in case anyone here wanted it. <br/>
