&lt;&lt; I&#39;d buy one.  Rather - how about &quot;all children are indigo.&quot;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well if they ALL are, it&#39;s not worth having an indication. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to encourage them, personally.<br/>
There are other indications too.<br/>
Crystal Children.<br/>
Star Children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid if I really engaged their proponents in a discussion they might <br/>
say &quot;OBVIOUSLY you were a lump-of-coal child and so we mustn&#39;t regard your <br/>
non-seeing opinion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just really don&#39;t like discussions of giftedness when the parents are so <br/>
hopeful and boastful or martyrly [*sigh*, throw hair back, &quot;it is SO difficult, <br/>
having a gifted child&quot;  *sigh*]<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, I don&#39;t like them other times either.<br/>
<br/>
I think let people be happy and be their best selves and not sort them into <br/>
red-bumper-sticker-mom children and blue-bumper-sticker...<br/>
<br/>
(Kirby works where they sell many funny and tack bumper stickers. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, the many people I know you like the Indigo children idea <br/>
are open-minded wonderful people who wouldn&#39;t hold that sort of <br/>
judgement towards you.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that were the <br/>
case with the majority.<br/>
   The ones I know are also not like this....<br/>
