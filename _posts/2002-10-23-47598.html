<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760795017"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ****&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; How exactly do you approach a situation like this?  I have the hardest time<br/>
&gt; &gt; in public when I witness other parents being hurtful to their children (not<br/>
&gt; &gt; just through spanking but through belittling, saying hurtful things, etc).<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m always hesitant to, as you say, scold the parents because I&#39;m afraid<br/>
&gt; &gt; the kid will just get it even more once they get home for &quot;embarassing&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; their mother, or making her &quot;look bad.&quot;  Do you think that&#39;s possible?<br/>
&gt; &gt; That the mother will feel insulted and embarrassed and take it out on her<br/>
&gt; &gt; child even more later?  It seems I&#39;ve often heard that caution when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; comes to defending children that way.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Still, I want to come up with something to say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks, Patti, for asking the question I was about to. :) I feel like such a<br/>
&gt; useless LUMP when I see this stuff going on, I wouldn&#39;t mind some advice on<br/>
&gt; how to and when to say things, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the advice is, &quot;just grow a backbone and do it&quot;  I&#39;m okay with that.<br/>

&gt; A friend and I were shopping at the local Wal-mart in the clothing isles.  We looked over, saw an (approx.) 2 y/o standing<br/>
&gt; in the seat part of the cart.  So very unsafe.  The mother was turned the other direction, looking at a rack of something<br/>
&gt; or other.  We rushed over and said, &quot;oh sweetie, please sit down so you don&#39;t fall!&quot;  The mother looked at us with almost<br/>
&gt; an evil look and said, &quot;I had her standing there to hold these shirts up to her.  She is fine.&quot;  Whoa!  We thought we were<br/>
&gt; being completely helpful.  Being an x-ray tech, I have seen too many needless fractures in children because the parents<br/>
&gt; were inattentive.  Not to mention sometimes, just plain stupid.  We saw her again later, the child continuing to be a<br/>
&gt; monkey on the cart, balancing precariously, surely to fall any minute.  I don&#39;t know if she ever did injure herself, but<br/>
&gt; it made me very nervous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What to do then?  She wasn&#39;t &#39;abusing&#39; the child.  Just neglectful or maybe irresponsible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve stopped people on a few occasions from harming children, including<br/>
one woman who was hitting her child yelling at him &quot;hitting it not ok!&quot;<br/>
I was flabbergasted and in a split second I realized that I was probably<br/>
never going to see these people again (I was living in San Francisco at<br/>
the time - lots of people) so I screwed up my courage and asked her if<br/>
there was a problem and was there anything I could do to help.  It must<br/>
have been enough because she calmed down and stopped.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best thing is to be honest to yourself and &quot;grow and<br/>
backbone and do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

who spanked her youngest once and will probably never forgive herself<br/>
for it but has never done it again because I&#39;ve learned that being with<br/>
her and listening to her is much more effective.<br/>
