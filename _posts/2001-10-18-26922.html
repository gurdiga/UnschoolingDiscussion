Thirteen Eeeko-Halloween Decorations<br/>
<br/>
Below are thirteen suggestions for Halloween decorations you can make <br/>
with reused and recycled items. If buying decoration materials, try <br/>
using non-petroleum based and/or recycled products with minimal <br/>
packaging.<br/>
<br/>
SPIDERS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of buying plastic, petroleum based spiders, make fake spiders <br/>
and cockroaches out of rocks, pipecleaners, and paint. Collect rocks, <br/>
paint them black, and use non-toxic, water-based 3D fabric paint for <br/>
eyes. Attach and wrap pipe cleaners around the rock and leave enough <br/>
hanging off the edge to bend into legs. Paste these spiders to <br/>
everything! <br/>
<br/>
Take old string and paint it with non-toxic, glow-in-the-dark paint <br/>
to make a spider web. <br/>
<br/>
DINNERWARE AND CENTERPIECES<br/>
<br/>
Plates/Utensils/Glasses<br/>
To save trees and petroleum, avoid using plastic and paper plates, <br/>
cups and utensils. Instead, use real plates, or ask guests to bring <br/>
their own, perhaps with a theme matching their costumes. For example, <br/>
if a guest dresses as Mother Earth, he/she might bring a real plate <br/>
with a floral design. <br/>
<br/>
Black, Red, and Orange Candles<br/>
Conventional candles are often petroleum based. Pure Beeswax candles <br/>
set an eco-friendly Halloween mood, and the natural smell is mellow <br/>
and compelling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Creepy Crawly Vases<br/>
Glue spiders (see above) and Halloween shapes cut from fabric or <br/>
paper onto glass vases, mason jars, or plastic or terra cotta <br/>
flowerpots. Place big, dried twigs in the pots, and hang more spiders <br/>
from the twigs. One can even attach doll heads, or other doll body <br/>
parts found lying around the home. Adding cleaned and dried animal <br/>
bones (chicken, steak, etc.) also looks scary. <br/>
SKELETONS AND SCARY PEOPLE<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cardboard Skeleton<br/>
To avoid buying conventional plastic or virgin wood-based paper <br/>
skeletons, make one with old cardboard or posterboard, using an <br/>
anatomy or Halloween craft book for guidelines. Paint the skeleton <br/>
with non-toxic, glow-in-the-dark paint. Put a hat, some feathers, or <br/>
spiders on its head for decoration. <br/>
<br/>
Scary Stuffed Guy<br/>
Make a scary person by stuffing old clothes with newspaper, and use <br/>
an old mask (from goodwill or your attic) for a face. Splatter non-<br/>
toxic, water-based red paint on the figure to make him scarier, and <br/>
stick a knife in him somewhere. <br/>
<br/>
OTHER EFFECTS<br/>
<br/>
Hanging Tin Lanterns: <br/>
Used tins (soda cans, olive oil tins, large tomato sauce tin) make <br/>
interesting hanging lanterns. Cut faces into the tins with a strong <br/>
knife. Glue a beeswax candle in the bottom with a glue gun. Poke <br/>
holes near the lid of the tin and thread a metal wire through to hang <br/>
the lanterns. <br/>
<br/>
Vampire Repellant:<br/>
Hang garlic and crosses outside your front door. <br/>
<br/>
Abandoned Building:<br/>
<br/>
Board up windows with old plywood or cardboard painted like wood. <br/>
Attach spiders and maybe some green slime.<br/>
<br/>
Cover furniture with white sheets and place ghosts (made of sheets <br/>
and pillows) on them. Splatter nontoxic red ink or paint on the <br/>
sheets for the &quot;fresh blood&quot; look.<br/>
<br/>
Suspend old sheets or gauzy fabric from trees to look like ghosts. <br/>
Have a small radio in or next to a tree playing strange sounds (e.g. <br/>
someone screaming, moaning, or rattling chains). If using batteries, <br/>
make sure they are rechargeabl e.<br/>
<br/>
Write scary messages backwards on the windows and/or mirrors with bar <br/>
soap or lipstick.<br/>
<br/>
Take vines and drape them around the room. <br/>
Graveyard: Use handmade gravestones to make a graveyard outside your <br/>
house. Make gravestones with large rocks, old cereal boxes, or big <br/>
pieces of used styrofoam (do not buy it!) that you have shaped with a <br/>
sharp cutting tool. Paint the gravestones gray with a nontoxic, water-<br/>
based paint, and write guests&#39; names on them.</div>
