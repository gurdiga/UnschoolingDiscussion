<div id="ygrps-yiv-401334867">&quot;As Americans, we want our children to be better educated than <br/>
the Japanese.  So, the government has created a new mandatory level of <br/>
education - the Baby Genius school.  We will teach your baby to sit up, <br/>
crawl, walk, and talk, and toilet-train your toddler.  The government <br/>
has created classes for the following age groups:  the sitting class, 6 <br/>
months; the crawling class, seven months; the walking class, 11 months; <br/>
the talking class, 18 months.  Basic toilet training, 24 months; <br/>
advanced toilet training, 30 months.  Should your child fail to pass our <br/>
monthly examinations, he or she will be insulted and verbally abused <br/>
until he or she finally gets it.  Late graduation from our school will <br/>
result in rejection from entering prestigious pre-schools where children <br/>
will be taught to color in the lines and conform to government set <br/>
standards in order to prepare them for kindergarten.  This new law will <br/>
go into effect August 29th.  All babies must attend.  Those parents <br/>
wishing to homeschool their infants must complete all 40 pages of form <br/>
S-537 to register by August 29th.  Text books will be provided upon <br/>
request.  If approved, they will be visited monthly by an education <br/>
authority to make sure their child can pass the tests.  The parents then <br/>
reserve the right to be ridiculed by their parents, friends, and <br/>
neighbors for depriving their child of the right to an education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course I made this up.  It&#39;s not true at all.  Sometimes this is how <br/>
I feel our public school system is going.  What do you all think?<br/>
<br/>

     Ooooohhhh, another scary story.  I do agree that it sure seems like we <br/>
are headed that way.  I bet that is how Head Start got started!<br/>
