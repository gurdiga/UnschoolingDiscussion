<div id="ygrps-yiv-756240465">Hello Dads!! <br/>
<br/>
May 1, 2 &3 in the mountains near Johnson City, TN we are hosting our <br/>
1st Dads&#39; Weekend.  What is a Dads&#39; Weekend? Well we&#39;re not really <br/>
sure.  The Dads in NE TN had an idea to rent a cabin in the <br/>
beautiful mountains of TN and just hang out, talk about being an <br/>
unschooling Dad, how it&#39;s going, maybe some drinking, card games, <br/>
cycling, nerf gun tag (Scotty&#39;s fave)…whatever we all wanted to do.  <br/>
As the word spread, more and more Dads showed an interest so we <br/>
decided to invite all Dads.<br/>
<br/>
Accommodations:<br/>
Each cabin has 1 queen and 2 twin beds.  With blow-up beds on the <br/>
living room floor the cabins sleep 4-6.  Each cabin has a full <br/>
kitchen with plates, cups, etc and costs $114 a night. (Divided by 4 <br/>
not bad)  There are no TVs or phones.  Wireless internet is a ten <br/>
minute walk to the main building.  You will need to bring all your <br/>
own food and drink for the weekend.  The closest town in 20 minutes <br/>
away.<br/>
