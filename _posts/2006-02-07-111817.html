<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666192421">My son is heavy into programming his own games, so I just wanted to <br/>
share some resources we have used.<br/>
<br/>
Clickteam (http://www.clickteam.com) has tons of software for those <br/>
who want to get started creating games before learning the programming <br/>
involved. We started out with Klick and Play which you can download <br/>
here:<br/>
http://www.clickteam.com/English/download_main.php?PID=6<br/>
<br/>
It is a free download and a great introduction to programming basics <br/>
for the very beginner. He was able to use it when he was 8. <br/>
<br/>
Later, we graduated to the Games Factory(found on the same site), <br/>
which gives more options and is a little more advanced. The site also <br/>
has installation program creators so that you can can have an install <br/>
program for the games you create. My son used both the install maker <br/>
and games factory to create games which he burned onto disk and sold <br/>
to his friends for a dollar. He started his own software company, and <br/>
sold his games on his website (which he has taken down now).<br/>
<br/>
Later, he wanted to do web based games so we got him Flash which he <br/>
learned fairly easily after the intros provided by clickteam. It&#39;s a <br/>
bit pricey, but worth it if your budding developer wants to develop <br/>
web based games and is serious. There are tutorials all over the net <br/>
on how to use it.  It can be purchased here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/flashpro/<br/>
<br/>
Now we are looking for an intro into Visual Basic, so if anyone knows <br/>
of any download sites for the Visual Basic software I&#39;d appreciate it.</div>

 </span></blockquote>They do offer some *serious* discounts for educators! (Macromedia  <br/>
Studio which includes Dreamweaver (their WSWIG webpage designer),  <br/>
Flash, and Fireworks (art program) is over $600 but educators can get  <br/>
it for $199.)<br/>

<br/>
(If you click on &quot;qualified education end users&quot; it does mention  <br/>
homeschoolers.)<br/>
<br/>
They also list some authorized eduction resellers at:<br/>
