<div id="ygrps-yiv-822447845">This goes out to those taking the trip to NYC <br/>
which was posted Fri. 14th...<br/>
The weather here is cold and damp..just had alittle<br/>
snow, which makes the city mucky..<br/>
anyhow...it would be cheapest for you to stay<br/>
in NJ and take the train/bus in to explore..<br/>
look up /digitalcity.com then click onto northern<br/>
NJ..we are just a hop, skip, and a jump to the big<br/>
apple...Any of the hotels in Secaucus will get you<br/>
to the city by bus..try to find a place in Hoboken<br/>
NJ..then you can take the ferry over...<br/>
best of luck...hope the weather gets just alittle <br/>
more friendly for you...anyway....it should be exciting<br/>
no matter what...<br/>
have a safe trip,<br/>

Hoboken is where we went to go to the Statue of Liberty! It is MUCH quieter <br/>
than New York! LOL<br/>
