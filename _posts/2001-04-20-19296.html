&lt;&lt; She got really sad and talked to me<br/>
 for a long time about how much she WANTS to<br/>
 homeschool, how she feels SURE it&#39;s better for the<br/>
 kids, but she&#39;s single now, and she&#39;s going to college<br/>
 PLUS working at night. She says she knows she could<br/>
 work at night and homeschool during the day, but she<br/>
 feels that getting herself a better education and job<br/>
 will be better for them in the long run than if she<br/>
 homeschools them while working at her minimum wage<br/>
 job. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    During the rough moments in our history I have worried about this. I <br/>
would hope I could work and alternative job or nights. When I worked for a <br/>
period of time after dd was born I worked nights as a baker and made more <br/>
money than I did before dd. Even if I had my degree (3 semesters away) I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t find work in my field here. I am not moving.<br/>
<br/>
    All is well but life can change and I never want to take it for granted.<br/>
