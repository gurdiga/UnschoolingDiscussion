<div id="ygrps-yiv-930036564">I still struggle with some of the concepts of unschoolings. I thought<br/>
I would ask this question here.<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to come around to the idea that the care of the house is<br/>
my job, not my kids&#39;. They can help if they want, but that that&#39;s<br/>
their choice.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I have realized that housework stresses me out,<br/>
takes up too much of my time, and (surprise) I do not like it (Feeling<br/>
guilty for &quot;making&quot; my kids do  their chores for so long and making<br/>
them feel bad and ashamed for &quot;not liking it.&quot;). I would much rather<br/>
be available to my daughters (4 and 9) or work on my school work<br/>
(attending college) or writing a newsletter for my husband&#39;s    <br/>
business, exercising, or taking walks...<br/>
<br/>
So, it has occured to me that we could hire someone to clean our house<br/>
once a week. My husband agrees. There is only one problem. To be able<br/>
to pay for this, we would have to stop our weekly restaurant outings.<br/>
It&#39;s  OK with me and my husband. We are very interested in healthy<br/>
nutrition and we are both negatively affected by sugar, flour,<br/>
additives etc. It would be easire for us to adhere to our chosen diet<br/>
without the restaurant outings.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am anticipating that the girls will not like it. How do I make<br/>
this change without &quot;making&quot; them go along?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

First, the chores thing isn&#39;t &quot;a concept of unschooling.&quot;  It&#39;s more  <br/>
a parallel or extension.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238730893">Hmm you&#39;ve listed only two choices given here: stressing out about <br/>
housework OR giving up something to get housekeeping help. There are <br/>
lots more options than this. <br/>
<br/>
-For instance, what about having the housekeeping help only come in <br/>
once or twice a month to handle the &#39;big stuff&#39; like the bathrooms <br/>
and vacuuming and such while your family (you and DH, kids too) <br/>
manages the day to day dishes and laundry and taking the trash out <br/>
once a week (or twice depending on where you live). <br/>
-Can you scale down the dinners out - instead of Outback, maybe <br/>
Sonic, find buffet places or early bird dinner places, use credit <br/>
card &#39;points&#39; for restaurant coupons, etc?  Or maybe have <br/>
one &#39;upscale&#39; dinner out per month and go out for pizza, burgers, <br/>
sandwiches/subs the other weeks.<br/>
-Can you find other places to draw funds from? - maybe have fewer <br/>
meals with meat (if you eat meat to start with) since meats can be a <br/>
big chunk of $ in the grocery bill. <br/>
-Instead of a &#39;full professional&#39; look around for high school or <br/>
college students who would do the work either inexpensively or as <br/>
part of a barter deal (they cleanthe bathroom and vacuum the living <br/>
room while they have a load of laundry in your washer)<br/>
-look at your standards (individually and collectively) for the <br/>
house and see if there are places that can get scaled back - for <br/>
instance, does the carpet need to be vacuumed daily? can you do the <br/>
dusting twice a month instead of every other day? And so on. <br/>
Everyone&#39;s perspective on what is necessary varies - if you&#39;ve folks <br/>
with allergies, then dusting and vacuuming are important and maybe <br/>
it would be worthwhile to lose the carpet and get wood floors that <br/>
can be cleaned faster with just a broom (we&#39;ve just transitioned <br/>
from carpet to hardwood and it&#39;s so much easier to manage one <br/>
lightweight broom and start at the top of the house and sweep all <br/>
the way to the bottom and be done than it was to haul the vacuum <br/>
around, plug, unplug, empty, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Those are just a few items off the top of my head and I&#39;m sure you <br/>
guys could probably brainstorm more as well - once you&#39;ve got a nice <br/>
big list, then make a decision. It&#39;s not an either/or &#39;have to&#39; - <br/>
you&#39;ve got a whole realm of options available.<br/>

<br/>
You can talk to them about the possibility - in fact, explain what  <br/>
you want to do (hire a housecleaner) and ask them for ideas. They  <br/>
might surprise you and come up with the same one you came up with, or  <br/>
they might come up with another idea that will work. I wouldn&#39;t even  <br/>
tell them that you already think you &quot;have to&quot; eliminate your  <br/>
restaurant time. I&#39;d let them come up with ideas, you add to their  <br/>
list of ideas and include that one in the mix. I&#39;m sure, really sure,  <br/>
there are other possibilities that you&#39;ve considered and eliminated  <br/>
already, in your own mind. So put those other possibilities on the  <br/>
table, too. Make the decision together since it is something they  <br/>
like to do and would miss.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really think that is the truth. Taking care of the house is everyone<br/>
who lives in the houses responsibility - not job. You can be available to<br/>
your kids and get things done. Will you get everything done - every day? No.<br/>
probably not but then who does?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The first thing you have to do is change your thinking about housework.<br/>
Don&#39;t look at it as something negative, find a way to make it a positive<br/>
thing. I joined a list called FlyLady<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FlyLadyMentors">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FlyLadyMentors</a>&gt; . If you visit her website<br/>
FlyLady.net, you will see what it is all about. She really helped me see<br/>
that housework didn&#39;t have to be all work and then my son saw me having fun<br/>
and helps when he isn&#39;t sucked into other things. It is how he learned how<br/>
to count, match socks, sort colors, measure soap and time the loads. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to fold and I can&#39;t say that it is my favorite either but he<br/>
hands it to me and I fold.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Cleaning, we have learned, is always more fun if you have company. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Job&quot; is something with a start and a finish, and usually something  <br/>
one is paid for.<br/>
Housework doesn&#39;t have a start or a finish (unless one has contracted  <br/>
to do the floors and bathrooms, or whatever, as &quot;a job&quot; for pay).<br/>
<br/>
Responsibility cannot ever really be shared by a large group or  <br/>
family.  Someone is in charge.<br/>
Responsibility means someone needs to answer to someone else for  <br/>
whether it gets done.  A husband and a wife can share responsibility  <br/>
the same way they share a mortgage, because marriage is like a  <br/>
corporation.  The two become one in some legal ways. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the county comes and makes a sanitation claim (like you get a  <br/>
citation or official warning in writing about something like junk in  <br/>
your yard, or unsanitary conditions), that is NOT the  <br/>
&quot;responsibility&quot; of children, but of the homeowner or the lease  <br/>
holder or renter.   The parents are responsible.  The children don&#39;t  <br/>
equally own the house, and if someone DOES have a house in the name  <br/>
of a minor child, someone is the guardian and it&#39;s his or her  <br/>
responsibility to make sure DOUBLY that the house is maintained to  <br/>
meet safety standards, city statutes, and to some extent to maintain  <br/>
the value of the property.  That legal guardian would be responsible  <br/>
(literally) to the courts if they aren&#39;t doing a good job taking care  <br/>
of the children and property entrusted to their care.<br/>
<br/>
Responsibility has a real meaning.   And minor children don&#39;t have  <br/>
&quot;responsibility&quot; unless the parents have made up some rules and  <br/>
punishments, and &quot;made the child responsible (answerable)&quot; to the  <br/>
parent.<br/>

I wanted to second the FlyLady recommendation - www.flylady.net .  Being on<br/>
the list and reading the steady stream of emails helped me to realize that<br/>
housework wasn&#39;t the huge job I had made it out to be.  It also helped me to<br/>
see how deeply housework and judgments of self were intertwined, and it<br/>
prompted me to get to work on separating that out and realizing what is<br/>
truly important. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, the language is beyond hokey sometimes, but underneath it all it&#39;s very<br/>
helpful.  The condition of my house just isn&#39;t such a big deal anymore<br/>
because I know how to deal with it calmly, efficiently and without judgment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201323472">Well, no matter your definition of responsibility, we share it. There are<br/>
times that my son decided that something needs cleaned up. He will say we<br/>
need to clean this place up - usually meaning the living room because he<br/>
wants to vacuum. We have a tiny shark vac bought because he likes to vacuum<br/>
and it is the perfect size for any small child. Also, he will notice that<br/>
the dishes need done and ask if he can do them which usually leads to us<br/>
scrubbing the kitchen floor because he gets water every where and we clean<br/>
it up. We turn boring tasks into fun games like racing sponges across the<br/>
floor or timer pick-up where we set the timer for 15 minutes or play a funny<br/>
song and see how much we can pick-up before it goes off.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He takes equal part in what goes on in the house and he gets equal say when<br/>
there is a decision to be made. It is part of the democratic schooling<br/>
philosophy that takes the next step in unschooling. Usually it is in a<br/>
democratic school and like unschooling you don&#39;t truly understand unless you<br/>
see it work for yourself. My son doesn&#39;t go to a democratic school but we<br/>
have several friends that do and some of those that teach there have talked<br/>
about how they also use the same approach at home.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sandra is right though that the adults take the ultimate responsibility. If<br/>
something doesn&#39;t get done it falls to me or my DH to get it done. He is 5<br/>
1/2 and he does more then we expect him to do. There are times just like<br/>
everyone else in my house that he doesn&#39;t want to do anything but play with<br/>
his blocks all day and that is exactly that. Just like some days I feel like<br/>
reading all day or DH wants to play a PC game all day. Mind you me and DH do<br/>
get up to take care of kids and if we think about it run a load of laundry<br/>
but some days as little as possible getting done is the order of the day.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
No matter what you call the tasks needed to run a household - my point was<br/>
not to look at them negatively but to turn them into something else -<br/>
FlyLady calls them a Parade of Daily Adventures. If you look at the thinks<br/>
we have to do as things we get to do and find a way to make them more fun<br/>
like doing them together when you can. The household tasks can be done by<br/>
the whole family like they were way back when - a family that stays together<br/>
stays together. In a world that has so many things that distracts and<br/>
separates us it is good to get back to basics and make household tasks<br/>
family tasks when you can.<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] literal meaning of responsibility<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t really think that is the truth. Taking care of the house is  <br/>
&gt; everyone<br/>
&gt; who lives in the houses responsibility - not job.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Job&quot; is something with a start and a finish, and usually something  <br/>
one is paid for.<br/>
Housework doesn&#39;t have a start or a finish (unless one has contracted  <br/>
to do the floors and bathrooms, or whatever, as &quot;a job&quot; for pay).<br/>
<br/>
Responsibility cannot ever really be shared by a large group or  <br/>
family.  Someone is in charge.<br/>
Responsibility means someone needs to answer to someone else for  <br/>
whether it gets done.  A husband and a wife can share responsibility  <br/>
the same way they share a mortgage, because marriage is like a  <br/>
corporation.  The two become one in some legal ways. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the county comes and makes a sanitation claim (like you get a  <br/>
citation or official warning in writing about something like junk in  <br/>
your yard, or unsanitary conditions), that is NOT the  <br/>
&quot;responsibility&quot; of children, but of the homeowner or the lease  <br/>
holder or renter.   The parents are responsible.  The children don&#39;t  <br/>
equally own the house, and if someone DOES have a house in the name  <br/>
of a minor child, someone is the guardian and it&#39;s his or her  <br/>
responsibility to make sure DOUBLY that the house is maintained to  <br/>
meet safety standards, city statutes, and to some extent to maintain  <br/>
the value of the property.  That legal guardian would be responsible  <br/>
(literally) to the courts if they aren&#39;t doing a good job taking care  <br/>
of the children and property entrusted to their care.<br/>
<br/>
Responsibility has a real meaning.   And minor children don&#39;t have  <br/>
&quot;responsibility&quot; unless the parents have made up some rules and  <br/>
punishments, and &quot;made the child responsible (answerable)&quot; to the  <br/>
parent.<br/>

The closest &quot;democratic schools&quot; I&#39;ve seen are generally about as  <br/>
token-democracy as public high schools with student councils and  <br/>
all.  When students have an equal say in how funds are spent and  <br/>
whether a roof is repaired or not, etc., it&#39;s equal because the  <br/>
owners of the building and those who have accepted responsibility and  <br/>
who accept money from parents have divied up their &quot;power&quot; and shared  <br/>
it out.  They can&#39;t give it all away.<br/>
<br/>

responsibility.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Adults don&#39;t generally &quot;take&quot; the responsibility to be parents, they  <br/>
are given the responsibility by others.  I am responsible to my  <br/>
husband, to the county and city I live in, to the federal government  <br/>
and the state government in various small and large ways.  I am  <br/>
responsible to my children, and if I were to fail in those  <br/>
responsibilities, it would make me an irresponsible person.  I would  <br/>
lose respect, integrity, reliability—all the good stuff—if I didn&#39;t  <br/>
do what others expected me to do, or at least negotiate with them  <br/>
about what I am willing and intend to do (when appropriate, like  <br/>
homeschooling instead of enrolling kids in school, and claiming an  <br/>
exemption for something, or requesting special permits or variances.<br/>
<br/>

I don&#39;t know what you meant by this exactly, but unschooling doesn&#39;t  <br/>
lead to a &quot;democratic schooling philosophy.&quot;<br/>

Subject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] baffled<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The first thing you have to do is change your thinking about housework.<br/>
Don&#39;t look at it as something negative, find a way to make it a positive<br/>
thing. I joined a list called FlyLady<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FlyLadyMentors">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FlyLadyMentors</a>&gt; . If you visit her website<br/>
FlyLady.net, you will see what it is all about. She really helped me see<br/>
that housework didn&#39;t have to be all work and then my son saw me having fun<br/>
and helps when he isn&#39;t sucked into other things. It is how he learned how<br/>
to count, match socks, sort colors, measure soap and time the loads. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to fold and I can&#39;t say that it is my favorite either but he<br/>
hands it to me and I fold.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to second the FlyLady recommendation - www.flylady.net .  Being on<br/>
the list and reading the steady stream of emails helped me to realize that<br/>
housework wasn&#39;t the huge job I had made it out to be.  It also helped me to<br/>
see how deeply housework and judgments of self were intertwined, and it<br/>
prompted me to get to work on separating that out and realizing what is<br/>
truly important. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, the language is beyond hokey sometimes, but underneath it all it&#39;s very<br/>
helpful.  The condition of my house just isn&#39;t such a big deal anymore<br/>
because I know how to deal with it calmly, efficiently and without judgment.<br/>

Actually, we are looking at moving because he wants a dog and where we are<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If he wants to wait a month on paying the rent or mortgage payment,  <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He has asked to skip paying the bills so that he could buy this or that and<br/>
we have explained to him that if we don&#39;t pay the bills this month that they<br/>
will turn off the electricity, the water or take away the car or house. Then<br/>
we ask him if he still thinks that it is a good idea if we use money to pay<br/>
the bills to buy something he wants. He is smart and will say &quot;no, I guess<br/>
that isn&#39;t a good idea but can we start saving money to buy...&quot; whatever he<br/>
wants. We will discuss how we can save and if there are things we can cut<br/>
back on for a short period of time to save the money faster.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot; The closest &quot;democratic schools&quot; I&#39;ve seen are generally about as  <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what one is closet to you... if you want to see a democratic<br/>
school that really works well... go to PA and visit the Circle Schoo or if<br/>
you are in VA I suggest Blue Ridge. If you head overseas, let me know there<br/>
are some that beat US hands down. I can even suggest some people to meet<br/>
since we have friends there. In PA and the one in VA the land is in trust -<br/>
no one &quot;owns&quot; it. Each person regardless of age is given equal vote, respect<br/>
and responsibility for self and other.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say that each school is run the way the founders intended. I haven&#39;t<br/>
been to each and every one of them but I can tell you the way the founders<br/>
intended them to run. I am a member of SOL (School of Living), AERO (The<br/>
Alternative Education Resource Organization) and a co-editor for the GR<br/>
(Green Revolution). Either last year or the year before at IDEC<br/>
(International Democratic Education Conference) one of the speakers was a<br/>
daughter of one of the founder of the Sudbury Model which she mentioned was<br/>
founded on the same ideals as unschooling. She talked how they had wanted to<br/>
take unschooling to the next level by giving children equal say and equal<br/>
vote.<br/>

<br/>
The closest &quot;democratic schools&quot; I&#39;ve seen are generally about as  <br/>
<br/>
token-democracy as public high schools with student councils and  <br/>
<br/>
all.  When students have an equal say in how funds are spent and  <br/>
<br/>
whether a roof is repaired or not, etc., it&#39;s equal because the  <br/>
<br/>
owners of the building and those who have accepted responsibility and  <br/>
<br/>
who accept money from parents have divied up their &quot;power&quot; and shared  <br/>
<br/>
it out.  They can&#39;t give it all away.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Adults don&#39;t generally &quot;take&quot; the responsibility to be parents, they  <br/>
<br/>
are given the responsibility by others.  I am responsible to my  <br/>
<br/>
husband, to the county and city I live in, to the federal government  <br/>
<br/>
and the state government in various small and large ways.  I am  <br/>
<br/>
responsible to my children, and if I were to fail in those  <br/>
<br/>
responsibilities, it would make me an irresponsible person.  I would  <br/>
<br/>
lose respect, integrity, reliability-all the good stuff-if I didn&#39;t  <br/>
<br/>
do what others expected me to do, or at least negotiate with them  <br/>
<br/>
about what I am willing and intend to do (when appropriate, like  <br/>
<br/>
homeschooling instead of enrolling kids in school, and claiming an  <br/>
<br/>
exemption for something, or requesting special permits or variances.<br/>

Not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
A good substitute for those who don&#39;t want to unschool, for whatever  <br/>
reason, but most definitely not the &quot;next level.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If anything, unschooling is the next level - democratic or free  <br/>
schools pre-date unschooling. Summerhill started in 1921! Sudbury  <br/>
Valley, in MA, started in 1968. John Holt didn&#39;t begin writing about  <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling until the mid 70&#39;s.<br/>

housework done better. A mom taking on the attitude that housework  <br/>
belongs to everyone will not yield a home full of happy helpers.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly it&#39;s hard to find information about parenting that *isn&#39;t*  <br/>
about imposing &quot;responsibilities&quot; on children so *that* we&#39;ve all  <br/>
heard before. &quot;Imposing responsibiities&quot; leads to resentful children.  <br/>
(As if we could impose responsibilities. The concept really beats the  <br/>
crap out of the meaning of responsibilities!)<br/>
<br/>
But if you do have a respectful relationship with your son, if, as a  <br/>
side effect, he does help happily and knows that he could choose not  <br/>
to help, then discussing that could help others unschool better. For  <br/>
your words to help others *unschool* better you&#39;ll need to dig deeper  <br/>
into your philosophy and your practices to describe your relationship  <br/>
with your son rather than presenting your attitude towards housework  <br/>
if that makes sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505581448">We have a large family, and believe it or not, the messes/housework is NOT  <br/>
that big a deal, because we have all begun doing better at putting our own <br/>
stuff  away.<br/>
 <br/>
As far as housework, getting all the nitty-gritty cleaning stuff can almost  <br/>
be done in half a day...toilet cleaning, bathtub, dusting, vaccuming, etc,  <br/>
especially if you&#39;re not a picky person.  :o)   I don&#39;t clean  when I&#39;m tired, <br/>
or cranky, because that tends to bring out the pity party in  myself.  <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll clean while the kids are still sleeping, or gone  for the day.  <br/>
 <br/>
In our home, I realized that the bulk of the mess was everyone getting  stuff <br/>
out, and leaving it there for someone else to pick up.  I don&#39;t mind  messes, <br/>
and projects, at all.  But it helped to talk with the kids about  coming home <br/>
and flinging their jackets on the ground instead of hanging them,  leaving <br/>
toys out, not putting their dishes in the dish washer, etc.  It&#39;s  not a matter <br/>
of having &quot;jobs&quot; or chores, it&#39;s just love and respect for each  other.  I <br/>
usually don&#39;t even have to remind someone, because another child  will remind <br/>
them instead. <br/>
 <br/>
I like in the book, &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen, and Listen so  Kids <br/>
Will Talk&quot; the idea of using one word to help motivate;   &quot;Kelsey...jacket.&quot;  <br/>
There is a chapter on how to enlist help without  nagging or putting guilt on a <br/>
kid too.  Instead of saying, &quot;Bill, you left  the milk out again, you are <br/>
always doing this!  What&#39;s wrong with  you!&quot;...you don&#39;t even say the child&#39;s name, <br/>
and instead make a comment like,  &quot;milk goes bad when it&#39;s left out.&quot;  You <br/>
are not accusing or pointing  fingers, instead, you&#39;re giving information.  It <br/>
really, really  works.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyhow, just saying that getting everyone to pick up their own things,  IMO, <br/>
isn&#39;t wrong.  It&#39;s just teaching a child kindness and respect for each  other. <br/>
 That will leave a lot more time for moms or dads to rush through  and get <br/>
the real cleaning done, or make it possible for the cleaning people to  come <br/>
less.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322867958">Oh...one more thing! :o)<br/>
 <br/>
I noticed that when my kids started getting older and having friends come  <br/>
over much more, they took a greater interest in helping keep things clean, and  <br/>
often straightened or vaccumed or loaded the dishwasher, wipe things down, etc <br/>
 when their company comes.  We usually all pitch in a little bit when  one <br/>
child&#39;s friend is coming over, and in turn, when EACH child has someone  coming <br/>
over we all do a quick 5 minute pick up.  No biggy.<br/>

aware of taking care of their own things and of every other aspect of  <br/>
what&#39;s good and helpful and right and forward-thinking.<br/>
<br/>
As kids get older if they&#39;re feeling the weight of years of pressure  <br/>
and shame and rules, though, they can sometimes be reactive teens who  <br/>
purposely or unconsciously do things they KNOW will be obstructionist  <br/>
because they have no other good way to express themselves, and they  <br/>
express themselves in ways that cause the rift between them and their  <br/>
parents to be even wider; then they move out or get pushed out.<br/>
<br/>
 From what I&#39;ve seen, with unschooling things just get better.<br/>
<br/>
Deb, that post was really good.  Pam Sorooshian does the one word  <br/>
thing well at her house.  I do the &quot;This isn&#39;t good for the [item]&quot;  <br/>
messages, into the air, as I put them in better places.   Another  <br/>
thing I developed was not to make things personal, but to generalize  <br/>
them, like yesterday Holly was eating cinnamon crispas from Taco  <br/>
Bell, and she was eating one with her mouth open.  I said it bothered  <br/>
me, but I also added in a moment (wishing I&#39;d said that first) that  <br/>
some people, or lots of people, are bothered by that noise.  The  <br/>
conversation flowed by and it was friendly and funny, so I can&#39;t  <br/>
quote me now; sorry.   If Holly thought *I* was personally and  <br/>
individually bothered by it but I might be the only one in the world,  <br/>
she would have different information than if I point out that it&#39;s  <br/>
something that bothers some unknown percentage of people in general.<br/>

Because talking wtih my kids in this way (How to Talk so kids...etc) was so  <br/>
foreign to me at first, I took my book and copied just the comics in it, and  <br/>
stapled them together.  At least once a month, I&#39;ll pull the &quot;comics&quot; out  and <br/>
read through them...takes about 10 or 15 minutes, just to refresh.  If  I&#39;m <br/>
feeling like I am especially snippy at the kids, I&#39;ll pull them out  again.  It <br/>
really helps to keep those ideas fresh in my head.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, that is how we decide anything and we discuss the consequences of our<br/>
actions like not paying bills on time. Yes, we may not get kicked out right<br/>
away but it spirals from just one missed payment. Not paying your bills on<br/>
time is not a calculated risk it is stupid. Unfortunately many people think<br/>
they can live from pay check to pay check, spend, spend, spend, charge,<br/>
charge, charge - without concern. My family models better behavior - we have<br/>
no charge cards, we live within our means and save for the things we want.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;But no matter what the form of a school, it&#39;s not &quot;the next level&quot; of<br/>
unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And as I have said all the Democrat schools are not equal - some are better<br/>
then others and to see a good one work is to understand how it was meant to<br/>
be run. It is the democrat principles applied at home that I referred to -<br/>
teachers and friends that teach or volunteer as well as parents of students<br/>
at the schools have adapted to their home life. And yes, the speaker said<br/>
that democratic principles took unschooling to the next level. If you<br/>
disagree, that is fine. in ways I see your point and in others I see her<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even the most unschooling family has some rules or guidelines. No matter<br/>
what you call them they are there.<br/>

I think it&#39;s important to be honest with kids and not make convenient  <br/>
statements like that if you miss a payment they throw you out.  That  <br/>
just plainly isn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has a huge medical emergency, or if the breadwinner is  <br/>
flatly DOWN (as Keith was for three weeks last April, one week of  <br/>
which he was in the hospital in very, very serious condition, and  <br/>
them no closer to knowing what was really wrong), and a housepayment  <br/>
is missed, the family is NOT thrown out of the house.   I would never  <br/>
tell my kids such a thing because it makes the world seem scarier  <br/>
than it is.<br/>
<br/>
My family models better behavior in the area of clarity and  <br/>
truthfulness, maybe (by my gauge of those things).<br/>
<br/>
And your family doesn&#39;t model better behavior than mine does in  <br/>
paying bills either.  Our bills are paid.  Even when Keith was in the  <br/>
hospital, our bills were paid.  Had he been unconscious for any  <br/>
length of time I wouldn&#39;t have thought about utility bills for a  <br/>
heartbeat, because I *know* from the experience of others around me  <br/>
that it will be two full months before they even threaten to turn off  <br/>
utilities.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Not paying your bills on<br/>
time is not a calculated risk it is stupid.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is not a statement of fact, it is a statement of judgmental  <br/>
emotion.  Let&#39;s talk about what is, rather than what we want to label  <br/>
and condemn things as being, please.  It&#39;s a discussion list, and so  <br/>
principles of productive discussion are very important.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;But no matter what the form of a school, it&#39;s not &quot;the next  <br/>
level&quot; of<br/>
unschooling.&quot;<br/>
-=-And as I have said all the Democrat schools are not equal --=-<br/>
<br/>
No school is unschooling.  This list is about unschooling, not about  <br/>
free schools, democratic schools, alternative-extravaganza-charter- <br/>
open-classroom schools.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is the democrat principles applied at home that I referred to -<br/>
teachers and friends that teach or volunteer as well as parents of  <br/>
students<br/>
at the schools have adapted to their home life-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cutting kids in on decision making is fantastic.<br/>
Trying to impose &quot;responsibility&quot; on children who do not legally or  <br/>
socially have literal responsibility (nor CAN a child under various  <br/>
certain ages be considered legally reponsible) is not even cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Over the past two days we&#39;ve had Cameron and Duncan Lovejoy, who are  <br/>
18 and 9.  We&#39;ve discussed their rules for calling &quot;Shotgun&quot; and o  <br/>
urs.  Sometimes theirs conflict with ours.  We don&#39;t really care,  <br/>
because Holly is often the only kid in the car anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Holly explained Kirby&#39;s rules, when he&#39;s driving, which involve not  <br/>
calling it before Kirby says it&#39;s time to go, or heads to the van,  <br/>
and the person has to be able to see the van.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little we had a rotation.  It wasn&#39;t for  <br/>
&quot;shotgun.&quot;  It was for having the first pick of seats.  Sometimes  <br/>
someone wanted the window behind the driver, but whoever&#39;s &quot;turn&quot; it  <br/>
was got to pick.  Rotation went from younger to older.   We had sub  <br/>
clauses about whether it counted if you were  the only kid in the car  <br/>
(it didn&#39;t) or what if you missed a turn (you might trade with the  <br/>
next one up, or let it go... depends on the kid&#39;s age and mood, so I  <br/>
guess it wasn&#39;t a rule &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
More recently we work on the principle that if it&#39;s someone&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;trip&quot; (like Holly to the orthodontist, or like earlier today,  <br/>
Cameron to the airport) then that person for whom the drive is being  <br/>
made gets to choose where to sit.  Those who are just going along for  <br/>
the ride can&#39;t call shotgun.  (On the way home Duncan called shotgun  <br/>
and that was fine.)<br/>

We&#39;ve gone without cards before, and it honestly cost us more.  We  were not <br/>
able to purchase things online which were really good deals (amazon,  etc) and <br/>
had to pay more at bookstores.  Or when something REALLY good came  up on <br/>
Ebay, and I didn&#39;t have the cash in my paypal account, I&#39;ve used credit  cards <br/>
then paid them off a month or two later.  And although the interest  sucks, <br/>
they&#39;ve saved us quite a few times when emergencies came  up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206776559">My brother works for an eccentric millionaire who runs a car racing  <br/>
company. They travel all over the country all winter for races. One  <br/>
of my brother&#39;s jobs is renting cars and hotel rooms for 10-12 guys  <br/>
at a time, and paying for expenses incurred on trips. The eccentric  <br/>
millionaire won&#39;t use credit cards, so my brother sometimes finds  <br/>
himself carrying tens of thousands of dollars in cash--or having to  <br/>
call the bank and have $20,000 Fed-Exed to wherever they are (can you  <br/>
imagine? It&#39;s like something from a movie). It amuses my brother--he  <br/>
likes showing us how high a stack 30k in hundreds makes. But it also  <br/>
inconveniences him and worries him.<br/>
<br/>
Su<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Just to try to bring this back on-topic &lt;g&gt;, I do talk about my  <br/>
brother when people think their kids have &quot;impractical&quot; passions. I  <br/>
can remember Gary drawing racing cars over and over when we were  <br/>
kids. He restored an old Mustang convertible when we were teenagers.   <br/>
He became an auto technician (a 2-year degree) and worked for a long  <br/>
time for GM Performance Parts, the division that makes parts for  <br/>
racing cars. Through that connection he met the eccentric millionaire  <br/>
and ended up working for him. Now he&#39;s got his dream job and is as  <br/>
happy as a pig in sh-t. He&#39;s not a race car driver, which maybe would  <br/>
have been his first choice, but he&#39;s in the thick of things in a  <br/>
profession he has loved since he was a kid.<br/>

they&#39;ve saved us quite a few times when emergencies came  up. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We use credit cards for a couple of regular payments, such as our health<br/>
insurance, that we absolutely do not want to miss. Then we pay the card off<br/>
in full with each statement. That is a good way both to have a convenient<br/>
record of expenses, and to avoid the interest charges. It is nice to be free<br/>
of debt in general.<br/>
<br/>
Dh uses American Express for his major business equipment purchases and<br/>
rentals. This is money that he would be spending anyway, and he gets the<br/>
reward points/miles. Again we plan for and pay the full amount off each<br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is pretty much always around when I am &quot;doing the bills&quot; each month,<br/>
although I think she sees it as a regular nuisance. I love the convenience<br/>
of the computer. Internet banking lets me keep track daily, if I want to. <br/>

I&#39;d rather be carrying a debit card in my purse than a pile of cash to the<br/>
supermarket. I&#39;ve lost my purse about 4 times in my life - I only lost about<br/>
5 bucks last time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892293964">&quot;Different families have different favorite values and virtues.<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to be honest with kids and not make convenient  <br/>
statements like that if you miss a payment they throw you out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am sorry, I shorted myself again. What we told him was that if we didn&#39;t<br/>
pay our payment for the house that they would take they house away from us.<br/>
However, he has already seen a friend of ours evicted and that is exactly<br/>
what they did - they took all of his stuff and dumped it out on the front<br/>
lawn. It was because he did live from pay check to pay check and when he<br/>
lost his job he had no emergency money to fall back on. I won&#39;t draw out all<br/>
the whole story but he has gotten back on his feet and learning to spend<br/>
money more wisely.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If someone has a huge medical emergency, or if the breadwinner is flatly<br/>
DOWN&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I realize that medical emergencies happen but those are called emergencies.<br/>
In an emergency, yes bills will get missed and often bill collectors will<br/>
work with you and be patient about a missed payment here or there and allow<br/>
you to catch up later. When we were talking to DS, we were talking about the<br/>
consequence of not paying the bills. He asked, &quot;what happens if we don&#39;t pay<br/>
for the house or lights?&quot; and I replied that &quot;The bank would eventually be<br/>
forced to take the house away from us and the electric company would turn<br/>
our lights off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is not a statement of fact, it is a statement of judgmental emotion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You are right and I am VERY sorry. I have had a bad day today. One of my<br/>
dear friends lost her husband and two of her children in an accident. The<br/>
third is in critical condition and we don&#39;t know if she is going to make it.<br/>
I did not express myself clearly. Not paying your bills on time can have<br/>
serious repercussions that impact your credit rating. The first time you<br/>
miss a bill payment they can make a report to the credit bureau. Which I<br/>
admit some people may not value but for those who are looking to buy a home,<br/>
a car or anything else that does have a substantial monetary value it is<br/>
important to the person who will be loaning you the money.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This list is about unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You are right, enough said.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Cutting kids in on decision making is fantastic. Trying to impose<br/>
&quot;responsibility&quot; on children who do not legally or  <br/>
socially have literal responsibility (nor CAN a child under various certain<br/>
ages be considered legally reponsible) is not even cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree totally.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ideas about living by principle instead of rules in families is here&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, like I said. No matter what you call them. I mean I don&#39;t go around<br/>
tell DS that such and such is against the rules. We don&#39;t really have rules<br/>
the way some families do. I let him know that I can&#39;t let him hurt his<br/>
sister anymore then I allow his sister to hurt him. something like that. We<br/>
make requests about being quite when someone is sleeping or have a headache.<br/>
Not that he isn&#39;t allowed to talk but he needs to do it with a quieter<br/>
voice. He often needs reminded as does his father unless it is his father<br/>
that has the headache. Reminders are just that reminders told to whomever<br/>
like it was the first time that day.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just want to thank those of you who challenge me and make me rethink the<br/>
way we do things at home that show me there is a better way to think and<br/>
help me unlearn the schooly words that have been ingrained in our society.<br/>

Different families have different favorite values and virtues.<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to be honest with kids and not make convenient  <br/>
statements like that if you miss a payment they throw you out.  That  <br/>
just plainly isn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has a huge medical emergency, or if the breadwinner is  <br/>
flatly DOWN (as Keith was for three weeks last April, one week of  <br/>
which he was in the hospital in very, very serious condition, and  <br/>
them no closer to knowing what was really wrong), and a housepayment  <br/>
is missed, the family is NOT thrown out of the house.   I would never  <br/>
tell my kids such a thing because it makes the world seem scarier  <br/>
than it is.<br/>
<br/>
My family models better behavior in the area of clarity and  <br/>
truthfulness, maybe (by my gauge of those things).<br/>
<br/>
And your family doesn&#39;t model better behavior than mine does in  <br/>
paying bills either.  Our bills are paid.  Even when Keith was in the  <br/>
hospital, our bills were paid.  Had he been unconscious for any  <br/>
length of time I wouldn&#39;t have thought about utility bills for a  <br/>
heartbeat, because I *know* from the experience of others around me  <br/>
that it will be two full months before they even threaten to turn off  <br/>
utilities.<br/>

This is not a statement of fact, it is a statement of judgmental  <br/>

principles of productive discussion are very important.<br/>
<br/>
