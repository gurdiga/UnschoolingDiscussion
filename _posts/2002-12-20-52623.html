<div id="ygrps-yiv-801698843">Hi All,<br/>
  I&#39;d appreciate a little feedback. My son (age 5) is very interested in <br/>
animals and sea creatures so when the zoo here offered a class for <br/>
homeschoolers on ocean creatures, I asked him if he&#39;d like to go. He said <br/>
yes. Our first class was today and he seemed comfortable there. Anyways, <br/>
apparently he was wandering around the room instead of sitting quietly and he <br/>
was listening to the teacher. The teacher suggested that next time I stay in <br/>
the room, presumably to keep him in his seat. I would like him to stay in the <br/>
class as he is interested in the subject and as long as he isn&#39;t disruptive, <br/>
I don&#39;t see why he can&#39;t stand or wander. (By the way, the class is K-2nd <br/>
grade and he&#39;s the youngest and I do get the feeling that most of the kids do <br/>
school-at-home.) Any thoughts?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As an unschooler in a world hostile to unschoolers &lt;g&gt;, I run interference <br/>
for my kid in school-like situations as much as possible.  At 5 I would have <br/>
never let him go to a class without me in the room.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I think he&#39;s so fragile or whatever.  It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t <br/>
want him to pick up on the idea that his way of learning is inferior to the <br/>
school model, or that he can&#39;t own his own learning.  I certainly don&#39;t want <br/>
him to get the idea that any worksheet or other activity they ask him to do <br/>
has any bearing on his worth as a human being.  <br/>
<br/>
My son attends the monthly homeschool science day at the science museum.  <br/>
Since he&#39;s 9, and most of his friends are, I put him in the lower age group <br/>
class (1-3 grade).  Most of the other moms chose the upper age group for <br/>
their kids.  He was disappointed that he wasn&#39;t with his friends, and the <br/>
classes were full so the museum wouldn&#39;t let him move up.  But he enjoyed it <br/>
anyway and didn&#39;t complain.  <br/>
<br/>
So, one of his friends who doesn&#39;t read yet dropped out of the upper classes <br/>
altogether and so we asked if my son could take his place.  He came out of <br/>
there so disappointed!  He had a worksheet in his hand, and was complaining <br/>
about how stupid it was and that the teacher went too fast when she told him <br/>
what to write on it.  He was really frustrated.  I asked him if he wanted the <br/>
worksheet, and he said no.  So I took it and crumpled it up and I said &quot;this <br/>
worksheet means nothing. You never have to do them if you don&#39;t want to, <br/>
ever.  It&#39;s simply a way for an uncreative teacher to make herself think <br/>
she&#39;s getting through to you some way.  Did you learn anything about what she <br/>
was saying?&quot;  yes.  &quot;Then you don&#39;t need a worksheet to tell you that.  Do <br/>
you want to go back to the older class next time?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.  They don&#39;t do anything fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I insulted the teacher, and in the midst of a whole bunch of other <br/>
homeschool moms milling about, too.  But my kid having *that* kind of <br/>
frustration warranted a strong affirmation from me that he was right.  <br/>

In other words, find out what her minimum standard of behavior is.  And make<br/>
sure you point out how much he learned while wandering around the room<br/>
instead of sitting.  If she insists that he stay seated the whole time, then<br/>
he might choose to not continue with the class.<br/>

We have an art group at the museum of art and I do the same thing there.  I <br/>

in the younger group they give them the tools and let them have at it.  That <br/>
seems like art to me and the boys love it.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking. I&#39;m going to mention he really was listening while <br/>
he was wandering and that as long as he isn&#39;t being disruptive to just leave <br/>
him alone. I saw what they talked about as far as information and it&#39;s <br/>
totally not over his head so I know that wasn&#39;t the problem. He did mention <br/>
to me that he didn&#39;t want to just sit there and listen, he wanted to be out <br/>
in the aquarium. They spent some time in the classroom and some time out in <br/>
the zoo. He was excited that he got to pet an armadillo, though! <br/>

what kind of hands-on activities does she/he have for the kids. Talk <br/>
to this person about your child&#39;s learning style (this is normal <br/>
behaviour for a 5 year old boy). Still, if this person asks for you <br/>
to stay, you could take it as an opportunity for your child to <br/>
practice sitting and listening for an X amount of minutes --but that <br/>
would turn the class into something else.<br/>
<br/>
In most of these cases, though, the teacher is just ill trained in <br/>
dealing with young kids. I am sure he is disruptive to the teacher <br/>
and not the other kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403087906">Are you a member? A re you paying for the class? Write a letter to <br/>
the teacher and cc the director of the program and their boss. They <br/>
need to know these things because, really, a lot of people create <br/>
these programs without a clue as to what exactly what the kids need <br/>
or want. So they offer the courses and cross their fingers.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time this type of feedback is what management has been <br/>
waiting for to make decisions about additional classes. It really <br/>
could not hurt to let them know what your older kids would enjoy in <br/>
an age appropriate class.<br/>

about the class that sounded really cool is that the kids get to actually <br/>
play with  zoo animals and that seemed to be really the only part he enjoyed <br/>
much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395536238">Sometimes you get opportunities in classes that you don&#39;t get <br/>
otherwise.  For example, we were in a class once where they let the <br/>
kids see a snake eat a (dead) mouse.  Another time we were in a class <br/>
where they organized the kids into a really fun game that taught <br/>
about the food chain.  Other times it&#39;s only in classes that you get <br/>
to use certain equipment, like a camp we go to sometimes that offers <br/>
astronomy classes with a really huge telescope or a kiln to bake our <br/>
pottery.  <br/>
