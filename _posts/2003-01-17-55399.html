<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092640447">My kids ( except for JP, hes a skinny fella)  all had to start wearing <br/>
huskies ( for boys) and Anna had to wear Pretty Plus or Extra Special sizes.  <br/>
These special sizes ARE hard to find.. and the selection is pathetic ( esp <br/>
for girls)  Anna is 13 and now she is in the very top end of girls plus <br/>
sizes.. 18 1/2.  She can also wear ladies size 14.. but, like others have <br/>
said.. they dont fit right.. they are too long( the pants, I mean.. shirts <br/>
are usually OK).  I have TONS, I mean LOADS of girls plus sized clothes if <br/>
anyone is interested  I have size 10 1/2 up to 16 1/2.  I know this is not a <br/>
&quot;for sale&quot; list.. but, since a few folks have mentioned it, I thought it <br/>
might help if anyone is looking for some special sizes for girls.<br/>
