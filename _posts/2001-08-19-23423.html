<div id="ygrps-yiv-750000267">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine and long time homeschooler and speaker at conventions said<br/>
to me that 90% of boys are dyslexic till age 8, meaning they will write<br/>
numbers and letters backwards on occasion but usually get over it.  I don&#39;t<br/>
correct my  7 year old son when he does this unless it&#39;s number order.  For<br/>
example he wanted to write 16 and instead wrote 61 so I said, &quot;You fed your<br/>
turtle 61 worms?&quot;  He corrected  it with no upset but then when he wrote 16<br/>
he wrote the 6 backwards and didn&#39;t when he wrote it as 61.<br/>
<br/>
