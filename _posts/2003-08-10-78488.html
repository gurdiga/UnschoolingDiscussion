&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sure are boring little critters! &lt;BEG&gt; Watching them is like <br/>
&gt; &gt;meditating. TORTURE trying to keep focused.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, now see, I find them FASCINATING! &lt;G&gt; They can get soooo long and <br/>
&gt; scrunch <br/>
&gt; up really tightly. They can suck their antennae in---oh! They are NEAT! Pick <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; them up; when they feel safe, they will start to move and slide along your <br/>
&gt; hand! Cool little critters!<br/>

fascinate you. You seem to have a compulsion to draw hundreds of people to SC, <br/>
pushing it repeatedly. In the midst of planning this little soiree, you also <br/>
initiate dozens of home improvement projects.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly -- it&#39;s time you get the help you need.<br/>

Kathryn, whose hoping Kelly will come HERE and do home improvement projects<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Dozens&quot; is an exaggeration. New kitchen counters. New sink and fixtures. New <br/>
kitchen floor (UGH!!!!!). New shower door in the master bathroom. New <br/>
counters, sinks, and fixtures in the boys&#39; bathroom. New tub. New floor (not in yet). <br/>
New tub tile (not in yet). New toilet (not in yet). And new tiled floor in <br/>
the laundry room (not in yet). See? Not even ONE dozen! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m manic, I&#39;m MANIC! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and we&#39;ll be in the midst of repairing all the window frames and painting <br/>
the house during the next two weeks and maybe during the conference---but *I* <br/>
won&#39;t be doing that!<br/>
<br/>
But I did wake up last night with a pinched nerve or something---can&#39;t move <br/>
my neck or right side of my upper body. Any recommendations? It&#39;s BAD! Really <br/>
bad!<br/>

insist!<br/>

My son had something like this last week, although his may have just <br/>
been a muscle strain.  He got over it with Motrin and hot compresses. <br/>

<br/>
I used to do that often. I&#39;ve tried everything. LOTS of ice is by far <br/>
the best in terms of getting over it as quickly as possible. 15 minutes <br/>
out of every hour for the first 24 hours if possible.<br/>
