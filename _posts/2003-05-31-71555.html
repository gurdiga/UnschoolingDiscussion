Thanks for sharing the pics.  That is the most INCREDIBLE place I have ever<br/>
seen!!<br/>
I love your &quot;yurt&quot;.  What is a yurt?  Where/how did you learn about this?<br/>
You have a beautiful place...I&#39;m in awe!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404436585">Hey, Thanks!  I&#39;m pretty smitten with it myself.  Does it show? (grin)<br/>
Would you believe I found them, from &quot;googling&quot; on Yurts back in <br/>
November?  (gotta love that google!)  I think there was a newspaper article <br/>
about a resort in Hawaii or Montana that uses them, heard they could get <br/>
put up in a day (unless you&#39;re a member of the Dykema family) and was <br/>
hooked...  They&#39;re originally from Mongolia (and look quite a bit different <br/>
with their original felted walls and long belly straps.)<br/>

There&#39;s an unschooler family who used to live in a yurt full-time, but I <br/>
think they&#39;re on another list.<br/>
<br/>
Cordwood and Strawbale are my next building goals...well, after the deck <br/>
and bathroom anyway.  Some &#39;facilities&#39; would be really, really nice!<br/>
