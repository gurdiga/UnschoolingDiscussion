<div id="ygrps-yiv-364249465">I had a problem with opening the Acme files in the files section at <br/>
yahoogroups, Pam.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just me, but in case others have a problem too, I&#39;d like to put <br/>
them on a webpage linked to Carol&#39;s plan (and because it would be searchable <br/>
through google, too).<br/>
<br/>
I clicked the secondary, and it started to download (rather than opening) and <br/>
my computer froze up.  <br/>
<br/>
I rebooted, emptied my cache files, dumped the trash, checked that file, and <br/>
it had a lot of garbage/command stuff at the end, but seemed possibly <br/>
otherwise to be there.<br/>
<br/>
I tried opening the elementary, and it froze too.  When I rebooted (and <br/>
practiced my calming deep breathing, and checked on Holly, and vacuumed the stairs) <br/>
it ended without a bunch of character notes, so I&#39;m not sure if I have it all.<br/>
<br/>
Does it end with the math paragraph?  If this is the end, I have it:<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics:  ACME students will develop mathematical concepts, operational <br/>
skills, and problem solving through participation in daily real-world <br/>
activities such as cooking, building, shopping, budgeting, computing, etc. Mathematics <br/>
materials will be chosen to support students’ individual learning styles in <br/>
order to achieve competency in operational skills and insight into <br/>
problem-solving procedures.  Our goal is for ACME <br/>

<br/>
I think it might be multiple fonts that caused the problem for me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put them here, but they&#39;re not there yet as I post this (but will be by <br/>
the time some of you read it):<br/>
