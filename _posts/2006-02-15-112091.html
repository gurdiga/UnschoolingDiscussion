<div id="ygrps-yiv-510970571">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am a single mother in CA my dd is 9. She has never been to school or<br/>
schooled except for a few disasterous months early in our introduction<br/>
to hs that quickly taught me that was not for us. ;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Later I started paying more attention when hearing people talk about<br/>
unschooling and decided that fit how we were living. I joined this<br/>
list long ago but have only been lurking again recently trying to<br/>
decide if I am ready to re enter the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
So we are at a new cross road. She is starting to want to do things<br/>
with no supervision that she is not capable of mastering. Previously<br/>
the things she pushed me to do that I wasn&#39;t sure she was ready for<br/>
she accomplished nicely.<br/>
<br/>
The former continues to prove itself frustrating for the both of us<br/>
but I don&#39;t know how to support her without having her think I just<br/>
want to control things and situations.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like she is out ahead of herself just a little and can&#39;t get back<br/>
into sync. And I am on the outside looking in. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have fiercly independant children that resist oversight?<br/>
<br/>
I guess here would be a good place for an example story huh?<br/>
<br/>
About a month ago she demanded she be allowed to bake cookies for some<br/>
new neighbors in our cul de sac. I really didn&#39;t feel like stopping<br/>
everything I was doing at that moment to bake cookies plus baking<br/>
resources were low and there are other issues like we live with my<br/>
parents so it&#39;s not my kitchen...lol sigh<br/>
<br/>
So I pointed her to cook books, and told her we had no butter. She<br/>
finds a recipe that did not require butter and set everything up.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Raisin Oatmeal Cookies <br/>
<br/>
I told her to pre cook the apple chunks rather than just adding them<br/>
to the batter for a bit of a different taste and feel of them in the<br/>
finished product and was free to come and survey by the time she told<br/>
me they were finished and she was almost done with the rest of the batter.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have baked a lot in our life time but she has mostly helped or<br/>
watched until now. So I told her to keep things simple and follow the<br/>
recipe/instructions.<br/>
<br/>
Glancing at the apples which were covered in brown sugar and cinnamon<br/>
so I couldn&#39;t see clearly what shape they were in. It became apparent<br/>
that they were not soft and tender...what&#39;s more they were chopped<br/>
nicely but they were not peeled! lol<br/>
<br/>
When I mentioned that to her she was shocked. She hadn&#39;t read that<br/>
part and hadn&#39;t realized that it&#39;s what I always do when chopping<br/>
apples for oatmeal and other things we add them to for baking.<br/>
<br/>
Ok so we start a new batch of apples and I tell her how to test and<br/>
make sure they are soft.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was a decent experience the cookies came out lovely and<br/>
she had a good time she was in control and all I did was help with the<br/>
apples.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks later she wants to make cookies again. But this time she<br/>
wants to wing her own version of chocolate cookies. Again I mention<br/>
this is not my kitchen and I&#39;ll add my mother is extremely neat and<br/>
tidy where I am more relaxed. So the pressure is on to put her kitchen<br/>
back the way she likes it in a very timely manner and we are talking<br/>
chocolate here eke!<br/>
<br/>
Again I am not totally in a baking mood so this is my dd&#39;s idea and I<br/>
am sort of just along for the ride. She wants none of referencing her<br/>
idea for a cookie recipe with an already established one and I want<br/>
none of her experiementing in my mothers kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
We agree she will write out her recipe for starters. She brings me a<br/>
recipe for sugar cookies and gets mad when I ask her to please proof<br/>
read it.<br/>
<br/>
But she quickly realizes her error and gets busy setting things up in<br/>
the kitchen. I paralleled her recipe with one from a book I have and<br/>
made some changes to the levening amount which she resented.<br/>
<br/>
I also measured the powdered chocolate again simply for the sake of my<br/>
mothers kitchen and easy clean up.<br/>
<br/>
But an only slightly mussed kitchen and perfectly yummy cake like<br/>
cookies later my dd quips &quot;I didn&#39;t need your help you just want to be<br/>
involved in everything and can&#39;t leave me alone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Further grumbling about having to do the clean up dishes!<br/>

If it was spelling or something, I would&#39;ve been cranky too.  She  <br/>
wanted to cook.<br/>

<br/>
Could you have just explained to her what you think would have  <br/>
happened if she had used the amount she started with,  and still let  <br/>
her decide?<br/>
<br/>
It seems maybe you could compromise some on the baking.  If she wants  <br/>
to and you don&#39;t, what else are you doing that&#39;s so much more  <br/>
important?  Because it seems that in both of the examples you said  <br/>
no, but then helped anyway.  What if you had said &quot;Yes,  as soon as I  <br/>
finish this...&quot; or &quot;Yes, okay&quot;?<br/>

$10-20 is a small price for what you can learn in a kitchen.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
At 9, my daughter was beginning to bake and it was before unschooling and I  <br/>
was much more of a controlling parent than I (thank goodness)  have learned  <br/>
to be.  If I had it to do over (now that she is 16 and quite a lovely  baker) <br/>
is just make sure she knew how to turn the oven on and keep from burning  <br/>
either herself or the kitchen down.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d let her bake to her heart&#39;s content and when she was done I would clean  <br/>
up whatever mess there was.  If she needed butter, I&#39;d make sure she had  it. <br/>
I&#39;d eat those cookies no matter how they tasted and I bet next time they  <br/>
would taste a bit better.  If she wanted help or advice, I&#39;d give it but  other <br/>
than that I&#39;d just make sure she had the time and ingredients to make  as many <br/>
cookies as she wanted.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not very long from 9 to 16 and I&#39;d give anything to have spent those  <br/>
moments between ages 9 and 13 to give her the freedom to explore and make  <br/>
cookies without my meddling about making sure it was done like I thought it  should <br/>
be done.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve cooked and baked a lot together but when she wanted to do it alone, I  <br/>
should have let her.  Luckily, we discovered unschooling and the  last three <br/>
years have been the best.<br/>
 <br/>
 A mess is easily cleaned up.  A relationship with your daughter  is not.  <br/>
Just some thoughts from a mom with a daughter who today was  talking about <br/>
colleges she might want to go to.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Huge and great point.<br/>
<br/>
Not an experimental story, but:<br/>
<br/>
I helped Kirby make two cakes from scratch.  It was one cake, but he  <br/>
wanted different colored layers.  I coached  and helped with prep, he  <br/>
did the real work, I was rinsing and loading things into the  <br/>
dishwasher as he went.  Had I required that he clean up in exchange  <br/>
for the privilege of making a cake, he might have felt overwhelmed  <br/>
and unloved.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to make a cake is as good and important and complex as  <br/>
anything a kid could want to learn.  I was glad to help him.  He was  <br/>
nineteen already.  That&#39;s okay.  There are adults who&#39;ve never gone  <br/>
past a pre-packaged cake mix.  I was happy that Kirby wanted to work  <br/>
from scratch.  He had the interest and attention span to care about  <br/>
things like using cocoa powder to flour the pans for the chocolate  <br/>
layers, and flour for the spice-cake layers.  Cool!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384405254">I learned how to bake using mixes.  Once, the brownies turned out like <br/>
pudding.  But only once.<br/>
<br/>
Although I like to bake from scratch, I buy mixes from time to time, to have <br/>
on hand.<br/>
<br/>
It can be fun to compare too.  Bake something from scratch and the same type <br/>
of thing from a mix and compare.  It doesn&#39;t have to be schooly with charts <br/>
and exact figures.  Just in general.  Do they seem any different?  Was there <br/>
a big cost difference or just a little?  And it might be fun for her to have <br/>
her Gramma be one of the testers.  See if Gramma can tell the scratch from <br/>
the mix.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I accidently added too many chocolate chips to a homemade brownie <br/>
recipe.  Those were the best brownies I ever ate!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chocolate chips are one of the finest American contributions to  <br/>
culture anywhere. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One day years ago I meant to dump a layer of raisins in a bread  <br/>
pudding I was making, and accidentally grabbed the very-similar bag  <br/>
of chocolate chips.  The dumping was done, and I thought...  why  <br/>
didn&#39;t I ever think of doing that on purpose!?<br/>
<br/>
And years before that, pre-children, following on a conversation at  <br/>
work about the potential magic of chocolate chips, I made corn bread  <br/>
with chocolate chips.  It&#39;s not something I ever made again, but  <br/>
besides being interesting and edible, it was pretty.  The chips faded  <br/>
into the corn bread very nicely.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a brave cook, but there are two tales of... something. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like cake mixes, especially when they&#39;re on sale for $1 or so, and  <br/>
all this conversation makes me want to go and set one up.  When I&#39;m  <br/>
making a fancy cake for a birthday, I usually do something special  <br/>
from scratch, but when it&#39;s just for a chocolate fix, a cake mix in a  <br/>
bundt pan without any intention of frosting is plenty good for me.    <br/>
Ice cream can make it fancy.<br/>

<br/>
 From what I hear, the classic (Tollhouse) chocolate chip cookie was <br/>
invented by accident.  The baker wanted chocolate-flavored cookies and <br/>
hoped/expected the chips to melt into the batter.  That&#39;s not the <br/>
outcome she got.<br/>
<br/>
It amazes me that this didn&#39;t happen until the 1930s.  We had cookies, <br/>
we had chocolate, but people seem to have been slow to experiment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067054344">WE love baking.... I do have a ten year old, who has<br/>
been baking for several years. She loves to make mixes<br/>
or scratch. Tonight my five year old wanted to bake a<br/>
cake. I was really feeling tired, especially tired of<br/>
the kitchen. Ashton was more than happy to help<br/>
Olivia. As I was reading your post I just checked the<br/>
girls cake for them. I asked if it was okay first. <br/>
<br/>
Today I really had an &quot;I Love Unschooling Day&quot;. I love<br/>
these days when it clicks and I know I am doing<br/>
exactly what we are supposed to be doing. <br/>
<br/>
Ashton wrote a song on the computer. She used a<br/>
cursive font, so she could understand what cursive<br/>
looks like. Her plan. <br/>
<br/>
Robby and Levi and DH built coffee tables for the boys<br/>
rooms. Their own design. <br/>
<br/>
Jessy gamed and watched a movie. <br/>
<br/>
Megan learned how to parallel park. She is taking her<br/>
driving test on Monday. <br/>
<br/>
Tycen chopped  wood with DH for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
And Olivia scooped snow and put it in a pot and put it<br/>
on the woodstove. She added dishsoap and watched the<br/>
snow melt and stirred and watched the bubbles come up.<br/>
She announced that it was her imagination.. She meant<br/>
her invention, but I thought imagination was<br/>
beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
That is not all they did, but it just seemed to be a<br/>
day off connections, of living a rich life. It was a<br/>
good day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439965624">Heyas,<br/>
<br/>
@ errors the recipe read <br/>
<br/>
Chocolate Cookies<br/>
<br/>
The ingredient list: Flour, Sugar, Butter, Baking Soda, Salt, Vanilla,<br/>
Milk, Eggs ;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get cranky I was just being practical.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed I could have let her come to her own end about leavening but I<br/>
did explain to her why I was making the change and she totally<br/>
understood. I had been experimenting with pancake batter recipes and<br/>
leavening a few weeks before. And she&#39;d been the taster hehehehe<br/>
<br/>
What I really wanted was for her not to present to me that she wants<br/>
to wing anything in my mothers kitchen. I wanted her to parallel other<br/>
recipes and create her own or geez how about follow one of those<br/>
recipes what is the hurry to reinvent the wheel is my question?<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not that I want to control the process for that sake alone<br/>
it&#39;s that I want to mitigate the damages based on how she usually acts<br/>
in these circumstances. She is so busy trying to be right she misses<br/>
details that take away from the outcome then she feels bad, whines and<br/>
complains.<br/>
<br/>
But she doesn&#39;t take good notes, learn from her mistakes and try to<br/>
change her behaviors she wants to just barrel on ahead to the next thing.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean to convey by expressing that it was not my desire to bake<br/>
was simply that she demanded without regard for the fact that I was<br/>
doing something in the moment. And that due to her desire to be on her<br/>
own I was actually happy to be able to give her free reign in the<br/>
kitchen without me standing right there over all of it.<br/>
<br/>
It was her desire to bake alone. And her pride to say so. She only<br/>
wanted my permission not my participation. <br/>
<br/>
Which I would have had no problem with if she had presented a more<br/>
planned and well thought out process. She doesn&#39;t see how the first<br/>
batch of cookies she was able to bake alone because she was following<br/>
a recipe (and not using chocolate ;&gt; ) and the latter recipe called on<br/>
more of my attentions because of her desire to wing it.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday...I totally said yes and she had the kitchen to herself.<br/>
<br/>
But what she told me she was going to do and what she ended up doing<br/>
were not exactly the same which just irritates me.<br/>
<br/>
lol sigh<br/>

daughter. Begin where she is and help her get where she wants.<br/>
<br/>
I know you think that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing but what you&#39;re doing now  <br/>
is helping her get to the one and only destination you think is  <br/>
right. Rather than approaching the recipe from a &quot;You need to know  <br/>
how much,&quot; approach it from &quot;Well, how much of each of these should  <br/>
you use? If you get a cookbook you can get an idea of how much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And it&#39;s not that I want to control the process for that sake alone<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s that I want to mitigate the damages based on how she usually acts<br/>
&gt; in these circumstances. She is so busy trying to be right she misses<br/>
&gt; details that take away from the outcome then she feels bad, whines and<br/>
&gt; complains.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And lots of damage is done when we trying to prevent our kids from  <br/>
going down a chosen path. There&#39;s a big difference between saying  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s pretty cold. I&#39;m wearing my coat today,&quot; and &quot;Put your coat on  <br/>
because it&#39;s too cold to be without one.&quot; If they do choose no coat  <br/>
we can take it with us -- and never say &quot;I told you so.&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
Be honest with her. Tell her you&#39;ll get in trouble with your mom if  <br/>
the kitchen isn&#39;t as neat and tidy after the cookies as it is before.  <br/>
Be her partner in what she wants to do rather than the enforcer of  <br/>
rules as you see them. Help her be part of the solution rather being  <br/>
the problem.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A good book is Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka.  <br/>
She is who she is. Fighting against that trying to get her to be  <br/>
someone who is a deliberate thinking is just going to create a wall  <br/>
between you. Understanding her will help enormously.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I mean to convey by expressing that it was not my desire to bake<br/>
&gt; was simply that she demanded without regard for the fact that I was<br/>
&gt; doing something in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a magic formula for that particular incident.  <br/>
But there are ways to create a better relationship between you so  <br/>
that she doesn&#39;t feel she needs to keep pulling and pushing to get  <br/>
what she wants. If she&#39;s feeling like you&#39;re a barrier between where  <br/>
she is and what she&#39;d like to have, she&#39;s going to push at you. Walk  <br/>
next to her.<br/>
<br/>
When you have a relationship that doesn&#39;t feel to her as though you  <br/>
were in opposition to each other, then that type of incident won&#39;t be  <br/>
exacerbated by her need to push and pull. She may still be a do first  <br/>
and fix later type of person but she&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re her partner  <br/>
rather than her adversary.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But what she told me she was going to do and what she ended up doing<br/>
&gt; were not exactly the same which just irritates me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And she isn&#39;t you. And it *will* be irritating if you want her to be  <br/>
and do as you would and she doesn&#39;t. She isn&#39;t going to change to be  <br/>
like you. If you want this to stop irritating you, then you need to  <br/>
change.<br/>

have to mull around in our brains for awhile for processing.  Sometimes *we* <br/>
don&#39;t know what we learned from something until much later.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t work if you only see learning based on your priorities.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So?  Who says people must take notes when they cook?  I can rarely replicate <br/>
a recipe because I always make changes based on the ingredients I have on <br/>
hand.  Even if I took notes, the next time I made the recipe I would have <br/>
different ingredients to wing it with or would try to change something else <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
I do sometimes write in my cookbooks, especially if I&#39;ve made a change that <br/>
*I* want to remember the results from.  Those &quot;notes&quot; are for me.  Thank God <br/>
nobody else gets to decide whether they are &quot;good notes&quot; or not.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes write in a cookbook when I&#39;ve made something for a special <br/>
occasion i.e. &quot;made for Pat&#39;s birthday 2005.  Really yummy.&quot;  There is a <br/>
term for this: annotate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keith brought a local pamphlet back from the doctor&#39;s office a couple  <br/>
of weeks ago and it&#39;s been in our bathroom as he reads through it.   <br/>
There&#39;s a section on stress management.  One of the items is:<br/>
<br/>
Change Yourself and Response by:<br/>
• Changing the way you perceive the situation or yourself;<br/>
• Changing unrealistic expectations and irrational beliefs;<br/>
• Building self esteem<br/>
• Cultivating a positive attitude;<br/>
• Redefining the situation in a less stress-provoking way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think those things will help in the situation with the daughter and  <br/>
the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes moms new to this list are shocked when someone seems to  <br/>
take the child&#39;s side over the mom&#39;s.  The thing is, we want YOU to  <br/>
take your child&#39;s side.  When things are going better with her, they  <br/>
will right at that moment also be going better with you.  Be her  <br/>
partner.  Make what your daughter needs a priority in your life, even  <br/>
when what she needs is for you to leave her alone.  Decide that she  <br/>
is crucially, vitally important.<br/>
