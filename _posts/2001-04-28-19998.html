Is the Brown Recluse the same as the boxing spider. These hide in wood <br/>
piles predominantly. We had an article in the paper about a year ago w/ <br/>
drawings. We actually found one in the log wood hay rack in the pasture this <br/>
past summer. I was shocked to find one, they are small but very <br/>
distinguishable due to their big boxing glove looking things. Very technical <br/>
terms you know. ;o)<br/>

Hi Nicki,<br/>
I did a search on the boxing spider and no, they&#39;re not the same as the brown recluse, but I was surprised to find out that they do bite and it is painful, but they are not poisonous.  I am learning a lot with this string about spiders!  I will try to pass on this knowledge to my children, now that is homeschooling!<br/>
