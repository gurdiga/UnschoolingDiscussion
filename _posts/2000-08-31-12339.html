&lt;&lt; Has anyone else on this list read it? &gt;&gt;<br/>

It is one my shelf right now!  I have read it but I found Grace Lewellyn&#39;s <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook to be much more empowering and freeing.  Even if <br/>
your kiddies are younger now, it is a good read for Mom&#39;s who often freak out <br/>
about the unschooling thing.  My guys are 11 and 12 and they are reading the <br/>
book this year themselves.  How else are they going to get Mom off their <br/>
back?  &lt;BG&gt;  I think they will finally have a sense of control over their own <br/>
destinies after reading it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Grace&#39;s book is great for Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s who are having a tough time <br/>
unschooling/deschooling themselves.  I was able to take a deep breathe and <br/>
relax after reading it.  My kids are happier now too.<br/>
