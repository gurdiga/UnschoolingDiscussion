We stayed up to watch them too (here in Northern CA).<br/>
We went to a friend&#39;s house (she has some large<br/>
clearings between the trees - for a better view),<br/>
hoping that the sky would clear before 2am. Luckily it<br/>
did! What a great experience, it was beautiful! We<br/>
were completely awed by the magic of the universe that<br/>
night.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I hadn&#39;t thought it would be <br/>
clear <br/>
enough on the Wet Coast of Canada to see the Leonides<br/>
last night, but <br/>
they <br/>
were quite spectacular (for the little while that I<br/>
could stay awake to <br/>
watch).<br/>
