<br/>
I&#39;m from southern Wisconsin, but we spend as much summer time as we can up <br/>
near Minocqua.  As far as I can tell, it seems rough to make a go of it year <br/>
round in the northwoods.   There just aren&#39;t that many jobs available.  Of <br/>
course, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking of as far as jobs, but there aren&#39;t <br/>
a lot of either blue or white collar opportunties in many of those northern <br/>
counties.  A lot of service work-tourist related.  But hey, if it&#39;s your <br/>
dream, and you can make it work...more power to you.  I personally think the <br/>
winters would be o.k. because it&#39;s just so darn beautiful and cozy and quiet. <br/>
 Good luck to you.<br/>
<br/>
Caro<br/>
