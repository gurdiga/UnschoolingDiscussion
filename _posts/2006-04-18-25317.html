<div id="ygrps-yiv-906143938">Hello,My name is Bridget,I am new to this group.I decided to unschool <br/>
my two youngest,Moe who is almost three,and Mimi who will be two this <br/>
fall. I also have a grown son Nick who will be 22yrs old soon,(wow how <br/>
time flies).The decision to unschool was an easy one and I certainly <br/>
have the support of my friends and family.I have gone to the  many <br/>
links suggested,I have read many articles and am in the process of <br/>
reading through a mountain of books.I realise though it is the process <br/>
itself that will teach me the most.I am astounded by how much sage <br/>
advice you can gleen from this site. I have two questions.My son often <br/>
pulls his sister&#39;s hair.I do not condone spanking.I have tried time-<br/>
outs(one minute for each year),and my sons cries and cries so much <br/>
that I feel they are perhaps  not the ideal method either,any <br/>
suggestions?Second question,how do you respond to people who question <br/>
your decision to unschool.I can recite stats,I can choose to ignore <br/>
the question, I suggests sites they can visit,books they can read but <br/>
I sometimes feel ambushed by others who feel their need to tell me <br/>
what I am doing is wrong.I do not want come off flip either since <br/>
these are my fellow collegues and I do not want to risk alienating <br/>
them needlessly,I am a nurse and team work is essential.Thank-you</div>

<br/>
Is he just curious?  Jealous of her?  Can you offer to let him pull  <br/>
your hair instead, and then just talk to him about how it can be  <br/>
scary or hurt for someone to pull your hair?<br/>
<br/>
Some of the ideas here might help:<br/>

<br/>
Picking her up and comforting her physically while you talk to him  <br/>
calmly about not doing that would be my recommendation, but look at  <br/>
what&#39;s happening before he pulls her hair.  Is he expecting her to  <br/>
communicate better?  Maybe talk about how he can get her attention in  <br/>
nicer ways.  (I&#39;m thinking of how I talked to kids about how to be  <br/>
nicer to cats.)<br/>
<br/>
Talking to him like a person and giving him real information, while  <br/>
letting him know you care about him and care about his sister seems  <br/>
like a good idea.  And generalize the advice.  It&#39;s not just about  <br/>
her hair.  It&#39;s about people&#39;s right to have their personal space and  <br/>
the need for her to be safe in her own home just as he is.<br/>
<br/>
(But then you need to make it true, and not put him in time-out in  <br/>
his own home.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mother in law was a nurse (still living; retired).  She started  <br/>
off sure she knew everything about babies and I knew nothing.   <br/>
Concerning circumcision, I gave her a small stack of books with  <br/>
sticky notes on the appropriate chapters and said &quot;Here&#39;s what we  <br/>
read when we were deciding.&quot;  She took the books saying &quot;Well I&#39;ll  <br/>
read it, but it won&#39;t change my mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The next day she brought them down, set them down gently on the table  <br/>
(significant, because she usually just drops things kinda for the  <br/>
effect of the sound or something) and said &quot;Well things have changed  <br/>
a lot since I went to nursing school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When unschooling came and she inquired, I offered to lend her books I  <br/>
had read before I decided, and she declined.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

If you set it up in such a way (politely) that you let them know that  <br/>
you understand their position AND your new one, while they only  <br/>
understand theirs (i.e. your old one), but that IF (*if*) they want  <br/>
to read some of what you&#39;ve read then you&#39;d be willing to discuss  <br/>
it.  It can be said nicely, with a big smile.  And IF they don&#39;t want  <br/>
to read, THEN you are under no obligation to discuss it with  <br/>
unqualified and uninformed nosy folk.<br/>

Why Rush People to GET IT?<br/>
By Sandra Dodd (Sandradodd) on Saturday, January 3, 2004 - 09:19 am:<br/>
-=- Kinder and gentler would&#39;ve slowed down my learning to the point I<br/>
don&#39;t think we&#39;d have ever gotten here. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Priss wrote that.<br/>
<br/>
When people say &quot;You&#39;re patient with your own children but pushy with<br/>
unschooling parents,&quot; it&#39;s because of the possibility that they will<br/>
run out of time.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have their whole lives to memorize 7x8 if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
The mother of a twelve year old has VERY little time if she wants to<br/>
help him recover from school and spend a few unschooling years with<br/>
him before he&#39;s grown and gone. She doesn&#39;t have time to ease into it<br/>
gradually. If she does, he&#39;ll be fifteen or sixteen and it just won&#39;t<br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
If the mother of a five year old is trying to decide how much reading<br/>
instruction and math drill to continue with before she switches to<br/>
unschooling, I want to press her to decide it&#39;s &quot;NONE,&quot; because &quot;some&quot;<br/>
is damaging to the child&#39;s potential to learn it joyfully and discover<br/>
it on his own. And &quot;lots&quot; will just hurt that much more. But &quot;none&quot;<br/>
can still be turned to &quot;some&quot; if the parent can&#39;t get unschooling. But<br/>
if she doesn&#39;t even try unschooling, she misses forever the<br/>
opportunity to see that child learn to read gradually and naturally.<br/>
It will be gone forever. Forever.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t say &quot;Gosh, I&#39;m sure whatever you&#39;re doing is fine, and if<br/>
you want to unschool you can come to it gradually at your own rate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People say jokingly (though it&#39;s true) &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be reading by<br/>
the time he goes on a date&quot; but that can&#39;t be said of unschooling, if<br/>
the parent is attached to thinking she needs to teach things.<br/>
<br/>
Until a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from<br/>
working, unschooling can&#39;t begin to work.<br/>
<br/>
It seems simple to me. If you&#39;re trying to listen for a sound, you<br/>
have to stop talking and be still.<br/>
<br/>
Some people want to see unschooling while they&#39;re still teaching and<br/>
putzing and assigning and requiring.<br/>
<br/>
They have to stop that FIRST. And then they have to be still. And then<br/>
they have to look at their child with new eyes.<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t, it won&#39;t happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188310228">Hi Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group.  I&#39;m a new member myself.  I have 3 children.  <br/>
My oldest is almost 14 and attends public school and my two <br/>
homeschooled children are 8 and 9 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
When &quot;strangers&quot; ask me about school, I just mention we homeschool.  <br/>
The usual questions are about socialization, free time for me, and <br/>
how much patience I must have.  I don&#39;t go into details about <br/>
homeschool methodology with these types of people.  They&#39;re usually <br/>
just curious that we are doing something different than regular <br/>
school and that&#39;s all they need to know.<br/>
<br/>
When I encounter other homeschoolers, they always want to know what <br/>
curriculum I&#39;m using.  Up until this point, I always had names to <br/>
spout off of various things we use, explaining we pull a little of <br/>
this and a little of that.  Now, I just plan to say we don&#39;t use any <br/>
formal curriculum but use things around us, i.e. lots of books, <br/>
computer, etc.  If they specifically ask me about methodology, I&#39;ll <br/>
say we are life learners, picking up things we need as we go.  I <br/>
think the word &#39;unschool&#39; often brings up negative thoughts because <br/>
it&#39;s so misunderstood.  If anyone persists, maybe even using that <br/>
term, I&#39;ll acknowledge we are unschoolers and that we&#39;re learning <br/>
more now than we ever did with formal curriculum.  I never get into <br/>
arguments about homeschool methodology.  I believe that everyone has <br/>
their idea of homeschooling and it&#39;s not my place to have to <br/>
convince anyone of anything.  If they disapprove of our choices, <br/>
then so be it.  I have a couple of friends and they know I&#39;m <br/>
unschooling now and while they think I&#39;m a little nuts, they are <br/>
supportive just as I&#39;m supportive of their choices.  We are friends <br/>
because we like one another, not because of how we homeschool our <br/>
children.<br/>

Two of the local leaders were unschoolers and they had four kids each  <br/>
(then five, and eventually nine, in one case).  So my kids and I just  <br/>
slipped in there as part of a crowd, at first.  And it was just  <br/>
Kirby, initially.  I figured Marty and Holly might go to school.<br/>
<br/>
And I used to get Growing without Schooling magazine, so I knew there  <br/>
were others scattered out across the continent, so it wasn&#39;t too lonely.<br/>
<br/>
It was really the 90&#39;s already when I started anyway.  Kirby was born  <br/>
in 1986 and wasn&#39;t school-age until 1990s.  But if anyone&#39;s counting  <br/>
the whole attachment parenting thing, then yeah, longer.  But in the  <br/>
safe environs of La Leche League meetings and playgroup.<br/>

&gt; pulls his sister&#39;s hair.I do not condone spanking.I have tried time-<br/>
&gt; outs(one minute for each year),and my sons cries and cries so much<br/>
&gt; that I feel they are perhaps  not the ideal method either,any<br/>
&gt; suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cut her hair, put it up, put it in ponytails (they hurt less when  <br/>
pulled than a handful of hair does), have her wear a hat around him  <br/>
(get her some really cute, fun hats).<br/>
<br/>
Keep a closer eye on him and catch him before he does it, whenever  <br/>
possible, of course.<br/>
<br/>
When he does it, gently pick him up and remove him from the room and  <br/>
just say, firmly but not angrily, &quot;Whoops, can&#39;t be in here with  <br/>
sister if you pull hair.&quot; Then distract him with something else to  <br/>
do. Don&#39;t make a bigger deal out of it than that.<br/>
<br/>
Easter morning my whole family was together and my 21 year old  <br/>
daughter was showing my 24 yo nephew how to knit. His head was bent  <br/>
over, close to her. My sister said, &quot;Hey, remember how Alex always  <br/>
had to keep his head away from Roya&#39;s hands? We all laughed - Roya  <br/>
used to love to pull Alex&#39;s hair - no idea why, she didn&#39;t pull other  <br/>
peoples&#39; hair, but it was a &quot;thing&quot; she did to him alone. She was  <br/>
little and she got over it pretty quickly and now we remember those  <br/>
days and we laugh. She loves her cousin - he loves her - it didn&#39;t  <br/>
permanently come between them, either.<br/>

Oh!  This reminds me of something I said to people who asked about  <br/>
Kirby the first few years.<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;It&#39;s working well so far.  If it quits working, we can  <br/>
put him in school.&quot;<br/>
I would say it very neutrally, and happily, as though I had no  <br/>
preference which it would be, and really I didn&#39;t have as much as I  <br/>
came to have later, when Marty and Holly also opted to stay home.    <br/>
But it would seem to give my detractors and questioners a soothing  <br/>
hope.  And they would feel that school was really an option for us,  <br/>
waiting for that moment when (they seemed sure) it would no longer go  <br/>
well.<br/>

Say No, I Feel Guilty,&quot; that talks about this same technique -- the <br/>
author calls it &quot;fogging,&quot; if I remember right.  Anyone who has trouble <br/>
dealing with parents, in-laws, and others who can guilt you into <br/>
changing to please them, would find the book helpful.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Maybe the<br/>
&gt; &gt; article I put from you might be too &quot;radical&quot; for someone who has no<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea what unschooling is.  But I like it of course because to me it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; very much the point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It just depends on the person and the direction their thoughts are  <br/>
&gt; headed.  Someone who wants to get it can read just about anything.   <br/>
&gt; Someone who&#39;s trying NOT to get it, trying to belittle it, needs the  <br/>
&gt; sweetie stuff with birds singing and little kids frolicking in nature.<br/>
