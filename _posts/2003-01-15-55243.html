I&#39;m getting excited now.  I have trouble making the darn decision, but then<br/>
it&#39;s fun.  My son loves theatres.  We&#39;ll have to check out the 1/2 price<br/>
stuff.<br/>

Les Mis, and a few others.  It was tough.  If we ever get the <br/>
opportunity to return, we&#39;ll try to go to a show every night!  <br/>
<br/>
During the show, I was worried the entire time (Egads - I&#39;m going to <br/>
be walking around downtown NYC at 11:30PM with my kids. . . etc.) but <br/>
it turned out great.  We took a cab to Penn Station (it was all of <br/>
about 2 blocks - I&#39;m sure the cab driver was pleased about the long <br/>
fare  :-) and then hopped on a train to Trenton (we were staying with <br/>
friends there)  All clean, well-lit, train and station filled with <br/>
theater-goers, cops everywhere. . . sure wish I had known that BEFORE <br/>
the show - I would have enjoyed it so much more. . . .<br/>
<br/>
After the show, my ds looked at me and said, &quot;If I lived in NY, I&#39;d <br/>
go to a show every night&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;YUP - so would I - we&#39;d need a well-paying job, though&quot; :-)<br/>
