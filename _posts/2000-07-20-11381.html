 </span></blockquote>Q: How does a home schooler change a light bulb?<br/>
<br/>
A: First, Mom checks three books on electricity<br/>
out of the library, then the kids make models of<br/>
light bulbs, read a biography of Thomas Edison<br/>
and do a skit based on his life.<br/>
<br/>
Next, everyone studies the history of lighting<br/>
methods, wrapping up with dipping their own<br/>
candles.<br/>
<br/>
Then, everyone takes a trip to the store where<br/>
they compare types of light bulbs as well as<br/>
prices and figure out how much change they&#39;ll<br/>
get if they buy two bulbs for $1.99 and pay<br/>
with a five dollar bill.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, a discussion develops over<br/>
the history of money and also Abraham Lincoln,<br/>
as his picture is on the five dollar bill.<br/>
Finally, after building a homemade ladder out<br/>
of branches dragged from the woods, the light<br/>
bulb is installed. And there is light.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Got this from another list.<br/>
