I did not see where anyone accused you of being dysfunctional and co-dep;<br/>
possibly I missed it from trying to bypass some of the more ridiculous turns<br/>
some discuaaions have taken in recent weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I must say,  however,  that I see in your post the attempt to inflame the<br/>
issue.  If you see Sandra&#39;s post about abuse as directed at you<br/>
personally......I&#39;ve gotta say I wonder what inside of YOU made you see it<br/>
that way - ? - ? -<br/>
<br/>
I noticed you used the word ASSUME in your response,  as in &quot;I can only<br/>
 assume you lump me into that category too.&quot;   Please remember what happens<br/>
when one ASSumes!<br/>

foot/shoe information.......I&#39;m trying to get back on track!!!!  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Subject: abuse<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;You are abusing your child if you aren&#39;t parenting exactly like<br/>
&gt; me.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think the implication was that you weren&#39;t unschooling, not that it<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt;abusive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, I was told that we are dysfunctional and co-dependent.  I was<br/>
&gt; told I am not unschooling before any of you had anything but an inkling<br/>
&gt; of how my household runs.  I&#39;ve seen enough to turn that back on every<br/>
&gt; one of the people who said it. but I haven&#39;t done it.  What I have<br/>
&gt; realized is that many of the very people who were accusing me of being<br/>
&gt; too rigid with my children are actually MORE rigid than I am and seem to<br/>
&gt; respect their children less.  At least that is what could be taken from<br/>
&gt; several posts I&#39;ve read since then.  But, I haven&#39;t generalized or made<br/>
&gt; assumptions about the people posting because I understand that I am just<br/>
&gt; seeing a little sliver of their lives.  I may comment on what they have<br/>
&gt; said but I don&#39;t extrapolate from the fact that one does not allow her<br/>
&gt; child to ride a bike alone that she also forces her to sit and write<br/>
&gt; sentences against her will all day long.  That would be as unfair as<br/>
&gt; assuming that because my family has a job list, I must have coerced them<br/>
&gt; into it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And Sandra, here is what you said:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; #26320<br/>
&gt; And some of them are NOT doing the best they can do, they have a<br/>
&gt; veneer-thin overlay<br/>
&gt; of justification for child abuse, or they themselves are so hard-hearted<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; cold that they don&#39;t see that their children are being harmed to the<br/>
&gt; point<br/>
&gt; that they, those children, could become a danger to all of OUR children<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; their frustration.<br/>
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In light of recent conversations, and the fact that you insisted on<br/>
&gt; telling me that my children must be depressed because of me, I can only<br/>
&gt; assume you lump me into that category too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At least one person on this list still insists on painting me as an<br/>
&gt; abusive mother of a dysfunctional family and, yeah, I resent that.  And<br/>
&gt; yet not a single person has asked if my children are HAPPY before<br/>
&gt; condemning me.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; From what I remember of reading, just the beginning of the book.<br/>
&gt; There is no cosmic right or wrong.  That is something we humans have<br/>
&gt; invented.  There is just experience.  God wants to experience, and we<br/>
&gt; (which are really factors of him/it/....) are what is used to do that.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure lovemary will correct any misconceptions I may have gotten<br/>
&gt; from the first few chapters.  I did find the book very interesting,<br/>
&gt; but my aunt stopped sending me the chapters she was photocopying so I<br/>
&gt; and others could read it, and I never went and got the book myself.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I really resent the implication that because I dont have this<br/>
&gt; belief that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; am dishonest or pretending. . . that is total lack of respect for<br/>
&gt; anothers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; views.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps the questioning feels like an attack and as though people<br/>
&gt; are trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get you to change your mind. But people are really just trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand. This philosophy raises a lot of questions and basically<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; the only one who can answer them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The philosophy seems to be saying in a way what the Indian greeting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Namaste&quot; says: &quot;I honor that place in you where the whole Universe<br/>
&gt; resides.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And when I am in that place in me and you are in that place in you,<br/>
&gt; there is<br/>
&gt; &gt; only one of us.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can see how getting people to a place where they can feel that<br/>
&gt; everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; soul is equal would be a peacefilled place. I can see respecting<br/>
&gt; that people<br/>
&gt; &gt; are where they are because their journey has been much different. I<br/>
&gt; can see<br/>
&gt; &gt; how someone feeling pride that their position is superior to other<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; could make the prideful person stop growing and self-examining.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can see that judgementalism and pride can lead to some unhealthy<br/>
&gt; places.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But I&#39;m not seeing how eliminating judgementalism and pride -- if<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; what this philosophy is about -- doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s own pitfalls.<br/>
&gt; (Which is<br/>
&gt; &gt; all that people are asking in their own way.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How would your philosophy handle abusive, hurtful parenting and<br/>
&gt; nurturing<br/>
&gt; &gt; parenting? I can&#39;t see how one isn&#39;t better than the other. How can<br/>
&gt; eating<br/>
&gt; &gt; food not be better than eating sand? How can music not be better<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; &gt; fingernails on a chalkboard?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Too often, I think, people judge things on a limited number of<br/>
&gt; factors, eg,<br/>
&gt; &gt; a more expensive bigger house is better than a less expensive<br/>
&gt; smaller house.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yet there are hundreds of factors that could make the smaller house<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; suitable in a particular situation. How does the philosophy avoid<br/>
&gt; &gt; acknowledging that more suitable isn&#39;t better? That pros<br/>
&gt; outweighing cons<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t better?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But sometimes one factor is all it takes, eg, a family style that<br/>
&gt; creates<br/>
&gt; &gt; loving people versus one that creates hatefilled people.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m very confused and just trying to understand.<br/>

&gt; Description - Jicama, a legume, is grown for the large tuberous roots<br/>
&gt; which can be eaten raw or cooked and are used as a source of starch.<br/>
&gt; The jicama plant is a vine which grows to a length of 20 feet or<br/>
&gt; more. The roots are light brown in color, and may weigh up to 50<br/>
&gt; pounds. Most of those on the market will weigh between three to five<br/>
&gt; pounds.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This topic reminds me of Zen and the Art of Motorcyle Maintenance, the<br/>
&gt; topic of the whole book was quality/goodness/arete/virtue, chose your own<br/>
&gt; term. A basic idea, as I recall,  was that we naturally know quality when<br/>
&gt; we see it, even if we can&#39;t define why something is good. Somewhere were<br/>
&gt; the lines: &quot;And what is good, Phaedrus? And what is not good? Need we ask<br/>
&gt; anyone to tell us these things?&quot; I think it&#39;s true, and I think it ties<br/>
&gt; in to unschooling - we naturally see good, know what is right, learn what<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d define that as unschooling. I think part of the &quot;job&quot; of<br/>

&gt; Can it be battered and fried? Do they save well?<br/>
&gt; Sounds interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does it grow on a HUGE vine and look sorta like a<br/>
&gt; gourd? I think I saw some in a gardner&#39;s catalogue,<br/>
&gt; maybe.  The only grocery within an hour or so of here<br/>
&gt; has never carried them. Perhaps I could grow some next<br/>
&gt; year. Love new stuff once in a while.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It looks like a fat turnip, and tastes like a cross<br/>
&gt; &gt; between a potato and an<br/>
&gt; &gt; apple.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s eaten sliced and dipped in salt, or sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; sliced thin for salad<br/>
&gt; &gt; bars.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It comes from Mexico and is pronounced HICK a ma &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t mean to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings.  I was hoping people were<br/>
&gt; willing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; answer &quot;Why do you think that?&quot; questions without feeling attacked.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So in message #25250 when you (Sandra) were using the pronouns &#39;you&#39;<br/>
&gt; and &#39;your&#39;, I was not suppose to asume you(Sandra) were saying that<br/>
&gt; you(Sandra) believe that I(Bridget) did nothing with my kids but<br/>
&gt; medicate them and that you(Sandra) would be depressed too if you<br/>
&gt; lived with me(Bridget).<br/>
&gt; That whole exchange was with the list and you were REALLY saying that<br/>
&gt; the entire list does nothing with their children.  Is that what you<br/>
&gt; are saying here?  That when you say something that looks spiteful and<br/>
&gt; mean, we are to assume it is just a question, whether it appears that<br/>
&gt; way or not?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yes, I know that the exchange that prompted your words above was<br/>
&gt; not with me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
