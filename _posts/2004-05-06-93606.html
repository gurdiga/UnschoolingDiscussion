<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770463867">Hi, all!  My name is Tina.  I&#39;m new to the group.  I think <br/>
my &quot;waiting period&quot; is up, so I am eager to start picking your <br/>
brains.  That is, of course, if you feel like sharing.<br/>
<br/>
We are a combined family of seven children.  They are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Tabitha, 18 - Public School Senior<br/>
Amy, 17 - Public School Senior<br/>
Tammi and Tracey, 16 - Public School Junior<br/>
Amie, 14 - Charter School 8th Grade<br/>
Andrew, 12 - Charter School 6th Grade<br/>
Adrian, 10 - Home School <br/>
<br/>
I shared the above to give you a feel for the dynamics of our <br/>
family.  It&#39;s a VERY long story...Amy, 17 and Adrian, 10 are my <br/>
biological children.  I learned about homeschooling too late to start <br/>
with Amy, or so I thought.  Right from the beginning, we knew that we <br/>
were going to home school Adrian due to the terrible school system.  <br/>
We just didn&#39;t want to put another child in that system.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not figured out how to LEGALLY homeschool Amie and Andrew, <br/>
otherwise I would for sure.  They actually request to be home <br/>
schooled.  I do include them in our summer activities as learning is <br/>
a year long practice not devided into quarters and holidays.<br/>
<br/>
I started homeschooling Adrian from the beginning and only made it <br/>
through to kindergarden as we thought the smart choice was to put our <br/>
three youngest in a highly acclaimed partnership school.  Bad choice <br/>
there!  Live and learn.  Fortunately, I continuously educate myself.  <br/>
After changes were made to the educational institution that we <br/>
enrolled them in we quickly figured out that it would not work for <br/>
our family.  I pulled Adrian out after Christmas break in third grade.<br/>
<br/>
Since that time I have read numerous books.  I am a true book worm, <br/>
so this comes completely natural.  I love research, so what better <br/>
topic?  We started out very scheduled because that was what Adrian <br/>
wanted.  Our lives continued to shift and change, so it warranted <br/>
change in our approach to education.  Throughout our journey I have <br/>
learned more and more about the philosophy of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We have instituted the philosophy of unschooling in our home this <br/>
year.  So, needless to say it is VERY new to us.  I understand and <br/>
agree with the philosophy to the best of my ability.  I know it&#39;s a <br/>
journey and a process, especially given our history.  We are <br/>
currently reading &quot;I Learn Better by Teaching Myself&quot; by Agnes <br/>
Leistico and plan to read the follow up book &quot;Still Teaching <br/>
Ourselves&quot; as soon as we finish this one.  I thought it a good idea <br/>
for us to read it together.  I wanted Adrian to have a little <br/>
understanding of what we were doing, and he absolutely loves to be <br/>
read to.<br/>
<br/>
After all that, my question is this:<br/>
<br/>
How do you make it through the boredom stage?  Right now he doesn&#39;t <br/>
do a whole lot.  When I ask him what he&#39;s interested in he <br/>
says, &quot;Nothing.&quot;  I know that eventually he will get into something, <br/>
but what is so called normal for this time period of adjustment?  We <br/>
have made it through things that were difficult for me to not <br/>
interfere with like playing PS2 all day, everyday.  I know and accept <br/>
that this is perfectly normal and acceptable in the unschooling <br/>
philosoply, but it goes against everything ingrained in our heads.  <br/>
You know where I&#39;m coming from.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has gone through this from a <br/>
similar situation.  I&#39;d love to hear how you and your children <br/>
adjusted as former institutional schoolers, to structured <br/>
homeschoolers, to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I welcome your wisdom...<br/>
<br/>

what he has around him.<br/>
<br/>
What else are you offering? What are you doing with him? Part of unschooling<br/>
is exposing them to the world and being with them. Sometimes being with them<br/>
means being available and being aware of their needs while giving them the<br/>
time and space to explore. Sometimes being with them means *being with them*<br/>
as in playing with them, watching TV with them, sharing your favorite shows<br/>
with them, listening to books on tape in the car with them, having<br/>
conversations, inviting them along to be with you while you do things around<br/>
the house.<br/>

<br/>
I think you misunderstood.  He went through a stage where he played <br/>
PS2 all the time.  He still plays PS2, but he does not play it all <br/>
day anymore.  He has been spending some time outside lately.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been offering various books, opportunities to cook, he <br/>
participated in helping to plan a cooking class for local homeschool <br/>
kids that I offer once per month to a few local groups we belong to, <br/>
we talk a lot, read, watch History Channel (his choice, not mine), <br/>
etc.  He has a lot of opportunities presented daily.  There is no <br/>
lack of opportunity or myself.  I am with him everyday and <br/>
available.  I gues my concern is that he seems so &quot;blah.&quot;  I can&#39;t <br/>
really say one thing that he is excited about.  I just want him to <br/>
have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Please bear in mind that I am not forcing anything on him or <br/>
following him around expressing my concern.  These are just my <br/>
thoughts from observing and participating in his day.  I&#39;ve read <br/>
about children going through &quot;stages&quot; where they aren&#39;t into much of <br/>
anything.  I was just wondering in anyone else has experienced the <br/>
same thing with any of their children.<br/>

school for five or six years.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tina,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m jumping in a little late here, and am far from expert, but can <br/>
share a little bit of what has happened with us.  I&#39;ve only been <br/>
doing this 2 years... 1 1/2 years unschooling.  The adjustment was <br/>
awkward and we initially had periods of boredom... I know what <br/>
you&#39;re talking about anyway.  Initially when you&#39;re doing scheduled <br/>
stuff or whatnot, you don&#39;t have time to be bored but you sure have <br/>
time to be miserable.  Suddenly, you have all this time to do what <br/>
you want and you just don&#39;t have a clue what in the world to do.  So <br/>
accustomed to being told &quot;do this, then that&quot; etc.  Is he fully <br/>
aware that he can really do almost anything he wants?  When this <br/>
kicked in with my youngest (now almost 8) he spents weeks just <br/>
cutting paper up into little pieces and making a huge mess... but he <br/>
was content.  Then the pieces began to take form... animals, <br/>
letters, etc.  That&#39;s done now.  :)  He&#39;s finally &quot;got it&quot; that if <br/>
he comes up with an idea that&#39;s remotely doable (and most everything <br/>
is doable at least on some level...be creative), he can go for it. <br/>
<br/>
He spent the first year at home taking everything apart - toys, <br/>
broken electronics, etc.  I just supervised the screwdrivers, etc.  <br/>
The last couple of months he&#39;s been building completely new things <br/>
out of all these random parts and having a good old time.  He also <br/>
uses cardboard, books, shoes, cooking spoons, whatever, to build <br/>
roadways and garages, etc, for his toy cars... and cars are his <br/>
thing.  He likes toys that are replicas of actual vehicles you&#39;d see <br/>
on the road.  He can spot a cadillac from 3 blocks away (one of his <br/>
faves)... followed by the late 60&#39;s mustang.  lol... (more my speed <br/>
there)<br/>
<br/>
He also spends a lot of time in the tree outside tying a rope in a <br/>
hundred different ways... creating some combo of an obstacle course <br/>
and additional climbing/navigating options... one day he asked for a <br/>
rope... we bought it... he&#39;s played with it til it&#39;s brown!  It&#39;s <br/>
only been a few weeks.  1,000 different uses... that I never thought <br/>
of.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I ask... does your son completely grasp that any idea that <br/>
he comes up with is an idea worth pursuing?  Or is he still in <br/>
schooly mode where you can&#39;t cross those &quot;lines&quot; or make a mess?  My <br/>
house is a perpetual mess of clay creations, parts of things that <br/>
were once whole... magazine clippings (my daughter - 14 spent the <br/>
entire day yesterday building a scrap book from magazine <br/>
clippings... she&#39;s taking a fashion design class and has suddenly <br/>
developed an interest in wedding planning!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an adjustment, yes, I can speak to that.  And we still have <br/>
times that I hear &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;... so I ask... if you could do <br/>
anything right now, what would it be?  And from there we brainstorm <br/>
and build.  :)  &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; happens less and less often as time goes <br/>
by though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still plodding along myself.  But maybe this can help?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It was a years-long road and very bumpy for this former teacher with <br/>
a pretty domineering personality.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quick recap - 3 children. Traditionally schooled and parented until <br/>
the oldest was going into 6th grade. School-at-home and traditional <br/>
parenting for the next 3 years. Oldest son goes back to ps in 9th <br/>
grade. Unschooling and traditional parenting for the next 3 - 4 <br/>
years. Middle son goes back to ps in 9th grade. Unschooling and <br/>
mindful parenting last 2-3 years.  Daughter not seriously considering <br/>
going to 9th grade - although she does mention it from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling didn&#39;t blossom until I stepped away from traditional <br/>
parenting.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
BTW - older brothers&#39; current advice to daughter this past<br/>
weekend - don&#39;t go to high school  :-)<br/>

Thank you so much for sharing your experience.  It&#39;s nice to hear <br/>
from someone who&#39;s &quot;been there, done that.&quot;  I don&#39;t know that he <br/>
fully grasps the concept, yet.  We&#39;ve both kind of been winging it.  <br/>
I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get the hang of it sooner or later.<br/>
<br/>
I like your suggestion of asking him what he would do if he could do <br/>
anything he wanted.  I think I&#39;ll try that one out for size.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for sharing...<br/>

&gt; stuff or whatnot, you don&#39;t have time to be bored but you sure have <br/>
&gt; time to be miserable.  Suddenly, you have all this time to do what <br/>

&gt; cutting paper up into little pieces and making a huge mess... but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; He spent the first year at home taking everything apart - toys, <br/>
&gt; broken electronics, etc.  I just supervised the screwdrivers, etc.  <br/>
&gt; The last couple of months he&#39;s been building completely new things <br/>
&gt; out of all these random parts and having a good old time.  He also <br/>
&gt; uses cardboard, books, shoes, cooking spoons, whatever, to build <br/>
&gt; roadways and garages, etc, for his toy cars... and cars are his <br/>
&gt; thing.  He likes toys that are replicas of actual vehicles you&#39;d <br/>

&gt; faves)... followed by the late 60&#39;s mustang.  lol... (more my speed <br/>
&gt; there)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He also spends a lot of time in the tree outside tying a rope in a <br/>
&gt; hundred different ways... creating some combo of an obstacle course <br/>
&gt; and additional climbing/navigating options... one day he asked for <br/>

&gt; developed an interest in wedding planning!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s an adjustment, yes, I can speak to that.  And we still have <br/>
&gt; times that I hear &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;... so I ask... if you could do <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has gone through this from a <br/>
&gt; similar situation. I&#39;d love to hear how you and your children <br/>
&gt; adjusted as former institutional schoolers, to structured <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers, to unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was a years-long road and very bumpy for this former teacher <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; a pretty domineering personality.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quick recap - 3 children. Traditionally schooled and parented until <br/>
&gt; the oldest was going into 6th grade. School-at-home and traditional <br/>
&gt; parenting for the next 3 years. Oldest son goes back to ps in 9th <br/>
&gt; grade. Unschooling and traditional parenting for the next 3 - 4 <br/>
&gt; years. Middle son goes back to ps in 9th grade. Unschooling and <br/>
&gt; mindful parenting last 2-3 years.  Daughter not seriously <br/>
considering <br/>
&gt; going to 9th grade - although she does mention it from time to time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling didn&#39;t blossom until I stepped away from traditional <br/>
&gt; parenting.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; BTW - older brothers&#39; current advice to daughter this past<br/>
&gt; weekend - don&#39;t go to high school  :-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meanwhile, back at the same ranch, he has a mom who probably went to school <br/>

&gt;at the same time work not to let her own school-brain and school years keep <br/>
&gt;him from enjoying his new awareness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, actually.....<br/>
<br/>
I spent 15 years in school / university - and I&#39;m now 52yo and STILL <br/>
working on it!!  So, you see there&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; and there&#39;s those like me <br/>
that are not &quot;normal&#39; - but that&#39;s no reason for me to stop trying, stop <br/>
working on it.  And there are those who take much less than what is <br/>
&quot;normal&quot; - lucky them.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is unique and has to find their own way.  Adults and children. <br/>
If we are lucky we have a mother or a mentor like Sandra to help us <br/>
along our way, but even then there are those of us that find our way <br/>
more slowly.  But that doesn&#39;t mean we are bad, or worse than others, or <br/>
in need of someone to tell us what to do. It just means we are taking <br/>
longer to learn to be at ease with our own selves.<br/>
<br/>
Boredom and &#39;blah-ness&#39; are not bad things, IMO.  They happen when the <br/>
old way of being is (mostly) cleared out, and the new way of being is <br/>
still being found.  It has happened again and again over the years for <br/>
me.  I find an enthusiasm, a passion, for something and life is so <br/>
exciting.  Then the enthusiasm disappears or fades to something less all <br/>
consuming, and I get bored, blah, and settle down to a period of &#39;doing <br/>
nothing&#39; but  reading indiscriminately, feeling blah blah, - then just <br/>
when I think that I&#39;m going to be bored for the rest of my life, some <br/>
new, or revitalised passion enters my life.<br/>
<br/>
If I am nagged to &#39;do things&#39; it actually slows down the clearing out <br/>
period and so also delays the revitalisation process.<br/>

*MY* question is: What are YOU doing?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a busy girl myself. Sometimes the boys are just along for the ride. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not hosting the conference this year, so I&#39;ve had a bit more free time! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  I got two bee hives two weeks ago---I&#39;m a beekeeper! We just got back from <br/>
the Lake Eden Arts Festival---three days of art and music and food and <br/>
peaceful people sharing a mountain top. We picked up our new guide dog puppy this <br/>
morning---a nine week old vizsla puppy named Ryan. I just finished planting my <br/>
vegetable garden. I am GOING to finish tiling the upstairs bathroom that I <br/>
started last summer! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The boys enjoy watching the bees, loved LEAF, can&#39;t stop snuggling the new <br/>
pup, will devour the tomatoes and beans from the garden (they&#39;ll weed a little <br/>
bit too), and will be delighted to have a working toilet and tub in their <br/>
bathroom! <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s life----be busy! It&#39;ll rub off on the children!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468650785">I don&#39;t know that I could be busier.  The hard part about where he is <br/>
right now for me is that he wants me to watch movies with him.  Once <br/>
I stop moving I get SO sleepy that I fall asleep during the movie.  <br/>
Also, it&#39;s VERY hard for me to sit there and do nothing while we&#39;re <br/>
watching it.  I need to be doing something.  Even when I&#39;m watching <br/>
television I am reading, making a list, drawing (on those rare <br/>
moments with MY American Girl kit :), planning something, doing the <br/>
bills, etc.  He doesn&#39;t like it if I don&#39;t pay attention to the movie <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
I took him to the Mt. Clemens Craft Show on the spur of the moment <br/>
last Friday.  I included him in the planning of our next cooking <br/>
class, tomorrow.  He planned Mexican food, his favorite and helped me <br/>
shop for the ingredients that we need.  It&#39;s hard to keep his <br/>
attention for too long, but at least he&#39;s showing SOME interest.  <br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s at his dad&#39;s house he has started writing comics.  I&#39;ve not <br/>
seen any yet, and it&#39;s only been one time, but maybe there&#39;s <br/>
something to that.  He does have a lot of adult interaction in his <br/>
life, but not a lot of child interaction.  That does bother me <br/>
sometimes, but I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s really a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think I got a little off there.  I think the key for me is <br/>
to notice what WE are doing TOGETHER.  Am I getting that right?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina<br/>

&gt; really say one thing that he is excited about.  I just want him to <br/>
&gt; have fun.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *MY* question is: What are YOU doing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a busy girl myself. Sometimes the boys are just along for the <br/>
ride. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not hosting the conference this year, so I&#39;ve had a bit more <br/>
free time! <br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;  I got two bee hives two weeks ago---I&#39;m a beekeeper! We just <br/>
got back from <br/>
&gt; the Lake Eden Arts Festival---three days of art and music and food <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; peaceful people sharing a mountain top. We picked up our new guide <br/>
dog puppy this <br/>
&gt; morning---a nine week old vizsla puppy named Ryan. I just finished <br/>
planting my <br/>
&gt; vegetable garden. I am GOING to finish tiling the upstairs bathroom <br/>
that I <br/>
&gt; started last summer! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The boys enjoy watching the bees, loved LEAF, can&#39;t stop snuggling <br/>
the new <br/>
&gt; pup, will devour the tomatoes and beans from the garden (they&#39;ll <br/>
weed a little <br/>
&gt; bit too), and will be delighted to have a working toilet and tub in <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; bathroom! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s life----be busy! It&#39;ll rub off on the children!<br/>

like you described, when I slow down and the lights are low and we&#39;re <br/>
&quot;doing nothing but&quot; watching something on the tv/a movie.  But my <br/>

the movies that it seems like they really want me to watch with them.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have some other kids close to his age who could start up a <br/>
&quot;movie night?&quot; Let them pick the movies, parents take turns providing <br/>
pizza and sodas and popcorn.  Make it a weekly or every-other-week <br/>
event. Maybe somebody has a big-screen. Or maybe you could see if a <br/>
small movie theater in town will open up early and show a movie to <br/>
homeschoolers. Or maybe you could just make a regular &quot;movie time&quot; for <br/>
homeschoolers to meet at a theater. Or, join Netflix and let him create <br/>
the movie queue - reading reviews and rating movies he&#39;s seen in order <br/>
to get Netflix&#39;s individualized recommendations. Start watching movies <br/>
on a theme - an event or time period in history, or about dogs, or <br/>
about polar adventures or a particular writer or director&#39;s movies or <br/>
foreign movies or indy movies.  Start a blog about movies you&#39;ve <br/>
watched together and both of you write a little blurb about what you <br/>
liked (or didn&#39;t like) about each. Or .... lots of possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s interested in movies and in you watching with him, then THAT is <br/>
what you have to support. You can&#39;t just wait for that interest to <br/>
pass, hoping that a new interest that suits you better will take its <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
You build his enthusiasm by supporting what he is interested in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186633233">I&#39;m hearing a lot of &quot;that just doesn&#39;t sound interesting&quot; here.  <br/>
What is being forgotten is that this IS what he is interested in.  <br/>
The one thing that he says every year that he wants to do is COOK.  <br/>
He likes it.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the craft show goes, he did enjoy that too.  The reason I <br/>
decided to stop was because it&#39;s FREE EXPOSURE to MANY different <br/>
styles of art.  Art is something he has been exploring, and I thought <br/>
it may be fun to see just how creative people can be.  Plus, he is <br/>
really into money, so he was interested in how much everything cost.  <br/>
We didn&#39;t linger.  In fact we only spent about a half hour there.  <br/>
(On the contrary, I went back the next day with a friend and spent <br/>
four hours there:)  He enjoyed the REAL wildlife photography, stained <br/>
glass art, wood working and cool yard stuff made from tools.  <br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate your suggestions on the movie watching.  That&#39;s a <br/>
wonderful idea.  As far as more sleep goes, not likely.  :)  If you <br/>
read my introduction, you may understand...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m definately taking the suggestion on setting something up on a <br/>
regular basis.  That a great idea.  Also, I have been thinking about <br/>
looking into the NetFlix thing, so that may be an option as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great ideas!<br/>

<br/>
Have you tried watching movies in the mornings or at lunchtime?<br/>
<br/>
My best things to do while watching movies (so that I can still pay <br/>
attention) are sorting and folding laundry, and splitting kindling.  We&#39;re off season <br/>
for that latter one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I took him to the Mt. Clemens Craft Show on the spur of the moment <br/>
<br/>
last Friday. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If he likes that sort of thing that was good. If he felt like his mom took <br/>
him to a girlie (or old lady) thing, it&#39;s not as good.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I think the key for me is <br/>
<br/>
to notice what WE are doing TOGETHER.  Am I getting that right?-=-<br/>

Maybe it&#39;s a key, or a puzzle part, but it&#39;s not THE key.<br/>

You started off here by saying your son says he is bored and that he <br/>
isn&#39;t interested in anything. You wanted to know how long it takes and <br/>
how to get through that period of adjustment until he gets into <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
But now you&#39;re saying that he IS interested in things. And you keep <br/>
talking about things he&#39;s been interested in and things he is exploring <br/>
(like saying &quot;Art is something he has been exploring.)<br/>
<br/>
So - can you once maybe try, in the light of what has been talked about <br/>
here,  to re-explain what your question really is? He&#39;s not bored, <br/>
right? He&#39;s interested in lots of different things. You do things <br/>
together that he likes. He&#39;s enthusiastic about the things you take him <br/>
to, like the crafts show. He likes to cook. He likes you to read to <br/>
him. He likes to watch movies.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re a type A personality and he&#39;s not? Maybe you&#39;re just <br/>
expecting him to be super busy like you are? Maybe he&#39;s more laid back <br/>
and is satisfied with what&#39;s already going on in his life? Maybe it is <br/>
you who is not satisfied with him?<br/>

you take him to, like the crafts show. He likes to cook. He likes you <br/>
to read to him. He likes to watch movies.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let me try again.  He told me himself that he is bored.  I use <br/>
the term &quot;interested&quot; loosely.  When we talk about what he is <br/>
interested in conversations he always wants to do more with cooking.  <br/>
That&#39;s not to say that he&#39;s doing much with it.  I try to keep <br/>
opportunity available so that he has opportunity to do what he says <br/>
he&#39;s interested in.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;exploring art&quot; goes.  He has begun an interest in comics.  <br/>
He&#39;s not been too artistically inclined for about a year or more.  He <br/>
got a little discouraged by two of our other childen&#39;s natural <br/>
ability budding.  He is a perfectionist and doesn&#39;t want to do <br/>
anything he can&#39;t do perfectly.  That comes into play with the art.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the beauty of a list like this.  Maybe it took me &quot;talking&quot; to <br/>
you all to realize that there are things that spark his interest.  <br/>
He&#39;s just not really into anything, and maybe it bothers me to see <br/>
him so blah so often.  I remember reading that children in this <br/>
situation go through that and that it&#39;s normal.  That is the reason I <br/>
posted about it.  I thought it would be encouraging to hear what <br/>
others have been through in similar situations.<br/>
<br/>
Since we have been discussing this topic he has been a bit more <br/>
active.  He&#39;s not laying around as much.  He&#39;s no longer wandering <br/>
around aimlessly with a blank expression on his face.  It has been <br/>
about a week now since I posted, and it had been going on for quite <br/>
some time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Maybe you&#39;re a type A personality and he&#39;s not? Maybe you&#39;re just <br/>
expecting him to be super busy like you are? Maybe he&#39;s more laid <br/>
back and is satisfied with what&#39;s already going on in his life? Maybe <br/>
it is you who is not satisfied with him?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never did retain all that personality information when I checked it <br/>
out years ago.  :) Maybe there&#39;s something to that.  He is very laid <br/>
back and doesn&#39;t like to be overstimulated.  He&#39;s more of a one on <br/>
one person, as am I.  I like a slower pace, but life doesn&#39;t allow <br/>
right now.  It&#39;s my ultimate goal in life to SLOW DOWN...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;Whatever the situation, though, &quot;Support his interests&quot; and &quot;Put <br/>
your focus on his strengths, not weaknesses you perceive in him,&quot; <br/>
will still apply.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is exactly what I am trying to do.<br/>
<br/>

I just wanted to chime in on Netflix....I signed up for this service a <br/>
few months back and LOVE it.  There&#39;s a distribution center in Lansing <br/>
so the turn around for movies in our area of MI is very quick.  Expect <br/>
a movie to arrive w/in 2 days (not including Sundays, of course).  When <br/>
I send a movie back they usually get it the very next day and send the <br/>
next movie out later that same day.<br/>
<br/>
Try it out for 14 days free and cancel if you don&#39;t like it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think you&#39;ll be disappointed though.  HTH and hope to meet you soon.  <br/>

What a small world!  I have recognized a few of the screen names <br/>

review of the service yet.  I know you are very happy with it.  What <br/>
I&#39;m wondering is if you find it financially reasonable.  We typically <br/>
get our movies and games from Family Video, and it&#39;s difficult to <br/>
beat their prices.  Well, unless it&#39;s the library.  It&#39;s hard to beat <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311525733">Pros of Netflix for us:<br/>
<br/>
* No due dates or late fees -- my kids like to watch a movie over and <br/>
over and over and we&#39;re able to do that without anyone getting upset <br/>
because it&#39;s due back on a certain day.  We keep it out as long as we <br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
* I don&#39;t really like to wander around the video store looking for a <br/>
movie to see and then get bummed out that it&#39;s out after all that.<br/>
<br/>
* I can surf Netflix&#39;s web site 24/7.<br/>
<br/>
* No need to venture out in a Michigan winter to return the movies.  <br/>
Just pop them back into the postage-paid return envelope and put them <br/>
in my mail box.<br/>
<br/>
* You can set up a &quot;Queue&quot; for your account and when you return a DVD <br/>
they&#39;ll send you the next one on your list automatically.  No having to <br/>
remember the name of the movie that you wanted to rent, but it wasn&#39;t <br/>
at the video store.  Just put it in your queue and you&#39;ll get it <br/>
eventually.  ;)  You can add up to 500 movies and are able to delete <br/>
and rearrange them any time.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the service is great and it&#39;s only $20 per month.  We&#39;d <br/>
end up paying more than that in late fees if we rented as many movies <br/>
as we do from Movie Mania or another local chain.  All I can say is <br/>
give it a try with their 14 day free trail.  If you think it isn&#39;t <br/>
worth it you just need to cancel your account.  :)  HTH<br/>

&gt; What I&#39;m wondering is if you find it financially reasonable.  We <br/>
&gt; typically<br/>
&gt; get our movies and games from Family Video, and it&#39;s difficult to<br/>
&gt; beat their prices.  Well, unless it&#39;s the library.  It&#39;s hard to beat<br/>
&gt; free!  :):) </span></blockquote></div>
