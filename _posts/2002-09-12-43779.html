<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361727064">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if everyone came to some very stark realizations when you started unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
My gosh, it touches so many angles in my life right now,  not just schooling/learning.  But all sort of things!  It makes you question practically all aspects of our lives.  Wow!<br/>
<br/>
The Continuum Concept also explains alot about our society and thinking too, IMO,(hey I included an abbreviation!)  Anyway....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all that have started to make me think and have opened my eyes!  Unfortunately not everyone in my life is ready to look at these things.<br/>

I think I have probably read these exact sentiments from someone else, and you regulars have probably heard it millions of times, but I needed to vent it!  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4228545">I agree Kelli T and I have found the most important life change has been that I can now approach everything and everyone with love and respect.  I don&#39;t feel the need to dominate or control any part of the world.  I know and trust the outcome will be what it is meant to be.  It&#39;s a complete blessing.<br/>

Well, not really, because we&#39;ve been unschooling right from the beginning, <br/>
mostly. But I used to notice that when I suggested a workbook, that my DD <br/>
would just *breeze* through a page or two, and I&#39;d realize I had worried <br/>
too much :) So now I don&#39;t worry any more, especially since joining this <br/>
list :-D<br/>
<br/>
Btw: Our kids are 9 & 7 :)<br/>

Summerhill and all of John Holt&#39;s books. I knew I&#39;d never force-feed <br/>
my child/children... food or learning.<br/>
