<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361466886">&lt;&lt;What do you all do to help develop organizational skills?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that we don&#39;t do anything.  I have 5 kids and they all<br/>
organize their lives differently.  I don&#39;t think one has better<br/>
organizational skills than another, only that they organize the world<br/>
differently.  My oldest has very obvious and easily recognizable structure<br/>
to her life, her room, her &quot;stuff&quot; in general.  My next oldest organizes<br/>
based on completely different criteria.<br/>
<br/>
When I start feeling that the kids aren&#39;t &quot;organized&quot;, i.e. can&#39;t find their<br/>
shoes, late for gymnastics, etc., it usually reflects more of a difference<br/>
in priorities rather than in skills.  My 8yo has no trouble whatsoever<br/>
remembering where his BB gun is or his hotwheels, but can never find his<br/>
boots to go feed the rabbits.  Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
But based on what you wrote, I would definitely drop it with the oldest<br/>
completely, unless she is specifically asking you for help.  If something<br/>
she is doing is interfering with you, like making you late, talk with her<br/>
about what could happen differently.<br/>
