<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062840620">I should know better than to forward along info I haven&#39;t checked.<br/>
<br/>
The message about Mars was true, but as it turns out, it&#39;s also old news by <br/>
about two years.<br/>
<br/>
The chance of a lifetime to see Mars close up WAS true, back in  August of <br/>
2003.  My apologies for telling you it would be *this* August.<br/>
<br/>
Bleahhh...<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, there are other things to learn about in the skies for your <br/>
kids this summer, and of course telescopes are still a great educational tool.<br/>
<br/>
skypub.com and astronomy.com both have lots of great announcements and <br/>
calendars for things to watch.<br/>
