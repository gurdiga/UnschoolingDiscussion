&lt;&lt; My good friend has dreads, and highly recommends it.  She is gorgeous.<br/>

   Our bf&#39;s gf had dreads then after about a year or so had to shave her hair <br/>
off. I&#39;d rather have braids but can&#39;t find anyone to do it here. Maybe when I <br/>
go home to PA. I&#39;ll make an appt. for my winter hair. How nice not to have to <br/>
pick through it each washing. Ahhhhh.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t suggest the poster go elsewhere.  Just asked if she was sure this<br/>
was the list she was looking for.  Lots of people confuse relaxed<br/>
homeschooling with unschooling.  How will they know if someone doesn&#39;t point<br/>
it out?<br/>
<br/>
Some people went to a diner and asked the waitress for a chocolate shake.<br/>
The waitress comes back with vanilla shakes all around and announces &quot;Here<br/>
is your chocolate shake.&quot;  All the calling it chocolate in the world isn&#39;t<br/>
going to make it change from vanilla, it is missing a vital ingredient.  The<br/>
two have lots of similar ingredients but a chocolate shake and a vanilla<br/>
shake are definitely different.  Not saying one is better, not saying one is<br/>
worse, but they are different.<br/>
<br/>
When people come to a place to discuss chocolate shakes, I don&#39;t think it is<br/>
inappropriate to point out when someone is actually talking about a vanilla<br/>
shake and ask them were they aware this place is about discussing chocolate,<br/>
particularly when there are a gazillion other places to discuss vanilla and<br/>
a very limited number to discuss chocolate.<br/>

Bridgett are you in your 20&#39;s?<br/>
Are you frustrated with your life?<br/>
Are you here just to argue?<br/>
<br/>
Because you&#39;re doing the written version of batting the palms of your hands <br/>

<br/>
And at this point, I think it is pointless to talk to you.  You have<br/>
decided that I am not an unschooler no matter what I say and therefore,<br/>
everything I say must be coming from some authoritarian parent.  I&#39;ve<br/>
heard nothing to indicate that you have even considered the possibility<br/>
that I might actually be an unschooler and that I was unjustly blasted<br/>
from day 2 on this list.<br/>
