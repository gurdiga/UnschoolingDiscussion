Don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with Facets Multimedia. They&#39;re located in Chicago and have a rent by mail system for unlimited movies-$24.00 a month , I think. They&#39;re one of the largest video (dvd) and film distributors in the country specializing in rare, foreign, and out of print films. They have Liquid Sky.<br/>

  We are new Netflixers and so far I love it.  We&#39;ve had on unplayable, which<br/>
  they replaced.  And there has only been one movie I wanted which they don&#39;t<br/>
  have.  (Liquid Sky.  -sob-)<br/>
