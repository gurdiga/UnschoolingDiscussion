&gt; My son 17 is working as an apprentice doing dry wall with my friends<br/>
&gt; husband. He says he would rather do that than go to college. So we did not<br/>
&gt; force him to go and take the music classes he had previously chosen. I know<br/>
&gt; he likes music more than doing dry wall we have talked about that in the<br/>
&gt; past. I am worried he will give up his music and be a dry waller just<br/>
&gt; because he is afraid to go to school! I wonder sometimes how to get them<br/>
&gt; out of their comfort zone and try something new and challenging!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe he likes music so much he doesn&#39;t want to do it for a career. Maybe<br/>
&quot;the study of it&quot; in a formal, graded setting would put his teeth on edge.<br/>
<br/>
Drywall guys make good money. Certainly enough to support a loved amateur<br/>
career in music if it didn&#39;t pay for itself. He may much prefer to sweat<br/>
during the day and play for fun at night rather than do some bread-earning<br/>
thing with music during the day and do the good parts of music at night.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved books since I read &quot;Are You My Mother&quot; in first grade, but I<br/>
couldn&#39;t find a good and fun way to make a career of them until three years<br/>
ago. I&#39;ll be 35 in a few days. I love to write more than anything, but at<br/>
this time I don&#39;t want to study it, or try to earn my money from it. I may<br/>
change my mind. Your son may change his.<br/>
<br/>
My first boyfriend was the son of a very well-published author. He loved to<br/>
draw more than he loved to breathe. He was a quirky, talented artist who<br/>
drew in abstract. His mother wanted him to draw &quot;real things&quot; and sell them.<br/>
This was not what he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
What makes you think that it&#39;s fear that is keeping him from school? (That&#39;s<br/>
a real question, not sarcastic, I&#39;m curious).<br/>

<br/>
Hi-<br/>
<br/>
We have a small moving business in Colorado. If it&#39;s any consolation, most of <br/>
the guys that work for us are college grads.  We had an especially good crew <br/>
a few years ago from Bates College.  One was working for us part time to <br/>
supplement his real job in a homeless shelter (a philosophy major).  One of <br/>
our new guys is a recent Cornell graduate, one has  a journalism degree, one <br/>
has a degree in something related to the physics of water, but I&#39;m not sure <br/>
what that is.   These guys comes and go and the thing they seem to have in <br/>
common is a state of flux plus strong interests that they are pursuing <br/>
independent of the education they have.  One musician who worked for us is <br/>
touring the US now with a 10 piece mambo-samba-tango type Latin band.  Doing <br/>
blue collar work  paid for his expenses while they got the band together and <br/>
started getting regular bookings.<br/>
<br/>
I think my point is that your son will be ok.  These young men are full of <br/>
energy and life and will work it out.  (Though I know your angst.  My <br/>
brilliant 16yo son is happy to work with his dad while I worry about his <br/>
talents wasting away....)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck-<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Flow dynamics maybe?  Or hydro engineering?  <br/>
All that stuff fascinates me.  I love to hear stories.  Probably part of that <br/>
fascination comes from living in New Meixco, where water comes down really <br/>
hard sometimes and roars down arroyos just to disappear, and it&#39;s all dry in <br/>
a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
Very good point about college grads working drywall after.  And being <br/>
waiters, and working at Hollywood Video.  And having to pay off college loans <br/>
while their co-workers get new cars and can afford the payments.<br/>

That sounds right.  He&#39;s moving on to a job with the National Center for <br/>
Atmospheric Research so maybe it&#39;s the flow from way up all the way down.<br/>
