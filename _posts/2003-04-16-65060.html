would, only even better.  I&#39;m really hoping that my sons will choose<br/>
partners who will want to parent in a similar way.  I try not to think about<br/>
how I&#39;ll act if they don&#39;t.  I know I&#39;ll be done parenting them, and it will<br/>
be their choice by then.  I&#39;m practicing now in how I say something when I<br/>
*do* think Heather should look at a different way of doing things.  So far<br/>
(and I think she agrees) I&#39;ve been able to get them to look at my ideas by<br/>
offering my *suggestions* respectfully and with a &quot;try looking at it this<br/>
way&quot; attitude.<br/>
