<div id="ygrps-yiv-521012026">This is the first in a series of bits I&#39;ve written over the last months, from the very earliest stirrings of our awakening into unschooling.  I&#39;m hoping they&#39;ll together chart our growth, and maybe show how it all unfolds for those who feel overwhelmed by what their heart needs.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of what&#39;s here is embarrassing, some makes me ashamed.  But it&#39;s who I was, on Tuesday, November 18, 2008 at 8:43pm (according to the Facebook note tag).  There will be accounts from a bit further in our evolution, hopefully sooner than later. =)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested, I have my comments which were included in the ensuing discussion.  And feel free to comment on any of it - aybe it&#39;ll help someone else out there pass this place with more joy....<br/>

My Parenting Challenge....<br/>
<br/>
My biggest parenting challenge during the last several months has been cleaning. Or, rather, getting the little tornadoes that share my living space (and sometimes the big spousal tornado, too, but that&#39;s another issue) to simply clean up and put away what they&#39;ve used.<br/>
<br/>
I am lucky. My children are bright, happy, and healthy. Giggles and squeals of laughter are commonly bounding about in our little home. They get along well with each other, invent wonderful games of fantasy....and leave stuff EVERYWHERE. Both love every artistic medium they&#39;ve encountered, books, music, building toys and puzzles. Both love to role play. My daughter will spend an entire afternoon hosting tea parties and birthdays for an eclectic collection of invisible, baby doll, and stuffed primate friends (two of these, a red monkey and a three foot gorilla, are nearly bigger than she is!). And, of course, she must do this dressed up (in whatever required the most pulling-and-tossing to get to!).<br/>
<br/>
My son is a self-professed artist/sculptor/scientist/inventor. Lately, he&#39;s gotten into spying, and often eavesdrops on adult conversations (Again, that&#39;s another issue). And he reads. Constantly. And I, the bibliophile mother who swore the only thing she&#39;d ever disown her children for was NOT loving books, grit my teeth as I try to avoid the current pile he&#39;s devouring.<br/>
<br/>
My greatest triumph? That I realized after seven years, that this is not their problem, but mine.<br/>
<br/>
We are raising our children in a manner often called unschooling. Rather than make demands, to insist that they obey because we the parents say they must, we&#39;ve decided to treat them as equals...not equal in experience, knowledge, or decision-making to be sure, but equal as unique beings in this world, with the same need for respect, love, and dignity as any adult.<br/>
<br/>
So now I try to find ways to help them see that actions beget consequences. Every choice will have a result. My job as a parent is to make choosing to act wisely much more pleasant than choosing another path.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t easy. I often have to adjust my expectations - I tend to expect them to know what I need, to be thinking on the same level as I am. And that they not mess up MY house.<br/>
<br/>
Which is of course the only home they&#39;ve ever known. It is their sanctuary, their playground, their workplace, their schoolroom, their studio, their stage, their laboratory. It is the axis upon which their world spins. Given that...<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s the part I&#39;m still working on.</div>

<br/>
Shannon&#39;s already said she herself was cringing about what she had  <br/>
written months ago, but still...<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;consequences&quot; has been bent and contorted by some families  <br/>
and &quot;belief systems&quot; (fundamentalist Christians who have crazily  <br/>
blamed Jesus for greater and lesser child abuse), but the fact of  <br/>
consequences can&#39;t be denied.    What should be avoided is parentally- <br/>
imposed consequences, or arbitrary consequences.    And those word- <br/>
benders have even taken and (mis)used &quot;natural consequences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t get to own English just because they&#39;ve abused it too.<br/>
<br/>
When one writes &quot;actions beget consequences,&quot; I&#39;m sure some readers  <br/>
shudder at the archaic verb and think &quot;Bible weirdo!&quot;   But if they  <br/>
read the same ideas expressed in other terms, they think they&#39;re  <br/>
hearing something revolutionarily new!   Ah, &#39;the Secret!&#39;  Ah,  <br/>
visualization, self-empowerment, out of the box, blah-de-blah-blah.<br/>
<br/>
For unschooling, let&#39;s don&#39;t think of it as &quot;a job&quot; (looking back up  <br/>
at the antiquated Shannon quote), but as relationships and  <br/>
assistance.   I see part of what I&#39;m doing on this list as helping  <br/>
other parents see that actions beget consequences.  Every choice will  <br/>
have a result.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to help make choosing to act wisely more pleasant than  <br/>
choosing another path.   The world will do that.  People&#39;s own  <br/>
children will do that.   If I behave badly with or to one of my  <br/>
children, their disappointment or frustration will be a natural  <br/>
consequence of my failure to behave better.<br/>

Choosing to act wisely, in English, means making a choice, first.  And  <br/>
making a choice means having options.   But more than the existence of  <br/>
options, it involves the ability to consider more than one path, and  <br/>
more than the ability, the actual act of considering and choosing.<br/>

People say &quot;I chose&quot; or &quot;I decided&quot; lots more than the actually do  <br/>

One, I needed to clean the house to be a good mother.  Thus I needed to be<br/>
alone, and then enforce this clean policy on the family that the house being<br/>
clean was sacrosanct.  I would then be too tired to be any fun or too<br/>
invested in the clean house to risk all that work.<br/>
<br/>
Idea number two is that I need to spend time with the kids that is<br/>
fun/compassionate.  While I was cleaning the kids were using &quot;mother<br/>
substitutes&quot;:  toys, tv, junk food...They were patiently waiting for me to<br/>
finish and be engaged with them.  Duh!  They were leaving wrappers on the<br/>
couch while I tackled the other room, then leaving mess in the kitchen while<br/>
I organized the toys.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to think about...declutter, decompress, and play in the dirt,<br/>
watch a film together or just play hide n sick.&#39;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A few years ago, I had a toothpaste epiphany.  In our main bathroom, the<br/>
girls and I had been keeping our toothbrushes and toothpaste.  At the<br/>
time I rarely used the master bath off the master bedroom because that<br/>
room was the office at the time.<br/>
<br/>
So, me and my compulsion to tidy things, I&#39;d go to brush my teeth, and<br/>
the darn toothpaste was always in the wrong location.   So, I&#39;d put it<br/>
back where it belonged, to find that, the next time I went to use it, it<br/>
was in the wrong location again.  Who is doing this?  That&#39;s what I was<br/>
thinking, I mean, how dare someone go and put the toothpaste in the<br/>
wrong location and for what reason would someone do this?  Gosh, it was<br/>
totally bugging me.<br/>
<br/>
So, one day, Chamille comes to me and says something like, &quot;mom, why do<br/>
you keep putting the toothpaste in the wrong location?&quot;  and I&#39;m<br/>
thinking to myself, ah ha, the toothpaste moving culprit, but it made me<br/>
suddenly realize that, Chamille lives here too, not that I didn&#39;t know<br/>
this already, but the awareness suddenly hit me, that she will have a<br/>
very different idea of how the house should be than I do, and she, being<br/>
an equal member in our shared living space really does have an idea of<br/>
how things should be in our shared living space!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s when a lot of things changed in regards to how I chose to keep<br/>
our living spaces.  I use the master bathroom now, since I am using that<br/>
as my bedroom too, but that bathroom is now the main bathroom, the ones<br/>
that guests use.  The main bathroom, the one that traditionally would be<br/>
used for guests, is Chamille&#39;s.  I call it Chamille&#39;s office, since<br/>
that&#39;s where she does her business of make-up and hair.  It&#39;s very very<br/>
messy, and I will put a picture of it on my blog today if I have time,<br/>
because I told someone that I would do so soon anyway.  She spreads her<br/>
stuff out on the counters and the floor.  There is hair dye on the<br/>
ceiling.  About once a week, I&#39;ll go in and tidy up a little and wipe<br/>
down counters and clean the toilet and shower for her, which she<br/>
appreciates enormously because she really can&#39;t be bothered with that<br/>
tedium in her creative space.  It stays all clean for about half a day<br/>
tops, then it goes back to looking like it did before, except for the<br/>
clean toilet and shower, that stays clean for a while.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of kids that come over to our house comment on her bathroom and<br/>
how messy it is, or how their parents would kill them if they did that<br/>
to any of the bathrooms in their house.  The way I see it, it is<br/>
Chamille&#39;s bathroom, in her house, and she has it set up the way she<br/>
wants it to be!  Since it is that way, she has creatively expanded her<br/>
make-up and experience, which, I think, is a GOOD thing.</div>

relationship gaps with things -- toys, books, video games, TV, other  <br/>
kids -- it would be less illuminating to make a blanket statement  <br/>
that those are all parent substitutes.<br/>
<br/>
All those are ways for children to explore their interests. A child  <br/>
playing WoW 6 hours a day isn&#39;t necessarily saying &quot;Mom, you&#39;re not  <br/>
paying enough attention to me!&quot; If the mom is engaged, very likely  <br/>
he&#39;s saying, &quot;This game is incredibly involving and fun!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a parent remains connected to the kids, checks in periodically,  <br/>
brings them food, plays with them, engages in conversation, runs  <br/>
interesting alternatives through their lives, takes them places, then  <br/>
the actions are likely to be exactly what they seem: engagement.<br/>
<br/>
Two kids watching TV for 6 hours a day could be doing it for joyful  <br/>
or withdrawing reasons. The actions aren&#39;t nearly as revealing as the  <br/>
reasons beneath them.<br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re lucky.   Some kids&#39; problem with the parents relating to  <br/>
them is the parents taking away their stuff.   When parents think  <br/>
being a good parent is forbidding TV, limiting conversation and  <br/>
reading, and making a child go to bed early, what stuff does that kid  <br/>
have?  With an older kid, if his attempts to communicate with the  <br/>
parents are punished by grounding and removal of allowance or phone,  <br/>
what stuff does he have?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Inexplicably&quot; can be explained, but I want to point out a couple of  <br/>
places where the writer dodged using &quot;I.&quot;<br/>
Toys require nothing.   Toys require no management, some need new  <br/>
batteries (and so might &quot;require&quot; money), but they don&#39;t know, those  <br/>
toys, whether they&#39;ve been stored or not.<br/>
<br/>
Toys don&#39;t separate a mother from her children.<br/>
<br/>
The second paragraph above about the house being messy might have been  <br/>
an &quot;I&quot; thought too, rather than &quot;the kids and I.&quot;  When the mom spends  <br/>
time with the kids, and is a part of their play and their doings, she  <br/>
KNOWS why the art supplies or toys are out.  She was a part of the  <br/>
play, or the creation, and she&#39;s cleaning up part of her own &quot;mess.&quot;   <br/>
When the mom has been separate physically or mentally (or both), she  <br/>
sees a strange, inexplicable &lt;g&gt; mess.  She didn&#39;t learn what the  <br/>
children had been doing.  She has no memories of WHY the paints are  <br/>
mixed the way they are and the papers are scattered out to dry as they  <br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As it was originally worded, it sounds partly as though if kids play  <br/>
alone they make a mess, but if kids play with their mom things are  <br/>
neater.   Changing those thoughts to the mother&#39;s role and awareness  <br/>
and presence will make it all look clearer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I don&#39;t know about that. We have plenty of &quot;stuff.&quot; We like  <br/>
&quot;stuff.&quot; We can afford &quot;stuff.&quot; And &quot;stuff&quot; also allows us to relate,  <br/>
go out and be together.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is really into Pokemon. She likes the cards, the DS games,  <br/>
the movies, the plushies, playing Battle Revolution on the Wii, making  <br/>
clay versions of them. I try to find the latest Pokemon thing for her,  <br/>
because I know it feeds her imagination. She was very taken with the  <br/>
recent Eevee evolution, so I found a vendor in Japan that sold the  <br/>
plushies. She carries them everywhere, makes up stories about them,  <br/>
creates models of them. When she plays the characters on her DS, she  <br/>
and I come up with names and team names together. She tells me all  <br/>
about her leveling up in the game and whether certain characters work  <br/>
well as a team. She talks to me about the story at the end of one of  <br/>
the games and how she cries each time she plays to the end. We head to  <br/>
Toys R Us when a new Pokemon can be wirelessly uploaded to her DS,  <br/>
make a plan to get there as soon as the store opens and get some  <br/>
breakfast while we&#39;re at it. She dressed as a Skitty (we worked on the  <br/>
costume together) at her own funshop at a conference. She connected  <br/>
with others who love Pokemon, too. She has *lots* of cards, lots of  <br/>
games, lots of &quot;stuff.&quot; And when she&#39;s done with it, someone else will  <br/>
benefit from her collection. I don&#39;t see how those toys are separating  <br/>
us, at all.<br/>
<br/>
I have not found that stuff has hindered our relationship, except when  <br/>
I was in &quot;let&#39;s clean up this stuff&quot; or &quot;you have too much of this  <br/>
stuff&quot; mode when Michelle was littler. She didn&#39;t want to clean it up.  <br/>
She likes things everywhere. She likes lots of things. I didnt. I got  <br/>
mad, because I wanted all the &quot;stuff&quot; tidied up. This was at the  <br/>
beginning of unschooling for us, when I was letting go of how things  <br/>
ought to look and be and started to concentrate on our relationship  <br/>
instead. Toys and relationship, I found, are not mutually exclusive.<br/>

you&#39;re already in a place where enjoying toys *with* your kids won&#39;t  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544947480">thanks for these thoughtful posts everyone. I realized after the pain my children had gone through all the years I worked 40-60 hours weekly - and they spent away from me in public school, after I had always nursed and always had them in our bed and I had NOT listened to what my instincts were - I am STILL atoning as I see them heal little by little.  <br/>
<br/>
It is an ever evolving process of atonement and change that has carried me through these first 3 years of getting back to the roots of un schooling and loving my children in a way that I feel is the right way - and not listening to what others are saying is &quot;the right way&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I tell them every day how much I love being with them and why I love being with them.  Not only as an apology, but the truth as I feel it.  And yes I also apologize for being human and not paying attention  or rather &quot;not recognizing&quot; the importance of learning how to listen to my instincts and follow what I knew to be the &quot;right way&quot; and listening and meeting their needs.  This also helps them to see that we adults do make mistakes, and also why they should follow, trust and rely on their own instincts.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a key chain in one of our favorite &quot;hippie&quot; shops that read &quot;what about no don&#39;t you understand?&quot;  I laughed then put it back realizing how much I still have to change - when those words are still in my &quot;ready to wear&quot; vocabulary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879382781">If I implied that children shouldn&#39;t have toys then I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
If I sounded judgemental about stuff being a substitute for parental<br/>
love then I have to admit I was.   It starts with *the lovey* a baby<br/>
receives:  a cute bear to be a substitute for mom in the next room, ignoring<br/>
the crying.  It starts with pacifiers which go in the mouth instead of the<br/>
breast to control eating or limit contact or to give mom &#39;time&quot;.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
use loveys or pacifiers and wonder if that is why my kids are attached to<br/>
people rather than things.<br/>
<br/>
My family and I all  have &quot;special games&quot; and toys, but have always shared<br/>
them willingly.  I never thought about this much until I started reading the<br/>
posts but my kids share with one another, with friends and with strange<br/>
children, too.  My kids will wear my lipstick or eyeshadow for play.  I<br/>
don&#39;t have a problem.  I have non-toxic make-up and I don&#39;t use it often.<br/>
When we go out I admit I try to look like a &quot;regular&quot; mom.  This is a bit of<br/>
a safety issue, as I don&#39;t want&#39; anyone finding us weird and reporting us to<br/>
authorities.<br/>
<br/>
I used to take the theft of a dslite or gameboy as an affront.  But my kids<br/>
taught me to let go of this idea.  Two of my kids had expensive toys go<br/>
awol.  I confronted other parents, but learned that if some people are so<br/>
attached to things that they will steal them from others its pretty scary to<br/>
invest emotionally in &quot;stuff&quot;.  I learned from my kids not to do this when<br/>
they philosophically dealt with &quot;missing&quot; toys by saving their money and<br/>
re-purchasing them and then being choosier about whom they shared with.  I<br/>
still have ideas about justice and friendship to work through&lt;grin&gt;.  I did<br/>
want to do something about the the thefts but my kids were willing to let go<br/>
and they talked about what they had learned and they didn&#39;t want to get<br/>
anyone in &quot;trouble&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if toys are used to help relate that is great, but if toys are<br/>
used as a distraction from relating then that doesn&#39;t work.  My kids are<br/>
able and have watched marathon tv.  They don&#39;t do this now because it<br/>
doesn&#39;t interest them.  If they watched for six hours I would be sitting<br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
I was merely sharing things that work for me...spending time with the kids<br/>
minimizes mess.  Mess, housework and organization were the original posts.<br/>
<br/>
Its also helpful to create that infrastructure for toys:  shelves and boxes<br/>
designed by the kids keep things safe.  Toys do require cleaning, repairing<br/>
and recharging.  Children choke on loose pieces of toys.I once suffered pain<br/>
for weeks after a sprained groin.    Marbles on the kitchen floor unattended<br/>
while walking with a nursling in a sling don&#39;t mix :)  I wasn&#39;t thinking of<br/>
asthetics or my attachment to &quot;cleaning&quot;--just the safety of everyone.<br/>

I think my point was missed on that.   Toys don&#39;t &quot;require&quot; those  <br/>
things.   Those needs are of the owners of the toys, not the toys  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right as far as that is concerned. But as far as  <br/>
generalizations, your thoughts have swung too far. Sometimes people  <br/>
need to do that! Like the &quot;Always say yes!&quot; suggestion. They need to  <br/>
temporarily go to the other extreme so when they swing back it&#39;s for  <br/>
the right reasons and done with thought and not just knee jerk  <br/>
reactions.<br/>
<br/>
But I think as a general view of the relationship between kids and  <br/>
toys, your view point won&#39;t help others be more at peace with their  <br/>
kids. Maybe your kids just like people! :-) Some people don&#39;t get  <br/>
attached to things. Making a generalization from your own family  <br/>
doesn&#39;t explain families that are very different.<br/>
<br/>
For kids who aren&#39;t so people oriented -- and my daughter wasn&#39;t -- I  <br/>
would have understood her less if I saw her love of Pokemon and  <br/>
Beanies as a sign she needed more of my attention. What she really  <br/>
wanted was a robot who would do exactly what she wanted, just like  <br/>
Pokemon did for their trainers ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Theories can help us see a situation differently but ultimately it&#39;s  <br/>
our kids who tell us the truth through their actions. Being tuned  <br/>
into our kids will help us understand their unique selves better than  <br/>
other people&#39;s advice or grand sweeping generalized theories of what  <br/>
kids are like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is where I find a word from religion useful--like you thinking  <br/>
about &quot;atonement&quot; recently, Sandra. It&#39;s &quot;discernment.&quot; Traditionally  <br/>
meant in the sense of &quot;discerning the will of God,&quot; for me it&#39;s useful  <br/>
as a concept whenever I&#39;m thinking about a question like this one:  <br/>
when does &quot;trust your experience of your child over a general theory&quot;  <br/>
become &quot;I know my own kid best which is why I restrict TV&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
In a religious context, you might ask, &quot;Well, I&#39;m trying to figure out  <br/>
if it&#39;s God&#39;s will for me to leave my family and become a missionary  <br/>
in Latvia.&quot; One aspect of discernment can be testing this leading  <br/>
against other things you know about God&#39;s will--what do your religious  <br/>
texts say about doing good works versus honoring commitments? What  <br/>
does your own past experience say? What do people you trust say? (In  <br/>
my religion, Quakerism, you can ask for what we call a &quot;clearness  <br/>
committee&quot;--four or five people to sit down with you and lend their  <br/>
wisdom to your process.)<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling, you can test something like this against your other  <br/>
principles. What keeps, &quot;it is best to respond to the individual  <br/>
child&#39;s needs&quot; from devolving into &quot;each mother knows best for her own  <br/>
kids and so we have no basis to say one choice is generally better  <br/>
than another or to encourage her to choose differently&quot; is that we  <br/>
have principles we can test against.<br/>
<br/>
Which choice invests a parent&#39;s trust in the child?<br/>
<br/>
Which choice increases the child&#39;s autonomy?<br/>
<br/>
Which choice reduces conflict and improves relationships within the  <br/>
family?<br/>
<br/>
Which choice respects the child&#39;s personal and bodily integrity?<br/>
<br/>
Which choice honors the needs of all members of the family rather than  <br/>
automatically elevating one person&#39;s needs over another&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
The thing about discernment is that it acknowledges that these  <br/>
questions can be complex and that there is not one answer for  <br/>
everybody, while at the same time pointing to underlying principles  <br/>
that can be used to guide and test our decisions. It acknowledges that  <br/>
the specifics can look very different in two families acting by the  <br/>
same principles. It demands that individuals be honest about their  <br/>
motivations. It asks for mindfulness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173750785">One scenario of mothers know best.<br/>
I have a friend from La Leche League that also homeschools. She is a very gentle and connected mother in many ways.<br/>
She is also a very intelligent person BUT she parents in many ways with FEAR. She does not see it as so.<br/>
<br/>
Her kids are severely limited on what they can eat. She has even put her oldest on a diet when he was 5-6. He is a husky boy.<br/>
The parents are overweight ( heck I am too). They are very afraid their kids are going to become obese. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday they came over and my son wanted to show some video games to her son. They have known each other since they were babies. Her son told my son  he could not because his mom won&#39;t let him. So my son went to ask her why.<br/>
He just could not understand. I later explained to him how some parents raise their kids diferent than in our home.<br/>
She does not even know anything about video games. She is afraid it will make them violent or make them fat from sitting all day.<br/>
<br/>
The kids used to be able to watch TV for 30 minutes a day but now they don&#39;t have TV only movies and those are extremely<br/>
restricted. Even Madagascar was deemed too violent when they saw it.<br/>
Again it is because she fears TV will corrupt their brains and turn them to mush. TV is a waiste of time they should be reading a book.She cannot see how much they could be learing from it.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I offer some cut up watermelon I had for the kids while we played in the yard. The oldest asked me what else I had for them to eat. He knows we have yummy stuff that he can only eat when here. Very sad.<br/>
<br/>
They also don&#39;t play in the computer. Not allowed yet to do that. Children should be playing outside or doing crafts.<br/>
<br/>
The point I was going to make is that she knows her son better. If she would let him eat whatever he wanted and how much he wanted he would not stop eating and only eat &quot;junk&quot; and lots. But what she can&#39;t see is that she created that.<br/>
So does mommy really knows best in that case?<br/>
She does and she doesn&#39;t.<br/>

--------------------------------------<br/>
or a fsmily with one of each...my daughter couldn&#39;t have cared less about toys, never did &#39;parallel play&#39; and uswd to confuse the heck out of other toddlers by expecting interaction.  She also didn&#39;t care if anorhwe kid rook the toy she was playing with as long aa they&#39;d interact with her.<br/>
<br/>
My son was all about the toys. And things.  <br/>
<br/>
and if anything, he being the youngest, got more &#39;attachment parenting&#39; style thank she did. He eas nursed longer, slept with me longer, and experienced not attempts at distancing with a pacifier, a &#39;lovey&#39;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience and obervation, its way more about temperament and personality than family culture, <br/>
<br/>
and I laughed out loud about the robot desire because my son srill wants that, or even better, clones of me so one can sleep, one can do whatever I want, and one whatever he wants.   So, he is almost 11 and its only recently more about people and less about toys.<br/>

&gt; She does and she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really like this story about a mom creating the problem she then has  <br/>
to &quot;control,&quot; Alix. I have a friend who is pretty judgmental about how  <br/>
many and which video games my kids play. She wishes that when her son  <br/>
visits us (he stays overnight often) that he and Eric wouldn&#39;t just  <br/>
play video games the whole time. She said it to me again the other  <br/>
day, in a kind of &quot;you need to make this happen&quot; way, and I said,  <br/>
&quot;He&#39;s the one driving that, you know.&quot; I told her that often when Noah  <br/>
is here for a whole day, it reaches a point where Eric is saying, &quot;I&#39;m  <br/>
bored with video games...let&#39;s do something else,&quot; and Noah replies,  <br/>
&quot;Well, we can play a different video game!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other day he came over and both my boys were outside running  <br/>
around with swords. Noah got out of the car, walked over to them, and  <br/>
said, &quot;Let&#39;s go inside and play video games.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My friend thinks _I_ let my (and her) kids play &quot;too many video  <br/>
games.&quot; I think she doesn&#39;t let her son play enough, or he wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
so fixated when he comes here, where they&#39;re not restricted. I told  <br/>
her that we love having him visit (it&#39;s true, he&#39;s a nice kid) and  <br/>
that if she wants him to do something other than play video games when  <br/>
he comes, she should bring him to visit more often so he has a chance  <br/>
of getting his fill.<br/>
<br/>
She also has been very adamant that he is NOT to be allowed to play  <br/>
Halo with my kids. So he comes here and talks about Halo a lot. The  <br/>
other day he stood in front of a rack with literally 50+ video games  <br/>
in it, saying, &quot;I wish I could play Halo...I&#39;m pretty sure Halo would  <br/>
be the most fun...but my mom won&#39;t let me.&quot; It&#39;s like the textbook  <br/>
example of what happens with restrictions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936404398">Exactly Su. I just wish this kid could play any video game. He cannot play any. Even here.<br/>
She used to let him play the Nintendo DS when he visited but that is all he wanted to do and talk about later so now<br/>
she has told him he cannot.<br/>
She now has proof that video games are addicted and bad.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right!  We know someone like this too.  Her daughter ran away from home.<br/>
She insists she knows her daughter best.  She bases this on the fact<br/>
that they talk about things.  It&#39;s just the 2 of them, so I&#39;m sure that<br/>
they talk about things.  However, what I see, is that the daughter<br/>
really can&#39;t talk about her true feelings, she has to gaurd herself and<br/>
phrase things in such a way that her mom will accept and agree with. <br/>
I&#39;ve been there done that with my own mother.<br/>
<br/>
By all accounts we had a decent relationship.  We talked and did things<br/>
together, BUT, it&#39;s nothing like the relationship that I&#39;ve built with<br/>
my own daughter.  There are still things that I can&#39;t talk to my mother<br/>
about.  Chamille has never felt like she couldn&#39;t relay her real<br/>
feelings to me about things, or that she must phrase things in ways that<br/>
I will accept.  She knows that I will accept her thoughts as is and<br/>
discuss things openly and honestly.  It&#39;s about honest candor, I think.<br/>
<br/>
So many parents don&#39;t want to hear the honest candor of their kids<br/>
because it doesn&#39;t mesh with their own views, and by hearing it, they<br/>
feel they must do something with that information.  The reaction of most<br/>
traditionally minded parents is to control those thoughts of their kids,<br/>
to force those thoughts to conform to their own ideals of what they<br/>
believe their kids should be thinking and feeling.  This is largely why<br/>
parents suddenly end up with teens that they perceive as being<br/>
rebellious.  At some point, in order for a teen with ideas that don&#39;t<br/>
mesh with their parents, to get what they want, they will have to make<br/>
their parents lose.  It becomes a battle of whose will is stronger, who<br/>
will win that battle.  Some kids give up trying until they leave the<br/>
home and never return, or wait years to talk to their parents honestly,<br/>
if ever.  Some kids have stronger wills and get what they want by<br/>
defying their parents, and live in continuous battles with their parents<br/>
over it.  Either way it creates pain, pain that could have been avoided.</div>

Keith never was honest with his mom.  We were at her memorial service  <br/>
yesterday, and his brother did the eulogy.  People at her church just  <br/>
loved her.  She was the treasurer and she sang in the choir.  His  <br/>
brother Gerry was ten years older than Keith.  He reported in glowing  <br/>
terms of a woman unfamiliar to Keith in some ways, and more unfamiliar  <br/>
to me.   Den leader?  Not for Keith.   Taught the boys to sew?  Not  <br/>
Keith; he learned in the theatre tech classes she had told him were  <br/>
stupid to take.<br/>
<br/>
Keith told me the morning we were leaving that his brother treats him  <br/>
like a stranger in some ways, or worse--as someone who&#39;s not  <br/>
trustworthy or reliable.  Not even the benefit of the doubt.  He was  <br/>
worried we wouldn&#39;t be there on time.  Keith is always on time, or  <br/>
early.<br/>
<br/>
Keith is fifty-two and his family never got to know him.   Because of  <br/>
me, he presented the appearance of being an attentive son (cards and  <br/>
phone calls and occasional gifts).<br/>
<br/>
My kids are honest.  They&#39;re not afraid to say I&#39;m crowding them or  <br/>
bugging them if I am, because it&#39;s rare and they know I won&#39;t yell  <br/>
about it, but I&#39;ll give them space, and wait for them to come closer,  <br/>
which never takes long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-755332266">I have been making grand sweeping generalizations and theorizing a lot :)<br/>
That is the fun thing about this list.  There aren&#39;t too many places I can<br/>
take my specific experiences and take them to far out conclusions and get<br/>
interesting feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, it is true the toys don&#39;t need anything.  But to be safe for human<br/>
&quot;consumption&quot; I need certain conditions to be met for the toys and to enjoy<br/>
the toys the kids need certain conditions to be met.<br/>
<br/>
My kids also like pokemon.  I know way too much for an adult about<br/>
&quot;evolving&quot; and fighting and eggs and Ash and &quot;training&quot;.  I don&#39;t mean my<br/>
kids are totally people oriented.  We have Yu gi oh, pokemon cards, and a<br/>
recent acquisition I haven&#39;t learned anything about yet :)<br/>

The thing about discernment is that it acknowledges that these<br/>

everybody, while at the same time pointing to underlying principles<br/>
that can be used to guide and test our decisions. It acknowledges that<br/>
the specifics can look very different in two families acting by the<br/>
same principles. It demands that individuals be honest about their<br/>
motivations. It asks for mindfulness.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought that a lot of cleaning can be simplified, when read the first<br/>
post on this thread, and reading that list gave me some ideas.  For instance<br/>
I am seriously thinking of serving most our meals off disposable plates or<br/>
with napkins.  I hate chasing dishes all over the house.  I want the kids to<br/>
enjoy food and to be well nourished and have autonomy.   People will blanch<br/>
I am sure, but we try to have a low carbon footprint, and for my family just<br/>
being able to put paper plates in a green bin to be composted will work so<br/>
much better than having dirty plates everywhere.  When I read Su&#39;s list I<br/>
realized that paper plates would meet my kids autonomy, have peace in our<br/>
family and simplify chores, somewhat!<br/>

My nine year old son learned to make meringues this weekend.  He had been<br/>
wanting to do this for a long time, too.  At least a month or so.  I was<br/>
doubtful as I had never done it before, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to *offer* my<br/>
experience. I caught myself trying to talk him into baking another treat,<br/>
like peanut butter cookies or a fruit pie.<br/>
<br/>
Undaunted, Martin hunted an easy recipe on the Net.  He wrote down the<br/>
ingredients:  sugar, cream of tarter, egg whites and vanilla.  He took his<br/>
dad shopping for them.  He asked me if I could help him.  So I was in the<br/>
kitchen on standby, ignoring my doubts.  Before I knew it he was beating a<br/>
white mixture in a bowl and was dropping it from a spoon on to a cookie<br/>
sheet, and baking them.<br/>
<br/>
I expected it to be hard, and worried he would be disappointed that I<br/>
thought about dissuading him.  I was so surprised he succeeded.  Yes, I know<br/>
how that reads, but I am being honest!  I have learned to overcome the urge<br/>
to stop my kids from doing their own thing but am always so surprised it<br/>
works.  My parents were constantly talking me out of projects, or throwing<br/>
obstacles at me, and then pointing out how I should have listened when<br/>
whatever I was attempting failed.  I still have a fear of failure that I am<br/>
trying to overcome.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed he cleaned up as he went, rinsing things.  The next day all his<br/>
&quot;tools&quot; were ready for another batch.  Again, I worry about telling this<br/>
story on other lists because I am going to hear that my family is eating too<br/>
much sugar daily and I am celebrating this as Martin&#39;s baking project.  I<br/>
was able to just tell him how pretty they looked, and how I appreciate him<br/>
for making them.  No condescension about how he did it all by himself or<br/>
whatever.  He was really proud and happy.  I was really happy for him, and<br/>
excited we were able to work together.<br/>
<br/>
Usually when we bake cookies, pie or cake I end up cleaning up. This is fine<br/>
with me, but it was interesting to watch him clean.  I didn&#39;t comment on it,<br/>
as I didn&#39;t want to turn into The Fun-Killer/ Joy stopper.  My SIL coined<br/>
these terms to describe adults who see a child enjoying an activity who<br/>
swoop in and turn it into a quiz. or lavish praise on it which takes the fun<br/>
out of it with the hopes that they are &quot;positively reinforcing&quot; the event.<br/>
IE a kid calculating sales tax, or figuring out how to spend his allowance<br/>
and suddenly an adult turns it into a math quiz.  How many widgets could you<br/>
buy if you had $200 or some similar question!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374526335">Her kids are severely limited on what they can eat. She has even put her<br/>
oldest on a diet when he was 5-6. He is a husky boy.<br/>
The parents are overweight ( heck I am too). They are very afraid their kids<br/>
are going to become obese<br/>
My niece is very skinny, not unhealthy, just thin.  When she was younger a<br/>
pediatrician had my SIL in there with a food journal monthly.  The doc<br/>
actually yelled at my SIL because the little girl was eating too many<br/>
veggies.  Yup.  The mom kept offering high-fat dips, but apart from celery<br/>
with peanut butter or cream cheese my niece mowed down on fruits and<br/>
veggies.<br/>
<br/>
My SIL had a funny birthday party kid story.  This gave her some perspective<br/>
and might shed some light on her unschooling.  Her daughter didn&#39;t have her<br/>
food regulated.  In fact her parents were encouraged by doctors to give<br/>
their child *all you can eat ice cream*!  So, she had lots of choices.  At a<br/>
birthday party all the parents were ordering their offspring to just have<br/>
one cookie, and then eat some fruit or some veggies.  My sil found the other<br/>
parents staring when she said:  Leah you are eating all the fruit, and too<br/>
many carrot sticks, so there won&#39;t be any for the other kids.  Please eat a<br/>
piece of cake now.  The other kids not used to all that candy, cake and<br/>
cookies had to be ordered to enjoy the fruit.  My neice who was always<br/>
encouraged to eat high fat food was in Heaven with all you can eat fruits<br/>
and veggies.  After that my SIL changed doctors and made it clear Leah chose<br/>
her own foods.  She is a strong healthy kid, just small.<br/>
