<div id="ygrps-yiv-206778054">We moved to Virginia about 6 weeks ago. We live in a townhouse <br/>
surrounded by nosey neighbors who called the police to complain about <br/>
our children &#39;playing outside too much without their parents <br/>
supervision&#39; (my children are 14, 13, 11, 9, 8) and stated that the <br/>
children do not go to school. These neighbors have never said one <br/>
word to us. <br/>
<br/>
The policeman told us that we needed to file a request for exemption <br/>
from compulsary attendance. I called the Superintendants office who <br/>
told me to write a letter with all the kids names, what our religion <br/>
teaches and ask to be excused from the compulsary attendance law. The <br/>
board will review the letter and let us know if they will grant the <br/>
request. It is my understanding that they don&#39;t have the right to <br/>
deny it. Is there anyone here from Virginia that has gone through <br/>
this process? If so please let me know what you did.<br/>

<br/>
That doesn&#39;t sound like a letter of intent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you had inquired about homeschooling before moving, and maybe <br/>
had already registered, or had information about how to register.  I think an <br/>
exemption from compulsory attendance is for freakish exceptions, not for <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Are you on a local homeschooling discussion list?  (Does anyone here have an <br/>
address for a Virginia-specific list?)<br/>

Not exactly, but here is the link for the notice of intent. You can <br/>
print it from the link.<br/>

I don&#39;t think they can make you explain your religious beliefs, but <br/>
VA may be one of those states that if you say you do it for <br/>
religious reasons, you have less hassle.<br/>
There are quite a few yahoo groups for VA homeschoolers.<br/>
Here are the top three...but there were 46 listed. LOL<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/homeschool-va-chat/<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Homeschool_Hotline/<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arc-homeschool/<br/>
<br/>
The people on those lists, should be able to help you find out <br/>
exactly what the law is, and what hoops you have to jump thru.<br/>

different requirements for homeschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please go to www.vhea.org and read what is there about filing for an <br/>
RE.  VHEA is an inclusive statewide homeschooling organization.<br/>
<br/>
Filing an RE is different from complying with the home education <br/>
statute in VA.  If you have an RE you do not have to comply with the <br/>
HE statute. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, they have the right to deny an RE if they do not feel your <br/>
religious beliefs are genuine.<br/>
<br/>
However, if that happens, you can still file under the homeschooling <br/>
statute.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is a national unschooling list, and not a VA specific <br/>
one, you might also consider joining the VAEclecticHomeschool list <br/>
at yahoo groups, which is an inclusive, state-wide e-mail support <br/>
list with over 800 members.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the yahoo groups link:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/VaEclecticHomeschool/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/VaEclecticHomeschool/</a><br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to contact me off-list as well with any questions <br/>
regarding homeschooling or the RE in Virginia<br/>
