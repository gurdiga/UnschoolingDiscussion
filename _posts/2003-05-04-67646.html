 Ok, have I gone on long enough about this yet? :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having had several family members spend time there, you just confirmed my own <br/>
theories.<br/>
That people are always more frightened by that which they are not used to.<br/>
Florida is the last place on earth most of MY family would live, they think <br/>
it&#39;s  nuts.<br/>
<br/>
When you understand the wildlife of an area, and also understand that most <br/>
animals are trying hard to avoid humans, it suddenly doesn&#39;t seem so <br/>
intimidating.<br/>
Now humans are something that I think it makes sense to be a bit cautious <br/>
about!!! THAT makes perfect sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-688485101">I have to add that one of the world&#39;s most venomous spiders is the<br/>
Sydney Funnelweb. This is an aggressive especially when cornered spider<br/>
(compared to the redback) that gets pretty large and black. It is kind<br/>
of a spiky looking spider - not like the slithering string legs of the<br/>
huntsman. It makes a funnel shaped web in cracks in rocky areas - or now<br/>
cracks in cement areas - under steps, in brickwork, the footings of<br/>
houses etc. This is a spider that loves the urban environment. What did<br/>
I learn growing up in Sydney? Don&#39;t go barefoot outside in the concrete<br/>
backyards of out terraced houses. It rears up on its back legs in order<br/>
to deliver a bite with force, and can go through socks or thin leather.<br/>
(Stories of it biting through gumboots are urban myths - I think) There<br/>
is an anti-venom now, but needs to be delivered speedily. Funnelwebs, I<br/>
guess a related species, are also found in the temperate coastal rural<br/>
areas, and build webs in holes in the ground. My mother&#39;s friend who had<br/>
a place at Lake Conjola on the south coast of NSW, used to protect his<br/>
dogs by pouring kerosene into the little web holes and igniting it to<br/>
kill the spiders in the back yard. I always used to watch those &quot;nature<br/>
fights back&quot; movies like &quot;Food of the Gods&quot; with a nervous eye,<br/>
remembering those spiders screaming.<br/>

<br/>
Hehe!! I might too.<br/>
I have observed that snakes and Alligators tend to come out in the  open more <br/>
after a big storm or hurricane.<br/>
In our last neighborhood (the one where snakes were seen regularly), an <br/>
Alligator walked right up our street, while my dh watched in amazement, and <br/>
entered a neighbors garage. Dr. Gomez had to call the police to come help, as <br/>
the durn thing didn&#39;t want to leave!!<br/>
I can&#39;t remember if there&#39;d been a storm right before that, but many people <br/>
get snakes and such in their yards after TS&#39;s or &#39;Canes.<br/>

Ummmm... actually hurricane season is June through Nov. 1st. But most of the <br/>
action happens in September.<br/>
I don&#39;t think Columbia is a very high risk place though. It&#39;s far enough <br/>
inland that it&#39;d have to be a pretty bad &#39;cane to affect the conference.<br/>

Oooh, That is really creepy.<br/>
That funnel web spider is the one that creeped me out when thinking of <br/>
Australia, not the snakes!<br/>
I read an article about how they finally came up with an anti-venin, but <br/>
doesn&#39;t the durn thing kill you in under four minutes? You&#39;d have to carry a <br/>
kit with you!<br/>
