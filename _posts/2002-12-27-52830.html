<div id="ygrps-yiv-743239590">Hey there,<br/>
    I&#39;m new to this group so forgive me if this is a question that <br/>
has been covered previously. I was wondering if there are any other <br/>
parents unschooling their children in the NYC or NY Brooklyn area. I <br/>
am wanting to either join an existing homeschooling group or start <br/>
one for the purpose of getting kids together once a week or bi-weekly <br/>
to have outings, educational field trips, do science and history <br/>
projects, creative writing workshops and more. I have a ton of ideas <br/>
but, I do not know anyone in this area who is interested. If anybody <br/>
out there is interested let me know, I am eager and feeling energetic <br/>
about this. I hope everyone out there is enjoying their holidays! :) <br/>
Be well and love and light to you all. Namaste, Jennifer</div>

 <br/>
I&#39;m fairly new to the group as well. Currently my 5 year old daughter and I are unschooling. We&#39;re in Queens but we have metrocards and love to travel to meet people and do things.<br/>
