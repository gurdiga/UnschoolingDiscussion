<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727648583">My son,Gus has never gone to school.  We have also homeschooled.  He also has been involved with the video game for about 3 years now.   At first I resisted this and hated it, thinking that this could not be good.  My hubby has two other children that are older and so Gus was influenced by this.  It&#39;s also a time for bonding for Jerry and Gus.  What helped me to feel better about it is; Gus learned so much more doing and learning how to do the game.  Jerry and Gus looked up the history of the game, characters, and learned about special skills the characters needed.  It has a great learning experience for me too.  Unschooling does not have to look like I think it should all the time.<br/>
We also have a time factor too.  Gus would play it all day if we let him.  He is allowed to play every other day and weekends.  This works great for time to connect for dad and son.  I hope this helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853028478">Yes,   <br/>
 <br/>
Alec,  9ds, has had unlimited PS2 play now for about 3 months,  last week he says to me,   &quot;you know Mom I havn&#39;t played the PS2 for a week?&quot;  He has instead been doing research work on the computer.      <br/>
 <br/>
I used to limit   and he continued to be obsessed.  No obsession anymore!! <br/>
 <br/>
He seems to be so much more emotionally stable,   healthier in a certain way?  I think this is coming from his life being controlled by him and not by others.   Does this make any sense?   He is so much more at ease with himself.    I love this trait in children.      I don&#39;t see it very much in adults though,  maybe when I run into an adult that is doing what they love.   Which isn&#39;t very often.   I do sense this quality/trait in people I&#39;ve met through this list tho&#39;.  I think that&#39;s another reason why I like this list.<br/>
Very cool.<br/>

<br/>
Maturity.<br/>
You treated him like a man instead of like a little boy, and that&#39;s what will <br/>
make him a man.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Does this make any sense?   He is so much more at ease with himself.    I <br/>
love this trait in children.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not needy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t see it very much in adults though,  maybe when I run into an <br/>
adult that is doing what they love.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too many adults have never felt &quot;graduated&quot; to adulthood.  They&#39;re needy of <br/>
acknowledgement, confirmation, something to make them &quot;feel&quot; grown because in <br/>
some emotional ways they were told too often that they were children and <br/>
their opinions weren&#39;t real and their needs weren&#39;t real.<br/>
<br/>
But when an adult is involved in something they love, that can be &quot;flow,&quot; and <br/>
flow is rare with people who are carrying on a constant internal conversation <br/>
about whether their interests are okay to have, or those who have shut down <br/>
their internal conversations.<br/>
