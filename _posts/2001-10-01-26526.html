&gt; My<br/>
&gt; regret is that my older son got caught up with a Dungeons and Dragons<br/>
&gt; crowd.  I met most of them and knew there were some older people<br/>
&gt; involved.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my teens I was involved in science fiction fandom -- a close relative to<br/>
the D&D crowd, with a lot of crossover. My parents (who did a lot wrong but<br/>
did this right) would drive me to conventions, or put me on a plane to them,<br/>
and wave bye.<br/>
<br/>
Almost everyone was older than me. I was a very cute young thing, and I got<br/>
hit on. I learned to say &quot;no thanks&quot; to the men and women asking, and they<br/>
took no for an answer.<br/>
<br/>
After science fiction, I was next involved in dog shows. Almost the exact<br/>
scenario, almost everyone older than me, and I was still pretty cute.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the activity, it&#39;s the people. Some teachers seduce their teenage<br/>
students in high school. Some baseball coaches molest the boys on their<br/>
teams. Some ministers rape girls in their congregations. Any of these would<br/>
probably be considered by most people to be &quot;the right crowd&quot; from the<br/>
outside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942641223">When I was younger and my parents could no longer &quot;control&quot; me they cut<br/>
me loose.  I could have easily been headed the wrong direction and it was<br/>
clear to everyone I was no longer interested in my parents ideas.  <br/>
In order to be emancipated at that time you had to prove employment, and<br/>
live on your own.  Maybe it&#39;s different now.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if your friend would actually consider this, ( I don&#39;t think<br/>
I&#39;d have the stomach for it )  but it might be something she could talk<br/>
over with her son.  It sounds though that communication is a problem, so<br/>
this idea might just sound like a rejection to her son.  It&#39;s hard to<br/>
say. <br/>
She could find out the legalities of it and let her son know she&#39;d help<br/>
him become a &quot;real&quot; adult if this is what he wants.  Let him know what it<br/>
involves ( full time job, whatever )  and see if he&#39;s ready for it. <br/>
This sounds like parent/child control issues and emancipation, maybe even<br/>
that she&#39;d be willing to support it, gives control to the minor.  It also<br/>
makes him legally responsible for himself and his actions.  <br/>
This is a tough issue and my only personal knowledge of it is from my<br/>
youth.  <br/>
Becoming a legal adult probably saved me.  It certainly was an eye<br/>
opening experience for me and although pretty terrifying in the<br/>
beginning, exactly the right choice.(for my particular circumstances) <br/>
Deb L, who&#39;s very disappointed to hear that IQ tests mean nothing and<br/>
will now have to find something else to hold over my husband during<br/>
arguments.  Who said &quot;cite your sources&quot; ? maybe I&#39;ll try that.</div>
