<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634348886">&lt;&lt;I am SO glad that I will never have to worry about her being treated so <br/>
less <br/>
than by people who feel their importance in her life is much greater than it <br/>
should be in some supposedly mandatory place, claiming to be GOOD for the <br/>
children!<br/>

<br/>
My Mom&#39;s take on it -- she volunteers in ps once a week -- is that ours is a <br/>
gentler way to live -- and that is a good thing. <br/>
<br/>
Just visited Mom and I was so pleased that she &quot;got it&quot; -- as she does every <br/>
time she sees her happy grandchildren, but it was the first time I&#39;d thought <br/>
of our life as &quot;gentle&quot; and I liked it!<br/>
