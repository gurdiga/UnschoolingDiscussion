<div id="ygrps-yiv-277602879">I&#39;m finalizing website pages---well *starting* to *begin* website pages <br/>
for funshop presenters. &quot;Finalize&quot; is a long way away, I guess! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending this out to the all the different groups as well as <br/>
individuals to make sure I don&#39;t miss anyone.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve offered to host a funshop, please e-mail me as soon as <br/>
possible with your photos, your 4-5 line bio, your funshop title, and <br/>
its description.  If you can&#39;t get a photo to me that soon, fine. But <br/>
please send everything else!<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate your promptness. Contracts will go out as soon as I <br/>
have your info.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
