I&#39;ve forwarded your email to the HEQT list.<br/>
It appears to be very relevant to a recent debate we were having.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Single parents who are legally seperated from their partners (or have no<br/>
partners)  and who are responsible for the day-to-day upbringing of children<br/>
should have the same rights as both parents in making decisions over their<br/>
children&#39;s upbringing.&#39;<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-Discussion] a request<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NHEN&#39;s New Homeschooler Encouragement Newsletter (N-H-E-N) is looking<br/>
for homeschoolers who are willing to share some advice on the recurring<br/>
question:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you do when you have a relatives (or maybe even a spouse) who<br/>
aren&#39;t happy about the decision to homeschool?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With each issue, N-H-E-N helps new homeschoolers connect with parents<br/>
from all over the country who have experienced some of the<br/>
same obstacles. This is an easy way to reach out and help someone who&#39;s<br/>
having a rough time. Simply send your responses to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:N-H-E-N@...">N-H-E-N@...</a> as<br/>
soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
And, if you know of homeschool websites with articles that address this<br/>
issue, please send us that link too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
