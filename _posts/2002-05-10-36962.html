&lt;&lt; I guess, I don&#39;t hold much respect for the ps or teachers who claim that <br/>
it is better. Any of them who claim it is, have either not been in the system <br/>
long enough to know better, or are deceiving themselves.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
IF you believe that learning is more important than grades and that the <br/>
schools are deeply flawed, what do you care about the difference between an F <br/>
and a D or a D and a C?  <br/>
<br/>
Get this:  For mother&#39;s day a friend printed out an article on a study on IQ <br/>
and breastfeeding.  The study was done in Denmark, and showed a 6 point <br/>
average advantage on IQ tests for teens and adults who had been breasted <br/>
until they were nine months old.  (They didn&#39;t check for level of <br/>
education/dropping out, etc, just straight correspondence, and they found no <br/>
further difference if the children were nursed past the nine months.)<br/>
<br/>
In the article, about the six points, it said <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That gap &quot;is not the difference between an Einstein and a mentally retarded <br/>
child,&quot; said study director June Machover Reinisch.  But she said it could be <br/>
the difference &quot;between normal and bright-normal, or bright-normal and <br/>
superior.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The very ideas of a scale which would be considered an important reality <br/>
being divided into &quot;normal and bright-normal&quot; and on from there to the <br/>
important edge between &quot;bright-normal and superior&quot; is SUCH A JOKE.<br/>
<br/>
AND... we know these IQ tests are after verbal, logical and mathematical <br/>
stuff.  How did breastfeeding affect musical ability?  Affinity with nature?  <br/>
Kinesthetic abilities?  Interpersonal skills?  WHO CARES!?    Those things <br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot; and measurable.  <br/>
<br/>
So happy  mother&#39;s day to me--I might have brought my kids from normal to <br/>
*bright*0-normal.</div>

I breastfeed my baby because it&#39;s what nature intended for me to do! <br/>
I breastfeed him because he&#39;s happier and healthier and I don&#39;t need <br/>
anyone to tell me that my body can produce a better milk for him than <br/>
something made in a factory!!<br/>
I breastfeed him until he&#39;s ready to not be breastfed and I&#39;m sad <br/>
that a person might only do it the first year because so many of the <br/>
studies might not point to long term benefits.<br/>
If he needs it, then it&#39;s my job to provide it.<br/>
And the side benefit is we are bonding each and every time he latches <br/>
on and I look into those beautiful eyes.<br/>

Obviously you missed the point I was trying to make...<br/>
<br/>
Duh!! I don&#39;t care about the grade... the point I was trying to make is that they have this standard... hence the grade. But they don&#39;t live up to it themselves... I was saying how terribly flawed this whole ps system really is.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure why, but for some reason you seem to have it in for me. It was my hope to meet other Unschoolers (people who think learning is a great thing, exploring new things is a wonderful experience), I had hoped that I would gain insight, and learn. I had hoped I would find support. Not be yelled at or put down every time my opinions or thoughts don&#39;t line up with yours. You may not think so, but it is not easy to come to a group of people and open up and share. It is scary... what if this isn&#39;t the way Unschooling works? I shared in hopes of learning. I don&#39;t mind being told that you disagree, or that I could be wrong... Great.... Teach me. Oh wait, you don&#39;t teach. Then lead me to the answers to find on my own. I am sorry to say that all I see is an atmosphere of hostility. I will do you the favor of leaving all groups you are on. If this is what the Unschooler is like, I may need to reconsider my decisions about Unschooling. This is most certainly not the atmosphere I wish to bring my children into.<br/>
<br/>
Good Bye....<br/>

<br/>
The post seemed to be irritated about details of grading.  Grades doesn&#39;t <br/>
prove or disprove learning.  Outside of school itself, grades are meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is way outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not sure why, but for some reason you seem to have it in for me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t so at all.  I&#39;m sorry you feel that way.  I had answered that post <br/>
with no clue who it was from.  I was only talking about the idea of numbers <br/>
and comparisons between one range (as grades, or IQ points) and another.<br/>
<br/>
The story about breastfeeding and IQ had just reminded me that the whole idea <br/>
of putting huge labels and importance on ranges of test scores is hugely <br/>
flawed, artificial, and of very little use in the real world (including the <br/>
real unschooling world).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am sorry to say that all I see is an atmosphere of hostility. I will do <br/>
you the favor of leaving all groups you are on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It does me no benefit or harm.  I didn&#39;t mean to be hostile, I was trying to <br/>
discuss the idea of grading, and the futility of being upset about grades <br/>
once you decide to unschool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the purposes of this list is to discuss ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Not people.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we become so attached to our ideas and beliefs that when someone<br/>
takes one and examines it the examination can feel like a personal attack.<br/>
<br/>
There is support and encouragement here. There is also examination of ideas,<br/>
beliefs and entrenched ways of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Some people prefer the first so they can come slowly to this new way of<br/>
thinking. Some people prefer the second so an &quot;aha&quot; moment can dramatically<br/>
change their thinking. Hopefully the two needs can coexist peacefully here.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to keep in mind that everyone is here to help in the best way<br/>
they know how.<br/>
<br/>
Just as unschoolers accept that every child will learn differently, so too<br/>
do adults. Some people need support. Some people need to read examples from<br/>
others lives. Some people need very detailed step by step answers. Some<br/>
people need to have their thinking shaken up. All those needs can be met<br/>
here. We just need to pick and choose from the variety that is being freely<br/>
offered. A style of answer someone doesn&#39;t like may be exactly what someone<br/>
else needs to hear. (So it&#39;s also helpful to keep in mind that what may feel<br/>
like a conversation between two people is actually a public discussion and<br/>
examination of ideas with many silent people listening and learning.)<br/>
<br/>
If someone finds their ideas being examined and it makes them uncomfortable,<br/>
some people find it useful to ask themselves why the examination makes them<br/>
uncomfortable. Other people find it useful to read as though their best<br/>
friend were saying the words so they don&#39;t mistakenly read in a tone that<br/>
wasn&#39;t intended. And other people find it useful to just skip posts by<br/>
certain people whose style rubs them the wrong way. (It may be a style that<br/>
someone else is getting a great deal out of.)<br/>
<br/>
But above all remember people are just trying to help. If it doesn&#39;t help<br/>
you it&#39;s helping someone else.<br/>

I understand you are trying to keep the peace. But in this case, it isn&#39;t that I have a problem with being told I may be wrong. Well, it isn&#39;t worth getting into again. If you really want to understand it, it would be easier to read through the thread on that topic, but you would need to include the thread on a couple of other groups as well. Her attacks were not limited to this group. That is probably why I took it &quot;Personally&quot;. I am sorry I have made so much trouble for you to worry about. Like I said, I will be leaving. As for not knowing who you are responding to... well I think it is important when you are in an ongoing thread to have an idea of who the &quot;players&quot; are. That simple thing would have saved a lot of trouble.<br/>

public.  I don&#39;t keep notes and charts on who&#39;s who, who&#39;s where, who&#39;s <br/>
homeschooled how long, who has kids how old.  I&#39;m just looking at the ideas <br/>
