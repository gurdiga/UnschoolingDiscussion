PS My hair is usually dyed pink or red or purple.<br/>
Hides the grey a <br/>
treat<br/>
:)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My hair has been all those colours too! I went blue<br/>
for awhile as well. But now I&#39;m just a dirty blond (in<br/>
the hair colour sense - honest!). I&#39;ve been au natural<br/>
for almost 3 years now.<br/>
<br/>
If any unschoolers are in the Northern California<br/>
vicinity, you would be welcome to stop by here. We&#39;re<br/>
in Paradise, CA (near Chico and about 2 hours north of<br/>
Sacramento). Like Shyrley said, bring sleeping bags<br/>
(although we do have a futon in the l.r. and Tamzin<br/>
usually sleeps with me, leaving her bed free as well,<br/>
so bags on the floor would depend on how many of you<br/>
there were) and be prepared for vegetarian food! We<br/>
have 2 dogs and a cat.<br/>
