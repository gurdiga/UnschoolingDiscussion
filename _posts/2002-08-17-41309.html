<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422411734">My take on this is a little bit different.  I believe that all people <br/>
are born sinful, but that only God can change people.  Our job as <br/>
parents is to teach them the truth and point them toward God, but <br/>
ultimately only God can change their hearts.  We don&#39;t need to beat <br/>
the bad out of them or anything.  <br/>
