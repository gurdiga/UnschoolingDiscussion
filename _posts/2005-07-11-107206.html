<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817168022">Almost time for the Unschoolers Potluck Supper and Games:<br/>
<br/>
Wed. July 13, starting at 5 PM at Redwood Park in Oakland.<br/>
<br/>
We will meet at Redwood Park&#39;s Roberts Recreation Area, in the picnic<br/>
area above the parking lot (the grassy field by the playground near<br/>
Roberts Pool). For more information about the location, please see<br/>
www.ebparks.org/parks/robrec.htm.<br/>
<br/>
Please bring:<br/>
    * a dish to share,<br/>
    * something to drink,<br/>
    * a picnic blanket and/or folding chairs,<br/>
    * your own plates and eating utensils<br/>
    * flashlight for flashlight tag, if desired<br/>
    * any other games/rec equipment you want<br/>
There may be a charge for parking, so please be prepared with small bills <br/>
or coins (or East Bay Parks card).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re planning a get-to-know-each-other game (optional, of course), hoping <br/>
to keep it not too long or lame, but just as a way to get to know each <br/>
other more easily.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll also bring a big parachute.<br/>
<br/>
Any questions?  Please contact either Robyn Talman at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ratalman@...">ratalman@...</a> or <br/>
Pam Tellew at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamtellew@...">pamtellew@...</a><br/>
<br/>
We hope to see you there!<br/>
Robyn Talman and Pam Tellew<br/>
