&lt;&lt; I know so many people hear ideas of what *could* be done in an <br/>
unschooling situation that constitutes math (or whatever) like shopping with <br/>
Mom, but actual accounts are hard to find.  For me anyway...am I missing <br/>
something??  Would anyone here be interested in that sort of thing?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

part of an unfinished set of stuff which starts here  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/life">http://sandradodd.com/life</a><br/>
<br/>
but the &quot;typical day&quot; collection is here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
and I have a few more I haven&#39;t put in yet.  If any of you want to send one, <br/>
do!!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book called Patchwork of Days with people&#39;s typical days but VERY <br/>
few were unschoolers (maybe just our family, come to think of it, and most <br/>
were very church and structure oriented, so I wanted an unschooling <br/>
collection.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing something other than typical days, ignore this. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
