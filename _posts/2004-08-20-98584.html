 </span></blockquote>More info on this would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
I had a student dentist hype me up on gum that had<br/>
sorbitol in it, claiming sorbitol &#39;did not cause<br/>
cavities- it helped fight them!&#39;<br/>
Well!  I went out and bought a heap of gum that had<br/>
sorbitol in it(Orbit is one brand).  I also bought<br/>
some Kid&#39;s Trident.  After all, it had a smiling tooth<br/>
on it!  I gave some to my 2 1/2 year old who *hated*<br/>
brushing his teeth and thought great, this will help! <br/>
I warned him that gum was for chewing only, and not<br/>
eating.  He swallowed it after 3 seconds and I told<br/>
him that now it was going to have to come out of his<br/>
butthole.  That *freaked* him out.  OK, maybe I<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have mentioned it.  I then explained that<br/>
gum was not for swallowing and when he was done to put<br/>
it in the garbage. (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for his<br/>
digestive system). He practiced this alot; opening a<br/>
piece of gum, putting it in his mouth for 3 seconds<br/>
then putting it in the garbage.  Over and over.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think he even bothered chewing it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, to make a long story longer, I had a severe<br/>
hive allergic reaction that I am certain was due to<br/>
the sorbitol in the gum.  It is just another<br/>
artificial sweetener, after all even though it does<br/>
come from a fruit.  There are no super anti-cavity<br/>
powers in it, in my opinion.  What helps in chewing<br/>
gum is all the extra saliva that gets created.  That<br/>
helps to flush and loosen the bacteria in the mouth. <br/>
I would recommend buying some natural chewing gum<br/>
rather than gum with artificial sweeteners- especially<br/>
sorbitol because you swallow alot of it.<br/>
<br/>
I came across sorbitol again when I was researching<br/>
vaccine ingredients recently.  Interestingly enough,<br/>
it is found in several vaccines including Attenuvax<br/>
(measles), Biavax (rubella), MMR<br/>
(measles-mumps-rubella), M-R-Vax (measles-rubella),<br/>
Meruvax 1 (mumps), Orimune (oral polio) and YF-Vax<br/>
(yellow fever).<br/>

<br/>
If you google search sorbitol you can find several<br/>
sites that go into detail of various uses for sorbitol<br/>
and the various allergic reactions.<br/>
