required.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is what we do.  I take them to a vet and say &quot;Just make them legal.&quot;<br/>
Here in Texas it is just a rabies vaccination and I am only doing that<br/>
because our psycho lab/dalmation mix will be attending dog obedience classes<br/>
next week.<br/>
<br/>
As far as a vet, we have been happiest with a vet that is used to dealing<br/>
with farm animals.  We called the county extension agent and asked if they<br/>
knew of any vets in our area that gave price breaks to FFA and 4-H kids.  We<br/>
couldn&#39;t be happier.<br/>
