To fully appreciate the following, you should first read the NEA 2000-2001<br/>

FUN 2000-2001 Resolutions<br/>
<br/>
RU-4.0 Public Schooling<br/>
<br/>
The Family Unschoolers Network believes that public schooling programs<br/>
cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience.1 When<br/>
public schooling occurs, students enrolled must meet all parental<br/>
requirements.2 Public schooling should be limited to the children of the<br/>
immediate family who choose to attend public school. As long as the expenses<br/>
of public schooling are borne by the taxpayers, those funds must also be<br/>
made available to parents/guardians for use in the educational program of<br/>
their choice whether that be public schools, charter schools, private<br/>
schools, or homeschools. Instruction should be by persons who are approved<br/>
by the appropriate parent or guardian, and a curriculum approved by the<br/>
parent or guardian should be used.<br/>
<br/>
The Network also believes that public-schooled students should not<br/>
participate in any extracurricular activities that are not open to all<br/>
students. Extracurricular programs paid for by the taxpayers must be open to<br/>
all residents.<br/>
<br/>
The Network further believes that local homeschool parents should have the<br/>
authority to determine grade placement and/or credits earned toward<br/>
graduation for students entering or re-entering a homeschool setting from a<br/>
public school setting.3 (1988, 2000)<br/>
<br/>
================<br/>
1) Public school programs artificially segregate children by age and require<br/>
seating at desks set in rows. This does not permit a normal social<br/>
interaction with other children or adults such as may occur in everyday life<br/>
outside of a school setting. The low number of adults encountered in the<br/>
public school setting provides little opportunity for children to see the<br/>
modeling of appropriate social behaviors and they are thus more likely to<br/>
see only the behaviors of other children their own age without an<br/>
appropriate social context.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, public schools cannot provide the customized, extensive and<br/>
flexible curriculum available to the homeschool. The public school setting<br/>
artificially schedules learning and segregates it into separate subjects<br/>
with a limited amount of allocated time per day. This limits activities to<br/>
what can fit the allocated time slot and to what can easily be classified as<br/>
related to a particular subject. The predetermined schedule also means that<br/>
many children will either not have enough time to master the material before<br/>
moving on, or will have to waste time on material they have already mastered<br/>
before moving on.<br/>
<br/>
2) Parents have a compelling interest in the education of their children and<br/>
should therefore be able to determine the requirements that must be met when<br/>
their children are educated in public school.<br/>
<br/>
3) Test scores and evaluations from public schools may not be accurate<br/>
indicators of knowledge or proficiency and are often of little value in<br/>
determining grade placement or credits for a homeschool setting. The scores<br/>
often reflect only the ability to memorize material long enough to complete<br/>
a test, and the skill set being evaluated is often limited. Therefore, the<br/>
Network recommends that the initial months of homeschooling a former public<br/>
school student be used primarily to explore the interests and abilities of<br/>
the student while allowing the family to adapt to the challenges of the<br/>
independence and integration of the flexible and multi-disciplinary<br/>
environment of homeschooling which can provide hands-on, &quot;real world&quot;<br/>
activities not available in public school settings.<br/>
