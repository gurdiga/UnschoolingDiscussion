 </span></blockquote>I have a friend, Caroline, in whose house this was a reality. Her mom refused <br/>
to have her in the kitchen AT ALL. The first time she&#39;d ever cooked anything <br/>
we were in our early teens at my house; we made breakfast (bacon, eggs, <br/>
grits, etc.). She was AMAZED at how cooking &quot;happened&quot;. I can still see her <br/>
face! A year later, my dad taught her how to make and flip crepes---she was <br/>
thrilled!<br/>
<br/>
I remember making breakfast when I was six---burnt toast and VERY crisp bacon <br/>
and eggs with surely undrinkable coffee---for my parents as <br/>
&quot;breakfast-in-bed&quot; with no assistance. They smiled as they forced down every <br/>
bite.<br/>
<br/>
I also remember almost burning down the kitchen making homemade french fries <br/>
(cut up potatoes and deep fried!) when no one was at home (I was seven!). <br/>
Luckily a neighbor was available to put out the fire!<br/>
<br/>
I have no fear in the kitchen. Not everything is palatable &lt;G&gt;, but it&#39;s <br/>
always fun! I hope my boys feel the same way!<br/>
<br/>
Caroline now eats out most meals or her husband cooks.<br/>

So if you don&#39;t let your kids learn how to cook they will be able to eat<br/>
out or have someone else cook for them?  Maybe Caroline&#39;s parents knew<br/>
something?  *grin*  I really did understand your point and agree but I&#39;m<br/>
not sure if the last sentence there helps your case.  LOL<br/>

<br/>
That is the best time to cook.  The only time I can sew is when the<br/>
inspiration or the mood hits me.  Luckily I don&#39;t have anyone else deciding<br/>
when I can or cannot do so.  I believe it is the same for children.  If the<br/>

them do it then and there if at all possible.  Opportunities can be lost<br/>
otherwise.  Once they have been denied too many times they will stop asking.<br/>
Why suffocate their desires for certain experiences?<br/>
<br/>
For instance, it is raining here and I have four happy children dancing on<br/>
my back patio getting wet.  My parents wouldn&#39;t have allowed that.  It would<br/>
have been too much trouble to get out towels for everyone....they might<br/>
track in mud.....etc, etc....  The neighbor girl just came in to tell me my<br/>
kids were playing with the sidewalk chalk and getting it all over their<br/>
shirts.  I told her that&#39;s what we have a washing machine for....lol.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to let go and have fun.  I know how she feels, it took me<br/>
years to figure it out.  I don&#39;t want my kids to go through that.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I know it isn&#39;t possible to do that.  My son has been<br/>
wanting to go to Legoland in San Diego.  We just can&#39;t afford that right<br/>
now.  Hopefully we will be able to soon.  But we say yes as much as we<br/>
possibly can.  It makes saying no a little easier when we have to.<br/>

One of the things that bugged me the most about my ex-mil was her automatic <br/>
&quot;no&quot; to every request from her kids.  Very frequently it would turn into a <br/>
&quot;yes&quot; after they argued with her, but it always started out as &quot;no&quot;.  So <br/>
they learned to argue with everything she said.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since becoming parents we have had to retrain ourselves from that automatic<br/>
no. So when the littlies would play with something dangerous - like the<br/>
electric cords I would say &quot;stop, that is dangerous&quot; - I would also try and<br/>
say yes as much as possible - ie/ the other day my son asked his dad if he<br/>
could make some pancakes - dad said &quot;not just yet I am cleaning&quot; My son had<br/>
a melt down - I said to my partner that in the same situation I would say<br/>
&quot;yes that sounds great, lets clear up this mess so that we have room to<br/>
cook&quot; I get the child who not only helps clean up (well sometimes) but one<br/>
who doesn&#39;t have a melt down but waits more patiently. It&#39;s just the way you<br/>
say it, I believe.<br/>
