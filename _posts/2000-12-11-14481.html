<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683277642">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I nursed my son until almost 4 3/4 years old.   I too was starting to<br/>
get annoyed with him as he&#39;d only nurse at  night once or twice.  He was<br/>
getting so big he was waking me up.  I decided it bothered me too much<br/>
and also on the advice of a friend who nursed for along time as well we<br/>
decide he didn&#39;t need it.  We use the family bed and he sleeps with us.<br/>
When he was nursing I&#39;d wear a short midriff shirt so he&#39;s have easy<br/>
access.  I just began wearing a long T-shirt so he couldn&#39;t get to it.<br/>
He whimpered a bit and tried to pull up my shirt.  After a night or two<br/>
he didn&#39;t complain and just cuddled up against me and fell asleep.   He<br/>
had also nursed to sleep while I&#39;d read to him.   Well I still read him<br/>
to sleep but he can fall asleep in the car, in front of the TV with<br/>
Dad.  My son is now 6 1/2.  As to how it affected fertility I don&#39;t know<br/>
since we weren&#39;t trying at the time.   We did try to get pregnant the<br/>
last year or so and have decided now that one child is enough.  My<br/>
fertility is probably lower now as both of us are about 43 and often one<br/>
or the other of us falls asleep with our son at night.  How do people<br/>
have more than one child?<br/>
<br/>
An different nursing story.  When I was no longer employed outside of<br/>
the home and my son was a bit over two he stopped nursing cold turkey<br/>
for 2 1/2 days.  He didn&#39;t have any physical condition.  I was<br/>
uncomfortable physically and an emotional wreck (partly due to hormone<br/>
drop).  When I asked him later why he stopped, he said he just wanted<br/>
find out what he was like.<br/>

&gt; Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
&gt;My son is now 6 1/2.  As to how it affected fertility I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; since we weren&#39;t trying at the time.   We did try to get pregnant the<br/>

Hi, Sherry --<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 6 1/2 year old &quot;only&quot; that&#39;s a boy.  I&#39;m with you on wondering<br/>
&quot;how do people do it?&quot;  We have only one child because the exhaustion and<br/>
sleep deprivation with this one felt like it nearly killed us.  I just don&#39;t<br/>
have the stamina for another kid.  I&#39;m impressed by the people that do.<br/>
