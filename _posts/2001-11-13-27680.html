&gt; Excellent points Sandra. . . and for me, since every thing we see around <br/>
&gt; us. . .every single thing begins with a thought, my belief is that all <br/>
&gt; dis-ease begins with a thought. . . not to say there are other things <br/>
&gt; contributing, but if certainly begins there. I think the thought process we <br/>
&gt; put into what we eat, when we prepare it, eat it, digest it, etc. has the <br/>
&gt; most effect on how our body uses it. Controlling thoughts all the time cant <br/>
&gt; be good for the digestive system. . . its a good reminder for me today.<br/>
