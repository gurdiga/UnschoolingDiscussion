<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595210097">I&#39;ve been perusing the rethinking education conference website and <br/>
I&#39;m confused as to what it&#39;s actually about.  It alludes to being <br/>
about unschooling but it includes all this other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is no need for arbitrary structure in education; the use of <br/>
coercion, rewards or other behavior modification techniques as <br/>
motivation are counterproductive. With freedom, respect and nurturing <br/>
support, children have a powerful drive to self-direct their own <br/>
learning; the result being children who direct their own education... <br/>
indeed, their own futures.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I pulled that quote from the home page of the website.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
really sound like unschooling to me.  At least not what I&#39;ve come to <br/>
understand unschooling to be.<br/>
<br/>
I know the whole &quot;what is unschooling?&quot; question gets put into that <br/>
category of personal interpretation.  I&#39;m not really looking for an <br/>
answer to that either.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I had encountered the above quote when I first started on <br/>
this path, it would have led me in a very different direction than <br/>
I&#39;ve been on the last years.  This idea of &quot;self-directed&quot; <br/>
and &quot;directing their own education&quot; seems very different from what <br/>
actually happens in our daily lives.  It is a lot of schoolishness <br/>
added to the thinking process of really &quot;getting&quot; unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In real life, it is so much simpler than that.  I guess that is what <br/>
it boils down to for me.  Unschooling is simpler, not harder or more <br/>
difficult.  There are challenges in parenting, that sort of comes <br/>
with the territory of parenting.  Those challenges have been <br/>
minimized and made simpler with unschooling.  Anything adversarial <br/>
creates tension, and tension to any situation makes it harder.  <br/>
Creating adversary seems ever present in traditional parenting <br/>
ideas.  Schools can create adversarial relationships between children <br/>
and parents, that seems really clear to me.<br/>
<br/>
There are thousands of ways of coming to unschooling, yet it still <br/>
seems simpler than what a lot of people make it out to be. <br/>
<br/>
What are other people&#39;s views on this?</div>

In some cases schools overtly intend to &quot;wean&quot; kids of their parents  <br/>
one way or another.  Not every school, not every year, but sometimes  <br/>
there come times.   New Math was a time when I know some teachers  <br/>
were encouraged to tell their kids not to talk to their parents about  <br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976264304">One of the things that made me first consider pulling my dd out of preschool<br/>
was when there was a phase when the kids started hiding when the parents<br/>
arrived.  It was a teacher-created &quot;game.&quot;  &quot;Quick, Johnny, hide!&quot; the<br/>
teacher would call out to each kid, sotto voce, &quot;Here comes your dad!&quot;  My<br/>
daughter loved this game and started playing it herself, a lot, and I<br/>
quickly began to realize that it set up the teachers as the ones with the<br/>
bonds with the kids &quot;against&quot; the parents who were put in the outsider role.<br/>
<br/>
It was hard to bring this up with the lead teacher, because I had the sense<br/>
that she had not done this with any deliberate negative intent, and I didn&#39;t<br/>
want to seem humorless.  But I did tell her that my ideal dream is for my<br/>
daughter to run to me with a wide open embrace each time we reunited, and<br/>
since that was unlikely to happen every time, I at least hoped that she<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to keep up this pattern of screaming and running to hide.  I<br/>
think the teacher (a nice person) got it, and that game wound down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342184051">I don&#39;t have experience with that specific conference. I know cool<br/>
unschoolers who have gone to speak and have had a *great* time...<br/>
though it really is different than an *unschooling* conference.<br/>
I went to a few of the homeschool conferences in South Dakota and vowed<br/>
never again!  Adversarial doesn&#39;t begin to describe what they were modeling<br/>
in the scariest of all god contexts... ick! (where I ironically began saying<br/>
to myself &quot;If you find yourself being a jerk to your kids about schoolwork<br/>
at home, send them to school, where a paid professional can be mean to them<br/>
and you get to welcome them home as the Sweet Mommy&quot; which did evolve into a<br/>
simpler &quot;don&#39;t be a jerk! Be Nice&quot;)<br/>
Then I heard amazing things about Live and<br/>
Learn&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnconference.org">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a>&gt;and wanted to check it out<br/>
*with my kids*!  We went to Peabody, MA in 2004<br/>
-- there is NOTHING in this world like seeing unschooling in action in every<br/>
corner and every nook of a hotel! (and freshly 6 year old Hayden met 16 year<br/>
old Marty ::bg:: and I got faces to all of the *voices* I&#39;d read for years &<br/>
friends I&#39;ll keep my whole life, too).   Albuquerque 2006 will always be a<br/>
very favorite experience of mine, I think Hotel Albuquerque is the *perfect*<br/>
venue for a few hundred unschoolers :) (if ever there was someone who maybe<br/>
wanted to schedule something there sometime, I&#39;d come :::bg::: just sayin)<br/>
This year in SC will be the last L&L.<br/>
This Memorial Weekend there is a regional conference on both coasts :D<br/>
Northeast<br/>
Unschooling Conference<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/</a>&gt;Peabody, MA (near<br/>
Boston) and L.I.F.E.<br/>
is Good &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifeisgoodconference.com">http://lifeisgoodconference.com</a>&gt; Vancouver, WA (near portland) I<br/>
promise either of these will blow your mind -- with Joy, of course :D (I<br/>
only wish I could do both!!) If there&#39;s a way to make it happen, you really<br/>
should come check us out!<br/>
I&#39;m venturing into the homeschool waters again, this weekend. It&#39;s a leap of<br/>
faith on my part; heretofore I&#39;ve only spoken in my *comfort* zone and this<br/>
is way out of it! Luckily, I tend to bring the party with me, so I know I&#39;ll<br/>
have fun. I get to talk, officially to 21 people who signed up for me ;) and<br/>
perhaps bring some love, trust and gentleness where before there wasn&#39;t<br/>
enough (yes, I shall be channelling a good many of you :::vbeg:::) It won&#39;t<br/>
be an unschooling conference, it&#39;s an unschooler at a conference -- a very<br/>
different thing. A different depth of understanding.<br/>

<br/>
I spoke there last year and it is very much an unschooling conference,<br/>
contrary to how some people view it. They do include some<br/>
&quot;alternative&quot; types of stuff, which tends to attract Montessori<br/>
teachers and others who look at education from an intellectual pov.<br/>
But it is hugely and wholely a very unschooling conference.<br/>
<br/>
The same lively energy that exists at Live and Learn is at RE. The<br/>
same huge swirl of happy kids and respectful parents and amazing<br/>
funshops is there. It tends to draw a slightly different crowd to some<br/>
degree, but for the most part it is full of unschoolers and<br/>
unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a great weekend.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an interesting point, because, as far as my son Pat is<br/>
concerned, I talk about &#39;self-education&#39; far more than I do about<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39;. I think of &#39;education&#39; in the original sense - from the<br/>
Latin educare, &quot;to bring out that which is within&quot; - but I see from a<br/>
quick visit to Google that by far the most common usage of the word is<br/>
in the sense of imparting knowledge to another person, usually in a<br/>
structured form. <br/>
<br/>
Which is not related at all to what actually happens in my daily life<br/>
with my son. <br/>
