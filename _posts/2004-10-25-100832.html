&lt;&lt; Last night I bought <br/>
her the boxed set of dvd&#39;s of Broadway: the American Musical -- which <br/>
recently showed on PBS. The DVD&#39;s have, of course, hours of extras. It <br/>
was $60 and my friend was surprised I&#39;d spend that on such a thing. <br/>
Would somebody hesitate to pay that for an advanced astronomy series  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or for a one-day workshop on musical theatre!<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I have listened to and discussed The Beatles on our last two road <br/>
trips.  This last weekend, though the trip itself had to do with 19th century <br/>
settlements and boom towns, the drive itself was about what makes really good <br/>
rock&#39;n&#39;roll singing (Meatloaf on Bat Out of Hell, some pretty deep analysis of <br/>
tone and phrasing), what makes &quot;sexy&quot;  (Meatloaf and Prince as odd but <br/>
definite examples, and Marty making jokes about what he would tell his kids someday <br/>
if they&#39;re rediscovering late 20th century rock and he says that Meatloaf was a <br/>
movie star and a great and sexy singer, and they might question his <br/>
judgment), and some discussion on the path from swing music to rockabilly.  (We had <br/>
discussed the whole &quot;Negro-music&quot; and Black-labels business and John Lennon&#39;s <br/>
fascination with that style on the way to see Civil War battlesites earlier in <br/>
the month.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SO anyway, this morning I find this e-mail:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I hope you either saw or will soon see the special on PBS about John <br/>
Lennon&#39;s<br/>
Jukebox.  It&#39;s outstanding.  Interviews with many of the musicians that John<br/>
grew up listening to.<br/>
<br/>
CB-=-<br/>
<br/>
And I responded, before reading Pam&#39;s note above:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see it and didn&#39;t know about it.<br/>
Thanks for letting me know!<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I have gone on two road trips and mostly listened to old Beatles.  <br/>
The fith birthday, and we heard a couple of radio tribute shows.   Then just <br/>
the past three days we went to Lordsburg and Silver City and thereabout, and <br/>
listened to CDs and the names &quot;Carl Perkins,&quot; &quot;Little Richard&quot; and &quot;Chubby <br/>
Checker&quot; were mentioned aloud. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it being a PBS thing the DVD might be really expensive,but it might <br/>
be worth it, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
We saw ghost towns.  Stein&#39;s and Shakespeare.   Parts of other towns that are <br/>
ghostly. &lt;g&gt;  Hillsboro.  Pinos Altos.  Talked to people everywhere, heard <br/>
stories, went into little museums that were more like &quot;go ahead and pick it up&quot; <br/>
places full of dusty 1890&#39;s junk.  It was great.<br/>
