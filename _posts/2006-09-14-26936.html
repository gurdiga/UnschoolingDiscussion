<div id="ygrps-yiv-380952983"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  How can list-owners improve<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &quot;product&quot; if they can&#39;t receive some criticism once in a while?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-----------<br/>
<br/>
That quote was from a post that was not sent on to the  <br/>
unschoolingdiscussion list but was returned by one of the moderators.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of weeks ago, I complained to Pam Sorooshian (by phone,  <br/>
so I can&#39;t cut and paste what I said) that when someone wrote she  <br/>
would look into my links for a half hour that evening, it was like  <br/>
people put off vacuum cleaner salesmen, or say &quot;Well show me, but I&#39;m  <br/>
still going to the Kirby dealer later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It kinda makes me cranky for people to treat me like a sales lady,  <br/>
but probably the worst part is that they expect me to treat them as a  <br/>
sales lady should treat a potential customer.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there they don&#39;t get the fact that I don&#39;t make a  <br/>
commission when someone decides to unschool.  I&#39;m not selling a  <br/>
curriculum.  The owners of the Unschooling Discussion list don&#39;t get  <br/>
dividends at the end of the year proportional to the number of people  <br/>
who are on that list.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, and the discussions from which unschooling understanding  <br/>
rises, are both PROCESSES, not products.<br/>
<br/>
I have more to say, but I&#39;m just now feeling well enough to do some  <br/>
laundry and dishes after a week of conference and three days of being  <br/>
sick.<br/>
Anyone with more clarity or ideas should jump in.  I need to process  <br/>
through the feeling that people think I&#39;m a rude saleswoman and that  <br/>
they&#39;ll (what, report me to the management?  Go to another  <br/>
store?????!!!!)<br/>

it&#39;s not about labels, and it&#39;s not a competition.<br/>

<br/>
There is an element of that.<br/>
Some seem to think it would hurt me, somehow if they went and bought  <br/>
a big curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
And curriculum salesmen have their patter down.  LOTS of  <br/>
homeschooling dads went into the curriculum selling business so they  <br/>
could get their own family&#39;s curriculum free and &quot;not have to work&quot;  <br/>
but could live off homeschooling, fifteen years ago.  I&#39;m sure still,  <br/>
now, at the big state or Christian conferences (sometimes that&#39;s the  <br/>
same thing, when something is called a state conference but it&#39;s run  <br/>
by and for Christian homeschoolers) the guys selling that stuff are  <br/>
dads of homeschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
They will sell it to you in five MINUTES.  They DO care if you buy.   <br/>
They want something.  They don&#39;t care if you like it later, they&#39;ve  <br/>
gotten what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Hey, sorry babe, but you live in another state. I&#39;ll<br/>
never have the slightest impact from your<br/>
choices--it&#39;s between you (probably plural) and your<br/>
kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Even if they lived next door to me their nattery indecisive opinion  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have the slightest impact on the happiness at my house.<br/>
<br/>
Those critical of unschooling hurt themselves worse than they can  <br/>
ever begin to hurt unschoolers.  They show their negativity and their  <br/>
ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
The opinion of a hundred gathered together can&#39;t touch my kids&#39;  <br/>
lives.  They can&#39;t make me doubt that what has happened at our house  <br/>
in the past 20 years since Kirby was born actually happened.   <br/>
Attachment parenting and nursing and playing with them and listening  <br/>
to them and not making them go to school... it DID happen, and the  <br/>
results wake up here every morning.<br/>
<br/>
I could have kept it secret, but for one thing it&#39;s easier to do with  <br/>
others to brainstorm with, and with other families to watch for  <br/>
ideas.  That&#39;s been great.  The typical days collection is one of my  <br/>
favorites:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
I was doing penance, at first, and was going to help people for three  <br/>
or four years (I used to know the number but I&#39;ve forgotten) to make  <br/>
up for having talked my cousin Nada out of homeschooling her first  <br/>
child, when I was childless.   But it was fun, and I kept on, and was  <br/>
invited to speak and I started meeting more families I really liked.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t take that away from me.<br/>
<br/>
When AOL&#39;s homeschooling forum went small and stunted and was run by  <br/>
people who weren&#39;t even homeschoolers, and a great deal of what we  <br/>
used to be able to get to was gone, I realized that  I really wanted  <br/>
to find ways to make the good stuff available.  So I experimented  <br/>
with various little free webpages (some of them are still out there  <br/>
because they provided no way at all to delete the pages), and  <br/>
eventually got a good site where I could collect things.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t take that away from me.<br/>
<br/>
Both yahoogroups and googlegroups provide simple ways to create and  <br/>
maintain discussion lists which people can read by e-mail, digest-by- <br/>
e-mail, or at the websites.  I&#39;ve kept this list for nearly five  <br/>
years, and UnschoolingDiscussion, whose name and ownership have  <br/>
changed a few times, is old now, seven and a half years old now (and  <br/>
moved to googlegroups).<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t take that away.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there are a few people, a handful, who WANT to take those things,  <br/>
or change them, or claim them.<br/>
They can&#39;t.<br/>
They can&#39;t have my birthday.<br/>
They can&#39;t have my husband.<br/>
They can&#39;t have my computer, even.<br/>
They can&#39;t be me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They and their kids are a team, and if one side loses,<br/>

homeschooling lists.-=-<br/>
<br/>
YES.<br/>
They can take small and large steps to make their own lives better,  <br/>
but there seem to be a few in each season who think (in some  <br/>
unhealthy way) that if they can only prove the happy families wrong  <br/>
that the curve will change and their family&#39;s score will be better.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fascinating like a wreck.<br/>

<br/>
It IS only a very small handful.<br/>
<br/>
There are many, many more on these lists, who have learned and grown and<br/>
grasped unschooling. Some of us with speed and grace, some struggling to<br/>
hang on to old ideas before finally letting go.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m feeling bad about something I&#39;ve done or said to one of my kids, or<br/>
I feel vaguely wrong about how I&#39;m unschooling, I read here and it comes<br/>
clear again. I get refreshed and energised.<br/>
<br/>
I love to have this place where it&#39;s assumed that the best think I can do is<br/>
love and help my kids, to be honest with and supportive to them, to be their<br/>
ally in whatever they choose to pursue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856570685">Hi Sandra,<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry you are feeling worn out.  Let&#39;s face it, in our society almost everything is set up as product and sales.  And some people simply Don&#39;t Get It - and maybe never will.  John Holt talked about Hippopotamus questions.  When people would ask questions that had no connection to what he was talking about.  They just wanted to get attention directed back to themselves so they could talk about how un/homeschooling wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
 <br/>
Guess you surely know by now there are plenty of people that aren&#39;t going to understand, or even try to understand unschooling.  It makes them too afraid, to face the fact that the whole structure that they know and strongly believe in doesn&#39;t even need to exist for learning and growth to happen.  It would be a big jump for many people.<br/>
 <br/>
On the other hand, sometimes people take that idea, let it simmer and eventually work it, and work it, and decide that they can entertain making some change in their view of education.<br/>
 <br/>
So here&#39;s a hug (((((((((((((((((Sandra)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))<br/>
 <br/>
Hope you feel strong and well soon!<br/>
 <br/>
Love,<br/>
Connie<br/>
Who has also been put-down, misunderstood, and attacked thro the years - :-)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not feeling worn out, I&#39;m feeling really energized.<br/>
The more energy and the more activity, the more resentment I think I  <br/>
have for people who treat me like a high school sales girl.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about product vs. process a lot in the past few  <br/>
days.  What we&#39;re doing is so most definitely *process* that someone  <br/>
who comes along treating it like product totally messes up the process.<br/>
<br/>
I defend people&#39;s processes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another product thought I&#39;ve had concerns the types of unschooling  <br/>
and homeschooling sites that are out there and why they&#39;re out  <br/>
there.   If one is connected with a magazine, then the magazine has  <br/>
an interest in luring a quantity of people, not a quality of people.   <br/>
They will not want very radical ideas there, or at least will balance  <br/>
them other kinds of radical ideas because the baseline is is that  <br/>
they have a product.  Their primary process is to gain readership,  <br/>
paid or otherwise.  Numbers DO count, because they need stats to show  <br/>
advertisers, and because the publishers have mortgages and car payments.<br/>
<br/>
In a situation like Joyce&#39;s page, or mine, we don&#39;t have to  <br/>
compromise or give equal time to another philosophy, because we&#39;re  <br/>
giving information away at our own expense, not at the expense of  <br/>
glossy-full-page-international-advertising.<br/>
<br/>
I think magazines can be great, because not everyone has the  <br/>
internet, and it&#39;s a way for people who prefer print media or depend  <br/>
on it to get some current inspiration, and also some awareness of  <br/>
what resources they COULD buy or can buy if they want to.  And lots  <br/>
of the things advertised are just fun music and toy and art things.   <br/>
That&#39;s cool.  But still, advertisers get opinions about content and  <br/>
they can vote with their feet (figuratively speaking).<br/>
<br/>
So my volunteer time has to do with process of ideas, or parenting,  <br/>
of inspiring people and pointing out where things look like shaky  <br/>
justifications.   That&#39;s what I like to do and that&#39;s what some  <br/>
people want.  I&#39;m still somehow surprised every time someone objects  <br/>
so strongly, like I stepped into their path in the dark and surprised  <br/>
them, especially when they came to a place I either set up or that I  <br/>
help maintain or where I&#39;m a regular.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like this differentiation and I&#39;ve never seen it pointed out <br/>
specifically like this.  It really makes me think as I certainly did <br/>
view unschooling as a product until I &#39;got&#39; it more thoroughly and <br/>
for me that took a while because there was no literalness to it.  I <br/>
am such a literal person that I only knows what I know until I knows <br/>
something different.  I&#39;m still working on quanitfying uncshooling <br/>
for my own understanding because that is simply my nature and how I <br/>
am built, but I try to keep that inside. :)<br/>
<br/>
Because I have been so misundersood myself throughout my life, I try <br/>
my best to consider that everyone is doing the best that they can <br/>
with what they have.  When they give feedback, I accept that is <br/>
where they are at the moment and that it is more about themselves <br/>
than it is at all about me, do I can listen mindfully (most of the <br/>
time) and acknowledge their feelings without agreeing.  Or go away <br/>
from them if they are so loud that I can&#39;t hear myself.  Then I can  <br/>
remind myself of what I feel and think and let go of any frustration <br/>
that others can&#39;t see my point.<br/>
<br/>
After all, frustration seems to come from false expectations and <br/>
that&#39;s something I have come a long way in with my family, so why <br/>
not extend that gift to others. :)  The gift of accepting them as <br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
I still have hope for some people I know to see the light and go <br/>
from eclectic to unschooling, but I may be totally wrong about <br/>
that.  Either way, by accepting and flowing along with them, gently <br/>
pointing things out along the way, I hope to be a long term <br/>
influence, on the kids anyway, if not the parents. :)  I&#39;ve spent <br/>
too much of my life blocking the doorway, demanding that people <br/>
prove their acceptance of what I say before allowing them access and <br/>
in my mind, I try to keep the advice of a past mentor who showed me <br/>
you can be gentle with others while still not changing your own <br/>
mind. ;) <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like to get feedback.  I don&#39;t always do what people <br/>
recommend.  In fact, it depends quite a lot on where the feedback <br/>
comes from and what it entails as to whether I take that as valuable <br/>
input to do the exact opposite! :)<br/>
<br/>
Take care, c.</div>

like specifics and exactness. This may be what you don&#39;t like about <br/>
product vs. process, but I think a structure could be applied to <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
For example, NVC often gets criticized because of its &#39;formulaic&#39; <br/>
method, but it does give a clear starting point that can then be <br/>
adjusted and modified. This allows discussion of specifics for <br/>
understanding and acceptance or rejection. That sort of specific or <br/>
literalness is what I have been looking for in Unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I recently feel like the ball is moving more quickly for me or <br/>
perhaps it is a result of what you were referring to on the L&L list <br/>
as redefining pathways in how we think.  Maybe my pathways are <br/>
undergoing construction. :)<br/>
<br/>
Other things you&#39;ve said lately about working towards things rather <br/>
than seeing only two choices have also been speaking to me.  Having <br/>
goals and making choices that move us towards those goals is a <br/>
specific that I can take, put into practice and get better at.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, have these things been said all along and I can only now <br/>
hear them, even though I&#39;ve been listening with all my might or have <br/>
the right words just finally come along for me to hear?<br/>
<br/>
If there weren&#39;t a google of messages on this list, I would go back <br/>
and re-read them all. :)  I may still go back and read some old ones <br/>
just to see if I see them differently now. :)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am certainly feeling progres in my sorting and <br/>
ordering the concepts I am learning and I continue to refine and <br/>
comprehend as well as I can.<br/>
<br/>

That was someone else&#39;s quote, referring to &quot;What the bleep do we  <br/>
know,&quot; a source that also gags me.  I don&#39;t think people need to  <br/>
bathe their brains in channelled messages from 40,000 year old  <br/>
warriors (what the bleep is THAT!?), but they need to consciously and  <br/>
mindfully and logically CHOOSE what to do in the second.<br/>
<br/>
Some people see choice as some kind of &quot;what do you want to be when  <br/>
you grown up&quot; one single big choice.  I see it as do I keep typing  <br/>
this, or should I go and start the dishwasher and make some tea and  <br/>
then come back to this?   Should Holly and I drive 90 miles to get a  <br/>
kitten my nephew wants to give us, or should I wait a week until he  <br/>
can come down here?  There are other things we could do on that trip  <br/>
north.  Monday would be a good day.  I need to make phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
Flexibility and awareness are valuable to me.  I like to see those in  <br/>
others.  My husband had an SCA squire (who&#39;s now a knight, but it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a good match) who couldn&#39;t GET that people wanted him to be  <br/>
flexible and aware.  He wanted a checklist of things to do, and  <br/>
wanted someone else to tell him when he had done them sufficiently to  <br/>
quit and go on to another thing.   Bad match.  Keith wanted him to  <br/>
figure out what to do and quit when it was done.<br/>

mean, like &quot;become a gold medal skier&quot; or &quot;move to Texas by 2008),  <br/>
decisions made with a view toward reaching those goals might make  <br/>
unschooling dull or unworkable.  If making baskets of pineneedles  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get one to Texas, then it might be rejected as an unworthy  <br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
Marty made a hatband of pine needles last time he camped in the  <br/>
mountains.  It&#39;s beautiful.  I tried to photograph it but  my camera  <br/>
doesn&#39;t do closeups well.  It goes around the hat twice.     That&#39;s  <br/>
more process than product.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is the goal, then looking at maps of Texas, checking  <br/>
one&#39;s finances, seeing what&#39;s required locally before moving,  <br/>
watching movies about Texas, learning to change tires or repair the  <br/>
car, reupholstering a favorite chair--all those can fulfill learning  <br/>
AND Texas goals.<br/>
<br/>
Flexibility.  Broadness of base.  Expansion of scope, not narrow-beam  <br/>
vision.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wonder, have these things been said all along and I can only now<br/>
hear them, even though I&#39;ve been listening with all my might or have<br/>
the right words just finally come along for me to hear?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Half and half, maybe.  I listened to the Peaceful Parenting tape  <br/>
because I was doing a talk called Big Noisy Peace.   There were some  <br/>
things there I hadn&#39;t said for a while, and I repeated some stories  <br/>
in that other talk.  Some people (Diana Jenner, especially) swear by  <br/>
that recorded session, but few people are easily capable of listening  <br/>
to cassette tapes anymore, and it&#39;s not on CD.  The new one will be  <br/>
on CD.  So I&#39;m not planning to order more copies of the Peaceful  <br/>
Parenting after these last ones are sold.   I have about fifteen.   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tapes">http://sandradodd.com/tapes</a><br/>
I could use some money, too, so anyone feeling the need for other  <br/>
forms of input, if you buy something I have a better chance of paying  <br/>
off the print bill for the second printing of Moving a Puddle.   <br/>
Charge card bill came.  $1200 for books, and we brought in $405 at  <br/>
the conference even counting used tie-dyed t-shirts @$5. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But wait, that wasn&#39;t the question...<br/>
<br/>
I think lately there&#39;s been lots of analytical talk about what helps  <br/>
and what doesn&#39;t, and also that people go through levels of  <br/>
understanding and receptiveness, and some things that are there won&#39;t  <br/>
make sense to some people.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce and I were mysteriously criticized two years ago (behind our  <br/>
backs, on some other list) for having taught advanced unschooling.   <br/>
First, we didn&#39;t.  Or she didn&#39;t.  But why the criticism?   The first  <br/>
and second Live and Learn conferences had lots of talks to appeal to  <br/>
beginners.  Turns out, though, there were few beginners there.  So  <br/>
for the Peabody/Boston conference,  we were asked to do things  <br/>
experienced unschoolers could use.  I had planned three talks-- <br/>
beginning, intermediate and advanced.  It was really more like a  <br/>
three part talk.  Or would&#39;ve been, but one of my spots was given to  <br/>
someone else, so I combined the intermediate into the other two and  <br/>
it wasn&#39;t as clearly done.<br/>
<br/>
A few people (the same small few who squawk periodically, whose  <br/>
squawking has caused other problems in the past, such as the closing  <br/>
of the unschooling.com message boards) seem to want others to think  <br/>
there is no such thing as advanced unschooling, that unschooling is  <br/>
easy to understand, just don&#39;t use a curriculum, that&#39;s all, no more,  <br/>
there are no experts, there&#39;s nothing to know, and no one can tell  <br/>
you you can&#39;t do it or that you could do it better.  WHY they would  <br/>
want others to think that I don&#39;t know, unless they like to think  <br/>
they know as much about it as anyone, as much as anyone possibly could.<br/>
<br/>
Me, though, I&#39;ve seen people do it for a few years and get stuck or  <br/>
back out, because there were things they hadn&#39;t thought of, or they  <br/>
had bought into some claim that it was fine for little kids but not  <br/>
older kids.  I&#39;ve seen people try it and fail because the  <br/>
organization of their home was more important than learning, and they  <br/>
really NEEDED (they felt) to have the kids in school so they could  <br/>
clean the house every day without kids around.<br/>
<br/>
The process of knowing WHY one is unschooling is part of  <br/>
unschooling.  The first simple &quot;She hates school&quot; won&#39;t serve to  <br/>
support and  maintain ten years of parental involvement.  New motives  <br/>
and underpinnings need to be seen and embraced all along the way.<br/>

If there weren&#39;t a google of messages on this list, I would go back<br/>
and re-read them all. :) I may still go back and read some old ones<br/>
just to see if I see them differently now. :)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well yahoo has changed their site and you can now search the message  <br/>
archives pretty decently!<br/>
<br/>
And if you get the list by e-mail there&#39;s a link at the bottom of  <br/>
each now that will take you straight to the archives.  I just went  <br/>
and put in the word &quot;specifics&quot; and got 38 returns, back to 2001, and  <br/>
each had three lines of text so you could see the word in the midst  <br/>
of that to see if it was worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
Then (this is SO COOL) I clicked on one, Kids and Spirituality, and  <br/>
it brought up that post, and beneath it, the whole thread in which it  <br/>
appeared.  Perfect, huh?<br/>
<br/>
So you can read old stuff without having to dig through too much riff  <br/>
raff.<br/>

There but for the want of an &#39;s&#39; :)  (sorry about the googol <br/>
misspelling!  I am a google addict and it has become my favorite <br/>
site in the world!). Wikipedia is up there, though.<br/>
<br/>
Those lists do help, thanks!  I had seen them before, but I see I <br/>
needed reminding!  <br/>
<br/>
When Richie first asked at age 4, &quot;Why can&#39;t I stay home and you <br/>
teach me?&quot;, I just grinded mentally to a halt because I had no <br/>
reason to say no and yet no direction or even any idea of a <br/>
direction. I had simply never thought of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I found unschooling so soon after that.  It took a while to <br/>
grasp, but it was basically what was left after eliminating all the <br/>
options that didn&#39;t make sense.  I still have those first few weeks <br/>
of columns and rows for tracking each &#39;subject&#39; in each week.  Yet, <br/>
as I kept looking at the state standards, and just watched my son as <br/>
I kept researching all the options out there, curriculums (and even <br/>
tracking by subject) seemed rather basic and arbitrary and I started <br/>
wondering why I even needed one. Once that was settled, it just made <br/>
radical unschooling the next logical step and that is the journey we <br/>
are on.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, to me, your site and Joyce&#39;s combined are a most powerful <br/>
source of information.  I love Joyce&#39;s lists on each side and yours <br/>
on the left because I can so easily see the topics that interest me <br/>
the most.  I do have to remember to keep going back, but the <br/>
discussion lists are taking all my time!  <br/>
<br/>
It all helps!  No magic answers! :) Too bad, but just thinking of RU <br/>
as a process and a goal rather than a product is a very large, <br/>
helpful step for both my thinking and will help my explaining it to <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
RU as a parenting style is easier for me to describe and work with <br/>
than &#39;unschooling&#39; as a &#39;curriculum/philosophy&#39; as it falls in many <br/>
homeschooling groups.  To compare unschooling to other homeschooling <br/>
curriclums seems backwards.  I see more similariy between RU and NVC <br/>
than I do between unschooling and any other homeschooling <br/>
philosophy.  There are too many unspoken, assumed parenting pardigms <br/>
in any other homeschool method.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ah.  NVC gags me.  I&#39;ve tried a few times to read some more <br/>
&gt; because  people I like and respect can really get into that, but <br/>
&gt; every time I try it gags me again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can see that. :)  My husband feels the same way.  It&#39;s a tool that <br/>
works for me and it helps me to just do three steps in the way that <br/>
I perceive NVC:<br/>
<br/>
1. Identify my feelings. (this is tough for me)<br/>
2. Identify and verbalize my specific request from someone else.<br/>
3. Accept their response and self-soothe if necessary. (like if I <br/>
don&#39;t get what I want).<br/>
<br/>
I REALLY didn&#39;t like one NVC faciliator&#39;s answer when I asked what <br/>
if you can&#39;t get your needs met.<br/>
<br/>
She said, &#39;then you mourn the death of that need&#39;<br/>
<br/>
That stinks!  But the reality is that you can&#39;t make other people do <br/>
what you want without compromising the relationship and that where I <br/>
see the similarity of NVC to Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
To &#39;mourn the death of that need&#39; is to accept that the need IS <br/>
important to ME, but perhaps NOT important to others and that <br/>
doesn&#39;t make me or them bad or good, just different.  To &#39;mourn the  <br/>
death of that need&#39; is to acknowledge that the need is important to <br/>
me, but that I just can&#39;t get it met and rather than to get angry, <br/>
revengeful or other things I don&#39;t want to be, I can accept and <br/>
grieve, then let go and move on.<br/>
<br/>
NVC&#39;s purpose is to build connections between people, NOT to get <br/>
what you want at any costs.  It&#39;s not always an appropriate tool to <br/>
use in every situation, but it is working well for me in our family <br/>
situation.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That was someone else&#39;s quote, referring to &quot;What the bleep do we  <br/>
&gt; know,&quot; a source that also gags me.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I almost wrote &#39;someone&#39; but I had been reading too many <br/>
messages and thought I remembered correctly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but they need to consciously and  <br/>
&gt; mindfully and logically CHOOSE what to do in the second.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES!  But this is what I took out of the conversation and also that <br/>
to continually choose in a different direction is to change your <br/>
mind and your attitude.  It takes time, but it does work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some people see choice as some kind of &quot;what do you want to be <br/>
&gt; when  you grown up&quot; one single big choice.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, luckily I&#39;ve been lots of things and I do see even that as a <br/>
continuum, but I also have gotten stuck in the idea that there may <br/>
be only one path to something, but that is just something I have to <br/>
keep reminding myself is not true. <br/>
<br/>
Even if we are all going to the top of the same mountain, we may be <br/>
all taking different routes!<br/>
<br/>
Scary that your thoughts of should I do this or that are remarkably <br/>
like mine. :)  My husband said he would get tired if he thought that <br/>
much all the time!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Flexibility and awareness are valuable to me.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yah, I agree, but as in your example of the squire, you can&#39;t be <br/>
flexible in a situation if you don&#39;t even know what accepted <br/>
behavior is. :)<br/>
<br/>
We went to the Estrella War last year.  It was interesting to see <br/>
the different activities, like the blacksmithing and bread making <br/>
and so on, but I would never put on an outfit there without feeling <br/>
WAY comfortable that I knew the unspoken rules.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about that, that is a lot of how I feel in unschooling.  <br/>
There are unspoken rules and even many people may disagree on a <br/>
certain decision or path.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for a checklist per se, just more of a philosophical <br/>
approach to the ideal unschooling life. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If unschooling is the goal...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, but then how would &#39;unschooling&#39; be defined. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Flexibility.  Broadness of base.  Expansion of scope, not narrow-<br/>
&gt; beam  vision.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not where I am coming from.  For instance, for me, the &#39;goal&#39; of <br/>
unschooling or RU in our house is happy children, happy family.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see &#39;unschooling&#39; itself as a goal. I can only see it as a <br/>
process to getting to a different goal, such as producing happy, <br/>
confident, comfortable people.  :)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where I think I was having my problem.  <br/>
<br/>
When you say &#39;unschooling is the goal&#39; then it seems you are <br/>
treating it as a product and not a process.  I think we agree that <br/>
it&#39;s a process and so maybe it&#39;s just the terminology or use of the <br/>
word that is confusing to me.<br/>
<br/>
I already bought a copy of your Peaceful Parenting tape.  :)  I&#39;m <br/>
going to use Richie&#39;s Kareoke machine to listen to it. :)<br/>
<br/>
I did listen to Big Noisy Peace and it was interesting, but I&#39;m <br/>
thinking I will get more out of the Peaceful Parenting tape, <br/>
although for me, I prefer to read, so edited transcripts, websites <br/>
and books are my favorite. :)  I did already buy Moving a Puddle <br/>
before you ask! :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people go through levels of  <br/>
&gt; understanding and receptiveness, and some things that are there<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t make sense to some people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we all have ways that things make sense to us. :)  When I do <br/>
computer training, I often have to explain something two or three <br/>
ways until I see that click of comprehension in someone&#39;s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too bad there&#39;s no faster, better way to get it, but there we <br/>
go.  All being human, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>

your website?  It would be interesting to me to hear your shifting <br/>
movties and underpinnings throughout the years...<br/>
<br/>
I am very happy with my purpose of growing happy, confident kids, <br/>
but I&#39;m always interested to hear what other purposes and goals may <br/>
be out there on the unschooling road. :)<br/>

Its funny how one can read something on this list (or another one), <br/>
and it not sink in at the time, and then a year or two or more <br/>
later, one can &quot;get it.&quot; Awhile back, it was noted somewhere <br/>
(mightve been UD, or unschooling.com or here)that its not a great <br/>
idea to re-hash school wounds, to talk and talk about how hard and <br/>
horrible school was for either us as parents or our children. That <br/>
while it can be cathartic in the beginning, it doesnt really move <br/>
someone closer to the peace of unschooling. At the time, i think i <br/>
felt a little defensive about it. I felt that one shouldnt <br/>
be &quot;hushed&quot; about their real experiences with school. <br/>
<br/>
But lately, talking about my son&#39;s negative school experiences <br/>
doesnt feel right to me. I posted on another list about meeting <br/>
another HSing family on the train back from Albuquerque. I had lunch <br/>
with the mom during our layover in Chicago. Practically the first <br/>
thing out of her mouth was her son&#39;s entire negative elementary <br/>
school experience (including being put in special ed)...The son <br/>
(almost 16 yrs)looked pretty mortified about it. I also had talked <br/>
during the conference, and on the train to another unschooler, about <br/>
some things that had happened to my son during kindergarten. But <br/>
i&#39;ve found that lately, i want to focus on what&#39;s good about our <br/>
lives, what brings us happiness, our passions, and not on the <br/>
behavior of some crappy school teacher three years ago. I&#39;m hoping <br/>
that by the time *my* son is 16, i won&#39;t even remember his bad K <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, for us, has become more a positive way of being in the <br/>
present and not a reaction to the negative experiences in the past.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56286887">You ask why I compare and then you compare. :)  I do it for the same <br/>
reason you do - for understanding, for a path that works for me.<br/>
<br/>
I never learned about Attachment Parenting nor Open Classroom until <br/>
AFTER I learned about unschooling.  I didn&#39;t travel those paths so <br/>
they don&#39;t mean much to me.<br/>
<br/>
My intent was to observe that NVC and RU generally have similar <br/>
goals as I see it.  Which is what I hear you saying about AP and OC <br/>
if I understand correctly.  Same mountain, different trail to <br/>
understanding!<br/>
<br/>
NVC helps me on my path by giving me tools that help me to be the <br/>
best for my kids.  I hope it will help someone else, but surely I <br/>
don&#39;t expect everyone (or even anyone) to follow my path.  It is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318336354">-=-You ask why I compare and then you compare. :) I do it for the same<br/>
reason you do - for understanding, for a path that works for me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I never learned about Attachment Parenting nor Open Classroom until<br/>
AFTER I learned about unschooling. I didn&#39;t travel those paths so<br/>
they don&#39;t mean much to me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It seemed your comparison was a stretch, and mine were related,  <br/>
that&#39;s why.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My intent was to observe that NVC and RU generally have similar<br/>
goals as I see it. Which is what I hear you saying about AP and OC<br/>
if I understand correctly. Same mountain, different trail to<br/>
understanding!-=-<br/>
<br/>
What mountain?<br/>
NVC is about personal relations, isn&#39;t it?  It&#39;s like a way for  <br/>
people who aren&#39;t naturally aware (&quot;intrapersonal intelligence&quot;?) to  <br/>
find a way to communicate?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen NVC used as a club, personally.  I&#39;ve seen it used to tell  <br/>
others that they&#39;re using jackal language (or whatever), to criticize  <br/>
them for not having GUESSED how the NVC people think others should  <br/>
communicate.  It seems to me to be making up rules to use in an  <br/>
environment in which there are already traditions and courtesies in  <br/>
place.   Unless everyone in a family, or a club, or a church, or a  <br/>
neighborhood, agrees that they will ALL &quot;be NVC&quot; then those who don&#39;t  <br/>
learn those dialogs are considered to be rude, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t expect everyone (or even anyone) to follow my path.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does it work if only one person is doing it?  Can it be a solo pursuit?<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it&#39;s only communication.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling involves all aspects of life, not just communication.<br/>
Attachment parenting involves touch, sleep, eating, being.<br/>
Open classroom involves every method of gathering information and   <br/>
touching and understanding and discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see unschooling as a way to communicate.<br/>
<br/>
Probably I&#39;m misunderstanding NVC, but it seems to be a narrow-focus  <br/>
tool, and more a set of rules than a process.<br/>

two until I finally saw it from a different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Seems healthier to say  &quot;some &#39;needs&#39; were fleeting ideas and <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, sounds like my initial thoughts, and I do agree that &#39;some&#39; <br/>
needs ARE fleeting, but others are not, so the difference between <br/>
the two responses would be that the first acknowledges that your <br/>
need is important where as your and my initial response is one of <br/>
dismissiveness.  If that works for you, okay, but for me, that would <br/>
make me angry and I can&#39;t just &#39;let go&#39; of things that are important <br/>
to me, so to let something go by acknowleging that it IS important, <br/>
lets me self-parent and self-soothe even if no one else can do that <br/>
for me.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Going around telling people what one needs seems extremely... <br/>
&gt; NEEDY.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Certainly, nothing about NVC suggests you should tell everyone ALL <br/>
of your needs.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, the important part is when something IS a need, that you <br/>
should recognize it internally and clearly articulate your request <br/>
rather than assume others will understand.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I use my modified three steps. I don&#39;t need to rehash.  <br/>
Do you have this need? :)<br/>
<br/>
Other important points for me are to avoid anger, blame, shame, etc. <br/>
and taking responsibility internally for things that are my needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The other day one of the teens at the conference came up and said  <br/>

her request.  It would have been easy for you to decide to help her <br/>
meet her need or not.<br/>

should have used the word tool.  I would say that NVC is more in the <br/>
line of ACOA.  Would that make sense to you?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What mountain?<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; NVC is about personal relations, isn&#39;t it?  It&#39;s like a way for  <br/>
&gt; people who aren&#39;t naturally aware (&quot;intrapersonal intelligence&quot;?) <br/>
&gt; to  find a way to communicate?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have to say that communication isn&#39;t &#39;natural&#39; but instead <br/>
is &#39;learned&#39; as you seemed to refer to below when you said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It seems to me to be making up rules to use in an environment in <br/>
which there are already traditions and courtesies in place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the traditions and courtesies (sets of rules) don&#39;t always <br/>
work the same everywhere.  I was trained not to trust myself.  I&#39;ve <br/>
had to relearn that.  When I said I wanted x or y, I was told I <br/>
didn&#39;t want that, I wanted z. So for me, just to identify what <br/>
exactly I DO want is work and then to communicate it directly (as <br/>
you westerners do) instead of the eastern passive-agressive mode <br/>
(southerns are more direct than mid-atlantic and north!) was a great <br/>
stretch for me.<br/>
<br/>
NVC helps me be clear, direct and not attacking, belittling or <br/>
underhanded, all communication techniques designed to get someone <br/>
what they want, not designed to build relationships.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve seen NVC used as a club, personally.  I&#39;ve seen it used to <br/>

&gt; then those who don&#39;t learn those dialogs are considered to be <br/>
&gt; rude, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly wouldn&#39;t apply it that way, but I could see that other <br/>
people will.  People can use anything as a weapon, even NVC.<br/>
<br/>
Religion has certainly made an excellent weapon over the years.  <br/>
Preaching tolerance and being intolerant.  Preaching acceptance and <br/>
not accepting.  That doesn&#39;t mean the concepts are wrong, just that <br/>
the people applying them have cruel or mean motives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does it work if only one person is doing it?  Can it be a solo <br/>
&gt; pursuit?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I thought I had explained that, but perhaps not clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Viewing the world through a lens that sees every person&#39;s actions as <br/>
a reflection of their own needs can let one be more sensitive and <br/>
tolerant of others.<br/>
<br/>
NVC can be practiced alone in helping one determine how &#39;best&#39; to <br/>
communicate with others.  NVC is simply another tool in the box.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All in all, it&#39;s only communication.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is pretty important.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling involves all aspects of life, not just communication.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, just a tool on the path.  Of course it&#39;s not the same thing, <br/>
but a tool to help one achieve unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t see unschooling as a way to communicate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But what I was saying (and of course I am still learning and <br/>
assimilating) is that how you communicate is very important in being <br/>
successful at unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Communication comes up quite often in all the unschooling convos I <br/>
see.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Probably I&#39;m misunderstanding NVC, but it seems to be a narrow-<br/>
&gt; focus tool, and more a set of rules than a process.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you&#39;re right.  I see what you&#39;re saying here.  Remember, I&#39;m <br/>
literal, so it might take me a bit to get anything that is <br/>
assumed. :)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see the AP and OC as being a process since I am not very <br/>
familiar with them, but now I see what you were getting at before.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the dialog.  It helps me suss out even more nuances. :)<br/>

parents who are wanting to begin unschooling), but I really do  <br/>

and it isn&#39;t entirely a joke. I see how there are steps that people  <br/>

through some of those early steps in a more linear manner. I&#39;m  <br/>
considering really creating a workbook-style &quot;How to Unschool&quot; book.<br/>
<br/>
Joining the unschooling lists is like jumping into a flowing stream -  <br/>
sometimes the flow is gentle and people might float along for a while  <br/>
and pretty soon they start swimming along; others start swimming  <br/>
along right away. But sometimes joining the lists feels like diving  <br/>
into a river with lots of white-water rapids - people feel like  <br/>
they&#39;re bashing into rocks and it all sounds out of control and wild  <br/>
and very scary. Some of this is a function of what happens to be  <br/>
happening on the lists at the time the person joins, and some of it  <br/>
is the nature of the person, not the lists. There are also people who  <br/>
jump in and struggle against the flow and thrash around and make  <br/>
things harder for people to swim, and there are a very few people who  <br/>
actually join in order throw rocks at us while we&#39;re swimming.<br/>

It IS a process.  Learning it is a process, and it&#39;s a process that  <br/>
one&#39;s learning.  For people who only like product, unschooling isn&#39;t  <br/>
going to become &quot;product.&quot;<br/>

me, like it would come between a parent and child, rather than  <br/>
enhance a deep and authentic relationship between them.<br/>

I do understand that it is not the goal of NVC for people to do this  <br/>
- that the idea is to take the principles and make them your own, to  <br/>
be able to express yourself in your own unique way. But that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
seem to pan out - even the emails I get, occasionally, from long-time  <br/>
NVCers, all follow such a predictable script-like pattern, that I  <br/>
tend to disregard all the &quot;observations, feelings, needs, and  <br/>
requests&quot; because they don&#39;t seem, somehow, &quot;real.&quot;<br/>
