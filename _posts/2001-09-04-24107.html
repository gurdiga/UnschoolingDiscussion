<div id="ygrps-yiv-888778400">Hi Annette and All:<br/>
<br/>
My 6 year old Zak is scared of Smoke Detectors and has been since before he <br/>
knew what one was.  We even had to take the one in his room out because he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go to sleep.  Often he wakes up and comes and sleeps in our bed <br/>
because he&#39;s having a nightmare about the smoke detector.  When we go to <br/>
people&#39;s houses or he&#39;s been to different pre-schools he goes and checks <br/>
where all the smoke detectors are.  <br/>
<br/>
You would think he&#39;d been exposed to one going off or being in a fire but <br/>
no.... So we love him and nuture him and allow him to be fearful of something <br/>
that we can&#39;t quite fathom, hoping that he&#39;ll grow out of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Zak is now showing his baby brother (Max, 2 in a couple of weeks) where all <br/>
the smoke detectors are in the house and Max looks at them as well... I just <br/>
hope he&#39;s not going to be scared of them.<br/>
<br/>
Then, because of what I do for a living, I wonder if Zak is having a <br/>
premonition of a fire that&#39;s going to affect us....I guess we&#39;ll have to wait <br/>
and see... I check all my electrical stuff before we go to bed, just in case <br/>
he knows something that I don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345886935">Also Dawn. . . have you read any of Sylvia Browne&#39;s books? She talks about <br/>
cell memory from past lives and this could be something to explore. I am <br/>
reading some of her stuff now and find it fascinating! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250551800">Dawn,<br/>
Maybe Zak thinks the smoke detectors can CAUSE a fire.  Maybe he doesn&#39;t<br/>
really understand that they only help to warn you if a fire starts some<br/>
other way.  I used to think the trees made the wind  ( ok, so maybe I<br/>
wasn&#39;t so bright ! ) because I&#39;d see and hear the trees rustle first,<br/>
then feel the wind.  It&#39;s easy to get things turned around sometimes.<br/>
Some people refer to them as fire alarms or fire detectors, that&#39;s pretty<br/>
scary.<br/>

<br/>
Good thought!  Sprinkler systems sprinkle water, and they LOOK like <br/>
sprinklers, usually.  Smoke detectors sometimes have a little red light on <br/>
them, and that looks like fire.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875388698">Youngest kidlet had a completely to the point of hysterical fear of vacuum<br/>
cleaners for years!  We never could figure out why, nor could she tell us.<br/>
<br/>
No. 3 son has a fear of heights, now and it took us years to figure that one<br/>
out.  When he was just a little guy he used to climb up the stone bbq and<br/>
then walk along the top 2x4 on our 6 foot fence.  Climbed trees and we have<br/>
really TALL trees out here!  Absolutely fearless.  Then one day we couldn&#39;t<br/>
get him to climb to the second floor of the house.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it turns out he half fell through some stairs at his uncle&#39;s house.<br/>
They had stairs to the second floor that are open, just steps on railings.<br/>
but it took forever, years to be exact, to get the reason out of him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59202014">I was also concerned about why one of my sons seemed overly fearful <br/>
of some things.  His pediatrician told me that children&#39;s &#39;irrational <br/>
fears&#39; are very real to them and we should always acknowledge them <br/>
and try to help a child to talk about their fears when they can. He <br/>
also suggested that because my son was very intelligent he had a <br/>
knowledge base that exceeded his emotional maturity.   i.e. He had <br/>
the normal fears of a young child his chronological age, but a much <br/>
older child&#39;s view of the world and therefore more things to worry <br/>
about.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember one incident when my son was three. I was called to come <br/>
to his preschool.  He was crying and very upset.  He was normally a <br/>
happy, even-mannered little guy.  The staff couldn&#39;t get him to <br/>
explain and they were greatly concerned that something had happened <br/>
to him.  When I got there and had calmed him down he told me that he <br/>
was afraid he was going to die.  He said they had had pizza for lunch <br/>
and it was kind of greasy.  He explained to us that he was afraid he <br/>
was &quot;going to die of high cholesterol intake. You know, the build-up <br/>
of fatty tissue in your arteries.&quot;  (This kid spoke in full sentences <br/>
at age ten months.  He would often use big words and then add a <br/>
definition.  I think he wanted to make sure &quot;I&quot; knew these words &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
The preschool teacher and director sat there with their mouths open <br/>
while I explained that this was not generally a problem for kids his <br/>
age and that his overall good diet was not going to be compromised by <br/>
one piece of greasy pizza.  He had apparently been listening in on a <br/>
TV program on health issues I had been watching the night before and <br/>
was &quot;re-thinking&quot; (his term) about this program just before nap time. <br/>
That evening we had a long talk about what he could do whenever he <br/>
was &quot;re-thinking&quot; about something and it got scary.<br/>
<br/>
Over time we&#39;ve had lots of conversations about &quot;re-thinking&quot; about <br/>
things.<br/>
