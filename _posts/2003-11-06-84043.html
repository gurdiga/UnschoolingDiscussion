&lt;&lt; The last book of the New Testament written was Revelations. There is <br/>
<br/>
evidence in the Early Fathers (Origen, Justinian ??? help. Not <br/>
<br/>
exactly sure of the names)...that this book was written before 70 <br/>
<br/>
A.D. These Early Fathers are documented to have written before that <br/>
<br/>
date, and they quote Revelations...The first epistle written was from <br/>
<br/>
Paul to Timothy. If I remember rightly, it was written by about 50 <br/>
<br/>
A.D. but I don&#39;t know the source on that one. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The question isn&#39;t when they were written, but what was the date of those <br/>
used in the &quot;codification&quot; (which still didn&#39;t settle it, and the list of books <br/>
stayed/stays in flux).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The DaVinci Code came across as &quot;The early followers of Jesus loved <br/>
<br/>
him alot, but didn&#39;t believe he was resurrected nor that he was <br/>
<br/>
deity. The Council of Nicea made it up and voted on it.&quot; That is <br/>
<br/>
bogus. The first Christians believed in the resurrection of Jesus <br/>
<br/>
Christ and spread that news with fervor and boldness.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
According to books which were copied from books which were already aged <br/>
copies when the Catholics who voted got ahold of them?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-The Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hadn&#39;t heard that!  Do you have a reference?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hadn&#39;t heard about the alleged Puritan attempt to rename the days of the week.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You hadn&#39;t HEARD that Sunday was named for the Sun? Really...Monday <br/>
<br/>
for the Moon? It&#39;s pretty common knowledge. Dunno where I first heard <br/>
<br/>
it. Some time, as a child, I imagine.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I knew all that.<br/>
<br/>
Did you answer the wrong question on purpose!?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sunday=Lord&#39;s Day; Monday=First Day; Tuesday=Second Day; Oden&#39;s Day ;)<br/>
<br/>
=midweek; Thursday=Fourth day??? Friday=fifth day, I suppose. <br/>
<br/>
Saturday=Sabbath. I got THIS from historical fiction LOL &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;since the other weekdays are named after gods, where do YOU suppose <br/>
<br/>
the names Sunday and Monday came from? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those religions all grew out of sky- and light-worshipping religions.  So did <br/>
Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; What&#39;s being discussed here as Christian holidays and pagan <br/>
<br/>
holidays is <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dealing just with England/English/American stuff.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;So, the Roman Catholic church didn&#39;t have Hallowe&#39;en in England?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was a church holiday, as with ALL the church calendar dates--tons of <br/>
Saints&#39; Days.   The church holidy had nothing to do with scary graveyard  &quot;ooooh&quot; <br/>
candles in turnips stuff, but it was in the same season, so already existing <br/>
traditions were set on the same day every year, which was named by the church <br/>
calendar.<br/>
<br/>
Hallowe&#39;en is All Hallow&#39;s Eve(ning).  <br/>
Like Christmas Eve is Christmas Eve.<br/>
<br/>
Used to be a day started at sundown the day before.  The day ended at dark, <br/>
not at midnight.  So the evening of one&#39;s birthday was the eve of one&#39;s <br/>
birthday, the night before.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;e&#39;en&quot; which has pretty much dropped its apostrophe (still required in <br/>
spelling bees in the 1960&#39;s) is short for evening, abbreviated to the way it was <br/>
pronunced when the spelling settled.<br/>
<br/>
Ireland was Catholic, and is, but there were still some local things that <br/>
people did which the church adapted instead of banning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For some of it at least, the traditions began <br/>
<br/>
after Christianity came to an area...not already there and made into <br/>
<br/>
Christian holidays by the church...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even so, it wouldn&#39;t mean the church made the decisions or that they were <br/>
celebrating something churchish.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s traditional in northern New Mexico to make biscochitos at Christmas.  <br/>
They&#39;re anise-seed cookies made with brandy.  They have nothing to do with <br/>
religion, but they&#39;re always there at Christmas dinners and Christmas sales and <br/>
such.  There are lots of things like that.  Luminarias and little fires on <br/>
Christmas eve.  There&#39;s an adaptation of a local Indian tradition to build <br/>
cross-piece pyres of split cedar, two sticks one way, two the other, and so on, about <br/>
two feet high.  They&#39;re lit at dark on Christmas Eve.  I think it was done <br/>
before the Catholics came, and since it was done on the darkest night, they <br/>
attached it to Christmas and justified it (blessed it, kind of) that way.  It&#39;s <br/>
still done.   We lived across the Rio Grande from Santa Clara Pueblo, and on <br/>
Christmas Eve if it was still there would be dozens of straight-up plumes of black <br/>
smoke all at once.  It looked COOL.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Christmas tradition, but it isn&#39;t &quot;Christian in origin.&quot;<br/>

*************************************<br/>
Here&#39;s another simplified version:  Ireland was under the thumb of England <br/>
for hundreds of years.  The Irish people were forever trying to get their <br/>
country back, and all the English out, warring constantly.  There was finally a sort <br/>
of truce/decision made in (I believe?) the 1940&#39;s, in which most of the <br/>
country would no longer be ruled by England, but in turn part of Northern Ireland <br/>
(Ulster) would remain under England&#39;s rule, part of the United Kingdom.  It was <br/>
a bittersweet victory for the Irish, because although they were happy to get <br/>
the majority of their country back, England still had a piece of it, and the <br/>
Irish people (mostly Catholic) want the WHOLE country back and the English <br/>
(mostly Protestants) OUT.  That is why the warring is centered on Ulster and <br/>
mostly, Belfast.  It is a religious war, a race war, a poor against the rich <br/>
war...As long as England holds a piece of Ireland as theirs, it will probably be a <br/>
never ending war.  Each year in Belfast the English/Irish Protestants hold an <br/>
&quot;Orange&quot; parade.  And every year, there&#39;s usually another battle sparked by it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92327457">If a humble observer may interject...<br/>
<br/>
The Irish thing has been going on for hundreds of years. As a colonial <br/>
power, England ruled Ireland much worse than it ever did Scotland. James I <br/>
(came to the throne after Elizabeth I) was actually a Scottish King prior <br/>
to coming to England, so he united the two for the first time under common <br/>
rule.<br/>
<br/>
Ireland never had the rights or the political or intellectual power that <br/>
the Scots had. But, the Irish protestants were far more palatable to the <br/>
Anglican English than the Catholics, and they used this position to try to <br/>
gain more power. The protestants were wealthier, held more land, and were <br/>
always the ones who had power in the few times England allowed Ireland to <br/>
practice some self-rule. Once England went protestant (James&#39;s rule was <br/>
never neat because he was Catholic, which is what caused such problems when <br/>
his heir Charles I took over; Cromwell and the Puritans ousted him, <br/>
Catholic France tried to help him, yadda, yadda). Religion in Europe is as <br/>
political as theological, historically speaking anyway.<br/>
<br/>
This is the long-winded way of saying that the Protestants sided with <br/>
England in order to gain power, and England accepted them because they were <br/>
Protestant. Catholics have always been second-class citizens, not allowed <br/>
to hold political office, etc. Irish Catholics viewed the Protestants as <br/>
internal colonizers who were just as bad as the English.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say that the main discrepancy about what books are in the <br/>
canon is between having the apocrypha or not. Books like The Gospel <br/>
of Thomas and others have long been eliminated from contending. As <br/>
far as I know, even high critics don&#39;t put much weight on the <br/>
peripheral books that never were in the running...<br/>
<br/>
The books that &quot;made it,&quot; even though the canon may have been <br/>
solidified in ??? date, were part of the literature of the early <br/>
Church from the beginning. The Gospel of John has original fragments <br/>
that date back to the 1st century, within the lifetime of John <br/>
himself. The Gnostic Gospels OLDEST documents date to the 3rd <br/>
century. If there&#39;s a discrepancy between documents about Jesus&#39; <br/>
life, and one of the documents is older...the older document is <br/>
trusted over the newer one. That&#39;s how it is with all ancient <br/>
writings. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;The DaVinci Code came across as &quot;The early followers of Jesus <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; deity. The Council of Nicea made it up and voted on it.&quot; That is <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; bogus. The first Christians believed in the resurrection of Jesus <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Christ and spread that news with fervor and boldness.&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>aged <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; copies when the Catholics who voted got ahold of them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One little fact we must keep in mind: the copies of Biblical <br/>
documents, though there are scads of them, have little to NO <br/>
differences between them. When there is a difference, it will be in <br/>
something like a marginal note, never in major doctrines and <br/>
teachings. IOW, that 1st century fragment of John&#39;s Gospel reads just <br/>
exactly like one from the 5th century, and ancient church copies from <br/>
the 12th century as well, show no errors of any magnitude. The words <br/>
of the Bible were copied with great care by people who loved them. <br/>
Any objective scholar will acknowledge that Biblical documentation is <br/>
among the best, if not THE best, in existence.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. I was raised in the South of Ireland. The problem is the people in <br/>
northern Ireland are just as &#39;Irish&#39; as the people in southern Ireland. <br/>
Most of them are actually decsended from the original inhabitants as <br/>
well as the scots and English immigrants from the 1500&#39;s and 1600&#39;s. And <br/>
the southern Irish have a mixed descent from original, Norse, English, <br/>
scots etc etc.<br/>
But the grudge continues adn the southern Irish refer to those in Ulster <br/>
as &#39;English&#39; when they ain&#39;t.<br/>
It would be like the English getting narky about anyone of Norman, <br/>
Saxon, Norse, Roman, Angles etc descent and wanting them to leave <br/>
England. The Protestants of Ulster want their country to remain <br/>
independant of Eire and those in Eire want the country to be one. Both <br/>
are worried about the religion of the other despite the fact that they <br/>
are all meant to be Christians and &#39;love thy neighbour&#39;. When I lived in <br/>
Dublin (raised Catholic) some of the preists would be preaching that <br/>
Protestants would *make* the catholics have abortions and use condoms. <br/>
During a brief stay in Belfast I found people saying that the catholics <br/>
would ban contraception and outbreed them.<br/>
I&#39;d ban religion for starters....<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would say that the main discrepancy about what books are in the <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a modern view.  A historical view needs to see things all along the <br/>
way.  There are many Bible-worshipping protestants (Baptist and thereabout) who <br/>
have no idea there are other books in the Catholic Bible, or how they got in, <br/>
or why they got out.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any objective scholar will acknowledge that Biblical documentation is <br/>
<br/>
among the best, if not THE best, in existence.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A scholar who raises a question will show he&#39;s not objective?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Okay, but my point was to try and refute the notion which is widely <br/>
<br/>
taught, that &quot;all holidays celebrated originally by the Catholic <br/>
<br/>
church have their origins in pagan traditions.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I think people mean when they say that is that the holidays celebrated <br/>
in the United States have pagan origins concerning the traditions with which <br/>
they are celebrated.  And the only generally &quot;celebrated religious holidays&quot; <br/>
here outside Thanksgiving and 4th of July are Christmas and Easter.   Valentine&#39;s <br/>
Day was a medieval Saint&#39;s Day (most days were, and still are in the Catholic <br/>
church and for purposes of baby-naming and the particulars of the daily <br/>
mass), and Hallowe&#39;en, but the traditions don&#39;t have to do with church or Jesus, <br/>
and they&#39;re not considered &quot;religious holidays&quot; in the U.S.  New Year&#39;s Eve has <br/>
nothing but drinking, and kissing at midnight.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at all the history of religion through a 2003 American Protestant <br/>
lens is too distorting.  It&#39;s not at all objective.<br/>

Well, technically contraception has already been banned by the Catholic <br/>
Church from the time dependable contraception came into being.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is something I heard white Americans saying about Mexican <br/>
immigrants while living in CA.  That CA will be taken over by Mexicans because they&#39;re <br/>
all Catholic and they don&#39;t use contraception.<br/>

This always cracks me up, considering California WAS Mexico.  We have to use <br/>
the term *Californiano* in dh&#39;s family instead of Mexican ~ to remind others <br/>

If you wanted to find out about Grant&#39;s life, would you rather read a <br/>
biography written today by a historian who researched Grant&#39;s life, <br/>
or would you read Grant&#39;s memoirs?<br/>
<br/>
BUT! what if something came to light that claimed to be a portion of <br/>
Grant&#39;s memoirs that had never been seen before, but mentions things <br/>
that dispute all other primary sources? Would the historian trust the <br/>
newer stuff that goes against all other sources, including the <br/>
memoirs from the pen of the man, or would he let the newer stuff go <br/>
as not reliable? <br/>
<br/>
What if Grant never wrote anything? Maybe someone close to him, who <br/>
saw what happened, would be a reliable primary source? If a newer <br/>
biography on Grant were published, and the historian cited sources <br/>
that have been deemed unreliable by authoritative Grant scholars? <br/>
What if the new biography mentions many events that are nowhere else <br/>
mentioned? Do you believe the new biography if it doesn&#39;t check out <br/>
with sources closer to the actual man? <br/>
<br/>
IMO, the older documents (closer to the source) are going to be <br/>
closer to the true events, and thus more trustworthy.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, I think I get that now. :&#92; I think. But there still is a panic <br/>
in evangelicaldom about following practices that originate in pagan <br/>
tradition. They don&#39;t want to do things that are not commanded nor <br/>
recommended in the Bible, but it is a misguided attempt at Christian <br/>
living, IMO. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And the only generally &quot;celebrated religious holidays&quot; <br/>

<br/>
Well, T&#39;giving is a religious feast day, in that giving thanks to God <br/>
was part of the intent of The First Thanksgiving, but it is also <br/>
American, not Catholic, in origin. Goes to show, the puritans weren&#39;t <br/>
against feasting and celebrating, per se. Just didn&#39;t like the <br/>
Catholic versions of things.<br/>
<br/>
and of course 4th of July is a United States thing, not universal.<br/>

I disagree. If a day is named after a saint...well, isn&#39;t a saint a <br/>
part of the Church? Aren&#39;t &quot;All Saints&quot; a part of the church? Then, <br/>
Valentine&#39;s and Hallowe&#39;en have to do with the church. And the church <br/>
has to do with Jesus...<br/>

even when it was really lousy (still is...all those nasty hormones and<br/>
things!).  None of the other Christian religions accepted it, either, until<br/>
the 1930s.  Martin Luther and John Calvin and some other big name protestant<br/>
reformer were all absolutely against it.</div>
