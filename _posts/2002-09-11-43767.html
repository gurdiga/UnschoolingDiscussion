<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583033493">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading these posts (atleast the ones that I can find about unschooling) for a couple of months now but this is the first time that I have ever posted.  I live in Texas and don&#39;t know anyone out here in the country that &quot;unschools&quot;.  I have a 13yo and he has always been homeschooled.  Here are some good sites about legally refusing vaccines.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664742573">Hi Jodie... I&#39;m about 20 miles from Texas in Louisiana and there was <br/>
no one (that I could find) unschooling anywhere in the world, much <br/>
less in Louisiana. But that was 20+ years ago. I never had Laurie <br/>
immunized, but I had no idea it was illegal. I just never had it <br/>
done. So, I was more of a rebel than I thought. ;-) <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
