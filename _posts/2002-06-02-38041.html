 However, I don&#39;t think anyone would disagree that there are truly disabled<br/>
 people who exist.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree.<br/>
There are people with disabilities, some massive. But short of being a total <br/>
vegetable from brain damage, there are just people with varying disabilities.<br/>
My writer friend, Marsha, would be offended if you told her she was disabled, <br/>
even though she is confined to a wheelchair for life.<br/>
She lives with disabilities, to say she&#39;s disabled implies her whole being. <br/>
She writes beautifully and leads a full, rich life. <br/>
OTOH, I suppose an unhappy person could be labeled disabled.<br/>

Neural pathways are being grown at an amazing rate the first five years. <br/>
By age 8, we are basically hard wired for life. Now how we use that &quot;hard <br/>
wiring&quot; has a lot to do with whether or not the person in question continues <br/>
with the desire to learn.<br/>
You can quit using neural pathways that grew, you can spark neural pathways <br/>
into use, but you don&#39;t grow them later.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m not arguing the fact that babies learn an incredible amount.  <br/>
 I&#39;m debating the assumption that we must get it all in in <br/>
 these &quot;magical&quot; early years or our abilities somehow diminish. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well....<br/>
If you don&#39;t grow enough neural pathways our ability for the rest of our <br/>
lives is limited. The first five years is hugely important.<br/>
I think you are assuming a nurturing, loving environment in which the parent <br/>
IS assisting that neural development and saying that we continue to learn for <br/>
life.<br/>
I don&#39;t like this &quot;baby genius&quot; type of push, and products to go with it.<br/>
But I don&#39;t think it means that those early years aren&#39;t very important as <br/>
far as stimulation in the form of talk, play etc... go.<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you are looking at healthy families though, and all things being <br/>
equal, the parent doesn&#39;t need to stress out over the early years, versus any <br/>
other years, because in a healthy environment, the child is being stimulated <br/>
by a caring parent that meets it&#39;s needs in both the early years and for <br/>
always.<br/>
