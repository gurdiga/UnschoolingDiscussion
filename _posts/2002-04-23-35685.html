&lt;&lt; Jeepers, this list is going to inspire the vegetarian in me to take over <br/>
the <br/>
 omnivore in me.  Between bloody eggs and hunks of cow carcass, who could <br/>
 resist?!<br/>

Bridget was saying that people take words differently and they don&#39;t really <br/>
matter so much to her....<br/>
I have to say, there is a waitress out there that would say words matter very <br/>
much.<br/>
When I first went vegetarian we went out to eat at a local restaurant....my <br/>
then 3 y.o. ds ordered his hamburger by asking for &quot;some dead cow&quot; with a <br/>
smile on his face.<br/>
The waitress stood there with her mouth open, staring, while the rest of us <br/>
lost it!!<br/>
Words matter a lot.<br/>
