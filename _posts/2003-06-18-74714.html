<br/>
Lemme &#39;splain. On Sunday after church, we had a few things to do at <br/>
the church and at the parsonage before we could go home, so my kids <br/>
waited and played with some neighborhood kids while we did those <br/>
things. There were a five year old boy and two year old girl, and <br/>
sidewalk chalks. We left them playing and did our chores, then came <br/>
back and chatted with the mom for a sec while the kids wrapped up. <br/>
<br/>
By this time, they had moved to the grass where they were playing <br/>
tag. My &quot;socially clueless&quot; 10 year old boy slowed down his own pace <br/>
so the littler kids could catch him, and when the two year old got <br/>
into chasing and pushing, he let himself fall down with great <br/>
alarming shouts of fear, and be romped on. It was heart warming to <br/>
watch his sensitivity to others come out in his play like that.<br/>
