  Ok, Julie, you mentioned Myers-Briggs.  It is sort of a hobby interest<br/>
  with me.  I wonder if unschoolers would be similar in Mb type?  Have you<br/>
  been evaluated? <br/>
<br/>
  Anyone here know their Myers-Briggs type and willing to share?  I was<br/>
  evaluated 20 yrs (geez, that makes me feel....older!)  I was INFP,  but<br/>
  thought I maybe became more &quot;J&quot; over the past 3-5 yrs.<br/>

I just took it, I&#39;m an ENFP too. I&#39;m not sure what it means, but thats what it says I am. I just got up, and haven&#39;t fully saturated my brain in coffee yet. I&#39;m gonna go back and read a bit later, when I can see and think straight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942196912">Wow.  I just had a flashback to getting an A on a test. I was an ENFP, like you Tim.  My description said that I am one of 3% of the pop.  It called me a &quot;champion&quot;.  Pretty seductive stuff.  I am tempted to just buy into this and start living up to my champion personality!   I liked that description and felt some of it really applied...<br/>
 <br/>
However, before I get too grandiose and full of my bad self, I have to admit that on several questions I thought, Hmmmm, well, it depends on the situation.  So how accurate can that be?  I guess others might have had more self-knowledge and answered more assuredly.  I have to read the other posts.<br/>
 <br/>
It was fun though.  I took this test about twelve years ago and I know my answers were very different.  Having children has definately changed me for the better.  <br/>
 <br/>
I saw &quot;The Emeror&#39;s Club&quot; with Kevin Kline last night.  It&#39;s premise is that character determines fate;  despite the efforts of his teacher and his father to &quot;mold&quot; his character, this guy remains &quot;bad&quot;.  The guy was pissed at the world because he was abused by his father and the movie tried to say that he was stuck in that sad, valueless place.  I think our character, personality, passion is always capable of evolving if we aren&#39;t being &quot;molded&quot; by someone or other.  (I guess the idealism part is true).  but I thought it was a bad movie, horrible premise.  Thanks for the test though.  It&#39;s got me thinking.<br/>

Cool.  I would love to be able to master my mind, let alone anyone or anything else.  I am the &quot;champion&quot; of procrastinating, of sillyness and of spontaneous crazy dancing and songwriting about my children&#39;s lives in the moment.  That&#39;s about it, so far.  <br/>

Hey, miss conference coordinator, you&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be ENFP according to the job descriptions someone put up earlier.  You seem extroverted here!  I am only 1% E.  Got very &quot;wimpy&quot; scores!<br/>

At the conference, I&#39;m a major wimp about being &quot;in front of the camera&quot; (no <br/>
actual camera---that&#39;s figurative). And I&#39;m very busy &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.  <br/>
But I&#39;ll be quite gracious in welcoming you! &lt;G&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832265702">&lt;&lt;&lt;Cool.  I would love to be able to master my mind, let alone anyone or anything else.  I am the &quot;champion&quot; of procrastinating, of sillyness and of spontaneous crazy dancing and songwriting about my children&#39;s lives in the moment.  That&#39;s about it, so far.  <br/>
<br/>
  Hey, miss conference coordinator, you&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be ENFP according to the job descriptions someone put up earlier.  You seem extroverted here!  I am only 1% E.  Got very &quot;wimpy&quot; scores!<br/>

  Hey I&#39;m a &quot;Champion&quot; too.  And I could describe my &#39;champion&#39;-ness the same.  I really dread the day when I&#39;m in the middle of one of my silly made up songs and turn to see someone at the door.  8-D.  Not that I&#39;m ashamed of it, it&#39;s just that I can&#39;t carry a tune very well.  <br/>
