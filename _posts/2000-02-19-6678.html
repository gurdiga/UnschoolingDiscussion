Aleasa - <br/>

I am a devoted vegetarian also, who started making natural herbal soaps several years ago.  I began by reading and using the recipes in The Soap Book by Sandy Maine.  This was her first book on soapmaking but I believe she has several others now.  All the rec<br/>
ipes in this book are vegetarian (meaning they don&#39;t use tallow or lard) and are scented using herbal essential oils (which is by far the most expensive ingredient).  <br/>

Thank You! It&#39;s funny how a person can use different search engines and never come up with what their looking for. That&#39;s one reason I like this list! I think she will like several of the books offered here. Thanks again, we really appreciate the info...Aleasa</div>
