<div id="ygrps-yiv-859987173">Hi-	<br/>
I read this list each and every day on digest and don&#39;t often post, but<br/>
this one struck a cord . .  .<br/>
<br/>
We moved to Kauai 17 years ago, bought four raw acres and then spent the<br/>
next two years living in a shed on the land and building our home and<br/>
businesses . . . <br/>
<br/>
Sky was 4, Nell was just 1 when we started and, the last year before the<br/>
house was finished, I became pregnant with Bay! And we did it as<br/>
owner-builders - every single board, nail, concrete footer, shingle,etc.<br/>
was ordered by me, and put up my my now-ex-husband and some willing friends<br/>
and family. The children were always with us, always &#39;helping.&#39; always<br/>
involved in the process. I did have nieces come twice in those years for a<br/>
month at a time to be my mother&#39;s helper. (They were in school, so it was<br/>
during the summer and they camped on the land).  Needless to say, it was a<br/>
long process! Two years+ before we moved into the house. But, you know - it<br/>
stands out in my memory (and that of Sky and Nell) as two of the most<br/>
engaging and happy times we have ever had! I never even thought of putting<br/>
them in school then. (We did have several great years later with a little<br/>
Waldorf school, which then shut down and our next incredible chapter of<br/>
unschooling began!) I can&#39;t offer much specific advice, but to work in<br/>
those nano-moments when your toddler is less &quot;needy&quot;. Be as organized as<br/>
possible to take the best possible advantage of those times. Nell used to<br/>
like to play with all my scrap paper and imitate mama in her office. Sky<br/>
really was most enthralled with the building - we have photos of him with<br/>
his own carpenter&#39;s belt, nailing nails into the scaffolding set up around<br/>
the house as it went up - he was convinced he was building the house! Nell<br/>
and Sky both carried things to those building - including the much-needed<br/>
lunches & beverages we made. We lived on the site, so that made it easier,<br/>
I suppose. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know if this is in the least bit helpful, perhaps it was<br/>
simply my own stroll down memory lane to a delectable time on our lives!<br/>
Feel free to email me off-list if you want to talk more.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>

Yup, this is us!  We started with our drawings over two years ago when<br/>
Scotty was 2.  I got pregnant just before we broke ground.  I was<br/>
finishing concrete last summer in 100 degree weather and 39 weeks<br/>
pregnant (desperate to get labor started.)  We have only just now<br/>
finished the framing.  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; and put up my my now-ex-husband and some willing friends<br/>
and family.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yikes!  I hope it wasn&#39;t the house that caused him to become your ex.  I<br/>
can certainly attest to the strain that is put on the marriage when<br/>
building a house.<br/>
 <br/>

We have certainly had some great moments, but I can&#39;t say it&#39;s been<br/>
totally wonderful.  Chris is desperate to get it finished so we can move<br/>
out of our crappy 600 square foot house that we are in now (which is<br/>
funny because I&#39;m the one who is in it all day and I don&#39;t mind it so<br/>
much) so he&#39;s putting a lot of pressure on himself and me.  Also, the<br/>
weather can be a problem for the kids much of the year.  On a summer<br/>
afternoon it is just too hot and sunny to have them out there for very<br/>
long.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;(We did have several great years later with a little<br/>
Waldorf school, which then shut down and our next incredible chapter of<br/>
unschooling began!) I can&#39;t offer much specific advice, but to work in<br/>

much-needed<br/>
lunches & beverages we made. We lived on the site, so that made it<br/>

I suppose.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
We can do some of these things.  I would love to be able to live on the<br/>
site, but right now it&#39;s not possible.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, I don&#39;t know if this is in the least bit helpful, perhaps it<br/>
was<br/>
simply my own stroll down memory lane to a delectable time on our lives!<br/>

Thanks for taking the time to share your story! It&#39;s good to hear that<br/>
you have fond memories of it.  I&#39;m hoping that that will be all that<br/>
remains for me as well, but right now I tell you it&#39;s hard!<br/>
