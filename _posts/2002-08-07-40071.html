<div id="ygrps-yiv-433945152">No, not one of my kids, ME! Yep, had a math moment last night...it <br/>
was really cool.<br/>
I am in the process of desiging a weathering area/mews for my hawk <br/>
(no, don&#39;t have the bird yet. Permit and weathering area comes <br/>
first)....which involves some math skills I just don&#39;t have.<br/>
I was trying to draw a to scale design, asking dh for some pointers. <br/>
Well, because I&#39;m doing the roof at a slant, to allow rainwater to <br/>
run off, I was trying to figure out how on earth I&#39;d know what length <br/>
lumber to buy. <br/>
If I put the base of the structure ten feet wide, I figured the slant <br/>
on the roof would make it longer than ten feet since it&#39;s at an <br/>
angle...what to do?<br/>
Dh showed me a formula for figuring out the unknown side of a <br/>
triangle and we calculated that by dropping one foot from front to <br/>
back of the structure, it would only change the length by less than <br/>
an inch....drop it two feet and it would change by over 2 inches.<br/>
I did a formula!! whoohooooo....<br/>
Anyway, that led to my wanting to know how to change fractions to <br/>
decimals, decimals to fractions and a lot of other stuff I could not <br/>
remember. Sad eh?<br/>
I need Pam now though, because I am stumped on an equation. I figured <br/>
out how to change 7/12th&#39;s to a decimal (.5833) but how to show the <br/>
steps of changing it from decimal form to a fraction? I can&#39;t do it.<br/>
.5833/1,000 is how you would start, right? How do you solve this when <br/>
you can&#39;t find a common denominator?<br/>
What are the steps? I can&#39;t find a common denominator for these two <br/>
numbers and get it to the 7/12ths that I know is the answer.<br/>
How do you get this to 7/12ths? HELP!!<br/>
I am so happy to know I&#39;m not a total idiot, just Math phobic....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153725265">Ren, <br/>
<br/>
You could also have measured your drawing and multiplied by scale.  If your <br/>
drawing showed four inches to four feet... that would be easy!<br/>
<br/>
But with lumber and roofing materials there&#39;s no sense figuring it out to the <br/>
inch because lumber and tarpaper and stuff only come in certain sizes.  You <br/>
put it on and cut off the extra.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes too much math isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>
