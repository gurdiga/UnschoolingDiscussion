&lt;&lt; We put a <br/>
 spoonful in her mouth while she was open and screaming. She ate the rest of <br/>
 the bowl. Too coersive? ;-) &gt;&gt;<br/>

I actually do that with Jalen regularly, he&#39;s not very willing to try <br/>
anything the first time (heck, he&#39;s only one y.o.) so I put a little on his <br/>
lip and after he tastes it he ends up gobbling the entire bowl down.<br/>
Sometimes Moms really can know best!! I would never try to make him eat <br/>
something he truly didn&#39;t want.<br/>
