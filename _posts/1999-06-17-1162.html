<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056028347">&lt;&lt;I am bravely going to ask that conversations which encourage <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so far behind in reading these posts (and each download of a digest seems <br/>
to take forever), that I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve gotten a lot of &quot;hear, hears&quot; by now.  <br/>
 This is just one more--you said what I was thinking.<br/>
