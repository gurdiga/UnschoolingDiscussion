&lt;&lt; My Dad had read about vacuuming a cat (to help with shedding) and he and I<br/>
<br/>
tried this with my cat when I was 13.  The cat was about 6-7 years old and I<br/>
<br/>
ended up in the emergency room.  I still have a scar on my finger, the one<br/>
<br/>
fingernail was almost completely torn off.  Be careful, some animals<br/>
<br/>
consider this abuse and won&#39;t stand for it.  I can, however, see how a<br/>
<br/>
little baby kitten could grow to love such a thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine when we were teens used the vacuum cleaner to...  ummmm.....<br/>
<br/>
she called it bluntly &quot;jacking off her cat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She only vacuumed his tommy-bits and he seemed to like it plenty.<br/>
