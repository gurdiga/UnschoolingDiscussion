<div id="ygrps-yiv-710290837">If not being an independent player is part of your son&#39;s personality, then<br/>
unschooling, homeschooling or schooling isn&#39;t going to change that.<br/>
<br/>
I would expect that the &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; mantra will increase for a period after<br/>
he is at home.  When my kids say they are bored, I always show that I&#39;m<br/>
pleased and explain that means something wonderful is brewing in their<br/>
brains.  I truly believe that and after several years, the kids also believe<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
When any kid is coming out of school and into unschooling, they don&#39;t really<br/>
know WHAT to do with themselves.  I always suggest the mom do some things<br/>
that interest HER and allow for the child to come along for the ride.  What<br/>
would you just love to do?  Gardening?  Pottery?  Breeding rabbits?<br/>
Training the dog?  Making soap?  Whatever.  As you open the doors for<br/>
yourself, he will be allowed to peek in as well.<br/>
<br/>
And as a former TV limiter, I understand your concerns about the<br/>
computer....but the kids truly do get tired of them and move on to other<br/>
things, while the TV or games can be a spring board to many of those other<br/>
things.<br/>
