&gt; &lt;&lt; And she enthusiastically said she wanted to write a report. And<br/>
&gt; you said to her, &quot;I don&#39;t want a report&quot;.  Now I trust that you had a<br/>
&gt; good reason but can you explain why you responded like this? I would<br/>
&gt; like to understand fully. I&#39;m thinking that maybe you wanted her to<br/>
&gt; understand that a report is written when someone wants one for a real<br/>
&gt; reason. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As it turned out, I laminated it and used it in a workshop on writing.  <br/>
&gt;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-A lot of parents, even unschoolers, would be tempted to try to,<br/>
&gt; in a subtle way, encourage writing, or at least not discourage. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think you were really trying to discourage, but instead had some clear<br/>
&gt; good intention.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were joking around and I was telling them about school book  <br/>
&gt; reports, and<br/>
&gt; she said she wanted to write one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have a scanner working, but I&#39;ll try to put it up where people  <br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; see it someday.   It&#39;s very decorated and decorative.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     It would be really fun to see an unschoolers book report!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-    I do know that with my son who has been to PS that I have to  <br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; be careful not to react more to schoolish type interests, because he<br/>
&gt; picks up on it and has an aversion to doing these things if they are<br/>
&gt; considered schoolish and therefore more desirable. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When Marty was little I used to tease him if he would read something  <br/>
&gt; aloud<br/>
&gt; (the name of a business, or a word off a billboard) and say &quot;STOP!  If  <br/>
&gt; I wanted<br/>
&gt; you to read, I would have sent you to school.&quot;  He thought it was  <br/>
&gt; hilarious<br/>
&gt; that he was &quot;rebelling&quot; by learning to read against my will.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was along the lines of that when I told Holly I didn&#39;t want a  <br/>
&gt; report.  It<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t the reverse psychology of &quot;no, no, I really don&#39;t want one,&quot;  <br/>
&gt; though.  I<br/>
&gt; really did NOT want one!!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     yes, I&#39;m starting to get it. This is very helpful in seeing  it  <br/>
differently--plus what you wrote just below.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The last few years I taught, book reports took the form of private<br/>
&gt; discussions, with the  book in hand and the kid could look things up  <br/>
&gt; to read me good<br/>
&gt; parts or find characters&#39; names if they needed to.   I didn&#39;t care if  <br/>
&gt; they said<br/>
&gt; they didn&#39;t like the book, or that they had stopped &quot;here&quot; and showed  <br/>
&gt; me how<br/>
&gt; far they had gotten before they decided to bail.  The point was to  <br/>
&gt; discuss<br/>
&gt; something they had read (rather than to have finished and summarized a  <br/>
&gt; book).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do that sort of thing with my kids all the time, so the traditional  <br/>
&gt; written<br/>
&gt; book report to prove the book had been read, or to practice writing  <br/>
&gt; reports<br/>
&gt; (I shudder at that justification) has no place in my life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-But he didn&#39;t mention the<br/>
&gt; writing so I didn&#39;t. I peeked later without him knowing. I was very<br/>
&gt; curious about the content and somewhat about the spelling. He was<br/>
&gt; writing about Six Flags! It was cute.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I noticed someone criticized your looking.  If he wanted it secret he<br/>
&gt; could&#39;ve hidden it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     Yes, I think it really depends on the kid and the situation. I know  <br/>
that he knows that he can tell me anything. I also<br/>
     know that it was highly unlikely that the content would have been  <br/>
anything other than &quot;light&quot; in nature. In a situation<br/>
     where there is a lot of love and respect and acceptance, there is  <br/>
not much reason to hide anything.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids and husband read over my shoulder lots of times.  If I have  <br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; secret to write (which is rare) I do it in secret.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Marty and Kirby share my computer sometimes.  Sometimes they leave  <br/>
&gt; files<br/>
&gt; open.  Sometimes I&#39;ve had to look at an &quot;untitled&quot; or oddly named file  <br/>
&gt; on the<br/>
&gt; desktop to see where to put it.  I see their writing there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of the things I read into the record at that workshop (or at least  <br/>
&gt; passed<br/>
&gt; around for people to see) was some online role playing stuff of  <br/>
&gt; Kirby&#39;s.  It<br/>
&gt; was really good.  Its goodness wasn&#39;t in technicalities, but in the  <br/>
&gt; aliveness<br/>
&gt; of the language, in the &quot;voice&quot; of the character, and in the  <br/>
&gt; tenderness of the<br/>
&gt; treatment of the other character (he was being the dad to a young  <br/>
&gt; daughter,<br/>
&gt; and this wasn&#39;t a &quot;public&quot; scene, but was in a chatroom, just the two  <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; them---part of &quot;storyline,&quot; but not in the way of in-person D&D games  <br/>
&gt; in front of<br/>
&gt; the whole group).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got Kirby&#39;s permission to use that, though, before I used it.  I  <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; his permission to read it before I read it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that he has his own computer, I wouldn&#39;t look at anything on there.<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s on my physical or electronic desktop for me to have to move or  <br/>
&gt; clean up,<br/>
&gt; though, seems fair game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids know my passwords.  They can look at stuff on my computer.   <br/>
&gt; Things I<br/>
&gt; want to keep close (Christmas notes and such) are named things they  <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think to look in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I found one of Marty&#39;s role playing scenes the other day.  It was  <br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; sweet too.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s never cause in school to &quot;write something sweet.&quot;   All the  <br/>
&gt; sweet<br/>
&gt; stuff is love notes and they&#39;re confiscated and the kid&#39;s in trouble  <br/>
&gt; for writing<br/>
&gt; and passing them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     This is such a good point. And in both instances, they did not hide  <br/>
them. Especially<br/>
     interesting because they are boys.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-Sorry this is long. Thanks for reading! And thanks for the talk by<br/>
&gt; you and Richard.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well you&#39;re welcome. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are two other tapes of co-presentations by Richard and me.  I  <br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re both better than the one on writing.   One is &quot;To Question or  <br/>
&gt; Not to<br/>
&gt; Question: That is the Question,&quot; and &quot;Peaceful Parenting.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     Yes, I have the &quot;To Question&quot; one. It is very good. I&#39;m gonna  <br/>
listen again since knowing<br/>
     you think its better. I will get the other one which I did not know  <br/>
about. Thanks.<br/>
