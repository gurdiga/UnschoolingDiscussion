<br/>
&gt; Please remember-you are the adult.  If you are uncomfortable about the<br/>
&gt; amount of television your child is watching-and especially it&#39;s content.<br/>
&gt; You can do something about it.  Put the tv in the garage for a month and see<br/>
&gt; how life changes.  I promise it will be for the better.  And you may find<br/>
&gt; that nobody misses it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was a time in our lives when we were without a TV for several months<br/>
(no money to purchase a new one).<br/>
<br/>
We missed it, and we didn&#39;t think it was for the better.<br/>
<br/>
My young children monitor their own viewing very well. Until recently, my 7<br/>
year old would not watch any &quot;adult&quot; TV outside of Survivor. My four year<br/>
old still does not.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fascinating to me to watch the dynamic of adults arguing about<br/>
television viewing, and about diet (and bedtimes and spanking...)<br/>
<br/>
Even those who really do hand over control of television, or want to, often<br/>
say things like, &quot;But they only watch Discovery Channel&quot; or &quot;and she doesn&#39;t<br/>
even turn the thing on!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same thing with diet.<br/>
<br/>
Hardly anyone says right out: We love television. We find it entertaining as<br/>
well as educational. There are times we watch quite a bit of it. I would not<br/>
miss an episode of The West Wing if you paid me. Television for us is<br/>
sometimes thought-provoking and relevant, and sometimes pure mind candy.<br/>
Pretty much exactly the same as books or music.<br/>
<br/>
We also like candy, cookies, cereal that comes with prizes, and ice cream<br/>
from cows without resumes.<br/>
<br/>
We eat some &quot;good&quot; food and watch some &quot;good&quot; television, but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean we don&#39;t fully enjoy and eat and watch &quot;too much&quot; at times of the &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a self-righteousness about hating TV (or dairy or caffeine) that I<br/>
confess used to make me irritable (or maybe that was the caffeine &lt;g&gt;). I am<br/>
lucky to have outgrown that reaction (unschooling cured me -- the<br/>
self-righteousness of everyone who thinks and thought I was nuts acted as a<br/>
psychiatric immersion).<br/>
<br/>
Now, that self-righteousness almost amuses me, because the picture people<br/>
paint of television is that smart people either a) Don&#39;t watch it or b) Only<br/>
watch mentally stimulating, tasteful programming.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to break it to you, but I&#39;m pretty smart. Not a genius, but I can<br/>
hold my own. So are my daughters, and my husband&#39;s not bad for a guy &lt;g&gt;. We<br/>
read books (well, the girls aren&#39;t reading yet, but they beg to be read to).<br/>
<br/>
We eat what we want and it balances out (there are two HUGE buckets of<br/>
leftover Halloween candy downstairs, right now, on the rolling table, that<br/>
have gone down very little since October 31. Soon I&#39;ll have to throw them<br/>
out just to make room for the pretty Christmas candy I like to keep around<br/>
after Thanksgiving.) What did my daughter ask for for dinner? Salad. If my<br/>
daughter ever really did eat nothing but celery and peanut butter I&#39;m<br/>
confident I&#39;d notice it and be paying attention to what the problem REALLY<br/>
was before she was suffering from malnutrition. For a child to behave in<br/>
such a bizarre fashion, presuming she was given options, will show up in<br/>
many ways besides diet.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a lot of goals for myself or my children, outside doing what<br/>
makes us happy. People who are happy tend to eat well, monitor their own<br/>
activities, learn, think, grow. They don&#39;t tend to be malnourished or do<br/>
absolutely nothing but watch TV or fail to learn how to read (in a reading<br/>
household), or drink Clorox or play on the freeway or not think or not grow.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of parents who are invested in thinking they have to<br/>
control diet or television or education. Some people think we are all doing<br/>
our children a huge disservice by not sending them to school. It&#39;s not fake,<br/>
some really do believe that.<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful thing about lists like this is that people reading, who are<br/>
undecided, can (and will, the little devils) make up their own minds about<br/>
it. I used to fret over those people reading viewpoints that I found crazed<br/>
and bad for children. I don&#39;t anymore. People are going to believe what<br/>
they&#39;re going to believe, do what is comfortable for them to wrap their<br/>
brains around. If someone out there wants to believe that a healthy, happy<br/>
child really DOES eat nothing but celery and peanut butter until her life is<br/>
in danger, I have the maturity to bear up, even if I don&#39;t like the<br/>
unnecessary control they then place on their kids, and even if I&#39;m still<br/>
compelled to say so.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, who should also just come right out of the closet and admit to liking<br/>
romance novels.</div>
