human existence. What is good? What is bad? Where does evil eminate from? Who <br/>
is responsible? Where is God, What is the Force??  If he was reading Dante&#39;s <br/>
Inferno  or Milton you&#39;d be proud, but you know what, he&#39;d be going over the <br/>
same issues.<br/>
<br/>
Science Fiction takes the science we know and tries to extend it.  Ever seen <br/>
a rerun of Buck Rodgers???  They seem so childish now. &lt;G&gt;  He&#39;s getting a <br/>
good dose of real science mixed in with what if... That&#39;s scientific thinking <br/>
at it&#39;s best.<br/>
<br/>
Video games are math in action.  Find an algebra 2 book and look for the <br/>
chapter on Matrix&#39;s.  Then play a video game.  A Matrix in action.  The <br/>
logical thinking that is required to play most video games rivals the logic <br/>
used in any textbook word problem.  My 9 year old spent most of yesterday <br/>
drawing his own mazes for his own *video game*.  Math in action, as he had to <br/>
use scale and porportion,  measurement (as in graph paper boxes)  He then <br/>
spent at least 2 hours, if all totalled up reading....struggling to read his <br/>
video game magazines.  He&#39;s not working on Dick and Jane words using that <br/>
magazine.  :)<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s on the net, what is he reading... (there&#39;s that reading and <br/>
vocabulary thing again).  Is he typing... um.. writing at all. Does he have <br/>
email pals that he writes to daily??  He could be doing an incredible amount <br/>
of English..........<br/>
<br/>
One day I found my teen on the computer just as dawn was beaking.  I was <br/>
really irratited, knowing that she&#39;d stayed up all night and would sleep all <br/>
day and I needed her. ( her sibs are 7, 9 and 11 years younger, sometimes I <br/>
have to have her help)  Know what, she&#39;d gotten involved in a discussion <br/>
about God and the universe. She&#39;d sent all night defending her positions and <br/>
really listening to people who held vastly different beliefs.  Where else but <br/>
the net is she going to get that??  ((We live in AL and almost everyone is a <br/>
fundamentalist Christian, including many members of our family. Religion is <br/>
just not a topic we discuss very much because the feelings run so deep, even <br/>
between relatives who just practice Christianity differently from each <br/>
other.))  Theology at 16.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know your son, but I do know that our teens are awesome. They are in <br/>
their own heads, thinking and comparing and wondering. Sometimes they are <br/>
overwhelmed by the adult world and are confused by how we compartmentalize <br/>
our world. They aren&#39;t ready to put things in nice neat boxes...... boxes of <br/>
ticky tacky.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s shift of persepctive to look at what they ARE doing and see the learning <br/>
and connections inherent in their choices.   He hasn&#39;t been deschooling for 3 <br/>
years getting ready to go back to schooling. He&#39;s been unschooling for a very <br/>
long time.  :)<br/>

him to anything by or about Joseph Campbell.  He covers all these topics<br/>
mentioned above and uses illustrations from every major religion, as well<br/>
as modern movies and other sources.  He discusses the traditional HERO myth<br/>
and the boy coming-of-age story (where the &#39;boy&#39; survives tirals and<br/>
hardships and through courage and the power of his mind he comes through on<br/>
the other side a man [see Star Wars]), as represented in every culture on<br/>
the planet, as well as a number of other myths.  He might find his work<br/>
intesting.  I know I find it fascinating!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;at it&#39;s best.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Science fiction is wonderful and often stretches the mind into new<br/>
configurations of thought in order to comprehend some pretty complicated<br/>
futuristic concepts.  Try talking to him about that interest, and maybe<br/>
introducing him to some new SF books that may broaden his interests.  Maybe<br/>
a trip to the local bookstore (which my family thinks of more as the<br/>
brain-candy store!) is in order, to let him pick out some new material.  My<br/>
brother devours SF books at the speed of light, as does my husband.  My<br/>
husband took his interest in SF and now works as an Engineer, doing product<br/>
testing for Waste disposal and cleanup (he calls it playing with toys for a<br/>
living!)  But he is very math oriented.  <br/>
<br/>
For someone more interested in the language and story there are lots of<br/>
ways to make a career of it.  How about writing their own books, designing<br/>
video or computer games, comic book creation for those with art talent,<br/>
retailing SF merchandise (big business,) creating SF role playing or board<br/>
games (there is always room for more!) and lots of other ideas that I can&#39;t<br/>
think of but I&#39;m sure others can.  The point is, if your son has enough<br/>
math to pass a GED, that is all that he needs to progress in the world.  He<br/>
will learn as much math as he needs to get along, just like I did.  I HATED<br/>
math and failed it so many times that I still can&#39;t pick up a textbook<br/>
without cringing.  The idea is to prepare him for wherever he wants to take<br/>
himself in his future, and if you can light a fire under him, math will<br/>
meerly become a tool, a means to an end, instead of the enemy.  If he can<br/>
find his direction, his passion, than he WILL learn any math he needs to<br/>
meet his goals, and you WON&#39;T have to crack a textbook! <br/>

     I guess I hadnt really thought of it that way.  You brought up the book <br/>
Dantes Infernal, saying that I would be proud if he was reading that instead <br/>
of Star Wars.  I went to public school and I never read that book!  I guess <br/>
it is time for me to read it now, so that I know what people are talking <br/>

Have you read anything by Seymour Papert?  He writes about computers and <br/>
learning and has some really fresh ideas.  The above validates some of ideas <br/>
he discusses about computers and computer games.</div>

     THANK YOU!!!!  You can&#39;t imagine how much your post means to me!  I have <br/>
had so much negativity from those around me about my son, that it can be very <br/>
catching.  When he was little, he unknowingly to us, had a hearing problem.  <br/>
For the first four years of his life, he didn&#39;t talk.  I took him to the <br/>
pediatrician constantly, just to be told that he would talk when he wanted to <br/>
that his hearing was fine.  Finally, in desperation, I took him to a <br/>
specialist.  We found out that he could hear &quot;sounds&quot; but not enough to <br/>
understand them (that is why the little beep in the ear test that the <br/>
pediatrician did, always showed that he had hearing).  The reason that he <br/>
could understand us enough to follow instructions was that he had learned to <br/>
read our lips!  However he couldn&#39;t hear enough to really mimic speech.  <br/>
     At four, he took speech therapy.  At five, he started kindergarten (at <br/>
the request of his therapist and others who thought that he needed to be <br/>
around other kids).  That did no good at all, as his speech was &quot;baby talk&quot; <br/>
at that time and just got him ridiculed by other children.  Besides his <br/>
characteristics (from 4 years of not hearing) were very different and <br/>
immature compaired to other children.  We ended up having him repeat grades <br/>
while he was still younger, but he still had a &quot;hellish&quot; experience during <br/>
public school.  He even had a teacher ridicule him in front of class (which I <br/>
didn&#39;t find out about until later---or I would have done something about <br/>
it!!!  It still makes me furious to think about it all these years later!), <br/>
which caused him to start becoming angry and acting out at home.  Finally in <br/>
desperation in his 6th grade year, I began looking for options (private <br/>
school, parocial school etc) and a friend mentioned homeschooling.  I was <br/>
shocked!  &quot;Do you mean that it is LEGAL?&quot;  I asked.  I only thought that <br/>
people who lived in the &quot;Arctic&quot; and couldn&#39;t get to a school did that.<br/>
     Now I wish I had heard of it way before he began his public school &quot;shop <br/>
of horrors&quot; experience.  I guess that with public school teachers as parents, <br/>
I shouldn&#39;t be surprised to not hear of homeschooling, but I am.<br/>
     Anyway, possibly because of his bad experiences, my son seemed to have <br/>
no interest in anything.  We tried baseball, soccer, music, choir, you name <br/>
it-we tried it.  It wasn&#39;t until he started playing nintendo, that we could <br/>
get him interested in anything, and then we were dissapointed that he was <br/>
&quot;hooked&quot; onto nintendo, as that wasn&#39;t exactly what we had in mind.  Since <br/>
then, he has also gotten hooked onto Science Fiction and Fantasy. Hence the <br/>
Star Trek, Star Wars, and Robert Jordan books, which his dear mother (me), is <br/>
also hooked on.  *grin*<br/>
     Our relatives, however, can&#39;t get by his very immature and troubled <br/>
non-hearing childhood.  They are constantly worrying out loud, about what he <br/>
is going to do for his future.  They are never around at boy scouts or youth <br/>
group to see how much he has blossomed.  (He has tons of friends and is <br/>
considered a leader in boy scouts.)  Instead, they see the bungling, awkward <br/>
child that is now homeschooling, won&#39;t finish a math book and is ruining his <br/>
life by unschooling, sleeping to 11:00 am, staying up until 2:00 am. being <br/>
hooked on Science Fiction and Nintendo.<br/>
     Unfortunately, the more I hear of their doubt and worry, the more I <br/>
start doubting and worrying also.  I am constantly rereading GWS and HEM, <br/>
John Holt books, and Llewellyn books but sometimes that makes it worse <br/>
because those kids seem to be taking off and really &quot;doing&quot; something with <br/>
their lives.<br/>
     Thank you, thank you, thank you for making me stop and see that maybe <br/>
there IS a possibility of getting a career out of the things that he likes to <br/>
do. I really did need the encouragement.  I am planning on spending this <br/>
summer doing alot of thinking and pondering on my children and their &quot;good <br/>
aspects&quot; and how to encourage them to grow.<br/>
I am also going to try to &quot;deschool&quot; Myself!  It seems like I need it as much <br/>
as my kids, since I can&#39;t seem to get the &quot;traditional&quot; school views out of <br/>
my head.<br/>
     If you have any suggestions for me, please send them my way.  This is <br/>
going to be a very interesting summer---at least as far as &quot;thoughtful <br/>
speculations&quot; and planning goes!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389917246">Wow, your story makes me glad that my mom took me out of school before first<br/>
grade.<br/>
I had lots of ear infections when I was young, so my hearing was sort of off<br/>
as well. I didn&#39;t start speaking until about age four, and then I was put in<br/>
one of those schools (I forgot what they&#39;re called) with only three other<br/>
kids in the classroom, lots of individual attention. Kindergarten, though,<br/>
was in a public school, with about thirty other kids in the class and a very<br/>
exausted teacher. Not good for me at all -- but luckily I haven&#39;t had to<br/>
worry about that since Mom took me out of school before first grade :)<br/>
Sounds like your son had it pretty rough in school -- don&#39;t worry that he<br/>
isn&#39;t the Ultimate Unschooler (I&#39;m not either and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of<br/>
others who don&#39;t Do Everything. The ones that are doing everything just get<br/>
the most publicity :)  ) Just give him space :-) ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>

 get him interested in anything,  &gt;&gt;<br/>

HUGS!  And tears for your precious son.  That is so horrible.  And just think <br/>
what he has overcome!  I am sure that the games became so important to him <br/>
because he could do this himself, without fear of people making fun of him.  <br/>
He will always have that in the back of his mind, but, he can become an <br/>
animator or invent cd games, gameboy games, all things he doesn&#39;t&#39; need <br/>
anyone else to see or hear til he is ready.  My guys are wanting to make <br/>
their own playstation games, I haven&#39;t a clue as to where to go to help with <br/>
this project, if anyone does, please let me know.  Maybe your son would be <br/>
interested in that too.<br/>

 Sounds like your son had it pretty rough in school -- don&#39;t worry that he<br/>
 isn&#39;t the Ultimate Unschooler (I&#39;m not either and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of<br/>
 others who don&#39;t Do Everything. The ones that are doing everything just get<br/>
 the most publicity :)  ) Just give him space :-) ~Eryn<br/>

    You were lucky!  I wish that I had removed him from school early also.  <br/>
Oh well, I can&#39;t redo the past, but I am thankful that everyone is helping me <br/>
relook at his future.  I doesn&#39;t look so grim anymore.  Thank you!<br/>

    Thank you for the hugs and tears!  I think my son likes nintendo games <br/>
because it was the first thing that he found that he was good at.  Of course, <br/>
he has now found that there are alot of things that he is good at, but he is <br/>
not athletic, and being a boy, that really bothered him alot when he was <br/>
younger.  He is good at things like hiking and other outdoor rugged <br/>
activities (possibly because those are the things that his father and I also <br/>
like to do), but don&#39;t ask him to play baseball or basketball, he just has no <br/>
interest in those things.<br/>
     My kids also want to make their own nintendo games.  I imagine that that <br/>
is a popular request now, as I have heard alot of kids say that that is what <br/>
they want to do when they grow up.  I do not know how they go about getting <br/>
that type of training, or what kind of education that entails, but I doubt <br/>
that they have room for as many kids that want to do it <br/>
(including my own).LOL<br/>

I wanted to write to give you a few suggestions about your son, and<br/>
possible future career paths.  I did send you a long note previously about<br/>
the possible directions that his interests could take him.  He sounds a lot<br/>
like my brother.  Not very motivated, devours SF and Fantasy books at a<br/>
phenomenal pace, very intelligent.  My brother currently works as a manager<br/>
for a retail computer software store.  But I think he would also do great<br/>
with his own retail hobbie and game store.  <br/>
<br/>
You can try getting in touch with anyone in your area who works in those<br/>
fields and see if your son would be interested in striking up a friendship<br/>
with them, or doing apprentice type work with them.  Gaming, Fantasy and<br/>
Science Fiction conventions are also a great place for networking with<br/>
folks in those businesses, and making contacts, or even just an opportunity<br/>
for your son to learn more about the options that he might be interested in<br/>
and might want to persue as a career.  If he is interested in writing at<br/>
all, you might try to contact some of the authors of the books that he<br/>
enjoys and see if any of them will write and encourage him.  If he is<br/>
interested in Fantasy and SF board or role playing games you can try to<br/>
find some of their creators to write to and tell your son about how they<br/>
got started and about their jobs.  There are thousands of people who write<br/>
these books and make up these games, and they are just ordinary folks who<br/>
are interested in the genres, just like your son.<br/>
<br/>
If he is more interested in the practical applications and possibilities of<br/>
SF technologies perhaps a Space Camp would be a great way to introduce him<br/>
to the real world fact behind the fiction.  One of my sisters works as an<br/>
Engineer in design and management for NASA.  If he has interest in the real<br/>
life space program, perhaps I can ask her to send me some information to<br/>
forward to you, or get you some names for contact in the space program for<br/>
mentoring.  They love to do things with school-kids, as it is great PR for<br/>
them.  They ARE governmentally funded, after all.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few thoughts,<br/>

     That is an idea that I hadn&#39;t thought of.  When my son mentioned having <br/>
a career that is involved with video games, I immediately thought of a career <br/>
developing them.  I figured that that type of career would take extensive <br/>
math and computer education, and I know how much he hates math.  I never <br/>
thought about him doing a different type of job that involves video games.  <br/>
That opens up alot of opportunities that I hadn&#39;t considered.  Thank you.<br/>

     Thanks for the tip!  I will tell him tomorrow, since it is now 2:30 am <br/>
and he is asleep.<br/>
