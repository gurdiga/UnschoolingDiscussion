<div id="ygrps-yiv-733963240">After the Mean Girls thread, I recalled that recently I was asked to <br/>
write a parent&#39;s advisory for local dance parents, about an upcoming production <br/>
of the Broadway smash musical &quot;Ragtime.&quot; We were considering whether to adopt <br/>
one performance as a fundraiser we&#39;d all bring our families to (with children <br/>
of different ages.) So parents needed insight not only for their personal <br/>
decisions, but for the group decision as to whether the show lends itself to <br/>
being a family fundraiser.<br/>
<br/>
      I too highlighted some bits and pieces, but imo in the opposite spirit <br/>
of the Mean Girls advisory. FWIW, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Ragtime is one of my very favorite shows. Please keep in mind as you read <br/>
the following that I personally LOVE this show and can barely sit still and <br/>
not dance in my seat and sing all the parts. I plan to see the TALC production <br/>
several times if possible.<br/>
<br/>
       When the Broadway touring company of Ragtime was here last year, (name <br/>
of theatre mentor) consulted with me about whether Dear Daughter 14 could <br/>
handle it, and I decided to risk it. I am not sorry I did -- we talked about it <br/>
for days, bought the cast recording, and since then literally memorized it-- <br/>
but I&#39;d have to say she doesn&#39;t make a good barometer for what might appeal to <br/>
the average teen in literary, political, or cultural terms. (She&#39;s also read <br/>
the Doctorow novel that Ragtime was based on, which is even darker than the <br/>
show. She also worked on Jeckyl and Hyde, which had a few scenes almost too <br/>
graphic for me!)  Dear Son 8 knows the score and we&#39;ve been working for months to <br/>
prepare him to understand the show, but I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s ready even now for the <br/>
emotional impact of it onstage. <br/>
<br/>
       So I offer the following guide to help company parents consider <br/>
whether this show would suit their own children and families, trying not to give too <br/>
much away and also not trying to discourage you at all, just to give you a <br/>
heads-up. <br/>
<br/>
A Company Parent&#39;s No-Holes-Barred Advisory on Ragtime:<br/>
<br/>
This is a powerful, uplifting and broadly relevant social drama from the <br/>
early 1900s about difficult political themes such as race, sex and class, <br/>
punctuated by historical figures of the period from Henry Ford to Harry Houdini to <br/>
Booker T. Washington. It takes historical and moral knowledge, life experience <br/>
and a certain tolerance for ambiguity to appreciate. One sympathetic main <br/>
character dies a violent death and is mourned (this is essential to the storyline <br/>
but also in my opinion very upsetting, even to adults.) A baby is born out of <br/>
wedlock and his desperate mother abandons him to die. Among the minor characters <br/>
are racists who use the *n* word several times while thoroughly humiliating a <br/>
black couple, a European union organizer inciting workers to riot against <br/>
their oppressors, a scantily clad vaudeville singer plying her looks and sex to <br/>
inflame men to murderous passions, a young girl whose mother has died, and a <br/>
wealthy young man with every advantage who basically becomes a suicide bomber.<br/>
