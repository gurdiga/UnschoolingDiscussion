me, and it was always okay to say &quot;no&quot; to anybody who was bugging them&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To my mind, this is one of the greatest strengths of *allowing* children to<br/>
learn<br/>
that they have a voice in their own lives...day by day by day.<br/>
<br/>
At a Daisy GS meeting recently, I noticed that my 5yo daughter was not<br/>
participating in a skit/game the other girls were doing. I moved closer to<br/>
the game to hear and see what was going on better, and was able to hear her<br/>
clearly tell the other girls that she did not wish to play...just didn&#39;t<br/>
want to.<br/>
<br/>
While with my first daughter Savannah, I would have tried to whisper<br/>
something to her about participating or being part of the group, I was just<br/>
so pleased to see how well Jordyn expressed her limits and wishes, and I<br/>
backed-off. I&#39;ve done it several times since.<br/>
<br/>
I used to fall into the trap with my oldest, of not remembering what a<br/>
valuable skill and safety this is...<br/>
that a child, teen, person...any of us...would know how to set limits<br/>
clearly. I worry sometimes if she draws back  too much. But I need to let<br/>
her have her own rhythm, and to encourage clear expression of that rhythm<br/>
every step of the way.<br/>
<br/>
At the fair recently, she attempted a ride that made my head spin. I tried<br/>
to negotiate with her to wait a year. Nope.&quot;I feel that I need to do this.&quot;<br/>
Okay. She did it. Loved it. Rode it several times afterwards. BUT it was<br/>
hard for me to allow her to find her own<br/>
comfort zone, and step out of mine.<br/>
<br/>
As a teen walking to and from school, I had many near-misses with all sorts<br/>
of would-be predators. As a child I had been taught not to disrespect<br/>
authority, or to say &quot;no&quot; to an adult, or to upset or be impolite to anyone.<br/>
BIG mistake. I truly believe that predators can smell that training.<br/>
<br/>
To say &quot;NO&quot; to someone, for me, was like asking to be struck by lightening,<br/>
so Trusting (or even FINDING)<br/>
my instincts in all sorts of situations has taken conscious dismanteling of<br/>
*politeness* instilled.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your many many honest posts, Sandra.<br/>

&lt;&lt; As a teen walking to and from school, I had many near-misses with all sorts<br/>

<br/>
I had a couple of scary incidents as a teen.  Once a neighbor came onto his <br/>
porch with a rifle and called out to me and asked if I was okay.  I waved and <br/>
said yes, and the four guys in the car who were in the process of getting out <br/>
to try to put me in it decided to leave.  I am SO glad the neighbor was <br/>
looking and saw that happening!!<br/>
<br/>
When my boys were little and I didn&#39;t know for sure what kind of parents my <br/>
husband and I might grow up to be, I designated another couple of friends of <br/>
ours and I told the kids if they ever felt that Keith and I were being bad <br/>
parents or we were hurting them or scaring them, to go tell Jeff or Paul <br/>
(friends who were at the time in their early 20&#39;s).  I told Jeff and Paul <br/>
that if our kids ever came to them to report anything, NOT to justify our <br/>
side, not to shush the kids up, but to be the kids&#39; advocates even if it <br/>
meant turning us in to authorities.<br/>
<br/>
That made me feel better, especially after we were homeschooling and (having <br/>
been a teacher) I knew the kids were down by one safeguard (adults at school <br/>
who might get wise to abuse at home).<br/>
<br/>
As it turned out, though, we&#39;ve been pretty safe parents.  I&#39;ve lost my <br/>
temper with Kirby a couple of times, and I put &quot;a clawmark&quot; on Marty once, <br/>
grabbing him and him twisting loose.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had that kind of talk with Holly.  I should.  I should remind the <br/>
boys, too, although at 12 and 14, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d have any trouble <br/>
talking to me and Keith directly, and if that didn&#39;t help they&#39;d definitely <br/>
rat us in to mutual adult friends.<br/>
<br/>
My mom told me early on, &quot;Always tell the truth, even if it were to mean that <br/>
me or your dad would have to go to jail because of it.&quot;  I didn&#39;t know until <br/>
I was grown what that could mean, but I used to say &quot;Okay.&quot;  Now I know what <br/>
she meant.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends, though, whose parents WERE doing yucko stuff, and used to <br/>
swear them to secrecy.<br/>
