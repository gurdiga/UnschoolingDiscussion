<div id="ygrps-yiv-259647888">...I have a story. <br/>
  <br/>
    My oldest daughter, Kristen, is a 4th grade teacher in town. ( I gave her <br/>
a ride home tonight and we were chatting in the car). <br/>
  Well..the other day a friend of mine picked up my two young kids at home <br/>
and went to the elementary school to pick up her daughter ( a second grader) <br/>
before heading back to their house to play.<br/>
  <br/>
   While they were at the school, they stopped in to see my daugher, (the <br/>
teacher, their older sister). The mom went to get her daughter, and Kristen took <br/>
Chad and Chloe with her to bring the school children out to the bus.<br/>
  <br/>
   She told me tonight that it was a riot. Chad skipped the whole way  and <br/>
Chloe was jumping the cracks in the walkway as she held her hand.<br/>
   She said Chad and Chloe seemed so HAPPY and all the other kids were <br/>
walking  single file and were like little &quot;robots&quot;.( of course, only doing what they <br/>
have been taught to do). <br/>
   She said she soooooooo much noticed the difference...and when she got out <br/>
of the car as I pulled into her driveway tonight ,she said &quot;Mom, don&#39;t ever <br/>
put them in school&quot;<br/>
<br/>
~Marcia..who is so happy she has the support of ALL her children<br/>
