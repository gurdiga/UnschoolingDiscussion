 ***I see that I can loosen up and watch them<br/>
become who they are without constant surveillance.  It<br/>
has made an incredible difference in<br/>
homeschooling--every day unfolds so much more<br/>
harmoniously now. ***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s wonderful.   It&#39;s as liberating for the parents as it is for the<br/>
children when life together is a happy partnership.<br/>
<br/>
***On the other hand, what I find difficult about this<br/>
list is how often a power struggle develops that just<br/>
seems to go and on and on.***<br/>
<br/>
Is it really a power struggle when only one participant is struggling?<br/>
When there is a real disagreement, the folks who have a lot of time<br/>
invested in helping others continue to try to reach out.   That can look<br/>
like fueling the fire but when it&#39;s been the goal of someone for years to<br/>
help facilitate understanding it&#39;s not really reasonable to expect them<br/>
to just shut up and let a misunderstanding fester.   <br/>
I admire people who step in and keep trying to explain a situation when<br/>
someone is clearly not seeing it.   I can&#39;t do that.  I get too impatient<br/>
and Joyce would have to smack me.   But others here are more patient and<br/>
continue to believe there&#39;s a way to reach out.    Good for them!   Maybe<br/>
the one involved in the conflict won&#39;t come to any peaceful understanding<br/>
but someone lurking might be getting something they need, might hear that<br/>
one thing that can make the lights come on for them.   That&#39;d be worth<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
***If new people don&#39;t feel free to express doubts and<br/>
concerns along the way, they may very well give up <br/>
prematurely.  There is a lot of deconditioning that<br/>
has to take place in unschooling, obviously, and it<br/>
may take some time to &quot;get it&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
People (not just new people!)  can talk about their doubts and concerns<br/>
all they need to.   Almost everyone here went to school and had to<br/>
overcome some kind of schoolish conditioning.    Being mean and<br/>
emotionally immature is not recommend but it happens and eventually the<br/>
topic moves on to something better.   <br/>
<br/>
One thing to remember if you&#39;re new is that most questions get answered<br/>
over and over again every few weeks.   Not everyone will respond at first<br/>
if they&#39;ve just burned themselves out in the last weeks trying to explain<br/>
or encourage.   You might have to ask again, you might have to wait a bit<br/>
but it&#39;s not that a poster or a question is being ignored.   Don&#39;t take<br/>
it personally, it&#39;s just the timing.  <br/>
<br/>
Things will lighten up if you hang around awhile.  And really there&#39;s a<br/>
lot of learning can happen during these times when it just seems like<br/>
bickering. <br/>
