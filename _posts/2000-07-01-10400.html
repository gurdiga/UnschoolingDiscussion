                                      Hi Annette,  You might try the <br/>
www.chumbo.com site.  They have a lot of software, and special offers, too.  <br/>
For example, they are offering free software on specially marked boxes of <br/>
Cheerios, and Chex cereals.  We just ordered software for my almost 6 yo, and <br/>
paid $1.99 to cover the shipping, and that was it.  (We had purchased 3 boxes <br/>
of the cereal, of course, to qualify for the offer, but that&#39;s ok, b/c the <br/>
kids eat it anyway.)  Hope you find something!  ~Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080897283">You can also borrow software from most libraries to see if it is right for <br/>
you. And, if you go to the web sites of most of the big software companies <br/>
they have free downloads. These are usually only a portion of the game on <br/>
the CD, but often they have enough to let you know if this is something your <br/>
child will use and enjoy rather than another &#39;bargain buy&#39; that ends up in <br/>
drawer gathering dust.<br/>
<br/>
It also saves me when the kids see a new software title and want me to buy <br/>
it-if we have to go look for it on the internet and try it out, it stops <br/>
alot of those impulse buying urges.<br/>
