<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018121770">Our daughter Ariana moved from baby to todler with her share of the <br/>
usual bumps and scraped knees.  On these occasions, I&#39;d hold out my <br/>
arms and say <br/>
&quot;Come see me.&quot; <br/>
She&#39;d crawl into my lap, we&#39;d cuddle, and I&#39;d say <br/>
&quot;Are you my girl?&quot;<br/>
She&#39;d nod her head, this time, with a smile.  And I&#39;d end with <br/>
&quot;And I love you forever, for always, and no matter what!&quot;<br/>
With a giggle and a hug, she was off and ready for her next challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Ariana is now 4 1/2.  We&#39;ve continued &quot;come see me&quot; time for scraped <br/>
knees and bruised feelings, for good mornings, and good nights.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, I had &quot;one of those days&quot;.  I was tired, cranky, and <br/>
overextended taking care of our four year old, twin teenage boys, and <br/>
a home business.  Each phone call or knock at the door brought <br/>
another full day&#39;s worth of work that needed to be done immediately!  <br/>
I reached my breaking point in the afternoon and went into my room <br/>
for a good cry.<br/>
<br/>
Ariana soon came to my side and said, &quot;Come see me.&quot;  She curled up <br/>
beside me, put her sweet little hands on my damp cheeks and <br/>
said, &quot;Are you my Mommy?&quot;<br/>
Between my tears, I nodded my head yes.  &quot;My sweetie beetie mommie?&quot;<br/>
I nodded my head and smiled.  &quot;And I love you forever, for always, <br/>
and no matter what!&quot;  A giggle, a big hug, and I was off and ready <br/>
for my next challenge.             Jeanette Lisefski<br/>
