&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you think I should tell them up front that I don&#39;t plan on making <br/>
&gt;my kids do anything they don&#39;t want to do or that the girls may quit <br/>
&gt;if they are not into it?  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Usually for me, that issue is handled on a case-by-case basis.  I don&#39;t <br/>
send Will in alone to certain kinds of classes.  I volunteer if I have <br/>
to (Zoo Academy), and then I run interference for him.  I either quietly <br/>
tell him he doesn&#39;t have to do that sheet, or suggest a way to do it <br/>
that would be more palatable, or I suggest to the teacher/instructor <br/>
another way.  At times, I&#39;ve quietly stated his options to *him* in <br/>
response to a direct question by the teacher/instructor, subtley daring <br/>
her to impose her will on him through me.  That has had to happen more <br/>
than once, unfortunately.  I freaked out on this list over the Zoo <br/>
Academy pre-homework earlier this year, and it was all for naught.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been doing this kind of thing all Will&#39;s life, and I don&#39;t know where my <br/>
head was.<br/>
<br/>
He participates in a lot of things without me now.  He knows his <br/>
options.  I wouldn&#39;t necessarily tell the woman who&#39;s organizing the <br/>
silk road thing what your children&#39;s options are, but I&#39;d make sure your <br/>
kids knew them, and I would be prepared to deflect any criticism or <br/>
conflict over it.<br/>
