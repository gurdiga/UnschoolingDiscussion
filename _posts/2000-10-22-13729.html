<h4>The White&#39;s</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447555886">Hi Cheryl,<br/>
My family & I just went to the Ren Fair in Charlotte, NC last weekend.  It<br/>
was, as usual, wonderful.  Many participants AND festival goers dress up,<br/>
both adults & children.  Sometimes you see entire families in costume, other<br/>
times just the kids or just the adults.  My kids wore their cloaks and my<br/>
son took his sword & belt.  As it is still quite warm here in the south,<br/>
they shed those extras before lunch!<br/>
<br/>
This is the only Ren fair we&#39;ve been to, there are LOTS of shows, elephant &<br/>
camel rides, lots of kid&#39;s activities like bows & arrows, candle making,<br/>
play areas, paintball, walk thru maze, a ride which simulates jousting,<br/>
other rides which are pushed (not electric).  There are lots of performances<br/>
in the &quot;mall&quot; like dancing, juggling, photo opportunities, musical<br/>
performances, etc.  There are 3 jousts each day.  I cannot recommend it<br/>
enough, WE LOVE IT.  Once word of warning, it can be expensive.  Some things<br/>
like the shows and the joust are free.  Most of the things the kids want to<br/>
do are $2-$5 each, which can add up.  The food is great, a bit pricey, and<br/>
usually a long line to wait in.  But all worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
