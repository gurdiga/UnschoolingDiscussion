<div id="ygrps-yiv-461969183">Dear Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Having spent some younger years amid Bible Belters, I&#39;d say it really depends <br/>
on YOUR particular community. Some are more accepting of things than others. <br/>
FI, if they don&#39;t do Halloween there, it&#39;s a big clue that they may have <br/>
objections to any mention of magic, sorcery, otherworldly beings (gnomes, <br/>
fairies, etc.) and the like. This would leave out a lot of the magic-based <br/>
fantasy games (including D&D and the collectable card games Magic, Legend of <br/>
the Five Rings and the new Harry Potter stuff). Some have objections to <br/>
fantasy and imaginative stuff altogether. Some have objections to any <br/>
war-like content. Some object to the use of dice or cards in any context. <br/>
Some don&#39;t care as long as you don&#39;t cuss, chaw or drink while you&#39;re doing <br/>
it. I guess you all would need to make the call on how far you are willing to <br/>
go to cater to their beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of decent history-based games like Civilization, History <br/>
of the World (now out of print, but an excellent game if you can find it), <br/>
Diplomacy, Settlers of Catan, Shogun (I think now called Samurai Sword, not <br/>
sure), Broadsides and Boarding Parties, Axis and Allies, Kingmaker (I think), <br/>
etc. These are not necessarily role-playing, more strategic/tactical, but <br/>
role-playing elements can be added. And of course, all the Avalon Hill games <br/>
like Panzer Blitz, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Two easy-to-learn card games (although they&#39;re cards, and you may run into <br/>
trouble with that unless you can explain it&#39;s more like Uno than gambling ;^) <br/>
are &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (by GMT Games) and &quot;Great Dalmuti&quot; (I think by Wizards of the <br/>
Coast, although that&#39;s the only &quot;wizard&quot; content ;^). Both of these can <br/>
include a good deal of roleplaying in the course of play and have the <br/>
advantage of appealing to and being suitable for a broad range of ages. Both <br/>
also have really excellent art and have stimulated a lot of <br/>
research/discussion in our family.<br/>
<br/>
Another historical route that involves research and cool art is miniatures <br/>
wargaming -- little scale armies based on historical armies -- which veteran <br/>
gamers often classify under the title &quot;Ancients.&quot; One of the easiest and <br/>
satisfying (i.e., games don&#39;t have to drag on for days) systems I&#39;ve run into <br/>
is DBA (De Bellis Antiquitatis). Players research and paint their figures (or <br/>
can buy them painted, natch) and then pit the armies against one another <br/>
under a set of easily-grasped rules. This game, like Risk, involves dice, so <br/>
again, there may be some resistance in your community even though this isn&#39;t <br/>
directly gambling. There are a lot of great websites online devoted to this <br/>
game, but one of my favourites is my friend&#39;s: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~kuijt/dba.html">http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~kuijt/dba.html</a> -- there is also an online version <br/>
of DBA (called DBAOL ;^) which is really excellent: www.dbaol.com -- also <br/>
various clubs. If you have any DBA questions, I know that any of the links <br/>
you can find from the Kuijt address above will win you a tonne of encouraging <br/>
info, and the maintainers of the websites will happily talk your ears off <br/>
about it. :^)<br/>
<br/>
Pendragon is a D&D alternate which is (roughly) based in Arthurian legend. <br/>
Supposedly less hack-and-slash, more roleplaying. Ditto Prince Valiant, which <br/>
is set against the background of the comic strip. Both emphasize playing the <br/>
character of chivalrous knight. Heroes and Champions are both roleplaying <br/>
games that are based on comic book superheroes. Again, fantasy, but maybe <br/>
more palatable... One future-based game is Traveller; there are others of <br/>
this ilk.<br/>
<br/>
Ooo! I just remembered a couple of somewhat-reality-based roleplaying games <br/>
we used to play -- one was called Boot Hill, and was set in the Wild West. <br/>
Still involved killing, however. But no magic. One bullet could kill. There <br/>
was another one that was technology-based -- involved making up gee-whiz <br/>
contraptions like Q does in James Bond movies and having characters &quot;learn&quot; <br/>
skills. I think it was called Top Secret. It was fantasy in the same way all <br/>
spy thrillers are, but not magic. Again, prolly involved killing though. <br/>
<br/>
All killing-based games can be converted to defeating- or stunning-games, we <br/>
discovered. Just takes imagination and willingness to fiddle with words. <br/>
There&#39;s a roleplaying game called Toon (or maybe Toons?) where you don&#39;t die, <br/>
just get hit in the face w/ pies, etc. <br/>
<br/>
And if all else fails, your kids can make up their own roleplaying game, <br/>
perhaps based on Narnia (admittedly very otherworldly, but often accepted <br/>
where others are not because of C.S. Lewis & underlying Christian content of <br/>
series) or Pilgrim&#39;s Progress. Or convert D&D to be reality-based. Instead of <br/>
encountering goblins, perhaps a very bad headache? Do you have aspirin along? <br/>
No? Well, you succumb! :^D Dragons might be a loss of faith -- which can be <br/>
fought off by quoting the right bible verse! OK, so perhaps it looks like I&#39;m <br/>
reaching here. But my brother and I honestly went down paths like these <br/>
sometimes in order to play with kids in our community. I don&#39;t know how far <br/>
you guys are willing to go to engage those around you in play. Some of the <br/>
best games we played were ones we made up ourselves (once you figure out how <br/>
to develop a fair &quot;universe&quot; [i.e., system of play], possibilities are <br/>
endless).<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m leaving out vast piles of obvious suggestions I should be making, <br/>
but I&#39;d better stop now before this becomes a novel.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503425728">wow, you certainly did come up with some great ideas. I did not answer <br/>
because I think of anything. :(<br/>
<br/>
Our homeschool groups here are made up of the &quot;Halloween is sinful&quot; <br/>
Christians. I am not putting anyone down if this is the way they believe I <br/>
just am not sure what to call this sect. When we went to pe classes for a <br/>
while the kids and I were afraid to say much of anything to anyone because we <br/>
never knew what was accepted and by whom. To some tv was not acceptable. To <br/>
others tv was ok but only videos. To many the internet was a sin. My daughter <br/>
was loved Twain then and we were told that his books should be burned. Once I <br/>
was standing there looking at a catalog of posters of Native Americans and a <br/>
lady walked up and gave me a lecture on the &quot;dirty heathens.&quot; It was at this <br/>
time the kids and I decided that the pe classes were not worth it. The kids <br/>
took up bmx racing and we went to the track from then on instead of pe. It <br/>
was better for us to move on than to try and fit in. It is hard to always <br/>
bite ones tongue to get along all the time. I hope you have better luck than <br/>
we did. <br/>
<br/>
There certainly have been a lot of good ideas here.<br/>

involve some (but not a huge amount) of reading and maybe an element of <br/>

he can get through them without reading.  I suspect he could get a lot more <br/>
out of those games if he did read all the messages and stuff.  I know I <br/>
could learn to play them myself and then he&#39;d see more possibilities, but <br/>
I&#39;m just not a game player.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really like the Civilization series.  Civ 3 is new this fall.  It<br/>
starts out with one&#39;s civilization at the beginning city building level<br/>
and one develops a civilization, its technology, its military, etc.<br/>
You choose one of the existing Earth civilizations to build.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure how many they have in this version.  In Civ 2 they had about 40.<br/>
I hope Civ 3 is under the tree for me this year!<br/>
<br/>
My DH and older son liked Europa Universalis.  This goes for 300 years<br/>
and starts in 1492 - it involves settling and exploring the &quot;New World&quot;.<br/>
Rob says it stays fairly accurate to history.  For example no country<br/>
gets an explorer until the year that country actually did start exploring.<br/>
So Spain and Portugal are the only ones with explorers at the start.<br/>
Rob played Turkey and he said it was fascinating.  The downside for him<br/>
was that it was slow - he played a lot of hours and still had only gotten<br/>
to the late 1500s! The second version of that game is out this fall too;<br/>
my older son wants it.  I don&#39;t know what is different about this version.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t really have an element of history, but he is learning bunches about geography and also flying. Not only does he fly all over the US, but also all over the world. There are landmarks you can see when you fly over them. Yesterday he flew over the coliseum in Rome, Italy.  The day before 9-11, he flew his cessna in between the world trade towers. How ironic and sad that the next day they were gone, just like that.<br/>
He also loves playing Age of Empires.<br/>
