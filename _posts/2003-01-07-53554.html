 right now!!<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

Thanks so much!! What a great article. And you probably didn&#39;t <br/>
know we have a family obsession with India. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My favorite quote: &quot;I&#39;m not even going to suggest that we use this <br/>
[technique] for adults. The only reaction we got from adults was, <br/>
&quot;What on earth is this for? Why is there no one here to teach us <br/>
something? How are we ever going to use this?&quot; I contend that <br/>
by the time we are 16, we are taught to want teachers, taught that <br/>
we cannot learn anything without teachers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Glad to have seen this in advance.<br/>
