 </span></blockquote>Since your bringing this into the discussion......<br/>
I do not see how this belief comes from Jesus.  He taught love,<br/>
unconditional love, not vengeance.  There have been many peoples who never<br/>
had an opportunity to know Jesus.  These people were also created by the<br/>
Almighty.<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you may be one who belives only in the Word in the Bible....so<br/>
I&#39;ll ask where it says that.  Though it doesn&#39;t say anywhere (the Bible)<br/>
that it is to be the ONLY and final authority on love.  Why wwould their be<br/>
and end to prophesies?   And bibles are different....is mine &quot;wrong&quot; since<br/>
it contains more books?  Are the Dead Sea Scrolls meaningless if they<br/>
weren&#39;t found at the time some Bibles were being compiled?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392377974">This is where I have a problem with the bible.  It gives contradicting info<br/>
from book to book on some issues.  And then there are all the translations<br/>
which are, in many instances, way out in left field from the original.<br/>
