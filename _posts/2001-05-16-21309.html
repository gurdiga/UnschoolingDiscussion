<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798977213">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t e-mail for a while.  I&#39;ve been working diligently on my home<br/>
based business.<br/>
The homeschooling conference went great.  I attended two unschooling<br/>
workshops and one planning your own curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
The result has been that we block out at least 2 hours in the morning<br/>
for &quot;school&quot; and I don&#39;t answer the phone.  Of course &quot;school&quot; takes on<br/>
many forms.  We usually have 15 minute blocks of free play (mostly<br/>
legoes and cars).  I use a day planner frequently so I&#39;ve started my son<br/>
on one.  Basically it&#39;s an regular blank sheet of paper with 5 days of<br/>
the week blocked out.  I also have three codes that go next to tasks.<br/>
check for task done, x for task deleted and arrow for task forwarded. My<br/>
son has been interest in calendars and learning days of the week.  When<br/>
we are done with a task we simply check what is next.  We also list the<br/>
new things we have done and he chooses how to label it.   We saw some<br/>
folks measuring for a new street and he decided to call it work<br/>
builders.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s decided he wants to continue to get &quot;Top Secret Adventures&quot; from<br/>
Highlights.  I need to help him with it since it&#39;s designed for readers<br/>
and he&#39;s really a pre-reader.  A couple of times the neighbor girl who<br/>
is 9, schooled and a child of teachers came over to help him with it.<br/>
She was trying to get him to recognize sounds letters make.  She tried<br/>
to get him to say the sound a &quot;B&quot; makes &quot;buh&quot;.  With a mischievous look<br/>
in his eye, my son responded by saying bzzz.  That&#39;s the sound a &quot;B&quot;<br/>
makes.  He likes to make his letter S with a snake head,  he made his P,<br/>
pee and his B had wings.  When he wants his name to be said loudly he<br/>
makes the letters bigger.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it seems to working well.  We are holding him more accountable<br/>
for the things he wants to find out and reminding him what he said he<br/>
wanted to do.  We are also encouraging follow through, including<br/>
clean-up.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Success,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676572249">Wow, Sherry!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your son is of the &quot;visual&quot;<br/>
intelligence variety! (referring to &quot;multiple<br/>
intelligences...my &quot;thing&quot; right now) Anyway, my son<br/>
learned how to read well, i believe, with Highlights<br/>
&quot;Puzzlemania&quot;. &quot;Top Secreats&quot; is cool too...my 5 yr<br/>
old loves &quot;Which Way USA&quot; too. <br/>
<br/>
Peace, Gina<br/>
