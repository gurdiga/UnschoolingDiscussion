&gt; <br/>
&gt; He might if sugar has been a rare and restricted thing.   It works that<br/>
&gt; way for some people.  If a thing has been very limited, when it finally<br/>
&gt; becomes available it takes a while for them to feel like they&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; enough. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He wouldn&#39;t eat sugar all day every day, forever. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son has lived without restrictions on sweets, TV, movies or reading<br/>
&gt; material.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s a recent story. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Saturday we were expecting some friends and I made a chocolate cake.  <br/>
&gt; Dylan had one piece of cake that day and hasn&#39;t had any since.   It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Tuesday and I still have half a cake.  It was a good cake too!&lt;g&gt;  No one<br/>
&gt; here is desperate for sweets.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tonight he asked for brown rice and broccoli.  We have pop and potato<br/>
&gt; chips in the house, corn chips and cake, but he hasn&#39;t selected those<br/>
&gt; things.  He&#39;s never selected them steadily or to the exclusion of<br/>
&gt; everything else.  Why would he?   With lots of choices why would he limit<br/>
&gt; himself to one thing? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You clearly care about your family&#39;s well being.  Thinking about their<br/>
&gt; ability to care about their own well being and happiness is a good thing<br/>
&gt; too.   There is no reason to assume children want to have less happy or<br/>
&gt; healthy lives than we hope they will have.  <br/>

Julian has never had restrictions about what he can or can&#39;t eat, and there&#39;s <br/>
generally sugar and other snacks in the house.  At the very least, Beth works <br/>
for Girl Scouts, so we always have a box or two around of GS cookies. There <br/>
are also always fruits and veggies available. And Julian has always been (well, <br/>
since he was 3-4) an ethical vegetarian.<br/>
<br/>
He is also a sugar maniac, and will, in fact, eat sugar all day long. He also <br/>
eats other stuff, and it probably all works out to a not-unhealthy diet. If <br/>
he has a good filling meal at a restaurant he&#39;ll turn down dessert, even if <br/>
they&#39;re really good. But he frankly has a strong preference for sweet desserts <br/>
over fruits and veggies. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, presentation is everything to this kid. If we hand him a <br/>
plate with things artfully arranged, he&#39;ll give us an enthusiastic, &quot;Ooooo!&quot;  <br/>
This could be a peanut butter sandwich. <br/>
<br/>
Overall, I&#39;d say it works not restrict foods in any way. But he does eat lots <br/>
of sugar and plenty of dairy. And he&#39;s rarely sick and has no food allergies.<br/>
