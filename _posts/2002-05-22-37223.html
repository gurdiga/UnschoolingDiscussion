<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299871029">I am doing the Digest thing so I won&#39;t get into individual stuff, but I love<br/>
this site. You are all so bright and positive. Thank you. Someone had<br/>
mentioned the first born being the &quot;perfectionist&quot; and that was my<br/>
experience too, but I must say my third (of four) is the same. Though I do<br/>
not believe in astrology, they were born 9 years and 2 days apart. Hmm. At<br/>
any rate, it is diffiucult to soothe and reassure a child who is determined<br/>
to &quot;judge&quot; himself and his own work. I kept trying to see how I might have<br/>
influenced my children to believe that they had to be perfect and<br/>
knowledgebale the first time doing something new. I just am not that kind of<br/>
person, the point is they were. I worried so much when David was young about<br/>
where this came from. He is now 18 and is still very driven. It has, however<br/>
served him. I don&#39;t like to say that I like a competitive, perfectionistic<br/>
son, but it seems to do him well. I would love for him to try (and fail and<br/>
be ok with it) new things but that is just not who he was born to be. I<br/>
guess my point is, we do our best to influence our kids and keep the<br/>
pressure off of them to perform, but it seems to be the nature of some<br/>
children and it doesn&#39;t matter what we say or do. That is who they are.<br/>
<br/>
When David was little, I remember him drawing or writing and scribbling all<br/>
over the paper and tearing it up if it wasn&#39;t the way he had intended. The<br/>
sheer force and anger and disapointment in him upset me. It didn&#39;t seem as<br/>
important to him. He threw his fit and started over. It was me who it<br/>
bothered, not him. Maybe I am nuts, and am in deep need of therapy, but he<br/>
seemed to be ok with his &quot;tanturms of perfection.&quot; I think until it no<br/>
longer sereves him, he will continue to do it his perfect way. I think I<br/>
just had to let go at some point and realize he has his lessons to learn,<br/>
and they were not my lessons, nor my experience. I had to let him do his own<br/>
life and learn for himself. I had nothing to offer on the subject of self<br/>
imposed perfectionism. It is interesting how our children become their own<br/>
people, and often they have such different ways of expressing themselves.<br/>
