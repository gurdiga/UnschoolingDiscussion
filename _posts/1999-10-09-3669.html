<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257699013">I am sorely tempted to go into the consulting business (as a nurse) just to help<br/>
people out when they have to go to hospital.  The sometimes tyrannical arrogance<br/>

Modern Medical Mistakes, documents a litany of absurd treatments, theories etc.<br/>
that medicine has advocated in the last fifty years which have proven to be at<br/>
best useless and at worst killed numbers of people.  All of these were advocated<br/>
with the same &quot;We know exactly what we are doing and anyone who questions us is<br/>
an obstructionist, ignorant, non-expert who should mind their own business.&quot;<br/>
attitude which still permeates medicine, in so many ways, today. This topic<br/>
really sets me off.   It is especially difficult for parents to resist.  In part<br/>
because they (medical establishment) have the force of law and the power of<br/>
priesthood on their side.<br/>
<br/>
We had a recent experience with a bee sting that would have resulted in our 6<br/>
year old being on IV antibiotics if my wife had not stood fast and said &quot;No<br/>
antibiotics until the results of a blood test showing the white count.&quot;  I,<br/>
being, immersed in hospital culture and seeing the very worst things that ever<br/>
happen to anybody would cave into their pressure much quicker if it weren&#39;t for<br/>
my dw&#39;s cooler head and absolutely iron resolve.  We got the blood results back<br/>
and all that red, hot, swollen, foot was not infection but allergic reaction.<br/>
So we just treated it conservatively with benadryl and avoided antibiotics all<br/>
together.  There is (in my mind) a place for the judicious use of the medical<br/>
model.  It works wonderfully for some specific things.  It always has a price<br/>
and sometimes we don&#39;t fully understand just what that price is because we all,<br/>
collectively are rather ignorant about reality in spite of our pretensions<br/>

There I feel a little better.<br/>

&gt; I wish I had known about the home birthing earlier....though by our third<br/>
&gt; child I knew,  but decided against it ( I just couldn&#39;t figure out how it<br/>
&gt; would work,  though didn&#39;t explore it thoroughly).  Our family physician&#39;s<br/>
&gt; wife home birthed most of their children.  (They also homeschool,  so he is<br/>
&gt; a &#39;true&#39;  physician for us!)<br/>
&gt; Anyway,  Joel,  your post reminded me of my hospital experience with my<br/>
&gt; second child.....I was there less than 24 hrs,  and that seemed TOO long!!<br/>
&gt; I could hardly wait to get put of there and back to the peace of our<br/>
&gt; home...with our family together.<br/>
&gt;     And since I got on this hospital treatment topic.....Our toddler was<br/>
&gt; recently hospitalized for croup.  I battled all night with the resident who<br/>
&gt; wanted to run a whole myriad of ridiculous tests to rule out every rare and<br/>
&gt; unlikely disease in existence!!  And he denied my simple request to have a<br/>
&gt; humidifier to help her breathe.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;GRRRR!!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I literally had to fight off the phlebotomist (I can&#39;t remember why they<br/>
&gt; wanted to collect blood...);  I had to refuse the test repeatedly and<br/>
&gt; finally,  pulled my daughter out of her hands.  The nurse also became my<br/>
&gt; enemy rather than my daughter&#39;s advocate......She claimed to me that she&#39;d<br/>
&gt; try to convey my wishes to the resident,  yet she advocated for him....and<br/>
&gt; snuck the phlebotomist back in the room at 5:30 a.m. when I had fallen<br/>
&gt; asleep.  I saw her note that said I agreed to have the test in the early<br/>
&gt; a.m.  -- which I did not.  I was able to confront her before she left her<br/>
&gt; shift that morning.   PHEW!  It&#39;s exhausting in the retelling,  too!!<br/>
&gt;     Well,  thanks for listening everyone.....sorry to be such a lurker<br/>
&gt; around here...I have so many opinions I&#39;d like to contribute to these lively<br/>
&gt; discussions  Alas,  I have committed myself to a personal fitness program,<br/>
&gt; so my mornings are currently devoted to brisk 45  minute walks .... I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; barely able to read my e-mail,  much less resapond!! ;-)<br/>
&gt; Good night all....<br/>

An essential component of ANY first aid kit should be Activated Charcoal.  <br/>
Bee Stings, (even for those who are highly allergic) mosquito bites, spider <br/>
bites, etc can all be treated IMMEDIATELY with activated charcoal made into a <br/>
paste. (keep a small bottle of water too).  The activated charcoal absorbs <br/>
the poison and gives immediate relief from pain or itching as well.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85454844">I know I said in an earlier post that my nurses were great, but there was only one,<br/>
out of all the nurses I had with all 3 births, who I certainly could&#39;ve done w/o.<br/>
She missed the vein in my wrist the 1st try to put in an IV and put it in the<br/>
other.  Then every time she took my blood pressure it was on the same arm I had the<br/>
IV.  It was so painful.  And I don&#39;t know if that has anything to do with this, but<br/>
the wrist that this all occured with is still very painful and very weak.<br/>
<br/>
This same nurse was told not to give me too much petocin (sp?) and to monitor me on<br/>
it, but she jacked it up every hour until my contractions were not deminishing at<br/>
all.  They would spike up and go half way down and then spike up again, one after<br/>
another.  The midwife was irrate when she came in and saw this.  Thankfully, they<br/>
turned it down and by this time that nurses shift was over and she left.  But<br/>
everyone else was awesome!<br/>
<br/>
 With my first, I was 19.  I had gone through lamaze, but when it came down to it,<br/>
the pain numbed my mind to where I was forgetting and refusing to do what I had<br/>
learned.  I wouldn&#39;t breathe with the contractions, I held my breath and cried.  One<br/>
of the nurses, who was about 6ft tall and over 200lbs., got right in my face and<br/>
said, &quot;BREATHE!!!&quot;.  That was all it took!  I breathed with every one after that and<br/>
did fine.  I thank God for that nurse!!! :-)<br/>
