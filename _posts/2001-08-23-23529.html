<div id="ygrps-yiv-354757153">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list, and also new to the Portland (Oregon) area.  I&#39;m wondering if there exists a playgroup for younger children--mine is 13 months, and right now there are no kids around for him to play with.  I&#39;m really inspired by the unschooling philosophy and I hope my son will be too! Are there any playgroups for this age group already formed, or is anyone interested in starting one with us?<br/>
