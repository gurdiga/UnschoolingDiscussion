<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332724737">Q: How many homeschoolers does it take to screw in a light bulb? <br/>
<br/>
A: Gasp! Is it legal to change your own? <br/>
<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t you let a trained professional do it? Won&#39;t your little lamp<br/>
be brighter if someone who studied for four years (after barely being<br/>
able to turn on their own<br/>
lamp) changes your light bulb? What if you screw it in wrong? What if<br/>
you leave something out? Don&#39;t you think you should give your little<br/>
nursery lamp a chance to<br/>
be part of a huge, glowing marquee or chandelier? Bulbs do need to hang<br/>
in groups, you know. <br/>
<br/>
Besides, why do you think light bulbs come in multi packs? You don&#39;t<br/>
just go out and get a single light bulb! If one light bulb needs fixing,<br/>
then you know the others<br/>
are ready for it, too. Give your professional a 12 pack and let him/her<br/>
change them all at once. It&#39;s much more efficient and gets you on a<br/>
schedule with all your light<br/>
fixtures. And yes, I know you will end up sending some perfectly good<br/>
light bulbs to the trash that way, but on the whole it&#39;s best. Don&#39;t<br/>
regret the ones that are lost<br/>
to the dump. They were probably pretty dim anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Look, I sent my lamps to the shop for light-bulb changing and my lamps<br/>
work okay, don&#39;t they? Oh, well, except for that three-way lamp in the<br/>
living room which<br/>
got a stupid 40 watt, low-lumens bulb put in when it should have gotten<br/>
a three way bulb with up to 200 watts. I was a little peeved at that at<br/>
first, but I just put the<br/>
lamp over in the corner where I never sit to read, so it&#39;s okay. <br/>
