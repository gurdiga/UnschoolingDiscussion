<div id="ygrps-yiv-840799714"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot;Eileen M.&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ravensegg@...">ravensegg@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, under normal circumstances, breast milk is<br/>
&gt; designed for babies, and the female human breast is<br/>
&gt; designed to deliver that milk.  But for many reasons<br/>
&gt; some babies do not thrive on breast milk.  They may be<br/>
&gt; (as my son was) lactose intolerant *and* allergic to<br/>
&gt; milk.  Their mother may be eating something to which<br/>
&gt; they are allergic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, but the mother can stop eating what they are allergic to. Both my<br/>
kids are allergic to milk. Well, I haven&#39;t had any dairy products in a long<br/>
time, and I sure do miss my ice cream :-) but it&#39;s really not that big of an<br/>
issue. All that means is that *cow&#39;s* milk is not beneficial to babies, not<br/>
that mother&#39;s milk isn&#39;t. The only disease I am aware of that necessitates<br/>
total weaning is Galactosemia, an extremely rare metabolic disorder that<br/>
necessitates that the child be on a special diet for life. In this case, it<br/>
isn&#39;t so much of a case of mother&#39;s milk not being beneficial, but that the<br/>
baby has a genetic disease that prevents them from receiving proper<br/>
nutrition from many different sources.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They may be severely hypoglycemic<br/>
&gt; (again, as my son was) and the milk simply doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have enough sugars in it to keep them alive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>According to LLL:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Symptomatic hypoglycemia in newborns is largely due to delayed or<br/>
inadequate feeding and is more likely to occur when mother and baby are<br/>
separated after birth. Some newborns are given sugar water on the erroneous<br/>
assumption that this will prevent hypoglycemia. Instead, giving glucose<br/>
water causes a sudden rise in the blood glucose levels, which in turn<br/>
stimulates the secretion of insulin by the pancreas. The high level of<br/>
insulin results in an equally sudden drop in glucose levels. It is<br/>
interesting to note that the treatment for hypoglycemia in adults is small,<br/>
frequent, high-protein meals. That is exactly what the baby gets when he is<br/>
allowed to breastfeed on demand from birth.<br/>
<br/>
Immediate and frequent feedings of colostrum, preferably ten to twelve<br/>
feedings per day in the first few days, stabilize blood glucose levels.<br/>
Undiluted human milk is the best food, particularly for preterm infants. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In some hospital settings, newborns are at risk for developing hypoglycemia<br/>
even after an uneventful labor and delivery. Babies who are not fed soon<br/>
after birth, are left uncovered in a nursery warmer, or are left in a<br/>
nursery to cry, are under stress. As a result they use up their stores of<br/>
glucose and are at risk for developing hypoglycemia. It is important to put<br/>
the baby to the breast immediately after birth, make sure the baby is kept<br/>
warm and dry (preferably in the mother&#39;s arms), and not allow long<br/>
separations when the baby may be left to cry. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
and finally:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The best way to stabilize blood sugar and prevent hypoglycemia in all<br/>
infants is prompt and frequent feedings of colostrum and human milk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even if supplements need to be given - glucose, etc. the baby can still<br/>
benefit from breastfeeding. The supplements are a small addition to the<br/>
millions of beneficial properties of the breastmilk.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They may<br/>
&gt; be too weak to suck.  Their mothers may be unable, due<br/>
&gt; to stress, nutritional problems etc, to provide<br/>
&gt; sufficient breastmilk.  They may need a different<br/>
&gt; balance of nutrients for a variety of health reasons<br/>
&gt; than breast milk can provide.  They may be too<br/>
&gt; underdeveloped to process breastmilk.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But as per the original statements, all these babies would *benefit* from<br/>
breastfeeding. If they&#39;re too weak to suck, they can be supplemented with an<br/>
eyedropper and breastmilk until they gain their ability to suck -<br/>
breastfeeding (left undisturbed) is a relationship of many years, not just<br/>
the first few days, weeks, or months. If the mothers are unable to provide<br/>
sufficient breastmilk, that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother problem. Obviously the mothers<br/>
should be supported to the degree that they can provide breastmilk, but if<br/>
not that still doesn&#39;t mean that the baby wouldn&#39;t benefit from it, just<br/>
that the mom can&#39;t provide it. In many cases, a donor mother can provide<br/>
breastmilk (which can even be pasteurized) - this is less rare than you&#39;d<br/>
think. I&#39;ve both donated my breastmilk (to an adopted baby) and wet nursed a<br/>
friend&#39;s baby when she was in the hospital. If breastfeeding was more<br/>
supported, these alternates would be more common.<br/>
As for babies needing a different balance of nutrients than breastmilk<br/>
provides, the baby would still benefit from breastfeeding, perhaps enhanced<br/>
by the addition of whatever else breastmilk would be &quot;lacking&quot;. As<br/>
breastmilk contains over 400 ingredients that scientists have yet to<br/>
identify, and infant formulas contain about 20, I&#39;d be pretty suspect of<br/>
someone claiming that a formula could provide what breastmilk could not<br/>
(unless of course in the case of those rare disorders where the baby isn&#39;t<br/>
able to process some things, or where the baby needs something specific,<br/>
like glucose drops). In any case, it&#39;s a simple matter to supplement the<br/>
baby&#39;s diet in addition to providing the breastmilk. As for a baby being<br/>
underdeveloped to process breastmilk, research in the last decade has found<br/>
that this is rarely the case. The mother&#39;s milk actually *changes*<br/>
dramatically when a baby is born prematurely and is ideally suited for the<br/>
premature infant. Scientists now realize that breastmilk is the best food,<br/>
even for preemies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The majority of babies in the NICU my son was in could<br/>
&gt; not use breastmilk for one reason or another.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But this was 11 years ago, right? They have learned a lot about the benefits<br/>
of breastmilk for preemies in the time between then and now. Now mothers<br/>
with babies in the NICU are encouraged to pump and to put the baby to the<br/>
breast. The babies can be fed with eyedroppers or SNS (supplemental nursing<br/>
systems) to prevent nipple confusion. Every mom of a NICU baby that I&#39;ve<br/>
known in the last few years has been encouraged strongly to breastfeed as<br/>
preemies need breastmilk even more than full-term babies.  There is even a<br/>
book out now: &quot;Breastfeeding Your Premature Baby&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And<br/>
&gt; most babies will refuse the breast once they are<br/>
&gt; initiated on a bottle... the bottle provides faster<br/>
&gt; service with less work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the more reason that hospitals and new mothers should be aware that<br/>
there are alternatives to bottle feeding for babies who need supplementing.<br/>
Droppers, cups, tube and finger feeding, and SNS are just some of the<br/>
possibilities that will not induce nipple confusion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But it is a sweeping generality to say that *all*<br/>
&gt; children benefit from breast feeding in infancy.  Some<br/>
&gt; babies would die or fail to thrive from breast<br/>
&gt; feeding, so it is not factually the case that all<br/>
&gt; children benefit from breast feeding in infancy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say other than the genetic disease I mentioned above (in which case the<br/>
baby has a host of problems with food, not just breastmilk), *all* babies<br/>
would benefit from breastfeeding (even if it is just partial breastfeeding).<br/>
Breastmilk benefits babies in a thousand different ways, and the nutritional<br/>
aspect is just one of them. The white blood cells and disease protection,<br/>
the bonding, the suckling promoting healthy jaw development, the anti-cancer<br/>
properties of breastmilk are among the benefits that  a baby would get from<br/>
breastfeeding, even *if* they were among the very rare cases that also<br/>
needed supplementing with some other nutritional additive.  Typically,<br/>
babies that would die or fail to thrive would do so because of lack of<br/>
support and accurate information about breastfeeding.  A lot of that has<br/>
been dispensed by the medical profession in the last few decades of<br/>
dominance by the formula companies (See the book &quot;Milk, Money, and Madness&quot;<br/>
for a thorough treatment of that topic).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Need a lift back onto the soapbox?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, thanks :-)<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons that the breastfeeding soapbox is so important is that so<br/>
much misinformation has been given about breastfeeding. The World Health<br/>
Organization estimates that a *MILLION* babies die every year around the<br/>
world from *lack* of breastfeeding, including a whopping 10,000 here in the<br/>
(supposedly modern) United States. It is vitally important that mothers<br/>
receive accurate information about breastfeeding, and support to do so.<br/>
Fortunately, scientists and medical professionals are just starting to<br/>
realize how important breastfeeding is and how in almost all circumstances<br/>
it is possible and indeed necessary. Maybe someday we will see it supported<br/>
properly. I think it is one of the most vital health issues on this planet.<br/>

&gt; really not that big of an<br/>
&gt; issue. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son was allergic to all milk, including breast<br/>
milk.  I didn&#39;t take dairy while breastfeeding either<br/>
(and a lot of other things as well... I nursed him for<br/>
eighteen months in spite of his colic and problems<br/>
with breastmilk, because on balance I felt that the<br/>
immunity advantages were more important than other<br/>
concerns... his own immune system was dangerously<br/>
suppressed and needed the boost from me), and he was<br/>
still allergic to it.  <br/>
<br/>
All that means is that *cow&#39;s* milk is not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; beneficial to babies, not<br/>

that other situations do not exist.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; According to LLL:<br/>

immediately breastfed, and nearly died of hypoglycemia<br/>
within twenty minutes of birth.  Subsequent breast<br/>
feeding did not solve the problem... instead, he went<br/>
into a comatose state. Being hypoglycemic myself since<br/>
my teens I am quite aware of the glucose issues, and<br/>
of the benefit of small protein meals... we use them<br/>
quite effectively.  That was simply not applicable at<br/>
the time... my child would have died on a pure<br/>
breastfeeding diet, pure and simple. <br/>
<br/>
As per the rest of your arguments; I specifically said<br/>
&#39;breastfed&#39; for a reason.  Even eleven years ago, in<br/>
ancient times, we were quite aware of the benefits of<br/>
colostrum etc.  Feeding breastmilk via eyedropper etc.<br/>
is *not* breastfeeding.  It is bottlefeeding (or<br/>
eyedropperfeeding) with breastmilk.  For most children<br/>
there are benefits to be gained by the actual<br/>
breastfeeding process independent of the benefits of<br/>
the milk itself... but some children do *not* benefit<br/>
from that process, and that was an important part of<br/>
my example.<br/>
<br/>
Generalities just do not apply universally.  There are<br/>
exceptions to every rule, and rigid application of any<br/>
rule to all situations will be doomed to failure. <br/>
Generalities are useful in a *general* way, and are<br/>
necessary if we are to learn things by experience<br/>
(usually the most effective way to learn)... but they<br/>
are a &#39;rule of thumb&#39; deal, not Universal Reality.<br/>

  My three children and I are hypoglycemic (largely due to hyperinsulinemia).  We became severely ill, run-down, hyperacidic, et on frequent protein snacks, as these are acid-producing either in and of themselves or as a by-product of digestion.  We now take green barley juice which neutralizes the blood sugar instantaneously, provides chlorophyll, 92 vitamins and minerals and live enzymes.  When taken before bed it also alkalizes the bloodstream.  We have benefited greatly from this.  My oldest daughter and I will drink it (comes in a powder) with plain water, but the other 2 have a small amount of juice mixed in.<br/>
<br/>
  My girls and I have severe mood swings with the plunging blood sugar - I have followed with interest the spanking thread.  I have always maintained that when &quot;normal&quot; interaction with children does not have the &quot;normal&quot; or customary result, there is usually something else going on, and the customary measures will not work in these situations.  Those who do not have extraordinary children often do not understand why the routine measures they take with great success will not work for everybody else. <br/>

most friends we know with &#39;special&#39; kids find<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094950796">This is an observation, not a flame.  This thread is exactly how &quot;wars&quot;<br/>
start on lists.<br/>
<br/>
No one said that breast feeding wasn&#39;t best, simply that it is not always<br/>
best.  The thread started out about making all encompassing general<br/>
statements, ie. I and others stated that there are always excepts.  Folks<br/>
then got on their soapboxes or high horses or whatever and have gone into<br/>
battle waving the LLL flag to defend the merits of breast feeding.  No one<br/>
is disputing that breast feeding in an ideal world is best.<br/>
<br/>
But (now ain&#39;t there always a &quot;but&quot; &lt;g&gt;), there are no absolutes except that<br/>
life is terminal.  100% of the women in the world cannot successfully<br/>
breastfeed whether they have a proper diet and all the support in the world<br/>
or not.  100% of the babies born do not thrive on breastmilk.  There are<br/>
exceptions to every rule including breastfeeding.  No one was denegrading<br/>
breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, look at what has been printed in rabid defense of breastfeeding,<br/>
&quot;estimates that,&quot; &quot;usually,&quot; &quot;most women can,&quot; &quot;in almost all circumstances&quot;<br/>
and the list goes one.  The examples given, including LLL quotes were<br/>
