<div id="ygrps-yiv-935391660">Well, as I am probably one of the folks causing the stir, my problem was<br/>
with the start &quot;as Christian parents/grandparents&quot; which immediately infers<br/>
that the list is comprised of such only AND, the article itself.  The<br/>
repeated references to Japan as being the problem was definately racist. <br/>
Also, being quite well read in Biblical references (like one would have a<br/>
choice in a family with several ordained ministers &lt;g&gt;) it always bugs the<br/>
h*ll out of me when someone manipulates passages from the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
So, that said, I still think all the hysteria over Pokemon is just that,<br/>
hysteria.  In a couple of years it will be gone just like all the other<br/>
hyped up sell em to the kiddies things.  I mean, what has lasted, Barbie,<br/>
Legos and Hot Wheels, oh and sport trading cards.  Also the rest have come<br/>
and gone once the big money stopped rolling in.<br/>
