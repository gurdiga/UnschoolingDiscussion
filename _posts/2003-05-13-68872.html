<div id="ygrps-yiv-937484510">Hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;m one of those asocial types (thanks Sorcha, I like that much better!!)<br/>
who rarely posts, but enjoy this list IMMENSLEY!  I just wanted to thank<br/>
TreeGoddess for the links below.  It couldn&#39;t have come at a better time,<br/>
when, in my yearly spring cleaning, I come to terms that I have just too<br/>
much junk, and too much attachment.  (for a Naturalist and Artist who has<br/>
Buddhist tendencies , these just aren&#39;t good things!)<br/>
Thank you!!<br/>
