<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128528331">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and so thought I would introduce myself. My name<br/>
is Michele<br/>
and I live in New Zealand with my husband and two daughters who are 6<br/>
and 4.<br/>
We have until just recently followed a semi-structured approach to our<br/>
homeschooling life, producing a worried Mum and two fed up girls!  I was<br/>
continually fretting about scope and sequences and worring about whether<br/>
the girls were learning everything on time or not etc, etc!!!! Anyway we<br/>
have finished our school holiday season over here and saw during that<br/>
time how much our girls have blossomed in their learning and in attitude<br/>
as well. It made us really examine what we were doing and so......we<br/>
decided to change. The first thing we did was order the Unschooling<br/>
Handbook by Mary Griffith (?), and since then we haven&#39;t looked back. My<br/>
eldest is reading us and our library out of books and has also (on her<br/>
own) started obsessively finding anything out about the Holocaust and<br/>
WW2 that she can. This is a complete turn around for her!!!!!!!! Dh and<br/>
I are happier than we have been in ages and its thanks to a new<br/>
unschooling attitude.<br/>
So that is part of our homeschooling story and I look forward to<br/>
learning more and more thru this list. If anyone can recommend any other<br/>
unschooling books to read<br/>
I would be very grateful.<br/>
Thanks for reading,<br/>
Michele.</div>

&gt;      to think a little deeper... and have a more sophistocated<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866249538">Hi Michele,<br/>
Welcome to the list.<br/>
I always recommend my two favorite unschooling authors.  John Holt, and<br/>
Grace Llwelyn.  (sp?)  I love both of their work.  After reading Grace,<br/>
I was wishing I had been able to stay home.<br/>
Enjoy the list, it is a great bunch of people.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you saw my post about pen pals or not, but our support<br/>
group here in North Carolina is looking for pen pals.  If your<br/>
interested, let me know.<br/>

Welcome to the list - remember me? I used to be on the nzunschoolers<br/>

you ever wanted to know about what to feed your cat, how to care for<br/>
chooks (as long as you realise that most of the people on this list call<br/>
them chickens), and unschooling! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
  Tracy, we feed our cats only a dry, hi-protein pellet food.  (not, an expensive brand) and they are all healthy as can be.  We do have one occasional barfer - but she&#39;s also the nervous one.  Every once in a while I&#39;ll give them a little treat, like meat, but that&#39;s it.  Plenty of water, no milk.<br/>
<br/>
  If you aren&#39;t feeding them dry food right now, they might rebel and not eat for a while - you know how stubborn cats can be.  But, they will relent and eat it eventually - everything I&#39;ve read says it is much better to feed your domesticated animals this way.  <br/>
<br/>
  We have five cats and they all seem to be very healthy and happy.  Hope this helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952762624">Well they&#39;re on dry food now and we still have chucking up and various other noxious stuff.  But I think that&#39;s mostly due to scavenging and seemingly me being the only person who ever thinks to freshen their water.  The barfer&#39;s also a habitual toilet-water-drinker, spot the link?  He&#39;s thwarted most of the time as I&#39;m following the Feng Shui practice of keeping the lids down and the bathroom doors shut, I guess I need to think of a remedy for this, a rain-butt with a slow drip maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525674257">in answer to feeding your cats..I&#39;m right in line with Betsy on this one..my <br/>
five cats only eat dry food, and water too!!....they are just fine..healthy <br/>
and playful...and no one seems to mind...we started feeding them this way, <br/>
when my 2 cats grew into 6..  we just kept adopting...having just dry down is <br/>
just that much easier around here.... we just recently started having a <br/>
problem with  my dog eating their food, but that&#39;s just because he is on new <br/>
medication for his bad hip, and it makes him really hungry...other than <br/>
that......that is just my .02 on this subject...<br/>

Living in the country is great - tiring, exhausting, but great. And<br/>
being so close to the sea - when we finished working today, it was off<br/>
to the beach for a swim (yes, all you poor northern hemispherites, it&#39;s<br/>
summer and hot here). We have nearly finished our shed (double garage<br/>
plus large room) and hope to move in in about 3 weeks - then all we have<br/>
to do is build the house, clear the gorse, plant the trees, grow the<br/>
gardens...... Another 30 - 40 years and we might just about be there!<br/>
