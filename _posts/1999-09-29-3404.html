<br/>
A few years back my adult siblings and my mother decided instead of<br/>
gifts, to get together for a fancy gourmet dinner that we each were in<br/>
charge of a dish or two.  It was really great.  I think Gramma still got<br/>
each of her grandkids a gift,  but it was nice that a huge pile of gifts<br/>
wasn&#39;t the focus.  At the time we all lived near each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952841341">Yes, Christmas.  This was on my mind also when I asked about birthdays. <br/>
Sometimes I wonder if I&#39;m getting too cynical about things.<br/>
Our new traditions? Boxes of Holiday stuff come out after Thanksgiving<br/>
and go all over the house.  The kids love to play with the nativity set! <br/>
Santa doesn&#39;t wrap the gifts he leaves here either (Santa brings just one<br/>
gift per child and puts fancy shampoo or bubble bath and a candy cane in<br/>
the stocking).   Dad & kids go together to pick out the tree.  Mom and<br/>
kids go to mall to visit Santa (Big deal here, we go to the mall only<br/>
about 3-4 times a year).<br/>
Here&#39;s were I have been:<br/>
I grew up with just my nuclear family around.  Then when I married dh and<br/>
I both had families in town & my Mom could get pretty bent out of shape<br/>
that &quot;her family&quot; was not all together on the holidays anymore.  We did<br/>
the 24th with mine and 25th with his and every other year Thanksgiving<br/>
stuff.  Then we moved 250 miles away, far enough that we prefer to stay a<br/>
night or two when we visit and the trip involves a mountain pass that<br/>
gets plenty of snow in winter.  So we stay home (& invite all our family<br/>
to come and spend holidays with us, so far no takers)<br/>
This will be our 4th Christmas here.  With my family of origin, we<br/>
decided a few years ago not to exchange gifts, except between Grandma &<br/>
the kids.  We broached this idea with Dh family, but they all continue to<br/>
give us gifts every year.  Last year we put together baskets with<br/>
homemade jam & dried fruits & a bottle of local wine.  Then I was annoyed<br/>
bc I did most of the work on this and decided to make one for my sibs as<br/>
well.<br/>
Let me add that we are on a TIGHT budget and dh went out & bought fancy<br/>
baskets (I would have been content to just put stuff in a bag, but he is<br/>
generous and thoughtful and likes to do nice things for people).  So,<br/>
there was less money to buy stuff for our kids.  Not that I wanted to<br/>
spend a lot on my kids, just that we had no money and were spending<br/>
giving things to grown-up siblings who are mostly financially better off<br/>
than we are.<br/>
This is part of my gripe with the whole gift thing.  I will quote from my<br/>
brother: &quot;Why spend money I don&#39;t have trying to pick out a gift for<br/>
(relative) who doesn&#39;t really &quot;need&quot; anything anyway, & they are doing<br/>
the same for me&quot;  Why not instead use our money to choose things we&#39;ve<br/>
decided we need or want for ourselves?  Or to give to charity?  Or to not<br/>
spend at all and get the whole Christmas thing away from tons of gifts<br/>
anyway!<br/>
I also like the idea someone said about sending gifts when you want to<br/>
(rather than special occasions only).  I digressed quite a bit there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What do you do for Christmas? We are right now trying to implement a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>new way <br/>
of doing Christmas. This is when our children look like they just bought<br/>
Toys <br/>
R Us! We decided that since Christ was given 3 gifts, we will give 3<br/>
gifts, <br/>
and then we will focus on clothing and needed items. In stockings my<br/>
children <br/>
are always blessed with undergarments, pencils, and other little goodies.<br/>
I <br/>
think that this year we are going to tone down the big toy hype and focus<br/>
on <br/>
family and Christ. We have also decided that instead of shopping for high<br/>
<br/>
priced gifts for family and friends, we will make bread, soup mixes,<br/>
cookies, <br/>
and hot chocolate<br/>
Stephanie<br/>
Mommy to Tiffany, Martin, James, and Stacie&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all in favor of edible gifts!<br/>

I never seem to manage such a task at the &#39;appropriate&#39; time, perhaps I&#39;ll do <br/>
just that.<br/>

DS&#39;s birthday is early October.  That starts thoughts of Christmas for us.  I <br/>
get to figure out the shopping early.  The two are close enough together that <br/>
I don&#39;t have to do a whole new information search on his wish list.  What he <br/>
doesn&#39;t get for his birthday, I consider for Christmas.  <br/>
<br/>
The kid&#39;s getting savvy...only gives mom a short, detailed list of the most <br/>
important items and hopes I won&#39;t get distracted and go buy something else!   <br/>
The list has gotten shorter and more detailed over the years.  Smart kid.  <br/>

&gt; Just curious as to how everyone handles the Santa Claus thing?<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about this long and hard. I agree to some extent that it is a<br/>
lie, but OTOH there is a lot of magic surrounding it. I look at in another<br/>
light too. My family (well, ok especially myself) is certified Disney<br/>
freaks. When we go to WDW there is lots of magic in them meeting all of the<br/>
characters. I&#39;m sure they know at a young age that the characters are not<br/>
real, yet they adore them. It&#39;s magical. When I asked my mom if there was a<br/>
santa she said &quot;Santa is whoever you want him to be.&quot; To this day these<br/>
words ring true with me. I even have a sweatshirt that says &quot;I still believe<br/>
in Santa Claus&quot; and I&#39;m 31 years old. It seems to me that Christmas would be<br/>
lacking with out santa. Our kids alays seem easy to forgive us when those<br/>
presents arrive. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525615086">We &quot;do&quot; Santa Claus and all the rest of them (from other countries).  He is<br/>
a figure of giving and sharing.  He isn&#39;t a lie as such as he is or was an<br/>
actual person who became a myth, etc.  We don&#39;t do the whole threat thing<br/>
(big good or Santa won&#39;t bring you anything), so I suppose that might make<br/>
a diff.  I think kids are really quite able to understand intangibles and<br/>
the difference between folklore/myths and lies.<br/>

Hi Nicole<br/>
<br/>
I never had a problem with the Santa Question because I myself enjoyed the<br/>
whole ruse as a child, and so did my husband. By a certain age (since we<br/>
were both babies of the family, a rather early age) we knew the truth, but<br/>
it was fun to pretend it was real. We never felt like we were lied to. It&#39;s<br/>
hard to get too worked up when there&#39;s presents involved.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 and 11 yo&#39;s of course know that we are Santa. They are under strict<br/>
instructions not to ruin the magic for their little sisters, just like I<br/>
didn&#39;t let anyone ruin it for them.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, when my eldest was 4 or 5 I tried for some reason to explain it<br/>
all. I was putting her shoes on and talking about &quot;the spirit of Christmas&quot;<br/>
and &quot;St Nicholas&quot;, etc, everything except actually saying &quot;Santa&#39;s not<br/>
real&quot;...I finally stop, and Cristina says, &quot;You&#39;re putting me on.&quot;  I<br/>
consider for a second and agree. She eventually figured it out. And we&#39;ve<br/>
never had a problem with Santa being on the same level as God. I don&#39;t know<br/>
what to tell you there except it just isn&#39;t an issue for us.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m with you on this one, but because of society and families, we gave in <br/>
and do the Santa thing.  I think that my kids will understand that it was me <br/>
all along and in a way, it is a right of passage.  Only the really big kids <br/>
know that it is Mom and Dad, while the little ones still believe...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t equate with God, as we are not Christian and explain that while it <br/>
is a Christian holiday and this is what it represents these (various) <br/>
symbols come from ancient religions, etc...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208744926">My two cents for Santa topic.  My dd has known (since she was 5) that Santa<br/>
was really people who love her & want to share a special time with her.<br/>
We&#39;ve learned about Saint Nicholas & his life.  I&#39;ve taught her that not<br/>
everyone is comfortable giving & this is a way for them to do it without<br/>
doing it in person.  We&#39;ve talked about giving to those whose parents can&#39;t<br/>
afford to give them gifts.  Its a season of sharing & remembering the best<br/>
gift of all &quot;a little baby&quot;.  Our two ds (4 & 2) know that Santa at the<br/>
store is really a man dressed up to remind everyone abut St. Nicholas, who<br/>
was a real person.  Santa is anyone who wants to share joy with another.<br/>
But they still tell me, all year long, to put this item or another on their<br/>
gift list for birthday & Santa.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also studied Santa through the years and in different countries.  A<br/>
history and geography lesson rolled into one.  We don&#39;t want the kids to be<br/>
without this small piece of childhood but when their ready they know the<br/>
truth.  It&#39;s also cute watching them during the holiday season.  DD came<br/>
over last year & told me that I should get her brother a particular gift for<br/>
Christmas because he doesn&#39;t know yet that Santa is really mom, dad &<br/>
grandparents.  But it&#39;s ok because he&#39;s only a little kid.  DD had just<br/>
turned 7 (on Christmas Day).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97531078">Hi Nicole. I am feeling a bit grinchley myself. When the topic first came <br/>
up, my first thought was of all the money I would be spending. With 5 kids, <br/>
it can really add up fast. Over the years I have gotten really sick and <br/>
tired of worrying about there being enough presents and if everyone has what <br/>
they really want, and if each is getting the same number of gifts, and all <br/>
the crap that goes with Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
I did it to myself. When my oldest, Megan, was 3 she asked for 3 things from <br/>
Santa. I got her those 3, and several more. She looked at all that, and said <br/>
&quot;Mommy I only asked for 3 things, why did I get so many?&quot; I realized then <br/>
that I blew it. I should have stuck to the list. Instead I passed on the <br/>
tradition of excess from my own childhood. At the time, I still wanted <br/>
that-the tree overflowing with presents, the excitement, and it was fun <br/>
while the kids were little. They were thrilled with everything they got, <br/>
whether it was something expensive or just a little thing. Now I think that <br/>
Santa presents are the big ticket items that they know I won&#39;t buy but they <br/>
can get from him for free.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to come clean on it and tell them that there is no Santa, but <br/>
then I remember telling Meg. She had said one day in the car that even <br/>
though other kids say there is no Santa, she knew I would never lie to her. <br/>
I thought it was a big hint to go ahead and tell her, so one day when we <br/>
were alone, I did. She was totally horrified. She cried, I felt awful. I do <br/>
not ever want to go through that again. So, on we go. If I had it to do over <br/>
again, Oh, tough one. I still love that magic-I always want to believe in <br/>
fairy tales, and Santa is such a good one. I guess that I would like it if <br/>
Santa only brought some little things-the ones made by elves and not <br/>
Nintendo or Mattel. Then the big dollar toys would still be subject to <br/>
reality. Wow, that is a good idea-wonder if I could start some kind of <br/>
propaganda that Santa is going back to basics and making all his own stuff <br/>
again!! Do you think the kids would buy it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730419403">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my 2 cents about Christmas and Santa.  I have never told my kids<br/>
there was a Santa, but then, I didn&#39;t need to.  Advertising and well meaning<br/>
grandparents did that for me.  I never made a big deal about it.  The first<br/>
time my son asked me whether or not Santa was real, I asked him, &quot;What do<br/>
you think?&quot;.  He said, &quot;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s real&quot;.  A few minutes later he<br/>
asked me who REALLY gave him all the Christmas presents.  I told him I did.<br/>
I asked him if he was disappointed and he said, &quot;No way, I love you alot<br/>
more than Santa!&quot;.  That just made my day.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy Wright (who just happens to be the rotten kid who told her whole 1st<br/>
grade class that Santa wasn&#39;t real, made kids cry, and had to go home with a<br/>
nasty-gram from the teacher  LOL!)<br/>

I don&#39;t take my kids to the mall to see Santa, since I don&#39;t believe in lying to them and telling them that this man is the ONE and ONLY Santa and he lives in the North Pole, etc.  I believe that it is important to keep Santa a mysterious and intangible figure, so that when they are old enough, the transition to understanding the more complex idea of what Santa really is, is easier, and they don&#39;t feel they have been fooled or lied to, but that they are now learning more of the truth as they get older.<br/>

<br/>
When my child got older his daddy&#39;s parents told him, &quot;Mommy thinks Santa Clause is dead but he comes to see us.  See how dumb your lying mom is?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But remember one day all children find out the truth!  And now who is dumb/liar.<br/>
<br/>
I say tell the truth.  Not looking for a fight but you are developing a relationship to teach your child many things.  Not just Santa Clause.  Math, science, God, ect... Do you want to set the idea that you are not a source of truth?  Or when everyone else is wrong or telling me stories, Mom/Dad are the ones to get the answers from.<br/>
