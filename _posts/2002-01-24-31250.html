<div id="ygrps-yiv-16540520">Hi there,<br/>
Not wanting to sound like my older, more confident, can handle it all older<br/>
sister.....Please check the stories &quot;shared&quot; by co-workers, friends and yes,<br/>
even e-list friends. www.truthorfiction.com is an excellent free place to<br/>
check the story prior to posting it or forwarding it to friends. I<br/>
unfortunately, have often been the person forwarding the story on our of<br/>
concern for family, friends etc. The gel candle, it is on there, please<br/>
check it out for yourselves.<br/>
As for the college degree...my dh has bachelors, masters and CPA, he is<br/>
unemployed since November. The degrees mean nothing when searching for a job<br/>
to keep our home and putting food on the table. The best we have going for<br/>
us right now is my doggy boarding business and his &quot;experience&quot; 17 years of<br/>
hard work will pay off, whereas we just paid off his student loans three<br/>
years ago. just a thought.<br/>

several of us have and it&#39;s no picnic. You *will* survive, though. <br/>
The boarding business sounds neat. Can you add grooming to that? The <br/>
groomers around here get $30 per dog! <br/>
