<div id="ygrps-yiv-950915684">One of the reasons Noelle came to visit us was to help out with <br/>
Vacation Bible School (VBS)at our church.  She agreed to help keep <br/>
the nursery while I taught a class for the week and my older <br/>
daughter Sarah was in a class and my younger daughter Olivia was to <br/>
be in the nursery with Noelle.<br/>
<br/>
The first day of VBS Olivia didn&#39;t want to stay in the nursery and I <br/>
didn&#39;t force her.  We went in and out through the morning as our <br/>
schedule allowed but mostly she stayed with me.  At one point Olivia <br/>
was eating a snack in the nursery and stayed there without me for <br/>
about 20 minutes.  I looked in to check on her and she was crying.  <br/>
I immediately took her out.  Noelle told me, &quot;Olivia is the only <br/>
problem.  All of the other kids are doing fine.&quot;  I said, &quot;Olivia is <br/>
not a problem.&quot;  Noelle replied, &quot;Well, she is a Mama&#39;s baby.&quot;  I <br/>
said, &quot;There is nothing wrong with that.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Later on in the morning Olivia wanted to play again in the nursery <br/>
and I left her for about 20 minutes and checked on her twice during <br/>
that time.  The second time I looked in she was listlessly sitting <br/>
with her blankie and sucking her fingers.  She saw me through the <br/>
window and brightened up when I motioned for her to come to the door <br/>
and go with me.  Noelle immediately rushed to the door and, while <br/>
she didn&#39;t say anything, it was clear from her facial expressions <br/>
and her tongue clicking that she didn&#39;t approve.  I said, &quot;I know <br/>
you don&#39;t approve of my parenting, but I am taking her out.&quot;  She <br/>
said nothing.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t leave Olivia in the nursery again the rest of the week.  <br/>
She stayed with me in my class and was my little helper.  She <br/>
colored and cut when she was bored by the class and she handed out <br/>
papers and sat with me when she was interested in what we were <br/>
doing.  She was fine and she didn&#39;t disturb my class in the least.<br/>
<br/>
By Wedsnesday of our VBS week my older daughter Sarah was very <br/>
tired.  (We are not used to getting up early and having to be <br/>
somewhere and follow an agenda!  Thankfully, it was only for a week!)<br/>
<br/>
Sarah said she didn&#39;t want to go to class that day.  I told her she <br/>
didn&#39;t have to that she could sit with me in my class and take it <br/>
easy or help.  <br/>
<br/>
Noelle came downstairs to breakfast and Sarah told her she wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to class.  Noelle said, &quot; But you have to go.  You should <br/>
finish what you start.  You need to go, just for the experience.&quot;  I <br/>
said, &quot;Sarah, you don&#39;t have to do anything you don&#39;t want to do.&quot;  <br/>
Noelle said, &quot;But she has to go.  She should finish what she <br/>
starts.  That&#39;s what I was taught and that&#39;s what I think.&quot;  I <br/>
said, &quot;I don&#39;t really care what you think.  Here&#39;s what I think.  I <br/>
think this visit is not going well and I think you need to call your <br/>
parents and change your flight.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I felt badly about saying this to her but I was also relieved.  I <br/>
wanted her gone because of her constant challenges to our way of <br/>
life, her rudeness (everything I did and said was wrong and could be <br/>
tweaked or improved).  I had told her earlier in the week that I <br/>
wasn&#39;t used to being critized and judged all of the time, that my <br/>
kids still thought I was pretty great.  This got no response from <br/>
Noelle. The understanding about homeschooling that she had had a few <br/>
days earlier seemed to have vanished.  I guess all of her beliefs <br/>
were being challenged on too many levels at once.<br/>
<br/>
 She had also been &quot;shushing&quot; Sarah and telling her to be quiet.  <br/>
When I asked her to stop this Noelle said,(in front of Sarah), &quot;But <br/>
she is too loud.&quot;  My reply was, &quot;This is her house.&quot;  Anyway all of <br/>
this is a roundabout way of saying there was a lot of stuff leading <br/>
up to my saying, &quot;You need to go home.&quot;  It was one thing to <br/>
consider when she was disturbing my peace but when she disturbed my <br/>
children--it was time for her to go.<br/>
<br/>
End of 2nd installment.  Next, the truth comes out, a tearful <br/>
confession, and I call Noelle&#39;s parents.</div>
