<div id="ygrps-yiv-143768498">I&#39;m so sad about public schools right now.  I have been off and on near<br/>
tears as I keep hearing story after story about parents who are ever so<br/>
happy to be rid of their kids and kids that hate school and are crying<br/>
every day begging their parents not to go...  It reminds me of<br/>
Ferberizing and Ezzo enthusiasts back when my 6 year old was a baby. <br/>
Here is a quote from a different list that I am on.  :(  The saddest<br/>
part was that the person writing it was trying to comfort a mother.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;fwiw, &lt;name deleted&gt;&#39;s friend&#39;s school sent home a note telling parents to expect their new first-graders to be grumpy, tired, and difficult for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>up to a month or longer!  <br/>

That is so sad to hear that teachers are actually sending home notes like <br/>
that. My friend was telling me that her friend just sent her daughter off to <br/>
kindergarten. The poor kid was a wreck after the first day. She had to sit <br/>
in a circle with the kids and have their legs crossed and they weren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to move their arms, stretch their legs out or look at the kid next <br/>
to them while they were having &quot;fun storytime.&quot; The little girl came home <br/>
not wanting to ever go back. The father wants to give it two weeks to see if <br/>
she gets over it. Then maybe look into a private school if it&#39;s no better.<br/>
<br/>
And I hear at the park all the time of the mothers with their babies who are <br/>
so glad their other children are back in school.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I&#39;m glad school started too. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hear this all the time from my friends on the block.  There are 38 kids on <br/>
our block, split in half between public and private schools.  We are the only <br/>
homeschooling family.  They are thrilled to have their older kids in school <br/>
and can&#39;t wait for the younger ones to grow up and go to school (one poor <br/>
almost 4 year old is in his THIRD year of preschool).  Most moms of little <br/>
ones put them in a &quot;mom&#39;s day out&quot; program at a local church a day or two.  I <br/>
had to use it the other day for a doctor&#39;s appointment (all the kids being <br/>
back in school cuts out the babysitters) and am wondering how long I&#39;ll have <br/>
to work to undo things.  They had the hands in the lap thing and the <br/>
scheduled snack thing.  Normally I would have taken them with me - we go <br/>
everywhere together - but it was for a blood draw, I thought it might scare <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
My friends can&#39;t understand why we would do what we are doing.  I feel so <br/>
badly for their kids.  On the other hand, I&#39;m so happy for our two little <br/>
ones!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since Liam is no longer in school (!!!) I do take him everywhere with me, <br/>
and he expects it, too.  I also donate blood every eight weeks, and he <br/>
comes along.  He&#39;s pretty jaded to it now, but he can see that it doesn&#39;t <br/>
hurt, and he asks all kinds of questions about it and they always give him <br/>
a roll of that weird colored bandage.  He&#39;s had blood drawn twice because <br/>
of Lyme disease (positive both times), but he&#39;s been GREAT about it.  He <br/>
even watches when they do it!  He looks forward to a few rides on the <br/>
elevator when we&#39;re done and then we go do something fun.<br/>
<br/>
It means a lot to him that I donate blood for other people we don&#39;t know <br/>
who might need it.  Sometimes (when he&#39;s tired) he gets a little upset and <br/>
wants me to keep my blood for me.  He&#39;s worried they&#39;ll take it all, I <br/>
guess.  But, I&#39;m glad that there is this concrete thing that he can see me <br/>
do to help other people.  It&#39;s better than talking about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe it wouldn&#39;t have scared my kids, you&#39;re right.  They are only 3 and 4, <br/>
though.  The other problem is that it was at an infertility center,  FULL of <br/>
women trying to get pregnant.  It&#39;s probably pretty hard for them to see <br/>
little ones there.  I&#39;m trying to be a gestational carrier for my sister and <br/>
her husband.  Didn&#39;t work this cycle, but next time I might consider bringing <br/>
them rather than leaving them in the church program.<br/>

very generous of you!<br/>
