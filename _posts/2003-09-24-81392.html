<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958444915">My kids are known around town and my 15 and 17 year old daughters <br/>
take their brothers out on walks all of the time to area businesses, <br/>
etc.  Just the day before yesterday the girls took them down to the <br/>
DQ on free cone day to get the boys a cone in the middle of the <br/>
day.  That&#39;s why the call to the police up-set me, people do know my <br/>
kids and where they live and they should have called me first.  I&#39;ve <br/>
lived in this town my whole life, it&#39;s so small it&#39;s actually called <br/>
a village.  As far as I was concerned the kids have never left the <br/>
yard without supervision and they were (suppose to be) playing in <br/>
the backyard.  It&#39;s a shame I can&#39;t trust them now to be out for 10-<br/>
15 minutes in our own back yard, while I work on other things and <br/>
care for their baby brother, whom was being rocked to sleeep at the <br/>
time.  The business parking lot they were in is right next door.  <br/>
There was no reason for them not to send them home if they were <br/>
bothering them, instead of calling the police.  I understand the <br/>
police were doing their job, but really the kids were right next <br/>
door to our property, not wondering all over town.  The other kids <br/>
their age that do wonder all over town without supervision have <br/>
teased my boys in the past that I won&#39;t let them leave the yard <br/>
without an adult or their sisters.  That&#39;s why I just feel like this <br/>
is a case of lets tweek the home schooler.  The people at the <br/>
business could have easily told them to go back into their own yard <br/>
or we&#39;re going to call your mother.  My husband went across the <br/>
street to ask the people at that business if they had seen the boys <br/>
and if they were being troublesome and they said no, if they had <br/>
they would of came to our door, as they know who we are.  I just <br/>
don&#39;t understand why the other business couldn&#39;t have had the same <br/>
attitude about it.  Perhaps, I&#39;ll go over and ask them, but I have <br/>
to calm down first.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, my boys were in the wrong <br/>
for leaving the yard without permission, but in this situation it <br/>
didn&#39;t require all this extra attention.  Especially, like I said <br/>
when other kids their age run around town all of the time.  It&#39;s <br/>
simply a case of some people in our society doesn&#39;t like seeing kids <br/>
out of the public school, even in their own back yard (or pretty <br/>
darn close to it).<br/>

If your streets aren&#39;t safe for kids you should find out why and do <br/>
something to campaign about it. Otherwise its like saying women should <br/>
have a curfew an shouldn&#39;t be on the streets cos they&#39;ll get raped. <br/>

excercising their rights to go where they will?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve addressed that very issue with our law enforcement.  A few years ago <br/>
when my oldest two were 12 and 13, the alternated with the job of daycare at the <br/>
local Gold&#39;s Gym, which is less than half a mile from our house.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter always wanted a ride, my son always wanted to walk (12). Suddenly <br/>
my son was getting dropped off by our &quot;friendly&quot; Deputy almost every single <br/>
time he walked home, which wasn&#39;t late at all.<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought it was the cop being friendly but Matthew didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
think it was.  The cop was always smiling and waving when he pulled in the <br/>
driveway.<br/>
<br/>
Matthew said it always went like this:  Where are you going son?  Home.  <br/>
Where have you been son?  Gold&#39;s Gym, I work there.  Where do you live son?  Vista <br/>
Woods, around the corner.  Get in son, I&#39;ll take you home.  That&#39;s OK, I can <br/>
walk.  Why don&#39;t you want a ride son?  Is there any reason you don&#39;t want to <br/>
get in my car?  No sir, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
So I told my son if it bothered him he could certainly politely decline a <br/>
ride and just keep walking.  This apparently angered the &quot;friendly cop&quot;.  He <br/>
wanted to know WHY he didn&#39;t want the ride, kept following him as he walked.  <br/>
Blocked his path with the car and got out, told him to STOP, which Matthew <br/>
complied with.  Asked if he could search him, Matthew wanted to know why.  Well, if <br/>
he was refusing to be searched there had to be a reason.  This all occurred <br/>
within yelling distance of our home.  The cop KNEW where he lived, worked, his <br/>
name, everything but was being, well, NOT the friendly neighborhood cop.<br/>
<br/>
So this time when he bring my boy home, he come to the door to tell me that <br/>
my son was rude with him and he thinks he might be in some trouble.  TROUBLE?  <br/>
All the nice cop wanted to do was offer him a ride home and my son refused to <br/>
get in the car, that&#39;s grounds for arrest he tells me.  OK, now you GOTTA take <br/>
a ride from the nice stranger cause he wears a uniform?<br/>
<br/>
It got ugly. He brought up that Matthew asked why he wanted to search him, <br/>
well you are 12 if you have cigarettes it&#39;s against the law.  Why would he think <br/>
he had cigarettes?  Because he&#39;s 12?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we ended up with quite the conversation about laws and civil rights <br/>
and he wanted to take ME to jail because I &quot;threatened&quot; him to stay away from <br/>
my son.<br/>
<br/>
The Sheriff was much more understanding.  He was even more understanding some <br/>
weeks later when this same cop started following my son home from school <br/>
&quot;chatting&quot; with him about checking him for cigarettes or lighters or anything that <br/>
might be illegal.  I called the sheriff&#39;s office.  They told me no officer <br/>
was in the area at that time of day.  I went and witnessed it for myself and <br/>
called, gave them the car number.  Again they denied it.  So I called the Sheriff <br/>
at home, he came and waited with me the next day.  Guess who showed up <br/>
driving slowly behind my boys all the way to my corner?  Same cop, same no longer <br/>
now a cop.<br/>
<br/>
Just because they wear a badge doesn&#39;t mean they are always the good guys.<br/>

next door?  At any rate, I&#39;d probably go over there with my kids and <br/>
meet the shop people.  Let them know that you&#39;re homeschoolers and that <br/>
if they see the kids during the day they&#39;re not &quot;skipping school&quot;.  <br/>
Also, you might leave them your phone number so that if they do want to <br/>
speak with you you&#39;re only a phone call away.  Just some ideas.... :)<br/>

that&#39;s how it goes here when a cop gets in trouble for things that might make <br/>

I was simply assured that the &quot;cop&quot; in question would NOT be a cop after that <br/>
dad and personal records are sealed so don&#39;t ask questions.<br/>

So rumor was that the &quot;friendly neighborhood cop&quot; just up and quit his job.<br/>

listen to their child and call it what it was, stalking, harassment...<br/>

If I knew of six and seven year olds unaccompanied by anyone older out <br/>
running all over town, and even coming to my house across town to play with <br/>
my <br/>
children alone, I&#39;d call someone, hopefully their parents first to see if <br/>
they were <br/>
aware of this.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s neglect, six and seven year olds are not equipped to be &quot;running all <br/>
over town&quot; by themselves all day.  Who feeds them when they get hungry?  <br/>
Where to <br/>
do they turn if they are hurt or frightened while they are out carousing the <br/>
town?<br/>
<br/>
I know they will pick up a ten year old out wandering the streets here and <br/>
take them home if they are alone, I can&#39;t imagine the attention six or seven <br/>
year old would get.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s neglect, the children need protecting and nurturing and supervision.<br/>

You can stop talking about it, though, and convince them by showing them when <br/>
it happens.  Even if you&#39;re doing schoolish stuff some of the time, you can <br/>
still keep the other times really rich and busy and take note of the incidental <br/>
learning, and build on that.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people come to unschooling by gradually moving toward it.<br/>

What a double whammy!  I can imagine how I&#39;d be feeling in that<br/>
situation, and it ain&#39;t fun.<br/>
<br/>
Can you point out that school at home wouldn&#39;t have prevented the<br/>
situation from happening?  If you&#39;d allowed the boys to go outside for<br/>
&quot;PE&quot; they could still have wandered away and been picked up, just as<br/>
happened--and most schools have PE during school hours, after all :)<br/>
<br/>
My guess is they&#39;re feeling some fear--which has a strong tendency to<br/>
come out as anger.  If you can identify the fear, and speak to that,<br/>
maybe it will help.  I have seldom needed to be concerned about what<br/>
people would think about my kids being out during normal school hours,<br/>
but I do have occasional issues in that way.  Generally, my fear has<br/>
been my child would be picked up and I charged with some form of<br/>
neglect, and then possibly lose custody of the child at least<br/>
temporarily.<br/>
<br/>
If I felt my husband had allowed behavior that might have resulted in<br/>
that sort of thing, I would have been very fearful and then very angry! <br/>
If he then could sit down with me and say &quot;Look, I know you&#39;re concerned<br/>
that something might happen and our kids might be taken away from us. <br/>
I&#39;m sorry I allowed behavior that could lead to that consequence.  I&#39;ll<br/>
try to remember that in the future--maybe you can help me remember that,<br/>
or help restructure things (like tieing the gate shut) so that it is<br/>
less likely to happen in the future.&quot; then I would feel like my feelings<br/>
were taken seriously, and my fear/anger would have been diffused.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps some,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I disagree with the neglect statement.  IMO it seems that anyone <br/>
that would <br/>
