<div id="ygrps-yiv-250480438">My son has an E mail address that he never uses.  We use mine when he wants <br/>
to search for something, etc., as he always wants help spelling etc.  So anyway <br/>
lately he has been getting pornographic E mail.  You know the type, bigger <br/>
penis, free sex site now etc.  I hate to set limits on his address to screen the <br/>
web sites he can access but I will if it will solve this problem, at least <br/>
until he is a little older. But I am thinking that it won&#39;t screen out what he <br/>
gets in his E mail.  I am really frustrated.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be thinking <br/>
about it as he doesn&#39;t use his address. It will really only need to be addressed <br/>
when he starts using his own E mail addy.  Right now he is only interested in <br/>
cartoonnetwork.com LOL. I only noticed it when the mail page comes up and <br/>
tells how many E mails each address has.  Noticed that he had a few and checked <br/>
out what the return subject lines were.  <br/>
<br/>
I just feel like our computer is being violated with this stuff.  He is only <br/>
9.<br/>
Anyway does anyone know if there is a way to not get the stuff in your E <br/>
mail?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know with AOL, you can set the preferences for email so he can only get <br/>
email from email address you specify.  Then if anyone he meets (friends, <br/>
pen-pals) want to email him, you just add their address to the list and he can receive <br/>
from them.<br/>
<br/>
My sister had to do this with my nephew (he is only 10) because the way they <br/>
set up the porn sites now, they look like an email from a long lost friend, <br/>
you click on it, then it takes 10 minutes to get out.  Meanwhile 100&#39;s of <br/>
pictures flash across the screen...yuck.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel the same way, I don&#39;t like to set limits for my kids, but the <br/>
unrealistic, sometimes violent images porn ads have of women aren&#39;t something I want <br/>
my boys to be brainwashed with.<br/>
