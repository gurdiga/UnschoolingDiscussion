 </span></blockquote>your keynote speech was to be &quot;Moving a Puddle&quot; and wet carpeting at <br/>
the end of a ramp with a puddle of water was what did you in. If only <br/>
that puddle had been moved the day before so the carpet could have <br/>
been dry by conference time!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It will never be dry so long as someone occupies those rooms and uses the a/c <br/>
units directly above the ramp.  I definitely think the hotel is negligent.  <br/>
I&#39;ll bet if Kelly went back and took pictures during a dry spell, the ramp <br/>
would still be wet.<br/>

&gt; Kelly Lovejoy who organized it, all her helpers, and the great <br/>
&gt; unschooling attendees who made the conference a big success despite <br/>
&gt; possibly the worst set-back a conference organizer could imagine!<br/>
