<br/>
We don&#39;t have a family religion, we&#39;re pretty anti-church/organized<br/>
religion in a lot of ways I guess. Even my dh who is a Christian, is a<br/>
very liberal Christian and doesn&#39;t like the whole organized religion<br/>
end of Christianity.<br/>
I&#39;ve attended Unity in the past with the kids. They didn&#39;t take to it<br/>
and I really grew beyond it because of the obvious ties to<br/>
Christianity...something I didn&#39;t find helpful at a certain point in<br/>
my journey. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d still go to Unity on occasion for the music and maybe a class or<br/>
two though. Positive, open-minded folks there.  I think Unitarian is<br/>
more up my alley these days if I want something organized, but leaning<br/>
so much towards Zen causes me to be very happy and comfortable without<br/>
a group now.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, as far as the kids go, we share in conversations our<br/>
questioning our thoughts, our ideas. They&#39;ve been exposed to a lot of<br/>
different ideas. They were raised in a Christian church prior to 2000,<br/>
so they got a dose of that (we weren&#39;t very regular).<br/>
<br/>
They know my dh&#39;s views, but he believes strongly in an individual&#39;s<br/>
path being their own. The spirituality in our family centers around a<br/>
lot of open ended questions...nobody feels they have the answers so my<br/>
kids aren&#39;t afraid to share some pretty intense views. Trevor is<br/>
agnostic, doesn&#39;t know if he believes in a God or not. <br/>
I have a meditation area that the kids join me in sometimes. They&#39;ll<br/>
even ask to come in my room when we have soft lighting and incense or<br/>
white sage burning. <br/>
Sometimes they choose a meditation stone from a basket I have (words<br/>
like joy, healing, prosperity etc...are on them) to hold and use as a<br/>
focus. We discuss philoshophy/religions of the world, we talk about<br/>
the good points of each religion as well as the aspects we don&#39;t care for.<br/>
I&#39;d say we&#39;re spiritual, but non-religious. We share those parts of<br/>
our lives just like we share anything else. It&#39;s just part of us, not<br/>
something to &quot;teach&quot; or push anyone towards.<br/>

When Sierra found out the Baptist church up the street was offering<br/>
VBS, she insisted on being signed up. I was SO leary of the whole<br/>
thing...picturing these Baptist folks trying to convert us or<br/>
something, but it was what she wanted.<br/>
She went two summers in a row and LOVED it. Happy as a clam, asked me<br/>
about this Jesus guy they kept singing about and had a ball.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t want to go now, but it was something she enjoyed at the<br/>
time. I felt like I needed to wear a big warning sign that said<br/>
&quot;HEATHEN; BEWARE&quot;. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575323871">I grew up Catholic but rejected that as soon as I turned 18 and moved out.<br/>
I didn&#39;t attend any church for about ten years and then after I had my kids<br/>
I felt the need, for some reason (buried guilt,I think), to raise them as<br/>
part of a church family.  <br/>
<br/>
So from the time my oldest was about 2 till she was 6 or 7 we attended the<br/>
local very laid back Methodist church with some regularity.  Over those<br/>
years I thought more about religion/spirituality than I had in a long time<br/>
and with the help of this open minded list, conversations with the minister<br/>
of the church, and several books including &quot;Conversations With God,&quot; by<br/>
Neale Donald Walsch, I came to my own conclusion of what God and<br/>
spirituality mean to me.  <br/>
<br/>
About the same time, the girls stopped enjoying going to Sunday school<br/>
(which I lead) and I was able to leave the church guilt-free.  Honestly, I<br/>
didn&#39;t even know that I was going because I felt guilty until I really<br/>
examined myself deeply.  After a lot of self examination and reading, I<br/>
figured out my own set of beliefs and came to peace with that.  (Which<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t fall into any particular religious philosophy)<br/>
<br/>
When the kids ask particular questions about religion, I tell them what<br/>
people of certain religions believe. I also share what I believe if they<br/>
ask.  I leave it to them to draw their own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
So far, they believe in God and enjoy the ritual of saying their thankful<br/>
prayers at night.  We haven&#39;t attended church four or more years, I would<br/>
guess but I&#39;ve never been at more peace with what I believe than I am right<br/>
now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574948126">My dh and I both converted to Christianity in youth and grew up in families<br/>
that did not practice.  We are both active in our Quaker church.  Dh is a<br/>
deacon and runs the worship (music) team.  I sing.   That said,  If our kids<br/>
choose a different path, that will be theirs to navigate and we would<br/>
absolutely support them in whatever they choose.  We pray together, with and<br/>
for the kids. They see us learning, studying and putting our faith into<br/>
action.  <br/>
 <br/>
My 12yo son is probably the most spiritually &quot;Christian&quot; of our kids at this<br/>
point and he also is the one who chooses not to attend services.  That is OK<br/>
with us.  We understand that sitting through service, for him, does not<br/>
enhance his faith.  It is an exercise in boredom for him.  Our two dd&#39;s like<br/>
church, enjoy their friends and teachers and activities there and for the<br/>
most part are gracious about having to go early and stay late so dh and I<br/>
can do music.  The whole family loves band night when we have the worship<br/>
team over for dinner and to jam and practice.  <br/>
 <br/>
We believe that the love and faith we express in our home and lives is what<br/>
makes the biggest impact and we&#39;re grateful to have a church family that<br/>
respects our kids as people and does not condescend to them.  We&#39;re wary of<br/>
bad attitudes toward kids and are very active in influencing the local<br/>
culture.  If it ever became a problem we would not hesitate to find another<br/>
church or start a home church of our own.<br/>
 <br/>
Whew, thanks for reading this far!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always been open to the wisdom my children have about God (or lack <br/>
thereof) and the world... when I realized that going to my church <br/>
(Catholic, at that time) was going to stifle my children&#39;s own <br/>
voices/opinions, I immediately began shopping for a place where their <br/>
thoughts would be honored.  [It may be important to know, too, that this <br/>
happened immediately after their father died and many kind people wanted <br/>
to say things to my kids I found horrifying and limited, and say these <br/>
things as if they were &quot;T&quot;ruths]<br/>
I found the Unitarian Universalist church to be a perfect match for us.  <br/>
I like to refer to it as our &quot;unchurch&quot; (though I&#39;ve now come to find <br/>
that the role of the religion in US history was greatly steeped in <br/>
developing public schools) where one is truly free to believe whatever <br/>
is necessary for their own life to work.  There is no dogma, instead 7 <br/>
principles:<br/>
<br/>
/We, the member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association, <br/>
covenant to affirm and promote/<br/>
<br/>
    * The inherent worth and dignity of every person;<br/>
    * Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;<br/>
    * Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in<br/>
      our congregations;<br/>
    * A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;<br/>
    * The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process<br/>
      within our congregations and in society at large;<br/>
    * The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;<br/>
    * Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we<br/>
      are a part.<br/>
<br/>
We quickly discovered these principles work in our *life* not just <br/>
Sunday mornings.  Luckily, where we are now, there are several <br/>
homeschooling families and two of us are unschoolers.  Depending on <br/>
where you are, some congregations are more Christian/Jewish/Pagan <br/>
slanted than others; and if you&#39;re lucky you can shop around for which <br/>
group meets your needs.  Our fellowship happens to be a bit more <br/>
cerebral than my liking, but I joined the program committee to infuse my <br/>
own spirituality into services.  (we only have one congregation in our <br/>
town, but larger cities have more, Minneapolis has at least 4 and <br/>
Albuquerque has 2 there&#39;s even one in Bemidji!)<br/>
