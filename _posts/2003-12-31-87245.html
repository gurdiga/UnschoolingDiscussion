More than one child has done it.<br/>

beggining site words were the first tell-tale signs LOL.....I know <br/>
in my heart everything is fine and that he will be reading when he <br/>
is ready. I also know that he is a happy child who gets to play a <br/>
lot while other children are getting information jammed down their <br/>
throats. I can see this is going to get questioned more and more <br/>
though.  My son is 7 going on 8 this May and cannot read so now he <br/>
will be compared to other kids in our family that are in school. I <br/>
usally ignore them just like I think my son does but I was wondering <br/>
if any one had any words of wisdom ???<br/>

bothers the parent because we see it for what it is, a<br/>
judgement on our choices, but the kids just see it as<br/>
a game that they are taught in school.  Even other<br/>
homeschoolers do it to my kids.  I know of a 6yo who<br/>
quizzes my 5yo in math and reading, until I remind him<br/>
that Aaron is a year younger.<br/>
<br/>
If it does bother your son, help him develop some<br/>
really interesting questions about the things he knows<br/>
that he can ask them back, things they might not know<br/>
because they are in school.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926846997">My oldest son (now 18) still has scars from the way schooled kids <br/>
treated him. :-(  We moved when he was 10 (and not reading yet) to an <br/>
apartment in a big complex in the city after we had been living on a <br/>
farm in NH and the testing got so much worse.  <br/>
<br/>
After we thought about it and talked about it, we dicided that he <br/>
could come up with his own &quot;tests&quot;.  So when the kids would ask him <br/>
something like &quot;how much is 234,628x73,410&quot; (which they didn&#39;t know <br/>
the answer to anyway!) he would answer with a question of his own; <br/>
who were the Gods on Mount Olympus or what is the definition of a <br/>
Shakespearian comedy- something like that.  That shut the kids right <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
The funniest time was when some nasty woman asked him in front of the <br/>
kids in theatre class after finding out he was hsed who discovered <br/>
America.  (I hate that and now we know where the kids get it from.)  <br/>
He went on to explain about land bridges, reed rafts, Vikings and <br/>
several other theories and then told about the 9,000 year old <br/>
skeleton they had just found in the Pacific Northwest.  He never <br/>
mentioned Columbus.  When he went into class she looked at me very <br/>
confused and said, &quot;I just expected him to say &#39;Columbus&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After we got home, I aksed him why he never said anything about <br/>
Columbus.  I knew he knew that that was the short answer to the <br/>
question and I knew he knew the year, the names of the ships etc.  He <br/>
looked at me and with all seriousness said, &quot;It&#39;s obvious that <br/>
Columbus didn&#39;t discover America- there were already people here.  <br/>
That answer is wrong!&quot;  He was 12.<br/>

If its not worrying your son, blow it off.<br/>
<br/>
My dd had this happen to her once when she was the &quot;new kid&quot; at a gymnastics<br/>
class.  They got really mean about it.  So I pointed out to Adriane all the<br/>
things she knows that those girls don&#39;t (how many pounds of milk make a<br/>
gallon, how to tell when a goat is in labor, that chickens need sunlight to<br/>
lay eggs, etc.)......she wasn&#39;t particularly impressed because in her young<br/>
mind, EVERYBODY knows THAT, mom.<br/>
<br/>
So she wanted curriculum, wanted to learn her multiplication tables....so I<br/>
said ok.  I pointed out tools we had (sing-song tapes about it, math blaster<br/>
games, etc.) that would help her memorize multiplication tables.  She worked<br/>
really hard for about 3 days.  She memorized her tables, realized that it<br/>
was not rocket science, not something she particularly needed at that point<br/>
in her life, and promptly forgot them.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane just needed to see for herself that there was nothing magical about<br/>
what was going on in school.....that she could most certainly do any of that<br/>
herself if she chose to.....that there are many more interesting things to<br/>
do than memorize numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Adriane is 13, it never happens.  She is smart, confident,<br/>
verbal........no one ever asks about her times tables now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve used those too, and another one of my son&#39;s favorites is when someone asks him a question and he doesn&#39;t know the answer, he says, &quot;I don&#39;t know, what&#39;s the answer?&quot;, and IF they can give him the answer he then asks, &quot;Ok, what does that mean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they don&#39;t know what it means, they only know the &#39;answer&#39;.  Dylan went to school for a few years, so he knows how the game is played.  Most tests only require answers, why learn anything more than that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114315321">I knew my in laws were going to start that with Joseph. So as soon as I<br/>
heard the first test start, I simply said we didn&#39;t do that kind of that<br/>
thing with him. That pretty much stopped most of it right away, lucky me.<br/>
But there were still times when they just couldn&#39;t help themselves. Joseph<br/>
wasn&#39;t up on school stuff so always wanted to know why they other person was<br/>
asking him? Didn&#39;t they know the answer to the question. He made it so<br/>
difficult for them, they stopped asking!!!!! And I always let him know he<br/>
didn&#39;t have to play that game with them. So he was confident that he could<br/>
say no he didn&#39;t want to do that.<br/>

honestly asking - it is friendly and interested and she really wants to <br/>
know how she learns anything. She asks her what she does all day. <br/>
She&#39;ll see her at soccer practice in the evening and want to know, <br/>
&quot;What did you do TODAY?&quot; Rosie says, &quot;I watch TV, go to the grocery <br/>
store with my mom, play games, play dolls, play with my dog, go to the <br/>
park with my friends, go to a movie, read books, ....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other day, I heard her friend say, &quot;How are you going to know stuff <br/>
like formulas for science?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie says, &quot;Like what formulas?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her friend, &quot;Like formulas for gravity and rates and stuff?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie: &quot;What are they for?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend: &quot;To figure out stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie: &quot;Tell me some of them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend: &quot;Well, I can&#39;t remember any right now but we had to know a <br/>
whole bunch of them for a test last Monday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie: &quot;Well, if you remember any, tell me.&quot;<br/>

Then they ran off playing and I didn&#39;t hear any more.<br/>
