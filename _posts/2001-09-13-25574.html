<div id="ygrps-yiv-532467082">I want to thank you all for the kind words and encouragment you sent mmy<br/>
way. I feel much better today, it is amazing what a bit of sleep can do for<br/>
one&#39;s outlook.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is home, but working long hours. It is a tense time. Kids are<br/>
doing great, don&#39;t seem to be reacting much to the current events. My oldest<br/>
(13) is concerned about flying, we are to take a trip in two months, but we<br/>
will work it out. We talk a lot around here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Sheri</div>
