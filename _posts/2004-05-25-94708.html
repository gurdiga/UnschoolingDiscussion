<div id="ygrps-yiv-581493393">Hi Danielle,<br/>
I was looking at your site.<br/>
It is wonderful.<br/>
Very cute kids!<br/>
<br/>
How did you make the climbing wall?<br/>
Sounds like something we might like to do.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Ann<br/>

  &gt; It is a beautiful pond Danielle. I saw the photos at your website. Very<br/>
  &gt; inspiring!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Julie<br/>
  ====================<br/>
  Thank you! I love it, and we all enjoy it so much! Dh was skeptical at<br/>
  first, and more than a bit bummed out by the $$$ spent, though I did all the<br/>
  labor. But now even he loves it and pouts if we feed the fish before he gets<br/>
  home. I&#39;ll have to post a picture on my webpage that shows the top and<br/>
  bottom ponds as a whole to give you the idea of what I was describing. I<br/>
  deliberately built the upper pond with a gradual slope to it to create a<br/>
  pebble beach for the kids and wildlife to wade in; it&#39;s only about 18&quot; deep<br/>
  or so. Of course, the kids&#39; favorite past time is throwing the pebbles into<br/>
  the ponds, so I&#39;m constantly having to refresh the beach. But it&#39;s worth it!<br/>
<br/>
  The ponds are a great source of both enjoyment and learning. The weather<br/>
  here has been really hot lately, and the kids have been in and out of the<br/>
  pond multiple times a day. We&#39;ve found tadpoles and black snails, moss and<br/>
  algae. We test the water weekly for ph and nitrate levels. This weekend, the<br/>
  kids spotted a snake sunning itself on the rocks--a pretty good size giant<br/>
  garter snake, we think, either that or an eastern ribbon snake, but I don&#39;t<br/>
  think so. It was probably hunting for frogs too. We&#39;ve found box turtles and<br/>
  blue salamanders. Bats and dragonflies love the water. It&#39;s a host to so<br/>
  much wonderful wildlife. We live a mile in from the Chesapeake Bay, but<br/>
  we&#39;re very wooded or else we&#39;d probably have herons trying to eat our fish.<br/>
<br/>
  I garden because I love to do it, but the kids just gain so much from all of<br/>
  our gardens and bird feeders and the wildlife they attract. Both dd&#39;s can<br/>
  differentiate between 4 different woodpeckers that we see, and we&#39;ve been<br/>
  lucky enough to watch mating dances and &quot;meet&quot; the fledglings when they<br/>
  first come to our feeders. Julia is amazing at catching butterflies by hand,<br/>
  and we even hatched a chrysalis this spring that had overwintered in our<br/>
  shed. The past several days the kids have been out every day picking<br/>
  strawberries as they ripen, and I&#39;m hoping that this year they&#39;ll enjoy the<br/>
  blackberries just as much.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, we&#39;re in the process of researching chickens and designing a coop for a<br/>
  backyard flock of layers. I&#39;ve applied to 4-H to become a leader, largely<br/>
  due to the recent conversation on this list. I had been looking into scouts,<br/>
  but wasn&#39;t thrilled with it while 4-H sounds ideal for our family. I also<br/>
  figure it&#39;s a good way for me to learn about sheep, which I&#39;ve always wanted<br/>
  to keep. Dh keeps talking about moving, which he knows I&#39;m so reluctant to<br/>
  do because I&#39;ve put so much time, energy and love into our home. I keep<br/>
  telling him the only way he&#39;ll get me off this land is to buy me several<br/>
  acres so I can add sheep, goats and possibly horses to my list!<br/>
