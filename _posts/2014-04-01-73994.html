<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139527545"><div dir="ltr">My 10 year old has spent a few months whenever we&#39;ve been at home nearly constantly either playing or watching videos on youtube about minecraft. I have felt very relaxed and positive about this. I&#39;ve engaged with her, helped her when she wanted to make her own videos...everything I think a good unschooling parent should do. And I&#39;ve done it with genuine joy. And now she&#39;s bored of the computer :D<div>
<br></div><div>Anyway, my question isn&#39;t about her, it&#39;s about her younger sister, who is 9 and has now been watching youtube videos for months and months and doing little else. She watches minecraft videos and karaoke versions of Let it Go from Frozen. I am aware enough to see that this is not all she does - she also does archery once a week, sleeps, has stories read to her, watches the odd film or tv programme, rehearses her version of Let it Go over and over and, when I can arrange it, plays with a friend or two. But the vast majority of her time is spent watching youtube and anything else has to be really very sparkly for her to choose it over youtube. <br>
<br>One of the issues is that, because it&#39;s been going on so much longer than it did for the 10 year old, and because it&#39;s so unvarying (ie. she doesn&#39;t play MC much at all, she isn&#39;t inspired to make her own videos or anything from what she&#39;s doing), every now and then I get a niggling voice saying &#39;is this really OK, her sitting hunched in her chair for hour after hour watching Youtube?&#39;. I&#39;m kind of certain it is, as she is a happy, kind, generous child most of the time. She&#39;s reading a lot and writing and working out sums (ie. how much longer until this episode of Stampy finishes) but I&#39;m not quite managing to really trust that this really is OK and to not think that I&#39;m missing something here. I sit with her sometimes, and she chats to me about what she&#39;s seen and explains what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s not that she&#39;s disengaged from the family. Should I really just let go and trust? (which I&#39;m fine with - I just knew you lot would think up something if there *was* something I was missing and not paying attention to).</div>
<div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t try to tempt her away from it at all because I know how counter-productive that would be - she clearly hasn&#39;t had her fill of it yet. But my other problem is this (which, based on her history, I don&#39;t think is related to the Youtube-watching): tthe times when I have done my best to make it so she can watch it as much as she wants but I really need her to come with us for some reason - to take one of her sisters somewhere, for instance. She has always been one who, if she doesn&#39;t want to do something, will not budge. She won&#39;t try to see a positive side, she won&#39;t try to see that sometimes it&#39;s important to do something for someone else, she won&#39;t see that she expects her sisters to drop what they&#39;re doing if we need to take her somewhere. This has caused huge rows in the past, before we were unschooling. But now I really do go out of my way to make sure I don&#39;t have to ask her to come away from Youtube - my mum will come and watch her if she can, or I get a friend to pick up one of my children. So I find it hard to not feel angry on the odd occasion when I&#39;m just not able to see a solution that suits all of us and I really need her to co-operate with us. (I have four children - just so you can see why the logistics are tricky sometimes). Again, apart from continuing to give her plenty of warning when I need her to come with us, and explaining about give and take etc. and reminding her of the times her sisters help her out, is there anything else I&#39;m missing? I try to avoid &#39;have tos&#39;, so it&#39;s more the frustrating feeling of her sometimes holding the rest of us hostage (if we were to &#39;give in&#39; to her insistence in not budging) or that (on the days DH is around) one of us always has to miss out on the fun thing the rest of the family want to do so that one of us can stay at home with her while she watches Youtube. And that frustration is, in retrospect, always compounded if we do make her come out with us and she ends up having a lovely time, once she&#39;s got over her anger.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance for any suggestions and different ways of looking at these situations.</div><div><br></div><div>Clare</div><div><br></div><div><br><br><br></div></div></div>

Well you SAY &quot;I have felt very relaxed and positive about this. ... And I&#39;ve done it with genuine joy. &quot; BUT then you follow &quot;And now she&#39;s bored of the computer&quot; with a big &quot;:D&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fill that first part in with anything other parents would be envious that your daughter&#39;s doing. Playing violin. Mastering chess. Doing calculus. If she grew bored of it, would you announce it? Would you follow your announcement with a big-grin smiley?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s been going on so much longer than it did for the 10 year old, and because it&#39;s so unvarying <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t compare. Really.<br/>
<br/>
Your younger daughter learns differently. She has different interests. Some people delve deeply. Some skim the surface. Some like repetition. Some like variety.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t try to tempt her away from it at all because I know how counter-productive that would be<br/>
<br/>
While it does sound like you&#39;re adding to her life, for others I want to emphasize that if a child is very focused on one thing don&#39;t try to pull them away. *Add* to their lives. Create more choices so they aren&#39;t choosing the one thing because there&#39;s nothing better. Get to know what they love and bring more and related things into their lives and other things you think they might love. Avoid (while you&#39;re deschooling) what you believe is good for them. Focus on enjoyment, engagement, fun.<br/>
<br/>
Plan days out of the house. It doesn&#39;t need to be to the zoo or a BIG day. A new grocery store. A new toy store. A trip for ice cream. Look at the trip through their eyes to plan the things they would pick out.<br/>
<br/>
Make what they love portable :-) so it&#39;s easier to go out.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; She won&#39;t try to see a positive side, she won&#39;t try to see that sometimes it&#39;s important to do something for someone else<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 9. Don&#39;t expect her to have empathy for others&#39; needs yet. If she feels she&#39;s required to give up what she wants so someone else can have what they want, that&#39;s not very good advertising for empathy!<br/>
<br/>
*You* be the one to find ways to meet needs without taking from someone else. Yes, it does take creativity! Ask here for ideas. :-)<br/>
<br/>
(It may feel like that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing. But what you&#39;re doing is pointing out all your daughter&#39;s faults and looking for ways to fix her. Shifting your point of view will make a big difference!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So I find it hard to not feel angry on the odd occasion when I&#39;m just not able <br/>
&gt; to see a solution that suits all of us and I really need her to co-operate with us. <br/>
&gt; (I have four children - just so you can see why the logistics are tricky sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
It helps to understand that radical unschooling isn&#39;t just some nice way to parent and help kids learn. It&#39;s based on how people work. The irritation of being asked to stop what you&#39;re doing so someone else can do what they want doesn&#39;t change just because there are 4 kids instead of 1. What&#39;s discussed here isn&#39;t rules that can be bent for special circumstances. They&#39;re principles. They&#39;re truths.<br/>
<br/>
What you need are *logistics* of how to make it work in your family not a special dispensation to let some of the practices slide ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; apart from continuing to give her plenty of warning<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s giving you feedback that your &quot;plenty of warning&quot; solution isn&#39;t something that helps her. If you kept making toast on setting 6 and it always burned, would it make sense to blame the toaster?<br/>
<br/>
I have a page on lots of different transition ideas that might help:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/unschooling%20in%20action/transitions.html">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/unschooling%20in%20action/transitions.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&gt; when I need her to come with us, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Need? Or you&#39;ve run out of ideas? Sometimes people *do* run out of ideas! :-) But it will help you to treat her with more courtesy and understanding if you mentally shift from &quot;need to&quot; to &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m in a bind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*Show* her how to treat others when you need to inconvenience them because you can&#39;t think of more options. Right now you&#39;re showing her what you do is, &quot;At this point I don&#39;t care about your feelings. My convenience is more important than your fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she doesn&#39;t see the thought you&#39;re putting into arranging for her to stay home. Maybe make the options you&#39;re considering a little more transparent. Think out loud.<br/>
<br/>
But she&#39;s 9. *Don&#39;t* expect her to appreciate what others are doing for her just yet. *Don&#39;t* expect her to understand. Right now she&#39;s biologically dependent on you to meet her needs so what you do for her feels like what you&#39;re supposed to do for her. Emotionally, from her point of view, you&#39;ve chosen the life you have. And when you brought her into your life, you promised to tend to her needs. When you don&#39;t, it feels like you&#39;re going back on your promise.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t *conscious* thought! It&#39;s her biology dictating her thoughts. She&#39;ll grow out of it as she gets older and feels more capable of meeting her own needs. You&#39;ll see changes usually as puberty approaches. But right now you can either work with how her brain works or against it. You can&#39;t change it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and explaining about give and take etc. and reminding her of the times her sisters help her out<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t. Don&#39;t guilt her into going through the motions of being courteous. When she&#39;s capable of being courteous, she&#39;ll be courteous -- as long as you&#39;ve been courteous to her so she can absorb how it&#39;s done! Until then, being courteous to others is your part to play on the team.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s more the frustrating feeling of her sometimes holding the rest of us hostage<br/>
&gt; (if we were to &#39;give in&#39; to her insistence in not budging) or that (on the days DH is around) <br/>
<br/>
She has no power. She can&#39;t hold you hostage. You have the power to pick her up and put her in the car. She doesn&#39;t have the power to stop you from doing that. (And even the law would back you up!)<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t give in to her since she has no power. You *can* choose to stop looking for solutions. But don&#39;t blame her for your choice to stop.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; one of us always has to miss out on the fun thing the rest of the family <br/>
&gt; want to do so that one of us can stay at home with her while she watches Youtube. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in essence blaming her because you have more kids than you are saying you can comfortably meet the needs of.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could give some of your kids away so you don&#39;t have so many. Or you could give her to a family who doesn&#39;t have any kids. Would those maybe be better options?<br/>
<br/>
Presumably you didn&#39;t keep adding kids because you figured it would make your life more convenient. She isn&#39;t to blame because you created a family that you don&#39;t have all the answers to.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And that frustration is, in retrospect, always compounded if we do make her <br/>
&gt; come out with us and she ends up having a lovely time, once she&#39;s got over her anger.<br/>
<br/>
So it would be better if she remained angry? That way you&#39;d be able to accept that your solution needed worked on?<br/>
<br/>
If you were all excited about an event and suddenly someone switched it with something that didn&#39;t appeal to you, would you be happy? If, as your feelings faded, you decided to make the best of it, would that be a bad thing? Would it be right for people to feel justified that changing plans at the last moment was a good way to handle things?<br/>
<br/>
You aren&#39;t responsible for her feelings. But do use them as feedback on how well your solution worked. Ask her, away from the situation, what you could do differently next time. It&#39;s your problem, though. Ask her for input. Don&#39;t dump the problem on her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412762134"><div dir="ltr">My 5 year old son also has a fascination with Youtube videos (he likes to watch other people playing Mario Bros.) and it can be challenging to get him to leave his activities at times. &nbsp;We also have 4 children and when we all need or have to go somewhere and there&#39;s no option except for little man to come along, I sometimes allow him to take the iPad or Kindle Fire for the car ride. &nbsp;He knows that once we get to the event, he will have to leave the device in the car, and he&#39;s almost always perfectly fine with that. &nbsp;Once he&#39;s in the car with his brother and sisters, they&#39;re having a good time and interacting, so exiting the car is not so difficult as exiting the house can be.&nbsp;<div>
<br></div><div>Other times, we leave the device at home, and use the methods Sandra was referring to: letting him know he can watch his videos when we get back home, giving him a head&#39;s up as to when we will be leaving and letting him know he will not be able to take the advice, and sometimes a lollipop or gummy snacks help to get him in the car. &nbsp;I like and plan to use the idea that if we do have to leave somewhere quickly, we forgo the Youtube altogether to avoid a messy leave.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Last night he really surprised me because he was watching his videos and I wanted him to shower with me. &nbsp;He really resisted saying that he wanted to take a bath instead. I told him I was not giving baths that night (I was so tired and even the shower sounded like a lot of work). &nbsp;I thought he just wanted to watch Youtube videos and the bath thing was an excuse to have more time. &nbsp;He was so insistent about not taking a shower and since it really didn&#39;t matter whether he did or not, I let him off the shower hook.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Well, lo and behold, I came out of the shower and asked everyone where Zack was. &nbsp;He was not to be found. &nbsp;Suddenly, I got very scared that he was drowning in the bath alone. &nbsp;Well, he wasn&#39;t. &nbsp;But he was very joyfully giving himself a bubble bath in his bathroom! &nbsp;Although I find this a bit dangerous, I am still astounded that he was able to do that! &nbsp;Fill the tub, put in the bubbles, and when I walked in he was actually washing himself with the loofah! &nbsp;I guess he really did want a bath :)</div>

<br><br>




<div dir="ltr">My 10 year old has spent a few months whenever we&#39;ve been at home nearly constantly either playing or watching videos on youtube about minecraft. I have felt very relaxed and positive about this. I&#39;ve engaged with her, helped her when she wanted to make her own videos...everything I think a good unschooling parent should do. And I&#39;ve done it with genuine joy. And now she&#39;s bored of the computer :D<div>
<br></div><div>Anyway, my question isn&#39;t about her, it&#39;s about her younger sister, who is 9 and has now been watching youtube videos for months and months and doing little else. She watches minecraft videos and karaoke versions of Let it Go from Frozen. I am aware enough to see that this is not all she does - she also does archery once a week, sleeps, has stories read to her, watches the odd film or tv programme, rehearses her version of Let it Go over and over and, when I can arrange it, plays with a friend or two. But the vast majority of her time is spent watching youtube and anything else has to be really very sparkly for her to choose it over youtube.&nbsp;<br>
<br>One of the issues is that, because it&#39;s been going on so much longer than it did for the 10 year old, and because it&#39;s so unvarying (ie. she doesn&#39;t play MC much at all, she isn&#39;t inspired to make her own videos or anything from what she&#39;s doing), every now and then I get a niggling voice saying &#39;is this really OK, her sitting hunched in her chair for hour after hour watching Youtube?&#39;. I&#39;m kind of certain it is, as she is a happy, kind, generous child most of the time. She&#39;s reading a lot and writing and working out sums (ie. how much longer until this episode of Stampy finishes) but I&#39;m not quite managing to really trust that this really is OK and to not think that I&#39;m missing something here. I sit with her sometimes, and she chats to me about what she&#39;s seen and explains what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s not that she&#39;s disengaged from the family. Should I really just let go and trust? (which I&#39;m fine with - I just knew you lot would think up something if
 there *was* something I was missing and not paying attention to).</div>
<div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t try to tempt her away from it at all because I know how counter-productive that would be - she clearly hasn&#39;t had her fill of it yet. But my other problem is this (which, based on her history, I don&#39;t think is related to the Youtube-watching): tthe times when I have done my best to make it so she can watch it as much as she wants but I really need her to come with us for some reason - to take one of her sisters somewhere, for instance. She has always been one who, if she doesn&#39;t want to do something, will not budge. She won&#39;t try to see a positive side, she won&#39;t try to see that sometimes it&#39;s important to do something for someone else, she won&#39;t see that she expects her sisters to drop what they&#39;re doing if we need to take her somewhere. This has caused huge rows in the past, before we were unschooling. But now I really do go out of my way to make sure I don&#39;t have to ask her to come away from Youtube - my mum will come and
 watch her if she can, or I get a friend to pick up one of my children. So I find it hard to not feel angry on the odd occasion when I&#39;m just not able to see a solution that suits all of us and I really need her to co-operate with us. (I have four children - just so you can see why the logistics are tricky sometimes). Again, apart from continuing to give her plenty of warning when I need her to come with us, and explaining about give and take etc. and reminding her of the times her sisters help her out, is there anything else I&#39;m missing? I try to avoid &#39;have tos&#39;, so it&#39;s more the frustrating feeling of her sometimes holding the rest of us hostage (if we were to &#39;give in&#39; to her insistence in not budging) or that (on the days DH is around) one of us always has to miss out on the fun thing the rest of the family want to do so that one of us can stay at home with her while she watches Youtube. And that frustration is, in retrospect, always compounded if
 we do make her come out with us and she ends up having a lovely time, once she&#39;s got over her anger.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance for any suggestions and different ways of looking at these situations.</div><div><br></div><div>Clare</div><div><br></div><div><br><br><br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893146014"><div dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1893146014gmail_extra">Behaviorism is giving rewards and punishments in order to shape behavior. Give the child a chocolate every time she gets off youtube when asked so that she is trained to get off quickly in order to get the chocolate. That&#39;s behaviorism. It is something you do to someone. <br>

<br>What was described was a realistic assessment of the situation based on real experience.  If there is a repeated problem, figure out some ways that the problem could be avoided...one way is to keep the child busy with other things to do if you know you&#39;re going to be leaving soon. Another way is to bring the issue to her attention and work together to resolve it - remind her how hard it is when it is time to leave and she&#39;s on youtube and ask her to find something else to do instead. Or remind her of it and suggest she give it a try this time and see if she can do it without it becoming a problem. This is partnership - working together to create a better situation. And, indeed, if the child does decide to behave more cooperatively because she wants to watch youtube before departure time, then it is because she&#39;s realizing that her behavior is causing problems so she&#39;s deciding to change it based on the impact it is having on others. <br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590069369">&lt;&lt;Don&#39;t watch YouTube right now. Do something else, so when it&#39;s time to go you&#39;ll be able to go more easily.&quot; Or don&#39;t even say that—FIND things to do that keep her away from YouTube. If she asks to watch it you could say &quot;I don&#39;t want to say yes, because at [10:00 or whatever], we need to be in the car, and I don&#39;t want to argue with you about it.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the parent and the kid have a history of trust and partnership established, I think this makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
I think it could be easy for a person who is still new to unschooling and figuring out how it works and doesn&#39;t, to take this suggestion and use it as a way of dismissing what their child wants, instead of working to find better, more joyful and peaceful solutions.  I can see this sort of scenario creating antagonism between a parent and child who don&#39;t already have a lot of trust established on both sides. The original post suggested that may be the case.<br/>
<br/>
It does make sense to talk to her about it- not in the moment where it&#39;s happening, and not as a, &#39;I don&#39;t want to say yes to this right now.&#39; In a family where Yes hasn&#39;t been very well established and trustworthy, the child might not hear anything but &quot;No blah blah I don&#39;t care blah blah this is more important than what you want blah blah.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think it might be better if instead of coming from the angle of preventing the child from watching you tube when the family needs to go out- especially since the original poster mentioned that she has negative feelings about her daughter watching it so often, and choosing it over going out with the family- if the mom found ways to support her daughter getting out of the house *and* doing what she loves so much, which is watching you tube. The mom knows her daughter will be happy once they&#39;re out, as she said, so now help her be happy about leaving too.<br/>
Like, if the family needs to be dressed and ready by a certain time, tell her the night before, &quot;Get dressed and (what? Brush your hair? What else does she need to do to be ready?) *before* you sit down at the computer. We are leaving the house at ___.&quot; Set her outfit for the next day and a brush on the keyboard to help her remember.  Can breakfast be portable? Eaten by the computer? Tell her about it, &quot;I&#39;m making muffins tonight so you can eat breakfast at the computer- remember we&#39;re leaving at ___.&quot; Can she chew dental gum in the car instead of brushing her teeth? (I do that sometimes). Set an egg timer next to the computer for 5 minutes before it&#39;s time to go. When the timer goes off, that video is the last video. <br/>
<br/>
Even better- invest in a portable option !!!!!  Instead of &#39;No you can&#39;t get on the computer, we need to leave soon,&#39; the answer can be, &#39;Yes, after you&#39;re dressed and ready, you can watch you tube on the _(whichever device- ours is a smart phone)_. You can bring it to the car when it&#39;s time to go.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
For a child who is so interested in you tube, a portable option will help make her life more full, and help her get out more easily and joyfully.  It will help her have less negative impact on her family without having to choose between something she loves to do and doing what everyone else needs her to do. You can give her options while also bringing to her attention how her behavior impacts the family.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was reacting to the negativity too in my reply. I think though that Sandra&#39;s point that YouTube can be watched later is important in not making the solution more complex than it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
The daughter *is* likely to hear &quot;No,&quot; instead of &quot;Later,&quot; because mom&#39;s negativity is leaking out. But if Mom continues to build trust in other ways, it&#39;s not going to delay the daughter building trust too much.<br/>
<br/>
It would be different if her mother were constantly interrupting something that wasn&#39;t pausable.<br/>
<br/>
If the daughter continues to be upset, I&#39;d dig deeper. Asking her about what&#39;s going on, using Sandra&#39;s Leaning on a Truck as a model would be useful. That is don&#39;t &quot;sit down to talk about it.&quot; Bring it up in the car or while playing, some time away from the incident.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/truck">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>
<br/>
The more respectful a mom can be that her daughter (maybe) doesn&#39;t like to leave the house, the more she feels mom is taking that into account when she can&#39;t stay home, the more her trust will grow.<br/>
<br/>
I was off when I suggested she&#39;ll grow trust when people work to allow her to stay home. From her (kid) point of view, staying home will feel as effortless for others as it is for her. Grandma, who may be inconvenienced, will just show up to watch her. She won&#39;t *feel* the decisions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tell her the night before, &quot;Get dressed and (what? Brush your hair?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think rather than telling her, it&#39;s better if Mom helps her be ready. I know *I&#39;d* much rather jump on the computer than jump in the shower! ;-) The more the mom can help her do the boring stuff -- especially if it&#39;s for something she&#39;s not thrilled about -- the smoother it will go.<br/>
<br/>
Telling her to do certain things -- especially when she&#39;s already shown she isn&#39;t yet capable -- is setting her up to fail.<br/>
<br/>
Before doing it, I would ask her if putting the hairbrush on the keyboard would help her remember. Otherwise it&#39;s a cowardly way for mom to tell her to brush her hair first without mom actually having to say it.<br/>
<br/>
Any solution should be seen as something to try. If it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s not the child&#39;s fault. Not Mom&#39;s fault either! It&#39;s an opportunity to try something else.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a better way to see it is rather than Mom making a decision (We need to be in the car at 8AM) that creates problems for everyone, ask for help in making &quot;everyone in the car by 8AM&quot; happen. Then tackle the various issues together. (Or as much as everyone wants to participate ;-) The more everyone feels invested in problem solving rather than *being* the problem that must be solved, the more cooperative they&#39;ll be.<br/>
