<div id="ygrps-yiv-158994407">Hello All!<br/>
I am an unschooling mother of 3 boys, ages 7,4 and 11 months from <br/>
Massachusettes. This is our first year of homeschooling. We began <br/>
with a curriculum, which I assumed we needed. The stress was unreal, <br/>
so we decided to deschool for a while. I have been reading alot about <br/>
unschooling, and since deschooling is so much fun, we&#39;ve decided to <br/>
deschool forever! <br/>
I am looking forward to learning with you all and hope to maybe share <br/>
some knowledge I might have kicking around here, too. <br/>
I have bi-polar disorder, a sister who is a PS teacher, and a very <br/>
challenging 7 year old who thinks he is 15. <br/>
Nice to meet ya!<br/>
:)Kerry</div>

&lt;&lt; If the child wanted to jump off a bridge, would you tell the mom how to <br/>
help <br/>
 her do it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I jumped off a bridge into a canal in OR one very hot summer while traveling. <br/>
It was one of the most fun things I ever did!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First thing, why wait until next &#39;school year&#39;? Start now. In KS, as <br/>
far as I can see, you just send in the name and address of <br/>
your &#39;school&#39; (that is use your address and make up a name for <br/>
your &quot;unaccredited private school&quot;). That&#39;s it - no records, no <br/>
tests required. Also, the compulsory age in Kansas is 7, so you need <br/>
not do anything until your oldest child has actually turned 7.<br/>
<br/>
Life is learning is living. Just keep on living life as you have <br/>
been - explore, dream, play, live, love. That&#39;s it. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Would unschooling work?&quot; That depends - it CAN work (if by working <br/>
you mean the kids will grow, explore, learn) but you&#39;ll probably <br/>
have the hardest time of it - learning to NOT think in terms of <br/>
school stuff. You won&#39;t see kids (most likely) sitting down <br/>
and &#39;doing math problems&#39;. But you will see them sorting M&Ms or <br/>
dividing cupcakes. Real-life will happen, learning will happen <br/>
(they&#39;ve been learning all their lives so far and that can/will <br/>
continue) but it won&#39;t look at all like school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288331057">I am also in KS.  We have an awesome group here, it is a combo of unschoolers and relaxed home schoolers and is completely inclusive and fee to join.  We mostly meet at parks and hang out and let the kids play.  My kids have made their best friends in this group.  We also do some field trips, and various moms have brought in their own talents to share with kids that are interested.  Anyway let me know where in KS you are and I&#39;ll try to help.<br/>

It will be easier if you don&#39;t focus on that.<br/>
Focus on being with your kids in new and more accepting and more open  ways.  <br/>
Focus on creating or finding experiences that ONE of them will like,  not all <br/>
at once.  Others might join in or not.   Practice not  taking it personally <br/>
if one says &quot;I don&#39;t like this,&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; and don&#39;t push  it.  <br/>
 <br/>
These might help:<br/>

 <br/>
Don&#39;t talk to your husband about it right now, just learn to BE it.   You <br/>
have many months before &quot;school starts,&quot; and your oldest is not schoolage  <br/>
necessarily.<br/>
