  Trevor saw a small clip of the 1981 movie Clash of the Titans on the VH1 <br/>
80&#39;s flashback show and now wants to see it. I can&#39;t find much info about it <br/>
online and the VH1 show didn&#39;t tell me much except that the special effects look <br/>
a little cheesy. Anything I ought to know about it before we rent it? (Trevor <br/>
is 6, the by way, and into monsters. He was attracted to the movie because it <br/>
features Medusa.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614357506">Clash of the Titans is a good movie. Very cheesy effects compared to today, <br/>
but they were good in their time. Lots of Greek Mythology, gods and <br/>
goddesses, the 3 fates.. that sort of thing. Some blood and guts, not a lot <br/>
though.<br/>

The graphics are cheesy, but it was made in &#39;81. We like it, and we also like <br/>
Jason and the Argonauts, made in something like 1963. The effects in both <br/>
movies are about the same. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57147717">I loved this movie when it first came out.  I remember watching it over and over on HBO.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I rented it for the kids.    They liked it too.   It was especially fun to connect all the Gods and Goddesses and children to their stories within the movie.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also was fun to see Dm. Maggie Smith(Prof. McGonagall)  in it.   The kids got a kick out of that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh,,, and discussing how far special effects have come since then!<br/>

They do look cheesy in light of today&#39;s computer-generated standards, but <br/>
for movie buffs they are an important bit of history.<br/>

There was a late-70&#39;s Seven Voyages of Sinbad which had some kind of animated <br/>
skeletons and monsters.  Not quite all the way to classic literature, but <br/>
similar.<br/>

restaurant that Mike takes Celia to is called Harryhousen&#39;s.  The guys <br/>
at Pixar are big fans of his work and wanted to honor him in some way.  :)<br/>

the, er, costumes of the Argonauts are...ehem...superior. Hee<br/>

I thought Titans was boring and Argonauts was...exciting... ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792508269">This is one of my all-time favorite movies! yes, by today&#39;s standards the special effects are cheesy but that&#39;s half the fun of the movie now!!! Basically it follows Perseus through his adventures of capturing Pegasus, beheading Medusa and saving...what&#39;s her face..from the Krakon. <br/>
 <br/>
Let&#39;s see...Harry Hamlin played Perseus. I don&#39;t recall the names of anyone else in it. You should be able to find it relatively easy.<br/>
