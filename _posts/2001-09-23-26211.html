<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780640094">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions on the laundry... What I realized was that I have <br/>
the suggestion that Joyce suggested &quot;a husband that does laundry all the <br/>
time&quot;....  I think it&#39;s hearing him complain and dumping the laundry in the <br/>
living room at 9pm at night and telling me &quot;that&#39;s the 4th load of laundry <br/>
I&#39;ve done&quot;, makes me feel like I&#39;m guilty for not doing it all... I think <br/>
instead of feeling guilty is to just say &quot;I know sweetie, it&#39;s so wonderful <br/>
that you have the stamina and desire to do all that laundry&quot;.... Maybe he <br/>
just wants someone to praise him....<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mind doing a lot of the laundry except the majority is his and the <br/>
boys.  Everytime DH uses a towel it goes in the laundry.... so really looking <br/>
back on what I&#39;ve written this is another problem for my husband to deal with <br/>
and not me (LOL)...<br/>
<br/>
We went through this with the cleaning, when I said I wouldn&#39;t clean the <br/>
bathrooms and he could either hire a cleaner or do it himself.  He moaned and <br/>
groaned for several months doing it (I&#39;d never done bathrooms in our entire 7 <br/>
year relationship) and then he finally said &quot;let&#39;s get a cleaner&quot;.....  Maybe <br/>
the same thing will happen with the laundry....<br/>
<br/>
As for sock, paper clips and pens.... they are all disappearing in my house <br/>
as well...<br/>
