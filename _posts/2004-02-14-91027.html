<div id="ygrps-yiv-971784693">My DD just looked at me and said that she was going to &quot;teach me how <br/>
to learn&quot; (not sure where she got the word teach from unless it&#39;s <br/>
from one of her morning cartoons).  I asked how she was going to <br/>
teach me to learn she said.....by playing mommy! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
