<h4>The Mowery Family</h4>
<time>31 May 2001, at  3:43am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913120456">When I was we little and we lived in VA, my brother found a turtle in the ravine behind our house.  Since he was WAY into his &quot;Ranger Rick&quot; magazine, he convinced my folks that he could care for &quot;Nicky Turtle&quot;.  He did, for a good 4 years.<br/>
<br/>
During these years, Nicky was a valued member of our family.  She was three legged as somehow she lost one of her rear legs in a circumstance we never knew.  My brother epoxyed a hook to her shell, and she was kept on a lease outside during the day, where she was free to wander, and occasionally taken for walks.  She survived a move to michigan, and was successfully put into hibernation 2 winters.  The third winter came quickly and she was not put into hibernation fast enough and got pneumonia and died.  That was a sad time for the family.  Nicky was given a full Roman Catholic burial in our garden that would have rivaled the pope&#39;s with all the pomp and circumstance.  After she was gone, we all swore we could hear her at night, her step-step-step-thud.<br/>
<br/>
Nicky was better than a dog.  She loved scrambled eggs and lettuce.  I should talk to my brother - now I want a turtle - but only if it could be like Nicky.<br/>
