and down the stairs to the basement is wonderful. We have a wonderful cleaner <br/>
named Rosa. Once every two weeks we have to de-clutter a little so she can <br/>
clean, then we go away for a few hours. When we come back the place is <br/>
cleaner than I&#39;d ever do it, and it smells good. We just love her. :)<br/>
