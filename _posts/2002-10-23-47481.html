&lt;&lt; . I&#39;m not going to say &quot;that&#39;s the wrong choice for everyone&quot; because <br/>
that&#39;s just not true, no one can make that decision for everyone.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok. <br/>
So if we follow this piece of logic, then any decision we make is not <br/>
necessarily better than someone elses decision and we have no right to stand <br/>
up for better choices. Because they aren&#39;t really better, only better for us, <br/>
right?<br/>
NOT!!<br/>
Love is better than hate, kindness is better than anger (although anger has <br/>
it&#39;s place), gentleness is better than violence, respect is better than <br/>
disrespect, children having equal respect is better, children having a voice <br/>
is better, children feeling safe and listened to and not like possessions is <br/>
BETTER.<br/>
Yes, better.<br/>
 Not equal to all other choices, not the same, BETTER.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s go back some years.....there were these women that were looked down on, <br/>
shunned for their views. They were called sufragettes.<br/>
They were willing to stand up for what they believed, in the face of <br/>
rejection and scorn, because what they believed was BETTER. It was right.<br/>
And eventually they changed the world, changed our lives and the lives of <br/>
free women most everywhere.<br/>
Going by your logic, no one should have tried to convince anyone else it was <br/>
wrong to not allow women to vote, or stop being the property of their <br/>
husbands.<br/>
Because it was all just choices.<br/>
There are some things that are just plain wrong.<br/>
I don&#39;t care if the world agrees, or if other parents just see it as a <br/>
choice, violence upon more helpless beings is wrong. Just plain wrong.<br/>
The more people that begin to have a paradiagm shift, the more people that <br/>
don&#39;t accept this as just another choice, the faster we can have societal <br/>
change and better lives for all children.<br/>
Choices are not all equal.<br/>
Some are better than others.<br/>
Without my sense of judgement, where would I be?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137547205">Did anyone catch the Dr. Phil show today?<br/>
Even HE was standing up against spanking, against millions of viewers!<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t agree with Dr. Phil&#39;s philosophy about everything, but when a<br/>
respected Dr. can speak out against spanking, then I believe anybody who<br/>
disagrees with spanking SHOULD say &quot;that&#39;s the wrong choice for everyone&quot;,<br/>
because it IS true. Spanking is NOT an effective way of discipline or<br/>
punishment, it is a way of instilling fear in children and getting them to<br/>
&quot;sometimes&quot; do what you what by hitting them. It also teaches them the<br/>
overall message that it&#39;s okay for big people to hit little people, or that<br/>
hitting is a way to solve problems.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t defend people&#39;s rights to hit children. It&#39;s just plain wrong.<br/>
