<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428840474">Hi *<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m German, and unfortunately, homeschooling is illegal in my country.<br/>
A few days ago, I have created a web site for promoting respectful<br/>
parenting and natural learning in Germany. <br/>
<br/>
One of the first reactions I got had some of the typical BUTs in it:<br/>
1. Do you think unschooling/homeschooling also works for learning about<br/>
the division of polynomials?<br/>
2. Do you think unschooling is restricted to a certain age or does it<br/>
also work with 14-year-olds?<br/>
3. What about the children not getting to know learning together with<br/>
their peers? (the typical socialization question)<br/>
<br/>
What would you as experienced unschoolers tell a bunch of people who<br/>
have never heard of homeschooling and live in a country where<br/>
homeschooling is illegal? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also looking for sources of grown-up homeschoolers/unschoolers who<br/>
speak about their experience with not going to school and what they<br/>
liked or not liked about it - though the latter is not very likely I<br/>
suppose. Please let me know about any web sites / books / articles that<br/>
come to your mind!<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in having a look at my site, you can find it at<br/>
www.unschooling.de. Feedback, comments, suggestions are always welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134148913">1. Do you think unschooling/homeschooling also works for learning about<br/>
the division of polynomials?<br/>
<br/>
No, but neither does school.  I&#39;m gonna answer a question with a question.<br/>
Do people in Germany USE this math a lot?  In what occupations?  I know<br/>
engineers & mathematicans here in Canada that never ever use all the math<br/>
people THINK they use.  And if they need to use it, they get a book and look<br/>
up HOW to use it.<br/>
<br/>
So, what would happen if that cirriculum was not taught?  Who would notice?<br/>
Economic collapse?  Sounds pretty arrogant to me that one is educated only<br/>
if you can divide a poly-whatsit.<br/>
<br/>
2. Do you think unschooling is restricted to a certain age or does it also<br/>
work with 14-year-olds?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it works for 14 months, 14 year olds, 25, 55, 95 year olds.  The human<br/>
cycle of &quot;life-long learning&quot; seems to me to be 1) curiosity, 2)<br/>
investigation, 3) knowledge acquistion 4) practice, practice, practice, 5)<br/>
mastery.  Martial arts being a great example. Zen-based arts do not pursue<br/>
the learner.  If you want to learn, practice.  If you don&#39;t, leave.  I  know<br/>
you have Aikido in Germany.  Mastery of that particular art would be a fine<br/>
example of this cycle.<br/>
<br/>
So, we allow it in adults, but impose a different cycle on kids in desks.<br/>
1) boredom or neutrality to ward most topics at best, 2) attend to someone<br/>
else&#39;s knowledge dispersal, if you can, 3) write it on a piece of paper, 4)<br/>
re-read it later for the test (studying) 5) re-write it later on the test.<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;Coloring Outside The Lines: Raising a Smarter Kid by Breaking All the<br/>
Rules&quot; (Publisher: Harper Collins),  Roger Schank lays out how to break the<br/>
sitting-in-desk cycle of learning WITHIN the school.  He also argues<br/>
strongly against the poly-whatits in your #1.<br/>
<br/>
3. What about the children not getting to know learning together with their<br/>
peers? (the typical socialization question)<br/>
<br/>
Here in Canada our most right-wing think tank did a study on homeschooling<br/>
(calling unschooling left wing John Holt followers) and found that home<br/>
educated kids are BETTER socialized, not worse.  Here&#39;s the link:<br/>

<br/>
If I was stuck in Germany with kids, I would use Roger Schank&#39;s ideas and<br/>
lobby like crazy for change.  :O)<br/>

<br/>
Do you think he will need it in real life? <br/>
Yes? Then of course he will find it and learn it.<br/>
No? Then why learn it in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Do you think unschooling is restricted to a certain age or does it<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the natural learning that happens before 6 (school age) and after <br/>
graduation. So YES, it works for all ages. Those in-between ages (6-18/22/26) are <br/>
doing SIMULATED learning in schools. If allowed to REALLY learn, yes it works <br/>
then too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. What about the children not getting to know learning together with<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine learn with their peers, with those younger, and with those MUCH older. <br/>
<br/>
Learning is NOT natural is a class of thirty children---they learn, sure, but <br/>
they learn to hate learning and they learn to put off learning what interests <br/>
them at the time.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d prefer that my children learn social cues from other responsible, <br/>
polite, gentle people of all ages than from a dictator and 29 other nine year <br/>
olds who don&#39;t want to be there in the first place!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you in Germany! I miss it!<br/>

&gt;1. Do you think unschooling/homeschooling also works for learning about<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think learning how stuff works by doing it works SO much better than <br/>
being stuffed with a formula and regurgitating it on demand. I was <br/>
really good at math in school, but never did comprehend the actual <br/>
mechanics of how some of that math works until I was in my twenties. <br/>
Some of it I still don&#39;t understand. But I got great grades!<br/>
<br/>
My husband, on the other hand, realized he needed to learn calculus to <br/>
do what he wanted to do, got a book and taught it to himself over the <br/>
summer. He&#39;d similarly taught himself algebra a few summers earlier <br/>
because it was important to him for a goal he wanted to pursue. (This <br/>
same guy didn&#39;t learn to read in school, either.)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is the usual age at which German kids enter institutions--school, <br/>
daycare or whatever first gets them away from their parents? They learn <br/>
many things earlier than that, which aren&#39;t *taught* to them. They can <br/>
continue learning like that if they&#39;re allowed to.<br/>
<br/>
I think, though, that some variation of the &quot;socialization&quot; objection is <br/>
true--they won&#39;t become assimilated into the school-culture if they <br/>
don&#39;t have those experiences. To the extent that unquestioning obedience <br/>
is important, homeschooling/unschooling may not be acceptable.<br/>

My understanding of the German education system is really limited, but<br/>
one idea that I do like is the idea of apprenticeships.  What I like is<br/>
the idea that the science and mathematics that one learns can be applied<br/>
to a real context and be &quot;meaningful&quot; at the time it is learned.<br/>
<br/>
I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of California (Davis)<br/>
and the knowledge was almost all gone from my brain by the time I had a<br/>
job and might have used the information.  I was a fairly hard-working<br/>
student and I found this outcome to be quite disappointing.  When the<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;1. Do you think unschooling/homeschooling also works for learning about<br/>
the division of polynomials?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes I actually think unschooling will work for anything that the child/adult<br/>
is interested in. Whenever there is a need to learn something, there will be<br/>
a way to find out how to do it. And having the need and want usually means<br/>
more enjoyment in learning and then easier to learn it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;2. Do you think unschooling is restricted to a certain age or does it<br/>

<br/>
No I don&#39;t think it&#39;s restricted at all and does work with older kids too. I<br/>
just see people using the unschooling term to apply to kids of &quot;schooling&quot;<br/>
age. But the concept can go way past being 18. Many adults decide they are<br/>
interested in something, either for pleasure or work, find a way to learn it<br/>
and then do it! Same thing really.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;3. What about the children not getting to know learning together with<br/>

I actually don&#39;t know any homeschoolers/unschoolers who don&#39;t have many<br/>
friends to interact with. I&#39;m sure they are out there but I don&#39;t know of<br/>
them. I would be wondering about anyone who had no interaction at all with<br/>
people and would find it hard to believe it can be easily done.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872757316">Steffi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad to see that many people responded to your questions already.<br/>
<br/>
I think that part of why Germans have such a hard time getting unschooling<br/>
has to do with the early out of the house mentality.  Because children<br/>
normally start kindergarten (like pre-school in America) at 3, so many<br/>
parents just don&#39;t see that their children could learn without an organized<br/>
program.  It&#39;s not just a different mindset, it&#39;s a totally different way of<br/>
life!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1. Do you think unschooling/homeschooling also works for learning about<br/>
&gt; the division of polynomials?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, I went to school for 13 years, then college and I have a master&#39;s<br/>
degree as well.  Remind me again what polynomials are and why I&#39;d possibly<br/>
care!  School guarantees that you&#39;ll learn what someone else thinks you<br/>
should know and then forget it because you&#39;re not using it.  Unschooling<br/>
guarantees that you may never learn anything about polynomials unless you<br/>
need it or care to know it, and because of that, you&#39;ll probably remember<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Do you think unschooling is restricted to a certain age or does it<br/>
&gt; also work with 14-year-olds?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you told them about deschooling?  I haven&#39;t been to your website yet.<br/>
Of course it works with 14 year olds.  But it isn&#39;t going to work instantly,<br/>
as they&#39;ve been schooled all their lives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. What about the children not getting to know learning together with<br/>
&gt; their peers? (the typical socialization question)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Socialization happens everywhere.  School, church, playgrounds, scouts,<br/>
sports clubs, shopping, etc.  Learning to work together isn&#39;t the priority<br/>
of schools, where children compete against each other for grades and the<br/>
teacher&#39;s attention.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; What would you as experienced unschoolers tell a bunch of people who<br/>
&gt; have never heard of homeschooling and live in a country where<br/>
&gt; homeschooling is illegal?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try using some of the ideas of unschooling and attachment parenting in your<br/>
home.  Do you have Sandra&#39;s article about school on your own terms<br/>
translated and up on the web site?  That&#39;s an interesting take on not<br/>
playing the school game.<br/>
<br/>
And I know that you (or somebody I was talking to) had once said that it<br/>
appeared that someone in Germany was challenging the ban on homeschooling<br/>
politically.  Germany has worked a great deal on getting rid of many things<br/>
that still linger from WWII, working for cutbacks in American forces here<br/>
and all that.  Maybe it&#39;s time to get rid of this ban, too.<br/>

Thank you, Sandra Dodd, for adding me to your page. I&#39;ll contact you<br/>
privately about including any texts of yours for my web site.<br/>
<br/>
Please give me more time for digesting all your postings. It&#39;s great to<br/>
be here, at least virtually, I&#39;m part of a great unschooling community,<br/>
hope it will be IRL too, some day!<br/>
<br/>
Bye,<br/>
