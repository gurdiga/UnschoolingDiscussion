&lt;&lt; As far as I know, there are only 2 spiders that are poisonous in the US, <br/>
the black widow which is all black and has a red hour glass on their abdomen. <br/>
 And the brown recluse which is a tannish brown and has a violin-shaped thing <br/>
behind the head.  You really don&#39;t have to worry about the other spiders, <br/>
their palps are too short to penetrate human skin.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Is the Brown Recluse the same as the boxing spider. These hide in wood <br/>
piles predominantly. We had an article in the paper about a year ago w/ <br/>
drawings. We actually found one in the log wood hay rack in the pasture this <br/>
past summer. I was shocked to find one, they are small but very <br/>
distinguishable due to their big boxing glove looking things. Very technical <br/>
terms you know. ;o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205976206">There are *four* spiders that are considered poisonous in the U.S.  The Hobo<br/>
spider (originanlly from Europe and now spreading from Washington state<br/>
where it arrived in the 20s or 30s via ship) is also sometimes known as the<br/>
boxing spider.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of folks that think they have been bitten by Brown Recluses have<br/>
actually been bitten by Hobo spiders, btw.  So folks that think they don&#39;t<br/>
have any Brown Recluses where they live and therefore are safe, should find<br/>
out if the Hobo has migrated to their area yet.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: RE: poisonous spiders in our house<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m with you, Valerie - I don&#39;t like those critters in my house. So<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been wondering about those electronic bug deterrent devices.<br/>
&gt; Anyone have any experience with them? Do they really do what they<br/>
&gt; claim to do, which is keep all the creepy crawlies at bay? Apparently<br/>
&gt; some even work for rodents...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Helen, dubious but ever hopeful &lt;g&gt;<br/>
We had one in the basementof our old farmhouse for a while--hoping to invite<br/>
mice and spiders to leave. We removed it when the spider webs began to cover<br/>
it!  But this one was really inexpensive--maybe higher quality ones work<br/>
better.<br/>
