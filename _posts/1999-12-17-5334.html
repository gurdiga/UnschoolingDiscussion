<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203342037">Hi Unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I have been enjoying reading all your interesting posts and realized I hadn&#39;t made my presence known yet.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Betsy Wright and I live in Lakeland, FL.  Today is my last day of &quot;work&quot; and after the holidays I&#39;ll begin homeschooling 3 of our kids.  (Our 13 year old can&#39;t spell either, by the way)  <br/>
<br/>
I have been doing alot of research on unschooling and am ready to give it a try.  My husband is a little leary, but also willing to try.  I think the kids think I&#39;m kidding when they ask me all these questions about what homeschool will be like.  At this point I am just telling them I&#39;m not sure exactly what we&#39;ll be doing - because frankly - I don&#39;t know.  They want to know if they&#39;ll have to do P.E., take tests, sit at a desk etc.  I ask them:  &quot;Do you want to take tests - Do you want me to give you specific assignments?&quot;.  They are just baffled at the thought that things are not going to be completely scheduled and dictated.  So I told me husband that this is a great opportunity to begin to allow unschooling to happen naturally.  The kids are sufficiently confused and off guard, so this is the perfect time to start :)<br/>
<br/>
We have ordered curriculum through Core Curriculum Of America.  They put materials together for each of our kids based on their interests, strengths, weaknesses, likes, dislikes, personalities, etc.  I told the kids when we get our materials in next week, my husband David and I would sit down with each of them individually and discuss what they would like to learn, time frames and so on.  That has satisfied them - for now.<br/>
<br/>
I have started a web page just for fun, but had an interesting idea.  I have enjoyed going through a number of sites other homeschooling families have put together and found them interesting and informative - especially what their days are like.  I haven&#39;t come across anything that chronicles the (mis)adventures of a family who is just plunging into the whole home/unschooling arena.  Have any of you seen any sites like this? Most of the accounts I&#39;ve seen start out like, &quot;We have been homeschooling for xx number of years and here is how we do it&quot;.  What I would like to do is chronicle our unschooling efforts for a full year - maybe even daily entries - for all of 2000.  It may turn out to be completely boring or it may be inspiring to someone who is interested but afraid to try.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or suggestions or if you are in the Lakeland area and want to get together! - I look forward to hearing from you.<br/>

Betsy, I look forward to your chronicle.  This is our first year of home <br/>
schooling also.  We started out really structured and have found out that it <br/>
doesn&#39;t work for us.  I&#39;ve talked with my oldest about where we&#39;re going <br/>
after the first of the year.  She is a little nervous, as she has been for <br/>
the past month, about unschooling, but has expressed that the more <br/>
differently we do things from her former school, the more she has liked it.  <br/>

<br/>
We are relaxed or un (depending on our mood and your definition) <br/>
homeschoolers and we live in Hobe Sound, FL.  This is our first year and I <br/>
have a 6 1/2 yo boy and 5 yo daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Your post made me giggle because I had thought I would keep our daily <br/>
log/journal on the computer too.  Not to post -- just to have instead of the <br/>
handwritten version we have now.   I wish you luck in getting it up and <br/>
running and maintained -- I&#39;d love to see it -- but -- I warn you -- the days <br/>
fly by!!  Last night I sat down and tried to write down several things we&#39;ve <br/>
done since the last time I posted to our journal.  It had been 3 days and I <br/>
hadn&#39;t even realized!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Lakeland is probably too far for a visit but I would love to see the <br/>
progress you make on the computerized journal.  To someone not involved, it <br/>
might be boring but if you&#39;re going thru it, I think it would be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with everything!!<br/>
<br/>
Nance<br/>
<br/>
P.S. We don&#39;t use any sort of organized curriculum so I hope you willl let us <br/>
know what you think of that too!</div>
