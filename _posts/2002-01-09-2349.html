<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420289670">Hi Julie:<br/>
<br/>
Yes that&#39;s me from &quot;the other list&quot;, which I no longer subscribe too....<br/>
Thanks for the input about the deschooling.  I guess I&#39;m figuring this thing<br/>
out one day at a time.  The more I realize it&#39;s about letting go the more I<br/>
look at others who are not doing the same and wondering why it&#39;s so<br/>
important for them to buy into the &quot;old way&quot; of doing things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently had to walk away from a friendship with someone that I&#39;d known<br/>
for a long time.  I just stopped calling her as I was finding it more and<br/>
more difficult to have conversations that were &quot;safe&quot;... She was having so<br/>
many problems with her 2  kids in school and I (a) cannot relate to that and<br/>
(b) my answer is &quot;take them out&quot;...  She doesn&#39;t want to hear that because<br/>
then she&#39;d have to quit her job and she also told me she could never do what<br/>
I was doing (unschooling) because she wanted to make sure they learned<br/>
something.... I guess this is all part of the deschooling of myself.<br/>

&lt;&lt;how long will it take me to deschool ?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
I remember you from the other list (that is currently discussing why bed<br/>
times are a good thing and why unschooling doesn&#39;t work for everyone<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I believe we will be deschooling for the rest of our lives.  Basically, we<br/>
were brainwashed into seeing something normal and beautiful as something<br/>
artificial and coercive.  I&#39;m constantly catching myself thinking inside the<br/>
box, taking a close look, and realizing that particular box doesn&#39;t really<br/>
exist....I had just been programmed to think it does.</div>

<br/>
Ease.<br/>
Going along.<br/>
<br/>
Most people go along with the crowd, literally and figuratively and <br/>
emotionally and any other way they can manage to be carried along in the <br/>
stream.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She was having so<br/>
many problems with her 2  kids in school&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But she can blame school.<br/>
And Society.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She doesn&#39;t want to hear that because<br/>
then she&#39;d have to quit her job and she also told me she could never do what<br/>
I was doing (unschooling) because she wanted to make sure they learned<br/>
something...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, you&#39;re shaming her.  She WANTS to be innocent in the <br/>
situation, and if you keep on telling her she has options you will rob her of <br/>
her innocence.<br/>
<br/>
AND...  <br/>
She reveals the lack of thought she&#39;s put into the fact that you&#39;re <br/>
unschooling by saying right in plain-daylight English that she suspects your <br/>
kids won&#39;t learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
I would let it go.  <br/>
<br/>
Wait a couple of years and see what things look like.<br/>
