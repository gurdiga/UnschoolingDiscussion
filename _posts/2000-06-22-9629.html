<div>from one adoptive/foster care mom to another ~&gt; I agree&nbsp; ... w/ the 
foster care&nbsp;and adoptions system it&#39;s best to TREAD THOSE WATERS CAUTIOUSLY 
and PLAY THEIR GAME,&nbsp;just keep your eye on the prize (your dch) and go 
along w/ whatever the caseworkers want :P&nbsp;&nbsp; dh and I were foster 
parents for years and we&nbsp; adopted our two youngest (private adoptions), so 
we&#39;ve literally sat on both sides of the fence .. working w/i *that* system is 
like living under a crucible 24/7; believe me they&#39;ll know anything/everything 
about you, better than your very own mother does!!!&nbsp; good luck and those 
little butterflies will be WELL WORTH the pains of dealing w/ a 
very&nbsp;rigid/temperamental system ... *wow*, both of 
our&nbsp;dss&#39;&nbsp;adoptions were finalized in 6 mths, GOODNESS, I can&#39;t imagine 
waiting an entire YEAR to have those papers in my hot little hand???&nbsp; of 
course, different states have different laws, so just play by their 
rules!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just&nbsp;remember, when&nbsp;all is said and done, 
you can have your fm bed WHEN YOU GET THE BUREAUCRATS OUTTA YOUR LIFE and that 
day WILL COME, just hold on!!!&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>btw, I&#39;m curious Nanci, what does&nbsp;your caseworker(s) think&nbsp;about 
your family h-s&#39;ing or for that matter</div>
<div>*unschooling*???&nbsp; how did you answer *those* 
questions???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes, you can luck out and find very 
open~minded&nbsp;caseworkers but those are *rare* jewels who unfortunately have 
to work w/ a very regulated bureaucratic system!!!&nbsp;dh always says 
&quot;God&nbsp;bless the Baptist and the bureaucrats&quot; (btw, we&#39;re Baptist 
&lt;G&gt;)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HANG IN THERE and keep us posted!!!</div>

  <div><br></div>Nanci-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations on your adoption. 
  That must be such an exciting time. It is too bad that you will be under such 
  tough scrutiny and the family bed could be considered &quot;dangerous.&quot; Of course 
  it depends on the individual child, but you would think these &quot;unwanted&quot; 
  children would receive the greatest benefit from the closeness and security of 
  the family bed.<br>

  <blockquote><tt><br>&lt;sigh&gt;<br>We sometimes take the kids into our beds 
    for the usual, nightmares, can&#39;t sleep, need reassurance, etc. &nbsp;But we 
    are in the middle of adoption from foster care and I&#39;m afraid that we will 
    not be able to have a family bed, although I would like to. &nbsp;Kids from 
    foster care have issues, pasts, inappropriate boundaries, etc, as well as 
    being hyper analyzed by the system for over the first year after the 
    adoption. &nbsp;We have to be very careful. &nbsp;Ideas that are too much 
    off of mainstream are frowned on.<br></tt></blockquote><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a
