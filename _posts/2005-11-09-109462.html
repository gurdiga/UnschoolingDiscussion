If she wants to see it after you have offered your best caveats, let her see<br/>
it!  She can leave the room anytime she wants, right?  If she is scared for<br/>
days afterward, she can talk to you about it, or climb into bed with you for<br/>
comfort, etc... right?  I think kids are ready for things when they say they<br/>
are ready.  Try not to feel guilty about it either!  She&#39;s got your hand to<br/>
hold... which is why she is brave enough to say she wants to see it now.<br/>

might make the nature of the movie more clear to her than a verbal <br/>
description.  I think my middle son decided he didn&#39;t want to see <br/>
Freddy vs. Jason based on the trailer he saw online.  You might be <br/>
able to find it if you do a search.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392037646">Hi Aubrey,<br/>
 It sounds like maybe she thinks she is missing out on<br/>
something that her brother gets to do. I have a 6 1/2<br/>
year old daughter as well. In our family just because<br/>
one gets to do something doesn&#39;t mean that the other<br/>
does(not that it&#39;s like that in your family). That is<br/>
very hard sometimes but we work through the feelings.<br/>
In this situation I would absolutely not let my<br/>
daughter see that movie. I don&#39;t think my daughter<br/>
could grasp what she is going to see, no matter what I<br/>
told her about it or what pictures I showed her. I<br/>
feel that part of my job as her mom is to know certain<br/>
things about her and make some decisions for her that<br/>
she may not like.  <br/>
         warmly, Kimberly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947344485">If you get the DVD, you could sit with your son (or get your husband to) and <br/>
have the remote right at hand.   Pause often to discuss special effects and <br/>
acting, and to remind them that there&#39;s a camera crew there, sound guys, <br/>
director, assistants, LOTS of people in the room.   <br/>
<br/>
If your daughter wants to see some, find some parts that arent&#39; too scary and <br/>
let her see some of that, so she can say she did, but I would hold her, and <br/>
keep her moving, mess with her hands, don&#39;t let her get sucked in.   Don&#39;t <br/>
settle in with popcorn to watch the whole movie.   Little bits, broken up, and let <br/>
them NOT watch when and if they don&#39;t want to.   <br/>
<br/>
Having the two hour experience of a movie with other stimuli blocked out <br/>
(darkness, soft chair, movie-style) with the full scary soundtrack and no side <br/>
conversations is too much even for lots of adults!    Having the side-analysis, <br/>
lights on, conversation, &quot;Oh look!   I bet I know how they did that&quot; version <br/>
isn&#39;t going to be as scary at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381365463">Aubrey, I am of the same opinion as Kimberly. You know your <br/>
daughter, and you know that she is very sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
No amount of warning her of the movie&#39;s violence and how scary it <br/>
is, showing her images, the trailer, etc. are going to prepare her <br/>
for that kind of horror movie. A child who hears that a movie is <br/>
incredibly scary will think of the scariest movie he or she has seen <br/>
up until that point and assume that is what the parent is talking <br/>
about. Most children who have not been exposed to movies such as <br/>
this before simply do NOT have the experience to imagine what it is <br/>
going to be like, and to anticipate the extent to which it may <br/>
disturb them. Now, if your daughter really loved horror movies and <br/>
didn&#39;t upset easily, it might be a different sotry, yet it seems <br/>
like this is not the case. My daughter is extremely sensitive as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Take her somewhere fun and special one afternoon, while her brother <br/>
and father watch the movie at home. Or, if it turns out she isn&#39;t <br/>
just interested in Freddy vs. Jason because her brother is (which I <br/>
suspect she is), then watch some *less-horrific* horror movies with <br/>
her if she would like and first see how she responds to those. Then <br/>
go from there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182402568">I don&#39;t know how sensitive either of your kids are, but I am almost 34 years old and I **still** have nightmares when it comes to Freddy.<br/>
 <br/>
This is just my opinion, of course, but I think he is really the most terrifying thing I&#39;ve ever heard of.  I mean, think about it - this is a bad guy who either can&#39;t be killed or resurrects himself if the kids do manage to kill him.  He feeds off your fear and gets stronger every second.  He plays mind games with the kids in the movie and no one is *EVER* safe, even when the movie is over.  In at least one of the movies, Freddy actually kills the girl&#39;s parents and poses as the dad&#39;s ghost who has come to tell her he loves her before going to heaven.  She hugs him and tells him goodbye and that she loves him and then he kills her!!!  Can you imagine your **own father*** stabbing you in the guts with a hand full of knives???  This is ***not*** something I want my kids to worry about!!!  I would probably (definitely?) err on the side of caution when it comes to terror!!!<br/>
 <br/>
I guess I was about 12 the first time I saw a Freddy movie - I was spending the night at my cousin&#39;s house and there were a bunch of us kids and my aunt.  She sat in the kitchen area with the light on and laughed at us!!!<br/>
 <br/>
We, in our infinite wisdom, turned off all the lights, pulled our blankets around and settled in.  Oh, did I mention it was storming horribly that night???  I don&#39;t know how many times we &quot;lucked out&quot; with huge lightning flashes or thunder rolls just at a horribly scary moment in the movie...<br/>
 <br/>
Several times something happened in the movie and all us kids dove underneath whatever furniture we could reach, sometimes shoving someone else out the other side!!!  My aunt almost fell off the chair laughing so hard, but I can assure you I woke up in tears screaming for a long time thereafter.  To be fair, I don&#39;t think the other kids dreamed about it like I did, at least I didn&#39;t hear about it, but I thought it was awful to be so afraid!<br/>
 <br/>
I did watch a few more Freddy movies as I got older but always with all the lights on, a bunch of people talking and distracting me and I paused the movies a LOT!  I never even got through all of them and I skipped the Jason movies almost altogether.  I saw the H20 movie finally, but I was in my late 20&#39;s at least!!!<br/>
 <br/>
And to make it worse, a few years ago when they remade the movie about the guy with the chainsaw, the boyfriend wanted to go with a bunch of our friends.  I was dubious, but I agreed.<br/>
 <br/>
BIG MISTAKE!!!  I absolutely HATED the movie, got so scared that I nearly vomited right in the theater and literally had nightmares almost every single night for 2 months!!!<br/>
 <br/>
I may be more reactive to these kinds of things than others since I have an extremely VIVID imagination, but my point is that once you are exposed to that, you can&#39;t sweep it up and put it back in its box.  It&#39;s there and you either deal with it or suffer like I do.  (Yes, I really do consider this suffering - nightmares and uncontrollable nausea can be very hard things to live with.)<br/>
 <br/>
You have to be the one to decide if your son and daughter are ready for these movies since you know them better than anyone, and truthfully, you are the one who will have to deal with any fallout.  I hope that whatever decision you come to, it works out for everyone!<br/>
 <br/>
(I guess it&#39;s pretty obvious whether my kids (age 7, 3 and 1) would be allowed to see these anytime soon!  &lt;laugh!&gt;)<br/>

movies.   I haven&#39;t seen Jaws.   Might someday.   Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
But if a kid of mine really wanted to see it, I would sit on the couch next <br/>
to her (it would probably be Holly) and pause lots, and discuss.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4748342">Here&#39;s an update---<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I took my daughter (Emma) to lunch and to play at McDonalds then<br/>
grocery shopping. We had a special time together and she got some treats. My<br/>
husband watched the movie with my son (Dillon). Dillon kept the remote in<br/>
his hand with his thumb on the fast forward button. (He did FF though some<br/>
parts.)  We came home about 10 minutes before it was over. It was the ending<br/>
scene with the big fight between Freddie and Jason. My daughter sat down on<br/>
my lap and watched the ending.  When it was over she turned to me and said,<br/>
&quot;I must have missed the scary part.&quot; I said, &quot;You didn&#39;t think that was<br/>
scary?&quot; She said, as if I was a total idiot, &quot;It&#39;s only a movie!&quot;  Smarter<br/>
than I gave her credit for apparently.<br/>
<br/>
My son wasn&#39;t terribly impressed with it. He said that he thought it was a<br/>
&quot;trashy money maker&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I personally LOVE horror movies. I saw Amityville Horror when I was 6 and<br/>
slept on my mom&#39;s floor for about 2 months. Now I can&#39;t seem to find one<br/>
that scares me at all and believe me I&#39;ve tried. I guess I never will since<br/>
I think like my daughter. <br/>
<br/>
My son did sleep with me last night but he always does so that didn&#39;t mean<br/>
anything. What surprised me was that Emma opted to sleep in her own room<br/>
last night. Go figure kids!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the wonderful and thoughtful advise. I really didn&#39;t know<br/>
what to do. <br/>
