&gt;&gt; If an unschooling phrase doesn&#39;t say anything bad about schools, it&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt;&gt; great phrase. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why should unschoolers focus on the badness of schools at all? Isn&#39;t that<br/>
&gt; focusing on the blot we left behind rather than focusing the whole rest of<br/>
&gt; the world?<br/>

<br/>
As I understood the request, it was for ways to turn her house into a<br/>
billboard about how good Unschooling is. Being directly across the street<br/>
from the public school, the implication was clear to me that she wanted to<br/>
say something positive about not going to school to everyone in that school,<br/>
and intended to do it every day.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t hear about her motive, so it was easy to assume that she was<br/>
trying to 1. Tell them that she supported homeschooling/unschooling, 2. She<br/>
wanted to attract attention to her position and 3. wanted to find new people<br/>
who might be interested in home/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, by requesting &quot;great phrases&quot; she was clearly not trying<br/>
to avoid controversy and was, in fact, asking for a confrontation if she<br/>
persisted. &quot;Great unschooling phrases&quot; cannot help but carry the implication<br/>
that school sucks, it seems to me.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that in the slight possibility that she didn&#39;t understand the<br/>
above, I felt it helpful to tell her that teachers and their unions are<br/>
extremely defensive of their jobs and their work, and when they are<br/>
threatened, will lash out. They will always say, however, that whatever they<br/>
do is &quot;for the children.&quot; Of course, that is never true.</div>

not to bash school, but you have stated in that same e-mail:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Great unschooling phrases&quot; cannot help but carry the implication<br/>

<br/>
YOU haven&#39;t figured out a way to live an unschooling life without focussing <br/>
on the suckitude of school.  Many other people have, and this list is <br/>
intended to be in THAT vein, not in the political darkness you keep bringing <br/>
back.<br/>

the children&quot;, your whole thesis is going to fall apart.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
*Maybe* what you mean is &quot;A phrase won&#39;t draw the attention of confirmed<br/>
schoolers to unschooling unless it says something bad about school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not that that&#39;s true either. (True as in &quot;I&#39;ve been putting up phrases for<br/>
years and have talked to people about how they felt and studied the<br/>
resultant effects of various kinds of phrases.&quot;) Though it might be<br/>
someone&#39;s opinion/theory.<br/>
<br/>
Words count. They are the trucks that carry what&#39;s in our heads to other<br/>
people&#39;s heads. If we use the wrong words, the message doesn&#39;t get<br/>
transfered. And in fact quite often a different message than the one we<br/>
intended to send gets transfered.<br/>
<br/>
But good intentions don&#39;t change a false statement into a true one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I felt it helpful to tell her that teachers and their unions are<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never? Where *are* all these selfish teachers you keep harping about? I&#39;ve<br/>
never met any. Why is every teacher *you&#39;ve* met so selfish?<br/>
<br/>
If every teacher you&#39;ve met is selfish, isn&#39;t it possible that what you&#39;re<br/>
saying and the way you&#39;re saying it is attracting angry teachers to you? In<br/>
fact I&#39;d bet you&#39;re *causing* a lot of angry responses in otherwise<br/>
reasonable teachers. It&#39;s becoming self-fulfilling.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago on Phil Donahue there was an exotic dancer/model/stripper or<br/>
somesuch with enormous breasts. Her breasts were basically her career. And<br/>
she had nothing nice to say about men. She&#39;d been raped 11 times or<br/>
something like that and was firmly convinced that every single man was just<br/>
inches away from dumping wife and family for a chance to get his hands on<br/>
her. She just wasn&#39;t in a position to see that her career wasn&#39;t going to<br/>
draw the good men to her, only the lowest element.<br/>
<br/>
Schools are bad enough without exaggerating and falsifying what&#39;s going on.<br/>
We can help people understand why school feels so right and attractive<br/>
without blasting them with opinions that don&#39;t match their reality. I&#39;d bet<br/>
the scare tactics are only effective on people burned by the system who are<br/>
looking for someone who shares their anger. It&#39;s going to shut the ears of<br/>
most everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is for everyone drawn to more natural ways of learning, not just<br/>
those who hate school. In fact hating school shouldn&#39;t be a reason for<br/>
unschooling. Though it&#39;s a good reason for homeschooling. But how someone<br/>
goes about homeschooling should be based on their kids, not on their anger.<br/>

might even be one on this list.<br/>
