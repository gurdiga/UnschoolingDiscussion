You are REALLY pissing me off now.<br/>
<br/>
If people were sitting in my own private worlds, you wouldn&#39;t have this list <br/>
to come and irritate people on.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Wonder how we <br/>
would feel if some sicko person did something dreadful to one of our <br/>
children?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
DO YOU!?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the rest of us don&#39;t care about sickos, but you do?<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you log off and go prevent some child abuse, unlike the rest of us <br/>
who are just isolated in our peaceful unschooling homes?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We cannot sit in our peaceful little worlds and ignore the pain and <br/>
suffering <br/>
happening right outside our doorsteps.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are a friggin&#39; idiot if you haven&#39;t figured out where you are on this <br/>
list and who else is here and that MUCH pain and suffering is averted every <br/>
SINGLE DAY by people who have taken their children out of school and changed <br/>
from traditional parenting to some really pretty high-powered awareness <br/>
directly because of online discussions and online resources written by <br/>
volunteer unschooling parents.<br/>

<br/>
So when a not so popular member gets on someone&#39;s nerves, the &quot;good&quot; members<br/>
can whine for the moderator to make her stop or suggest to the offender they<br/>
might want to go elsewhere. When a &quot;good&quot; member gets on a not so popular<br/>
members nerves, that person is told to ignore the post and just delete.<br/>
<br/>
And when the unpopular members say something confusing, they are told not to<br/>
post unless their words are perfectly clear. You just justified a direct<br/>
insult as a slip. Talking for someone else too which also has been mentioned<br/>
here as something not to do in a not so nice way. You seem to have a problem<br/>
with &quot;unschooling guru&quot; enough to post about it but again, nothing on<br/>
&quot;friggin idiot.&quot;<br/>

To make it clear, NO, I didn&#39;t think &#39;friggin idiot&#39; was said in good taste. <br/>
  I didn&#39;t think &quot;great unschooling guru&quot; or &quot;happy fat and sassy&quot; was said <br/>
in good taste either.  They were all unneeded comments.  I&#39;m sure you think <br/>
what I&#39;m saying to you is unneeded too.  I was just saying that people screw <br/>
up sometimes, especially when in a heated arguement.  Call me rude, but put <br/>
your feathers down, I thought you were deleting my posts.?.  I can&#39;t make <br/>
everyone happy.  No one here can.  As someone just recently pointed out, <br/>
there are other people who feel the same way but just refrain from saying <br/>
so.  That goes for any conversation carried on at this list.  Some of &quot;us&quot; <br/>
are just more vocal than others.  I&#39;m not going keep my mouth shut if I see <br/>

I won&#39;t ask you to keep your mouth shut either, even when you irritate <br/>
someone else and even when you stick your foot in your own mouth.  If that <br/>
requires moderating, fine.  But *I* think the beauty of this list is that, <br/>
so far, no one has to &#39;watch&#39; their words and opinions to please a minute <br/>
amount of people.  Sure, the bickering gets old sometimes, but it&#39;s well <br/>
worth the eye opening information sometimes gleaned from the posts that <br/>
result.  I didn&#39;t get involved in the racism thread but I sure as hell <br/>
learned an awful lot just by listening.  Had there not been such bickering, <br/>
there wouldn&#39;t have been such thought provoking information shared.  Simple <br/>
as that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since the moderator has been mentioned here, I guess I should respond.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to defend calling someone a &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot;. But it&#39;s helpful<br/>
to see the dynamics that lead up to it.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few people on this list who devote hours a day to helping people<br/>
unschool. It&#39;s voluntary. No one makes us. We do it because we want to and<br/>
love to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Because of those hours many children&#39;s lives are more joyful and peaceful.<br/>
There are children in this world who are never going to be spanked again,<br/>
who will never be shamed for not doing their school work or keeping up with<br/>
their peers, who are growing up free from the burden of living their lives<br/>
to relieve false parental fears, because of the hours the volunteers put<br/>
into this list explaining unschooling and peaceful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
All because of the hours of a few people on this list.<br/>
<br/>
The work we do is akin to volunteering on a rape crisis line or family<br/>
counseling center. *Hours* each day. How many other people can say they too<br/>
are volunteering hours out of every day doing work that changes hurting<br/>
families for the better?<br/>
<br/>
How many people can say they do even an hour a *week*?<br/>
<br/>
No one is asking anyone to appreciate the hours involved but the volunteers<br/>
would appreciate not being treated as though what we do is nothing and no<br/>
big deal.<br/>
<br/>
So for someone to respond directly to one of those volunteers who probably<br/>
spends the most time with:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We can help one child at a time, one person at a time.  We can be loving<br/>
&gt; parents and give our children a wonderful upbringing and STILL have time to<br/>
&gt; help those who need help along the way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If only one child is spared the suffering the is oft times described in the<br/>
&gt; news media isn&#39;t it worth that one child&#39;s life to CARE?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We cannot sit in our peaceful little worlds and ignore the pain and suffering<br/>
&gt; happening right outside our doorsteps.  Nor do we have to turn our backs on<br/>
&gt; our children and families to make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how incredibly insulting is that?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s akin to some &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot; dismissing you with being &quot;just a<br/>
mother&quot;. It&#39;s akin to a husband saying to a stay at home mom &quot;Yeah, but you<br/>
don&#39;t do anything all day.&quot; She shouldn&#39;t call him a &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot;. It<br/>
won&#39;t help the situation. It will probably make it worse. But I&#39;d certainly<br/>
understand a wife who did.<br/>
