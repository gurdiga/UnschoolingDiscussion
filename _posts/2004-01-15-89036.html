<div id="ygrps-yiv-155736529">This is too funny.  I get some of you guys telling me I am not an <br/>
unschooler because of some stuff that my husband wants our son to do, <br/>
right, so you guys call me a relaxed homeschooler (even though I have <br/>
two kids who are totally unschooled at the moment...and we live our <br/>
lives like unschoolers...whatever goes) THEN, I get this from another <br/>
group of unschoolers with disabled kids:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been at this for well over a decade. Please don&#39;t call yourself <br/>
an<br/>
unschooler if you just sit and let your kid play video games. It <br/>
gives the<br/>
rest of us a bad name. Part of being a successful unschooler is to <br/>
have at<br/>
your child&#39;s disposal MANY, MANY things that he can do.....not just<br/>
technology related....and not *just* what he wants to stim on. <br/>
Sitting and<br/>
playing video games is &quot;NOTschooling&quot;....please do not label it as<br/>
unschooling....because it is not, no matter how much you want to <br/>
rationalize<br/>
or justify it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And this is because I am seen by the above mom as so unschooly as to <br/>
be a NOTschooler.  That&#39;s a new one.  Is there any possibility that <br/>
we could just be who we are (maybe even who we think we are...ever <br/>
heard of: act as if?) and then we could get past the part of how <br/>
authentic one is and just help each other?????<br/>
<br/>
I am laughing my butt off at how funny all of this is!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have stumbled on the difference between this list<br/>
and others, Rachel.  I made the same discovery after<br/>
being here for a while.  This list is a discussion<br/>
list, not a &quot;support&quot; list.  <br/>
<br/>
As the list guidelines say:<br/>
<br/>
2. Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this<br/>
as an opportunity to critically examine your own<br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to<br/>
discussing ideas, not the person with whom you are<br/>
disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t<br/>
want held up to public examination, don&#39;t post it to<br/>
the list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known you (cyberly, anyway) off and on for years,<br/>
and I know you really fit the bill of a radical<br/>
unschooler, in spite of your husband&#39;s efforts to<br/>
&quot;school&quot; your Andrew.<br/>
<br/>
I know how you have tried for all of Ben&#39;s 7 years to<br/>
help him, and have poured your heart and soul into<br/>
helping him.  I watched you struggle through all the<br/>
diet stuff.  I am glad you have found a way to help<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad you found a way to let Ben blossom where he<br/>
is safe and loved.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep reading here.  These wonderful people have really<br/>
helped me to see my kids individually as they are, and<br/>
I can look at *my* Andrew and think, &quot;You are Andrew. <br/>
You are unique and special and I thank God for you<br/>
just the way you are&quot; instead of seeing labels rolling<br/>
across his forehead like on a LCD screen<br/>
...CAPD...LD...Special Ed.... He&#39;s just Andrew now,<br/>
and that is cool.<br/>
<br/>
Soon Ben will just be Ben.  Print out Anne O.&#39;s<br/>
article and just let it be a balm to your heart, and<br/>
think of ways to celebrate his Ben-ness.  <br/>
<br/>
No one here is going to question your love and<br/>
devotion to your kids, but they will question your<br/>
choices if you post them here.  It isn&#39;t personal, but<br/>
that&#39;s what the list is for, to examine, pull apart,<br/>
re-define, clarify, and hopefully to help us grow.<br/>
<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<br/>
OMG!  How cool it is to figure out it is you!  How are you?  I have <br/>
missed you.  The vegman thing kept nawing at me, but I wasn&#39;t making <br/>
the connection. <br/>
<br/>
Much love to you and yours.  I know this isn&#39;t a support group. I <br/>
love that it is a discussion group.  Yeah, people can get a little <br/>
harsh.  The other group I mentioned is a support group and this woman <br/>
just blasted me and the posts I was sending weren&#39;t to her or about <br/>
her.<br/>
