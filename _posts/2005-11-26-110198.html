<div id="ygrps-yiv-183108932">As I was typing the paragraphs off the letter to my sister (which I only <br/>
saved on paper), I was thinking back to other people I might have reproduced with. <br/>
  Only one, of all the serious boyfriends back to the age of 14, was NOT the <br/>
child of an alcoholic parent.   One had both parents alcoholic (though the dad <br/>
had run a truck off the road or into a tree and died   before he was born).   <br/>
 Keith&#39;s parents aren&#39;t alcoholic.   My dad wasn&#39;t.   My kids are less at <br/>
risk than some.<br/>
<br/>
On Halloween all my kids went to a party--the same party.   Holly&#39;s nearly-15 <br/>
year old friend was here and she went too.   There was drinking, and I <br/>
learned in bits and pieces without really asking anyone to tell me everything, that <br/>
Marty and another mid-teen, Julie, were the only two not to drink at all.   <br/>
That left Holly and Jasmine in the &quot;drank some&quot; category.    Jasmine was staying <br/>
at our house for several days, and when her mom called I let her know.   I <br/>
knew the mom wouldn&#39;t be upset, but I did tell her I was going to bring it up <br/>
and talk to them a bit about it, and she said fine.<br/>
<br/>
So when we were out in the car on the way somewhere, so that it wasn&#39;t an <br/>
awkward &quot;We must talk about alcohol now,&quot; I said to Holly only (leaving Jasmine <br/>
out and not asking her) &quot;I heard you drank a little at the party.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
&quot;More than a little,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
I told her that I wanted to remind her that there seems to be a genetic <br/>
component, and that with only one alcoholic grandparent her risk was lower, she <br/>
still might inherit that alcoholism, and so she should be careful and aware <br/>
around alcohol.    <br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;Okay.   Thanks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jasmine said, &quot;Yes, thank you.   I hadn&#39;t heard that it might be genetic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know all of Jasmine&#39;s grandparents, and as far as I know only her maternal <br/>
grandmother is alcoholic.   I mentioned that.   I said &quot;Both you and Holly <br/>
have one maternal grandmother.&quot;    So that was a little bonding <br/>
second-and-a-half, and I still didn&#39;t ask Jasmine if she drank or how much.<br/>
<br/>
So because Holly said &quot;more than a little&quot; I was picturing the worst, but <br/>
still it didn&#39;t matter in the context of all of it.    <br/>
<br/>
A week or so later it came up again, with only me and Holly there, and I <br/>
asked if she had gotten drunk or sick, and she said no, neither, and in describing <br/>
what she tasted and drank, I don&#39;t think it was over three or four ounces.   <br/>
So her &quot;more than a little&quot; meant &quot;more than a sip&quot; but to me, growing up and <br/>
seeing people REALLY drink, I had imagined her to have been sloshed.<br/>
<br/>
And to the issue of people having trouble with older relatives changing <br/>
behaviors, it might be worth considering substances too.   If they&#39;ve just gone on <br/>
or off a drug is one possibility, but if they used to drink too much or abuse <br/>
something else, or if they&#39;ve just stopped smoking, those things are almost <br/>
guaranteed to make them mean. &lt;g&gt;   It takes a while to stabilize.<br/>
