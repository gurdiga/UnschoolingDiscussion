<div id="ygrps-yiv-944140716">When one is a public figure and uses that platform to pronounce as facts<br/>
opinions, particularly racist and bigotted remarks, then they place<br/>
themselves open to criticism.<br/>
<br/>
I already quoted what she said about gays, that is what the quote marks<br/>
around certain discriptive phrases were all about.  Those were direct<br/>
quotes, not my opinion about what she was saying.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t see how you could call that out of character for Laura, PhD.<br/>
 She is consistantly rude, judgemental and quite frequently sounds like a<br/>
screeching fishmongers wife.<br/>
<br/>
Further, I know several traditional Jews and none of them go around<br/>
pontificating or making judgemental pronouncements.<br/>
<br/>
Now, correct me if I am wrong (like I believe anyone wouldn&#39;t &lt;g&gt;), BUT, if<br/>
would seem to me that if on the one hand one believes that being homosexual<br/>
is a sin, one could not on the other hand support adoption by homosexual<br/>
couples.<br/>
<br/>
And, I don&#39;t see what difference it would make whether or not one heard the<br/>
whole tape, there is no justification for calling your children names and<br/>
certainly none for those type names, whole tape or no whole tape.<br/>

list and is more so now %-}<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, to be exact, I&#39;ve never called my kids worthless little mf&#39;ers.<br/>
&gt; That<br/>
&gt; &gt; is just one incident, there are many, many more that have been<br/>
 </span></blockquote>documented<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; but I didn&#39;t think I needed to write a book, I just included one of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; nastier moments that happened to get caught on tape.  And, if I had my<br/>
&gt; &gt; children at work, I certainly wouldn&#39;t berate them in front of all my<br/>
&gt; &gt; employees, either&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since I have never heard the tape, and probably never will, I won&#39;t say<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she never said that.  You do need to be careful about listening to patial<br/>
&gt; tape recordings, especially when produced by people who don&#39;t like the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>one<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;caught&quot; on tape.  I will say that the comment sounds highly out of<br/>
&gt; character for Dr. Laura.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not trying to jump to her defense here, I don&#39;t like all that she<br/>
 </span></blockquote>says<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or believes in either, but it sounds t me like some of you are tarring<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feathering her because you don&#39;t like her views.  What happened to &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; judgemental&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dr. Laura is an observant Jew, so it stands to reason that she would call<br/>
&gt; homosexuality a sin.  She believes in the Old Testament, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>homosexuality<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is called a sin there.  I have never heard her condemn homosexuals, just<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; behavior.  I have heard her support adoption rights for homosexual<br/>
 </span></blockquote>couples,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so I have difficulty believing that she hates all homosexuals.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of you have condemned her for &quot;not living what she preaches&quot; because<br/>
&gt; she is not at home with her son, and instead works.  Her son goes to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>school,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and she works during the hours he is in school only.  Her husband is a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>full<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; time parent for their son.  Why on earth would you condemn her for this?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; She&#39;s also a religous bigot.  Oh, and did I mention an expert on all<br/>
&gt; &gt; religions that she has never heard of.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have never heard her be a religious bigot.  She is open about her own<br/>
&gt; religious choice, and the journey that brought her there, but I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; heard her demean any other religion.  Have you?<br/>
