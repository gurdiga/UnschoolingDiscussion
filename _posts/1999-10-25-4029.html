<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641997503">Hi--<br/>
<br/>
I remember hearing about this study but I&#39;d never seen it.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting results (not surprising!:))--yet I remember people on a list I was on saying that the religious-affiliation demographics, among others, were skewed by the fact that Bob Jones University was involved.  Lots and lots of home/unschooling people I know said they would have opted out of such a study because they didn&#39;t want to be affiliated with that particular institution...<br/>
<br/>
Now if they had a non-religious organization collecting the data, the demographics might be quite different, and a picture of homeschoolers as more varied in their makeup might have emerged...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for passing it along--<br/>
Carolyn<br/>

It&#39;s a much different view of what this study is and does.<br/>

Hi--<br/>
<br/>

lots of home/unschooling people I know said they would have opted out of<br/>
such a study because they didn&#39;t want to be affiliated with that particular<br/>
institution...<br/>
