<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330334">&lt;&lt;for people to go to jobs to create more jobs to sell more shiny, noisy<br/>
crap that no one really needs&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But at some point, every capitalist economy much reach this stage.  The<br/>
driving force of capitalism is to create new markets to sell things to<br/>
create capital.  At some point, the &quot;needs&quot; of people who have the money to<br/>
pay are met and the economy then moves to luxury items....then to fancier<br/>
luxury items....then to faster luxury items....then to retro luxury<br/>
items....etc.  Which is why when the attacks of September 11 occurred and<br/>
people were shocked out of shopping for a hobby and into limiting buying to<br/>
what they needed, the economists about sh*t a brick.  The rallying cry was<br/>
&quot;go shopping to support the economy&quot;.  Gave me the willies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757192019">&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think anyone or anything can extend their immaturity&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While I normally agree with about 95% of what Sandra writes, I don&#39;t fully<br/>
agree with this statement.  My SIL works diligently to extend her children&#39;s<br/>
immaturity and has been fairly successful.  She controls their lives almost<br/>
completely, even as young teens, (including food, friends, media use, any<br/>
and all activities), and intervenes consistently so they rarely experience<br/>
positive or negative consequences when they do venture out into their own<br/>
lives. They have little responsibility and a tremendous amount of leisure<br/>
time and playthings.   Emotionally, they are about equal to my 8yo.  They<br/>
were both adopted from different birth families so genetics isn&#39;t a common<br/>
link.<br/>
