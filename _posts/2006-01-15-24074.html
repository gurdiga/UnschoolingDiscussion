<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157777252">&#39;Ren and some of the others here might remember their first time too.<br/>
&lt;g&gt; Any other stories?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that I remember the first time, my journey was slow...<br/>
but every time I respond calmly when I feel angry inside, is a victory<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
The best feeling is when Jalen is screaming and acting out in a very<br/>
angry way towards me, cussing, yelling so loud I feel like running out<br/>
the door and I can calmly pick him up and hug him. I feel like &quot;I WON!&quot;<br/>
Not won any battle with him, but the battle with myself...<br/>

less likely to be angry. To the point that one can completely change <br/>
forever the way they choose to respond to situations. Hard to explain, <br/>

really hard the first couple of times, because it gets easier and <br/>
easier until its second nature. Like developing a really good habit!<br/>

<br/>
That makes sense to me....I can actually feel that happening.<br/>
There are times the kids want to help me in the kitchen and I just<br/>
want to get something DONE quickly and without &quot;help&quot;.<br/>
I feel this thing rising up in me that is shouting for control of the<br/>
situation.<br/>
I actually have to say in my head &quot;shut up Ren, shut up Ren, shut up<br/>
Ren&quot; a few times. But then suddenly I&#39;m ok.<br/>
And each time it happens, it gets easier and easier to just let them<br/>
stir the broth and splash some out, or knead the dough and get it<br/>
stuck on the counter.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all stupid stuff, that does NOT matter if they get it messy or do<br/>
it &quot;wrong&quot;. But my mothers programming kicks in at the damndest times....<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW it&#39;s old tapes, because when they&#39;re happily working with art<br/>
stuff, or playdough and it&#39;s getting everywhere, it doesn&#39;t bug me a<br/>
bit. Something about that whole kitchen thing, a place my mother<br/>
wasn&#39;t very patient.  I remind myself that I am NOT my mother, thank<br/>
you...except when the nice parts of her show up.:)<br/>

So the phrase &quot;It gets easier with time&quot; has a basis in physiology. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Hard to explain, <br/>

<br/>
Not at all! Perfectly clear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I have a deep aversion to that movie, but the tool of making a  <br/>
better choice is the mainstay of the Peaceful Parenting tape so many  <br/>
people have gotten.<br/>
<br/>
The first time you start to do this, give yourself two choices,  <br/>
because if you don&#39;t consciously choose, you&#39;re not making a choice  <br/>
at all.  So you think... I could hit him or I could just yell.   And  <br/>
when you just yell,  you&#39;re a step closer to where you want to be.   <br/>
So the next time, improve your two choices.  I could yell, or I could  <br/>
just take a deep breath and say what I&#39;m angry about.<br/>
<br/>
Hitting wasn&#39;t even one of the choices anymore, so you&#39;re moving  <br/>
incrementally toward REALLY good choices.<br/>
<br/>
Next time... I could say what I&#39;m angry about, or I could try to find  <br/>
out why HE is doing what he&#39;s doing.<br/>
<br/>
Soon your two choices aren&#39;t even about you, they&#39;re about making  <br/>
other people more comfortable and making peace.  And once you  <br/>
experience how productive, warm, and relationship-strengthening that  <br/>
is, yelling or complaining about YOUR feelings wouldn&#39;t be anywhere  <br/>
near your two choices.<br/>
<br/>
So whereas at one time &quot;just&quot; saying &quot;that makes me angry because...&quot;  <br/>
seems like progress, you might get to the point that the melt-down  <br/>
situations haven&#39;t even happened, because in making choices in OTHER  <br/>
areas (and all the time) your kids aren&#39;t as hungry and tired as they  <br/>
used to be, their needs were attended to before there was something  <br/>
to hit or yell about, etc.<br/>
