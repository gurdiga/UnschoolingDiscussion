<br/>
Is this throwing a new angry response for him? Perhaps this is his way<br/>
of showing you that he sees his release from school as an opportunity<br/>
to fight for his freedom in other areas of his life. If that&#39;s the<br/>
case, he&#39;ll probably lessen the throwing as he adjusts and feels more<br/>
comfortable. Are you wanting him to help pick up because he threw<br/>
things around? I find that my daughter (3 yrs) will often help pick up<br/>
when she sees me picking up. I never tell her to pick up because I<br/>
recognize that I am the one with a need for neatness.<br/>

What is he angry about?  Are you really listening to his needs and finding<br/>
ways to say yes to him?  Do you treat him with respect?  Do you spend a lot<br/>
of time interacting with him on his level?  Do you play games with him and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780170819">Congratulations on taking that first big step!<br/>
You say he has special needs and has been in school for two years plus this first eight or so weeks of this school year. You don&#39;t say what is needs are, but are part of these needs communication based?  Do you need to work with him to find better ways for him to express himself? Is he frustrated from lack of words? <br/>
 <br/>
As for him helping pick up...  it starts at all different ages and maturity levels. My Jack is nine and helping out is hit and miss with him. But my little brother was the same way when he was little. He recently got married, but has been a bachelor for years and his housekeeping skills put mine to mortal shame. Moly OTOH, has been my helper from the get go. I remember having a spotless house in anticipation of a visit from my folks or Darin&#39;s mom, and within minutes of a grandparent sitting down Moly would have found all the microscopic dirt in the carpet and presented it to said grandparent with a self satisfied smile and a &#39;thear grandma&#39;. <br/>
 <br/>
But those cute stories don&#39;t help you. I suggest model behavior. Saying &#39;its time to pick up your room&#39; can be daunting to a child. Saying &#39;I&#39;m going to pick up those puzzle pieces in your room, will you please help?&#39;  gives them a bit more breathing room. It is one single task, you are going to help, a little less overwhelming. I used to grab three or four hula-hoops and throw them on the floor on top of a mess. Then everyone could grab a circle and just be responsible for that area, and a big, messy, Lego strewn, Barbie with her clothes and friends everywhere, room became less of a challenge and everyone was more or less equal in their responsibilities. <br/>
 <br/>
Also, do you need to evaluate your expectations on cleanliness, and helping out? Are they too high for a five year old? For a five year old with special needs? For a five year old who has been in a school setting for two years up until three weeks ago, who is still adjusting to a HUGE move in his life? <br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Deschooling doesn&#39;t require throwing things, but three weeks is a very short <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
My best idea is for you to help him not to get angry.<br/>
As he gets older he&#39;ll figure out better ways to express frustration, but in <br/>
the meantime, you could look at what it is that&#39;s making him angry enough to <br/>
throw things (meaning, probably, so full of adrenaline that his muscles need a <br/>
release) and figure out how to eliminate those frustrations.<br/>

My daughter is going to be 6 on Sunday. She has never been to school, and<br/>
has no special needs that I am aware of. She rarely helps pick up - although<br/>
there are other ways that she chooses to help - and will still sometimes<br/>
throw things in anger, although that has waned with maturity. Sometimes I<br/>
have feelings of powerlessness, most of the time I have strategies to help<br/>
her. <br/>
<br/>
The topics of helping little ones deal with anger, other ways of looking at<br/>
household tasks, strategies when there are time constraints, and balancing<br/>
apparently conflicting needs, get canvassed on AU a lot. <br/>

It is AMAZING how much difference it makes to change how we talk,  <br/>
even when the reasons aren&#39;t obvious and even when it feels  <br/>
artificial or stilted, at first. The words we use, the expressions we  <br/>
use, have a great influence over how we think - because we mostly do  <br/>
think in words. And how we think has a tremendous influence over how  <br/>
we behave - often in very very subtle ways that, unbeknownst to us,  <br/>
are easily read and acted upon by our children.<br/>

She had been with him tow other times but I usually stay at home so he can run in and out to me as he needs.   They may need more time together before I try to leave him alone with her.  When I asked about her, he seems to like her.  But I will keep an eye on it with that in mind.  Joanne<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485473963">Hi Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
He was in full day for two years (each year a different school) and then only six days of kindergarten.  He seemed interested to go to a new school and didn&#39;t want to make the decision for him.<br/>
<br/>
The special needs are PDD-NOS (autism spectrum) and ADHD.  He does have particular challenges with word retrieval at times.<br/>
<br/>
I really am not that fussy about neatness or even cleanliness per se.  Although I do find that I get nervous (anxious) myself with clutter or if many things are on the floor.  It feels a bit chaotic to me.  But than of course is my issue not his.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info about maturity levels and cleaning up.  That is also helpful.  I loved the focus that a hula hoop provides  :)<br/>

  I suggest model behavior. Saying &#39;its time to pick up your room&#39; can be daunting to a child.

Sometimes almost an apology or excuse for his behavior that didn&#39;t quite fit in with his peer group?

I will do my best to be aware of that and describe HIM, instead :)  A very poignant and healthy suggestion.  Joanne<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307098594">Hi Sara,<br/>
<br/>
How funny.  I just responded to someone else saying that it was my needs for neatness.  I actually get anxious if things become very cluttered or &quot;seemingly&quot; chaotic to me.  I know that is my issue and I am pretty quick to be able to trace it to an aspect of my growing up.<br/>
<br/>
I love your idea that he may be needing to exercise his freedom.  I need to make sure I am allowing it without judgment.  I regret that when I am particular tired I get inpatient with his &quot;making a mess that I now feel I need to clean up&quot;  (which I know I am choosing to clean up).<br/>
<br/>
It ahs worsened since he has left school.  I am feeling so much support and encouragement, I think I am just going to try to give him the gift of not dumping my feelings on him after he throws things around (rips papers, knocks things off the desk, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he just needs some more attention.  Perhaps I am too distracted?  He is the only child and likes me to play with him all the time.  Most of the time it is enjoyable and at times I need a break from crashing cars or having bad guys fight with bullets.  He can get very frustrated with me when I want to stop :(<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Joanne<br/>
  to fight for his freedom in other areas of his life. <br/>
