<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 14 year old likes to play GTA (among other gory games) a lot.  ...and do <br/>
you know that just today he was telling me that he was concerned he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a good driver when it came his turn to be 16.  It turns out <br/>
he&#39;s concerned about possibly doing something wrong and hurting someone&#39;s <br/>
car.  Well, that and getting lost all the time because at this moment in <br/>
his life, he pays NO attention to street names (and no reason he should, <br/>
really.)  He&#39;s been reassured on both parts, but I thought it was rather <br/>
timely, what with all the &#39;oooh, it&#39;s gory! what do I do?&#39; talk.  Maybe you <br/>
should buy him another gory game!  (grin)<br/>

(as an aside, his playing Age of Empires (if that&#39;s the one with the <br/>
chinese history scenes and lots of gory swordplay chopping off heads, etc?) <br/>
has led to his saving up to buy a decent set of rather asian-looking swords <br/>
for his wall (for swishing around in the safety of his room, polishing in <br/>
the front room, etc.) AND become even more interested in knife and sword <br/>
making.  Now if I can only get a smithy together...)<br/>

I worried about that with Kirby.  He never knew which direction our house <br/>
was.  If someone started giving him directions across town, he would visibly <br/>
blank out.  He was afraid to ride the bus because he would have gotten lost (and <br/>
he would have, so I didn&#39;t press it).  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Marty and Holly were great at giving people directions to our <br/>
house, at finding their way around, they HAD ridden the bus some, without loss of <br/>
spot-on-planet, they could pretty well point in the direction of other <br/>
people&#39;s houses or the zoo or the mall.  Kirby lived in a little tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
But I am kind of that way too.  It took me YEARS to learn Albuquerque <br/>
(starting as a pedestrian made it worse for me).<br/>
<br/>
So I was quite impressed and relieved when Kirby started driving and he DID <br/>
know his way around.  When he needed to learn it he did.  And he knows back <br/>
ways, and alternate routes, and never seems worried or flustered.<br/>
<br/>
When he needed to learn it he did.  Why did that surprise me?   &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
