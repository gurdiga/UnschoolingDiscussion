&gt; The ocean side has bigger<br/>

&gt; is warmest in September. Warm, of course, being a relative term.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you love books, New England Mobile Book Fair in Natick. (Go directly to<br/>
&gt; the remainder room.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You thought of more than I could! <br/>
<br/>
I second these suggestions above, they are some of my favorites!  I like <br/>
Sturbridge better than Plymoth Plantation.  <br/>
<br/>
If you go to the Cape, you could go to Woods Hole (near Falmouth) <br/>
Oceanographic Museum and Aquarium.  The Aquarium is free and has a hands-on <br/>
section for picking up crabs etc. and looking at them under microscopes.  <br/>
They also feed the seals 2x a day there.  There is also a nice garden <br/>
overlooking the water a few blocks from the aquarium with a Bell Tower (part <br/>
of Catholic church across the street) and a small wooden playground up the <br/>
street.   Email me if you want more info.  <br/>
<br/>
If you go to Hyannis, the Cape Cod Potato Chip Factory there had a <br/>
self-guided tour and a free bag of chips.  My kids really liked it!<br/>
<br/>
The book store above is awesome!  I love the remainder rooms (books marked <br/>
down)!  And the rest of the store is about 20% off retail.    <br/>
<br/>
Someone else mentioned Curious George Goes To Wordsworth bookstore in Harvard <br/>
Square, Cambridge.  A wonderful store and you could go to the Mount Auburn <br/>
Cemetery in Cambrige too.  Lots of beautiful trees, headstones, famous people <br/>
buried there (self-guided tour info too).   There is a tower with a great <br/>
view too.   If you go there, just a mile or so down the street is East <br/>
Watertown and lots of little Armenian and Greek shops/bakeries.  Yum!  Massis <br/>
Bakery, Sepal&#39;s Restaurant, and others.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, <br/>

instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>
of freedom.&quot;<br/>
