<br/>
Hi.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to disgust you.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the intro to this list says people should try to read for a couple of <br/>
weeks before they post, so if you judged it by one day and decided it was <br/>
okay to jump on me, you might want to wait another couple of weeks before you <br/>
jump on anyone again.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I mean WHY can&#39;t she stand up <br/>
for herself? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can, and I quite often do.<br/>
But way more often than that, I stand up for kids when their parents are <br/>
putting them down unfairly for something the parent could probably learn to <br/>
head off and avoid with much less effort than they&#39;re putting into <br/>
badmouthing their children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Talk about unschooling, I feel like this is certainly child led.!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Child led&quot; is often a term used by people who want to disparage unschooling. <br/>
 It&#39;s not a term I personally use.   I live with my chidren closely, and no <br/>
one person is leading.  We arrange to let everyone in the family get lots of <br/>
opportunity to choose activities and set schedules and it&#39;s working pretty <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Led by a child named Sandra. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi.<br/>
I&#39;m forty nine.  If you&#39;d like to read more, here:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/bio">http://sandradodd.com/bio</a><br/>
<br/>
If you would NOT like to know more, that&#39;s fine.  But you came on pretty <br/>
testy for someone who knows nothing about me, so consider finding out who <br/>
you&#39;ve blasted.  And consider considering why you did that, if you had no <br/>
idea who I was.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If Sandra isn&#39;t  speaking because she doesn&#39;t care then why should <br/>
these groupies care?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I wasn&#39;t speaking it wasn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t care.<br/>
&quot;Groupies&quot; has never been a nice word, and in the case of the women you&#39;re <br/>
talking about, it&#39;s a pretty grave insult.  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the group.  Read for a couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Thats why America is so wonderful, we all have a right <br/>
to our opinions and our delete key! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are people on this list from many different countries, not just &quot;Amer<br/>
ica.&quot;<br/>
Is your delete key broken?<br/>
Because it&#39;s one thing to be insulted by someone who&#39;s been here a while, but <br/>
an attack like yours after you&#39;ve been here since yesterday is pretty extreme.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I came to this list because of a fellow <br/>
listmate&#39;s recommendation to learn about &#39;living to learn&#39;. Lets get back to <br/>
that!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only time I&#39;ve missed posting somewhere about unschooling is when I&#39;m at <br/>
a conference speaking about unschooling.  Let&#39;s get back to that.<br/>
<br/>
So, Moe--<br/>
How long have you been unschooling?  How old are your kids?<br/>

&lt;&lt; If you are a newcomer then you have no right writing what you just did.  <br/>
They don&#39;t ask you to read for at least two weeks before posting for nothing; <br/>
you have no idea what you are talking about.  Sandra is an inspiration for a <br/>
lot of us and an experienced unschooler with a lot to offer. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Manon.<br/>
I think maybe the person was just a hit&#39;n&#39;run poster.  I appreciate the <br/>
defense, though.<br/>
