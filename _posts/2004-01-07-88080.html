<div id="ygrps-yiv-693390345">**I read a little bit about unschooling, but am still unsure about how<br/>
and if it really works.**<br/>
<br/>
Well, one point, which is pretty easy to grasp, is that learning can <br/>
take place in your home or community *even if* there are no worksheets <br/>
produced to turn in to the school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how much the school funding system is different in Canada <br/>
from what I&#39;m used to in the U.S., but here the independent study system <br/>
is (foolishly?) built around the idea that it&#39;s important to have flat <br/>
samples to submit to the school for their files.<br/>

PS  Going to the archives for this Yahoo group and reading some of the <br/>
threads with interesting titles is another way to accelerate your <br/>
understanding of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
PPS  Can anyone remind me how the list of &quot;unschooling is...&quot; phrases <br/>
was generated by Google?  Is all you need to do to put the phrase <br/>
&quot;unschooling is&quot; in the search field?  Or is there some other button you <br/>
have to click?  Thanks.</div>
