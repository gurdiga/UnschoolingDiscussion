<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573504863"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ok, I&#39;ll take you up on it.  Thanks.  The only stuff I know about is the<br/>
&gt; Bach Suites.  I like baroque, classic, romantic, most anything but the<br/>
&gt; really weird modern stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, anybody who really doesn&#39;t care about cello music should definitely skip<br/>
this post!  But we seem to have so many cellists around here that I just<br/>
replied to Tia on the list.  My apologies to the bored and the unmusical,<br/>
and my condolences to those who play the &quot;wrong&quot; instrument!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
The Bach suites are sort of the pinacle of unaccompanied music, but there<br/>
are several Baroque pieces that are more easily playable than them.  Try:<br/>
<br/>
Joseph Bodin de Boismortier (nice name, huh?!), Acht Kleine Stucke, op. 40<br/>
these are for cello with optional accomp; they&#39;re very nice alone.<br/>
<br/>
Domenico Gabrielli, 7 Ricercari<br/>
I like #6 and 7 the best, and #1 and 2 are very blah, by warning.<br/>
<br/>
Georg Philipp Telemann, Fantasia for Cello Solo, transcribed by Valter<br/>
Despalj.  <br/>
<br/>
The Romantic folk preferred larger groups, so only not much for cello alone.<br/>
There&#39;s a piece by Klengel, Caprice Op. 43, which is deadly hard, and Max<br/>
Reger wrote 3 suites for solo cello.  If you know the Bach, you&#39;ll realize<br/>
that Reger did, too.  His 1st suite is based on Bach&#39;s 1st.  (There are nice<br/>
things in the Reger, but the man wrote mountains of music, and didn&#39;t seem<br/>
to know how to stop when he ran out of good ideas.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a LOT of contemporary music, including things by Bloch, Britten,<br/>
Crumb, Hindemith, etc. that are pretty tough.  However, try:<br/>
<br/>
Dmitri Kabalevsky, 5 Studies in Major and Minor.  These are really nice,<br/>
tonal (back and forth from major to minor -- a nice effect), and readable!<br/>
<br/>
Peter Schickele wrote a serious piece for unaccompanied cello called<br/>
Vermillion Suite, which is great.  He also wrote 2 P.D.Q. Bach &quot;Suites for<br/>
Cello All By Its Lonesome&quot;.  Both are hilarious; I like #2 better.<br/>
<br/>
Robert Muczynski, Gallery Suite, is based on paintings by the American<br/>
artist, Charles Birchfield.  Very pretty and approachable but still with<br/>
some modern harmonies.<br/>
<br/>
Michael Horvit, Lydian Suite (published by Southern Music Co.)  He&#39;s still<br/>
alive and composing in Texas; he&#39;s Jewish and his music sounds Jewish.  This<br/>
is my favorite of everything listed here, and well worth the effort to<br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
Rudolf Matz, Suite &quot;Lights and Shadows&quot;, Suite in C major, Tema con<br/>
Variazioni.  They&#39;re all nice, but not great, inspiring stuff.  Very<br/>
playable, and tuneful.  I use it for teaching; it&#39;s about Suzuki book 4<br/>
level, if that helps.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, if you like a little more variety in your music, try:<br/>
<br/>
David Eby&#39;s Celtic Passage for Solo Cello.<br/>
Sean Grissom, Liberty (Fiddling for cello) or Cherry Blossom (Sakura,<br/>
Sakura)<br/>
or<br/>
Benjamin Boone&#39;s Buffing the Gut (A Jazz Etude for Solo Cello).  This one is<br/>
fabulous, but technically killer.<br/>
<br/>
I buy music from Shar (1-800-248-SHAR) or Brodt (1-800-438-4129).  Hope that<br/>
helps; let me know if you can&#39;t find something and need a publsher or other<br/>
info.  <br/>
<br/>
brenda<br/>
p.s.  There&#39;s some tenor clef in this bunch; you won&#39;t learn it without<br/>
playing it, so I didn&#39;t pull it all out.  None of these run into the<br/>
stratosphere, so not much treble clef.</div>

Ask your friends, family, etc.  Tell them you&#39;re looking for instruments.<br/>
Do you know how many people I know who have a cello (violin, guitar, flute,<br/>
etc.) lying around their house collecting dust?!?  It&#39;s really pitiful.<br/>
Maybe someone would loan theirs to you.  You might have to invest in a new<br/>
set of strings, but those are cheap enough (unless you&#39;re like me and<br/>
terribly picky about them...!).  Just start telling people you&#39;re looking to<br/>
borrow one.  Perfectly sane, normal-looking people have these old instrument<br/>
skeletons in their closet.....<br/>
<br/>
Hey, it&#39;s worth a try!<br/>

My mom just went to her 50th class reunion and was asking me if I&#39;d heard of PDQ,  and I&#39;m like &quot;Yeeaahhh!?!&quot;  and she goes on to tell me that he graduated with her (from Fargo High School)she&#39;s known him for all these years!  Cool!    <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think she knows how well-known he is,  she said he&#39;s a pretty funny guy,  anything creative is funny to my mom.<br/>

Just my 2 cents on PDQ Bach,  I&#39;m trying to remember his given name but can&#39;t come up with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787507422">Kim,  <br/>
Have you asked around about full sized cellos laying around?<br/>
 <br/>
I wanted to learn and my son was taking,  and here in the closet at the music school was a full size that noone was using.  I asked about it and it turned out to be owned by a musician who was travelling alot and I used it free for a year.   <br/>
 <br/>
I did end up giving it back last month because the teacher thought I should buy it and I didn&#39;t know if it was worth the 300 or 500 they were asking.  Mistake on my part I wish I would have just bought it.  I&#39;m looking for another.  <br/>
 <br/>
I play violin , and cello was pretty easy to pick up once I got used to thinking backwards, with fingering and everything,    the one great thing about me playing was that my ds then would play and play,  now since I&#39;ve given back the full size he has hardly played,  &lt;sad&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have not even attempted the Tenor clef,  what&#39;s that?&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I also want to learn fiddling(sp?) techniques,  I&#39;ve never done that.<br/>
 <br/>
Kelli,  also, &quot;so many instruments and music, so little time&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; Walmart has a whole guitar set up right now. It is $99 and includes <br/>
guitar, <br/>

 strap? It&#39;s a deal! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t have good tuners. As soon as you tune it, it slips back out of <br/>
tune. And I think hearing the correct notes are important.<br/>
I would invest a little bit more to make sure you have a decent instrument if <br/>
the child is truly interested.<br/>
Or buy used!!<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have not even attempted the Tenor clef,  what&#39;s that?&lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, ok, let me try this without a piece of manuscript paper in front of me.<br/>
<br/>
So, imagine some blank piano music.  You know the C that&#39;s middle c?  It<br/>
hangs 1 ledger line below the treble clef staff.  Ok, good.<br/>
<br/>
Now imagine the bass clef staff.  That same C (middle c) sits one ledger<br/>
line above the bass clef staff.  (That&#39;s why it&#39;s called middle c, by the<br/>
way.  It&#39;s in the middle.  Duh, of course, but I was halfway through a music<br/>
degree before that stupid fact occured to me!)<br/>
<br/>
Now, since that c could actually be written on a proper line if you just<br/>
stuck an extra one in there between the treble and bass clefs, go ahead and<br/>
mentally draw one in.<br/>
<br/>
That C line that you just drew with your mind is the second from the top<br/>
line of the 5 in Tenor clef.  (If you did this right, it&#39;s in the place<br/>
where you would normally find F in bass clef.)  The symbol for tenor clef is<br/>
either a K or a B, with the center of the letter aligned on the 2nd line<br/>
from the top.  (Violas play in alto clef, and their K or B is on the center<br/>
line, since that&#39;s where middle c is in alto clef.)<br/>
<br/>
The lines in tenor clef, from top to bottom are DFACE.  It&#39;s a clef used to<br/>
write music for cello and trombone when bass clef is too low.  Rather than<br/>
jumping right into treble clef and having to move back and forth between<br/>
treble and bass clefs when the music went higher or lower, we use tenor<br/>
clef; it&#39;s right in the range you need for 3rd position on the A string<br/>
through about 7th position.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that&#39;s about as clear as mud, but there you are.<br/>
