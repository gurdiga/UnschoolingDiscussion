<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111001447">Hi, I need some ideas on an issue I&#39;m having with my son please.  we <br/>
are new to unschooling, and particularly radical unschooling, and so <br/>
far things are really cool but I&#39;m having a hard time in this one <br/>
area.  My son is 6 yo and the oldest (and first grandchild on my <br/>
side) and we have always given him most of the things he has wanted <br/>
but recently, we have had to really start budgeting our money.  So, <br/>
although I&#39;ve been trying to say &quot;yes&quot; to him (including things <br/>
like &quot;how about putting that on your christmas list, how about <br/>
putting that on your bday list, let&#39;s look at getting that next week <br/>
when we don&#39;t have to get this other thing for you today, or since we <br/>
just got this wii game ($65) we&#39;ll try for it another week...etc) <br/>
he&#39;s is just not satisfied with this unless he gets something THAT <br/>
day.  <br/>
<br/>
It is not like he used to get things every day (when I wasn&#39;t on a <br/>
stricter budget) but lately it seems that he is asking for things <br/>
everyday that he just must have or he begins crying and whining.  <br/>
It&#39;s not like he would get things everyday before and I have just <br/>
briefly discussed our trimming down of the budget (although I do say <br/>
that with me not working there is less money in the house) but this <br/>
really seems to be a new behavior.  <br/>
<br/>
I did read some of the posts on spoiling and agree that giving kids <br/>
what they want doesn&#39;t spoil them so I&#39;m not really worried about <br/>
that, it&#39;s that I&#39;m wondering what he is needing from me or his life <br/>
that he keeps needing things.  I guess as I write this, I&#39;m thinking <br/>
that I really need to be stimulating his interests to a greater <br/>
degree.  Although, with a budget which is dwindling daily :( I find <br/>
less resources to get him or take him to interesting places. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to squelch his desires and his wants but with a limited <br/>
budget I really feel strapped but find it hard to say no.  For <br/>
example, this morning he asked for a book...fine, I love buying him <br/>
books...but we just bought him something yesterday so I suggested <br/>
that we get the book from the library...he started crying and whining <br/>
that he wanted a NEW book that he hasn&#39;t read before.  We just went <br/>
to the library yesterday and have lots of unread books around the <br/>
house. Obviously he is needing something and not getting it!  Any <br/>
advice, suggestions, insights are greatly appreciated!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Used book stores!  Trade in the old ones for credit, maybe.  Maybe  <br/>
look on Amazon for used books if he knows what he wants, but used  <br/>
bookstores for browsing, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Garage sales and thrift stores for other stuff?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you think he&#39;s unaware of the amount of stuff he would add to the  <br/>
house if he got a new thing every day, maybe you could make a pile of  <br/>
seven things and a pile of thirty things and talk about a week&#39;s  <br/>
worth and a month&#39;s worth.  If you do it in a fun way and not a  <br/>
shaming way it might be entertaining and helpful (depending on how  <br/>
it&#39;s presented and how he&#39;s feeling about it all).<br/>
<br/>
Would it help to combine toys?  Marty used to have a lot of fun with  <br/>
homemade playdough and Lego men.  He could make hills and caves and  <br/>
stuff.  If they get playdough up in their legs, it can be soaked out  <br/>
or picked out with a toothpick later (or left in to crumble out  <br/>
eventually).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could think of fun combinations of toys and wrap things  <br/>
like gifts--things he already has, but two things he hasn&#39;t played  <br/>
with together, in a box, to be opened like a gift when he&#39;s bored.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935749732">Natalie,<br/>
 We are a single income family of 5 and there is less money each year as my<br/>
company has tightened its belt and consumer prices of just about everything<br/>
have been going up. We have found it pretty successful with my two oldest<br/>
kids (6 and 7 years) to share more details about the budget of our household<br/>
and what various things cost that we buy and pay for. I once told my<br/>
daughter that a gallon of gas was more than $4 and she said, &quot;That doesn&#39;t<br/>
sound like a lot&quot;. Later, she asked how often I had to buy &quot;one&quot;. I told her<br/>
that our car took 15 gallons to fill up and we went there once per week (at<br/>
least) and she started to do the math.<br/>
<br/>
  To enable them to buy the things they want and to make decisions about how<br/>
the household money should be spent, we give them what my in-laws consider<br/>
an obscene amount of money &quot;allowance&quot; each week to use however they like.<br/>
They quite often buy things that I consider junk or that I predict they will<br/>
be disappointed with but we really try to give them tools to make their own<br/>
evaluation. They have found lots of fun and excitement in toys that we never<br/>
would have thought to buy for them. They have also been disappointed at<br/>
times. My daughter (8) has become the most frugal person I know and has over<br/>
$800 in her savings account. My son prefers to try out lots of things with<br/>
no regrets and rarely has 2 dimes to rub together. Either way, they rarely<br/>
ask us to buy something for them but sometimes lament that something is &quot;too<br/>
expensive&quot; or &quot;not worth the cost&quot;. Sometimes I get extra money from work as<br/>
a bonus and I give a portion of it to each of the kids. My daughter got $80<br/>
extra last month and she put it all in the bank. My son bought a Nintendo DS<br/>
and some Pokemon cards.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe if you share with your son about all of the expenses and how much<br/>
money there is to work with each month, he will want to work with you to<br/>
make the most of your purchasing power and even help to save money in other<br/>
areas. Our kids will sometimes notice when there is money to be saved and<br/>
say &quot;why don&#39;t we go to Costco on the way back from the library later<br/>
instead of going out twice?&quot;.  I&#39;m still hoping my kids will get excited<br/>
about turning off the lights when they are not in the room, but I&#39;m also<br/>
considering timer switches since it&#39;s essentially my issue at this point.<br/>
<br/>
  At first, we didn&#39;t tell them about all of the housing and car expenses,<br/>
just how much there was to work with after the household was paid for. Now<br/>
we found that they really can help more with more information. For example,<br/>
we told them we had $300 for new clothes this fall. We try to shop when all<br/>
of the &quot;back to school&quot; sales are on. They were able to pick out way more<br/>
than we had hoped and passed by everything that I predict many of the kids<br/>
are asking for these days. They notice that you pay more for brands, and<br/>
sometime they choose to pay more. Sometimes they don&#39;t but it&#39;s there call.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t believe that our budget is an arbitrary limit, but there are some<br/>
gotchas in there. If we are saving for retirement, or saving for a trip, or<br/>
saving for their college, or for medical emergencies, we consider those<br/>
essential where they may not. This has got them to thinking about their own<br/>
long term goals and saving their own money.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s also an ages and stages thing.  Something that really<br/>
helped both my girls when they went through this process, was giving<br/>
them a generous allowance, once a month was too infrequent, and every<br/>
week was too much money, so we started with every other week.  If you<br/>
are making a budget, show your son and put him into it.  Budget him in<br/>
like you would a pressing bill with high interest and a huge late fee. <br/>
Kids are only kids for a short time, and this particular age/stage thing<br/>
does go quickly, or at least it did for my oldest daughter.  It&#39;s less<br/>
money than a car payment and probably will take less time, and by the<br/>
time you are a year or two down the road, you&#39;ll be in a different<br/>
financial situation, and that money may seem like a tiny amount in<br/>
retrospect.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter, she&#39;s 7, and it started about a year ago, is still<br/>
in this process, so I totally get where you are at.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that&#39;s really helped me not be irritated with whining, is<br/>
this;  Our daughter clearly has a strong faith in our ability to provide<br/>
for her and meet her needs/wants.  That alone is awesome!  Some kids are<br/>
afraid to even ask their parents for things!  If you are continually<br/>
trying to provide the things your child wants, and they know that<br/>
without a doubt, then, in the times when you can&#39;t, it&#39;s so much easier<br/>
to be sympathetic to their feelings of being let down when their hopes<br/>
aren&#39;t realized right away.</div>

always little toys about and it makes it hard to vaccuum.  I kept my<br/>
thoughts to myself mostly.  At one point I walked into the living room<br/>
and let out a little cry and said, &quot;I feel sooo overwhelmed by so many<br/>
things all over&quot;.  It was a way to make it lighter for me.<br/>
<br/>
We had a guest over and he said, &quot;why don&#39;t you make her clean up&quot;<br/>
refering to my younger daughter that pulls all that stuff out.  I said<br/>
&quot;One day, when all my kids are gone, my house will be clean and I may<br/>
feel lonely and longing for toys all over the place again.  Lots of toys<br/>
out, means busy minds and happy kids.  I must keep reminding myself of<br/>
this!&quot;.  He said &quot;Are you sure?&quot;, and without a doubt I was!<br/>
<br/>
I will remember the barbie parties that take up the entire living room<br/>
and without a doubt they will be fond memories!</div>
