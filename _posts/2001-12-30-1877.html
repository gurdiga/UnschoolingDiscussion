&gt; &gt;&gt; What Monty Python sketches are specifically Yorkshire besides<br/>
&gt; &quot;Every<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sperm is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sacred&quot;?  If we had our friend Helena here who&#39;s lived in and<br/>
&gt; around<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; York for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the past two years, she could coach him, but she&#39;s in London,<br/>
&gt; probably<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; losing her edge.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a bit early in the morning for me to think too seriously but...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; what about the one with the old men who had it tough? You know,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Well,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we reeeeally had it tough. We lived in paper bag in middle o&#39;road,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; every mornin we had to get up an lick road clean...&quot; Those accents<br/>
&gt; must<br/>
&gt; &gt; be from up north somewhere? So maybe Yorkshire?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you have any &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; tapes, or for that<br/>
&gt; matter,<br/>
&gt; the dialect written out in the books?  And for MP sketches, what about<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; one where Graham Chapman lives, looks and talks like a miner, but is<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; a famous playwright, and Eric Idle is his son who *is* a miner, but<br/>
&gt; dresses<br/>
&gt; and talks like a banker?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just grabbed &quot;All Things Wise and Wonderful&quot; off the shelf, and<br/>
&gt; opened it<br/>
&gt; randomly; chapter 23 features a guy who yells all the time, so the<br/>
&gt; caps<br/>
&gt; attracted my attention.  Some of his lines:<br/>
&gt; Aye, a good bacon pig.  Gone right off.  It hasn&#39;t ate nowt for two<br/>
&gt; days.<br/>
&gt; He were right as ninepence on Monday night...<br/>
&gt; Nay, ah don&#39;t like that much!  Ah allus like to &#39;ave a go.  Isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; summat we can do?  Where there&#39;s life there&#39;s &#39;ope, tha knaws.<br/>
&gt; Finished up as dog meat, poor bugger!<br/>
