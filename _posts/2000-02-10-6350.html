<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947970873">No, I don&#39;t think so.  It actually started with the hippies back in the<br/>
60&#39;s (o.k., I admit it, I&#39;m old as dirt and know this first hand &lt;g&gt;) and<br/>
then went underground.  I think that it nicely adapts to the Wiccan/Pagen<br/>
way of looking at the world.  However, I&#39;ve got tons of cyber-friends that<br/>
are Christians and various and sundry other beliefs that are unschooling. <br/>
Now, a lot of Christians are having a rougher time of it because of the way<br/>
their fellow travelers think but, I would say unschooling is pretty well<br/>
non-denominational &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Nope!  You just caught a thread.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting thread too.<br/>
<br/>
But a lot of us are other than pagan (how&#39;s that for vague??).<br/>

P.S.  New thread??  My husband and I are talking about him working less and I <br/>
really feel it would be great (long overdue) and I also think the whole <br/>
hsing/unschooling going on at home is part of that &quot;simplifying my life&quot; <br/>
attitude which I seem to be creeping up on.  Everybody else already BTDT??</div>

pagan as there are people who call themselves pagan.  I would say that<br/>
pagan unschooling is definately more nature centered and involving<br/>
spirituality and other elements of internal growth as much as other areas<br/>

certain way of Unschooling that is common among pagan families, not whether<br/>
Unschooling is a particularly pagan type of Homeschooling itself.  No I<br/>
don&#39;t believe it is.  I also don&#39;t think there are a lot of pagan families<br/>
on this list.  There are maybe half a dozen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree and I think it is wonderful.  One of the things I love about it<br/>
(Unschooling) is it&#39;s capacity for bringing together families with diverse<br/>
beliefs who have Unschooling in common (which is a BIG part of their<br/>
lifestyle to have in common) so they are able to share Unschooling<br/>
experiences and share their diversity with each other at the same time.<br/>
