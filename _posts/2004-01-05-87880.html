<div id="ygrps-yiv-922682653">Sometimes. Sometimes the newbie unschooler might wander in here and gets some <br/>
reassurance that what she is doing is OK -- from all those experts who got to <br/>
be experts by doing. <br/>
<br/>
Or they make their way to enough different places to be able to compare and <br/>
decide what is best for them and -- ta da -- some of the different places have <br/>
experts who are titled, degreed, published, etc., or none of the above.<br/>
<br/>
Giving parents the confidence to sort things out is fantastic imo. Dismissing <br/>
any possible source of info simply because it is from an acknowledged expert <br/>
is not helping parents though. Degreed or not, unschoolish or not, they may <br/>
have something helpful to say. Which, put together with other info, might help a <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
If we let our personal experiences (my son was not happy in ps, for instance) <br/>
color our reactions and cause a knee-jerk reaction every time a certain <br/>
flavor of expert is available, we miss out on a lot.  It&#39;s easy to do, but not <br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents -- why not take it all in, evaluate it with confidence, realize <br/>
the expert is right or wrong for you, and learn something.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s email brought this whole series of posts on another list from a Mom <br/>
concerned about her parenting style. She is, for one thing, protective of her <br/>
son being outside alone. Now, it does her no good for me or some expert to <br/>
decree that she should or should not allow her son to be outside alone. What she <br/>
found helpful was the range of responses she received -- she seemed to be <br/>
genuinely helped by hearing a lot of different takes on how other parents handle <br/>
things. None of the positions was dismissed as being from an expert -- or not -- <br/>
and therefore worthy. Now, and as she goes along, she can carve her own <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, we may individually decide never to listen to an expert with a degree. <br/>
That may suit us for various reasons. We may decide that anything that isn&#39;t <br/>
completely counterculture is necessarily wrong -- and avoid anything from a <br/>
mainstream pov. Or we may come to a list like this and only want to hear <br/>
affirmations that we are allowed to ignore experts. Poof -- you are given permission <br/>
by a list to do what you want to do. <br/>
<br/>
Over-reliance on experts, lack of confidence, damaging conformity -- all bad <br/>
things, all things to watch out for. If some of us choose to read the whole <br/>
body of information available though -- I don&#39;t see the problem with that. <br/>
Limiting each other as we try to figure things out doesn&#39;t seem helpful to me.<br/>
<br/>
Guess that&#39;s more than 2 cents. :)<br/>

Subject: Reliance on Experts (Was - Re: The lovely Jane Jacobs)<br/>
<br/>
We live in an era in which parents hardly trust themselves at all - <br/>
don&#39;t rely on their own good sense, their own experience, their love <br/>
for their own children, their own traditions, their own values, the <br/>
gentle examples of more experienced friends and relatives, but instead <br/>
are &quot;parenting advice&quot; junkies, spending millions of dollars on <br/>
parenting classes, books, magazines, counselors, etc, looking to <br/>
experts to help them make every possible decision. Over-reliance on <br/>
experts makes parents feel they are never doing enough, never making <br/>
good enough decisions. Parents are persuaded by first one expert and <br/>
then another. Their approach to parenting does not come from deeply <br/>
held personal beliefs about what it means to care for and rear a new <br/>
human being - instead they try out the newest parenting fads, often one <br/>
after another, with increasing desperation when they don&#39;t &quot;work&quot; (kids <br/>
are still kids with their own individual strengths and weaknesses) and <br/>
they feel like failures when they don&#39;t feel the deep satisfaction that <br/>
the experts tell them parenting ought to bring them. Relying on experts <br/>
makes parents fearful and anxious about doing the wrong thing since <br/>
they are &quot;not experts&quot; themselves. It drains the confidence from <br/>
parents and the joy from family life.<br/>

I&#39;ve been thinking about this thread off and on today while doing the <br/>
laundry, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think a flaw with some types of social sciences is that individuals <br/>
are transformed into numbers and aggregated together.  From that <br/>
accumulation of data, conclusions are drawn and then applied back to <br/>
people in general.  Particularly in education we see experts (sometimes) <br/>
applying rules that might be true in general (in the institutional <br/>
setting) but that can be far from suitable in an individual case.  For <br/>
example, the &quot;best&quot; technique for encouraging reading in a generic 8 <br/>
year old might not be best for Esmerelda.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much variation in human personality, taste and manner of <br/>
thinking that a one-sized-fits-all answer from an expert is not often <br/>
the best answer for a given individual.  So a mother or father&#39;s <br/>
expertise in knowing their child could be much more important than a <br/>
researcher&#39;s expertise in knowing &quot;the field&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

PS  Professional expertise is often filtered through journalists before <br/>
it reaches the public.  It can certainly be oversimplified and even <br/>
misunderstood in this process.  Being misquoted and mangled in the press <br/>
may be one reason that &quot;experts&quot; can seem so boneheaded.  But not the <br/>
only reason. &lt;g&gt;</div>

<br/>
I think where the statistics can be helpful is when a mother (or more usually <br/>
a father) takes a child in for medical help or counselling for something <br/>
which he&#39;s sure is a serious flaw in his child, and the experts and say <br/>
&quot;Statistically, your child is well in the range of normal [so leave her alone about it, <br/>
she&#39;s fine].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Psychology and Sociology were greatly disparaged and many universities <br/>
wouldn&#39;t count them as science, but they were social sciences or &quot;soft sciences&quot; <br/>
because their stuff was hard to prove, and I think that&#39;s why they moved from <br/>
observation and descriptions of observations and testing more the way unschoolers <br/>
are testing by doing in a natural environment, to lab-tests and statistics.   <br/>
Instead of finding how people behave in their natural habitats (as biologists <br/>
still do without criticism), they went to laboratory tests where people copy <br/>
patterns or respond to stimuli (while sitting in a chair in a lab) and then <br/>
measure and chart how they learn and react.  Then they try to apply that to <br/>
normal life.  Some things apply much better than others.<br/>
<br/>
What they don&#39;t study very well is how regular people act in regular <br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the school reform studies and educational research done in the 60&#39;s <br/>
found some pretty good stuff, but it was pooh-poohed as soft-science nonsense. <br/>
 The arguments against grading, the principle that the way the teacher treats <br/>
a child affects how the child sees himself and moreover that if a teacher is <br/>
given false information about a child, the teacher will react to the <br/>
description instead of the child himself===those studies were pretty awful, because <br/>
they used real kids and teachers, and real kids were treated better or worse by <br/>
real teachers based on scrambled &quot;test scores&quot; and reports from alleged former <br/>
teachers (the researchers).   <br/>
<br/>
An argument back against doing away with grades and measures though was that <br/>
kids in ungraded classrooms were interviewed about who in their class was best <br/>
in math, who was the best reader, etc, and who needed most help, and the kids <br/>
knew better than the teacher did, because the teacher was going by <br/>
performance on tests and assignments.  But still, not grading didn&#39;t give the kids any <br/>
anonymity or safety from the judgment of others.  <br/>
<br/>
So I think it&#39;s interesting to know what people have learned about classroom <br/>
behavior if one is going to work in a classroom, and it might be helpful even <br/>
for people who are going to run big homeschooling groups to be a little aware <br/>
of interpersonal realities and potential problems, but if each of those <br/>
studies and principles is seen as one tiny piece in a huge, changing puzzle it&#39;s <br/>
more helpful than if any one of them is seen as The Big News that changes <br/>
anything.<br/>
