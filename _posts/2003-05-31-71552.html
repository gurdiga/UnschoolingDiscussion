<div id="ygrps-yiv-428510173">I&#39;ve been thinking about this,<br/>
<br/>
Just got my book last weekend.   I thought,  when I ordered the book,  that this was just like the old one, but with some comments by Farenga.   There is also some updated statistics and such;  and more homeschooling resources.<br/>
<br/>
I just started reading it.   I&#39;ll let you all know what its like when I&#39;ve gotten into it more.<br/>
<br/>
I will also be able to do a good comparison of unschooling SC-style and Farenga this August.   He&#39;s the keynote speaker at the Minnesota Homeschooling Conference,  which happens to be two weekends after SC.   I&#39;ll be going to both, so it will be interesting.<br/>
