 </span></blockquote>I will second that report.  Landon reads a lot of fanfiction and he has told <br/>
me a lot of it is very explicit.  Some of it contains  what most would deem as <br/>
sexually deviant material, not just &quot;pornographic&quot;  He is almost 17, and I <br/>
trust his judgement, I have never screened the stuff he browses online.. BUT, if <br/>
I had a younger child (say, under 15) that was interested in Fanfiction, I <br/>
would screen it for them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658258004">I asked my daughter about this and she said that the people who go there<br/>
complained about the NC-17-rated stories so that is why they got rid of<br/>
them.  She said she never saw any ones rated X (never saw them, not saw them<br/>
but didn&#39;t look).  I believe the web owner monitors the stories well.  I<br/>
know that she had written down the words to a song in one of her stories and<br/>
they deleted the whole story because she plagerized the song by not telling<br/>
everyone where she got it from.  She realized afterward what she had done<br/>
wrong, but she wished they only deleted that chapter.  She learned a lesson<br/>
in plagerization and in backing up her work.<br/>
<br/>
We came up with a similar problem when she first got interested in Anime.<br/>
She would go to people&#39;s Anime websites and send them email telling them<br/>
that she liked their websites.  When you send email from my computer it<br/>
sends it from Outlook Express, which is my email.  She got a reply from one<br/>
person who sent her Manga (Japanese drawings of human figures) that I didn&#39;t<br/>
like.  It was erotic, but not explicit.  I deleted the message.  I told her<br/>
that she got an answer and I told her that I deleted it and why.  She was ok<br/>
with that.  That only happened one time, though.<br/>

Potter where his hatred for Draco Malfoy is just a cover for their &gt; mutual<br/>
unresolved sexual attraction, and I *know* that not everybody is &gt; expecting<br/>
that when they let their kids read at this website.  FYI.&gt;<br/>
