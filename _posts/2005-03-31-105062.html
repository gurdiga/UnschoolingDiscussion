<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151126979">When I was in high school I was tiny, barely 100 pounds at 5&#39;3&quot;.  There was no size 0, and in fact, I wore a size 7/8 most of the time.  That was normal then.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in my late 20s and 25 pounds heavier, and definitely out of shape, I went to buy some ladies Dockers.  Shocked the heck out of me to find that a size 4 fit me.  I&#39;d never been a size 4, even when very skinny.<br/>
<br/>
I think a size 3 was the smallest, and very hard to find.<br/>
