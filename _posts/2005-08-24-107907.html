<div id="ygrps-yiv-680472558">***The dilemma seemed to <br/>
me to be over whether a parent choosing to offer personal opinions and <br/>
judgments when the child hadn&#39;t asked was consistent with unschooling.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
If I was at a friends house and my kid stepped in dog poo I&#39;d help him<br/>
clean it off his shoe before he tracked it in.   If he had a major booger<br/>
hanging out his nose I&#39;d give him a tissue.   Unschooling is natural<br/>
learning and it seems very natural for a mom to help her kid in these<br/>
situations.   I&#39;d do the same thing for my husband or a stranger and I<br/>
sure hope someone would do it for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Likewise if I was making a social mess of things, if I was stepping in<br/>
social poo or if I had the booger of anti social behavior hanging out my<br/>
nose I&#39;d hope someone would point it out so I could clean up.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference between a real booger and a social booger?   (One<br/>
tastes better! HA!)  But seriously, what is the difference?   I&#39;ll bet<br/>
most moms wondering how much help/opinion/advice to offer wiped boogers<br/>
and cleaned up poo. <br/>
<br/>
***Or whether this were the same kind of thing as &quot;teachable moments,&quot; <br/>
demonstrating a lack of trust in the child&#39;s own discerning powers and <br/>
ability to learn about the world.***<br/>
<br/>
When I helped my little kid get dressed it wasn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t trust<br/>
him it was because I saw he needed help.   Today if I see him carrying a<br/>
big load of laundry I take part of the load, or open the door or whatever<br/>
I can do to help.   I don&#39;t see offering help as a demonstration of lack<br/>
of trust.   I don&#39;t help because I don&#39;t trust him to get the laundry to<br/>
the washer, I help because it&#39;s the right thing to do.  <br/>
<br/>
If my child offers his opinion or advice I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because he<br/>
doesn&#39;t trust me.  I think it&#39;s because he wants to help me.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is that part of what&#39;s missing?   Children in a situation in which <br/>
communication and discussion are normal and honest can &quot;judge&quot; their parents too (which <br/>
ALL children do, and must, it&#39;s just some learn to do it internally only, <br/>
which adds to the negativity of the judgment).   If I make a social faux pas or <br/>
one of the kids wishes I would do or be different in some situation, they&#39;ll say <br/>
so, and they have lots of ways to say it nicely and helpfully and calmly, <br/>
partly (I&#39;m sure) because we&#39;ve done that for them.    <br/>
