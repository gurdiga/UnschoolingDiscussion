<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528732595">We are using Power Glide right now, trying to learn Japanese. It seems to<br/>
work well.  My son (9) finds it fun and interesting.  I added my fathers<br/>
old Japanese phrase book from WW2 to give us a broader beginning<br/>
vocabulary.  I don&#39;t know about the other languages but with Japanese,<br/>
you begin with mnemonic programing and phonetic approximations which<br/>
really work,  and then move into conversation.  <br/>
As to what to learn, I can&#39;t help you there.  I wanted to learn Spanish<br/>
because we have Spanish speaking family members and already use a few<br/>
words and phrases.  My son however decided on Japanese so here we go.  <br/>
We went with Power Glide because I had a chance to look at a friends<br/>
Spanish Power Glide course.   Maybe you can find examples too, and decide<br/>
from there.  <br/>
Anyway, have fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131896178">Tami,<br/>
My son has been interested in learning sign language for a few years. <br/>
How did you go about it?  We don&#39;t know anyone near us who uses it. <br/>
There is a school for the deaf in my state but too far away for us to<br/>
participate in any of their community programs.  <br/>
I&#39;m still looking for someone who might teach him but in the mean time,<br/>
do you think it&#39;s possible to begin learning from a book?  This really<br/>
intimidates me for some reason.  I have a book but have been worried<br/>
about beginning in case we learn something the wrong way and don&#39;t know<br/>
it.  I have found a few web sites that seem helpful.   Should we just<br/>
jump in and straighten out our mistakes later if we find an instructor? <br/>
I&#39;d appreciate any advice. <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-35137055">Years ago my best friend had a son who lost his hearing due to one of the<br/>
&quot;you have to put tubes in his ears or he will be deaf&quot; surgeries that were<br/>
pushed on everyone whose kids got so much as more than one ear infection.<br/>
We all learned sign language from books.  That would be adults through<br/>
kidlets 2 and up.<br/>
<br/>
So, it is possible to learn it from a book and there are videos now too.<br/>
&quot;Sign Language For Everyone&quot; has a book and a video.  The &quot;Beginning Sign<br/>
Language Series&quot; has lots of booklets for younger children (The Finger<br/>
Alphabet, Foods, Mother Goose, etc.).  &quot;Signs For Me&quot; has a foreign language<br/>
dictionary in the back.  &quot;Come Sign With Us&quot; has a book and video.  There<br/>
are also sign language flash cards.<br/>

We bought a sign language book and made copies of the ones for the items in <br/>
our home, i.e. refrigerator, etc. Taped them to that item. Also, we had a <br/>
day here and there where we &quot;couldnt talk :)&quot; an Elly idea so we could only <br/>
communicate with sign language, got kinda crazy at times ;) Here are a few <br/>
links to maybe help out.<br/>
