<div id="ygrps-yiv-437115588">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
My 8 yo dd loves any kind of math ... she did workbooks for a while <br/>
(singapore), loved them at first, then decided they were too easy. She <br/>
skipped on to an old 5th grade math book we had from &quot;the early days&quot;.  <br/>
She got about a third of the way through, stopped - too boring, too <br/>
easy, waste of time. She asked for and put on her shelf another book - <br/>
one of those mega math books that covers everything from arithmetic and <br/>
algebra to geometry and statistics (I think she likes knowing it&#39;s there <br/>
and she could do it if she wants - I don&#39;t know if it will ever actually <br/>
get used as a text, but it makes a nice reference book. Today we used it <br/>
to compare Chinese numbers (Sagwa) to hindu-arabic). But, she wants to <br/>
just do fun math for a while, to which I said fine. She likes stuff she <br/>
can do with her hands - even with books, she uses all sorts of <br/>
manipulatives from around the house - she doesn&#39;t want books, and <br/>
computer games are a second choice, but we&#39;d like  a couple of those <br/>
too. So, any thoughts on games, puzzles, computer games, etc. for a kid <br/>
who loves math?  She understands fractions, decimals, money, the basics <br/>
and likes any kind of puzzle. We&#39;re going puzzle shopping tomorrow. She <br/>
likes to cook, so she gets plenty there, and she loves anything with <br/>
patterns, and she likes music, so she gets that (quarter notes, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
So, what are some of the favorites out there?  Thanks much!<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Susan<br/>
<br/>

we arrive at that goal.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
The book, How Math Works, by Vorderman has a variety of hands-on math<br/>
activities.  The first one is making a puzzle with the Chinese numerals<br/>
from one to ten.  The book is recommended for ages 8 and up.<br/>
<br/>
Your library may have this book.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Soroshians two talks on Joyful Math from the HSC conference are<br/>
available online and are chockful of ideas.  There&#39;s a page to order<br/>
them somewhere on the hsc site,   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a>  <br/>

Well, this isn&#39;t a Maths game but a Maths resource that my yougnest two sons like - a book, Math By Kids, published by Pennsylvania Homeschoolers. Kids of all ages have written their own Maths problems, for others to solve. Some are really creative! My youngest two sons like me to read a problem aloud and we try to solve it together.  Mostly orally. They also like writing their own Maths problems for dad to solve when he comes home from work...And I like that it is their choice - I bought the book, it sounded interesting, I  left it around and read out some problems and they have become keen! ..Leonie W. <br/>

OR discoverying or inventing a new way to present them. Magic could probably <br/>
be broken down into just a few basic moves/illusions. The &quot;magic&quot; is in the <br/>
presentation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the same gimmick used by two totally different magicians. The first <br/>
was a complete groaner--downright embarrassing. The second was stunning and <br/>
awe-inspiring.<br/>
