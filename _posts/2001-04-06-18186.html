&lt;&lt;  They&#39;re at the unschooling <br/>
 stage, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good place to tell horror-anecdotes of <br/>
 school and its effect on particular kids you don&#39;t even know.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     I didn&#39;t read the beginning of all this...only the environmental <br/>
aspects.  I want to say that I didn&#39;t agree with the statement that seemed <br/>
like a personal attack on you, Sandra, because I have always found that is <br/>
how respectful debates over issues turn into angry arguments with little <br/>
positive coming out of them.  <br/>
     I missed some of the posts because I had been leary of opening the <br/>
emails that showed as some kind of attachments on my computer but there are <br/>
so many of them on this list now that I finally just started opening them <br/>
yesterday.  I didn&#39;t know if this would make me more likely to pick up a <br/>
virus because AOL always posts a warning before I open them.<br/>
     Anyway, I was just thinking about something this morning relating to <br/>
what you just said.  My sister just had twins, a boy and a girl, in January <br/>
and was telling me that she doesn&#39;t know if she&#39;ll homeschool, that it <br/>
depends upon whether the schools really make her mad.  So I was thinking, <br/>
realizing that I no longer homeschool because the public schools were such a <br/>
disallusionment to me.  That is definitely what initially brought me this <br/>
direction but I now homeschool/unschool because I can&#39;t imagine us living any <br/>
other way.  This just feels so normal to me and my family.  I unschool <br/>
because it&#39;s wonderful and not because the schools aren&#39;t.  This may not seem <br/>
like an important distinction but it is a different feeling within me.  It <br/>
used to be that if friends asked why we homeschool, I would explain why I was <br/>
down on the schools and didn&#39;t want my kids there.  Now, the first thing that <br/>
would come to my head, I think, is that it enables us to live in a way that <br/>
we really enjoy, lets the kids grow and learn in such healthy ways, etc.<br/>
     I think for those that come out of the school systems, this is something <br/>
that takes time because for a while, you are pretty focused on what was wrong <br/>
with those systems and the bad experiences your kids had there.  Also, my <br/>
parents both work for public schools so I am still sometimes reeling from <br/>
things they tell me that go on there.  But there is something more positive <br/>
and peaceful about coming TO something, rather than running FROM something.<br/>

there!  I don&#39;t want school in my kids&#39; lives any more than it naturally <br/>
occurs (like going to friends&#39; plays, or the 8th grade &quot;graduation&quot; to high <br/>
school, or the very occasional such thing). <br/>
