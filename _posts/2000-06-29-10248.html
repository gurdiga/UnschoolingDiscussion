<div id="ygrps-yiv-312460821">Actually spanking is just hitting (or worse). Correction usually has something to do with logical consequences or learnig from mistakes. Any fool can hit, it takes thought to teach right from wrong. I don&#39;t see how hitting can be applied with love. That&#39;s just an oxymoron. Especially bad on small children. How can you teach them that hitting is wrong when you&#39;re hitting them? Read, learn, keep trying, but no hitting. This world is too violent already.<br/>

&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t dr. laura also advocate legalized abuse via spanking&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So spanking is abuse??  According to whom&gt;  You?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Spanking is correction, beating is abuse.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is your opinion, and rather harshly stated.  Maybe you should allow<br/>
that others may not share your opinion.<br/>
