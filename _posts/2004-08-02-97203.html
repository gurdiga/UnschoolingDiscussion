<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328319233">I never played Barbies with my own girls (40+ years ago).The girls played with them  together upstairs<br/>
Wish I had; and a Whole !! bunch of other things I have smartened up about with my ggd,s.(age 9 now)<br/>
I havn&#39;t actually &quot;played&quot; &quot;Barbie&quot; (and lots of other imagination toys)<br/>
so much as been available, offered comments, laughed when they explained the funny things, encouraged them to have them  wherever and whenever they wish-They often follow me around so they can play with them where I am. <br/>
When they were small (4 to 6) they liked me to play a little but now  I would be a disruption to their very long and complicated scenarios which can go on for hours or days in between other activities.Grandpa has also always been a willing participant or facilitator. <br/>
Actually one of my primary  reasons for unschooling was to allow them all the time in the world to use their (Extremely Vivid) imaginations.<br/>
I can see such a parallel contradiction in my 13 yr old grandaughter where my daughter dismissed or embarrased her imaginary games so much.<br/>
Actually she will still sometimes  play &quot;Barbies&quot;- with the girls when she comes over (but she closes the playroom door).<br/>
T0 address  the &quot;stultifyingly dull&quot; part-I have often  added comments in a very low key and hopefully  non manipulative way (usually joking) to expand the ways they might approach Barbie interaction. IE-&quot;well lets go scuba diving I want to have some fun and not just sit on the beach with that boring Ken guy&quot; (well you get the picture)<br/>

who is exausted from the heat-a kennel full of dogs for the long weekend and looking after my daughters 6 horses while they are away<br/>
(and no I didnt muck out All of the stalls this morning)<br/>
The girls are still snoozing away.<br/>

I notice you have a 4yo girl. Does she play Barbies? Isn&#39;t it the most<br/>
stultifyingly dull activity in the world? What I do when Jayn wants me to<br/>
play Barbies with her is suggest that I will comb their <br/>
