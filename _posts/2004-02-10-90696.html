<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The past couple of times at my local unschooler&#39;s support meeting, I&#39;ve<br/>
 </span></blockquote>brought up the concept of strewing. &lt;snip&gt; I&#39;ve talked about how it&#39;s a<br/>
genuine act rather than a curriculum oriented act--that you do it without a<br/>
vested interest in whether the kids pick it up or not, much like you might<br/>
offer a guest a cup of coffee without being offended if they really<br/>
preferred tea. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
 Children will inevitably &quot;bump&quot; into things by living without parents&#39;<br/>
interfering or strewing. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you answer these criticisms? &gt; --danielle<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the way I look at this strewing stuff:  Someone else has already<br/>
mentioned that *not* strewing is like withholding things from your kids, and<br/>
I agree!  I get mail order catelogues, book club brochures, craft supply<br/>
mail order stuff,  I clean out closets or cabinets.  I look through all that<br/>
and sometimes I find things that I&#39;m interested in.  New hobbies, stuff I<br/>
want to read, that sort of thing.  But my kids aren&#39;t exposed to as much<br/>
stuff as I am.  All that stuff that comes in the mail comes addressed to me<br/>
or their Dad, and they don&#39;t want to plow through it!  And they don&#39;t enjoy<br/>
wandering around stores to see what&#39;s new.  So I do that for them, just like<br/>
I do a lot of other things that they either don&#39;t enjoy or aren&#39;t able to<br/>
do.  Since I am exposed to things that they aren&#39;t, it&#39;s my job to let them<br/>
know what I&#39;ve gleaned from it that might be useful/interesting to them.<br/>
Strewing is how I let them know what&#39;s out there.<br/>
    This applies especially to my daughter.  She 9 and she&#39;s an artist.  You<br/>
never know what materials might be inspirational or exactly the right thing<br/>
for what she&#39;s working on.  How much is she going to run into as opposed to<br/>
what I am exposed to?  And besides, she&#39;s busy!  She doesn&#39;t have time to go<br/>
through all those books that are absolutely of no interest to her just so<br/>
she&#39;ll find that one book on sewing felt!  But if that one book that&#39;s a<br/>
treasure is just sitting on her crafts table, I&#39;ve done something really<br/>
nice for her.    If I just hand her something she acts like she has to<br/>
immediately decide if it&#39;s useful to her or not.  If  the book is just<br/>
sitting there, it separates my feelings from whether the book or craft<br/>
material is actually interesting/useful.  She can look it over without<br/>
having to take my feelings and possible motives into account.<br/>
    Seeing a really cool book or video on old cars at the library in a<br/>
section my son doesn&#39;t usually walk through, and then not showing it to him<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a nice thing to do!   Maybe he&#39;s so interested in DragonBall Z<br/>
right now that he doesn&#39;t care about old cars anymore, but how do you know<br/>
if you don&#39;t put it out there for him?    If that book is just sitting<br/>
around, it would give him something to do when he needs a break from the<br/>
other stuff he&#39;s working so hard on.<br/>
    Everyone in my family reads.  If we are eating alone, and there&#39;s<br/>
nothing to read, we read the cereal box.  I think I&#39;m doing them a favor<br/>
putting something out that&#39;s more interesting than the cereal box.   I don&#39;t<br/>
see this as interfering or controlling.  I think I&#39;m being helpful and<br/>
interested in my kids.<br/>

It strikes me that many people are willing to be this thoughtful and <br/>
look for &quot;stuff&quot; that other people can use happily at Christmas time. <br/>
 Strewn stuff can be thought of as a series of gifts, treats or delights <br/>
for ALL 12 months of the year, not just December.  With some budgetary <br/>
adjustments, most likely.<br/>

<br/>
And, for me, if I was already doing something else, I might make the <br/>
snap decision &quot;not useful&quot;.  Finding something when I was idle would <br/>
increase the probability that I would chose to get into something.</div>
