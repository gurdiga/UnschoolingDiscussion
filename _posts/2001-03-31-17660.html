 miles inland from Bodega Bay, where Birds was filmed, and for years <br/>
 these big black birds would come sit in her backyard and just watch <br/>
 us intently... it was eerie!<br/>

Maybe they were waiting for one of you to shout, &quot;Lights, camera, action!&quot;<br/>

I had lunch in the cafe used for the film when I was a kid.  I still remember <br/>
it but didn&#39;t realize it was the same one until my mom pointed it out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, Lynda. Isn&#39;t the school in Bodega as well? I remember <br/>
riding around with my mom, aunt, and grandma checking out the <br/>
filmsites many years ago...<br/>
<br/>
Our three youngest kids (15-20) and I drove down Highway 101 and <br/>
right through there last fall on the way to visit their older <br/>
brother, who was staying in Vallejo. I showed them the difference <br/>
between where the buildings appeared to be in the movie and where <br/>
they are in reality... Seems like the school was on a hill pretty far <br/>
inland. The kids thought it was pretty tricky of ol&#39; Hitch to make <br/>
those buildings seem to be right there by the bay when they&#39;re really <br/>
several miles inland. We had a good time discussing how camera magic <br/>
was more impressive back then - these days they&#39;d have just done it <br/>
all with computers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

smell like eucalyptus?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397073366">The town of Bodega is actually a bend in the road on the way from Santa Rosa<br/>
(101) to Bodega Bay.  The church is almost to the top of the hill and the<br/>
house is on the same little street.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember the name of the other movie but those that are Hitchcock<br/>
fans will remember the one with the burning building (don&#39;t remember what it<br/>
was suppose to be) but that was the original Carnegie library in Santa Rosa.<br/>
He made two other movies, that I know of, in Sonoma County.<br/>
<br/>
Pollyanna was also made in Santa Rosa and that house can still be seen.<br/>
American Graffiti was made in Petaluma.  There were several Disney movies<br/>
made in and around Santa Rosa that we got to be extras in when we were in<br/>
high school because a friend&#39;s mother was the location nurse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298023958">About 8 years ago the avenue of ecu&#39;s took a big hit from a really heavy<br/>
frost but they have come back even thicker.  Some of the euc&#39;s are now 50 to<br/>
100 feet tall.  during the summer you can smell them long before you get<br/>

I think my mom used to call them &quot;buttons&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s <br/>
official.  *grin*  My aunt Wanda lived there (actually my mom&#39;s best friend) <br/>
and she died young.  The smell of eucalyptus and sweet peas both make me <br/>
think of her.<br/>

I also remember the onion processing plant we would pass on the route to and <br/>
from Vallejo to Sacramento.  I hated the smell as a kid but I would probably <br/>
love it now.<br/>

The absolute worst smell were the sugar plants along I-5 between Sacramento <br/>
and Fresno!  Smelled like an outhouse!  Wonder why it never turned me off to <br/>
sugar.<br/>
<br/>
I love the way smells bring about memories and that feeling of &#39;almost&#39; being <br/>
there.<br/>
