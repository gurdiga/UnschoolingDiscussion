<div id="ygrps-yiv-503206946">Not so much I&#39;m looking, but I&#39;d like to see whether anyone else knows  <br/>
her and might want to help her out some.<br/>
<br/>
On MySpace there&#39;s someone listed as a 36 year old mom from Oregon,  <br/>
who posts just as &quot;Unschool.&quot;  Holly had commented over the past few  <br/>
months that some of those posts were out there, depressed, depressing,  <br/>
and wondered whether I should say something.  I figured at least there  <br/>
would be people having access to the links on the page, which were  <br/>
decent.  And some of the posts were good.  But increasingly they  <br/>
became strident, and hateful.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows who that is, maybe visit her or call or e-mail to see   <br/>
if she&#39;s okay, because she doesn&#39;t really seem to be.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the recent negative things:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOL Arguing w/ a &#39;farmer&#39; on Twitter. Why? &#39;Cause I can.<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOL I&#39;m used to be ignored/unseen. Very familiar. Doesn&#39;t make it  <br/>
feel any better... Oh well.<br/>
Mood: fuck it<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOL Know what is interesting? We are allllllllll just people -  <br/>
fucked up in the brain<br/>
Mood: no one cares<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOL I feel sad :&#39;( Sometimes I wonder - why... do I bother.<br/>
Mood: shit<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOL That Ke$ha Album Premiere photo is stupid. It looks like she  <br/>
is about to vomit into her hands.<br/>
Mood: f&#39;n ads<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOL Spend less, consume less. Live more. And kick your TV to the  <br/>
curb!<br/>
Mood: contemplative<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOL Trying to detox. It&#39; hard enough w/ the diet but what do you  <br/>
do w/ all the toxic people in your life?<br/>
Mood: overwhelmed<br/>
<br/>
=============================<br/>
<br/>
First, I&#39;m concerned that she&#39;s using &quot;Unschool&quot; rather than her real  <br/>
name, because that stuff isn&#39;t uplifting, it&#39;s not helpful to or about  <br/>
unschooling, and I wish she would just use her real name.  I wish  <br/>
everyone would use a real name, either theirs or a reasonable and  <br/>
consistent fictitious name, but not to post as &quot;unschool&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Second, last night late she wrote something hateful about Holly, in  <br/>
public.  She wrote something stupid in a comment to me too, but I&#39;m  <br/>
used to that.  She&#39;s picking on my baby, though, now, so I wondered if  <br/>
maybe someone here could contact her, see if she&#39;s depressed, see if  <br/>
she wants to delete that hateful nonsense, and maybe change her  <br/>
username on MySpace.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
(Here&#39;s what she posted about me:      Your kids suck. YOU = FAIL<br/>
<br/>
I know; it&#39;s MySpace.  Jr.-high-style behavior should be expected.   <br/>
But she&#39;s posting as &quot;Unschool,&quot; and she insulted my Holly. )<br/>

pulled up myspace after reading here.  I don&#39;t know her, though.  I don&#39;t<br/>
use my myspace account, I only have 24 friends.  I must have approved a<br/>
friendship request from her because I figured she was an unschooler.  Wow,<br/>
she sure is negative!  Not only that, but, rude.<br/>

<br/>
If she&#39;s listed Village Free School, then she&#39;s in Portland right?  Sandra is listed as one of her friends.  Other than Sandra, I recognized one name on her friend&#39;s list, she&#39;s a face book friend.  I will ask her.  She doesn&#39;t appear to have her kids in the Village Free School, as I know others there and they aren&#39;t listed as friends, it&#39;s a pretty tight community, so I assume she&#39;d have at least one friend from there....<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a mystery!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry about that Sandra, about all of that!  Those who really know, know that she&#39;s not right about Holly!  Holly is awesome!<br/>
<br/>
This goes right in the &quot;cynicism spoils happy unschooling&quot;.  It really does!  It seems this person cares more about animals than being nice to people, which is also one philosophy trumping another.<br/>

UNSCHOOL Posted 33 minutes ago<br/>
I said some rude things about an unschooler and her mom... No matter  <br/>
how I felt, I shouldn&#39;t have blurted out what I did. Sometimes, on the  <br/>
internet - you write/say things and it doesn&#39;t seem like anyone is  <br/>
listening. Wrong.<br/>
<br/>
=====================================<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t understand &quot;turrets has passed&quot; at first, but I guess maybe  <br/>
&quot;tourette&#39;s&quot; is what she meant.   I&#39;m sure Tourette&#39;s never causes  <br/>
people to sign onto a website and type and the hit &quot;send.&quot;  But just  <br/>
as many people do, it&#39;s being used as &quot;king&#39;s X&quot; or &quot;time out&quot;--an  <br/>
excuse for very bad behavior.  &quot;It&#39;s not my fault, I have tourette&#39;s.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that &quot;I said some rude things&quot; wasn&#39;t at all an apology.  It says  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I got caught.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m disappointed, and I wish she would stop using &quot;unschool&quot; as a name.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this is so off topic for the list, but it does seem a good  <br/>
example of how much more worthwhile it is to be hopeful and happy than  <br/>
to be negative and cynical.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s too off topic.  I mean look at how many people over the years have written stuff in anger, only to regret it later.  People DO get defensive and mean.  People who have been on unschooling lists for a long time know that because they&#39;ve seen it happen many times over the years.<br/>
<br/>
What we write and how we present ourselves are a big part of who we are as a person.  I try to be really careful about what I put online.  There is something on my blog that I&#39;ve toyed with taking off for a while, but each time I decide to leave it there.  It&#39;s me reacting to something, not my best writing, but everything I said was true.  If the person, who it&#39;s about ever saw it, she&#39;d be mad.  She might not let her daughter hang out with my daughter anymore.  I talked to Chamille about it and she said to leave it.  I&#39;ve talked with the woman since the initial incidence that caused me to write, but she has yet to apologize to Chamille for the cruel things she said and the way she said it.  In a way I guess I&#39;m holding onto it waiting for that to happen (and it&#39;s an interesting peice of writing that shows how Chamille analytically poured her emotions out).<br/>
<br/>
If a person chooses to represent themselves online as &quot;unschool&quot;, they should acknowledge that they may have an audience because unschooling has a small population to begin with, and it&#39;s largely online.  So if this woman had written about anyone else, it may or may not have had ripples, but she chose to write about Holly, yucky things, while simultaneously having links to Sandra&#39;s website and a video of Pam Sorooshian, one of Sandra&#39;s good friends.  That makes it even more tacky!  It&#39;s thoughtless and unschooling requires more thought, not less!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also say that unschooling requires honesty and happiness to flourish.  In a way, it highlights a good example of what NOT to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

unfettered online account? The vocabulary and style seem immature.<br/>
<br/>
Just a guess from these few quotes.<br/>

she talks about her daughter (and her son, I think).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342862871">I know from living it and living in it, that a negative outlook *is* boring<br/>
and mundane once a person begins to find ways to look at life differently.<br/>
It&#39;s a little little box to put oneself in. And I think it&#39;s naturally<br/>
common in a culture that discourages emotion closeness and doesn&#39;t nurture<br/>
kids. I see it a lot online and somewhat in real life, and I stay away from<br/>
it as much as possible. While it concerns me for the people in the lives of<br/>
negative folks who must be dodging it or agreeing with it too, all *I* can<br/>
do (sometimes ... maybe) is plant of little seed of positivity or happy<br/>
thought that might grow (or not). Mostly I tend my own garden, watering and<br/>
enriching the happiness planted there by me and others.<br/>
<br/>
Both of those perspectives can come on their own, one can be infected with<br/>
it from someone else, or it can even be called into existence and fed, made<br/>
to grow bigger and bigger. It&#39;s good to know that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing the effect of either perspective in a life; positive and<br/>
negative. Not that everything is positive but one&#39;s perspective can be<br/>
generally positive even about negative things. Or it can be negative about<br/>
positive things. Life being what it is, things are what they are but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean my outlook need be grim. And for the people around me,<br/>
especially for Karl, I remind myself often to stay away from stewing and<br/>
muttering over things that aren&#39;t always as we might like them to be.<br/>
<br/>
And yes the little little box that negativity is can stupify a person into<br/>
all sorts of regressions and inwardnesses, navel gazing in the worst ways.<br/>
By contrast, the big wide openness that emotional positivity is can stupify<br/>
in a good way in the other direction, toward life rather than away from it.<br/>
<br/>
Go toward the light.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-899232053">My impression, from the scattered, disorganized thinking she seems to have, when combined with her clear mood swings, is she is bi polar and not getting treatment. As bad as I feel for Holly and Sandra, I feel the most pity for this other woman who clearly has no local support system to help her and she seems unaware of how &quot;off&quot; her thinking process is at times. Maybe someone should invite her to attend Life Is Good, I believe that&#39;s the closest unschool conference to her area.<br/>
<br/>
In peace,<br/>

<br/>
Not if she&#39;s mean and crazy.  Even bi-polar people in their worst  <br/>
moments should be able to avoid really bad behavior.  And if a good  <br/>
moment returns, an apology might be nice, rather than a justification.<br/>
<br/>
I think she should stay home.  I just hoped someone here knew her and  <br/>
could talk to her directly about the benefits to her and her  <br/>
child(ren) of being more soft and positive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As bad as I feel for Holly and Sandra...-=-  It didn&#39;t hurt me or  <br/>
Holly.  I&#39;d like for the woman to stop being destructive, but she&#39;s  <br/>
not &quot;destroying&quot; any of the happiness at our house, just in her own  <br/>
life and reputation, and the peace of MySpace. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
