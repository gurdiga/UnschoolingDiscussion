 </span></blockquote>So, what do you need help with?  How old are your kids?  Mine are 16, <br/>
14 and almost 10.  What kind of disability?  Two of mine have <br/>
problems but I don&#39;t really consider either of them disabled.  One, <br/>
the 16 yo, has depression problems - has been rolling out of bed at <br/>
3:00 lately (and not staying up all that late)- gotta check on her <br/>
meds again!  The youngest has allergies and probably would be called <br/>
ADHD if he was at school but I know it is really allergy/sensitivity  <br/>
stuff going on.  He also has OCD tendencies but I&#39;m not about to let <br/>
the medical establishment get hold of him yet - he is functional and <br/>
all he needs right now are reminders to curb the odder behaviours.  <br/>
(One of which we call the scratch and sniff) Most of the time we let <br/>
it go but if it is starting to interfere with his life we remind him<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling for almost 7 years now. (Okay honestly, I <br/>
don&#39;t consider my son unschooled, but the other two are.)<br/>
If you need reassurance, I&#39;m the perfect example.  I&#39;ve had two major <br/>
illnesses since we started this venture and I&#39;ve done nothing to <br/>
force knowledge into my kids.  The girls know so much it scares me <br/>
sometimes!  I have no idea where they learned some of it.  So yes, <br/>
this can work.  <br/>
<br/>
So - Fire away with your questions and concerns.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The best way to get unschooling advice is to layout whatever current issue<br/>
has you stymied and wait for the discussion to start. :-) The bickering will<br/>
happen spontaneously but unschooling discussion waits for someone to bring<br/>
it up ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Even at the best of times the list doesn&#39;t cover a broad range of topics.<br/>
The topics kind of bounce about, sort of like a game of hand ball ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The message board at Unschooling.com are less frenetic. There&#39;s a folder<br/>
specifically for Unschooling and Special Needs.<br/>

Do you actually have to sit down and &quot;teach&quot; them or could you use play as a<br/>
means of &quot;teaching.&quot;  Youngest learned the alphabet playing Wheel of Fortune<br/>
and using fridge magnets.  She also had Hedgie alphabet sheet to color that<br/>
you can print out from the net.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things they can play with that could be considered<br/>
educational and come under the heading of teaching without actually sitting<br/>
them down and forcing them to learn something.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always read to the kidlets, even when they were still nursing but when<br/>
they were older we would play a game that was similar to Where In The World<br/>
Is Carman whatshername and they would choose a word and see if they could<br/>
find it on each page.  It wasn&#39;t something that was forced or taught but<br/>
rather just another game that was fun.<br/>
<br/>
I paint and do pastels and they wanted to do the same so I had mini-easels<br/>
set up for them.  They would want me to &quot;help&quot; or sometimes give them ideas<br/>
and I&#39;d draw a letter of the alphabet and they would turn it into an animals<br/>
or plant or something that had that letter as the beginning of its name.<br/>
<br/>
Or they would make draw a picture and I&#39;d turn it into a dot to dot for<br/>
them.  They loved having original works of art turned into things like that.<br/>
<br/>
I have boxes full of this sort of thing and we go back in our year boxes and<br/>
they just about wet their pants looking at some of the alphanimals that they<br/>
invented.  And, just incase you didn&#39;t know, &quot;v&quot; is for &quot;vird&quot; cause<br/>
vultures are too homely for the letter &quot;v&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
These sorts of things might be fun for them and then at least they won&#39;t<br/>
hate the time they spend doing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522401267">Hi Lynda,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input.  Yes, we do lots of fun things where I know they <br/>
are learning about all sorts of things, including letters and numbers.  <br/>
Both of my boys are continually asking questions and that&#39;s how they <br/>
seem to learn the most.  They are very inquisitive.<br/>
<br/>
We play games like Dominoes, Clue Jr., Scrabble Jr., My First Rummikub, <br/>
and other games like that.  They enjoy it all.  And, I know they are <br/>
learning from them.  My husband, unfortunately, is still at the point <br/>
where he would like them to do some worksheets (ugh!!).   So, we do <br/>
them.  I don&#39;t know what else to say.  I know this is an unschooling <br/>
group and I believe I know the unschooling philosophy inside out, but my <br/>
husband is part of this family too and I guess we are accommodating him.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like confrontations or arguments.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, he has come a long way.  I make the daily numbers and <br/>
letters routine as brief and painless as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Mimi<br/>
(who&#39;s always trying to make everybody happy, including herself)<br/>

&gt; find it on each page.  It wasn&#39;t something that was forced or taught but<br/>
&gt; rather just another game that was fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I paint and do pastels and they wanted to do the same so I had <br/>

&gt; set up for them.  They would want me to &quot;help&quot; or sometimes give them <br/>
&gt; ideas<br/>

&gt; Or they would make draw a picture and I&#39;d turn it into a dot to dot for<br/>
&gt; them.  They loved having original works of art turned into things like <br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have boxes full of this sort of thing and we go back in our year <br/>
&gt; boxes and<br/>
&gt; they just about wet their pants looking at some of the alphanimals that <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; invented.  And, just incase you didn&#39;t know, &quot;v&quot; is for &quot;vird&quot; cause<br/>
&gt; vultures are too homely for the letter &quot;v&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These sorts of things might be fun for them and then at least they won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; hate the time they spend doing it.<br/>

&gt;&gt; with my husband and, therefore, I &quot;teach&quot; them numbers and letters <br/>
&gt;&gt; every<br/>
&gt;&gt; day for about 15 minutes.  The boys and I hate it and I know in some <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905440715">Hubby was anti when he first joined our little family.  I mean, why am I not<br/>
surprised &lt;g&gt;  He grew up in Mass where the public schools had uniforms back<br/>
in the 50s and 60s.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gradually worked it around to where he had a light bulb moment when one<br/>
night he was ranting about the kids not spending &quot;x&quot; amount of time at the<br/>
table &quot;doing school work.&quot;  I asked him how he learned to play the guitar<br/>
(grrrr, he hears a song once and he can play it) and he said &quot;I taught<br/>
myself.&quot;  I then asked how he learned to play the sax.  He said at school.<br/>
I asked if he could still play the sax.  He said &quot;no.&quot;  I asked if he had<br/>
ever played the sax after he had to take music in school.  He said &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was out doing a complete tune-up on my &quot;baby&quot; and I asked him if he had<br/>
ever taken auto mechanics in school.  He answered &quot;no, I taught myself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then one evening we were watching something on history and the kidlets were<br/>
spouting factoids right, left and inbetween and he asked them how they knew<br/>
&quot;all that stuff&quot; because it wouldn&#39;t be something that would be covered by<br/>
any &quot;sit down and learn textbooks.&quot;  They just look puzzled and kinda<br/>
shrugged their shoulders like, well doesn&#39;t everyone know that.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I looked at him and said, remember the guitar and the auto mechanics<br/>
discussions we had?  Well, that&#39;s unschooling and so is this.  That was the<br/>
end of his demands that everyone sit down at a particular time and do<br/>
&quot;school&quot; type stuff.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi Lynda,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your input.  Yes, we do lots of fun things where I know they<br/>
&gt; are learning about all sorts of things, including letters and numbers.<br/>
&gt; Both of my boys are continually asking questions and that&#39;s how they<br/>
&gt; seem to learn the most.  They are very inquisitive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We play games like Dominoes, Clue Jr., Scrabble Jr., My First Rummikub,<br/>
&gt; and other games like that.  They enjoy it all.  And, I know they are<br/>
&gt; learning from them.  My husband, unfortunately, is still at the point<br/>
&gt; where he would like them to do some worksheets (ugh!!).   So, we do<br/>
&gt; them.  I don&#39;t know what else to say.  I know this is an unschooling<br/>
&gt; group and I believe I know the unschooling philosophy inside out, but my<br/>
&gt; husband is part of this family too and I guess we are accommodating him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like confrontations or arguments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Believe me, he has come a long way.  I make the daily numbers and<br/>
&gt; letters routine as brief and painless as possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mimi<br/>
&gt; (who&#39;s always trying to make everybody happy, including herself)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Do you actually have to sit down and &quot;teach&quot; them or could you use play<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; means of &quot;teaching.&quot;  Youngest learned the alphabet playing Wheel of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Fortune<br/>
&gt; &gt; and using fridge magnets.  She also had Hedgie alphabet sheet to color<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can print out from the net.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are lots of things they can play with that could be considered<br/>
&gt; &gt; educational and come under the heading of teaching without actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; sitting<br/>
&gt; &gt; them down and forcing them to learn something.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always read to the kidlets, even when they were still nursing but<br/>
&gt; &gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; they were older we would play a game that was similar to Where In The<br/>
&gt; &gt; World<br/>

&gt; &gt; animals<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Or they would make draw a picture and I&#39;d turn it into a dot to dot for<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.  They loved having original works of art turned into things like<br/>
&gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have boxes full of this sort of thing and we go back in our year<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they just about wet their pants looking at some of the alphanimals that<br/>

<p><small><time> 8 Dec 2001, at  9:17am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113962430">Yes.  I understand.  My husband, as well, considers himself to be <br/>
self-educated in many ways.  He&#39;s a brilliant chemist who designs and <br/>
machines his own reactors and produces new compounds.  He credits his <br/>
hard work and love of chemistry for the knowledge he has, not, so much, <br/>
his college professors.  His hero is Richard Feynman, a brilliant <br/>
physicist.  He&#39;s read all of his books and all the books about Feynman.  <br/>
He studies his lectures and is increasing his knowledge of Physics.  <br/>
Feynman, also considered himself to be self-educated.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a true believer in self-education.  I don&#39;t think he <br/>
understands, however, that this short period (15 min./day) of forced <br/>
learning/teaching of numbers and letters can have a detrimental effect <br/>
on the boys.<br/>
<br/>
One of the problems is the neighbor across the street.  I consider him <br/>
to be a negative influence on my husband when it comes to unschooling.  <br/>
He&#39;s a really nice guy but he doesn&#39;t have a clue about unschooling.  He <br/>
has a 10 yo daughter he is homeschooling.  I know he loves her very <br/>
much, but I think he looks at her education as some sort of a project.  <br/>
He has said:  &quot;I want her to be one of the few educated elite!&quot;  He <br/>
signed her up for something called CHILD U on the net.  He makes her <br/>
work on various subjects for hours every day.  She can&#39;t come and play <br/>
with my boys until she&#39;s done!  Both my husband and I don&#39;t agree with <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that this guy is a linguist and he keeps talking about <br/>
these &quot;windows of learning&quot;.  How kids should learn how to read within <br/>
such and such a time-frame.  And, how it&#39;s important they have to learn <br/>
addition by such and such an age, etc.  This neighbor and my husband are <br/>
pretty good friends.  They see each other and talk for at least a couple <br/>
of hours every day.  So my husband hears stuff like this from him all <br/>
the time.  I&#39;m just thankful that my husband is not like him, but, <br/>
unfortunately, he is slightly influenced by him.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve gradually worked it around to where he had a light bulb moment <br/>

&gt; night he was ranting about the kids not spending &quot;x&quot; amount of time at <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; table &quot;doing school work.&quot;  I asked him how he learned to play the <br/>
&gt; guitar<br/>
&gt; (grrrr, he hears a song once and he can play it) and he said &quot;I taught<br/>
&gt; myself.&quot;  I then asked how he learned to play the sax.  He said at <br/>
&gt; school.<br/>
&gt; I asked if he could still play the sax.  He said &quot;no.&quot;  I asked if he <br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; ever played the sax after he had to take music in school.  He said &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He was out doing a complete tune-up on my &quot;baby&quot; and I asked him if he <br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; ever taken auto mechanics in school.  He answered &quot;no, I taught myself.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then one evening we were watching something on history and the kidlets <br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; spouting factoids right, left and inbetween and he asked them how they <br/>
&gt; knew<br/>
&gt; &quot;all that stuff&quot; because it wouldn&#39;t be something that would be covered <br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; any &quot;sit down and learn textbooks.&quot;  They just look puzzled and kinda<br/>
&gt; shrugged their shoulders like, well doesn&#39;t everyone know that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I looked at him and said, remember the guitar and the auto <br/>
&gt; mechanics<br/>
&gt; discussions we had?  Well, that&#39;s unschooling and so is this.  That was <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; end of his demands that everyone sit down at a particular time and do<br/>
&gt; &quot;school&quot; type stuff.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hi Lynda,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks for your input.  Yes, we do lots of fun things where I know they<br/>
&gt;&gt; are learning about all sorts of things, including letters and numbers.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Both of my boys are continually asking questions and that&#39;s how they<br/>
&gt;&gt; seem to learn the most.  They are very inquisitive.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We play games like Dominoes, Clue Jr., Scrabble Jr., My First Rummikub,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and other games like that.  They enjoy it all.  And, I know they are<br/>
&gt;&gt; learning from them.  My husband, unfortunately, is still at the point<br/>
&gt;&gt; where he would like them to do some worksheets (ugh!!).   So, we do<br/>
&gt;&gt; them.  I don&#39;t know what else to say.  I know this is an unschooling<br/>
&gt;&gt; group and I believe I know the unschooling philosophy inside out, but <br/>
&gt;&gt; my<br/>
&gt;&gt; husband is part of this family too and I guess we are accommodating <br/>
&gt;&gt; him.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t like confrontations or arguments.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Believe me, he has come a long way.  I make the daily numbers and<br/>
&gt;&gt; letters routine as brief and painless as possible.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Mimi<br/>
&gt;&gt; (who&#39;s always trying to make everybody happy, including herself)<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you actually have to sit down and &quot;teach&quot; them or could you use <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; play<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; means of &quot;teaching.&quot;  Youngest learned the alphabet playing Wheel of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fortune<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and using fridge magnets.  She also had Hedgie alphabet sheet to color<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can print out from the net.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; There are lots of things they can play with that could be considered<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; educational and come under the heading of teaching without actually<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; sitting<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; them down and forcing them to learn something.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve always read to the kidlets, even when they were still nursing but<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; when<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; they were older we would play a game that was similar to Where In The<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; World<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Carman whatshername and they would choose a word and see if they<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; could<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; find it on each page.  It wasn&#39;t something that was forced or taught <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; but<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; rather just another game that was fun.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I paint and do pastels and they wanted to do the same so I had<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mini-easels<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; set up for them.  They would want me to &quot;help&quot; or sometimes give them<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ideas<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I&#39;d draw a letter of the alphabet and they would turn it into an<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; animals<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; or plant or something that had that letter as the beginning of its <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; name.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Or they would make draw a picture and I&#39;d turn it into a dot to dot <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; them.  They loved having original works of art turned into things like<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have boxes full of this sort of thing and we go back in our year<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; boxes and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; they just about wet their pants looking at some of the alphanimals <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; they<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; invented.  And, just incase you didn&#39;t know, &quot;v&quot; is for &quot;vird&quot; cause<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; vultures are too homely for the letter &quot;v&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; These sorts of things might be fun for them and then at least they <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; hate the time they spend doing it.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh Dar.  I wish I could say the same thing.  But I&#39;ve had to <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compromise<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with my husband and, therefore, I &quot;teach&quot; them numbers and letters<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day for about 15 minutes.  The boys and I hate it and I know in some<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is hurting them, but at least my boys are not in school.  My <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; husband<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has come a long way to the unschooling ways but he&#39;s still not all <br/>

letters and words during a certain period might find it very hard to learn <br/>

Yes.  I understand.  My husband, as well, considers himself to be<br/>
self-educated in many ways.  He&#39;s a brilliant chemist who designs and<br/>
machines his own reactors and produces new compounds.  He credits his<br/>
hard work and love of chemistry for the knowledge he has, not, so much,<br/>
his college professors.  His hero is Richard Feynman, a brilliant<br/>
physicist.  He&#39;s read all of his books and all the books about Feynman.<br/>
He studies his lectures and is increasing his knowledge of Physics.<br/>
Feynman, also considered himself to be self-educated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196504355">Yes.  We do know about it.  I really like Alan Alda, but my husband <br/>
doesn&#39;t at all.  We are very different in many ways, but we are also <br/>
very much alike.<br/>
<br/>
Did you see the movie &quot;Infinity&quot; with Matthew Broderick?  We really <br/>
enjoyed it.  It was kind of sad.  Feynman had a very interesting life.<br/>
