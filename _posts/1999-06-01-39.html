<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080985959">What a wonderful bunch this is.<br/>
I&#39;ve so enjoyed it already.....this group just has a good feeling to it.<br/>
<br/>
We are the Yates Family.  we live on a farm in NC.<br/>
We have horses, goats, chickens, ducks,  dogs, cats and a partridge in a<br/>
pear tree!  :)  (Just kidding)<br/>
The kids are Keller, age 6, Aaron age 4, and Mattingly age 3.  We have<br/>
spent the last six months putting an addition on our home, and boy have<br/>
there been ample opportunities for unschoolng!!!  Now we are<br/>
landscaping, and then we move on to remodeling the kitchen.<br/>
We really enjoy our animals, and mostly spend alot of time playing and<br/>
reading.<br/>
I struggle with &quot;not doing anything&quot;, when I am around others, and do<br/>
that awful thing called &quot;comparing my kids to others&quot;, but I really<br/>
truly feel like unschooling is real life.<br/>
I&#39;m really happy to have found this group of diverse people to share<br/>
with....<br/>
