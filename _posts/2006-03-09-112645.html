<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012185420">The clay pens thinking reminded me of this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We reuse LOTS of stuff at our house.  We have our own weird recycling  <br/>
going on.  The paper butter is wrapped in makes great fire-starting  <br/>
material, and the paper bags from sugar and flour do too.  Paper  <br/>
towels that&#39;ve been used to wipe a greasy surface are GREAT for  <br/>
starting a fire in the hot tub or fireplace.  The plastic bowls that  <br/>
frozen foods come in can be reused lots of times in the microwave.   <br/>
When the kids were little most of their &quot;glasses&quot; were restaurant  <br/>
glasses (Shoney&#39;s, Black-eyed Pea) from kids&#39; meals.  Plastic milk  <br/>
cartons are compost containers and plant-pots and water storage, and  <br/>
frozen solid in the freezer and taken on outings or car trips in  <br/>
summer so there&#39;s ice water to drink as it thaws.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are different levels of &quot;recycling,&quot; and making new cups  <br/>
out of old ones is a good one!  Making plastic &quot;wood&quot; out of old  <br/>
grocery bags is a great one.  Sometimes burning paper trash for fuel  <br/>
(or starter) seems like a waste, but if the alternative is just  <br/>
sticking it in a dump, then no... burning can be better.<br/>
<br/>
I remember lots of &quot;recycling&quot; recommendations that were basically  <br/>
just keeping the trash around as pencil holders and mobiles (&quot;paint  <br/>
trash and hang it in the air!&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Some stores have big bags and I use those as trash bags.  Savers and  <br/>
Target.<br/>
<br/>
Just rambling now, on how disposable clay pipes are in comparison to  <br/>
our everyday disposable stuff.  Fired clay doesn&#39;t break down very  <br/>
well, except when it&#39;s sand-sized and turns to hard parts of soil.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Talk about timely, I am just so glad you posted this.  We have a woodburning <br/>
stove that we heat with, and we ran out of firestarters today.  Our wood is <br/>
wet from rain, too, and it took me half the day to get a roaring fire going. <br/>
These tips are oh-so-appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
We reuse all our plastic zipper bags - they&#39;re easy to wash and hang upside <br/>
down on a bowl of paintbrushes that are on my windowsill.  An added benefit <br/>
is that the water from the bags drips into my hot pepper plant sitting <br/>
there.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I love that our produce market offers big cardboard boxes in lieu of plastic <br/>
bags, and they are perfect for storing my recyclables and newspapers, and <br/>
have handle holes for easy carrying.<br/>
<br/>
We also use cloth napkins instead of paper.  They&#39;re nothing to add to any <br/>
load of laundry, and since I hate running errands, it&#39;s one less thing to <br/>
run out of and go without until I muster the interest in a shopping trip.<br/>
<br/>
My 13yo is a great reuser...  he loves to take apart anything he can get his <br/>
hands on and saves all the parts for someday-inventions.<br/>
