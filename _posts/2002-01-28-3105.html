<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870132717">This has been so true for us with Zak and his Lego Racers Video game.... Yes<br/>
guys I listened to what you all had to say and then I decided to limit it to<br/>
so many hours, or after he&#39;d done other things.  The tantrums (at 6 1/2)<br/>
were like when he was 2.... Hubby and I talked about how this was not<br/>
beneficial to him... So we gave him unlimited access to this program.  He&#39;s<br/>
still playing on it about 6 hours a day.  He told me yesterday &quot;it&#39;s very<br/>
challenging mummy.. I&#39;m going to beat Rocket Racer and get the #1 trophy and<br/>
then I&#39;m going to need Lego Racers 2&quot;... Can you imagine the thrill (being<br/>
sarcastic) I got from realizing that he&#39;s going to move onto another<br/>
computer game.  He is incredible at this game.  I suggested that we might<br/>
ask in our homeschooling group if anyone else plays this and maybe they<br/>
could compete with each other.  He really liked the idea of this, although<br/>
he did say he didn&#39;t think anyone was as good as him as Lego Racers<br/>
(unschooling has certainly continued to give him great self esteem)....<br/>
<br/>
He still goes and does other things... In between Lego Racers yesterday he<br/>
went to the grocery store with hubby, shopped and figured out how much<br/>
things cost.  Played in the Cub House there with other kids for about 45<br/>
mins (hubby took 2 hours to grocery shop!!)...Took a ride on his bike...<br/>
Talked about endless things such as wanting to go roller skating, what are<br/>
resources and where to find them, going to the moon or some other planet,<br/>
why competition is healthy, family dynamics, where&#39;s other grandma and<br/>
grandpa, why do animals look different, reading all the signs in the windows<br/>
on the stores when he went to the video store with daddy, watching DK video<br/>
on Elephants and on and on and on and all interspersed with him asking tons<br/>
of questions.<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s the upshot of all this.... We&#39;ve decided to let him just do what<br/>
he wants when it comes to his Lego Racers... Nobody stops me from reading a<br/>
book or watching 5 hours of TV when I&#39;m feeling burned out and need to veg.<br/>
<br/>
This is still an on-going internal battle for me... However my son doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be having any problems with it.<br/>

*** He tantrums for the TV to be on longer all the time. The more he<br/>
<br/>
watches the more he asks the more he wants.***<br/>
<br/>
Put it on and let it stay on for a full year. No, two years. The reason he<br/>
<br/>
cannot limit himself is because you&#39;re limiting him. There is no way for him<br/>
<br/>
to find his natural patterns if you&#39;re there either demanding or cajoling<br/>
<br/>
him away from the TV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402716698">Mary,<br/>
I once felt as you do.  I fought daily with my boys, 4<br/>
& 5, over the TV.  Then I finally got it.  I left them<br/>
alone.  John (5) can use the remote so he can put on a<br/>
show he likes or his brother likes.  It was hard, for<br/>
me, and at first they watched a lot of tv.  Then they<br/>
started to turn it off.  They found their limit.  It<br/>
is the same with sweets.  I limited food choices for a<br/>
long time.  They decide what they want for breakfast,<br/>
lunch, snacks, and when to eat it.  I usually pick<br/>
dinner, but they can choose something else if they<br/>
want.  We have had days where Alexander (4yo) will<br/>
want only sugary food.  But we have other days where<br/>
he wants only brocoli and carrots w/rice.  He is<br/>
healthy, that is what *really* matters.  <br/>
What it comes down to, for me, is this, when I limit<br/>
them they cannot learn their own limit.  When I let<br/>
them choose, they learn how much they can handle.  Our<br/>
bodies crave the food we need (of course not ALL<br/>
cravings are needs) and how much time we need to do<br/>
certain activities.  Have you ever noticed that when<br/>
you deny yourself a craving, it only increases?  I<br/>
need to read for a while every day, that is my way to<br/>
relax.  My kids at this stage use the tv for that. <br/>
They have huge amounts of energy and need to run<br/>
around a little every day.  I make sure they have a<br/>
safe place to do that.  <br/>
<br/>
So, my suggestion is, let them be.  They will be okay<br/>
and you will feel better without fighting them.  Trust<br/>
is hard, but that is one of the things kids need most<br/>
from their parents.  It is important to remember that<br/>
kids are people with feelings, ideas, and thoughts of<br/>
their own.  Think about how you would feel in their<br/>
position.  Do you like to feel controlled by some one<br/>
else?  Have some one tell you to stop the activity you<br/>
are enjoying?  I don&#39;t.  Neither do my kids.  That<br/>
does not mean that I am not here for them if they want<br/>
suggestions though.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read others responses, but I am sure you<br/>
will get plenty of good advice.  I hope you will<br/>
consider it.<br/>
Namaste,<br/>
