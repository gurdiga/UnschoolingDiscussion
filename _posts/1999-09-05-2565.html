<div id="ygrps-yiv-528567106">I&#39;ve not met any who entirely HS in only one method.  Plus, even those<br/>
who &quot;school at home&quot; finish in a few hours and have time for many other<br/>
pursuits.  We use textbooks as just another book to read (when we get<br/>
them free or practically free at garage sales) and even use workbooks! <br/>
The difference for me is that the kids decide when to do a worksheet and<br/>
quit whenever they want.<br/>

many<br/>
that hs like I do - some unschooling and some curricula.  Do you all<br/>
unschool in this fashion?<br/>
