<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107258273">This is part of an article on a pregnancy epidemic in Canton, Ohio.   I&#39;ll <br/>
comment in another post.<br/>
================================================<br/>
<br/>
Last school year, both high schools in the city&#39;s district reported 55 <br/>
pregnancies. Ninety-nine pregnancies are expected this year, most of them at Timken, <br/>
where expecting students get six weeks of maternity leave.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;This has gotten to horrible proportions. I wish I knew the answer to why <br/>
it&#39;s happening,&quot; principal Kim Redmond told the city&#39;s daily newspaper The <br/>
Repository, which first revealed the pregnancy rate in a column last week. Redmond <br/>
did not return several messages left by The Associated Press.<br/>
<br/>
 Joanne Hinton, whose 16-year-old daughter, Raechel Hinton, is eight months <br/>
pregnant, said she believes the school&#39;s abstinence-based sex education program <br/>
isn&#39;t enough.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;It&#39;s time to take the blinders off and realize that these kids are having <br/>
sex,&quot; she said. &quot;Obviously, abstinence is not working. If we have to, just give <br/>
them condoms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Abstinence-based programs have been growing nationwide at schools over the <br/>
past few years. In Ohio, the Bush&#39;s administration and the state&#39;s health <br/>
department have awarded $32 million in grants to Ohio agencies for abstinence <br/>
education since 2001.<br/>
<br/>
 Hinton stresses that she doesn&#39;t condone teenage sex and that her daughter <br/>
doesn&#39;t fit the mold some may think pregnant teens come from: The Hinton <br/>
household has two loving parents with a strong relationship who asked the straight-A <br/>
Raechel &quot;45 times a week if she was having sex, doing drugs, drinking. We <br/>
were constantly checking on her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Raechel, who plans to return to the 10th grade at Timken after delivering <br/>
and completing an adoption, said many students are sexually active and need more <br/>
information about birth control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420191213"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-If we have to, just give<br/>
&gt; them condoms.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to comment on that, which one of the Ohio moms said to a reporter.<br/>
&quot;If we have to...&quot;<br/>
WHEN!?!   13 % of the girls at that high school are pregnant NOW.   It is too <br/>
late for condoms for those, but the   other 87% should have condoms galore.   <br/>
&quot;Have to&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I have given my boys condoms a couple of times.   I don&#39;t check back to see <br/>
if they still have them.   When they&#39;re going camping with mixed groups, I <br/>
remind them to take them and I don&#39;t ask them if they&#39;re going to need them, I&#39;ve <br/>
said &quot;You might not need them, but someone else might.&quot;   They are there for <br/>
ANYone to use, and that keeps me from having to ask my boys if they need them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; give them condoms.   I think it&#39;s a damned good idea, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby said he didn&#39;t want them (when he was young), and kind of balked <br/>
at the gift, I said &quot;I would hate for the first time you used a condom to be <br/>
the second time you had needed one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When passing through WalMart or Target with my kids, I started going through <br/>
the baby aisle and pausing to note a price or two, on a car seat or stroller.  <br/>
 And I mentioned in friendly fashion to each kid in turn (separate trips) <br/>
that condoms are way cheaper than car seats.    &quot;The birth control aisle,&quot; it has <br/>
come to be called. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t say the price stuff anymore, I just say &quot;Let&#39;s go through the birth <br/>
control aisle&quot; without further comment or pause, or I just go through there and <br/>
one of the kids will say &quot;birth control aisle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is the most serious comment I have on that other article though:<br/>
<br/>
-=-The Hinton<br/>
household has two loving parents with a strong relationship who asked the <br/>
straight-A<br/>
Raechel &quot;45 times a week if she was having sex, doing drugs, drinking. We<br/>
were constantly checking on her.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Asking someone 45 times in a LIFETIME is too much.   Four times a week would <br/>
be too much, and they seemed to be bragging about asking her 45 times a week.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And above that, she must have lied.   Did she lie to her parents 45 times a <br/>
week?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We have a shoe box, in the linen closet.  It holds condoms, has for  years, <br/>
since my older children were in high school.  They know it&#39;s there,  many of <br/>
the teens that have been coming to my house for years know it&#39;s there  too.  I <br/>
never check to see if it&#39;s empty.  I just order more (_www.safesense.com_ <br/>
(http://www.safesense.com)  ), they send me monthly  reminders.  Sometimes when I <br/>
go to reach over my head to put more in the  box, it won&#39;t hold all the newly <br/>
acquired box, so I put those in my room for  another time and skip a month or <br/>
three or more of ordering.<br/>
 <br/>
No embarrassment, no lectures, no knowing looks.  Just safety for them  and <br/>
their friends.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and it didn&#39;t encourage wild promiscuous sex either, as my MIL was  <br/>
absolutely sure it would do.  I don&#39;t think anyone gives PERMISSION for  their <br/>
children to have sex, and I surely don&#39;t think teenagers WAIT for  PERMISSION <br/>
either.<br/>
 <br/>
Just thought I would share that idea as it has worked well for us for many  <br/>
years.  It can be important that you aren&#39;t GIVING condoms to other peoples  <br/>
kids too.  They are there and if the kid takes them, well they took  them.  <br/>
Keeps parents who go crazy about such things from holding you  forever accountable <br/>
for their child have sex.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250021704">Frontline reported on a similar issue in Conyers, GA in 1996.  There<br/>
were 10 cases of syphilis that occurred in teenagers in Conyers.  When<br/>
the nurse asked for the sexual partners of the individuals with<br/>
syphilis they found that there were more than 200 people who had been<br/>
potentially exposed to syphilis. <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/georgia/outbreak/details.html)">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/georgia/outbreak/details.html)</a><br/>
<br/>
The Frontline documentary was fascinating in the clear evidence that<br/>
the increased sexual activity among young, affluent, suburbanite<br/>
children was linked with very little time invested by the children&#39;s<br/>
parents.  If you go down about 3/4 of the page on<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/georgia/interviews/sterk.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/georgia/interviews/sterk.html</a><br/>
there is a clear statement that parents weren&#39;t around and when they<br/>
were--a bit earlier up the page--their children didn&#39;t feel like they<br/>
could talk to them about their sexual activity.  It was interesting to<br/>
see the trade-off that parents were making with both parents working<br/>
long hours (one single mom was even away overnight not infrequently)<br/>
so that they could afford the affluent neighborhood with the good<br/>
schools, but not having any time to spend with their children.  And<br/>
the levels and types of sexual activity found by Claire Sterk from<br/>
Emory University were frightening and degrading and dehumanizing. <br/>
Just awful.<br/>

I hope they were exaggerating, but 45 times a week seems demented.  <br/>
That&#39;s once every 3 or 4 hours!  The only faintly logical explanation I <br/>
can think of is that they wanted to catch her soon enough after her <br/>
first experience that they could give her a morning after pill.  That <br/>
would be nuts, but it&#39;s the only rationale I can think of for constantly <br/>
asking &quot;are you having sex yet?&quot; &quot;what about now?&quot; &quot;now?&quot; &quot;any time soon?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504591722">Hi Sandra,<br/>
  I&#39;m new here and have been reading alot of posts waiting for the right subject & moment, well here it is.<br/>
<br/>
  We are a family with 9 children. One stepdaughter, 3 biological children, and 5 adopted. From an early age I have been openly honest with my kids (to the point of some of them saying &quot;yuck&quot;) about sex, the responsibilities, & consquenses.  My reasons being, my mom never discussed anything with me. When I started my period at an early age I didnt even know what it was !!  All I ever learned about sex was from friends & boyfriends. Didnt even know what birth control was the first time I had sex at a very early age ( long story - low self asteem, no parental communication & a very convincing boyfriend)<br/>
  Needless to say, I had my first child when I was 16.  I love my kids intensely, dont get me wrong, but if I could go back & change the time table I would. Only if nothing else would change though, since I know that can&#39;t happen as all events effect others, I&#39;m not looking for a time machine. My story worked out great- been married since 16 and still going strong. Chose to have a big family, no regrets but some young kids don&#39;t have the luck we did.<br/>
<br/>
  I dont necessarily have resentment at having to grown up really fast & taking on the adult responsibilities that go along with a family, but there are times I would love to have just 48 hrs to go back and be carefree. I say 48hrs because I&#39;d need 24 to have fun and 24 to recoup !!   <br/>
<br/>
  This all leads to the birth control issue, I think condoms should be in classrooms, in bathrooms, in coffee houses, on buses, in libraries,any public place where kids hang - they should be.  I personally gave my boys whole boxes when they were 12 & 13 ( my 12yr old blew them up like balloons, guess he didnt think they&#39;s keep till he was ready :).<br/>
<br/>
  I have 5 adopted children, 4 of which came from parents who didnt know how to take care of them and didnt know what birth control was ( one is 1 of 8, all by the time she was 22 !!! ). Sometimes I think McDonalds should have a teen meal that comes with a condom for the kids whose parents don&#39;t want to talk to them or dont care what they do.<br/>
<br/>
  I took my sons daughter to a dr. for a check up & birthcontrol because her mother didnt give a sh*t about what happened. Her mom looked at it as an addition to her welfare check, not a new life her daughter would be responsible for if she got pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
  So I totally agree, the people who think little Johnny is going to stop in the heat of the moment because his mommy said he should wait, are nuts.  Teaching abstinence(sp?), it doesnt work in most cases. But helping a young adult be informed & give him/her the right equipment to make an intelligent & informed decision - I believe thats the way to go.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool!  Sandra is strewing the birth control aisle! <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
My oldest children are 15 (daughter) and 13 (son) --<br/>
but until recently, I had never considered<br/>
buying/giving my children condoms.  We have talked<br/>
about sex -- about using protection, but I guess I<br/>
always sadly assumed that this was something they<br/>
needed to do for themselves (to obtain the condoms).<br/>
<br/>
So, in June, I witnessed a father purchasing condoms<br/>
for his teenaage son.  Oddly, it really fascinated me.<br/>
 I even wrote about it in my blog.  It was literally<br/>
the first time it ever dawned on me to buy them for my<br/>
kids.  <br/>
<br/>
In regards to the parents who asked their daughter 45<br/>
times a week, I had a girlfriend in high school who&#39;s<br/>
parents were like this.  They tried (what they thought<br/>
was) doing everything and anything -- very strict<br/>
curfew, she was not allowed to have a &quot;steady&quot;<br/>
boyfriend, when going out with a boy it had to be with<br/>
others (in a group), her mom would show up<br/>
occassionally at the places she said she was going to<br/>
check up, and sometimes she had to call her every hour<br/>
on the hour. <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, she was having sex at least once a<br/>
week, probably more, for years, and the main thing she<br/>
learned from everything her parents did was to be a<br/>
better liar.  Her parents still think to this day that<br/>
she was a &quot;good&quot; virgin Catholic girl on her wedding<br/>
day.  LOL....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also think back to my own high school years.  My<br/>
parents educated me about using birth control and told<br/>
me that they would rather I wait until I was older to<br/>
have sex, but if I did, please be safe.  I had a lot<br/>
of friends, who were from religious families, who were<br/>
forbidden to have sex, <br/>

So, in June, I witnessed a father purchasing condoms<br/>
for his teenaage son.  Oddly, it really fascinated me.<br/>
 I even wrote about it in my blog.  It was literally<br/>
the first time it ever dawned on me to buy them for my<br/>
kids.</div>

<br/>
Do you think it¹s a normal part of exploration that is healthy, safe, and<br/>
natural??  Or is it a normal part of exploration that can cause emotional,<br/>
physical, and phsychological damage if the right elements are not there to<br/>
provide safety? (age, maturity, monogamy, whatever)  I think of a toddler in<br/>
an open street situation.  Surely we¹re not going to fall into the camp of<br/>
telling them not to go in the street and expecting them to listen. Period.<br/>
But we are going to provide ongoing contact, communication, and if necessary<br/>
respectful and honest boundaries to keep them safe, all the while explaining<br/>
why this is necessary and being open to the child¹s feedback.<br/>
<br/>
I very much appreciate and understand all the points being made about how<br/>
unrealistic it is to expect teenagers to simply listen to their clueless<br/>
parents demands that they not have sex.  I understand that for kids who are<br/>
having sex condoms are a blessing and should be available to the max!!  But<br/>
isn¹t there a better, more well rounded approach to all this? An approach<br/>
that we, as unschoolers, are perfectly prepared for with our kids, because<br/>
the lines of communication are open and their hearts are trusting towards<br/>
us??<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn¹t we be modelling, demonstrating, commenting, and otherwise strewing<br/>
the idea that sex is amazing, sex is wondrous, sex is for REAL and has real<br/>
and lasting implications for one¹s soul, heart, and body each time (even<br/>
with birth control), and sex is best when it¹s really wanted, desired, and<br/>
when both partners are truly ready??<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only one that believes that monogamy truly is best for our<br/>
species??  Because I truly do believe that - - - and I won¹t shame or judge<br/>
my children for choosing otherwise, but I definitely will give them the<br/>
advantage of learning from the experiences of others before them.  What they<br/>
choose to do with the information is up to them, but I am responsible to<br/>
communicate it an an open, honest and non shaming way.  Otherwise, how will<br/>
they know??<br/>

<br/>
Having condoms available is only a PART of what happens in families that  <br/>
make them so.  All the things you said above are also a part of the  parent/child <br/>
relationship in my home.<br/>
 <br/>
Just because there is a box with dozens available it didn&#39;t mean for them  to <br/>
go and use them with everyone they run in to in this world.<br/>
 <br/>
I think if all those things hadn&#39;t already been discussed openly and a part  <br/>
of the family dynamic, there wouldn&#39;t have been such an openness to dispense  <br/>
condoms freely.<br/>
 <br/>
My children make good decisions (most of the time) and I respect their  right <br/>
to make them.<br/>
 <br/>
I have children in their twenties who have only had sex with two people,  <br/>
both times in committed relationships.  They&#39;ve had condoms available since  they <br/>
were probably 14, maybe younger.  I have a 17 year old who&#39;s known  about the <br/>
condom box since she was probably 10 or younger, she&#39;s thought  seriously and <br/>
even came close she&#39;s said ( I didn&#39;t ask what that meant).   She often <br/>
babysits for a VERY difficult 7 month old and she sees that as a  distinct <br/>
possibility of sex.  Especially since this baby was from a  haphazard relationship and <br/>
neither parent is at all committed to this baby that  is here in this world, <br/>
because of their own interests.<br/>
 <br/>
You can&#39;t assume that those parents who provide real life information and  <br/>
safety precautions such as condoms haven&#39;t been having meaningful talks and life <br/>
 experiences with their children.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t matter what parents think it is if kids are going to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If parents are honest and tell real stories about real people, kids will have <br/>
more real information to help them make decisions.   <br/>
<br/>
If parents voice platitudes and generalities and rules and general <br/>
boogey-scare statements, kids will tune all that out.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can make kids more likely to want attention from others.<br/>
Parents can contribute to a situation in which conversation with people <br/>
outside the family can be more attractive and trusted than that at home.    That&#39;s <br/>
when a boyfriend can become really persuasive, when the girl feels a lack of <br/>
acceptance and trust and love at home.<br/>

If people wait until the children are old enough to reproduce to start <br/>

<br/>
&quot;If necessary respectful and honest boundaries...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you give some examples?<br/>
<br/>
-=-...all the while explaining why this is necessary -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Necessary&quot; is a hot button for me anymore.   <br/>
When a parents says &quot;this is necessary&quot; or &quot;this will keep you safe&quot; or &quot;we <br/>
have no choice,&quot; that might not be a trust-building moment.   If chidlren <br/>
aren&#39;t as equipped to made decisions about interpersonal relationships.<br/>
<br/>
We could probably all tell stories of kids whose movement and freedom of <br/>
choice were severely limited who figuredo ut how to sneak off and have sex.   <br/>
Their motivation changes when they know they only have an hour or half an hour of <br/>
privacy.   And the more rules there are, the more likely kids will get sneaky <br/>
and learn to &quot;stay out of trouble&quot; with words and acting, instead of with <br/>
honest openness and actions.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you still give them condoms?<br/>
<br/>
I have three teens.   One has had sex a little, a couple of years back, and <br/>
extricated himself from the relationship because it didn&#39;t seem right and good. <br/>
  The other two haven&#39;t.   They have friends who have.   If those friends <br/>
needed a condom, my kids would have some.   I don&#39;t know what the other kids&#39; <br/>
parents have said to them or how prepared they are.   I do know that both Kirby <br/>
and Marty are good relationship counsellors, at least in the way of helping <br/>
people clarify their thoughts.   Kirby was 15, I think-maybe 14), when he talked <br/>
an older friend out of a divorce, and helped coach him to making the <br/>
relationship better.   That seemed good evidence to me that Kirby had carefully <br/>
considered all kinds of factors, not just sex, not just &quot;having a relationship&quot; in <br/>
that teen &quot;going out&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my kids have interpersonal skills naturally (a la Howard Gardner&#39;s <br/>
interpersonal intelligence) and that would make it easier to talk to them about <br/>
such things, and easier for them to pick up other clues from all around them.<br/>
<br/>
Would kids with less natural talent for interpersonal factors need more <br/>
rules?   Maybe.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not modelling and demonstrating my sex life to my kids.   They might <br/>
think differently (and might wish they knew less than they know &lt;g&gt;) but open, <br/>
regular discussion of sexuality as it arises in everyday life seems great to me, <br/>
and we&#39;ve always had that here.     <br/>
<br/>
Holly and I discussed bisexuality last week, and specifically the prejudices <br/>
both within and without &quot;the gay community&quot; about the idea that someone could <br/>
be &quot;only partly gay&quot; or &quot;completely gay.&quot;   Prejudices are changing.    There <br/>
have been a couple of teenaged girls of their acquaintance who have both &quot;a <br/>
girlfriend&quot; and a boyfriend.   Some are having sex, others might not be.   We <br/>
talked about the Chinese yin/yang take on relationships, and how that ties in <br/>
with Freud&#39;s take on what &quot;caused&quot; homosexuality in men.   Freud wasn&#39;t <br/>
considering it a genetic reality, just an aberration.   Combining what Freud observed <br/>
with what the Chinese believe (that a good couple needs a balance of male and <br/>
female energy, so the more feminine the female, the more masculine the male; <br/>
the more masculine the female, the more feminine the male, to have the ideal <br/>
balance) and taking genetics into consideration, maybe Freud was onto something, <br/>
with a passive father and dominant mother, but what he was missing was that <br/>
the passive father may himself have had &quot;homosexual tendencies&quot; and that could <br/>
pass down.   Its rough theory, not full-polished FACT, but it was worth <br/>
discussing with Holly and she will for the rest of her life be ready to &quot;connect the <br/>
dots&quot; to every situation she comes across.<br/>
<br/>
Another day she had a fever blister and we discussed herpes virus, and what <br/>
used to be believed, and what the current ideas are, and that things will <br/>
probably change.   I told her that in the 80&#39;s there were dating networks, formal <br/>
and informal, by which people with herpes found people who also had herpes to <br/>
go out with.   Knowledge will change again about what it is and how to treat <br/>
it.   Many things are not known.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to *TELL* Holly things about &quot;alternative sexuality&quot; or herpes and <br/>
tell her as though I knew the final and factual answer, I don&#39;t think that <br/>
would be helpful.   If I were to take a stance that was non-accepting, <br/>
closed-minded and judgmental, that would be about the same as to say &quot;Starting now, just <br/>
ignore me.&quot;   It wouldn&#39;t help her make decisions in the future, or to keep <br/>
an eye out for new research.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t have teens.   Talk to them now, though, and all along, <br/>
as things come up.   And don&#39;t make them come to you to ask for condoms, <br/>
because they probably won&#39;t.   <br/>

This really rings true to me, since in my life I&#39;m chaperoned a lot by<br/>

<br/>
True.<br/>
<br/>
I would estimate that more than half of the parents on this list are<br/>
currently married and monogomous. That&#39;s one way of modeling the idea<br/>
that monogamy is a desirable way of life. (Esp. if one is happy and the<br/>
kids see that. Modeling unhappy monogamy isn&#39;t such a good sales pitch.)<br/>
<br/>
The whole question of lifetime monogamy, and not dating or having sex<br/>
before marriage has become a lot less common in our culture.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be quite happy if my late blooming kid waited until he was 20 to<br/>
have sex, but I&#39;m not going to bet on that. (I&#39;d be happy if he didn&#39;t<br/>
drive until he was 18 also!) But I&#39;m personally not going to expect him<br/>
to wait until marriage to have sex. (I don&#39;t think that my wishes really<br/>
have that powerful an effect on his behavior, truthfully.)<br/>
<br/>
My mom got married in the 50s at age 20 because she didn&#39;t feel she had<br/>
any other safe way to be sexually active. She had two kids and then she<br/>
got divorced. This was hard on everyone. Perhaps if she had had the<br/>
chance to put more time into looking for a &quot;perfect mate&quot; and had the<br/>
chance to mature more before marriage the outcome would have been<br/>
better. At least I think it might have been.<br/>

never lived together and divorced almost as soon as he returned, because though <br/>
she had written him letters about having rented a house and bought furniture <br/>

He married my mom to have sex.   They were together 22 years.<br/>
<br/>
He married another woman, to have sex.   After that ended in the loss of much <br/>
money and the loss of good relationships with me and my sister, during which <br/>
time we were having sex without marriage with people who were NOT using us and <br/>
being verbally abusive as that short-term &quot;step mother&quot; was, my dad, at the <br/>
age of 50-something, decided maybe sex outside of marriage was not as bad as <br/>
marriage-just-to-have-sex.<br/>
<br/>
Those are not the only two choices, I know.   <br/>
His own life had too many examples of a bad use of marriage.<br/>
<br/>
Next he married someone my age, but at least they had had sex for a while <br/>
first, and they made a reasonable trade:   he adopted her children and she took <br/>
care of him while he was ill, and collected benefits from insurance and social <br/>
security for some years.<br/>
<br/>
Advice to wait should be balanced with advice not to make a &quot;lifetime <br/>
commitment&quot; just for the sake of a roll in the sack.<br/>

Our ideas are to answer any questions as they come up. They ask a question, we answer, & if they are satisfied thats usually the end of it, for then, its up to them.  I think when they are ready they will ask for more details.  I believe if they are old enough to ask about specifics they&#39;re old enough to hear it.  <br/>

Some day out of the blue he&#39;ll probally ask you to elaborate, hopefully not in Kmart in front of a 80 yr old woman who almost fainted when one of my kids brought up sex in the checkout line ( he was reading the cover of one of those National Star mags about an alien having sex). She just kept saying &quot;Oh my......... Oh my goodness&quot;. <br/>

<br/>
  At what age do you feel it is appropriate to have open and detailed<br/>
  discussions?  I had a conversation with my 8 year old about a woman&#39;s<br/>
  reproductive cycle and how it takes sperm and an egg to make a baby and all<br/>
  this stemmed out of a question he asked me about birth control pills.  BUT,<br/>
  he never asked me how the sperm gets to the egg.  When is it appropriate to<br/>
  devulge such information?  What if he never actually asks that specific<br/>
  question?  Do I bring it up?  I want to talk to my kids openly about this,<br/>
  but am not sure when the right time is.  I am not sure if I should wait<br/>
  until he asks, or bring it up casually.  What have you guys done?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even before we were unschoolers, we have been a very<br/>
close family, who talked to each other all the time,<br/>
about everything.  For us, sex ed type discussions<br/>
would come up from time to time -- the opportunity<br/>
would present itself -- and we would talk about<br/>
whatever it was.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, when I was pregnant with our last child,<br/>
our older two were 8 and 11...we had LOTS of<br/>
discusssions about how someone gets pregnant, about<br/>
giving birth, about breasts and breastfeeding, etc. <br/>
When watching a movie, or upon hearing about a<br/>
situation with an extended family member, one of the<br/>
kids might have a question.  They might see a<br/>
commercial about a new birth control pill and the<br/>
question is &quot;mom, how does that stop a women from<br/>
getting pregnant?&quot;  Upon finding out that some<br/>
friends/family members are gay, we&#39;ve had discussions<br/>
about homosexuality, Aids (we/they know aids is NOT a<br/>
gay disease, it came up and we talked about it), and<br/>
artificial insemination.  I think we&#39;ve talked about<br/>
almost everything!  Heck, we went to see &quot;The<br/>
40-year-old Virgin&quot; with our teens (we all loved it),<br/>
and a even a few discusssions came up from that.<br/>
<br/>
So, what I&#39;m saying, in our house, we talk so much<br/>
with each other, and our kids feel so comfortable<br/>
asking us any question, that we have never had to<br/>
literally have a sit-down &quot;birds & the bees&quot; type<br/>
talk.  We didn&#39;t have to pick an age.  We didn&#39;t have<br/>
to decide that today is the day!  <br/>
<br/>
And, I just have to add:  just because one of the kids<br/>
have a question about something, it doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
it&#39;s a long, drawn out talk.  I really try to keep it<br/>
informal and follow their lead.  <br/>

signs of puberty, I got a book (one for Kirby and another for Marty later) <br/>
about puberty, and body changes, and reproduction.   <br/>
<br/>
Even if a kid asks how the sperm gets to the egg, that might not be the time <br/>
to talk about TOO much detail.   If you give a brief answer and wait to see if <br/>
he asks more, or if he seems satisfied for the moment, that seems best.   <br/>
Same as with math or spelling or geography. &lt;g&gt;   Don&#39;t assume that one question <br/>
is the ONLY question, and don&#39;t treat one question as an invitation to a <br/>
half-hour-long diatribe.   Let it be a conversation rather than a lesson.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328930665">Well, for me I tried to treat this like any other area of information <br/>
in our unschooling lives. I use all kinds of moments to impart <br/>
information that I think my kid would like to/need to know - and <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily know to ask. I remember asking my dad, after I had <br/>
watched a movie at school about how the sperm fertilizes the egg, how <br/>
the sperm got into the woman to do that. I don&#39;t remember what he <br/>
answered but it was at school that another kid told me about how it <br/>
happens. I was in shock! I decided, as a mom, that this fact was not <br/>
going to be a big surprise to my kid and I would use a &quot;moment&quot; very <br/>
early on to impart this information. I don&#39;t really understand why it <br/>

sex-education issue.   Because prior generations couldn&#39;t talk about it, the <br/>
ignorance was bigger than the knowledge and VERY many people were made unhappy <br/>
by that.   <br/>
<br/>
It might help to rent Kinsey--not to press the kids to watch it, but for the <br/>
moms to watch it, and it might spark a conversation or two whether the kids <br/>

was in the early 20th century, and still is in some families.   <br/>

Joycelyn Elders got fired by President Clinton for talking about  <br/>
masturbation. I&#39;m attaching this essay she wrote because the link no longer  works. <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dreaded M Word It&#39;s Not A  Four-Letter Word <br/>
<br/>
By M. Joycelyn Elders, M.D. former Surgeon  General of the U.S. <br/>
Distributed under Fair use provision of US Copyright  laws<br/>
From: _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nerve.com/Dispatches/Elders/mword/_">http://nerve.com/Dispatches/Elders/mword/_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nerve.com/Dispatches/Elders/mword/)">http://nerve.com/Dispatches/Elders/mword/)</a> <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Masturbation: it&#39;s not a  four-letter word, but the president fired me for <br/>
saying it.  <br/>
In this so-called &quot;communications age,&quot; it remains a sexual taboo of  <br/>
monumental proportions to discuss the safe and universal sexual practice of  <br/>
self-pleasure. No doubt, future generations will be amused at our peculiar  taboo, <br/>
laughing in sociology classes at our backwardness, yet also puzzled by  it given <br/>
our high rates of disease and premature pregnancy. We will look  foolish in <br/>
the light of history.  <br/>
Over the months since I left Washington and settled into my home in Little  <br/>
Rock, I have pondered the rage, embarrassment and shock with which the word  <br/>
&quot;masturbation&quot; is met in our culture. What other word, merely voiced, can  <br/>
provide justification to fire a surgeon general -- or anyone?  <br/>
What horrible betrayal of our proud race does masturbation conjure in our  <br/>
minds? As a physician, and as the nation&#39;s physician, it was important to  <br/>
answer every question posed to me with clear information.  <br/>
Informed decisions require knowledge. To insure the health and well-being  of <br/>
a patient, age-appropriate information must be made available. Some call it  <br/>
candor -- I call it common sense and good medicine. On the other hand,  <br/>
coquetries can be more than deceptive: both the refrain from  self-gratification and <br/>
the concealment of it can result in sexual dysfunction.   <br/>
Yet to study masturbation would be to admit its role in our lives -- one  <br/>
that many of us are not comfortable with. Instead, we discourage the practice  in <br/>
our children, dispensing cautionary tales that read like Steven King  <br/>
novellas. These myths were more understandable before Pasteur enlightened the  world <br/>
to the presence of germs in the 1870s; prior to his discovery, no one  really <br/>
knew where diseases came from. Masturbation was blamed for dreaded  conditions <br/>
like syphilis and gonorrhea, as well as for their ramifications:  dementia, <br/>
blindness and infertility, to name a few. It&#39;s remarkable that some  of these <br/>
rumors still circulate despite clear evidence that they are  unfounded.  <br/>
The wall of myth surrounding self-sex is just beginning to crack -- thanks,  <br/>
in part, to President Clinton who put it in the news. For the first time the  <br/>
topic is being broached on popular television shows, and comedians are able to <br/>
 joke about it without alienating their audiences. You can even find a <br/>
variety  of &quot;how-to&quot; books in the &quot;sex and health&quot; section of most bookstores. The  <br/>
overwhelming majority of psychologists and medical professionals seem to  <br/>
believe that sex-for-one is a natural part of living; we all touch our hair,  <br/>
necks, knees and many other spots on our bodies in public to calm ourselves or  to <br/>
scratch itches, and it is no less acceptable, they assure us, to touch  other <br/>
body parts in private.  <br/>
A friend, a senior citizen, stopped me after church one Sunday and said,  <br/>
&quot;Please tell the children that masturbation won&#39;t hurt them. I spent my entire  <br/>
youth in agony waiting to go blind, because my parents told me that&#39;s what  <br/>
would happen if I masturbated. I guess I could have stopped, but going blind  <br/>
seemed the better option.&quot;  <br/>
We all want to tell our children the truth about their bodies and sex, but  <br/>
many of us are afraid of the consequences. Parents need to let go of the idea  <br/>
that ignorance maintains innocence and begin teaching age-appropriate facts to <br/>
 children. Informed children know what sexual abuse and harassment are, what  <br/>
normal physical closeness with others is, what should be reported, and to  <br/>
whom. Rather than tell children that touching themselves is forbidden, parents  <br/>
may gently explain that this is best done in private.  <br/>
One enlightened friend shared with me the story of how she taught her  <br/>
pre-school-aged daughter about her anatomy: The mother told the girl about her  <br/>
vagina as they examined theirs together with mirrors. There was some  discussion <br/>
and admiration. Later that day, friends came to dinner at their  home, and at <br/>
the dinner table the father asked his daughter what she had done  during the <br/>
day. Of course, she told him the most interesting thing that had  happened: she <br/>
and Mommy looked at their vaginas. But hers was prettier than  her mommy&#39;s -- <br/>
&quot;Want to see?&quot; The stunned dinner guests were silent as the  mother quickly <br/>
retreated with her daughter to explain privacy. It is never  okay to shame <br/>
children for natural inquisitiveness or behavior: that shame  lasts forever.  <br/>
Masturbation, practiced consciously or unconsciously, cultivates in us a  <br/>
humble elegance -- an awareness that we are part of a larger natural system,  the <br/>
passions and rhythms of which live on in us. Sexuality is part of  creation, <br/>
part of our common inheritance, and it reminds us that we are  neither <br/>
inherently better nor worse than our sisters and brothers. Far from  evil, <br/>
masturbation just may render heavenly contentment in those who  dare.<br/>

That article inspired me to make a page on masturbation.   I know lots of <br/>
moms are afraid to discuss it or don&#39;t have any ideas, or have vague concerns <br/>
left over from their own childhoods of too-little or too-wrong information, so <br/>
here:<br/>

I thought of calling it /masturbation, but didn&#39;t.<br/>
I wrestled with the idea, but some people LIKE to find something to be <br/>
disturbed about, and I didn&#39;t want to do them a favor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062220431">What struck me as revolting about that article is, if I recall correctly, <br/>
the mother blames the school&#39;s abstinence-based sex ed program as &quot;not <br/>
working&quot;. While I agree, it apparently is not working, since when does <br/>
sending your kids to school mean that you retain no right to provide  <br/>
information to them beyond what the school condones?<br/>

&gt;I wanted to comment on that, which one of the Ohio moms said to a reporter.<br/>
&gt;&quot;If we have to...&quot;<br/>
&gt;WHEN!?!   13 % of the girls at that high school are pregnant NOW.   It is <br/>
&gt;too<br/>
&gt;late for condoms for those, but the   other 87% should have condoms galore.<br/>
&gt;&quot;Have to&quot;?<br/>
