<div id="ygrps-yiv-231657527">I want to say outright that I love the information and worldview of <br/>
this list. I learned quickly that I&#39;m a novice in the unschooling <br/>
arena and we&#39;ve made dramatic changes this year since <br/>
January. Both my dh and I have felt good about those changes.<br/>
<br/>
But I confess to feelings of anxiety about the future for my oldest. <br/>
Do any of you deal with this? He&#39;s such a free spirit and gifted in <br/>
so many ways. But he definitely isn&#39;t one to play the game or to fit <br/>
into the system. I know his MB scores and though they help me <br/>
to appreciate him as he is, I can&#39;t shake the anxiety I feel at times <br/>
that he will not figure out when or how to jump in when he needs <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
What this looks like now to me is this:<br/>
<br/>
ExamplesÂ—When taking piano lessons, his piano playing <br/>
almost came to a complete halt. It wasn&#39;t until he quit lessons <br/>
that he took off. He plays beautifully and well. In fact, his playing <br/>
is surprisingly accomplished for the little amount of instruction. <br/>
But I wonder if there isn&#39;t a point at which teaching would be <br/>
valuable too. And would he yield to it?<br/>
<br/>
Same with sign language. He&#39;s taken it for a couple of years. He <br/>
loves it. But when tests come, he doesn&#39;t prepare and doesn&#39;t <br/>
care. So he enjoys signing but isn&#39;t that interested in following <br/>
the course of study as it&#39;s set up.<br/>
<br/>
He does great in Shakespeare camp where it&#39;s intensive for one <br/>
week. He puts his whole heart into it and has no trouble <br/>
following through. But it&#39;s one week.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if this kind of spurt personality is one anyone&#39;s <br/>
dealt with (ISFP)? Do these kids just find their own niche without <br/>
ever &quot;joining up&quot; with a system or guide or teacher? It feels so <br/>
scary to me.<br/>
<br/>
He says he wants to go to college but I wonder if he&#39;ll even be <br/>
able to hack it given his bent toward spurt learning. He is <br/>
completely driven by primary relevance. If he doesn&#39;t see the <br/>
point, he doesn&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
into the system. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So how would he have been in school?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times when people look at their unschooled teens, they&#39;re comparing <br/>
them to the ideal, maximum-potential high school kid they might have been in <br/>
parental imagination could create a kid!<br/>

<br/>
When he&#39;s playing, he&#39;s playing.  &#39;Yield&#39; means give way to a stronger force. <br/>
 <br/>
Why not look at it as whether teaching would be so valuable to him he would <br/>
request it?<br/>
Then you could grant it, encourage it, pay for it, support it.  Like a fairy <br/>
godmother, not like an opposing army (or an oncoming truck &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Same with sign language. He&#39;s taken it for a couple of years. He <br/>
<br/>
loves it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s taken it where?<br/>
<br/>
You  mean he has used it in real life?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So he enjoys signing but isn&#39;t that interested in following <br/>
<br/>
the course of study as it&#39;s set up.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Has he used it for real or just &quot;taken it&quot; (like &quot;you sit there and you TAKE <br/>
it&quot;?)  <br/>
Another oncoming force?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Why do you want him in a niche?  Niches are very small and enclosed.  <br/>
<br/>
Learning happens in spurts.  He&#39;s learning.  Or he&#39;s treading class-water.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He says he wants to go to college but I wonder if he&#39;ll even be <br/>
<br/>
able to hack it given his bent toward spurt learning. He is <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
#1 thought is that his unschooling would look WAY better to you if you took <br/>
off your school-colored glasses and looked at HIM instead of college, lessons, <br/>
course, time-measurements, and completions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He is <br/>
<br/>
completely driven by primary relevance. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds good to me!  <br/>
<br/>
Make more things relevant to him, and he&#39;ll be more driven.<br/>
<br/>
Find REAL sign language, and REAL music (not practice for a lesson, but <br/>
playing while others are playing and singing), and go out and do/find/think/care <br/>
Shakespeare the other 51 weeks of the year too.<br/>

and that constitutes one full semester of work.  They tout it as being ideal <br/>
for athletes because they only have one teacher to talk to regarding make up <br/>
work when you are away from school for games but I think it would be great for <br/>
lots of people.   It&#39;s open to anyone I believe.<br/>

I&#39;m a little like that, too.  I can focus hard only for a limited amount of<br/>
time.  Something I&#39;ve noticed about myself and now also my son, too, is that<br/>
at least musically, we don&#39;t seem to lose anything when we go for weeks<br/>
without touching an instrument.  Give us a minute to warm up and we&#39;re<br/>
&quot;back&quot;.  Maybe he knows he just doesn&#39;t need to drudge at something<br/>
constantly to make it happen for himeself.<br/>

(someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong!)  They had evening classes too.  I think the <br/>
whole original idea was that people working full time couldn&#39;t go to school <br/>
during the day to earn their degrees.  So instead of having to take a bunch of <br/>
classes all at once, you could take one course at a time, in the evening, and be <br/>
done with each in a few weeks.  Sounds kinda cool to me.<br/>

Hi, Julie --<br/>
<br/>
My first thoughts -- &quot;This kid should be unschooled!  And do concrete<br/>
projects!  Of his own selection!&quot;<br/>

I think that my husband is an ISFP, and when I can get his attention,<br/>

interested in.  There are lots of different types of colleges.  He might be<br/>
best suited to attend one of the ones that have one class at a time and each<br/>
class is an intensive 3 weeks, with a 1 week break in between each class.<br/>
Or, he might be more inclined to learn on his own and do verbal examination<br/>
testing to get college credit.  I&#39;ve seen a couple of colleges offering<br/>
something like that recently.  Or, maybe he would like to a series of<br/>
mentorships?<br/>

dinner and a deaf church so that he can be with those who use <br/>
sign.<br/>
<br/>
one thing he told me today (I asked him about it) is that he&#39;s <br/>
frustrated with the teaching of the class. (I didn&#39;t know that!) He <br/>
said that it&#39;s not challenging and boring in presentation but he <br/>
loves to sign so he&#39;s put up with their style of teaching anyway.<br/>
<br/>
That surprised me and I felt humbled that I hadn&#39;t already known <br/>
that. It made me understand a little better that he had figured out <br/>
a way to get what he wanted in spite of an obstructionÂ—the <br/>
teaching!<br/>

required. Here I speak three languages and I didn&#39;t even think of <br/>
that for ASL. Smacking self on forehead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my older sons is like this. He is 19 now. He  has always been driven by the current need or interest, learning in spurts - like when he was 13 and was really into playing a military simulation game based on the Chinese Communist revolution. He read all things  China! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this son is now studying at university - but, he is doing university his way, cos he wants to and wants a degree to enter the RAAF as an Officer . He is studying externally ( via distance  ed in the US?) so he can work and mess around with friends and not be constricted by class schedules. He is doing a   Bachelor of General Studies - therefore, he doesn&#39;t have to pick a specific major but does three or four minor streams, following his current interests. Last year, he did some Maths, Physics, Computer Programming units. This semester  he is studying film techniques and criticism  and media  and culture. <br/>
<br/>
So, his learning in spurts  and doing things his way continues through university. Your ds may be the same - if and when he decides college et al is for him...Leonie<br/>

intensive. I think it was three weekends (Fri night, Sat, Sun), skip one, then one more <br/>
weekend and you have one class down. <br/>
<br/>
At the time I thought it was WONDERFUL. In college I was always psyched to <br/>
start, but then got bored about half-way through the semester and goofed off. I <br/>
think this weekend intensive thing was originally for working folks who wanted <br/>
to get a degree on their off-time. It was hugely successful when Ben was <br/>
there---so I guess it&#39;s caught on for all students.<br/>

It would have been a good idea for me, the easily bored.<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to say something positive about the sign language learning<br/>
experience you described.  Most instructors are thrilled to have<br/>
students who are there because of their interest in a subject, not just<br/>
there because they want to get a grade stamped on a piece of paper and<br/>
get out.  Not being motivated by the test and the grade can be a good<br/>
thing.  We don&#39;t have to grant extra respect to people who study hard<br/>
just before the exam and then forget most of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060675457">&quot;But I confess to feelings of anxiety about the future for my oldest.<br/>
Do any of you deal with this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I deal with this with my youngest.  He&#39;s 15 and is not interested in<br/>
learning anything if it looks like a lesson.  He says he wants to go to<br/>
University but won&#39;t participate in anything where there is a &quot;teacher&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What this looks like now to me is this:<br/>
<br/>
ExamplesÂ—When taking piano lessons, his piano playing<br/>
almost came to a complete halt. It wasn&#39;t until he quit lessons<br/>
that he took off. He plays beautifully and well. In fact, his playing<br/>
is surprisingly accomplished for the little amount of instruction.<br/>
But I wonder if there isn&#39;t a point at which teaching would be<br/>
valuable too. And would he yield to it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is my son Jordan with his drumming.  We rented drums and got him<br/>
lessons (at his request).  The drumming tapered off until he stopped<br/>
entirely.  We returned the drums.  Last year he wanted drums for his<br/>
birthday but no lessons.  He says he feels less pressure to drum when the<br/>
drums are his and there are no lessons to practise for.  He drums way more<br/>
often now and jams occasionally with his Dad (guitar player).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He does great in Shakespeare camp where it&#39;s intensive for one<br/>
week. He puts his whole heart into it and has no trouble<br/>
following through. But it&#39;s one week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You are so lucky LOL.  I begged Jordan to go to Shakespeare camp(I just new<br/>
he would enjoy it).  He wouldn&#39;t even apply.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m wondering if this kind of spurt personality is one anyone&#39;s<br/>
dealt with (ISFP)? Do these kids just find their own niche without<br/>
ever &quot;joining up&quot; with a system or guide or teacher? It feels so<br/>
scary to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know Jordan&#39;s MB personality but he sounds like your son.  He learns<br/>
what he wants as he wants to.  He pursues his passions night and day and<br/>
ignores anything &quot;boring&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Any thoughts?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are this.  Left to his own devices Jordan pursues an interest<br/>
until he is satisified or frustrated.  When he reaches a point of<br/>
frustration he will either ask for help or walk away.  (I guess it depends<br/>
on how important it is to him).  What he won&#39;t do is accept help when it&#39;s<br/>
offered if he&#39;s not ready to be helped.  For example: we have been<br/>
encouraging Jordan to come to the office and spend time with his Uncle Brian<br/>
who is a web site designer(among other things).  Jordan has been building<br/>
his own websights for the past few months(nearly a year) and is frustrated<br/>
at many turns.  BUT he won&#39;t go and &quot;take a few lessons&quot; from Uncle Brian.<br/>
HOWEVER last night after a family dinner he started asking Brian questions<br/>
&quot;how do you do this? Is there a short cut to do that? etc.  In that casual<br/>
environment I think he felt less pressure to be the student.  It was guy to<br/>
guy, it lasted over an hour.  I think now he may be ready to &quot;visit&quot; Brian<br/>
at the office to &quot;pick his brain&quot;.  As long as we don&#39;t call it a lesson!<br/>
<br/>
I do see some hope that Jordan will eventually be able to accept<br/>
instruction.  I think we are still (after 3 years) deschooling. Once he<br/>
realizes it is his choice to take a course or not I think he will want to<br/>
make the most of those choices.  I do see a willingness to seek expert<br/>
advice - e.g. he emailed an entymologist he found on the internet to get<br/>
detailed information on ticks.<br/>
<br/>
I think (or should I say I hope) when he realizes that the route to the<br/>
degree he wants is through college or university he will pursue that route<br/>
with the same passion he displays in the rest of his pursuits.<br/>

That really is similar, though he wouldn&#39;t express it that way. I <br/>
just notice that he learns &quot;his way&quot; and doesn&#39;t feel the need to <br/>
be &quot;instructed.&quot; (Noah just turned 16 three days ago)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s amazing. It really must be a personality thing. My dad was <br/>
asking who he prepares to play for if he doesn&#39;t have recitals to <br/>
prepare for etc. I laughed. I said &quot;He plays for himself. He needs <br/>
no audience whatsoever. It&#39;s all about the pleasure of playing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps that is part of it. He really enjoys the experience <br/>
more than the external achievement.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right. That&#39;s him to a tee. Fortunately he&#39;s had a huge diversity of <br/>
passions and I&#39;ve watched him learn over and over things I&#39;d <br/>
never even have attempted so I&#39;m glad he hasn&#39;t had that <br/>

keeps finding his own way.<br/>
<br/>
For example: we have been<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; who is a web site designer(among other things).  Jordan has <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is my sonw tih Visual Basic. In fact, my husband (who is <br/>
good with computers and the Internet) has offered repeatedly to <br/>
teach my son more about websites (which my son already <br/>
knows a good deal about) because my husband keeps thinking <br/>
that with the &quot;right skills&quot; Noah could earn money (good money) <br/>
during college doing websites for people.<br/>
<br/>
Not interested.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to build games. So he&#39;s joined an Internet community <br/>
of young adults and he learns everything from them. I had <br/>
thought he&#39;d quit working on it (because he got so frustrated last <br/>
year and stopped) but just found out he&#39;s broken through and <br/>
has been putting in 1-2 hours a day on his laptop at night. In fact, <br/>
he got so good, he wrote his own tutorial to share with others to <br/>
help them avoid the block that he experienced for six months. <br/>
Cracked me up!<br/>
<br/>
He loves computer tutorials because they lend themselves to <br/>
self-teaching.<br/>
<br/>
BUT he won&#39;t go and &quot;take a few lessons&quot; from Uncle Brian.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HOWEVER last night after a family dinner he started asking <br/>

<br/>
LOL! I think I&#39;m getting the idea. I have to stop even thinking in <br/>
school language.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve only ever done homeschool but we&#39;ve only been at <br/>
unschooling in earnest for six months. So I guess I need to see <br/>
this period as deschooling. That helps.<br/>
<br/>
Once he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; realizes it is his choice to take a course or not I think he will <br/>
 </span></blockquote>want to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; make the most of those choices.  I do see a willingness to <br/>

experts who can be a resource to him.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with the same passion he displays in the rest of his pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve pegged my hopes. But it&#39;s also good for me to note that <br/>
he may do a non-traditional college route. The one school we&#39;re <br/>
looking at has a small computer science department. As a <br/>
result, the students do numerous Independent Study projects <br/>
that are overseen by professors. When I explained this Noah, he <br/>
lit up! Cool, he said. Then I don&#39;t ahve to go to class but I can <br/>
work on what I really want to know.<br/>
<br/>
I had forgotten this conversation until your comments reminded <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I think I had an end-of-the-year freak out. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Stella. I wish Jordan and Noah could meet! They sound <br/>
so similar.<br/>
