<div id="ygrps-yiv-733755310">Hello, Linda<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in?  Have you looked up the laws for your state at NHEN?<br/>
<br/>
I would, however, be real cautious when discussing anything with someone who<br/>
works for CPS, be they a friend or not.  Sometimes folks who do certain jobs<br/>
become consumed by the job.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done work with families that have had dealings with CPS and found that<br/>
polite but firm and confidant work best.  As does burying them in paper &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Antagonizm and fear seem to fuel their zeal.<br/>
<br/>
I would find out all the laws and have everything lined up in advance so<br/>
that there can be no way to question your choice or what you are doing.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi, I am planning on homeschooling my 10 yr special needs son<br/>
&gt; this fall. He needs some routine and structure, but not the sit at<br/>
&gt; his desk and do worksheets all day. I do want some though. I would<br/>
&gt; like to work moree in areas he enjoys to keep his interest. If any<br/>
&gt; one has any favorite sites you would like to share I would sure<br/>
&gt; appreciate it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I have been told by a friend, (cps worker) that I should count<br/>
&gt; on being turned in since he is special needs. She said she would<br/>
&gt; be the one sent and just keep good records. My question is has any<br/>
&gt; one been turned into CPS for homeschooling? and what kind of records<br/>
&gt; should I keep. There are no specifics here that I have been told<br/>
&gt; or read, just have to have 180 days of school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Linda </span></blockquote></div>
