<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352428411">I have just had an ah ha moment this week. I love these :)<br/>
<br/>
I have been binging on Holt books, unschooling lists and stimulating <br/>
conversation this last week. This list has provided some great <br/>
shifts in my thinking lately. I *thought* I have had a good idea on <br/>
what &quot;unschooling&quot; means. Well I don&#39;t think I ever really *GOT* it <br/>
before this last week. I have read a ton, I have listened to other <br/>
unschoolers talk, and I have understood in *theory* what it is. Well <br/>
I have been missing some BIG points. Mainly, that is is hugely a <br/>
continuation on what attachment parenting or gentle parenting is. <br/>
<br/>
I have admittedly fallen off the wagon of &quot;gentle parenting&quot; by my <br/>
own standards since my ds has been born. My patience has suffered, <br/>
my kindness has been lacking, and I have become the monster mommy at <br/>
times that I swore I would NEVER be. I don&#39;t know how or when this <br/>
happened, but I&#39;ve dissapointed my self with barking orders and go <br/>
to bed feeling so unhappy. I really needed this list to kind of kick <br/>
my but kindly back to the way I had been...a more mindful parent.<br/>
<br/>
Chloe (4)and I have really spent some quality time together the last <br/>
couple of nights especially and she actually shared with me lots of <br/>
her feelings which we haven&#39;t shared since my son was born. I really <br/>
have felt that she has been distant from me. We always have gotten <br/>
along so well and really truely enjoyed each others company. For <br/>
example, she will never tell me what she does when she is away from <br/>
me. She never wants to tell me or show me what she has &quot;learned&quot; at <br/>
gymnastics or ballet. Last night she stayed up really late with me <br/>
and she just shared so much with me. This last year we have been <br/>
like enemies at times, always working against eachother or taking <br/>
opposite views more often then not. I feel like our relationship had <br/>
started to progress into what my own mother and I were/ are like <br/>
very antagonizing to eachother; my mom and I are very close on an <br/>
intellectual level, but VERY distant on an emotional level.<br/>
<br/>
Someone had mentioned that the breaking down of the posts are <br/>
beneficial mostly for the silent list members and not always as <br/>
helpful to the original poster. I think you got that right! I have <br/>
been like a sponge this last week and it feels GREAT.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Ticia</div>

Ticia, I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve had some good ah ha moments.  I like to say I view <br/>
life through unschooling lenses, and darn it, I outgrow those lenses alot and <br/>
have to change them!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I quit reading and get off the lists for a bit, practice what I&#39;ve <br/>
been learning.  Sometimes I can&#39;t get enough reading.<br/>
<br/>
I do know when things aren&#39;t working, a super dose of togetherness does the <br/>
trick.  My favorite thing to do right now is to find an empty park (no <br/>
distractions) and just PLAY with my kids.  They love it and I feel great about being a <br/>
parent again.<br/>
<br/>
Happy reading!<br/>
Leslie<br/>
