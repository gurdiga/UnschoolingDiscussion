The jumping off the cliff has already taken place. Now it&#39;s the free fall<br/>
that causes the unrest, the worry, &quot;What do I do for my kid?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;easing&quot; is what we might do to make the fall less frightening. She<br/>
already overcame the fear of falling.<br/>
<br/>
Now she&#39;s worried about the landing.......  :^)<br/>

Happy Landing<br/>

PS   My post was trying to say -- after giving examples of real world<br/>
conditions that children might examine -- that your child&#39;s curiosity is<br/>
what matters. If you turn every subject (such as store shelves) into a<br/>
&quot;teaching moment&quot;  you might make the fall less enjoyable.</div>
