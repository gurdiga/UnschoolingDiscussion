those games and enjoying them.  They do look like fun, but we&#39;ve also come<br/>
across a few of the *demos* that are broken.  Made me think that it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be too long before it was broken in my own home if I bought one...so far it<br/>
hasn&#39;t made us want to part with $20 that could go towards a game my kids<br/>
KNOW they would love.<br/>

Yeah, but I already know that I love Break Out.<br/>
 <br/>
Then again, I did buy Tretris for PS2 before my trip and I have hardly  <br/>
played it....so maybe I&#39;ll just skip Break Out, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320439088">So I&#39;m doing that now.<br/>
Hi, everyone.<br/>
I&#39;m Julie and live in Arkansas.Those of you who were on the old HEM AOL <br/>
boards might remember me as HSOK1.<br/>
Married to Jim, mom of Josh (12), special human to 3 dogs (Rosie, Dixie, <br/>
Fang) and Human Slave Monkey to 5 cats (Alley Cat, Nico, Storm, Mr. <br/>
Killer Kitty, and General Boo Boo Kitty **** (if you like Kevin Smith <br/>
you&#39;ll get the end of his name) and until recently Ed Wood who seems to <br/>
have gone AWOL~sob~)  see them all here:<br/>

<br/>
I wait tables part-time and spend way to much time on LiveJournal and <br/>
reading Harry Potter (specifically Snape, I could care less about that <br/>
annoy Harry) fanfiction. I think we&#39;ve already discussed my embarrassing <br/>
obsession with Neil Gaiman.<br/>
<br/>
Josh has always been homeschooled.<br/>
 I always ment to unschool, just not brave enough or maybe too lazy.<br/>
 We&#39;ve been relaxed, eclectic. even school at homeish, but never really <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
For the last two years we have actually been &quot;public&quot; school attendees <br/>
since we were involved in one of those virtual school using K12. Lots of <br/>
reasons but mostly it made dh happy and Josh was receiving services <br/>
(reading help) at our local school. Last year the special ed class (and <br/>
he did go from not being able to read to being able to struggle through <br/>
Captain Underpants) was something he enjoyed, for the most part, to <br/>
attend. This year as he said &quot;it sucks&quot;. So he stopped.<br/>
I wanted to stop K12. Ugh.<br/>
But, and this is silly, we had that extra computer now that you got with <br/>
enrollment and, well, I don&#39;t share well so we couldn&#39;t quit until we <br/>
scrapped up the cash to get ds his own computer. Lucky for us a friend&#39;s <br/>
hubby is a &quot;computer guy&quot; had a really nice (nicer then mine) machine he <br/>
wanted to get out of the house (he bought it for work, used it as a <br/>
server, but has a different setup now) and sold it cheap along with a 20 <br/>
inch monitor. Josh will be stoked when he comes back from Kentucky <br/>
tonight and sees this huge ass monitor. His BattleField 1942 plays on <br/>
it. All will be well with the world.<br/>
<br/>
When I told ds that we were quitting the virtual school his 1st question <br/>
was:<br/>
&quot;Can I unschool now?&quot;<br/>
Well thats pretty direct and honest.<br/>
 So of course I said yes.<br/>
And of course I will drive myself crazy worrying about math and reading. <br/>
Now with reading we can get into the whole question if the &quot;schooling&quot; <br/>
causes the learning disability or if the ld is organic and he will <br/>
always have a problem with reading. My dh can read but only does for <br/>
information. It does not come easy to him so he does not read for <br/>
pleasure. You have to understand that I&#39;m always the one telling <br/>
everyone else to lighten up with their kids, to give let them choose <br/>
what to to...but really it in a more eclectic homeschooling vein. Not <br/>
what I perceive as pure unschooling. It never has seemed to hard me to <br/>
give a kid the lead when they are reading well, but I do struggle with <br/>
the whole &quot;late, late reader&quot; issue when mine is one of them. It was <br/>
easy when he was 8, 9, even 10. It has gotten a lot harder at 12 (almost <br/>
13).<br/>
But the truth is he&#39;s never wanted to read, has never cared, and I <br/>
wonder if I&#39;ve done damage that can never be undone by pushing it for <br/>
sooooo long and trying so many different reading programs and therapies.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry that he&#39;ll play video games all day or watch tv. He <br/>
already has that freedom and moves form thing to thing in a day and if <br/>
he&#39;s playing Fable he is at least trying to read stuff. If he&#39;s online <br/>
he is figuring out how to work his way around and following along as his <br/>
screen reader reads websites to him. Josh has a program that will spell <br/>
and do word prediction for him if wants to write. He really likes that <br/>
talking Franklin spelling/dictionary thingee. We are stocked up on the <br/>
assitive technologies around here.<br/>
<br/>
How long to &quot;deschool&quot;?<br/>
Well we&#39;ve been &quot;homeschooling&quot; since he was 4 so that&#39;s almost a whole <br/>
year&#39;s worth of time to get rid of the old and embrace the new.<br/>
I just hope MY resolve can last that long.<br/>
<br/>

It will be hard now to know what did damage, though, since he had <br/>
professional remediation (yuck).<br/>

<br/>
Well, for the parents it&#39;s worse--one month per year they were in school <br/>
(plus maybe a month per year they were convinced they were their children&#39;s only <br/>
teachers).<br/>
