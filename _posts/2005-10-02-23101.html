No thanks.<br/>

Thoughts are actually brain activity.   They can cause temporary biochemical <br/>
changes for good or bad within the person who thinks them. You can cheer <br/>
yourself up with thoughts.   You can make yourself feel bad with thoughts.   You <br/>
can think of ways to make someone else&#39;s life better, but if that involves <br/>
keeping them from thinking their own thoughts, there is some ugly-shape-making <br/>
energy there.<br/>
<br/>
Some people love to think they could bend spoons with thoughts or remind a <br/>
husband to get butter when he&#39;s at the store without a phone and she forgot to <br/>
put it on the list.    <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s let that be a whole separate topic on a whole different list, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Those who believe that television and noise will create violence in their <br/>
children will act on that belief, I suppose.    Those who believe that respect <br/>
and freedom and choices will create independence, curiosity and all kinds of <br/>
learning in their children and who have years of experience and evidence will <br/>
probably continue to act on that, and continue to discuss it with other <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-276308305">I&#39;ve seen &quot;What the Bleep&quot; and own some of Emoto&#39;s books. As with most<br/>
things in my life, unless I have experienced the proposed &quot;truth&quot; in my own<br/>
life, it is just another possibility. There are potential holes in most of<br/>
his work, and yet it still may be true. Who knows? But I&#39;m not about to<br/>
control my kids&#39; lives on this possibility. They actually choose to believe<br/>
in Emoto&#39;s water/word work, and have talked about it a whole lot. I&#39;m glad<br/>
they had the freedom to do so.<br/>
<br/>
As far as TV watching goes, I watch sometimes till I don&#39;t feel well. I<br/>
watch sometimes for just a few minutes, cuz something else is more<br/>
interesting or pressing. Lots of times I don&#39;t watch at all. I don&#39;t like to<br/>
watch &quot;disturbing&quot; sex or violence, and I usually don&#39;t. I had to see all of<br/>
it to know what works for me and what doesn&#39;t. Same for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Three teenagers and one 11 yo later, they vary greatly in what they like to<br/>
watch, and each know what they like and what they don&#39;t because they had the<br/>
opportunity to see whatever they wanted. Two watch mucho violent movies<br/>
every now and then, one doesn&#39;t watch that stuff at all (finds it boring<br/>
actually), and one is still figuring it out. NONE of them are violent, or<br/>
even mean to each other.<br/>
<br/>
No rules. No punishments. Just mutual respect and lots of conversations. And<br/>
lots of light, laughter and fun.<br/>
<br/>
My kids WANT to feel balanced and healthy. They make choices to make them<br/>
feel that way. They couldn&#39;t know how to make those choices if I did it for<br/>
them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Masaru Emoto.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a good article on him at Wikipedia:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Emoto">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Emoto</a><br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t even claim to do scientific experiments and hasn&#39;t  <br/>
submitted any of his work for peer reviewed journals.<br/>
<br/>
To get the photos of the crystals he has his photographers search  <br/>
through the crystals produced around the word in the bottle for  <br/>
crystals that look like the effect he wants. In other words the  <br/>
photographers know they&#39;re looking for ugly crystals around &quot;Hitler&quot;  <br/>
and beautiful crystals around &quot;love&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Until double-blind experiments are done (where those cataloging the  <br/>
crystals have no idea what word they formed around) and the results  <br/>
are reproduced by other scientists it&#39;s no more than a nifty idea for  <br/>
a fantasy novel.<br/>
