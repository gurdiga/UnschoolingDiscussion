&lt;&lt; It&#39;s really not, it&#39;s about doing things that are pleasing to me family.  <br/>
They are special guests in my life.  If there are things they enjoy and I can <br/>
do, I do it.<br/>
<br/>
If one night I get hurried and forget the linen spray, then I will get a <br/>
person sneaking into my room asking WHY I forgot the linen spray, that their <br/>
pillow doesn&#39;t &quot;smell&quot; like mommy&#39;s been there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do it because I personally like it, I wouldn&#39;t bother at all.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You contradicted yourself.  Either you do those things because you really <br/>
want to, or you &quot;don&#39;t do it because you personally like it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re sure why you do it.<br/>
<br/>
If you like doing it, then by all means keep on doing it.  It has nothing to <br/>
do with unschooling, though, so it you just want to document your life in all <br/>
its contradictory glory, please don&#39;t fill this list up with it.<br/>

&gt; want to, or you &quot;don&#39;t do it because you personally like it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To clarify myself,  &quot;I don&#39;t do it because I personally like it, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
bother at all&quot; means simply that it really doesn&#39;t help me at all for her <br/>
pillow to smell nice, I do it simply because she enjoys it and because it&#39;s <br/>
an easy thing to do for her.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t lay in her bed, I don&#39;t sniff her pillow, it doesn&#39;t benefit me that <br/>
it smells nice in any way other than she likes for me to do it for her.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I am not seeing how it is contradictory, to say her pillow <br/>
smelling nice isn&#39;t to please me, but because she likes it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to tell me exactly how it is contradictory to say personally the <br/>
scent of her pillow affects me in no way except that she likes it, I am <br/>
listening, willing to try to learn from your post.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not the pillow spraying that benefits you, Glena; it&#39;s the *good will* <br/>
generated by your actions.  Can you see that? *That&#39;s* how it is for <br/>
you.  Otherwise, you could give her the spray and let her do it herself. <br/>
But, it&#39;s okay to do stuff to generate good will; it&#39;s just something to be <br/>
aware of and honest with yourself about.  The reason being that there are <br/>
other things that can come up and it will be helpful for you to ask <br/>
yourself the questions and see yourself and your motives (no bad <br/>
connotation here, everyone has motives, you eat because you&#39;re motivated to <br/>
live) and make choices based on that *understanding* of yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that sheds a little light.<br/>

No, Glena.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to tell you exactly again and again what I&#39;ve already been <br/>
trying to say<br/>
and I don&#39;t want you to tell me exactly again and again (nor EVER again) how <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954355652">Oh my.  You know, I think the best we can do for you is not say a damn word. <br/>
  Why should anyone tell you exactly anything?  It doesn&#39;t help you to <br/>
understand, doesn&#39;t prevent you from repeating yourself, yet again, and then <br/>
you start picking away at things that have nothing, and I mean NOTHING to do <br/>
with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You can beat a dead horse, but sooner or later it won&#39;t even look like a <br/>
horse so you forget why the hell you are there in the first place.<br/>

I&#39;m beginning to think the same thing.  I think someone needs a lot <br/>
of attention, and enjoys stirring things up on a list with over a <br/>
thousand people so that everyone can read hundreds of posts all about <br/>
what a good mother she thinks she is and how no one understands her.  <br/>
I&#39;d feeling so naseated at this point.<br/>

<br/>
Glena,<br/>
<br/>
I think what you are doing is just digging yourself in deeper with each attempt at explaining yourself.  You do not need to explain every detail of everything.  We do get it.  You need to stop posting and just listen.<br/>
