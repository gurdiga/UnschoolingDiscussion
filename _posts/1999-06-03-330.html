<div id="ygrps-yiv-515481619">I&#39;m also new to this list and will introduce myself better and more<br/>
thoroughly as soon as I get a chance.  I&#39;m really enjoying all the posts<br/>
I&#39;ve had to read in the last two days.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say to Denise that I live in St. Charles, IL just &quot;up the<br/>
river&quot; from Geneva.  It is a small world!  There is quite a large homeschool<br/>
community here in Illinois and in this area in particular.  I&#39;ve even met a<br/>
number of unschoolers.  My daughters are 5 1/2 and almost 2.  We haven&#39;t<br/>
started to participate in any of the homeschooling activities through any of<br/>
the groups but do meet hsers everywhere!LOL    My oldest, Sarah, gets asked<br/>
her age alot and when she says she&#39;s 5 she is then asked if she&#39;s in<br/>
Kindergarten.  She then says &quot;no&quot; and then her questioner says, &quot;oh you&#39;ll<br/>
go next fall?&quot;  Then she says &quot;no I don&#39;t go to school.&quot;  That usually<br/>
produces a confused look on their face!  She has started answering with the<br/>
fact that she homeschools.<br/>
<br/>
I know I have questions to ask and comments to make but I&#39;m still<br/>
semi-lurking until I get all my ducks in a row!  I&#39;m really enjoying the<br/>
discussions so far.<br/>
