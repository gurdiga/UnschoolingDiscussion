<div id="ygrps-yiv-238226780">Thomas Armstrong wrote &quot;In Their Own Way&quot; and &quot;Seven Kinds of Smart&quot; which <br/>
present the practical use of the theory of multiple intelligences for <br/>
parents. The books are based on the research work of Howard Gardner, <br/>
especially as presented in his book &quot;Frames of Mind&quot;. Martin Gardner is the <br/>
author of numerous books of mathematical puzzles and other interesting <br/>
subjects, not including multiple intelligences.  <br/>

**I think the author is Martin Gardner, or Gardener. HeÂ’s written several<br/>
<br/>
books on that.**<br/>

**Also,  have you read the book - can&#39;t think of the name - on seven types of<br/>
<br/>
intelligence?  Somebody here will know it - focus on her strengths,  believe<br/>
<br/>
in her....and let her know.    And try to let go of *your* goals for her.**</div>
