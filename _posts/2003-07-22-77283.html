Have you ever seen a big cat get irritated with the antics of their youngun&#39;s? They can smack fairly hard. It&#39;s certainly not a repeated thing, like a spanking would be. But large cats (cats of any kind actually) will put their little ones in place with a good pop once in a while. I had a friend that owned big cats (cougars) so I got some up close and personal time there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with human behavior though. We are hopefully more able to reason and use more tools than a Tiger!<br/>
It just all seems so obvious to me, that hitting is not an acceptable form of problem solving. We work at helping our kids gain tools so they don&#39;t hit each other, we don&#39;t accept adults hitting as normal behavior, why would it be ok for parents to hit children? <br/>
<br/>
I like to think about it in adults terms. If Oom/Chris had been doing something her dh didn&#39;t like and he smacked her in front of a bunch of people that cheered, just how would THAT have felt?<br/>
Humiliating?<br/>
Destructive?<br/>
Of course!<br/>
And if the child&#39;s pants prevented any pain, then how did the hit have ANYTHING to do with the intended results (to stop him)? If it was only the humiliation, I guess the hit still didn&#39;t have to happen. And if humiliation is how you want to stop your child from doing dangerous things then you aren&#39;t going to get support for that here either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415998793">Hi Ren!<br/>
<br/>
Having been raised on a horse farm, I can attest to mares using quite <br/>
a bit of physical aggression with colts that get out of hand. Not <br/>
always pretty! Of course if my child had big hooves and lots of big <br/>
teeth set in a strong jaw, I may be apt to putting a stop to his <br/>
kicking and biting the horse way had I been a horse! lol! I&#39;ve seen <br/>
chimps and other apes, wolves too discipline with what I&#39;d call a <br/>
fairly violent reprimand.<br/>
<br/>
These animals don&#39;t have the gift of speech though so all is conveyed <br/>
via touch and body language. It causes me to often wonder that what <br/>
appears violent to humans is not so with other species. I may see a <br/>
mare&#39;s approach to her young as violent as a human, but is it really <br/>
in the world of horses? So interesting!<br/>
<br/>
Great post!<br/>
Jeva <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought about this too.  And dogs do the same things with thier puppies.  <br/>
They will snap at them, bite them, growl at them to deter unwanted behavior.   <br/>
I am not suggesting that we behave like animals.   But, I do not think the <br/>
comparison is unfounded. <br/>

think we can compare human and animal parenting instincts<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947573656">It&#39;s instinctive for almost all animals to bite/kick when hurt or cornered. <br/>
Fight or flight.<br/>
<br/>
Parental disciplining in the animal world is not done with teeth or claws or <br/>
hooves---their weapons. It&#39;s done with voice and body language (their main <br/>
means of communication)---and often includes touch.<br/>
<br/>
Human hands ARE our weapons. And our brains are too. <br/>
<br/>
Mares and foals (colts are just the males---and then we get into that whole <br/>
&quot;bad boy&quot; thang again! &lt;g&gt;)----I have never seen a mare actually bite or kick a <br/>
foal in anger. Other horses, yes---but never her foal. If she&#39;d disciplining, <br/>
she might &quot;bite&quot; with lips, not teeth, but usually body language will keep <br/>
the foal in line. She&#39;ll kick &quot;at&quot; a foal, but I&#39;ve never seen a mare actually <br/>
connect on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen apes to horrendous things to each other, but never a mom to her own <br/>
healthy infant.<br/>
<br/>
Big cats? That swat would level me or you, but the cub might just tumble. If <br/>
she &quot;wanted&quot; to inflict pain, she certainly *could*. She doesn&#39;t. What would <br/>
she gain?<br/>
<br/>
A bitch will &quot;pin&quot; a puppy to the ground or bite *at* him, but she won&#39;t bite <br/>
him. Hers are teeth than could literally rip the flesh right off that puppy, <br/>
but she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of violence in the animal world, but not to one&#39;s own infant.<br/>
<br/>
Humans are different. Not only do we have MANY more means at our disposal to <br/>
be kind and gentle, we think of some of the *most* horrible punishments and <br/>
pains to inflict on innocent bodies. Spankings, whippings, drinking out of the <br/>
toilet (I&#39;m so sorry, Dar!), burning little fingers, shaming, humiliating, <br/>
groundings,.... It&#39;s impossible to justify.<br/>
<br/>
Animals have limited means, yet they peacefully and gently parent their <br/>
young. There is NO instinct to harm the young of any species. The instinct to to <br/>
NOT harm---that&#39;s why infants are not &quot;adult-like&quot; in apprearance, but <br/>
&quot;infantile&quot;. So they WON&#39;T get hurt, by their mothers or other adults.<br/>
