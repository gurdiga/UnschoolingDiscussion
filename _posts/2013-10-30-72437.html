<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163083450">Last year I had a fundraiser in the fall.  This year, no energy for it, but next year, probably! <br/>
<br/>
This year, I have two expenses totally about $250 that seem good to share.  <br/>
I&#39;m just asking once, and quietly.  For those for whom money is tight, but who might end up with an extra Christmas card, my address is there, and I do love Christmas cards!<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
