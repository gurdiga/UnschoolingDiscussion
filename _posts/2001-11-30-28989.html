Yes, we still read to her. She owns lots of books on tape(handed down from older sister). Here is an example of her writing: <br/>

I could read your daughter&#39;s writing.  She is communicating.  Invented<br/>

I might just listen to you because after sending in a sample of the writing, I&#39;m getting the strong impression from several of you that dd&#39;s not doing so bad and my fears are premature at best.<br/>

<br/>
Just a quick thought: if your daughter were growing up in, for example,<br/>
Spain (Im picking that country because Ive lived there), would she have<br/>
any difficulty learning to read or write?<br/>
<br/>
English is one of the least phonetically consistent languages on Earth<br/>
(among those that have a phonetic alphabet, as opposed to an ideographic one<br/>
like Chinese). Spanish is one of the most phonetically consistent.<br/>
<br/>
Ive never heard of anyone doing this, but what if you got her some contact<br/>
with somebody fluent in Spanish (preferably a native speaker) so that she<br/>
could see that her problems are partly due to the simple accident of her<br/>
birthplace?<br/>
<br/>
If she could learn to read and write correctly in Spanish (even just on a<br/>
basic level) maybe the experience of reading fluently or of other people<br/>
reading her notes with no problems at all would give her some sort of<br/>
confidence in her ability to learn to read and write in English.<br/>
<br/>
If youre interested, I once developed a method of learning foreign<br/>
languages that I use when I want to start learning a new one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5319921">Well, I talked to her about it last night and offered to take her to<br/>
somebody who might be able to help us find a way to make reading easier for<br/>
her. She declined my offer but went on to find a book (I&#39;d guess about a<br/>
level 3 if it were rated), read it... struggle with some words but<br/>
*refused*to let me help her with them . There were some looooooong pauses<br/>
but she would eventually figure out the word (sounding out phoneticly).<br/>
These pauses were unbelievably long and made me uncomfortable. I realized<br/>
that *part* of our problem is I&#39;m impatient. I see her struggling so I jump<br/>
in and tell her the word. She doesn&#39;t like this *at all*.<br/>
Anyway, I believe she does have a learning problem of some sort. Dyslexia?<br/>
Who knows... I&#39;d catagorize her problem as mild, though because she *is*<br/>
able to process some of the written word.<br/>
More than that, though, I think *I* could be her biggest obstacle because of<br/>
my rush-rush personality which doesn&#39;t allow her the time she needs to<br/>
figure things out.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have come to this conclusion so quickly had it not been for all<br/>
or your posts on this list, throwing out suggestions and ideas.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if we&#39;ll ever make it to a therapist or if she&#39;ll scoot along on her<br/>
own but I feel better about seeing a clearer picture right here under my own<br/>
nose.<br/>
Thanks everybody,<br/>

that.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok.  Shud is pretty phonetic.  She&#39;s probably seen where enough times to <br/>
get it mixed up with wear.  That&#39;s a hard word to spell <br/>
phonetically.  Obviously she doesn&#39;t yet know that eye is spelled <br/>
differently than I.  Shadoe seems a pretty good phonetic <br/>
approximation.  Earrings is a hard one unless you know ear.  And maybe she <br/>
pronounces it engs rather than ings.  Short vowels seem to be really hard <br/>
to differentiate for some kids.  I&#39;m not going to go through the whole <br/>
thing, but she seems to be getting at least some of the phonics.  If you <br/>
think she needs more work in that area and she *wants* to, you might try <br/>
the book I recommended, The Road to Reading.  (I remember it was a pretty <br/>
rigid program, with both reading and writing.  I only followed it loosely <br/>
with Lars.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Does that give you an idea of where she is? If not, I&#39;ll try harder to <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Writing is a whole different skill than reading, though it can give you a <br/>
clue whether they&#39;ve got the phonics.  What kind of words does she stumble <br/>
on when she reads?  Do you see any pattern?  Another thing to think about <br/>
is that reading out loud is a very different skill from reading <br/>
silently.  You might suggest that she read to herself and just show you or <br/>
spell out any words she can&#39;t read on her own.  If you do this, *don&#39;t* <br/>
then tell her to sound it out.  Just tell her the word.  If she seems <br/>
willing, you might tell her some of the other words in the same family, <br/>
like all, call, wall, ball, etc., but stop if you get any signals that the <br/>
info isn&#39;t wanted then.  She mostly just needs to focus on what she&#39;s <br/>
reading at the time.<br/>

<br/>
1.  Do some research of your own.  Understanding the problem may help <br/>
you help her address it.  There are things that dyslexics can try <br/>
that really help some.<br/>
<br/>
2.  This is anecdotal: My dh worked with a dyslexic DJ for many <br/>
years.  When he had to read anything on-air, he would print it out <br/>
with HUGE letters - or scroll it across the computer in huge letters.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Experiment with learning Braille.  The problem can sometimes be <br/>
in the pathway between the eyes reading and the brain comprehending, <br/>
Braille takes that out of the equation.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Make sure Hannah understands that asking for help is not <br/>
admitting failure. I&#39;m nearly blind without my glasses, asking an eye <br/>
doctor for help was not an admission of failure.  Rachel is non-<br/>
functional without her Prozac - asking for help was her only way of <br/>
not failing.  Too many people assume that to apply a &quot;label&quot; is <br/>
limiting and always bad.  Sometimes identifying a problem is the only <br/>
way to find a solution.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941762215">Hello Bridget,<br/>
I don&#39;t think Hannah refused help because it would be admitting failure. I think she does lots of things out of fear (of the unknown).  She at least knows the option is there and will say something to me if she changes her mind. Meanwhile, I&#39;m going to take you up on your suggestion to learn more about Dyslexia and LD&#39;s. Do you or anyone else have any book recommendations? I&#39;ve read The Gift of Dyslexia so.... any others?<br/>
Thanks a lot!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393130885"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;There were some looooooong pauses<br/>
&gt;but she would eventually figure out the word (sounding out phoneticly).<br/>
&gt;These pauses were unbelievably long and made me uncomfortable. I realized<br/>
&gt;that *part* of our problem is I&#39;m impatient. I see her struggling so I jump<br/>
&gt;in and tell her the word. She doesn&#39;t like this *at all*.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something that Lars hates.  One of the problems we had working with <br/>
reading is that we didn&#39;t figure out a signal that he could use to let me <br/>
know that he wanted help.  You might want to talk with your daughter about <br/>
how she wants you to handle those spaces.  Just wait?  Wait till she asks <br/>
for help?  She gives you a signal that says she wants help?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;More than that, though, I think *I* could be her biggest obstacle because of<br/>
&gt;my rush-rush personality which doesn&#39;t allow her the time she needs to<br/>
&gt;figure things out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one reason I suggested that you try having her read silently, just <br/>
pointing to or spelling out words she wants help with.  Then you could be <br/>
doing something else (that you don&#39;t mind interruptions with) and just tell <br/>
her the words.  This way, you wouldn&#39;t even know that she was struggling <br/>
until she asked you a word, and your impatience wouldn&#39;t come into it.<br/>
