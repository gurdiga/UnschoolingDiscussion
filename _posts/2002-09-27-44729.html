barely need an income, although my husband and I LIKE to work at *some* <br/>

It&#39;s a shame that all those kids are going into and coming out of school with <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915002051">Oh Kelly, that sounds so great, your new house.  I am just starting to try and get that whole idea into my dh&#39;s head.  I want so bad to be on a farm and he keeps saying, but how will we earn a living? To me there are soooo many sources,,,I want to have a petting zoo for little kids and if we get the farm cheap we can live on very little income.  <br/>
But this must be so out of the box for him, (again), ya see if my parents would have encouraged my dreams I would probably be on my farm and not in a suburban type house with mortgage and debt!  At least I own my van,,,baby steps right?<br/>
Good job Kelly!<br/>
