<br/>
I just read Lyall Watson&#39;s book Elephantoms, which indeed, was quite  <br/>
unschooly and fascinating. Unfortunately, while I was trying to find  <br/>
it in the library, I tripped over a step stool with wheels and fell  <br/>
and scraped up both my knees. Luckily, I didnt squish my baby, though  <br/>
he was asleep in the sling, which is why I couldnt see the dang stool  <br/>
in front of me.<br/>
<br/>
One thing he mentioned in the book is that in a survey they did, a  <br/>
large number of children chose elephants as their favorite animal. My  <br/>
dd, who is turning 4 in 2 weeks, has never mentioned elephants  <br/>
before, but today told us a big long story about how much she wants  <br/>
an elephant pinata for her birthday. She danced around waving her  <br/>
&quot;trunk&quot; and made trumpet noises to show us what she wanted :)<br/>
<br/>
About Music & Lyrics...I had never wanted to see it before. But, two  <br/>
things happened. One was Sandra writing about how you can always get  <br/>
*something* from an experience if you are open to it. The second was  <br/>
spending an evening with my brother, who spits out practially every  <br/>
sentence with his obvious disdain and disapproval. He was so snotty  <br/>
and disagreeable, that I realized what a waste it is to be snobby and  <br/>
superior. I resolved to be more open-not less discerning, but just  <br/>
less snobby. I guess I had written off Music and Lyrics as a sappy  <br/>
chick flick, but it was pretty funny in parts and I did like the  <br/>
songs. I really liked the teen pop princess! LOL<br/>
<br/>
another connection....in the movie, Hugh Grants character is always  <br/>
sarcastic, funny yes, but also a little mean. Its been on my mind  <br/>
lately, sarcasm and optimism and unschooling....My DH is very  <br/>
sarcastic and often uses it as a defense mechansim to deflect  <br/>
communication, etc. and I wonder if I take his barbs too seriously or  <br/>
sarcasm as a way of life is not compatible to peaceful family living.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, always learning,<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s my favorite character, &quot;C&quot;--what a hoot!  It must have been a  <br/>
blast for the choreographers and set builders to set up for her music  <br/>
videos.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Discerning&quot; is an interesting word.  Like &quot;judgment&quot; confusing  <br/>
people between &quot;being judgmental and &quot;using good judgment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I used to be sarcastic with a few particular friends of mine.  It was  <br/>
like our whole relationships were based on dialogs filed with  <br/>
sharpness and rough sarcasm.  We were in our 20&#39;s or so, too.  And as  <br/>
we got older, we became more interested in making each other feel  <br/>
comfortable instead of uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you just don&#39;t respond to the sarcasm it will fade.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that cynicism will cancel out unschooling.<br/>
