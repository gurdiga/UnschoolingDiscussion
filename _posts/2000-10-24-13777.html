A snippet from the article:<br/>

&quot;Our ten year old daughter Heidi is learning to do the books for the family<br/>
carpet cleaning business. She is careful, detail-oriented, and very excited<br/>
about being entrusted with such an important job.&quot;<br/>

Happy reading,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904458815">Our ten year old daughter Heidi is learning to do the books for the family<br/>
carpet cleaning business. She is careful, detail-oriented, and very excited<br/>
about being entrusted with such an important job.<br/>
<br/>
I still check her work, but visualize the time in the not too distant future<br/>
when she will be able to do it all on her own.<br/>
<br/>
Decades ago when families had fewer material conveniences, less<br/>
discretionary income, and many more household tasks, it was possibly easier<br/>
to find real work for the children to do. Milking cows, mowing lawns,<br/>
churning butter, feeding animals, emptying chamber pots, mending fences--the<br/>
list went on and on.<br/>
<br/>
And perhaps those children knew their effort was needed; that everyone in<br/>
the family depended on them. There was nothing &quot;make-workish&quot; about it. Not<br/>
surprisingly, many of them grew up with a solid work ethic, and became<br/>
self-reliant adults.<br/>
<br/>
Children intuitively know when we give them important work. They often<br/>
respond positively to a gift of trust. They want to be involved in our<br/>
world; to do the jobs grown-ups do. We just have to spend the time to train<br/>
them, and then give them some real work.<br/>
<br/>
These days, many parents struggle with trying to instill in their children a<br/>
good work ethic. They enroll their children in all manner of camps, classes,<br/>
and sports teams. They buy them the clothes, the toys, the cars, the college<br/>
tuition--everything they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to have to fit in, and become<br/>
&quot;successful&quot; adults.<br/>
<br/>
Yet if children don&#39;t learn to work when they&#39;re young, to be meticulous, to<br/>
care, and to be reliable, will all of the purchased advantages still ensure<br/>
they become true successes in life?<br/>
<br/>
I have my doubts.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly, it makes a lot of sense to give children big responsibility<br/>
early; to let them know the family truly depends on their efforts.<br/>
Bequeathing them such a gift may, in the long run, prove to be far more<br/>
significant than all of the material support we might shower them with over<br/>
the years.<br/>
<br/>
And in the short run, at least in the Andersen family, now that Heidi is<br/>
learning the books, I get more time for surfing the Net.<br/>
