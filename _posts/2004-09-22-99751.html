<div id="ygrps-yiv-933101391">I don&#39;t know what to do.  I am utterly frustrated and I know it shows.  DD will either take a couple bites of her food and say she&#39;s not hungry, or simply say she&#39;s not hungry period (even if it&#39;s been hours).  Then, she will request ice cream, cookies, or whatever sweet/fatty foods we have around the house 5 minutes later, and instead of eating a couple bites or a serving she will eat and eat and eat.  She would eat half a package of oreo&#39;s or half a container of ice cream if I don&#39;t stop her.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to relax and purchase these things as she requests, but she is now requesting more and more of these snacky things and eating less of the healthier things.  Even foods she used to like she now refuses so that she can have room for the sweets.  What am I supposed to do?  She is gaining weight, being less active, extremely constipated due to lack of fiber, and mopy.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it is something my mom is saying/doing while I am gone or what.  I just am frustrated to the end of my wits.  Morbid obesity is prevalent on both my family&#39;s side and DD&#39;s father&#39;s side.  (her father had the gastric bypass surgery as did my mother) My mom is now saying we should go to a nutritionist and put her on a diet because of Bekka&#39;s eating habits.  I need some way to explain this to my mother so that if she stops if she is sabotaging my efforts in her attempt to &quot;do the right thing&quot; with my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I need some way to encourage my daughter to eat foods that are better for her body/moods, etc...  while knowing that she can still have treats and such.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976169307">I like to recommend Ellyn Satter&#39;s book, How to Get Your Child to Eat, but Not Too Much.  Lots of good stuff on body types and psychology of eating.  She has a web site too.  In spite of how it may sound from the title, she believes that it is the child&#39;s job to decide when, if, and how much to eat, or not eat.  The parent&#39;s job is to provide food.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;She would eat half a package of oreo&#39;s or half a container of ice cream if I don&#39;t stop her&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As long as you are stopping her she is not having the opportunity to regulate her own eating.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What am I supposed to do?  She is gaining weight, being less active, extremely constipated due to lack of fiber, and mopy.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has your schedule changed?  Is she bored?  It&#39;s hard to sit around and eat when you are busy having fun, playing at the park, or doing cool things with your mom.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My mom is now saying we should go to a nutritionist and put her on a diet because of Bekka&#39;s eating habits.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get your mom a copy of the above book.  Another idea I read a lot on these lists is to put out a variety of food when she asks for the treats.  Make a tray with oreos and two or three other food choices and put it all out together.  Maybe make sure her eating time is social?  When she is eating, sit with her, talk to her, maybe ask if she&#39;d like to play a game while she&#39;s eating.  Eat what you consider a reasonable amount with her.<br/>

excessive craving for sweets?<br/>
<br/>
Or was it an allergy? My brain is fuzzing up.<br/>

<br/>
As long as you are stopping her she is not having the opportunity to regulate <br/>
her own eating. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Get smaller containers and don&#39;t buy oreos, maybe, for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Make cookies with her.  Chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, maybe.  Fiber then.<br/>
Raisen and pineapple cookies with nuts.   My sister made the MOST amazing <br/>
pineapple/raisen/walnut cookies for a while.  I have the recipe, but I bet you <br/>
could find one online too.<br/>
<br/>
Make better other foods.  Make little pizzas with English muffins, or <br/>
refrigerator biscuit dough or something.  Play with food, get string cheese, make <br/>
oatmeal and put raisins or currants or banana slices in it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe BEING with her more about and with food will be better for both of you <br/>
than just leaving it to be something she does on her own.  Same with other <br/>
things.  Kids need help to play with puzzles or construction sets at first.  They <br/>
need help to draw and paint at first.  They can use company and excitement <br/>
and engagement with food too.<br/>
<br/>
Does she like egg salad or tuna/egg salad at all?  You can wrap it up in <br/>
lettuce leaves instead of putting it on bread.  Just a dab in a folded up leaf, <br/>
rolled and maybe pinned with a toothpick.  And they&#39;re fun to make, and if it <br/>
doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s still edible.<br/>
<br/>
Pineapple chunks eaten with a toothpick can be lots of fun and easy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699745084">Recipe for PB Oatmeal cookies - sans added sugars and added fats<br/>
<br/>
PB Cookies <br/>
3/4C yogurt, plain, non-fat, drain the whey if you&#39;ve got time<br/>
1/2C peanut butter <br/>
3/4C mashed banana<br/>
1 tsp baking powder <br/>
1/2 tsp baking soda <br/>
2 eggs <br/>
1 tsp vanilla <br/>
1 1/4C whole wheat flour<br/>
2C rolled oats (basic Quaker oatmeal) <br/>
raisins, peanuts, chocolate chips, M&Ms, other dried fruits, <br/>
whatever you like and have on hand<br/>
<br/>
Mix everything in a big bowl, stirring well after each addition. <br/>
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at <br/>
375 for about 10 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Makes <br/>
about 5 dozen cookies <br/>
**these will not get really brown and flat like most cookies (since <br/>
there&#39;s no fat or sugar to caramelize) but will stay pretty much in <br/>
the shape you drop them - I use a mini-ice cream scoop to make <br/>
rounded ones that end up a lot like mini-muffins. They store and <br/>
travel well. It hits pretty much a little of everything - fruit, <br/>
protein, dairy, whole grains - in a handy, kid-sized form.</div>
