Holly had it four weeks.  It seems to be everywhere.  Kirby and Keith were <br/>
REALLY sick for just a few days.  Marty&#39;s was light.  Mine started hard and <br/>
lightened up.<br/>

If it&#39;s the same thing others are having, it could last a month.  Sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48027862">Well thanks for the cheer up ;-)  Actually, if it only last one more week I<br/>
think I&#39;ll be happy.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stand this.  Sometimes my chest burns, there is this almost soap<br/>
like taste in my mouth, my eyes hurt and my bloody ears are so clogged I can<br/>
only half hear! Not to mention a cough that won&#39;t quit. And I&#39;m ON<br/>
anti-biotics...<br/>
<br/>
GRRRRRRRR<br/>
45 and falling apart....<br/>
<br/>
Sorry everyone was ill by you....<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann<br/>

anti-biotics...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband took anti-biotics and it didn&#39;t seem to help.  I take NyQuil at <br/>
night and I am helped for several hours, which makes me a better nurse for <br/>
the rest of the gang in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby don&#39;t much like drugs so they wanted to tough it out, and <br/>
except for Kirby taking DayQuill to go to work and EVERYBODY drinking lots of <br/>
cranberry juice and water and eating homemade chicken soup and bread...   it <br/>
just takes time.  Since we had the assortment of treatments and responses, <br/>
here, I say do what makes you comfortable while you wait for your body to get <br/>
well.<br/>
