&gt; You could buy new dishes at a garage sale and throw your old ones away if <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re just tired of looking at them.  That might make doing dishes more <br/>
&gt; fun.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I threw my old ones out and have started collecting random colorful <br/>
dishes...fiestaware, etc. It has made a world of difference for me. I keep forgetting <br/>
to call the dishwasher repairman to fix our leaking dishwasher, and instead <br/>
have been washing them by hand. It has become a &quot;thinking time&quot; for me. I <br/>
choose to wash them by hand. And it has actually become  enjoyable to me because of <br/>
the new colorful dishes.<br/>
<br/>
  What I don&#39;t like is sorting the silverware. It didn&#39;t bother me a bit when <br/>
the divider broke. I just dump them in the drawer now...hahahaha. I know one <br/>
of these days I &quot;should&quot; ( I suppose) have more order to that drawer..but boy, <br/>
what fun it is to just dump all of them in...it must be my inner child coming <br/>
out &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
