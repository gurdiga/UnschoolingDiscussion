 </span></blockquote>my son took awhile to acknowledge when he was peeing, almost 3 1/2. so when <br/>
he ran up to me and said, &quot;mommy mommy! come look! i peed on the floor!&quot;  i <br/>
kept my grumble on the inside and smiled and said &#39;yeah!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
i did try the potty on cue when he was less than a year. we had always done <br/>
breastfeeding on cue and it kinda worked the same way. but i did it for such <br/>
a short period of time. in fact i did it without really noticing. he&#39;d go <br/>
naked a lot, and after awhile i noticed that i always thought to diaper him <br/>
right before he went. i usually &#39;knew&#39; when he was going to go. we moved a <br/>
lot and a lot of changes so it kinda went out the window. plus we gradually <br/>
worked in some disposables. but i&#39;m so glad to hear of people doing it with <br/>
good results. aside from using baby cues and such, i&#39;ve also heard that women <br/>
are more psychic when pregnant and nursing, hormonal thing. and i certainly <br/>
felt the change when we stopped breastfeeding. i wasn&#39;t as mentally &#39;linked&#39; <br/>
with my son.<br/>
