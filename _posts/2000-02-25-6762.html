<div id="ygrps-yiv-5395843">I&#39;ve had migraines since I was 7 years old, on and off.  Mine are mostly<br/>
related to stress and tension.  I tend to hold a lot of tension in my neck<br/>
and head and when life&#39;s too busy, I get the most crippling headaches.<br/>
The best &quot;treatment&quot; plan for me is too recognize when I&#39;m about to get a<br/>
migraine and get a massage quickly.  Also, acupuncture has helped, too.  I<br/>
know not all migraines are stress related but, if  I slow down, take care<br/>
of myself, get a massage or acupunture treatment (or both!), I can usually<br/>
avoid a serious headache.  (I have seasonal allergies, as well, and spring<br/>
or fall is when I &#39;m most at risk for a headache.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141032423">Thanks Wini, and all that offered suggestions.<br/>
Went to the dr yesterday.  He put me on imitrex.  Didn&#39;t do it though.<br/>
Then I took a zebutol.  It helped more, but I still had the headache.<br/>
We will experiment with medication I think and then maybe I will be able<br/>
to think more clearly about alternatives......  Really appreciate<br/>
everyone&#39;s input.<br/>

&lt;&lt; hen I took a zebutol.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
I have a terrible time with migraines and have tried lots of different meds, <br/>
but I&#39;ve never heard of zebutol.  What is it?  Is it a pain killer or is it <br/>
specifically for migraine like imitrex is?  Imitrex never worked for me and <br/>
it made me feel &quot;funny&quot; besides.  I take Midrin, which usually works if I <br/>
take enough of it.  It makes me sleepy though, which is tough with the kids <br/>
at home and still too young to be completely independent - especially now <br/>
with baby Josephine.  Recently my neuro had me try Amerge, which is fabulous. <br/>
 It is in the same class as Imitrex, but it works much better for me.  The <br/>
best part - absolutely NO side effects of any kind!!!  For those really, <br/>
really awful migraines I take Percocet as well.  The downside of that is that <br/>
Percocet tends to make the migraine nausea worse.  Do you have &quot;regular&quot; <br/>
migraines and horrible migraines as well?  Three or four times a year I get <br/>
one that is so bad it almost seems like a living thing in my body.  It feels <br/>
creepy, as if it&#39;s a personal attack.  (that sounds weird unless you get <br/>
those kind yourself, and then I&#39;ll bet you know what I mean!).  Anyhow, I&#39;d <br/>
be interested in knowing about Zebutol.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809123233">Zebutal is a narcotic type drug.  It isn&#39;t helping me all the way<br/>
either.  It is to get me through the weekend until we can try a<br/>
different med. Immitrex isn&#39;t going to work for me either.  I think<br/>
midrin is next to try.<br/>
My migraines are almost daily, but not that knock me flat.  They are<br/>
very painful though.  The light sensitivity is terrible.<br/>
If midrin doesn&#39;t do it, the dr suggested an antidepressant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86470536">A.- been monitoring this site for quite awhile.  I am the mother of 3,<br/>
two of which homeschool, or should I say unschool.  In response to your<br/>
migraine questions, I think I can help.  I have been a migraine sufferer<br/>
since the ripe old age of three.  At least that is what I have been<br/>
told.  I too am a daily migraine sufferer and have finally found<br/>
relief.  I have tried all the conventional antidotes ex- ergotomines,<br/>
imitrex, and so on.  I finally found a nuerologist who really knows his<br/>
meds.  He has me taking a drug called Sibelium Capsules 5mg. one daily<br/>
(I take it before bed) and it  does the trick. Technically it is known<br/>
as a calcium channel blocker.  Now for the bad news.  This med is only<br/>
available out of the country.  I get it in Mexico.  It is made by<br/>
Janssen Pharmacuetical, which is a large reputable drug company, in case<br/>
you didn&#39;t know.  Also, I should mention that my dad is a physician and<br/>
if there was any risk with this drug I would not be taking it.  It seems<br/>
the FDA just hasn&#39;t approved it for sales in the U.S. yet.  In Mexico,<br/>
it is sold over the counter, like most other drugs are there, so it is<br/>
no problem getting it  if you have a connection.  Don&#39;t know where you<br/>
are located, but Canada probably has it too.  I know of other people who<br/>
are also taking this and it has made the world of difference in their<br/>
lives.  Mind you I still get the occasional migraines (in fact I woke<br/>
with one this morning) but with 3 excedrin, a dark room, and pressure on<br/>
my head I can usually get over it within a hour.  I would really<br/>
question a dr. who wants to put you on antideppresants for migraine.<br/>
Just my $.02.  Didn&#39;t mean to go on so long but I do know what you are<br/>
going through and wish you all the best.  Shelley<br/>
