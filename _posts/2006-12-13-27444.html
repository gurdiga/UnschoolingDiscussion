&gt; a religious thing rather than a scientific thing. I haven&#39;t looked into<br/>
&gt; it much yet though. ... [snip]<br/>

Cally has it right.   I am in harmony with the growing number of <br/>
thinkers coming out to say &quot;there is no God.&quot;  With them I fear that it <br/>
is not only the Islamic and Christian fundamentalists who would lead us <br/>
back to the days of the Inquisition.  It is also the masses of people <br/>
who have faith in any magic or divine power to solve the problems made <br/>
by humans.  [Or to win their football games]. All believers in <br/>
religions support by tolerating those who who take their faith to <br/>
extremes.<br/>
<br/>
But at the same time I worry about people who don&#39;t recognize that we <br/>
all live on faith in most of our daily lives.  I know of few people who <br/>
can PROVE that the earth is a globe.  Or that the universe was started <br/>
by a big bang.   Or that mass and energy are the same thing.  I have <br/>
faith in the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics,  and I also <br/>
have faith in Gaia theory,  Chaos theory, and Complexity theory.  This <br/>
is not religious in the sense of being something divine, magic, or <br/>
anything else outside the laws of nature.<br/>
<br/>
I take my faith in scientific theories beyond the limits of the <br/>
science.  While in science of Gaia theory is about unity of the <br/>
physical earth and life on earth.  It finds that life on Earth is made <br/>
possible by live on Earth.  All entities in the universe are <br/>
interlocked and interdependent.  No entity can exist without the <br/>
others.   I see this faith as applicable to the social sphere as it is <br/>
to the biological and physical spheres.<br/>
<br/>
It is in that sense that I write about a &#39;Gaian Paradigm&#39; as replacing <br/>
the &#39;dominator paradigm.&#39;  Like the scientific Copernicus paradigm <br/>
replaced the world view of the earth as the center of the universe with <br/>
heaven out there and hell down there.  And like the  Darwinian paradigm <br/>
replaced the world view that man was different, better and above all <br/>
other life form. So the Gaian paradigm is revealing the unity and <br/>
interconnectedness of all things in the universe including humans with <br/>
one another.<br/>
