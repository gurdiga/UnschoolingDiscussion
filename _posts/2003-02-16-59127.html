<div id="ygrps-yiv-318238013">My dd-17 wants to go to college; she is quite determined on that <br/>
goal. As yet, she is undecided on what type of career or field she <br/>
wants to study; this week it is dramatic arts, and last month it was <br/>
chemistry. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the problem...I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do at her <br/>
age, either.  We sat down together, and I helped her plan how she <br/>
could achieve that goal, and how we could put together a transcript. <br/>
Most of the colleges she wants to attend require two years of a <br/>
foreign language; and after looking at Spanish, French and Latin, dd <br/>
chose to study Spanish. She doesn&#39;t like it. I&#39;ve offered videos, <br/>
computer programs, etc. She doesn&#39;t like any of it. That&#39;s okay, too, <br/>
I reassure her; we&#39;ll look for colleges that don&#39;t require 2 years of <br/>
foreign language. She says, &quot;No, that limits my choices too much.&quot; I <br/>
explained to her that if her goal is to attend certain colleges, she <br/>
has to decide whether it&#39;s important enough to her to study a foreign <br/>
language.  She agrees...and continues to ignore the Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
What would you (collective &quot;you&quot; addressed to the group) do?  Wait it <br/>
out?  I thought about telling her that I won&#39;t falsify a transcript <br/>
for her, but that sounds kinda like a threat...and I know *I* <br/>
wouldn&#39;t respond well to that &lt;g&gt;.  She&#39;s not a child anymore, and I <br/>
want to respect her right to make decisions that affect her life.  <br/>
That recognition of her right to make choices battles against my <br/>
instincts as a mother to &quot;fix&quot; everything for her...and, if I&#39;m <br/>
honest, I worry that I&#39;ll blame myself for not insisting she complete <br/>
enough work to legitimately claim 2 credits of a foreign language.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, she&#39;s mid-way through her 3rd year of high school.<br/>

<br/>
I understand what&#39;s above, I don&#39;t understand this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;BTW, she&#39;s mid-way through her 3rd year of high school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is she not unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Colleges list what they would LIKE applicants to have, but they might rather <br/>
hear she was homeschooled than that she has two years of language.<br/>
<br/>
She could write a cover letter saying &quot;I haven&#39;t studied languages, but I <br/>
hope to be able to do that while I&#39;m at the university.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s easy and honest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, she is.  In Pennsylvania, we are required to file yearly <br/>
affidavits of homeschooling (along with listing objectives, providing <br/>
samples of work in a portfolio, a log of materials used, and yearly <br/>
evaluations from a certified evaluator), so according to the school <br/>
district, she is in 11th grade.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Sandra.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would try to find ways to start hanging around with native Spanish <br/>
speakers.<br/>
<br/>
I might try to plan a trip down to Mexico to immerse ourelves in the <br/>
language (money permiiting, which it usually isn&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d put an ad in the classifieds for a language buddy to hang out with.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she could volunteer to help a Spanish speaking worker on their job. <br/>
Follow them around and help out in exchange for some real life Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
Get a pen-pal from a Spanish speaking country.<br/>
<br/>
Put on the SAP (Spanish) option on the TV and start watching familiar shows <br/>
in Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas off the top of my head. I&#39;ve taken 3 years of German and 3 <br/>
years of Spanish. It meant nothing. I would not feel like I was falsifying <br/>
anything if my kids learned about a foregn lanfguage in the ways I stated <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

&gt; What would you (collective &quot;you&quot; addressed to the group) do? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just wrote something about language---just two or three days ago: it&#39;s best <br/>
to immerse yourself in the language and culture, just as you did english. <br/>
Then it comes &quot;naturally&quot;. There are many exchange programs available---just <br/>
spending the summer with a family in another country would be great.<br/>
<br/>
But many colleges are now accepting sign language as a &quot;foreign language&quot;. <br/>
There are MANY deaf people, schools, and teachers out there who would be <br/>
delighted to &quot;talk&quot; with your daughter---and you wouldn&#39;t have to send her <br/>
away! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one school in Columbia that all hearing impaired children go to. <br/>
They&#39;re not &quot;mainstreamed&quot; because they can&#39;t hear, but they do all attend <br/>
the same school with signing teachers in those classes. There&#39;s also the <br/>
School for the Blind and Deaf in Spartanburg---if you have a school like that <br/>
nearby, she could visit as a teacher&#39;s aid and get some valuable &quot;hands-on&quot; <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
My boys were at one time interested in signing, so I looked into it. The <br/>
school was tentatively interested in it, but the boys&#39; own interest waned.<br/>
<br/>
She might find that more &quot;usable&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s obviously many colleges that don&#39;t require the foreign language option. Many english kids are accepted into Harvard and Yale and Dartmouth etc etc. Most kids drop languages at 14. They drop<br/>
maths at 16. Then study 3 subjects for 2 years to get A levels. American universities have no trouble accepting them and often have exhibitions at career fairs to try and tempt students to pick an<br/>
American university.<br/>
