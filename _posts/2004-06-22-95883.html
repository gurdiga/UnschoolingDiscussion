<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>22 Jun 2004, at  7:46pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833909580">I am looking into quitting my nursing job.  Yes, it pays well, and it is flexible, but I&quot;m sick of working weekends and holidays and I&#39;m sick of the politics of the pecking order.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about starting my own cleaning business.  I was wondering if any of you do this, and how you go about setting it up, specifically, how you set up the contract so that you and the client know exactly what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t exactly an unschooling topic although if you go to unschooling.com and read my repsonse there to J-bean, you&#39;ll see how I link it to unschooling &lt;bg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, you can email me privately :o)<br/>
