<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668130420">Hi, all<br/>
<br/>
I am still learning how to better support my children&#39;s interest, how to strew and how to unschool. <br/>
<br/>
I would like some input not only on how to strew and how to support in general but only on resources on the specific areas I listed if you have some.<br/>
<br/>
Or am I overdoing it? <br/>
<br/>
Here is the note I wrote<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Orion (5.5 years old) is really into minecraft. That is what he does every day for four months now except other activities I arrange. I wonder if I should try to incorporate more into his minecraft work. What I have in mind is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1. Reading. I will create a short list of words, phrases and short sentences to help him communicate with other players in minecraft<br/>
<br/>
2. Socialization <br/>
I have been trying to point out what are the more effective ways to communicate with other people. For example, being polite, being responsive, respecting other&#39;s work, asking for permission before taking things out of chest.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to set up skype for him to do video chat. Arrange minecraft gathering (in person). <br/>
<br/>
3. Creativity<br/>
Maybe set up projects, for example, build a city with other players. Have a theme. <br/>
Also I have been thinking about incorporating architectural design concept, visiting with some architects, learning drafting or making model buildings. <br/>
<br/>
Those are just ideas. I have to learn myself if I want to facilitate or put resources together.<br/>
<br/>
4. Geology<br/>
He is very interested in rocks, gems and minerals. Maybe I can help to expand into geology. Ideas or suggestions? <br/>
<br/>
I got books, excavation kit, collect rocks, go to stores...<br/>
<br/>
5. Art<br/>
Make minecraft the theme for art and craft. We drew creepers or sculpt creepers. Need to do more. MaybeCollect all the minecraft art on the Internet. <br/>
<br/>
6. City planning<br/>
Is another theme we can focus on and learn about. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any of the above takes quite some time or effort to get into, learn myself and put things together. Sometimes I feel I cannot keep up. Am I overdoing it? Is there more efficient way of doing it?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for input, ideas and suggestions<br/>

<br/>
This list seems like goals *you* want him to attain. Do you think he  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t learn any of these things if you didn&#39;t lay out a program?<br/>
<br/>
Go slow. If he&#39;s interested in what you propose, do a bit. If he  <br/>
isn&#39;t, drop it for now.<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine that if you push him on reading, socialization,  <br/>
creativity, geology, art and city planning (good grief, he&#39;s 5!!!),  <br/>
he&#39;ll cease to enjoy Minecraft.<br/>
<br/>
Help him to accomplish *his* goals in Minecraft (or anything, for that  <br/>
matter).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539429609">It all sounds like a pretty nice curriculum - but you didn&#39;t really <br/>
expect to get support for creating a curriculum here, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re overdoing it, yes.<br/>
<br/>
How about, just for now, you think of something that might enhance your <br/>
son&#39;s enjoyment of his life --- if he could do or have one thing that <br/>
would make him even happier than he already is, what might that one <br/>
thing be?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to comment on each of the things you listed - not to <br/>
criticize, because any of those things could possibly BE the thing that <br/>
would make his life even happier - but to help you see how schoolish <br/>
your thinking is, still, so that you might be able to make a leap past <br/>
it. It is like you were on one island, Jihong, where a rather harsh type <br/>
of schooling, including pressuring and shaming kids was the norm, and <br/>
you leaped across the water to a new island, where the focus is on the <br/>
kids enjoying their learning. You&#39;ve had a lot of fun and gotten a lot <br/>
of insight from seeing how your son has blossomed and learned so much <br/>
without force or pressure, but it is time to consider leaping to the <br/>
NEXT island,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Reading. I will create a short list of words, phrases and short <br/>
&gt; sentences to help him communicate with other players in minecraft<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are thinking in terms of subjects. Reading is a subject. Instead, <br/>
think of how to help him play in a way that is as much fun as possible. <br/>
Since he doesn&#39;t read yet, his playing will be more fun if you read for <br/>
him, answer his questions, maybe lightly point out words that he uses <br/>
frequently. But don&#39;t turn his fun into a lesson....he will learn to <br/>
read when he&#39;s ready and he does not need you to fashion lessons, no <br/>
matter how subtle they may be.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; taking things out of chest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might not know the social appropriateness of that particular <br/>
&quot;society,&quot; so I&#39;d be careful about giving him too much instruction. He <br/>
will figure it out. If he has problems, though, then you might help him <br/>
figure it out by giving him information and helping him think through <br/>
possible consequences. But, you didn&#39;t say he is having any kind of <br/>
problems - so why would you need to intervene?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does he think that sounds fun? He&#39;s pretty young still - I&#39;m not <br/>
familiar enough with this stuff to know if doing video chat is a good <br/>
idea for such a young boy, but maybe you should hold off until he <br/>
expresses an interest. Have you mentioned getting together with other <br/>
players? Does he think that sounds fun? Offer ideas, lightly! If his <br/>
eyes light up, follow through<br/>

&gt; model buildings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has he expressed any interest in architectural design? This seems way <br/>
over the top - he wants to play a video game and you&#39;re planning for him <br/>
to learn drafting, make model buildings, and visit architects?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; expand into geology. Ideas or suggestions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An interest in rocks, gems, and minerals IS an interest in geology - <br/>
that is what geology is. Are you thinking of it as a school subject? <br/>
Can&#39;t he just be interested in rocks, gems, and minerals? Collect rocks <br/>
when you&#39;re out in different places. There are a few interesting things <br/>
about rocks you might mention, but, seriously, keep it light. I feel <br/>
very overwhelmed by your plans/list and I&#39;m not a little boy. Just let <br/>
him collect rocks and organize them as he sees fit. And if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to collect them, that&#39;s okay, too.<br/>
<br/>
Please let him have fleeting interests - don&#39;t blow every interest up <br/>
into some big thing. Offer just a tidbit at at time, don&#39;t design a life <br/>
plan based on what could very very likely be a passing interest.<br/>

just do have some cool art supplies around the house. If he wants to do <br/>
some sort of minecraft related art, he will.<br/>

Way overdoing, over-organizing, over-visualizing, over-controlling.<br/>
<br/>
Strew is not so much a &quot;how to&quot; as an occasional thing you&#39;ve noticed or found that you put out where it can be discovered.  Nobody can tell you what to strew, because nobody knows what you&#39;ll come across in the course of your life.<br/>

Don&#39;t put resources together.  Just play.  Let him play.  Get him things he asks for, and let him play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097160751">Thank you very much, Robin and Pam. <br/>
<br/>
This is the clarification I really need.<br/>
<br/>
I am still confused with the concept of &quot;strewing and supporting children&#39;s interests&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I need help on those two areas: what is strewing and how to support?<br/>
<br/>
The support part I did includes:<br/>
1. help him to install the mods and texture packs he wants (from watching youtube video). To me, it is a little bit struggling understanding those terminology in minecraft.<br/>
<br/>
2. provide food and many times feed him because he doesn&#39;t want to take a break from his game<br/>
<br/>
3. help him to read and type<br/>
<br/>
4. help him to sit more comfortably with proper support<br/>
<br/>
5. Share his excitement <br/>
<br/>
6. provide encouragement<br/>
<br/>
7. provide variety of activities to entice him away from his computer and get some excises.<br/>
<br/>
8. try not to freak out with the hours he spends on minecraft :))<br/>
<br/>
After a couple of months playing, he has mastered the basic skills. Now he seems to be a little lost on directions (he starts to watch the basic youtube again, how to survive the first night). So I wonder if I should help with more suggestions, directions and help him to expand more.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are based on the belief that I may know more related subjects and connections of the subject he is interested. In this case, he loves building. So I got those ideas to help him to expand. I thought that was what strewing is about. (please correct me if I am wrong)<br/>
<br/>
About socialization, yes, he is really excited with playing with other players. So i want to help him more on that.<br/>
<br/>
I have difficulty understanding the concept of strewing. I would appreciate clarification on that.<br/>
<br/>
Also when I suggest activities, he always resisted but had a great time when he tried it out. so i am not sure if i should continue to confront his resistance or just follow his lead. for example, tonight we had a great time blowing bubbles, chasing bubbles outside. bu he didnt want to go in the beginning. same thing with other activities, like swimming, picking berries, which he loved before and still enjoys once i get him to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Any thought on the resistance part? I do take computer everywhere we go, so less resistance even if most of the time he would enjoy other things when we are out.<br/>
<br/>
thanks a lot<br/>

Installing new mods he wants. Especially right at the minute he asked me to do it. (But I can&#39;t. I really need alone time to do it. Otherwise I cannot figure out how to do it with disruptions. He often cries because of that)<br/>

Yes, I would love to make the leap!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I am pushing this agenda a little bit. I thought he may play better if he could read. <br/>
<br/>
I cannot sit with him all the time while I attend to other things. While I am away, he gets banned from the servers because he doesn&#39;t read and cannot understand what is going on in the server.<br/>
<br/>
That creates lots of frustration for him. <br/>
<br/>
I admit I am pushing it too.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You might not know the social appropriateness of that particular <br/>
&gt; &quot;society,&quot; so I&#39;d be careful about giving him too much instruction. He <br/>
&gt; will figure it out. If he has problems, though, then you might help him <br/>
&gt; figure it out by giving him information and helping him think through <br/>
&gt; possible consequences. But, you didn&#39;t say he is having any kind of <br/>
&gt; problems - so why would you need to intervene?<br/>
<br/>
I really like what you said. &quot;you might help him figure it out by giving him information and helping him think through possible consequences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I admit I have been lecturing!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to set up skype for him to do video chat. Arrange <br/>
&gt; &gt; minecraft gathering (in person).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Does he think that sounds fun? He&#39;s pretty young still - I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; familiar enough with this stuff to know if doing video chat is a good <br/>
&gt; idea for such a young boy, but maybe you should hold off until he <br/>
&gt; expresses an interest. Have you mentioned getting together with other <br/>
&gt; players? Does he think that sounds fun? Offer ideas, lightly! If his <br/>
&gt; eyes light up, follow through<br/>
<br/>
Great point!  &quot;If his eyes light up, follow through&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. Creativity<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe set up projects, for example, build a city with other players. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Have a theme.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also I have been thinking about incorporating architectural design <br/>
&gt; &gt; concept, visiting with some architects, learning drafting or making <br/>
&gt; &gt; model buildings.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has he expressed any interest in architectural design? This seems way <br/>
&gt; over the top - he wants to play a video game and you&#39;re planning for him <br/>
&gt; to learn drafting, make model buildings, and visit architects?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He wants to build some cool structures but expresses lack of ability to do that. I wonder a visit with architect would help him to learn how the creative ideas are formed and may enhance his building creation. When he sees other minecraft creations, he often says, &quot;wow, it is so cool. how did they do that? I wish I could build something like that&quot;. I don&#39;t know how to help him to realize his desire to build better buildings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Those are just ideas. I have to learn myself if I want to facilitate <br/>
&gt; &gt; or put resources together.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4. Geology<br/>
&gt; &gt; He is very interested in rocks, gems and minerals. Maybe I can help to <br/>
&gt; &gt; expand into geology. Ideas or suggestions?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; An interest in rocks, gems, and minerals IS an interest in geology - <br/>
&gt; that is what geology is. Are you thinking of it as a school subject? <br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t he just be interested in rocks, gems, and minerals? Collect rocks <br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re out in different places. There are a few interesting things <br/>
&gt; about rocks you might mention, but, seriously, keep it light. I feel <br/>
&gt; very overwhelmed by your plans/list and I&#39;m not a little boy. Just let <br/>
&gt; him collect rocks and organize them as he sees fit. And if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want to collect them, that&#39;s okay, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please let him have fleeting interests - don&#39;t blow every interest up <br/>
&gt; into some big thing. Offer just a tidbit at at time, don&#39;t design a life <br/>
&gt; plan based on what could very very likely be a passing interest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I got books, excavation kit, collect rocks, go to stores...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh dear.<br/>
<br/>
He asked me so many questions that I couldn&#39;t answer. So I bought books with lots of pictures in it. Sometimes we compared what we found to the book. Also I got him the excavation kit with rocks buries in it. He had fun digging them out and comparing with the information sheet. When I take him to the store, he never wanted to leave. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to support his interests. So what I had in mind was to study the subject more myself and help him out when he needs information. Or lay the information out and see if he is interested in knowing.<br/>
<br/>
Is it too much or not? I am not sure lots of time myself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; 5. Art<br/>
&gt; &gt; Make minecraft the theme for art and craft. We drew creepers or sculpt <br/>
&gt; &gt; creepers. Need to do more. MaybeCollect all the minecraft art on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Internet. IF<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe just a little....IF that is something he&#39;s interested in - mostly <br/>
&gt; just do have some cool art supplies around the house. If he wants to do <br/>
&gt; some sort of minecraft related art, he will.<br/>
<br/>
He likes to draw, but lots of time he asked me what he should be drawing. I don&#39;t know either, so I suggested creepers :))<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should have more books laying around the house and he can find some inspiration when he needs ideas???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; 6. City planning<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is another theme we can focus on and learn about.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why would you do that? Serious question! Why?<br/>
<br/>
When he watched youtube and found the city other players built fascinating, he asked me, &quot;mama, how can I build something like that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I thought maybe we could explore &quot;city planning&quot;, what a city should consist of, what consideration should go in when someone builds a city.<br/>
<br/>
So I am not sure I am following and supporting his interests, or I am overdoing it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Pam. Your input is great appreciated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873770813">Recently I came across &quot;play at home mom&quot; blog<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://playathomemom3.blogspot.com/">http://playathomemom3.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I have got many inspiring ideas from the blog and facebook page. But I also feel &quot;insecure&quot; or &quot;disturbed&quot; (lack of better words to describe).<br/>
<br/>
I feel I am not doing enough and I am not doing the right things. I didn&#39;t provide enough learning opportunities. And I didn&#39;t even know &quot;sensory integration&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I feel I am failing my children for being inadequate...<br/>
<br/>
I feel I may let my children do too much digital media, too little on &quot;sensory stimulation or integration&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All these add to my more grand &quot;ideas&quot; today  :(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we are having fun everyday. Everyone is doing what they enjoy doing:<br/>
<br/>
DS5.75 plays minecraft. It is so great to see he is having fun and learning tons without much assistance from other people.<br/>
<br/>
DD2.5 enjoys ipad coloring apps, matching numbers and letters to complete the coloring and gets rewarded with the music she likes and she dances to the music.<br/>
<br/>
Mommy enjoys reading on her ipad too.<br/>
<br/>
Until...the thought crossed my mind: Oh, No...I am not doing enough and I am not doing the right thing. Instead of stimulating my children&#39;s sensory by creating all the wonderful ideas, I allow too much screen time.<br/>
<br/>
Or, the weather is so nice outside, we need to be outside more. ( I do manage to get us to play outside at least once a day)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on my hesitation and confusion?<br/>

<br/>
In the time you might have spent taking him to visit an architect (who probably doesn&#39;t have the time or interest to talk to a young child for an hour on the distant chance that it might help him play minecraft better), you yourself could play enough minecraft to help him directly.  Or find another kid who would be willing to help him.  <br/>
<br/>
About reading, or about building a fancier structure in a video game, be cheerful and encouraging, and don&#39;t focus on what he&#39;s not doing, but what he IS doing, and reassure him he&#39;s learning a little bit every day.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s google.  There are rock shops where you could look at rocks for sale, maybe take photos but don&#39;t buy them all.  Maybe buy one little one. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe other places don&#39;t have as many rock shops as I&#39;m used to, but anyone interested in rocks who visits Albuquerque should go to Southwestern Mineral on Central.  If you (any of you reading) look up your town and gem and mineral, you might find clubs or shows or shops.<br/>
<br/>
I think here&#39;s your strewing disconnect:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t know how to support his interests. So what I had in mind was to study the subject more myself and help him out when he needs information. Or lay the information out and see if he is interested in knowing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You lay &quot;the information&quot; out.  Tons of information, instead of one cool thing at a time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is it too much or not? I am not sure lots of time myself.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It depends on Orion.  If he&#39;s interested and asking more questions, then you could keep going.  If he seems impatient or uninterested, you went too far.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe I should have more books laying around the house and he can find some inspiration when he needs ideas???-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not &quot;more books.&quot;  The idea that learning needs books is too schoolish.  FIRST learn to live without thinking &quot;a book!&quot; every time.  Then books can be found by him on his own (or with your help if he asks), instead of seeming (to him, because of your actions) to be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
There are videos (maybe streaming somewhere, of TV shows about drawing) and probably youtube videos of people drawing, or of animated drawings (drawings seeming to appear) and that might be fun for him, but they might not.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you and he could make a list of things he might want to draw so the next time he asks you can go to the list.  Or point at things in the room for ideas for him to draw.  Maybe you could draw too, with him, but not so well or so fast that he&#39;s discouraged. Maybe take the pencils and a drawing pad outside sometime when you&#39;re going somewhere, but don&#39;t press him to draw just because you brought it--he might want to do something else, and that would be good.  If he has choices and can choose from two or three great things, the choices will be better.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  Stop reading so many different blogs. :-)<br/>
<br/>
You could spend hours every day reading a scattered range of opinions about how you are RUINING your child&#39;s LIFE!!   Don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a favorite other family for a long time, and really enjoyed the company of the kids her age, and liked the mom, and the mom had a baby, and Holly was really excited about that, but their contact was erratic and the parents were really controlling of time and place and schedule, and sometimes Holly was extremely welcome--they would pick her up and take her places--and other times, she would ask to come over and the answer was that they were too busy or it wasn&#39;t a good time.  And that was coming from the mom, not the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Years passed.<br/>
<br/>
Holly talked to the son who&#39;s closest to her age.  What she found out was worse than she already knew.  The mom had never once kept the same goal/philosophy/plan for an entire school year.  It seems the mom&#39;s energy was all put toward changing, improving, finding the perfect way to be.  Her kids were in and out of various kinds of school and homeschooling, unschooling, Waldorf, charter, private, computer-focus, traditional public school.   The only constant was change.  And looking back and talking to her friend, Holly&#39;s summary to me was that what the mom wanted was for other moms to see her as a busily concerned mom who had researched The Best option of the moment, and would Do ANYthing to provide that for her children.    <br/>
<br/>
What she was providing for her children, though, was instability, a panicky, reactive mother who criticized them and the people around them all the time, and acted as though their lives would be RUINED if she didn&#39;t do something NOW!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be that mom.<br/>
Don&#39;t be a jittery tiger-mom of unschooling.<br/>
Try to find calm and patience and acceptance, and then you&#39;ll find that you can think more clearly and there will be time to be quietly with your kids and you&#39;ll be better able to see what they themselves are interested in, without caring so much what people on blogs or this list THINK they should be interested in.  I think you&#39;re looking at them through filters instead of seeing them directly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447129732">***My thoughts are based on the belief that I may know more related subjects and connections of the subject he is interested. In this case, he loves building. So I got those ideas to help him to expand. I thought that was what strewing is about. (please correct me if I am wrong)***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If he loves to build, strewing might look like this:<br/>
<br/>
...at the thrift store and you see some interesting foam blocks and purchase them because they look useful for building.<br/>
<br/>
...at the park and you see some interesting rocks and sticks and you bring them to where your son is playing in the sand and help him incorporate them into a building design.<br/>
<br/>
...online and you find an interesting and catchy youtube video that has some cool lego building project and you share it with your son.<br/>
<br/>
...you are driving to the grocery store and you see a demolition in progress, so you pull over to watch.  Or, similarly, a building in progress, or a great big hole in the ground, etc.<br/>
<br/>
...you save cardboard boxes and pull them out in a time of restlessness and build a box fort with him.<br/>
<br/>
That is just a start, a small start on strewing with building in mind.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The way unschooling works, is by taking everything that you do and connecting them together.  Every time your child builds a fort, or lego creation, or works on a minecraft house, he&#39;s learning how to build.  He will learn more from that than he will from an architect.<br/>
<br/>
An 11 yr old girl doesn&#39;t learn how to dress stylishly by visiting a fashion designer, she learns by finding things she likes and trying them on and wearing them.  It works the same for 5 yr old boys who like to build things.<br/>
<br/>
Every little thing related to building will add to his knowledge of building and he will apply it to his game, or whatever it is he&#39;s doing and interested in at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Make towers, build toothpick marshmallow sculptures, look at buildings, point out things when you drive by them or walk by them.  All those little bits of information will add to what he already knows.  It doesn&#39;t need to be long conversations, just casual observations.  Tinker with things.  Talk and tinker and he will learn.<br/>

<br/>
Have his legos out and play minecraft with the legos ( my  kids love to play pretend)<br/>
<br/>
Md has cut wood just because of Minecraft! We have talked about how diamond is hard and gold is not. We have looked stuff up on Google. Lots of stuff, minerals and their hardness, the periodic table, but he is 9 and not 5 and that was interesting to him now. <br/>
I give him information and share stuff with him but I stop when I sense that he had enough.<br/>
<br/>
We bought some rocks  at the museum that he keeps in his computer desk. He already has a rock collection which means he finds rocks and collects them. <br/>
<br/>
When MD was Orion&#39;s age he was  a big Robloxian. He played a lot of Roblox. He learned to read playing Roblox. It was something that just happened. <br/>
I sat with him and read what the other players were tying, I typed his answers. I helped him type by spelling, then he needed me less and less until he was reading fluently a year later . I did not turn Roblox into a reading lesson. He wanted to communicate and I helped him.<br/>
Reading happened. It may not be the same for Orion, he may not read until he is 10!<br/>
When MD wanted to build he watched videos and played. When he wanted to script doors, I read about LUA and scripted for him until he was doing it himself. I did not sit there and try to teach him to script. I just did it with him sitting there excited about it.<br/>
I have a lot more to write about all this but I have  my sister&#39;s boys over until Wednesday as she is in California with my brother&#39;s family. He is in very critical condition at this moment from an accident and  I have not felt like or had time to write long posts.<br/>

counting the months until the next birthday ie. &quot;I&#39;m 5 and 9 months&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
BTW please do *not* take that as a suggestion to encourage your kids  <br/>
to think in those terms unless they want to! I sometimes get the  <br/>
feeling that you want to incorporate every single idea folks have here  <br/>
to somehow teach your kids something you think they now ought to know,  <br/>
because they haven&#39;t thought up themselves yet &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s what a friend of mine called &quot;FOMSS&quot; the &quot;Fear of Missing  <br/>
Something Syndrome&quot;. Like if they don&#39;t know everything there is to  <br/>
know about anything they&#39;re interested in, something&#39;s amiss.<br/>
<br/>
On the adding a decimal point to a child&#39;s age, I used to add the half  <br/>
year or whatever to my daughter&#39;s age, but I realized that tacking on  <br/>
the months/half years/ made me expect more of her somehow - like she  <br/>
should understand everything better with every passing month. Years  <br/>
gave me a better overall picture of how and what she learned and how  <br/>
her personality was evolving. She&#39;s 16, not 16.4 years. See how odd  <br/>
that reads at that age?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Everyone is doing what they enjoy doing:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your kids are happy doing what they&#39;re doing, enjoy it. If they&#39;re  <br/>
restless or needing something else, have ideas to offer (including  <br/>
going outside). Be prepared to accept &quot;no, thanks&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you feel discouraged when your kids resist or say no to  <br/>
your brilliant ideas? It&#39;s okay! That&#39;s not failure on your part.  <br/>
Offer an idea again sometime or allow it to drop. Kids will remember  <br/>
if it&#39;s important to them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; much screen time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or, the weather is so nice outside, we need to be outside more. ( I  <br/>
&gt; do manage to get us to play outside at least once a day)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a thread I&#39;ve noticed in your posts and questions. &quot;Too much  <br/>
&#39;screen time&#39;&quot; and &quot;I manage to get them/I encourage them to be  <br/>
playing outside every day/once a day&quot; instead of what they&#39;re enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
Does your family (spouse/extended family) have issues with these  <br/>
things or is it just your own worries? You&#39;ve been seeing how  <br/>
unschooling can work and you write about it (though your kids are not  <br/>
school-age, so it&#39;s mostly peaceful parenting at this point). I&#39;m  <br/>
wondering if you&#39;re feeling external pressure to live up to some ideal.<br/>

I have 2 young minecraft players here. My daughter is almost 6, my son 7 and<br/>
1/2 :-)<br/>
<br/>
Installing new mods he wants. Especially right at the minute he asked me to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do it. (But I can&#39;t. I really need alone time to do it. Otherwise I cannot<br/>

and everything breaks...  I too can not figure it out if constantly<br/>
interrupted.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you can find time to play with him, get yourself an account, set up a<br/>
craft bukkit server and follow his lead to help him build the stuff he<br/>
wants. You could learn a lot from it and it&#39;s great fun :-) Craft bukkit<br/>
will let you set up a peacefull server with hardly any monster if your son<br/>
wants to be able to concentrate on building things and exploring.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t let him go to adult servers alone. He will get kicked and banned. He<br/>
could be insulted too. Most servers have a lot of role playing going on,<br/>
they have building standards... letting your 5 year old play alone on their<br/>
servers would be like taking him to the model making room in an architecture<br/>
school, armed with scissors and glue and letting him &quot;loose&quot;. People will<br/>
get mad and kick him out and its not fair on anybody. If you want to go to<br/>
adult servers, go with him, do the chatting for him, help him every step of<br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
You need to find servers that are friendly for young kids and will forgive<br/>
him doing a little grief. And even there, you probably need to stay close<br/>
when he plays multi player. And you might need to help him with the<br/>
diplomacy side. Apologise for him if he brakes something by accident, be an<br/>
ambassador online for him and help other players understand he is only 5 and<br/>
means no harm.<br/>
<br/>
There is an yahoo list for unschooling gamers, I have found very friendly<br/>
young minecraft friends for my kids there :-)<br/>
<br/>
Another great thing, probably the best, is to setup a server and help his<br/>
real life friends setting up their own accounts so they can play together<br/>
(you need to discuss that with the other children&#39;s parents of course. That<br/>
works best for cousins or if you have friends whose kids are friends with<br/>
your child).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; minecraft gathering (in person).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Voice chat works nicely for us. My kids both have a gmail account with gtalk<br/>
chat enabled. They can contact their friends who also have gmail accounts to<br/>
chat with their real life friends. They love voice chatting while playing<br/>
minecraft together. It helps them decide what to build, where, and roleplay<br/>
in their minecraft world.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Creativity<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe set up projects, for example, build a city with other players.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have a theme.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also I have been thinking about incorporating architectural design<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; concept, visiting with some architects, learning drafting or making<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; model buildings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Woooah! You might need to get realistic and lower your expectations here.<br/>
Your son is only 5! Building a house for himself and maybe along with a<br/>
friend and big huge towers that go miles up... or funky pyramids... One of<br/>
our friend player is developping an &quot;architectural eye&quot;, starting to want<br/>
his building to look less bulky and getting interested in design. But he is<br/>
11. All the 5 year old I have seen playing build big bunkers, love blowing<br/>
up stuff with TNT and adopting wolves.<br/>
<br/>
I mean if your son is into architecture, by all means support him. But you<br/>
might want to pay close attention to what is fun to HIM.<br/>
<br/>
He asked me so many questions that I couldn&#39;t answer. So I bought books with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lots of pictures in it. Sometimes we compared what we found to the book.<br/>
&gt; Also I got him the excavation kit with rocks buries in it. He had fun<br/>
&gt; digging them out and comparing with the information sheet. When I take him<br/>
&gt; to the store, he never wanted to leave.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know how to support his interests. So what I had in mind was to<br/>
&gt; study the subject more myself and help him out when he needs information. Or<br/>
&gt; lay the information out and see if he is interested in knowing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is it too much or not? I am not sure lots of time myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only he can say what&#39;s too much. Take the cues from him :-)<br/>
<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t want to leave the store, it sounds like it&#39;s not too much for<br/>
him. Educating yourself yo you have info available when he asks sounds like<br/>
a good idea, discovering stuff together and sharing excitement are very good<br/>
way to nurture both the learning and the relationship :-)<br/>

right now, I&#39;m writing a rather impassioned plea to you and hundreds of <br/>
other people to stop using the term &quot;screen time.&quot; Using that term is so <br/>
insulting it infuriates me -- it is as if the parent doesn&#39;t even care <br/>
at all what the child is really doing on the computer, tv, video game, <br/>
ipod, etc. Sandra talked about this the other day at a conference and <br/>
pointed out that people don&#39;t say: &quot;paper time&quot; (for reading books,, <br/>
magazines, newspapers, cereal boxes, etc).<br/>
<br/>
People talk as if being &quot;outside&quot; doing absolutely anything is better <br/>
than having &quot;screen time.&quot; Really? That&#39;s just so obviously lame. I saw <br/>
a mom tell a young child, about 5 years old, that it was &quot;outdoor time&quot; <br/>
and put her outside and shut and locked the door. The child stood with <br/>
her nose pressed on the back door glass and the mother turned her back <br/>
and said, &quot;Her choice; all I care about is that she spends some time <br/>
outdoors every day.&quot; Yeah - that was time really well spent (sarcasm). <br/>
Wonder what was going through that child&#39;s mind as she stood there?<br/>

<br/>
I do not know about this game but when my children were younger, they loved to build all sorts of things so we have kept hundreds of boxes of tissues and have built a wall, then another, then it became a castle. Then one day, we wanted to make room in the basement so we disassembled the castle, wall by wall and made a different construction in the room upstairs. DS used it as hiding place or as a wall. He had fun with it for years.<br/>

Yes, I found out keeping separate folders the hard way. I tried installing new mod and ended up deleteing DS&#39;s creation and screw up. Now I keep different folders just in case of conflicts, or at least for the time being while I am learning the ropes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37453720">Robin, spot on!<br/>
<br/>
It is very interesting that you point out my way of saying DS&#39;s age. Yes, I realize DS5.5 or DS5.75 has created a sense of urgency (wow, he is growing up! *_*). I see your point.<br/>
<br/>
Also you help me to see the external pressure I am dealing with that I was not fully aware of until you pointed out. Yes, I do feel pressure from my husband and my parents. They do support unschooling but they are shocked and feel uncomfortable with the amount of time DS spends on his computer. DH worries about DS missing other opportunities of doing different activities. My parents are concerned about his eye sight and health in general.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to be more creative. I wrestle with my son to help him to take a break (he loves wrestling with me). We do crafting and drawing in between (he cannot resist when I get art supply out and start doing things with my DD 2). Today we tried taking the computer to play in the library. He loved it. We had books on diamond, gold and silver handy. He loved looking through the books while taking a break.<br/>
<br/>
I am not concerned with my &quot;ideal&quot;. I just don&#39;t have a sense of doing too much or too little.<br/>

&gt; &gt; On the other hand, we are having fun everyday. Everyone is doing  <br/>

&gt; Good!<br/>

&gt; &gt; DD2.5 enjoys ipad coloring apps, matching numbers and letters to  <br/>
&gt; &gt; complete the coloring and gets rewarded with the music she likes and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; she dances to the music.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It might be better to think of your kids as 5 and 2 (unless they enjoy  <br/>
&gt; counting the months until the next birthday ie. &quot;I&#39;m 5 and 9 months&quot;).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW please do *not* take that as a suggestion to encourage your kids  <br/>
&gt; to think in those terms unless they want to! I sometimes get the  <br/>
&gt; feeling that you want to incorporate every single idea folks have here  <br/>
&gt; to somehow teach your kids something you think they now ought to know,  <br/>
&gt; because they haven&#39;t thought up themselves yet &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s what a friend of mine called &quot;FOMSS&quot; the &quot;Fear of Missing  <br/>
&gt; Something Syndrome&quot;. Like if they don&#39;t know everything there is to  <br/>
&gt; know about anything they&#39;re interested in, something&#39;s amiss.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the adding a decimal point to a child&#39;s age, I used to add the half  <br/>
&gt; year or whatever to my daughter&#39;s age, but I realized that tacking on  <br/>
&gt; the months/half years/ made me expect more of her somehow - like she  <br/>
&gt; should understand everything better with every passing month. Years  <br/>
&gt; gave me a better overall picture of how and what she learned and how  <br/>
&gt; her personality was evolving. She&#39;s 16, not 16.4 years. See how odd  <br/>
&gt; that reads at that age?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Everyone is doing what they enjoy doing:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your kids are happy doing what they&#39;re doing, enjoy it. If they&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; restless or needing something else, have ideas to offer (including  <br/>
&gt; going outside). Be prepared to accept &quot;no, thanks&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wonder if you feel discouraged when your kids resist or say no to  <br/>
&gt; your brilliant ideas? It&#39;s okay! That&#39;s not failure on your part.  <br/>
&gt; Offer an idea again sometime or allow it to drop. Kids will remember  <br/>
&gt; if it&#39;s important to them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Until...the thought crossed my mind: Oh, No...I am not doing enough  <br/>
&gt; &gt; and I am not doing the right thing. Instead of stimulating my  <br/>
&gt; &gt; children&#39;s sensory by creating all the wonderful ideas, I allow too  <br/>
&gt; &gt; much screen time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Or, the weather is so nice outside, we need to be outside more. ( I  <br/>
&gt; &gt; do manage to get us to play outside at least once a day)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a thread I&#39;ve noticed in your posts and questions. &quot;Too much  <br/>
&gt; &#39;screen time&#39;&quot; and &quot;I manage to get them/I encourage them to be  <br/>
&gt; playing outside every day/once a day&quot; instead of what they&#39;re enjoying.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does your family (spouse/extended family) have issues with these  <br/>
&gt; things or is it just your own worries? You&#39;ve been seeing how  <br/>
&gt; unschooling can work and you write about it (though your kids are not  <br/>
&gt; school-age, so it&#39;s mostly peaceful parenting at this point). I&#39;m  <br/>
&gt; wondering if you&#39;re feeling external pressure to live up to some ideal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-351347158">Thank you so much, Claire! <br/>
<br/>
Lots of practical and useful suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Minecraft is very rich game with things added on a daily basis. It was difficult for me to keep up with it. Finally I feel I have a grip on some basics now. Even DS cannot read yet, he has way passed me in big time.<br/>
<br/>
It is amazing to see DS5 and I have such different learning style. He has built hundreds of structures and torn all of them down since day one when he got his hands on minecraft. For me, I may start with &quot;the history of architecture&quot; and study it for a year before I ever build my first structure. Mine is a typical schoolish linear process of learning. His is through trial and error and learns as he goes. I love his way of learning and I should refrain myself from imposing my way.<br/>
<br/>
I will definitely try to play minecraft once I get things organized. Yes, I would get into those areas myself (architecture, geology). My son&#39;s passion definitely has inspired me. By making that long list (architecture or geology), I may have added my own strong desire of learning too. So instead of making that list for him, I may keep it for myself and I would have more to offer once DS needs it.<br/>

&gt; Bonjour Jihong,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have 2 young minecraft players here. My daughter is almost 6, my son 7 and<br/>
&gt; 1/2 :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Installing new mods he wants. Especially right at the minute he asked me to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do it. (But I can&#39;t. I really need alone time to do it. Otherwise I cannot<br/>
&gt; &gt; figure out how to do it with disruptions. He often cries because of that)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, mods can be hard to install and sometimes they conflict with each other<br/>
&gt; and everything breaks...  I too can not figure it out if constantly<br/>
&gt; interrupted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sit with and help him to read<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Join him to play. I haven&#39;t played myself. I have another child who needs<br/>
&gt; &gt; me and interrupts me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you can find time to play with him, get yourself an account, set up a<br/>
&gt; craft bukkit server and follow his lead to help him build the stuff he<br/>
&gt; wants. You could learn a lot from it and it&#39;s great fun :-) Craft bukkit<br/>
&gt; will let you set up a peacefull server with hardly any monster if your son<br/>
&gt; wants to be able to concentrate on building things and exploring.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I cannot sit with him all the time while I attend to other things. While I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am away, he gets banned from the servers because he doesn&#39;t read and cannot<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand what is going on in the server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t let him go to adult servers alone. He will get kicked and banned. He<br/>
&gt; could be insulted too. Most servers have a lot of role playing going on,<br/>
&gt; they have building standards... letting your 5 year old play alone on their<br/>
&gt; servers would be like taking him to the model making room in an architecture<br/>
&gt; school, armed with scissors and glue and letting him &quot;loose&quot;. People will<br/>
&gt; get mad and kick him out and its not fair on anybody. If you want to go to<br/>
&gt; adult servers, go with him, do the chatting for him, help him every step of<br/>
&gt; the way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You need to find servers that are friendly for young kids and will forgive<br/>
&gt; him doing a little grief. And even there, you probably need to stay close<br/>
&gt; when he plays multi player. And you might need to help him with the<br/>
&gt; diplomacy side. Apologise for him if he brakes something by accident, be an<br/>
&gt; ambassador online for him and help other players understand he is only 5 and<br/>
&gt; means no harm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is an yahoo list for unschooling gamers, I have found very friendly<br/>
&gt; young minecraft friends for my kids there :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another great thing, probably the best, is to setup a server and help his<br/>
&gt; real life friends setting up their own accounts so they can play together<br/>
&gt; (you need to discuss that with the other children&#39;s parents of course. That<br/>
&gt; works best for cousins or if you have friends whose kids are friends with<br/>
&gt; your child).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to set up skype for him to do video chat. Arrange<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minecraft gathering (in person).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Voice chat works nicely for us. My kids both have a gmail account with gtalk<br/>
&gt; chat enabled. They can contact their friends who also have gmail accounts to<br/>
&gt; chat with their real life friends. They love voice chatting while playing<br/>
&gt; minecraft together. It helps them decide what to build, where, and roleplay<br/>
&gt; in their minecraft world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Creativity<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe set up projects, for example, build a city with other players.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have a theme.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also I have been thinking about incorporating architectural design<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept, visiting with some architects, learning drafting or making<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; model buildings.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Woooah! You might need to get realistic and lower your expectations here.<br/>
&gt; Your son is only 5! Building a house for himself and maybe along with a<br/>
&gt; friend and big huge towers that go miles up... or funky pyramids... One of<br/>
&gt; our friend player is developping an &quot;architectural eye&quot;, starting to want<br/>
&gt; his building to look less bulky and getting interested in design. But he is<br/>
&gt; 11. All the 5 year old I have seen playing build big bunkers, love blowing<br/>
&gt; up stuff with TNT and adopting wolves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mean if your son is into architecture, by all means support him. But you<br/>
&gt; might want to pay close attention to what is fun to HIM.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He asked me so many questions that I couldn&#39;t answer. So I bought books with<br/>
&gt; &gt; lots of pictures in it. Sometimes we compared what we found to the book.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also I got him the excavation kit with rocks buries in it. He had fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; digging them out and comparing with the information sheet. When I take him<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the store, he never wanted to leave.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know how to support his interests. So what I had in mind was to<br/>
&gt; &gt; study the subject more myself and help him out when he needs information. Or<br/>
&gt; &gt; lay the information out and see if he is interested in knowing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it too much or not? I am not sure lots of time myself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only he can say what&#39;s too much. Take the cues from him :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If he doesn&#39;t want to leave the store, it sounds like it&#39;s not too much for<br/>
&gt; him. Educating yourself yo you have info available when he asks sounds like<br/>
&gt; a good idea, discovering stuff together and sharing excitement are very good<br/>
&gt; way to nurture both the learning and the relationship :-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have his legos out and play minecraft with the legos ( myï¿½ kids love to play pretend)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Md has cut wood just because of Minecraft! We have talked about how diamond is hard and gold is not. We have looked stuff up on Google. Lots of stuff, minerals and their hardness, the periodic table, but he is 9 and not 5 and that was interesting to him now. <br/>
&gt; I give him information and share stuff with him but I stop when I sense that he had enough.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We bought some rocksï¿½ at the museum that he keeps in his computer desk. He already has a rock collection which means he finds rocks and collects them. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When MD was Orion&#39;s age he wasï¿½ a big Robloxian. He played a lot of Roblox. He learned to read playing Roblox. It was something that just happened. <br/>
&gt; I sat with him and read what the other players were tying, I typed his answers. I helped him type by spelling, then he needed me less and less until he was reading fluently a year later . I did not turn Roblox into a reading lesson. He wanted to communicate and I helped him.<br/>
&gt; Reading happened. It may not be the same for Orion, he may not read until he is 10!<br/>
&gt; When MD wanted to build he watched videos and played. When he wanted to script doors, I read about LUA and scripted for him until he was doing it himself. I did not sit there and try to teach him to script. I just did it with him sitting there excited about it.<br/>
&gt; I have a lot more to write about all this but I haveï¿½ my sister&#39;s boys over until Wednesday as she is in California with my brother&#39;s family. He is in very critical condition at this moment from an accident andï¿½ I have not felt like or had time to write long posts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226700639">Good points, Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
I am feeling more and more at ease except &quot;freaking out&quot; once a while. :))<br/>
<br/>
I can see myself make big progress. In the past, I used to think &quot;tutors, classes, books, experts&quot; when I thought about &quot;supporting children&#39;s interest&quot;. Now I see a much bigger range of things that help to support my children&#39;s interest. But I know I am still schoolish and need more deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I love what you said &quot;instead of supporting interests, making their life more interesting. &quot; That changes my perspective.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t be a jittery tiger-mom of unschooling.&quot;, I shall remember that!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
<br/>
Jihong<br/>

&gt; -=-Until...the thought crossed my mind: Oh, No...I am not doing enough and I am not doing the right thing. Instead of stimulating my children&#39;s sensory by creating all the wonderful ideas, I allow too much screen time.<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions on my hesitation and confusion?-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes.  Stop reading so many different blogs. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You could spend hours every day reading a scattered range of opinions about how you are RUINING your child&#39;s LIFE!!   Don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly had a favorite other family for a long time, and really enjoyed the company of the kids her age, and liked the mom, and the mom had a baby, and Holly was really excited about that, but their contact was erratic and the parents were really controlling of time and place and schedule, and sometimes Holly was extremely welcome--they would pick her up and take her places--and other times, she would ask to come over and the answer was that they were too busy or it wasn&#39;t a good time.  And that was coming from the mom, not the kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Years passed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly talked to the son who&#39;s closest to her age.  What she found out was worse than she already knew.  The mom had never once kept the same goal/philosophy/plan for an entire school year.  It seems the mom&#39;s energy was all put toward changing, improving, finding the perfect way to be.  Her kids were in and out of various kinds of school and homeschooling, unschooling, Waldorf, charter, private, computer-focus, traditional public school.   The only constant was change.  And looking back and talking to her friend, Holly&#39;s summary to me was that what the mom wanted was for other moms to see her as a busily concerned mom who had researched The Best option of the moment, and would Do ANYthing to provide that for her children.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What she was providing for her children, though, was instability, a panicky, reactive mother who criticized them and the people around them all the time, and acted as though their lives would be RUINED if she didn&#39;t do something NOW!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t be that mom.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t be a jittery tiger-mom of unschooling.<br/>
&gt; Try to find calm and patience and acceptance, and then you&#39;ll find that you can think more clearly and there will be time to be quietly with your kids and you&#39;ll be better able to see what they themselves are interested in, without caring so much what people on blogs or this list THINK they should be interested in.  I think you&#39;re looking at them through filters instead of seeing them directly.<br/>

**Sandra talked about this the other day at a conference and pointed out that people don&#39;t say: &quot;paper time&quot; (for reading books, magazines, newspapers, cereal boxes, etc).**<br/>
<br/>
It used to be said of me &quot;she always has her nose in a book&quot;. I have a clear memory of my mother yelling at me &quot;Get your nose out of that book and go outside!&quot; I hid my book in my pants, went outside and sat under a tree to read. I was five. It&#39;s not that my mother didn&#39;t value reading, but she was worried that if she didn&#39;t make me get fresh air and excercise she&#39;d be a bad mother. :(  Being pushed over and over and over again to stop reading to go do something, anything else - that didn&#39;t help me learn to &quot;be balanced&quot; or whatever it was that people worried about. It actually pushed me more toward reading as defense, wall, the thing I did whenever I had a free chance. I LOVED reading but even more than that I would pick up a book whenever I could because I never knew when I might have the chance again.<br/>
<br/>
A mom bragged to me the other day that she&#39;d found the perfect way to &quot;discipline&quot; her 10yo daughter, who loves to read. &quot;Take away her fun reading, just leave her the learning reading.&quot; Ick.<br/>
