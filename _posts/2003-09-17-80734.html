<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497545983">I&#39;ve created a new Yahoo! group for people unschooling with serious <br/>
mental illness, called Unschooling and Serious Mental Illness. Here&#39;s <br/>
the description:<br/>
<br/>
This group is for those who are unschooling and dealing with serious <br/>
mental illness in the family.<br/>
<br/>
Often we find that as unschoolers we have a different mindset from our <br/>
more mainstream family and friends. This is a forum for getting together <br/>
with those who share a philosophy as well as a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be available for support and advice, as well as just being able to <br/>
hang out with someone who really does understand what we&#39;re going through.<br/>
<br/>
The link is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingMI/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingMI/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be posting this to all the new HEM lists and to Sandra&#39;s list, but <br/>
if you&#39;re on another Unschooling list, would you help spread the word, <br/>
please. I think this list will fill a real need that many families don&#39;t <br/>
know how to address.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872507975">Maybe a dumb question, but is the list for people who have (or their children have) mental illness (depression?  schizophrenia?) and unschool, or are you suggesting that anyone who unschools is mentally ill?  Certainly we are all off our rockers just a bit to want to do something that is considered strange by most of the population!<br/>

are also dealing with the challenges of schizophrenia, bipolar, and the <br/>
