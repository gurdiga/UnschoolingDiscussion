<div id="ygrps-yiv-444616530">Hi everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the abrupt departure a couple weeks ago. I may <br/>
continue to be a bit scarce here, but I&#39;m able to see my way clear <br/>
to at least popping in.<br/>
<br/>
My kids, hudband and I got whacked with the flu one after <br/>
another. Had to give up Valentine&#39;s celebrations, a ballet and a <br/>
field trip. :( I&#39;ve also had some business and private matters <br/>
encroach on my life for the last two weeks. Add it all up, and <br/>
keeping up with this very active list just wasn&#39;t possible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be reading along now and will jump back in as I get myself <br/>
back into posting/reading mode.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is going so well at our house. That&#39;s one thing I&#39;m <br/>
very grateful for. Thanks for all your help in getting us started.<br/>
<br/>

A LAST NAME!!!<br/>
You used a last name!<br/>
<br/>
How cute!<br/>
Nice name.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly came in while I was writing and asked who I was writing to.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kelly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do I know her?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is she the one who did the South Carolina conference?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s her last name?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lovejoy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Like &#39;Reverend Lovejoy&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Just the other day Holly told me the Simpsons characters have really <br/>
distinctive  names, except for Lisa.  She cited &quot;Millhouse.&quot;  I told her <br/>
about Richard Millhouse Nixon.<br/>
<br/>
I should make a collection of people&#39;s Simpson&#39;s-connections stories.<br/>
<br/>
Nixon.<br/>
Poe.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to watch Cape Fear because of the Simpsons, but only got halfway <br/>
through, was too horrified, and took it back to the rental shop.  Good thing <br/>
about rentals as opposed to paying full price for a full movie!  I can wimp <br/>
out without inconveniencing others.<br/>
<br/>

formerly Sandra Adams<br/>
<br/>
Holly says Adams sounds like a girlie name because she&#39;s only known females <br/>
named Adams.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263406089"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Julie Bogart<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a Julie Bogart on this list???  There was a girl at my high <br/>
school named Julie Bogart ... in little old Wintersville, OH.  It <br/>
couldn&#39;t be the same person, could it??<br/>
