<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023007372">Some people emailed me privately asking for a list of other unschooling lists so I though before I go I should post here since there was a recent post stating that there weren&#39;t a lot of other lists for unschoolers....I hope this can lay that one to rest.  Here are some lists that I have found.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling</a><br/>

Some of these are smaller groups but if they got more people to join and post they could be really good lists.  I hope to see you on some of them.  There are more for individual states so you might want to search for your state.  Hope that helps.  I think I&#39;ll post this list to the dotcom list since someone made a comment that there weren&#39;t many other unschooling lists.......I would hate for people to be misled into thinking that was the only list out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507830628">The Unschooling List is another such list and their definition would <br/>
appear to be much more unschooler and &quot;beginning&quot; unschooler <br/>
friendly.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://user.mc.net/~kwentz/ULfaq.html#UL_details.">http://user.mc.net/~kwentz/ULfaq.html#UL_details.</a><br/>
<br/>
Also, what unschooling.com has to say about unschooling-dotcom would <br/>
seem to be poles apart from what &quot;leading experts&quot; seem to have <br/>
decided this list is about: &quot;Unschooling.com&#39;s e-mail list, a hotbed <br/>
of conversation. No set topics, pretty much anything related to <br/>
unschooling goes- and we all know that means just about everything! <br/>
Another good way to get to know other people, and share opinions and <br/>
information about all sorts of things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have failed to find anything in this description which says if you <br/>
aren&#39;t a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler you should pack up your bags and head out <br/>
to find another list.<br/>

I read a lot of messages boards over there, like<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733701182">I paraphrased what has been said.  Yes indeedy, the terms &quot;pure&quot; and <br/>
keeping this list safe and people should go over to unschooling.com&#39;s <br/>
boards and read some more and people should go elsewhere have been <br/>
said which is what &quot;maybe this list isn&#39;t for you&quot; surely indicates.  <br/>
Perhaps not using the exact phrases I used but then I didn&#39;t use <br/>
quotes to indicate that was precisely how it was said.  The intent <br/>
was there.  <br/>
<br/>
In the interests of clarity, I like to see first hand what has been <br/>
said.  Or it could be because I never accept anything I read or hear <br/>
until I see it with my own two eyes.  So off I scooted to <br/>
unschooling.com to see for myself perchance to clarify why it seemed <br/>
some folks did protest too much.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think that&#39;s the way it gets read by some. Perhaps because when we are<br/>
in a learning position we are used to having others tell us what to do.<br/>
<br/>
But it is learning by learning to ask questions of yourself.<br/>
<br/>
(And every time the rewording of the quote is reposted, the beginning of it<br/>
is left off: *If* you want such-and-such, then maybe this isn&#39;t the place<br/>
for you. It is like saying, If you want recipes that contain animal<br/>
products, then maybe this vegan list isn&#39;t for you.)<br/>
<br/>
It means stop and think what *you* want. Stop and listen to what this<br/>
particular place has to offer.<br/>
<br/>
We may think we all want the same thing. We may think there is one best way<br/>
to find it. (It&#39;s what schools are based on.) But we all want something<br/>
different, even if we all call it unschooling. Just as we need to learn that<br/>
all children learn differently and need different things, adults need<br/>
different ways of learning and different atmospheres to learn it in. Some<br/>
may want support for whatever they are doing. Some may want a list full of<br/>
day in the life stories. Some may want a place that is nothing but positive<br/>
messages.  *If* one or more of those is so, then this isn&#39;t the list for<br/>
them.<br/>
