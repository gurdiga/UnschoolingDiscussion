<div id="ygrps-yiv-634813796">HEY???  I&#39;ve got a ??? ... I just received a book I bought from ebay ...<br/>
thankfully, the book arrived in perfect condition considering how it was<br/>
mailed!!!  the person used a manilla envelope wrapped the book in bubble<br/>
wrap to protect the books but that&#39;s it!!!   the other day I sold a book on<br/>
vegsource and I wrapped my pkg in a dept store shirt box BUT the postal<br/>
worker gave me the HARDEST TIME saying I couldn&#39;t insure the pkg b/c they<br/>
(po) wouldn&#39;t take responsibility since I&#39;d used a shirt box ... HUH???  my<br/>
pkg was more securely wrapped (I love using tape, btw, lots and lots of tape<br/>
&lt;G&gt;) ... anyone have any postal experiences???  these people drive me<br/>
*crazy* or should I say *POSTAL*!!!  haha ...<br/>
<br/>
