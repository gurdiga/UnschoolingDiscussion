<br/>
You guys would love the Grammar Lady. Go to the FAQ. She charges for specific <br/>
questions, but there is heaps of stuff I&#39;ve forgotten since school days for <br/>
freeee. I have definite weaknesses, but I welcome the lesson when people call <br/>
my mistakes to my attention. So feel free. :) (For instance: &quot;there is heaps <br/>
of stuff&quot; or &quot;there are heaps of stuff&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
From her site (FWIW):<br/>
<br/>
Q: I am having an ongoing discussion with a friend regarding the use of a <br/>
comma before the word &quot;and&quot; in a list. An example: I like apples, peaches, <br/>
plums, and pears. My friend says that I should omit the comma and write: I <br/>
like apples, peaches, plums and pears. Most of the textbooks that I have seen <br/>
that it is optional unless the sentence can be misunderstood with the comma <br/>
left out - but go on to say that it is better to use the comma to avoid any <br/>
possibility of misunderstanding. <br/>
<br/>
A: This has been discussed at length and on several occasions here. The <br/>
consensus is to use it--it takes so little effort, it is always correct, and <br/>
it may avoid confusion.</div>

Did you know that there are TONS of differences between journalistic <br/>
standards and academic ones?  <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I am having fun watching for changes, the comma thing you <br/>
mentioned is a good one.  My thing is using he and a third person <br/>
singular gender neutral pronoun.  It&#39;s what I learned and it is not <br/>
going to change.  He or she appears to be the current correct form.  <br/>
I personally think we should go with shheit - say it out loud.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387604921">All formatting and grammar &quot;laws&quot; are applicable to set areas.  If you are<br/>
doing &quot;formatting&quot; as in a typing class for credit at a jr/community college<br/>
for example, all sentences are followed by 2 spaces.  If you are doing type<br/>
setting typing for journalism classes, all sentences are followed by one<br/>
space.<br/>
<br/>
For Business English classes (and related classes), the &quot;bibles&quot; are Gregg<br/>
and HOW.<br/>
<br/>
If you are taking higher English classes, a lot of the schools use &quot;Little<br/>
Brown&quot; or another one I can&#39;t find right now.<br/>
<br/>
Journalism has a whole set of their own.<br/>
<br/>
And we wonder why ESL folks say that English is the hardest language to<br/>
learn &lt;g&gt;<br/>
