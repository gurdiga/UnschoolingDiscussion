If you take the steps to understand it even further, and to put it into <br/>
practice with your kids, you would find plenty of proof of their becoming <br/>
educated by learning from the activities and experiences of their everyday <br/>
lives that you would be able to explain what you were doing if it ever REALLY <br/>
mattered.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents keep a log of what kids learn at first so they can come to have <br/>
more confidence in natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like &quot;no instruction,&quot; it&#39;s like &quot;perpetual field trip&quot; (in <br/>
educator-concepts).  We visit the real world every day.  Schools take kids <br/>
into the real world maybe twice a year--a museum and a zoo, or a play and <br/>
something...<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s not one state or province where you can&#39;t unschool<br/>
at all.  In some, you have to jump through some hoops, but you can do it.<br/>
Number one - know the law where you live, not what someone else tells you it<br/>
says but what it actually says.  Then find people in your state or province<br/>
who unschool and find out how they comply with the law.<br/>

times. On weekends the pool is full and crazy; on weekdays at noon it is <br/>
lovely and quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I see a school trip I think of all the work and fuss (and money!) <br/>
that went into it, just to do something we can do anyday. Of course, I know <br/>
that many kids would never get to go to the museum, library, or theatre if <br/>
not for school trips.<br/>
