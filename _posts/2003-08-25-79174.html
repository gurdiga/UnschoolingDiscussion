really get to the point of feeling we have to escape the US!<br/>
<br/>
I think in most cases here the kids do have a choice about whether to go to <br/>
school or not and it&#39;s the kids pressuring each other to go.  What I hear is <br/>
that they want a larger social group or they want to &quot;feel normal&quot;.  My kids are <br/>
only 9 and 4 and I have learned to be humble about bridges I haven&#39;t crossed <br/>
with my kids yet.  But I can&#39;t help but feel that the parents must be sending <br/>
messages that school&#39;s the way to go.  Some of the parents are trying to <br/>
enlarge the homeschooling community for their teens.  But many seem to view high <br/>
school as homeschooling families (used to?) view college - well, we <br/>
homeschooled, but now we&#39;ll join the rest of the world.<br/>
