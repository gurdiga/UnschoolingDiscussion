&lt;&lt; But you do have a magic wand! We all do. It&#39;s just that we can only use it <br/>
 to work on ourselves, not others.<br/>
 <br/>
 My own private magic wand allows me to see, but not be affected by, the rude <br/>
 drivers, petty people and mean neighbors. I use it to allow my true self , <br/>
 that which is beyond this human form, to shine. My true self can&#39;t be <br/>
 bothered with petty grudges. They just flow on by. &gt;&gt;<br/>
    <br/>
Oh I know this!! :)<br/>
I just want to wave a wand though, it&#39;s much easier.<br/>
<br/>
The neighbors that have it in for us have started putting up lattice work <br/>
wherever our properties allow a view (which is everywhere on a tiny city <br/>
lot), so I guess I won&#39;t be able to see them much longer. YAY!<br/>
Put your intentions out to the universe and SEE what happens? :)hehe<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
