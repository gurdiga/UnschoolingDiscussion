One can never get enough of Lewis. Good suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago I read a fictional &quot;what if?&quot; account of Augustine, Martin <br/>
Luther, and C. S. Lewis, meeting in a bar in Newport Beach, CA. They sat, <br/>
drank, smoked, and discussed Christianity. It was wonderful, for what you got <br/>
was the essentials of the Christian faith without any of the cultural baggage <br/>
that tends to get laid on -- especially here in America. By the end of the <br/>
discussion, Luther (or Augustine, I can&#39;t remember) is really bummed because <br/>
Lewis has turned him on to cigarettes -- something he won&#39;t be able to get <br/>
when he goes back!<br/>
<br/>
Lutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer is another one to pay attention to. No <br/>
doubt you&#39;ve heard of him and probably read him. He was cast into prison <br/>
after being caught in a plot to murder Hitler. Hitler named him &quot;My personal <br/>
prisoner.&quot; Bonhoeffer was a chain smoker.<br/>
<br/>
Why have I twice mentioned smoking? Because it is the perfect example of <br/>
where American Christianity has gone wrong. American fundamentalist <br/>
Christians have failed to grasp the meaning of life. It is one thing for <br/>
puritan liberals (the heirs of the original New England Puritans) to make <br/>
life miserable for the country with their own sets of politically correct <br/>
Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts -- they can&#39;t help it, it&#39;s their patrimony. It is a whole <br/>
other thing for people who follow Christ to do such a thing. Christ, who came <br/>
to give abundant life -- life which includes eating, drinking, conversing, <br/>
laughing, dancing, playing, having sex for pleasure, and ... smoking.<br/>

What is the title of the book? Sounds interesting...<br/>

I had to laugh wne I read this! :-) One thing I have liked about  Lewis, Tolkien ( and the hobbits in LOTR), Chesterton - is their embracing of life and of what others may call &#39;vices&quot; - like smoking and drinking!..Leonie<br/>

It was an essay in a magazine called -- are you ready? -- Modern Reformation. <br/>
The sponsors also have a weekly radio show called The White Horse Inn (which <br/>
was a pub, of all places!, where Reformation ideas made their entrance into <br/>
England). I&#39;m not sure if the back issue is available, but I will search my <br/>
back issues to see if I still have it.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, the website for magazine, radio show, and other links is: <br/>
