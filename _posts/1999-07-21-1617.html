<div id="ygrps-yiv-830660608">I am near Cleveland, Ohio...about 20-25 minutes West.<br/>
<br/>
Glenmont is in West orange, NJ.  it is huge estate from what I understand.  <br/>
The house is closed to the public until 2001 because it is undergoing <br/>
renovations.  but I understand there are other buildings open to the public, <br/>
a lab I believe is open.  I have some brochures somwhere around here on it.  <br/>
His estate is right next to the Henry Ford estate, they were big time buds.<br/>
<br/>
We live about 45 minutes from Edison&#39;s birthplace her in Milan, Ohio.  it was <br/>
so cool to tour his house and see his family treasures and learn from a guide <br/>
about his family.  We are doing a unit on Thomas edison right now using <br/>
Beyond five in A Row as a guide.  We are reading Thomas Edison, Young <br/>
Inventor.  it is easy reading or the boys and they are enjoying the cool <br/>
acitvities we are doing.  Sometimes I need a lot of help being creative and <br/>
B5IAR is a great guide for me.  The boys wanted a summer of science and <br/>
agreed Thomas Edison would be the man to study.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to build door bells, code buzzers, a light bulb, and an electric <br/>
pen.  Along with all of the cool science experiments we are going to be doing <br/>
for the fun of it!  Everything is done informally and as we get the chance.  <br/>
And they are happy that they are not being forced to do math and workbooks <br/>
and stuff like that anymore, hahaha.  And oddly enough, they are not fighting <br/>
me on doing any of this cool science stuff either....why, they are actually <br/>
enjoying it I dare say :-)<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it is time to go waterproof some wood and figure out how long it <br/>
takes for sound to reach our ears.  if the boys like, maybe we will even <br/>
start on sign language.  who kows what the day will bring....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all of the info on the Indy Museum... and the other things to see <br/>
there!  The Cleveland Science Museum is really cool too, but it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
to compare to Indy&#39;s.  Ahhhhh, checking my calendar.....<br/>

What exactly is/are these five in a row &quot;things&quot;...books??  I&#39;ve heard them <br/>
referred to before but never a real explanation of what they are...would it <br/>
be age appropriate for a 14yo girl?  Information, Please!!<br/>
