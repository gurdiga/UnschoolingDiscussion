saw it. Since you didn&#39;t tell me your userid, I had to page through the <br/>
entire list of members to see if any had your email address. I finally <br/>
found it and it appears to be working just fine. I don&#39;t have access to <br/>
whatever password you put in, but I can give you a new one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411829924">Sorry, Pam, I was not in a good mood yesterday, and had a severe headache to<br/>
go with it.  Actually, I figured out after you wrote me there must be a<br/>
software glitch.  I put in LadyWolf55 as my user id, and you told me it<br/>
saved &quot;Teresa&quot; which is what I put in the &quot;Name&quot; area, not the user ID.   I<br/>
will try it one more time, using Teresa, and see what happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495885372">For the information of others who may want to go check out the new <br/>
discussion boards at &lt;www.unschooling.info/forum&gt;, there was, I am <br/>
happy to report, no technical glitch in the software, it worked <br/>
perfectly. The person posting the complaint simply forgot what she&#39;d <br/>
put in as her userid and was trying to use the wrong one.<br/>
<br/>
That said, sometimes technical problems DO happen and I&#39;m sure some <br/>
will happen to us at some time. I hope people will understand that the <br/>
message boards, like this list, are a cooperative project of a group of <br/>
unschooling moms and that we&#39;re doing this as a public service, not <br/>
being paid.  Even creating the message boards was quite a challenge, <br/>
none of us had ever done it before and had to learn a lot to accomplish <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
So, support our efforts by joining the message boards and <br/>
participating. As great as this list is, message boards have some real <br/>
advantages over lists.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of all messages coming into your mailbox, in the order posted, <br/>
they are all nice and organized for you, by topic. Since all posts on a <br/>
topic are together, it makes for far more coherent reading. The message <br/>
boards are also far more easily searchable (have you tried to use the <br/>
search function in yahoogroups to find some old post from this list?).  <br/>
You can go back and edit your own posts, after you&#39;ve posted them. You <br/>
can start your own topics.  You can even &quot;subscribe&quot; to be notified <br/>
when there are new posts on the message boards, either any posts at <br/>
all, or posts in particular topics of your choosing.<br/>
<br/>
So - come and join us at &lt;www.unschooling.info/forum&gt;.<br/>
