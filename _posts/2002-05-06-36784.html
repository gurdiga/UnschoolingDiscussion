<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649575578">&lt;&lt;But my real point is that students in public school are not CONDITIONED to think about whay they&#39;re really interested in.  The system tells them what they are to learn and when without any thought to what the PERSON really is interested in doing.  Such training leads to a waste of time in getting where they really want to go.  But this is something they find out years later.&gt;&gt;<br/>

My sister is a classic case of this. When we were in hs (we are only 1 year apart), we were always being asked things like, what college are you going to go to? what do you want to do with the rest of your life? I was always so stressed about it. I felt like we had to give an answer and that was what we had to do. For me, my answer was always the same, I would apologetically say, I want to get married and have children. I also wanted to teach and to be a nurse. But I knew I didn&#39;t want to go to college. But the pressure was on... For me, I became pregnant at 18 and was no longer &quot;worthy&quot; of college, as my dad put it. But as for my sister, she was not going to end up like me, (married with a baby at age 18) so she went to college. She went to a community college for 2 years, then off to a university for 3 more years. And you know, she doesn&#39;t even hold any degree... no kidding, not an AS or AA or Bachelor... nothing. She can&#39;t tell me one thing she &quot;learned&quot; there, except, don&#39;t take student loans. She now works as a waitress in a nice restaurant, she has a 1 year old son, and a live in boyfriend, who also works as a waiter. They do not live a nice life wealthy lifestyle, like she thought she&#39;d have after 5 years of college. I now have 4 kids, I teach (unschooling) I get to be nurse any time they are sick or hurt and I am married. My sister tells me often that she envies me, because I did what I wanted, not what was expected. My  point here is, we all need to follow our own dreams, not others expectations. I think this is partly why I love Unschooling. I have always wanted my children to follow their dreams. <br/>
