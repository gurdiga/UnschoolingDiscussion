<br/>
I feel inarticulate here.<br/>
<br/>
I meant that I didn&#39;t think it was inappropriate for the poster to point out <br/>
when he or she felt  misunderstood after someone commented on their post.  <br/>
<br/>
I did not mean that we should all pick on individul posters and point out <br/>
what about that post we didn&#39;t like.  In fact, that&#39;s the exact opposite of <br/>
what I meant.  I was trying to say that it should be okay for a poster to <br/>
say...Wait a minute, I don&#39;t like the comment you made about my post...I <br/>
didn&#39;t mean it that way.  Or that it should be okay for the poster simply to <br/>
point our their own sensitivities.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m trying to be general, when I should be more specific. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s clear as mud, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

ourselves here on this list as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are definitely ways of saying things that are more sensitive <br/>
and more considerate, without taking away from honesty and forthrightness.<br/>
<br/>
For example, sometimes just the way something is stated in black and white <br/>
can help.  Sometimes when people take time just to word things differently, <br/>
it helps.  <br/>
<br/>
Diplomacy is something I&#39;ve always strived for and hope my children see.  <br/>
It&#39;s different than being weak and not being able to take a stand.<br/>

I&#39;m glad you brought this up because I&#39;ve been so frustrated with my <br/>
inability to articulate that this is what I meant in the first place...that I <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong to remind any people, all people, people on this list <br/>
and otherwise, that we can still address grievances or issues with diplomacy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard in this format, because if we were conversing and I had written <br/>
something about the diaper training analogy and somebody said something <br/>
different than what I meant, I could just say...Oh, I didn&#39;t mean it that <br/>
way.  Here is what I meant.<br/>
<br/>
In this online format, I sometimes go days between reading and posting what <br/>
other people have written and it&#39;s hard to explain sometimes what I really <br/>
mean.  I&#39;m new at it too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s enough.  I&#39;m sorry I kind of got away from what I think you <br/>
want to do here by addressing how we work this issue with our kids.  Still <br/>
just a bit frustrated.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m really saying anything that&#39;s so <br/>
far from what anybody thinks.  I just can&#39;t seem to spit it out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do too - but it isn&#39;t a clearcut line for me - there are times when <br/>
seemingly rude and undiplomatic people have made things nice and clear for me <br/>
and I&#39;ve really appreciated it. There are other times that people have said <br/>
things and been accused of being rude when I thought what they said was far <br/>
from rude, it was absolutely the most brilliant coherent clearthinking <br/>
inspiring thing I&#39;d read in a year. I don&#39;t feel competent to say: &quot;That was <br/>
unnecessarily undiplomatic.&quot; I just don&#39;t KNOW - it may have been EXACTLY the <br/>
blunt, to-the-point statement that someone needed to hear. Even if that <br/>
someone is sensitive or gets their feathers ruffled. I KNOW for a fact that <br/>
sometimes they go away and think about it and come back for more, later, <br/>
gratefully expressing appreciation for the directness they had previously <br/>
confused with rudeness.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
The first few years I was online and participating heavily in lots of <br/>
homeschooling discussions, one of the most GRATIFYING things I noticed was <br/>
that we all improved our ability to communicate in writing quite dramatically <br/>
over those first few years. It was awesome to watch it happening right before <br/>
our eyes. We unschooled ourselves into being &quot;writers.&quot; People who really <br/>
were pretty confusing and hard to follow in the beginning, got more and more <br/>
clear and, one of the most cooooool things, they developed their own <br/>
distinctive writing styles.<br/>
<br/>
We also learned that people simply need to hear things in really different <br/>
ways. I like to list things - point (1) and point (2) and so on. Some people <br/>
appreciate the organization of that kind of writing and others feel like it <br/>
is sort of cold and it turns them off. Everybody&#39;s style works better for <br/>
some people than for others.<br/>
<br/>
And - by the way - some people feel attacked and picked apart when people <br/>
respond to their posts point-by-point, quoting bits and responding, like I <br/>
have done here. I just want you to know, Caro, that I&#39;m not really intending <br/>
to do that to you - in fact, I ONLY do this when I think people have really <br/>
put an extra helping of good hard thinking into their posts and that there <br/>
are enough ideas there worth responding to point-by-point. <br/>
<br/>
  --pamS<br/>
Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>

who posts should be able to say Listen, you misunderstood me.  I agree with <br/>
you that on the list it messes up the discussions.  That doesn&#39;t stop  me <br/>
from thinking that, theoretically, we could all try to be more diplomatic.  I <br/>
agree that you&#39;re right.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily help to point out to OTHER <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True.  Is anything really clearcut.  Again, however, I wasn&#39;t talking about <br/>
ME judging other&#39;s posts to  put on a label of diplomatic or not.  As Joyce <br/>
pointed out, I can only control my own actions.  The point of my posts has <br/>
been to try to encourage people on this list to think about these issues <br/>
while they&#39;re posting...not that we should all be quick to point out things <br/>
we didn&#39;t like after the posting has been done.<br/>

personal responsibility.  That we all might think about diplomacy and tact <br/>
when we post and that once in awhile, a general discussion about those issues <br/>
is not going to, IMHO, hurt anyone.  I totally agree that we will never get <br/>
anywhere, and in fact will be pulled down into the muck, if we start judging <br/>
each person&#39;s comments as to whether or not they are considering other;s <br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
(2)  I agree that general reminders frequently lead to sidetracks and, as you <br/>
said, it&#39;s bad for the list.  Again I want to emphasize that  I didn&#39;t mean <br/>
that we should pick each other&#39;s posts apart for examples of diplomacy or <br/>
non-diplomacy(is that a word &lt;G&gt;?) <br/>
<br/>
 I just mean that I don&#39;t think it hurts to once in awhile have this <br/>
discussion...What is the difference between honesty and rudeness?  How can we <br/>
get a point across while striving not to hurt others?  These are topics I <br/>
think this list and many groups can address generally, without necessarily <br/>

isn&#39;t a standard, and people draw the line different places.<br/>
<br/>

and potentially dangerous critique or information.   Some other people think <br/>
that would be a total waste of time and wouldn&#39;t bother to belong to a list <br/>
that was basically a teaparty.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; How can we  get a point across while striving not to hurt others?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you can do it, then you do it.  If you think you can get a difficult point <br/>

<br/>
If we say &quot;breastfeeding is good,&quot; someone breaks down in tears and says we <br/>

the reader, waiting to be touched, after which she says &quot;YOU WERE <br/>

dogs when I&#39;m a vegetarian, you said unschooling is best when you start <br/>
early, and my child is thirTEEEEEEN!!!!&quot;<br/>
