<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035203075">I was surfing the &#39;net last night while the kids watched TV (I&#39;m rather thankful for 24/7 cartoon shows with sick children who are awake at 0200!!!) and I came across the coolest looking flute..it&#39;s PURPLE with silver keys! Guess what I&#39;ll have one of come &quot;Taxmas?!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve put off getting a new flute for years because of the kids and I decided that I have GOT to get one and get back into playing, even if all I do is play for church once in awhile...there will be time enough when the kids are a little older to commit to a community band again...<br/>

None of the my kids have yet to express an interest in playing a musical<br/>
instrument. They are really not familiar with that. Maybe I will get back<br/>
into playing the flute. I guess even with the kids, it could be fun. And if<br/>
they come in colors...........<br/>

The flute I found is actually through JCPenney, but I&#39;m sure they are also out there elsewhere! It&#39;s just a student flute, I&#39;m by no means a professional LOL but the price is reasonable ($249.99) and there is also a small warranty. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26639265">A mom on my Feingold Program list posted today that<br/>
she found out that the school teacher was giving her<br/>
son food almost daily that he is allergic/sensitive to<br/>
even though she had sent a letter specifically stating<br/>
he was only to have food that she sent from home, and<br/>
then the same teacher then was denying him lunch until<br/>
he finished his work, and several times this week he<br/>
didn&#39;t get lunch at all!<br/>
<br/>
The mom went ballistic, rightly so, and contacted the<br/>
school board, the principal, and the news media.  The<br/>
school said it was their policy to deny lunch until<br/>
classroom work was done.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder kids have eating disorders, when food is<br/>
given as rewards and taken away as punishment, and<br/>
everyone in the room knows who has been good or bad by<br/>
who is allowed to eat in front of the others.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you to this list for<br/>
showing me the wrong thinking about limitations and<br/>
rewards and punishments!  I am even more determined to<br/>
free my kids from such heinous chains.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Abraham Maslow is required information in every college of education as far <br/>
as I know, and yet all these professionals have decided that withholding food <br/>
is a way to get kids to learn!?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait.  Maybe these things like &quot;silence in halls&quot; don&#39;t REALLY happen in <br/>
schools.  <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the enemies of schools who are making up those stories so <br/>
everybody will homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Are there internal agents at work trying to cause schools to make themselves <br/>
look SO horribly bad that sweeping school reform will be inevitable and <br/>
homeschooling will be seen as the highest virtue!??<br/>
<br/>
Schools should just make themselves so perfectly good and calm and sweet that <br/>
we can&#39;t do anything else but feel bad for depriving or children of the <br/>
experience, but instead they&#39;re making us look better and smarter without us doing <br/>
ANYTHING.<br/>
