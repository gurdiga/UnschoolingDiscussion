 I hope that is true, I would hate to get in &quot;trouble&quot; for truency or<br/>
 something.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I called the local school board and then the State Dept. of Ed to get info <br/>
here in FLA -- maybe you could do the same to confirm -- it sounds neat in <br/>
Idaho!<br/>

Unfortunately, I do think our laws are &quot;blue book&quot; laws and not forward<br/>
thinking on the part of Idaho.  They just never got around to addressing<br/>
homeschooling in depth.  After all, we have an estimated 20,000 polygamists<br/>
(Mormons) in this state still!  But I have met some very sophisticated<br/>
families who are very open to alternatives to &quot;traditional&quot; ideas, but most<br/>
of them are transplants from other places.  <br/>
<br/>
Where I happen to live the main employer (and the second largest in the<br/>
state) is the Government Nuclear Reservation where my husband works in<br/>
engineering disposal and cleanup processes.  There are a lot of educated<br/>
folks from different parts of the country/world who have come here to work.<br/>
 But we also have about a 70 or 80% Mormon community here, and it is an<br/>
interesting experience to live in such a fundamentally religious community.<br/>
 I grew up in San Francisco, which was very different, to say the least.<br/>
My main worry is being unable to find social outlets for my kids that are<br/>
open to unschooling and not religiously oriented.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note however, we love to camp, learn about and view nature<br/>
and wildlife and there is lots of wilderness area here, including the very<br/>
first National Park, Yellowstone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257585003"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;thanks, that&#39;s good to know because tx is too hot for me and idaho has always<br/>
&gt;seemed like a place i would like (i&#39;ve lived in over a dozen states but not<br/>
&gt;idaho, yet:)<br/>
&gt;-susan<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Texas is too hot for me too, phew!  Makes me hot just thinking about it!  I<br/>
have a brother in Dallas.  I grew up in San Francisco, so I am really<br/>
spoiled as far as weather goes.  Over there, you usually have about 30-40<br/>
degrees in variation of temperature in the city all year, and there are no<br/>
appreciable seasons really.  Just fog, rain, or sunshine and temperatures<br/>
vaying bewteen 40 some to 70 some.  Anything above or below that is<br/>
extremely unusual.<br/>
<br/>
When I moved away as an adult I had to get a whole new wardrobe.  I had noo<br/>
summer clothes, and no winter clothes.  My warmest Jacket was a leather<br/>
bomber jacket, which did not stand up very well to more extreme winters,<br/>
and the first place I lived after SF was Albequerque NM so I did not have<br/>
clothes suitable for that hot weather either.  I have discovered that I do<br/>
much better in cooler or colder weather than in hot.<br/>
<br/>
We are relatively new here, having moved permanently in March.  However, we<br/>
did go through the winter here in 98, as DH was working in town on a temp.<br/>
basis at that time.  Our summers here (in SE Idaho) have about 2 weeks of<br/>
moderately hot weather (not breaking 100, usually not breaking 90)<br/>
surrounded by pleasant weather.  The winters are cold, but we still don&#39;t<br/>
have any snow yet this year, and there is usually not more than a foot or<br/>
so on the ground here at any one time.  The falls are long and leisurely<br/>
with lots of color and the springs are long and punctuated by entertaining<br/>
storm cells that whip through on their way to flatter country in Tornado<br/>
Alley.<br/>
<br/>
We are enjoying the &quot;small town&quot; feel here, with a pop. of about 30-40,000,<br/>
which is quite a large drop for me.  We are still finding our social niche,<br/>
but are beginning to make friends.  We love the geography, being on a high<br/>
plateau surrounded by mountains and with the Snake river running throught<br/>
the center of town.  We are about 1.5 hrs south-west of Yellowstone and<br/>
closer to Grand Teton Natl Park, so have been to both several times since<br/>
we moved here.  We actually have quite a few nice ammenities in town, that<br/>
we are still discovering.  Biggest surprise: Our little town has a zoo,<br/>
complete with penquins, lions and tigers, primates, snow leapards, etc, etc<br/>
(but no elephants :-(   ...yet)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289977867">I need some info for a friend. His son is 7 and in PS. They have <br/>
diag. him w/ all sorts of disorders and placed him in special ed. He <br/>
refuses to write for them yet reads at a 6th grade level. He isn&#39;t <br/>
violent or aggressive he just refuses to cooperate at times. So it <br/>
has gotten out of hand at the school. Here is a young child who is <br/>
intelligent and questioning. So he doesn&#39;t fit the mold. Also he is <br/>
very artistic as is the whole family line. The father is divorced and <br/>
the mother is on/off about removing him from school. The father has <br/>
offered to pay full time tutors but the school refuses. Now the <br/>
school is pressuring him to leave him in school. The father went to <br/>
see his lawyer and the lawyer quit b/c conflict of interest;his firm <br/>
reps the school dist.. UGH! All he wanted was to know his legal <br/>
rights.<br/>
<br/>
  I was crying last night when dh was telling me about his friend&#39;s <br/>
son. The father is very worried his son is just going to become more <br/>
discouraged and develop more avoidance techniques. I agree he will <br/>
never flourish in this situation.When he described the boy&#39;s <br/>
behaviors and tendancies it was exactly like our daughter. You can <br/>
not sit her down to a task,she looses interest unless it was her <br/>
idea,she is in motion alot. So on and So on. This is why we know <br/>
unschooling is the way and I am speaking w/ him this weekend about <br/>
it. Dh and I were thinking he could hire a nanny and go w/ the flow<br/>
(unschool). <br/>
<br/>
   Now legally he needs advice about pulling him from school. Also <br/>
being divorced causes an added dimension. He has to get his ex on <br/>
board. This is in Idaho. From what I know we have no regulations <br/>
reguarding homeschooling,so why would there be a problem pulling him <br/>
from school. Except that the school has labled this child special ed.<br/>

<br/>
Financial incentive for the school-- more income for special ed than other <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Worst case scenario might be school accusing the family of educational <br/>
neglect, but if he can afford tutors, they might possibly still want to go <br/>
with a tutor at first (with homeschooling) to appease any lurking observers, <br/>
or he might want to sign him up with Clonlara or another distance school so <br/>
that he is legally &quot;enrolled in school&quot; and the school can shove off.<br/>

<br/>
My son is 7, reads fluently (4th grade level or above) and won&#39;t write a<br/>
lick.  (He doesn&#39;t find it easy even to write his name.)  Unschooling is<br/>
working great for us.  We&#39;ve done it from the get go.<br/>
<br/>
My son is definitely not the &quot;do it because I say so&quot; type.  Sometimes I<br/>
joke that the school system should pay me to keep him at home, because I<br/>
know he would be pretty subversive in the classroom.  Unfortunately, that&#39;s<br/>
not the way the funding flows.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there is any kind of moral support I can give.  Your friend&#39;s<br/>
story really speaks to me.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t already completely familiar with the Idaho laws, you can find<br/>
them at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org">http://www.nhen.org</a>    (somewhere).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know a lot about homeschooling as a single parent, but there may be<br/>
a folder for that at the unschooling.com website.  A kid who reads a lot can<br/>
learn a lot even with a minimally talented babysitter just available to<br/>
watch him during the day.  Lots of the interactive learning can take place<br/>
with the dad in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Betsy</div>
