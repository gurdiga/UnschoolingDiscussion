<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069774793">I am loving this thread<br/>
I decided a few weeks ago to make myself a list of books because I have <br/>
lost my reading self somewhere so I really wanted to spend the summer <br/>
reading! (I LOVE READING)<br/>
I just read unassisted Childbirth by Laura Shanley<br/>
whoo hoooooo great book!<br/>
I am adding to my list and then all these great kiddie books<br/>
I thought well I will make a list for my daughter (and son....who knows <br/>
maybe he will get the reading bug!)<br/>
We can all read (maybe we can trade books!)<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
POD.......any other suggestions would be great</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338642012">Since I&#39;m having a spot of bother with my email reader (anyone <br/>
familiar to the point of boredom with pegasus, please mail me off-<br/>
list &lt;g&gt;) I&#39;ve rediscovered this message, and just wanted to say, if <br/>
you&#39;re into books on childbirth, there are a few by a British <br/>
midwife called Nicky Wesson.  I read Home Birth and <br/>
Alternative Maternity while I was pg with dd2, affirmed stuff I <br/>
already believed and told me more stuff to make me even more <br/>
sure &lt;g&gt;  And Birth of a Mother is turning out to be a really great <br/>
read, I&#39;m gaining a lot of insight into some stuff that&#39;s gone on <br/>
between me and dd1.<br/>
