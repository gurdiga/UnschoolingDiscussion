&lt;&lt; FYI, that&#39;s not in the book, which we love. ~Rue<br/>

 &quot;We rented a DVD recently called &quot;Mama, do you love me?&quot; where the<br/>
 little <br/>
 Inuit girl kept getting into trouble with her mother and the mother <br/>
 eventually says &quot;I love you but you must obey.&quot; or something like that&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rue is right on. It&#39;s not in the book at all. The book is a lovely example of <br/>
unconditional love. AND, it&#39;s got the artwork of Barbara Lavalee, an Alaskan.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475955546">I love the artwork, Ren, and learning new words that you&#39;ve probably<br/>
always known :0).  &quot;Yes I do dear one&quot; is a favorite line at our house.<br/>
