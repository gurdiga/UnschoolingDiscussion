today and we all looked at it together. We got as far as opening up the <br/>
heart. There were lots of &quot;yucks!&quot; and &quot;Ewwwws&quot; and &quot;Gross!&quot;, as well as a <br/>
good deal of peeking through fingers. As grossed out as they were, they were <br/>
also fascinated. We stopped when Casey&#39;s friend (who&#39;s only 6) started <br/>
looking like she&#39;d rather be doing something else. We moved on to playing <br/>
around with solargraphic paper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833215928">yes.. we, too loved the frog guts site..it was just gross enuf for my son to enjoy it.. but i&#39;m not as flexible as some;... i called his attention back to it when he drifted to cartoons.. (Yes.. tv in same room.. me and my kids tend to multi.. uh.. view? .. a lot .. ) dont think it hurt him too much.. and got him to the puzzle of the skeleton.. now there was something he could WIN.. this is very important to him.. must WIN.. so what the hell.. it got him to put the entire skeleton together.. et voila.. learned more in ten minutes than an entire day of boring school..<br/>
