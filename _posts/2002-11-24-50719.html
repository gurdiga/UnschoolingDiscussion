 I have tried and tried to post there.  It is too confusing for me.  Some <br/>
posts are old and you have no idea if anyone has responded to you unless you <br/>
remember where you posted.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You just have to know how to use them.<br/>
The easiest way is to scroll down to the bottom and click on &quot;new messages&quot;. <br/>
You can then enter your registered name and check all messages since you last <br/>
posted OR check all messages for the last day.<br/>
That way you will see any and all threads you&#39;ve recently posted in.<br/>
You can also hit &quot;keyword&quot; and have it search for a specific topic or word.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
