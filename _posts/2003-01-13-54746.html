<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006857788">Be happy.  Love life.<br/>
<br/>
I just want my children (and by extension, myself and dh) to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
I think healthy (physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually) is<br/>
necessary to be happy.  It&#39;s part of it, not separate.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Loving to learn&quot; is not my goal.  We learn everyday in whatever we do.<br/>
Learning is a natural part of being alive, like breathing.  Some people want<br/>
to limit the definition of &quot;real&quot; learning to &quot;academic&quot; ideas; some will<br/>
include social concepts; and others may just say &quot;positive things&quot; or<br/>
&quot;what&#39;s good for the child&quot; or &quot;what the child Needs to know.&quot;  I know<br/>
plenty of homeschoolers who do this.<br/>
<br/>
If my children are happy and love life, they will automatically love<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Paula used the phrase &quot;love to learn.&quot;  I think I&#39;d rather they &quot;learn to<br/>
love.&quot;<br/>
