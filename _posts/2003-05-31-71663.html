<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153628006">Oh, another Harrison Ford tidbit that redeems him a bit.<br/>
<br/>
In his spare time he&#39;s a helicopter pilot, and he volunteers doing rescue <br/>
missions. He&#39;s apparently saved a couple lives. Can you imagine being rescued by <br/>
Han Solo?<br/>
<br/>
Almost as interesting as searching out your birth mother and discovering that <br/>
it&#39;s Joni Mitchell.<br/>
