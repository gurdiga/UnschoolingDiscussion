<div id="ygrps-yiv-161247075"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am wondering if anyone knows of a good &quot;one stop shopping&quot;<br/>
&gt; resource for him to get a clearer picture of what we are about to embark<br/>
&gt; on.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I enjoyed Family Matters: Why Homeschooling Makes Sense by David Gutterson,<br/>
and I recall someone commenting here a while back that it seemed to go over<br/>
well with the guys.<br/>
<br/>
If you are Christian, I can say that Christian Unschooling by Teri Brown has<br/>
been the shortest introduction to unschooling I&#39;ve ever read, and I&#39;ve<br/>
really liked it.  It&#39;s very short and to the point.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be happy to wave Sandra&#39;s flag for her, and tell you that I found her<br/>
website very useful (www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling).<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time this year.  It&#39;s exciting!<br/>
