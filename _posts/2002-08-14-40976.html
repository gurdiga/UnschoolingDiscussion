&gt;&gt;... until a child is the<br/>

&gt;&gt; difference between unschooling and just not being in school yet?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned says: <br/>
There&#39;s a big difference. The attitude of public schools (and their rules)<br/>
says that children of a certain age belong in certain classes, regardless of<br/>
what they know and/or can do. Thus, as we&#39;ve read on this list, and often<br/>
hear from callers, children who are ahead of their age-mates are punished by<br/>
being made to sit through classes that bore them, and kids who are behind<br/>
are treated badly for that. In fact, hardly anbody fits the mould well.<br/>
<br/>
Children who will be going to school at age five are guided into that<br/>
experience by NOT being allowed to learn too much OR too little, but just<br/>
the right amount so that they&#39;ll fit into the school mould. Good readers are<br/>
not wanted in kindergarten classes, or even in first or second grade. The<br/>
schools normally have no way to deal with child who is advanced beyond the<br/>
class. Who suffers? The child. If a kid wants to do something that&#39;s not on<br/>
the school menu, forget it.<br/>
<br/>
And pre-school is designed to prepare kids for kindergarten, not to allow,<br/>
or even less encourage, them to investigate their real intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, Children whose parents plan to unschool grow up differently. The<br/>
parents turn the child loose to advance at his/her own pace in any area that<br/>
interests the kid. There&#39;s no reason to hold them back, and homeschoolers<br/>
know that schools do not often offer opportunities to express their true<br/>
intelligence, because the goal is not high achievement, but mediocrity -- a<br/>
large mass of middle-achievers. There are exceptions, but they&#39;re rare, and<br/>
they exist usually because a teacher is breaking the rules, and the schools<br/>
don&#39;t look kindly on such &quot;creative&quot; people.<br/>
