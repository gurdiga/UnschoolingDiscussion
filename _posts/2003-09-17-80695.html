<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984602310">Something more I thought about after I hit send: the big change <br/>
in our home wasn&#39;t whether or not to do chores. It was how I <br/>
understood serving my family. Sandra and a few others like Tia <br/>
and Ren shared about serving their families through housework, <br/>
laundry and meal making. If ther dishes were dirty after lunch <br/>
and no one thought to clear the table, they didn&#39;t yell or demand <br/>
or clear them in huff. They cleared them gladly and with love.<br/>
<br/>
THIS was the turning point for me. I realized I had fallen into the <br/>
trap of feeling I was owed service and clean up by my kids and <br/>
therefore grew resentful if they didn&#39;t keep their end of the <br/>
bargain I had coerced into existence.<br/>
<br/>
For the first two months, I kept my mouth shut about chores, <br/>
messes, undone laundry etc. If there was a mess, I picked it up if <br/>
it bugged me. And I said yes to every request I possibly could: <br/>
driving, playing games, arranging friends to play at our house, <br/>
watching movies together. I spent a huge amount of my energy <br/>
at sports events (games), driving my teens to their social lives, <br/>
purchasing art supplies and so on. I wanted my kids to know that <br/>
they mattered more to me than any other consideration in my life.<br/>
<br/>
Over time (multiple months), I got into a habit of service and not <br/>
resenting. (During this time, the kids still did help with <br/>
housework once a weekÂ—we held that over as we adjusted to <br/>
unschooling). But it was during this time that I discovered that we <br/>
could even re-think that weekly Sat. morning cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
By mid summer, life was just much more relaxed. There are <br/>
days when I have PMS and I get edgy about messes. But on the <br/>
whole, the spirit of the home has changed. And the spirit now <br/>
prevalent is consideration.<br/>
<br/>
And the heavy investment of my life into theirs (making their <br/>
dreams come true) has hit. They KNOW I&#39;m for them first. And <br/>
suddenly they are pouring out the love, support, help and service <br/>
I used to think needed coercion. It&#39;s wild!<br/>

**I enjoyed your posts, Julie.  I&#39;m glad things are working out so well for<br/>
your family.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never made the kids do housework (or anything else).  They are both<br/>
very helpful and are considerate in just the way you described.  ~Rue<br/>
