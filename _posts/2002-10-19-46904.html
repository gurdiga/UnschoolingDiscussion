<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101539823"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have tried so hard to encourage her, and to make her feel better<br/>
&gt; when she&#39;s feeling frustrated.  Her mood can switch like a<br/>
&gt; lightswitch when she gets frustrated from something.  She can go from<br/>
&gt; happy-go-lucky to hostile.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reflections from a perfectionist:<br/>
I hate when people try to make me feel better, and I will get hostile.  And<br/>
I&#39;m not 9, and I&#39;m well past the puberty horomnes, thanks!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She&#39;ll be playing the violin, and I&#39;ll tell her how nice it sounds,<br/>
&gt; and she&#39;ll get frustrated anyway, because it wasn&#39;t perfect.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When the sound in your ear didn&#39;t match the one in your head, it&#39;s pretty<br/>
frustrating.  The initial problem likely isn&#39;t you at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No, not lying.  ......  To me, it DOES sound beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, if it doesn&#39;t sound nice to her, that&#39;s her reality.  Your reality may<br/>
be that you don&#39;t hear the problem, but you can&#39;t make that her reality.<br/>
Can you wait until the end, or until she asks for your opinion?<br/>
<br/>
I truly hate to be talked to when I practice.  My mom learned to be around<br/>
where she could hear, in case I happened to shout, &quot;Wow!  Did you hear<br/>
that!&quot;, but out of sight, silent unless needed.<br/>
<br/>
From someone else,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe three ten minute sessions would be better for her than a solid half hour.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or even better, in my book, is knowing that there is no time limit on being<br/>
happy learning.  If you know you don&#39;t have to stay there, you can walk away<br/>
as needed and come back if desired.  Nobody learns best while pounding their<br/>
head against a wall, literally or figuratively.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, her attitude can come, often, from not wanting to be bothered.<br/>
&gt; Not wanting to contribute.  Not wanting to make an effort.  Ho hum.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe she truly doesn&#39;t want to be bothered.  Just because it doesn&#39;t look<br/>
to you like she&#39;s busy doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s not lost in thought.  You are<br/>
interrupting her.  I ask, but I&#39;m not offended by being put off or refused.<br/>
(Although around here, that&#39;s usually my cue that I&#39;ve asked an awful lot<br/>
lately.)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, remember that what makes your daughter a wonderful, exciting,<br/>
passionate, caring person are the same things that make her a hostile,<br/>
angry, sarcastic, emotional person.  It&#39;s the same gifts.  They&#39;re not<br/>
always easy to live with, but she&#39;ll not be a dull woman!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
