<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699739352">Hi; I have been reading messages on here for the past 6 months or so, <br/>
and am wondering if there is any sort of support group in the northern <br/>
VA/shenandoah valley area? It is great to read the insights of like <br/>
minded individuals; would be even nicer if my daughter and I could <br/>
actually make a physical connection! Thanks.<br/>
