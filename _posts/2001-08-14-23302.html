<div id="ygrps-yiv-335058327">Elizabeth thanks for telling me about Lego Mindstorm!  Wow!   Looks kind<br/>
of scary to me since I&#39;m a complete klutz when it comes to legos, but I<br/>
think my boys would love it.<br/>
They are wild about legos.  I am just so impressed with their creativity<br/>
with those things...probably because I cant seem to do it.  :)<br/>
The boys even decided to share a room to sleep in so the other room<br/>
could be their lego room.  There are legos everywhere in that room, but<br/>
they don&#39;t have to pick them up.<br/>
I have also been thinking about what kind of careers a person with this<br/>
kind of inventive, creative talent moves towards.   Not that my kids are<br/>
even close to thinking about it, but it is nice to have books and maybe<br/>
meet people with this kind of talent that use it in their work.<br/>
Any ideas on that?<br/>
I&#39;m going to have to go look at the MIT site....  maybe there is<br/>
something interesting there.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Engineering, art, law, mechanics--anything that involves design and patterns <br/>
and procedures.  <br/>
<br/>
Of my adult friends I know played with Lego and still do, there are two <br/>
engineers (working with computers), a systems analyst, a lawyer and a <br/>
graphics designer.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should just let them play with Lego without an uber-structure or <br/>
mom-designed tie-ins to anything or anyone.  &quot;Lessons&quot; for Lego seems to me, <br/>
too, to be a potential damper on their joy.<br/>
