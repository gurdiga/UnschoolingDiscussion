<div id="ygrps-yiv-921882515">&lt;&lt;Also I&#39;m so glad to hear about your daughters reading.  Did you like <br/>
the Harry Potter books ? I wonder if Joey is to young for those (7 <br/>
years) they are pretty big books  !!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome! (for the gamefaqs.com site info)<br/>
<br/>
As for the Harry Potter books, I love them!  And as to whether Joey might like them, try the first book out to see.  The first 3 aren&#39;t very long, and if he likes those, he&#39;ll be very happy the stories get longer!  You may cruise through them at a leisurely pace, power read for hours a day, or stop after the first few chapters.  It all depends on whether he enjoys the story.<br/>
<br/>
I guess Alyssa would have just turned 8 last year when I started reading the series to them.  Joseph was 10 and Michael 5.  One of the great things about the books is that they can each take from the story at their own level.  Michael enjoyed the action in the books, but really loves the movies since the action is right there.  Alyssa and Joseph enjoyed getting into more detail and picking out all the hints, clues and interrelationships scattered throughout the existing books.  And on top of all that, I also enjoy looking for clues about the last 2 books in the series!  <br/>
<br/>
Because JK Rowling developed the general storyline in detail before writing the first book they really lend themselves to being read multiple times.  After reading the 5th book this summer it&#39;s really interesting to go back and read the first four to find all the clues she left, as well as just seeing characters mentioned in passing that end up with more significant roles in later books.  Very wonderful series!  We have lots of great memories around them (and more to come!).<br/>
<br/>
So give it a try, and if he isn&#39;t interested right now, no problem, just find something else that excites him.  We had the first book laying around for at least a year before getting to it.  :-)<br/>
