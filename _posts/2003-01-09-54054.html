&lt;&lt; I guess I&#39;m just spoiled by that silly little <br/>
so-called right called &quot;Freedom of Speech.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too bad you don&#39;t understand it, and I guess you&#39;re not reading my posts <br/>
where I&#39;m calmly and repeatedly saying that your freedom of speech involves <br/>
you in the U.S., not you on other people&#39;s lists, in their newspapers, on <br/>
their TV shows, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I suppose if the site had been <br/>
named something like Helen&#39;s House Party. Com or Sandra and her pals.com or <br/>
OnlyOne Vision of UnSchooling.Com,  I would never have tried.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you have a list, not matter what you call it it will be, in actuality, <br/>
Foxglove&#39;s House Party and  you can throw others out if you want to.  If you <br/>
have described to your pals who join your list what you intend to have the <br/>
list be, you will pretty much have a duty to them to throw people out who are <br/>
going to mess up the vision you have for your list, if they ignore your <br/>
repeated requests to keep to your chosen topic and tone.<br/>
