My 6yo goes to bed no<br/>
earlier than 9:45 most nights. His best and most productive &quot;schoolish&quot;<br/>
hours (reading, talking, puzzle books) are between 8 and 10 P.M.  But at<br/>
least he sleeps past 8 most mornings. He established this pattern early as<br/>
a baby and hasn&#39;t changed. We couldn&#39;t keep up this schedule if we were<br/>
going to public school, and we&#39;d miss so many special talks at night.<br/>
<br/>
Mine 7yo is like that too.  And by then I&#39;m worn out!  I&#39;ve often wondered<br/>
how he would have handled school.  Of course he can get up if he really<br/>
wants to do something, but everyday would have been a real strain.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s why some kids stuggle in school  - just doesn&#39;t fit their<br/>
internal clock - could this be a whole new area of Learning Disability? :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I struggled with the early hours of school until I reached college and<br/>
could pick all afternoon classes.  How much more I enjoyed school once I<br/>
could sleep late! I truly believe we all have different internal clocks and<br/>
to go against them would always be a struggle not worth making. Of course<br/>
my husband would probably agree that we late-night people have a<br/>
&quot;disability&quot; because he jumps out of bed each morning at 6:30 ready for the<br/>
day, and is frustrated that I can&#39;t change my clock to fit the norm imposed<br/>
by society. My father will argue that, without the discipline of getting up<br/>
and going to school, my son will never be able to hold a regular job. I can<br/>
only hope my son will find work he loves that will fit his internal clock,<br/>
rather than find just a &quot;regular job&quot;. <br/>
