<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
Or gives the power to the larger, older child typically. How is that<br/>
balanced?<br/>
I think of children as foreigners to a strange land. Each year, they<br/>
learn more and better skills for navigating life..but until they gain<br/>
those tools, or learn those skills, they need a guide.<br/>
<br/>
Every person in this house deserves peace and safety. If anyone wants<br/>
to take that away, I will stop that person.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve learned through being mindful, is that 90% of problems are<br/>
averted by being present with my children. As they get older, they<br/>
need that presence less, but they also have better skills by then.<br/>
<br/>
The days we have more problems, are the days I&#39;m not being available<br/>
enough.  It&#39;s a good reminder to really BE with them, be part of their<br/>
world and involved in their activities. When that happens, I can use<br/>
the better skills I have in negotiation and relationships, to avert<br/>
potential fights.<br/>
