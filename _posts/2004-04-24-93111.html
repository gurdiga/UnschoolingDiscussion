<br/>
Here&#39;s a question I&#39;ve been mulling over for sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, several times you&#39;ve mentioned avoiding schoolish<br/>
terminology--mostly math examples like multiplication or geometry, but I&#39;m<br/>
guessing this would apply to things like simile, alliteration, etc. I&#39;m<br/>
wondering why you think terminology clutters up the brain. I know the terms<br/>
are made important by schools and that&#39;s problematic, but isn&#39;t there a way<br/>
to take the terms out of the school setting and use them in helpful ways?<br/>
<br/>
See, I&#39;m far more apt to use the term itself as a way of demystifying it and<br/>
integrating it into life instead of avoiding the term. If multiplication or<br/>
geometry are something that happen around the house and not just in a school<br/>
building in 8th grade classrooms, it&#39;s going to be part of living and not<br/>
some mysterious, scary thing that requires experts to provide access to it.<br/>
And if alliteration is something we do when we&#39;re being silly or something<br/>
we find in Scooby-Doo then it, too, will be part of life, part of thinking,<br/>
speaking and playing with language.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m talking about using a term as a means of identifying something that<br/>
comes up in life, *not* as a subject that must be covered, learned and<br/>
prepared for and lectured on--if that distinction makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious and wanted to hear you elaborate a bit.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
wondering why you think terminology clutters up the brain. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Terms before examples are confusing static.<br/>
<br/>
Terms AFTER examples are just more vocabulary, like &quot;clock&quot; or &quot;dog.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No child who has never seen a dog nor a picture of a dog needs to hear the <br/>
word &quot;dog.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I know the terms<br/>
<br/>
are made important by schools and that&#39;s problematic, but isn&#39;t there a way<br/>
<br/>
to take the terms out of the school setting and use them in helpful ways?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  When it comes up in real life and the kids notice the patterns, <br/>
mention the term.  If they forget it, mention it again in six months or three years <br/>
when it comes up again.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t ever mention it, they will find it on their own when reading or <br/>
hearing a comedian speak or something later.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things I know that I didn&#39;t learn from school or from my <br/>
parents.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-See, I&#39;m far more apt to use the term itself as a way of demystifying it <br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
integrating it into life instead of avoiding the term.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Mystification can be good.  If a kid is playing with his own newly-found idea <br/>
that superheroes names tend to have same beginning sounds, like Clark Kent <br/>
and Lois Lane, Peter Parker (what was the guy in Unbreakable?  his name did that <br/>
too), and cartoon characters do too sometimes, like Daffy Duck and Bugs <br/>
Bunny, don&#39;t jump in TOO soon to tell him he&#39;s not the first one to notice that and <br/>
that it has a name.<br/>
<br/>
If he comes and reports his news to you, say &quot;How cool!&quot; and think of some <br/>
more with him.  And then you can say that before rhyming final syllables was the <br/>
cool things to do in English poetry, what they really liked, the Anglo-Saxons <br/>
and the Vikings, was alliteration, which is that beginning sounds match.   <br/>
&quot;Alliteration.&quot;  It&#39;s related to &quot;letter&quot; and &quot;literate&quot; (etymologically <br/>
speaking).<br/>
<br/>
You could say some or all of that, depending on the person&#39;s other interests <br/>
or prior knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
But to bring it up one day cold, and say &quot;Someday you might notice that <br/>
sometimes a write will choose words that match at the beginning, and you should be <br/>
on the lookout for that, because it might be on a standardized test someday, <br/>
or you might want to study literature or the history of English, and the word <br/>
is &#39;alliteration,&#39; so try to remember that,&quot;  you will just be making noise.  <br/>
And really irritating noise.  And if and when the kid WERE to come across that <br/>
and remember what you said, it wouldn&#39;t be a joyous moment.<br/>
<br/>
Too many terms and too little discovery squeezes the joy out of their <br/>
discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
-=So, I&#39;m talking about using a term as a means of identifying something that<br/>
<br/>
comes up in life,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
Like a dog or a clock.<br/>
<br/>
But when it comes to &quot;disciplines&quot; and &quot;subject areas,&quot; I made a conscious <br/>
decision when Kirby was five (and told all my friends who thought I was goofy) <br/>
NOT to categorize things for him as being &quot;science&quot; or &quot;math&quot; or &quot;history.&quot;   I <br/>
chose NOT to tell him that triangles had to do with counting.  Because honest <br/>
to God, they DON&#39;T, outside of school.  I didn&#39;t tell him worms had to do <br/>
with surgery.    I didn&#39;t tell him the moon was related to volacnos.  In the life <br/>
of a five year old child (and anyone else outside of school or a personal <br/>
philosophical internal ramble) they aren&#39;t.   <br/>
<br/>
Ancient Egyptians and 19th century Hawaiians?  Why should they be set <br/>
side-by-side?  Why, if a child is excited about the Great Wall of China, should a <br/>
parent start in on history in general, or geography in general, or the entire <br/>
history of wars or human migration, or anything else except JUST what directly <br/>
has to do with what the child knows or wonders at that moment about that wall?<br/>
<br/>
Answer their questions.  Show them one more cool thing, maybe--a dot to <br/>
connect, that you know they have inside.    But don&#39;t plot the thing on the map of <br/>
your state&#39;s curriculum.  Just let it be what it is.   Let the child have the <br/>
joy of the gradual discovery of what relates to what else in what ways.  He&#39;ll <br/>
probably do it WAY more thoroughly and more in keeping with his personal <br/>
model of the universe than he will do with someone else coaching him about what&#39;s <br/>
important and what parts he should remember or be most proud of having learned.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I come at this from the perspective of never having kids in school. Math is natural and fun around our house and doesn&#39;t need any demystifying. Starting to attach labels would add to the confusion here. It would also start cutting math up, making borders my kids might feel aren&#39;t to be crossed. I want them to feel math is as open to exploration and play as the backyard. How I was taught it (or rather not taught it) in school was that it was done this way, studied under these labels and not open to play at all (I remember getting marked down for getting right answers the wrong way). Maybe it&#39;s a different matter if your kids have already been exposed to the terms but here demystifycation isn&#39;t important because it&#39;s never been mystifyed. The labels they can learn when they need to but they don&#39;t need those labels to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was Sandra maybe, or maybe I read it elsewhere, who brought up a story of a mathmatician who if he had kids (or he had kids but decided that if he could do it again) he would not teach them any math. That&#39;s really stuck with me. At least the point of it...every other detail as you can tell is vague. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699285212">This has been floating about in my head for awhile and i thought <br/>
maybe this thread about &quot;terminology&quot; might be a good place to put it.<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to me that Seamus might never (in his childhood)learn the <br/>
terms &quot;pronoun&quot; &quot;noun&quot; &quot;verb&quot; &quot;adverb&quot; etc. The phrase &quot;a noun is a <br/>
person place or thing&quot; might be completely foreign to him. A huge <br/>
part of my childhood years in school was spent &quot;diagramming&quot; <br/>
sentences and defining these terms. Seamus is surrounded by people <br/>
who basically speak well, use proper sentence structure unless we are <br/>
being sloppy on purpose, etc. He seems to always use the right words <br/>
in the right places. His vocabulary might be somewhat &quot;advanced&quot; for <br/>
his age (he will use some really &quot;hard&quot; words when its least <br/>
expected), although i am not sure exactly how a 7 yo is supposed to <br/>
talk or what &quot;vocabulary&quot; words the typical 7 yo uses. <br/>
<br/>
So i guess my question is, is it important that he know the <br/>
terminology for stuff he does naturally already? I suppose he might <br/>
want to memorize the basics before the SATs, but other than that, is <br/>
there anywhere in real life this stuff comes up? I think i explained <br/>
what a &quot;vowel&quot; was to him the other day because it came up in <br/>
conversation, but usually this kind of stuff doesnt come up. I <br/>
suppose i could strew some SchoolHouse Rock (i *still* dont know what <br/>
a conjuction is, nor what its function is)<br/>
<br/>
We went garage-saling today and came across a ton of &quot;teaching <br/>
materials&quot;, textbooks, teacher manuals etc. My sister said &quot;This <br/>
mustve been a homeschooling family&quot; and kept saying i should buy the <br/>
stuff. Instead i bought a pokemon card tin, some plastic pokemon <br/>
figures, a jenga (wooden puzzle thing)game, an unopened box of 600 <br/>
plastic pieces that you attach pennies to to make structures (can&#39;t <br/>
remember the name, but seamus loves them and they are expensive in <br/>
the store), a bag of glitter, some kids books, some &quot;family fun&quot; <br/>
magazines, and some big wooden storage cubes. Ahhhh i love my <br/>
&quot;unschooling curriculum&quot;.<br/>

Certainly not at seven, and maybe never.<br/>

<br/>
MadLibs!   They&#39;re at bookstores and available online (booklets to buy, and also some online versions).<br/>
<br/>
We have Schoolhouse Rock.  Had it on video, now have it on DVD.  I used to just put it on for background, and the kids would pay attention to the ones that attracted their attention and go about their business otherwise.  That&#39;s how they were intended to be used when they were first created.  I never said &quot;pay attention,&quot; but sometimes now when we&#39;re playing madlibs and one has forgotten, I&#39;ll sing a snippet of a song.<br/>

Marty&#39;s had two sets, one new and one used.  He&#39;s done some cool things with those.<br/>
<br/>

They join things.  Junction=intersection.   <br/>
They work like those connectors between pennies in those kids.  Honest.<br/>
<br/>
This and that and the other thing, or something else.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>

When I want ways to explain things or examples, I go to google now.  I used to go other places, not hardly ever anymore. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Grammar words must come up in crossword puzzles but I can&#39;t recall any<br/>
recently.<br/>
<br/>
They might come up in other verbal puzzles but that&#39;s just a guess since I<br/>
can&#39;t think of any.<br/>
<br/>
Jeopardy?<br/>
<br/>
Except for immersion programs, most foreign language programs - even the<br/>
ones intended for use when someone isn&#39;t in school -- use grammar words. I<br/>
found the hardest part of trying to learn German was the esoteric verb<br/>
tenses that I was supposed to have grasped in English grammar, but still<br/>
couldn&#39;t even after looking them up for the class.<br/>
<br/>
If schools didn&#39;t teach grammar, would there be grammar questions on the<br/>
SATs?<br/>
<br/>
Grammar words come up in discussions of the development of langauge and<br/>
writing and the structure of languages.<br/>
<br/>
If you type in &quot;noun&quot; into Google and start eliminating grammar words (like<br/>
&quot;singular&quot; and &quot;proper noun&quot;) the pages are still pages about grammar with a<br/>
few pages about the structure of other languages.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some that came up with verb that aren&#39;t about learning grammar:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;God Is a Verb [title of a book] promises to do for Judaism what The Tibetan<br/>
Book of Living and Dying did for Buddhism&quot;<br/>
<br/>
VERB public service advertising campaign about exercise.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s Dan &quot;Phrasal Verb page&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eslcafe.com/pv/)">http://www.eslcafe.com/pv/)</a> that seems to<br/>
be a collection just for the fun of it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a BBC radio program called The Verb: A cabaret of words<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/speech/theverb/competition1.shtml)">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/speech/theverb/competition1.shtml)</a>.<br/>
<br/>
(There was a competition to come up with new words:<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to everyone who entered our invented words competition.<br/>
<br/>
The winner, chosen by Ellie Levenson, was Ginspiration¹, submitted by Geoff<br/>
Lowe Definition: brain waves after the third or fourth drink.<br/>
<br/>
Geoff also came up with Testoblerone<br/>

<br/>
Third placed was, Canguage¹ submitted by Darrell Lloyd, which means &#39;words<br/>

verb, pronoun, etc came up when we were doing madlibs.<br/>
They were words, and types of words, that he already<br/>

<br/>
 What I like about unschooling is that the label can<br/>
come after the thing has been learned, it&#39;s like it<br/>
finds its place in his terminology way after he&#39;s<br/>
comfortable with it.  it&#39;s often a lightbulb type<br/>

<br/>
Well, since you asked, my theory is that grammar questions on SATs and <br/>
other academic forms of tests are an attempt to give advantage to native <br/>
speakers.  Because I think some of the questions hinge on grammar <br/>
subtleties and vocabulary shades of meaning that really can&#39;t be <br/>
memorized or learned by &quot;rules&quot; in our crazy language.  It seems to me <br/>
that being raised in a home where people correctly speak English with a <br/>
sophisticated vocabulary is a big advantage in passing these tests that <br/>
claim to measure academic potential or academic achievement.<br/>

of school.  LOTS of people think word histories are really interesting.  I <br/>
don&#39;t blame those 85 percent who think it&#39;s not one bit interesting.  <br/>
Pronunciations and the way they change is interesting to me.  Most people don&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
Schoolhouse rock existed to combat (verb, not noun, so it&#39;s pronounced <br/>
comBAT) the anti-television prejudice.  Educators were cranky that kids could <br/>
memorize commercials but couldn&#39;t learn &quot;facts&quot; at school, so TV folks came up with <br/>
commercials for parts of speech and the times tables.   Those were shown along <br/>
with commercials, one or two an hour, on Saturday mornings in the early <br/>
1970&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who invented mad libs or why (A quick google search <br/>
<br/>
for &quot;who invented mad libs&quot; didn&#39;t come up with anything), -=-<br/>
<br/>
Before the days of e-mail humor, there was office humor.<br/>
Before that, there were things that kids (and women in offices, pre-copy <br/>
machines) would write up and pass on to other people because they were funny.  <br/>
Jokes, lists, stories.   They go by e-mail now, but I used to collect hand-done <br/>
copies.  I wish I&#39;d saved them all.<br/>
<br/>
Some of those were mad-libs-style things, so the form of humor, of asking for <br/>
names and actions and descriptions in advance and then plugging them into a <br/>
story, predates anyone publishing them.<br/>
<br/>
Scholastic books, which specialized in cheap newsprint-paper paperbacks for <br/>
the school market in the 1960s, came up with MadLibs, because kids would buy <br/>
them.  They used to be 50 cents a pad, and they were like little pads of paper.  <br/>
They&#39;re still in that format, more or less.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe people who don&#39;t enjoy math would say that booklets of logic puzzles <br/>
exist because school wants kids to like math, but I disagree.   Puzzles and <br/>
analysis are fun, for those who are analytical.  And I bet lots more people would <br/>

This suggests that grammar is only a school-thing, and that&#39;s not true.  The <br/>
way schools teach it makes it seem boring and repetitive, but they seem to <br/>
manage to do that with anything they turn into assembly line batch-delivery <br/>
&quot;information.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Discovery is always more fun that delivery, and with schoolhouse rock a kid <br/>
can learn the song without even thinking about the words or understanding what <br/>
it&#39;s about, and later on spill it and examine it, on some long road trip or <br/>
off riding his bike.<br/>

&lt;&lt; ** If schools didn&#39;t teach grammar, would there be grammar questions on the<br/>

SATs?**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, since you asked, my theory is that grammar questions on SATs and <br/>
<br/>
other academic forms of tests are an attempt to give advantage to native <br/>
<br/>
speakers.  Because I think some of the questions hinge on grammar <br/>
<br/>
subtleties and vocabulary shades of meaning that really can&#39;t be <br/>
<br/>
memorized or learned by &quot;rules&quot; in our crazy language.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Vocabulary isn&#39;t grammar.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember grammar questions on the SAT.  I remember word analogies.  I <br/>
remember them asking which word best would go in a spot in a paragraph, and <br/>
sometimes the choices were different forms of the same word (if I&#39;m recalling <br/>
correctly, which I might not be) so that technically you might be choosing <br/>
between an adjective form or an adverb or a noun, but they didn&#39;t SAY so.  It was <br/>
just knowing what sounded right and flowed, without any analysis of why.<br/>
<br/>
And I remember there being choices between similar words--similar sounding or <br/>
looking words.  <br/>
<br/>
I just think grammar problems (when there are any) can be figured out the <br/>
same way math question can be, by finding a similar known situation and <br/>
extrapolating from one what the unknown is going to be.   One of the most common errors <br/>
people make is to say &quot;I&quot; when they should say &quot;me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Godzilla attacked my son and I.<br/>
No, Godzille didn&#39;t attack I.<br/>
<br/>
Try them separately and then you know what to use in combo.<br/>
Godzill attacked my son and me.<br/>
. . . him and me.<br/>
. . .  us.<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t need the terminology for that type of pronoun (nor even to know <br/>
it&#39;s a pronoun) to figure out what the word should be (I don&#39;t think).<br/>

Grammar vocabulary seems most prevelent purely for the teaching of <br/>
grammar.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say it&#39;s for the study and enjoyment of language! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But then, I LIKE it!<br/>
<br/>
You mathies might enjoy knowing the &quot;math vocabulary&quot; for addition and <br/>
logarithms and square roots. But they really only exist so that it has a <br/>
name----right? I mean---the ideas and rules EXIST, but we need words to discuss them. <br/>
Grammar is similar; we need the words, the terminology, in order to discuss them. <br/>
<br/>
It can be hard to explain how to use the nominative/subjective case vs. the <br/>
accusative/objective case in Sandra&#39;s example in another post for the  (sorry, <br/>
I forget the example!) &quot;my son and I&quot;  vs. &quot;my son and me&quot; withOUT the <br/>
terminology we&#39;ve given them. Sandra just said to say it without the &quot;and&quot;---- and <br/>
that way it can make more sense to people. Without the &quot;and&quot; it&#39;s easy----you <br/>
need to use the accusative case to make sense of it.  If you know the reason and <br/>
the terminology, though, it&#39;s major easy to understand.<br/>
<br/>
Someone a few weeks ago said that she didn&#39;t even know what an indirect o<br/>
bject was. Then two or three others chimed in that they didn&#39;t either. Yes, you <br/>
do. You ALL do. You use it every day. You just can&#39;t give a definition for the <br/>
grammatical terminology. In Latin and German, we have a whole separate case <br/>
(dative) for the indirect object (makes it VERY easy!). <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Give ME the book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ME is the indirect object. &quot;Book&quot; is the direct object.<br/>
<br/>
Grammar and syntax exist because that&#39;s how language exists. Without some <br/>
kinds of rules for grammar, we just have a jumble of words. Sometimes, that&#39;s all <br/>
we have ANYway! &lt;BWG&gt; We learn the rules from others in a holistic <br/>
manner----by using them correctly, we can ensure our children use them correctly. Or not!<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of people use it in strange ways. We can still understand them----most <br/>
of the time (to me, it&#39;s kind of like nails on a chalkboard though!). <br/>
Children acquire language incrementally, adding structure as they go. We can <br/>
understand them too. But sometimes a person will do something so funky, it makes no <br/>
sense. The rules were bent/broken TOO much.<br/>
<br/>
Grammar is a necessary component of all languages. It must exist to make <br/>
sense out of language. But everybody doesn&#39;t need to &quot;study&quot; and enjoy it. Just a <br/>
few (only 15%, Sandra?) of us. Words and how they fit together to make <br/>
language is as fascinating to some of us as all that math stuff is for some of you! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need to know Fibonacci&#39;s number (is that it?) in order to notice how <br/>
petals fit on a flower----but it makes more sense (and is cooler) when I know <br/>
it. I don&#39;t need to know what an adverb is in order to use it correctly, but <br/>
it makes more sense when I do.<br/>
<br/>
To me, grammar just makes sense. It&#39;s logical.<br/>

We can address the lingo when we&#39;re interested or when we need it.<br/>

Latin. German. English, too----as far as I know. I&#39;ve heard the term <br/>
&quot;nominative accusative&quot; when using the verb &quot;to be&quot; in English.  Nominative is a fancy <br/>
name for subject. Accusative for object. Maybe I&#39;m mixing up <br/>
languages----it&#39;s happened before. But maybe it&#39;s just clearer to me in Latin and German. <br/>
Having a Dative case made the indirect object SOOOO much clearer!<br/>

Asking someone else to define something is rarely more than entrapment, <br/>
though.  If a kid asks me to define something, I might be able to do it off the top <br/>
of my head, but I usually double check anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Define X is a school thing, not such a life thing.  Real life is an open-book <br/>
situation.  A spell-check situation.  <br/>
<br/>
If you remind him what a pronoun is at the beginning of a Madlibs game, can <br/>
he come up with some?  If so, he understands what a pronoun is.<br/>

Most adults (BIG most) don&#39;t need to know the difference between an adverb <br/>
and an adjective.  Those who find they suddenly need to know can look it up in a <br/>
dictionary in minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about terminology.   I memorized math terms and got A&#39;s in <br/>
math, and found they never, ever EVER came up in the real world.  Addends.  <br/>
Divisors.   Common denominators comes up because it&#39;s used in situations which <br/>
don&#39;t really involve math. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The real English words are used.  Numerals, sum, product (used in many and <br/>
broader senses).   The made-up-for-math-books words are used in math books.<br/>
<br/>
Same with grammar.  Some words are common, real words.  Word, syllable, <br/>

each other like trick ponies and playing entrapment games or springing schoolish <br/>
performance demands on kids (defining words or writing book reviews or <br/>
ANYTHING)  And I agree that when answers are in books, we should of course open <br/>
them!<br/>
<br/>
      I guess defining the parts of speech makes a good example of <br/>
irrelevance for most folks, but I think the above goes beyond that, to say defining <br/>
terms and building bicycles aren&#39;t part of real life. <br/>
<br/>
       Carefully, formally defining and delimiting terms in clear language is <br/>
not merely some torment conceived by &quot;school.&quot; It&#39;s part of daily real-life <br/>
endeavors such as legal and legislative work, scientific and research work,  <br/>
academic work, computer programming, and probably lots of things I know less <br/>
about, cartography and medical diagnostic work perhaps? I&#39;m guessing mathematics <br/>
is fairly reliant on clear definitions too? <br/>
<br/>
       I know clearly expressed definitions are important to me when I hear a <br/>
sales pitch, sign a contract, invest my money, explain what I need someone to <br/>
do, or explain what I am willing (and not willing) to do.<br/>
<br/>
       Imo the &quot;quest&quot; for a unique definition involves several cognitive <br/>
abilities that we do use in real life, and defining something is a real part of <br/>
thinking about it. Definition answers to your own questions often aren&#39;t in the <br/>
books, and if they are, some other humans had to work long and hard to get <br/>
them there. The most interesting concepts to me are the ones we assume can be <br/>
easily defined until we try, and then we find it&#39;s like a snowflake -- we&#39;re <br/>
looking for that one unique identifier but it&#39;s not visible to the casual glance <br/>
in a snowstorm. You have to look really closely at a LOT of snowflakes and <br/>
concentrate hard to see, and accurately describe, the difference. And if what you <br/>
learn is that you can&#39;t, that is valuable information too. Maybe you will <br/>
publish your findings and let others build on them as *they* see fit! <br/>
<br/>
       The whole process of thinking this way is intellectual work. School <br/>
does a poor job of it, trivializes it, makes kids loathe and avoid it even, but <br/>
for that we should blame school, not the intellectual task itself. Imo anyway, <br/>

<br/>
In discussions like these we&#39;re asked to define our terms all the time.  But <br/>
people are not required to be in discussions like these.<br/>
<br/>
Bicycles are built daily, but it is possible, and even moral, to ride a <br/>
bicycle one was incapable of building, and people can use language and use it as <br/>
well as a trick cyclist without being able to define the parts of speech without <br/>
review.<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to know the definitions of the terms to be mathematically <br/>
minded, intelligent or talented.  You need the definitions of the terms to discuss <br/>
mathematics in an analytical way.   That&#39;s a separate endeavor from just <br/>
using math.   Discussing grammar is not necessary for someone to be a good writer <br/>
or speaker.  It&#39;s only necessary if one is interested in anayzing grammar.<br/>

Yeah, definitions have utility.  We shouldn&#39;t throw the baby out with <br/>
the bath water.<br/>
<br/>
However, I would generalize that definitions are most useful &quot;in <br/>
context&quot; of real work or real interest.  School tends to take <br/>
definitions *out of context* and make a fetish about memorizing terms <br/>
and brief (rather shallow) definitions of those terms.   How much good <br/>
are abstract definitions learned without context?  Will students really <br/>
be able to retain and apply them meaningfully in the future?<br/>
<br/>
Also, having a *verbal* definition of a term is more important when the <br/>
topic must be discussed in text, rather than conveyed by pictures, <br/>
objects or demonstrations.  School tends to accidentally elevate words <br/>
over pictures, objects and demonstrations because a low-cost education <br/>
can mostly supply words and a few pictures.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS   Kind of a tangent...<br/>
<br/>
I find it odd that classical educations books, e.g. The Well Trained <br/>
Mind, think that words about squid on a page are *better* than a Jacques <br/>
Cousteau video of a squid.  I think the moving pictures convey more than <br/>
words.<br/>

have! JJ &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even if we have the same definition, maybe we have different ideas of how and <br/>
whether it should apply to homeschooling discussions.<br/>
<br/>
There are fun, non-commital ways for people (regardless of age or education) <br/>
to analyze topics, ideas and meanings.  There are constant opportunities for <br/>
discussions of philosophical concepts outside the formal study of philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example from myt house, last night.  I posted it at <br/>
unschooling.com, but I&#39;ll put it here too:<br/>
<br/>
By Sandra Dodd (Sandradodd) on Thursday, April 29, 2004 - 06:49 pm:<br/>
this is hard to convey, because it was quick and sometimes two or three <br/>
people were talking at once. Sometimes I couldn&#39;t quote, and there was laughing and <br/>
gesturing, but here it is for the sake of its punchline: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband brought papers for me to sign. He&#39;s moving my IRA to the Navy <br/>
credit union (his dad was a WWII pilot, and his brother was on a submarine years <br/>
later) <br/>
<br/>
We were talking about insurance policies his dad has for the kids, which are <br/>
paid for by interest from an IRA that&#39;s in Holly&#39;s name, bought by her <br/>
grandparents. Holly wanted us to tell her what we were talking about. I said it would <br/>
be enough money if she died that we could bury her and have a party. She <br/>
acted like that sounded good. I said maybe we could put her out between Purple and <br/>
Luna (a cat and rat of hers, bothin the flowerbed out back). I said maybe we <br/>
could pay the house off with the insurance money so we wouldn&#39;t ever have to <br/>
sell it and lose Holly&#39;s grave. <br/>
<br/>
Illegal to bury her in the yard? Maybe. <br/>
<br/>
I suggested that we could get a stone that says &quot;Luna, beloved rat of Holly,&quot; <br/>
and underline Holly, so God would know it was actually her. <br/>
<br/>
Holly said God is a genius and would know anyway. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why&#39;s God a genius?&quot; Keith asked. He just is. I suggested &quot;butterflies.&quot; <br/>
Holly concurred. <br/>
<br/>
Keith said God&#39;s omnipotent, so he knows everything. <br/>
<br/>
Will he turn us in to the city? <br/>
Probably. <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;That&#39;s omnicient. Omnipotent means he can do anything, all-powerful. <br/>
And (to Holly I said) the question that goes with that is whether God can <br/>
make a rock so big that he himself can&#39;t pick it up. If not, he&#39;s not omnipotent. <br/>
<br/>
Holly, without missing a beat: &quot;I thought the question was whether Jesus <br/>
could microwave a burrito so hot that he himself couldn&#39;t eat it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I HOOTED! <br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Well yes, that&#39;s the same question, updated. Where did it come from?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Simpsons.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Who asked it?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Homer.&quot; <br/>
<br/>

brain, I keep letting go of things like &quot;I&#39;ll teach my kids to <br/>
memorize the state capitals because it&#39;s always bothered me that I <br/>
don&#39;t know them.&quot; My son knows the names of many states and cities <br/>
because we go there or know people. I know the capitals of the states <br/>
I&#39;ve lived in because the laws made there mattered to me and I <br/>
listened to news about what happened there. <br/>
<br/>
I remember learning the names, in order from the sun, of the planets <br/>
because I felt like it. Still know those. Chick-fil-A is giving away <br/>
planets in the kids meals. I love that place. My son was blowing <br/>
bubbles yesterday saying they were &quot;planet bubbles&quot;. &quot;Look, there <br/>
goes Pluto.&quot; I like having planets strewn about the living room...<br/>
