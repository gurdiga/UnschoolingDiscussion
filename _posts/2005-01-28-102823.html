Horses get more respect than kids, with some people.  If they&#39;re harsh with <br/>
kids, it doesn&#39;t mean they would be harsh with a horse, or a dog, or a stranger.<br/>
<br/>
The culture of the SE U.S. has a medieval history.  Where feudalism died out <br/>
in other parts of the world, it was thriving there, in a new and kinda weird <br/>
way.  A lower class is necessary to the psyche, and when slavery was gone and <br/>
women were no longer good legal victims, children were next.  The first part <br/>
isn&#39;t my speculation.  The second part is my observation of the Big differences <br/>
in the way some of the people I&#39;ve met from there treat their kids (and get <br/>
irritated with the way I treat mine), and from working for several years with a <br/>
board of directors of a group trying to decide how much to include minors in <br/>
various positions and what rights to give them within the group, and it being <br/>
the representatives from Georgia and Florida who said &quot;No Way&quot; to treating <br/>
older teens as adults in ANY way.  And they had dug up medical research and legal <br/>
precedent (all from where they lived, which I guess had been used locally to <br/>
keep kids down) to defend their positions, so there was the pretence that it <br/>
was for the only for the kids&#39; own good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard similar defenses about keeping women out of certain jobs, out of <br/>
the military, and in the house, for their own good.   They lost those fights.   <br/>
<br/>
Yes, things are changing (always, everywhere) and there are families who are <br/>
wonderful with their children and other people&#39;s children, but if that area <br/>
never got outvoted by other parts of the country, I think they would still have <br/>
segregation of race and gender.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I brought this up I got jumped on by people saying &quot;Prejudice!&quot; but <br/>
pointing at prejudice against minors and saying &quot;Look&quot; isn&#39;t me being <br/>
prejudiced against the people  was pointing at.  It&#39;s me seeing a pattern and saying, <br/>
&quot;Look, a pattern.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m wrongs, and YES I know it&#39;s changing.  But it&#39;s already <br/>
changed other places.   And YES there are kid-resenting people all over the place <br/>
and it&#39;s not exclusively one region.  But if it is apparent in one region to <br/>
the extent of children having to use different forms of address, that&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510094224">Hi, I am new to the list but I had to respond to this. First let me give <br/>
a introduction. I am Johanna, wife to Raymond and we have 6 children,the <br/>
oldest is Cindy who is 20 and has our first grandson Caesar Ramon. They <br/>
live in Massachusetts. Raymond is our 18 yo  and a talented guitarist, <br/>
singer and songwriter. Michael is 14 and loves old cars and drumming. <br/>
Julian is 12, skateboarding and LOTR are his current passions. Gabriel <br/>
is 7 and fascinated with anything to do with science or government. Tory <br/>
is the youngest at 5, very much the little girl, she loves Barbies, tea <br/>
parties and dressing up.(her choice, not mine) While I have loved the <br/>
unschooling philosophy for many years, my husband is reluctant to <br/>
believe in it and this does cause tension on occasion. We lived in <br/>
Massachusetts until 5 years ago. Tennessee is now our home. When we <br/>
moved here our whole family went through quite a cultural adjustment. <br/>
While we have always expected common courtesy and respect out of each <br/>
other as fellow human beings I was surprised how many people here feel <br/>
like it is their right to be respected just because of their position. <br/>
some have been downright rude but it is executed subtly. The first 6 <br/>
months we were here Cindy and Raymond were in public school by their own <br/>
choice and Michael and Julian were also because my husband felt that was <br/>
best while we were in the middle of moving to a rental property and <br/>
buying our own home. The principal of the middle school gave me many <br/>
&quot;lessons&quot; in southern authority. I will share one example. Ray came home <br/>
from school one Wednesday afternoon with a note saying he had to write <br/>
100 times &quot; I will not have a rubber band in the NCE gym.&quot; He was a bus <br/>
student and after class ended the bus students wait in the gym until <br/>
their bus arrives. They are allowed to talk, but have to stay in <br/>
assigned areas. Ray had a rubber band on his wrist and was snapping it <br/>
when a teacher walked up to him and took it off his wrist. He asked her <br/>
why she took it away. She ignored him so he asked again. She asked him <br/>
if he would like to discuss it with the principal and he said sure. He <br/>
gets in trouble for questioning authority. He didn&#39;t do it that night <br/>
because of schedule conflicts and the next day is sent home with a note <br/>
stating if it is not returned finished the following day he has <br/>
detention. We pulled out the student handbook and in it it states if a <br/>
student disputes a disciplinary action, he must state his dispute in <br/>
writing, so Ray writes an excellent 2 page letter stating any object <br/>
could be construed as a potential weapon and unless there was some <br/>
intention or attempt to use it as such, he is innocent. The principal <br/>
did not like this challenge to authority and I am now called into a <br/>
parent conference with the principal. after 45 minutes in his office in <br/>
conference with the teacher I am told I am as rebellious as my son and <br/>
he has to do the sentences or he will be suspended from school. He <br/>
didn&#39;t do the sentences and was suspended from school, all over <br/>
possession of a rubber band. My son came out with a stronger sense of <br/>
how ridiculous some adults can be. Many people here have been wonderful <br/>
and good friends but there is and underlying attitude of superiority in <br/>
southern culture.<br/>

are expected to show respect in a way that adults are not. Children are <br/>

The arguments for keeping women home in this culture were couched in terms of <br/>
respect and courtesy too.  And in cultures where now women are not allowed <br/>
out, not allowed to drive or go to college, that&#39;s described in terms of respect <br/>
for women, and protecting them.<br/>
<br/>

They&#39;re playing, and they&#39;re playing at the Middle Ages.<br/>

Just using the term for any generic reason, especially to agree with  <br/>

mostly used.<br/>

We certainly can look at it, but to me it looks like rude disrespectful  <br/>
people, who feel entitled to somehow treat children badly or minimally without  <br/>
respect, while demanding it from the child.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, whether that happens in Savannah GA or in Detroit MI, it&#39;s still  <br/>
disrespect of our children and worthy of conversation about how to best equip  our <br/>
children to handle these situations if they might occur.<br/>
 <br/>
Whether it occurs mostly in the south, one can speculate or tell of  <br/>
observations, but my observations are that rude insensitive nasty people are a  part <br/>
of life.  They can be found anywhere and sometimes where you least  expect it.<br/>
 <br/>
Personally I can&#39;t attribute this more so to any one region or locality but  <br/>
they do tend to crop up in instances where one of the aforementioned rude <br/>
people  seems to feel some &quot;power&quot; has been given to them.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s never acceptable and I&#39;m sorry that children are exposed to people  like <br/>
this in life.<br/>

Please don&#39;t think it&#39;s accepted &quot;down here&quot; as a general rule.  I am  <br/>
acquainted with many true southerners and they would not think of speaking to a  <br/>
child in such a manner, much less someone else&#39;s child!<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s wrong no matter where one might be  living. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584370828">Decades ago, I was removed down to Georgia from the way far North and at <br/>
the age of ten confronted, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My school experience went like this:<br/>
<br/>
Teacher asks me a question.<br/>
Me:  Yes.<br/>
Teacher:  Yes, what?<br/>
Me:  Uhhh....yes?<br/>
Teacher:  Yes, what?<br/>
Me:  Uhhh...maybe?<br/>
Teacher:  Maybe, what?<br/>
Me:  No???<br/>
Teacher:  No, what?!!!<br/>
<br/>
And off I went to the principal&#39;s office.  I had never heard of yes ma&#39;am <br/>
in my life and it was all very confusing to me, but I was more confused by <br/>
the passion concerning yes ma&#39;am and no ma&#39;am, yes sir and no sir.  And I <br/>
was even more confused by people expecting a child who was known to be from <br/>
the North to be versed in Southern etiquette.<br/>
<br/>
I never did get used to Yes ma&#39;am/no ma&#39;am and somehow managed to slip <br/>
through childhood not using it, finding it repugnant (I think only because <br/>
of the attitude accompanying).  So it never entered my lexicon.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was raised entirely southern, his family never having ventured <br/>
above the Mason-Dixon line, from backwoods LA and the Gulf.  He said yes <br/>
ma&#39;am and no ma&#39;am.  His father said yes ma&#39;am and no ma&#39;am.  His mother <br/>
said yes ma&#39;am and no ma&#39;am.  It was an address of respect and was used <br/>
with everyone regardless of income level or race or age.  Even children <br/>
were addressed by ma&#39;am or sir, if &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; was not followed by an <br/>
affectionate identifier such as &quot;honey&quot;.  I have never heard his family <br/>
instruct anyone not in their family to use ma&#39;am or sir, and they have <br/>
never instructed our son to use it.  My husband says he has never heard his <br/>
parents say to anyone, &quot;Yes, what?&quot;  If you weren&#39;t raised to use it as a <br/>
customary address it wasn&#39;t expected.  I don&#39;t know if this is peculiar to <br/>
the areas from which my husband&#39;s family came.<br/>
<br/>
I still didn&#39;t like it.  It felt fake to my ear.  But many Southern <br/>
conventions that were supposed to be a matter of respect and neighborliness <br/>
felt fake to me, probably because I was thoroughly abused as a child from <br/>
the North, and also because I had moved down here pre-integration, to a <br/>
land of black maids daily bussed in from their poor segregated neighborhood <br/>
to serve white families, where white swam in their own pools and drank from <br/>
their own water fountains.  So I certainly connected yes ma&#39;am with <br/>
authoritarianism and repressiveness.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years after we were married my husband and I moved to Atlanta <br/>
and the Atlanta we moved to and move about in is populated by <br/>
non-southerners and people from more southern areas who &quot;escaped&quot; to <br/>
Atlanta.  For a couple of decades I have very rarely heard yes ma&#39;am or no <br/>
ma&#39;am.  My family didn&#39;t adopt it.  My son doesn&#39;t say it nor has anyone <br/>
ever requested he do so and his father&#39;s parents have not instructed him to <br/>
do so or expected him to do so.  I have only been addressed &quot;Ma&#39;am&quot; once in <br/>
a number of years (on a personal level where I wasn&#39;t a customer) and it <br/>
was recently by a friend of a niece, the individual being Vietnamese, his <br/>
family being refugees who moved here in the 70s, and I imagine they took <br/>
significant pains to adopt what they saw as customary and insisted their <br/>
children do so.  I know my Midwest grandmother had told me, &quot;When in Rome, <br/>
do as the Romans do&quot;, when I was being moved down South, but I decided not <br/>
to do so, nor did my family encourage me to do so.  But a Vietnamese <br/>
family--I don&#39;t know but in Vietnam they may have their own system of <br/>
respectful address and so were comfortable with it, or felt it especially <br/>
important to adopt the convention as they were refugees.<br/>
<br/>
Down here, Ma&#39;am and Sir are part and parcel of systems of address by <br/>
service industry workers and that is a matter of  authoritarianism.  Still, <br/>
I&#39;m infrequently addressed as ma&#39;am and it could be because I never did <br/>
pick up much of a Southern accent and that lack of an accent may signal me <br/>
as an individual with which that formal address doesn&#39;t need to be used as <br/>
it&#39;s not expected.  My husband doesn&#39;t get it much either however.  There <br/>
are certain cues as to use that even my husband goes by as sometimes I will <br/>
hear him with strangers using yes ma&#39;am, no ma&#39;am, yes sir, no sir.  Or <br/>
with certain friends but with those friends it&#39;s a matter of affection.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890493719">When I was a space camp couselor, I completely enjoyed my team of <br/>
kids from southern Louisiana. I had to get used to the yes ma&#39;am <br/>
thing really fast. They were a good bunch.<br/>
 THe one bunch that was really a trip for me, was the blind/visually <br/>
impaired group. They started listening as soon as you started <br/>
talking. They all got quiet just immediately. I never really thought <br/>
about how important listening is to someone who can&#39;t see before <br/>
that week.<br/>
Being blindfolded and led around was an interesting experience too. <br/>
I really had to focus on using sight related words when talking <br/>
about the stuff we were going over too. <br/>

many positive and wonderful interactions we&#39;ve had in <br/>
our explorations of our new home :)  The ladies at the <br/>

There have been other complimentary situations as well.  <br/>

This thread does have me wondering if some of the people<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-108435314">Yes I was. The Aviation challenge was only a couple of years old <br/>

Thanks!  We have a zip line in our back yard, but no pool to drop  into.  I&#39;m <br/>
sure Will would enjoy that.<br/>
 <br/>
Is there anything academic about the camps?  No writing or math or  anything <br/>
like that?  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t want Will to feel uncomfortable about not knowing how to fill in  <br/>
worksheets or whatever.  I doubt they&#39;d get too many school kids to go if  it <br/>
were too academic, and his session is in April, so I&#39;m hoping there are lots  of <br/>
homeschooled kids there (unschooled kids are too much to hope for).  <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s really excited.  Took his chicken pox shot like a man.   :)<br/>
