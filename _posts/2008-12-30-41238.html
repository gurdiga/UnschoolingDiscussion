<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674354878">I&#39;m really sorry to hear about your son&#39;s tumor and the effects of  <br/>
the treatment, but he&#39;s alive!  That&#39;s good.<br/>

<br/>
I think by windows of opportunity you meant windows that open and  <br/>
then close again.   Unschooling is all about opportunities to learn  <br/>
from real-world experiences and people and whatever music, movies,  <br/>
plays, puzzles and games come into range.  This list is probably better:<br/>

<br/>
-=-So if their children doen&#39;t read or learn whatever at the age  <br/>
usually expected by national curriculums, is not an issue.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Most of the kids in school don&#39;t read or learn whatever at the age  <br/>
usually expected by national curriculums.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were ahead in some things and &quot;behind&quot; in others (just as  <br/>
kids at school are, only without any of the homework, grades, shame  <br/>
and pressure).  Now that they&#39;re 17, 19 and 22, they&#39;re each doing  <br/>
well socially and financially.  If you were in a socially- <br/>
representative group of people their age and you didn&#39;t know which  <br/>
ones were my kids, I bet you&#39;d figure it out before long.  They&#39;re  <br/>
interesting and interested.  They  make eye contact with people.   <br/>
They speak clearly and with a sparkle in the voice.  If you tried to  <br/>
sort the group out by those you think might have learned to read at  <br/>
advanced ages (9, 11) you wouldn&#39;t be able to spot my kids by that.   <br/>
They read as well as others their ages, and way more willingly than  <br/>
many who learned to hate reading and to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But what if, due to brain irradiation, a child looses learning  <br/>
ability each year? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Is this true?  Is it expected to continue for many years?  For life?<br/>
<br/>
-=-What if the damage makes learning so dificult, tiring and  <br/>
unplesant, that children start losing their curiosity and interest,  <br/>
preferring to do what is already comfortable for them? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;learning&quot; in the sentence above you mean school lessons, then  <br/>
this list can&#39;t be much help to you.  If you want us to say &quot;OH YES,  <br/>
hurry and teach him things before he loses his curiosity and  <br/>
interest,&quot; that&#39;s not going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Look at this:<br/>
<br/>
What if school makes learning so dificult, tiring and unplesant, that  <br/>
children start losing their curiosity and interest, preferring to do  <br/>
what is already comfortable for them?<br/>
<br/>
That happens to EVERY child in school.  Some never recover.  Some  <br/>
find ways to continue to learn the things they like despite the  <br/>
drudgery and time-suck of school hours, days, weeks, months and  <br/>
years.  The answer to the &quot;what if&quot; for most on this list has been  <br/>
&quot;Take them home and find ways for them to live fulltime in a life of  <br/>
curiosity and interest, without making anything difficult, tiring or  <br/>
unpleasant!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-What if not learning something this year might mean it will be  <br/>
even harder next year and less likely that it is learned?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If this is true, if there is honestly an ability loss each year, then  <br/>
what good will learning do?  Won&#39;t memory be going away too?<br/>
<br/>
If I had a child who was losing function steadily, or who had nearly  <br/>
died and might yet die unnaturally soon, I would take him to  <br/>
Disneyland.  I would take him to lunch in interesting places.  I  <br/>
would do all these things:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I see there being lots of windows of opportunities.  In fact<br/>
that is largely how I view unschooling, many series of windows of<br/>
opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Learning how to read at a certain age because of an arbitrary school<br/>
curriculum benchmark has little to do with windows of opportunity for<br/>
learning how to read.  There are many times that there are cool<br/>
opportunities to learn things and expand on things, not to be confused<br/>
with teachable moments.  Sometimes my kids are more open and recpetive<br/>
to new and intersting things than other times, those are the windows, as<br/>
I see them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But what if, due to brain irradiation, a child looses learning ability<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Each year?  What do you mean by this?  Does the passing of time and the<br/>
loss of ability always coincide with each birthday or other yearly<br/>
benchmark?<br/>
<br/>
What if the damage makes learning so dificult, tiring and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unplesant, that children start losing their curiosity and interest,<br/>
&gt; preferring to do what is already comfortable for them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose it depends on how you view learning and how you value what is<br/>
being learned.  The only time I learn new things in art is when I get<br/>
bored of what I&#39;m comfortable with.  Comfort is a good thing, comfort<br/>
allows for an open mind.  What kind of things are you talking about in<br/>
regards to learning that is difficult, tiring, and unpleasant?<br/>
<br/>
What if not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; learning something this year might mean it will be even harder next<br/>
&gt; year and less likely that it is learned?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I have no experience with brain damage, but I would imagine that a<br/>
child that is living comfortably and happily being himself, brain damage<br/>
or not, will do to the best of their ability to do what they need to do<br/>
to get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
If the brain damage is so enormous that the person can never read or<br/>
write, how would their life be different if they were in some special ed<br/>
class in school where they still try to focus on it?  How would<br/>
something like that ever really help a person that really couldn&#39;t read<br/>
or write?  Wouldn&#39;t it be better to help your child in the abilities<br/>
that they DO have and drop the ones they don&#39;t?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802602971">I have some experience with a right temporal lobectomy, in my then-32 year<br/>
old husband.<br/>
The absence of short-term memory was a bumpy adjustment, to be sure. Then<br/>
again, there was incredible comfort in the repetition. It was a boon that it<br/>
was also the very thing that brought great joy to my toddlers :D<br/>
It&#39;s a challenge, a tough one. I&#39;d tell you, over tea and cookies, that<br/>
unconventional is what you got and unconventional is what you&#39;re gonna have<br/>
to seek to live there comfortably and joyfully.  It&#39;s like that poem, you<br/>
got Holland instead of Italy. Me too. And I love my life.<br/>
It is possible & it&#39;s not at all gonna look like what you thought it would.<br/>
The secret is in keeping your focus on what&#39;s here and now. Embracing this<br/>
uncharted territory.<br/>
<br/>
Be in relationship, find what works for who your son IS right now, what<br/>
engages him and brings him joy. Provide lots of that. Over and over. To his<br/>
heart&#39;s content. When the heart is content the mind is open. He&#39;ll learn in<br/>
his very own way exactly what he needs to know. Trust is *so* important.<br/>
What you do matters. How you feel about what you do matters. Even, perhaps<br/>
especially, if you&#39;re the only one who will remember.<br/>
