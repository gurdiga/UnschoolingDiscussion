Seems it has to do with angels (down near the end) and afterimages and <br/>
reincarnation and the change of teeth (? baby teeth coming out?) and that some <br/>
colors develop your soul and some destroy it, or something.   Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people should do this even at home.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some pro-literature, for balance (or at least a summary of it without <br/>
details):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Art<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The class teacher gives regular instruction in drawing and water color <br/>
painting through the grades. In the early grades painting is non-representative; <br/>
children are immersed in the experience of the different colors and learn the <br/>
quality of each. Beginning in fourth grade, painting lessons are often related <br/>
to the subject being taught in the main lesson. Clay modelling, veil painting, <br/>
drawing with charcoal and pastels and other art forms are also a part of art <br/>
lessons through the middle grades. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Form Drawing<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Form drawing is taught in grades one through five as part of the main lesson <br/>
or in a period of its own. Forms of various kinds are drawn, beginning with <br/>
straight and curved lines in first grade. This is the foundation for the child <br/>
learning to print and write. By third grade the forms become quite complicated <br/>
and help to develop the child&#39;s spatial orientation and sense of balance and <br/>
proportion. In fifth grade, with this experience behind them, the children <br/>
practice free hand geometry. &quot;<br/>

 <br/>
With all due respect, Sandra, some people just do believe in this philosophy. I don&#39;t understand why we feel the need to judge other people&#39;s beliefs and practices just because we don&#39;t agree with them? <br/>
 <br/>
I believe in reincarnation and much of Steiner&#39;s writing on the spiritual realm. I don&#39;t pretend to understand or know the majority of his philosophy, but what I&#39;ve read on this particular subject (reincarnation, Atlantis, ancient Lemuria, the way the spiritual realm works with us, angels, children choosing their parents before coming into this life) corresponds to my personal beliefs in this area anyway. Much of his writings in this area, though, are similar to the growing Metaphysical movement now, which is more what I identify myself with, not Steiner or Anthroposophy.<br/>
 <br/>
So, just wanted to point out, though I don&#39;t agree with much of Waldorf either, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily productive to bash it. Just my opinion....<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s fine, but it won&#39;t get them closer to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind belief in ideas, but if the belief is that using the wrong color <br/>
too early ruins development or the incoming soul or conjures evil or whatever <br/>
all it might be, that&#39;s not good for the child&#39;s potential to make some <br/>
decisions on his own.<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;some people just do believe in this philosophy&quot; you mean some people <br/>
just don&#39;t think it&#39;s important for children to make decisions on their own, <br/>
you are absolutely and profoundly right.   In the cul de sac in which I live the <br/>
families other than ours who believe in letting children have some freedom <br/>
are Zero.  Controlled, controlled, shaming.<br/>
<br/>

and practices just because we don&#39;t agree with them? -=-<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;we&quot; do you mean me?<br/>
Seems so.<br/>
<br/>
The way a person decides what she believes is to look at everything that <br/>
comes along and see whether it helps, hurts, reinforces, detracts, supports...  <br/>
and just as Steiner kept changing his mind and affiliations through his lifetime <br/>
(so a speech given one year might contradict what he said or wrote another <br/>
year), probably just about ever unschooler started off believing something else, <br/>
invested in something else, proud or ashamed of things that unschooled <br/>
children might never have to contend with (grades, reading group, attendance record, <br/>
honor society, whatever).<br/>
<br/>
Helping kids learn how to research a question, to examine what they find open <br/>
mindedly, compare it against what they already know, and how to find more <br/>
information when they need more is all part of helping them learn to live in the <br/>
world.   There are adults who can&#39;t do that very well, but it&#39;s easy to do <br/>
with google.com and a group of hundreds of interested, curious unschooling <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I believe in reincarnation and much of Steiner&#39;s writing on the spiritual <br/>
realm.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of evidence for reincarnation.  I&#39;d be happy if it turns out <br/>
to be true.  I used to believe and now I just don&#39;t care.   My life isn&#39;t lived <br/>
out of fear of the outcome one way or another.  I&#39;m helpful because helpful <br/>
is good.  I&#39;m honest because honesty is good.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-So, just wanted to point out, though I don&#39;t agree with much of Waldorf <br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t name any posts &quot;bashing&quot; and I don&#39;t consider quotes and evidence to <br/>
be &quot;bashing.&quot;  Someone asked and several people shared information.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of sharing information about Waldorf or Steiner, you chose to defend <br/>
your personal self and criticize (me? the list?).   <br/>
<br/>
Ideas, please.  Let&#39;s talk about the ideas.<br/>
And talk about the ideas in the light of unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, yes, this is basically what I&#39;m saying. And, people not only just &quot;believe in it&quot;...but are adamant about the *correctness* of what they&#39;re doing. Equally as much as you are sure of the truth of what you are doing. There are so many people in our society believing so very many different things, I just don&#39;t see choices and beliefs as &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;. Just right for me (or my family). <br/>
 <br/>
But, it&#39;s not always easy, obviously. When I see a mom screaming at her 2 yo in the mall, and then hitting him repeatedly on the bottom for not staying right with her and remaining silent so she can chat with her friend, it&#39;s very hard not to be judgmental. But, in my heart I know that for whatever reason, that mom is where she is for a purpose. People can change, and I believe that people create their own reality and lives around them by the thoughts and beliefs that they choose. She just hasn&#39;t realized her own power to choose yet, so has no idea how to let go so that her child can be empowered too.<br/>

 <br/>
Remaining objective and neutral about other people&#39;s decisions, beliefs and actions seems crucial to unschooling. After re-reading my post here, I see that I need work harder and take my desire to be truly non-judgmental to include my children! Duh! Seems obvious, but I guess for me it&#39;s easier to refrain from judging outsiders, whose decisions don&#39;t really affect you in any way, than making judgments on my own kid&#39;s choices. <br/>
 <br/>
I realize now that it&#39;s letting go of that old belief (of mine) that our children and their behaviors are a reflection of our parenting, and therefore my worth and self esteem come into question...&quot;am I a *good* mom if my kid wears no shoes to the store?&quot; &quot;am I a *good* mom if.....(fill in the blank). This is a belief that I learned growing up, and it no longer serves me or my current goals. Therefore, I am in the process of writing out new affirmations/beliefs that will support my current vision of how I choose to be with my children. This process I know will help. Thanks to you all, greatly, for allowing me to process through all of this here. Writing things out, and being pushed with tough questions is so very valuable for me. I&#39;ll get there ;)<br/>

more sense?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Nope. Not really.<br/>
 <br/>
Waldorf (from an unschooling point of view----which IS why we&#39;re here) IS  <br/>
weird. And wrong. Steiner surely looks racists to ME! As for &quot;pulling it out of  <br/>
his ass&quot;----well, it doesn&#39;t look as if he used any FACTS! He just made it  <br/>
up!<br/>
 <br/>
As an unschooler, it&#39;s really important to judge things as right or wrong,  <br/>
better or worse, and good or bad. If you don&#39;t, then how will you know? Not <br/>
only  that----but how will you make sound decisions?<br/>
 <br/>
Judging has taken on a bad connotation in this country&#39;s culture. It&#39;s  <br/>
become politically incorrect to judge. But using your intellect to decide what&#39;s  <br/>
right and wrong is practically a life survival skill! &lt;g&gt; Using  objectivity to <br/>
weigh the pros and cons is a very important ability. <br/>
 <br/>
I wonder about those folks that can&#39;t or won&#39;t do it. Either it&#39;s been  <br/>
beaten/sucked out of them (through school and others telling then NOT  to---to <br/>
believe what they are told), or it&#39;s been shamed out of  them with &quot;it&#39;s not <br/>
&quot;right&quot; to judge others (political correctness at it&#39;s  worst), or they&#39;re just <br/>
stupid.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve come to unschooling by examining other educational  <br/>
options. Weeded through them, looked at the pros and cons, objectively made some  <br/>
JUDGMENT on what the best way to learn is. <br/>
 <br/>
What the world needs is MORE judgment, not less.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t see choices and beliefs as &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;. Just right for me (or my family). <br/>
<br/>
--Kristina, I admire the desire not to judge, but I disagree that choices and beliefs aren&#39;t <br/>
&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong.&quot; There are lots of choices I believe are wrong by themselves, for <br/>
everyone. There are also lots of choices that can be right and not all of them match up <br/>
with each other.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that there are lots gradients and where one person draws the line, another <br/>
is erasing it.<br/>
<br/>
What I try to do more and more is to really listen/hear the perspective of the &quot;other&quot; from <br/>
his or her point of view first (For instance, read Steiner in his own words, if you want to <br/>
know what he believes/advocates. Read his context. Read his enthusiastic followers.) <br/>
before reading the detractors.<br/>
<br/>
Try to put whatever belief you are testing on trial by allowing the fans to speak first.<br/>
<br/>
Then I like to hear what went wrong and why for those who aren&#39;t fans, for those who felt <br/>
betrayed, who discarded the position.<br/>
<br/>
After that, I can make my decision for myself and I can also make a sound judgment about <br/>
the practice, even for others. <br/>
<br/>
I will openly disagree with a belief or practice when I feel informed enough to make that <br/>
judgment. And I will  acknowledge that my beliefs are subject to change over time if I gain <br/>
new information or find myself just flat out wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I empathize completely with passionate beliefs. I don&#39;t feel the need to judge the passion, <br/>
commitment or sincerity of those who disagree with me. But I don&#39;t have any problem <br/>
disagreeing, and strenuously, as long as I do it graciously.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, it&#39;s not always easy, obviously. When I see a mom screaming at her 2 yo in the mall, <br/>

in my heart I know that for whatever reason, that mom is where she is for a purpose. <br/>
<br/>
There may be no purpose at all.<br/>
<br/>
She may be in pain, may not know better or she might just be a selfish person. We don&#39;t <br/>
know. I don&#39;t like to assume that bad things serve a purpose. Too much crap that happens <br/>
serves no purpose except to damage victims.<br/>
<br/>
If we would wake up, we might be of help. <br/>
<br/>
We need courage and compassion, not just compassion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;People can change, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They only change when they are:<br/>
<br/>
a) challenged to see differently<br/>
b) are shown that what they are doing is mistaken at best, wrong and damaging at worst<br/>
c) find that the results they&#39;re getting don&#39;t work<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;. I try very hard in my life to not judge things as better or worse, good or bad. Only good <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for me, better *for me* in this moment. Does this make more sense?<br/>
<br/>
Is beating a child not good or bad? What about molesting a child? Is there ever a time <br/>
where those aren&#39;t bad?<br/>
<br/>
Less extreme examples:<br/>
<br/>
Leaving a baby crying in a crib for over an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Feeding a child dinner and whatever goes uneaten is left for breakfast and then for lunch <br/>
until every last item is eaten off the plate.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping a child in all summer to do the school work he didn&#39;t complete during the school <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
These are all real examples from people in my life. And while there are gradients of <br/>
practice and belief that probably are debatable about the amount of negative or positive <br/>
impact, I don&#39;t think it helps me formulate my own viewpoint if I have to constantly qualify <br/>
other people&#39;s practice as neutral.<br/>
<br/>
I strenuously disagree with the examples above and don&#39;t see that they serve any purpose <br/>
that brings health to families.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; Remaining objective and neutral about other people&#39;s decisions, beliefs and actions <br/>
 </span></blockquote>seems crucial to unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I completely disagree. *Owning* my viewpoint and acknowledging the differences between <br/>
mine and other people&#39;s is crucial to unschooling. Forming informed opinions is crucial to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If I have friends whose kids are suffering at the hands of authoritarianism, I will not simply <br/>
say, &quot;This is the right method for you. It will serve a purpose in your family.&quot; I will offer <br/>
another view, I will give advice or help or suggestions for what I think will make family life <br/>
better. I don&#39;t give unwanted/unsolicited advice, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t stay neutral.<br/>
<br/>
And if I see what looks like abuse, I have to report it, as I have done.<br/>

<br/>
No.  I don&#39;t see it that way.  If my child said things that were racist, <br/>
or hit two-year olds at the mall (like the chatting mom in your example) <br/>
I would not remain neutral.  If I posted about either of these problems <br/>
on this list, I don&#39;t expect that people here would advise me to be <br/>
neutral about these behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
I would try to remain calm.  I would try to be understanding.  I would <br/>
probably even try not to be rigid and doctrinaire.  I would even try to <br/>
look at the circumstances of the situation and see if that helped me <br/>
understand the behavior any better.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;d like to give a more illustrative example, but it&#39;s hard because I <br/>
started out with a hypothetical.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not even neutral on the issue of organic food.  I know that it is <br/>
probably better for my health and for the health of ecosystems to have <br/>
less pesticide used.  I&#39;m not enthusiastic about &quot;roundup ready&quot; plants <br/>
that are bred to thrive with higher doses of pesticides.  However, often <br/>
organic food is more expensive and difficult for me to fit into my <br/>
budget.  It&#39;s also less widely available.  The fact that I see pluses <br/>
and minuses within the issue, (even only having looked at it <br/>
superficially) doesn&#39;t make my opinion neutral, however.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if what you are advocating is like a zen detatchment from <br/>
worldly events and their outcomes?<br/>
<br/>
**&quot;am I a *good* mom if my kid wears no shoes to the store?&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
I think I understand what you mean with this part of your post.  There <br/>
have been ages when I sometimes found my kid&#39;s behavior while shopping <br/>
embarrassing  (e.g. runnning).  But mostly I tried to keep him from <br/>
having a screaming fit at the store out of sympathy for HIS distress, <br/>
not to prevent other people from judging him and me.  However, I have <br/>
sometimes said, please comb your hair before we go to your cousins or <br/>
Aunt C---- might think I&#39;m a bad mom. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I suppose where I do try to be neutral (as an unschooler) is about <br/>
what my child likes to do and learn, IF it is not harmful to others or <br/>
to himself.</div>

When I told my kids about Adam and Eve, I said lots of people believe this <br/>

When I told them about evolution, I mentioned archeology and geology and <br/>
Darwin, that fiding bones of extinct species that are a little different makes <br/>
people think that over many years animals change.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; What the world needs is MORE judgment, not less.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could say that the world needs more &quot;discernment,&quot; not less so that <br/>
we stay <br/>
<br/>
away from the &quot;judgment&quot; word which oiften translates to &quot;judgmental.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Should we abandon every word that some people have forgotten how to use?<br/>
<br/>
The official policy at corporate level of the Society for Creative <br/>
Anachronism is to say &quot;Middle Ages&quot; instead of &quot;medieval,&quot; because too many people think <br/>
&quot;medieval&quot; is a form of &quot;evil.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh.  <br/>
<br/>
Should paleontologists change &quot;primieval&quot; so fundamentalists aren&#39;t confused?<br/>
<br/>
But wait.  Fundamentalists DO think it&#39;s evil.<br/>
<br/>
And the areas of the U.S. (because it was only U.S., not any other country) <br/>
where &quot;medieval&quot; was raising questions and losing them sites and the positive <br/>
regard of the community were the south and southeast.  <br/>
<br/>
If a person is ignorant of the word &quot;medieval,&quot; the majority who do know what <br/>
it means and how to use it should educate them, not roll over and let <br/>
ignorance take a word out of their vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Judgmental&quot; has a bad connotation.  It has a bad DEnotation (meaning), I <br/>
suppose, as it&#39;s the too-harsh judgment.<br/>
<br/>
But do we throw the &quot;good judgment,&quot; &quot;best judgment&quot; and &quot;sober judgment&quot; <br/>
babies out with the bathwater?<br/>
<br/>
No.  Remind people they are SUPPOSED to use their own judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Kids all over the country are told they can use the car or stay home alone <br/>
when the parents have seen they can use good judgment, but it too often turns <br/>
out what the parents mean is &quot;when you can do exactly what we say for long <br/>
periods of time without trying to use your own judgment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No wonder too many people haven&#39;t thought about what it means.<br/>

7718769-6998305<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fiction book, similar to Ishmael in that there&#39;s a main <br/>
character who teaches his philosophy during the fictional story. He <br/>
talks about people choosing their own lives, and when asked about <br/>
people who have horrifying lives, his response is (paraphrasing)that <br/>
souls might pick a horrifying human life for much the same reason a <br/>
person might choose to go see a horror movie.  The movie&#39;s not really <br/>
real, and it&#39;s kind of an enjoyable experience to be scared when it&#39;s <br/>
not really real.  So, according to his theory, a soul might choose to <br/>
live through a horrifying life just for the experience, to learn <br/>
something new, and then when he dies and goes back to spirit form, he <br/>
will choose a different life where he can learn and experience yet <br/>
another new thing.  The soul knows the horrifying human life is not <br/>
real, even though during the &quot;movie&quot; of life it might be so caught up <br/>
in the &quot;story&quot; that it forgets that it&#39;s not real.  When the soul <br/>
dies, he can look back on his &quot;life-movie&quot; and say, &quot; Wow, that was <br/>
an interesting horror movie, not let&#39;s pick a different kind of life <br/>
to experience.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Wild book.  I&#39;m not sure I even recommend the book unless you enjoy <br/>
something that&#39;s WAY out there. lol  <br/>
<br/>
I guess people who believe that would say that there are lots of <br/>
different theories about our existence, all equally valid, and that <br/>
people just have to choose which one seems the best to them.  They <br/>
might also say that just because a theory was so popular that it <br/>
became written down in a holy book like a Bible would simply mean it <br/>
was a more popular theory, not necessarily a more valid theory.  <br/>

I do not think this concept would make sense to a young child. I will certainly share my beliefs with them as they get older and we begin discussing more issues as this one. We do go to a spiritual center where they are surrounded by metaphysical beliefs, too, so I suspect that at a point they will begin asking questions themselves.<br/>

I made choices in the past that are very different from choices I would make today.

This is simply a disagreement of spiritual beliefs. I happen to believe that all situations, whether they are perceived as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, serve a purpose. You don&#39;t agree with this, that&#39;s okay, but I just believe in a different philophy here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75115954">** Remaining objective and neutral about other people&#39;s decisions, beliefs<br/>
and actions seems crucial to unschooling.**<br/>
<br/>
I actually think it&#39;s the reverse. I see people out in the street with their<br/>
kids and it&#39;s a reminder to me of how I don&#39;t want to be with mine. I have<br/>
people in my life who I think are messing up badly with their kids. If I<br/>
remained neutral in my feelings how could I feel so passionately about what<br/>
I am doing and how we are choosing to live?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t go out and try to convert everyone I meet to unschool and to parent<br/>
differently, handing out antispanking tracts &lt;g&gt; but if put in a situation<br/>
where I could share things that have helped me to have a better relationship<br/>
with my kids then I would. I would be understanding and compassionate but<br/>
truthful. I think it&#39;s possible to be both most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I think on an unschooling list full of people who are passionate about<br/>
unschooling, ideas and beliefs will be pulled apart (mental picture of<br/>
lionesses ripping apart an antelope spring to mind &lt;bg&gt;) with enthusiasm and<br/>
vigour. To me, that&#39;s the way to unschooling, passion and critical thinking.<br/>

 <br/>
I also hear what many of you are saying about life, this list, etc. being no fun if nobody challenged anyone else&#39;s opinions. I agree, and think that people can discuss, debate and share very passionately why they choose the things they do without saying others are *wrong* for choosing differently. And, this is pretty much what I see/feel on this list- people passionately sharing about their own choices but not condemning those who choose differently. <br/>
 <br/>
It seems to me that it comes down to respect, for others and their choices. It just seems to me that as unschooling parents strive to let their children live in true freedom (without placing judgments on their choices), this would also carry over to respecting those other adults around you and giving them the same respect, even when their choices aren&#39;t the ones that you yourself would make. Is this not accurate?<br/>

Act from your own convictions, and then keep the &quot;take what you need and <br/>
leave the rest&quot; slogan running in the background.  We don&#39;t need to agree on much <br/>
at all for this list to work.   It was hard enough for three listowners to <br/>
agree.   Some measure of confusion is fine.<br/>
<br/>
But two things I can offer my personal opinion on:<br/>
<br/>
-=-as unschooling parents strive to let their children live in true freedom <br/>
(without placing judgments on their choices). . . -=-<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;place judgments&quot; on my kids&#39; choices.  I don&#39;t always express them.  If <br/>
all choices were equally valid and good, there would be nothing EVER for <br/>
unschooling parents to get excited and happy about.  So of course, people get excited <br/>
when a little kid makes a cool decision (&quot;cool&quot; meaning something other <br/>
adults and our relatives would value highly or be impressed by).  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
we punish or shame for a bad decision.  But there is such a thing as a bad <br/>
decision, or a decision a child regrets, analyzes, and learns from.<br/>
<br/>
-=-this would also carry over to respecting those other adults around you and <br/>
giving them the same respect, even when their choices aren&#39;t the ones that <br/>
you yourself would make.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well &quot;the same&quot; as the false premise?<br/>
<br/>
I respect what I respect.  I don&#39;t respect an adult just for being an adult, <br/>
nor a choice just for being a choice.   Respect means zilch if it is <br/>
universal.   It only has value if some things are respected and other things are not.   <br/>
Gold would be worth no more than sand if we respected all elements equally.<br/>
<br/>
So I have no interest and there in no benefit in agreeing with a proposal <br/>
that we respect all things equally.   It&#39;s not only impossible, it&#39;s not <br/>
desireable.<br/>
<br/>
But in the context of unschooling discussions, I have more respect for <br/>
children than for adults.  And I have more respect for unschooling itself than for <br/>
people&#39;s excuses for not unschooling.   <br/>

&gt; purpose of their own soul&#39;s evolution. -=-<br/>

<br/>
In the same frame of this belief .... if the child chose that spanking <br/>
parent, and you believe that this parent is &quot;where she is for a <br/>
reason&quot;, if you go one step further... wouldn&#39;t YOU then also be where <br/>
you were for a reason?  Meaning, if YOU were at that mall at the same <br/>
time as that child was being spanked, might your purpose have been to <br/>
offer some guidance or step in and tell the woman to stop?  I&#39;m trying <br/>
to follow this and it seems to me that if *everyone* is where they&#39;re <br/>
supposed to be then why were YOU there at that exact moment to witness <br/>
it?  Were you supposed to do or say something to help guide that woman <br/>
on her path?  Or was it simply coincidental and you take in that scene <br/>
like data to be filed without judging her behavior &quot;tra-la-la&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.<br/>

I am so needing something like that, though, with regard to my son going to  <br/>

war in Iraq is bad and my son is not at fault and that it&#39;s okay if I honor his <br/>
 service even though I don&#39;t in any way whatsoever honor war.  It would have  <br/>
to be people who don&#39;t mind my irrational state of mind about it all.  <br/>

I&#39;m not good at cooing and stroking from hundreds of miles away, but I can<br/>
definitely support you in this, and I don&#39;t think you have an irrational<br/>
state of mind at all!!!!  War is bad.  I can&#39;t even imagine anyone wanting<br/>
to argue that point.  But your son is not at fault for it.  I assume he&#39;s<br/>
there doing the best job he can.   I think it&#39;s great that you support his<br/>
choices even if you may or may not agree with them.<br/>
