&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uh---that would be ME! &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m not into thick double coat, so---for me---the <br/>
Aussies & collies are O-U-T (Although I find them incrediblty beautiful!). <br/>
I&#39;ve had Weimaners for 15 years, and a viszla for two, so I&#39;m cormfortable with <br/>
that personality type---and it would be my first choice. But Kristi said that <br/>
first time puppy raisers generally get a lab, a golden, or a lab/golden mix. <br/>
So I&#39;m preparing myself for a retriever! &lt;G&gt; (Long-time readers know I&#39;m not a <br/>
retreiver fan! &lt;G&gt;) But it&#39;s a relatively short commitment---and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll <br/>
be head over heels in love within 24 hours! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the second day, the pup (5 mo-old black lab) got excited and playfully <br/>
mouthed her arm, resulting in Lisa getting 3 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stitches.  Today is his third day with us, and I&#39;ve been doing most of the <br/>
&gt; handling since yesterday.  Lisa has done some handling since the incident <br/>
&gt; though.  She does not want to be afraid of him.  She was so worried that he <br/>
&gt; would be dropped from the program for biting.  (I don&#39;t like to call it biting, <br/>
&gt; it really was a playful accident, not an attack - what would be a better <br/>
&gt; word?)  We have been told that he will be evaluated, but not necessarily dropped.  <br/>
&gt; It had already been noted that he does excessive mouthing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YIKES! He doesn&#39;t inhibit bite? That would have me worried! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m glad that my daughter had the opportunity to try this for a weekend <br/>
&gt; before having to commit to a year or more with a pup.  She may wish to look into <br/>
&gt; it again when she is older, or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I wish more people would do just that before making such HUGE commitment. <br/>
Not just for guide dogs puppies---which is intensive---but for a regular old <br/>
dog. SO many people don&#39;t relaize that it&#39;s a *lifelong* commitment. I figure <br/>
*I&#39;m* coming out EASY with only a year! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your take! I&#39;m glad she&#39;s thinking a little harder about it! It&#39;s <br/>
a lot of work!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; What does &quot;inhibit bite&quot; mean?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It means that most dogs have an inborn &quot;inhibition&quot; to intentionally biting<br/>
people and will pull their punches even if they feel pushed into doing so.<br/>
<br/>
A good solid stitches-making bite of a human being is something that has to<br/>
be actually encouraged and trained for, even in most enthusiastic<br/>
guard-candidate dogs of guard breeds. &quot;Bite down hard on this person&quot; is<br/>
against the Covenant for most sane dogs.<br/>
<br/>
A five month old Lab puppy who knowingly bites down hard enough to rip skin,<br/>
including in &quot;play mouthing&quot;, is not one that I personally would consider<br/>
for a guide dog. Depending on the dog, perhaps an experienced pet home<br/>
without young children, perhaps not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I train dogs and I would definately withdraw this pup from the guide dog <br/>
program due to excessive aggression on this incident alone.  No 5 month old pup <br/>
should do that much damage even with a play bite.  I&#39;m wondering if this dog <br/>
went through puppy assessment testing to determine how well it might work in the <br/>
program?  An aggressive pup is going to show aggression at some point enough <br/>
to get your attention no matter what precautions you take - granted it might <br/>
take it longer to have an incident that grabs your attention but it&#39;s going to <br/>
occur.  It definitely needs to be evaluated to figure out if it needs to go <br/>
into a home that works with aggressive dogs or whatever.<br/>

If so, the &quot;fault&quot; is either in the dog&#39;s own temperament or in its earlier<br/>

&gt; learned about the guide dog puppy program when she was 8 and thought she would <br/>
&gt; like to raise a pup.  We have a guide-dog puppy with us this weekend while <br/>
&gt; his &quot;family&quot; is on a short vacation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is much more time consuming than even I thought it would be.  By the end <br/>
&gt; of the first day, Lisa said she doesn&#39;t feel ready to have a pup of her own.  <br/>
&gt; It takes a fair amount of strength to give proper corrections.  Plus, <br/>
&gt; someone needs to be paying attention to the dog nearly all of the time.  This is <br/>
&gt; definitely a family project!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the second day, the pup (5 mo-old black lab) got excited and playfully <br/>

friends. They are/were the gd&#39;s of our friend Sarah, and during church, Julian would <br/>
take her dogs, first Perry, then Farley, and now Gerrin, out to walk, play, <br/>
and pee while Sarah chatted.<br/>
<br/>
Perry was Julian&#39;s very close friend, and Julian was very sad when it was <br/>
time for Perry to retire to &quot;just being a dog.&quot; He went to live with good friends <br/>
of Sarah&#39;s, and died a couple years after that. He was a VERY nice dog.<br/>
<br/>
Farley was also a very nice dog, but not a very good guide dog. He was so <br/>
sweet, but Sarah went through hell with him, he was so distractable. They finally <br/>
went back to the school together, where the instructor took him out. She said <br/>
she was amazed Sarah lasted so long with him, because he was terrible!  <br/>
Farley&#39;s childhood family were happy to welcome him back so he could just be a dog.<br/>
<br/>
Gerrin is Sarah&#39;s current dog, and is working very well.<br/>

between 6-8 weeks old---taught to him by his siblings: if you bite too hard, we&#39;re <br/>
going to NAIL you BACK! So puppies learn to bite *gently*. Keep in mind that <br/>
this is a creature that technically could rip your flesh off your face! Plus <br/>

bitten, but that they found out). As a service dog, this is serious, and <br/>
learning about it earlier saved the program big bucks and time. Oust him now, rather <br/>
than later. And the puppy&#39;s only getting bigger & stonger: the next time <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527345097">Here is an update on the puppy whose teeth made unfortunate contact with my<br/>
dd&#39;s arm.  Guide dogs decided to take the puppy away from the family that<br/>
was raising him.  He is at the kennels in California, being evaluated.  The<br/>
family was very angry about the way that GD handled the situation and has<br/>
stated that they will never have anything to do with GD again.  This leaves<br/>
the local puppy raising club with only 1 pup, being raised by the leader of<br/>
the club.  She has been told she will have to disband the club and transfer<br/>
her pup, because there can&#39;t be a club with fewer than 3 pups.  The nearest<br/>
club is an hour away, on a route that is often icy and hazardous in the<br/>
winter.  The leader said that if my daughter were to get a pup, they might<br/>
allow the club to continue.  However, we are not ready to get a pup yet.  I<br/>
feel we have a lot to learn before we commit to that and Lisa has also said<br/>
that she isn&#39;t ready.  But if there is no local club, we won&#39;t have the<br/>
opportunity to attend regular meetings and learn enough to become ready.<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that there is more information that isn&#39;t being shared with<br/>
me.  It is clear to me that when you are raising a GD pup, it is not your<br/>
pup and the organization can decide to move the pup to another home.  I<br/>
*think* that if raising a pup were something I really wanted to do, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t give up because the first pup was taken from me.  The leader says<br/>
that the family feels they were lied to - that at first they were told the<br/>
pup could stay with them, then they were called and told that the pup would<br/>
be taken immediately.  This couldn&#39;t possibly be the first time that a GD<br/>
pup has broken someone&#39;s skin.  Wouldn&#39;t you think that the organization<br/>
would have a policy of how to handle such situations?  If so, wouldn&#39;t our<br/>
local leader be aware of this policy?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m totally in the dark about the GD&#39;s guidelines and rules, BUT---<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t the puppy already bite before? Weren&#39;t the family and GD aware that <br/>
there was a problem? Maybe the family is only taking the FIRST thing they were <br/>
told by GD (about the first bite) to heart---that they could keep the pup, but <br/>
that they would keep an eye on him. <br/>
<br/>
A bite severe enough to stitch is serious---for ANY dog, but MUCH more so for <br/>
a service dog.<br/>
<br/>
The first call may have been from someone that was immediately available, and <br/>
the second call AFTER a discussion of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
My questions: *WHY* would they want a biter in their family? And why would GD <br/>
even consider a biter for the program? GD&#39;s interest is in a *service dog*, <br/>
NOT a bad pet. What caused this? Bad genes? Bad puppy raisers? Bad situation? <br/>
The pup MUST be evaluated---as well as the family. <br/>
<br/>
It *could* be the first time a pup has bitten. These dogs are bred to have a <br/>
certain personality---biting is NOT an option. A biter could mean another <br/>
CLOSE look at their breeding program (especially THIS pup&#39;s sire & dam and <br/>
aunt/uncles/half-siblings/grands that might be bred), puppy-raiser &quot;interviews&quot;, <br/>
training techniques, and/or policies.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very serious for them---GD. It&#39;s not worth the many hours and $$ that go <br/>
into each guide dog to risk problems like this.<br/>
<br/>
And keep in mind that the leader is feeling the pinch too---she WANTS her <br/>
program to stay together. She may be feeling personally attacked and unable to <br/>
see clearly.<br/>
<br/>
I would have no reason to believe there are biting problems with GD puppies <br/>
(more so with the families and how they were raising the pup). If there were no <br/>
policy before, there will be one now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that if the PUPPY is found to be genetically &quot;defective&quot;, the <br/>
family will be allowed to get another pup, if they are interested. If THEY are <br/>
found to be undesirable puppy raisers, it will be mutual and the program will <br/>
have nothing to do with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can support Kelly on this.  I&#39;ve never dealt with guide dog puppies (only<br/>
seen them fully trained!), but I spent several years living with a woman who<br/>
bred and showed springers.  One of her dogs bit someone quite lightly and<br/>
&quot;by accident&quot; as a puppy.  She kept a record of the situation and was more<br/>
attentive to her training.  It wasn&#39;t a big deal, first time.<br/>
<br/>
Later, as an adult, she bit another dog, quite seriously, in a nasty fight.<br/>
She (the dog) had already been bred, and my friend spent a HUGE amount of<br/>
time contacting every owner of one of her pups, talking about any possible<br/>
problems they may have had, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, both the bitch (in every sense of the word) and several of her<br/>
pups who had shown inapporpriate aggressive behavior were put down.  Rage in<br/>
springers has been a genetic problem before, in several of the well-known<br/>
bloodlines, and she wanted to make sure it was being bred out, not in.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By the way, my blind friend who has had three dogs over the course of her<br/>
life has many times told me how fabulous the folks at GD, California are,<br/>
and how people come from all over the US to get their dogs because of their<br/>
terrific reputation.  GD may have that reputation in mind at the moment,<br/>
too.  One gets that sort of reputation by being ultra careful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that your family has had to be a part of this, because it sounds<br/>
like some of the other people in the program are directing their<br/>
frustrations, inappropriately, towards you.  But from the GD folks&#39; point of<br/>
view, a dog that bites is a serious liability, and they have to consider<br/>
everything.  <br/>
