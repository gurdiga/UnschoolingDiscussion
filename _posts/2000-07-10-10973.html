<div id="ygrps-yiv-191137022">Hi Corallyn;<br/>
<br/>
My heart goes out to you and your darling, sensitive son.  What a<br/>
difficult situation!  <br/>
<br/>
The world can be a very scary place and children need constant<br/>
reassurance that their parents will do their utmost to protect them. <br/>
Obviously your son is aware of the reality of Daddy&#39;s job and is<br/>
fearful.  I&#39;m thinking your 5 year old is a bit young though to deal<br/>
with such a big burden on his own.  If you can lighten his load he could<br/>
have some peace of mind.  It would probably be helpful and help ease<br/>
some of his anxiety if he can talk this issue out with you on an<br/>
on-going basis.  For the time being, while he is immature and needing<br/>
security, you might encourage him that Daddy is safe and your son&#39;s<br/>
prayers can help.  Even if the unthinkable ever happened he could<br/>
eventually understand your wish to protect him and give him the sense of<br/>
security he so badly needs right now.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was a child I was tormented with images of war I saw on the<br/>
nightly news.  I was desperate for my Mom to tell me I was safe and<br/>
needn&#39;t worry about such a reality...instead, she often took the<br/>
&quot;intellectual&quot; approach of not shielding children from the real world. <br/>
As a result, I endured many nightmares!  I think the nurturing,<br/>
protective approach is what Mothering is.  Children need to feel safe,<br/>
loved, protected and never abandoned.  That&#39;s what your son is looking<br/>
for now...when he&#39;s older, (maybe at 10 years of age???) you can provide<br/>
him with more information if it seems appropriate.<br/>

&gt; thinks that DH sits and shoots bad people all night<br/>
&gt; long. We have tried to explain to him that this is not<br/>

&gt;  daddy gettin shot at work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, I think it is very sweet that DS is praying for his Daddy&#39;s <br/>
safety.  I think it shows compassion for others as well as a developing <br/>
understanding of how the world works.  Also, death and the possibility that <br/>
parents will die is a very typical topic of concern for a 5 yr old (at least <br/>
in my experience with children...my own and lots of other people&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
I would emphasize the service that daddy is giving to the community.  That <br/>
daddy feels strongly enough about protecting other people that he is willing <br/>
to take the risks that go with the job.  Even go so far, if you can, to <br/>
express your personal appreciation that DH is willing to put his life on the <br/>
line.  (in gentle terms, perhaps...?).  Encourage the idea that HIS daddy <br/>
is/may be a hero every day he goes to work, by saving someone else&#39;s life or <br/>
making the community safer for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe have Daddy show DS some of the protective equipment he wears.  Or tell <br/>
about he training he gets to keep him safe and help him make good decisions <br/>
on the job.  This could be as simple as stating that the police department <br/>
has a training program for Daddy to help him know how to stay safe.  Share <br/>
appropriate stories of people he has helped.  If there have times of <br/>
miraculous events where daddy has been protected, maybe share those.  (I know <br/>
that idea could get touchy...but, as always, it&#39;s your call)<br/>
<br/>
I would NOT discourage ds from continuing to ask that daddy be safe and not <br/>
shot.  But, you also may need to have some family discussion about some <br/>
things happening in spite of our prayers.  That doesn&#39;t mean that God doesn&#39;t <br/>
love ds or daddy, but that God has another plan or will provide another way <br/>
or just that bad things sometimes happen to good people.<br/>
<br/>
It might not hurt to point out that not everyone that is shot dies.  Maybe <br/>
the police department has some reassuring statistics about this?  Let him <br/>
know that if something happens to daddy, his police buddies will get him to a <br/>
doctor ASAP and that they will also let your family know there is a problem.  <br/>
(ie go to sleep, you&#39;ll get woke up with a huge commotion if something <br/>
happens, or something like that)<br/>
<br/>
All of this paraphrased in ways that work best for your family, of course!  <br/>
There might be a psychologist at DH&#39;s work that would have some suggestions <br/>
for ways to deal with this fear.  It is a common one for spouses, parents and <br/>
children.  (my SIL is a city cop here in Olympia, WA...we&#39;ve had to deal with <br/>
this fear on a personal basis)  <br/>
<br/>
Encourage ds and daddy to spend good time together.  Help father and son <br/>
enjoy those times.  Not from a sense of &#39;it may be our last time together&#39; <br/>
but look how much we enjoy being together.  Let&#39;s cherish this time, right <br/>
now and make memories right now...when you are older we&#39;ll talk about these <br/>
things that are happening because they&#39;ll be memories.  (making any sense <br/>
here?)<br/>
<br/>
(starting to ramble...so delete if it&#39;s boring or inapplicable!)  When my DH <br/>
went to middle east (Qatar), DS overheard someone at church ask DH if he was <br/>
concerned about being so close to war torn countries and did he think he <br/>
would be in danger while he was there?  This scared DS quite a bit (gee <br/>
thanks!).  We explained in simple and clear terms that we felt strongly that <br/>
daddy was needed in Qatar at this time (it was a civilian job, we could have <br/>
turned it down, but we believe very much in personal revelation, given by God <br/>
to the individual.  It is our belief that this particular job offer was an <br/>
assignment with higher callings than mere employment.)  We explained that IF <br/>
Daddy should die while he was overseas, we would have comfort that it <br/>
happened while he was serving God (insert a cause you believe in...).  We <br/>
then went on to explain that we really didn&#39;t believe there was personal <br/>
danger.  That daddy would take precautions such as staying in touch with the <br/>
American embassy, the company he worked for had emergency evacuation protocol <br/>
in place, keep aware of the news, make friends with the locals, try to blend <br/>
in the crowd rather than drawing attention to himself (we are lucky here in <br/>
that with proper clothing he is the spitting image of an Arabian...that <br/>
American Indian Ancestry came in handy!) and that daddy would be praying for <br/>
his own protection and personal direction, as would we.<br/>
<br/>
From there, we pointed out that you never know when you are going to die.  <br/>
Lots of people die in car crashes or crossing the street or of a stroke, <br/>
heart attack or other unexpected health problems.  You have to live your life <br/>
the best you know how and try to let the rest of it (death, in this case) <br/>
happen when/how/where it happens.  DS was a bit clingy for a day or two and <br/>
we had some times of concern while DH was gone (Ben Lauden (sp) was very <br/>
active and had actually put out threats directed at the project DH was <br/>
working on, for instance).  But, overall, this approach worked well for our <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, DS and I were called upon to help his best friend and <br/>
her mother when the mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer almost <br/>
immediatly after DH went overseas.  I think the conversation we had already <br/>
had about death and never knowing when it happens helped him deal with the <br/>
death of his best friend&#39;s mother.  It was difficult, to be sure, but we did <br/>
a good job.<br/>
<br/>

I think you should talk it out with you DS.  Just because we don&#39;t talk about <br/>
things with our children doesn&#39;t mean they are still not concerned about it <br/>
or make it out to be more than it really is.<br/>
<br/>
As for what to tell him, hmmmmmm, maybe focus on the less violent side of <br/>
your hubby&#39;s job (helping people).  My DD is scared of the police because of <br/>
Daddy watching to much prime-time TV.....with her around(Cops). (Which is not <br/>

we decided early on not to have the tv on hardly at all as it does very <br/>

have the constant whining for things when we go in stores as he doesn&#39;t know <br/>

not to let the media control our children&#39;s lives. especially as we are also <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562877390">Corallyn, Hi-- my dh is a police officer, too.  I have a 5 yo son, and a 3 yo <br/>
son, and a 10 mo daughter.  For most of my children&#39;s lives, my dh has worked <br/>
day shift.  Sounds like yours is working 3rd shift now.    Where do you live? <br/>
 We live in So. Indiana.  You have said that you are very open with him... <br/>
how much does he know about police work?  Our boys really have not asked much <br/>
about getting shot.  They have very limited knowledge about guns.  I think <br/>
our oldest has asked if dh has ever shot anyone,  and dh told him that he had <br/>
not, and hoped that he never has to.  Dh explained that the gun was there to <br/>
be used only for protection when he was at work.  He keeps the explanations <br/>
&quot;short and sweet&quot; at this time in their lives.  Then he makes sure that the <br/>
kids get exposed to the many aspects of police work, such as helping people <br/>
in different ways.  They enjoy hearing the sirens on the squad car, visiting <br/>
the station, and wearing old uniform shirts.  Has your son watched much tv <br/>
where police dramas might be on?  Or does he have friends that have said <br/>
something to scare him , maybe?  One thing you can do is let your son see the <br/>
protective vest and maybe even put it on, so he can see how heavy it is.  You <br/>
can help him see how it is there to protect his daddy , just in case there <br/>
would ever be a &quot;bad guy&quot; that had a gun.  And then express that most police <br/>
officers don&#39;t get shot and don&#39;t use their guns very often.  Hopefully he <br/>
will begin to feel re-assured.  Maybe some library books on police officers <br/>
could be helpful, as they are light-hearted in nature, and maybe will be <br/>
helpful in lessening his worries.  Most of all, stress that police officers <br/>
are there to help people, and that is their main purpose.  Give examples such <br/>
as helping people if their cars break down, helping people settle arguments, <br/>
help to find someone who is lost, etc...  Just keep trying to reinforce the <br/>
other aspects of this line  of work, and keep reassuring him that most <br/>
officers never have to shoot people, and that most officers never get shot.  <br/>
I hope this helps a little!  Take care.  ~Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-615149707">When I talked to DH about it he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;make an issue of it with DS. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My suggestion would be to be as honest as possible.  People worry about loved ones.  We were just discussing that earlier this week.   You should not try to stop your son&#39;s concerns, as they are normal.  But I do think that you should try to alleviate some of the unneccassary worry.  However, he is always going to be concerned about his fathr at work, as long as daddy has a dangerous job.  Let&#39;s face it, cops do get killed at work, and that is overdramatized in movies and tv.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it would be extremely beneficial if your hubby could arrange a special &quot;take my son to work&quot; day with his superiors.  Let your son ride in the car with dad, see dad talking to people, taking statements, doing what he does, as long as he is exempt from taking the more dangerous calls that day.  People learn from experience, and if your son has the wrong impression about what Daddy does during the day, than all the talking in the wold will probably not change his mind.  He needs to see for himself.<br/>
<br/>
If letting him ride along is not legally possible, perhaps he can at least take him down to the station, show him around, let him sit in the squad car, talk to other officers about what they do, and maybe walk a safe beat with dad for a little bit.  Anything to help him see for himself what dad does, so that he can draw his own conclusions would be beneficial I think.<br/>

two things. One: Uncle has taken the kids on a tour of the fire station.<br/>
They got to see all the safety equipment, hear about the training, and find<br/>
out that while some calls are dangerous, many are not.  Two: We have gotten<br/>
videos from the library, some are called &quot;I want to be a ...&quot;.  These videos<br/>
are cute and not scary.  They show all the things a police officer does,<br/>
many of which are not dangerous.  They talk about the training and so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181076993">Actually, DS is quite familiar with DH&#39;s equipment. We<br/>
have been to the station a number of times and the<br/>
children have both been in the car and DH flashes the<br/>
lights etc. for them. They won&#39;t let family members do<br/>
ride alongs because of the liability and anyone who<br/>
does ride along has to be a certain age. They would<br/>
never let a 5yo do this for obvious reasons. My DH<br/>
patrols an area that is on its way down. He often<br/>
deals with family violence, death, people resisting<br/>
him and much more. I do point out other officers that<br/>
we see around town and what he appears to be doing.<br/>
Writing a ticket, helping someone in trouble. They are<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a situation in my home and I doubt any of you<br/>

&gt; to how to handle this situation. My DH is a police<br/>
