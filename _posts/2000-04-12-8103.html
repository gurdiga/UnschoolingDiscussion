<div id="ygrps-yiv-331972136">I have two daughters, 10 and 6, who have been homeschooled forever. We did<br/>
a little formal homeschool, but have really been unschooling most of the<br/>
time. I was wondering how, to what extent or even if, you explain<br/>
unschooling to your children.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I had explained it to my daughters, but every time we meet<br/>
someone who asks how school&#39;s going, they have a totally blank look and say<br/>
something like, &quot;Oh we didn&#39;t do anything today, we just played.&quot; I&#39;m<br/>
really glad that they don&#39;t realise that they&#39;re being &quot;schooled&quot; and that<br/>
they&#39;re free to play a great part of their day (I consider that to be a job<br/>
well done on my part) but at the same time their response worries me.  I<br/>
reminded my older daughter today that many people don&#39;t understand how<br/>
unschooling works- that we don&#39;t need lessons to learn, that they&#39;re<br/>
learning all the time even through games and just playing. She said, &quot;Well<br/>
I don&#39;t understand how it works either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her response has left me speechless! Part of me agrees with Hafidha...<br/>
&quot; They don&#39;t know that unschooling isn&#39;t about what you can<br/>
necessarily see on paper. It&#39;s about development, growth, independence<br/>
and love of learning - none of which can be conveyed on television in<br/>
a 2 minute video segment.&quot;...  or in a 2 minute conversation. But I also<br/>
feel we need to let people know that we&#39;re not flakes who just let their<br/>
children play all day. And I also think my daughter needs to understand<br/>
what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d love some feedback on this- what do you tell your children<br/>
about your homeschooling methods?  <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022355064">Last year when my son was 4 one of his ps friends asked why he does <br/>
not go to school, he said &quot;because I am a teacher&quot;<br/>
I did talk more with him about how he does decide what he wants to <br/>
explore so yes he is his own teacher. <br/>
