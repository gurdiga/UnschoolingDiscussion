<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460274637">This might get really long, but I hope it will help people who are <br/>
struggling with the issue.<br/>
<br/>
First, some background.  When I was in college, I lived with a girl <br/>
whose mother was a clean-freak and who had a maid.  Between the <br/>
mother and the maid, my roommate had never cleaned anything.  I&#39;d <br/>
been required to clean the entire house every Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
My roommate was constantly nagging me about my messiness because I <br/>
was unwilling to clean more often than every Saturday (and dishes <br/>
before bed when it was my turn).  I&#39;d vacuum once a week and she&#39;d <br/>
vacuum the other six days and yell at me about not doing my share.  <br/>
I&#39;d do the dishes before bed and she did them one at a time when each <br/>
became dirty.  She thought I was a slob and I thought she was <br/>
unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to my marriage.  I&#39;ve been married about six years and I <br/>
don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve yelled at my husband for being a <br/>
slob.  I haven&#39;t tried to make the kids do chores, partly because <br/>
they&#39;re so young (and partly because they&#39;re more strong-willed than <br/>
I am).  But I&#39;ve tried repeatedly to get my husband to clean up after <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve felt sorry for myself, &quot;I&#39;m the only one who cares how our home <br/>
looks.  No matter how often I complain about it, my husband doesn&#39;t <br/>
try to be neater.&quot;  And on and on.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve been pondering what&#39;s been said about cleaning.  Pondering <br/>
and pondering.  And I realized I was wrong to demand that my husband <br/>
clean to my standards, and it&#39;s as unreasonable to him as my roommate <br/>
seemed to me.  I&#39;ve been thinking about the fact that since I&#39;m the <br/>
only one who cares how this place looks, then it&#39;s my job to make it <br/>
look the way I want.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was loading the dishwasher and usually when I get done I <br/>
ask my husband to take out the trash.  To his surprise, I put on my <br/>
shoes and grabbed the trash bag.  He said, &quot;Are you going to take out <br/>
the trash?&quot;  And when I said that I was, he hugged me.  I said, &quot;Do <br/>
you really hate doing it that much?&quot;  And he said, &quot;Yes, I really do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I actually enjoyed taking out the trash.  It was a clear night and <br/>
the moon was bright and it was refreshing.  So I came back in and <br/>
grabbed the vacuum cleaner.  For the first time ever, my almost-five <br/>
year old said, &quot;Can I do it, mommy?&quot;  So I turned it on and sat on <br/>
the couch and he very carefully cleaned the entire floor by himself.  <br/>
And he was proud of himself for doing such a good job.  His two-year <br/>
old brother was clapping for him.<br/>
