I think you are becoming blurred in your sensibilites as to what is<br/>
generally acceptable, by what is acceptable in your own home.<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference. A big difference !<br/>
<br/>
Try going to a toddler group, or anywhere where parents are with their young<br/>
children, and call one of the other children a slug, and see what reaction<br/>
you get !&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m not sure what you missed in my post but none of what you said made a bit of sense. My sensibilites are not blurred, they are sharp as every thank you.<br/>
I never suggested calling any child a name in reference to their behavior, there was a joke made here that was taken wrong and I was defending the person that made the joke.<br/>
I only told how the term &quot;Slug&quot; was used by my dh in reference to HIMSELF (not a child) and I think you&#39;re trying to infer way too much.<br/>
