<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456830196">As a direct result of the recent food control conversation, I have <br/>
made a big decision.<br/>
I am a vegetarian and have raised my kids that way since birth.<br/>
They are (ds)8 and (ds)10. DH is not a veg. but never eats meat <br/>
except out in restaurants.<br/>
Sooooo, I have decided to let go control of my kids eating and let <br/>
them eat meat, if they want to. I told them they could try it, if <br/>
they wanted to, on Thanksgiving (organic turkey, and all). It will be <br/>
at my sisters house.<br/>
Their reaction when I told them this was &quot;Really? You mean I can <br/>
really have some if I want to?&quot;. That, and yipping and yelling.<br/>
I knew I would have to let go of the control at some point, but you <br/>
all have talked me into letting go now.<br/>
I know it&#39;s the right decision. It feels right to me.<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to give them more and more control of the food they <br/>
eat - we&#39;re still working on that at home. Seems they still really go <br/>
for sweets and junk like chips, but not too much. I know it&#39;s a <br/>
process.<br/>
Do you think I&#39;m making the right decision?<br/>
This act is a big deal for me.<br/>
If they like meat, they won&#39;t be vegetarians any more, like I am.<br/>
I&#39;m willing to accept that, though.<br/>
I guess we&#39;ll just see what happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962294145">Yes, I think you&#39;re making the right decision. They might like meat and still<br/>
choose to become vegetarians, y&#39;know? They might become huge carnivores for 2<br/>
or 3 years and then decide you&#39;ve got pretty good ideas after all. They might<br/>
become vegetarian &quot;lite&quot; and join you at home and dh at restaurants. You<br/>
never know, but what they do this week doesn&#39;t define what they&#39;ll do<br/>
forever.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I think you are making a good decision.  I was vegetarian for <br/>
about five years because it was what my body needed.  My oldest on <br/>
the other hand needs a lot of meat.  Oh, sure she can get lots of <br/>
protein other ways but it just never seems to fill her up like meat <br/>
does.  I think it is a difference in our bodies.  <br/>
Anyway, I let her have all the meat she wanted but she had to learn <br/>
to cook it for herself when I couldn&#39;t stand the smell of it.  She <br/>
learned and never once complained about having to cook it.  Of course <br/>
yours are a little younger but I&#39;m sure it will work itself out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232882931">Tia,<br/>
Thanks for your advice about eating meat.<br/>
I also wanted to say that I like the quote by Eleanor Roosevelt.<br/>
It really speaks to me! I will remember it from now on.<br/>
