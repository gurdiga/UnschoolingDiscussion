<div id="ygrps-yiv-849780120">I know I have been really quiet lately, but I have finally gotten <br/>
almost everything moved and we are settled in our new home! Where are <br/>
all the Kansas Homeschoolers? I have met a few, but could not find a <br/>
list or support group close by! So, I started my own! It is great out <br/>
here in the middle of corn and soybeans! I have hundreds of cattle in <br/>
every direction, and the farmers are baling their 2nd or 3 cutting <br/>
this week! What a change from city life!<br/>
Well, I just wanted to pop in and say hello! If there are any other <br/>
Kansas Homeschoolers out there, drop me a line... PLEASE! <br/>
