<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[PA] I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s accurate to say &quot;most&quot; women&#39;s service <br/>
programs are government-free, and even if they are not subsidized, <br/>
sooner or later, these women are &quot;set free&quot; to fend for themselves <br/>
and may end up with nowhere to turn but the government, which sets <br/>
them up for reliance on social programs and potential interference <br/>
from so-called child protective services -- even if there are <br/>
relatives standing by to help.  <br/>
<br/>
This is an aspect of the system which most Americans are naively <br/>
unaware -- there&#39;s no profit in keeping families intact or bringing <br/>
them back together, but there is plenty to be had in playing the <br/>
foster care/adoption game with our children.  The best way to keep <br/>
the funds rolling in is to divide and conquer -- separate the <br/>
parents first by making sure one admits to being a victim (whether <br/>
or not this is the actual case is not the main concern,) then <br/>
require legal and physical separation upon threat of removal of the <br/>
children.  There is no plan to reconcile the family or offer any <br/>
tangible assistance, which leaves the mother vulnerable to further <br/>
interference with the threat of losing her children hanging over her <br/>
head all the while.<br/>
<br/>
This is the tragic scenario we&#39;ve heard from family after family who <br/>
started out crying abuse based on false or imagined allegations and <br/>
ended up in real despair outside the home.  My grandniece&#39;s family <br/>
was nearly one of those statistics, but they persevered through the <br/>
CPS nightmare and lived to tell the tale.  I don&#39;t want to <br/>
alarm &quot;Irene&quot; -- just want to be sure that she is fully informed <br/>
about the hazards of claiming serious charges against the father of <br/>
her children.<br/>
<br/>
They are women helping women,  and they <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do it *because* there is abuse in the home.  If there is no <br/>
 </span></blockquote>abuse,  you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; probably don&#39;t need their services!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[PA] Unless one has been wrongly convinced that one is a victim, <br/>
which is what they did to my grandniece as a preschooler. I was <br/>
waiting for them to &quot;recover&quot; some memories from her mother as well, <br/>
in order to heap more molestation charges on the accused (her <br/>
stepdad.) Thankfully, the pseudo-psychiatrists in the guise of CPS <br/>
did not take it that far nor have the child removed from her home <br/>
(she was living with her parents at the time.)  <br/>
<br/>
Instead, they drug her stepfather (who had a spotless record before <br/>
this incident) away, and set an exhorbitant bail.  He languished in <br/>
jail for months before the judge decided there was insufficient <br/>
evidence to prosecute.  The man&#39;s marriage and career, not to <br/>
mention his reputation, was nearly destroyed by this ordeal.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is just one example.  As others have said, there was never <br/>
any indication of physical abuse in &quot;Irene&#39;s&quot; messages when we were <br/>
all discussing the pros and cons of her & the children leaving <br/>
home.  I missed Erica&#39;s message completely until I came across this <br/>
one, and realized that we were posting at approximately the same <br/>
time.  I hadn&#39;t looked back thinking that I was caught up with the <br/>
thread by then.  I hear a lot of fear and judgment based on past <br/>
experience in her sister&#39;s posts, but to say &quot;Irene&quot; is in denial <br/>
may be as untrue as saying that her husband&#39;s behavior is abusive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>[PA] &gt; &gt;&gt;I prefer to deal with my personal business in the privacy <br/>
of my own  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hoe, as long as there is no physical threat to life or limb.   &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>[Karen] There&#39;s more to abuse than violence.  <br/>
<br/>
[PA]  Yet, the term &quot;abuse&quot; itself is abused and used for something <br/>
as commonplace as a lovers&#39; quarrel.  I&#39;m sensitive to this as my <br/>
DIL was self-diagnosing her problems as abuse and co-dependency, <br/>
etc., etc., and I asked her to define exactly what those terms mean <br/>
to her.  IOW, are she and her baby daughter really in a better place <br/>
now that she and my son have alienated themselves from each other <br/>
over what they admit to be petty misunderstandings, immature <br/>
outbursts, and frustrated communique?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have a new perspective on the idea of &quot;violence&quot; since <br/>
learning about Nonviolent (Compassionate) Communication, but in the <br/>
absence of a serious physical threat to life or limb -- I would <br/>
personally think twice before abandoning my partner and my marriage <br/>
with no warning whatsoever (again, unless I had reason to fear an <br/>
emotional breakdown, outrage, and physical abuse to follow.)  <br/>
<br/>
If &quot;Irene&quot; has already suffered a black eye, then it&#39;s a question of <br/>
whether it was an isolated incident perhaps due to one too many <br/>
under the strain of circumstances.  I&#39;m not justifying it, just <br/>
trying to understand if this is a casual beer drinkin&#39; guy or if <br/>
he&#39;s on the verge of not being able to function due to his substance <br/>
abuse problem.  Assuming he&#39;s bringing home the bacon and &quot;Irene&#39;s&quot; <br/>
a SAHM, I&#39;m not sure where this diagnosis is coming from or if it&#39;s <br/>
a judgment call or simply fear of where things may be headed based <br/>
on past experience.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a shame to rip this man&#39;s life apart without warning or <br/>
counseling on one end or the other -- I know my husband isn&#39;t always <br/>
Mr. Nice Guy, and I might label some of his remarks obnoxious, but <br/>
not abusive, but it would devastate him if I made that kind of <br/>
decision.  Of course, if he ever hit me (even once) he would be <br/>
extremely sorry for it because I would never let him live it down.  <br/>
<br/>
In the first years of our marriage, I got a little too up close and <br/>
personal with my DH regarding something that was causing me <br/>
distress, and he pushed me backward a foot or so (never let go) till <br/>
I got the message to back off. I was livid that he laid his hands on <br/>
me(!) and reduced to tears, so yes, I completely understand that <br/>
there&#39;s more to it than meets the eye (no pun intended) -- I would <br/>
still be very careful to apply the label &quot;abuse&quot; with the wide <br/>
variety of definitions (from benign to criminal) being tossed around <br/>
ever-so-liberally these days.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>[PA] &gt;&gt; It&#39;s been a great comfort to discover that I do not <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have  to physically remove myself or anyone else from the premises <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; order to  resolve a conflict or challenge of any kind.  &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>[Karen] If all our  lives were oh so perfect!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; Karen<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, we can dream, can&#39;t we?!  Yes, I was talking about the ideal <br/>
and yes, it&#39;s easier said than done, but our lives don&#39;t have to be <br/>
perfect to make a change for the better and put this into practice.  <br/>
On the contrary, it&#39;s even more important to understand that there <br/>
are options within and that nothing and no one without can determine <br/>
the state of our being -- especially in what appears to be <br/>
challenging circumstances.  This is essential to our Spiritual, <br/>
Physical, and Mental welfare (and that&#39;s no SPaM!) <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, it&#39;s wise to be wary of any helpful &quot;services&quot; which <br/>
advocate extreme actions, unless the circumstances truly warrant a <br/>
complete detachment from another (and I think this must be much <br/>
rarer than is commonly believed.)  If the husband/parent is truly <br/>
abusive, he should be criminally prosecuted to the fullest extent of <br/>
the law and placed in rehab, FWIW.  <br/>
<br/>
Unless the black eye was documented as domestic abuse and charges <br/>
filed, I&#39;m afraid that &quot;Irene&quot; won&#39;t have much of a case against her <br/>
husband and leaving him will no doubt provoke him to anger.  Not to <br/>
say that she should stick around to gather &quot;evidence,&quot; but only she <br/>
can determine if she has taken every step possible to correct the <br/>
problem before making a break.  I thought that this thread was all <br/>
about helping &quot;Irene&quot; find some new ways to approach this problem, <br/>
and now she&#39;s back to square one -- love him or leave him.  There <br/>
must be a happy medium there somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing, unless we&#39;re missing something -- this man appears <br/>
to be little or no threat to the children if they have the courage <br/>
to ignore his requests outright (and perhaps &quot;sass&quot; him back,) but I <br/>
could be wrong.  My dad was no saint, but he had a lot of patience <br/>
with my attitude in the teen years and refrained from bopping me <br/>
when he had the opportunity.  Same with my DH.  All-in-all, it&#39;s <br/>
much easier to work on healing and reconciliation while together as <br/>
a family than when separated emotionally or physically. <br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Irene is the one who will make the choices she makes for her life.   She came <br/>
here for help, and she told me she&#39;s found all the responses helpful in  some <br/>
way.  But I believe the situation is beyond reconciliation without  drastic <br/>
action first.  At the very least something has to happen to protect  the <br/>
children from being called &quot;homeschools&quot; as if that means they&#39;re hopelessly  <br/>
stupid.  His communication is violent.   She still calls hiim  &quot;Honey&quot; when trying <br/>
to reason with him.  There&#39;s no reasoning with him at  this point, from all I <br/>
know of the situation.  <br/>

I agree, but it seems more that the mom was wanting a committee to rubber  <br/>
stamp her intent to leave and it wasn&#39;t about unschooling after all.  <br/>
 <br/>
Some of the posts made me truly cranky, because of the many dire  <br/>
possibilities that seemed to be blithely ignored.  &quot;Get divorced&quot; is some  of that easy <br/>
advice to find anywhere, along with &quot;just put the kids in  school.&quot;  Tra la.  <br/>
Like that makes life easy the next morning. It does  not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656706162">I can see why women of abusiers stay. This is truley unbeilvable to me. You all say give him another chance assuming I havent given him any yet. You make assumptions that i havent tried every avenue. Why would anyone think that I would have the power to change another human. Counsling is only good when both people are willing to accept and take responsiblility for their actions. Its crazy to bother trying when one of the parteners is placing blame souly on the other. Not to mention I dont want to go to counsling. I&#39;ve been, and it didnt work. I come away feeling guilty for wanting peace in my life, as if that is something I dont have the right to have. I shouldnt have to go into the details of my marriage. Its none of your business to be quite frank. The problem at hand was the verbal abuse that my kids endure from their dad because they are unschooled/homeschooled. Is that ok? I know you all are saying No, but some of you havent told me yet how to change that. Amazing huh, cant tell<br/>
 me can you, sure lots of resources I could use to help him right, but what if he doesnt want to be helped. Then what? I just stay and let myself and my kids be verbaly abused everyday of our lives, always walking on eggshells because we never know if he will be mad that day or not. Or better yet I take their rights away and put them back in school. All of the senerios that you all are saying I should &#39;try&quot; go along with what he wants, not what the other 4 people in the house want. Oh and he is not the only one who works. I work a 40 hour a week job for the same company as him, I just get to stay at home. I have had my right for peace taken from me and my kids for way to long. <br/>
<br/>
Just so you all know there has been physical abuse, he has grabbed me on several occassions and left bruises. Not to mention blackened my eye, drunk or not, he still did it. He walked away with nothing but a sick stomach. That is documented, the cops came and seperated us. Luckily the kids were not there to see it. <br/>
<br/>
I am not ruining his name he is doing that all on his own.<br/>
<br/>
I for one am starting to get really upset with the help the husband comments. Thats what got me here to begin with, I was always trying to help him. Make him happy, give him peace, give him love, ect....now look at me. Still here in the same place sick to death of listening to his degrating sarcasim. I am not saying every woman should leave at the first sign of unhappiness, but if you have lived with unhappiness for more than a year I would say it was time to find a different avenue. Leaving isnt the answer, finding my power and taking it back is. What I do with it is still yet to be decided. I can say though if I leave it will be because there was no resolution to this problem, not because I am some selfish woman who got pissed off at her husband because he wouldnt watch the kids so she could get her nails done. I have been far from selfish. This isnt just about me anyway, its about the well-being of my kids and their futures. They have a right to have peace in their lives just as<br/>
 you do. that is all I am really asking for. The right to wake up and not be yelled at or flipped off, just for being alive......<br/>
<br/>
As far as i am concerned this is about unschooling because its about my kids rights being imposed upon. They are not allowed to learn in a peaceful enviroment free from critisims and sarcasim.  <br/>

That&#39;s true.<br/>

 <br/>
It only takes one person to tell you how to change it, but none of us can  do <br/>
anything but offer suggestions and things you might not have  considered.  <br/>
You got LOTS of that, and free too.  Not one payment to a  counsellor, you <br/>
didn&#39;t have to even get in your car and drive to someone&#39;s  office.  This was free, <br/>
and I thought it was pretty thorough and  potentially VERY helpful, and now <br/>
we&#39;re getting jumped all over for it.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
You wrote in your very first post this:<br/>
&quot;My problem lies not with my kids or myself but with my husband. To be  frank <br/>
he is down right abusive, verbally, not physically.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Just for your information, you were not honest with me and so I&#39;m sorry I  <br/>
brought this to the list at all.<br/>

both  people are willing to accept and take responsiblility for their actions. <br/>
Its  crazy to bother trying when one of the parteners is placing blame souly on <br/>

that is  something I dont have the right to have. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, sorry you weren&#39;t pleased with the advice given. Seems you neglected  <br/>
to tell us a lot of the situation, so it&#39;s hard for us to give our best advice  <br/>

I hope you can work it out so that joy becomes a priority.<br/>

should &#39;try&quot; go along with what he wants, not what the other 4 <br/>
people in the house want. ...<br/>
<br/>
[PA] Steffie, I was under the impression that you and the kids were <br/>
seeking peace in your household and offered a way to begin the <br/>
process through conflict resolution.  It wasn&#39;t about helping your <br/>
husband, _per se_, it was about helping yourselves and bringing him <br/>
along for the ride while you focus on learning better ways to <br/>
interact. It&#39;s clear that your children, if not you & your spouse, <br/>
could use some survival tools in the area of communication.  Am I <br/>
correct?  <br/>
<br/>
I heard that your husband was willing to go to counseling at one <br/>
time, so I can only guess that he&#39;s not adverse to the idea of <br/>
reconciliation through some means, but is probably feeling just as <br/>
desperate, trapped, and hopeless by the seeming lack of viable <br/>
options at you seem to be. I&#39;d like to know if this is an accurate <br/>
depiction of your needs and if you see him also wishing for peace, <br/>
understanding, and respect in a different way.  <br/>
<br/>
A closer look at Nonviolent Communication (NVC - www.cnvc.org) would <br/>
reveal that it is a self-help process (vs. counseling) that requires <br/>
no cooperation from others to create lasting and effective change <br/>
for everyone&#39;s peace of mind.  IOW, DH doesn&#39;t have to agree to it <br/>
or learn it for himself in order for you & the kids to have an <br/>
impact on the relationship which will serve your needs for harmony <br/>
and understanding (I&#39;m hearing the Fifth Dimension in the background <br/>
now :o)  <br/>
<br/>
Marshall Rosenberg teaches warring factions both at home and abroad <br/>
how to hear criticism as a plea for help rather than a call to arms, <br/>
and it works.  IMHO, we&#39;ll all need to learn this one sooner or <br/>
later, if we are to create and maintain healthy relationships.<br/>
<br/>
I hear your distress and frustration at the confusion experienced by <br/>
some of us on this list which may come across as harsh and <br/>
judgmental.  I, for one, neither desired nor requested to hear the <br/>
graphic details of your life and marriage as one who usually feels <br/>
uncomfortable about revealing intimate details to an audience of <br/>
virtual strangers.  Yet, many of us needed to understand enough to <br/>
justify the advice to go (which seemed radical based on your <br/>
original posts) or to stay (which seemed like a reasonable option.)  <br/>
<br/>
I heard fear of a custody battle, not fear for your life, in your <br/>
initial plea for help in resolving this conflict.  I honestly <br/>
thought it was a communication issue, as implied by the context of <br/>
the situation, and responded accordingly.  Now I&#39;m guessing that <br/>
your husband was not formally charged in the altercation you <br/>
mentioned, and he has refrained from displaying his temper in this <br/>
manner in front of the children thus far?  No pressure to answer, I <br/>
just wanted you to know what I&#39;m hearing in your response.  <br/>
<br/>
And after all is said and done, it still appears to me that the <br/>
years of conflict have basically worn you both down to a frazzle, <br/>
and I&#39;m amazed either one of you has stuck it out this long -- yet <br/>
isn&#39;t that just as much an indicator that there is mutual concern <br/>
for the welfare of the family as it is that someone has been in <br/>
denial and under coersion/abusive circumstances for the entire <br/>
relationship?  What &quot;expert&quot; (lay or professional) is qualified to <br/>
determine the mental health of any one individual?  It was a shocker <br/>
for us to learn that the government has now decided to mandate <br/>
mental health screening for all children in the System -- what a <br/>
Pandora&#39;s box this will open!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m glad to hear that you are finding some power over your <br/>
situation, and that perhaps the decision to leave everything behind <br/>
is not final just yet.  Before I bow out of this discussion, I <br/>
wanted to make sure that you understood my suggestion fully because <br/>
your message implied that there was some confusion on this score.  I <br/>
see NVC as a practical and workable solution to the problem of <br/>
communication in the home (in any scenario, but especially if <br/>
someone&#39;s bark is basically bigger than his bite.)  <br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, this naturally leads to better relations in the <br/>
family and ultimately to permanent conflict resolution, often easier <br/>
and faster than anyone ever thought possible.  Life is more perfect <br/>
than we realize, if we have eyes to see and a little love in our <br/>
hearts (and the world will be a better place, and the world will be <br/>
a better place... incurable romantics and flower children sing <br/>
along.)<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;re probably not in the mood for a songfest, would you be <br/>
willing to reflect back to me what I said about meeting your own & <br/>
your family&#39;s needs (kids and/or husband) through conflict <br/>
resolution so I can be sure the message came across as intended?  It <br/>
would give me greater peace of mind knowing that I made myself clear <br/>
on the point that I was advocating empowerment through self-reliant <br/>
methods of improving communication skills.  It&#39;s good practice for <br/>
me, too!<br/>
<br/>
Keepin&#39; the Faith, Hope, and most of all ~<br/>
<br/>
Love, Penne & the Crew<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669259133">Irene, this is going to sound ignorant.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t take it personally.  <br/>
 <br/>
The subject is highly personal to you.  It couldn&#39;t be more  personal.<br/>
 <br/>
But, the responses have taken a tangent, a rabbit trail into the  <br/>
hypothetical.  It left your personal situation some time ago and  became about theory.  <br/>
The people who are responding don&#39;t have all the  details of your life, and <br/>
they are responding mostly to what&#39;s in their  imaginations.  We do it all the <br/>
time here on lists.  *All the  time*.  That&#39;s the way lists work.  This is what <br/>
happens on  them.  <br/>
 <br/>
As your friend, I would suggest that you pretend the posts are not about  you <br/>
at all.  That the posts were about an incomplete fictional character  named <br/>
Irene.  Then reveal what you want on the list to make the character  more <br/>
developed, and let others do so, as well.  In your imagination you can  compare <br/>
Irene&#39;s life with your own, as if you were watching a movie and finding  common <br/>
ground with your own life.  And then, when it gets painful, remember  that it&#39;s <br/>
only a movie, only a fictional character.  <br/>
 <br/>
I really don&#39;t see how being on the list during the rest of the topic is  <br/>
going to be helpful unless you can compartmentalize it away from the real  Irene. <br/>
 It&#39;s kind of like me reading all the Iraq blogs and watching  the news and <br/>
reading the newspaper.  Call me, okay?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451147953">Again you are making assumptions. Assuming I had my mind made up when I first sent you the note.  I didnt, and still in my message earlier said that if I leave had yet to be decided. You and some of the others have blasted how I should be compassionate to him assuming I never was.The irronic thing about that is there was no compassion being shown to me by some of you, telling me to save my marriage at all costs.  Telling me I should seek counsling when I was asking about the unschooling issue and how to handle that. It is obvious to me that you have had no incounters with abuse, and you are far from qualified to even suggest to someone what they should do. The only reason why I sent a message to you in the first place was because you obviously hold a big reputation for being good in the unschooling circle. I was hoping to find answers to my problem on the issue with my kids. I didnt realize you all would take it upon yourself to tell me what I should do in my marriage. There were<br/>
 several people who informed me that what my husband was doing was far from ok, so that when I started really looking into my marriage. I have lived with this for 30 years, and for you to be ugly and make assumptions to an entire group about me and what I feel was wrong. You had no right. I tried to end the topic by telling you all it was resolved and you continued to talk about me like I had little or no thought on what I was doing. Totally disrepectitng my wish to end a topic about my situation. Not to mention the women who my be lurking about, in the same abusive situaion and now are afraid to talk because some of you are hell bent on getting the abusier help and not the people being beat down.  I was trying to say you have no idea what I am really going through and if you dont mind lets let this one go. I had pulled something useful from each comment before and was on the road to getting help. But yet you the moderator continued. I didnt waste the groups time, you did. If you<br/>
 want to be a goody goody more power to you, but the next time someone comes to you for help about a situation similar to mine, do them a favor and say, I am all for the woman submitting and taking what ever the man has to give so sorry I cant help.....that way there is no miss communication. I admit it I was wrong to think you could help....Peace to all who read this and I am sorry for any inconvience this might have besotowed on you. I have got help and I am thankful that I was able to have several of you so understanding and loving, I will be forever greatful to you. You know who you are...:-) <br/>

It only takes one person to tell you how to change it, but none of us can  do <br/>
anything but offer suggestions and things you might not have  considered.  <br/>
You got LOTS of that, and free too.  Not one payment to a  counsellor, you <br/>
didn&#39;t have to even get in your car and drive to someone&#39;s  office.  This was free, <br/>
and I thought it was pretty thorough and  potentially VERY helpful, and now <br/>

You wrote in your very first post this:<br/>
&quot;My problem lies not with my kids or myself but with my husband. To be  frank <br/>
he is down right abusive, verbally, not physically.&quot;<br/>

Just for your information, you were not honest with me and so I&#39;m sorry I  <br/>

<br/>
Unschooling cannot work if one parent is deadset against it.  <br/>
I think your story is further evidence of that.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t work if a custody agreement requires school, and many do so.<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t work if both parents are having to work fulltime and the <br/>
kids are going back and forth between houses, and one parent is deadset against <br/>
it.<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t work if the mother is the one who wanted to unschool but <br/>
she has lost custody entirely.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no possible way a thousand unschoolers can advise a way to make <br/>
unschooling work in an unworkable situation.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can&#39;t tell about encounters with abuse from what was written here.<br/>
&quot;Qualified&quot; to suggest?<br/>
I asked a list with over 1500 members, who were able (as you were) to join <br/>
without proving any qualifications.   Each reader needs to be qualified in her <br/>
own mind to make decisions based on whatever input she can find.  If you want <br/>
someone &quot;qualified&quot; to make suggestions, then find a lawyer or a counsellor who <br/>
has a license to give you advice in exchange for large sums of money.  Good <br/>
luck finding one who&#39;s even heard of unschooling, though.<br/>
<br/>
If your problem wasn&#39;t primarily about unschooling, then you just asked in <br/>
the wrong place, and that&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was hoping to find answers to my problem on the issue with my kids. I <br/>
didnt realize you all would take it upon yourself to tell me what I should do in <br/>
my marriage. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Your children and decisions about them are part of your marriage.  They can&#39;t <br/>
be separated from that.   <br/>
<br/>
-=- I tried to end the topic by telling you all it was resolved and you <br/>
continued to talk about me like I had little or no thought on what I was doing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Joyce Fetteroll (one of several moderators and one of the <br/>
listowners) wrote about how these discussions work:<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone tosses <br/>
an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get batted about. At that <br/>
point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the person who tossed the idea in. <br/>
It&#39;s about the idea and how well and cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless <br/>
the tosser keeps jumping in and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Joyce<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
Once a discussion begins it has a life of its own.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Totally disrepectitng my wish to end a topic about my situation. Not to <br/>
mention the women who my be lurking about, in the same abusive situaion and now <br/>
are afraid to talk because some of you are hell bent on getting the abusier <br/>
help and not the people being beat down. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Your wishes aren&#39;t what drives the unschooling discussion list, though.  <br/>
<br/>
And for my part, I want to give advice that helps children first, and mothers <br/>
second.   Making mothers comfortable at the expense of children is common in <br/>
this culture, but not altogether healthy.  Unschooling is different, in <br/>
needing a situation in which the child&#39;s needs are central.   It&#39;s entirely <br/>
understandable that if a mother is NOT in a situation where she can provide that, <br/>
unschooling might not be viable until she gets in a safer, more stable place.   <br/>
<br/>
Not everyone can unschool.  Not everyone can or should.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was trying to say you have no idea what I am really going through and if <br/>
you dont mind lets let this one go.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You can let it go, but now it has come to the point that the real topic is <br/>
honesty.  If someone comes here with any problem, large or small, and gives us <br/>
false information, or changes the story midstream, the feedback isn&#39;t as good <br/>
as it could have been (on the less irritating side) and it&#39;s a waste of our <br/>
time (in the more irritating way).  And it&#39;s worth discussing honesty even if <br/>
half the people involved in this discussion are gone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But yet you the moderator continued. I didnt waste the groups time, you <br/>
did.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to help you, steffieb, voluntarily and as well as I knew how, <br/>
which was to ask LOTS of people to help you.  They did.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- If you want to be a goody goody more power to you,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;know what?<br/>
I DO want to be a goody goody.  I want to continue to volunteer my time to <br/>
help other people who ask for help, but every time someone responds as you did, <br/>
it makes it a little harder to want to help others.<br/>
<br/>
-= but the next time someone comes to you for help about a situation similar <br/>
to mine, do them a favor and say, I am all for the woman submitting and taking <br/>
what ever the man has to give so sorry I cant help.....that way there is no <br/>
miss communication.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is bullshit.  Either you didn&#39;t read carefully what was written and <br/>
really think about it, or you&#39;re just being malicious.  The documentable <br/>
miscommunication was yours.  On the other end, not ONE PERSON suggested you submit and <br/>
take ANYTHING.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Peace to all who read this-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nonsense to write that after such a wad of hostility.<br/>
It&#39;s like leaving a sack of flaming dogpoo on a porch, ringing the doorbell <br/>
and saying &quot;Have a nice day.&quot;<br/>

frustration on the group for what she sees as unwarranted judgments <br/>
and unrealistic expectations, but I can certainly imagine why it may <br/>
have been true that these people were at the point of doing violence <br/>
to one another when they first sought marital counseling years ago.  <br/>
It&#39;s a shame that the &quot;expert&quot; they consulted had no more to offer <br/>
than any other man on the street.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have much hope that Steffie will explore Nonviolent <br/>
Communication or anything else if she has this much resistance to <br/>
suggested alternatives, and seems to have skimmed any post which is <br/>
not in agreement that she and her children as victims of an abusive <br/>
person.  I get the impression that it came as a complete surprise to <br/>
her when we didn&#39;t all immediately see her spouse as an unforgivable <br/>
ogre who should be punished for his transgressions against innocent <br/>
children, if not their mother.  <br/>
<br/>
There is no quick & easy fix to this or any problem, but there are <br/>
ways to make it better sooner than later.  I devoured all of the <br/>
literature on NVC when I first discovered it a month or so ago, and <br/>
got my kids involved in making a significant change in the way we <br/>
interact.  Not to say that we didn&#39;t have our share of skeptics who <br/>
had seen other methods tried and failed, but we have persevered <br/>
through the learning phase and the tension is slowly but surely <br/>
dispersing as we learn how to speak &quot;street giraffe.&quot;  Awesome to <br/>
see the whole process work its magic with a little effort... <br/>
<br/>
Steffie, my parents have been struggling in a difficult relationship <br/>
for sixty plus years.  There is no doubt that there is a deep and <br/>
abiding love between them, despite their differences.  My siblings <br/>
and I picked up on the best and the worst features of that marriage, <br/>
and applied it to our own relationships.  One of my brothers tied <br/>
and loosed the knot (voluntarily and otherwise) three times before <br/>
he finally decided life itself wasn&#39;t worth the effort.  The other <br/>
has been through as many engagements for the past thirty years of <br/>
adulthood while never once making it all the way to the altar.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister and I have held on to our husbands and families for dear <br/>
life (both older brides in our mid-twenties -- hers lasting for <br/>
thirty-five years now, mine for twenty) for better and for worse, <br/>
just like dear old mom (married the year after graduation to her <br/>
highschool sweetheart before he headed off to war.) We see it as a <br/>
conscientious and informed decision made for our own sakes as well <br/>
as for our spouses and children.  We are committed to making it work <br/>
and have faith that this is entirely possible.<br/>
<br/>
Have we made a grave mistake based on our delusions which will be <br/>
passed on to the next generation or will we eventually find a way to <br/>
break the cycle like Erica?  Again I say, who is qualified to make <br/>
that determination?  Like I told my stepson when he was going back & <br/>
forth between homes, playing one parent against the other, never <br/>
facing the situation head-on -- not for lack of desire, but for lack <br/>
of the necessary tools to resolve conflict -- if you cannot make <br/>
things work for you in your present situation, what are the odds of <br/>
success in any other?  He is discovering this basic truth for <br/>
himself now that he searched for love outside of the family circle <br/>
and ended up with another broken home (this time with a child of his <br/>
own to deal with the consequences of a failed relationship.)<br/>
<br/>
In my faith this outcome is Scientifically-based -- IOW, the way <br/>
Life works.  One can ignore or run away from a given problem, but <br/>
there&#39;s absolutely no way to get around it and move on to the next <br/>
level without the knowledge and skills to build a solid foundation.  <br/>
The basic problem must first be resolved satisfactorily, either here <br/>
or hereafter.  Losing a person and relationship (tough to do with <br/>
kids involved) may seem like the only out, but it is guaranteed to <br/>
compound the situation if the basic needs have not been addressed.  <br/>
Compassionate communication is a -step- in the right direction for <br/>
me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41719123">I have to admit that I was hostile towards those of you who were saying get help and try and work through the problems with him. I have been told that so many times and tried it and it never worked. I agree with Sandra and Penne I defenatly see your point now. Not to say that I am withdrawing what I said earlier though, I just could have been a bit nicer about it. I did feel attacked and was venting my frustrations in this matter, for that I appologize. To bad I cant just call you all up and explain it better. I am not wanting anyone to see him with horns, although I know that was the impression I was giving.I can see where I was over reacting to the messages sent. Domestic situations are always hard to deal with and maybe it is something that should be left alone in the future although I have to say I have got a whole heck of a lot of wonderful advice and some advice I wanted to scream at. Overall the experiance has been a great learning tool and I am thankful for the opportunity to<br/>
 find resources. If I offended any of you I appologize, that wasnt what I was trying to do. I am far to close to this situation to be commenting on it. Its painful and at times I feel trapped, overwhelmed and scared. I was hurt that so many people were making assumptions about my personality when you have never met me before. I should not have taken it as a personal attack but rather one that is fictional as Karen said earlier. I sent the message before I read hers, oops....:-) We are all looking for support here and I have found it. Would it be possible to maybe take me out of the topic if you all want to continue talking about it? This is all I am going to say on the matter now. Im gonna move on to some of the other discussions and see if I cant get some ideas from those. Thank you for your help and letting me see into myself, its been great~~ Stephanie &quot;Irene&quot;<br/>

Telling me I should seek counsling when I was asking about the unschooling  <br/>
issue and how to handle that. &lt;snip&gt;  I was hoping to find  answers to my <br/>
problem on the issue with my kids. I didnt realize you all would  take it upon <br/>
yourself to tell me what I should do in my  marriage.    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling as an educational alternative (much less a  lifestyle!) can&#39;t <br/>
happen when one parent is vehemently against it. Or when  a judge orders school. <br/>
Or when kids are shuffled back & forth in a nasty  custody battle.<br/>
 <br/>
Folks here gave advice based on the information given----which was that  <br/>
there WAS no abuse. You&#39;re mad at *us* for giving advice that didn&#39;t relate to  <br/>
your situation. If you had been HONEST about your situation, well, maybe the  <br/>
advice would have been different. No one here would advise staying in an abusive <br/>
 marriage. But we&#39;d also say that unschooling would be the *least* of your  <br/>
worries.<br/>
 <br/>
You weren&#39;t up front in describing your home life, yet *we&#39;re*  getting <br/>
virtually abused by you for giving out reasonable  advice---considering the info <br/>
that was offered.<br/>
 <br/>
We were giving UNSCHOOLING advice----saying that it doesn&#39;t work well in  <br/>
families that don&#39;t work well. Fix the family, THEN maybe unschooling can work.  <br/>
You said nothing of this *monster* you&#39;re living with! Please be more honest  <br/>
when asking for advice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is obvious to me that you have had no incounters  with abuse, and you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>are far from qualified to even suggest to someone what  they should do.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
First----you have no idea who here has had an abusive past.<br/>
 <br/>
Second----most of us regular posters certainly know enough about  unschooling <br/>
to advise that the family needs to be as whole and healthy as  possible for <br/>
unschooling to work. We were trying to get you to that point. Your  misleading <br/>
information did NOTHING to get us to realize that there was an  extremely <br/>
unhealthy situation. DON&#39;T go blaming us.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There were<br/>
 </span></blockquote>several people who informed me that what  my husband was doing was far from <br/>
ok, so that when I started really looking into  my marriage. I have lived with <br/>
this for 30 years, and for you to be ugly and  make assumptions to an entire <br/>
group about me and what I feel was  wrong.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, maybe some good DID come out of Sandra&#39;s posting this to the list.  <br/>
Bitch some more, will ya&#39;?<br/>
 <br/>
Jeeeezus!<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck getting out of your abusive relationship. But I&#39;d advise that  <br/>
*that* is more important than unschooling. So don&#39;t come asking for unschooling  <br/>
advise until your home-life is an acceptable place to rear a  child.<br/>

than others, and some types of counseling works better for others.  <br/>
If couple counseling does not work for your marriage, perhaps you can <br/>
seek individual counseling for yourself. The result will have a <br/>
ripple effect. However, you state that you &#39;don&#39;t want to go to <br/>
counseling&#39;.  I sense a lot of stubborness, anger, hostility and a <br/>
back and forth attitude coming through via your e-mails.  You attack <br/>
the list, then apologize for your attacks.  This pattern is probably <br/>
present in your family dynamics.  I do the same thing in times of <br/>
stress.  This is something I am working on and getting better at.  <br/>
When my partner points this out to me, I get MAD.  But, he&#39;s right.  <br/>
Have you ever considered going to a female, Jungian counselor?  You <br/>
might consider giving it another try- it was a world of help for me <br/>
on so many levels.  There is probably a good reason why your last <br/>
counseling experience did not work.  Maybe you didn&#39;t give it enough <br/>
time.  Maybe your counselor was not right for you.  Maybe you were <br/>
having a hard time processing some of the truths that were surfacing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535470873">Hi Pam (that&#39;s my sister&#39;s name, too :o) I would be more than happy <br/>
to offer a few suggestions on getting started in NVC.<br/>
<br/>
The following&#39;s from a previous post (sidenote: I&#39;m impressed with <br/>
Sandra&#39;s -=-quotation designators-=-, but don&#39;t wanna be a copycat, <br/>
so I&#39;ve been exploring the keyboard to find other cool combinations. <br/>
Nothing appears to be as simple, easy, and elegant so far :o)<br/>
<br/>
=:=I devoured all of the literature on NVC* when I first discovered  <br/>
a month or so ago [in an article at Mothering.com,] and got my kids <br/>
involved in making a significant change in the way we interact. Not <br/>
to say that we didn&#39;t have our share of skeptics who had seen other <br/>
methods tried and failed, but we have persevered through the <br/>
learning phase and the tension is slowly but surely dispersing as we <br/>
learn how to speak &quot;street giraffe.&quot; Awesome to see the whole <br/>
process work its magic with a little effort...=:=<br/>
<br/>
The online resources at CNVC.org are the best place to get a quick <br/>
start -- very comprehensive.  After getting a basic idea about how <br/>
the process works, I would suggest reading the advanced class notes <br/>
(even as a novice) for some advice on introducing this to others <br/>
without turning them off by the mechanics of the method.  That&#39;s <br/>
what I meant by &quot;street&quot; or idiomatic giraffe (you&#39;ll find out where <br/>
animals fit into the picture soon enough :o)  <br/>
<br/>
After exhausting the online resources and joining a couple of <br/>
discussion groups here on Yahoo! -- Synergy Communication and NVC-<br/>
parenting -- I ordered the &quot;Basics of NVC&quot; video set (suggested for <br/>
those without local support groups) and a couple of puppets (one <br/>
giraffe, one jackal) for the kids.  The puppets are very well made <br/>
(and reasonably priced) and the kids enjoyed interacting with them <br/>
right out of the box.  After a day or so of free play (I&#39;m sounding <br/>
very &quot;education&quot; even though it was just plain ole fun,) we sat down <br/>
and watched the videos together.  <br/>
<br/>
There was only one semi-reluctant camper guilted into giving it a <br/>
chance in the beginning (old habits die hard) and a few moans as <br/>
Marshall Rosenberg (founder of CNVC and workshop leader) opened up <br/>
the session in song.  I&#39;m afraid it reminded them a bit too much of <br/>
dear old mom playing folk music on my guitar :oP) but Marshall soon <br/>
won the whole clan over with his candor and flair for interacting <br/>
with a group -- not to mention his puppeteering skills (a bit <br/>
cheesy, but amusingly so.)  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re ordering ears next -- visual aids &#39;R&#39; us :o) In the meantime, <br/>
one of the kids crocheted me a pair of giraffe ears for my birthday <br/>
not long ago -- they&#39;re so cute and a hoot to boot!  Group hug time <br/>
and warm, fuzzy feelings all around... best present I&#39;ve gotten in a <br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a new edition to a book called the &quot;Compassionate <br/>
Classroom.&quot;  They tell me that it&#39;s an art-based textbook written by <br/>
a couple of NVC trainers, one of which is an advisor to the <br/>
GlobalVillageSchool.org  We&#39;re not much for lesson plans and I&#39;m not <br/>
exactly sure how this book is set up, but hopefully it was <br/>
influenced by Marshall, who worked with John Holt in the early years <br/>
and is an advocate of homeschooling.  I figure it will have some <br/>
good ideas to play around with, anyway, and the NVC-parenting group <br/>
is discussing possibilities of using it for a virtual chat/workshop <br/>
in the future.<br/>

The  following&#39;s from a previous post (sidenote: I&#39;m impressed with <br/>
Sandra&#39;s  -=-quotation designators-=-, but don&#39;t wanna be a copycat, <br/>
so I&#39;ve been  exploring the keyboard to find other cool combinations. <br/>
Nothing appears to  be as simple, easy, and elegant so far :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Use it!  I use it because it doesn&#39;t take a shift key and it&#39;s  fast.  <br/>
Piano-keyboard kind of fast.  Faster than three of the same  characters.   With HTML <br/>
in mail it&#39;s just no good anymore to  use the double less/greater than for <br/>
quotes, though those are the  coolest and just like French quotation marks.  Oh <br/>
well.  -=-this works  pretty well-=-<br/>

It&#39;s like a trill.  Meant to say that.  And I use my 3rd and 4th fingers, <br/>
which are a fast and good-angled combination (both piano-trill-wise and <br/>
computer-keyboard-wise).<br/>
