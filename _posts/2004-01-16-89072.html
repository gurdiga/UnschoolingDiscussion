<div id="ygrps-yiv-994962762">Hello, just to get things straight here and set down the basic<br/>
information, Im fourteen, live in South Florida, and I am currently a<br/>
Freshman in high school.  I&#39;ve been intrested in the idea of<br/>
unschooling for a couple of years now, my friend introducing it to me<br/>
at first, not trying to push anything onto me, just giving me some<br/>
resources to check out and consider. I soon plan to buy The Teenage<br/>
Liberation Handbook after reading a three-chapter excerpt online. But,<br/>
currently, I&#39;m not quite sure what to do of my situation.<br/>
<br/>
My brother, currently a junior in Boston University, attended the same<br/>
high school Im in now, passing with very high grades and getting to<br/>
know the teachers well, graduating second highest in his class (forgot<br/>
the exact term for it). And every teacher instantly recognizes my last<br/>
name, especially since Im in most of the honors classes he was in at<br/>
my age (along with one AP), and it seems like that I must do well<br/>
because I am his brother.<br/>
<br/>
I just feel that everything about the way public schools are set up is<br/>
utterly incorrect and shouldn&#39;t be, yet I can&#39;t do anything about it,<br/>
because I&#39;m &quot;a stupid teenager&quot;. I admit I have been trying to avoid<br/>
school as much as I can, which is somewhat easy for me as long as<br/>
guilt doesn&#39;t take over my mind. My father works from 5:00am until<br/>
6:00pm and my family only has one car, I live about a half an hour<br/>
drive from my school, so if I am to miss the bus, I have no way of<br/>
getting to school. But, the county only permits 10 excused absences,<br/>
of which I have 14, if Im absent again I will fail my classes, repeat<br/>
the grade, and my parents may be brought to court for, as the notice<br/>
said, &quot;not seeing that I am kept in school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I say I feel that everything about school is wrong, yet I still feel<br/>
guilt and annoyance when I do poorly on tests and the like, but I<br/>
don&#39;t want to do any of the subjects with which I am charged. One of<br/>
my main intrests is building computers, and I want to dabble a bit in<br/>
programming, which I know is readily learnable on one&#39;s own. But, my<br/>
school does not offer anything of the like, and Im swamped with enough<br/>
work to sink a ship already, leaving little free time, having to read<br/>
6 to 8 books every 9 weeks, 90% of which are things that intrest me in<br/>
the very least.<br/>
<br/>
I can legally drop-out at the age of 16, which I will be Januray 19th<br/>
of 2005, my Sophmore year, but I don&#39;t know how much longer I can put<br/>
up with this life. My administrator has already talked to me, telling<br/>
me various things about I have to stay in school for a future, how<br/>
I&#39;ve &quot;given him my word&quot; that I&#39;ll try to do good, and even had me<br/>
tell it to my parents over the phone. So, I feel...stressed, to say<br/>
the least..<br/>
<br/>
Any input would be very, very much appreciated, thank you very much..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your administrator is full of s&%t. :) You have a future, it&#39;s just up to you to make the choices as to what it will look like.<br/>
 Have you shared this with your parents? I&#39;d suggest you print this out and hand it to them to start. Or, first, you have an interest. Could you do some research on what online resources, local courses you could take to learn what you want about programming? If your school is inadequate, point out those inadequacies. Since you have a goal, make up a plan to work towards it and share that with your parents.<br/>
ANyhow...Check out www.unschooling.com as well. there are other postings by teens in similar situations there with some great advice<br/>

<br/>
Have you talked to your parents about<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling?  <br/>
<br/>
If you have The Teenage Liberation Handbook, maybe you<br/>
can give a copy to your parents to read too.  <br/>
<br/>
Showing them that you have done the research already,<br/>
and can present your case to them maturely and<br/>
factually, not overly emotional, will go a long way to<br/>
helping them have the confidence that this can work.<br/>
<br/>
You can do this.  Breathe.<br/>
<br/>
Set yourself some short-term goals, such as obtaining<br/>
a copy of The Teenage Liberation Handbook, putting<br/>
together an information packet of on-line resources<br/>
for your parents, interviewing unschoolers you know<br/>
and their parents, documenting ways you have learned<br/>
things on your own before, areas where you can show<br/>
yourself as being responsible and mature, things like<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>

This is a kind of lame suggestion, but might not seem lame to your parents.<br/>
<br/>
Look into The American School.  It might be a light enough work-load to give <br/>
you tons of free time, but until your legal drop-out date it might appease <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to consider is going to college.  Is there a community college <br/>
or trades school near you that would let you take some computer classes AND <br/>
some &quot;solids&quot; (maybe even for college credit)?  Maybe you could talk to one of <br/>
their counsellors/advisors about what alternative programs he knows of in that <br/>
school or in the community otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could get a job with a computer place near you, doing repairs or <br/>
installations, and that might help you and your parents feel better too.  In New <br/>
Mexico, kids can work at 14, with some restrictions, but for instance when it <br/>
had to do with &quot;school hours,&quot; I wrote a letter to my son&#39;s employer and said <br/>
&quot;We&#39;re homeschooling and so our school hours are flexible, and what he learns <br/>
on the job will be considered part of his education anyway.&quot;   You might find <br/>
a sympathetic adult in your area to help you arrange to call something a <br/>
&quot;mentorship&quot; or intern/apprentice/practicum... some term that would impress people <br/>
on a resume and in the air. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615266115">Hi James, <br/>
<br/>
I think you know exactly what to do in your situation, as far as <br/>
education goes. I mean that intuitively you know. Your heart knows. <br/>
You feel it in your gut. And you are starting to work it out <br/>
intellectually too.<br/>
<br/>
Actually making it happen is, I know, a different thing, because you <br/>
don&#39;t just have to worry about yourself but about what your parents <br/>
will think. Because you&#39;re a minor, the law says that your parents <br/>
have a say in what you do. So, worst case scenario, they freak out <br/>
and force you to stay in school. You can in that case either <br/>
practice a form of civil disobediance and refuse to go anyway, <br/>
though I imagine there would be some stress associated with that <br/>
choice. Or you could just make up your mind to &quot;serve your time&quot; <br/>
until you can legally drop out of school. Stress there too, only you <br/>
know which is an easier choice to live with.<br/>
<br/>
But you are clearly an intelligent, thoughtful person, and therefore <br/>
have the tools to be able to present your case well. Your parents <br/>
may be stuck in the mindset that says that success at school means <br/>
success in life. However, they won&#39;t be able to help but be <br/>
impressed by the initiative you are taking in doing this research. <br/>
Unless they completely refuse to listen to you in the first place, I <br/>
think you&#39;ve got a very good chance of convincing them to allow you <br/>
to start directing your own education. <br/>
<br/>
I recommend you read John Holt, John Taylor Gatto, and Grace <br/>
Llewellyn. (Just to start. :)) Gather together a packet for them, <br/>
highlighting parts that especially speak to you. You might even <br/>
write something up  an essay explaining the benefits of this form <br/>
of education. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I say I feel that everything about school is wrong, yet I still feel<br/>
guilt and annoyance when I do poorly on tests and the like, but I<br/>
don&#39;t want to do any of the subjects with which I am charged.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it would probably be helpful for you to look for the true <br/>
source of this guilt and annoyance. I bet anything it&#39;s not because <br/>
you are not learning what is not valuable to you. It probably has <br/>
something to do with what others are thinking about you (even if you <br/>
know that their opinions are misguided) and being confronted with <br/>
their negative reactions somewhere down the line.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, you are thinking about this *now*. Which means <br/>
that you are getting an earlier start than most people do in <br/>
overcoming the feeling of obligation to meet others&#39; unreasonable <br/>
expectations. (Some people never manage to, a tragedy.) <br/>
<br/>
&quot;One of my main intrests is building computers, and I want to dabble <br/>
a bit in programming, which I know is readily learnable on one&#39;s <br/>
own. But, my school does not offer anything of the like, and Im <br/>
swamped with enough work to sink a ship already, leaving little free <br/>
time, having to read 6 to 8 books every 9 weeks, 90% of which are <br/>
things that intrest me in the very least.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And this will be a strong point in your argument. Success depends on <br/>
learning, and you will learn well only that which you are interested <br/>
in and care about. It is absurd and illogical to instead devote your <br/>
energy to laboring over things that you are not interested in and do <br/>
not care about. As you have already figured out, that is not <br/>
accomplishing anything positive.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My administrator has already talked to me, telling me various <br/>
things about I have to stay in school for a future, how I&#39;ve &quot;given <br/>
him my word&quot; that I&#39;ll try to do good, and even had me tell it to my <br/>
parents over the phone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Try to think about it from his perspective. He has no idea what is <br/>
going on in your head, so to him maybe it looks like you are just <br/>
aimless, lazy, short-sighted, whatever. He sees the potential in <br/>
you, though, and this makes him think, geez, I have to do something <br/>
here to make sure this kid doesn&#39;t do anything to jeopardize <br/>
himself. But here is the thing. He is mistaken. And if he knew he <br/>
was mistaken, he wouldn&#39;t expect you to keep your word, he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even have asked you for it in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, you shouldn&#39;t feel obligated to keep your word in this <br/>
situation. First, because it is based on a basic lack of knowledge <br/>
(that of the admin and your parents.) Second, it was made through <br/>
coercion (expressing concern and disappointment in someone is always <br/>
a good technique to manipulate them into doing what you want them to <br/>
do!) Third, keeping your word will harm you, and breaking it will <br/>
not harm anyone else. You might decide, though, that it would be a <br/>
compassionate thing for you to do to try to explain that to them; <br/>
perhaps if they understand your thinking their fear will be <br/>
alleviated somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and please send updates about how it goes!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hi James,<br/>
<br/>
Starting by reading and research is a good idea. However it is difficult to<br/>
see how you could become a homeschooler without getting your parents on<br/>
board and supportive. I strongly suggest that you collect all your<br/>
information and be able to present it to them, as has been suggested,<br/>
especially beginning with the legalities of homeschooling in Florida. There<br/>
is all the legal information at the NHEN website. Your parents need to feel<br/>
secure that they will not be prosecuted if the State�s regulations are<br/>
followed.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, you will notice I am saying homeschooler rather than unschooler. I<br/>
suspect that parents suddenly presented with the notion of unschooling for<br/>
the first time, may balk and initially have the belief that you are just<br/>
goofing off. I am perhaps assuming too much � maybe they already know about<br/>
the concept. Nonetheless, many people come to unschooling gradually. I<br/>
suggest that you present to your parents a �study program� that includes all<br/>
the things you are into, especially the computer stuff, with some idea of<br/>
where these things might take you. As they become more relaxed, and see you<br/>
taking responsibility for your own learning, and as they learn more about<br/>
unschooling, the structure you begin with will fade to become what you can<br/>
truly enjoy. Also I suggest that you bone up on homeschoolers who have made<br/>
good without a traditional education, and the number of folks who have good<br/>
college degrees who were homeschooled. <br/>
<br/>
As well as the book Pam suggested, you might find it helpful to get �The<br/>
Unprocessed Child� � the author�s daughter continues to enjoy great academic<br/>
success at college. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that the important thing will be to reassure your parents that you<br/>
will not grow up to be a deadbeat, at least not because you changed your<br/>
educational situation. There are many resources available at HYPERLINK<br/>
&quot;http://www.unschooling.com/&quot;www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
Check on the message boards. Someone very recently was posting about a teen<br/>
e-list also, so check the archives of this list. There is a wonderful<br/>
article about a teen rising out of school in a recent Life Learning<br/>
magazine. Make sure you include information about �deschooling� for you and<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
In the event that you can�t convince your parents to join you on this<br/>
journey immediately, there are some articles around about families who are<br/>
unschoolers at heart, but have some of their children in public school,<br/>
usually from the child�s choice. I realize that this is not your situation.<br/>
However, the focus is on how to gain from the system without becoming<br/>
invested in it or damaged by it � a kind of skeptical detachment � they may<br/>
help you anyway. I believe at least one is at HYPERLINK<br/>
&quot;http://www.sandradodd.com/&quot;www.sandradodd.com <br/>
<br/>
You might also investigate local homeschooling support groups, especially<br/>
any teen groups, and possibly sports organizations for homeschooler, if you<br/>
are interested, and look for some mentors in your special interest areas who<br/>
are not part of the school system. (This is a good idea even if you stay in<br/>
school for now) The very volume of information will be reassuring to your<br/>
parents, and help demonstrate your commitment. <br/>
<br/>
I alluded to the idea of you taking responsibility for your learning � and<br/>
that is really very key. If you have frustrations or difficulties they will<br/>
be all your responsibility to work through � you won�t be able to blame the<br/>
bus, the principal, or any notion of having to live up to your brother�s<br/>
glory, for any problems. It is important to tell your parents not only that<br/>
you are seriously unhappy at school, but to show them that you have serious<br/>
interests and a genuine desire to keep learning and pursuing your dreams.<br/>

Good point.  A forced confession or promise isn&#39;t usually considered legally <br/>
binding, I don&#39;t think.  And &quot;force&quot; can take many forms.   I think you were <br/>
absolultely coerced into that &quot;promise.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if you spend another year in school just not taking it seriously maybe <br/>
you could make something interesting of it.  Maybe you could take notes on <br/>
really crazy happenings in school, or quote teachers having said outrageous things <br/>
that would upset other people&#39;s parents if they knew.  You could collect them <br/>
all up and it could even become your ticket to freedom!  If the school knew <br/>
you were saving all evidence that they were often-to-occasionally goofy or <br/>
cruel, they might start HELPING you find some ways to find another place to be!  <br/>
Seriously.  You could play investigative reporter to the point that they might <br/>
write you a nice recommendation to the nearest university&#39;s journalism program!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And it would amuse you in the meantime, one way or another.  And it would be <br/>
eye-opening to your parents, as you share your collection with them.<br/>

Hi.  I have a 14 year old son, Andrew.  He has been unschooled and <br/>
homeschooled (the latter meaning he has worked on curriculum type <br/>
stuff).  Interestingly, he wants try actual highschool next year.  <br/>
And I KEEP TRYING TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT!  However, we live far away <br/>
from his homeschooled friends, and he wants more &quot;teen&quot; time. I made <br/>
him read your post and said, &quot;See, assignments he&#39;s not interested in <br/>
are taking up 90% of his time...do you really want that?&quot; He just <br/>
shrugged.  Feel free to email me and give me an idea of what a <br/>
typical week in school would be like. I would love for Andrew to have <br/>
some idea, before going into it with no clue. I went to a tiny <br/>
private school, so other than course load, it&#39;s a different <br/>
experience from a big public school.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to tell you that I have both of Graces&#39; book everyone is <br/>
talking about.  The ARE great.  I bought the Guerilla Learing one <br/>
just so Andrew and I would be prepared for highschool next year, and <br/>
that he can make it his unschooling experience, instead of their <br/>
shool experience. Dumbing Us Down, The Hidden Curriculum of <br/>
Compulsory School by John Taylor Gatto just ROCKS!  Get your parents <br/>
to read that and hopefully they will pull you out of school so fast <br/>
it&#39;ll make your head spin.<br/>

Unschooling.com is a great site.  Also, there is a yahoo group for <br/>
unschooling teens.  There are only 30 or so people on it.  That might <br/>
be a good place to read how the other half lives.<br/>
