<div id="ygrps-yiv-568359176">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing about two things...<br/>
<br/>
First, I am really interested in listening to unschooling stuff online, while I&#39;m working at my desk. I&#39;ve already explored You Tube, and did a search for &quot;audio files&quot; on Sandra&#39;s website (where I was led to the link mentioned below). If there are any other recommendations or links for listening, I&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I went to this site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a> to listen to the audio file, and it automatically started playing, but there were two conversations happening at the same time. I was hearing a man&#39;s voice and a woman&#39;s voice at the same time. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a problem with the page, or if the problem is with me &lt;g&gt; but I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to play one conversation at a time. Clicking on the &quot;bars&quot; at the bottom didn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, from someone who&#39;s reading and learning lots :-)</div>

They&#39;re not set to come on automatically.<br/>
Maybe you could click just below that to go to the internet archives  <br/>
and download your own files straight onto your computer, and then  <br/>
listen to them however you&#39;d listen to anything on your computer.   <br/>
(Bypass my webpage?)<br/>
<br/>
Did you see this?<br/>

Some of those lead to some other things.<br/>

Thanks. I clicked on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.archive.org/details/PeacefulParentingTalkdoddprystowsky">http://www.archive.org/details/PeacefulParentingTalkdoddprystowsky</a> and was able to play it from there, without downloading anything to my computer.<br/>

The same happened with me. The files are set to autoplay or something.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are using the chrome browser. Use firefox to watch the page and<br/>
they will play one by one. You can also download the audios to listen at<br/>
leisure. They are longish, and contain loads of stuff I&#39;d like to hear more<br/>
times, so downloading them each time through the page doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
<br/>
That is what I tried. Both ideas worked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225076247">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
They do both autoplay simultaneously when you use the chrome browser.<br/>
Perhaps there may be a way to embed them to be more cross-browser friendly?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps add in a line there to change browsers if they start playing at<br/>
the same time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513275173">I&#39;ll move one of those to another page so browsers with autoplay can  <br/>
do one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
If your browser starts them automatically (they are set to be quiet  <br/>
until someone clicks play), then mute it while you read and then  <br/>
reload the page for it to start over if you want to listen.  I&#39;ll go  <br/>
and change that now.  Easier for me to do that than for people to use  <br/>
different browsers!!<br/>
