unschooling, you will waste your money on a curriculum.<br/>
And it will reinforce the fears.<br/>
It&#39;s fear that is driving his desires right now....thinking outside the box <br/>
takes time.<br/>
Ask him what he&#39;d do if it were suddenly summer vacation right now.<br/>
Maybe point out some famous people that were homeschooled/self-taught.<br/>
Einstein did lousy in school, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson....<br/>
There are oodles of people in history that did badly in school, were <br/>
considered quite daft and ended up very succesful in their own way.<br/>
I would definitely give him a copy of Grace Lewellyns&#39;s &quot;Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook&quot;.<br/>
Just to get him thinking of the possibilities.<br/>
Spend your money on art supplies, interesting foods, trips to the beach, <br/>
mountains or desert, visits to aquariums, museums, whatever piques his <br/>
interest (or yours) rather than spending it on a curriculum.<br/>
If unschooling is the true desire, then the curriculum is just going to slow <br/>
the journey to there.<br/>

at this.  You learned this and that and that and that in the last week.&quot;<br/>

There&#39;s a world of life between paying big bucks for him to continue to do <br/>
something you don&#39;t really believe in and &quot;forcing him to unschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could ask him if he&#39;s willing to pay for his own curriculum.  (I guess <br/>
he&#39;ll say &quot;NO!, are you crazy!?&quot;)   And you could say you&#39;re not either. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Or just tell him to wait a while and you can look for a curriculum if he <br/>
still wants one in.... October.  By then he&#39;ll probably not want one.<br/>

That seems cruel to me. It seems like a contrived way to force unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think asking him what it is he really wants and him seeing that you (or anyone else ((school)) ) will not try and coerce him. He needs to have some time to know that things are not going to be forced on him, and that could take some time and yes, that might even mean letting him get a curriculum. You don&#39;t have to spend hundreds of dollars.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why?  Shouldn&#39;t the goal be to help people find ways to overcome <br/>
hurdles and detours?  If someone&#39;s child is that upset with the idea <br/>
of unschooling, giving them what they ask for (or a variation of it) <br/>
in a non-coercive way and discussing it frequently might be the best <br/>
way to get them to see how unnecessary it is . . . especially in a <br/>
family where the other children have embraced unschooling fully.<br/>
<br/>
Denying it to someone who is that insistent, seems counterproductive <br/>
and also seems to go against the &quot;child-led&quot; aspect of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there are many paths that lead to unschooling and many detours <br/>
along the way.  I&#39;m certainly not going to tell someone they have to <br/>
use the path I took.<br/>

They need to take a path that will get there, though.<br/>
<br/>
Dragging it out for years before they understand it isn&#39;t beneficial.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think we should help families find it but I think we should help<br/>
families help their kids.<br/>
<br/>
I really think it depends on the kid. If a kid was in love with curriculum<br/>
because that&#39;s the mentality he&#39;d bought into, then I&#39;d definitely find ways<br/>
to ease him out of it.<br/>
<br/>
If he was in love with the *idea* of curriculum and I knew his need for it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t extend to actually doing it, I&#39;d help him find what he wants --<br/>
which isn&#39;t necessarily what he&#39;s asking for. (I thought the ABeka was<br/>
already purchased. I certainly wouldn&#39;t fork over that kind of money for an<br/>
experiment that I was sure was going to fail.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what he really wants is a plan. So I&#39;d sit down with him and discuss<br/>
what his goals are and ways to meet them and help him draw up a plan.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;d also need to talk about nonacademic goals like happiness and<br/>
satisifying who he is.<br/>
<br/>
Then after a week or a month or whatever, I&#39;d talk to him again to see if he<br/>
wanted to revamp his goals and this methods and how they were working so<br/>
that he didn&#39;t get the idea that if his methods weren&#39;t working or if the<br/>
goal didn&#39;t seem so desirable that he wasn&#39;t a failure.<br/>

use them for a couple of weeks and then be OK with unschooling.  LOL!  We <br/>
haven&#39;t ever used big, complete curriculum packages like A Beka EVER... it&#39;s <br/>
always been eclectic mixes of stuff covering the basics.  Anyway, thanks to <br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, I guess I better give a better background of why/how we&#39;ve been <br/>
homeschooling up until last week, and maybe you guys can see how my ds is <br/>
coming from where he&#39;s coming from!  : )<br/>
My older two attended a private, Catholic school through 4th and 2nd grade.  <br/>
My ds was miserable there his last year and begged to be homeschooled.  So we <br/>
decided that that would be the best thing for him.  We then gave my dd the <br/>
choice of staying or leaving.  After quite a bit of thought, she decided she <br/>
wanted to be homeschooled.  Neither of them was challenged at all there <br/>
academically and were bored to death.  My dd liked the social aspect, which <br/>
would have been her only reason for staying, I think.  <br/>
So, our first year home I use Sonlight which my long time homeschooling <br/>
sister reccomended to me.  We got a lot accomplished that year, and the kids <br/>
seemed to enjoy it, I&#39;d say so far, that&#39;s been our best year at home so far. <br/>
 Probably because a) the kids were just *so* happy and thankful to be home <br/>
they&#39;d have done just about anything asked of them to continue with it and b) <br/>
it was our only year without either a pregnant mom or a baby around.   <br/>
<br/>
The next year, we didn&#39;t use Sonlight because we couldn&#39;t afford it for all <br/>
of the kids (last year&#39;s stuff had mostly been loaned from my sister and it <br/>
was just for the older two).  We hasd Alpha Omega math, Learning Language <br/>
Arts through Literature, planned on using the Sonlight booklists and the <br/>
library for history, and then just some various units and such for science.  <br/>
BUT, we didn&#39;t really do much of that, the entire school year I was either <br/>
pregnant or there was a newborn baby needing lots of care.  We did get some <br/>
things accomplished, but it was usually after some arguing.<br/>
<br/>
This year was pretty similar to the last one, only maybe a little more of a <br/>
relaxed curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
My son is just now, at the thought of unschooling wanting all this <br/>
A Beka and such and I just can&#39;t bring myself to spend $500 on something <br/>
he&#39;ll drop in a few weeks and not get much of anything out of it.  Even used, <br/>
it would still cost atleast $250 or so which is a lot to spend for less than <br/>
a month of worksheets. Even spending $75 for a bunch of Spectrum type <br/>
workbooks is a lot for us when it&#39;s something we *know* will be dropped <br/>
shortly and not have much benefit for the time used.  And just a few little <br/>
structured things *isn&#39;t* what he wants.  So, for right now,  Sandra&#39;s <br/>
suggestions have probably been the best ones for our situation.  My dd and I <br/>
are going to a homeschool convention next month, so even saying that we&#39;ll <br/>
hold off on buying it &#39;til then would probably be enough, because as I&#39;ve <br/>
said before, he just talks about how he wants A Beka and doesn&#39;t do the stuff <br/>
we have right now.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make things any clearer?  I honestly don&#39;t want to get caught up in <br/>
listing all the educational things he does because that&#39;s been a major issue <br/>
here - me wanting the kids to do things &quot;to fill up it this lesson plan&quot; (we <br/>
had been filling in blank lesson plans with what we&#39;ve done school wise, <br/>
after it&#39;s been completed) and that would be a terrible thing for *us* to do, <br/>
while trying to move closer to unschooling.  I am currently struggling with <br/>
that issue, actually - for example, when I was out, my 12 yod told me that <br/>
her 8 and 6 y/o brothers had asked her to help her play a Family Math game <br/>
and my first question was &quot;Did you put it on the lesson plan?&quot;  Her comment <br/>
was &quot;Mooommm... I thought you wanted to *unschool*, not just do different <br/>
things.&quot;<br/>

things. Can you think of a bigger turn off than a poorly written, cheap<br/>
curriculum? In my 15 yrs of parenting, I&#39;ve learned one sure thing...<br/>
the more I refuse them of some &#39;thing&#39; the more they seem to want it.<br/>
It&#39;s taken a long time to realize that *their own conclusions* that<br/>
something is not for them weighs far more than me telling them so. (and<br/>
that&#39;s quite different from me not telling them but them making a choice<br/>
because they know how I&#39;m going to react if they make the &#39;wrong&#39; one).<br/>

particularly with bianchifam7 Sandra, that I do not believe that it is <br/>
&quot;wrong,&quot; even in the teensiest weensiest bit, to not get a curriculum where <br/>
cost prohibits same.  If you can&#39;t get, you can&#39;t get.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110580014">Go to your local Goodwill and pick up some used ABeka materials there.<br/>
Some will be used, yes. but you can often find things that have only a<br/>
few pages marked on. It&#39;ll cost you all of a few dollars. <br/>
Then, it won&#39;t be long before he&#39;ll be over this craving for ABeka and<br/>
you can introduce him to all the *other* wonderful books by visiting<br/>
Borders and the library ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter (unschooled all the way) has been thinking about going to<br/>
school next year (if the school schedule doesn&#39;t interfere with the<br/>
soccer practice schedule, which may be a problem because the school is in<br/>
a tiny town of 800 people, and soccer is in a larger town of 50,000<br/>
people 35 miles away... but I digress). She&#39;s very curious, mostly. We&#39;re<br/>
trying to set up a visit but it&#39;s been hard, with all the stuff she does<br/>
(so I think that actually fitting in school every day will be even<br/>
harder... and I&#39;ve said that... we&#39;ll see). So, anyway, she wanted some<br/>
&quot;schoolbooks&quot;, to see what schoolkids did. In that case, I think<br/>
acquiring schoolbooks for her was the right thing to do, and I did. <br/>
<br/>
The total cost, BTW, was .65. I had a 3rd grade spelling workbook lying<br/>
around that I&#39;d bought at a thrift store for .15 and was planning to sell<br/>
on ebay, and I gave that to her. She did most of one chapter, including<br/>
setting up a &quot;schedule&quot; for herself of doing one page a day. We talked a<br/>
lot about phonics, because some of the worksheets involved sorting words<br/>
according to the vowel sounds, and she didn&#39;t know what a &quot;long o&quot; or a<br/>
&quot;soft a&quot; were - although she can read anything and surprised me by<br/>
spelling almost all of the words correctly for the &quot;pretest&quot;. That whole<br/>
thing lasted less than a week, although she did ask me to give her words<br/>
to spell aloud sometimes for a weeks weeks after that.<br/>
<br/>
The math textbook was .50, at the library booksale. She did the first<br/>
chapter test, writing the answers in the text, although I pointed out<br/>
that the schools wouldn&#39;t accept that, and she pointed out that this was<br/>
*her* book that we&#39;d bought, not a school&#39;s book. I explained what the<br/>
meant by &quot;number families&quot;, and what &lt; and &gt; meant. She asked if the<br/>
answers were all correct, and I told her they were, and she wrote &quot;A+&quot; at<br/>
the top and that was the last of the math book. That was all in February,<br/>
I think....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why?  Shouldn&#39;t the goal be to help people find ways to overcome <br/>
&gt; hurdles and detours?  If someone&#39;s child is that upset with the idea <br/>
&gt; of unschooling, giving them what they ask for (or a variation of it) <br/>
&gt; in a non-coercive way and discussing it frequently might be the best <br/>
&gt; way to get them to see how unnecessary it is . . . especially in a <br/>
&gt; family where the other children have embraced unschooling fully.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Denying it to someone who is that insistent, seems counterproductive <br/>
&gt; and also seems to go against the &quot;child-led&quot; aspect of unschooling.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If my 11 yo wants a math workbook, we get her one. She likes them. Roxana <br/>
(14) once wanted to be taught how to diagram sentences - I had no clue - but <br/>
I bought her a workbook. <br/>
<br/>
But, I think what Sandra is reacting to is that there is a different tone <br/>
here in Sandra (mom of 5)&#39;s son&#39;s desire. HE specifically said he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to unschool, that he wants his mom to tell him what to do. In other <br/>
words, he isn&#39;t wanting to take responsibility, he is wanting to NOT take it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So - Sandra is saying that as unschoolers we should not recommend catering to <br/>
THAT aspect of the situation. I agree.<br/>
<br/>
However, I also think that she can take what he wants (to have his learning <br/>
controlled, to have some sort of guarantee that he&#39;ll be taught &quot;what he <br/>
needs to know&quot;, etc.) and offer him something that might appeal to him but <br/>
still hand over responsibility to him. <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of very cool &quot;learning materials&quot; - and I guess I call them <br/>
curriculum, but they aren&#39;t that in the sense that some people mean that. I&#39;m <br/>
thinking of something like the &quot;Math for Smartypants&quot; book by Marilyn Burns <br/>
or &quot;The Joy of Mathematics&quot; by Theoni Pappas or maybe some of the Brown Paper <br/>
School books. They are activity-based. The authors speak TO the reader, <br/>
they&#39;re not in that weird 3rd person passive tone that most textbooks use. <br/>
They follow what is called a &quot;constructivist&quot; theory of mathematical <br/>
education - which seems to me to be a good way to get launched into <br/>
unschooling - which is really, to me, radical constructivism applies to all <br/>
areas of learning. Here is a little definition of constructivist mathematics <br/>
education: &quot;...constructivism is the philosophy that knowledge cannot be <br/>
provided in some final form from parent to child or from teacher to student <br/>
but must be actively assembled in the mind by each learner in his or her own <br/>
way. The responsibility for expanding what one knows, or for constructing new <br/>
knowledge, rests primarily on the learner and his or her efforts to achieve <br/>
understanding.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - I do think that it is possible to choose &quot;better or worse&quot; materials and <br/>
that if a kid wants &quot;school&quot; - that instead of just getting cheap workbooks <br/>
and doing school or leaving him floundering by just tossing him &quot;to the <br/>
workbooks&quot; (sort of like &quot;to the wolves&quot;) that maybe getting some of these <br/>
kinds of learning materials - that DO hand the responsiblity for learning <br/>
over to the learner - is a better step. Let the kid think you&#39;re &quot;doing <br/>
school&quot; if that&#39;s what he need to think -- but don&#39;t do it. Instead, come up <br/>
with some materials that have activities to do - together or on his own.<br/>
<br/>
--pamS<br/>
Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854402970">I don&#39;t mean to keep beating this poor horse, but I guess I&#39;d restate what I<br/>
said this way:  If you don&#39;t understand all your options, then how can you<br/>
make informed choices?<br/>
<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t understand unschooling enough to trust it, then I&#39;m not sure<br/>
what you can do without undermining his trust of you.  I think I&#39;d get him<br/>
some nice, inexpensive workbooks (the Key to series springs to mind) and<br/>
continue to point out in a sweet and calm way, the fun and Learning that&#39;s<br/>
going on with the rest of his siblings.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t go *anywhere* without my sons &quot;office&quot;.  This time around, it&#39;s an<br/>
orange plastic case we bought at an office supply store.  Unlike a backpack,<br/>
it&#39;s flat and gives him a hard surface to draw on.  There is a clamp at the<br/>
top too, to keep papers from blowing around. About one inch deep, and<br/>
hinged, it holds all his important stuff.  He keeps paper and pencils for<br/>
drawing, various card games and D & D manuals, dice, tape and scissors with<br/>
him.  We just got a travel Master Mind game this week that fits perfectly.<br/>
Maybe you could come up with something like this for your son, and he could<br/>
carry it with him on the way to fun places.  The workbooks could be in<br/>
there, as well as the kind of stuff I mentioned above (or whatever else he&#39;s<br/>
interested in?).  That way, he&#39;d have to option to spend time on the<br/>
workbooks or to participate in whatever else was going on at the time.  I&#39;ll<br/>
bet that eventually, given enough other interesting options, he&#39;d slack off<br/>
on the workbooks.  <br/>

I agree with you on this one completely.  Turn the situation on it&#39;s <br/>
side a little and ponder it the other way; If I said that little <br/>
Johnny was afraid to go to public school because he didn&#39;t think he <br/>
would learn enough there.  Would you then force him to do it?<br/>
So if little Johnny is afraid of unschooling and mom wants him to <br/>
embrace it, which is the better way to get him there, acknowledge his <br/>
fears and slowing help him overcome them by offering what he needs <br/>
when he needs it, or just acting like his fears and thoughts don&#39;t <br/>
matter and refusing to help him get what HE wants for &#39;school&#39;, and in <br/>
this case, &#39;school&#39; means whatever little Johnny wants it to mean.<br/>
<br/>
Or is it only child-led if the child leads the way the unschooling mom <br/>
wants him to, or thinks he should?  Regardless of where it came <br/>
from that fear of unschooling is part of the child.  You aren&#39;t <br/>
necessarily going to make that go away by putting it off for a month. <br/>
 It might get better or it might get worse.<br/>

&gt; I agree with you on this one completely.  Turn the situation on it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; side a little and ponder it the other way; If I said that little <br/>
&gt; Johnny was afraid to go to public school because he didn&#39;t think he <br/>
&gt; would learn enough there.  Would you then force him to do it?<br/>
&gt; So if little Johnny is afraid of unschooling and mom wants him to <br/>
&gt; embrace it, which is the better way to get him there, acknowledge his <br/>
&gt; fears and slowing help him overcome them by offering what he needs <br/>
&gt; when he needs it, or just acting like his fears and thoughts don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; matter and refusing to help him get what HE wants for &#39;school&#39;, and in <br/>
&gt; this case, &#39;school&#39; means whatever little Johnny wants it to mean.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or is it only child-led if the child leads the way the unschooling mom <br/>
&gt; wants him to, or thinks he should?  Regardless of where it came <br/>
&gt; from that fear of unschooling is part of the child.  You aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; necessarily going to make that go away by putting it off for a month. <br/>
&gt; It might get better or it might get worse.<br/>

I would love to discuss this issue on site, but I cannot for the life of me <br/>
understand the issue as described.  Can you rephrase it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s pretty much what I think.  If a kidlet thinks he can&#39;t <br/>
learn without a curriculum, don&#39;t just say, &quot;yes you can&quot; and be done <br/>
with it.  Give them what they are asking for (within reason) but then <br/>
leave the responsibility to actually do it with them.<br/>
<br/>
Then if the rest of the family is unschooling in a more traditional&#39; <br/>
(weird word to use here but I think it fits) way,  maybe the one <br/>
schooly child will come around to it naturally and with less stress <br/>
and worry.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I can.  And I guess my thinking is colored a little by <br/>
Wyndham&#39;s anxiety right now, but it seems to me, that if a child is <br/>
afraid of letting go of school completely, it might make them worse to <br/>
&#39;force&#39; unschooling on him.  Although it sounds like the issue is now <br/>
resolving itself for Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
And there is this thought running through my head, that it sounds like <br/>
some here are saying it should only be child-led if it fits some <br/>
expectation of what unschooling should be.  In general people say that <br/>
curriculum is fine if the child chooses it, but then given specific <br/>
situations, they say no, don&#39;t do that.  <br/>

<br/>
IF that were true, it&#39;s only a month.  <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true, and I think it&#39;s a statement that shows a lack <br/>
of understanding of unschooling.  If a child goes the month of May, 2002, <br/>
without a formal curriculum and learns NOTHING, then we have all of us made a <br/>
big mistake.<br/>
<br/>
If a child goes the month of May, 2002, and learns quite a bit just becuase <br/>
it&#39;s impossible not to, then in June, July and August, he will EASILY (if he <br/>
really is stuck in school-mode) slack, because it&#39;s summer vacation.  And in <br/>
September, he and his mother can look back over four months of learning and <br/>
make a different agreement then if he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
A month of no-learning is not going to happen.<br/>
