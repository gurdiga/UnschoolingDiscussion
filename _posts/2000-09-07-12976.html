<div id="ygrps-yiv-3984882">Goodness sakes, I have a friend in another state who just had a<br/>
baby one day last week.  She didn&#39;t know she was pregnant!!!  How<br/>
on earth do you ~DO~ that???<br/>
<br/>
She says she didn&#39;t feel good and that she felt like she needed to<br/>
use the bathroom and couldn&#39;t.  When her dad got home from running<br/>
errands (she is 21 and living with her father who is a Pastor),<br/>
she handed him the new 5 lb 12 oz baby girl.<br/>
<br/>
All he could think to say was &quot;sit down until your mother gets<br/>
home&quot; LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857122897">Kandy, that&#39;s unbelievable!  I&#39;ve always wondered about these <br/>
folk who get pregnant while they&#39;re on the pill or something and <br/>
don&#39;t notice cos they never had periods anyway.  Thought there <br/>
must be some kind of mental block or some such.  Your body <br/>
knows it&#39;s pregnant after all!  But anyway, how are they doing?  <br/>
Now that&#39;s some kind of home-birth!!!  LOL  And the Pastor?  Is <br/>
he out of shock yet?  Ya know, that&#39;s really the way to do it, isn&#39;t <br/>
it?  no fuss, no worry, no stress.  Just go to the toilet and get a <br/>
baby instead!  now that&#39;s what I need, instead of what I&#39;ve got <br/>
atm :-(<br/>
<br/>
Stop rambling, woman!  I AM fertile, i WILL get pregnant!!!!<br/>
