Thanks so much for the reply but with a younger brother permanently in &quot;the<br/>
dogbox&quot; I think she would prefer a girl to write to! LOL But thanks again<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605250200">Brooke, I have two wonderful nieces that live in Va.  One is 15, one is 12.  <br/>
They are very kind, sweet girls.  The older niece plays vilolin with the <br/>
local symphony orchestra, and the younger niece is horse crazy-- she rides at <br/>
local stables each week, and has taken lessons for about 3 yrs.  I bet they <br/>
would LOVE to meet your daughter through email and also on the instant <br/>
message!  Please email me privately if your daughter would be interested in <br/>
meeting them, and we will take it from there! My address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HPaulson5@...">HPaulson5@...</a>   <br/>
