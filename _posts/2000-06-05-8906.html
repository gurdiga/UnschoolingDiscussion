<div id="ygrps-yiv-398157421">Hi Becky,<br/>
      You pretty much caught us doing what we do best, going down tangents.<br/>
;) The weather has been so pretty and folks are out gardening and planting<br/>
vegetables.  Also, unschooling pretty much encompasses our lives, so all<br/>
topics touch on learning lives in some way.<br/>
<br/>
      When my children were the ages of yours   our lives looked like this.<br/>
Fix food, fix juice, play, fix food, watch videos, sing, dance, fix food...<br/>
collapse in bed at night.  :) Now that mine are older it still looks like<br/>
that, but I don&#39;t fix all the food.  Thank goodness!!<br/>
<br/>
      Why don&#39;t you ask us some questions about unschooling, give us a hint.<br/>
Where are you by the way? Maybe someone here is close to you.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
LisaKK<br/>

&gt; Hello! This is my first day of being on this unschooling e-mail list. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not familiar with e-mail lists and I know I&#39;m behind on discussions, but I<br/>
&gt; have received 14 e-mails today and none of them were related to<br/>
&gt; unschooling. Is that a typical day? I can talk about other stuff with all<br/>
&gt; the people I see in person, but I can&#39;t talk about unschooling with them.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d love to hear what your children are doing and learning so I might not<br/>
&gt; feel all alone in this lifestyle and so that I might get some new ideas<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; perspectives--especially from those of you with young children. Mine are<br/>
5,<br/>
&gt; 4, and 3. Thank you! --Becky<br/>

Hello Becky!<br/>
<br/>
Had to chuckle at your note.  A typical day in the life of some unschoolers <br/>
is pretty hard to find!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have two kids -- 7 yo boy and 5 1/2 yo girl -- and we have been <br/>
officially hsing for about 1 1/2 years.  And we are unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
So, what are you up to and what would you like to discuss?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847749428">Hi Becky!<br/>
<br/>
My children are 5 and 3 and I too have recently joined the email list.  We <br/>
have just recently sent our letter of intent to the school district in NJ <br/>
and I know that we will need to submit a curriculum (not for their approval, <br/>
just to show what we are doing).  I think that is going to be the trickiest <br/>
part as who knows where our interests will take us in the next year...<br/>
<br/>
We decided on unschooling because when we really thought about it, we were <br/>
already pros!  My son (5) became interested in trains when he was about 18 <br/>
months old.  Since then, we have visited many railroads, train museums and <br/>
have read countless books (some coffee table books even, if it was about <br/>
trains, he&#39;d listen).  Now he has moved on to skyscrapers and bridges.  My <br/>
husband recently took him to the Empire State Building and he picked on the <br/>
Iron Works Building (one of the first skyscrapers) all by himself.  My dh <br/>
said he never would have known that...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I won&#39;t keep draggin on.  My daughter who is 3 really hasn&#39;t come <br/>
out with any one strong interest yet, so she mainly tags along with brother <br/>
and she also likes to play on the computer (we have tons of software).<br/>
<br/>
One of ds project&#39;s with Dad was to put together a website.  If you would <br/>
like to take a look, his address is www.geocities.com/Heartland/Valley/8284<br/>
<br/>
They are working on updating it now and are adding skyscrapers to it in it&#39;s <br/>
next incarnation.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list,<br/>
<br/>
Bonnie<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well my youngest are 8 1/2 and 10. My oldest has never homeschooled and<br/>
is in a self paced gifted high school program (rather like unschooling<br/>
or at least as close to it as a PS can get)<br/>
When we first started (pulled them from PS for grades 1 & 2 ), we used<br/>
unit studies since they were used to school work. We evolved over the<br/>
next year into unschooling.<br/>
A typical day recently is about 20 min of math (totaly voluntary but mom<br/>
is math phobic and whines sometimes to coax some math work), lots of<br/>
reading (books, magazines, kids&#39; magazines, comic, newspapers), a little<br/>
French for the youngest although the older one is now showing an<br/>
interest and pursuing it on his own. Responsibility for our puppy&#39;s<br/>
schedule is an on going family affair. Some times they watch interesting<br/>
programs from Discovery Channel, TLC or PBS etc that I&#39;ve taped for them<br/>
the night before.<br/>
<br/>
Some time durring the week there is guaranteed to be craft/artsy stuff<br/>
happening.Today just happened to include pictures from Spiderman comics<br/>
being trimmed up and used in a collage.<br/>
<br/>
*I* worked on brushing up my German while the math stuff and the collage<br/>
was happening (parents can unschool too you know &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
The garden beckons and I&#39;ll enlist volunteers to pull weeds and scoop<br/>
poop.<br/>
My guys do their own laundry weekly.<br/>
Library books of all kinds end up here too.<br/>
<br/>
My guys like to help with meals. Our youngest loves workbooks and will<br/>
do math and French on her own initiative. I do worry about our son<br/>
though because he needs to have things offered up to him as he, up until<br/>
recently had shown no ambition or much interest in anything except<br/>
pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
Now he is becomming more self motivated and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t push even<br/>
when I was agonizing over his lack of interest in the world. I just keep<br/>
offering things up and lately he has become more interested in languages<br/>
and more serious reading endeavors (Star Wars books and Harry Potter<br/>
started the *serious* reading frenzy he&#39;s enjoying).<br/>
<br/>
We have a medium size keyboard with full size keys that is used when the<br/>
fancy strikes them. The younger one says she is not ready to learn to<br/>
read music yet and insists on puzzling out tunes by herself and playing<br/>
them by ear. Our son has made an effort to teach himself to read music<br/>
and right now has put it aside but I know he intends return to it again.<br/>
<br/>
They love the computer of course and play math and language games<br/>
several times a week. <br/>
<br/>
They bowl every Saturday from September to May and Samantha is in<br/>
Brownies durring this time also. Nathan dropped out of Cub Scouts (lack<br/>
of interest and cliques within the group).<br/>
<br/>
They meet with other homeschoolers at least once a month at a drop in.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the basics of unschooling around here at present.<br/>
<br/>
Ask any questions you have and don&#39;t be afraid to jump into the<br/>
discussions!<br/>

Except you left out the part about dirt, brushing dirt off them, wiping dirt off them, shaking dirt out of their clothes, brushing dirt off me, washing dirt off everyone with the hose, pounding dirt out of shoes, etc.  Maybe that is just a circumstance of having boys though.

&gt; &gt; Hello! This is my first day of being on this unschooling e-mail list.<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; not familiar with e-mail lists and I know I&#39;m behind on discussions, but<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have received 14 e-mails today and none of them were related to<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling. Is that a typical day? I can talk about other stuff with<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the people I see in person, but I can&#39;t talk about unschooling with<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear what your children are doing and learning so I might<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel all alone in this lifestyle and so that I might get some new ideas<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; perspectives--especially from those of you with young children. Mine are<br/>
5,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4, and 3. Thank you! --Becky<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Well my youngest are 8 1/2 and 10. My oldest has never homeschooled and<br/>
&gt; is in a self paced gifted high school program (rather like unschooling<br/>
&gt; or at least as close to it as a PS can get)<br/>
&gt; When we first started (pulled them from PS for grades 1 & 2 ), we used<br/>
&gt; unit studies since they were used to school work. We evolved over the<br/>
&gt; next year into unschooling.<br/>
&gt; A typical day recently is about 20 min of math (totaly voluntary but mom<br/>
&gt; is math phobic and whines sometimes to coax some math work), lots of<br/>
&gt; reading (books, magazines, kids&#39; magazines, comic, newspapers), a little<br/>
&gt; French for the youngest although the older one is now showing an<br/>
&gt; interest and pursuing it on his own. Responsibility for our puppy&#39;s<br/>
&gt; schedule is an on going family affair. Some times they watch interesting<br/>
&gt; programs from Discovery Channel, TLC or PBS etc that I&#39;ve taped for them<br/>
&gt; the night before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some time durring the week there is guaranteed to be craft/artsy stuff<br/>
&gt; happening.Today just happened to include pictures from Spiderman comics<br/>
&gt; being trimmed up and used in a collage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *I* worked on brushing up my German while the math stuff and the collage<br/>
&gt; was happening (parents can unschool too you know &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The garden beckons and I&#39;ll enlist volunteers to pull weeds and scoop<br/>
&gt; poop.<br/>
&gt; My guys do their own laundry weekly.<br/>
&gt; Library books of all kinds end up here too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My guys like to help with meals. Our youngest loves workbooks and will<br/>
&gt; do math and French on her own initiative. I do worry about our son<br/>
&gt; though because he needs to have things offered up to him as he, up until<br/>
&gt; recently had shown no ambition or much interest in anything except<br/>
&gt; pokemon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now he is becomming more self motivated and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t push even<br/>
&gt; when I was agonizing over his lack of interest in the world. I just keep<br/>
&gt; offering things up and lately he has become more interested in languages<br/>
&gt; and more serious reading endeavors (Star Wars books and Harry Potter<br/>
&gt; started the *serious* reading frenzy he&#39;s enjoying).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have a medium size keyboard with full size keys that is used when the<br/>
&gt; fancy strikes them. The younger one says she is not ready to learn to<br/>
&gt; read music yet and insists on puzzling out tunes by herself and playing<br/>
&gt; them by ear. Our son has made an effort to teach himself to read music<br/>
&gt; and right now has put it aside but I know he intends return to it again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They love the computer of course and play math and language games<br/>
&gt; several times a week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They bowl every Saturday from September to May and Samantha is in<br/>
&gt; Brownies durring this time also. Nathan dropped out of Cub Scouts (lack<br/>
&gt; of interest and cliques within the group).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They meet with other homeschoolers at least once a month at a drop in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s the basics of unschooling around here at present.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ask any questions you have and don&#39;t be afraid to jump into the<br/>
&gt; discussions!<br/>

     You&#39;ll be doing some of these things forever, but it changes enough so<br/>
that you get to stay sane. &lt;G&gt; I no longer have to make juice for someone<br/>
every time I turn around, but now I have someone wanting me to take them<br/>
somewhere.  I told my 10 year old toady that mom was just staying home.. not<br/>

&gt; Hi Becky!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My children are 5 and 3 and I too have recently joined the email list.  We<br/>
&gt; have just recently sent our letter of intent to the school district in NJ<br/>
&gt; and I know that we will need to submit a curriculum (not for their<br/>
approval,<br/>
&gt; just to show what we are doing).  I think that is going to be the<br/>
trickiest<br/>
&gt; part as who knows where our interests will take us in the next year...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We decided on unschooling because when we really thought about it, we were<br/>
&gt; already pros!  My son (5) became interested in trains when he was about 18<br/>
&gt; months old.  Since then, we have visited many railroads, train museums and<br/>
&gt; have read countless books (some coffee table books even, if it was about<br/>
&gt; trains, he&#39;d listen).  Now he has moved on to skyscrapers and bridges.  My<br/>
&gt; husband recently took him to the Empire State Building and he picked on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Iron Works Building (one of the first skyscrapers) all by himself.  My dh<br/>
&gt; said he never would have known that...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I won&#39;t keep draggin on.  My daughter who is 3 really hasn&#39;t come<br/>
&gt; out with any one strong interest yet, so she mainly tags along with<br/>
brother<br/>
&gt; and she also likes to play on the computer (we have tons of software).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of ds project&#39;s with Dad was to put together a website.  If you would<br/>
&gt; like to take a look, his address is<br/>
www.geocities.com/Heartland/Valley/8284<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They are working on updating it now and are adding skyscrapers to it in<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; next incarnation.<br/>

&gt; &gt;come<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out with any one strong interest yet, so she mainly tags along with<br/>
&gt; &gt;brother<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and she also likes to play on the computer (we have tons of software).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; One of ds project&#39;s with Dad was to put together a website.  If you<br/>
&gt; &gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like to take a look, his address is<br/>
&gt; &gt;www.geocities.com/Heartland/Valley/8284<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; They are working on updating it now and are adding skyscrapers to it in<br/>
&gt; &gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; next incarnation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome to the list,<br/>

&gt; My ds was so excited to hear about all of your railroaders, and, no, he<br/>
didn&#39;t know what a hog-head was..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He would also like to know if any of them had the privilege of driving a<br/>
&quot;Big Boy&quot;.  If so, he&#39;d be really<br/>

5 pin bowling which is the kind Sam and Nathan bowl.<br/>
5 pin bowling was developed here in Canada so workers could have a<br/>
shorter game that they could play over their lunch hour.<br/>
<br/>
Sam just had her *moving up* ceremony in Brownies. She goes to Girl<br/>
Guides next fall.<br/>
Sam was one of those clinging vine children. After a year in Sparks ( 5<br/>
& 6 y olds) with me attending with her &lt;g&gt;, she told me the first night<br/>
of Brownies to *go!* that she&#39;d be ok.<br/>
So for anyone else with shy, cautious children see to their need for<br/>
your presence first, encourage their involvement ( I didn&#39;t participate<br/>
with the leaders I made a point of sitting off to the side with a book<br/>
only involving myself when other mother volunteers were active) and the<br/>
shyness eventually evolves into independence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925611025">Thank you so much Pris.  Mac actually got to stand in the cab on a &quot;Big <br/>
Boy&quot;.  There is one of the few remaining in Scranton, PA and we went there <br/>
during Labor Day weekend so that he could climb in the cab.  He was excited <br/>
when I told him that your dad had actually driven one!  Did you show your dh <br/>
mac&#39;s website?  Hopefully, they will have it updated by July.  My dh was <br/>
going to use the picture of the kids standing in front of the Big Boy as the <br/>
background.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My ds was so excited to hear about all of your railroaders, and, no, <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know what a hog-head was..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He would also like to know if any of them had the privilege of driving <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Big Boy&quot;.  If so, he&#39;d be really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; interested in asking them some questions...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029909670">Hi Lisa!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m catching up very belatedly with my email and just giggled<br/>
when I read how life is not a whole lot different with older children<br/>
than it is with babies...eat, drink, dance, sing, eat, videos, eat,<br/>
maybe wash dishes, take a walk, eat, SLEEP???<br/>
<br/>
That was so cute!<br/>

&gt; Hi Becky,<br/>
&gt;       You pretty much caught us doing what we do best, going down tangents.<br/>
&gt; ;) The weather has been so pretty and folks are out gardening and planting<br/>
&gt; vegetables.  Also, unschooling pretty much encompasses our lives, so all<br/>
&gt; topics touch on learning lives in some way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;       When my children were the ages of yours   our lives looked like this.<br/>
&gt; Fix food, fix juice, play, fix food, watch videos, sing, dance, fix food...<br/>
&gt; collapse in bed at night.  :) Now that mine are older it still looks like<br/>
&gt; that, but I don&#39;t fix all the food.  Thank goodness!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;       Why don&#39;t you ask us some questions about unschooling, give us a hint.<br/>
&gt; Where are you by the way? Maybe someone here is close to you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Welcome!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello! This is my first day of being on this unschooling e-mail list. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; not familiar with e-mail lists and I know I&#39;m behind on discussions, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have received 14 e-mails today and none of them were related to<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling. Is that a typical day? I can talk about other stuff with all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the people I see in person, but I can&#39;t talk about unschooling with them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear what your children are doing and learning so I might not<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel all alone in this lifestyle and so that I might get some new ideas<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; perspectives--especially from those of you with young children. Mine are<br/>
&gt; 5,<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4, and 3. Thank you! --Becky<br/>

&gt; &gt; I too have a Samantha that bowls and is in Brownies. She&#39;s 7 1/2. How old is<br/>
&gt; &gt; your Sam?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Amy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our Sam is 8 turning 9 in September. Up here in Canada we bowl a lot of<br/>
&gt; 5 pin bowling which is the kind Sam and Nathan bowl.<br/>
&gt; 5 pin bowling was developed here in Canada so workers could have a<br/>
&gt; shorter game that they could play over their lunch hour.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sam just had her *moving up* ceremony in Brownies. She goes to Girl<br/>
&gt; Guides next fall.<br/>
&gt; Sam was one of those clinging vine children. After a year in Sparks ( 5<br/>
&gt; & 6 y olds) with me attending with her &lt;g&gt;, she told me the first night<br/>
&gt; of Brownies to *go!* that she&#39;d be ok.<br/>
&gt; So for anyone else with shy, cautious children see to their need for<br/>
&gt; your presence first, encourage their involvement ( I didn&#39;t participate<br/>
&gt; with the leaders I made a point of sitting off to the side with a book<br/>
&gt; only involving myself when other mother volunteers were active) and the<br/>
&gt; shyness eventually evolves into independence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498701981">Hey!  I was born in Toronto and have been to Hamilton and Niagra Falls a<br/>
few times.  I&#39;m in Saskatoon now but may have to face a move again east<br/>
if getting a job so warrants...we hear things are really humming<br/>
economically-speaking in S. Ont. right now.  I fear we couldn&#39;t afford<br/>
the standard of living though; real estate is so very reasonable here on<br/>
