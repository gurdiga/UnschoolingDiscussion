<div id="ygrps-yiv-191591759">I need advice- my 4 year old is to begin unschooling (well I feel like she has been all along just to continue it now that she is &quot;school-age&quot;)<br/>
and friends of hers and the family&#39;s are bringing their criticism directly to her.<br/>
<br/>
how do I let my child know that &quot;school&quot; isn&#39;t the only place for children her age.  We&#39;ve had numerous talks about schooling and our family&#39;s best interests with her included.  Yet when parents and her friends make comments to her, &quot;well so-and-so is going to go to school, she(my daughter) HAS to stay home with mom instead&quot;- it disgusts me that that is what is said to and in front of my child.  <br/>
What&#39;s so wrong with staying home with mom- and her sister for that matter?  <br/>
<br/>
I am very strong in my front about scholing or unschooling my children and do not waiver in my beliefs no matter who I am speaking too.  But why do parents believe it is okay to talk about our situation in that tone only to have their children repeat it?  I never once say to my child so she can repeat it- you get to stay home instead of school- while they HAVE to go to school.  Because in my opinion nobody HAS to do anything.  We all have a choice whether it is recognized or not.  <br/>
<br/>
How do I face this social dilema.  I am able to handle my end of the critism and defensive views from others who choose public school- but how do I let my little one, who has such a tender heart, know that she&#39;s not missing out on anything?  She&#39;s very social but does take every bit of negativity to heart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569729465">I have had this very same issue with my mom - she is very unsupportive  <br/>
of unschooling, has told me I am damaging the kids, shakes her head  <br/>
when it gets brought up while saying the &quot;kids are missing out on  <br/>
something they&#39;ll never get back&quot;, and criticizes them when she thinks  <br/>
they don&#39;t know something she thinks they should.  It&#39;s pretty bad.   <br/>
Up until now, I have simply refused to talk to her about homeschooling  <br/>
(but she&#39;ll usually manage to get in a few comments anyways before I  <br/>
remind her that it&#39;s not up for discussion) and when she&#39;s been around  <br/>
the kids and I&#39;m there, I immediately shut down any conversation that  <br/>
she may start criticizing their knowledge.  However, she has babysat  <br/>
the kids recently (therefore alone with them) and she&#39;s pulled out all  <br/>
the stoppers - bribed them with money to do school worksheets that she  <br/>
has, and then criticizing them pretty badly because they can&#39;t do it  <br/>
(ie &quot;this is 3 grade levels below where you&#39;re at...you should know  <br/>
this&quot;).  When I heard that, I called her and angrily reminded her that  <br/>
homeschooling is not up for discussion, and bribing/criticizing/ <br/>
forcing worksheets is inappropriate and damaging, and if she wishes to  <br/>
see the kids then that needs to stop.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t, however.  She is so certain that they are damaged because of  <br/>
the homeschooling, she listens to no one.  (she is like this is every  <br/>
other area of her life as well - anyone heard of borderline  <br/>
personality disorder?  It was a nightmare to grow up with).  So, for  <br/>
the moment, I am suspending using her as a babysitter because it&#39;s not  <br/>
fair to the kids.  It&#39;s unfortunate, because there are fun things she  <br/>
can do with them, but it&#39;s not worth it to them or me to put up with  <br/>
the other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t necessarily give you any answers for what to do - but I  <br/>
do empathize with feeling like the children are collateral in the &quot;war  <br/>
of unschooling&quot; that some others like to wage.<br/>

<br/>
#1, because it *is* okay.   Other people can talk about your  <br/>
situation.  You can&#39;t control that.<br/>
#2, possibly because their kids are asking to stay home too, and the  <br/>
parents feel the need to glorify what they&#39;re doing and belittle what  <br/>
you&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Both those accounts are about an unschooling mom wanting to control  <br/>
other people.<br/>
<br/>
Consider telling your kids that some people are so convinced school is  <br/>
that only way that they get scared to even think about other things.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, if you can, go to an unschooling conference so you can see  <br/>
other families and your kids can meet other unschooled kids.  Or a  <br/>
park day.  Or visit another family you meet online or something.<br/>
<br/>
If someone were a sex offender you probably wouldn&#39;t let them  <br/>
babysit.  If someone is being emotionally abusive to your children,  <br/>
don&#39;t let them babysit.  If another child is beating your kid with a  <br/>
stick, take him home and don&#39;t invite him back.  If another child is  <br/>
beating your child up with words and shame, take him home and don&#39;t  <br/>
invite him back.  Or talk to that other kid, or be right there to help  <br/>
steer the conversation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118955827">thanks to the both of you for your support- I guess the thing that bothers me the most is this is exactly why I don&#39;t want them in public school- Children should be supported in their ventures especially their education.  I&#39;m disheartened because I have a feeling I&#39;m going to be drifting away from some friends that we have had for years just because I&#39;m choosing something other than the &quot;norm&quot;.  I do plan on becoming active with the unschooling/homeschooling community- I&#39;m in the process of preparing ourselves financially so I can quit my job, I can&#39;t wait to get out into that big world everyday with my girls.  <br/>
<br/>
thanks again<br/>

That happens.<br/>
If you look at it from the other side, though, if your friends will  <br/>
only like you if you&#39;re neglectful and abusive of your children, it&#39;s  <br/>
an easier choice.  :-/   I&#39;ve lost some friends and kept some, but  <br/>
they would&#39;ve been gone from my life eventually anyway.<br/>

My youngest turned 18 three days ago.   All three of my children  <br/>
really LIKE their parents, at 18, 20 and 23.  Not many parents have  <br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101585311">I&#39;ve gotten good, over the years, at ignoring what isn&#39;t said right to <br/>
me. When you&#39;re active in a community and you speak out and get <br/>
involved, etc., there will be people who won&#39;t like you and they&#39;ll <br/>
badmouth you behind your back, so I accepted that and I really just let <br/>
it slide when I hear about it. Same with criticism of my children. &quot;I&quot; <br/>
know my kids. &quot;I&quot; know what they&#39;re really like. My kids didn&#39;t always <br/>
behave perfectly - they had to grow and learn like anybody else. But I <br/>
knew they were on a good path - their trajectory was good. Same with <br/>
myself - I screwed some things up along the way, didn&#39;t always live <br/>
perfectly up to my own standards. But I&#39;ve been on a good path, too, and <br/>
part of that path is acceptance of not being perfect, of being a <br/>
learning human, not a finished product.<br/>
<br/>
So - when someone criticizes your kids - why not take a good look at the <br/>
criticism. Don&#39;t take offense, put aside the defensive feelings. Just <br/>
look with eyes wide open at how much of it is true. Look at what the <br/>
source of the criticism is. Is it petty jealousy? Is it defensiveness on <br/>
their part that you&#39;re not doing things their way? Do they feel <br/>
threatened? Or, is there a teensy bit of truth in it? Are YOU worried <br/>
about the path your children are on? It is all right for the children <br/>
not to be perfect - if someone has picked up on some imperfection in <br/>
your child, it is okay to respond (even if just to yourself), &quot;Yeah, <br/>
that&#39;s not the best thing about Johnny, but he&#39;s on the path to <br/>
improving in that area.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes other people think we&#39;re not really helping our kids do <br/>
better. They see us as lackadaisical rather than supportive. For <br/>
example, I had a daughter who would get very frustrated easily and have <br/>
little explosive meltdowns, when playing with friends. It wasn&#39;t cool - <br/>
not for her friends, but also not for her. It was something she was <br/>
working on and I was helping her, but that wasn&#39;t obvious to her friends <br/>
or their parents. I would never chastise her, which is what some parents <br/>
and their kids wanted to see. I&#39;d comfort her and sometimes they would <br/>
think that was encouraging and rewarding her behavior. I had a few <br/>
parents say, &quot;You need to make her stop that.&quot; Or they&#39;d say, &quot;You <br/>
should not let her get away with that.&quot; Sorry - but those were just <br/>
stupid comments by ignorant parents whose OWN kids didn&#39;t turn out all <br/>
that great, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a matter of confidence. I think the way to become <br/>
confident enough to handle criticism effectively (hearing it without <br/>
defensiveness, evaluating it, using what might be good information, <br/>
ignoring the rest) is to read and read and read about unschooling and <br/>
parenting and get such a deep understanding and sense of it that other <br/>
people&#39;s remarks just seem obviously off base.<br/>
<br/>
I felt sometimes like someone was saying, &quot;The sky is red today,&quot; and <br/>
I&#39;d look at the blue sky and it would be obvious to me that they were <br/>
wearing red-tinted glasses and didn&#39;t know it.<br/>

<br/>
My kids have always seen the blue sky, so the typical parents-of- <br/>
schoolkids comments baffle them, still.  They&#39;re stunned that a parent  <br/>
could actually believe this or that, or actually believe whatever.  I  <br/>
tell them there are billions of people that way.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s leaving tomorrow to live with a family in England for several  <br/>
weeks, and might go back there someday in the future.  She&#39;ll be  <br/>
working informally as an au pair.  She&#39;ll be a tourist they&#39;re giving  <br/>
spending money to.  But her &quot;expertise&quot; in the situation is that she  <br/>
was unschooled, and has been analytical about what makes unschooling  <br/>
work for many years.  She&#39;s been curious about how families operate  <br/>
and what helps kids be confident and well behaved since she was old  <br/>
enough to talk about it.   In unschooling and mindful parenting, she&#39;s  <br/>
a native speaker.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading about au pairs, and generally they&#39;re from another EU  <br/>
country with a different primary language.  Holly&#39;s &quot;different primary  <br/>
language&quot; is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In March or April she&#39;ll live with another family with two young  <br/>
girls, in Quebec for a while, and so she&#39;ll get to see other parts of  <br/>
the country, live with non-American families (the family in Quebec has  <br/>
a Belgian mom and east German dad, but the girls are speaking  <br/>
English.  The family in England is not at all American. &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s  <br/>
visited only Americans living in England the last two times she was  <br/>
there.     These are really good opportunities for Holly, and another  <br/>
completely unforeseen benefit of unschooling, and of the fact that she  <br/>
was interested in parenting at an age when school would have  <br/>
discouraged any interest in or discussion of parenting, pretty  much.<br/>
