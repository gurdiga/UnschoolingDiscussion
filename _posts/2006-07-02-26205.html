<div id="ygrps-yiv-164702088">What do Rice Krispies say?<br/>
<br/>
Well just now on a commercial I think they said &quot;Children can&#39;t learn  <br/>
to listen if you don&#39;t teach them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago I bought a few super-cheap DVDs, one of  <br/>
commercials from the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, and it had the original black &  <br/>
white cartoon of the full-length Rice Krispies jingle, which is an  <br/>
intricate and elaborate contrapuntal extravaganza.  It&#39;s a jazz  <br/>
madrigal.  Holly listened to it several times.  We talked about  <br/>
advertising jingles and music and changing culture.    Even the  <br/>
lyrics are cool, and they sang each part individually so you got to  <br/>
hear all the lyrics.<br/>
<br/>
The lyrics are here, but I didn&#39;t find an online sound file.<br/>
<br/>
Things that talk, we personify (or vice-versa—we &quot;give voices&quot; to  <br/>
things we personify or anthropomorphize).  Maybe that&#39;s part of the  <br/>
book worship phenomenon.  We &quot;give voice&quot; to paper, and stone, by  <br/>
putting words on them and then saying &quot;What does it say?&quot;   <br/>
Gravestones &quot;say&quot; something.  Mile markers and way crosses (medieval  <br/>
stone road markers) &quot;said&quot; things.  Runestones (not little new age  <br/>
toys, but big roadside rocks from 1000 years ago with runes carved on  <br/>
the edges) &quot;say&quot; things.  Books &quot;speak&quot; at length, in the voices of  <br/>
dead people.<br/>
<br/>
What do Rice Krispies say?<br/>

Just thought I&#39;d add that in Australia they&#39;re called Rice Bubbles and they <br/>
also go Snap, Crackle and Pop!!!<br/>
<br/>
Nice to know that some things sound the same all over the world!<br/>

Just thought I&#39;d add that in Australia they&#39;re called Rice Bubbles and <br/>

My grandfather&#39;s best friend was a fellow named Vernon Grant. He drew <br/>
the first Snap, Crackle, and Pop characters. My dad has an original <br/>
drawing of &quot;Snap&quot; that Mr Grant gave him when he was a young man. He <br/>
signed a copy of his Mother Goose book for Cameron shortly before he <br/>
died. He&#39;s also well-known for his Santas.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan enjoyed this:<br/>
In the anime Naruto there is a ninja team with a team similar to Snap, <br/>
Crackle, and Pop. Their names are Dosu, Kin, and Zaku; these are <br/>
japanese onomatopoeia for Slash, Clang, and Crunch.<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
