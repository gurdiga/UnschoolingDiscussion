       Thanks for your letter! I am 41 and though I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too <br/>
 old, I sure do like to hear of  healthy babies being born to women in their <br/>
 40&#39;s!  And I really love the stories about those  &quot;suprise babies&quot; born  <br/>
 after years of infertility!    jackie &gt;&gt;<br/>

She is not only healthy, she is the joy of our lives.  A definite youngest <br/>
child in personality.  The family clown, always trying to make everyone else <br/>
laugh.  And with two older, verbal, opinionated sisters, she has learned how <br/>
to stand up for herself!  <br/>
<br/>
My almost seven year old reads to her constantly, and she has memorized quite <br/>
a few of her favorite books.  She is now pointing to words and asking, &quot;What <br/>
does this say?&quot; or &quot;What is the title?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And I used to think kids were supposed to go to pre-school! <br/>

I had my first (and only) child when I was 40.  I never paid much attention<br/>
to all the huplah about age and pregnancy, just trusted myself and my body.<br/>
I am the natural as possible type so didn&#39;t get any of the tests, (amnio<br/>
etc.)  In fact did not see a medical doctor, just an at home mid-wife.  I<br/>
did have moments of fear when well meaning friends would tell stories of<br/>
worst case scenario&#39;s, but decided I wasn&#39;t going to create a dreaded<br/>
experience, and if I did have something happen it was for the highest and<br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I never felt better in my life during month&#39;s 4 to 9 of the<br/>
pregnancy,  I did have to go to the emergency room of the hospital for the<br/>
delivery after 4 days of labor, but left after 4 hours with a healthy baby.<br/>
The hospital story and process had some difficulty, but had much meaning and<br/>
learning for me.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is so individual, and I do not like to buy into statistics and<br/>
fear based decisions and was glad I didn&#39;t in this case.<br/>
