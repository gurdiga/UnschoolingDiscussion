<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795890546">Hello all!  I have visited unschooling.com numerous times <br/>
and I just signed on to the loop. Here&#39;s a brief backgound....<br/>
   Although I have been reading John Holt for years this is my first <br/>
step to unschool my children. We have three kids, Zach (9), Drew (6), <br/>
and Chloe (who has always been unschooled...4 yrs.) Well, the boys <br/>
were excited to be &quot;homeschooled&quot; this year and Thursday August 30th <br/>
was spent at a park day for all the homeschoolers/unschoolers in our <br/>
area. A few days have passed now and my oldest faces me today and <br/>
loudly announces that I have not taught him A THING and how is he <br/>
supposed to learn!!!?? So, I say quite calmly, well what would you <br/>
like to learn?? He gets quite angry at my reponse and replies, &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t know! You are just supposed to be teaching me something! I <br/>
can&#39;t just watch T.V. all day!&quot; LOL I laugh because my oldest is my <br/>
most television addicted child. I respond, &quot;anything you want to do <br/>
is fine with me...math, science, play a game, anything.&quot; He walked <br/>
away in a huff.  A short time later he did bring out a game and we <br/>
all played. I could tell he was still very bothered by my lack <br/>
of &quot;formal lessons&quot; and after the game was finished I brought out his <br/>
math book from the last school year. I showed him the book and <br/>
explained to him that the work inside was extremely easy (it is far <br/>
below his abilities) and he agreed. I then showed him that out of an <br/>
entire year the book had not even been halfway completed. I pointed <br/>
out that I felt if he wanted to do it he could sit and complete the <br/>
entire book in a day or two. He wouldn&#39;t have to wait for the teacher <br/>
or for kids who did not understand, etc..  He kind of laughed in <br/>
agreement with me. He did not, and I did not expect him to, work in <br/>
the book but helped put the game away and went back to the T.V. <br/>
    I can tell he does not grasp what I am explaining fully. He still <br/>
does not understand why I am not sitting down and &quot;teaching&quot; him. <br/>
Is &quot;unschooling&quot; a philosphy that I should sit and explain to him in <br/>
detail?  I have made numerous points to him but never totally and <br/>
completely explained. The funny thing is I expected him to be <br/>
thrilled by the fact that he was not going to be made to &quot;work&quot; and <br/>
instead his reaction caught me totally offguard!! I really should <br/>
have known better!!!!           <br/>
<br/>
   By the way....the television is somewhat of a problem. My husband <br/>
will not let me take it out of the house, which is what I want to do!<br/>
My son CAN sit in front of that thing for hours if I were to let him <br/>
and I almost feel he has been doing just that for the past couple <br/>
days as a silent protest against my method of &quot;instruction.&quot; He did <br/>
not watch much television over the summer and now he cannot seem to <br/>
be able to shut it off. Of course, it may be that all of his <br/>
neighborhood friends have gone off to school. For the time being <br/>
should I plan lots of activity in the home...experiments, read <br/>
outloud time, playing games, etc...my car is broken down and won&#39;t be <br/>
ready for a least a week. Some unschoolers believe that I should just <br/>
let boredom take it&#39;s toll and let the kids lead the activity when <br/>
they are ready.  Any thoughts on this??????    <br/>
            Thank you all...I would appreciate ANY input!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609956188">We have a rule that they only watch one hour of TV per day.  We don&#39;t have access to great public educational channels, and the schedule for the cable channels is hard to figure out here.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, in another location, we watched the WAM! channel lots.  It had great stuff on during the day.  We&#39;ve been gone for a year, and I don&#39;t know what it looks like now.<br/>
<br/>
It will take awhile for the kids to start finding things to do.  In the meantime, you can say &quot;read anything you want, but read&quot; or something like that.  My children go through spurts where they really love doing workbooks / worksheets...and then they&#39;ll not look at them again for weeks.  Sometimes they&#39;ll get all caught up in playing their instruments (ukulele, recorder, etc.) and decide to work on either learning new songs or getting better at old ones.<br/>
<br/>
We go to homeschool PE and field trips.  But mostly, I sincerely try to answer their questions, and I&#39;ve shown them how to look things up in the encyclopedias.  They are getting much better at finding out the answers they want to know.<br/>
<br/>
If it gets really bad, you can &quot;accidentally&quot; lose the remote (since no kid nowadays understands how to use a TV without one!) or unplug the TV until something else is done to your satisfaction.  Don&#39;t let your son be a couch potato.  It could make for trouble with CPS if ever somebody turned you in!<br/>

LMAO  mine do!!  Cos we lose the remote, (one of them, <br/>
the numbers have rubbed off) or the batteries fall out, <br/>
or the darn thing breaks...  dh is taking one of ours <br/>
into the shop to swap it today...  guess what, it&#39;s the <br/>
newest one...<br/>
<br/>
So they know how to change channels and sound from the <br/>
buttons on the boxes, and they know how to work the <br/>

&lt;&lt;  &quot;anything you want to do <br/>
is fine with me...math, science, play a game, anything.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I avoid &quot;math&quot; and &quot;science&quot; as terminology. You might want to consider that. <br/>
 It tends to categorize things that shouldn&#39;t and really can&#39;t be categorized <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I could tell he was still very bothered by my lack <br/>
of &quot;formal lessons&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe getting out a couple of times a week for specific &quot;explores&quot; would <br/>
help.  Let him know that you&#39;re doing an unschooling field trip (or <br/>
something) and take a picnic, the dog, some sketch pads, to an isolated park <br/>
or canyon and draw some leaves (and play) or go to the children&#39;s museum (and <br/>
play) or to the video store to find obscure movies, or to an ethnic food <br/>
store for foreign candy and exotic vegetables.  He will learn things he can <br/>
talk about and will feel more &quot;educated.&quot;  Try to get out quite a bit here at <br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He still <br/>
does not understand why I am not sitting down and &quot;teaching&quot; him. <br/>
Is &quot;unschooling&quot; a philosphy that I should sit and explain to him in <br/>
detail?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a little at a time.  Watch his face to gauge interest, understanding, <br/>
and frustration.  Drop it when it seems better to drop it.   Ask him how he <br/>
learned to play Lego, or how to ride a bike--not from school or lessons.  <br/>
Watch for other things--people doing things or discussing things they learned <br/>
on their own, out of fascination or need.  Mention it when it comes to light <br/>
naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-My son CAN sit in front of that thing for hours if I were to let him <br/>
and I almost feel he has been doing just that for the past couple <br/>
days as a silent protest against my method of &quot;instruction.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;s learning there too.  You yourself, too, need to begin to see <br/>
learning everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t sit there during the hours you&#39;ve taken all the kids out to explore.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For the time being <br/>
should I plan lots of activity in the home...experiments, read <br/>
outloud time, playing games, etc...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why not?  Games and cooking projects and art projects for those kids who are <br/>
interested would make the days warm and memorable.  Be willing to have kids <br/>
wander away, and back, or to say &quot;no thanks.&quot;  You might have to finish the <br/>
cookies all by yourself, but it&#39;s good practice for you too, to make things <br/>
available and not take it personally if kids&#39; attention spans are short.<br/>
<br/>
-=-my car is broken down and won&#39;t be <br/>
ready for a least a week.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s with the yard or the neighborhood?  Are there places to walk?  Things <br/>
to do outside?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Some unschoolers believe that I should just <br/>
let boredom take it&#39;s toll and let the kids lead the activity when <br/>
they are ready.  Any thoughts on this?????? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think if the homelife itself isn&#39;t full of stimulating opportunities, <br/>
unschooling won&#39;t work very well.  Dig through your old stuff and find things <br/>
they&#39;ve never seen.  Let them go through your souvenir box, or your jewelry <br/>
box, or pull all the plastic stuff out of the cabinets and let them use them <br/>
as blocks (and later you can wash and reorganize them).  <br/>
<br/>
Find magazines and scissors and let them cut out words and pictures for a <br/>
collage to be made later/someday.<br/>
<br/>
Rent movies.  Find videos around the house they haven&#39;t watched for a while, <br/>
or borrow some from your neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
Make play-dough and find things around the house to use as play-dough molds <br/>
and imprints that you yourself never thought before would be good play-dough <br/>
tools.<br/>
<br/>
If kids are bored, parents can find them something new and stimulating.  If <br/>
the parents can&#39;t, that will become a problem all by itself eventually, as <br/>
unschooling goes.  <br/>

If you try to play some of those games, you might find your brain isn&#39;t <br/>
withering up, but actually getting a heck of a workout and thinking some <br/>
thoughts you couldn&#39;t have had otherwise.<br/>

You are so right about the video games!  My anecdote was too brief,<br/>
merely meant to suggest that kids really do figure out what&#39;s best for<br/>
them when they need to.  My son still enjoys his games and TV but has<br/>
found for himself their proper context in HIS life.  <br/>
He has actually learned a great deal from video games, and it improved<br/>
his fine motor skills measurably.  This turned out to be a benefit to his<br/>
piano playing, hand writing and cartooning.  I didn&#39;t mean there is no<br/>
value in these games or TV, but to reassure the other mom these things<br/>
usually work themselves out.  The hand / eye coordination of video game<br/>
players is astounding!  I&#39;ve stayed up many a night playing Xena, Warrior<br/>
Princess.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678456167">Hi Tara,<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was in school for just over a year and she had great difficulty<br/>
adjusting to unschooling.  She was so....expectant.  I decided to help her<br/>
along by asking if she wanted to do things like read, watch a movie, go to<br/>
the park, go to a museum, cook, etc..  After a couple of months, she was<br/>
more comfortable but still not yet initiating much herself.  So I started<br/>
doing things that interested me and she would ask to join in.  Again, this<br/>
went on for several months.  She is now a very self motivating kid (except<br/>
when she is a couch potato LOL).<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think the TV is a very good segue into unschooling.  Watch it<br/>
with your kids. Ask questions, point out plot similarities (Hey, that is<br/>
basically Romeo and Juliet)....not in a &quot;let me teach you stuff&quot; kind of<br/>
way, but how you would watch TV with a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

No-one else seems to have commented on this, perhaps <br/>
it&#39;s so basic to everyone else that no-one&#39;s thought <br/>
about it :-))  I just wanted to mention that one of the <br/>
things about unschooling (I think, anyway) is that <br/>
there&#39;s no distinction between what&#39;s &#39;educational&#39; and <br/>
what isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s not that long ago (in the big scheme <br/>
of things, as it were) that someone spending lots of <br/>
time reading would be considered by some (and perhaps <br/>
still would today) to be wasting time and not being <br/>
&#39;useful.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling takes a lot of time, longer for those <br/>
who&#39;ve been in it longer.  Separating life into what&#39;s <br/>
educational and what isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t help that process <br/>
any, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
JMO, and ymmv, of course ;-)<br/>

<br/>
True.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has nothing better to do than watch TV all day, it is vastly <br/>
better for an unschooling parent to get that child out and away from the TV <br/>
DOING something cool, than to just say &quot;turn off the TV every day for the <br/>
rest of your life in case family services comes here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Deprivation doesn&#39;t lead to better unschooling, and if the child is living <br/>
for the convenience of the mom, something&#39;s wrong with the whole balance <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s what I think some of the other posters were trying to say.)<br/>

I watch the (whatever) movie?&quot; This was a huge issue for me for a long time. <br/>
And several times we&#39;d fight because I demanded that breakfast came first. <br/>
Then for a run of days I let him do it his way. Breakfast was on the table <br/>
and he ate when he was done watching. ( We drink a bright green shake for <br/>
breakfast, too messy for the living room) Now, he generally waits on his own, <br/>
or if I ask if we can wait he&#39;ll say sure. I think giving him control of his <br/>
time helped immensely. No longer that power struggle. Just my experience.<br/>

clincher is allowing them to decide if they want to or not. If they have no <br/>
choice, why bother asking? I was really into the whole, deprive tv to get <br/>
other stuff done thing but I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s the way to go. I had a <br/>
long struggle with my 3yo and in just the last week or so of letting him have <br/>
it all he wants, his wants have diminished. (btw thanks to all those on the <br/>
message board!:-))  When the vcr was miraculously fixed, i.e., I plugged it <br/>
in, he sat in front of it for hours for several days. Today, he never even <br/>
suggested turning it on.  I think he&#39;s got the idea that it&#39;s his when he <br/>
wants it.<br/>
And I feel really awful having lied to my own son to control and manipulate <br/>
his activities. I&#39;ve always thought the best route was to be up front and <br/>
stand behind my decisions, even if they made him unhappy. So how do I tell my <br/>
3yo that I lied to him?<br/>
Overall, just not a good parenting move in my book.<br/>

If your children wanted you to stay home with them more so they loosened the <br/>
distributor wires or the battery cable, and then tightened it again after you <br/>
had spent some time with them, would that be okay?  <br/>
<br/>
Or if they wanted you off the computer so they loosened the phone jack so <br/>
your modem connection would be garbage and then restored it after you had <br/>
played some games with them, wouldn&#39;t you consider that to be sneaky and <br/>
underhanded, disrespectful and rude?<br/>

Being dishonest is teaching dishonesty.<br/>

away and do other things but my third will sit in front of the TV or<br/>
computer ALL day if not told to do other things.  I&#39;m not exaggerating<br/>
either when I say ALL day.  He will watch one movie after another, the<br/>
same movie over and over or cooking show, cartoons and construction<br/>
shows.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266311047">It isn&#39;t that they don&#39;t know what I did to the TV .  It is that they<br/>
can&#39;t fix it themselves (at least my youngest can&#39;t).  And I only use it<br/>
as a last resort when the TV starts staying on continuously for days at a<br/>
time.  My son occassionally &#39;forgets&#39; that there is life away from the<br/>
TV.  That&#39;s why I do it and he knows why.  Mine are older than most of<br/>
yours too I think (based on what I&#39;ve read so far).  Mine are 16, 14 and<br/>
9.  I only have TV problems witht he 9 year old.  The 14 year old needs a<br/>
12 step program for her reading addiction - I mean really - who need to<br/>
take a book in the car TO THE LIBRARY -- to read on the way, not to<br/>
return!  And the library is only two miles up the road!  (I am just<br/>
joking for those who don&#39;t know me well enough yet - I love that she<br/>
reads so much.)<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a world of different between letting them learn to make<br/>
their own choices and letting them make YOUR choices too.  My kids have a<br/>
list of chores and a list of basic amounts of schoolwork to be done each<br/>
week.  The less they do, the more controlled the following week is.  So<br/>
it really is up to them but their choices have consequences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289729879">&lt;&lt; My kids have a list of chores and a list of basic amounts of schoolwork to <br/>
be done each week.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then it&#39;s not really unschooling and our answers aren&#39;t what you need.<br/>
<br/>
Because there is an ocean of advice for structured homeschoolers and so much <br/>
less for unschoolers, I like to keep trying to keep unschooling.com (and its <br/>
subsidiary mailing list) a clean lake of unschooling advice.<br/>
<br/>
If a nine-year-old UNschooled child has nothing better to do than watch TV, <br/>
that&#39;s a problem with the available activities the unschooling mom is <br/>
providing.  If a nine-year-old kid who has required schoolish activities is <br/>
watching TV instead of doing homework, that&#39;s not an unschooling question or <br/>
problem.  It could be avoided by unschooling instead of doing school at home <br/>
(however loosely).<br/>
<br/>
-=-The less they do, the more controlled the following week is.  So<br/>

<br/>
The consequences of the family&#39;s choice not to unschool has the consequence <br/>
that the parents must be increasingly controlling.  <br/>
