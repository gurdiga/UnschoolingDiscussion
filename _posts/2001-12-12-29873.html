&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1684<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, Dec 12, 2001, 3:39 AM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The point of the story is that I want to know ahead of time what the<br/>
&gt; plan is for training this puppy.  I want a puppy who can stay inside,<br/>
&gt; who won&#39;t jump on the table or counters and steal food, won&#39;t knock<br/>
&gt; over the garbage cans, and won&#39;t go to the bathroom in the house.  I<br/>
&gt; want a puppy who the kids can take out in the yard to play with and<br/>
&gt; he&#39;ll stay there.  What do I need to do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Buy them a nice stuffed animal.<br/>
<br/>
Or, do your research, talk to breeders and trainers and vets and shelters,<br/>
read some good books and sign up for training classes early and often.<br/>
<br/>
Read Good Owners, Great Dogs by Brian Kilcommons. Read breed selection<br/>
books. Read How to Be Your Dog&#39;s Best Friend and The Art of Raising a Puppy<br/>
by the Monks of New Skete. Go to a dog show and talk to the breeders. Go to<br/>
an obedience trial and talk to trainers. Go online and look for websites<br/>
pertaining to the breeds you&#39;re thinking about.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, there&#39;s no such thing as a Golden Lab. You&#39;re either looking for<br/>
a Golden Retriever or a yellow Labrador Retriever (they also come in black<br/>
and chocolate).<br/>
<br/>
Any (sane) dog can meet the criteria you&#39;ve listed -- with training. How<br/>
much training varies breed to breed and individual to individual. Once in a<br/>
blue moon you will run across a dog who seems to have been born trained. You<br/>
will run though a lot of dogs looking for that dog, so I&#39;d advise being well<br/>
prepared and well educated to train one yourself, instead.<br/>
<br/>
Adding a dog to the family is somewhat like adding another child. And as all<br/>
us Moms should know, when another child enters the household (even a<br/>
four-legged one) we&#39;re going to be doing the bulk of the work.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Karen. . . I will tell her. That&#39;s how she is about books on dogs and <br/>
cats as well. She did call around (when she was looking for volunteer <br/>
opportunities) vets but kept getting turned down. She then realized her <br/>
interest were in training and the care of dogs, but not necessarily vet <br/>
related. The first place she called for training, said, sure, come on in <br/>
whenever you want. So it was a sign it was the right thing for her. She could <br/>
change her mind at some point and decide she wants to do something entirely <br/>
different, and that would be fine. I would not consider what she is doing <br/>
wasted time at all. I have had several different career paths and am going to <br/>
embark on a new one next year, so to me change is just a great learning <br/>
adventure.<br/>

PS. She thinks its really cool there is a vet and a dog trainer on the <br/>
unschooling list!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817700771">Please remember the mixed breed dogs!  They are wonderful.  No, they may <br/>
not be as showy as many of the pure bred ones but trust me, most of them <br/>
have the biggest hearts and are just as loyal.  Plus you avoid many of the <br/>
genetic problems the pure bred dogs can have.<br/>
<br/>
Best thing you could  do is adopt a dog off &quot;death row&quot; or from a no kill <br/>
shelter and give it a chance to have love!  Working for a shelter, I see so <br/>
many wonderful dogs come through here.  So many of them get passed over due <br/>
to not being a pure bred dog or that is all the people want...but at least <br/>
they have food, shelter and someone who cares here...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035162789">Ok, let me see if I can explain some of this while fixing dinner LOL...<br/>
<br/>
You have to sign a form from any organization stating that you are adopting <br/>
a pet...this is for their records and for the state which does check these <br/>
out if there is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Spay and neutering is also required by 6 months as that is when the animal <br/>
becomes &quot;adult&quot; and can reproduce.  We are all trying to keep the number of <br/>
unwanted animals down so this has to be enforced or well, one cat has 3-8 <br/>
kittens and 6 months later there are say 3 more cats pregnant from that <br/>
litter and so on...also, this is state mandated as well.<br/>
<br/>
Shots are also a requirement for the health of an animal but truthfully, <br/>
the shelters are too busy to check into it and see.  They would spend 99.9% <br/>
of their time on the phone to different vets trying to do this and some <br/>
people do them on their own...<br/>
<br/>
The implant is for YOUR protection, not to track the animal in the manner <br/>
in which I think you mean.  If the dog/cat ever got away from you, there <br/>
would be a way to get it back to you.  We honestly wish more people had <br/>
them when we find their animals...I have seen many kids in tears when the <br/>
family pet disappeared or took a dog on vacation and it happened to break <br/>
off its leash or slipped its collar and was gone in a flash.<br/>
<br/>
Most of what they do on applications/contracts is to make people realize <br/>
the importance that their pet carries.  They are trying to make people <br/>
responsible for their pets so that our jobs are easier in rescue.  If <br/>
people got their animals spayed and neutered, there would be no real need <br/>
for rescue groups anymore.  Some countries do not have them as they <br/>
regulate animal husbandry so much.<br/>
<br/>
Our contracts have the same thing on it about taking the dogs back if not <br/>
spay/neutered on time and if that and the shots are not done, you could be <br/>
fined $150 dollars...it is a protection to the animals who have already <br/>
been through a lot in their life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69379919">Oh boy, fur is gonna fly but here goes anyway.  The whole reason places like<br/>
the local pound/SPCA, etc. are in business and why they require<br/>
spaying/neutering is because people do what you are planning to do.  The<br/>
result is usually a bunch of unwanted kittens and puppies.<br/>
<br/>
If your child wants that experience, instead of adding to a major problem,<br/>
have you considered either renting a video or contacting a local breeder to<br/>
see if they will let her watch a whelping of one of their dogs?<br/>
<br/>
Also, how old is your child?  Are you and your child prepared for what takes<br/>
place when cats breed?  Is your child really prepared for the whining,<br/>
crying, yowling and screaming the queen and tom are going to do?  Is your<br/>
child really aware of what the birth process is like when a queen kindles<br/>
for the first time, particularly if you breed her too young? Is your child<br/>
prepared for the blood?  Is your child prepared for the queen to eat the<br/>
after birth?  Are you prepared for the tom to become territorial and the<br/>
resulting marking of his territory by spraying all your furniture?<br/>
<br/>
Also the implants are more for the animals protections so that they don&#39;t<br/>
become one more statistic and end up in cheap end dog and cat food as<br/>
&quot;animal digest.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Dd has a female kitty and is<br/>
&gt; planning on getting a male kitty.  She wants to experience watching<br/>
&gt; cats have kittens.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A male cat who is used for breeding will almost certainly spray urine all<br/>
over your house to mark territory. A female cat, especially a first-time<br/>
mother, will try to hide to have her kittens. If you find her and disturb<br/>
her, she is likely to eat them.<br/>
<br/>
Cats can and do die having kittens. Kittens die from birth defects or<br/>
inexperienced mothering. Finding homes for kittens can be difficult. Finding<br/>
a home for a male cat who is spraying urine can be impossible.<br/>
<br/>
If your cat runs in to trouble giving birth, are you ready for the vet<br/>
bills? It can go into the hundreds if not thousands of dollars if she needs<br/>
a c-section and prolonged hospitalization, and after the surgery some cats<br/>
won&#39;t recognize the kittens as theirs and will let them die, or kill them.<br/>
Some cats don&#39;t thrive after surgery and can&#39;t nurse, so you will have to<br/>
tube feed kittens (insert a tube through their mouths to their stomachs,<br/>
trying not to miss and hit the lungs, which will drown them) who will<br/>
probably die anyway from lack of maternal care and antibodies.<br/>
<br/>
And if you don&#39;t go to the vet for the c-section, the cat dies of death by<br/>
torture, and her kittens with her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seems as though there are some passionate opinions on this one. We used to <br/>
let our female cat breed and never had a problem finding homes for the <br/>
kittens or we would keep them ourselves.  Now, we have two male cats who are <br/>
both neutered, although we did have one who was not and he was less of a <br/>
nuisance than one of the ones we have now who is. We never did actually see a <br/>
live birth with the kittens, but they would always let us hold them, etc. <br/>
afterwards, when we found out where they were. Sometimes they would move <br/>
them, but usually not. We did actually see live births with our boxers who we <br/>
were breeding.  I think some of Lelia&#39;s fascination with animals comes from <br/>
those earlier days, and she may end up with a career in something to do with <br/>
animals.<br/>
<br/>
I can also understand the other viewpoint of keeping them spayed or neutered <br/>
as well, when one won&#39;t have the time or inclination to take care of the <br/>
animals. (and also the very real facts of unwanted kittens and puppies) Where <br/>
we live now out in the country, we could use about 2 dozen cats to keep up <br/>
with the mouse population. Our two do the best they can, but cannot keep up <br/>
with the mice. I have almost resigned myself to living with mice as it has <br/>
been so hard to get rid of them. A few weeks ago, we had a wonderful <br/>
entertainment special every night, when the cats would catch a mouse in the <br/>
house, lose it and have us running all around trying to help them find it <br/>
again. One night my husband actually had a mouse that had gotten into his <br/>
pants leg somehow and he ended up sitting on it and killing it. He said he <br/>
pulled that mouse out of his ass. :)<br/>
<br/>
I know I really got off onto another story, but just wanted to add another <br/>
side.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Rule over them&quot; doesn&#39;t explictly discuss animal experiments. The reason <br/>
they use rabbits is because they don&#39;t make that much noise when being <br/>
tortured in experiments. Yes, the same experiments that the Nazi&#39;s used <br/>
on people is sanctioned by thoughts like this on animals.<br/>
<br/>
This has nothing to do with eating them for survival in a natural order <br/>
of the food chain. (This goes back to the age-old discussion of whether <br/>
humans are supposed to be carnivorous or herbivorous, but lets not get <br/>
into that)<br/>
<br/>
Survival of the fittest hasn&#39;t been naturally in action since man has <br/>
severly screwed up the ecosystem and the natural order of the food chain <br/>
(such as bringing one animal to another country that then has no <br/>
predator, but kills another species that then the whole chain is messed <br/>
up) see Austraila in the 30s if you really want to see how mankind has <br/>
put the royal screws to natural order.<br/>
<br/>
I find it utterly repulsive that people are clammering over human cloning <br/>
WHICH is nothing but a few division of cells ONLY to extract the stem <br/>
cells to create cures and NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE, yet <br/>
they have no problems with torturing the inhabitants of the earth for <br/>
research that has been proven more than once not to work in cross-species.<br/>
<br/>
Stem cell research, live tissue cells are going to find cures and <br/>
strengthen a failing medical system.<br/>
<br/>
The continuation of torture will only keep yielding the same assinine <br/>
results of mass drugs that don&#39;t work beyond suppression of symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think something good can come out of something so volatile?<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think that someone who has no regard for life has empathy <br/>
for the future of this world at all?<br/>
<br/>
And let not even go into religious aspects of it. Because history will <br/>
prove the never-ending mass destruction and genocide carried out in the <br/>

pets that are euthanized by shelters each year is 6 to 8 million?  That&#39;s<br/>
16,000 to 22,000 pets who are killed EVERY DAY. That&#39;s like 4-5 World Trade<br/>
center tragedies EVERY DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you find homes for all of them, those are homes taken away from pets<br/>
who could have been adopted from shelters. There are *way* more pets<br/>
available than there are homes for them.<br/>
<br/>
As others have pointed out, you probably won&#39;t be able to watch a cat giving<br/>
birth. If your daughter wants to experience young kittens, the shelters are<br/>
eager for foster families to care for a mom and kittens until they&#39;re old<br/>
enough to be adopted (3 months). We just went through this with kittens we<br/>
fostered at a week old. That way she could experience what&#39;s involved before<br/>
deciding it&#39;s worth it to bring more cats into the world. (And I would give<br/>
her the information on the number of pets euthanized so she can make an<br/>
informed choice.)<br/>
<br/>
The mom we got had an especially large litter: 10. 3 died before we fostered<br/>
her. 2 more died after we got her, one because it was too weak to compete<br/>
and refused supplementation. Another probably from complications of Feline<br/>
upper respiratory infection, which is very common among kittens. That<br/>
involved trips to the vet and medicine that they didn&#39;t want 3 times a day<br/>
(18 doses a day) plus 3 feedings and litter boxes. (Cat poops have nothing<br/>
on kitten poops in terms of aroma, especially since it takes a few months<br/>
for kittens to learn to cover effectively.)<br/>

<br/>
1.  Do you have plans for the resulting kittens?  They will be your <br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Every vet I ever talked to says that spaying after the first <br/>
litter is more difficult for the cat.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Neutering a male after he learns to scent won&#39;t stop him from <br/>
scenting with urine.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Bad things can happen.  I nearly lost a mom cat and did lose a <br/>
kitten because of a labor proplem.  We ended up at the emergency vet <br/>
clinic because the kitten&#39;s shoulder got caught on the mother&#39;s <br/>
pelvis.  That kind of thing is not an experience I&#39;d wish on anyone <br/>
or anything.  It was HORRIBLE to watch that cat in terror and pain <br/>
trying to get the kitten the rest of the way out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564406712">Many thoughts are flying through my head as I read the responses to my <br/>
daughter&#39;s desire to let her cat have kittens.  <br/>
<br/>
First, I&#39;ll talk about the one that relates directly to unschooling.  <br/>
It seems to me that when it comes to issues that I would consider <br/>
moral issues--letting my daughter listen to secular music or watch <br/>
questionable tv, whether or not she had to study her Bible, etc., <br/>
people on this list would usually tell me to stay neutral and let her <br/>
make her own decisions!  But when it comes to letting a cat have a <br/>
litter of kittens, I&#39;m being told, &quot;Don&#39;t let her do it!  Buy her a <br/>
video or let her watch someone else&#39;s animals mate!&quot;  It seems that <br/>
some are willing to look down on a &quot;fundamentalist Christian&quot; for not <br/>
letting kids listen to secular music at the same time they encourage a <br/>
&quot;politically correct&quot; forbidding of cat breeding. Do we let our kids <br/>
do what their interests lead them to or not?  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the actual issue of a cat having kittens, I grew up with <br/>
female cats who gave birth.  In my entire childhood we had only one <br/>
cat who was not a good mother.  She eventually &quot;caught on&quot; and did <br/>
nurse the kittens, but in the beginning we had to &quot;force&quot; her to go <br/>
near her kittens. <br/>
<br/>
We NEVER had a hard time giving kittens away.  If we didn&#39;t get rid of <br/>
all of them in the free ads, we found a farmer who was willing to take <br/>
them.  Farmers often have lots of cats running around to scare off the <br/>
mice.  They usually just throw a little bit of food and water out and <br/>
let the cats fend for themselves. I have fond memories of visiting a <br/>
friend&#39;s farm as a child and playing with his cats. <br/>
<br/>
What I learned on this list was about the males spraying furniture.  <br/>
Our male cats at home were always neutered so that they wouldn&#39;t roam, <br/>
so I really have no personal experience with un-neutered male cats. <br/>
Perhaps we&#39;ll try to find a friend with a male cat to &quot;borrow&quot;. ;)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never actually seen a cat give birth because they usually hid to <br/>
have their kittens.  The picture of my dad climbing the neighbor&#39;s <br/>
apple tree to bring the kittens and proud mama home is forever <br/>
engraved in my mind!  lol <br/>
<br/>
I did, however, stay home from school the day it seemed my dog was <br/>
going to have her puppies.  It turns out she did need &quot;help&quot;.  She <br/>
acted like she didn&#39;t know what to do with the first puppy.  I had to <br/>
&quot;make&quot; her lick it off.  She was still having the last of them when my <br/>
dad got home from work.  I&#39;ll never forget him talking on the phone <br/>
and looking up to see the dog running around the house with an <br/>
umbilical cord still attached and a puppy&#39;s head hitting off the <br/>
carpet!  He just calmly said to the person on the other end of the <br/>
phone, &quot;Excuse me&quot;, and went over, pulled the dog out the rest of the <br/>
way, and resumed his conversations!  She did end up being a good mama <br/>
though, not only to her puppies but to a little kitten we had who <br/>
decided to nurse from the dog too!  lol It was hilarious to see a dog <br/>
nursing a litter full of puppies and--a kitten!  <br/>
<br/>
 I know there are horror stories out there of animals having a hard <br/>
time giving birth.  But you know what?  These are ANIMALS, not people. <br/>
 There is a little rule that applies here called survival of the <br/>
fittest.  The strong survive, the weak don&#39;t.  It&#39;s sad, but until the <br/>
Lord creates a new heaven and earth and wipes out sin and death, it&#39;s <br/>
a fact of life.  A lot of these arguments I&#39;m hearing (the animal <br/>
COULD die in birth, the cats MAYBE wouldn&#39;t find a new home) sound so <br/>
strikingly similar to liberals who want all human women to &quot;get fixed&quot; <br/>
or use birth control after their first child.  They will go on about <br/>
how &quot;over populated&quot; the earth is, how women COULD die in child birth, <br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as why I don&#39;t want the chip implanted in a pet, it&#39;s because <br/>
even though I realize that &quot;big brother&quot; watches us more than I care <br/>
to admit, I don&#39;t want to do anything willingly that could give him <br/>
opportunity to put his foot in the door. <br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Speaking of dogs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Many thoughts are flying through my head as I read the responses to my<br/>
&gt; daughter&#39;s desire to let her cat have kittens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First, I&#39;ll talk about the one that relates directly to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; It seems to me that when it comes to issues that I would consider<br/>
&gt; moral issues--letting my daughter listen to secular music or watch<br/>
&gt; questionable tv, whether or not she had to study her Bible, etc.,<br/>
&gt; people on this list would usually tell me to stay neutral and let her<br/>
&gt; make her own decisions!  But when it comes to letting a cat have a<br/>
&gt; litter of kittens, I&#39;m being told, &quot;Don&#39;t let her do it!  Buy her a<br/>
&gt; video or let her watch someone else&#39;s animals mate!&quot;  It seems that<br/>
&gt; some are willing to look down on a &quot;fundamentalist Christian&quot; for not<br/>
&gt; letting kids listen to secular music at the same time they encourage a<br/>
&gt; &quot;politically correct&quot; forbidding of cat breeding. Do we let our kids<br/>
&gt; do what their interests lead them to or not?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as the actual issue of a cat having kittens, I grew up with<br/>
&gt; female cats who gave birth.  In my entire childhood we had only one<br/>
&gt; cat who was not a good mother.  She eventually &quot;caught on&quot; and did<br/>
&gt; nurse the kittens, but in the beginning we had to &quot;force&quot; her to go<br/>
&gt; near her kittens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We NEVER had a hard time giving kittens away.  If we didn&#39;t get rid of<br/>
&gt; all of them in the free ads, we found a farmer who was willing to take<br/>
&gt; them.  Farmers often have lots of cats running around to scare off the<br/>
&gt; mice.  They usually just throw a little bit of food and water out and<br/>
&gt; let the cats fend for themselves. I have fond memories of visiting a<br/>
&gt; friend&#39;s farm as a child and playing with his cats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I learned on this list was about the males spraying furniture.<br/>
&gt; Our male cats at home were always neutered so that they wouldn&#39;t roam,<br/>
&gt; so I really have no personal experience with un-neutered male cats.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps we&#39;ll try to find a friend with a male cat to &quot;borrow&quot;. ;)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve never actually seen a cat give birth because they usually hid to<br/>

to an opposite conclusion about what to do about it.  It would be <br/>
entirely possible to come to the conclusion that the right thing to do <br/>
would be to stop euthenizing.  Let the &quot;unwanted&quot; cats go free and <br/>
live in the wild.  Some will die, some will not.  Either way, they are <br/>
a natural part of the food chain and survival of the fittest will come <br/>
back into play. <br/>

I wouldn&#39;t allow my children to shoot animals just for the fun of <br/>
shooting them.  However, if they were shooting squirrels and wanted me <br/>
to fix them for supper, that would be great!  I&#39;ve eaten squirrel meat <br/>
and it&#39;s quite good. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe that we are caretakers of the earth.  I have really become <br/>
convicted lately of all the garbage we throw out that will never <br/>
decompose, or will possibly decompose thousands of years from now.  I <br/>
am hugely in favor of recycling.  I also believe that we are to care <br/>
for animals.  We are also to use them for our benefit. &quot;Rule over <br/>
them&quot; is the exact wording.  We may eat them, make clothes out of <br/>
them, conduct experiments on them.  Dd also wants to breed rabbits for <br/>
medical labs and I have no problems with that.  That doesn&#39;t mean we <br/>
go shooting everything that moves just for the fun of killing.  That <br/>
isn&#39;t being a good caretaker.  It does mean that when there is a <br/>
legitimate use for an animal, you use the animal for whatever it is <br/>
you need.</div>

a true unschooler allow that, even if her decision goes strongly <br/>
against your own deeply held convictions? <br/>

the life of an animal, unless it was for food, clothing, shelter, or <br/>
some other good use, I would disallow it.  However, allowing a cat to <br/>
have kittens is not taking the life of a living being.  As a matter of <br/>
fact, it is giving life to living beings.  <br/>

care of them (not killing just for the fun of it or to get a trophy). <br/>
 It also includes using animals for our benefit and pleasure.  If <br/>
breeding a cat gives a child an educational experience and provides a <br/>
few families and a farmer with some good cats, I see nothing <br/>
irresponsible about that.  (And yes, I am confident that we could find <br/>
a farmer to take the kittens if they weren&#39;t given away in the free <br/>
ads first.)<br/>
 <br/>

But cats are wild animals.  True, they are easily domesticated, but <br/>
thrown back out into the wild, they will do just fine.  We keep our <br/>
cat inside strictly as a housecat for the sake of the kids, but my <br/>
parents let their cat come and go.  Quite often, he leaves &quot;presents&quot; <br/>
of half-eaten mice on their doormat.  If he were to be abandoned, he <br/>
would survive just fine.  <br/>
