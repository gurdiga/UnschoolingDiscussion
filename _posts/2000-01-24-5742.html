<br/>
Welcome to the list.  I am a relative newcomer too, but it is an awesome list and these people are wonderful.  I too am trying to relearn French and Spanish.  I grew up 10 miles from Quebec, but have gotten quite rusty.  I am unschooling 3 kids:  James (13), Zach (8 almost 9), and Alannah (5).  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to have you!<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Zach is going to write to your son Nathan - he really wants a pen pal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965302980">Hi!<br/>
My name is Debbie.I&#39;m married to Darryl and have three kids, two that I<br/>
unschool, one in highschool (totally her choice).<br/>
We are in the soutern part of Ontario, Canada.<br/>
We are lucky enough to have a *struggling to get going* support group<br/>
that embraces Unschoolers. Most Homeschoolers around here are a little<br/>
paranoid and aren&#39;t our *cup &#39;o tea* se we feel lucky to have found our<br/>
fledgling group!<br/>
I have Multiple Sclerosis which was one of the initial reasons we chose<br/>
unschooling....the other reason being it justs suits our kids.<br/>
The MS can cause a lot of physical problems and physical fatigue as well<br/>
as mental fatigue (also known as a numb brain day &lt;g&gt;) but that all<br/>
comes and goes and I have lots of good days, week, or months before a<br/>
problem sets in.<br/>
Sometimes my messages/replies to posts will make sense to me (a numb<br/>
brain day) and no one else so if I ever post anything you can&#39;t quite<br/>
make sense of just let me know and I&#39;ll try to make my thoughts more<br/>
clear.<br/>
<br/>
My kids ....<br/>
Nathan (almost 10)loves anything Star Wars, taking things apart, TV<br/>
(he&#39;s an addict so we have to keep an eye on that), Pokemon,keyboard,<br/>
games, playing with our rats and guninea pig, *The Hobbit* and so much<br/>
more ...<br/>
<br/>
Samantha (8 1/2) loves reading, playing on the keyboard, teaching<br/>
herself harmonica, drawing, writing lists and letters to friends and is<br/>
a big Beatrice Potter fan.<br/>
<br/>
Both kids are trying to learn French...Nathan because he wants to be a<br/>
Chef and Sam because she just thinks it&#39;s fun!<br/>
<br/>
Katie (14) is in a *magnet* type semestered highschool in a selfpaced<br/>
program that caters to her needs. So far we&#39;re favourable impressed with<br/>
it.<br/>
Her choice is the public system even though we would have loved it if<br/>
she had chosen to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
I like read (a lot!), to knit and crochet, want to get back into<br/>
watercolour painting, play around on the keyboard, relearning French.<br/>
<br/>
Darryl is into Bar-b-que ing and is building himself a smoker.<br/>
He is wanting to get into robotics and play around with that with<br/>
Nathan.<br/>
<br/>
We both help out where we can with our provincial Homeschool support<br/>
group. Their URL is in our sig if anybody is curious and so is the<br/>
Canadian Homeschool page.<br/>

&gt; OK.....<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a Buddhist. Buddhists believe in the principal of non-attachment.<br/>
&gt; I had my hair long enough to have about an 8inch braid.<br/>
&gt; I was getting to the pint where I obsessed over my hair (vanity) because<br/>
&gt; it was mangy looking and I just don&#39;t *do* hair...have no talent for<br/>
&gt; doing hair!<br/>
&gt; I came to the conclusion that I was too *attatched* to it (pun<br/>
&gt; intended).<br/>
&gt; So one night about 5 yrs ago I walked inot the kitchen and grabbed the<br/>
&gt; kitchen shears and cut off the braid and wallked into the living room<br/>
&gt; and said *I think we better get the electric clippers out and finish<br/>
&gt; this*.<br/>
&gt; So for about 3 yrs after I rather looked like a Buddhist Nun.<br/>
&gt; Never had so many compliments on my hair in my life!<br/>
&gt; Then on our Canadian Homeschool e-list we had a few Debbies pop up and I<br/>
&gt; was no longer the only one so I chose to go by Buzz to avoid confusions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Hi Debbie,<br/>
I&#39;m mostly a lurker, although very rarely I think of something I&#39;ve just <br/>
GOTTA say.  I completely understand what you&#39;re saying about the MS because I <br/>
have central nervous system lupus.  The docs thought it was MS for quite a <br/>
while, until I popped out a great big butterfly rash (hallmark of lupus).  I <br/>
call &quot;those days&quot; Brain Fog and they happen frequently around here!  People <br/>
often ask me if homeschooling isn&#39;t maybe a bad idea since my health is very <br/>
unpredictable.  I tell them that no, the stress of sending my little chickens <br/>
off to school would be much harder on me.  That&#39;s one of the reasons <br/>
unschooling is perfect for us.  There&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t do everything we <br/>
want to do on a day when Mom has to spend lot of time just sitting down and <br/>
relaxing.  It&#39;s given my boys empathy, wisdom, and strength beyond their <br/>
years.  I wish you the best and please feel free to email me privately <br/>
anytime.  It would be nice to relate to someone who understands that <br/>
completely wrung-out, drained feeling and how it affects what we do all day.<br/>

do you mind if my Andy (8 going on 9) gets in on that e-pal action?  He&#39;s <br/>
been wanting to find one, and so far has not found anyone who doesn&#39;t attend <br/>
public school.  I don&#39;t know what Zach&#39;s interests are, but Andy&#39;s are very <br/>
similar to Nathan&#39;s.  He also absolutely LOVES superheroes, magic tricks, and <br/>
outer space.  Do you think they&#39;d hit it off?<br/>

Debbie - something else we have in common!  I too shaved mine when I was <br/>
taking chemo for the lupus, and I LOVED it!  I never had so many compliments. <br/>
 I am seriously considering doing it again.  The only downside - I got cold <br/>
easily.  <br/>

says *Hey I have that* or *Hey I have a family member/friend with that*<br/>

People just don&#39;t get it that life is sooo much easier when you can<br/>

I really don&#39;t think they have a teacher willing to do French work at<br/>
8pm at night (BBEG) or willing to walk my kids to and from school<br/>
because my legs feel like they&#39;re vibrating so bad that I can&#39;t manage<br/>
