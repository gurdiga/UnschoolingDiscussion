<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 6 Mar 2003, at 11:14pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931889060">My daughter met two nice girls at an extra curricular activity.  She wants to get together with them.  <br/>
<br/>
I saw her again tonight and we were supposed to discuss when they could get together.  She didni&#39;t bring her calendar.  We did talk a little bit though and she readily admits she is in no hurry to do this.  (But she is also in no hurry to pursue the gymnastics either...(she told me that too).  <br/>
<br/>
Out of the clear blue sky, she asked me &quot;If you don&#39;t mind my asking, what church you attend?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
(sigh).  Even when I was a devout fundamentalist Christian, strangers never asked me that question.  Obviously that is a priority for her and given her cautious nature, I&#39;m beginning to draw some conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
The ironic thing about this is that I *was* considering attending a church just because I miss the fellowship, but that would not make me a Christian.  And yet, if I had said &quot;I attend such and such church&quot; she would have felt much more sure of me.<br/>
<br/>
Then she started talking about how the gymnasium that our daughters attend does not do child abuse checks on the adults that work there.  It was something I hadn&#39;t thought much about.  I&#39;m there when my girls are in gymnastics so I see everything that goes on, and my youngest does have a male coach.   <br/>
<br/>
What bothers me though is that she said she thinks she is going to push for the gymnasium to do background checks on everyone who works there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still getting to know her so I don&#39;t want to jump to any conclusions.   <br/>
<br/>
The silver lining in all of this is that I can honestly say that  I&#39;m totally happy with how we live and I don&#39;t feel the need to apologize or defend it.  If someone is uncomfortable with us, thats just ok with me. <br/>
<br/>
I guess only time will tell how things progress.<br/>

  You are probably right.  And  normally I would have thought of it, but I guess since I&#39;m there and I&#39;m watching (and if I&#39;m not, there are other parents who are and the coaches never know whose parents are there).  So I figured under these circumstances, its probably ok.<br/>
<br/>
  In any case, I don&#39;t have any problem with it.  I think it was more the way she told me combined with her other concerns that made me wonder if she would ever really feel comfortable with us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972089137">Oh, I understand that its usually for a topic of conversation etc, but this was different.<br/>

It was obvious because of how it fell in the conversation and the way she asked that she was interviewing me in order to screen the wrong people from her daughters.<br/>

<h4>Sorcha</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871219937">I, too, would just say I don&#39;t.  If she&#39;s someone who won&#39;t tolerate any<br/>
religion other than her own, then I wouldn&#39;t want to be friends in the<br/>
first place.  I wouldn&#39;t want her or her kids making snide comments to<br/>
my kids about our religious choices and if she wouldn&#39;t want to be<br/>
friends if she knew we weren&#39;t the same religion, it&#39;s better to have<br/>
that out in the open rather than have her drop us later, after the kids<br/>
are attached to each other.  When people proselytize at me, I usually<br/>
just say, &quot;I&#39;m happy with my own religion, thank you.&quot;  Religion is<br/>
something about which almost everyone has an opinion, and we all think<br/>
we&#39;re right (I mean, in a country with so many religions, if we thought<br/>
our own was wrong, we&#39;d convert to the religion - or non-religion - we<br/>
thought was right).  So arguing about it is pointless; it&#39;s only going<br/>
to result in hurt feelings all around.<br/>
 <br/>
My son had surgery in January and a really sweet nursing assistant was<br/>
playing with him and asked if he went to school.  I just said &quot;no&quot;<br/>
because he&#39;s still a bit under compulsory age, but my husband<br/>
volunteered the fact that we&#39;re homeschoolers.  Well, she must have<br/>
thought that meant we shared her religious beliefs, because she started<br/>
talking about how she&#39;d homeschool too if she had kids and then she gave<br/>
my son a book about Jesus.  I didn&#39;t say anything to her because it<br/>
wasn&#39;t the time or place to discuss our religious beliefs, but my<br/>
husband and I were very uncomfortable.  <br/>
 <br/>
Before my son had his surgery (he had a tumor on his neck that was very<br/>
noticeable) we were traveling in the south and two women came over to us<br/>
in a fried chicken place and started telling us we needed to anoint him<br/>
with sweet oil and bless him in the name of Jesus so his tumor would go<br/>
away.  One of them even pulled out a bottle of oil from her purse and<br/>
shoved it into my hand.  She asked if I knew Jesus, and I just said,<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot; because 1. I grew up Christian, so it&#39;s not really a lie, and 2. I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to hear whatever speech she gives people who say &quot;no&quot;.  My<br/>
husband was completely freaked out by these women, but I grew up<br/>
Pentecostal, and I knew they were just trying to be nice.<br/>

You&#39;re very generous with your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I think more often than you think it IS religious business.   It&#39;s like a <br/>
secret handshake.  If you name the right kind of church, the conversation <br/>
continues more merrily.  If you name the wrong kind, the conversation is <br/>
going to dwindle.  But if you say you haven&#39;t found a church yet that is the <br/>
VERY best answer of all because they can invite you to their church which (at <br/>
least among Baptists) is both courtesy, virtue and proslytizing.<br/>
<br/>
And if you say you don&#39;t go to church, it&#39;s straight to witnessing to your <br/>
soul.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a win/win situation for the questioner, in that context.<br/>

For the door-knockers, I say my goddess is the one that gave birth to their <br/>
god and, by the way, She wants to know why he hasn&#39;t returned Her <br/>
calls!  It&#39;s very rude and that&#39;s not the way she raised him up. (or some <br/>
other nagging-mother-stereotype phrase)  They usually don&#39;t know why, and <br/>
generally leave.<br/>
If I just don&#39;t want to deal, I say Global Congregationalist.  It sounds <br/>
churchy but all it is is the idea of folks around the globe, living in <br/>
peace together. (cue the violins and harps.)<br/>

  For the door-knockers, I say my goddess is the one that gave birth to their <br/>
  god and, by the way, She wants to know why he hasn&#39;t returned Her <br/>
  calls!  It&#39;s very rude and that&#39;s not the way she raised him up. (or some <br/>
  other nagging-mother-stereotype phrase)  They usually don&#39;t know why, and <br/>
  generally leave.<br/>
  If I just don&#39;t want to deal, I say Global Congregationalist.  It sounds <br/>
  churchy but all it is is the idea of folks around the globe, living in <br/>
  peace together. (cue the violins and harps.)<br/>

It really is quite amusing when you think about how much energy they put into <br/>
this sort of thing in small towns.  <br/>

But in defense of the Churches, I will say when there is a tragedy or need in <br/>

&lt;&lt; two women came over to us<br/>
in a fried chicken place and started telling us we needed to anoint him<br/>
with sweet oil and bless him in the name of Jesus so his tumor would go<br/>
away.  One of them even pulled out a bottle of oil from her purse  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was sad to read she pulled oil out.  I thought the fried chicken was going <br/>
to be a factor in the upcoming oil moment!  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She asked if I knew Jesus, and I just said,<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot; because 1. I grew up Christian, so it&#39;s not really a lie, and 2. I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to hear whatever speech she gives people who say &quot;no&quot;.  My<br/>
husband was completely freaked out by these women, but I grew up<br/>
Pentecostal, and I knew they were just trying to be nice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My Hindu boyfriend and I were crossing campus,rushing to get to a movie once <br/>
in the long ago 1970&#39;s and were stopped by a group of Jesus Freaks with a big <br/>
(big) sack of day-old Dunkin Donuts.<br/>
<br/>
They said &quot;Do you know Jesus?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I said, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m saved!&quot; or some appropriate &quot;let us go to the movie <br/>
now&quot; response, and they said, &quot;Praise the Lord, then pray with us&quot; (or some <br/>
irritating Jesus Freak stalling &quot;prove-it&quot; tactic).  So we huddled around a <br/>
sack of donuts, prayed, got a donut and went to the movie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the sack of donuts, for those who are young or never <br/>
experienced fundamentalist tactics, was this:  for one thing, Jesus said feed <br/>
the poor.  <br/>
<br/>
for a tax-thing, Dunkin Donuts could donate leftover donuts in one of the big <br/>
flour bags that the mix comes in to Jesus Freaks and write it off as a real <br/>
donation.<br/>
<br/>
for a wondrous rhetorical thing, though, they say &quot;Do you want a donut?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unsuspecting sinner says, &quot;Sure! Thanks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they say Jesus is handing out eternal life, just like that.  &quot;Do you want <br/>
eternal life?&quot; and all you have to say is &quot;Sure! Thanks!&quot;   and they go from <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Youth ministers with little Baptists will hold out a silver dollar <br/>
(so-called, meaning nowadays a Susan B. or Sacajawea in that bronzy color), <br/>
or a big(ger) fifty cent piece, and they&#39;ll say &quot;Who wants this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if a kid is brave enough to say &quot;I do,&quot; or to go up and claim it, the <br/>
&quot;See?  Jesus is offering eternal life and all you have to do is say &quot;Yes, I <br/>
want that.&quot;<br/>

in a general term to mean whatever organized group you belong to, that is one <br/>
of the things I find to be &quot;a good thing&quot; about them.<br/>
<br/>
I know Pagan who are absolutely wonderful about helping out... and others <br/>
too...<br/>
<br/>
Guess I am still not explaining it right... but the &quot;church&quot; encompasses <br/>
about any organized religion to me, it&#39;s not so much where you worship or <br/>
who, but just the &quot;group&quot; in general, one of the good things about belonging <br/>
to a group of like minded people I guess is what I wanted to say.<br/>

    I personally asked about the references and was given well yeah it is there but all religions are accepted. I guess I have a problem when organizations are so set in their traditions that they can&#39;t see the real need for re-wording their belief statements. I know I could &#39;take a stand&#39; and drop the group but ds loves it!<br/>
    It certainly is a very common issue though of homeschooling being assoicated with religion. Often it is a deviding point of support groups in an area. One group will be open to any, all, and no religions and the other only Christian folks. I find it hard to grasp how you could feel comfortable in both. One you must their requirements before even given support the other has their arms open wide before even knowing your last name.<br/>

&gt; comfortable in both. One you must their requirements before even given <br/>
&gt; support the other has their arms open wide before even knowing your last <br/>
&gt; name.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a sad truth.  Slowly, slowly, slowly I&#39;m finding my niche.  Starting <br/>
over in a new group and new area is requiring far more patience than I had <br/>
anticipated.  The good thing is my patience has paid off and I&#39;m feeling far <br/>
more supported than I had in my 7 months here. We met at a playland, just 4 <br/>
moms and our 6 kids among us ~ ate pizza and talked about all the <br/>
grownup-homeschooling-chick-stuff, for HOURS :):):)  We&#39;ve had a big turnover <br/>
in the original *inclusive* group and we&#39;re still learning and determining <br/>
who we are *now*.  I&#39;m surrounded by hordes of *exclusive* support groups.  <br/>
I&#39;m saddened by their behavior and I find them not at all Christ-like.  As <br/>
much as I know I am in a deeply spiritual, sacred area, I am reminded that <br/>
the roots here are deeply secured in the Bible Belt.  Now that I have <br/>
maintained myself, my belief systems, a true representation of diana in the <br/>
face of their intolerance, a few have to look at me as the Heathen they <br/>
really like :) which, of course, is fine with me!  I hope I&#39;ve paved the way <br/>
for others to join us on our journey; learn and teach as we are, my new <br/>
friends and I.  Our diversity is amazing.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836359481">whenever ppl approach me with some trip about their religion, seeking<br/>
to convert, i just say, &quot;I believe Sun Myung Moon is the living<br/>
incarnation of Christ. I&#39;ve been a moonie for 30 years.&quot; They just go<br/>
away very distraught. If they ask about brainwashing I just tell them<br/>
mine is drycleaned.<br/>
<br/>
it was depressing when I tried to join some homeschooling group in my<br/>
small southern town years back. they had these statements of faith<br/>
that just made me want to scream. (if i bring down the wrath of<br/>
fundementalists on this list with my statements, just flame me now as<br/>
a heretic. might as well go down a cybermartyr!)<br/>
<br/>
i finally found a sane group of ppl among unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
ok. so they weren&#39;t sane. but.... anyway, they were nice.<br/>
