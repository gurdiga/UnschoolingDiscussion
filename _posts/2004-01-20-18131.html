Pearls.  They are tons easier and more comfortable than tampons.  I would<br/>
use them even if they weren&#39;t healthier and more environmentally friendly. <br/>
I convert anyone who will listen:)  I really can&#39;t say enough about how<br/>
much easier they are to use.   <br/>

leaking. It does take a bit of getting used to though...you actually<br/>
need to pull it out to create a seal rather then push it in and up like<br/>
a tampon.<br/>
<br/>
Once it is in and settles I pretty much forget that it is in.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a FAQ page on TSS:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toxicshock.com/">http://www.toxicshock.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
(Most of the headers are pictures, so it&#39;s easier to read at the website)<br/>
=====<br/>
You may have heard about the illness toxic shock syndrome (TSS) from<br/>
magazines or from friends, but do you know why it is important to be aware<br/>
of this illness? Would you recognise the symptoms? TSS is an extremely rare<br/>
but potentially serious illness that can affect anyone. This website gives<br/>
you the essential facts about TSS, helping you to understand what TSS is and<br/>
how it is caused. Bookmark this site for easy reference in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a type of blood poisoning that will make you<br/>
feel severely ill very quickly.<br/>
TSS is a rare but potentially serious illness that can develop quickly in<br/>
anyone ­ men, women and children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TSS is caused by the common bacteria ­ Staphylococcus aureus ­ which<br/>
normally live harmlessly on the skin and in the nose, armpit, groin or<br/>
vagina of one in every three people. In rare cases certain strains of these<br/>
bacteria can produce toxins (poisons) that cause TSS.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     TSS is extremely rare and most doctors will never even see a case.<br/>
There are probably around 40 cases of TSS per year in the UK.<br/>
In extreme cases it may prove fatal and sadly out of the small number of<br/>
people who fall ill each year, 2-3 die from TSS1.<br/>
1Source: Public Health Laboratory Service, UK<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can get TSS ­ men, women and children. Half the reported cases of TSS<br/>
are associated with women using tampons; half result from localised<br/>
infections, for example following burns, boils, insect bites or surgery. The<br/>
risk of TSS is greater in younger people. This is because older people are<br/>
more likely to have the necessary antibodies to protect them from the toxin<br/>
that causes TSS. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the symptoms of TSS are much like severe flu¹<br/>
and usually include some or all of the following:<br/>
<br/>
a sudden high fever (temperature)<br/>
vomiting<br/>
a sunburn-like rash<br/>
diarrhoea<br/>
fainting or feeling faint<br/>
muscle aches<br/>
dizziness<br/>
confusion<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     Consult your doctor at once, if you or anyone you know, has some of<br/>
these symptoms and suspect TSS. If you are wearing a tampon remove it and<br/>
tell your doctor that you have been using tampons. Don¹t worry about being<br/>
alarmist ­ it is important to rule out the possibility of having TSS and if<br/>
necessary your doctor will then be able to begin treatment early.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With early diagnosis TSS can be treated with antibiotics to kill the<br/>
Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, and other medicines which help counteract<br/>
the symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The link between TSS and tampon use is unclear. Research suggests that for<br/>
cases which occur in women using tampons, tampon absorbency is a factor. For<br/>
this reason it is important that you:<br/>
<br/>
always use a tampon with the lowest absorbancy suitable for your period flow<br/>
<br/>
use a sanitary towel or panty liner from time to time during your period<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Information about TSS is contained in the tampon manufacturers¹ instruction<br/>
leaflet. This information is often updated, so remember to read the leaflet<br/>
regularly.<br/>
<br/>
When using tampons, it is also important to remember to:<br/>
<br/>
wash your hands before and after inserting a tampon<br/>
change tampons regularly, as often as directed on<br/>
the pack<br/>
never insert more than one tampon at a time<br/>
when using at night, insert a fresh tampon before going to bed and remove it<br/>
on waking<br/>
remove a tampon at the end of a period<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Toxic shock syndrome is a rare illness. From a UK population of around 58<br/>
million there are about 40 cases reported each year, half of which are<br/>
associated with women using tampons1.<br/>
<br/>
Men, women and children can get toxic shock syndrome, for example following<br/>
burns, boils, insect bites or infections after surgery. About half of the<br/>
reported cases are linked to women who use tampons; the other half are not.<br/>
<br/>
With early diagnosis toxic shock syndrome can be successfully treated.<br/>
Sadly, however, out of the small number of people who fall ill each year,<br/>
2-3 people die from TSS1. It is important to remember that if TSS is<br/>
diagnosed and treated early there is a good chance of recovery.<br/>
<br/>
Most doctors will never see a case of toxic shock syndrome. TSS is so rare<br/>
that most doctors will not come across TSS during their medical careers.<br/>

That is she wants to use one try it. BUT she must change it often.<br/>
IF they are uncomfortable she should take it out. She deciede maybe <br/>
she would try it at a later date.<br/>

One case of infection I read about, the woman had left it in for a whole <br/>
month or more.  You have to be ignoring a lot of things in your life to not notice <br/>
that.  It wasn&#39;t the fault of the tampon.  Any entry into your body can carry <br/>
germs.  Catheter, feeding tube, string...<br/>
