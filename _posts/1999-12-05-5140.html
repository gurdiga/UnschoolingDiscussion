&lt;&lt; <br/>
 Over the years, working in all my different online persona&#39;s, I wish I had a<br/>
 nickel for every 11-12 year old girl who wanted to add structure to her day.<br/>
 I could afford a retreat weekend.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chuckling over this.  I&#39;m Marcie, new to the list, and this is also our first <br/>
year of home schooling.  My soon-to-be-11 year old has had days where she got <br/>
a notebook out and planned out her day included bathroom trips.<br/>
<br/>
We are taking the plunge into unschooling and I am really enjoying the list <br/>
and the message boards and have read some stories that sound so much like our <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
Our girls are nearly 11, 6 and 2, and my oldest had a rotten year last year <br/>
in public school.  We let them finish the year out, but let them know in the <br/>
spring that we were going to begin home schooling in August.  My oldest was <br/>
angry and upset; she is now the president of the home schooling cheerleading <br/>
squad . . .   She thought she needed structure to learn anything.  We&#39;ve <br/>
found out that that&#39;s just what she doesn&#39;t need.  My 6 year old is a born <br/>
unschooler if there ever was one.  <br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I have been the biggest problem in all of this.  I&#39;m a very <br/>
structured, &quot;student&quot; type who likes things to be organized.  In my evolution <br/>
as a home schooling parent the last few months, I finally came to the <br/>
conclusion that I needed to be more courageous and get past my own <br/>
insecurities for my children&#39;s sake.  I would appreciate your prayers--this <br/>
is not an easy journey for me.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to getting to know all of you.<br/>
<br/>
