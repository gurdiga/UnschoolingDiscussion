<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785143319">***The real question was which Tom Cruise movies Holly might like.  She<br/>
wouldn&#39;t <br/>
like that one. &lt;g&gt;  Nor Mission Impossible.  <br/>
 <br/>
Since Keith loves bombs and westerns and Holly loves musicals and<br/>
fantasies, <br/>
what they watch together are things like Paint Your Wagon. &lt;g&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
They might make it half way through &quot;Far and Away&quot;.&lt;g&gt;   John Williams<br/>
composed the music and it&#39;s a kind of a western, but I don&#39;t remember<br/>
anything being blown to bits.   There&#39;s a fire or two and some good fight<br/>
scenes.&lt;g&gt;  I liked it but almost no one else did.  = /<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Ron Howards epic tale tells the story of two Irish immigrants quest for<br/>
land during the 1890s Oklahoma land rush. Tom Cruise stars as Joseph<br/>
Donnelly, an ambitious young farmer in western Ireland. When a local<br/>
protest against wealthy landlord Daniel Christie (Robert Prosky) results<br/>
in the death of his father, Joseph seeks revenge. But his attempt at<br/>
vengeance is thwarted by Shannon Christie (Nicole Kidman), the landlord&#39;s<br/>
high-spirited and headstrong daughter, who stabs Joseph with a pitchfork.<br/>
While convalescing at the Christies&#39; manor, Joseph is propositioned by<br/>
Shannon, who asks him to travel with her to America--where she is<br/>
determined to acquire some of the free land being given away in the<br/>
Oklahoma Territory. Arriving in Boston, Joseph acts as protective brother<br/>
to Shannon in the foreign city streets as they struggle to earn the money<br/>
to travel out west.  Rating: PG-13. <br/>

My husband and I both liked that movie. And I really didn&#39;t expect to like <br/>
it. I don&#39;t care for Tom Cruise and from the previews of the movie, I didn&#39;t <br/>
really have the desire to see it. It was a nice surprise.<br/>
