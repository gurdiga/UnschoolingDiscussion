&lt;&lt; Understanding quite a bit of canine behavior, I will address this: <br/>
 If he rejects the idea of alpha, he CANNOT choose to stay with the pack; <br/>
it&#39;s <br/>
 run on a pack level. Rejecting it, he rejects the pack and would be killed.<br/>
 <br/>
 He wouldn&#39;t survive long without the pack---he&#39;s a pack animal. <br/>
 <br/>
 The idea of a wolf rejecting the pack IS delusional. Survival of the <br/>
fittest. <br/>
 Different &quot;don&#39;t work&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
It was my impression that a wolf will, indeed, sometimes leave the pack.  But <br/>
that they then attempt to build their own or join another pack.  <br/>

I will admit that my knowledge is limited to PBS nature shows, tho, lol.  <br/>

<br/>
A wolf might challenge the alpha male or female (for rank) and be ejected<br/>
from the pack or killed. <br/>
<br/>
In Yellowstone park a couple of years ago the alpha female of the Druid<br/>
Peak pack, was killed  by other pack females who apparently successfully<br/>
mounted a coup.   Her sister had built a den the year before and the<br/>
alpha female forced her out.   After the alpha female&#39;s death (murder)<br/>
her sister began moving her pups into the alpha den.   In wolf packs only<br/>
the alpha pair is the breeding pair.  There was insubordination in the<br/>
ranks. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not about rejecting hierarchy. <br/>
<br/>
Lone wolves might survive for awhile on small pray, but it takes a pack,<br/>
cooperation, to bring down large prey.   Lone wolves aren&#39;t the norm. <br/>
Neither are lone humans.   Lone wolves, if they live long enough will<br/>
form a new pack (where hierarchy exists) or join another pack.   Lone<br/>
humans sometimes turn out to be Ted Kaczynski types.   <br/>
<br/>
Even unschoolers who feel isolated seek out other unschoolers on message<br/>
boards and e-mail lists.   Even unschooling parents question whether<br/>
their children have enough play time with other children. <br/>

 Thanks for answering.  <br/>
<br/>
I am sorry, I&#39;m not going to respond to the rest.  My head might explode.  <br/>

The claim to which Kelly was responding was that a wolf could choose to <br/>
reject the idea of &quot;alpha male,&quot; yet choose to remain with the pack.<br/>
