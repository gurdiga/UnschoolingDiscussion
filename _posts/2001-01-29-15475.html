Excellent point!  But Mother Dance isn&#39;t an unschooling or even a<br/>
homeschooling book, so we&#39;ll have to excuse her! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the difficulty in this limit setting discussion is that<br/>
we don&#39;t have many &quot;natural&quot; limits in our modern society.  200 years<br/>
ago, people couldn&#39;t have ice cream in their freezer (or M&M&#39;s anywhere).<br/>
 In order to have ice cream, you would have to make it (which means you&#39;d<br/>
have to get ice from somewhere) and you couldn&#39;t save the leftovers. <br/>
People did not have to choose between eating ice cream or something else.<br/>
 Same with electronic media.  It just wasn&#39;t an option.  And so much work<br/>
was involved just in basic food, shelter, etc., that there was less<br/>
leisure time anyway.  And since most people were physically active just<br/>
with basic chores, it didn&#39;t matter if leisure time was spent laying<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe as somebody said to those who think their kids spend too much<br/>
time electronically, the key is to make sure that there are other<br/>
interesting options and model it yourself.  I know that when dd asks to<br/>
watch a movie, most of the time she will choose doing something with me<br/>
instead, if given the choice.<br/>
