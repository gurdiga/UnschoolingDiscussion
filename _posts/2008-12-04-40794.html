<br/>
you&#39;ll see what&#39;s seemingly impossible.<br/>
<br/>
If you tried to balance rocks as a kid you probably gave up fairly  <br/>
quickly, certain it was impossible. Even if you see the pictures, it  <br/>
looks like there&#39;s some trick and you&#39;re not really seeing rocks  <br/>
balanced on their tips on top of each other.<br/>
<br/>
But you can watch a video:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a trick though it takes patience and trying it out. Bill  <br/>
Dan&#39;s not the only one who can do it. The skill has been practiced  <br/>
for quite a while. It&#39;s called rock balancing:<br/>

<br/>
Once you know it *can* be done, then with patience and determination  <br/>
you can figure out how to do it too.<br/>
<br/>
It struck me as I was looking through the images and watching the  <br/>
videos, that rock balancing is like unschooling and mindful  <br/>
parenting. Viewed through the impossible lenses of school and  <br/>
conventional parenting it seems impossible. But once you see it being  <br/>
done, through lists and conferences in real life friends, it can give  <br/>
you the confidence to actually do it yourself.<br/>
