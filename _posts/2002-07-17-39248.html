 </span></blockquote>We did this last April! The kids and I headed out for a road trip from our <br/>
home in Utah. Along the way we stopped in to meet and stay with Karin in <br/>
Phoenix and Sandra in Albuquerque. It was a great experience. We also flew <br/>
to NY in June for a family wedding and arranged  a get together with Joyce <br/>
and AnneO in the city. Another fabulous experience for all of us. I highly <br/>
recommend meeting other unschooling families from this list and the message <br/>
boards.<br/>
