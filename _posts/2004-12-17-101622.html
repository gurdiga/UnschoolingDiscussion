you know, i had the hardest time trusting this one!  i just felt really<br/>
strongly that my kids were addicted to sugar and if i gave them an<br/>
endless supply, they&#39;d consume an endless supply.  and at first, it<br/>
looked to be true...i opened the doors, started buying them fruit snacks<br/>
and whatever at the store when they asked.  they would rip through an<br/>
entire box each of whatever sweet thing we&#39;d gotten and it&#39;d be gone and<br/>
then they&#39;d want soda, and then ice cream...i remember staring at them in<br/>
disbelief!  when would they stop?!  i&#39;d find them eating sugar straight<br/>
out of the bag, honey and maple syrup out of the jars, even plain<br/>
ketchup! well, the next time it was less of a frenzy, and the next time<br/>
it was less and so on.  <br/>
<br/>
we recently made a carrot cake just for fun (dd picked out a boxed mix<br/>
from the store which i don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever done before) and they were<br/>
so excited.  we baked it up, waited for it to cool, frosted it, and ate a<br/>
piece.  that was enough excitement for everyone. :)  i think two of the<br/>
three kids might have had one more piece the next day for breakfast and<br/>
the there was no interest.  i couldn&#39;t even believe it!  what you&#39;ve all<br/>
been talking about happening finally happened here!<br/>
<br/>
too bad i couldn&#39;t just trust it to begin with...that would have made it<br/>
a lot easier. :)  but, then again...i *really* get it now.<br/>
<br/>
just wanted to share that...<br/>
love,<br/>
