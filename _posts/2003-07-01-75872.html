&gt; accomodations that I don&#39;t know if we can swing.   We would really need a<br/>
&gt; suite <br/>
&gt; to save some $$ on meals, but I understand that the suites are already<br/>
&gt; booked... I probably won&#39;t know til the last possible minute if we can come.<br/>

You don&#39;t need a suite.  The kids that don&#39;t fit in beds will probably find<br/>
the floor to be an adventure.  You might need a hot pot ($10 or less at<br/>
WalMart) and definitely a cooler.   For two days, you can easily make<br/>
sandwiches for lunch (long live peanut butter!) or eat yogurt and crackers,<br/>
and make simple things for dinner in a hot pot or the microwave the hotel<br/>
must surely have someplace.  I&#39;ve made a box of Mac & Cheese in a hot pot<br/>
express, spaghetti is possible, homemade chili, etc.  Bring fresh fruit and<br/>
veggies and a knife and you&#39;re good to go.  You can join my friend and I in<br/>
our hotel room.  We&#39;ll be doing much the same, and the kids will be holding<br/>
a slumber party on our floor, too.<br/>

and we do know how to eat out of cooler and hot pot ( a fire would be nice, but <br/>
I dont think the hotel would allow it).   We can all fit in a room with 2 <br/>
double beds, although sleeping on the floor is fun and they may end up having a <br/>
slumber party too.   I talked with another friend today who has been to the <br/>
conference and she absolutely loved it.   I thought the deadline for registration <br/>
was the end of this month, but she refreshed my memory that is it not until <br/>
Aug 19.. SOOO, I have a couple more weeks to scheme and scrape.. LOL.    I am <br/>
going to do everything I can in order to come!  Thanks for the encouragement<br/>
<br/>
