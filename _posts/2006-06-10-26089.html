I&#39;m afraid that will be cut off, but if you cut and paste the whole  <br/>
thing you can see the article where I saw it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s weird, but it&#39;s more positive than negative.  And I think it was  <br/>
a serious mistake for an &quot;expert&quot; to use the word &quot;ignoramus&quot;  <br/>
regarding something about which he knows nothing.<br/>

===============================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling unpopular, but it&#39;s growing trend<br/>

<br/>
I suppose it is human nature to crave something of which one has  <br/>
never had enough.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that way about education. And although it is a bit late in the  <br/>
day for me to fill that gaping void in my existence, I cannot resist  <br/>
reading about the methods designed to turn ignorance into knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
There is, of course, a multitude of practices - schools private and  <br/>
public, kindergartens, elementary classes, middle schools, high  <br/>
schools, colleges, universities. Then there are home-schoolers whose  <br/>
children, according to studies, often become valuable members of our  <br/>
culture.<br/>
<br/>
Just when I was enthralled by the revolution in education triggered  <br/>
by home schooling, along comes a brand new movement so advanced in  <br/>
its philosophy as to boggle the most progressive mind. The message is  <br/>
startling in its simplicity: Let&#39;s let the kids decide what they want  <br/>
to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Let the children set their own curriculum. How can kids ever achieve  <br/>
their all-important self-esteem when adults ceaselessly hamstring  <br/>
their inborn desires and dreams? Would little Mozart have composed  <br/>
anything worth listening to had he been shoved away from his piano to  <br/>
attend Math 1? Would young Shakespeare have dreamed of Hamlet had he  <br/>
been distracted by having to recite how he spent his summer vacation?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing elucidates the benefits of allowing kids &quot;to be themselves&quot;  <br/>
better than the recent Republic article on the topic. &quot;No one tracks  <br/>
unschooling,&quot; says the piece, &quot;but Pat Farenga, president of Holt  <br/>
Associates, an unschooling advocacy group in Maine, said that books,  <br/>
Web sites and blogs have helped the movement grow to an estimated 10  <br/>
percent of homeschoolers. That would mean there are about 1,200  <br/>
unschoolers in Maricopa County.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The idea behind unschooling is that children will learn faster if  <br/>
they choose what they learn instead of a teacher choosing for  <br/>
them. . . . The theory behind unschooling is that it builds on a  <br/>
child&#39;s natural abilities, which helps them develop intrinsic  <br/>
motivation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you know it, though, even the brightest ideas will bring out  <br/>
the usual spoilsports? Take Thomas Hatch, associate professor at  <br/>
Columbia University&#39;s Teachers College.<br/>
<br/>
Says he, &quot;Children who aren&#39;t self-motivated may not function well  <br/>
because no one makes them do the work. Likewise, students who flit  <br/>
from topic to topic within a few minutes won&#39;t benefit as much as  <br/>
those who focus and are persistent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tom Horne, Arizona superintendent of public instruction, is even more  <br/>
brutally skeptical. To have students pursuing only subjects that  <br/>
interest them while neglecting core topics, he asserts, &quot;is a recipe  <br/>
for producing unskilled ignoramuses.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously neither of the gentlemen has undergone a moment of  <br/>
unschooling or they would realize the unsullied wisdom coming out of  <br/>
the mouths of babes. Alas, the unschool revolution will just have to  <br/>
struggle along without their help. It&#39;ll just take a bit longer.  <br/>
Maybe a half-century, with luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811571336">FYI - this article is referring to one that was written earlier and <br/>
I&#39;m not sure anyone posted a link here. It was on the front page of <br/>
the Arizona Republic on May 8th.  Here&#39;s the online version and the <br/>
comments at the bottom are very interesting.  Of course you&#39;ll have <br/>
to make sure you get both lines copied in the address....<br/>
