could probably be considered unschoolers.  Most people think they did<br/>

How can you consider Franklin an unschooler, let alone a homeschooler?  His education was pretty typical for his time and family&#39;s income level.  He did attend school and then took an aprenticeship.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very meaningful to talk about people being homeschooled or unschooled prior to 1900 or so.  Before then, there were all sorts of acceptable approaches to educating one&#39;s children.  Many never attended school or had only a few years of formal education.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811672477">Ben Franklin did not learn to read in school, and much of what he did<br/>
learn was done on his own.  I would consider any child who spends all<br/>
his money on books that interest him to be an unschooler:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was put to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father<br/>
intending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of<br/>
the Church.  My early readiness in learning to read (which must have<br/>
been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the<br/>
opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good<br/>
scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that<br/>
came into my hands was ever laid out in books.  Pleased with the<br/>
Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan&#39;s works in<br/>
separate little volumes.  I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R.<br/>
Burton&#39;s Historical Collections; they were small<br/>
chapmen&#39;s books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all.  My father&#39;s little<br/>
library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which<br/>
I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when I had such<br/>
a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way<br/>
since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch&#39;s<br/>
Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and I still<br/>
think that time spent to great advantage.  There was also a book of De<br/>
Foe&#39;s, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr. Mather&#39;s,<br/>
called Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking<br/>
that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484503105">That was basically my point-there were all sorts of acceptable methods<br/>
before we &#39;fixed&#39; that.  I just wanted you to imagine Franklin or<br/>
Lincoln sitting in a modern school and what that type of education<br/>
would have meant to the future of our country.  Just because they<br/>
lived before 1900 doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t draw ideas about what does and<br/>
doesn&#39;t work in education.<br/>

When I was a child I spent all my money on books.  I talked my parents  into <br/>

Happy Hollisters  (I did save those).   I  had to save allowance for two weeks <br/>
to buy a paperback at the department store  nearest my house. I always ordered <br/>
books from Scholastic books (still have some  of those old paperbacks) and I <br/>
bought a dictionary with my own money in 4th  grade.<br/>
 <br/>
I was not an unschooler.<br/>
 <br/>
There are unschoolers who are exemplary, amazing unschoolers who have  rarely <br/>

I don&#39;t think book buying is a good criterion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-304898547">I was replying to an earlier post.  When I said any kid, I was<br/>
actually referring to this particular kid, a pre-teen holding down a<br/>
job and using books as his primary means of learning.  I was trying to<br/>
explain why I considered him to be an unschoolerI never meant it to<br/>
be an all inclusive list that absolutely defined what is or is not an<br/>
unschooled or home schooled kid.  Sorry for any confusion this may<br/>
have caused.<br/>
<br/>
Although I was enrolled in school for ten years, I would consider<br/>
myself an unschooler of sorts.  I started at a private school, and<br/>
attended K-3 there before being expelled for not turning in school<br/>
work.  I went to four schools for fourth grade, and cut more than half<br/>
the school days between the seventh and tenth grades.  I learned<br/>
almost nothing in school after second grade.  I learned much more from<br/>
older friends who had jobs (electricians, auto mechanics, Grocers,<br/>
etc.), and spent a lot of time exploring Los Angeles while my friends<br/>
were in school.  I had no problem passing the California Proficiency<br/>
Test and starting college at 16.<br/>
