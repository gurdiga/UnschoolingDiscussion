<div id="ygrps-yiv-18680278">If you rec&#39;d an email from me today with an attachment please do not open it.  I was infected with the Badtrans and trojan virus. Although I recognized it immediately, this virus is FAST.  It began sending emails to every single person in my address book.   It did not help that I did not update my virus protection program recently, I had my mail program set to automatically send messages in my outbox immediately and how stupid is this.... I also had my email program saving the addresses of every single person I emailed in the past to my address book.<br/>
<br/>
You can not imagine how bad I feel about this.  I opened the virus from a trusted source but unfortunately she was not aware she had it.  I am so sorry if I have harmed, inconvenienced or infected anyone.  Please know that I would never, ever do something like this intentionally.  Although all is clear on my end now, I can&#39;t help but feel awful for those who may have been affected.<br/>
<br/>
Please accept my warning and apology.... and learn from my mistakes.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967366133">Crystal, I understand completely. I was infected a few months ago myself. Most of the people on this list probably remember. We live, we learn. Get your virus scan updated frequently. <br/>
