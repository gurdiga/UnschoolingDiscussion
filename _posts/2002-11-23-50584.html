 </span></blockquote>Hi Teresa,<br/>
   So much had happened on the message board since my last message. <br/>
Wow!<br/>
   Thanks for taking on the project.  I Haven&#39;t gone to the new group <br/>
yet, but have told my boy about it and he actually sounded interested <br/>
in joining up.  YES!   He is in an archeologist mode now and digging <br/>
a big whole on our property and finding some interesting objects <br/>
pretty deep down in the ground.  He wants to share that.<br/>
  Anyway I wish you good luck, sounds like a good thing to me.  Hope <br/>
it takes off.<br/>
Blessing,<br/>
Govinda</div>
