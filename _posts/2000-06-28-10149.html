<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744089437">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Questions I have... How do you get comfortable with letting them do whatever <br/>
they want, whenever they want.  Zak at the moment spends hours on the same <br/>
thing and I worry that he&#39;ll never give up building or playing on the <br/>
computer or doing whatever it is he&#39;s doing.  Is this something that comes <br/>
over time.  When some of your first started was this something you had to <br/>
deal with in yourselves or were you ok with whatever happened.  What if the <br/>
something includes you doing things over and over again?  How involved are <br/>
you in what they are doing?  All day, when they ask?<br/>
<br/>
Feedback would be great.<br/>
<br/>
