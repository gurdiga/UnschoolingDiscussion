<div id="ygrps-yiv-365531835">Seeing Seamus&#39; rendition of the Numa Numa song started a trend here at our  <br/>
home :o)<br/>
 <br/>
My son first found the original video for the group.  Does anyone know  where <br/>
the group is from?  I tried to find a fan page but no luck.<br/>
 <br/>
We started doing searches and have spent about 2 days off and on cracking  up <br/>
at all the Numa Numa videos out there.  Our favorites are Seamus&#39;, and  the <br/>
one we got from limeware (I&#39;d forward it but am not sure how to, but it&#39;s  <br/>
titled &quot;Numa Numa funny guys&quot; (it&#39;s these 3 teenage boys who are singing it in  <br/>
their kitchen, and their dad even makes a guest appearance...look like happy  <br/>
kids!!).  <br/>
 <br/>
And there&#39;s another with (I guess) a famous bad guy from a video game (I  <br/>
think WarCraft?).  It can be found here:<br/>

 <br/>
but fair warning, there&#39;s some videos there with bad (really bad) language  <br/>
so if that offends you just watch the &quot;numa numa WOW style&quot; (third one  down)  <br/>
There&#39;s the original at the bottom of the page the first guy to do a  silly <br/>
video to it and a compilation with a bunch of them put together.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve found a ton of them and had a good time...even my husband started  <br/>
searching for them.  His favorite is the WOW one :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656810063">It&#39;s funny - we have been doing the same thing here at our house. I have to <br/>
say I too loves Seamus&#39; Numa Numa. He is so expressive ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I must have been living under a rock - because I missed all the Numa Numa <br/>
stuff - but apparently that first guy wound up pretty famous - on Good <br/>
Morning America and CNN, etc. I&#39;ll bet too that his &quot;parody&quot; has helped that <br/>
Romanian band get more exposure!<br/>
<br/>
In any case - my kids have been making up their own &quot;Numa Numa&quot; around the <br/>
house....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Seamus&#39;! We have been having a blast.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921132722">Thanks for the link to the WOW. That was pretty cute. So was Seamus! UHMmmmm until Seamus&#39;s video, I&#39;d never heard of the song......but it&#39;s pretty catchy even though I have no clue what is being said! <br/>
