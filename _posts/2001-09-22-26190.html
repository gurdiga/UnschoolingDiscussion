<div id="ygrps-yiv-144209358">LOL!  Bridget,<br/>
I don&#39;t like the shoes, either,  especially since I have what my dh calls<br/>
&quot;Fred Flintstone feet&quot;  :-)<br/>
There are many aggravating things about the Flylady....but I&#39;ve tried it for<br/>
about six weeks now.  I can only say I&#39;m tremendously grateful to her/this<br/>
website  for enabling me to find a way to begin managing my home.  My home<br/>
is more manageable...my children get more of my attention,  and more freedom<br/>
to be creative;  and for the first tie in any of our lives,  we can get out<br/>
the door for activities wothout the usual grousing,  grumbling,  and<br/>
yelling.  Like most things out there...you take what you need and ditch the<br/>
rest - I find this program quite adaptable to our eclectic lifestyle!<br/>

The flylady just does not cut it for me.  Anyone who asks me to wear my<br/>
shoes is not going to get anywhere with me!  Anyway, her style just does<br/>
not fit in with our eclectic lifestyle.  I did find a group called<br/>
&quot;flyswatters&quot; at yahoo groups.  They are people for whom the flylady did<br/>
not work out.<br/>

 I also have &quot;Fred Flinstone&quot; feet and that is the first time I have ever<br/>
heard someone else using the phrase outside of our family. By the way, where<br/>
do you find shoes? I have a real hard time finding shoes to fit my feet. I<br/>
love my moccasins. Lots of great ideas, but you are right about taking the<br/>
best and leaving the rest.<br/>
