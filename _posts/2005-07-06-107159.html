Betsy, I&#39;m sure there will be vegans and sugar avoiders, but they can <br/>
always figure things out for themselves.  I have great faith in <br/>
potlucks.  Bring something your family will love.  (That&#39;s why I&#39;m always <br/>
bringing four things to potlucks  :)  )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay - not in the Bay area, but as regulars at all sorts of <br/>
potlucks, we just make sure to label dishes with anything not <br/>
totally obvious - if it looks like meatballs, and smells like <br/>
meatballs, it probably is meatballs unless we label it as veggie-<br/>
substitute balls. Likewise, we label our PB oatmeal cookies so nut <br/>
allergic people can stay clear as well as dairy people (they contain <br/>
yogurt) but there&#39;s no added sugars (uses mashed banana) so folks <br/>
want to know that too. We just list ingredients on a 3x5 card and <br/>
tape it to the container. And, if there&#39;s someone we particularly <br/>
know is dairy sensitive or veg. and we&#39;ve brought a dish they might <br/>
enjoy, we&#39;ll let them know off to the side which is ours - one <br/>
person even has started checking in with us because we often bring <br/>
meatless, dairyless, dishes (just because we know there are folks <br/>
there who might otherwise not have an option - like when the <br/>
main &#39;theme&#39; is chili, DH makes an awesome vegan chili so we make <br/>
sure the non-meat folks know which is our pot).<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents as a potlucker (is that even a word?LOL)<br/>
