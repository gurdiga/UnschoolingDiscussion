<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275995738">My son dived right into history when he began playing the Age of Empires <br/>
PC game.   He is now an expert in medieval weaponry and the battle <br/>
strategies of Alexander -- just to name a couple of things we were <br/>
discussing this evening.  We have a gazillion games around here and that <br/>
is one he returns to again and again.  He&#39;s also doing Civilization III, <br/>
but it&#39;s a bit tedious without the &quot;cheats.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
We also are looking into the Society for Creative Anachronism.  We <br/>
haven&#39;t joined, per se, but we&#39;ve been to some of their events and <br/>
really enjoyed those.<br/>
