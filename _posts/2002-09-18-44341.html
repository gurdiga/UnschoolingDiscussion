<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133202797">I think it&#39;s real important for all homeschoolers to realize what the laws <br/>
are in their own home state. And I do mean exactly what they are. I also <br/>
think it&#39;s very important, like someone else said, not to give them more <br/>
than is necessary. That means what the law requires. NOT what someone just <br/>
wants to know and is asking for. If you need to educate anyone asking in <br/>
regard to the school system, then educate them on the law and nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
We had that here with some of our parents in my local support group. Many of <br/>
us heard, &quot;well it&#39;s no big deal for me to&quot; or &quot;I like having it for me&quot; or <br/>
&quot;well they seemed to appreciate my extra effort.&quot; This came from putting <br/>
together portfolio&#39;s to when they sent in letters to other things. I <br/>
understand that some want to keep more than requested for themselves and I <br/>
understand how many think it&#39;s just easier to do what is asked of them. But <br/>
in the long run, it will hurt us all. The more they get beyond what is law, <br/>
the more they ask for and come to expect. My support group tires to make it <br/>
very clear that it&#39;s not a matter of being difficult, it&#39;s a matter of what <br/>
is right. Law is law and do just that. If not, I see that maybe all of us <br/>
will end up inundated with paper work and appointments that we don&#39;t want to <br/>
have.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I realizd that after I read the other post pertaining to that, and <br/>
deleted most of the things I had put together.  I had written out a <br/>
detailed list of activities we&#39;d already done, and planned to do, as <br/>
well as my assessment reports.  But I took it back down to about 13 <br/>
pages of nothing more than the law, and the main page off the other <br/>
sites. I figured if she wanted to know more she had the web address&#39;s <br/>
and could look them up herself.  I also added a few articles, but did <br/>
not turn over anything directly related to our own activities, as I <br/>
had planned too in the beginning.  So basically all she got was web <br/>
pages that educated, but did not violate our privacy in itself.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope that&#39;s OK, but I figure it would be best to try and educate <br/>
her first, before I ended up having to educate some judge.  But she <br/>
didn&#39;t get any of our records, and didn&#39;t view any of the kids work <br/>
except a story mariah is working on, I showed her that basically more <br/>
to brag than anything about how well she is learning.<br/>
