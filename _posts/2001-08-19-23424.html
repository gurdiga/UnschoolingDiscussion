<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998166614">Hi,<br/>
  Writing in mirror image is very common among children, so don&#39;t worry<br/>
about it. My daughter did this, and at some point over the past three years,<br/>
she corrected it. She is 8 and occasionally writes backwards, but she<br/>
recognizes it now, before she couldn&#39;t see it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Before I began homeschooling (and then unschooling) I<br/>
taught Pre-K and Kindergarten (at a private school)<br/>
and mirror writing is very very common. Many children<br/>
do complete mirror writing and most do at least some. <br/>
Not to worry at all!<br/>
