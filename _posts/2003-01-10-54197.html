<div id="ygrps-yiv-979826419">**But the responsibility of discovering whether those theories are lousy or<br/>
not lies with the one seeking knowledge, not with those dishing it out.<br/>
Obviously if I am fully convinced by a philosophy I *can&#39;t* be objective so<br/>
you shouldn&#39;t take what I say as truth. If there&#39;s something you like about<br/>
the philosophy you should ask questions and think about it and decide for<br/>
yourself if it will work for your goals. But you shouldn&#39;t expect me to<br/>
compromise my beliefs (or others to compromise their beleifs) so you can<br/>
have easy access to other points of view.**<br/>

Awesome, Joyce.  You really laid out clearly what has been a sticky<br/>
point on this list many times.  I think this paragraph is a keeper.<br/>
