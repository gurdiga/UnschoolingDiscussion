<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352120982">I think it would help to hear my thoughts<br/>
and try to understand where I am coming<br/>
from regarding the recent drug issue going<br/>
around on this list.<br/>
<br/>
On the issue of Marc taking his nephews out<br/>
camping. Great for you. We do alot of family <br/>
outtings from ice fishing to metal detecting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, we own a TV in fact 3 of them and we watch<br/>
them all in fact we pay for cable. I consider my <br/>
VCR and TV great teaching tools. When 9-11 happened<br/>
the news kept me abreast of everything that was happening.<br/>
And also for the memorial ceremony, my son and I watched<br/>
that too.<br/>
<br/>
My brother who died at age 40, suffered from a mental condition.<br/>
My father thought he could fix it all by telling my brother that if<br/>
he would just get off the medication, life for him would be better.<br/>
There were times my brother actually couldn&#39;t stand the tension<br/>
and went cold turkey off the medication. (never diagnosed until 25 years old)<br/>
In fact it got to the point that my brother rarely came home, and<br/>
I and my mother suffered for what my father couldn&#39;t understand nor<br/>
tolerate the medications side effects.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 12, and I fought battle after battle for my son in the public<br/>
school system. I knew something was wrong, but felt that if I brought<br/>
him home and homeschooled him I could prove them wrong. For a long<br/>
time things went very well for him, close friends even noticed the difference<br/>
in him. I was reaping the rewards of homeschooling to no end. <br/>
Then there was a change, and the change in him told me he was suffering<br/>
and needed help. Thank God that the doctor listened to me, and my input. He<br/>
put my son on the medication I was most comfortable with, and would<br/>
have prescribed myself. I still applaud homeschooling for I am really a great<br/>
teacher with a great student.<br/>
<br/>
So, long story short is I do know what withdrawls are, and I also do my <br/>
homework<br/>
on every medication my family is on. <br/>
<br/>
Dear Unschooling group. this was hard to write and stirred up emotions for <br/>
me.<br/>
Please understand my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>

this paragraph. I could have written this one myself concerning my son, <br/>
Conor.<br/>
<br/>
School was a constant battle for him (and me) and unschooling has blessed <br/>
our lives in so many ways. When he came home at 9 years old he just relaxed <br/>
and blossomed. Even still, he has also suffered with clinical depression and <br/>
is currently on medication. We have been able to reduce the dosage, but not <br/>
stop it entirely. Conor has been a part of the decision each and every step <br/>
of the way. I fought the idea of medication for a long time. In retrospect, <br/>
I think my stubborn refusal to consider such a thing actually forced Conor <br/>
to suffer much too long.<br/>
<br/>
I would never medicate a child, or anyone for that matter, on a whim. I <br/>
firmly believe schools should have NO part whatsoever in recommending a <br/>
&quot;diagnosis&quot; or medication for what they consider a problem child. I do, <br/>
however, have first hand experience with a child who truly needed medical <br/>
intervention to function in his real, everday, unschooling life. For us, <br/>
medication has allowed that unschooling life to continue to unfold and <br/>
blossom.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thank you for sharing. We all want to do what is best for our children. <br/>
Some decisions are harder to make than others.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
I would request medication for a child too, myself, if circumstances dictated <br/>
it within an unschooling lifestyle.  I would unschool first, if the problem <br/>
seemed to be school-related or school-induced or agravated. <br/>
<br/>
But sometimes teachers do see problems in kids that parents don&#39;t see, <br/>
because they see lots of kids and some parents hardly see their own.  And if <br/>
they do see their own they don&#39;t know what the range of behavior is.   <br/>
<br/>
Without a range for comparison, some parents assume their kid is normal-range <br/>
when he&#39;s not.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s one reason some dads are too demanding academically, because <br/>
they don&#39;t see how other kids their child&#39;s age are doing, what their levels <br/>
of understanding are, and what their personal interests are, so they look at <br/>
their one child and expect behavior, knowledge and attention span beyond his <br/>
years.<br/>
