&lt;&lt; A long time ago (1980&#39;s) Tom Cruise was in the movie &quot;Legend&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s a fairy-tale type movie with unicorns and magic and Tim Curry as<br/>
&quot;satan&quot;. It got some bad reviews but I remember really liking it! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember wishing Tom Cruise would move the greasy hair out of his eyes. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;d like it if I saw it again. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have any idea who he was at the time, and went to see Tim Curry <br/>
(whose part wasn&#39;t too long).  I thought &quot;Who&#39;s this <br/>
mentally-deficient-looking kid with the long hair?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noted all these suggestions on my &quot;rent these movies&quot; list, though, and <br/>
thanks!<br/>

You might want to check it out. You can read reviews for it at amazon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, I do remember that greasy hair look he had in that movie.<br/>
He was so young back then - you can really tell in the movie.<br/>
I&#39;m a sucker for all those old low-tech fantasy-type movies.<br/>
I loved &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;, too, as well as &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;.<br/>
I can watch those over and over for some reason - I always do when I run<br/>
across them on TV.<br/>
Oldies but goodies. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I finally saw that the other night, or at least most of it.<br/>
I didn&#39;t know what we were watching but I recognized a MUCH younger Tom <br/>
Cruise.<br/>
I can see why it got bad reviews, it rambled on too much, not a very clear <br/>
plot.<br/>
But it was very fun to watch anyway....and the Satan guy was cool.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
