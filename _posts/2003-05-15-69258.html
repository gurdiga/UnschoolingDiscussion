<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448137991">I emailed this an hour ago and it didn&#39;t show up, if it does twice, <br/>
my apologies.......posting on the website this time......<br/>
<br/>
Quoting something Sandra said, about how she helps families. The <br/>
shift going on in our family is really powerful. My 10yo Megan and I <br/>
have had some really cool discussions lately. My mom loved me, but <br/>
was never there for me in this capacity. I am so thankful for these <br/>
conversations between my daughter and me. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of good ones in the car on the way somewhere, she has said she <br/>
wishes we could spend all the time in the car because we get along <br/>
best and talk so much. Some good ones have been coming at the end of <br/>
an argument that would usually not stop like this before. In other <br/>
words, I would stew for a long period of time and not be able to let <br/>
go of my anger, and the opportunities for talking it out never <br/>
happened. I still struggle with this. It&#39;s hard to stop focusing on <br/>
my own feelings to be there and listen and talk with my daughter. <br/>
It&#39;s changing, though.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking today after she said something that hurt my feelings <br/>
and I got really mad and defensive. She said she hadn&#39;t meant it. I <br/>
told her of course she meant it, and she said NO. She said &quot;my mouth <br/>
is an early riser and my mind sometimes sleeps in.&quot; She said why is <br/>
it that I(mom) could do something or say something and apologize and <br/>
get forgiveness, but she couldn&#39;t? It froze me in my tracks. She is <br/>
so right about so many things, it just floors me. I have had to <br/>
humble myself to her more than once when she sees me being a <br/>
hypocrite.<br/>
<br/>
We were also talking about she gets upset and starts feeling like she <br/>
is always wrong and doesn&#39;t do anything right. She always thinks I am <br/>
right about everything and loves to prove me wrong. I told her I&#39;m <br/>
not and she has, and it makes us closer, if we&#39;re honest. <br/>
<br/>
She said she wants to be an adult, and know everything. I told her I <br/>
don&#39;t know everything, I make big mistakes (the whole school portion <br/>
of her life), and I think it&#39;s more important to learn about what <br/>
thrills her and know how to find the answer to anything else, and how <br/>
to learn from mistakes and not pretend to know everything and always <br/>
be right. <br/>
<br/>
We talked about how lots of kids want to be grown up, because it <br/>
would mean they have some control of their life. Instead, they exert <br/>
their power on other kids to try to feel like they are in control. <br/>
She is very familiar with that. And we were able to say that she is <br/>
as close to being in contol of her life as possible, as close to <br/>
being a grown up, without the worries and fears that children don&#39;t <br/>
realize adults have. By being unschooled and living and learning and <br/>
sleeping and eating all by her own choosing. Mom still needing to let <br/>
go even more, but a long way we&#39;ve come.<br/>
<br/>
She said she wishes I would never say &quot;no&quot;, but knows that isn&#39;t <br/>
realistic. I say &quot;no&quot; a lot less than I used to, because I am not <br/>
trying to control her as much. I try to say &quot;yes&quot; more and more, <br/>
which is the opposite of the way I used to be. I used to be <br/>
controlling and punitive all the time, demanding to know who she <br/>
thinks she is (caught myself saying it again the other day-- i hate <br/>
that), how dare she try to be an equal to her father and I, she <br/>
should know her place, blah blah blah. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t like that so much anymore. I now know she is practicing for <br/>
the time when she is on her own. She needs not do as I say, not as I <br/>
do. I am modelling behavior for my kids, and never quite realized the <br/>
impact before. <br/>
<br/>
While I wish I didn&#39;t have to come from negativity on our journey to <br/>
peace, it is amazing the DUH moments that I get along the way. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everyone involved in my unschooling journey, helping heal <br/>
years of negativity and celebrating peace. <br/>
