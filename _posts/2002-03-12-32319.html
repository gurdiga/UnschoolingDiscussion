<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595612428">BOOK COVER ILLUSTRATION CONTEST FOR HOMESCHOOLERS!<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers ages 1-16 are invited to submit illustrations to appear <br/>
on the cover of the forthcoming book:<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling and the Voyage of Self-Discovery: A Journey of Original <br/>
Seeking, by David H. Albert<br/>
<br/>
To be published by Common Courage Press in 2002.<br/>
<br/>
Submissions should be in full color, in any medium, prepared in an <br/>
8.5&quot; by 11&quot; format (regular sheet of paper) or equivalent.<br/>
<br/>
Required elements: the illustration should have a boat or ship in it. <br/>
There can be either a single child, child and parent, or multiple <br/>
children in the illustration, which must convey the idea of a voyage. <br/>
If there are multiple children, please let them reflect the rainbow <br/>
colors of children on our planet. The rest is up to your imagination!<br/>
<br/>
The winner will receive $100, and, if they choose, have their photos <br/>
as the cover artist and a 3-4 line biography appear inside the book.<br/>
<br/>

Contest, Common Courage Press, P.O. Box 702, Monroe, ME 04951. <br/>
