<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386603287">Here is a copy of my response to the Stillwater Gazette:<br/>
I would like to respond to the comic last Thursday in the Stillwater Gazette. <br/>
 The comic portrays the ignorance of it&#39;s creator.  This is not at all what <br/>
homeschooling is like.  Many people have homeschooled for years.  We do not <br/>
homeschool in response to the latest violent episodes in our school systems.  <br/>
The media seems to enjoy linking the two.  I suggest you send a reporter to <br/>
find out who homeschools, why and how they accomplish this instead of <br/>
stereotyping us.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
