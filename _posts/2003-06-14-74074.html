<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495663670">I just have to say....for all the time I spent &quot;getting to&quot; unschooling was worth it, the best part was when I actually just did it (fears and all).  Only THEN is when you actually get the confidence to continue.  I was lucky that I had one child who had never been formally schooled.  She was my example and my inspiration to let the other two alone.<br/>
<br/>
The change is absolutely amazing...and its not just a change in perception on my part because I&#39;ve changed some of my expectations.  The kids are really changing &quot;who they are&quot;.  They are taking active interests in things of their own choosing.  They are becoming such responsible young adults (well except for some of the usual immature friend stuff I&#39;ve already posted about).<br/>
<br/>
I could see the difference today when we went to a restaurant with two other kids.  The owner made it pretty clear that she saw a difference without actually saying so.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I started giving them an allowance each week.  There are no real strings attatched other than it would be nice if they would help me out with stuff...no requirements, just a general request.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am now giving them each an allowance, I do not have extra money to &quot;stretch&quot; to buy &quot;extra&quot; stuff for them.  That is what the allowance is for. And I am VERY happy to say that they are MUCH more content with generic stuff now that it is *their* money they are spending :o).  <br/>
<br/>
We no longer have to go the mall, the Dollar Store will do just fine.  My daughter just bought a pair of sandals at the Dollar STore today.  No more &quot;pigging out&quot; at a restaurant when we could have eaten lunch at home.  &quot;Just ice cream&quot; is enough so they have their money for other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
They just seem so much more content in general (except where the friend issues are concerned, but I&#39;m expecting that to improve in the next few weeks as we get more involved in other things).<br/>
<br/>
And this week was such a treat for me.  NO SPORTS!  I was able to just relax, go for evening walks with my dog, and sit at the pool or swim if I wanted to.  No rushing around.  It was *almost* a vacation!<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyway...Just wanted to share :O).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442079331">Listening to David Whyte - he makes the point that waiting for life to line up and fears to disappear means we get stuck.  Life must be lived without the contingencies.  Without waiting - I just quit a 7 year career working in business and technology.  Values conflict got to me.  Now I;m at a library helping my boss de-school 65 staff.  Now that&#39;s fun!<br/>
<br/>
Good for you jumping in, fear and all.  Fun like whitewater rafting and elevates you to the next &quot;place&quot; to boot!<br/>
