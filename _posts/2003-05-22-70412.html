<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203653320">Ok all, I need to ask if any of you can help me.<br/>
<br/>
I have TERRIBLE back pain (upper back and neck).  I&#39;ve had this for years, but its so much worse this week.<br/>
<br/>
I also at times have joint pain *everywhere*, in *every* joint possible.  During those times, I also have nausea, etc that feels like when I had mono.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had tests done...zip.  Nobody knows whats going on.  Some of it is arthritis I think, some of it is peripheral nerve root compression in my neck (the headaches are only on one side).<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t take this anymore.  Its to the point where I can&#39;t be up and around longer than 4 hours before I have to lay down or I get an incapacitating headache just from holding my head up.<br/>
<br/>
I used to just take 800 motrin at night.  Now i have to take it all the time just to get any relief at all, and even that isn&#39;t much.  The few times I&#39;ve taken percocet for other things (after a tooth was pulled, etc) it was the *only* time in about 20 years that I&#39;ve had NO pain and what a joy that was.  But I don&#39;t dare take percocet all the time...its a narcotic and addictive.  Is there anything I can take that will relieve this pain that is not addictive?  Any herbal remedies?<br/>
<br/>
I need exercises to strengthen my back, especially the rhomboid muscles on either side of the spinal column.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help me.  I&#39;m really worried that if I don&#39;t find some kind of exercise I can actually do, that I will end up in a wheelchair in another 10 years.  I can swim, and will be starting water aerobics in a couple of weeks, but is there anything else I can do specifically for my back?<br/>
<br/>
I tried lifting weight and that seems to have made it worse.  Even walking seems like something I can&#39;t do consistantly.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for anything you can share that might help!<br/>

<br/>
Have you tried yoga?<br/>
<br/>
It is a life saver for me,  I have fibromyalgia and used to be on all sorts of drugs.   Started up yoga and my life changed,  truly.   You can do little bits,  little stretches and then do more as you get more flexible.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do it as much as I should,  but I feel so much better with even the little bit that I do.<br/>
<br/>
If you need any more info you can e-mail me off list.<br/>

It sounds a bit like fibromyalgia.  Not that that helps, as there&#39;s really<br/>
no treatment.  But a diagnosis sure makes it easier to start tracking down<br/>
the things that might work.  Try googling fibromyalgia and look for a chart<br/>
of the tender points.  You can check yourself with that.  At least you&#39;d<br/>
know.  Beyond that I have no ideas, just a big hug.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721572591">Hi Kristen - I have fibromyalgia (which you may want to look into).  There<br/>
were a couple of years where I took percocet regularly.  It&#39;s true that your<br/>
body becomes physically dependent, but that is different from becoming<br/>
addicted.  I didn&#39;t feel any of the narcotic affects, because if your body<br/>
actually uses the percocet to deal with pain you don&#39;t get the same &#39;high&#39; a<br/>
person who is not in pain would.  As a last resort, it can be workable<br/>
solution.  It did take quite a while to wean off of them, though.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I&#39;m able to get by on ultram, which does not have the same<br/>
dependency or liver issues as percocet.  There are lots of levels of pain<br/>
relievers in between motrin and percocet that you could look into.  One<br/>
thing my dr. recommended that does the trick sometimes (though not often<br/>
:0( ) is a combination of motrin and tylenol.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to treating the pain I&#39;d say it&#39;s important to find out what is<br/>
going on with your body that is causing the pain.  I know how frustrating<br/>
that process can be, but it&#39;s worth doing.  I&#39;ve gone from being bedridden<br/>
to living a relatively normal life in the past two years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re hurting! ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
I would suggest yoga or Pilates, both rather gentle forms of stretching.  <br/>
Also, the YMCA in conjunction with the Arthritis Foundation has a program of <br/>
stretches and exercises that can be done in a warm water pool that might help.  <br/>
You might try Googling AFYAP.  Or contact your local YMCA.  You could run these <br/>
ideas by your doctor to see if he/she feels these suggestions would be helpful <br/>
or at least not harmful.  Hope you&#39;re able to get some relief soon.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37306837">Hi Kristen<br/>
<br/>
Your symptoms sounds almost identical to mine.  I thought I had fibromylagia<br/>
and then learned that gout is often misdiagnosed as this.  Gout is caused by<br/>
high uric acid and I found out this was my problem when I had to pass<br/>
several kidney stones.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to have this checked out by a doctor, a urine test is an easy<br/>
one and would help in narrowing down the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have a loss of the cervical curve in my neck and it causes a lot of pain<br/>
in my upper back.  I&#39;ve learned to do regular loosening and strengthening<br/>
exercises for the muscles there.  I also take regular breaks to relax the<br/>
area, sitting or laying down with neck support.  I am able to get a lot more<br/>
done this way, with a few minutes of rest I&#39;m good to go for a little while<br/>
longer.<br/>

<br/>
I might try massage.  And I will definitely look into yoga.  I used to do Choi Kwang do (a variatino of TKD).  I never felt better than that year when I did that, but I just have no time right now to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I also take anti-histamines to help me sleep sometimes, but not every night bec. the hangover seems cumulative LOL. <br/>
<br/>
I think I will go see the doc, and see a rheumatologist so I can get some general advice on it.<br/>

It isn&#39;t true that you have to commit to going forever, though you do have to go consistently for a while for it to work.  As for the Uric Acid, if you reduce the amount of protein, especially animal protein, that you eat, you will greatly affect your UricAcid level. Have you ever tried alternative Dr.s?  Good luck, whatever you do.<br/>

  I had terrible chronic back pain until finally going to a chiropractor.  It isn&#39;t true that you have to commit to going forever, though you do have to go consistently for a while for it to work.  As for the Uric Acid, if you reduce the amount of protein, especially animal protein, that you eat, you will greatly affect your UricAcid level. Have you ever tried alternative Dr.s?  Good luck, whatever you do.<br/>

<br/>
  I have TERRIBLE back pain (upper back and neck).  I&#39;ve had this for years, but its so much worse this week.<br/>
<br/>
  I also at times have joint pain *everywhere*, in *every* joint possible.  During those times, I also have nausea, etc that feels like when I had mono.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve had tests done...zip.  Nobody knows whats going on.  Some of it is arthritis I think, some of it is peripheral nerve root compression in my neck (the headaches are only on one side).<br/>
<br/>
  I can&#39;t take this anymore.  Its to the point where I can&#39;t be up and around longer than 4 hours before I have to lay down or I get an incapacitating headache just from holding my head up.<br/>
<br/>
  I used to just take 800 motrin at night.  Now i have to take it all the time just to get any relief at all, and even that isn&#39;t much.  The few times I&#39;ve taken percocet for other things (after a tooth was pulled, etc) it was the *only* time in about 20 years that I&#39;ve had NO pain and what a joy that was.  But I don&#39;t dare take percocet all the time...its a narcotic and addictive.  Is there anything I can take that will relieve this pain that is not addictive?  Any herbal remedies?<br/>
<br/>
  I need exercises to strengthen my back, especially the rhomboid muscles on either side of the spinal column.<br/>
<br/>
  Can anyone help me.  I&#39;m really worried that if I don&#39;t find some kind of exercise I can actually do, that I will end up in a wheelchair in another 10 years.  I can swim, and will be starting water aerobics in a couple of weeks, but is there anything else I can do specifically for my back?<br/>
<br/>
  I tried lifting weight and that seems to have made it worse.  Even walking seems like something I can&#39;t do consistantly.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for anything you can share that might help!<br/>

I have a couple suggestions. First is Colostrum. It is actually bovine<br/>
colostrum.  You can get it at a health food store. My mom has fybromyalgia<br/>
 I realize that may not be what you have) and it has helped her regain her<br/>
quality of life. I always recommend that you do your own research though<br/>
before you try something. Second is to see a Chiropractor. I used to be a<br/>
skeptic but I am now a firm believer in it.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you are having trouble with joint pain, you may want to work on the<br/>
acidity level of your body. Research this.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. Sorry that you are in so much pain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483704437">Hi Tia - I was diagnosed 13 years ago, but have had symptoms all of my life.<br/>
For a while it wasn&#39;t so bad, but about 6 years ago it got to the point<br/>
where I really couldn&#39;t do much of anything because of the insomnia, the<br/>
fatigue, and the pain.  I had poor word recall, missed my mouth, dropped<br/>
things, and had days of brainfog that left me exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
I often felt like just giving up and accepting that this was my life, so why<br/>
bother to keep trying new medications and therapies?  Luckily, Jon wouldn&#39;t<br/>
let me :0).  He pushed me to see different doctors, and to try whatever was<br/>
suggested.  It was a very frustrating process (as I&#39;m sure you know), but<br/>
worth it in the end.  Two years ago my dr. noticed that a patient who had<br/>
fibro and asthma was feeling better after taking Singulair (an asthma med).<br/>
She put me on it and after about a month I was feeling like I had a new<br/>
body.  Able to get around, do gardening, walk around for an hour or two,<br/>
knit, and sleep much more regularly.  As time has passed the effects aren&#39;t<br/>
as great, but are still pretty good.  I have to sit for a bit every few<br/>
hours, but in between I can be active without feeling exhausted and without<br/>
debilitating pain.  I do have kind of a background hum of pain, but Ultram<br/>
is enough to get me by.  If I stay aware of my body I can head off any<br/>
serious pain before it happens just by resting for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Once I started feeling better I was able to start looking for patterns.<br/>
While I was in pain it was too much to try to think about, and the brainfog<br/>
was making me pretty useless.  I noticed that I was a little worse about 8<br/>
days after my period, and the week before it began I was MUCH worse.  I&#39;ve<br/>
just completed a hormone test, and am waiting on the results.  There&#39;s a<br/>
very good chance that I have Ehlers-Daniels, which is a ligament laxity<br/>
condition.  Some studies are showing a correlation between ED and FMS, and<br/>
the hormone changes that occur on day 8 and 21-28 can cause problems with<br/>
ligaments.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t recommend the Singulair highly enough.  The difference it has made<br/>
for me is really unbelievable.  I&#39;d say fatigue is my third most prominent<br/>
symptom (pain and insomnia win), and it has improved dramatically.  It took<br/>
11 years to find something that worked at all.  I truly didn&#39;t want to try<br/>
anymore, and I&#39;m so grateful that Jon made sure that I did.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I rambled a bit here - hope any of it helps you.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590822159">Now this is very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I have long believed that whatever I have is an &quot;auto-immune&quot; problem.  There is no other explanation for it.  And it occurred to me recently that people take antihistamines for allergies.<br/>
<br/>
So, I started taking antihistamines at night to help me sleep.  It works pretty well, even relieves my pain.  I suspect if I took them all day I&#39;d feel better, but I&#39;d be too hung over to enjoy the pain relief!<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that my ligaments in my neck have been stretched (I used to crack my own neck).  THere is probably very little ligamental support to start with.  And guess what, I&#39;m on day 13 or so.  The worst of this has been the past week.<br/>
<br/>
You could have something there.  Should I see a rheumatologist?   I wonder if they&#39;d know about the Singulair connection.<br/>

  symptom (pain and insomnia win), and it has improved dramatically.  It took<br/>
  11 years to find something that worked at all.  I truly didn&#39;t want to try<br/>
  anymore, and I&#39;m so grateful that Jon made sure that I did.<br/>
<br/>
  I feel like I rambled a bit here - hope any of it helps you.  ~Rue<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;Rue, do you feel like describing what you did to find out what was going<br/>
  on<br/>
  with your body?  I&#39;ve gotten to a place I can stand with my fibro, but I<br/>
  still don&#39;t like it much.  I&#39;m one of the ones who has fatigue as the main<br/>
  symptom, and it&#39;s really limiting.  (I can work in the garden or do<br/>
  housework for maybe 30 minutes, tops.  On a good day I *might* be able to do<br/>
  that twice.  I don&#39;t have a lot of pain, though there&#39;s always some.  And<br/>
  once I get tired, the brain fog kicks in something fierce.  So I&#39;m curious<br/>
  what you&#39;ve done to turn things around.<br/>
  Tia<br/>

I came across this site, looked at it and remembered reading your email. I<br/>
don&#39;t know if this will help you or not, but it is worth a shot.  I know<br/>

Ok all, I need to ask if any of you can help me.<br/>
<br/>
I have TERRIBLE back pain (upper back and neck).  I&#39;ve had this for years,<br/>
but its so much worse this week.<br/>
*snip*<br/>
I can&#39;t take this anymore.  Its to the point where I can&#39;t be up and around<br/>
longer than 4 hours before I have to lay down or I get an incapacitating<br/>
headache just from holding my head up.<br/>
*snip*<br/>
Is there anything I can take that will relieve this pain that is not<br/>
addictive?  Any herbal remedies?<br/>
*snip*<br/>
Can anyone help me.  I&#39;m really worried that if I don&#39;t find some kind of<br/>
exercise I can actually do, that I will end up in a wheelchair in another 10<br/>
years. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My pain sounds much like yours too...I get mine *usually* once per month, <br/>
right at my period time, right in my neck and at the base of my skull.  It used <br/>
to be so bad I&#39;d puke, and the pain would last for a week.  For at least one <br/>
week per month I&#39;d be completely out of it...couldn&#39;t think, couldn barely move, <br/>
was cranky and grouchy...couldn&#39;t sleep well.  No over the counter remedies <br/>
worked.  I started taking Naproxen (had to get it from the doctor, it&#39;s <br/>
actually an arthritis medicine) and it has made life bearable.<br/>
<br/>
I also have to echo the suggestions of YOGA...If you are able to take a few <br/>
classes to get the basics down, you can probably continue doing yoga with <br/>
tapes...there&#39;s a company called &quot;Gaiam&quot; that puts out some wonderful, very <br/>
peaceful tapes...I really like Rodney Yee&#39;s instruction.  Check out what your library <br/>
has, but don&#39;t get something really old.<br/>
<br/>
The last thing that helped me was changing my diet...reducing packaged food, <br/>
sugars, etc.  Sort of a modified low carb/high protein diet.  Take vitamins.  <br/>
<br/>
I know this may be suggestion overload, but have you ever read anything by <br/>
Andrew Weil?  He has a wonderful book called &#39;8 Weeks To Optimum Health.&quot;  It <br/>
takes step by step, over 8 weeks, through many changes that will improve your <br/>
health and the way you feel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308138205">Someone else that knows about Colostrum!  Isn&#39;t it great?  My kids take it every day and have not been sick (except for one cold) for a year.  I also found that cutting down on acid intake through diet helped me in many ways.  I haven&#39;t cut out meat, didn&#39;t mean you should cut it out.  My MIL is a very successful naturopath and talks a lot about high protein diets (including high dairy) causing too much uric acid.   There are homeopathic drops that help lower uric acid (rheumatic pain drops) that she has everyone who talks to her take every morning.  The best would be to talk to an alternative Dr. and tell them all your symptoms, if you are open to that.  <br/>

I have a couple suggestions. First is Colostrum. It is actually bovine<br/>
colostrum.  Also if you are having trouble with joint pain, you may want to work on the<br/>
acidity level of your body. Research this.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674700601">I would try to find a good chiropractor and a good alternative <br/>
doctor.  I know several people, including myself, who have found good <br/>
alternative doctors in their area under the heading of D.O. (Doctor <br/>
of osteopathy) who specialize in alternative methods, such as <br/>
naturopathy.  I found a very gentle chiropractor who uses a lot of <br/>
accupressure in his treatments and a D.O. in my search for an <br/>
alternative way to deal with my thyroid issues, which included a lot <br/>
of back pain, because my adrenal glands were completely out of <br/>
whack.  (Apparently, if your adrenals aren&#39;t functioning properly you <br/>
can have alot of lower back pain and headaches).  I also read <br/>
somewhere that thyroid disease is very common and can even be a <br/>
misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia.  My problem was that my adrenal glands <br/>
had been working so hard to keep up with the high sugar/carb. diet I <br/>
was on, that eventually my thyroid had to start helping out and then <br/>
everything seemed like it fell apart.  Anyway, I think if you found a <br/>
good doctor with an alternative mindset, he/she would be more <br/>
interested in getting your whole body back to proper functioning, <br/>
rather than just covering up your symptoms with a prescription.  <br/>
Good luck, <br/>

When I used to get weird skin rashes when I was younger (from four into my <br/>
20&#39;s), it truly seemed that I was allergic to my own perspiration, and I would <br/>
break out in the bends of my arms and legs.  I had been told this and that <br/>
about what caused or would prevent it, but nothing made a difference, and for a <br/>
while I tried to track what I was wearing and what time of year, but it would <br/>
happen in winter AND summer, and I finally figured out that sweating (in winter, <br/>
like playing hard in the snow all dressed up, or summer NOT wearing something <br/>
to absorb the sweat) was the only consistent factor.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re allergic to yourself (on the outside, not in the blood) maybe <br/>
that&#39;s a combo auto-immune and allergy. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
