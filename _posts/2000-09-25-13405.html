I keep hearing about this book as being a must-read, even from a non-h/s
friend.&nbsp; Thanks for the encouragement.&nbsp; The more I look at ps
the more I hate what I see.....still, I&#39;m so stuck on the academic track
I followed so well.&nbsp; It&#39;s going to take time for me to loosen up.

<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time everyday where you read books aloud to them.......</i>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; We have always done the family reading
time, so it&#39;s a natural for us.&nbsp; It&#39;s the nitty-gritty that makes
me nervous.&nbsp; Will they ever learn the parts of speech if I don&#39;t teach
them to diagram sentences?&nbsp; Beyond multiplication and division, will
they ever learn fractions (least common denominators, greatest common factors,etc.)
and decimals (aside from money), to say nothing of algebra, geometry or
trigonometry?&nbsp; I realize that I must sound like an advertisement for
your local ps district; I&#39;m just trying to come to terms with this.&nbsp;
Thanks for your help and support.

 </span></blockquote>Do you use these things in real life? If so, your kids will probably learn <br/>
them. If not, will your children become interested in something that involves <br/>
these things?<br/>
<br/>
As far as parts of speech and diagramming sentences I personally can&#39;t <br/>
imagine EVER using these things, but I suppose someone does.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids decide to go into some technical field, they will be motivated <br/>
to learn higher maths (like my dh did), but if they have NO interest in those <br/>
things, they are unlikely to be interested in something that would require <br/>
them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ruth, one answer to your questions is another question.  Will they <br/>
need to know it or be interested in it?  If the answer is yes, they&#39;ll <br/>
learn it.  If not, it doesn&#39;t matter.  Many people can give you <br/>
examples of creative people, engineers, architects who have to use <br/>
calculators and spellcheckers to work, and have their reports <br/>
edited by staff or family before they use them.  And why not?  Must <br/>
have been awful before these things were invented...<br/>
<br/>
This is the idea I&#39;m trying to follow with mine.  Atm, I&#39;m being fairly <br/>
successful on the academic side of this, but not on other, more <br/>
vital sides, like will she stop acting like any boy who&#39;s running is <br/>
chasing her?  Mine are younger, and have only been to &#39;preschool&#39; <br/>
for a little while.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still deschooling, to some degree, still trying to shake off the <br/>
shackles of upbringing and schooling.  It takes time, and it makes <br/>
sense to give oneself that time, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll know yourself better, <br/>
if nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes<br/>

more than basic math on the job. Want to get them using more than basic math in 
real life? Get them involved in woodworking, sailing (navigation), sewing. You&#39;d 
be surprised at how much math can be involved in calculating a compound miter 
joint for a picture frame! There are also lots of math materials that show how 
interesting and useful math can be, unlike the typical textbook.</span></div>
