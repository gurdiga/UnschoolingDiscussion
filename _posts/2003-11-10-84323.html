<div id="ygrps-yiv-777373900">Okay, but isn&#39;t it true that as adults, we have to work in order to achieve <br/>
material rewards? Any material reward is, after all, the fruit of <br/>
previously-done labor. You have to do the work (even if it&#39;s brain-work <br/>
rather than physical work, or the foregoing of consumption in the present <br/>
so you can apply capital to create more wealth in the future) before the <br/>
reward even exists -- or else you are enjoying the fruits of someone else&#39;s <br/>
labor (or sacrifice).<br/>
Otherwise it seems we are teaching that manna falls from heaven and the <br/>
world owes us a living.<br/>

       Someone asked about how to make a chores chart on our local hs list <br/>
last week. It started a similar discussion to this one, complete with Alfie <br/>
Kohn, unschooling and unchores Here is part of how I answered a post like Scott&#39;s:<br/>
<br/>
              If the main need is for a clean house and/or parental survival, <br/>
that&#39;s one thing, and have at it with my blessing &lt;g&gt;. I am not the FlyLady <br/>
and far be it from me to give cleaning advice. Do what you need to do, and <br/>
maybe a chore list will help you keep the dirt and clutter at bay, keep the family <br/>
functioning. I expect they had many lists in the Cheaper By The Dozen <br/>
household (actually, in real-life, Frank Gilbreth was an efficiency expert forever <br/>
experimenting on his own children, testing theories of factory productivity. The <br/>
kids seem to have turned out okay, but he had an early heart attack and died, <br/>
leaving them fatherless. Not very efficient in the long run imo.)<br/>
<br/>
       Just don&#39;t say it&#39;s all for the child&#39;s benefit, so they will be <br/>
moral, hygenic and mannerly dirt-haters, or obedient and God-fearing, or whatever. <br/>
Those are very different goals that a chore list may not serve very well, imo.<br/>
<br/>
       All I mean is that I find parenting and learning are so often <br/>
counterintuitive. How did I help my children not fear the dark of their rooms at <br/>
night? By keeping it light and letting them feel safe rather than afraid, on their <br/>
timetable instead of mine. How did I equip them to trust others to hold them? <br/>
By holding them close as much as they wanted, staying with them and not <br/>
forcing them on strangers. How do you get a child to share? What worked for us was <br/>
making sure there was plenty of everything to go around so no one grew up <br/>
feeling deprived or defensive or under attack. We let them feel empowered and <br/>
secure, never asked or expected them to share, and they now are generous kids. By <br/>
only doing it when they wanted to, it felt good and they really learned to like <br/>
it. . .<br/>
<br/>
       . . .We don&#39;t have to emulate schoolish survival tools if our <br/>
children&#39;s learning is all we are worried about. Those silly lists of what children <br/>
must be made to do, to learn all the things they must be made to learn -- if it <br/>
worked it would be one thing, but I an dubious. I&#39;d wager that about the same <br/>
percentage of children really &quot;get&quot; algebra today as ever did, or really love <br/>
to read, and no more. I hate worksheets and lists of things to learn or books <br/>
to read unless they are my own, for my own purposes. Then I love them and make <br/>
them endlessly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       It would be very logical (but apparently not true) to reason that if <br/>
you eventually want a grown man to pick up his own socks and dishes, then you <br/>
should make a chore chart for him as a five-year-old boy and get him in the <br/>
habit early. But does it actually work? What might work as well or better?<br/>
<br/>
       Personally, I think the real value of organizing or scheduling as a <br/>
tool is in teaching children to make the process their own and use it for their <br/>
own benefit. (Same with the value of the actual chores - otherwise it is <br/>
easier to do it myself.) Like a hammer or screwdriver, any tool can be used or <br/>
misused, and people can benefit, get hurt, or decide never touch it or anything <br/>
associated with it ever again!<br/>
<br/>
       Polishing silver, changing sheets and pillowcases, et cetera can be <br/>
fun and also satisfying, when we let children discover it for themselves. I used <br/>
to love to iron my father&#39;s shirts, but I didn&#39;t have to. I only did it when <br/>
it felt good, and the more I did it, the better I got at it, the better it <br/>
felt, and the more I did it! My mom of course was smart enough to milk it for all <br/>
it was worth! :)<br/>
<br/>
       All wasted of course -- we live in a no-iron world now and I haven&#39;t <br/>
ironed for my own family, ever! But things run reasonably well around here, <br/>
except when I spend too much time on the computer (we don&#39;t have lists and limits <br/>
for that either &lt;g&gt;) --  JJ</div>
