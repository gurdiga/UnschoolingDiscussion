Ugh is right. If they&#39;d said chores, I would have thought okayyy, I can <br/>
see that, but 3 subjects and chores?? Yeh, and I&#39;m thin, rich, and <br/>
typing right now. Well, one of three still counts, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
And I bet they bake cookies in order to learn fractions, too, instead <br/>
of just to have cookies to eat!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, Brandie.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t dismiss families just because they don&#39;t have a clear idea of what unschooling is.  We have met, and created some wonderful friendships, with several families here who either don&#39;t unschool or who say they do, but don&#39;t *really*, or who don&#39;t homeschool at all.  I am just expressing how much we wish we *could* find other unschoolers in our area.  <br/>

who don&#39;t claim to be unschoolers, than those who do<br/>

nature journals, and don&#39;t own a tv, and the parents<br/>
decide when the children will sleep and what will go<br/>

mean to my kids because &quot;Well, Janey doesn&#39;t like your<br/>
son because she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that he can<br/>
eat anything he wants to!&quot; or &quot;Time outs work great in<br/>
our house--have you considered using them?&quot; or &quot;Suzy<br/>
is bitter because she thinks that your daughter should<br/>
have math assingments, too&quot; (said in a voice like *I*<br/>
should feel bad about that and start controlliong my<br/>
kids....)  When we hang out with people who *don&#39;t*<br/>
claim to be unschoolers, they seem fine to accept that<br/>
our families are different, but when we hang out with<br/>
wanna-bes, they seem to expect me to act like they<br/>
do....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-813198212">As anybody who has read Holt knows, he changed his tune a lot over the <br/>
years. And &quot;unschooling&quot; was his word for not sending kids to school - <br/>
no matter what kind of schooling they might have been getting at home. <br/>
The meaning has changed, since then. Billy Geer, at FUNBooks, has a <br/>
nice little explanation of that development.<br/>
<br/>
These days, unschooling generaly simply means &quot;not schooling&quot; - it <br/>
means not imposing schooling on their kids - school-at-home or &quot;just <br/>
math&quot; or any other schooling.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to nitpick about how John Holt used a term - they need <br/>
to read what he said about the word, &quot;education.&quot; I&#39;m not saying they <br/>
need to stop using the word, just that they need to realize that how <br/>
John Holt happened to define something on any particular occasion might <br/>
be very interesting, but should not be considered the final say. Hence, <br/>
HEM, for example, felt free to name their magazine Home &quot;EDUCATION&quot; <br/>
Magazine, in spite of this definition of the word, education, by John <br/>
Holt.<br/>
<br/>
  John Holt wrote this about &quot;education&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I choose to define it here as most people do, something that some <br/>
people<br/>
do to others for their own good, molding and shaping them, and trying to<br/>
make them learn what they thing they ought to know. Today, everywhere in<br/>
the world, that is what &quot;education&quot; has become, and I am wholly against<br/>
it. People spend a great deal of time- as for years I did myself-<br/>
talking about how to make &quot;education&quot; more effective and efficient, or<br/>
how to do it or give it to more people, or how to reform or humanize it.<br/>
But to make it more effective and efficient will only be to make it<br/>
worse, and to help it do even more harm. It cannot be reformed, cannot<br/>
be carried out wisely or humanely, because its purpose is neither wise<br/>
nor humane. &quot;<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Brandie --<br/>
<br/>
I sympathize.  I moved two years ago and I&#39;m still &quot;settling in&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One of my best friends is planning to move to Knoxville, TN this <br/>
summer.  I know that&#39;s not really close to Bristol, but maybe I could <br/>
electronically introduce the two of you and you could pool your <br/>
resources in finding sympathetic people.  (Her 3 kids are 11.5 to 6.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to convince my friend to widen her acquaintence by coming to <br/>
the Live and Learn Conference this summer near St. Louis.  I should <br/>
disclose that she isn&#39;t a full-fledged unschooler, but I find she blends <br/>
well with unschoolers.  (She does very infrequent workbook lessons with <br/>
her kids, who like workbooks, and the rest of the time just lives an <br/>
interesting life.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted looking for unschoolers near me (Benicia, CA), and got two <br/>
friendly replies, but both from people that live about 40 miles away.  I <br/>
find I can socialize and have a pleasant time with non-unschooling moms <br/>
IF they are gentle, attachment parenting types.  As far as I can see, <br/>
kids who sometimes have to pick up toys or who must do piano practice, <br/>
still have a pretty high quality of life.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, if you want say kids for your kids to play Playstation with and you <br/>
want to weed out all the moms who disapprove of videogames, then forming <br/>
a videogaming group would do some of the selection work for you.  (Yes, <br/>
it sounds like I&#39;m stereotyping your kids based on their ages.)<br/>
<br/>
Are you already cruising the email lists in your state, looking for <br/>
prospects&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  My 3 relaxed-but-not-unschooling friends will be with me at the HSC <br/>
conference in Sacramento this August if anyone wants to eyeball them and <br/>
see whether or not they are nice to their kids. &lt;g&gt;</div>

  We are planning to move to Tennessee, hopefully by/in the fall. It is around the Nashville area though. I have noticed there isn&#39;t a TN unschoolers list for yahoo so I  will start one once we move if one hasn&#39;t been started by then.<br/>

  True learning- learning that is permanent and useful, that leads to intelligent action<br/>
  and further learning- can arise only out of the experience, interests and concerns of the learner.<br/>

From GWS #2 , Nov. 1978<br/>
<br/>
MIXED ALLIES<br/>
<br/>
Those who read GWS , and want to take or keep their children out of<br/>
schools, may have very different, in some cases opposed reasons for<br/>
doing this.<br/>
<br/>
Some may feel that the schools are too strict; others that they are<br/>
not strict enough.<br/>
<br/>
Some may feel that the schools spend too much time on what they call<br/>
the Basics; others that they don&#39;t spend enough.<br/>
<br/>
Some may feel that the schools teach a dog-eat-dog competitiveness;<br/>
others that they teach a mealy-mouth Socialism.<br/>
<br/>
Some may feel that the schools teach too much religion; others that<br/>
they don&#39;t teach enough, but teach instead a shallow atheistic<br/>
humanism. I think the schools degrade both science and religion, and<br/>
do not encourage either strong faith or strong critical thought.<br/>
<br/>
Some feel that the school curriculum is dull, fragmented, devoid of<br/>
context, in George Dennison&#39;s words, that it destroys &quot;the continuum<br/>
of experience.&quot; Others may feel that the school curriculum is fine,<br/>
but that they don&#39;t do a very good job of teaching it.<br/>
<br/>
What is important is not that all readers of GWS should agree on<br/>
these questions, but that we should respect our differences while we<br/>
work for what we agree on, our right and the right of all people to<br/>
take their children out of schools, and help, plan, or direct their<br/>
learning in the ways they think best.<br/>
<br/>
In all these matters, we at GWS have our own opinions, and will<br/>
express them. This is not going to try or pretend to be an unbiased<br/>
publication. We will be very biased. But we will try to be as useful<br/>
as possible to all our readers, whether or not we agree with them on<br/>
all details. And on the issue about which we are all agreed we will<br/>
print as wide a range of ideas and opinions as our readers send us.</div>

 <br/>
That would be secondary source.<br/>
 <br/>
Someone saying that on another list someone is discussing an idea based on  <br/>
something the author says someone else wrote or said is way beyond  tertiary <br/>
source.<br/>

 <br/>
Just because Holt felt GWS could be of use to &quot;allies&quot; didn&#39;t mean he  <br/>
thought all the readers were unschooling in ways he recommended in his  writings.<br/>
 <br/>
==========<br/>
 <br/>
[from the John Holt quote:]<br/>
-=-In all these matters, we at GWS have our own opinions, and  will<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
So he was saying that even though he as editor doesn&#39;t agree with all the  <br/>
readers, he&#39;s still willing to give them a forum.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m interested in what John Holt wrote about how children learn, not in the  <br/>
full range of what anyone ever thought the first year they tried homeschooling <br/>
 and wrote to GWS which let them express their opinions in the magazine for <br/>
the  benefit of other homeschoolers with whom John Holt didn&#39;t agree.<br/>

He recognizes that people reading GFS were not all homeschooling the <br/>

<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In all these matters, we at GWS have our own opinions, and will<br/>
&gt; express them.<br/>
<br/>
And he expressed, increasingly over the years, his opinion that imposed <br/>
schooling was not necessary and he increasingly, over the years, <br/>
supported what we NOW call unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is not going to try or pretend to be an unbiased<br/>
&gt; publication. We will be very biased. But we will try to be as useful<br/>
&gt; as possible to all our readers, whether or not we agree with them on<br/>
&gt; all details. And on the issue about which we are all agreed we will<br/>
&gt; print as wide a range of ideas and opinions as our readers send us.<br/>
<br/>
In SPITE of the fact that he was strongly biased toward what is now <br/>
known as &quot;radical unschooling&quot; - growing increasingly so as he began to <br/>
occasionally even address topics like bedtimes and all coercion of <br/>
children, etc., the magazine, GWS, was thought by him to be useful to <br/>
others and would print a range of ideas and opinions much WIDER than <br/>
those he, himself, held.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt would be thrilled with what unschooling has become. He didn&#39;t <br/>
live to see his ideas so exuberantly accepted and carried out by very <br/>
many real families, but if he had lived, he&#39;d have been at the <br/>
forefront, as he always was, of this movement - he&#39;d be traveling <br/>
around and visiting all of us and seeing what we&#39;re doing and writing <br/>
about it.  He didn&#39;t have the advantages that we all have - of the <br/>
internet and of day-to-day communication with MANY people who are <br/>
taking his ideas and implementing them in their very-real lives.<br/>
<br/>
He wouldn&#39;t expect us to stand still and not learn something from our <br/>
experiences, either. He certainly never stood still - his ideas <br/>
developed and changed and he became more and more radical. I wish he <br/>
was here - he&#39;d be an inspiration to us all and, what&#39;s more, we&#39;d be <br/>
inspirations to him.<br/>

You might want to try more patience and less &quot;ugh.&quot;<br/>
Winning more flies with honey and all that; your attitude and<br/>
experience might be the one that loosens these families.<br/>
:-)<br/>
There are a variety of definitions of unschooling (Holt&#39;s, for<br/>
example, in his advice to Nancy Wallace sounds much more like these<br/>
other families you are describing).  The HEM-Unschooling list (if<br/>
you&#39;re interested) is discussing this variety right now.<br/>
~Sue<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
  Mostly,the HEM-unschooling list spends its time discussing *this* <br/>
list, so I don&#39;t know that you would find much info there---or serious <br/>
unschooling discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Holt&#39;s writings in issue #2 of GWS are much more lenient and open than <br/>
in his later writings. He got much more radical in his thinking and <br/>
writing as the years went on.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Pam---that he would be proud of what we&#39;re promoting here <br/>
at U-D, A-L, u-b, shine, A-U and unschooling.info. Not to mention the <br/>
conference! &lt;g&gt; I think he&#39;d be delighted to know that a whole bunch of <br/>
unschoolers from all over the country (and Canada) get together once a <br/>
year to meet and play!<br/>

other term for refering to the philosophy that this list advocates. <br/>
If a family does not do school at home, but still has rules about <br/>
things like bedtime & chores, then the term unschooling still seems <br/>
to fit. (Going by how the word sounds) Then you have families who <br/>
apply the philosophy to all aspects of life and you can call them <br/>
unschoolers.  That is like calling every large woody plant around <br/>
your house a tree. It may be true but not very helpful if you are <br/>
trying to be specific.  Of course you could always use descriptive <br/>
words and explanations such as &quot;we live by principles not rules&quot; <br/>
or &quot;look for the tree with the deeply lobed leaves&quot;. But it is <br/>
helpful to have names like maple & oak.<br/>

bedtimes and rules can still be unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Truly we haven&#39;t claimed different here (except maybe Kelly &lt;BEG&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
But - what we do here is examine, analyze, discuss how what we learn <br/>
from unschooling leads to trust in other areas and how unschooling <br/>
works when its principles are extended to aspects of life not usually <br/>
considered part of &quot;schooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been referring to the &quot;extended unschooling&quot; ideas discussed here <br/>
as &quot;an unschooling lifestyle.&quot; Not the best, most clear, terminology, <br/>
but at least it points to unschooling ideas being extended to the <br/>
entire lifestyle of a family.<br/>

It seemed to me when I was first reading GWS (when Kirby was five I  <br/>
subscribed) and then later reading on *Prodigy and AOL that &quot;radical  unschooling&quot; <br/>
would have done it.  By &quot;radical unschooling&quot; I always thought  people meant <br/>
&quot;Really unschooling,&quot; unschooling completely, or unschooling  without reservations.<br/>

my last post.  I personally prefer the term NCP.  Firstly, because it <br/>

<br/>
that I&#39;m unaware of?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
I suppose.<br/>
Though I don&#39;t think there are &quot;communities&quot; in the sense that it&#39;s usually <br/>
meant.<br/>
<br/>
I think they spring from two different traditions that can&#39;t really meet up <br/>
very well.  What I&#39;ve seen of non rift is when a family really likes the NCP <br/>
philosophy and jumps straight to that, and it makes their unschooling easier.   <br/>
What I&#39;ve seen of rift is when TCS/NCP people criticize unschoolers for ANY <br/>
persuasion or inspiration (saying it&#39;s coercive) and criticize unschoolers for <br/>
sharing personal details of their children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
And from the unschooling point of view (online discussions over a dozen <br/>
years),  when someone says &quot;I believe this&quot; and another says &quot;How has it worked <br/>
out?&quot; and the answer is &quot;I&#39;m not going to tell you,&quot; it seems a waste of time to <br/>
discuss it much more.  But that, I think, is because many unschoolers came out <br/>
of La Leche League and other experience-sharing groups and mutual help groups <br/>
in which sharing was the core of the whole situation.<br/>
<br/>
So in a way, unschooling is more scientific because we will share evidence <br/>
freely back and forth and let other people unschoolers meet and talk with our <br/>
kids behind our backs (maybe not all unschoolers, but LOTS).   The very few <br/>
TCS/NCP people who will share ANYthing won&#39;t share real life stories.   Their take <br/>
seems to be that if the premise is sound that results aren&#39;t the point.  I <br/>
think (and could be wrong) that the premise takes great precedence over the <br/>
child&#39;s happiness and wellbeing, and it seems to me (personally) that NCP can be a <br/>
cop-out for parents who don&#39;t have much natural interpersonal skill, and so <br/>
they want a cool set of rules to fall back on (and to blame if the outcome <br/>
isn&#39;t ideal).<br/>
<br/>
For the unschoolers I&#39;ve liked and respected most, the outcome and the <br/>
process WERE important, and the methods were tweaked to get a better outcome (peace, <br/>
closeness, learning, joy).   <br/>
<br/>
At La Leche League meetings moms hear birth stories and see the babies and <br/>
know their names and watch other moms nurse babies and really learn from seeing <br/>
and knowing.  If the philosophy didn&#39;t work, they would see it right away, <br/>
clearly.   If unschooling didn&#39;t work, no one would come to it new, because they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t see any results to be aimed for or families to be emulated.<br/>
<br/>
Some people reconcile the two in their own minds, but I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
reconciliation of the methods of helping others understand and implement.<br/>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a rift, necessarily.  After all, unschoolers  aren&#39;t <br/>
some monolithic &quot;community&quot; to have a riff with.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t believe the two philosophies are incompatible with each  other.  I do <br/>
believe they are very different and very separate.  To  me, NCP/TCS puts the <br/>
child clearly at the center of the universe, AND creates a  vacuum around them <br/>
that implies their actions don&#39;t influence or harm or benefit  others.  <br/>
Unschooling embraces and encourages the interdependence and  mutuality of <br/>
relationship between parent and child.  An unschooling parent  wouldn&#39;t have any <br/>
problems with asking their child to conider the parent&#39;s  feelings, needs and <br/>
desires in the child&#39;s decisions.  In my experience  with NCP/TCS, the child can <br/>
flat out refuse to consider anyone else&#39;s feelings,  needs and desires, and the <br/>
parent would be philosophy-bound not to coerce them  in any way, regardless of <br/>
the direness of the situation. <br/>
 <br/>
The various applications of this philosophy that have been discussed in the  <br/>
10 years I&#39;ve been online were always in the hypothetical, with no real-life  <br/>
examples of win-win.  It&#39;s always a discussion of what &quot;might&quot; work or what  <br/>
&quot;could&quot; work, and unschoolers usually can point to something in their  <br/>
unschooling lives that &quot;has&quot; worked.  That&#39;s not a criticism of the  philosophy <br/>
itself, I suppose, but an example of how difficult it is to gain an  understanding <br/>
of the philosophy as compared to unschooling.  <br/>
 <br/>
Understanding NCP/TCS can helped me understand unschooling better.   It&#39;s can <br/>
be a subtle difference in any given situation, and so it&#39;s hard to  explain.  <br/>
I do carry with me a natural gut-check about coersion because of  those <br/>
discussions, but it always bumps up against my instincts for relationship,  <br/>
practicality and self-preservation.  <br/>
 <br/>
One of the greatest things I learned from the NCP/TCS discussions was the  <br/>
ideas about time coersion and money coersion.  I have a tendency to rush if  I&#39;m <br/>
late, to my detriment and that of my children.  Recognizing that it&#39;s  the <br/>
*time constraints* that is making me rush has helped me be more calm and  <br/>
peaceful with myself and my kids.  And my husband.  :)<br/>

I  <br/>
think (and could be wrong) that the premise takes great precedence over  the <br/>
child&#39;s happiness and wellbeing, and it seems to me (personally) that  NCP <br/>
can be a <br/>
cop-out for parents who don&#39;t have much natural interpersonal  skill, and so <br/>
they want a cool set of rules to fall back on (and to blame  if the outcome <br/>
isn&#39;t ideal).<br/>

Which is why *many* mainstream parenting philosophies are popular.  <br/>

Truly we haven&#39;t claimed different here (except maybe Kelly &lt;BEG&gt;).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah---always the radical!<br/>
<br/>
I *do* believe that unschooling can simply be not schooling at home, <br/>
but that MUST include no grades, no (validated) tests (because some <br/>
states require testing), no forced reading or math or other &#39;subjects&#39;, <br/>
and no concrete academic expectations.<br/>
<br/>
*This* group (well, its loudest proponents!), though, wants people to <br/>
see that it can expand further into a child&#39;s life (as well as that of <br/>
the parents!) and encompass chores, bedtimes, food, curfews---that <br/>
principles CAN replace rules and produce results better than rules <br/>
could ever dream to. An unschooling lifestyle or life-philosophy can <br/>
make the family sweeter and gentler and more generous towards one <br/>
another. It can make life joyful and peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
Not doing school at home can&#39;t do that. It *can* make learning fun and <br/>
enjoyable---but the other parts of life are still lacking *something* <br/>
when chores are expected and bedtimes are enforced and food is <br/>
restricted and the child&#39;s time is not really his own.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s what&#39;s missing when people say unschooling doesn&#39;t <br/>
work---or when they complain that they can&#39;t get their kids to do <br/>
something. I think they are missing the biggest element of the <br/>
unschooling philosophy: that children *can* be trusted and respected. <br/>
That they *want* to be good people and *need* to feel appreciated for <br/>
who they are, when they are.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling only academically just doesn&#39;t get to the *point*. I think <br/>
it shows a lack of trust on the part of the parent.<br/>
<br/>
I like to be trusted. I think my kids do too.<br/>
