<div id="ygrps-yiv-90585803">Hi!  I&#39;m Diane.  We&#39;re new to this list.  So far, I really like it :-)<br/>
<br/>
We are unschoolers in NY.  We&#39;re having our share of problems.  But I&#39;ll<br/>
share them as it goes along.<br/>
<br/>
We are Christians.  I really liked this article!  I was so excited to see<br/>
that others were &quot;unschooling&quot; as well.  Alll of the Christians we know who<br/>
homeschool all have school in the home.  Very very rigid.  <br/>
<br/>
This was definitely refreshing!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;                 Hello again! I thought I would just take<br/>
&gt;                 some time today to let you know more<br/>
&gt;                 about our unschooling. The things we do<br/>
&gt;                 and how the children learn. But first, let<br/>
&gt;                 me elaborate on the general idea of<br/>
&gt;                 unschooling.<br/>

    We are too. I know of another family nearby but like you most I know <br/>
follow a pretty rigid curriculum. I&#39;m glad to know of others.<br/>
