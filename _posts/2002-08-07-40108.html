 </span></blockquote>I am not trying to start anything and hopefully I am not reading to much into <br/>
this.... Are you saying that the only ones that come to faith in Christ are <br/>
God&#39;s chosen people?<br/>
Is everyone else dismissed?<br/>
I just wonder because of the battles of religion right annow and in the <br/>
past....<br/>
Two of the major ones say that if you don&#39;t follow this way, you are going to <br/>
hell. You can&#39;t follow both ways and it just drives me nuts. I can see why <br/>
alot of people get turned off of religion because of it.<br/>
I guess that there will always be that battle and I just excuse myself from <br/>
particpating in it , and let those with those thoughts fight it out.....LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear ?,<br/>
<br/>
That is orthodoxy, and isn&#39;t anything new. And yes, it can be infuriating -- <br/>
especially when the &quot;authorities&quot; tell the faithful that it&#39;s time to go to <br/>
war.<br/>
<br/>
But really, having rigid ideas that differentiate between what is orthodox <br/>
from what is hereodox is little different from what at times goes on at this <br/>
list: new folks come in with ideas about what constitutes unschooling. When <br/>
those ideas are not in fact what the &quot;tradition&quot; of unschooling holds, if you <br/>
will, then the newbies hear about it!<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing wrong with any of this. There is also nothing wrong with <br/>
girls&#39; schools, boys&#39; schools, men&#39;s clubs, women&#39;s clubs, Christian churches <br/>
founded upon the doctrine of the elect, or Christian churches founded upon <br/>
the writings of Mary Baker Eddy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only when the bombs start falling ...<br/>
