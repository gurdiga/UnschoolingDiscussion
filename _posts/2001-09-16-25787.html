&gt; I&#39;m struggling right now with fine-tuning my philosophy of<br/>
&gt; education.  It would be tremendously helpful if anyone is willing to<br/>
&gt; share why they believe unschooling is the best way to go.  Why not<br/>
&gt; the Charlotte Mason approach?  Or the Moore Formula?  Why do you<br/>
&gt; believe what you believe?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because it doesn&#39;t make sense to me that we can trust babies to learn to<br/>
walk and talk (fairly difficult skills to master) and we can trust adults to<br/>
learn what they need to (I learned bookselling at age 32 or thereabouts, all<br/>
on my own iniative) but somehow we can&#39;t trust people from the ages of 5<br/>
through 17 to learn what THEY need to. It just seems plain silly to think<br/>
that enforced learning is somehow &quot;necessary&quot; for those 12 years, but not<br/>
otherwise.<br/>

Wow this is so simple and pure.  I love it Pam, may I share it with others?<br/>

my name and e-mail address, but if you forget I won&#39;t be sending the dogs<br/>
