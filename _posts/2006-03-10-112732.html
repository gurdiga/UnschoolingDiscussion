<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065715866">Why it&#39;s important to have the well honed ability to choose for<br/>
oneself ---to sift the unimportant from the valuable---  rather than<br/>
simply accept the spoonfed style of education.  I saw this quote this<br/>
on a word origins list:<br/>
<br/>
What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention <br/>
of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of<br/>
attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the<br/>
overabundance of information sources that might consume it. -Herbert<br/>
Alexander Simon, economist, Nobel laureate (1916-2001)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just had the sudden picture of presidents and their advisors, how<br/>
impossible it is that every decision the president makes is his own. <br/>
I mean, the information that&#39;s considered of key importance for the<br/>
president&#39;s consideration.  How does that get decided?  There&#39;s<br/>
something wrong with that picture, but it&#39;s likely to be something I<br/>
don&#39;t understand.  <br/>
<br/>
As to myself and my family being able to choose for themselves the<br/>
information each person finds valueable... I just love that<br/>
unschooling can make that happen.<br/>
