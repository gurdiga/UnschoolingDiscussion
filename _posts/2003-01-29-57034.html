&lt;&lt; To press children at eleven to have a career chosen and at two to grow up <br/>
to <br/>
 be handsome takes away the joy of who they are and what they care about <br/>
right <br/>
 at that moment. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THis is a pet peeve of mine.<br/>
My kids often talk about things they might like to do now AND later....but I <br/>
would never send the message that they should be trying to choose a career <br/>
path.<br/>
Trevor said he wanted to be a rock musician today, but that he might like to <br/>
design video games.<br/>
I said &quot;Hell, you could do both!&quot;  I always try to counter the message that <br/>
people should choose a single career path and point out all the different <br/>
things their Dad and I have done.<br/>
Life is a journey. It doesn&#39;t peak at the point of college, or choosing a <br/>
career or ANY single moment. <br/>
That whole line of thought is so limiting.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
