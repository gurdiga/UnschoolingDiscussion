<div id="ygrps-yiv-988138808">Reminds me of the time I followed a driver. I had stopped in front of my <br/>
house to see if the power had come on during the ice storm here in Maine. The car <br/>
of teenagers came up behind me and laid on its horn and yelled something at <br/>
me. I drove down the road behind them to ask what the problem was and the kid <br/>
stopped his car got out and opened the trunk. I didn&#39;t stay to find out what he <br/>
pulled out. <br/>
Another time some kids went by our home at like 90 mph, I called the police <br/>
and I went to find them. A local officer flagged me down and said not a good <br/>
idea. That if I went to their door they could shoot me for trespassing. Ugh, <br/>
nice.. Good ol&#39; Maine. This was the same kids that drove by me retrieving my <br/>
loose dog and their mirror brushed my shirt as they flew by.  The speed on our <br/>
street is 35 but not many follow it. Laura<br/>

&lt;&lt;Oh sheesh!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have told a story too much like an ugly truth.<br/>
<br/>
Very sorry about your brother.<br/>
<br/>
I had thoughts of potential death when I confronted my behind-me neighbor <br/>
about being mean to his kids but at that moment it was worth the risk.<br/>
