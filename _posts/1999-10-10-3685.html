<div id="ygrps-yiv-577200418">I am forwarding this from my husband&#39;s mail. I think that this is a very good <br/>
point! I am sending it to all my lists, sorry if you get duplicates ;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  One day, an expert in time management was speaking to a group of<br/>
  business students and, to drive home a point, used an illustration<br/>
  those students will never forget.<br/>
  <br/>
  As he stood in front of the group of high-powered overachievers he<br/>
  said, &quot;Okay, time for a quiz&quot; and he pulled out a one-gallon,<br/>
  wide-mouth mason jar and set it on the table in front of him.<br/>
  <br/>
  He also produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed<br/>
  them, one at a time, into the jar. When the jar was filled to the top<br/>
  and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, &quot;Is this jar full?&quot;<br/>
  Everyone in the class yelled, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
  The time management expert replied, &quot;Really?&quot; He reached under the<br/>
  table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. He dumped some gravel in and<br/>
  shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into<br/>
  the spaces between the big rocks.<br/>
  <br/>
  He then asked the group once more, &quot;Is the jar full?&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
  By this time the class was on to him. &quot;Probably not,&quot; one of them<br/>
  answered.<br/>
  <br/>
  &quot;Good!&quot; he replied. He reached under the table and brought out a<br/>
  bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in the jar and it went<br/>
  into all of the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. Once<br/>
  more he asked the question, &quot;Is this jar full?&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
  &quot;No!&quot; the class shouted.<br/>
  <br/>
  Once again he said, &quot;Good.&quot; Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and<br/>
  began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim. Then he<br/>
  looked at the class and asked, &quot;What is the point of this<br/>
  illustration?&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
  One eager beaver raised his hand and said, &quot;The point is, no matter<br/>
  how full your schedule is, if you try really hard you can always fit<br/>
  some more things in it!&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
  &quot;No,&quot; the speaker replied, &quot;that&#39;s not the point. The truth this<br/>
  illustration teaches us is: If you don&#39;t put the big rocks in first,<br/>
  you&#39;ll never get them in at all. What are the &#39;big rocks&#39; in your<br/>
  life, your faith, time with your loved ones, a worthy cause, teaching<br/>
  or mentoring others,  your education, your dreams? Remember to put<br/>
  these BIG ROCKS in first or you&#39;ll never get them in at all. So,<br/>
  tonight, or in the morning, when you are reflecting on this short<br/>
  story, ask yourself this question: What are the &#39;big rocks&#39; in my<br/>
  life? Then, put those in your jar first.<br/>
