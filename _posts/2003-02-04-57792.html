<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But that&#39;s what I meant! You WILL miss some things, no matter how homesick<br/>
&gt; you might be NOW. When you&#39;re gone, the neat things about the place you left<br/>
&gt; will be JUST as missed as home is now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;ll miss things here.  They&#39;re things I could live without, but<br/>
they&#39;re nice here.  I get homesick, but I don&#39;t miss home.  Where the heck<br/>
is that, anyway?  This is my 9th house in 10 years of marriage.  Tim&#39;s 6th.<br/>
I miss my country.  I know lots of people don&#39;t like it, but I&#39;m happily<br/>
American.  I like our ways.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t gripe constantly, but I do have down times.  This is one of them. I<br/>
have tried to bloom here, but in some places the soil is rocky and thin.<br/>
And most flowers don&#39;t bloom all winter.<br/>
