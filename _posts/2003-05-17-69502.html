<div id="ygrps-yiv-377487503">I was wondering if I could ask for some comments on Cable VS Dish.<br/>
<br/>
We have a direct TV dish from a year or so ago. We went back to cable because <br/>
of local news channels so we could keep an eye on the ice storms.<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about it and I do not think any of us watch much of the <br/>
local stations.<br/>
What I mean is that we watch channels like Nick, Nick Jr, History, Fox News, <br/>
Outdoor channels etc. The upper channels.<br/>
<br/>
Cable is costing 60.00 a month. I am trying to cut some costs we have and <br/>
possibly get a better deal.<br/>
I am thinking a dish may offer us all more choices. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a Dish and do you have any issues that I may have forgotten <br/>
about in our last use?<br/>
<br/>
What is a good system? Direct TV, Dish Network etc..<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your time.<br/>
<br/>

We get our local channels with our DISH Network service now. I think <br/>
they changed that recently so that it&#39;s included.<br/>

We just switched. We got more channels and lower cost. The dish worked<br/>
during a heavy snowfall. I haven&#39;t seen any downsides yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116375225">Hi,<br/>
I pay $10.10 per month for cable tv.<br/>
I have the most basic service.<br/>
I get the networks, PBS, and a few other stations.<br/>
The folks next door have &#39;basic&#39; - they pay 35.00 per month.<br/>
They get Disney, History Channel, Lifetime, etc  - I think it&#39;s channel 2 - 79 or something like that. Plus they can get pay per views.<br/>
<br/>
I also get a break on my high speed internet because I use the same company for phone, long distance, cable and internet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194172311">We have had both DirecTV and Dish Network.  We have Dish Network right now as DirecTV is not available here.  Both are good and both have the local channels now.  We liked a couple of things about DirecTV better.  The picture comes up faster when you change channels and the programming list is a little easier to use.  Other than that they are equal in quality.  We tried digital cable first when we moved here and had it removed almost immediately. The picture was awful and the programming list was a pain to check (scrolls down forever and you have no control over it).  The only problem we had with the dish at our other house was that there was a tree close to it and we had to keep the branches trimmed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for your response.<br/>
I hear you on the digital cable scroll.<br/>
Im not sure if we can get the local&#39;s. We live in an area where its a toll <br/>
call to call the next town. The channel listings for local services are shown <br/>
to be available for the next town but not use and I think they are Boston <br/>
stations. I think I am going to call Direct TV and ask. I see they are <br/>
offering a three box deal which would be nice because I think last time the <br/>
kids didn&#39;t get all the channels we did.<br/>
We had to upgrade the cable so the little one would have Nick Jr and then <br/>
they took the speed channel and that&#39;s one of my dh favorites. Adds up fast!<br/>
Going to call them and see if I can figure out what all our wants will cost.<br/>
