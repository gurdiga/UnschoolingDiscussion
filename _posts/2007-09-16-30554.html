<div id="ygrps-yiv-767515798">I have found a whole lot of these magazines for sale but I wanted to <br/>
find out a bit more about them and if they are worthwhile.<br/>
They are priced at around $2 each.<br/>

I LOVED those and when Kirby was five, I  would wait two months for  <br/>
the next one.<br/>
Nowadays, though, better information is available instantly on  <br/>
webpages and discussion lists.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in the history of how unschooling developed, it  <br/>
would be good to have and read, but if you want help and ideas for  <br/>
how to interact with your children in 2007, you can get more between  <br/>
now and the end of the week than is in all the back issues of GWS.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a John Holt fan and you can get the earlier issues where he  <br/>
was writing, those would be GREAT to have, though!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411000430">Hi Stacey,<br/>
<br/>
These mags were the mainstay of my philosophy in the early years of my <br/>
home ed days - I took my eldest out of school at 5, just 7 weeks after <br/>
he started, and he&#39;s 26 now. They were great. They probably still have <br/>
lots of interesting, valuable stuff in them, especially the earlier one <br/>
where John Holt was writing.<br/>
<br/>
But there is so much good stuff - and stuff more relevant to today - on <br/>
the web This list, Sandra&#39;s web site, Joyce&#39;s web site. And if you want <br/>
to talk about local issues, the RUA list (Radical Unschoolers of Aotearoa)<br/>
