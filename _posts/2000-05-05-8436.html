<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Tonight&#39;s &quot;Nightline&quot; on ABC&nbsp;focused on the 
ILOVEYOU computer virus that today has done so much damage to computers and 
systems all over the world.&nbsp; Mention was made that another virus is now 
also going around.&nbsp; It&nbsp;has Very Funny as its subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Therefore, I wanted to warn everyone about this additional, potential 
problem.&nbsp; DO NOT&nbsp;OPEN EITHER E-MAIL!&nbsp; It is also recommended 
that, to be safe, no attachments to any e-mails should be opened&nbsp;right 
now.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Please be especially careful with any e-messages 
that contain ILOVEYOU and/or VERY FUNNY&nbsp;as their subjects.&nbsp; The 
viruses contained in both e-mails are terribly destructive!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Good luck!</font></div>
