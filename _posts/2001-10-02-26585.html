&gt; If you don&#39;t quit working every conversation around to how mean and<br/>
&gt; vindictive Sandra is and how you have been victimized on this list, <br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; ain&#39;t gonna be no &quot;pseudo&quot; about it.<br/>

She is not the one who said the above.  (Although she did say something<br/>
else extremely mean and spiteful, too. 25250)  The majority of the people<br/>
here are fine.  But you can bet that anytime someone says something that<br/>
contradicts what actually happened here in the past, I&#39;m gonna comment on<br/>
it.  And since YOU brought her up, Sandra said she does not mean to hurt,<br/>
well saying, &quot;I&#39;d be depressed too [if I were her]&quot; is hurtful.  There is<br/>
no way around that. <br/>
<br/>
While were here, back on this topic, I&#39;d love for someone to explain how<br/>
Sandra could be bashing me for espousing views she does not think are<br/>
unschooling one month and recommending that someone hand her son a<br/>
written curriculum the next.  I have to say, I agree with whoever said<br/>
that the very act of giving him the list may make him think this is what<br/>
he is &#39;supposed&#39; to know.  Even if you leave the doing any of it<br/>
completely voluntary, the damage may be done.  It seems like a major<br/>
contradiction of beliefs to me.<br/>

<br/>
I was answering a specific question from an anxious parent with what seemed, <br/>
in my personal opinion, the least invasive answer to what she thought would <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you try doing that on this list too?  <br/>
It would be good if you would respond to people&#39;s topics, and the IDEAS and <br/>
situations posed, from your personal knowledge, and try, if possible, to stop <br/>
what you&#39;ve been doing since you arrived here which is taking/making things <br/>
personal, being entirely jittery and defensive, and picking on me as though <br/>
there were no other object on your horizon.<br/>
<br/>
I am serious.  I want you to stop harrassing me and get on with the business <br/>
of the list itself, and with unschooling, as I have asked a dozen times.  <br/>
Stop quoting old messages with message numbers and instead, involve yourself <br/>
with unschooling, thinking about unschooling, writing about unschooling, or <br/>
please leave me and the list alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633590860">Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
Please stop. This is not what this list is about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We all welcome your ideas and opinions about unschooling for discussion.<br/>
However, you seem unable to have a courteous conversation with people who<br/>
are, from the goodness of their hearts, offering ideas, opinions, and<br/>
suggestions, about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I need to add my voice to the many here who have been more than clear that<br/>
we are here to discuss (and in my case, lurk over) ideas and opinions on<br/>
unschooling. And not your private agenda against Sandra.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bridget, you do have a lot to offer this list.  I&#39;d like to keep on reading <br/>
what you have to say about unschooling and all that entails.  I do not want <br/>
to read one more post about your conflict with Sandra.  If you don&#39;t like <br/>
what Sandra has to say, stop reading her posts.  This is what I&#39;m going to <br/>
have to do with your posts if you can&#39;t put your dislike of her aside and <br/>
participate in the group without it.  I&#39;d really rather just be able to <br/>
read everyone&#39;s posts.<br/>
