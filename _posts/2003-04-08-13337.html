&gt; asked how many days are in a year. I told him 365. He then asked if this <br/>
&gt; was a D number. A what? a D number, mom, like thirDy, forDy,, fifDy...a D <br/>
&gt; number , Mom. oh, yes Riley, 365 is in the hundreds and the 60 part is a D <br/>
&gt; number. My 8 year old held her tongue too. Yipee.<br/>

Cameron asked a few weeks ago about &quot;The&quot; bands. We asked, &quot;The Band&quot;? No, <br/>
&quot;The&quot; bands---like &quot;The Beatles&quot;, &quot;The Monkees&quot;, &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;, The <br/>
Byrds&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
D-numbers! Hah!<br/>
<br/>
And recently we were talking here about Shakespearian insults. The other day <br/>
Duncan got mad at Cameron and said, &quot;Yeah, and if you were an action figure, <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t even BUY you!&quot; &lt;G&gt; Gotta love it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&quot;Let&#39;s pretend.....&quot; What a nice idea!<br/>
