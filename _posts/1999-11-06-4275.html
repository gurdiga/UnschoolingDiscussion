<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, if you were <br/>
 </span></blockquote>coloring your lips with the crayon, you probably did get a good dose of<br/>
lead <br/>
in you at that time :o(<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s to artistry and creativity... but it can be crushed by the damage<br/>
lead <br/>
causes to the brain, not just ranting educators who insist you color in<br/>
the <br/>
lines and be like everyone else :o)<br/>
