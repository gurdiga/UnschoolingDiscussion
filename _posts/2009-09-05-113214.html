<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040215772">I&#39;ve had a note in my desk for years that says &quot;Find that battleaxe  <br/>
thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Today I found it.  What &quot;it&quot; is is a post from 1998, on a forum that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t exist, but I printed it out then, so I&#39;m transcribing it here.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Oliver is looking over my shoulder, and he needs clarity on the  <br/>
difference between a battleaxe and a pike.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A battleaxe is a cranky old woman and a pike is a fish.<br/>
<br/>
A pike is longer and has to have a pokey thing on the end (speartip).  <br/>
An axehead is optional.<br/>
<br/>
A battleaxe is heavier, shorter, and the pokey thing is optional.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying this without looking in a book or calling my many  <br/>
knowledgeable friends. BRB. (Did you know I was gone?)<br/>
<br/>
I would ask my husband but he&#39;s off buying a caster for my kick stool  <br/>
(because I&#39;m short), which brings up the question what is the  <br/>
difference between a caster (or is it castor? they do make that oil... <br/>
[just joking]) and a wheel?<br/>
<br/>
Okay. I called my friend Jeff [a.k.a. Duke Artan MacAilin in the SCA].  <br/>
He&#39;s a word-freak and medieval combat practitioner. I read him my  <br/>
definitions and he said &quot;that&#39;s it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say something about knowing everything. I had a family  <br/>
visit my house last weekend. It was like an unschooling factory tour.  <br/>
I was showing them toys and telling stories about how if kids have  <br/>
played with all kinds of things and thereby gotten scientific  <br/>
principles down in a sensory and intellectual kind of way, after  <br/>
they&#39;re older all that&#39;s left is the vocabulary, the terminology.<br/>
<br/>
I bought a dictionary with my own money at the age of nine. I&#39;ve been  <br/>
accused of being a know-it-all my whole life, but what I mostly know  <br/>
is words. If you know the name for an alternator, if you know the  <br/>
difference between an alternator and a generator by definitions, it  <br/>
will seem you know about the electrical systems of cars, and you WILL  <br/>
know more than if you didn&#39;t know that.<br/>
<br/>
So because I&#39;ve read about the Middle Ages for fun all my life and  <br/>
then hung around guys who talk about and make and use weapons, I just  <br/>
know. Same way people can tell a poodle from a greyhound (terminology)  <br/>
people gradually add to the details of their knowledge every day that  <br/>
they live.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why unschooling works. That&#39;s HOW unschooling works. Because  <br/>
someone cares about the difference between a pike (the word &quot;pike&quot;)  <br/>
and a battleaxe (the word and the parameters of its meaning).<br/>
<br/>
Definitions. Look at the word itself, &quot;definitions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OKAY! If you read this post carefully you&#39;ve just done more than many  <br/>
college courses in philosophy do in an hour. Congratulations, you  <br/>
unschooler!<br/>
