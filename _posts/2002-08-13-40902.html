<div id="ygrps-yiv-134145144">&quot;I&#39;ve had actual occupations over the<br/>
years and parenting preoccupations that have held me at bay&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s all some of us have been trying to tell you....that right <br/>
now we are focused on our families and lives here at home and don&#39;t <br/>
have the extra energy/time to give to political activism.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t aware of the issues, it doesn&#39;t mean we <br/>
don&#39;t care. <br/>
I don&#39;t agree with some of your views, I do with others. But this is <br/>
not the time in my life to be a militaristic homeschooling activist. <br/>
I have four rambunctous children that deserve most of my energy, a <br/>
home business to run, another job outside of the home that gets some <br/>
of my time and combine that with trying to do things that interest me <br/>
and that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got time for.<br/>
I only was upset with you for trying to take a list dedicated to <br/>
discussion of unschooling and trying to change it to a political <br/>
list, of which there are plenty of other places for.<br/>
The people here aren&#39;t daft, they aren&#39;t unaware, they do care deeply <br/>
about keeping freedom. This just isn&#39;t the place for it to be <br/>
focused, although it does come up occasionally.<br/>
Thank you for respecting the wishes of those here that want to <br/>
discuss how unschooling affects our households, how it spills into <br/>
other areas of our lives, how our children grow and learn....THAT is <br/>
what I&#39;m here for.<br/>
One day I will be joining the ranks of those dedicated to actively <br/>
protecting our freedoms...this is not the time.<br/>
I love what you have to say about unschooling, about your son, about <br/>
natural learning.<br/>
I could learn a lot from you. My oldest is only 12 1/2 so I love to <br/>
hear how these grown unschoolers are following their dreams and being <br/>
successful....sometimes I wonder when I see my son playing video <br/>
games and watching tv for hours on end!! :)<br/>
I do have a question, that I hope can be answered simply and not <br/>
start another diatribe :)<br/>
Does anyone here blame HSLDA with all their unecessary stridency and <br/>
willingness to divide homeschoolers for the loss of freedom we are <br/>
experiencing?  I wonder if all their activism is doing enough damage <br/>
that it&#39;s really beginning to affect more people now....???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021273826">Dear Tia,<br/>
  Here in the US states HSLDA fights hard to preserve our right to homeschool. I know personally families that they helped when being harrassed by school officials. Without them one of these families would have complied and sent thier son back to public school.  HSLDA is in Washington DC fighting to preserve our rights as home schoolers and continually monitoring the laws that affect home schoolers. With all due respect, I am an advocate for HSLDA because without them many people would just sit back and let the goverment, state and city officials tell us what we can and cannot do when it come to educating our children at home.  A perfect example is prayer taken out of school, no one stood up and wham, it was accomplished and the same with the Pledge Allegiance, thank God though we have people fighting for this one. Take care and God bless, Mary W.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682825468">HSLDA has it&#39;s good points.  They are supportive of our fight for a <br/>
new law in PA.  However, they are very much school-at-homers. <br/>
<br/>
I wish they would support unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as prayer in schools and the pledge in schools, my solution is <br/>
to just get rid of public schools and then these things won&#39;t be an <br/>
issue. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad they are helping you in PA.  I know there are states (and <br/>
provinces) where people are really angry at the way HSLDA hijacked the <br/>
legislative process and got perfectly good laws changed to make it harder <br/>
for the unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s before we even begin to get into their political agenda, which <br/>
scares the pants off me.  I do not ever want to live in a theocracy, even <br/>
if it was a theocracy consisting of my personal spiritual beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
I find it hard to understand why an unschooler would even care about prayer <br/>
in the schools or the pledge, since the only time I ever had to say it was <br/>
in school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If people even think about supporting HSLDA or recommending them, they<br/>
should at least do some research to be informed about the group they&#39;re<br/>
giving money to. You should know that you are giving money so Christian<br/>
fundamentalists *exclusively* can represent and defend (those cases they<br/>
choose to defend -- and sometimes not even defend but just advise). (You<br/>
might note that HSLDA&#39;s lists of support groups -- presented as though it<br/>
were a complete list -- is *only* Christian fundamentalist groups.)<br/>
<br/>
A good place to start is More Information About HSLDA<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://folchslda.homestead.com/MoreInfo.html">http://folchslda.homestead.com/MoreInfo.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Though the HSLDA folks have been heard to claim they aren&#39;t in with the<br/>
Reconstructionists, they&#39;re awfully chummy with them. (The<br/>
Reconstructionists want to &quot;return&quot; America to the theocracy the Founding<br/>
Fathers supposedly intended it to be. (I&#39;m not quite sure how they explain<br/>
Jefferson!))<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to read Seelhoff vs. Welch and Homeschooling Freedoms at Risk for<br/>
some of the things HSLDA has been involved with. Reconstruction Theology in<br/>
Home Education is an excellent introduction to the Reconstructionists.<br/>
<br/>
And though many people who support HSLDA might think a political college<br/>
specifically for Christian homeschoolers (Patrick Henry College) sounds like<br/>
worthy cause, I wonder if they&#39;d think the same if they later found out the<br/>
people they&#39;d been trusting to represent them as *homeschoolers* had been<br/>
funneling money (until they split off a separate fund) and actively working<br/>
for a political college for witches or Muslims or Jews or some special<br/>
interest that they wouldn&#39;t have supported. (The former President of HSLDA<br/>
is now President of Patrick Henry College and still on the Board of<br/>
Directors of HSLDA.)<br/>
