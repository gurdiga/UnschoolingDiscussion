<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957015918">I stumped it with breast milk and let me just say, the computer might do<br/>
well to attend a LLL meeting or 2, because it is woefully unenlightened<br/>
regarding breastmilk!  I also stumped it with band-aid.  It told me that<br/>
one could not play with a band aid, and neither is it colorfulId like to<br/>
invite it to my house to see my happily playing with colorful band-aid<br/>
children!  BTWthe two best toys for travel with little kids:  band-aids and<br/>
tape.<br/>

Tami, who also remembers mainframe computers from college, and also when<br/>
dial up meant literally sticking the receiver of your dorm-room phone into<br/>
the back of a terminal to access the mainframe.<br/>

You&#39;re a lot younger than I am.<br/>
A terminal in a DORM!?<br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
We had to hike over the the computing center and find out who we could be  <br/>
&quot;next&quot; after.  Each terminal kinda had its own informal queue.  <br/>
 <br/>
Life is wonderful now, computer-wise. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

1972....I remember this gigantic computer in this HUGE (very  cold)  room at <br/>
Eastern New Mexico University.  We punched in  these cards.  It was Computer <br/>
101!  We waited our turns to use the  keypuch machines.  I was fairly clueless <br/>
about the whole process. <br/>
 <br/>
Earlier tonight, my mom gave Logan her old CPU and he took it apart in  the <br/>
living room  to see how it works and reassembled it in his  bedroom....just <br/>
needs a monitor.  He is thrilled.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m old....&gt;G&lt;<br/>
