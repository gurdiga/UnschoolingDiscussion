<div id="ygrps-yiv-834481624">Farenheit 451 was about government control.  That was what i got out of it.  <br/>
The government took control of what the TV was saying and turned it into <br/>
moronic stuff, so no one could think for themselves.  And books were outlawed.  <br/>
Freedom was removed.  And the &quot;people allowed it.&quot;  Except for the few.  (which I <br/>
would hope to be)<br/>

&gt; the popular programs on tv--the competition programs--they donâ€™t give<br/>
&gt; you anything but factoids.  They tell you when Napoleon was born, but<br/>
&gt; not who he was.  So it doesnâ€™t matter about the dates, you shouldnâ€™t<br/>
&gt; memorize dates, to hell with it.  So we&#39;ve moved into this period of<br/>
&gt; history that I described in Fahrenheit 50 years ago.&quot;<br/>
