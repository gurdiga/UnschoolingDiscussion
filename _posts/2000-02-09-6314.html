<h4>Winifred Haun + Dancers</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339762929">Thank you so much for your encouraging words, Beth and Betsy (we meet<br/>
again!).  To answer your question Beth, I am still doing occassional<br/>
projects (and keeping my website, etc.).  I go for months when I&#39;m working<br/>
on very little, I get restless and I do a small project that doesn&#39;t<br/>
require too much time away from home. Having a pre-schooler, as you know,<br/>
makes outside projects challenging, and maybe more so when you have a very<br/>
separation sensitive little girl like mine.  Most of the time I bring her<br/>
with me, she does quite well at meetings, ballet classes, rehearsals.  We<br/>
are thinking about having another baby and I probably won&#39;t do anything<br/>
for a long time after the second one is born.  I love my work and I&#39;m in<br/>
the position of getting to choose my projects (which is a blessing and a<br/>
curse!).  Right now I have a 12 week project, which means rehearsing 6<br/>
hours a week (3 hours a day for 2 days) and then I probably won&#39;t do<br/>
anything for at least 6 months.  We&#39;re very involved with La Leche League,<br/>
an organization I credit with helping me to become an attached mother (and<br/>
led me down this *dangerous* path into homeschooling and into<br/>
un-schooling!!)  I&#39;m just worried I won&#39;t EVER get back to the work I<br/>
love...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for &quot;listening&quot;<br/>
Wini<br/>
