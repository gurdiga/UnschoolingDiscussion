I was just shopping around at FUNbooks and was a little tempted by book<br/>
The Cartoon Guide to Physics.  There&#39;s also a computer game with the<br/>
same title.<br/>
<br/>
For a brief intro to a school science subject, the Standard Deviants<br/>
videos are fun.  If your library doesn&#39;t have them, tell them they<br/>
should get them.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434933476">Standard Deviants have college-level course material and it is great.  <br/>
They have them, I think, at Mentura (online educational video service).  <br/>
My kids mostly use community college courses - that&#39;s what lots of  <br/>
older homeschooled kids do here in California when they feel like they  <br/>
want a formal course in something. I&#39;d look at distance education  <br/>
options offered by colleges and universities, too. Also - advertise  <br/>
that you have an interest and see if there are a couple of other teens  <br/>
with the same interest and see if you can find an adult with that  <br/>
expertise to offer a course for them.<br/>
<br/>
I would not even consider a high school, by the way, unless I knew  <br/>
something wonderful about that particular science teacher. Too many  <br/>
obstacles to learning - other kids who don&#39;t want to be there, burned  <br/>
out teachers, out-of-date materials, uneducated teachers (PE teachers  <br/>
frequently teach science courses), focus on testing and grading and not  <br/>
on learning, and so on. And then the kid ends up having to take the  <br/>
course again in college, with nearly identical material. Might as well  <br/>
get the college credit the first time through and use college years to  <br/>
learn something new.<br/>

Julie, my oldest son in particular has been into Maths and Sciences. At age 14, he applied for a gifted kids Chemistry class at university - and got accepted and loved these classes for the next three years. They are into Chemistry Olympiads internationally - so a kid might like to contact a local university for possible links and details. <br/>
<br/>
He also &quot;just&quot; studied on his own - liked reading a variety of Maths books ( esp those by Theoni Pappas) and Science books ( eg biographies of Kessler, info on the chaos theory). He also read standard Maths and Science texts. Eventually, he sat the Sat 1 exam and the SAT 11 subject exams - including the Physics/Maths/Chem ones.  <br/>
<br/>
Had no problem getting into another uni and finishing his first degree. <br/>
<br/>
I find that, if kids are interested, they and we will find ways that suit...Leonie<br/>

My neighbor often tutors or teaches small classes of advanced math to<br/>
homeschooled kids. He says he loves it because they are eager and fascinated<br/>
to learn this stuff, so he really enjoys passing on his knowledge. You might<br/>
look for somebody like that, especially if you can find somebody who has a<br/>
real passion for math or science (not just teaching because it&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot;<br/>
to be learnt), and respects kids and the different ways that they learn. My<br/>
son is very interested in all things math, so I&#39;m hoping this neighbor will<br/>
still be around when/if he gets to the stuff I can&#39;t explain :-).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes, forgot to mention tutors! My oldest three sons,  who are studying at uni, who were unschooled themselves, also tutor a couple of homeschool kids in subjects like Maths and Science. Tutor is a loose word - they are just a bit older than the high school age teens they work with, they read and do interesting stuff with these kids - kids who felt a need for more interaction or guidance in these areas.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask around for an older homeschooled kid to play around in Maths etc with a child/teen...Leonie<br/>
