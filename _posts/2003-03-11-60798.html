<div id="ygrps-yiv-735597091">Every once in awhile I run into a dilemma and I say to myself, &quot;I <br/>
wonder how those ladies at unschooling.com would handle this?&quot;  lol  <br/>
<br/>
So here are two recent dilemmas I&#39;ve had.  I&#39;m not c happy with the <br/>
way I handled them but couldn&#39;t figure out a better way.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
someone here can help me learn from my mistakes.  <br/>
<br/>
First situation: <br/>
My boys, ages 5 and 3, fight fiercely.  They call each other stupid <br/>
all the time.  If I ask my 5 year old why he hurt his brother, his <br/>
answer is often &quot;Because he&#39;s stupid&quot;.  I&#39;ve tried naming his <br/>
feelings for him but he doesn&#39;t want to hear it most of the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he brought me a piece of paper and asked me to write &quot;Luke <br/>
is stupid&quot; for him.  I told him that I wouldn&#39;t, and I told him I <br/>
don&#39;t want to write things that aren&#39;t true, and that it&#39;s not true <br/>
that Luke is stupid&quot;.  So he asked me to write &quot;Luke is nice&quot; for <br/>
him and I did.  A few minutes later he came with a piece of paper <br/>
and asked me to write just the word stupid.  Now I KNEW he was up to <br/>
something, but I wrote it anyway.  He took it and copied stupid <br/>
under the word nice that I had written in my sentence for him.  And <br/>
he paraded the paper in front of his brother, telling him that mommy <br/>
wrote Luke is nice but he changed nice to stupid.  And of course it <br/>
resulted in them beating each other up--Luke scratching his face, <br/>
Matt pounding him with his fists until I pried them apart and made <br/>
them stop fighting.  <br/>
<br/>
Second situation: <br/>
My daughter (9) was invited to a friend&#39;s house today, and at the <br/>
last minute decided that she was nervous about going and asked me to <br/>
stay with her for a few minutes at their house.  I told her that I <br/>
would, but my 5 year old heard me and declared that he would NOT <br/>
go.  <br/>
<br/>
I told him that I would call his Nanny (grandmother) and ask if he <br/>
could stay with her, and he said no.  So I asked him if he would <br/>
like me to call her and see if she could come here so he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have to leave the house and he said no, but my 3 year old said he <br/>
would like that.  I called her, but she said that they&#39;re welcome to <br/>
come there but she couldn&#39;t come here.  I told her ok.  My 5 year <br/>
old was very upset.  I could barely get his socks and shoes on him <br/>
and I could barely get him to the van.  We got to their Nanny&#39;s <br/>
house and he wouldn&#39;t get out of the car and the 3 year old didn&#39;t <br/>
want to stay by himself, so I apologized to Nanny and drove my <br/>
daughter to her friend&#39;s house. <br/>
<br/>
 I apologized to my daughter and told her that I couldn&#39;t stay with <br/>
her and that this was something she would just have to do on her <br/>
own.  She was upset about me not staying with her like I promised <br/>
but at least she did stay--she often cries when I have to leave her <br/>
and she didn&#39;t this time.  She saw everything I had to go through to <br/>
get her brothers into the car and even though I didn&#39;t say anything <br/>
about it, the stress must have been showing on my face.  (I don&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;ve adequately explained the HUGE struggle it was to get my 5 <br/>
year old into that car)  She told me, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to have caused you <br/>
so much trouble&quot; and she broke my heart.  I really wanted to be <br/>
there for her and stay with her at her friend&#39;s house but I <br/>
absolutely could not.  And now I&#39;m feeling like there must be <br/>
something I could have done differently. :( <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m opening myself up for any and all suggestions and constructive <br/>
criticisms!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153792538">This is a toughie and it&#39;s something we&#39;ve worked on avoiding with our own <br/>
kids.  (and its&#39; worked!) So, know that it IS possible to have kids who <br/>
don&#39;t torment each other.  It&#39;s not something that you can just <br/>
plug-in-and-play, but is rather a paradigm shift in how you think about <br/>
relationships.  I don&#39;t know you, and I don&#39;t know your kids, so I&#39;m just <br/>
going to throw stuff out there to be thought about.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, you&#39;ve read and ingested and re-read Adelle Fabers&#39; books, <br/>
right?  The whole &#39;learn to talk so kids will listen&#39; thing?  It&#39;s really <br/>
helped us out with learning how to talk with our kids and identifying <br/>
subtly aggressive behavior, which means we can deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, do some work on self-assertiveness for Yourself.  I&#39;m wondering <br/>
if sometimes it&#39;s difficult for you to say when something is not feeling <br/>
right for you and sitting that child down to peacefully talk it over with <br/>
them so you can understand WHY they want to write that their brother is <br/>
stupid and WHY they were trying to trick you into doing something you <br/>
didn&#39;t want to do (ie, write that the brother was stupid) and thereby <br/>
facilitating the other brother&#39;s being mean to the younger brother.  I <br/>
mean, there&#39;s a Whole LOT of discussion that needs to go on about that with <br/>
the child in question (and not in a mean way, but in a gently inquisitive <br/>
way, to find out what they&#39;re thinking and how they got to think that <br/>
way.)  Then you both/all need to talk about how it&#39;s making you, the mommy, <br/>
feel.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also suggest doing some work on family inter-dependence, that is, <br/>
emphasizing how one family member can be affected by another family member <br/>
because of the love within the family and talking about it with great <br/>
concern for BOTH parties (because after all, if family won&#39;t stick up for <br/>
or care for family, what&#39;s left?)  If one child &#39;doesn&#39;t want to hear it&#39;, <br/>
maybe say, &quot;I am very sad when you hurt my family and I need to talk with <br/>
you about it.   Hurting your brother makes my heart cry.  I&#39;m tired of <br/>
being hurt and I need you to stop.  I don&#39;t know how to stop feeling the <br/>
hurt.  Will you help me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think some of it is that the middle (and teasing) child is looking <br/>
for more attention from you?  If so, maybe make some dedicated time for <br/>
just Mom-and-middle-child, say 10 or 15 minutes solid when NOTHING will <br/>
pull you away from talking to him and playing with him, and doing whatever <br/>
he wants to do.  If another child needs you, tell them that you&#39;re with <br/>
this child now and you&#39;ll be there in a while.  Ignore the phone. <br/>
Etc.  Just you and he, every day, for a certain time (and this goes for <br/>
EACH of the children.)<br/>
<br/>
As for the daughter, I&#39;d have told the 3 year old that he didn&#39;t have to go <br/>
inside, but that his sister was scared about being alone does he remember <br/>
how it feels when he is scared?  Well, he and mommy are going to help her <br/>
be not so scared and if he didn&#39;t want to go inside, then he could stay in <br/>
the car (with the windows cracked) but that you were going inside to help <br/>
sister feel not so scared and would watch him from the window.  Ask him <br/>
Does he want to bring a book or a toy for the car?  Then I&#39;d plop myself in <br/>
the front window where I&#39;d be with my daughter and could wave (and make <br/>
funny faces) to my son, out in the car.  Maybe make it focus on taking care <br/>
of (and relating to) someone else when they&#39;re feeling badly.<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, we have a tradition of, &quot;if you cause the pain, you take <br/>
care of it &#39;tll it&#39;s gone.&quot;  If I hurt someone, I need to stay with that <br/>
someone until they&#39;re okay again, and take care of them and get them ice or <br/>
hugs or whatever they need to be okay again.  This goes for physical as <br/>
well as emotional owies and it gives people a way to stop being the <br/>
&#39;meanie&#39; and become the &#39;caring person&#39;.   No Guilt.  No <br/>
recriminations.  Just taking care.  You&#39;ve got to help them do it (sweetly) <br/>
the first few times, but later on, they&#39;ll generally move to do it on their <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  There&#39;s so much more, but without knowing your kids, I&#39;d be <br/>
whistling into the wind more than I am already!<br/>

standing right outside the car, then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea <br/>
to leave a 3 and a 5 year old in a car alone. You can&#39;t watch from <br/>
the window and really be there for the daughter at the same time. <br/>
From where I stand, not a good idea. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-91544696">Hey Sheila...my boys are 6 and 3 and I am starting to have a problem with name calling too.<br/>
I have been taking a two pronged approach...one talking about how it makes the other<br/>
feel (being nice to each other, not hurting their feelings etc). The second being taking<br/>
a humorous approach. The other day, Jason (6 yo) started calling Kyle (3 yo) stupid.<br/>
I looked at him and said, wait a minute...are you telling me that I have a stupid child?<br/>
Wait a minute...I don&#39;t remember giving birth to any stupid children. Where did that stupid<br/>
kid go, I can&#39;t find him, he isn&#39;t around here, I only see smart sweet kids...etc. Jason <br/>
started laughing and stopped the name calling. Then today<br/>
they started into calling each other names in the backseat of the van. So I joined in! I <br/>
pretended to get really excited about our new game and called Jason a big fat broccoli<br/>
head. Then called Kyle a cauliflower poo-poo head. They LOVED it, kept asking me to<br/>
call them more names. Then when Jason started calling Kyle a stupid freak, I pointed out<br/>
how that was more personal and could be mean. We also talked about how it was ok to call<br/>
each other names for fun, but if it hurt the others feelings then we had stop.<br/>
<br/>
Jason has also started cutting Kyle down when Kyle is not as good at something (like a <br/>
computer game etc) so we have been having lots of talks about how just because someone does<br/>
not know something/is not good at something does not mean that they are stupid. That often<br/>
they just do not have the as much experience at something as someone else (using the example<br/>
that mommy is better then Jason at many things but that does not make Jason stupid or dumb.<br/>
That as he (and Kyle) get older they will get better at many things).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that there is one answer for this...just keep talking and for us turning it into<br/>
a joke has worked well. I think that it is also important to tell the kids that it is ok to<br/>
be mad at/not like each other at times but it is not ok to cut the other down or be mean to<br/>
each other. I have been trying to give them acceptable ways of expressing their feelings.<br/>
It sure can be hard to listen to sometimes though!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296245896">One thing my MIL taught me is to make it more miserable for the kids<br/>
when they&#39;re doing something you don&#39;t want them to do. For example,<br/>
we&#39;ve had trouble with scissors in our house this year with my daughter<br/>
and her cousin. It started when they cut off my daughter&#39;s long<br/>
beautiful hair. They also cut the cord on the blinds, and cut up a few<br/>
things in the house. In short order they were banned from scissors.<br/>
Recently they were doing a craft with our Japanese student, and they<br/>
were left with scissors, and alas, again cut something. This time our<br/>
futon chair cover. They are 4 and 5 years old - so they&#39;re certainly old<br/>
enough to know that this isn&#39;t a good choice. I got mad at them and then<br/>
I told them if they cannot make good choices when no one is watching<br/>
them, then they would have to be watched all the time. I made them stick<br/>
right by my side. When I was working on the computer they sat on the<br/>
floor beside me reading a book. Then I made them come downstairs to get<br/>
a load of laundry. We&#39;d sit in the family room to fold it and I let them<br/>
watch TV while I did it - but I would purposefully get up right when<br/>
they were really getting into it and say, &quot;Okay. Time to go into the<br/>
kitchen.&quot; Or wherever. They didn&#39;t dare complain because they knew the<br/>
gravity of what they had done and knew they didn&#39;t have any room for<br/>
negotiation. We only had to do this for about 3 hours until they begged<br/>
me to trust them again. So we did it for the next 3 hours in a little<br/>
more limited sense. The lesson stuck. We haven&#39;t had a problem with<br/>
scissors for a long time. <br/>
 <br/>
When my husband and his siblings weren&#39;t getting along my MIL would make<br/>
them hold hands or sit on chairs with their knees touching, until they<br/>
talked and solved whatever the problem was. I&#39;m actually quite amazed at<br/>
how they get along in his family. They just were plain not allowed to be<br/>
unkind to each other. It doesn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t have<br/>
disagreements - but unkindness was not tolerated. I hope we can do that<br/>
in our family with our children as well.<br/>
 <br/>
Another thing that comes to my mind is to have a theme of the week or<br/>
day, or whatever seems appropriate. Have a phrase that you ask them to<br/>
say to you. For example, my daughter has one lately that she got from a<br/>
book that says, &quot;I&#39;ll be happy all day if I obey.&quot; I&#39;m surprised<br/>
actually how many times she comes back to the little quip. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
something I started - she got it out of a book - but she has really made<br/>
it stick in her mind and the process has made me think it might be<br/>
worthwhile to come up with some more of those in our home. Not sure what<br/>
they&#39;ll be yet. I&#39;d like something right now that helps them remember to<br/>
clean up toys!! But that&#39;s an entirely different thread. :0)<br/>
 <br/>
Good for you for reaching out and asking for help. Some people just<br/>
figure kids fight and that&#39;s life. I don&#39;t think it has to be that way.<br/>
 <br/>

I&#39;d also suggest doing some work on family inter-dependence, that is, <br/>
emphasizing how one family member can be affected by another family<br/>
member <br/>
because of the love within the family and talking about it with great <br/>
concern for BOTH parties (because after all, if family won&#39;t stick up<br/>
for <br/>
or care for family, what&#39;s left?)  If one child &#39;doesn&#39;t want to hear<br/>
it&#39;, <br/>
maybe say, &quot;I am very sad when you hurt my family and I need to talk<br/>
with <br/>
you about it.   Hurting your brother makes my heart cry.  I&#39;m tired of <br/>
being hurt and I need you to stop.  I don&#39;t know how to stop feeling the<br/>
<br/>
hurt.  Will you help me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think some of it is that the middle (and teasing) child is<br/>
looking <br/>
for more attention from you?  If so, maybe make some dedicated time for <br/>
just Mom-and-middle-child, say 10 or 15 minutes solid when NOTHING will <br/>
pull you away from talking to him and playing with him, and doing<br/>
whatever <br/>
he wants to do.  If another child needs you, tell them that you&#39;re with <br/>
this child now and you&#39;ll be there in a while.  Ignore the phone. <br/>
Etc.  Just you and he, every day, for a certain time (and this goes for <br/>
EACH of the children.)<br/>
<br/>
As for the daughter, I&#39;d have told the 3 year old that he didn&#39;t have to<br/>
go <br/>
inside, but that his sister was scared about being alone does he<br/>
remember <br/>
how it feels when he is scared?  Well, he and mommy are going to help<br/>
her <br/>
be not so scared and if he didn&#39;t want to go inside, then he could stay<br/>
in <br/>
the car (with the windows cracked) but that you were going inside to<br/>
help <br/>
sister feel not so scared and would watch him from the window.  Ask him <br/>
Does he want to bring a book or a toy for the car?  Then I&#39;d plop myself<br/>
in <br/>
the front window where I&#39;d be with my daughter and could wave (and make <br/>
funny faces) to my son, out in the car.  Maybe make it focus on taking<br/>
care <br/>
of (and relating to) someone else when they&#39;re feeling badly.<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, we have a tradition of, &quot;if you cause the pain, you<br/>
take <br/>
care of it &#39;tll it&#39;s gone.&quot;  If I hurt someone, I need to stay with that<br/>
<br/>
someone until they&#39;re okay again, and take care of them and get them ice<br/>
or <br/>
hugs or whatever they need to be okay again.  This goes for physical as <br/>
well as emotional owies and it gives people a way to stop being the <br/>
&#39;meanie&#39; and become the &#39;caring person&#39;.   No Guilt.  No <br/>
recriminations.  Just taking care.  You&#39;ve got to help them do it<br/>
(sweetly) <br/>
the first few times, but later on, they&#39;ll generally move to do it on<br/>
their <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  There&#39;s so much more, but without knowing your kids, I&#39;d be <br/>
whistling into the wind more than I am already!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175805402">I really liked all of Heidi&#39;s suggestions, and wanted to second the one about <br/>
offering to let him stay in the car outside the party long enough to get the <br/>
daughter comfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
I would have said &quot;I need to go into the party.  Do you want to go too, or <br/>
would you rather stay in the car?&quot;  And saying it nicely, it seems to give <br/>
him a range of options, but it&#39;s not much option, and that&#39;s okay with me <br/>
when one child is really  needing something.  <br/>
<br/>
If it were people I knew well, there might have been someone in the house who <br/>
knew my son and could go and visit with him at the car window for a while.  <br/>
That&#39;s happened with us in the past.  one kid&#39;s not ready to go, the other is <br/>
outside waiting, we find someone to send out to play or whatever.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I hear <br/>
way too many things about kids being left in cars for just a minute <br/>
and the parent could see the child from where ever. Unless you are <br/>
standing right outside the car, then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea <br/>
to leave a 3 and a 5 year old in a car alone. You can&#39;t watch from <br/>
the window and really be there for the daughter at the same time. <br/>
From where I stand, not a good idea.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

In the book, the mother, when asked by her daughter if she broke their eggs,<br/>

about their friend not obeying and so the word stuck with them.  The DVD was <br/>
wonderful except for that because it reinforced that the Mama would still <br/>
love the girl even if she were angry.<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of when I broke my ankle and a friend dropped off some videos her <br/>
child had outgrown.  One was The Elephant&#39;s Child, a Kipling story.  We had <br/>
listened to an audio tape of the Just So stories on on car trip over <br/>
Christmas, so we also got the same story out of the library.  My children had <br/>
never heard the word spank before that and suddenly they were using it all <br/>
the time.  The elehant in the story gets spanked a lot for asking too many <br/>
questions.  We had a long talk about that too.  My daughter sometimes still <br/>
has her dinosaurs spanking her farm animals.<br/>

department unless they have a really forceful personality.  The younger one<br/>
still takes a lot of mom&#39;s time, and the older one can do all kinds of stuff<br/>

&gt;Any specific ideas for working on family inter-dependence?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really.  Maybe someone else would.  I suppose I think it&#39;s all so <br/>
situational that it&#39;s difficult to really come up with something without <br/>
being in the situation.<br/>
<br/>
My kids never really bugged each other too much, as we&#39;d really worked on <br/>
respecting each other and recognizing what was hurtful/not hurtful since <br/>
they were very, very little.  We also used to play &#39;Is that important?&quot; to <br/>
see if what they were arguing over was really as important as they felt it <br/>
was or was there another way around it?  (which let them both talk about <br/>
why something is important to them (or sometimes, why it turned out to not <br/>
be so important.)<br/>
<br/>
The worst situation that comes to my mind was once, when my kids were 7 and <br/>
9ish, (they&#39;d been bickering for a while and had just had a real <br/>
knock-down, screamy fight, over &#39;nothing&#39; at all! - and I was SO mad I was <br/>
tear-ing up) I remember saying to them that I was really, really, really <br/>
upset and that someday when they&#39;re adults, I wasn&#39;t going to be around <br/>
anymore and it would be the two of them out there together in the world and <br/>
if they *can&#39;t* count on each other as brother and sister to protect each <br/>
other and love each other, who *would* they be able to count on?!  and that <br/>
maybe they&#39;d want to give that some thought.  (then left the room to cool <br/>
down.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if it was the best way of going about it, but it worked for my <br/>
kids at that particular moment in time.  It might have been that I usually <br/>
didn&#39;t blow up over things like this, so maybe the shock of it made them <br/>
stop and think.  I&#39;d like to hope they wanted someone (besides Mom) who&#39;d <br/>
back them up unconditionally and care about them no-matter-what - and maybe <br/>
that meant *not* bugging the snot out of each other now...<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I guess I just made a point out of doing nice things for them <br/>
&#39;because they&#39;re family&#39; and every now and then enlisting one of them in <br/>
helping me do something nice for one of their sibs or their dad, &#39;because <br/>
they&#39;re family&#39;.  They seemed to like surprising folks like that.  ...and <br/>
it&#39;s another way to feel good about caring for people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure someone out there has some better suggestions, eh?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yesterday and today I made a conscious effort to<br/>
&gt;give him some of my undivided attention and I have seen a behavior<br/>
&gt;improvement already. :)  THANK YOU!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rock ON!  I&#39;ll bet that feels tremendous.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If the child doesn&#39;t want to &quot;take the hurt away&quot;, isn&#39;t it punitive<br/>
&gt;to make the child take care of the other child?  I can&#39;t see it<br/>
&gt;working here anyway.  I can see myself &quot;making&quot; a child hug another<br/>
&gt;child.  I would have to wrap their arms around the other child, hold<br/>
&gt;their feet back from kicking while doing it, keep their teeth from<br/>
&gt;biting while hugging, and keep my hands over their fists to keep<br/>
&gt;them from pinching/hitting/scratching while hugging.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, nononononooooo....  Not like that.  You&#39;re right that THAT would be <br/>
disastrous!  ...and it&#39;s never meant to be punitive, or imply guilt or <br/>
etc.  The injuring child is only injuring because they can&#39;t figure out how <br/>
else to deal with whatever it is that they can&#39;t deal with.  Why punish him <br/>
more?  He&#39;s already not able to deal!  The idea is to help him learn to <br/>
care-take too, and make it feel better than hurting.<br/>
<br/>
So, if they can&#39;t do it themselves, do it for them.. that is, YOU sit with <br/>
the injured child and hug them.  No dirty looks at the injurer.  No <br/>
recriminations.  No attention at all, at first.  Just focus on making the <br/>
hurt go away for the injured.  Maybe ask the injuring child to go get YOU <br/>
some ice (not for the sibling) and if they get it, thank them kindly and <br/>
gently mention *To The Injured Child* how their brother is helping you <br/>
&#39;take the hurt away&#39;.  Don&#39;t talk about &#39;sorry&#39; or &#39;forgiveness&#39; at <br/>
all.  Talk with the injured child about how they&#39;re doing and what you can <br/>
do to make the hurt get better.  Rock them a little where they are, on the <br/>
floor.  Maybe ask the injuring child to sit next to you and snuggle you <br/>
(make you feel better?)   Make no mention of the injured child to the <br/>
injuring child.  YOU snuggle the injured child and form a barrier of sorts <br/>
between the two, gradually eliminating the barrier until you&#39;re hugging <br/>
them both at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
...and of course, if you ever, inadvertently &#39;hurt&#39; one of the kids or a <br/>
pet, make a big fuss over &#39;taking the hurt away!&#39;  Show by example.  (and <br/>
do it with inanimate objects as well, in a smaller way.  Did they break a <br/>
vase?  &quot;Here, I&#39;ll get the broom and dustpan.  Do you want me to help you <br/>
sweep that up?  I&#39;ll bet that was pretty scary when you realized it was <br/>
going to break!  Should we put it in the inside or outside trash do you <br/>
think?  There&#39;s some pretty sharp pieces, aren&#39;t there?&quot;)  Come to think of <br/>
it, maybe the best way would be to start him off with animals (caring for <br/>
hurt ones), and compliment the heck out of how he&#39;s so gentle and caring.<br/>
<br/>
You *do* make notice of when he&#39;s being lovely to his sibs, right?  Catch <br/>
&#39;em being good.  Catch &#39;em caring.<br/>
