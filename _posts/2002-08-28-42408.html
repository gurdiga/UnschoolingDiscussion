  I totally agree with this, and it&#39;s not that I think guns are evil or some such -- just deserving of caution and a degree of respect.  The kids actually took knife safety and gun safety, and own their own Moro knives (a real wood whittlin&#39;, survival type item -- not as cool as a dagger but still potentially dangerous) from their time in Junior Forest Wardens.  They also use sharp knives in the kitchen, and have from the time they were three (thanks to The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff). I am still quite new to this unschooling thing, and evolving gradually.  Thanks for everyone&#39;s patience as I try to &quot;get it&quot;.   Debi<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114175059"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The trust between parent and child is worth way more than any rules about toy<br/>
&gt; weapons, and when moms are calling all the rules and making dire predictions<br/>
&gt; and shaming their kids, pretty much those predictions turn out NOT to be<br/>
&gt; true, and so the child&#39;s trust in the mother erodes a little.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s a lot to be considered about a child&#39;s age when banning<br/>
weapons or other things, too.  We banned toy guns when Tim was very young.<br/>
I think a little kid is too young to be able to judge the difference between<br/>
a toy and the real thing, and I didn&#39;t want him picking one up.  Part of my<br/>
fears may be related to my community; many military members own personal<br/>
weapons.  Most store them safely, but all it takes is one who doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I can easily see how things change in many areas as a child becomes more<br/>
able to reason and be responsible.  At 6, my son has had swords for years.<br/>
He&#39;s never asked for a gun.  I would consider a florescent green one now!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I had a no guns rule for - hmm, had to stop and think, here - for something<br/>
&gt;close to 22 years of parenting. It held up until I finally had a kid who<br/>
&gt;persisted and persisted and PERSISTED in being fascinated with guns in spite<br/>
&gt;of prohibitions, rules, discussions, pleas, more discussions...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A friend of mine who abhorred guns had a young son who adored guns and was <br/>
also absolutely fascinated with them.  She could see that she had to yield <br/>
in some way to his intense attraction and feed his head about this.  Here&#39;s <br/>
one of the things she did.  I was so impressed:   She brought him to their <br/>
local police station and asked the cops there to talk with her son about <br/>
guns, to answer all his questions, and show him how they worked.  Because <br/>
of his fascination, he did not allow any shyness to interfere with this <br/>
opportunity and he asked many questions.  They spent a long time there.  I <br/>
think it was a benefit for all.<br/>
<br/>
I was so grateful to her for doing this because she inspired me (my son was <br/>
tiny at the time) to look at everything as an opportunity, not just the <br/>
things that attract me, but much more importantly, the things that attract <br/>
my son.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, this past summer we were witnesses to a small car accident <br/>
that a police office was also invited to.  The cop was a real nice man.  My <br/>
son was mighty shy, but he had never seen a cop up close before and had <br/>
lots of questions for me about the policeman, his car and his uniform, and <br/>
- of course - his gun.  He was too  shy to speak directly with the cop at <br/>
first, so I asked all the questions Liam had until he felt comfortable <br/>
enough to ask them on his own.  The cop was just wonderful and took quite a <br/>
bit of time to show us stuff and answer Liam&#39;s questions in great <br/>
detail.  My favorite was this.<br/>
<br/>
Liam:  What do you use your gun for?<br/>
<br/>
Cop:  I hope I never use it.  I use it to protect me first and you <br/>
second.  But, it&#39;s the very last thing I&#39;ll use, not the first.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he proceeded to tell us about the techniques he will use before he <br/>
will reach for his gun (he had an interesting pepper spray story that Liam <br/>
and I still talk about).<br/>
<br/>
This talk that we had was impressive enough to Liam that he will bring up <br/>
aspects of it from time to time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138986029">My 10 year old son loves guns, he has realistic guns<br/>
and water guns.  He makes his own guns and enhances<br/>
guns with recyclable materials around the house like<br/>
paper towel and toilet paper holders.  He has built<br/>
telescopes on his guns, it is amazing to me how<br/>
creative he is.  I purchased a book called the The<br/>
History of Weapons and he loves it  <br/>
<br/>
We talk about what real guns do to people and we watch<br/>
movies about war and he sees what guns do to people. <br/>
He also knows that you don&#39;t point a gun at another<br/>
and that we do not take realistic guns out of the<br/>
house.  I don&#39;t believe a gun makes a violent person. <br/>
I believe some boys are either hunters or farmers. <br/>
And that is an instinctual thing.  We would have had<br/>
to be one or the other in order for our race to<br/>
survive.  I often wonder if by denying their interest<br/>
in guns is going against their nature, it is in my<br/>
son&#39;s case.  <br/>
<br/>
Lack of respect and love trying to control those<br/>
things lead to violence.  Going against what is<br/>
natural is also violence.  Check out the summer issue<br/>

we ate what we got. Please don&#39;t take this as a criticism. I tell this to <br/>
anyone who says they watch movies about war with their children so they see <br/>
what guns do to people. <br/>
Obviously you know that movies aren&#39;t real. BUT sometimes people think that <br/>
some of the things portrayed in movies are. One thing most movies don&#39;t do is <br/>
show, realistically, what guns do to people who have been shot. My cousin was <br/>
shot by an abusive exboyfriend. Part of his defense at his trial was that he <br/>
didn&#39;t know he had actually shot her and killed her because when the gun went <br/>
off she didn&#39;t fall backwards or go flying backwards like in the movies. <br/>
(sick, I know.) He said she got a shocked look on her face and sat down. He <br/>
left, because he said he thought he had just *scared her real good.* He said <br/>
that had he known that she was injured he would have helped her. So I tell <br/>
people this because I want people to know that just because in movies people <br/>
stumble around, moan and groan, fly backwards, and all that, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
always happen like that in real life. <br/>
