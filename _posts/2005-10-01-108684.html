<div id="ygrps-yiv-212534594">I have grown up always overweight and continue to struggle with my <br/>
weight to this day. My mom & dad were normal weight.  I&#39;m adopted <br/>
and happen to know my birth mother.  She was overweight all of her <br/>
life too, as are one of my sisters and 2 brothers.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little my adopted mom would take me to the doctor and he <br/>
would put me on a diet....  I was just a kid and I learned at a very <br/>
young age the something was wrong with me.  I ate too much <br/>
(according to the doctor).  That was the beginning of my troubles.<br/>
<br/>
Now at 51 yo I&#39;m beginning to understand my issues with food and my <br/>
weight.  Limiting food is not the answer, because it puts the <br/>
emphasis on the food and her weight.  <br/>
<br/>
With my 11 yo dtr, I&#39;m very careful about not saying anything about <br/>
her weight or eating.  She goes through growth spurts and eats like <br/>
a horse and then just eats a little until the next cycle of growth.<br/>
<br/>
She is not over weight and does not seem to have any issues with her <br/>
weight like I did.  But, I let her eat what she wants, when she <br/>
wants and however much she feels she needs.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends who don&#39;t let their kids eat candy at home and I have <br/>
witnessed those same children consuming large amounts of candy and <br/>
junk when their parents aren&#39;t around.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is take the issue off of her food, <br/>
her weight, help her to become a little more active and let her work <br/>
it our herself.  I&#39;m a testament to one who is screwed up because of <br/>
diets - they don&#39;t work.<br/>

I agree totally here.  Take the focus off food and work to make changes in<br/>
your lives that include more physical exercise.  Set a good example for the<br/>
kids and have your own exercise routine.  There are so many fun things to<br/>
choose from that something should strike your fancy.  (I love Leslie Sansone<br/>
low impact aerobic tapes.  I can do them mindlessly 6 days a week and<br/>
although they aren&#39;t very strenuous, they make a huge impact in how I feel.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been heavier and more inactive than was healthy at different times in<br/>
my life.  I love to eat for the taste of food alone, not to mention the<br/>
comfort it gives me and the fact that I can&#39;t stand being hungry. I have<br/>
found that with even a moderate level of moving each day I can eat a quite a<br/>
lot of food and not gain weight.  Aerobic exercise ups your metabolism. It<br/>
also took away the constant pain I had in my lower back.  I am not rail<br/>
thin.  I wear a size 12/14 but I feel healthy and strong.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep searching until you find something you like to do.  (and your dd too,<br/>
but setting a good example is probably more important for a lifetime.) Maybe<br/>
get a gps and go on hikes to find geocaches if you need a reason to get<br/>
moving.  If life is interesting enough, she probably won&#39;t eat to fill a<br/>
void, she&#39;ll eat when she needs it.  Keep life interesting and keep moving.<br/>
