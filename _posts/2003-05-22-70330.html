<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007113558">Perhaps it&#39;s the circles I travel in. But it&#39;s beginning to look like <br/>
everyone else in the world, at least the homeschoolers and many of the <br/>
schoolers, has gifted kids. I know because their moms tell me. Many of them <br/>
assume my kid is too, apparently, so they&#39;re not telling me to show off. Even <br/>
the Unschooling moms mention their children&#39;s giftedness. <br/>
<br/>
Is my kid gifted? I dunno. He did really well on the one standardized test he <br/>
took while he was in school (enough that I pictured years of being told that <br/>
he &quot;wasn&#39;t working to his potential.&quot; I think he&#39;s a very talented musician, <br/>
and sometimes when he sings he&#39;s so good I can barely breathe. I&#39;m not really <br/>
sure why it matters one way or another, and I would think that constantly <br/>
being told how &quot;gifted&quot; you are would get annoying at the least, and an <br/>
overwhelming burden that could ultimately crush you at the most.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, doesn&#39;t &quot;giftedness&quot; imply that&#39;s your abilities and talents only <br/>
yours because someone or something (God? DNA? The Gifted Fairy?) deemed you <br/>
worthy and decided to give it to you? I suppose if you look at it from a <br/>
spiritual perspective, it&#39;s kind of nice, especially if you take the <br/>
&quot;everyone wins&quot; attitude and assume that Everyone is Gifted, and needs to <br/>
find their own gifts. If that&#39;s true, then shouldn&#39;t you be proud instead <br/>
that little Mimi or Gordon discovered and are nurturing their gifts?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m just rambling, but I&#39;ve just been so startled by this <br/>
lately...it&#39;s EVERYWHERE!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633865920">Gifted in school just means you aren&#39;t running with the pack, you are ahead.<br/>
For me as a kid it meant I got to do more challenging work and not be bored,<br/>
bored, bored.  But it did mean being singled out.  They offered to skip me<br/>
fifth grade and send me straight to the middle school, but I opted not to<br/>
and did gifted work in fifth instead.<br/>
<br/>
Without the structure of grades, etc, gifted (to me anyway) means that<br/>
someone has an area or ability they are particularly good at.  Like my 7<br/>
year old is way good at math and spacial stuff.  We did &quot;second grade&quot; math<br/>
in a day.  Literally.  I sat down next to him with the book and he worked<br/>
every single problem in his head.  I think he missed like 5 in a whole grade<br/>
level?  He&#39;s great with remembering where things are and how to reach things<br/>
in his video games.  His dad&#39;s the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m good with words--read like a fiend.  I&#39;m not allowed to buy 25 dollar<br/>
hardbacks because I read them in 4 hours.  TOPS.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby and I have joked that if he got both of our gift sets, the kid would<br/>
be a genius.  -grin-  (I scored 750 verbal, 500 math on the SAT, Joe the<br/>
opposite.  So if he got the two highs....-evil grin-)<br/>
<br/>
But to my mind, those are GIFTS.  You can develop those gifts to their<br/>
highest potentional or you can just enjoy them for what they are.  I am<br/>
going to offer to James to do third grade math the same way we did<br/>
second--sitting together over the book.  I thnk he&#39;ll love it--the closeness<br/>
and the problems.  He&#39;s proud of being good at it.<br/>
<br/>
But frankly, he&#39;s just as proud of his long (mid back length) dark brown<br/>
hair.  It&#39;s gorgeous.  He put up with all the &quot;but that&#39;s a girl&quot; comments<br/>
because he likes it so much.<br/>
<br/>
Some other kid&#39;s gift may be the ability to look at a situation and see<br/>
clearly and quickly how all the people involved are emotionall effected.<br/>
That level of empathy is a gift, too, in my mind and equally important.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499604014">I believe that we are ALL gifted in one way or another and its just a matter of discovering our gifts.  Why would G-d create us any other way?  (Sorry to interject my religious beliefs there, but for me they are related subjects).<br/>
<br/>
Schools have created this artificial pecking order by separating people out, not just to be placed in the &#39;slow&#39; group, but also in the &#39;gifted&#39; group.<br/>
<br/>
I hear it from homeschoolers all the time too and it irritates me, not because I think they are bragging necessarily, but because they took their kids out of school to &quot;avoid labels&quot;.  Then, as soon as its &quot;giftedness&quot; they snatch that label right up and give it to their kids.  I guess they still need that &quot;recognition&quot; that school type stuff gives them but it just seems hypocritical to me.<br/>
<br/>
It also irritates me because it causes unnecessary and unhealthy competition between kids, both friends and siblings.  And it can cause competition between parents as well.<br/>

<br/>
I hate it.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right.  It&#39;s harmful to the kids too.<br/>
<br/>
AND I think labelling someone &quot;gifted at math&quot; commits them to a lifetime of <br/>
mathematical excellence and showmanship.  Maybe they discover some patterns <br/>
and are quick and remember numbers (I&#39;m thinking of Holly) but will tire it and <br/>
not give a rat&#39;s patoot, or puberty will come and distract them or uncover a <br/>
whole NEW gift they didn&#39;t have as a littler kid.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to stick the pin in them too early.  They might change and evolve <br/>
their whole lives!!<br/>
<br/>
My best memories of meeting strangers and chatting are when their stories are <br/>
like &quot;Well I grew up in the circus, but I was really interested in the <br/>
trucks, so I became a driver instead of a trapeze artist, but when I was driving <br/>
through Wyoming I fell in love with the landscape so I worked on a ranch, and <br/>
started collecting brands and barbed wire, and now I&#39;m a <br/>
sculptor/welder/blacksmith.&quot;  Stuff like that.  Conversations with someone who&#39;s about to retire after <br/>
teaching for 35 years, or about to retire after being an engineer for 25 <br/>
years... boring.  Stability isn&#39;t my goal or desire.<br/>
<br/>
AND FURTHERMORE!  When a mom comes and says with snoot &quot;Well, unschooling is <br/>
fine for YOUR kids, but mine are *gifted* and so they require more focussed <br/>
attention since *they* will never settle for normal,&quot;  the choice of those who <br/>
read is to say &quot;Yeah, my kids are duds,&quot; or &quot;Actually mine are running mental <br/>
circles around yours and they don&#39;t even know it,&quot; or &quot;What?  If you had been <br/>
in gifted programs you&#39;d know better,&quot; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Giftedness proponents will only listen to others who are &quot;gifted.&quot;  If you <br/>
say &quot;Well speaking as a normal person...&quot; they will say either you&#39;re jealous or <br/>
you just don&#39;t understand.  If you give them any Mensa-type SAT/IQ crap, THEN <br/>
they might listen, but by doing that, you would fall into their pit of <br/>
nonsense.<br/>

  This really spoke to me. My dd loves writing and art and has always impressed people with her ability. She is coming up 15 and suddenly her writing passion is faltering some. Could be permanent, could be temporary.<br/>
  She was really upset by this and I realised that based on all our judgements of her &quot; precociousness&quot; in tthese areas she had placed herself as having to be a writer/artist and was worried that she would be failing somehow if this changes. <br/>
  We were able to discuss living in the moment and accepting herself as she is right now, trusting that her body will help her know where she needs to be. <br/>
