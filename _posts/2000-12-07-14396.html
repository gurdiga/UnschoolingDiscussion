<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536152140">In some cases.  But by this definition, a school may require a <br/>
certain number of course to be completed, but the student decides <br/>
which ones.  To me, unschooling means providing the resources to <br/>
allow a student to follow their own interests and the parent/staff <br/>
member there to facilitate that learning.  At Cascade Valley <br/>
School, I am facilitating a reading group on the book &quot;The Tao of <br/>
Physics&quot;.  This would most likely never be a class &quot;offered&quot; <br/>
anywhere.  It was the idea of the students in the school to study <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, one must at least put options out there, but one must <br/>
also not constrict to certain options, fostering the independent <br/>
intellectual freedom of the child. <br/>

the institutions are remaking individuals to meet the <br/>
