<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591236230">A counsellor once said something that helped me to accept my parents,<br/>
instead of continually hoping they would change and finally be doting<br/>
parents or grandparents.  She said expecting them to be healthy parents was<br/>
like trying to get toy poodles pulls a dog sled in the Itidarod.  That<br/>
visual helped me to finally start to &quot;let go&quot; of those expectations.  I read<br/>
somewhere that the younger a child is, the more forgiving they often are.<br/>
Also, that the more a parent does actually change for the better, the easier<br/>
it is for kids to forgive, whether asked for forgiveness or not.<br/>
<br/>
If I could have seen my molester truly change, that would have helped a lot.<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t have hurt to hear him acknowledge his actions and ask my<br/>
forgiveness.  Instead, he denied it all, did it to others, and tried to make<br/>
us feel like we were the perverts.  I was entitled to my anger and to<br/>
working it out on my own timetable.  Now, 30 years later, it&#39;s like it<br/>
happened to someone else in another lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
I still have a lot of fear issues and find that I&#39;m hyper-vigilant with my<br/>
own girls.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; The sadness, hurt and anger you may have felt as a child were<br/>
&gt; legitimate emotions. I think trying to forgive keeps you trapped as that<br/>
little child that has to somehow still believe that her parent loves her, in<br/>
spite of the evidence to the contrary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t feel like their little child.  I know my feelings were legitimate<br/>
and valid.  My Dad loves me as best HE can -- my standard is just higher.<br/>
My Mom loves me, and has really come far in apologizing for her ways, tho<br/>
she&#39;s not entirely there yet.  Someday, she will be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ********<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tried for years to truly forgive my Dad for the things he did to me. It<br/>
never really worked. I get along with him fine now and can enjoy his<br/>
company. He has to treat me with respect now that I am an adult. The<br/>
relationship is different, he is still the same person, and he (as always)<br/>
professes to love me.<br/>
&gt; ********<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Forgiveness, to me, doesn&#39;t mean his actions were right, or that I<br/>
overreacted.  It simply means I&#39;ve chosen not to be angry about them<br/>
anymore; not to blame my Dad for my lot in life; not to brand him<br/>
unacceptable (tho there are limits imposed by me to his relationships with<br/>
my children).  Forgiveness doesn&#39;t mean the offender is free to repeat his<br/>
wrongs, only that the person wronged has let go of the anger and pain.  Of<br/>
course, your interpretation may be different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have negotiated a reasonably comfortable relationship with my Dad, and<br/>
it was my choice to do that.  I would not have been able to do that had I<br/>
not forgiven him -- it&#39;s just how I&#39;m wired.  I&#39;ve learned a lot about my<br/>
Dad&#39;s childhood and early adulthood in the last 20 years.  I now understand<br/>
how he got so damaged. I felt I had to do that, because one of my sons is<br/>
very innately like the good parts of my Dad, and it scared me.  Sadly, their<br/>
shared qualities weren&#39;t seen as such when Dad was a young boy.  Gary & I<br/>
joke that Andy is my Dad with love and honesty.  I am determined to make<br/>
Andy&#39;s life so much more than my Dad&#39;s is/was.  To do that, I needed to<br/>
understand my Dad.<br/>

<br/>
It helps a LOT in the area of forgiveness if the person wants forgiveness.<br/>
It helps if the person is sorry.<br/>
And it helps, at first, if they apologize.<br/>
But if they apologize regularly, then repeat the behavior, and apologize <br/>
again, and repeat the behavior, the apologies start to be meaningless.  And <br/>
unfortunately substance abusers are some of the worst in that area. Their sober self <br/>
IS griefstricken at what their drunk or stoned self did.  But unless they <br/>
stop drinking or using drugs, it&#39;s hard to forgive.<br/>
<br/>
But the &quot;resolve&quot; thing can work.  You can encapsulate them in your mind as a <br/>
person who did the best he could do under the circumstances, and just figure <br/>
out how to keep your own self-image separate and to keep your kids safer from <br/>
the problem than you were.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a kind of forgiveness.  At least you can get clear about what wasn&#39;t <br/>
your own fault, so you can move on and away from it.<br/>
