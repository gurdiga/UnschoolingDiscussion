<div id="ygrps-yiv-778424475">My children are still very young (4 and 1) but I&#39;ve been thinking about this <br/>
topic lately as many of my sons friends will be starting school in the fall.  <br/>
He went to preschool this year (a 2 hour playgroup &quot;school&quot; run by a friend of <br/>
mine) but by the end of the year was asking to stay home and play with us or <br/>
just go to the park so he stayed home on those days.<br/>
<br/>
He hasn&#39;t asked about riding the bus yet but does comment on the bus when it <br/>
drives past several times a day.  He knows I used to be a teacher so he talks <br/>
about &quot;big kid school&quot; sometimes too.   I imagine that if he ever expresses an <br/>
interest in the bus, we can arrange a ride on one.  <br/>
<br/>
We have been talking alot (no- not alot, just sometimes when the subject of <br/>
school comes up) that some kids go to school and some don&#39;t.  He told me the <br/>
other day that &quot;there are lots of ways to learn new stuff- you can read a book <br/>
about it, or learn stuff from TV, or from your mom, or at school.&quot;  I said- or <br/>
when you&#39;re playing too, and he was like &quot;yeah, then too!&quot;.  (I was <br/>
particulary PROUD of him at this point!  and wondering why if a 4 yr old can figure that <br/>
out, so many adults can&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also read one picture book from the library about a little girl who is <br/>
homeschooled that talked about her day and what she does with her family at <br/>
home and in the community instead of going to school.  This was appropriate for <br/>
a young child- maybe as an alternate to all of the &quot;Kindergarten&quot; books that <br/>
seem to be around now.  Of course, I can&#39;t remember the name of the book, but I <br/>
would guess there must be others out there written probably by and for <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any picture books like this?  When I searched &quot;homeschool <br/>
books&quot; in the library and online, I only seem to get books about <br/>
homeschooling for adults like The Unschooling Handbook, etc.<br/>

When Holly has asked why books are so often about school, I tell her that <br/>
school&#39;s not so fun, so people go to great lengths to make it look fun so kids <br/>
won&#39;t be afraid, so they&#39;ll think things like &quot;Well, Grover went to school,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Franklin went to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Propaganda in a BIG way.<br/>
<br/>
What other kid-shows are pro-school?  We don&#39;t have cable, but I know Arthur <br/>
deals with school stuff (not always positively), and Dragontales seems <br/>
pro-formality, and Barney for certain.    <br/>

think about it, all I can think of is Dexter&#39;s Laboratory and then I <br/>
can&#39;t even remember if they ever talk about or show school.  I&#39;m <br/>
thinking maybe Little Bear isn&#39;t too heavy on school and if it is, <br/>
it&#39;s not memorable to me because we always talk about the fun <br/>
adventures from that show.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>All the Disney channel sitcoms like That&#39;s So Raven, Lizzie Maguire, Boy Meets World, <br/>
Sister, Sister, Even Stevens...<br/>
<br/>
One of the interesting comments my daughter made about school this year when she went <br/>
was that it was so different than she had imagined. She realized that her only ideas about <br/>
school were from TV sitcoms and school bore little resemblence. Here are some of her <br/>
comments:<br/>
<br/>
--She never sees the principal in the hallways. In fact, most kids didn&#39;t even know the <br/>
principal&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
--Kids don&#39;t laugh and do dramatic things in the hallways. They mostly walk and file <br/>
through without much else going on.<br/>
<br/>
--Teachers are real people. They&#39;re not totally inflexible or rigid, nor are the scatter-<br/>
brained or incompetent. TV protrays them in these ways mostly.<br/>
<br/>
--Most of school is uneventful, unlike every episode of the sitcom variety.<br/>
<br/>
--There aren&#39;t nearly the number of cool, team-oriented projects in school compared with <br/>
TV.<br/>
<br/>
She also observed that kids in school are generally more incosiderate and selfish than her <br/>
homeschooled friends. She had to stand up for a boy in her French class who was <br/>
constantly teased for his accent and stood by stunned as a girl walked into the bathroom, <br/>
saw a ring left on the counter and picked it up to keep for herself. This girl asked if it <br/>
belonged to my daughter. When she said no, the girl said, &quot;Cool. It&#39;s mine now&quot; and <br/>
walked out.<br/>
<br/>
She told me later that she knows that would never have happened in our homeschool co-<br/>
op.<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes a taste of school goes a long way in reinforcing why we chose to <br/>
homeschool to begin with.<br/>

&gt; Julie B<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that it&#39;s a leap from the preschool shows to this show, but <br/>
last night I watched &quot;My So Called Life&quot; with my preteen daughter.  <br/>
Anyone remember this one...it was on one of the major networks, like <br/>
a decade ago...stars Claire Danes and Jared Leto? It deals with a <br/>
sensitive introspective girl trying to deal with the day to day <br/>
emotional &quot;battlezone&quot; of school.  Last night when I watched it <br/>
(haven&#39;t in YEARS), it looked a lot different to me, a lot more <br/>
accurate than I used to think it was before unschooling.  The <br/>
classes looked dull, you really got the sense the kids were bored <br/>
and just counting down the time till the bell rang so they could get <br/>
home, in many cases to SANCTUARY.  I think that part really struck <br/>
me the most, how they couldn&#39;t physically get away from their <br/>
problems, couldn&#39;t get to a safe place on their own.  Forced to deal <br/>
with things, almost like prison.  It wasn&#39;t potrayed in a comical <br/>
way, either, like &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, etc., very realistic.  Also, <br/>
the problems the kids faced during the course of the day (sex, <br/>
violence, bullying) really were very well potrayed, not overly <br/>
dramatized at all like I once considered them to be.  And no happy <br/>
resolves in the end, situations don&#39;t necessarily &quot;get better&quot;, so <br/>
it wasn&#39;t like you were learning a lesson on how to &quot;cope&quot; like you <br/>
do with other schoolish programs.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I thought it was a good show, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d call it <br/>
an &quot;unschooling&quot; show if you have to label it, but I felt it made a <br/>
pretty good argument for unschooling!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434996763">Clifford is Stella&#39;s FAVORITE show.  She loves the dogs, and likes to<br/>
pretend to be them with her little sister and friends.  She draws Emily<br/>
Elizabeth and Clifford and the rest so often. She likes that the kids live<br/>
in a place where they can explore on their own and have alot of<br/>
independence.  I wish she could watch it still, but where we are living now<br/>
we don&#39;t have tv.  She really misses this show in particular.  It&#39;s true<br/>
that it doesn&#39;t really have much of a school theme.<br/>

though he&#39;s so far beyond anything that school could teach him. He should be<br/>
bored out of his gourd.<br/>

Generation.  I think both shows offer a glimpse into what school is <br/>
really like.  Though I wouldn&#39;t say they are unschooly at all.  A <br/>
good push to be unschoolers, though!<br/>
<br/>
I used to watch Degrassi when I was a teenager as well.  That and <br/>
Square Pegs (my favorite), which I think was another fairly <br/>
realistic glimpse into public school.<br/>
