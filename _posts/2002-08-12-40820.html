&gt;&gt; Recently I was asked by a friend to watch his two children. His daughter is<br/>
&gt;&gt; 16 months, doesn&#39;t walk, talk and is obviously still in diapers. (she is<br/>
&gt;&gt; slightly developmentally delayed) His son is 5 months. I have wavered back<br/>
&gt;&gt; and forth. (His wife met him at the door one day last week, handed the baby<br/>
&gt;&gt; to him, said &quot;I need a break,&quot; and he hasn&#39;t seen her since.) I used to watch<br/>
&gt;&gt; my bestfriend&#39;s two children, her daughter is just 3 months younger than Jack<br/>
&gt;&gt; and her little boy is 22 months younger than her daughter. At one time I had<br/>
&gt;&gt; my two nursing, her two drinking the warmed up breast milk she stored in my<br/>
&gt;&gt; freezer, three in diapers and one in the process of potty training. I never<br/>
&gt;&gt; thought twice about loading them all up, going to the store or the park, or<br/>
&gt;&gt; carting them all around the library. It never occurred to me that life could<br/>
&gt;&gt; be any different with two toddlers or four. Not taking a shower until lunch<br/>
&gt;&gt; was over and everyone was asleep was standard for me. Board books, water<br/>
&gt;&gt; mats, finger paints, play-dough in the carpet, upchuck in my hair, I was<br/>
&gt;&gt; queen of my domain! I still had time to make a hearty soup and fresh bread<br/>
&gt;&gt; for all of us to enjoy at the end of the day, and my toilets sparkled. Why<br/>
&gt;&gt; now does the prospect of two more babies scare me? Now I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
&gt;&gt; including two little ones in all the activities my two are involved in. My<br/>
&gt;&gt; bestfriends kids are my kids, mine are hers. And although she and I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt;&gt; eye to eye on the unschooling, we still support everything each other does. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; can&#39;t see myself taking my two and two babies to see her daughter dance, or<br/>
&gt;&gt; Moly act, or Jack to the skateboard park. Am I being selfish? I don&#39;t see<br/>
&gt;&gt; myself devoting large amounts of time to two new children and still giving<br/>
&gt;&gt; all the time I give now to my own kids. I feel like something would have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; give. How do those of you who still have babies at home find the time to *be*<br/>
&gt;&gt; and *do* with your older ones? I guess my problem is I&#39;m not quite the queen<br/>
&gt;&gt; of my domain that I used to be. My bread doesn&#39;t get baked as often as it<br/>
&gt;&gt; used too, I find that cleaning the bathroom once a week with a wipe down<br/>
&gt;&gt; sometime, gets it *almost* as good as cleaning it three times a week used to<br/>
&gt;&gt; get it. I so badly want to say, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll watch your kids, no problem!&quot; but,<br/>
&gt;&gt; my brain says NOOOOO!!!! What to do? And I feel bad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. The list is about unschooling which is about life. Sometimes that life<br/>
includes kids and babies! And cleaning toilets. And sleeping arrangements.<br/>
And Scholastic Warehouse sales. And Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And Christian<br/>
fundamentalists. And potty training. And what to do about disaproving<br/>
husbands. And ...<br/>

to join a list and then criticize it for being what works for the list<br/>
members?<br/>
