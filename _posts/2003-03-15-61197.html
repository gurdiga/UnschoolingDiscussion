&lt;&lt; You can send a copy to the state later if they say &quot;We don&#39;t have your <br/>
 registration.&quot;<br/>
 You say &quot;Oh.  Sorry.  Here&#39;s a copy.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and I panicked and actually sent the original, notorized form into the <br/>
umbrella school. I don&#39;t think they are the least bit interested in checking <br/>
up on me. He only asked me to fax a copy for our records so he wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
to bug me if a &quot;nosy neighbor&quot; called in again.<br/>
So he acted like it was more for us than for the school district, who knows.<br/>
I really  think just the notorized copy would satisfy, but now I&#39;m officially <br/>
registered.<br/>
Dang!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
