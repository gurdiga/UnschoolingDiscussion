<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834696767">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here, and I hope it&#39;s okay to just barge right in:)  I&#39;m in <br/>
sort of a hurry to find some ideas for co-operative, non competitive <br/>
type games for a small unschooling play group (2-4 children; ages <br/>
6,7, 9 and 10).<br/>
<br/>
The competition between the four (especially the younger ones) are <br/>
quite volatile, and I don&#39;t feel comfortable asking them to <br/>
play &#39;against&#39; each other in any way.<br/>
<br/>
It would be such a great help to me to find a few *new* (to them) <br/>
games/activities that would spark their interest and encourage them <br/>
to play &#39;together&#39; instead of &#39;against&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
This is somewhat of a new experience for all the children, two of <br/>
whom come from a public school background, and have a tendency toward <br/>
a &#39;bully&#39; mentality.  I&#39;d love to be able to introduce them to a new <br/>
way of learning and playing together, where people don&#39;t get hurt, or <br/>
feel they have to hurt someone else to &#39;win&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any suggestions at all!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking for, sit down or run around type <br/>
games.  If you have some space and want run around games, try blob <br/>
tag.  You set some boundaries (or the game will never end) and then one <br/>
person starts as It.  When they tag another person, that person becomes <br/>
part of the blob, and they hold hands while chasing the rest.  The game <br/>
ends when all are part of the blob.  If you want to play again, the last <br/>
person caught could start as It.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153359155">Follow the leader is usually pretty cool, and if there&#39;s a playground and <br/>
they&#39;re not leaving little kids in the dust, that can work.  A kitchen timer <br/>
set to 30 seconds or something could mark the point at which the leader goes <br/>
to the back but the line keeps moving.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too small a group for Red Lion or another of the similar tag games.  <br/>
Those are not totally cooperative, and there is a winner, but it&#39;s quick and <br/>
&quot;fair.&quot;  Here&#39;s how it works.  There is a base (den) and one &quot;it&quot; (lion).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another base, and everyone else comes to the edge of the den and <br/>
recites this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Red lion, red lion, come out of your den<br/>
Whoever you catch will be one of your men.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The lion is at the back of the den (out of reach by a step or two) and on the <br/>
word &quot;men,&quot; the runners run and the lion chases.  <br/>
<br/>
It *should* be catch instead of tag, and if your kids will tolerate that <br/>
politely that&#39;s a better way.  But if you play tag that&#39;s fine too.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever&#39;s tagged goes back with the lion, those left recite the starting <br/>
verse, and when only one is left, that child is the new lion and the game <br/>
continues without a pause.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good for getting kids tired, if you need to get them a little tired <br/>
before some more still activity.  And it&#39;s good for getting adrenaline out if <br/>
they&#39;ve been getting grouchy and someone has building up a charge which could <br/>
result in some physical expression you&#39;d all like to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
-------<br/>
Another &quot;lion&quot; game we&#39;ve used is much quieter.  We call it &quot;dead pirates&quot; <br/>
here, but the book we found it in called it &quot;dead lions&quot; I think.<br/>
<br/>
One person is it.  Find a shady place, or indoor on carpet place, and <br/>
everyone should lie down, not touching, and not so close that others can&#39;t <br/>
walk.<br/>
<br/>
They get still and quiet and pretend to be asleep.  The one who is it tries <br/>
to make them laugh, by saying things, making noises, telling jokes, just <br/>
anything, while walking around them.  When one smiles or laughs or looks, <br/>
he&#39;s one of the speakers too, and the last one still and quiet is the first <br/>
one it for the next round.<br/>
<br/>
Moms can play that too, and Red Lion, too (if they&#39;re energetic moms).  <br/>
Follow the leader doesn&#39;t work as well with moms if you&#39;re using a playground <br/>
(unless you have a young, small mom who can get through kid-sized spaces).<br/>

imaginative cooperative games that work well for all ages. If you look on the <br/>
internet for improvisational theater, you&#39;ll find a lot. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-817413473">Hi Molly and Welcome,<br/>
<br/>
Have you heard of The Ungame?  Questions can be read for non-readers.  It<br/>
just poses some questions to answer no right or wrong answers - just what<br/>
that person thinks.  My 11 yo , 5 yo and myself played it for the first time<br/>
the other day.  Everyone has to promise not to say anything when it is some<br/>
one else&#39;s turn, but after the game is over anyone can comment or disscus<br/>
openly.  The game can be as long or as short as any one wants.  It has 2<br/>
decks - the 1st one is good for starters and younger players.<br/>
<br/>
Just one suggestion.  Have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Joan<br/>
