even might get an A or B in an algebra class and haven&#39;t learned algebra.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest never went to school, never had math lessons, and is getting a B in <br/>
math 99 a remedial college level math class, not for college credit, but if <br/>
he completes it I think he can go to math 120 next, or whatever the first <br/>
for-credit class is there.   This still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s definitely learning <br/>
algebra, but he&#39;s doing better in that class than some others who went to school <br/>
for 12 or 13 years or more.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I think helped him:   games, singing number songs, playing with <br/>
numbers, building things, messing with patterns, working in a store, having a <br/>
dad who&#39;s very math-minded (genetics).  And the biggest help:  He&#39;s not afraid <br/>
of it.  He didn&#39;t go to school as a little kid and learn it was hard or yucky <br/>
or boring.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think maybe the fear isn&#39;t because people think their kids are not <br/>
&quot;learning&quot; all this - but they&#39;re not being rubber-stamped through the <br/>
system - they&#39;re not getting filtered through all the right channels. <br/>
Everybody knows - EVERYBODY knows - that most of what is taught to kids <br/>
in school just goes in one ear and right out the other. Everybody knows <br/>
there is little retention of material after a test. Teachers know, <br/>
parents know, kids know. It is interesting that researchers don&#39;t study <br/>
this more often - but &quot;learning&quot; is not really what most education <br/>
research is all about.<br/>
<br/>
Ask any teacher to give a quiz on Friday and then go back in on Monday <br/>
and say, &quot;Sorry - I lost the quizzes, you&#39;ll have to take it again.&quot; <br/>
The average score will drop dramatically - like the kids&#39; brains were <br/>
drained over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
This is not news to anybody - including those who teach and continue to <br/>
GIVE the quizzes and tests.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is not having the outside validation - the report cards, the <br/>
homework, the quizzes, the term papers, the tests, and the <br/>
parent-teacher conferences - all those things that parents use to <br/>
convince themselves that there just MUST be learning going on. Even <br/>
though we all know, at some level, that it is nearly all pretense it is <br/>
scary not to have all those external sources of validation. I think <br/>
parents have to be a lot more honest with themselves about what THEY <br/>
learned, what their own schooling taught them, how much do they honesty <br/>
recall from their own schooling - versus how much have they learned <br/>
outside of school. And - they need to realize that they&#39;re not the <br/>
exception - schooling is not conducive to learning - it isn&#39;t ideal, it <br/>
is simply convenient.  I can&#39;t have a serious conversation about what <br/>
kids learn in school. I can&#39;t pretend with the other soccer moms that I <br/>
think their kids are being educated there. I can&#39;t talk about whether <br/>
they should teach algebra in 7th or 8th grades. I can&#39;t discuss the <br/>
merits of AP classes. I can&#39;t get all heated up over the kinds of <br/>
homework assignments they&#39;re getting.<br/>
<br/>
Once you see clearly that emperor has no clothes, it is really hard to <br/>
seriously discuss his fashion sense &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How true.  I had a professor in college that had a saying.  He would tell us <br/>
that he knew we would take this course and that we&#39;d all do our parts to make <br/>
the grade and that at the end of it all we would &quot;dump the disk&quot;.  Basically, <br/>
&quot;retained long enough to make a passing or better grade and then pretty much <br/>
forgotten&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Funny how he knew it and we knew it.  He would then go on to tell us that he <br/>
didn&#39;t want that and that he&#39;d do his best to make the class more interesting <br/>
so we&#39;d WANT to retain it.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, people can know it (sometimes), but the brainwashing is really strong.  I think this is the idea that I stumble over the most when I worry about whether my kid can and will learn enough *math* to get a job where he can pay his bills.  Like many would-be unschoolers, I sometimes worry specifically about my kid learning math.  And it&#39;s hard to stop worrying about how math will be learned, because I believe I learned a lot of math in school.  (I forgot some of it, but not all of it.)<br/>
<br/>
I have math-enthusiast genes from my dad.  I did math workbooks outside of school, when I was 5 or 6.  This was my parents idea, but I think I did it voluntarily.  I excelled in Math classes, but unlike Reading, I don&#39;t think I knew it all before arriving at school.  In Jr. High and High School, I did math homework nearly every school night. (OK, I think I understood it, *because* of my math aptitude.  Other students trying to do homework *without* understanding it certainly didn&#39;t learn from the homework.) In college I took more math classes for the first two years and then my upper division and graduate classes used that math.  If my son is only spending 1/20th the amount of time on math that I did, will he eventually learn &quot;enough&quot; math?  (I made lots more money in my twenties than most of my math-phobic friends, because I worked as an engineer.)<br/>
<br/>
**I think parents have to be a lot more honest with themselves about what THEY <br/>
learned, what their own schooling taught them, how much do they honesty <br/>
recall from their own schooling - versus how much have they learned **<br/>
<br/>
Right, I had the mini-epiphany recently that even though I know we studied South America for a long time in Sixth Grade, I can only correctly identify the countries in S. A. that are shown on the RISK board.  And I learned to read before starting school, so I knew that all those reading lessons did nothing for me.  I learned a lot about history because I read a lot outside of school and had enough mental &quot;hooks&quot; that history lectures were sometimes meaningful to me, even though they were just tiresome &quot;blah blah blah&quot; to the other students.  And I know that I only retained foreign language reading fluency to the extent that I chose to continue using the language outside of school.  I know a big percentage of people forgot how to say anything but &quot;Bonjour&quot; or &quot;Hola&quot;.  I think I realize that I didn&#39;t learn much from most of my school classes, unless I learned outside of school, but I&#39;ve been thinking that Math was an exception.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504970345">Thats a good point, in school I could barely stand to hear one more<br/>
history lesson! I absolutely loathed it. I think I learned next to<br/>
nothing and could only recite to you the year Colombus supposedly<br/>
discovered America. It was later on after school on my own that I<br/>
discovered how interesting it was. I was so shocked how many years I<br/>
refused to hear any of it, and found interest in none of it.<br/>

in the future any unschooler misses out on learning algebra, it won&#39;t be too <br/>

 themselves, but like every mother, I want all my childrens potential<br/>
 included in with what makes them happy and I dont think anyone<br/>
 pictures this as their son working at a gas station. Even if this the<br/>
 eventual reality.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t at all offended. I knew my dad. &lt;BG&gt; He was a famous man in town.<br/>
Well loved and happy until the day he died. I was just trying to show that<br/>
even though the kids may not head in the direction that the parents feel is<br/>
up to their potential, it&#39;s what they want and are happy with that matters<br/>
most. My  Dad did what made him happy and because of that, the happy life<br/>
came with it.<br/>

clearer. Thinking you don&#39;t want your kids stuck as gas station attendants<br/>
won&#39;t help you clearly identify your fears.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could clarify your fear as &quot;Not being able to do what they<br/>
love&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, what do they need to do what they love?<br/>
<br/>
For starters, *doing* what they love :-) Doing what they love is training<br/>
for doing more of what they love.<br/>
<br/>
And what else they need is confidence that they can learn whatever they need<br/>
to learn when they need to learn it.<br/>

  &gt; &lt;&lt; **In the back of mind though, I just keep hoping Im not setting them up<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; to be gas station attendants. I dont seem to &quot;get&quot; how these kids are<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; going to be ok if they never learn algebra or if they never WANT to<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; learn algebra.<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Knowing algebra, trig or any other thing in life is no guarantee that a person won&#39;t be gas station attendant.  My husband who has a dual masters degree in business adminstration and computer science *had* to work in a gas station for three months because he couldn&#39;t get a job anywhere else at the time.  He was underpaid, even for manual labor standards, and worked 12 hour days, with only one day off per week.  He said he was glad for the experience and that one should never think a job is below oneself.  The world may not always be as it is today.  My daughter often says she wants to be a cashier or a yogurt stocker in the grocery store, or a greeter at Wal-Mart, in addition to her desire to be a singer and a spy.  When she sees happy people doing their jobs, she thinks she&#39;d like the job.  She&#39;s just 7, but I think it&#39;s great that she can see herself doing all kinds of things.  Sometimes she talks about creating a job because she sees work that needs to be done while we&#39;re out.  If she could get a job tomorrow, I think she would.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway... if children are used to learning as something that enables them to do things they want to do, of their own accord, if a child *needs* a certain subject to do a certain thing, she will learn it, which is so very different from kids who are forced to learn things all their lives for the sake of a grade.  I know quite a few people who changed their majors in college because the major of their desire required specific math that they were too fearful to take.  Where did that fear come from?  From being forced to do it earlier in life, perhaps before they could grasp the concepts and then made to feel inferior for not getting it.  <br/>
<br/>
  Pardon if I&#39;ve rambled too much... bad head and chest cold, can&#39;t sleep much for coughing.<br/>

&lt;&lt;So, what do they need to do what they love?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For starters, *doing* what they love :-) Doing what they love is training<br/>
for doing more of what they love. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes, adults do what they love as an income-producing career, or at <br/>
least a side job.   But often, adults take a job they can stand so that they <br/>
can afford what they need to have to do what they love.   Some loves don&#39;t pay. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;   Staying home with one&#39;s children is one of them, for instance.  Making <br/>
quilts.  Restoring cars and then driving them rather than selling them (and <br/>
even selling them is iffy on the profit end).  Collecting dolls or egg beaters <br/>
or...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771760677">My 21yo worked for a while as a gas station attendant. Now he works as a <br/>
sales man in a timber yard.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just what he does for money.<br/>
<br/>
What he IS is a musician, a saxophonist. What he DOES is play jazz sax. <br/>
He can&#39;t make a living from his music yet - probably never will until he <br/>
leaves New Zealand (which will be heart wrenching for me).<br/>
<br/>
What you do to earn money is not necessarily what makes you happy, <br/>
directly. I think it is a real and very big mistake to identify people&#39;s <br/>
Selves with how they earn money. That is why so many people give up <br/>
their music, art, acting, surfing, sport, - their passions - and end up <br/>
bitter in later years.<br/>
<br/>
I tell my son, always remember that you are a musician, no matter what <br/>
you are doing to earn your money.<br/>
I tell the same to my artist son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687264809">I&#39;ve become self-correcting! Reading in this thread, I thought of the <br/>
theory out there, that it&#39;s so much more difficult to learn new <br/>
things when myelin sort of solidifies the neuropaths in your brain, <br/>
and that&#39;s why boys grasp math more readily than girls,(this is the <br/>
theory I&#39;m talking about, mind you) because boys&#39; brains mature <br/>
later, AFTER algebra is being taught in school. I was going to ask <br/>
about this, but then something occured to me.<br/>
<br/>
My brother, a boy, got straight C&#39;s through school, and passed his <br/>
basic algebra classes okay. Then graduated high school, got a job, <br/>
got married, had a kid...and decided to try some college. As an <br/>
adult. With myelin sheaths on all his little neurons. Right? He <br/>
enrolled in pre-alg. and zoomed through it. Same with the algebra, <br/>
calculus, trigonometry, and engineering math that he took. He had <br/>
never shown any math genius in school, but in his mid 20&#39;s, when he <br/>
took REALLY high math, he zipped through like a hot knife through <br/>
butter. Total comprehension. Total enjoyment. Straight A&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
And he ran out of money, and now works at Home Depot, and it&#39;s his <br/>
excellent work ethic that has moved him upwards in that corporation, <br/>
so he now is manager of a floor. <br/>
<br/>
If his brain myelinated, it sure was able to break free of those <br/>
hampering sheaths, when he found something new to learn, that was <br/>
enjoyable to him.<br/>
