<div id="ygrps-yiv-40387684">I&#39;ll tell him what he said.  Dh has rebuilt plenty of transmissions on his<br/>
vehicles so he can do that.  He was hoping to get someone to give him<br/>
something a bit more specific.  So, he may possibley be rebuilding the<br/>
transmission when we get back from The Falcon Ridge Folk Festival in<br/>
Hillsdale, NY this coming week.  Thanks very much for asking him!<br/>

&gt; I just asked my DH who drives a 86 F-150 (which is a rattletrap by<br/>
&gt; the way) and he said it sounds like the synchronizers. I asked what<br/>
&gt; your husband should do, and his wise answer was to get the<br/>
&gt; transmission rebuilt. Not much help, sorry!<br/>

know where you live but here in Texas you can get it<br/>
done for $100-200. Sounds like a lot but we just got a<br/>
motor rebuilt for $1700 and that was with DH doing<br/>
part of the work himself i.e. taking the motor apart,<br/>
removing the motor and reinstalling the motor. My mom<br/>
has to have her motor rebuilt and it is going to cost<br/>
her $2500. Anyway, hope this is helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646759325">Thanks Corallyn,<br/>
We live in CT and I think the cost would be way higher.  Thanks for asking<br/>
dh about all this.  We&#39;ve put working on the truck aside for the moment and<br/>
I am now carless for a few days until we go to NY&#39;s Falcon Ridge Folk<br/>
Festival this week.  We have too much to do.<br/>
