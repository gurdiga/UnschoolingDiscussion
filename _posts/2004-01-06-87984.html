<div id="ygrps-yiv-515349136">My son loves to cut those magazines up to glue in his &quot;books&quot; he makes for us <br/>
and his baby sister.  There are so many photos of babies, parents, toys, <br/>
strollers, etc.  When I taught preschool, my kids loved them there as well.  But <br/>
the ARTICLES in the big commercial ones are pretty much the same things every <br/>
month.  I like my Welcome Home publication much better.<br/>
As for books by the &quot;experts&quot;, some parts of some books I&#39;ve found <br/>
helpful...that&#39;s why of course we love the library!   And I have been reading every <br/>
hs/unschooling book I can get my hands on lately.  Our library just got a Home Ed <br/>
Mag subscription, yippie!  This is one I might have to get myself.<br/>
