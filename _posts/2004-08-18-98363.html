You can rent games.  Its just like netflix.  You get 2 at a time, no late fees etc etc.  Its about $22/month I think.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to try it.<br/>

  &gt; I suggested selling some, a while ago, so that he<br/>
  &gt; could get new games, but you get so little money for<br/>
  &gt; them, compared to what you paid for them, that it<br/>
  &gt; doesn&#39;t make much sense to him to get rid of them.<br/>
<br/>
  Depends on the game! Some of them hold their value very well. There are some<br/>
  games for the SNES (which came out, maybe, 10 years ago?) that go for $30 or<br/>
  more. Of course lots are only sold for a $1 or $2.<br/>
<br/>
  It all depends.<br/>
