&lt;&lt; That&#39;s all I meant. The other thing that occurs to me to clarify is that I<br/>
 think it isn&#39;t only our own childhood experiences that affect us, but our<br/>
 current situation. I am with our two-and-a-half-year-old son all day and<br/>
 night, living in the suburbs, with a husband who works very long hours. I&#39;m<br/>
 practicing attachment parenting, which I think has helped me immensely in<br/>
 avoiding a repeat in the cycle of violence. But I don&#39;t have a real &quot;tribe&quot;<br/>
 (see Jean Liedloff&#39;s Continuum Concept). I think people often underestimate<br/>
 the degree to which our problems with our kids are related to being in a<br/>
 very unnatural situation (being a sole adult alone with a small child much<br/>
 of the day, having to call friends on the phone to arrange social<br/>
 interaction in advance, not finding a lot of places where we can do adult<br/>
 things and just have the kids tag along, etc.). &gt;&gt;<br/>

Wow, are we living similar lives with the exception I have two children!?  It <br/>
is a struggle to avoid that hitting (spanking is just a nicer word) when that <br/>
is what you were raised with and have no other tools in our parenting bags to <br/>
pull out when a child is having an off day for whatever reason.  However, I <br/>
am happy to say we  have overcoming these issues...but still a struggle <br/>
looking for other tools.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Bryant case&gt;Boy, this is scary!!!!  It scares the wits out of me... makes me <br/>
want to run for the hills and hide.<br/>

happen in our world!</div>

 . . . and all you others with little children out there.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to warn you about what happens when you practice <br/>
attachment parenting and treat your children like human beings from <br/>
the begining . . . I know this from experience . . . <br/>
You end up in a few years with best friends!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
My girls are 16 and 14.  I suddenly feel like I live in a commune <br/>
with four other adults . . . my girls, my dh and our 18 yo exhange <br/>
student.  It&#39;s truly amazing!<br/>
<br/>
However, I do remember those days when it felt like it was me and a <br/>
toddler, me and the kidlets, me and the house but NEVER me and other <br/>
adults.  So hang in there.<br/>
