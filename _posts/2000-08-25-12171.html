<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920195430">Bonnie -- our dd&#39;s sound like the same child.  Thanks for the advice -- I&#39;m <br/>
going to put the crayola notepad on her B-day wish list.<br/>
<br/>
Carron -- I have read the book you are referring to and I am currently <br/>
waiting for my library to get me 2 other works by those authors -- that type <br/>
of discipline totally makes sense to me but the book I read seems to NOT <br/>
cover the type of situations I am having with my 3 year old and she will <br/>
always yell back at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to make a choice!&quot;.  Anyway, I will try <br/>
to e-mail you privately -- thanks for the offer and advice!.<br/>
<br/>
Julie -- thanks for the book suggestions regarding 3yo dd -- I find reading <br/>
has helped me better understand that, well, she is 3 and that is what 3 year <br/>
olds do!  Reading always seems to keep my attitude in check so I will &quot;check&quot; <br/>
out your suggestions!  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to anyone I may have forgotten!!</div>
