<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096732201"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m actually shocked and appalled that anyone would even think of giving<br/>
&gt; high school SAT&#39;s to grade schoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I, too, took the SATs as a &quot;privilege&quot; when I was about to enter 7th<br/>
grade.  I can&#39;t at all remember what the numbers were, but they were<br/>
higher than most people entering college.  I was congratulated, etc.,<br/>
but my question was &quot;Why did I have to go to junior high and high school<br/>
then?&quot;  I never got that answered, but I was &quot;allowed&quot; to graduate<br/>
fairly young.<br/>
