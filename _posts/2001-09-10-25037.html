<div id="ygrps-yiv-941388579">&lt;&lt;Sometimes its just a trip to the bank or the store.  Not every outing is<br/>
entertaining&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly where I was last year.  I used to argue about &quot;OK maybe you<br/>
can coddle an only child, but I have 5.  No way to please them all so I will<br/>
just do it my way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, then I continued hanging around this list  :)<br/>
<br/>
Think Mary Poppins...A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down.  2<br/>
examples from today:  Had to take Adriane&#39;s goat to the vet.  Zach (8)<br/>
didn&#39;t want to stop working on the &quot;scope&quot; he is making for his BB gun so he<br/>
stayed home.  The little guys (4, 2, 2) had no option but to go.  Nobody<br/>
complained, everybody pitched in but on the way home Marsie asked to go down<br/>
a certain hilly, curvy road.  I actually just wanted to go home and this<br/>
road takes us a little out of our way......but the little kids loved it and<br/>
they had really been part of the Stauffer team this am....so down the hills<br/>
we went, complete with hands in air and squealing.<br/>
<br/>
Hadn&#39;t been home half an hour and I realized I was out of detergent.  It was<br/>
my fault (just went to the store a couple of days ago and didn&#39;t get any)<br/>
and the inconvenience was to me (laundry would be delayed).  I talked to the<br/>
kids about going to the store and Adriane (10) said she wanted to stay home.<br/>
I said I had hoped to just send her in to the store so I didn&#39;t have to load<br/>
and unload all the little guys.  She wrinkled her nose.  Well, I thought we<br/>
were going to the store and the kids had to have lunch anyway.  I suggested<br/>
that she might like to pick out something for lunch (like pizza).  Suddenly<br/>
she was all game, in fact everybody did the pizza dance out to the car.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these examples really interfered with my day at all.  Working as<br/>
a team really helped me out and nobody had a fit....win-win.<br/>
<br/>
But you are correct, occassionally we all have to do stuff that sucks,<br/>
nothing is going to make it more palatable.  But...I truly believe that a<br/>
little creativity and thoughtfulness cuts down drastically on the number of<br/>
those occassions.<br/>
<br/>
What if you really did need your dh to go somewhere with you and what if he<br/>
really didn&#39;t want to go?  Maybe it is a dinner with your boss.  You really<br/>
need to be there and it would be so much nicer if hubby was along....and he<br/>
hates your boss.  Finds him boring.  You might be willing to do something<br/>
for dh to make it worth his while to help you out.  (OK, what you would do<br/>
for dh is probably not what you would do for the kids LOL, but you get my<br/>
drift).<br/>
<br/>
Why would we be nicer to dh than to the kids?<br/>
