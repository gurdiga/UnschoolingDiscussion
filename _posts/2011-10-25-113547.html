<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012784829">Ok, so since we&#39;ve been moving into unschooling I&#39;ve tried hard to stop being such a ninny about cleaning up and picking up and such.  It goes against every fiber of my being (bc of how I was raised) but I&#39;m trying very, very hard and I&#39;ve noticed the kids spend more time playing with their toys that are strewed about!  Yay! I&#39;m so happy, it seems small but it&#39;s momentous for us, for me!!</div>

That&#39;s not this strewing thing. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Literally, in the dictionary, if kids scatter toys, those toys are strewn.<br/>
<br/>
Figuratively, in the advice about how to plant an interesting thing or two occasionally, it&#39;s not random flinging.<br/>
