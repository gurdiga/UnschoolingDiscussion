<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487925914">I can see my grandma rolling in her grave at the thought of mentioning<br/>
gifts, or what kind of gifts or wish lists or anything of the sort in an<br/>
invitation.  It&#39;s kind of an ingrained response for me to react that way as<br/>
well - to *not* tell someone what to get me.  What if they already had<br/>
something special in mind?  By the same token, it seems so logical to let<br/>
people know what the kids are interested in and what they would appreciate.<br/>
It&#39;s hard to decide.  What I have done in recent past is call my MIL and let<br/>
her know what everyone needs and wants hypothetically for Great Grandma and<br/>
Aunt Bonnie if they ask, but then she also hears it and hopefully takes it<br/>
into account.  Didn&#39;t really work so far...  Last time, The stuff that made<br/>
it upstairs after the party within a month is what stuck.  The rest of it I<br/>
asked Harriet if we could give it to some kids that needed toys and she said<br/>
that was fine.  Voila!  People also seem to bring gifts even when you tell<br/>
them it isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>

&gt;&gt; If you send out invitations you might make a note that asks them to<br/>
&gt;&gt; pick  out<br/>
&gt;&gt; one special gift carefully and if they would like, you are also asking<br/>
&gt;&gt;  that<br/>
&gt;&gt; anything over one gift be brought so your child can take and donate it<br/>
&gt;&gt; to a<br/>
&gt;&gt; homeless or battered women&#39;s shelter or a child in a group home or<br/>
&gt;&gt; something of<br/>
&gt;&gt;  the sort.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tying this into the post I sent about being resistant to feeling<br/>
&gt; ordered around - we&#39;d not be going to a party if I got an invitation<br/>
&gt; like that in the mail - telling me to &quot;pick out one special gift<br/>
&gt; carefully.&quot; That gave me the exact feeling I was talking about in the<br/>
&gt; other post - of being told to do something I&#39;m already doing or<br/>
&gt; planning to do or know I should do. Instead of giving a gift being<br/>
&gt; something I do, my own way, because I choose to do it - suddenly it<br/>
&gt; sounds like a duty and obligation and assignment and that I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; be evaluated on how good a job I do.<br/>

presence of the person who gave it to her. After that, she felt free to <br/>
do whatever she wanted with it - including give it away.<br/>
<br/>
My other sister gave me a big ceramic plate with a dip dish in the <br/>
middle. Okay - my daughter is the ceramics QUEEN - she makes hundreds <br/>
of cups and plates and bowls every month or so. And I make them too. We <br/>
are overrun with ceramics - we give them away all the time. So what was <br/>
she thinking? Maybe that we really like ceramics? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So - I used it once when she was at my house - put it out on the patio <br/>
table with veggies and dip. Planned to give it away the next day, per <br/>
my other sister&#39;s rule. But as the giver sister helped me clean up, I <br/>
accidentally dropped it on the cement patio. Oh dear.<br/>
<br/>
Really. It WAS an accident. REALLY!!!!!!<br/>
