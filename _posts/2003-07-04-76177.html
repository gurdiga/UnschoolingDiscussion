<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you look here and see anything you&#39;d like to use, I could ask my friend<br/>
&gt; Wolfgang Marquardt to translate it for you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to reply to this, because I know Steffi and know that she has no<br/>
email access at home, so she won&#39;t get any of this until Monday a.m. at the<br/>
earliest, depending on how life looks at work for her.  She also doesn&#39;t<br/>
brag about herself very well.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hard as it is to believe from her writing (and her speech), Steffi is German<br/>
and although she&#39;s travelled some, she has never lived in an English<br/>
speaking country.  All the things at her website she has translated herself;<br/>
all she needs is permission from the author to do so.<br/>
<br/>
She has a son too young for the mandatory school age here, and is working to<br/>
see that he never has to go to school.  Her husband is home with Julian<br/>
during the day.  They&#39;re a terrific family who have been a wonderful part of<br/>
our lives here in Germany.<br/>

I don&#39;t mind her translating it, but I&#39;d hate to say &quot;you can use my stuff <br/>
but you have to translate it.&quot; I&#39;d be willing to offer her an already translated <br/>
thing if she wanted.   And I&#39;d rather be translated by someone who knows me <br/>
than someone who doesn&#39;t because of that personal-voice thing.<br/>
<br/>
When Linda Dobson&#39;s Homeschool Book of Answers was translated into Japanese, <br/>
the translator wrote to me several times trying to understand what slant I <br/>
wanted on a phrase.  It was really cool, and I appreciated it.<br/>
