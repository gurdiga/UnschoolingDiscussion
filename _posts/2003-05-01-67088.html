No.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t understand that.<br/>
(After reading the rest of your post I began to understand it.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you knew your 7/8 year old would  probably not be with you in  3 or 4 <br/>
years would you still unschool? (knowing they would be def. going back to <br/>
public school then)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends why he would definitely be going back.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you knew your 7/8 year old  was  a slow learner and  would probably not <br/>
be at grade level  for public school in 3 or 4 years  would you still <br/>
homeschool?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
School chews up and spits out kids who are slow learners.  They destroy their <br/>
desire to learn and their self image.   <br/>
<br/>
Being at grade level in public school isn&#39;t among my top 300 or so hopes for <br/>
my children.  Schools themselves can&#39;t get kids to grade level.  But they <br/>
sure do some phenomenal damage to the many who fail to make &quot;grade level.&quot;<br/>

Our grandchildren are almost 8. We took them out of public school  half way thru kindergarten. Mostly we did relaxed homeschooling  Sometimes it sure wasnt very &quot;relaxed&quot;  when I would have sessions of &quot;school at home&quot;. and then lose my cool when they balked.<br/>
One of the girls is a very &quot;spirited&quot; child- after losing my temper  very badly with her during one of her   more flaming tantrums I said in remorse that if she wished she  could  try public school again and she jumped at it.  This was this past October. She has a  great teacher-and enjoys school usually. If she wants she can stay home anytime and  if home looks more interesting  she occasionally does.<br/>
Her sister  decided she wanted to try public school  in February. She did not get  a  teacher who took time  with her and she found herself  confused and left aside. She was  not where the rest of her class were  and was hurt  badly  by being made aware of that.<br/>
She decided she had had enough after ten days and  decided to go back to homeschooling-which actually is pretty relaxed. She actually feels worse now  as she really would have liked to play with all the kids her twin sister does. There is only one Elementary school in the town. We live   out of town.  There are only a few kids homeschooling in the district and none anywhere near her age.<br/>
We really feel we should unschool-we are going to  a Homeschooling Conference in a couple of weeks in Creston,BC and are looking forwards to hearing the two Unschooling  speakers. <br/>
Of course I know it is strictly our call but after going up and down and around   I am curious enough to see if any of you have  been in similar circumstances and what your take is on it.  <br/>
I havnt given much background-I tend to go on and on anyway.<br/>

We are in our mid sixties. The girls will go to their biological mother when we cannot look after them. What she will do with them is anyones guess. We hope she will ditch the alcoholic boyfriend  and make a life for the girls. We hope we can look after them for many years.<br/>
Having one girl at school and one at home is really making my life miserable although my husband doesnt have the problems with it that I have.<br/>
No, having  Kara  at  &quot;grade level&quot; is not  a big deal for us. One of the reasons that we homeschool  is to keep them  and especially Kara  from being  forced to walk their walk. <br/>
It was very painful to see what happened in the ten days she did go back-and very  painful and confusing for her.<br/>
Homeschooling is  not looked on favourably by a lot of the teachers here. Some of what went down  was actually about  me- I have lived  near this small town  for 37 yearsOur five children and adopted grandaughter all went through the school system here. The -Only-remark her teacher made to me when I picked up her things was &quot;-well I guess Kara probably found it very confusing-next time you might consider putting her in at the beginning of the year. &quot;My&quot; children are very advanced&quot;....obviously  Kara was not one of &quot;her&quot; children  and I  wasn&#39;t to  think she had the time or interest  for a homeschooled child who just came in after the middle  of the year just  because she wanted to try it.<br/>
Anyway.....<br/>
yes the schools certainly do chew up the children who  prefer to learn differently. Sadly one of the coping mechanisms  is to develop a hard veneer  to protect themselves which is what Stephie does sometimes  -and it takes most  all of a weekend to get our  real little girl back.<br/>
Mainly I am curious to hear if anyone has taken young children out, or back out, to  unschool and also what other  parents have seen when young  unschooled children go back to school.<br/>
So , how can a family  really unschool when they are tied to one young  childs school schedule. ( well actually I know how to do it-we are...)<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; So , how can a family  really unschool when they are tied to one young  <br/>
childs school schedule. ( well actually I know how to do it-we are...) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I made a comment about this one time and got jumped HARD (behind my back, in <br/>
print, by an Alaskan homeschooling newsletter).    Here&#39;s my bit (from an <br/>
interview):<br/>
<br/>
You believe that unschooling cannot be a part-time affair. Given that, is it <br/>
possible to unschool one child while another is using a structured <br/>
curriculum? What if one child wants to go to school?  <br/>
<br/>
 I think that spoils the integrity of the set-of-everything, to say, &quot;Math we <br/>
won&#39;t risk, but the rest of that you can learn on your own, or not.&quot; It <br/>
creates an object and a field. Math is a Must-Know, and the rest is less <br/>
valuable. <br/>
<br/>
 I think setting &quot;academics&quot; apart from the rest of cool stuff to know is <br/>
just as bad. Is science more important than auto-mechanics? Hey, it is <br/>
auto-mechanics, everywhere but at school, where auto-mechanics is in one <br/>
building, and science is in another building, different teacher, different <br/>
book, different line on the report card. In real life there are thousands of <br/>
buildings, and teachers, and books. <br/>
<br/>
 If one child in a family is using a curriculum because he or she wants to, <br/>
and the work is done her own way, that&#39;s not as disruptive as I think it <br/>
would be if the parent were inflicting a curriculum on one child while <br/>
claiming or attempting to leave another child free to learn naturally. How <br/>
could one prevent comparing? <br/>
<br/>
 What I have recommended and can&#39;t get out of is that if one of my children <br/>
wanted to go to school, I would go along with it. I think the worst thing <br/>
about school is the powerlessness of the students. They have to be there <br/>
whether they want to or not. There&#39;s no virtue in those who want to be there, <br/>
and no joy in those who do not want to be. When families force their children <br/>
home when the children would rather have stayed in school, the same <br/>
powerlessness exists. Part of the reason I would go with it is that I would <br/>
not expect it to last. I&#39;ve made their home-life fun. School would have to be <br/>
fantasyland to compete with what they have at home. <br/>
<br/>
 If the parent has separated learning from school in his or her mind, the <br/>
pressure on a school-kid will be much lower than if the parent really <br/>
believes school is the source of knowledge and success. <br/>
<br/>
 While it&#39;s luxuriously easy if everyone in a family is committed to <br/>
unschooling, I don&#39;t think life will be over for them if some of them are <br/>
involved in formal learning. I think where unschooling and formality are side <br/>
by side, unschooling will win out every time, because it&#39;s joyous and <br/>
friendly. <br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The harsh criticism was over my use of &quot;inflicted.&quot;  They would&#39;ve burned me <br/>
at the stake had I been a local, I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369696606">Hey Grace...<br/>
<br/>
Kudos for your daily efforts...just keep slugging away..<br/>
<br/>
My only contribution would be to focus on those elements that your great <br/>
grand daughter liked about school.  Probably the social...&quot;playing with <br/>
friends.&quot;  My 10 1/2 dd was taken out of public at the end of second grade <br/>
(7 1/2).  Over the last 3 years she has had a number of complaints about <br/>
being at home.  Its usually about not having any friends to play with or <br/>
not being with her friends.  (They are either at school or doing homework!) <br/>
Translate that to mean, &quot;being in the presence of kids or girls at least 7 <br/>
hours a day.&quot;  When I ask her about the specifics of those hours and what <br/>
would she be doing if she were in school and explain what the consequences <br/>
would be (homework, spelling tests, etc), she immediately states that she <br/>
wants nothing to do with that!  She just wants the company!    She would <br/>
prefer to have someone to play with 24 hours a day and this change has been <br/>
very hard for her.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike her brother who has &quot;buds&quot; that have remained the same since he met <br/>
them, my daughter (girls?) doesn&#39;t seem to have that one or two loyal, <br/>
reliable friend(s) that she can always call upon in a time of need.  She <br/>
feels insecure, shy and yet at the same time demanding of her <br/>
friends.  Still very wet behind the ears in social skills, and feeling <br/>
still &quot;odd-girl-out&quot; being homeschooled, she feels at a disadvantage among <br/>
the neighborhood and her school friends .  So they change every day and I <br/>
can see where that would be a relatively insecure social arena, unlike the <br/>
structure of public school (good or bad).  So we discuss how we can make <br/>
that up in other ways, work around the school schedule with her school <br/>
friends, and try to meet other homeschool friends.  But in the end I figure <br/>
there is only so much that can be done, and she will have to learn to be a <br/>
little more by herself and develop her own interests during those times <br/>
when other friends are not available.<br/>
