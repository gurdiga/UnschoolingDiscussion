 </span></blockquote>I was going through the ear piercing discussion with 5dd just a couple of<br/>
weeks ago. She has been asking me to let her get her ears pierced, and I<br/>
told her that dh and I would talk about it. What made me hesitate at all<br/>
is that she told me that the reason she wants them is to look beautiful.<br/>
I told her that she was beautiful without them, but she argued that fact.<br/>
DH said &quot;but look at Mommy, she is beautiful without earrings&quot;. DD&#39;s<br/>
diplomatic reply was that I looked *more* beautiful with earrings. I just<br/>
don&#39;t want her to grow up thinking that she can&#39;t be beautiful without<br/>
added accessories. I did go and borrow one of those piercing guns from a<br/>
jeweler friend, but dd took one look at it and decided to wait. I&#39;m not<br/>
sure that it would have been the best thing anyway, considering her<br/>
reason for wanting them. What would make a 5yo child think she couldn&#39;t<br/>
be beautiful without earrings? She is a very pretty girl and has never<br/>
been told otherwise.<br/>

way we live is to emphasize on the natural beauty in things, not the<br/>
artificially created/culturally suggested way. So I asked dd what would<br/>
make her feel that way. Apparently the discussion on her not being<br/>
beautiful without earrings had more of an impact on me than her, because<br/>
she didn&#39;t even remember the conversation. She did however remember her<br/>
5yo cousin (who had her ears pierced at 2 months) telling her that she<br/>
would be pretty if she got earrings too. So then we talked about beauty,<br/>
and I asked her if she knew how pretty she was. She said &quot;sure Mom. God<br/>
don&#39;t create no junk&quot;.<br/>
It just never seizes to amaze me that the smallest amount of peer<br/>
suggestion can override what a child sees their family living day-to-day,<br/>
at least temporarily anyway.<br/>

<br/>
I know when Tara wanted her ears done, it was because all her little friends <br/>
had them already. As long as she understood what they would do and what she <br/>
had to do to keep them clean, I had no problem with when she wanted it done. <br/>
My Sierra has no interest in having her ears have holes in them!!! Maybe <br/>
when she gets older, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I thought of when you mentioned why your daughter wants them <br/>
was when my mom puts her clip on earrings (at 77, she never had her ears <br/>
done) on my Alyssa, who is 2. She comes and shows us and of course the first <br/>
thing we all say is, &quot;Look how beautiful you look!!&quot; Maybe something like <br/>
that innocently said stuck in her mind. It could just be her own taste and <br/>
feeling. She thinks they are beautiful (the earrings that she doesn&#39;t have) <br/>
and of course would see someone more beautiful with some on. I somehow don&#39;t <br/>
think at 5, with how you say you are with her, she is into material things <br/>
and sees beauty as only with accessories!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We do this too, just never thought about it. Dd&#39;s are always putting on<br/>
fashion shows, and playing dress up like movie stars, princesses and<br/>
such. Dh is always giving them the &quot;you look just fabulous daaling&quot; and<br/>
&quot;aren&#39;t you beautiful&quot;. Come to think of it, 3dd has a preoccupation with<br/>
&quot;beautiful&quot; too. She only wants to wear her &quot;beautiful dresses&quot;, and just<br/>
last night she only wanted to sleep on the<br/>
&quot;beautiful sofa&quot;, the floral one. Maybe we just use the word &quot;beautiful&quot;<br/>
too lightly in our house. Oh well, I guess it is better than &quot;ugly&quot; or<br/>
the one that makes my skin craw that I often hear from other children,<br/>
&quot;hate&quot;.<br/>
Thanks for the insight, Mary.<br/>
