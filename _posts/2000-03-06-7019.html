<br/>
&gt; There are a lot of ideas about how to handle boundareis and<br/>
&gt; consequences for breaking the boundaries that at first seem a little &quot;harsh&quot;<br/>
&gt; but when combined with the gently loving way she advocates, are rather (for<br/>
&gt; me personally) very effective.  Concepst such as no second and third<br/>
&gt; chances, no negotiating with an unreasonable child, which I had always<br/>
&gt; thought of as over controlling, now make perfect sence to me.  Anyways, as I<br/>
&gt; said I cant possibly sum it all up in a neat little package...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hi joshua,<br/>
<br/>
i think personal boundaries are necessary no matter what age the person(s) whom<br/>
you&#39;re living with, but i am very suspicious of consequence. if they are not<br/>
natural (i.e. touch a hot pan and you&#39;ll burn yourself) or directly dealing<br/>
with issues of safety (i.e. running into the road), imo, they are just<br/>
rules/controls but with a different name.<br/>
<br/>
for me unschooling is about self-motivation on all levels.  our 4 yo is very<br/>
proud that he helps out and we&#39;ve never made him.  he also refuses much more<br/>
than he helps:) we just keep providing the opportunity for him to join in - a<br/>
family adventure of cleaning a kind of &#39;whistle while you work&#39; deal.  when he<br/>
makes a mess, especially after i specifically asked him not to do it, i will<br/>
point out the necessity of cleaning right away.  for example last night he<br/>
mashed grapes in the tub, i asked him to clean it up.  he refused.  all i said<br/>
was i didn&#39;t think that i should have to clean up something i had asked him not<br/>
to do, but it needed to be clean so i would happily do it.  he promptly cleaned<br/>
while we talked about what he was doing (i.e. getting the right temp water,<br/>
what to use etc.).<br/>
<br/>
there were no consequence because i would have cleaned it and that would have<br/>
been the end - no guilt trips, no punishment just a simple communication of my<br/>
take on it, as he would do if he felt i had imposed upon him.  we&#39;re a family.<br/>
we communicate everything including our frustration but we never give any kind<br/>
of rewards, even in the form of a negative -i.e. punishments - no report cards<br/>
of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
we do loss our tempers ( we are painfully human:) and rene&#39; does push to find<br/>
our limits which he succeeds at with great skill:)  this for me falls in the<br/>
realm of boundaries and personal dynamics and is just life.   so the best way<br/>
to handle it is to be exactly who you are.  a simple and honest approach.  let<br/>
them know who you are and where you&#39;re at so they will do the same.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Suffice it to say, I highly recommend purchasing the book, or looking for it<br/>
&gt; at your local library.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My children are respondig to the tougher consequences for getting out of<br/>
&gt; line by surprising me with more responsable, capable, and self-motivated<br/>
&gt; behavior.  For instance, they now remember to put their tooth brushes away<br/>
&gt; and wipe up any spilled toothpaste after brushing, and they dont fuss about<br/>
&gt; having to brush after breakfast, they can clean up their toys with less and<br/>
&gt; less direction from me... Before I used to stand over their shoulders<br/>
&gt; instructing them on each move.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope that helps a little,<br/>
&gt; Joshua<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s great that your kids are having a positive response to your new<br/>
approach.   i think i&#39;ll have to read the book because it sounds too<br/>
authoritarian for my taste but it would be unfair for me to assume that.  i&#39;m<br/>
curious if your kids are displaying obedience or free will?  and if this new<br/>
approach will be of value to them when they become adults?  this is all very<br/>
new for me because all i have to fall back o is what not to do.<br/>

&gt; Hi Amy,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I loved Buzz&#39; response. Ditto there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In retrospect , I think that being worried when you are starting something<br/>
&gt; new is pretty healthy. After all, worry comes from caring and wanting to<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; the right thing. In the case of our children, I think worry comes part and<br/>
&gt; parcel with the job of parenting. We want to make sure that we are not<br/>
&gt; &#39;missing&#39; a piece of the learning pie. We don&#39;t want to mess up so we<br/>
worry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Time will help. Reading a lot about home education will help (there were<br/>
&gt; few histories written about homelearning familes when I started but there<br/>
&gt; is a proliferation now!). But the most important thing is to have your own<br/>
&gt; person mantra to remind yourself to accept how you feel as normal. Any new<br/>
&gt; job, any new relationship of merit  will cause you to worry and<br/>
think...&quot;am<br/>
&gt; I doing the right thing? am I doing too much? am I doing too little? what<br/>
&gt; if it doesn&#39;t work out?&quot; Things are no different with homelearning, but<br/>
&gt; personally, after what I have seen in our family, it is only a win-win<br/>
&gt; situation. There are ups-and-downs-and-in-betweens in the beginning just<br/>
&gt; like any new job . But things settle down over the years and the<br/>
&gt; being/learning together becomes second nature.  The secret is to let go<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; accept your &#39;stage&#39; of your &#39;new job&#39;. Remember that &quot;this too will pass&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have done a thorough job of convincing your family that this is the<br/>
&gt; right thing I would assume that you know the pros of homelearning. I think<br/>
&gt; that you need to listen to the messages that you gave them. I kept a<br/>
&gt; journal at the beginning and write down all the incredible learning<br/>
moments<br/>
&gt; , especially those where I was a spectator or facilitator. I would reread<br/>
&gt; these and they  would buoy me up on the days where the self-doubt would<br/>
nag<br/>
&gt; the loudest. But time was the ultimate salve for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why does your daughter want to go back to school? Maybe she is worried<br/>
&gt; too!!! This may be a place for you to sit down and have a private talk to<br/>
&gt; find out what her worries are...some of them may be the same as yours.<br/>
&gt; You could use this as an opportunity to share your fears and move beyond<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tell us how things are going and send more specific questions. We will try<br/>
&gt; to help you through this period.<br/>
&gt; I would say that most of us have been there...you are not alone.<br/>

on the list utilized it?  I am not sure yet that I agree with her on every<br/>
piont, but there is enough USEFUL info in this book to cause a mini<br/>
revolution in the way I parent.  I have never come across a book that makes<br/>
things so unbelievably clear.  Most parenting books are one persons ideas of<br/>
how to deal with parenting... this is a philosophy with which to approach<br/>
parenting (be firm, clear, and loving all at the same time)  which distills<br/>
down into guidelines about how to deal with the every-day events of living<br/>
with our children.  I can&#39;t possibly do it justice in one little post.<br/>
Essentially it just talks about not yo-yoing back and forth between<br/>
permissive(and loving) and authoritarian(but not loving), by adopting the<br/>
attitude that it is possible to be both loving, supporting, (ie not scolding<br/>
ever) AND steadfastly clear about boundaries and consequences at the same<br/>
time.  There are a lot of ideas about how to handle boundareis and<br/>
consequences for breaking the boundaries that at first seem a little &quot;harsh&quot;<br/>
but when combined with the gently loving way she advocates, are rather (for<br/>
me personally) very effective.  Concepst such as no second and third<br/>
chances, no negotiating with an unreasonable child, which I had always<br/>
thought of as over controlling, now make perfect sence to me.  Anyways, as I<br/>
said I cant possibly sum it all up in a neat little package...<br/>
<br/>
Suffice it to say, I highly recommend purchasing the book, or looking for it<br/>
at your local library.<br/>
<br/>
My children are respondig to the tougher consequences for getting out of<br/>
line by surprising me with more responsable, capable, and self-motivated<br/>
behavior.  For instance, they now remember to put their tooth brushes away<br/>
and wipe up any spilled toothpaste after brushing, and they dont fuss about<br/>
having to brush after breakfast, they can clean up their toys with less and<br/>
less direction from me... Before I used to stand over their shoulders<br/>
instructing them on each move.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps a little,<br/>

&gt; Should I just order all three or is there one particular book that I<br/>

hi joshua,
<p>i have two books i would <u>highly</u> recommend.
<p>the first: <u>punished by rewards: the trouble with gold stars, incentive
plans, a&#39;s, praise, and other bribes</u> by alfie kohn.&nbsp; here&#39;s an
exert:
<p>&#39;the great majority of books and seminars on bringing up children share
three features, all of which are generally taken for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;
first, more talk is devoted to eliminating unwanted behavior than to promoting
positive values and skills;&nbsp; second, step-by-step plans are provided
for parents to implement;&nbsp; and third, copious use is made of punishment
(&quot;consequences&quot;) and/or rewards (&#39;positive reinforcements&quot;)....
<p>each of these three features is connected to the other two.&nbsp;&nbsp;
someone who chooses to focus on stopping bad behavior is apt to prefer
a program that describes exactly what to do and say, and conversely, someone
who wants to follow a recipe is apt to think in terms of day-to-day challenges
rather than long-term values.&nbsp;&nbsp; both orientations, meanwhile,
seem consistent with tactics that emphasize extrinsic control.&#39; (pg 228)
<p>&#39;my hope, though, is that even the reader who doesn&#39;t accept every argument
offered here, or who has doubts about the import of one or another piece
of research, may nonetheless decide that there is enough evidence to justify
calling into question a set of beliefs and practices that affect us deeply
every day of our lives.&nbsp; (pg 284)
<p>the second: <u>giving the love that heals: a guide for parents</u> by
harville hendrix and helen hunt.&nbsp; here&#39;s an exert from this book:
<p>&#39;the conscious parent meets the needs of the child by providing safety,
support, and structure for the child as she moves through each developmental
stage.&nbsp;&nbsp; he is attuned to the unique personality and temperament
of his child and able to see what his child needs as she grows and changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
he is educated about the developmental stages of children and is able to
stay alert and flexible in interactions with her.
<p>he is intentional in his interactions with his child, rather than reactive.&nbsp;
and this intentionality can be see in his use of intentional dialogue in
conversation, especially when the dialogue is difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; he
takes the processes of intentional dialogue - mirroring, validating, and
emphasizing - and finds ways to make these responses part of his daily
interactions with his child.
<p>he has tools for dealing with his child&#39;s frustrations, anger, and regressions
that turn these potentially disruptive emotional responses into occasions
for strengthening the child&#39;s wholeness and maintaining her connection
to her parents, her immediate environment, and the larger world.&nbsp;
and he has ways of promoting laughter, creative expression, spiritual depth,
and moral character as his child begins to express the journey through
life.&#39;&nbsp; (pg38)
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">BUT, still... perhaps it is in part because I have
been unclear about always
<br>treating them with all the respect and dignity of an adult friend....
I find
<br>myself searching for a way out of the power struggles with children
that are
<br>acting difficult and uncooperatively.</blockquote>
i think everyone who is attempting to raise their children in a way that
is a departure from the way they were raised has this same issue/struggle.&nbsp;
once a child moves out of the infant stage autonomy comes to the fore and
when this is threatened a power struggle ensues - in our house this happens
on a daily basis:)&nbsp; but as these two books point out the positive
behavior and the parent/child connection/relationship must remain the most
important goals because these are the things that will foster good &#39;long-term
values&#39; - the ultimate goal of any parent.&nbsp; (&#39;a forest for the trees&#39;
sort of deal)
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">And I am led to the conclusion that
<br>parental authority is still IMPORTANT, even in the midst of a treating
our
<br>children with all the RESPECT of an adult, I still think they need
me to be
<br>an unwavering authority and &quot;rule maker&quot; on some things other than
just
<br>safety and personal boundary issues.</blockquote>
i do believe that parents hold the authority and over time slowly gives
more and more of it over to the child as the child is able to handle it
(the latin educare, i&#39;m told, means &#39;bring to adulthood&#39;).&nbsp; but i
also believe that it is <u>very</u> easy to abuse this power and justify
this &#39;abuse&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&#39;s why i think it is crucial that this
authority be balanced with mutual understanding (between parent and child),
so that mutual trust is fostered and maintained.&nbsp; without the balance
of these basic component, the parent/child relationship begins to erode
deeply effecting all other relationships - present and future.
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">In essence I think I still need to
<br>have some, carefully thought out, expectations of their behavior.&nbsp;
For
<br>instance, if my child was being cruel to a defenceless animal... I
would be
<br>responsable to protect the animal and to offer my child 1. a clear
boundary
<br>about how to treat animals and reasons behind that 2. a dis-incintive
to
<br>continue the inappropriate behaviour(consequence for stepping over
that
<br>boundary again), and 3. discusing or checking in to see what could
be bihind
<br>the behaviour so that attention can be given to helping to solve any
<br>underlying problem that might be making the child angry...</blockquote>
i agree with you except with #2.&nbsp;&nbsp; i would teach compassion and
empathy - bring into focus the positve/desired behavior rather than casting
the attention on &#39;eliminating the bad behavior&#39;.
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">&nbsp;
<br>I just cant help but think that without this kind of guidance a child
will
<br>become willful and stubborn in spite of being treated with as much
love and
<br>respect and resonableness as possible.&nbsp; I could be entirely wrong
here... it
<br>is just my experience so far in life.</blockquote>

<p><br>actually much research has shown that when the focus is put on the
bad behavior and the child is punished or given consequences the child
actually becomes less cooperative and more willful and stubborn - personally
i have experienced this with rene&#39;.&nbsp; i am very controlling by training
and have spent more hours than i care to count in power struggles and have
found that cooperation is easier to attain when the child/person has the
free will and chooses it rather than be coerced into it and to be honest
this is is true for me as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; i am much happier to cooperate
if i&#39;m approached via a request instead of a demand.&nbsp; aflie kohn whole
book is about this point.
<p>guidance, imo, must be done in the form of modeling and it must be done
within the context of fostering the parent/child relationship.&nbsp; if
this relationship is put on the &#39;back burner&#39; for any reason the child
will begin to feel a loss of connection and feel a threat to their developing
autonomy.&nbsp;&nbsp; and if this process of autonomy is repeatedly threaten
then their process of achieving adulthood will be thwarted and power struggles
increase. jmo

<p>yes much to my husband&#39;s dismay&nbsp; lol
<p><font face="Arial">am not suggesting you are overly permissive either...
I am just bringing up the point that as an authority figure, you must enforce
boundaries somehow...</font>
<p>my son is very clear on the fact that i have &#39;ultimate veto power&#39;.&nbsp;
for example he really wants a gameboy color and we are not getting one
but have told him that we are willing to &#39;convert&#39; our bathroom into a
&#39;chemistry lab&#39; and that makes him happy - he is always &#39;doing experiments&#39;
so i know that this would give him at least as much joy as a gameboy color.&nbsp;
also i&#39;m very quick tempered (not something i&#39;m proud of but if you want
honesty from your kids i believe the parent needs to pave the way)&nbsp;
and have little patience for acts of manipulation, so clear boundaries
are drawn.&nbsp; it&#39;s just that i limited the boundaries to really big
issues.&nbsp; like spitting i will not tolerate it and my son is <u>very</u>
clear about this:)
<p>when rene&#39; started to crawl i set it in my mind that i wanted the &#39;yes&#39;s&#39;
to far out weigh the &#39;no&#39;s&#39; and we&#39;ve succeeded thus far.&nbsp; so don&#39;t
get me wrong,&nbsp; boundaries - which are often articulated by a firm
&#39;no&#39; - are not only good for the parent but the child learns 2 really important
things -1) to respect another&#39;s rights and&nbsp; 2) they learn not to allow
another person to take advantage of them i.e. that they themselves have
rights and should stand up for them if need be.&nbsp; imo since human nature
is so complex it makes it very difficult to have a simple stance - but
if we were able to make a simple stance life would be very boring:)
<p><font face="Arial">Also, I now believe it is important for children
to &quot;surrender&quot; to their (hopefully loving and caring) parental authority.
This is a little difficult for me to articulate... but I really think there
are situations where the most courageous and loving thing to be done as
a parent is to stand up to my child lovingly but firmly and without protecting
him.&nbsp; I could go on.... :-)</font>
<p>regarding the concept of &#39;surrender&#39; (which sounds very christian to
me), if this is how you truly feel then imo it would be the right way for
you to be.&nbsp; there is lot of rhetoric and tons of opinions floating
around but for me the bottom line is - each parent needs to be true to
themselves and to their own world view.&nbsp; we can listen to each others
opinions and have good and exciting discussions and perhaps expand our
own views but ultimate we must do what makes sense to us as individuals.

&gt; &gt; My children are respondig to the tougher consequences for getting out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; line by surprising me with more responsable, capable, and self-motivated<br/>
&gt; &gt; behavior.  For instance, they now remember to put their tooth brushes<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; and wipe up any spilled toothpaste after brushing, and they dont fuss<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; having to brush after breakfast, they can clean up their toys with less<br/>

&gt; &gt; instructing them on each move.<br/>

&gt; it&#39;s great that your kids are having a positive response to your new<br/>
&gt; approach.   i think i&#39;ll have to read the book because it sounds too<br/>
&gt; authoritarian for my taste but it would be unfair for me to assume that.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Susan...&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, you are very effective at 
communicating your ideas!&nbsp; I agree with your points about emphasizing the 
posative attributes and behaviours rather than focusing on the negative...And I 
completely agree that in most instances rewards and punishments are not 
effective, and that it is&nbsp;VERY easy to abuse parental authority by being 
unclear, unfair, or angry.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">But I think it is equally easy to deny your 
parental authority and inadvertantly burden your children with too much 
power.&nbsp; I view it as another one of those issues where niether extreme 
(authoritarian/ over controlling or permissive) is truely balanced...&nbsp; I am 
not suggesting you are overly permissive either... I am just bringing up the 
point that as an authority figure, you must enforce boundaries somehow... 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">For me, providing a &quot;time out&quot; for crossing a clear 
boundary, is more along the lines of temporarily restricting freedom&#39;s than 
&quot;punishment&quot;... but it certainly is a consequence of crossing the boundary.... 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, I now believe it is important for children to 
&quot;surrender&quot; to their (hopefully loving and caring) parental authority.&nbsp;This 
is a little difficult for me to articulate... but I really think there are 
situations where the most couragous and loving thing to be done as a parent is 
to stand up to my child lovingly but firmly and without protecting him.&nbsp; I 
could go on.... :-)&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">(I tend to get a little wordy when I am whestling 
with something difficult for me to articulate)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I will look for both of these books at the 
library,</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">have a good day,</font></div>
