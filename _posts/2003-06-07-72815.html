<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482026298">We have 6 children still living at home, and last year I only &quot;homeschooled&quot; <br/>
my 15 yo son.  We plan to school our two foster sons and our other boy (12, <br/>
11, 10) next year, if all the court stuff goes well.<br/>
<br/>
The two girls, 12 and 17 went to school for the first time about 2 years ago. <br/>
 They love public school and do well there, but my husband and I have noticed <br/>
so many negative changes in them since they began going...sick a lot, <br/>
grouchy, impatient with siblings (much more than they used to be), a lot of ugly, <br/>
mean backtalk.  It&#39;s like we&#39;re on the outside looking in at them, and they don&#39;t <br/>
see the differences in their lives now...the stress, being tired all the <br/>
time, no time for life!!  And to top it all off, they ride the bus almost an hour <br/>
each way everyday.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:  If we are making changes in our parenting techniques, <br/>
moving towards much more freedom for them, letting them make most decisions in <br/>
their own lives, would it be wrong to take them back out of school if they <br/>
don&#39;t want to homeschool/unschool?  We have been talking about it with them a LOT <br/>
lately.  Husband hates the school system, is so excited about taking the <br/>
other boys out this next year.  He is a hair from putting his foot down and <br/>
forbidding them to go back.  <br/>
<br/>
Ugh!!!!  This is sooooo hard for us right now.  I don&#39;t want to alienate the <br/>
girls, make them feel we&#39;ve ruined their lives by pulling them out.  12 yo <br/>
plays cello and is in the orchestra.  We live in a very rural town in WV, our <br/>
homeschool group is very minimal (a core of about 6 families that go to <br/>
everything, and 4 of them are fundamentalist/republican/HSLDA/curriculum homeschoolers. <br/>
 LOL!)  We have no neighbors with kids their age.  <br/>
<br/>
Have any of you been in this situation?  What did you do?  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Have any of you been in this situation?  What did you do?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you cut off a lot of response you might have gotten by asking the <br/>
question that way.<br/>
People who hadn&#39;t been in that situation didn&#39;t respond!<br/>
<br/>
Having not been in that situation, I know for sure what I WOULD do, because <br/>
it has come up in other lesser situations.<br/>
<br/>
IF an outside activity or relationship is making a kid cranky and mean at <br/>
home, I say &quot;You can&#39;t be cranky and mean here, it&#39;s not okay.  If it&#39;s the fault <br/>
of this friend/thing/hobby that you&#39;re being this way, then I&#39;m no longer as <br/>
happy with your choice to do that.  I don&#39;t mind you going/being, as long as <br/>
you can still be helpful/kind/compassionate here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would tell a kid that MY choice was that they not go to school, for lots of <br/>
reasons.  <br/>
If that kid was bringing emotional and attitudinal school detritus home I <br/>
would say &quot;That is one of the reasons.   Bad enough school seems to be doing you <br/>
some of the damage I feared, but if you&#39;re bringing the damaging parts home, <br/>
that&#39;s no good.  Leave it there or don&#39;t go anymore.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m confused about this reply. It sounds like you are saying that your<br/>
family can&#39;t bring their negative feelings home, that you won&#39;t welcome<br/>
them in a bad mood or unhappy. It reads like you are saying &quot;I told you<br/>
so&quot; instead of allowing the kids to process negative/uncomfortable<br/>
feelings in the safety of their home. <br/>
<br/>
I think there is a difference between feeling &quot;cranky&quot; and then acting<br/>
out by being &quot;mean&quot; also. <br/>
<br/>
Please clarify for me. This doesn&#39;t seem to jive with the attitudes<br/>
expressed in the article about your sister and her detached from school<br/>
experience, but I hope it is just that I&#39;m not understanding you.<br/>

<br/>
I was going to answer this after I finished e-mail yesterday, but e-mail <br/>
never ended, Marty wanted the computer, I had unexpected company, and suddenly <br/>
it&#39;s TODAY!<br/>
  Sorry.  I wasn&#39;t ignoring it, I was saving it for a calm space.<br/>
<br/>
A bad mood that&#39;s contained within the person is one thing.  A new attitude <br/>
with which they torment siblings school-style is another thing altogether.<br/>
<br/>
School creates situations in which kids create their own hierarchies and <br/>
social ranks, because humans need those things to know how to act, and if you put <br/>
kids in same-age lock-up groups, they take on unnatural social roles.   <br/>
<br/>
If a child can go and live there and then shake it off at the door so that <br/>
they don&#39;t inflict it on their otherwise homeschooled family, that&#39;s using <br/>
school for their personal reasons AT SCHOOL.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It reads like you are saying &quot;I told you<br/>
so&quot; instead of allowing the kids to process negative/uncomfortable<br/>
feelings in the safety of their home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It would be a gigantic &quot;I told you so,&quot; whether the mom said anything or not.<br/>
<br/>
But if the mom says &quot;You can go to school but I myself am not going to become <br/>
the fullblown school-mom.  Your homework is your own business, and I&#39;m not <br/>
going to invest myself emotionally in your grades because I don&#39;t believe grades <br/>
are good for you,&quot; it&#39;s setting a boundary.  The mom is going to defend the <br/>
peace of school-free home, and the school-attending kid needs to try to assist <br/>
in that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think there is a difference between feeling &quot;cranky&quot; and then acting<br/>
out by being &quot;mean&quot; also. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not even thinking of just being mean.  I&#39;m thinking worst-case scenario <br/>
that the kid could come home and belittle the non-attending kids, or insult <br/>
them, or posture in such ways that schooling itself becomes a big factor in <br/>
interpersonal relations.  I wouldn&#39;t look the other way and let that happen for a <br/>
minute.<br/>
<br/>
If one of mine goes to school, I will say strongly that school is a place for <br/>
them to visit, not a thing to drag home.<br/>

to attack school, though he is more than willing to cite the <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve wondered if it appears as &quot;non-support&quot; of him in his choice <br/>
if I look down on school too forecfully. He did say, however, at the <br/>
end of the year that he was glad to be home most of the time and <br/>
definitely didn&#39;t want a full load ever. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So if a child with parents who unschool, decides to go to school, they do it <br/>
but the parent does not support them in their decision?  Or only if it becomes <br/>
a problem with the children/adults in the home do you not support the <br/>
attitudes?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about what&#39;s really being said, I have one child who is thinking <br/>
about taking a semester off from college and one that wants to go and tour a <br/>
private school that one of her friends is considering going to.<br/>
<br/>
She hasn&#39;t mentioned GOING to this school but it does bring up the thoughts <br/>
after reading the replies.  <br/>
<br/>
You REALLY would not help a child with homework that asked?  I can see not <br/>
buying into the grading part of it.  But I can&#39;t imagine not supporting my child <br/>
in something they really wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
Gives me something to think about.  I guess if it was really something I was <br/>
against, I would not stop them but not support them either.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Close enough! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So the priority is on school-free home.??<br/>
<br/>
If the other kids were still wanting to be unschoolers, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if the child really does want a mom who is involved <br/>
<br/>
(after-prom committee, or helping with homework, <br/>
<br/>
parent-teacher conferences etc...)?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are AFTER-prom committees!?  yikes!  <br/>
My first thought was a morning-after-pill clinic.  (BAD thoughts, bad <br/>
thoughts...)<br/>
<br/>
Depends.  Depends on the kid, depends on the school.<br/>
My kids would probably learn pretty quickly they did NOT want parent-teacher <br/>
conferences with me there. &lt;g&gt;  Maybe they could take their dad.<br/>
<br/>
I could give them a list of surrogate moms, some friend-of-family who could <br/>
go with them for appearances maybe. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The way I feel right now, if Marty wanted to go to high school next year I&#39;d <br/>
be more than happy to see him in plays or go to his concerts or go to a <br/>
football game if he were a player or musician, and I would help him with homework on <br/>
an intellectual level (idea getting or explanations) but I would NOT help on <br/>
an emotional or emergency-scheduling level.  If he stalled until the last <br/>
minute on a big project I would say &quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry.  It&#39;s not that big a deal.&quot; <br/>
 If he got upset about the amount of nature of homework, I would say &quot;Huh.  <br/>
That&#39;s one of the worst things about school.  You don&#39;t have to go to school if <br/>
you don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you think that your posture toward school could be taken <br/>
<br/>
antagonistically by the child?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In what way?<br/>
It&#39;s not antagonism toward the child.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I find that my son, who only <br/>
<br/>
attended one class per day this year, is quick to defend kids in <br/>
<br/>
school and whether or not they are learning. he doesn&#39;t wnat me <br/>
<br/>
to attack school, though he is more than willing to cite the <br/>
<br/>
weaknesses of the system himself.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That sounds like he&#39;s being devil&#39;s advocate and doesn&#39;t want that to be a <br/>

to be there and they don&#39;t is a factor he might not be able to really fathom.<br/>

<br/>
if I look down on school too forecfully.&gt;&gt;<br/>

It WOULD be non-support of their choice if they go to school.  I will NOT <br/>

enough to do it without my full support.  I wouldn&#39;t sabotage it, but I sure <br/>
wouldn&#39;t play the school&#39;s enforcer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811318954">Thank you Sandra. Perfect. That really clarified it for me.<br/>
<br/>
I just said to my son the other day, &quot;You know, you really don&#39;t <br/>
have to do any of the classes you&#39;re interested in if at any point <br/>
the love you have for the topic is sucked out by school tests and <br/>
drudgery.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He grinned. &quot;Mom, of course I KNOW that. I wouldn&#39;t stay in a <br/>
class that made me hate what I love. I&#39;d just quit.&quot;<br/>

So, no worries. :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Glena, I&#39;m not Sandra, but I did have a son in school this year <br/>
one period a day. It was really, really hard on me. He did fine <br/>
actually. But I found myself confronted with ugly feelings that I <br/>
had never felt before in all my years of homeschooling. i was <br/>
evalauting my son by his grades. I was worried about his <br/>
&quot;performance&quot; more than I was about whether he was learning. I <br/>
found myself &quot;getting on him&quot; to study at times I felt were <br/>
smarter, more effective and better.<br/>
<br/>
This is not how we normally live!<br/>
<br/>
But school brought it out in me and it was yucky. :( I guess all <br/>
those years of going to school myself suddenly came to the fore <br/>
and dominated my otherwise good sense. <br/>
<br/>
The way we worked it out finally is that I let go of grades totally. I <br/>
did help my son with studying for exams because he wanted it <br/>
and I could be of help. I did pretty well until fijnal exams when I <br/>
relapsed pretty badly. I did apologize and we came to a healing <br/>
from it.<br/>
<br/>
But for next year, I told him that I was going to stay out of all <br/>
studying and homework. I&#39;m happy to offer help with material, but <br/>
not with habits or deadlines. These suck me back into MY school <br/>
mindset and it undermines him.<br/>
<br/>
So when I rad Sandra&#39;s words, I took them as a defense against <br/>
my own temptation to shift how I view parenting and learning. <br/>
School is a powerful vortex that gets to those of us who&#39;ve been <br/>
schooled ourselves. I didn&#39;t expect that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would be very sad if my daughter asked to go back to school, even if it is <br/>
the chi chi private school her friend is thinking about going to.<br/>
<br/>
I would also hope I wouldn&#39;t allow her to make her decision based on my <br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
It is probably not even an issue as she hasn&#39;t mentioned actually attending <br/>
school at all, the post just brought some thoughts and feelings into my day <br/>
that made me THINK about what I would do/say/feel if I were in that position.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve had the experience already of being the PTA mom, room mom, <br/>
volunteer, AFTER PROM committee mom (it&#39;s a BIG party lock in type thing to keep kids <br/>
from finding OTHER, less desirable in the eyes of the school things to do) <br/>
and just about everything that comes with schooling, I know about it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
WANT to do that again but I guess I probably would if my child asked me.<br/>
<br/>
What I won&#39;t do is nod and smile and act like it matters to me that a project <br/>
is done or not done or that grades that a teacher gives matter.  But then I <br/>
never really did that either, so it probably wouldn&#39;t be expected.<br/>
<br/>
I can see Cait think about school and letting it pass, because her friends <br/>
bring it up very often.  They think it would be really cool for her to go or <br/>
them to NOT go.  Of course the most likely would be Cait going, because their <br/>
mothers are NEVER going to let them just &quot;hang out at home&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she would want to go to even one class a day, maybe drama, she <br/>
hears it&#39;s way cool.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input.  School is just way too stressful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461194875">&lt;&lt;You REALLY would not help a child with homework that asked?  I can see not<br/>
buying into the grading part of it.  But I can&#39;t imagine not supporting my <br/>
child<br/>
in something they really wanted to do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t speak for anyone else but you pose an interesting question.  Quiet <br/>
thought provoking!<br/>
<br/>
If I had a child that wanted to go to school, yes, if asked, I would help <br/>
them with their homework.  Not because it was a requirement, but if my child <br/>
was truly interested and wanted my help.  I would never push them to do it <br/>
in any way.  They would know that I am not supportive of public schools but <br/>
that I support THEM.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I wouldn&#39;t go full blast into being a room mom and supporting the <br/>
school through PTA funds, etc.  UNLESS, being a room mom meant that I might <br/>
have more involvment with my child and it didn&#39;t bother my child having me <br/>
there.  In that case, it would be out of my own desire to be near my child <br/>
and his desire to have me there.  I would do that.<br/>
<br/>
I would help with homework, if asked, just as I help out with various <br/>
schoolish things at home that my children ask for help with.  Nicholette <br/>
asks to do reading and phonics work in some old workbooks and textbooks we <br/>
have and I oblige.  Sometimes, I might offer another way to learn the <br/>
material, but she truly loves the schoolishness of it all.  That&#39;s fine with <br/>
me.  I love doing textbook work myself!  I recently purchased some textbooks <br/>
from our local college to learn on my own and hopefully to later clep out of <br/>
if I decide I want a degree in something.  Not that far into the future at <br/>
this time, though. &lt;g&gt;  Right now, it&#39;s just curiosity in a new field and <br/>
something to help me out of some personal financial struggles.  If it piques <br/>
my interest enough, I may later use that knowledge to become a CPA to make <br/>
some side money from home.  Probably, I&#39;ll just have the knowledge for my <br/>
own good.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing is that if our children want to go to school and we are <br/>
firm believers against it, that by fully supporting it, we are going against <br/>
our own principles and giving our children a double standard.  If we arm our <br/>
children with knowledge and empower them with confidence, I also believe <br/>
they will come home.  I cannot imagine a child wanting to be stuck in a <br/>
situation where they have no control.  Even with parents who do not adhere <br/>
to the importance of grades and such, there will be loads of pressure from <br/>
teachers, administrators, friends and the like to conform.  I just don&#39;t see <br/>
how a child would stay in a situation like that.  Perhaps if their social <br/>
life in school outweighs the rest, they might make those decisions.  Perhaps <br/>
if they are intent on being a pro football player, they will ride out high <br/>
school in order to have that experience and exposure public school affords <br/>
football players.  But, perhaps they will find the social life they crave in <br/>
ps and decide they no longer need that as an outlet and will use their <br/>
resources to continue the social life outside the school walls.  They might <br/>
possibly decide that football isn&#39;t in the cards and want to come home to <br/>
fully pursue new interests.<br/>
<br/>
I think school, especially for those children who have not attended, is a <br/>
fantasy; a falacy they will all too soon figure out and want to avoid in <br/>
pursuit of their own dreams.  Their own lives.  On their own time and in <br/>
their own way.<br/>

Nope, no kit or pattern, just asking others thoughts and opinions, I <br/>
recognize no one here is going to tell me THIS is the way it HAS to be done and the <br/>
ONLY way, well they MIGHT but we all make up our own minds in the end.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not complaining about anything either.  Just wondering to what level you <br/>
would or would not support a child that chooses school.  I think it was <br/>
clearly answered.<br/>
<br/>
My post was actually written much earlier in the day but just came through.  <br/>
It is NOT meant to be antagonistic in anyway and I&#39;m not sure why you feel it <br/>
was.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;If one of mine goes to school, I will say strongly that school is a place <br/>
for <br/>
them to visit, not a thing to drag home.<br/>
Sandra&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess this statement made me think that you would feel it was something <br/>
your child was doing on his/her own and wasn&#39;t really up for discussion or <br/>
involvement at home.  Kinda like well go if you want to but don&#39;t drag home that <br/>
part of your life.  In a post since this one, I can see that is not what you <br/>
meant at all.  That was what worried me the part I just copied above.  If a child <br/>
went to school it would obviously be a BIG part of their life and day and I <br/>
didn&#39;t understand the thoughts of not bringing home their &quot;day&quot; to share.<br/>
<br/>
I do see that you&#39;ve expounded on that thought later and I understand fully <br/>
what you are saying.<br/>
    <br/>
It was a post that interested me as I was pondering if my child really might <br/>
think about attending school next year and how I personally would feel about <br/>
it.  Wondering about how others have or might handle a similar circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
I think the replies were thoughtful and very helpful.<br/>

school, I wanted her to come home. Very much so. She was really on the fence<br/>
about what to do. We laid out a few choices and I left it all up to her. She<br/>
chose school. I did support her decision, although I didn&#39;t like it, because<br/>
we both understood exactly what that meant for each of us. She also had the<br/>
choice to stop at any time.<br/>
<br/>
I am not an involved school mom. Did that when she was younger and I thought<br/>
I had no choice and wanted to make the best of it. I go to school when it<br/>
has to do with college, which she wants to go to, or a matter of her safety.<br/>
Her homework is hers along in the fact that I don&#39;t ask what she has or if<br/>
she&#39;s done it. If she needs any kind of help with a project, she&#39;ll ask I<br/>
certainly help with what I can. Grades are no big deal to me and she is much<br/>
more relaxed now in how she looks at them. So from that, she&#39;s actually<br/>
doing better and does like the grades she gets. When she brings home the<br/>
report, I ask first of all if she is happy with it and look at the comments<br/>
and ask about those and the teachers. It&#39;s not all well did you get A&#39;s or<br/>
B&#39;s?? If she&#39;s happy and satisfied, then I am happy for her. If she isn&#39;t,<br/>
we talk about making it work better for her.<br/>
<br/>
If there is any problem at school that she talks to me about, and we talk a<br/>
lot and it&#39;s only natural that some of those stories involve school, I will<br/>
ask if I can do anything to help. The answer has always been no and she<br/>
handles matters just fine.<br/>
<br/>
So I do support her decision along with helping when I can, when she wants<br/>
it. I offer her tools to manage the things she needs help with, whether it&#39;s<br/>
because of school or something else. It&#39;s not very schooly at all. It&#39;s<br/>
pretty much like she has a job during the day and we talk about it<br/>
afterwards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the stance we have taken with the kids in school this past year.  One <br/>
teacher, at the beginning of the school year, would tell our foster son to <br/>
&quot;wait&quot; to go to the bathroom.  I told him if she tells you to wait, you get up, <br/>
go to the bathroom, and tell them to call your mom if they have a problem.  I <br/>
have no patience for stupid rules.  Our situation with them, though, is we <br/>
were not allowed to homeschool them...otherwise I&#39;d have pulled them out 2 years <br/>
ago.  <br/>
<br/>
I am doing pretty much what you explained in your post, with my 2 girls (they <br/>
are older) who are in school.  I help them when they&#39;re stuck on homework, I <br/>
buy them things they need for school, but if they complain about getting up in <br/>
the morning, or the bus ride, or the homework, or the teachers, I let them <br/>
know I understand how they feel, but they knew this is how it would be when they <br/>
began attending.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not do the whole &quot;school mom&quot; thing.  I go to conferences, I talk with <br/>
the foster boy&#39;s special ed teachers when there are problems, and I send <br/>
cookies and such with them to school for parties.  I have attended field trips too.  <br/>
BUT...I don&#39;t make them do homework I feel is useless, or over their heads, <br/>
or BORING...They have gotten some bad grades, maybe because of missed homework, <br/>
but oh well.  The school has pretty much written them off as handicapped or <br/>
retarded, so we&#39;re just crossing our fingers and toes that the adoption will be <br/>
far enough along that they won&#39;t have to go back and deal with the school&#39;s <br/>
crap next year.  <br/>
<br/>
I am going to ask my daughters to read the &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; over <br/>
the summer.  I&#39;m going to take them to cool places, help my oldest daughter <br/>
get a job and a car...maybe bribe a little bit (I know, awful of me,...)  Maybe <br/>
plan some cool trips for the 12 year old and remind her that she could do <br/>
these things all year round if she wasn&#39;t in school.  I&#39;m going to take her much <br/>
more often to our cool unschooling friend&#39;s house and let her stay the night a <br/>
bunch with them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179834305">&lt;&lt;&lt;A bad mood that&#39;s contained within the person is one thing.  A new<br/>
attitude with which they torment siblings school-style is another thing<br/>
altogether.....If a child can go and live there and then shake it off at<br/>
the door so that they don&#39;t inflict it on their otherwise homeschooled<br/>
family, that&#39;s using school for their personal reasons AT SCHOOL.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Thanks for the reply, Sandra. I get what you were saying now -<br/>
specifically in the light of hurting other members of the household,<br/>
more than going through an internal process of feeling bad and needing<br/>
support to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
Phew! Thank goodness. For a moment there I was in a kind of shock - as<br/>
if I had been looking at bedrock and then touched it and it was just<br/>
papier-mache. Denying your children permission to feel bad didn&#39;t seem<br/>
like something that you would advocate - I&#39;m so happy and relieved to<br/>
have confirmation that is not what you meant. <br/>
