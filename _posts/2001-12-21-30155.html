<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Visualization definitely works for me.  I can think of three different <br/>
&gt; examples:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   1.  In a very busy and full parking lot,  I think positively and <br/>
visualize open spaces near the front, and invariably, I almost always <br/>
find one.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Visualization helped me helped me learn the butterfly swim stroke <br/>
when I was in my mid- twenties.  I would study and watch good <br/>
butterflyers on my masters swim team.  I would watch them under the <br/>
water and above the water.  Then I would visualize myself doing it.  I <br/>
would imagine my body undulating and my arms coming out of the water.  I <br/>
would think about my body doing this all day long.  I perfected the <br/>
stroke in a short amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
3.  As the center forward on my women&#39;s soccer team, I visualized the <br/>
ball going past the goalie and into the goal before I kicked my goal <br/>
kicks which almost always went in.  My coach taught me to do this, and <br/>
it really worked.  I was the top scorer on my team!  Brag, brag, brag.<br/>
<br/>
I am a firm believer in the power of visualization.<br/>
