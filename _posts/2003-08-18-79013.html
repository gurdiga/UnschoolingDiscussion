<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888719060">Wandering through my hard disk the other day I came across this poem I<br/>
adapted from prose some years ago.<br/>
It&#39;s appeared in various forms on the web and attributed to various people,<br/>
it actually dates back to prose that appeared in a popular magazine.<br/>
It struck me this list is getting a bit serious&#39; lately, and maybe we should<br/>
all &#39;pick more daisies&#39;.<br/>

I&#39;d Pick More Daisies<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I had my life to live over again,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d try to make more mistakes next time.<br/>
<br/>
I would relax. I would limber up. I wouldn&#39;t strain<br/>
<br/>
I would be sillier than I have been this trip, and it would be fine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know of a very few things I would take seriously.<br/>
<br/>
I would take more trips.<br/>
<br/>
I would climb more mountains, swim more rivers and watch more sunsets,<br/>
leisurely.<br/>
<br/>
I would do more walking and looking, and when I felt like it, do skips.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would eat more ice-cream and less beans and broccoli.<br/>
<br/>
I would have more actual troubles and fewer imaginary ones, less nightmares,<br/>
more dreams<br/>
<br/>
You see, I am one of those people who lives prophylactically<br/>
<br/>
And never gets involved in hair-brained schemes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sensibly and sanely hour after hour,<br/>
<br/>
Day after day, prevention<br/>
<br/>
Just waiting for the next shower<br/>
<br/>
If I could, against the unexpected, I&#39;d take an injection.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I&#39;ve had my moments<br/>
<br/>
And if I had to do it over again<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have more of them, life&#39;s precious fragments<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I&#39;d try to have nothing else, just moments, the essence of Zen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just moments, one after another<br/>
<br/>
Instead of living so many years ahead each day<br/>
<br/>
Allowing the present the future to smother<br/>
<br/>
Instead of letting the present have it&#39;s say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have been one of those people who never go anywhere without<br/>
<br/>
A thermometer, a hot water bottle, a gargle, a raincoat, aspirin and a<br/>
parachute.<br/>
<br/>
If I had it to do over again, I would go places, do things, without question<br/>
or doubt<br/>
<br/>
And travel lighter than I have, maybe even, just my birthday suit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I had my life to live over,<br/>
<br/>
I would start barefooted earlier in the spring<br/>
<br/>
And stay that way later in the fall, bare feet in clover<br/>
<br/>
With each new day, with new sensations, would my senses sing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would play hookey more, I wouldn&#39;t make such good grades<br/>
<br/>
Except by accident, &#39;Could do better&#39; a compliment I&#39;d crave<br/>
<br/>
Life is what happens when all that education fades<br/>
<br/>
Swimming free, in the pool of life, I&#39;d happily bathe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would ride on more merry-go-rounds.<br/>
<br/>
Wander round in mazes.<br/>
<br/>
Trespass where it says &#39;Out of Bounds&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d pick more daisies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
