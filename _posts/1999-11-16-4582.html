&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&lt;So, my vote is to make crime an equal opportunity punisher.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Starting at what age, e.g., 16, 14, 12, 10? Should the IQ of the juvenile<br/>
matter, e.g., should a 14 year old with an IQ of 70 be tried as an adult<br/>
just as readily as a 14 year old with a 130 IQ? What if he or she exhibits<br/>
psychotic symptoms at the time of the offense? Should children/teens who<br/>
have suffered severe and extensive sexual and/or physical abuse be tried as<br/>
adults, and be subject to adult sentences, just as much as kids who haven&#39;t<br/>
expereinced such trauma?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m comfortable with 16 and 17 year olds being tried as adults (in North<br/>
Carolina it&#39;s automatic) but when we start going below 16, we run the risk<br/>
of incarcerating juveniles for decades who might be rehabilitated,<br/>
contribute to society, and, if the humanistic argument doesn&#39;t sway you,<br/>
save us all a ton of money. In addition, some early adolescents with low<br/>
IQ&#39;s are functioning at the level of 6 or 7 year olds. Would we want to put<br/>
a 7 year old on trial as an adult and sentence him or her to 40 years in the<br/>
state prison?<br/>
<br/>
For those under-16 juveniles who pose a high risk of recidivism or who have<br/>
committed heinous crimes (like the rape mentioned in a previous posting) I<br/>
would rather the juvenile/family courts retain jurisdiction over these<br/>
defendants indefinitely with the possibility of extended incarceration,<br/>
intensive supervised probation, and/or mandantory treatment (depending on<br/>
the needs and willingness of the offender). Such a plan would retain the<br/>
rehabilitative emphasis of the juvenile courts but still allow for extensive<br/>
incarceration for the protection of society and retribution for the victims.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, my biggest concern about focusing on lowering the age for trial as<br/>
an adult is that the most effective approach to juvenile crime,<br/>
*prevention*, gets lost in the discussion.<br/>

crime.  Most people don&#39;t refrain from criminal activity because of fear of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121881588">Kids are in fact notoriously harsh in their views of crime and punishment.<br/>
This does not make them necessarily good role models for our system of<br/>
justice.  Children have a generally either/ or sort of view of things which<br/>
does not allow for any subtle nuance to influence their thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Our system encourages the making of excuses instead of taking responsibility.<br/>
Legalistic wrangling instead of justice.<br/>
<br/>
Retributive justice does not work.  People must be held accountable for their<br/>
behaviour but a model which emphasizes punishment does not result in what we<br/>
want which is for people to genuinely feel bad for their bad behaviour and<br/>
undertake the changes needed to ensure that they don&#39;t behave badly again.<br/>
Punishment simply angers people, develops resistance and blinds the offender to<br/>
his responsibility for his behaviour.  Most of the punishments we offer for<br/>
offending behaviours in fact let people off the hook that we really want them<br/>
on...that of personal responsibility for bad actions.<br/>
<br/>
Yes lots of kids know the law better than adults and know their way around the<br/>
system better than adults.  It is another failure of the criminal justice<br/>
system that manipulating the system is the main focus.  Justice emerges from<br/>
communities not the state. Again the sites below might add more divergent<br/>
information to the discussion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Plain and simple.  I think in this country we have a tendency to<br/>

&gt; &gt; They chose to do a vicious and malicious act of violence that drove a<br/>

&lt;&lt; So, my vote is to make crime an equal opportunity punisher.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I would have to agree with Lynda. My nephew was a gang member. He robbed <br/>
pizza drivers at night with a small caliber hand gun. I think that he should <br/>
have been charged as an adult. At the age of 15, he knew just what he was <br/>
doing, and he knew the consequences. For all the money he stole, people he <br/>
scared, and time he wasted, he received 90 days in a boot camp, 30 days in a <br/>
halfway house, and 1 year probation. Mind you, he was on probation when he <br/>
went and robbed 10+ pizza drivers. They dropped that probation for the new <br/>
charges!?!?!<br/>
    Then there is the matter of the little school house killers, and I do not <br/>
mean Columbine....These children live under 4 miles from my home. 4 boys <br/>
plotted, listed, and obtained weapons to kill other children during a pep <br/>
rally that would be held in the gym. They had a list of over 70 children, <br/>
wrote each child&#39;s full name and where the child would sit... They also <br/>
listed where they would place bombs, so that in a panic, no one could get <br/>
away... Their trial started yesterday. 1 child was let go (he is testifying <br/>
against the others) These 3 boys, 14, 14, and 13, are looking at life in <br/>
prison. The mayor thinks that it is too harsh, for they ONLY planned it. It <br/>
did not happen... Can you imagine if it did? this tragedy would be bigger <br/>
than Columbine, and all the added problems that follow. This was not even a <br/>
highschool, it was a middle school. Just in the aftermath of this event, Port <br/>
Huron had numerous bomb threats, fights, and large scale violence. The county <br/>
building closed due to a threat. <br/>
    It is now policy for children, who even mention dismemberment of another <br/>
child, to be suspended from school for no less than 1 day. My 7 yo, ADD son <br/>
went to school after spending the morning playing Playstation, and told a <br/>
little girl that he was going to shoot her, splatter blood all aver the wall. <br/>
SUSPENDED! I think he deserved it. This child is a victim of joint custody, <br/>
and his Dad is not the best role model... He is against me homeschooling.<br/>
    Back to the point. If television is going to show the world decline and <br/>
mark the consequences, then children know the before AND after of every <br/>
wrongdoing. They know in real life that every action has a reaction, and <br/>
every choice has a consequence. They choose to violate the law, they should <br/>
be willing to suffer the penalty. I am raising my children as such.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259941914">Well I have opened the proverbial can of worms.  Those guys did what they did for a variety of reasons including being<br/>
raised in a culture which has routinely committed acts of violence against women and children with complete impunity for<br/>
generations.  A culture which worships violence in a number of guises.  They committed their crime because they had been<br/>
raised to objectify persons and treat them as objects which is the same value which allows the systematic exploitation of<br/>
children around the world for profit.  It is a failure of the heart.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment does not work.  I want those guys to live the rest of their lives with moral awareness of what they have done.  I<br/>
want their entire lives to be dedicated to dealing with the terrible consequences of their actions.  I don&#39;t want them to<br/>
even think for a moment that when they&#39;ve done &quot;the time&quot; that this compensates for their crime.<br/>
<br/>
Real Justice is a much harsher thing in many regards than our legalistic approach.  It allows people back into the community<br/>
and it deals with the real underlying issues.  Forgiveness is the ultimate goal.  Forgiveness for offenses, even self<br/>
forgiveness cannot undo the moral suffering which one has when one has committed offenses against someone else.  A person<br/>
with a full conscience lives with the consequences of their actions.<br/>

    If a child with a low IQ, who mentally is functioning at half his (her) <br/>
age, does a crime, where are the parents? My children of 8 and 9 are often by <br/>
my side. I would never consider a younger child to be off and alone. If I had <br/>
a child functioning lower than the normal, I would make sure that I was <br/>
around. My older children are above average in IQ, and that cause problems. I <br/>
make sure that until they know the extent of their doings, they are not alone!<br/>
    I do see your point, though. If a child can do better with some type of <br/>
severe rehabilitation, then yes, it is worth the effort to work with the <br/>
child, and not pay for life on him. BUT, what if we rehab the child, set him <br/>
out into public, only for him to strike out again? Where are we now? We just <br/>
invested hundreds of thousands into this child who is again looking at a <br/>
judge and fearing a life term? Now what have we done? Are we to blame if the <br/>
rehab does not work? <br/>
    With my nephew, he thinks that he can roll in sh**, and still small like <br/>
roses. He gets the court to see his background, have pity on him, and <br/>
basically let him go...<br/>
(BTW Jermaine is biracial, black and white. Mother is always in trouble with <br/>
the law for both drugs and stealing. Lived with many other members of family <br/>
and foster care. Father is in Federal Prison, I have no idea what for... See <br/>
how hard his life is? Sob, sob... NOT My grandmother lets him get away with <br/>
everything, even stealing her car) His life is not all candy and cakes, but <br/>
you make what you want out of your life... He is making nothing. <br/>
    I still feel that if you commit the crime, you do the time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071008023">Having worked with the prison population, I can vouch for the &quot;fact!&quot; that<br/>
most of the molestation and abuse &quot;explanation&quot; are a crock.  I have been<br/>
there when shrinks, social workers, lawyers and pastors have made speeches<br/>
similar to:  &quot;I can&#39;t tell you what to say but . . . I had a client that<br/>
(fill in the blank with your abuse of choice and then go into great detail<br/>
of the hows, whys, wheres, etc. of the supposed abuse took place) and after<br/>
that was explained to the court/parole board, we got a new trial/shortened<br/>
sentence/early parole.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, my one rule to working with the client population I had was the truth<br/>
so that I would know where to place them and what after services to set up.<br/>
 My experience in the gladiator schools was that over 90% (yes, NINETY %)<br/>
were not abused or molested!  My experience also shows that recitification<br/>
is the norm even with rehab services!  And, I count recitification as<br/>
repeat criminals whether or not they get caught and the hard facts are that<br/>
the majority do repeat but simply don&#39;t get caught.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to IQ, are we suppose to make an exception because of IQ?  O.K.<br/>
son, your IQ is low so we will turn you loose so you can do it again.  Been<br/>
there, seen that.  Young man with the IQ of a 9 yo was molesting little (4,<br/>
5, 6 yo) girls.  The IQ excuse was used, he did &quot;rehab&quot; for 5 years and was<br/>
turned loose.  Repeat, did 7 years in &quot;rehab&quot; psych unit and was turned<br/>
loose.  Repeat.  Only this time he didn&#39;t get to do his &quot;rehab,&quot; the father<br/>
of one of the little girls shot and killed him and is now doing time.<br/>
<br/>
And, now as to my favorite.  And, again, I have extensive experience with<br/>
the shrink excuses having worked at an acute psych rehab unit for years,<br/>
please tell me exactly how you can determine if a person had a psychotic<br/>
episode at the time the crime was committed???  Because they tell you they<br/>
did???  Paaleeezzzz, like they aren&#39;t going to lie to get out of doing the<br/>
time!  And, again, we just turn them loose so they can have another<br/>
supposed psychotic episode and repeat the crime???<br/>
<br/>
The numbers tell the true story, with the increase in the number of shrinks<br/>
and social workers you have a following increase in the number of violent<br/>
crimes.  This is not a case of find a need and fill it, it is a case of<br/>
create a need and fill it!  Pre-Freud and his let&#39;s use folks as drug<br/>
guinea pigs, the per capita rate of violence among youthful offenders was<br/>
extremely low as were the number of mass murderers and serial killers and<br/>
teen suicides.  The operative words here being &quot;per capita.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Turning folks loose and telling them to take their meds does not work<br/>
because it is against the law to &quot;force&quot; them to take their meds.  The ACLU<br/>
has had a hayday with that one in several cases, one of which they have<br/>
taken all the way to the Supreme Court.<br/>
<br/>
But, all these arguments re: youth vs. adult are moot, there are already<br/>
laws in place that cover those exact same &quot;excuses&quot; in adults, soooo what<br/>
is the diff???  The only difference should be where they are placed, not<br/>
what you get for the crimes.<br/>
<br/>
Age, mental capacity and psych problems of the perp don&#39;t make the victim<br/>
any less dead or raped or molested.  Somehow, we have gotten away from<br/>
looking at the victim as just that, the victim and looking at the perp as<br/>
some kind of victim.  My 7 yo can understand that if you aim a gun at<br/>
someone and pull the trigger, you will kill that person.  So, maybe what we<br/>
ought to do is actually have a jury of peers (really peers) for all folks<br/>
tried!  I think you might find that a jury of actual peers might have some<br/>
real surprises in store for kids who think they have a free age related<br/>
pass!<br/>

 We had a very close knit group of young people because we were homeless<br/>
and we looked out for each other and took care of each other.  She was<br/>
attacked by strangers in the park, and she was 13 years old.  Nothing much<br/>
ever happened to the guys, even though she knew their faces and saw them<br/>
around and could identify them, because she did not have an adult to speak<br/>
for her and nobody much cared about the street kids.  Anyway she could not<br/>
admit to being a victim and take time to grieve and heal, as there was<br/>
nobody to shelter her while she did that.  She had to harden herself and<br/>
get on with survival.  We could cry together, but there was only so much we<br/>
could do for her when we were worried about where we were going to sleep<br/>
that night or where our next meal was coming from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165621155">In my opinion continued confusion.  These kids are detached and unparented.  They<br/>
are raised in a society that hates children and views them as chattel at best and<br/>
nuisances most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
They are peer identified and are defended against feeling.  They did not do it to<br/>
themselves.  They are victims.  Those who are victims often victimize others.  The<br/>
answers are not in further punishment.<br/>
<br/>
You describe a nephew who received punishment which was ineffective.  Sending<br/>
people to crime school is an ineffective response.  They will get out even less<br/>
attached more hardened, more violent, and skilled in criminal behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
Focusing on effects instead of causes is a waste.<br/>

&gt;     I would have to agree with Lynda. My nephew was a gang member. He robbed<br/>
&gt; pizza drivers at night with a small caliber hand gun. I think that he should<br/>
&gt; have been charged as an adult. At the age of 15, he knew just what he was<br/>
&gt; doing, and he knew the consequences. For all the money he stole, people he<br/>
&gt; scared, and time he wasted, he received 90 days in a boot camp, 30 days in a<br/>
&gt; halfway house, and 1 year probation. Mind you, he was on probation when he<br/>
&gt; went and robbed 10+ pizza drivers. They dropped that probation for the new<br/>
&gt; charges!?!?!<br/>
&gt;     Then there is the matter of the little school house killers, and I do not<br/>
&gt; mean Columbine....These children live under 4 miles from my home. 4 boys<br/>
&gt; plotted, listed, and obtained weapons to kill other children during a pep<br/>
&gt; rally that would be held in the gym. They had a list of over 70 children,<br/>
&gt; wrote each child&#39;s full name and where the child would sit... They also<br/>
&gt; listed where they would place bombs, so that in a panic, no one could get<br/>
&gt; away... Their trial started yesterday. 1 child was let go (he is testifying<br/>
&gt; against the others) These 3 boys, 14, 14, and 13, are looking at life in<br/>
&gt; prison. The mayor thinks that it is too harsh, for they ONLY planned it. It<br/>
&gt; did not happen... Can you imagine if it did? this tragedy would be bigger<br/>
&gt; than Columbine, and all the added problems that follow. This was not even a<br/>
&gt; highschool, it was a middle school. Just in the aftermath of this event, Port<br/>
&gt; Huron had numerous bomb threats, fights, and large scale violence. The county<br/>
&gt; building closed due to a threat.<br/>
&gt;     It is now policy for children, who even mention dismemberment of another<br/>
&gt; child, to be suspended from school for no less than 1 day. My 7 yo, ADD son<br/>
&gt; went to school after spending the morning playing Playstation, and told a<br/>
&gt; little girl that he was going to shoot her, splatter blood all aver the wall.<br/>
&gt; SUSPENDED! I think he deserved it. This child is a victim of joint custody,<br/>
&gt; and his Dad is not the best role model... He is against me homeschooling.<br/>
&gt;     Back to the point. If television is going to show the world decline and<br/>
&gt; mark the consequences, then children know the before AND after of every<br/>
&gt; wrongdoing. They know in real life that every action has a reaction, and<br/>
&gt; every choice has a consequence. They choose to violate the law, they should<br/>
&gt; be willing to suffer the penalty. I am raising my children as such.<br/>

I&#39;m not saying that kids should not be held accountable or that they need<br/>
pity. I actually think expecting kids to be responsible and *not* feeling<br/>
sorry for them is much more loving. My concern is with locking up children<br/>
for several years, providing little or no rehabilitation, and then being<br/>
suprised when they commit more crimes upon their release.<br/>
<br/>
I agree there are some juveniles who do not respond to rehabilitation. But<br/>
it is often very difficult to identify those children after just one or two<br/>
offenses. The majority of adolescents who commit crimes do not go on to<br/>
commit crimes as adults. In fact, *most* adolescent boys have committed a<br/>
crime (not just a status offense) but they grow up to law-abiding adults.<br/>
<br/>
I think we need to keep asking ourselves, what is the purpose of the<br/>
criminal justice system? Is it to decrease crime through deterrence? Punish<br/>
for the sake of retribution? Protect the community? Make citizens feel safer<br/>
even if they&#39;re not? I believe in locking up career criminals for as long as<br/>
possible because they commit most of the crimes. Locking them up protects<br/>
the community. Some career criminals can be identified as adolescents (but<br/>
not many) so I&#39;d include such adolescents in this category of &quot;lock &#39;em up<br/>
to protect society.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Incarceration does deter most citizens without an adult criminal history<br/>
from committing felonies. But deternence only deters a minority of persons<br/>
with a criminal history. In general, deterrence is much overrated by the<br/>
general public because we want to believe that it works for others because<br/>
it works for us. And gosh darn it if it doesn&#39;t work for them, lock &#39;em up<br/>
anyway for their bad attitude!<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe in retribution. If one of our children hits the other<br/>
without provocation, we don&#39;t encourage the recipient of the blow to seek<br/>
retribution from his or her sibling (self-defense, yes, retribution, no).<br/>
Are they held accountable? Of course. (I&#39;m talking about serious<br/>
infractions, not typical sibling rivalry that is best dealt with in other<br/>
ways). And, as Joel has discussed at the societal level, we try to encourage<br/>
our children to understand the effect of their action and allow them to feel<br/>
shame (note I&#39;m not saying &quot;shame them&quot; but &quot;allow them to feel shame&quot;). If<br/>
that&#39;s how we deal with children, why not with adults? (I&#39;m assuming others<br/>
don&#39;t encourage their children to seek retribution--is that accurate?).<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not saying some criminals shouldn&#39;t be incarcerated. If the<br/>
incarceration protects us, I&#39;m all for it.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than focusing on incarceration, we could lower the crime rate more<br/>
effectively if we locked up fewer drug addicts, for example, and provide<br/>
them with treatment that&#39;s always available (it also saves us at least $5<br/>
for every $1 we spend on treatment). Or we could, as the International<br/>
Chiefs of Police recently recommended, establish more afterschool programs<br/>
for youth (the Chiefs supported this plan over hiring more police<br/>
officers!).<br/>

&gt;     If a child with a low IQ, who mentally is functioning at half his<br/>
(her)<br/>
&gt; age, does a crime, where are the parents? My children of 8 and 9 are often<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; my side. I would never consider a younger child to be off and alone. If I<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; a child functioning lower than the normal, I would make sure that I was<br/>
&gt; around. My older children are above average in IQ, and that cause<br/>
problems. I<br/>
&gt; make sure that until they know the extent of their doings, they are not<br/>
alone!<br/>
&gt;     I do see your point, though. If a child can do better with some type<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; severe rehabilitation, then yes, it is worth the effort to work with the<br/>
&gt; child, and not pay for life on him. BUT, what if we rehab the child, set<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; out into public, only for him to strike out again? Where are we now? We<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; invested hundreds of thousands into this child who is again looking at a<br/>
&gt; judge and fearing a life term? Now what have we done? Are we to blame if<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; rehab does not work?<br/>
&gt;     With my nephew, he thinks that he can roll in sh**, and still small<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; roses. He gets the court to see his background, have pity on him, and<br/>
&gt; basically let him go...<br/>
&gt; (BTW Jermaine is biracial, black and white. Mother is always in trouble<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; the law for both drugs and stealing. Lived with many other members of<br/>

See<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066433182">I am agreement with what Mark writes with a few provisos.  I too, believe there<br/>
are people from whom we need to be protected.  These people should be kept in<br/>
comfortable, safe, humane circumstances because that is the kind of people we<br/>
are not because of who they are.  They are not there to be punished because<br/>
punishment does not elicit good behaviour and diminishes the punisher.<br/>
<br/>
Most people do not refrain from committing crimes because of the fear of<br/>
retribution or doing jail time.  Most people refrain from doing these things<br/>
from a complex or matrix of many things of which fear of retribution may play a<br/>
small part.  Most criminals do not fear retribution because most criminals have<br/>
gotten away with their crimes.  They are most often not charged.  Even if they<br/>
have been punished before they do not believe they will be caught this time.<br/>
<br/>
Restraint from impulses comes from an investment in the values of your community<br/>
and family.  Restraint from outside forces is a very poor substitute for that<br/>
internal restraint.  Cultivating that interior restraint is the challenge.  It<br/>
is a long process best accomplished by having attached children in the context<br/>
of home and community.<br/>

<h4>Joel Hawthorne</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905279425">Women victims often have very different responses to abuse often taking it out on<br/>
themselves in destructive ways.  Of course there are people who are offended<br/>
against who never offend against anyone else.  Why that is the case is informative<br/>
and useful in preventing those who have been offended against becoming offenders.<br/>
<br/>
I have thought that your perspective was a Christian one. I can only suggest that<br/>
you check out<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.forgiveness-institute.org/">http://www.forgiveness-institute.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Taken from that site the following:<br/>
<br/>
1.    What it is:<br/>
<br/>
         Moral<br/>
         It is a response to an injustice (a moral wrong).<br/>
         It is a turning to the &quot;good&quot; in the face of this wrongdoing.<br/>
         Goodwill<br/>
         Merciful restraint from pursuing resentment or revenge.<br/>
         Generosity or offering good things such as: attention, time, remembrances<br/>
on<br/>
         holidays.<br/>
         Moral Love or contributing to the betterment of the other.<br/>
         Paradoxical<br/>
         It is the foregoing of resentment or revenge when the wrongdoer&#39;s actions<br/>
deserve<br/>
         it and giving the gifts of mercy, generosity and love when the wrongdoer<br/>
does not<br/>
         deserve them.<br/>
         As we give the gift of forgiveness we ourselves are healed.<br/>
         Beyond duty<br/>
         A freely chosen gift (rather than a grim obligation).<br/>
         The overcoming of wrongdoing with good.<br/>
<br/>
    2. What it is not:<br/>
<br/>
         Forgetting/Denial<br/>
         Time passing/ignoring the effects of the wrongdoing.<br/>
         Condoning<br/>
         Nothing that bad happened. It was only this one time. It won&#39;t happen<br/>
again.<br/>
         Excusing<br/>
         The person did this because.....it wasn&#39;t really their responsibility.<br/>
         Condemning<br/>
         She/he deserves to know they have wronged me.<br/>
         &quot;Forgiving&quot; with a sense of moral superiority.<br/>
         Seeking Justice or Compensation<br/>
         Forgiveness is not a quid pro quo deal--it doesn&#39;t demand compensation<br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
    3. Important Distinction:<br/>
<br/>
         Forgiveness:     One person&#39;s moral response to another&#39;s injustice<br/>
         Reconciliation:  Two parties coming together in mutual respect<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not saying that kids should not be held accountable or that they need<br/>
&gt; pity. I actually think expecting kids to be responsible and *not* feeling<br/>
&gt; sorry for them is much more loving. My concern is with locking up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>children<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for several years, providing little or no rehabilitation, and then being<br/>
&gt; suprised when they commit more crimes upon their release.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree there are some juveniles who do not respond to rehabilitation.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it is often very difficult to identify those children after just one or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>two<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; offenses. The majority of adolescents who commit crimes do not go on to<br/>
&gt; commit crimes as adults. In fact, *most* adolescent boys have committed a<br/>
&gt; crime (not just a status offense) but they grow up to law-abiding adults.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we need to keep asking ourselves, what is the purpose of the<br/>
&gt; criminal justice system? Is it to decrease crime through deterrence?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Punish<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for the sake of retribution? Protect the community? Make citizens feel<br/>
 </span></blockquote>safer<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; even if they&#39;re not? I believe in locking up career criminals for as long<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; possible because they commit most of the crimes. Locking them up protects<br/>
&gt; the community. Some career criminals can be identified as adolescents<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not many) so I&#39;d include such adolescents in this category of &quot;lock &#39;em<br/>
 </span></blockquote>up<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to protect society.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Incarceration does deter most citizens without an adult criminal history<br/>
&gt; from committing felonies. But deternence only deters a minority of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>persons<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with a criminal history. In general, deterrence is much overrated by the<br/>
&gt; general public because we want to believe that it works for others<br/>
 </span></blockquote>because<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it works for us. And gosh darn it if it doesn&#39;t work for them, lock &#39;em<br/>
 </span></blockquote>up<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; anyway for their bad attitude!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do not believe in retribution. If one of our children hits the other<br/>
&gt; without provocation, we don&#39;t encourage the recipient of the blow to seek<br/>
&gt; retribution from his or her sibling (self-defense, yes, retribution, no).<br/>
&gt; Are they held accountable? Of course. (I&#39;m talking about serious<br/>
&gt; infractions, not typical sibling rivalry that is best dealt with in other<br/>
&gt; ways). And, as Joel has discussed at the societal level, we try to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>encourage<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; our children to understand the effect of their action and allow them to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feel<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shame (note I&#39;m not saying &quot;shame them&quot; but &quot;allow them to feel shame&quot;).<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that&#39;s how we deal with children, why not with adults? (I&#39;m assuming<br/>
 </span></blockquote>others<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; don&#39;t encourage their children to seek retribution--is that accurate?).<br/>
&gt; Again, I&#39;m not saying some criminals shouldn&#39;t be incarcerated. If the<br/>
&gt; incarceration protects us, I&#39;m all for it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rather than focusing on incarceration, we could lower the crime rate more<br/>
&gt; effectively if we locked up fewer drug addicts, for example, and provide<br/>
&gt; them with treatment that&#39;s always available (it also saves us at least $5<br/>
&gt; for every $1 we spend on treatment). Or we could, as the International<br/>
&gt; Chiefs of Police recently recommended, establish more afterschool<br/>
 </span></blockquote>programs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for youth (the Chiefs supported this plan over hiring more police<br/>
&gt; officers!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for your civil response about an emotional issue.<br/>

    So true!  It is our responsibility to do what we can to culivate that in <br/>
our own children and in any other children we have the opportunity to.  This <br/>
is one of our most important jobs as parents and as people living in society. <br/>
 This is why I have finally gotten away from the use of penalties and rewards <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095423569">This is another one of those &quot;I hardly know where to begin&quot; sort of posts.  I<br/>
don&#39;t want to spend very much time doing it so I will try to cut to the chase.<br/>
<br/>
 People&#39;s belief systems shape the way in which they view &quot;evidence&quot;.  It is<br/>
clear to me that preconception and a refusal to even entertain the notion that<br/>
perpetrators could have been victimized will color your perceptions.  Of course<br/>
with the current criminal Injustice system, lawyers will coach clients to<br/>
exaggerate, fabricate and such like to avoid punishment.  This does not do away<br/>
with the fact that most people who have been abused don&#39;t have an actual<br/>
understanding of what was done to them.<br/>
<br/>
I have had patients for years now who repeatedly describe horrendous stories in<br/>
neutral tones.  They are not trying to impress me with anything.  They think<br/>
they may have had some rough times but mostly they think they got what they<br/>
deserved.  I wish I would get paid for the number of times I have been told<br/>
basically &quot;Well yeah my dad (or fill in the blank) beat the s**t out of me but<br/>
I was really a troublemaker when I was a kid.&quot;  The majority of these folks<br/>
don&#39;t think corporal punishment is a bad thing..<br/>
<br/>
Your analysis of the origins of deviance seems to be missing.  Are these<br/>
offenders just bad, self-indulgent malingerers who enjoy hurting people?  They<br/>
don&#39;t need approval?  They have good self-esteem and social skills?<br/>
<br/>
What is your explanation for offending behaviours? What is recitification?  Are<br/>
you referring to recidivism?  Obviously punishment does not deter crime.  The<br/>
US has more people locked up and under the criminal justice system than just<br/>
about any other country and yet has more crime than just about any other<br/>
industrialized country.  So what is the problem?<br/>
<br/>
How do you explain the correlation between social class and incarceration?  Are<br/>
poor people just &quot;bad&quot; people who &quot;naturally&quot; offend?  Is it a matter of<br/>
&quot;character&quot;? Some people are just born with bad character?  Can people change?<br/>
How?  Does parenting have anything to do with how children behave?  If it does<br/>
then how much responsibility do parents have for the crimes of their children<br/>
if any?<br/>
<br/>
You seem to support the idea of child-like justice.  The harsh views of<br/>
children should not be our model for justice.<br/>
<br/>
Again there are studies which are not just self-reporting surveys.  There are<br/>
other ways of knowing whether or not someone has been hospitalized for having<br/>
been beaten by a parent than asking them.<br/>
<br/>
Your anger, disgust, objectification and loathing of offenders comes through<br/>
clearly.  I think it clouds your thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I share your rage at people who hurt other people.  I have enormous empathy<br/>
with people victimized by others.  I have worked with offenders and victims. My<br/>
experience is that they are both fundamentally human, capable of change, and<br/>
plagued by the same problems as all of humanity.  I believe there are a very<br/>
few individuals completely broken who are dangerous to everyone around them who<br/>
must be kept from harming people because they will harm people regardless of<br/>
their stated intentions.  These are exceptions.  There are no more of these now<br/>
than in any other time in history.<br/>
<br/>
Finally your crime statistics leave a lot to be desired. We are emerging from a<br/>
history wherein slavery, murder and stealing were basic facts.  Criminal<br/>
behaviour in many instances was socially sanctioned.  You look to days of yore<br/>
where we were happy and there wasn&#39;t much crime. Depends on who you were.<br/>
Racial and ethnic minorities, women and children?  I don&#39;t think so.  You seem<br/>
to ingest the social prejudices of our society and you don&#39;t seem to have<br/>
digested them.<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t seem to be brief.<br/>
<br/>
Please provide answers to the questions I have asked so we might continue the<br/>
discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658831541">The criminal justice system that we have does not work because it can be<br/>
bought!  Mandatory sentencing and no plea bargaining with expensive lawyers<br/>
is the answer.  Any criminal on the street will tell you they do not<br/>
respect the system because they KNOW they can manipulate the system.  And,<br/>
of course, we have more &quot;poor&quot; folk in prison, there are more poor than<br/>
there are rich therefore the percentages would be in that direction even if<br/>
we didn&#39;t have a legal system that was for sale.<br/>
<br/>
And, it is nice that you have beliefs such as that everyone is capable of<br/>
being fixed.  The problem is that is not reality.  Reality is that not only<br/>
can&#39;t a large percentage be &quot;fixed,&quot; an even greater percentage don&#39;t think<br/>
they need to be fixed and, in fact, think the rest of the world needs some<br/>
fixing.<br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;preconception&quot; or &quot;refusal to even entertain the notion.&quot;  I<br/>
wore rosey tinted glasses and spouted psycho-babble about treating people<br/>
with caring so that one would get caring back.  That is why I gave 40 hours<br/>
or more a week of my time to &quot;help&quot; those poor, abused people who had never<br/>
had a chance.  I was going to make a difference because I cared in an<br/>
uncaring world full of people taking advantage of the poor and minorities. <br/>
Hah!!!  I didn&#39;t take off my rosey-tinted glasses, they were knocked off<br/>
and smashed!!<br/>
<br/>
Those who spout off about the system should first go to the gladiator<br/>
schools and learn first hand about the reality instead of reading books.<br/>
<br/>
And, I don&#39;t need to sit around and do justification or explanations.  I<br/>
know what causes some behaviors and those can be worked on.  I also know<br/>
that there are people who are warped and they are born that way.  No amount<br/>
of talking it to death is going to change the facts or the reality.  No<br/>
making nicey nice or pretending is going to change them.  You may change 1<br/>
out of 10 if you are lucky, very lucky but that does not excuse the other 9<br/>
being out on the street to terrorize the general population, many of whom<br/>
have had the exact same experiences but don&#39;t use them as an excuse for<br/>
unacceptable behaviors.  The term &quot;bad apple&quot; is a reality.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can explain why 10 children can have the exact same upbringing<br/>
and only 1 will go &quot;bad.&quot;  When you can do that, then we can fix the<br/>
problem.  No one has been able to explain it and that is why they fall back<br/>
on the same tired old lines of &quot;poor,&quot; &quot;corporal punishment,&quot; &quot;abuse,&quot;<br/>
&quot;molestation,&quot; &quot;racism,&quot; etc. etc. etc, blah, blah, blah.  Even in studies<br/>
done of multiple births, in over 90% of the cases, all are not &quot;bad.&quot; <br/>
Heaven forbid that we should have to admit that there is such a thing as a<br/>
&quot;bad seed&quot; and simply go on from there.  The U.S. is the most excuse driven<br/>
society there is, and that probably has more to do with the numbers than<br/>
anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as a little aside, we are not emerging in the U.S. from anything. <br/>
This country was founded by violent offenders just like Australia and the<br/>
violence, government sanctioned, continues TODAY.  Genocide and racism is<br/>
alive and well in the U.S.  But, none of this changes the basic facts. <br/>
Although all might have human qualities, not all are humane!<br/>

don&#39;t have quite the same set up as the older prisons do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913091061">While I unschool (which goes back to the 60&#39;s), I don&#39;t find ps to be quite<br/>
the boogeyman/whipping boy that most hsers use it as.  Everyone has free<br/>
will or those who went to ps wouldn&#39;t be able to become hsers.  You simply<br/>
can&#39;t have it both ways.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was never spanked, let alone beat yet she found it necessary to<br/>
use wooden men&#39;s suit hangers on us girls.  My children are not spanked,<br/>
let alone beat.  Free will, individual&#39;s making choices.<br/>
<br/>
It is a proven fact that alcoholics can only be &quot;fixed&quot; if they choose to<br/>
be fixed.  They must acknowledge that they have a problem but, they will<br/>
always be just one drink away from being an alcoholic.  They are never<br/>
&quot;cured.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think society is too ready to look for an excuse, a blame--spanking did<br/>
it, ps did it, Twinkies did it.  Sorry, I&#39;m not buying it or everyone who<br/>
was spanked, who went to ps or who ate Twinkies would be a violent<br/>
criminal.  These folks are individuals who have made a choice.  Not the<br/>
choice you or I have made.  They are a very small % of the population and a<br/>
very small % of the identified by shrinks population as being prime for<br/>
violence.  Therefore, it is choose.<br/>
<br/>
Honest criminals (now there&#39;s an oxymoron) will tell you that they don&#39;t<br/>
want to change.  Most of them that do &quot;groups&quot; in prison do it to get their<br/>
sentence reduced, not to be &quot;cured&quot; because they don&#39;t honestly think they<br/>
have a problem.  They are great blamers.<br/>
<br/>
Why do I unschool?  Because I am a rebel that believes she can do a better<br/>
job than the schools, hates dealing with stoooopid people (those who can&#39;t<br/>
think outside the box) and will probably raise little rebels &lt;g&gt;  This has<br/>
absolutely nothing to do with thinking &quot;bad&quot; people can&#39;t be fixed.  One<br/>
has absolutely nothing to do with the other.  If I thought ps was the<br/>
culprit, I might have removed the kidlets for that reason.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
ps is the culprit.  It may add to the problem, but I don&#39;t think it has<br/>
created the problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613500653">Lynda, you are talking too fast.  I am still working on my last response to<br/>
your other posts....lol.  I mention in that response that I find myself in<br/>
considerable agreement with much of your view however we do part company on<br/>
some issues.<br/>
<br/>
I find your thinking &quot;inside the box&quot; on issues of justice, behaviour, crime<br/>
and punishment.  I think your views are shared by most people. But it could be<br/>
me in my own box.<br/>
<br/>
There is a great little, short book called &quot;How People Change&quot; by Alan<br/>
Wheelis.  It is a great discussion of the dynamics between personal<br/>
responsibility and &quot;blame&quot;.  People are responsible for their actions.  There<br/>
certainly is such a thing as &quot;diminished capacity&quot;.  When I drank, I did things<br/>
that I wouldn&#39;t have done sober.  I still chose to drink and so if my judgment<br/>
was impaired I had certainly chosen to diminish it by drinking.   I also did<br/>
things stone cold sober that I wish I hadn&#39;t done.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you would read Alice Miller and let me know what you think.<br/>
<br/>
I am really convinced that there is a major internal &quot;psychological&quot; barrier to<br/>
looking at these issues dispassionately which Alice Miller expands upon.  It<br/>
has to with &quot;childish&quot; investment in parental approval.<br/>
<br/>
Your description of your mother&#39;s behaviour (from my point of view) is one of<br/>
abuse ...clear but of course not simple.<br/>
<br/>
Yes people make choices.  People&#39;s choices are shaped by their previous<br/>
experience.  It is very difficult to make choices about which you have limited<br/>
or no experience. People struggle within the limitations of their experience.<br/>
Effective &quot;therapy&quot; is in fact a little world of alternate experience which<br/>
allows people to have experiences that they would never &quot;choose&quot; because those<br/>
experiences are outside their &quot;box&quot; of choices.<br/>
<br/>
I was adopted at five and remember much of my earlier childhood.  For me the<br/>
experience was a kind of inoculation against taking anything at face value.  It<br/>
made me suspicious, anxious perhaps even paranoid.  These qualities are two<br/>
edged swords.  I am perceptive in a way I wouldn&#39;t have been and yet limited in<br/>
personal relationships, in ways which are a constant struggle.<br/>
<br/>
I clearly see the connection between my &quot;then&quot; and my &quot;now&quot;.  I see the<br/>
challenge of change.  It is constant struggle, one which I would often rather<br/>
not have.  I am painfully aware that choice is mine.<br/>
<br/>
The question of why people with similar experiences make different choices is<br/>
of course central to this discussion.  I believe that people who make<br/>
constructive choices in spite of their painful experiences have had (to borrow<br/>
from Alice Miller) &quot;witnesses&quot; to what was done to them.  People who choose<br/>
&quot;destructive&quot; roads have not had &quot;witnesses&quot;.  this is at least one piece of<br/>
the puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
I am really glad that (thus far) this discussion (this time) has not resulted<br/>
in anyone going off in a snit.  I find that this conversation gets people<br/>
really excited and often &quot;mad as hell&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your opinions I am refining my thinking as a result.  It is much<br/>
appreciated.<br/>

more indepth discussions.  Some of us have unschooled for a long time and we<br/>
need to analyze where we&#39;ve been and where we&#39;re going.  The face of<br/>
homeschooling has changed more than once in the last 20 years and the next 5<br/>
are going to see it change yet again.  Frankly, we now have some very clear<br/>
insights that the rest of the culture should take a long hard look<br/>
at......is they&#39;ll sit still long enough.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; Perhaps you can explain why 10 children can have the exact same upbringing<br/>
 and only 1 will go &quot;bad.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    How could 10 children have the exact same upbringing?  There are <br/>
differences in every person&#39;s life and these differences can have important <br/>
effects, negative or postive.  I don&#39;t know if there truly are &quot;bad seeds&quot; <br/>
but if there are, they have to account for a very small percentage of people <br/>
in U.S. prisons.  If some people are actually &quot;born bad,&quot; then the percentage <br/>
of those people would be the same world wide and we would have about the same <br/>
percentage of our people in prison as the Netherlands does or Switzerland <br/>
does, for example.  Yet we all know that the U.S. has a far higher percentage <br/>
of its people in prison than those countries do, as well as a lot more <br/>
violence and a lot more poverty.  I think common sense tells us that poverty <br/>
can breed resentment and a lack of faith in the system, which can in turn <br/>
contribute to a person giving up and getting involved in various criminal <br/>
activities.  <br/>
     You obviously have some first hand experiences which have shaped your <br/>
feelings about this.  I understand how you can feel like it&#39;s easy for others <br/>
to give opinions when they don&#39;t deal with prisoners on a regular basis.  <br/>
However, there are others who also have first hand experience with people who <br/>
have gone to prison or been involved in criminal activity and our <br/>
observations are at least just as valid as yours.  Both sides may be somewhat <br/>
colored by emotion, of course.  <br/>
     I have seen people I&#39;ve known since they were children lose faith in our <br/>
justice system.  I&#39;ve seen schools and courts who are quick to throw <br/>
teenagers away for minor things that they don&#39;t throw other teens away for.  <br/>
And I&#39;ve seen how violent cultures affect kids.  I&#39;ve lived in Europe and <br/>
seen a big difference.  It has been proven by results that a humane way of <br/>
treating all people in a country helps the people in that country to, in <br/>
turn, be more humane toward one another.  <br/>
    From an individual standpoint, I believe it helps a person to hold <br/>
him/her responsible for his/her behavior.  It doesn&#39;t do a person a lot of <br/>
good to feed him a list of excuses for why he can&#39;t do the right thing.  <br/>
However, from a wider, sociological perspective, we had BETTER look for the <br/>
contributing factors to the violence in this society or we have little hope <br/>
of improving things.  You yourself obviously DO feel that there are <br/>
contributing factors and not just &quot;bad seeds&quot; because you point to our <br/>
judicial system yourself in saying that the criminals aren&#39;t afraid.  So we <br/>
do agree that a society can function in a way that tends to bring out better <br/>
in its people or worse.  We just disagree on what some of the contributing <br/>
factors are.  Yet I believe that you probably do feel that the way a person <br/>
is raised does make a tremendous difference.  You&#39;ve chosen to homeschool <br/>
your child/children, so you must feel that it will make a difference for them.<br/>
    What a person&#39;s upbringing is on paper or in brief description doesn&#39;t <br/>
even come close to knowing what it really was.  We can say one person is <br/>
Hispanic, raised in East L.A. by a single mom on welfare and so was another <br/>
and they are both the same age.  Maybe they lived in the same apartments.  <br/>
Does that even begin to take in what their individual experiences were, what <br/>
people they had in their lives, how they were treated, what good or horrible <br/>
things happened to them, etc.?  Surely we all know that a person&#39;s <br/>
experiences have a major impact on what kind of person they become.  <br/>
