<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428717436">I had a transaction with her where I bought several children&#39;s <br/>
magazines and paid her $20 paypal.  I never recieved the magazines, I <br/>
sent her 6 or 8 emails with no response, I then put in a complaint <br/>
with paypal and they found her to be at fault and recovered a whole <br/>
$.72 for me!!  Buyer beware...DO NOT deal with her.  <br/>
