<div id="ygrps-yiv-872061663">I&#39;ve heard:<br/>
<br/>
Life Learning<br/>
Organic Learning<br/>
Delight-driven learning<br/>
Whole Life Learning<br/>
<br/>
What else is there?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be honest- I don&#39;t like the term unschooling and especially <br/>
radical unschooling.  I use them, for lack of anything better.  <br/>
Unschooling sounds like it&#39;s all about what we *don&#39;t* do, which is <br/>
exactly what everyone thinks- that we *don&#39;t do.* I&#39;d like to find <br/>
something more positive that speaks to what we *do.* Radical is <br/>
loaded.  Obviously, in this society, what we are doing is radical.  <br/>
It&#39;s way off the beaten path.  But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really that <br/>
radical in the context of the whole world and other cultures.  It <br/>
feels quite natural, and it&#39;s not because people were suddenly <br/>
enlightened in the 1980&#39;s.  It&#39;s because a small part of our culture <br/>
recently rediscovered some ancient truths about human learning that <br/>
other cultures have known this whole time.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem I&#39;m having in my search for a new term is that the other <br/>
terms I listed seem to have more of a relaxed homeschooler <br/>
connotation than a radical unschooler connotation.  So, no <br/>
curriculum, but still chores kind of thinking behind them.</div>

Have you heard someone call unschooling this, or are we brainstorming  <br/>
now?<br/>
<br/>
The objection to unschooling comes up within most unschoolers, and  <br/>
although you can certainly call it anything you want to, the term  <br/>
won&#39;t go away.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things that might make you feel better about  <br/>
it.  One is the background on the origin of the term:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/theterm">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/theterm</a><br/>
<br/>
The other is something Suzanne Carter wrote on AOL&#39;s unschooling  <br/>
forum years ago:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lots of people make this point, but I never see the negation as  <br/>
negative in a value-judgment sense when I use the word--to me  <br/>
unschooling is as positive as unchaining, unbinding, unleashing,  <br/>
unfolding, unfurling, unlimiting....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All mean freedom and growth and vast possibilities to me.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m not necessarily brainstorming.  Not intentionally.  Nevermind.  Not a<br/>
good example.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I put it is I have read posts saying they don&#39;t talk about<br/>
unschooling but just living life or being with their kids.  &quot;Now&quot; refers to<br/>
the common often spoken theme of being with your kids &quot;right now&quot; as opposed<br/>
to setting up to operate on automatic.<br/>

<br/>
But you read the posts on unschooling lists, or homeschooling lists,  <br/>
right?  They didn&#39;t go to a just living life list.  If people don&#39;t  <br/>
use terminology, they can&#39;t talk about anything.  Without words, how  <br/>
can there be thoughts and ideas?<br/>
<br/>
There are people just living lives without joy or learning  <br/>
opportunities or good relationships between people.  There are maybe  <br/>
a badillion people (okay, millions) who just live life but have   <br/>
nothing to do with any sort of home education/school-option/kids- <br/>
learning connection in their lives at all.<br/>
<br/>
Is &quot;unschooling&quot; closer to learning without school or to just living  <br/>
life?  (Honest question, not rhetorical.)<br/>

<br/>
Losing the term unschooling would be like losing the backstory and the<br/>
juiciest parts of the idea, and for those who want to know or want to<br/>
preserve the knowledge, it makes sense to preserve the word.  I like it.  It<br/>
describes what it is fairly well in English.  The term autodidactic is<br/>
interesting.  It trips me up though when talking about a concept that is<br/>
usually unfamiliar or totally unknown to others.  Autodidactic and other<br/>
words like that might not trip anybody else up like it does me... :)<br/>
Unschooling has some of the same flavor yet it&#39;s simpler and I&#39;ve been using<br/>
it rather a long while now.  I do add more words to expound on it but first<br/>
the word introduces, encapsulates, and --for those who want to-- it<br/>
categorizes much of the idea.<br/>
<br/>
The UnCola commercial still does a lot to dispell hesitancy for calling what<br/>
I&#39;m doing an &quot;un&quot; sort of thing.  That ain&#39;t all bad.  :}  Un.<br/>

<br/>
Depends on one&#39;s goals and which person you ask and how that question hits a<br/>
person at a certain time of the day.<br/>
<br/>
As to an online list, I think the term unschooling is pretty much<br/>
indispensible.<br/>

Only slightly related:<br/>
 <br/>
I try to introduce myself and tell a bit about my family when  we have a new <br/>
member join our local *homeschool* group. Sometimes I do like to  answer &quot;how <br/>
do you guys deal with _?&quot; (math, handwriting, reading, etc.) kind of  <br/>
questions from a curriculum-free viewpoint. The other day we had someone  new joined <br/>
and I introduced myself and that we unschooled and a bit about my  family. The <br/>
next person to introduce themselves said, &quot;My name is B_... ...we  are not <br/>
unschoolers, I have a strict curriculum that I follow. &quot;. I thought  it was kind <br/>
of funny that unschooling was bandied about &quot;so often&quot; that she felt  she <br/>
needed a &quot;curriculum homeschooler&quot; qualifier. Kind of neat,  too.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if that makes the word unschooling more widely  understood, but <br/>
I think it is at least getting heard more.<br/>

I think unscholing is closer to &quot;living life,&quot; but there are a lot of <br/>
different ways to live life.  Unschoolers are living life with joy, <br/>
excitment, discovery, and learning.  Some people live life just passing <br/>
the days until they die.</div>

<br/>
Because of compulsory attendance laws, school is the default.  School  <br/>
IS &quot;the constant.&quot;  School is the measure.  We must do (in some ways,  <br/>
whichever ways a judge or social worker might look at it) as well as  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I know all the arguments (or have heard most of them; no doubt there  <br/>
are a few still to be sprung), so we don&#39;t need to talk about them  <br/>
here, and yada-yada, school shootings and sexual abuse and blah  <br/>
blah.  Yes.  Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Still, school is indeed a constant and the legal default.  Although  <br/>
it&#39;s a good tool to tell people in the newest deschooling phases to  <br/>
live as though school didn&#39;t exist, and it can be a helpful stepping  <br/>
stone, ultimately unschooling ONLY exists because of school.<br/>

don&#39;t think that is living life, really, it&#39;s a half life in reaction to<br/>
something terrible in their lives that they have no control over.<br/>

I&#39;ve met maybe 2 or 3 young men that went out and did the hobo thing for<br/>
the thrill of it, but they never intended to stay there or do it<br/>
forever.  There is a very very small segment of the homeless population<br/>
that try to live off the waste of others for ethical reasons.  I wonder<br/>
how long that lasts though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That little bit used to trip me up in the beginning stages of<br/>
unschooling.  Trying to live as if school didn&#39;t exist, and yet at the<br/>
same time living in such a way that was in a direct reaction to the very<br/>
existence of school!  Purely on the theoretical of course.<br/>
<br/>
In my daily life with my kids, I can really live as if school doesn&#39;t<br/>
exist.  Largely because we don&#39;t bring school or school related thought<br/>
into our dialy lives.<br/>
<br/>
However, we can&#39;t ignore the fact that we live a half block away from an<br/>
elementary school, 3 blocks away from the middle school, and 2 blocks<br/>
away from the high school.  Nor can we ignore the fact that getting out<br/>
of our house when one of those lets out for the day, is slow going and<br/>
flooded with kids and buses and cars.  And the big big one, is that all<br/>
the neighbor kids are gone and not available to play for a large segment<br/>
of the day.  Oh, and the fact that at least one of our neighbors thinks<br/>
homeschooling is bad because of &quot;socialization&quot; reasons, but the<br/>
neighbor that is a social worker likes us, so we&#39;re good. (we socialized<br/>
quite nicely with their cats when they went out of town!)</div>

 </span></blockquote>There is something to be said about colorful lifestyles for sure!  I was<br/>
thinking about one particular homeless guy that I used to talk to when<br/>
I&#39;d wait for my bus at midnight, in the middle of the city.  He was a<br/>
very very smart man, who had a lot of insight about lots of things.  He<br/>
was a Vietnam vet, who couldn&#39;t get past the fact that he had killed<br/>
innocent people, even under extraordinary circumstances.  He was haunted<br/>
daily by their faces, which he remembered in detail.  He honestly felt<br/>
that he didn&#39;t deserve to live in comfort and happiness because of<br/>
having killed people.  However, he did help form a homeless Vietnam vet<br/>
co-op of sorts.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the street kids that I&#39;ve met over the years, though, it was a<br/>
different story.  All the learning they did was for survival, not really<br/>
a hotbed of learning like the joyful happy kind that my own kids have. <br/>
Even though the school of hard knocks can create smart and observant<br/>
people, it&#39;s not really ideal.<br/>
<br/>
People who jump through the hoops and do what they are &quot;supposed&quot; to do,<br/>
really don&#39;t have a lot to talk about do they?  I had a hard time<br/>
connecting with those types of folks when I was in school myself, and<br/>
again when I taught dance classes and had to deal with parents like<br/>
that.</div>

<br/>
I have a 13 year old son who&#39;s self-educated. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I&#39;m a member of the Radical Unschoolers Network on<br/>
Ning (although not active at the moment). In fact, I will be<br/>
adding a badge to that effect to my website with my next update.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I don&#39;t refer to myself as a radical unschooler, I do seem<br/>
to fit the profile, more or less, so I&#39;m happy to identify myself with<br/>
the term as a useful shorthand or code word for connecting with like<br/>
minds. I think it&#39;s very useful for that.<br/>

misunderstanding to use natural learning. Then schools can become  <br/>
&quot;unnatural learning&quot; ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That would work for me. I already do use the term &#39;natural parenting&#39;<br/>
to describe parenting based on human needs rather than social<br/>
expectations and how children learn best would come into that. As I<br/>
think I&#39;ve mentioned before, removing my son from school was a<br/>
parenting decision not an educational one.<br/>
<br/>
Though, in any event, what Pat seemed to be learning most at school<br/>
was to wait to be taught, which is certainly unnatural, in my view. <br/>
