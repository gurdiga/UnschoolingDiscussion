 </span></blockquote>I know it seems like you&#39;re on trial but people are only trying to help you<br/>
see stuff in a different way. It&#39;s uncomfortable but if you stick it out and<br/>
take some time to think and reflect on what&#39;s been said it can change your<br/>
whole life--for the better. That&#39;s been my experience anyway.<br/>
I&#39;ve printed out heaps of stuff from the list and read it over and over and<br/>
that has helped me a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s such a new way of thinking it takes time for it to make sense. Part of<br/>
the making sense of it comes with living it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that makes sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sorry, I came here for helpful suggestions and all of a sudden<br/>
 felt like it was me on trial for being a bad parent, and in front of<br/>
 the whole group, and being new and all.  It&#39;s just a bit<br/>
 overwhelming.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry too. I got on here late from an incredibly long and eventfully fun<br/>
day. I had lots to say, but it&#39;s late and I&#39;m tired and really have nothing<br/>
new to contribute that hasn&#39;t already been said. I&#39;ve read all the posts and<br/>
have seen plenty of very helpful suggestions regarding the questions and<br/>
problems you are having. My suggestion would be to save them all, read them<br/>
again with a more calming frame of mind another day. You sound frustrated<br/>
and overwhelmed. Take a breath and read the posts for all the help they are<br/>
giving. It really is there.<br/>

that&#39;s the flavor of this group, really it is! The interactions with <br/>
you are mild in comparison to some I&#39;ve seen! LOL Myself, included... <br/>
besides this list, a newcomer to the concept of unschooling (Natural <br/>
Learning!!!) should read the online articles at Sandra&#39;s site... <br/>
Unschooling.com??? Is that right??? ack...also, offline, read John <br/>
Holt. He&#39;s GOOD. Also, my own personal &quot;mind changing author&quot; John <br/>
Taylor Gatto...these two authors will change how you think about the <br/>
nature of learning...well, they did for me, anyway. Read, read, read! <br/>
Get your mind wrapped around the idea that The Brain picks up <br/>
knowledge everywhere and in an infinitude of ways, with or without a <br/>
lot of push from outside.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll do just fine! Don&#39;t let these fierce folks scare ya! LOL <br/>
they&#39;re terrific, really they are...<br/>
