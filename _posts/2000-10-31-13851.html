<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723095996">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying reading about parent responsibility in exposing our<br/>
children to variety.<br/>
I like looking for interesting things for my son and I to explore.  It&#39;s<br/>
fascinating to find<br/>
out what will excite him and he wants to find out more about.  Lately he<br/>
is playing &quot;The<br/>
Incredible Toon Machine&quot; on the computer.  He plays it a few times a<br/>
day, probably<br/>
totally an hour.   I don&#39;t have a major problem with this, I just want<br/>
him (and me) to have<br/>
variety in our day.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a Christian home schooler, but I&#39;m not against finding our<br/>
about Christian values.<br/>
When I first moved here, a Baptist homeschooling Mom loaned me a<br/>
Charlotte Mason book.<br/>
One of the things I gathered out of it is Jesus doesn&#39;t want us to put<br/>
obstacles in front of our<br/>
Children&#39;s learning.  Sounds kind of Unschooling to me.  Charlotte Mason<br/>
feels children,<br/>
particularly younger children should have the afternoon off to explore.<br/>
