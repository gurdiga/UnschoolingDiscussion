<div id="ygrps-yiv-578241425">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to find out about homeschooling, unschooling.. In <br/>
different countries. Next year I will be getting married :).<br/>
So I will be moving to Norway. I have been unschooling my son for 2 <br/>
years. And I am running into no luck with finding information on the <br/>
homeschooling atmosphere in Norway. I do know it is legal. But can&#39;t <br/>
seem to find any current information.<br/>
If anyone can help, or knows of someone homeschooling there. I would <br/>
much appreciate the help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all,  :)<br/>
<br/>

Home Education Magazine (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com)<br/>
Jon&#39;s Homeschool Resource Pages<br/>
(http://www.midnightbeach.com/hs/listlist.f.html)<br/>
<br/>
have good links to international groups.  But the only page I&#39;ve seen<br/>
referenced about Norway is in Norwegian.<br/>
<br/>
Opplysnings Tjenesten for Hjemmeundervisning<br/>
http://bdd.no/oth/<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t read Norwegian, there&#39;s a website translator at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.tranexp.com:2000/InterTran?<br/>
<br/>
Give it the URL of the page, pick your from and to languages at the bottom<br/>
and hit translate.  (Which I think is way cool :-)<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while for the page to load and a while for the translation to<br/>
appear so you might need a bit of patience. The output is interesting if not<br/>
exactly fine English. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an English abstract that might help:<br/>
