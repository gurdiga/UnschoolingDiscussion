<div id="ygrps-yiv-409408866">There are times when unschooling just happens and life goes by and (while we<br/>
really enjoy it and do a lot of fun things) it doesn&#39;t strike me how cool it<br/>
all is, and then there&#39;s these little moments that stand out (perhaps<br/>
because they&#39;re so different than what I&#39;d do as a child) that make me<br/>
realize what a great gift it is to be living and learning this way. Just<br/>
thought I&#39;d share a couple:<br/>
<br/>
My son had a friend over this week for a sleepover playdate (the first time<br/>
we&#39;ve done this). My son is 6, his friend is 10 and also an unschooler. My<br/>
son still needs me to lie down with him to go to sleep, so when I was<br/>
getting tired, I told the boys that I was going to bed and that they could<br/>
stay up but please don&#39;t step on dd (who insisted on giving the friend her<br/>
bed to sleep in and she slept on the floor). My son wanted to go to bed then<br/>
so that he could snuggle to sleep with me. His older friend didn&#39;t blink an<br/>
eye and certainly never teased him or made an issue of it (from my<br/>
experiences as a kid with school friends, that would be a prime opportunity<br/>
for teasing). The boys popped out of bed at 5:45 and excitedly rushed<br/>
downstairs to fire up the computer and use the chess tutorial. They had only<br/>
made it through half of the tutorial lessons the night before and they<br/>
really wanted to go through all of them. So that was one of those funny<br/>
unschooling moments I&#39;m just momentarily blown away by the things they do. I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine as a schooled child ever rushing out of bed before the sun<br/>
came up in order to do a chess tutorial!<br/>
<br/>
The other cool thing was last night my son was asking me what the biggest<br/>
number on earth was, and I explained that there is no such thing, because<br/>
you can always add on to any number and make it bigger. So I mentioned the<br/>
concept of infinity and he just stopped still. I could almost see him just<br/>
turning that concept over and around in his brain and after a few minutes of<br/>
silence (unusual for him) he said &quot;Wow mom, that idea&#39;s just too big.&quot; We<br/>
talked about it some more and I could see the idea starting to take real<br/>
shape in his brain. Then I mentioned that there was a symbol for infinity<br/>
and he surprised me by saying &quot;It&#39;s a sideways &#39;8&#39; isn&#39;t it?&quot; I have no idea<br/>
where he got that from--some random unschooling connection in his brain to<br/>
somewhere else. I love seeing that kind of spark happen. So he drew the<br/>
symbol, and then I showed him how to make a moebius strip<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mathforum.org/sum95/math_and/moebius/moebius.html">http://mathforum.org/sum95/math_and/moebius/moebius.html</a> if you don&#39;t<br/>
remember that one from school) which came to mind while thinking of the<br/>
infinity symbol. We had this long interesting discussion about numbers,<br/>
infinity, the universe, etc. that went on as we got ready for bed and right<br/>
up until the second he fell asleep, mid-sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of cool moments from the unschooling river of life. Anyone<br/>
else care to share theirs today?<br/>
