<div id="ygrps-yiv-626265113">&lt;&lt; Because I&#39;m quite interested in what you have to say about homeopathy.<br/>

Hi Tia,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been having a lot of trouble with my mail program, so some messages<br/>
have been going <br/>
through and others haven&#39;t. I noticed my reply to your message didn&#39;t go<br/>
through, so I just wanted to say that if you ever have any questions (or<br/>
thoughts) about homeopathy, please don&#39;t hesitate to e-mail  me privately:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bluelotus@...">bluelotus@...</a><br/>
<br/>
The same goes for anybody on this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
