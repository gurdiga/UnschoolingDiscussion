<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918569238">Hi,<br/>
    My dd aged 9 (birthday today) really wants to earn her own money. <br/>
Not doing chores or stuff like that. She wants a sense of &#39;properly&#39; <br/>
earning money. I&#39;m a bit stuck for ideas to help her.<br/>
<br/>
We live in the UK and there are lots of restrictions on the work <br/>
children can do and when. Most things she is too young for atm.<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe there might be something she could do at home? Not <br/>
sure about how I can help her. I wonder if anyone has any ideas?<br/>

<br/>
Do you have a neighbor with younger children for whom she might work as a <br/>
mother&#39;s helper?   Maybe she could play with them, help them pick up toys, help <br/>
them with shoes and socks, teach them games and songs.   <br/>
<br/>
When Holly was born, Marty was two and Kirby was five.   I had a 12 year old <br/>
neighbor who used to come over a couple of hours a day for $2 an hour at <br/>
first, later $3 and eventually $4 an hour if I wasn&#39;t home (when she was older, 15 <br/>
or so).   It was spending money for her and a break for me, and a break for <br/>
her because when she was home she was expected to take care of her own younger <br/>
sisters for nothing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147102116">Sell things on eBay?  An adult may have to be the official account holder.<br/>
<br/>
I resell toys and games that I find cheap at thrift stores or tag sales.  You have to know your stuff, though.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good idea to browse eBay for the types of items you would sell to see how much they are selling and what prices.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make much money, but it&#39;s something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337216625">My son earned over 2000 dollars in three years selling chocolate chip<br/>
oatmeal cookies to neighbors once a week on Sunday nights (delivered<br/>
warm). He also sold them in front of supermarkets several times,<br/>
earning up to a hundred dollars in a day. He ended up with regular<br/>
weekly customers (still has them) and those faithful customers went on<br/>
to hire him for other activities once they got to know him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110384446">My 13 yo (she was 12 last summer) sells tie dye<br/>
shirts, boxers, onesies, etc. at the farmer&#39;s market<br/>
one day a month and makes $150 or so a day.  Starting<br/>
at 5,  she made and sold collaged paper greeting cards<br/>
at a local art gallery, and then knitting needles, and<br/>
then felted wool masks.  We also have monthly or so<br/>
lemonade stands in front of our house, and the kids<br/>
make at least enough money for us all to go to the ice<br/>
cream parlor.  <br/>

you thank you for wishing her a happy birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to say thanks  to everyone for the ideas. Lots to <br/>
think about :)<br/>
