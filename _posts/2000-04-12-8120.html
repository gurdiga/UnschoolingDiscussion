<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617100684">Thanks for the input on my question- it&#39;s all great food for thought. I<br/>
absolutely believe in the process of unschooling and do not worry about<br/>
whether my daughters are learning or not- I know they are. I&#39;m also not<br/>
worried that they don&#39;t think they&#39;re learning- they&#39;re both very confident<br/>
and think they know everything ;-) I guess I&#39;m torn when it comes to<br/>
labelling or pointing out their learning though. It&#39;s important for them to<br/>
know that they are capable learners and to acknowledge just how much<br/>
learning is going on, but I also don&#39;t want to separate life out like that-<br/>
it&#39;s ALL learning. And that&#39;s it, isn&#39;t it- I hate that question! When<br/>
people ask what we did today, I feel that I&#39;m being asked to make our life<br/>
fit into their idea of what &quot;real&quot; learning is. And I don&#39;t want to!<br/>
(Erin&#39;s right- I did have to take ownership of the &quot;problem&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I did have a good discussion with my daughters tonight and I feel<br/>
better. I realised that I&#39;d never really told them what unschooling is, so<br/>
we talked about that and what it means to all of us. I told Zoe that our<br/>
reading the Little House books could be thought of as her &quot;history lesson&quot;,<br/>
that asking her to double the dipping sauce recipe tonight could be her<br/>
&quot;math lesson&quot; and it was like the light came on in her head! She said, &quot;Oh,<br/>
then when I read the story of Romulus and Remus to Molly this morning, that<br/>
could be _her_ history lesson!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We decided that when someone asks again, they can tell people about the<br/>
books they&#39;re reading, the things they&#39;re building in the workshop, the<br/>
stories they&#39;re working on... and that they played all day too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again- I&#39;d still like to hear more!<br/>
