<div id="ygrps-yiv-537447812">Our dog Joy had her puppies last night!.   We intended to get her spayed, <br/>
but, .. well, we didnt have it done in time.  At first, we were bummed <br/>
because we really didn&#39;t want puppies.  The expense of getting vaccinations <br/>
and deworming.. The hassle of trying to find good homes.   The MESS of a <br/>
litter of puppies... BUT, of course, the bigger Joy&#39;s belly got, the more <br/>
excited we got about our new additions. And, she is now scheduled to be <br/>
spayed in June, so we won&#39;t have any more (at first) &quot;unwanted&quot; litters.<br/>
<br/>
   There is only one problem.  She had them under a very low floor of our <br/>
work shop. It&#39;s probably about an 8 inch space from the ground to the floor.  <br/>
She had a nice bed in the basement.    She usually stays inside(upstairs, in <br/>
the house with us) at night, but she made it clear she wanted OUT!..   She <br/>
did have one puppy in her bed in the basement, but then she went under the <br/>
workshop.  We found the lone puppy this morning, healthy, cleaned up, but <br/>
obviously hungry.   He was HUGE!.. Joy is a yellow lab, I swear, the father <br/>
must have been a St Bernard.. lol.   Anyway, we took the puppy to her, as <br/>
close as we could reach.   She was wayyyy under the building.. At first, it <br/>
was touch and go.. She came out and sniffed him, licked him, but left him.  <br/>
Dh and I went back inside, I thought maybe she would come get the puppy if we <br/>
left her alone.  Dh went back out to check a few minutes later, and she had <br/>
gotten the puppy!..   <br/>
<br/>
I REALLY did not want her to have them under the workshop, but I guess <br/>
&quot;Mother knows best&quot;  .. She wanted to be safe( from our other male dog) and <br/>
isolated..   Now, I am just dying to know how many she had, what they look <br/>
like, their genders..   OK, now here is where I could use some advice.  <br/>
Should be try to get them out?  We can tear the floor up on the workshop to <br/>
get to her, but, should be just leave her where she is?   She is usually very <br/>
happy indoors.. But, I suppose animal instincts precedence over domesticated <br/>
traits.  Any advice?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585450668">Congratulations on your newest additions!  Puppies are *so* cute!<br/>
<br/>
However, &lt;bg&gt;, I&#39;d say get back into the unschooling mode and let Momma Joy <br/>
decide what&#39;s best for her and her babies.  Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, <br/>
but she probably doesn&#39;t want humans around too much either, which is why <br/>
she may have chosen such a place.  To her, it seems warm, comfy and SAFE!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you are right.. That is the very reason she had her puppies out of <br/>
our reach.  We are not going to try to move them.. But, now we have another <br/>
situation on our hands.  She abandoned one of the puppies ( not the first one <br/>
that she originally left in the basement), .. She moved it out from under the <br/>
workshop, still wet, with the cord and sack still attached.  DH cut the cord <br/>
and put the puppy back under the workshop.. Little while later, she had moved <br/>
him back out.  So, evidently, she is not going to accept him.. He seems  OK.. <br/>
strong, able to nurse.. We brought him in, cleaned him up with a dry towel <br/>
and got him warmed up.  We made him a bed with a hot water bottle and some <br/>
shredded newspapers in a little box.  I went and go the pet nurser and some <br/>
puppy milk.  We ended up putting his milk in a regular baby bottle because <br/>
the nipple was way too small for him.  He sucked and rooted and sucked and <br/>
rooted.. I think he got some milk, but he still seems hungry.  Anna is <br/>
holding him, keeping him warm.   Right now, we are hoping that when Joy comes <br/>
out to eat, we can maybe get her to lie still long enough to nurse him for a <br/>
while.   I just couldnt bring myself to let him lay out there on the ground <br/>
crying so loudly to die.   We already named him Siren, because when he cries, <br/>
it sounds exactly like an Ambulance siren.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s fine if you&#39;re raising &quot;strays&quot; that may have no contact with humans. <br/>
But I&#39;m guessing that you would be placing these pups in new homes in 8 weeks <br/>
or so. They need human contact early to make good pets. Get them out from <br/>
under the shed. Block it up. Set her up an nice, warm bed with towels and <br/>
newspapers. Handle the pups every day. Keep them clean and warm and safe. And <br/>
don&#39;t place them before 8 weeks old. They need their siblings and mother for <br/>
a while to understand how to bite (and NOT!).<br/>

You can google &quot;dog breeding&quot; and probably get some good sites for dealing <br/>
with whelps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028132187">Hmm, never really thought of it that way, good point!  Then again, I&#39;ve <br/>
never had a dog with puppies, so I&#39;m probably not the best person for giving <br/>
advice, either. LOL<br/>
