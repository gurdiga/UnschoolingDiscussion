&gt;  One day I was on instant message with a friend in Seattle right after the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure that was very scary. I didn&#39;t mean to scare anyone or bring back <br/>
memories of earthquakes. Since you only received one email, and the same may <br/>
be true of others, I&#39;ll explain what happened. <br/>
<br/>
I was deleting my old mail, using both my mouse and my enter button to speed <br/>
things along, and ended up getting way ahead of one of the actions somehow. I <br/>
accidentally sent two empty replies to an old earthquake email. I felt like a <br/>
complete idiot and decided to just laugh at myself. I hope you don&#39;t feel I <br/>
was making light of earthquakes.<br/>
