<div id="ygrps-yiv-632850044">My seven year old dd wants to do some kind of work I<br/>
think to make money. One idea she has is teaching<br/>
baking to kids. I thinks it&#39;s great AND she has a very<br/>
intense personality. So I am not completely<br/>
comfortable with the idea because I don&#39;t think she is<br/>
ready for it. I am concerned she will get dissapointed<br/>
when kids aren&#39;t paying attention etc. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone experienced kids wanting to do things before<br/>
they are really ready? How do I support in this or not<br/>
gracefully.<br/>

Lawrence, Kansas is a magical wonderful place.<br/>
<br/>
I would hire a seven year old to play with my kids.  $3.00 an hour.<br/>
Well not now, because my kids are all over seven.  But if I had three <br/>
younger-than-seven kids, I would hire a homeschooled kid in a heartbeat just <br/>
to be there and make their time different, to just play with them and help <br/>
them get a drink of water and run around with them so they were having fun <br/>
and I could take a shower or something mothers of toddlers hardly get to do.<br/>
<br/>
I used to hire a homeschooling neighbor on those terms, but she was twelve.  <br/>
I would&#39;ve hired her younger, she just didn&#39;t happen to BE younger.   That <br/>
was when Holly was born, Kirby was five and Marty was three.  I could hang <br/>
out with the baby better with an older assistant!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181148575">The &quot;mommy&#39;s helper&quot; idea is so cute, and from the responses Ive seen, I <br/>
think you may have a good chance of finding someone to help accomodate your <br/>
daughters wish.    I know my daughter would have LOVED to have been a Mommys <br/>
helper when she was 7.. Actually, she was..lol. She was my helper.. and also <br/>
my sisters&#39;  We all had babies within 6mos of each other when Anna was <br/>
5-51/2.. She still babysits for her neices and nephews.. Now she can do it <br/>
alone and into the late night.   OK.. ( sorry for getting on a tangent <br/>
there..)..   I was going to offer some other suggestions.  I dont know your <br/>
family situation, but my kids have always &quot;worked&quot; for thier grandparents.   <br/>
Grandma and Grandpa would ( and still do) give them little jobs to do for <br/>
them.  They felt so proud to be &quot;working&quot; and also to make a little $$.. It <br/>
was more than an allowance from Mom and Dad , it was more like a job.   If <br/>
your parents are not available or willing to do this, how about a neighbor or <br/>
church member, or other family member?.   They would give them jobs like <br/>
sweeping the porch , helping in the garden, washing the car, house cleaning,  <br/>
organizing the desk.. all kinds of things.   My dad is a farmer so there is <br/>
always an abundance of little chores for the kids to do that he is glad to <br/>
have someone do ( you know.. the dirty work.. lol)..  I think when kids show <br/>
interest in working and earning money, its a good thing to encourage.  <br/>
Children really learn respect for money and material things when they earn <br/>
and spend thier own money<br/>
