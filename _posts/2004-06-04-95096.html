<div id="ygrps-yiv-516189626">This whole discussion has been interesting.<br/>
I was reading some of  &quot;Everyday Zen&quot; last night before bed, and this paragraph jumped out at me. Very relevant to this discussion I thought. The preceding paragraph was about how people tend to be always looking to some future event, some new purchase or state of being in order to be content:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But when we do that we never see tis right-here-now, this very moment. We can&#39;t see it because we&#39;re filtering.  What&#39;s coming in is something quite different.  Just ask any ten people who read this book.  You&#39;ll find they all tellyou something different.  They&#39;ll forget the parts that don&#39;t quite catch them, they&#39;ll pick u something else, and they&#39;ll even block out the parts they don&#39;t like.  Even when we got to our Zen teacher we hear only what we want to hear.  Being open to a teacher means not just hearing what you want to hear, but hearing the whole thing. And the teacher&#39;s not there simply to be nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those last two sentences are particularly relevant to unschooling discussions. Some people can&#39;t get past the ego issues to hear the information that is being shared, they want to get all riled up because someone questioned their parenting practices.<br/>
I find that centered, mindful and grounded people, don&#39;t react that way. (as you can see I have a long ways to go!!) They are convicted about their choices and very comfortable defending them. They can be questioned and not feel attacked....<br/>
Zen is the answer to all the world&#39;s problems I&#39;ve decided. Zen and unschooling.:)<br/>
