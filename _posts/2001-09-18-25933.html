<div id="ygrps-yiv-140103010">Saturday morning, I had gotten up at 7:30 to wake Kirby up for work.  I made <br/>
him pancakes while he was in the shower.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had stayed with friends overnight, and I was prepared to pick her up <br/>
after lunch and take her to the first rehearsal meeting for an avante-garde <br/>
performance of the Nutcracker.  Marty was asleep, having stayed up late <br/>
playing games with friends.  <br/>
<br/>
After I took Kirby to work, I came online to see someone telling me to get <br/>
offline and go unschool my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s friend called and I told him to come on over and wake Marty up if he <br/>
wanted to.  They ended up spending the rest of the day together, at our house.<br/>
<br/>
I took Holly to the dance meeting (three hours, half of which the parents <br/>
were excused to leave, and I went to buy Kirby a wallet because he&#39;s going to <br/>
an anime convention next weekend and could use one).  She decided after all <br/>
not to participate, which was a relief to me since the practices would have <br/>
been four nights a week a long way from our house.  We took another girl <br/>
home, and came home to get ready to go to a Pictionary-tournament birthday <br/>
party 20 miles away (an adult party, mostly lesbians, only one other kid, but <br/>
all adults from our house went; teens declined--Marty stayed home alone and <br/>
Kirby was at D&D).<br/>
<br/>
We tried calling Kirby but he had given another friend&#39;s number accidently <br/>
(pretty funny in the end, among all the kids, and ended up not mattering <br/>
much).<br/>
<br/>
Came home, I went to the D&D game, Kirby and two of those kids came home with <br/>
me; it was 11:30 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
I got up about 2:00 to see how they were doing and remind them to be quiet <br/>
(they weren&#39;t being really loud anyway).  Kirby was already asleep, the rest <br/>
said.  That was good because at 8:30 Kirby had to be at an all day bokudo <br/>
workshop (karate, weapons).  So I woke him up, again, at 7:30, and got him to <br/>
the dojo.<br/>
<br/>
That made 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing in that time that wasn&#39;t pretty warm and productive was <br/>
someone here criticizing me for being online instead of unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-554033398">Wow!....and you can document it too!! I suppose it is<br/>
the left over social anthropologist leanings, but I do<br/>
so much enjoy peeking into other people&#39;s lives, or<br/>
maybe I am plain nosey.......<br/>
Thanks, Sharon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689148326">I&#39;ve added a couple of typical days to my collection here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
One is actually one of mine (bottom left) but one is a very sweet one about <br/>
pi and arabic calligraphy which was posted on www.unschooling.com.  So those of <br/>
you who read there might already have seen it, but for others I thought it <br/>
was worth seeing.  And that&#39;s Becca&#39;s, the top on the right/main column.<br/>
