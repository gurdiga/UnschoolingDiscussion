<div id="ygrps-yiv-718936081">I was replacing a tree I had swiped and colored with trees given to  <br/>
me by an artist friend, and in testing the pages (search, bad  <br/>
message, google search of my page stuff), I came across someone  <br/>
citing one of my pages and also going off wildly on others on the  <br/>
discussion.  The were in England, and male, and it&#39;s a few years old,  <br/>
so I cringed and went to make sure the page he kept listing was still  <br/>
functional.<br/>
<br/>
It was, but some links were bad.  So I&#39;ve been checking, replacing,  <br/>
tweaking the page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/s/proof">http://sandradodd.com/s/proof</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a happy page.  It&#39;s about recommendations for spanking.  But  <br/>
in the decription (online in a catalog) of a pro-spanking book I  <br/>
found this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Best seller! From successful parents, learn how to train up your  <br/>
children rather than discipline them up. With humor and real-life  <br/>
examples this book shows you how to train your children before the  <br/>
need to discipline arises. Be done with corrective discipline; make  <br/>
them allies rather than adversaries. The stress will be gone and your  <br/>
obedient children will praise you and bring joy and peace into your  <br/>
home. Thousands have testified to the amazing results of these  <br/>
profoundly simple techniques.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The phrase &quot;make them allied rather than adversaries&quot; is from  <br/>
attachment parenting and La Leche League, neither of which is  <br/>
recommending spanking.<br/>
<br/>
Language like that as a cover for spanking is kind of despicable, but  <br/>
it reminds me to remind you not to assume that all people are using  <br/>
all phrases and words with the same intent.<br/>
