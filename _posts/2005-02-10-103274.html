<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618719186">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
we could need some support and enlightenment here in Germany. Currently,<br/>
there is again a case of religious homeschoolers being harrassed by the<br/>
school authorities. Here is an account of the case:<br/>
www.hslda.org/hs/international/Germany/200501100.asp?PrinterFriendly=True<br/>
<br/>
As Mike Fortune-Wood put it on the learning-unlimited mailing list:<br/>
&quot;I think one of the problems in Germany is that the public have the idea<br/>
that the only reason one would home educate is one of religious<br/>
separatism. That parents with extreme religious views want to keep their<br/>
children away from modern society and teach them what many secular<br/>
people would think of as being odd ideas.<br/>
Its noticeable that all the groups that we have heard about are such<br/>
groups and even the newspaper polls that have been run work on that<br/>
assumption.<br/>
Because of this the public in Germany believe that home education is not<br/>
about the best interest of the child but rather about the parents<br/>
disseminating (again what many members of the public - probably all but<br/>
a few would see as being) a strange world view.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if you could write to the persons below to tell them<br/>
that homeschooling has different faces, that it is a completely accepted<br/>
educational alternative in your country and how much you love your<br/>
homeschooling lifestyle:<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Ute Schaefer, Secretary for Education in Northrhine-Westfalia:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ute.schaefer@...">ute.schaefer@...</a><br/>
Mr. Manfred Mueller, Landrat Paderborn (county official):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:landrat@...">landrat@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Ute Schaefer used to be an English teacher, so no problem to write in<br/>
English. One homeschooling mother here in Germany called the local<br/>
authorities in January and got the answer: &quot;Oh yes, I am familiar with<br/>
homeschooling. It is for circus children.&quot; Here is an interview Ms.<br/>
Schaefer gave on Jan. 17th, translated into English:<br/>
<br/>
Interview with the Minister for Schools and Children, Ms. Ute Schaefer, <br/>
given by the NRW press entitled: Compulsory Schooling isn&#39;t an End in <br/>
Itself (Schulpflicht ist kein Selbstzweck, 17.1.05)<br/>
<br/>
Summary: Seven Families who are members of an extreme-Baptist community <br/>
in  Paderborn are refusing to send their 15 children to school (as we <br/>
have reported). No solution to this problem in Paderborn is in sight. <br/>
The county government Integration Official, Klaus Lefringhausen, wants <br/>
to conduct talks with the parents. NRW Minister<br/>
for Schools Ute Sch√§fer (SPD party) gives her first public interview <br/>
about the case here. This interview was conducted by Carsten Heil.<br/>
<br/>
Heil: Ms. Schaefer, can you understand the point of view of the Baptist <br/>
families who are not sending their children to school?<br/>
<br/>
Schaefer: The Compulsory Education law is a child&#39;s right to education <br/>
and to grow up within our community. It is a cornerstone of our society <br/>
in Germany. Therefore, it is the parent&#39;s duty to let children <br/>
participate. Thus I have  no understanding for parents who behave in <br/>
this way.<br/>
<br/>
Heil: What is to be done, now, to resolve this impasse in Paderborn?<br/>
<br/>
Schaefer: The well-being of the children must be at the center of our <br/>
efforts. For that there are legal guidelines, in which all parties are <br/>
now involved. Klaus Lefringhausen, the county Integration Official, has <br/>
been called on to arbitrate. He is on the job now. I don&#39;t wish to <br/>
anticipate the outcome of these talks. But it is completely clear, that <br/>
the law of Compulsury Education will be enforced. It isn&#39;t an end unto <br/>
itself, rather we are thinking about the children. And that is what is <br/>
in our hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Heil: The effected families have applied to found their own school. <br/>
Shouldn&#39;t the school authorities at least look their application over?<br/>
<br/>
Schaefer:  In our county, Nordrhein-Westfalen, we have faith-based <br/>
schools. They are open for all other children. We have an excellent <br/>
supply of those schools for parents who want to send their children to a <br/>
Christian-oriented school. I don&#39;t see any need for any further schools.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your support!<br/>

<br/>
The U.S. has probably hundreds of thousands of homeschoolers who fit that <br/>
description, so it&#39;s a stereotype with a solid basis and many living examples.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s unfortunate, but if homeschoolers deny it exists, it makes them all <br/>
look underhanded and dishonest.   So when homeschoolers say &quot;That&#39;s not true,&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Why would you think that?&quot; it only helps the critics entrench deeper.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s better to say &quot;Though some do, others don&#39;t!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But in a society used to more conformity (Japan, Germany) and less individual <br/>
&quot;whatever&quot; (Canada &lt;g&gt;), that honesty might be enough to make people say &quot;If <br/>
ONE family wants to keep kids home to tell them dinosaurs are a Satanic plot <br/>
and that Jesus is coming before May so going to school would have been stupid, <br/>
then homeschooling will never be legal here.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
HEY!  So in Germany it&#39;s legal for circus children to homeschool?<br/>
Cool!  I had heard it was illegal in Germany, period.<br/>

<br/>
I realize it was translated, but this is one of the problems with <br/>
&quot;compulsory&quot; and &quot;let&quot; all in one place.  If it&#39;s compulsory, parents don&#39;t &quot;let&quot; them <br/>
participate, they are bound by law to force them to participate.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of random foreigners writing to a government official in <br/>
Germany, a bright German writer should summarize other kinds of homeschooling, <br/>
listing other countries in which homeschooling has taken hold without disasters, <br/>
and work from inside that way.  People tend to hate to hear from outsiders, <br/>
&quot;Well WE do it this way.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609441063">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
the translation is correct. Ute Schaefer actually said &quot;The Compulsory <br/>
Education law is a child&#39;s right to education and to grow up within our <br/>
community. It is the parent&#39;s duty to grant their children this right.&quot; <br/>
But what happens if the child himself decides that &quot;no, thank you&quot; he <br/>
prefers not to make use of his right to state education? Can and/or <br/>
should a right be transformed into compulsion?<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>

homeschooling,<br/>

disasters,<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what I have just done, my book was published last <br/>
December: www.leben-ohne-schule.de/schulfrei.html. Hope that more <br/>
information about homeschooling will some day bring about a change of <br/>
compulsory schooling laws to a right to education. Unfortunately, we <br/>
Germans can be really conservative, pigheaded and reluctant to try <br/>
something new.<br/>
<br/>
Many greetings from Germany,<br/>
