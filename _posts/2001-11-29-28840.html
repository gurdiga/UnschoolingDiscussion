<br/>
Yes, Tia.  I think you have it there.  We must trust that kids know what<br/>
they want and know what they want bad enough to do the work for.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane, 10yo, wants to compete with the gymnastic team but isn&#39;t willing to<br/>
spend the time perfecting her routines so her scores tend to lag.  She loves<br/>
the team classes with all her friends, laughing and teasing each other.  The<br/>
coach told the girls that when they could do the splits in several different<br/>
directions she would give each girl a sticker for the car window with their<br/>
name on it.  Adriane worked day and night until she got the sticker.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane came to me and asked that I help her with spelling because she isn&#39;t<br/>
so great in that area.  Within a week, there was a big improvement.<br/>
