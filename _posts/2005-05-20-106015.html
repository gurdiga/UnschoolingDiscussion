<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435087385">Robyn were you by chance referring to Prader Willi as the condition <br/>
where you can&#39;t tell if your full? If so, there&#39;s a lot more to PW <br/>
then just not being able to stop eating. If anyone is interested a <br/>
good site is:<br/>

<br/>
One of my 3 children has problems with food with regards to not <br/>
knowing when he has consumed to much. He has a enormous appetite in <br/>
general but when left to his own he has consumed more then his father <br/>
who is a big eater as well. I find that cutting down on his sugar, <br/>
flour and wheat intake has assisted him a lot. I also try to balance <br/>
his foods so that when he eats he gets a mix of a protein, carb, and <br/>
fat. <br/>
<br/>
JAMA has published a lot of articles with regards to behavioral <br/>
characteristics of eating. They are pretty interestings to read <br/>
through if you have time.<br/>
<br/>
Deece have you taken her to an allergist, RD, or nutritionist by <br/>
chance? Most MD&#39;s don&#39;t really have a clue when it comes to issues <br/>
such as this unfortunately. <br/>
<br/>
Does she eat a lot of refined foods by chance? Unfortunately we used <br/>
to. Then when we made the slow switch to whole foods we began to see <br/>
a change and then when we cut down on the sugar, flours and wheat we <br/>
saw even more of a change. <br/>
<br/>
I can see a dramatic difference when I serve him a pasta dish vs a <br/>
barely or quinoa dish not only in the amounts he consumes but the way <br/>
he consumes them. <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you and your family, I know what your going through.<br/>
<br/>
Peace-<br/>
