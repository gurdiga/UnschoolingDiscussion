<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832162619">Hi Karin,<br/>
We are north here in Cave Creek. I am involved in a co-op also in Phoenix.<br/>
Do you participate in any homeschool groups in town? How old are your kids?<br/>
Thank you for the note!<br/>
Talk to you soon, feel free to privately email me unless everyone else is in<br/>
AZ...Just kidding. Anybody in MIchigan or California? We frequently travel<br/>
there and used to live in MI.<br/>
Bye elana</div>
