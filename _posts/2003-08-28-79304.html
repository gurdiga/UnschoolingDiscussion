<br/>
Alexander William Lenhart was born at 4:02 AM on August 24. He weighted 8<br/>
lbs and 4 oz.  He&#39;s got a big shock of black hair and is cute as a button.<br/>
I got home Monday afternoon and all is well.  Except, of course, that I am<br/>
now realizing I was out of my mind to do this...-grin-<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d let people know that I won&#39;t be signing things &quot;the<br/>
pregnant one&quot; any more.<br/>
