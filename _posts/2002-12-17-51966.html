&lt;&lt;   They really enjoyed the posters today, <br/>
 and ds was satisfied at opening that one gift. But, now what?? What <br/>
 about tomorrow ? What if he wants to open all of his gifts and then <br/>
 he has none to open on Christmas Eve when the other children open <br/>
 thiers?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is why we don&#39;t put anything out before Christmas, except maybe a few, <br/>
just to look pretty.<br/>
I think it&#39;s just too hard for young children to avoid the temptation.<br/>
I also figure that until I choose to give the gift to someone, I still own <br/>
it. So since it&#39;s technically mine, I can say NO. hehe<br/>
But in our house we know they can&#39;t handle the temptation, so they all stay <br/>
hidden until everyone is asleep Christmas eve.<br/>
It would kinda spoil Christmas for me if they didn&#39;t have anything left to <br/>
open.<br/>
I do buy an advent calender for each of them, which they get a treat from <br/>
every day (Trevor has decided he doesn&#39;t like chocolate through this <br/>
experience and gives his to the wee babsy man) which takes the edge off a <br/>
little.<br/>
And they always open one on Christmas Eve.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Have him wrap up some stuff in his room or let other kids, and let him <br/>
guess <br/>
 what (of his familiar stuff) is in there?  Wrap up pajamas before bed?  Wrap <br/>
 up his pillow?  Maybe that would make it all kinda funny and fun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yes! That&#39;s a really good idea. Sierra used up a big wad of wrapping paper <br/>
the other night when I was getting the Alaska box ready.<br/>
She wrapped her silkie and a bunch of stuff. Just having paper and tape can <br/>
be a wonderful distraction. I buy so much tape these days.....sigh<br/>

some with the kids, but with all the busyness I decided the dollar store one <br/>
were just fine this time!!  It would be fun to see all the different types....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975648908">We give a small gift or two and candy for St. Nicholas Day (12/6), the <br/>
stockings are left on the couch on Christmas morning and the kids can play <br/>
with those when they wake up.(I fill them as much as possible with things <br/>
from the Dollar Store and Party City).  We open the big gifts later in the <br/>
morning.  This year we&#39;ll need to cover the big gifts with a sheet on <br/>
Christmas Eve or my 2yods will open everything.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well this year the cat and the kitten were driving me crazy making their own <br/>
little place under the tree. My velour tree skirt was covered in hair and I <br/>
just couldn&#39;t keep it clean for more than an hour. So I cleaned it one last <br/>
time, wrapped all the gifts and put them under the tree. Cats can&#39;t get to <br/>
it now. I thought after my 2 year old started to ask to open them that it <br/>
was a mistake. But she surprised me as usual and has been very good. No <br/>
shaking or anything. She understands now that on Christmas she can open <br/>
some. Of course she has no idea when that is so every day she asks. She also <br/>
goes and shows everyone how we have Merry Christmas under the tree! Aren&#39;t <br/>
kids just the best??!!!!<br/>
