<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573197792">Somehow the following paragraph got edited weird and I didn&#39;t <br/>
re-read it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Writing? I teach writing online to homeschooling families. The <br/>
main thing I can say is this. Kids whose mothers worry about <br/>
their kids writing tend to produce kids who either hate to write or <br/>
lifeless, stiff writers. Mothers who back off, spend tons of time <br/>
talking with their children, read lots of good literature and where <br/>
writing that is produced is enjoyed and read tend to produce <br/>
better writters.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Can&#39;t let my paragraph on writing go when it was so awkward! <br/>
Needed a good edit. &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>

running club for homeschooled kids run by Patti<br/>
Dillon, a former top marathon runner who is now<br/>
homeschooling her kids. Cool!<br/>
