<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128841546">Thanks, Colette, that&#39;s really interesting. Our cats<br/>
don&#39;t go outside for all the reasons the Humane<br/>
Society warned us against it when we adopted them, but<br/>
for three other reasons, too. First, we love birds and<br/>
have feeders, and we don&#39;t want birds eaten or even<br/>
scared away by the cats. Next, like you said, it seems<br/>
unsanitary to let animals who go outside and get into<br/>
who knows what come in and walk around on your bed.<br/>
And your table and counters when you&#39;re not looking. I<br/>
walked a friend&#39;s dog for 6 weeks when she broke her<br/>
ankle, and the dog would walk RIGHT THROUGH other<br/>
dogs&#39; poop, and then go home and hop onto my friend&#39;s<br/>
couch. Third, we have allergies, and it&#39;s bad enough<br/>
to deal with cat fur without dealing with the pollen<br/>
they&#39;d bring in with them if they went outside.<br/>
<br/>
I admire your plans for animal rescue. After we saw a<br/>
dying loon on the beach, we called an animal rescue<br/>
person to ask what to do in the future in those<br/>
situations. She was incredibly helpful and spent an<br/>
hour on the phone educating us, just out of her love<br/>
of animals. Now we feel prepared to help birds of all<br/>
sorts!<br/>
<br/>
But this isn&#39;t about unschooling (except in the way<br/>
everything&#39;s unschooling)so I apologize. I was just<br/>
curious. Juli<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As with anything, this depends on the cat. We&#39;ve had our cat for 8 years and<br/>
so far he has killed one bird. I guess he&#39;s essentially lazy :-). Our<br/>
backyard is full of birds so even they know he&#39;s not a threat.<br/>
More or less, he&#39;s part of the family and comes and goes as he pleases.<br/>
We&#39;re lucky in that we live in an area where both our dog and cat can have<br/>
free reign. We have 3 empty lots next to us, one with a creek and foresty<br/>
area so they have lots of room to roam. When our current pets die, we won&#39;t<br/>
get anymore because we will want to start traveling more again and it&#39;s not<br/>
fair to leave them.<br/>
<br/>
All of our pets have been rescues. Our cat was a stray, I had 2 chinchillas<br/>
I rescued from a fur rancher, and my favorite pet of all was a rat that I<br/>
rescued from being snake food. She went everywhere with me for 4 years,<br/>
slept in my bed (only occasionally nipping my toes), and was a better pal<br/>
than most people I know. I still miss her!<br/>

I have a hard time believing that anyone can know how many animals their cats <br/>
are killing.  I live in an apartment complex and I see cats snagging birds <br/>
all the time, they seem to leave them right where they are, probably losing <br/>
interest once they stop moving.  My daughter find dead birds and rodents all <br/>
over the complex.<br/>
<br/>
If one does some research into the impact of cats on indigenous wildlife it <br/>
would be clear how harmful they are.  They don&#39;t bring home everything they <br/>
kill.<br/>

If they&#39;re like one of mine, it&#39;s probably because they get fed-up <br/>
of having their prey &#39;rescued&#39; when they bring their friends home <br/>
to play with...  One of ours retired from hunting (yes, we do knw <br/>
this) after he brought home a squirrel, and ate it, leaving the <br/>
&#39;trousers.&#39;  A neighbour with dubious habits told me he&#39;d seen the <br/>
cat take a squirrel through the cat-flap, and I didn&#39;t believe him <br/>
until I found the remains...  I can&#39;t complain about my cats&#39; <br/>
behaviour, we teach them to play, and their play is practice for <br/>
hunting, so if they can hunt, I&#39;ve done a good job...<br/>
<br/>
But then I&#39;m not vegetarian either...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231075063">Depends on the cat.  Depends on the owner.  Well fed cats hunt less than<br/>
those that aren&#39;t as well fed.  Certain breeds hunt more.  Females are more<br/>
likely to continue hunting if they aren&#39;t neutered.<br/>
<br/>
In our case, in this area we have crows that are huge!!!  They buzz cats and<br/>
believe me cats stay away from the crows!!!  We only have one cat that is<br/>
even vaguely interested in hunting and he is so uncoordinated that he is<br/>
lucky if he can climb up and down the stairs without falling on his face.<br/>
<br/>
As far as birds that folks find laying around dead, when I was doing<br/>
volunteer work with Bird Rescue, we found that most of the birds that we<br/>
picked up at apartment complexes and in the city had died as the result of<br/>
eating poison that was meant for mice, rats and pigeons.  another problem<br/>
was that they had gotten caught in that sticky stuff that some folks put out<br/>
and either starved or had eaten the sticky stuff off their feet and then<br/>
died.<br/>
<br/>
A good number of the birds also died compliments of children whose parents<br/>
thought BB guns and sling shots were cool toys!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In our case, we know our cat doesn&#39;t hunt because we lived with him on 4<br/>
acres for 7 years and in all those years of walking our acreage, we only<br/>
once saw him get a bird and we never found bird remains anywhere on our<br/>
property. He did get a few moles when he was younger and more energetic, but<br/>
he never ate them, he just brought them to our doorstep. I think because he<br/>
was a stray, he must&#39;ve been removed from his mother very young (he was<br/>
found as a kitten roving on his own). Often when this occurs, the kitten has<br/>
not been taught how to hunt and therefore does not have the skills necessary<br/>
to be a really effective hunter. When he did occasionally kill something (1<br/>
bird and a half dozen moles), he seemed to not know what to do with it, he<br/>
never ate them. OTOH, as far as the rodent problem, we had a huge problem<br/>
with rats living under our house and the cat was useless, he was terrified<br/>
of them. Even our dog ran away from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065275033">I just have to comment...we got a goat about a month ago and she sure looked <br/>
fat.  We kept thinking we needed to exercise her more.  We went on vacation <br/>
and the pet sitter calls to say &quot;ah...did you know your goat was pregnant??&quot;  <br/>
lo and behold we came home to a baby goat.  Unfortunately she was not doing <br/>
well so we began the adventure of looking up everything we could about goats, <br/>
raising kids ect.  after two days of being in the barn most of the night and <br/>
all day my husband the non animal lover in the house says to bring her in.  <br/>
Needless to say we now have a week old baby goat living in the <br/>

mice. Obviously, though, not everybody has a problem. They are everywhere <br/>
here. I draw the line for the mice when they get into the house and when <br/>
they start finding their way into the horses&#39;, dogs&#39;, and rabbit&#39;s food. And <br/>
I don&#39;t own a cat.<br/>

We once had a duckling that my son actually raised from an egg. <br/>
Dougal.  Dougal lived in the house, swam in the bath while eating <br/>
worms.  He thought my son was his mother and would quack wildly when <br/>
*mother* disappeared!!  As the duck grew, my son and his brothers and <br/>
friends would run around the garden wildly flapping their arms <br/>
teachimg dougal how to fly...<br/>

&lt;&lt; I said what I did because we have a major over population of squirrels and <br/>
 mice. Obviously, though, not everybody has a problem. They are everywhere <br/>
 here. I draw the line for the mice when they get into the house and when <br/>
 they start finding their way into the horses&#39;, dogs&#39;, and rabbit&#39;s food. And <br/>
 I don&#39;t own a cat. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I lived in a rural area we were inundated with mice.  The strange <br/>
benefit was an absolute absence of cockroaches.  This was in San Diego where <br/>
I had never, in 27 years, lived anywhere that wasn&#39;t shared by the big brown <br/>
roaches.  The mice never got into our food supply so my conclusion was that <br/>
they feasted on any roaches they could find.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Needless to say we now have a week old baby goat living in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; house....unsanitary...yeah...learning experience definitely!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow! Cool! Thats me.....<br/>
&gt; We once had a duckling that my son actually raised from an egg.<br/>
&gt; Dougal.  Dougal lived in the house, swam in the bath while eating<br/>
&gt; worms.  He thought my son was his mother and would quack wildly when<br/>
&gt; *mother* disappeared!!  As the duck grew, my son and his brothers and<br/>
&gt; friends would run around the garden wildly flapping their arms<br/>
&gt; teachimg dougal how to fly...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I did a quizz the other week.  One question was favourite smell.  My<br/>
&gt; answere *manure* (not inside though) A good old country smell!!<br/>

Roaches tend to need public water systems to travel  (especially the big <br/>
black ones).  When I lived rurally with individual wells and septic tanks  <br/>
(most of my life) there were zero roaches.  In any city with a water and <br/>
sewer system, I&#39;ve seen roaches.<br/>

No, you&#39;re okay---<br/>
<br/>
Not IN the water, but in the spaces around the pipes, in the tunnels, between <br/>
pipes.  Manholes.  <br/>
<br/>
Not all cities, but Albuquerque.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s gross, and I temped for the city once coordinating something related, <br/>
being a dispatcher for the full-time anti-cockroach brigade, which is why I <br/>
know more than I wish I knew!!<br/>
<br/>
I think in some big, old apartment buildings they just live in the buildings. <br/>
 I&#39;ve always lived in detached houses and usually had cats.<br/>

spot them outside but not in the house.  Our pet rats thought roaches were <br/>
candy so I&#39;m guessing it was the mice.<br/>
