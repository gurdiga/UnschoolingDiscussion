<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197477025">Hey there --<br/>
<br/>
We have an unschooling mom in our community who is involved in an ugly custody dispute.  When she and her husband were together, he was supportive of unschooling, but now he is using it as a weapon against her.  The court has had three psychiatrists come in (three!!) and examine her fitness as a parent, and all have agreed that the father (even though he is an alcoholic) would offer a more structured, positive environment for the children.<br/>
<br/>
They are, btw, 11 yo twins, and one isn&#39;t reading yet.<br/>
<br/>
What I am asking for here (aside from advice if anyone has it) are the names of some unschooling experts who we could contact to perhaps write letters outlining the legitimacy of this form of education, so as to offer the judge some point of reference.  Apparently, they are equating unschooling with neglect.<br/>
<br/>
I thought of you, Sandra, but I can&#39;t bring up the other names like Cafi and David -- no last names or e-mail addresses.  Can someone provide me with those?<br/>
<br/>
The community here is planning on starting a letter-writing campaign in support of this mom from a personal perspective, but some expert information about the benefits of unschooling might be very helpful as well.<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
Laura B.<br/>

The mom should just agree to put the kids in school to keep custody rather <br/>
than risk losing custody AND unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t as important as being with the kids.<br/>

I don&#39;t know what David you mean.<br/>

Tell her to bail the hell AWAY from unschooling to save her children from <br/>
living with an alcoholic who is angry with her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449478155">Laura, I have someone for you from Austin, Texas, who might be able  <br/>
to help a bit. Sending name and number offlist.<br/>
<br/>
But, I know others who have experienced this and the judge ordered  <br/>
the kids to go to school and insisted they go to the school the dad  <br/>
chose. If she wants to have control over where they end up, she might  <br/>
want to research schools right now and get them enrolled in, for  <br/>
example, a charter school that encourages more parent participation  <br/>
than most regular public schools.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a place to get information about all the charter schools in  <br/>
Texas:<br/>
