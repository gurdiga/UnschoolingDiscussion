<div id="ygrps-yiv-947389056">I just wanted to share this with the list because (I think) it&#39;s what unschooling is all about.  My dd (4) has gone to daycare and then preschool since she was 11 months.  This past year, I was started to stress because many of her friends could count farther than she could - many more could write their names and say their alphabets while she had absolutely NO interest.<br/>
<br/>
Then I found the concept of unschooling and this list.<br/>
<br/>
I reluctantly let go of my &quot;teacherness&quot; and just let her alone.  Over the weeks, she started borrowing my pens and asking how you make certain letters.  My husband and I would just describe their shapes (she never let us write it for her - very independent).  This morning I watched her write her name.  Misspelled?  Yup - a little.  But anyone could have figured it out.  I could just hardly belive it.  She&#39;s taught herself to write this summer! And more importantly, she LOVES to write.  She makes &quot;words&quot; everywhere (including the wall in the hall...with a Sharpie...ouch!).  Yesterday, she picked up the booklet from one of her computer games, announced it was her diary spent the day &quot;writing in her diary&quot;.  (I journal, which she&#39;s copying I&#39;m sure.)<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t this what it&#39;s all about?<br/>
