<div id="ygrps-yiv-297080370">**We got into unschooling accidentally and before we even knew there was<br/>
<br/>
a name for it.  So I can&#39;t say I went in to it with this goal in mind.<br/>
<br/>
But the most important thing for me has been helping them find out who<br/>
they are.**<br/>
<br/>
OK, Bridget beat me to it.<br/>
<br/>
The first answer that came into my mind was &quot;a sense of self&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m really happy that my son still appreciates affection.  He<br/>
still wants lots of hugs, and even hugs his friends -- in public.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good bet that schoolyard &quot;socializing&quot; would have quashed that.<br/>
