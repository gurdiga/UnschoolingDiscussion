I&#39;m damn sure that &#39;clean&#39; kids suffer in this way...  I also know <br/>
that kids need company (even when I don&#39;t feel like giving it, but <br/>
that&#39;s a different story...)  <br/>
<br/>
The mother of one of my sis&#39;s friends was a Health Visitor (kind-<br/>
of community nurse/social worker for young families, mostly...)  <br/>
She had some very different neighbourhoods on her &#39;patch.&#39;  One <br/>
was very posh, lots of money and space etc.  The parents of a <br/>
baby in this neighbourhood were worried.  The child was eating <br/>
enough (well, drinking, still on milk only) but not gaining weight, <br/>
not progressing, real &#39;failure-to-thrive.&#39;  This child would want for <br/>
nothing material, had the most beautifully decorated nursery, slept <br/>
in her cot, etc etc, the parents couldn&#39;t understand what was <br/>
wrong with her.  Also on this HV&#39;s round was a gypsy camp.  <br/>
There was a baby there about the same age, so the HV took the <br/>
rich parents to the gypsy camp to see ths other baby.  They found <br/>
this baby, sat on a pile of thrown-out furniture, mattresses and <br/>
stuff.  The kid was filthy, squalid, even.  But this child was so <br/>
healthy!  Why?  He had people around him, interacting with him, <br/>
and he wasn&#39;t living in a sterile nursery.  The other baby only had <br/>
contact with others when she needed feeding or changing, as soon <br/>
as the obvious things were done, she was left &#39;quiet&#39; in the <br/>
nursery.  Well, the rich people didn&#39;t start living like gypsies but <br/>
they did see that children need to play, and that muck won&#39;t break <br/>
them :-)<br/>
<br/>
True story, folks...<br/>
