&gt; Subject: the debate<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I meant to stay out of this debate going on with<br/>
&gt; Sandra and Robin and Collette and others, but I do<br/>
&gt; have something to say.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;If you&#39;re not angry, you&#39;re not paying attention.&quot;<br/>
&gt; John Irving<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Be happy while you&#39;re living, for you&#39;re a long time<br/>
&gt; dead.&quot; Scottish proverb<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I feel there&#39;s room in this world for people who are<br/>
&gt; &quot;paying attention&quot; and feel energized by trying to<br/>
&gt; right wrongs. And I feel there&#39;s room in this world<br/>
&gt; for people who find paying that much attention to be<br/>
&gt; too painful or joy-destroying or simply overwhelming.<br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s let Sandra choose to live her life embracing the<br/>
&gt; good she sees, but let&#39;s allow Robin and Collette to<br/>
&gt; use their anger about the many wrongs in the world to<br/>
&gt; improve it. I think it&#39;s important to accept different<br/>
&gt; tempraments in adults, too. Some of us are fighters<br/>
&gt; against injustice while others are nurturing and<br/>
&gt; serene. Live and let live.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
