<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700519325">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I guess you can call this a &quot;week in the life of an unschooling family&quot;.  I<br/>
am just gonna ramble a bit about what&#39;s been going on around here.  Maybe I<br/>
am feeling chatty, or maybe I just want to vent and cheer, etc.  Here we<br/>
go...<br/>
<br/>
Pool Parties.... The kids went to a pool party last thursday to celebrate a<br/>
friend&#39;s (Julia) 7th birthday.  The child&#39;s brilliant parents requested that<br/>
no one buy gifts but rather make a card or gift for their daughter, Julia.<br/>
My kids were VERY happy about this, cause they love to make things for<br/>
people.  We had made some &quot;ancient&quot; scrolls earlier in the week.  Max (my<br/>
8yo) made a name poem for julia and put it in a scroll.  Sam (my 11yo) made<br/>
a bead necklace and a basket out of rainbow colored craft sticks to hold the<br/>
scroll.   They had a wonderful time at the party and Julia loved the gifts.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby and I attended a pool party Saturday night.  It is held every year for<br/>
the adults in our community.  (we live in an apartment/townhome community,<br/>
my hubby works for the management company, he is the director of IS) There<br/>
is catered food (chinese this time, mmmm) and free beer and karaoke.  We got<br/>
to talk to lots of friends who we have not seen in ages! We got lots of<br/>
compliments on the kids, how they have grown, how well behaved they are, how<br/>
polite, inventive, etc.  My favorite part is watching the mostly &quot;stuffy,<br/>
all business types&quot; cut loose and dance and have fun.  Oh and swimming at<br/>
night is great, because I am a redhead with fair skin and burn within only<br/>
20 minutes in the sun.<br/>
<br/>
The next day there was a knock on the door, not unusual, kids are always<br/>
coming to ask Sam & Max to play.  But this time it was for me!?!?! hahaha A<br/>
lady who lives a few doors down came by to drop off some pics of our kids at<br/>
her daughter&#39;s birthday party from a few weeks ago.  She stayed and chatted<br/>
and we got along very well.  I also discovered that my dog, MOJO, is more<br/>
well behaved than I give him credit for hehehe. Anyway, after chatting a bit<br/>
about painting the house, we went down to her place so I could see the<br/>
painting she has done.  I was very inspired and have decided to paint our<br/>
home as well. After leaving there I was walking home and ran into some other<br/>
parents of my kids&#39; friends.  They asked about homeschooling.  We chatted a<br/>
while, the father is a musician, he offered to teach Sam how to play her<br/>
keyboard if she is interested. He showed me his studio where he makes his<br/>
music, I was in awe at all the neat equipment!  Oh and we also got invited<br/>
to goto the pool with another friend of ours.  We went for about an hour, I<br/>
got sunburned but it was fun playing ball in the pool.<br/>
<br/>
Monday, I got sick, very sick, coughing, sneezing, etc.  I was miserable!<br/>
Not to mention I was in so much pain (back problems, 2 degenrated discs).  I<br/>
did not sleep at all sunday night so monday I was in really bad shape.  The<br/>
kids were angels!  They very quietly played the computers (lego.com,<br/>
barbie.com, and other games, etc) I slept on and off while on the couch.<br/>
Hubby offered to stay home with me.  But one of his employees was on<br/>
vacation then another one called in sick so he had to goto the office. The<br/>
kids were good all day.  The lady down the street stops by to chat, had to<br/>
tell her I was really sick, didn&#39;t want to pass it to her baby.  She says<br/>
&quot;come over as soon as you are feeling better&quot;   (Good! I actually have a<br/>
social life now! hahaha)<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday, got a call I have been waiting for for 3 months.  Our insurance had<br/>
finally approved the IDET procedure for my back.  Scheduled it for the 15th,<br/>
but uh oh! I have a cold and if it is not gone by then I have to reschedule.<br/>
So I called my doc setup an appointment for Wed.  One of the nieghborhood<br/>
parents dropped off a bag full of books for Sam & Max.  Sam found an oragami<br/>
book and loves it.  She made me a candy dish for my desk, it is really cute!<br/>
Max & dh played alot of star wars on the Xbox. DH is coming down with my<br/>
cold now, we are both miserable.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday, DH called in sick, but worked from home. I goto the doctor.  He<br/>
says he promises I will be well in time for the IDET, puts me on<br/>
antibiotics. When I get home a good surprise in the mail, The Lord of the<br/>
Rings DVD has arrived (with a free t-shirt).  The kids scream with joy.  We<br/>
all sit down to watch it again (saw it in theatres). I absolutely LOVE this<br/>
movie, we all do. DH is feeling very bad, we are both so sick, can hardly<br/>
move.  Max caught a praying mantis in the backyard.  He put it in his bug<br/>
collector kit. He is very excited!<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, DH leaves for work, within 1 hour he is back home (sick still),<br/>
looks terribly ill.  He spends the day on the phone and computer, trying to<br/>
catch up on missed work.  I spend the morning catching up on emails.  The<br/>
kids were watching Lord of the Rings for the 3rd time.  We talk about the<br/>
movie and the books.  We watch the special features (making of).  My parents<br/>
call and say they are coming down next week.  Going to get a hotel room with<br/>
a pool and keep the kids for a couple of days after my back treatment.  I am<br/>
really happy because I don&#39;t like for the kids to see me suffering in pain,<br/>
it worries them needlessly.  My cold symptoms are fading a little.  DH is<br/>
still miserable.  We order pizza for dinner, no one feels like cooking.  We<br/>
had a long family discussion about unschooling.  The kids didn&#39;t understand<br/>
why we were not doing school-at-home anymore, the asked lots of questions.<br/>
They seemed satisfied with the answers we gave.  Max had me help him find<br/>
info about what to feed his praying manits.  We viewed a video about flying<br/>
snakes too.<br/>
<br/>
Here it is Friday.  DH returned to work this am, he is still sick but<br/>
getting better slowly.<br/>
In some respects it has been a miserable week.  But some really good things<br/>
happened this week.  There is yet another pool party for all the kids in the<br/>
neighbohood tonight.  Sam & Max don&#39;t want to go tho.  I am not really sure<br/>
why, they just decided not to. They have lots of friends here, but some of<br/>
the other kids are bullies, especially at the pool and park.  I think this<br/>
worries the kids.  They don&#39;t like trouble and they tend to come racing home<br/>
at this slightest hint of problems with other kids.  I think this is good.<br/>
I can trust them.<br/>
<br/>
Well I have rambled long enough and if you are still reading and still<br/>
awake, thanks for listening!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173789709">I almost forgot!!!!<br/>
One more wonderful miraculous thing happened this week!<br/>
We were watching TV, a movie I think (something we had not seen before).  There was a point when the TV screen faded and the words &quot;One year Later&quot; popped up.  <br/>
Max (our loving little 8yo non-reading son) says &quot;One year later..&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
DH and I both smiled so big! <br/>
<br/>
I said (as calmly as I could) &quot;Max that was really great&quot; <br/>
<br/>
and he says &quot;What?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;You read that, &#39;one year later&#39;,&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
He smiles and says &quot;wow I guess I did read it...hmmm I CAN read, can&#39;t I?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And I say proudly &quot;Yes, Max, you can read&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a beautiful moment.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175793602">Zan, thanks for sharing your week! I enjoyed the glimpse into your sweet <br/>
family. You need to hear about Echinacea! It&#39;s an extract from Purple cone <br/>
flower.  It boosts your immune system so the length of your sickness is half <br/>
as long.  DeWes<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312426425">Hi!<br/>
Thanks for the advice.  Where could I find Echinacea?<br/>
In a health food store maybe?<br/>
I don&#39;t know much about the benefits of herbs and such.<br/>
I really should look into it more tho.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327026212">Hi Zan! Yep in a health food store. But lately the regular grocery stores are <br/>
stocking health alternatives so maybe in the vitamin section of the grocery. <br/>
I get it at the health food store in a tinture form. But it does come in <br/>
regular pill form.  Good luck! DeWes<br/>

books on teh subject or a local health food store.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817780239">I agree totally.  I&#39;ve spent the last hour or so now looking at info on the<br/>
web about Echinacea.  We do have a whole foods market near here and plan to<br/>
check it out. I also have a dear friend (far away in Boston) that is much<br/>
more knowledgable about these things than I am and I plan on consulting with<br/>
her.<br/>
Years ago, when I was a child I suffered from allergies (mold, dust, pet<br/>
hair, etc) My parents had heard somewhere that golden seal root would help<br/>
me.  After taking it for a while I was able to stop getting weekly allergy<br/>
shots from the doctor and my nosebleeds stopped.  So I know there is truth<br/>
to the knowledge, now just to decipher it all :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input!<br/>
