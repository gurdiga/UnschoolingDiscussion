<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509934473">I have an ant farm, that I would like to set up - I would like to find our own ants. Has anyone else done this before - and have any tips. I read that in order for the worker ants to feel like this is a real colony there needs to be a queen. I can find lots of ants - but have yet to find  the queen. Any ideas - or experiece would be great!<br/>
