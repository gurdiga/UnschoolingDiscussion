 </span></blockquote>In the spring, Eric (10) was interested in the Revolutionary War. The A&E <br/>
video &quot;The Crossing&quot; (George Washington crossing the Delaware) inspired him. <br/>
He wanted to feel what it would be like to be a colonial soldier, so he read <br/>
about a soldier&#39;s life. Then he built his camp (including campfire), stole <br/>
bacon from a &quot;local farmer&quot; to cook over his fire, fought the Redcoats, and <br/>
survived multiple musket wounds. He chronicled his days in a journal using a <br/>
calligraphy pen (his version of a quill pen). Eric had so much fun. <br/>
<br/>
I guess the point of my telling you this is maybe creating his own version of <br/>
events. Use some of the other great ideas (videos, books, field trips) to <br/>
help figure out what he&#39;d like to recreate.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun,<br/>
