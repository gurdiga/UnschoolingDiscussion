&lt;&lt; I am sure<br/>
they will love, it even ties right into what we are doing, etc.  And they<br/>
respond this way, I keep asking myself &quot;I thought they were interested in<br/>
this?  Why are they so blaza?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i think we expect or would prefer if our children showed picture perfect <br/>
enthusiasm for things, but this is really just our need, it is not necc. for <br/>
them to learn.  i think we expect them to act like perfect little adult <br/>
people.  meaning, if they like it we expect them to know how to show it in a <br/>
way that satisfies us.  which is a skill that many of us dont learn til we <br/>
are adults and others never learn.  like if i am given a present that i <br/>
really like, i see the giver later and am distracted and forget to even <br/>
mention it!  i have to make a conscious effort to express my feedback in away <br/>
that lets a person know how i felt, what specifically i liked, etc. because i <br/>
want them to know!  (mature skill!)  or if i hear a song at church that <br/>
really touches me, i might respond by telling others or by finding the <br/>
musician immediately and thanking him for his part OR i might wait 6 mos <br/>
before i say out loud to someone, do you remember the time we heard that <br/>
beautiful song or i may never say anything but it has become a part of me <br/>
somehow enhancing my life in untangible ways...<br/>
