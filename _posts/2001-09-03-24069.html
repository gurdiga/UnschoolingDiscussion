<div id="ygrps-yiv-540722407">About the elder homes...<br/>
<br/>
We have tried it once in the past, and I feel for my kids, it really was not a good idea.  They are both very sensitive people and the smell, coupled with senile old folks yelling gibberish, being wheeled around in wheel chairs with air breathing canisters etc.  I fear, painted a very bleak picture of growing old.  <br/>
<br/>
This was MY idea mind you- &quot;so they can have some interaction with old people, help the community...&quot;  ANYWAY- &quot;helping&quot; is a good idea- a really good one if *they* think of how they want to &quot;help&quot;.  The best, me thinks, is to model volunteering myself- not because I want to &quot;get my kids to help society&quot; but because I really have the time, energy, capacity and desire to do so.  Seems like people who have been writing about their successful volunteering are really enjoying it together- (socializing the kitties!- so sweet- and necessary!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess what I am trying to say is (in my experience, anyway) that maybe going to the old folks home is sort of a &quot;touchy&quot; thing...and it would be best done as an outgrowth of an interest someone really has- not so much &#39;cause a mom thinks it would be good.   <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would mention that.<br/>

<br/>
oh yeah!  There was a appartment complex like that in our old little town!  There was a public park right next to it and we would often strike up convos with the people that lived there- they also had a gift shop where you could buy all these neat crafts the seniors had made- I got a doll bunk bed all hand made- for like 15 bucks.  MUCH different situation- very enjoyable!- not &quot;touchy&quot;..more of a situation where you could find mentors for your interests.<br/>
<br/>
Oh gosh- it reminds me of the story, um...illustrated by Julie Vivas..um, just a sec..<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wilfrid Gordon MacDonald Partridge&quot; by Mem Fox<br/>
<br/>
FABULOUS book- about a child &quot;Wilfrid&quot; who lives next door to an old folks home and is good friends with them all- but especially one certain lady who is the oldest one there.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

My mother is elderly and aging poorly.  The last 4 weeks have been very hard for us...first we moved her into an assisted living facility at her request.  She loves it there (has her own apt, great food in lovely dining room, lots of new friends and things to do, no cooking or cleaning etc).  Two weeks ago she fell and broke several ribs and has been in the hospital since.  She is being moved to a nursing home tomorrow for aprx 2 weeks until she gets her strength back and to do extra therapy.  My kids go with me almost every day.  They even went into ICU for a moment even though they weren&#39;t allowed (I couldn&#39;t wait any longer for info and could not leave them in the visitors area).  They do moan and groan sometimes when we are going but I think that is mostly because the drive to her is about and hour and a half, so it ruins our day.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that you expose your kids to old folks.  They are all so different, they all age differently.  And they do have a great deal to offer, if asked.  My 4yo is still quite a shy child with strangers but will give out hugs quite often because she understands how old folks rarely get to see or hug a beautiful child, and it makes them feel good.<br/>
<br/>
A recommendation for reading, depending on the ages of your children; Five O&#39;Clock Charlie by Margaurite Henry.  We have an old illustrated copy that both my 4 yog and 9yob love to hear.  Charlie is put out to pasture and doesn&#39;t feel useful anymore, but finds a way to be useful and loved.  <br/>
<br/>
In trying to decide where to go for visits, keep in mind that both your children and the elderly they are visiting will get so much more out of visits if they are one-on-one.  Give the old person and the child time to actually talk to one another and make a connection.  Maybe teach each other things.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and great job!<br/>

My two oldest children, 6 and 7 years old, are far from shy. I&#39;ve never been <br/>
one to tell them not to talk to strangers. I actually encourage it. From this <br/>
they are comfortable with their instincts as to whether people are &quot;safe&quot; or <br/>
not. They have very little problem walking up to a stranger and spark up a <br/>
conversation that&#39;ll last for hours. My baby can be a bit on the shy side, <br/>
but she warms up quickly for the most part. I would be really suprised if <br/>
either of my kids ended up not enjoying the visits as they are both great <br/>
conversationalists. I&#39;m looking forward to starting. I think I&#39;ve found the <br/>
perfect place. It&#39;s hard right now as we&#39;re going to be moving in a few <br/>
months. I want to make sure that we don&#39;t start visiting somewhere that&#39;ll <br/>
end up being way too far for us to travel to later on. I&#39;m debating waiting <br/>
until after we move before starting. I&#39;m anxious to get started though. LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086022707">Oh, I was going to go to more of the elderly communities where they have <br/>
apartments and all rather then what you&#39;re describing. When I was 10-12 years <br/>
old every weekend we visited my grandfather who had alzheimers and parkinsens <br/>
(sp??) and I remember how scared I would get at times not understanding why <br/>
some of the people were talking to themselves, yelling at an unseen person, <br/>
etc. Just wanted to clarify what I ment by elderly home. <br/>
