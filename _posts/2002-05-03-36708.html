<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885851132">I just thought I would share one of the experiences of our day today - where when I looked back I thought - Wow - this unschooling thing is working! And not only that - but to my children everything is interesting - and they are not intimidated by many things - except my daughter and her hand writing :) - but she is improving in her acceptance of her own imperfection...<br/>
<br/>
We live in a very rural area - and coming home from the dump ( where we talked about ecology - and recycling and what things come from our recycled milk cartons)- there were two surveyors at the end of our driveway. One of them was trying to put a post in the woods - and was having a hard time with a rock. My 4-year old ran to get his shovel to &quot;help&quot;. My 7 dd got right into talking to the other man about what he was doing - do you do this everyday? Do you like it? Did you go to college... What does that machine do..etc...  I was very impressed with the response of the surveyors. So many adults treat children as a nuisence. I can&#39;t help but worry that my children were bothering these men and hindering their work. But they were very open to having them there watching - asking a zillion questions and digging up rocks.They even moved the tripod thing down so they could all look through it. <br/>
<br/>
I also found it wonderful that my children had no intimidation in going up to the men and asking all the questions - and expecting a real answer. Not a watered down for children answer.  In the case of my 4 yr old- and the shovel I am continually amazed that he is confident enough to feel that he really helps - and in fact there are many times when he really does. <br/>
<br/>
I have had other experiences with my kids where I have seen an ability to feel comfortable around adults - and want to learn from them - and not view adults as someone who is beyond them. I really think this has a lot to do with unschooling. I just read Instead of Education by John Holt - and I think I better understand the idea of how we all naturally want to learn from those who have something worthwhile to share. They are not &quot;teaching&quot; us math because they are a math teacher - they are sharing something that they enjoy doing - and have a talent in. ( Not to say math teachers don&#39;t enjoy what they are doing etc.) This doesn&#39;t work if the &quot;teacher&quot; has control over you via grades, tests etc. It only works when the student can simply say no thanks - and move on and have there be no punitive consequences....<br/>
<br/>
I have been unschooling since Decemeber and I have had my moments of struggle - stressing about the Saxon math book that won&#39;t be &quot;done&quot; this year as some sort of &quot;proof&quot; that my daughter learned something...worrying that she won&#39;t progress... (her spelling and handwriting have gone downhill) - and it&#39;s hard not to think - she&#39;s going to regress if I don&#39;t &quot;do school&quot;. I keep reading this list - and gleaning from it encourgement in some of your stories... and philosophies - and have been keeping a journal - as was suggested in the beginning. It really is wonderful what we all learn - through life :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410756016">Hi!!  I just joined this list because I&#39;m intrigued with the idea of<br/>
unschooling.  I&#39;ve been homeschooling for about 15 years. Each year it<br/>
seems that I get more and more relaxed.  However, I don&#39;t see the progress<br/>
in reading nor skills in writing in my elementary aged children that I saw<br/>
in my teenagers at the same age, since I&#39;ve &quot;relaxed&quot;.  My first two<br/>
entered college at 15 and I just can&#39;t see that happening with the<br/>
&quot;relaxed&quot; mindset.  My 16yod is not near the level as my 17yob and 18yog in<br/>
academia or maturity.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing your responses...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;since I&#39;ve &quot;relaxed&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  AHHHH- the joys of UNSCHOOLING!!!  Are you enjoying homeschool more since you *relaxed*?  I&#39;ll bet your kids are!  I&#39;ll bet you spent a lot of stressful years getting your first 2 into college at 15.!! <br/>
<br/>
  Who in the world ever decided that all children should learn all the same things at exactly the same age in exactly the same way????  It has taken me a while to realize that academics are NOT the only thing we&#39;re teaching here. We&#39;re learning from each other daily.  This is LIFE!!!  <br/>
  Unschooling allows us to ENJOY life and each other without having to cram a lot of *knowledge* into the kids that they are not going to retain anyway. <br/>
  Unschooling scared me a bit when we first started it,  I think that is because we are conditioned to think that SCHOOL is a standard method set down by the Public School system and that we MUST adhere to that or we&#39;re doing it all wrong and our kids will suffer. <br/>
  I KNOW, without a doubt, my son learns better with the relaxed unschooling method than any other way we&#39;ve tried.  Including public school<br/>
  Don&#39;t worry too much.  They all march to the beat of their own drummer, you know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701228455">&lt;&lt; Has anyone<br/>
else had a child this interested in the realities in the world at such a<br/>
yound age?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes I have a 4 year old boy. He has been the same way since he was about 2.5. He has always loved books and movies way ahead of his age... He loves bugs of all kind, dinosaurs, tornadoes, and lately insects. He is also very knowledgeable in these areas. For instance just today he saw a spider web with a very interesting spider sitting in the middle of it. I commented that I thought this spider had made a wonderful web, and said I wonder what kind of spider it is. He told me that the spider has made her web and is now waiting for food. He told me what she would do with her food, in great detail. He then suggested that we forget about our walk and go inside to get his &quot;Insect&quot; book to find her, so we can know what kind she is. So we turned around and went inside. He then got his book, plopped down on the floor, and found her. So after we read about her we went back outside to see how she was doing. He is also starting to read... (I am doing nothing at all to teach him). He regularly tells me what a word is. And he is always correct. Just the other day we went to Wal Mart, which was recently &quot;upgraded&quot; into a Super Wal Mart. We were looking for the pet department, so we took the handy map, of course he needed one too. After just a few seconds he comes to me with his map, and shows me where the &quot;Pet&quot; department is located. He is reading all on his own. <br/>

There are some WONDERFUL pop-up books in the world today which are not <br/>
child-level information, and if you have a child who can take care of them, <br/>
they can last from 3.5 to adult.  We have a dozen which have been around for <br/>
many years--one on water (adult-level information in the text), one on music <br/>
(instruments, and the physics of music), one on Egypt, one &quot;just art&quot; (not <br/>
really, but seems so to kids) which is dragons by Greg Hildebrandt; two <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434451243">Actually, getting the first two to college was something they wanted to do.<br/>
 They were ready and mature enough to handle it so I said go for it.  My<br/>
next teen is not inclined that way so I&#39;m not pushing her at all.  I am<br/>
concerned that she is a terrible speller and doesn&#39;t seem to be getting<br/>
better.  If you want to be able to communicate your ideas, you really need<br/>
to know how to write and spell...I just don&#39;t see that coming to her at all.<br/>

How many of you have unschooled through high school?  I&#39;d like to know how<br/>
you got across the higher maths and sciences...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705698011">I did the school at home thing with my oldest and tried to &quot;teach&quot; him how<br/>
to read. How frustrating for both of us and to this day he will rarely pick<br/>
up a book and exhibits anxiety when in a situation where he reads something<br/>
aloud in front of others. I was much more relaxed with my daughter but she<br/>
did ask me to sit with her and show her how to read. My youngest I left<br/>
completely alone. He learned how to read because he used to &quot;chat&quot; with<br/>
friends and family via the Internet. He was about five or so at the time and<br/>
what he would do is have the person on the phone at the same time so they<br/>
could tell him what they were saying. He got tired of this eventually and<br/>
decided it would be easier if he just learned how to do it himself. He&#39;s an<br/>
awesome reader by the way. They all are but he is never stressed about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087026144">I&#39;m another newbie..although I originally signed on awhile back and left due<br/>
to...well, anyway here&#39;s my question...<br/>
<br/>
My 3.5 yr old, Shawn, seems to be only really interested in factual books<br/>
and videos. How &quot;normal&quot; is this? When we go to the library he picks books<br/>
that are way advanced--which mom and dad have to read--like the Big Book of<br/>
Bones, and Eyewitness book on Volcanoes and Earthquakes! The videos are the<br/>
same thing..all about volcanoes, spaceships,animals, mummies, etc. etc. His<br/>
interests seem oddly diverse for only having been around 3 yrs!!! Has anyone<br/>
else had a child this interested in the realities in the world at such a<br/>
yound age?? <br/>
<br/>
The other day when we were at the dr and waiting he played doctor with me<br/>
telling me I had low blood pressure, a fever, and a stuffy nose. When I<br/>
asked him what medicine I needed he told me, clear as day, &quot;ibuprofen&quot; :) <br/>
How precious is that???<br/>

it&#39;s hard to say with him. It might actually be interesting to have <br/>
cable for a while and see what his taste in shows does.  I bet he <br/>
would watch a lot of Discover and things like that.  Too bad we can&#39;t <br/>
afford it right now.  And I&#39;m not sure I would keep it if we got it.  <br/>
I have problems with it sometimes too, exptra temptation is NOT what I <br/>
need right now.<br/>
<br/>
But anyhow, since I figured out Wyndham&#39;s taste in books, I&#39;ve asked <br/>
around a lot.  It seems very common in boys and less common but not <br/>
non-existent in girls.  As long as he&#39;s happy, go with the flow!<br/>

they went to my mom and she helped them with it until they got tiredof <br/>

<br/>
Maybe it hasn&#39;t been important to her because she hasn&#39;t had a personal need<br/>
to communicate something to someone else through writing?<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s also quite possible she missed the spelling gene. Some people --<br/>
people who were &quot;taught&quot; to spell in school -- can&#39;t. They find spell<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, I don&#39;t see the progress<br/>
&gt; in reading nor skills in writing in my elementary aged children that I saw<br/>
&gt; in my teenagers at the same age, since I&#39;ve &quot;relaxed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there an advantage to an elementary aged child to be able to read or<br/>
write well?<br/>
<br/>
One of the (many) reasons school doesn&#39;t work so well is the over emphasis<br/>
on -- that borders on worship of -- learning through reading. Schools need<br/>
the kids lined up neatly, learning the same thing in the same way at the<br/>
same time so they can all be uniformly tested. Schools depend on learning<br/>
through reading because it&#39;s *convenient* for *schools* not because it&#39;s the<br/>
finest method for kids. And for some kids, depending on their learning<br/>
style, learning in other ways is far superior. If they&#39;re not reading,<br/>
they&#39;re not learning is far from the truth.<br/>
<br/>
And schools get us so scared about writing, making us believe it&#39;s an<br/>
impossible task and kids need to start learning as early as possible. But<br/>
that&#39;s only true when kids are forced to write when they have nothing to say<br/>
and no reason to say it. Writing is just translating thoughts into written<br/>
words to transfer them to someone else&#39;s head. It&#39;s just talking on paper.<br/>
It&#39;s generally more formal than talking, even at it&#39;s most informal, but<br/>
people use various levels of formality in speaking depending on who they are<br/>
talking to so writing isn&#39;t much different.<br/>
<br/>
If kids are taught that writing is hard through boring, personally<br/>
meaningless exercises then it becomes hard. If they have no experience with<br/>
writing being hard, then it&#39;s as natural as anything else. (And some will be<br/>
better at it than others, of course.) But the less negative experience they<br/>
have, the easier it will be for them to figure out what they need to get<br/>
their point across.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My first two<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well Pam Sorooshian (who will undoubtedly be along at some point) has 2<br/>
taking community college courses at 14 and 17 (I believe).<br/>
<br/>
But what&#39;s the rush? What great enhancement to their joy in life will they<br/>
have if they enter college at 15 instead of 18 (or 20 or 25)? Is it a<br/>
competition to get as many work years in as possible before retirement ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Or might there be an advantage to exploring interests to discover the things<br/>
that make them want to jump out of bed in the morning? So when the get to<br/>
college (or whatever route(s) they end up taking) they won&#39;t be following in<br/>
the footsteps of countless schooled kids who go to college just because<br/>
that&#39;s the next step after high school. And who then get a &quot;good&quot; job<br/>
because that&#39;s the next step after college.<br/>

No.<br/>
Not that I couldn&#39;t but it probably wouldn&#39;t help, because books like that <br/>
don&#39;t stay in print longterm.  Ours are all at least eight years old.   But <br/>
if you go to any big bookstores and ask (or check the remainder tables) you <br/>
might find some.  <br/>

pop-up books older<br/>

Check this:  -=-the first movable part books were produced as early as the <br/>
13th century and were used to illustrate philosophical and scientific theories<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
So they weren&#39;t originally for kids.<br/>
<br/>
Besides what&#39;s to be learned from the texts of them, though, just the <br/>
technology of the stand-up or moving parts is paper engineering!  There are <br/>
pop-up and moving greeting cards (we&#39;ve collected several here, and all of <br/>
the kids have at least two) and I have a Russian book which is SORT of a <br/>
pop-up.  It&#39;s about explorers, and all in Russian, and each two-page opening <br/>
creates a little diorama with a frame.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looking up pop-up books science at google.com  brought lots of stuff, but <br/>
here&#39;s a good one:<br/>

My 9 yos does not really like books that much at all, right now.<br/>
He rarely looks at facts books, and he will *sometimes* pick up a very easy<br/>
reader, if he&#39;s in the mood.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t like to be read to, fact or fiction.<br/>
But he LOVES computer games, and I know he&#39;s learning how to read because of<br/>
those games. He also likes to watch movies and TV shows - those do hold his<br/>
interest.<br/>
And although I&#39;m a little disappointed with his lack of enthusiasm for<br/>
books, I accept that about him and encourage other methods that he chooses<br/>
to learn about things. He is a &quot;doer&quot;, and likes doing things.<br/>

I understand that completely!  <br/>
<br/>
I like some stories, but generally when I finish reading a short story or a <br/>
novel, I look around and wish I had that time back to do something better.  <br/>
(Not always, but the fiction books I liked so much I would read them again <br/>
have been fewer than two dozen in a lifetime.)<br/>

I do like fairy tales, but partly for their being artifacts of earlier <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426845587">I think his interests are great. My 4 yr. ds has a thing for anything construction or mechanical and most of the books he chooses from the library are non-fiction as well. my husband and I laugh about the fact that a friend had loaned him a book on small engine repair and that was Chase&#39;s chosen &quot;bedtime story&quot; for the longest time. Glad Dad was the one asked to read it - :)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m another newbie..although I originally signed on awhile back and left due<br/>
  to...well, anyway here&#39;s my question... <br/>
<br/>
  My 3.5 yr old, Shawn, seems to be only really interested in factual books<br/>
  and videos. How &quot;normal&quot; is this? When we go to the library he picks books<br/>
  that are way advanced--which mom and dad have to read--like the Big Book of<br/>
  Bones, and Eyewitness book on Volcanoes and Earthquakes! The videos are the<br/>
  same thing..all about volcanoes, spaceships,animals, mummies, etc. etc. His<br/>
  interests seem oddly diverse for only having been around 3 yrs!!! Has anyone<br/>
  else had a child this interested in the realities in the world at such a<br/>
  yound age?? <br/>
<br/>
  The other day when we were at the dr and waiting he played doctor with me<br/>
  telling me I had low blood pressure, a fever, and a stuffy nose. When I<br/>
  asked him what medicine I needed he told me, clear as day, &quot;ibuprofen&quot; :) <br/>
  How precious is that??? <br/>
<br/>
  Beth--mom to 2 precious kids<br/>

I thought I&#39;d share this with you. My daughter, Jennifer, has also struggled with spelling. She wanted to spell well, (her sister spells really well). So we started playing games... Boggle, Hangman, and so on. Another game that was recommended to me is Quiddler, I am going to be getting that as soon as I can find it. She has made such improvement. I try to encourage her. We always try to point out that spelling will come in time, when she needs it most. We also try to encourage her to focus on things she is good at. That helps with her self esteem. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps,<br/>

If her self esteem could be good even though she&#39;s not a good speller, that <br/>
would be even better.<br/>
<br/>
If she can be told calmly and supportively that some people don&#39;t learn to <br/>
spell well until they&#39;re grown (my husband, in his late 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s has <br/>
become a good speller), and that there ARE spell checkers, and that typists <br/>
will proofread for you, and that happiness is not dependent on spelling, it <br/>
would put less pressure on her, and it would be the absolute truth.<br/>

&gt;&gt; However, I don&#39;t see the progress<br/>
&gt;&gt; in reading nor skills in writing in my elementary aged children that I saw<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there an advantage to an elementary aged child to be able to read or<br/>
&gt; write well?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes there is. If they want to pursue things that are of interest to them,<br/>
they need to be able to research and find out things about them on their<br/>
own.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s beneficial for me to read everything to them. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the (many) reasons school doesn&#39;t work so well is the over emphasis<br/>
&gt; on -- that borders on worship of -- learning through reading. Schools need<br/>
&gt; the kids lined up neatly, learning the same thing in the same way at the<br/>
&gt; same time so they can all be uniformly tested. Schools depend on learning<br/>
&gt; through reading because it&#39;s *convenient* for *schools* not because it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; finest method for kids. And for some kids, depending on their learning<br/>
&gt; style, learning in other ways is far superior. If they&#39;re not reading,<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re not learning is far from the truth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And schools get us so scared about writing, making us believe it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; impossible task and kids need to start learning as early as possible. But<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s only true when kids are forced to write when they have nothing to say<br/>
&gt; and no reason to say it. Writing is just translating thoughts into written<br/>
&gt; words to transfer them to someone else&#39;s head. It&#39;s just talking on paper.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s generally more formal than talking, even at it&#39;s most informal, but<br/>
&gt; people use various levels of formality in speaking depending on who they are<br/>
&gt; talking to so writing isn&#39;t much different.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If kids are taught that writing is hard through boring, personally<br/>
&gt; meaningless exercises then it becomes hard. If they have no experience with<br/>
&gt; writing being hard, then it&#39;s as natural as anything else. (And some will be<br/>
&gt; better at it than others, of course.) But the less negative experience they<br/>
&gt; have, the easier it will be for them to figure out what they need to get<br/>
&gt; their point across.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can assure you that we are far from &quot;worshipping&quot; academia.  They do<br/>
however need to be able to find things out for themselves.  I don&#39;t see<br/>
negative experiences as being necessarily bad.  I personally have grown<br/>
through negative experiences and have seen my children do the same.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; My first two<br/>
&gt;&gt; entered college at 15 and I just can&#39;t see that happening with the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; mindset.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well Pam Sorooshian (who will undoubtedly be along at some point) has 2<br/>
&gt; taking community college courses at 14 and 17 (I believe).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But what&#39;s the rush? What great enhancement to their joy in life will they<br/>
&gt; have if they enter college at 15 instead of 18 (or 20 or 25)? Is it a<br/>
&gt; competition to get as many work years in as possible before retirement ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I said in an earlier post, they chose to do this and I didn&#39;t stand in<br/>
their way.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Or might there be an advantage to exploring interests to discover the things<br/>
&gt; that make them want to jump out of bed in the morning? So when the get to<br/>
&gt; college (or whatever route(s) they end up taking) they won&#39;t be following in<br/>
&gt; the footsteps of countless schooled kids who go to college just because<br/>
&gt;&quot;&quot; job<br/>
&gt; because that&#39;s the next step after college.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually there&#39;s nothing wrong with continuing your education....especially<br/>
in areas that you&#39;re interested in.  And as I&#39;ve stated in another post,<br/>
they both have already been in the work force since they&#39;ve been 15.<br/>
