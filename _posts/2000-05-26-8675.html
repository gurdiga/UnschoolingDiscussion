<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154948795">Ok Karen and all,<br/>
So I need some help here.  My little one and I are battling thrush and need <br/>
to avoid sugar, but almost everything that I eat either has sugar or turns <br/>
into sugar (i.e. love pasta)  my little one does not do well with me eating <br/>
lots of wheat or dairy, cut out the sugar, starches (turning to sugar) <br/>
and....I am at a loss...Someone help!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523746892">Julie, Dr Atkins has a yeast free diet to combat  this.  Until the yeast <br/>
problem is solved do not eat or drink:  alcoholic drinks, b-b-q sauce, bread <br/>
or hamb. buns, buttermilk, cake, cashews, catsup, cheeses--except fresh, <br/>
chili peppers, citric acid, dry roasted nuts, fruit-esp. dried and cured, <br/>
horseradish, mayonnaise, malted products, milk, mincemeat, mushrooms, pastry, <br/>
peanuts,pickles, pistachios,pretzels, rolls, root beer, sauerkraut, smoked <br/>
foods, sour cream, soy sauce, sugars of any type, tomato sauce, vitamins in a <br/>
yeast base.    I think thin pastas like angel hair and vermicelli are ok, <br/>
just avoid lg shaped noodles.    Good luck!                                     <br/>

good for thrush, as well as just doing it for health reasons. Foods with fat 
should be excluded as well (keep in mind that olive oil-cold pressed and not 
heated by cooking helps to inhibit the growth of yeast. Acidophilus helps to get 
rid of fungus in the body, and a good amount of garlic will help to fight the 
yeast. Sometimes garlic can cause colic in really young babies.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337653678">There are lots of hams out there that don&#39;t have sugar or nitrites/trates<br/>
in them.  You can get salt cured, brine cured, dry cured and any of those<br/>
smoked.  A salt cured or dry cured ham uses plain old salt (not the<br/>
nitrite/trate/saltpeter stuff).  Proscuitto is one of the more well known<br/>
dry-cured hams.  You can order the old-fashioned salt cured hams both<br/>
smoked and unsmoked from several outlets back east.  Quite a few of the<br/>
organic food outfits are now carrying the old-fashioned type hams, also.<br/>

Hi, just joined your list here.  And am enjoying the &quot;food&quot; talk.  Not sure <br/>
how it started but I will add my two cents: We love sprouting raw peanuts in <br/>
a jar.  We eat them when they are about an inch long.  Great nut protein, <br/>
refreshing greens, and science to boot.  We also do alfalfa sprouts and bean <br/>
sprouts--but peanuts are *my* favorite.<br/>

Unshelled, raw and organic is how we do it.  Empty, clean, plastic peanut <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599683171">We use the plain soy milk (refrigerated kind, not the stuff sitting on<br/>
shelves) for cooking and making &quot;milkshakes.&quot;  For plain drinking, I just<br/>
add a &quot;pinch&quot; of vanilla and it seems to mask the soy flavor.  We do use<br/>
honey a lot (kidlets love it in the &quot;milk&quot;) and don&#39;t seem to have the same<br/>
problems with natural locally &quot;grown&quot; organic honey that we have with<br/>
refined sugars.  In fact, it was recommended to help the kidlets with<br/>
allergies and seems to be doing the trick.<br/>
<br/>
I have multiple &quot;environmental&quot; allergies and various and sundry other<br/>
problems (hypoglycemia, IBS and the list goes on) and we started getting<br/>
rid of all the garbage including aluminum pans and plastics from the<br/>
kitchen.  It has made a world of difference.  I find I can even tollerate<br/>
the occasional white bread if it is homemade with all organic ingredients.<br/>

I would love to hear more about allergies.  I think my little one has some <br/>
intolerance&#39;s to dairy and wheat, but I have not been about to put my finger <br/>
on what it is.  He gets really gassy and had the &quot;target&quot; on his bottom.  I <br/>
have been battling with this for the whole year of his little life.  My diet <br/>
has included tons of both, plus white pastas and bread of these before he was <br/>
born.<br/>
<br/>
I was raised on fried everything, so I at least have  more of variety in my <br/>
diet, now<br/>

had some all along?  Yes, I agree about the aluminum--  it has been linked to <br/>
Alzheimer&#39;s.  Also, have you tossed out teflon coated cookware?    I am leery <br/>
of plastics, too... Do you keep everything  (like left-overs) in glass <br/>
containers?  How have your symptoms improved by removing these <br/>
things--anything specific, or just feeling better in general?  I hope I am <br/>
not being too nosy... I have a vested interes though!  Thanks!                  <br/>
