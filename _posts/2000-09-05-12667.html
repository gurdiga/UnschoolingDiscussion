<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the welcome!<br/>
<br/>
A further introduction is probably in order.  I live in St. Louis, with my<br/>
husband - Kevin, and our son Graham who is 3.9 y/o.  We share our home with<br/>
2 cats as well.<br/>
<br/>
We used to joke about homeschooling, due to our personal experiences with<br/>
the school system (public & parochial), but I couldn&#39;t imagine doing it.<br/>
Then I found John Holt, and I said I can do that, that&#39;s what I had needed<br/>
myself .<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned Waldorf, well we experimented with that before I found the<br/>
Holt Books, I appreciate some of the ideas but it&#39;s quite dogmatic, for us<br/>
anyway.  We do like the emphasis on nature, and the lack of any formal<br/>
learning til age 7 or so.  The wooden toys are a nice idea, and the slower<br/>
pace for young children fit us too.  I liked the idea of preserving the<br/>
child&#39;s innocence, as I was a precocious little thing, but not much fun as a<br/>
kid.  The problem was this was much more theory, than practice at least in<br/>
our experience.  The children were quite aggressive, and the parents were<br/>
uh, &#39;laid back&#39; to say the least.  In one case the &#39;teacher&#39; did nothing<br/>
when one child pushed my toddler son to the floor and then pulled a chair<br/>
out from under him, but when he wanted to finally participate in circle time<br/>
and wanted to touch a puppet , well I was told that he needed to learn to<br/>
&#39;respect&#39;  the puppets!<br/>
She even wrote a note in the school newsletter, about how children who can&#39;t<br/>
respect puppets should go to the playground  and forgo circle time.<br/>
Needless to say we had already dropped out by the time someone passed that<br/>
on to me.  My son was 2 at the time.  The good news was that I gave up the<br/>
private school idea for good at that point.<br/>
<br/>
One other idea we did incoporate from Waldorf  was no t.v.  We almost never,<br/>
(except for a political debate or severe weather watch) watch t.v. anymore.<br/>
Okay,  I admit we were/will be again  Soprano junkies, got the tapes from my<br/>
Father, watched after Graham was in bed.  Graham does see PBS, Oprah, and<br/>
Jeopardy at my parent&#39;s house on a frequent basis, so he&#39;s not totally<br/>
culturally deprived!  It freed up a lot of time for us though, and we don&#39;t<br/>
really miss it, of course we didn&#39;t have cable anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Well that touches on most the recent threads- so I&#39;ll stop here.  Looking<br/>
forward to more discussions & advice from those with some experience at this<br/>
unschooling stuff!<br/>
<br/>
