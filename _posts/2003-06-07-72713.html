 </span></blockquote>Sandra, you have such great kids!!! I was thinking about this concept the <br/>
other day, after talking with a friend who is having difficulties with her 4 year <br/>
old. She goes to preschool and the traits that were already driving my friend <br/>
nuts are getting worse. So the topic of discipline and rules came up. People <br/>
always assume that because kids like our house so much it must have something <br/>
to do with our discipline and rules. I have agreed most of the time. The funny <br/>
thing is, their idea of discipline and rules are no where like ours. Our <br/>
rules are: have fun, enjoy yourself, be kind - not hateful or mean, never hurt <br/>
each other physically and respect each other. The discipline is: if you can&#39;t be <br/>
or do the afforementioned, then don&#39;t come over until you can. It&#39;s so simple <br/>
and yet it seems people want it to be so much more about power and less about <br/>
choices in being a decent human.  So I guess we really do have rules and <br/>
discipline, just not what are considered the standard of those. But really I don&#39;t <br/>
know what would be the standard.<br/>
<br/>
My friend is a gem, she and her hubby think my kids are the standard by which <br/>
all kids should be measured. I warn them that my kids are just what they are <br/>
because they are free to be so. Of course I slip in words of encouragement for <br/>
their child and am really hoping they will choose to take her out of school. <br/>
She goes 3 days a week now and I just hope for her sake they realize that the <br/>
traits they dislike won&#39;t magically disappear as long as she attends any <br/>
school.<br/>

the swimming pool with a friend of Robby&#39;s and his little brother. <br/>

I think you handled it well by giving this child clear expectations of what <br/>
it takes to be included in your family. I can totally identify with what <br/>
happened though. More often than not in my exprience, those are the kids who stick <br/>
around the longest. They are the kids screaming out for attention and will do <br/>
anything for it. I&#39;ve noticed that bullying or other posturing often comes from <br/>
the kids who don&#39;t have a voice in their own homes. It&#39;s actually so sad and <br/>
yes they often want boundaries, but NOT the boundaries our unsubbed poster was <br/>
speaking of. They simply want to know that someone on the planet gives a crap <br/>
about them enough to tell them so. <br/>
<br/>
My hubby loves it when Jenny Jones or one of the other talk show people has <br/>
the ones with kids who are so bad they get sent to boot camp. He&#39;s an x-marine <br/>
and although he&#39;d die that I&#39;m saying this, always gets teary eyed when the <br/>
head of the boot camp gets in those kids faces and breaks them down. His point <br/>
is also that all those kids are looking for is someone who will say, you are <br/>
worthy enough to be told you can&#39;t be an a$$hole. He always makes me laugh. He <br/>
thinks it would be the best job in the world to save kids from themselves <br/>
because no one else has bothered. He often thinks the parents should have to go <br/>
thru some kind of boot camp to understand their own role in why their children <br/>
feel so unworthy and act out accordingly. We agree that no kid just wakes up one <br/>
morning a bad a$$. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say don&#39;t give up on him yet. You have the opportuniy to make a <br/>
difference in his life. By no means do I say keep him around if you and your kids get <br/>
fed up or the dynamics become all about him either. I just think your whole <br/>
family has an opportunity to learn so much from this child and vice versa. Good <br/>
luck to you. Let us know how it goes.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;So...we&#39;re in rural Idaho. A dearth of kids for playing with. But I&#39;m<br/>
ready to banish this boy from our lives.<br/>
 any ideas?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure if I understand if your children enjoy being around this<br/>
boy. If it&#39;s you taking on the friend without your children really enjoying<br/>
being around him, then that&#39;s a different story. I have a friend who I enjoy<br/>
being around. She has a daughter that I must say I don&#39;t enjoy being around.<br/>
I feel like this child has possibly some type of autism that the mother<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to want to recognize. The daughter can be sweet one moment and<br/>
rude and physically aggressive the next. My kids have tried to play with<br/>
her. She doesn&#39;t really play &quot;with&quot; anyone. She&#39;s very antagonistic with no<br/>
visible comprehension of the results. I&#39;ve tried and my kids have tried and<br/>
it doesn&#39;t work. I only see her in groups now where my kids can keep a<br/>
distance.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids really do enjoy the company of this little boy, I would try<br/>
harder so that he can understand how people are with people they enjoy being<br/>
around. Just saying a few words to him about not leaving the table or not<br/>
grabbing is not enough. You didn&#39;t say how much you really talk to him so<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if you take more time with him alone to get to know him. Years<br/>
and years ago I was having a hard time with my soon to be step daughter. I<br/>
was in counseling and I was told that I could be the one person to make a<br/>
difference in this childs life. She was having a hard time with everyone<br/>
else, she needed someone to try and understand her. It wasn&#39;t about how I<br/>
was feeling about her behavior. It was about her. Now this was family so a<br/>
bit different but I made a solid effort every day and even though she&#39;s no<br/>
longer my step daughter, I talk to her all the time and she spends holidays<br/>
here and I adopted (not literally) her as my 5th child that I always wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Find out who this little boy is and talk to him, a lot. Talk about what you<br/>
see and what you do and what others do in circumstances. I have a feeling<br/>
that he hears often one liners of what he should or shouldn&#39;t do but no more<br/>
than that. So hearing it from you probably has no bearing on him. Being this<br/>
little kids friend may make a difference. But then again, it&#39;s a matter of<br/>
if you want to and if your kids really like him around. There&#39;s nothing<br/>
wrong with not wanting to be around people you don&#39;t enjoy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, both of these boys have classic &quot;pay attention to me&quot; behavior. <br/>
The little one, bouncing off the walls constantly. I&#39;m talking, seven <br/>
years old and climbing on top of tables and bouncing on the benches <br/>
at church,(as a kid would do, bouncing on the bed) and acting very <br/>
disrespectfully when talked to about it &quot;I don&#39;t HAVE to.&quot; And the <br/>
older one, my boy&#39;s friend...well, I&#39;ve described him. He&#39;s friendly <br/>
and SO boyish and big and just clueless. <br/>
<br/>
I know the &quot;training&quot; he has had: don&#39;t listen to mom until she&#39;s <br/>
freaking out on me, and I had to talk myself into a better mood <br/>
before saying what I did say. Were we really in a hurry? No...except <br/>
they were hungry and it was past dinner time, and their folks were <br/>
expecting them back, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right. My boy and he get along okay (Robby&#39;s a more <br/>
bookish, computer geek type) and I think we can do it. The more time <br/>
he spends with us, the easier he is going to be, to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Agreed. If we do end up having him around more, I&#39;ll definitely be <br/>
spending time with him and Robby together, and he&#39;ll hear more from <br/>
(us) about how things are done around here. I&#39;m going to have to <br/>
think EVERY time, though. Like, stop and THINK. Because, just bolting <br/>
down one&#39;s food and dashing is irritating. The rudeness of it is <br/>
shocking. I mean, I didn&#39;t think there was such a thing as a family <br/>
where kids don&#39;t learn table manners. So, when he shovelled his food <br/>
in and made to dash, I just responded. I wasn&#39;t rude. Just <br/>
said &quot;Please sit back down and ask to be excused. That&#39;s how we do it <br/>
around here.&quot; or some such. And he did. <br/>

with one of the dads at church, when he was whaling about himself <br/>
with a fallen branch. Two year olds playing, and old ladies standing <br/>
around visiting, and he&#39;s swinging this branch around haphazardly, <br/>
poking it, whacking the sidewalk with it.  Other kids were around the <br/>
corner with some willow wands, playing swords. Not hurting anyone, <br/>
and out of the way. This boy was right in the MIDDLE of everyone, <br/>
with a whopper of a branch. Hmmmm. <br/>
<br/>
The man said &quot;Put the stick down. You might hurt someone&quot; and the kid <br/>
grinned and made to run off. The man got hold of the stick, looked <br/>
the kid in the eye and said &quot;Put it down.&quot; and the kid did, but not <br/>
before trying to wrest the branch from the man&#39;s hand. When the man <br/>
didn&#39;t back down, this boy let go, and went off and played swords <br/>
with everyone else. Hmmm. <br/>

our children are done eating they get up and clean off their plates and put <br/>
them in the sink or dishwasher.  My question is what happens when they (your <br/>
children) dont ask to get up or leave? Is there a punishment? From the sounds of <br/>
your post this is a serious infraction in your home. My kids know table <br/>
manners but that is not one of them. When we are in a restaurant they do ask or <br/>
announce that they need to go to the restroom etc.. I have never told them to do <br/>
so they just do. They dont lay all over the table when they eat nor do they <br/>
eat like wild dogs (well minus the 1 yr. old ).<br/>

So you out rank him?  Maybe I am having an off night but I just do not <br/>
understand why this boy seems to bother you so much.  Each family has their values <br/>
and rules I guess but if he is not proper enough for your family maybe it would <br/>
be best to set him free. I mean he is your sons play mate isn&#39;t he? I had to <br/>
go back and re read the post to check and see if maybe the boy was a foster. I <br/>
just dont get why he needs to be converted????<br/>

kid shovels food in...says &#39;May I be excused?&#39;....and darts off when he&#39;s <br/>
done?  Asking to be excused does nothing for the kid but get him in on your <br/>
good side, which he doesn&#39;t sound to be anyway.  So in the end, it was <br/>
fruitless.  Just some arbitrary thing you made him do.  It&#39;s one thing to <br/>
let kids know &#39;this is how we do things around here&#39;...I guess...but the way <br/>
it sounds above, I mean, really, couldn&#39;t you have just said, &#39;Hey, next <br/>
time would you mind letting us know you are done and taking your dishes to <br/>
the sink, please?&#39;  Having him GO back and SIT down just to ask to GET up <br/>

and seargant-like.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line?  I think what you did was more rude than what he did and <br/>
disrespectful of him.<br/>

Do you treat ALL your guests this way that don&#39;t &#39;do it your way&#39;?  Or is it <br/>
just little annoying kids?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you are truly trying to help this child, Heidi and although it would <br/>
not be the point of contention for me or my family, if table manners are for <br/>
you than perhaps this child shouldn&#39;t eat at meal time with your family. I&#39;ll <br/>
admit when I read this portion of the post I was taken aback a little, because <br/>
I never would have assumed you to be so sticky as to require excuse to leave. <br/>
You post so often that it just threw me a little. In fact, I wasn&#39;t sure if I <br/>
would post on it initially. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with most of the responses as far as the table manners go though. <br/>
Never in my life have I requested to be excused from a table. I may, at dinner in <br/>
a restaurant with a large party, say excuse me but that is just being polite, <br/>
not asking permission. As far as my children go, they have table manners, in <br/>
that they don&#39;t chew with their mouths opens or talk when their mouths are <br/>
full, but I would be fully offended if anyone required them to ask permission to <br/>
be done or leave the table. At other people&#39;s houses, they say thank you and <br/>
always clear their portion of the table, but that&#39;s about being considerate of <br/>
the host/ess. Yet we are always complimented on how they act during meals. I <br/>
laugh, because they CHOOSE to be considerate, not because we REQUIRE it. <br/>
<br/>
I still think that your intentions to help this child assimilate to your <br/>
family&#39;s environment stem from a loving place in your heart and not all about <br/>
power. I see that from your posts about trying to get to know these boys more. I <br/>
believe you when you say you know your children enjoy their friendship and you <br/>
are willing to do what it takes to keep them around. <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - still wishing luck to Heidi and her children&#39;s friends.<br/>

Just wanted to comment on this.  This is a weakness of mine too.  I have lots and lots of neighbor kids here, many of which would not be considered &quot;mainstream&quot;.  These are the kids in detention, suspended, in trouble, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Well, sometimes I blur the lines between wanting to help them and knowing where my role actually stops.  Its *not* my job to teach them anything, but I care about them and want them to learn some things.  Its a fine line to walk.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My question is what happens when they (your <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children) dont ask to get up or leave? Is there a punishment? From <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the sounds of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your post this is a serious infraction in your home. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is why I said I&#39;d have to stop and THINK rather than just <br/>
responding automatically. We have a &quot;golden rule&quot; rule at our <br/>
house &quot;Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do Unto You&quot; IOW, if a <br/>
10 year old boy had spent a chunk of time preparing (something) for <br/>
the enjoyment of other people, would he rather people say &quot;Very Nice. <br/>
Thanks for doing that&quot; or just look at it and then leave? That is <br/>
where this leaving the table practice comes from. Someone has spent a <br/>
chunk of time preparing the food. It is good manners to at least <br/>
pause long enough to ask if one can leave the table. It&#39;s also common <br/>
practice in these parts.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, our kids have been taught (yes, taught) to say &quot;Thank you <br/>
for the food. May I please be excused?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But this boy hasn&#39;t had that rule in his life. He hasn&#39;t been taught <br/>
that you acknowledge the work that went into blessing the people <br/>
sitting around the table. And so, having him around will mean <br/>
THINKING things through. Most assuredly, I will be explaining why we <br/>
do such and such, rather than simply knee-jerk responding. At the <br/>
table, when he just bolted, as I said before, it was surprising, and <br/>
I simply responded without THINKING why he was doing such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids know table <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; manners but that is not one of them. When we are in a restaurant <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; eat like wild dogs (well minus the 1 yr. old ).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, how do you stop them from splaying themselves out over their <br/>
plates like hungry dogs? What if they wanted to eat that way? Do you <br/>
correct them at any time for bad table manners? And how do you do so? <br/>
Not based on THEIR wishes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, when he shovelled his food <br/>

 </span></blockquote>that sure <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t sound child driven/centered to me.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but I also don&#39;t see anything wrong with reminding him that there <br/>
is such a thing as saying thank you and acknowledging the person who <br/>
has invited him to the table and fed him. Someone else has said maybe <br/>
he&#39;ll realize there&#39;s someone in the world who gives a rat&#39;s a$$ how <br/>
he carries himself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ll add my hearty &quot;Amen!&quot; to that. He simply does not hear <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when an <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; adult of any stripe speaks to him.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stripe??<br/>
&gt; So you out rank him?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Figure of speech. Here, if a different wording will help you feel <br/>
better &quot;He simply does not hear when any adult speaks to him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for outranking him: On Pool Day, I had the keys to his ride home <br/>
in my hand. Maybe I DID outrank him, eh? I don&#39;t know who outranks <br/>
him when he&#39;s swinging a branch around the faces of two year olds, <br/>
but someone should say SOMETHING FORCEFUL to the child, or someone&#39;s <br/>
going to get hurt. And yet, it took a father (not his, nor his <br/>
mother) taking the branch in his hand, establishing eye-contact, and <br/>
telling him to cease, for him to actually listen. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am having an off night but I just do not <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; understand why this boy seems to bother you so much.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think this boy bothers me SO much? He has done things that <br/>
irritate me. He was extremely irritating at the pool. And I was <br/>
asking advice. What does a family do, when kids join activities, <br/>
whose behavior is irritating, rude, dangerous? Something, I&#39;m sure. <br/>
We don&#39;t want to say &quot;No more of that boy&quot; because he is friendly and <br/>
interesting. But I also don&#39;t want him here simply irritating me <br/>
every time he&#39;s over<br/>
<br/>
Which is why I said my own self, in hanging with him, I&#39;d be THINKING <br/>
it out, whenever such an irritation did happen.<br/>

&gt; Jennifer<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems like people are not reading the things I have been saying <br/>
about this. I&#39;ve said a few different times, that I&#39;m realizing the <br/>
importance of THINKING out the &quot;why&quot; of things, rather than just <br/>
automatically responding.<br/>
<br/>
Did you not see these paragraphs, Jennifer?:<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the following, re: pool incident<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I had to talk myself into a better mood <br/>
&quot;before saying what I did say. Were we really in a hurry? No...except <br/>
&quot;they were hungry and it was past dinner time, and their folks were <br/>
&quot;expecting them back, etc. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the following about what I will do in future, when the friend <br/>
is over to play and acts obnoxious:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Agreed. If we do end up having him around more, I&#39;ll definitely be <br/>
&quot;spending time with him and Robby together, and he&#39;ll hear more from <br/>
&quot;(us) about how things are done around here. I&#39;m going to have to <br/>
&quot;think EVERY time, though. Like, stop and THINK. Because,  <br/>
&quot;just bolting <br/>
&quot;down one&#39;s food and dashing is irritating. The rudeness of it is <br/>
&quot;shocking. <br/>
<br/>
Can you see that I was saying &quot;I just told him to plop it back down <br/>
again and ask permission to leave, because what he did was so <br/>
shocking to me.&quot; ??? IOW, I recognized my tendency to Jerk The Knee, <br/>
and aknowledged that I should THINK of better ways to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
Can you see that? Yeah, his getting up and dashing was obnoxious <br/>
ACCORDING TO MY DEFINITION...but also according to the table manners <br/>
that are common around here. People ask to be excused. It&#39;s polite in <br/>
this area. I had honestly never seen a kid do that. Eat, and dash <br/>
off. And so I responded without THINKING.<br/>
<br/>
Respect goes both ways. It was disrespectful of me to just order him <br/>
to plant it, but it was disrespectful of him to gobble his food and <br/>
split without acknowledging the dinner or the hostess. But I could <br/>
have handled it better. Maybe the way you suggest. Like I said, the <br/>
kid is basically clueless.<br/>

Okay...didn&#39;t know that. See? Learn something new every day, and <br/>
first thing in the morning, too.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I ask if you read anything else I&#39;ve written about this <br/>
kid. Seems like a branch swinging, like people saying &quot;Put the branch <br/>
down&quot; and him ignoring it until someone got ahold of it and spoke to <br/>
him forcefully. He doesn&#39;t listen. And he didn&#39;t listen when we were <br/>
at the pool AND I talked to myself about it. Were we really in a <br/>
hurry? etc. He had irritated me at the pool by grabbing the dollar I <br/>
intended for Robby, out of my hand, and I didn&#39;t want to be <br/>
arbitrarily saying &quot;Outta the pool&quot; on my time table or based on the <br/>
irritation of the dollar thing. Didn&#39;t want to take them out unless <br/>
we really did have to go. And we did. And so I talked to him about <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, if you mean what you are putting out here, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think you&#39;re in the wrong place to solicit the kind of support <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and advice <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you appear to want.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What?!?!??! Tell me what sort of advice I appear to want. After <br/>
reading the things I appear to have said about this. &quot;Going to have <br/>
to THINK about how I respond&quot;   &quot;Talked myself into a better mood&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if after reading how shocked some of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; us are, you can see the flaws in your thinking, then you have come <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; perfect place!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I were him and you came across like this to me, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>listen to you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; either!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, back to the branch swinging thing. If someone said &quot;Hey, put the <br/>
branch down. Someone&#39;s going to get hurt&quot; would you listen? Because <br/>
he wasn&#39;t listening then, either. Point being: a kid swinging a <br/>
branch doesn&#39;t necessarily see that he could hurt someone. But the <br/>
adults, standing back and watching other, younger kids in the area  <br/>
might see something he doesn&#39;t see. But if he doesn&#39;t listen, what is <br/>
one to do?  Yes, grab the younger ones, but it is perfectly valid to <br/>
request the branch not be swung right now, right there. There&#39;s <br/>
NOTHING WRONG with telling a kid to stop doing something that is <br/>
dangerous. But how, if he doesn&#39;t LISTEN?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I say the next time he comes to visit, offer him a hug and some <br/>

Them, actually, because I&#39;m changing how I deal w/my own kids, too.<br/>

My intentions about this child really are for him and my boy to hang <br/>
together, and me to be able to hack it, when he does things that are <br/>
rude, obnoxious, and/or irritating. I know, as I change how I respond <br/>
to such things, that they will decrease in both number and level of <br/>
irritation. Level of irritation may just change because of MY <br/>
changes. <br/>

thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716656082"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My kids say &quot;May I be excused&quot; Or &quot;thank you for the food&quot; and <br/>
&gt;take <br/>
&gt; their dishes to the sink.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids also thank me, but not because I make them say it or because <br/>
it&#39;s a &quot;rule&quot; in our home.<br/>
I think they&#39;ve learned it by example and do it because they&#39;re <br/>
geuninely thankful and/or because they tend to think of my feelings <br/>
since I&#39;ve always thought of theirs.  Sometimes after a sit-dow-<br/>
together meal (which we don&#39;t even always do) they&#39;re in a big hurry <br/>
to get up... usually because they have something they&#39;re excited to <br/>
do, and I might remind them &quot;could you bring your dishes over to the <br/>
sink?  Thanks!&quot;  That&#39;s about it.   <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In fact, our kids have been taught (yes, taught) to say &quot;Thank you <br/>
&gt; for the food. May I please be excused?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My children have friends (2 brothers) who say this when they eat <br/>
with us and we all find it somewhat amusing.  Not in a mean way, but <br/>
in a &quot;isn&#39;t-that-quaint-and-old-fashioned&quot; way.  To me it&#39;s a <br/>
reminder that many people still see children as basically inferior <br/>
to adults.  I don&#39;t think needing permission to leave the table has <br/>
anything to do with &quot;showing respect&quot; or &quot;being thankful.&quot;  Respect <br/>
is earned, not commanded, and being thankful comes from actually <br/>
being thankful, and you can only know if someone is truly thankful <br/>
(and being honest) if they are free to be that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, how do you stop them from splaying themselves out over their <br/>
&gt; plates like hungry dogs? What if they wanted to eat that way? Do <br/>
&gt;you <br/>
&gt; correct them at any time for bad table manners? And how do you do <br/>
&gt;so? <br/>
&gt; Not based on THEIR wishes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, based on THEIR wishes.  I think that kids just need time and <br/>
information.  &quot;When you chew with your mouth open it really bothers <br/>
some people.&quot;  It&#39;s not &quot;correcting&quot; them, it&#39;s giving them good <br/>
information about how to live in the world happily.  It might seem <br/>
like a small difference but it&#39;s actually a whole new paradigm.  You <br/>
could see them as little brutes who need to be &quot;corrected&quot; and <br/>
molded into respectable humans, or you can see them as people who <br/>
mean well but lack our broader experience.<br/>
 <br/>

the little boy as rude- because he got up from the table without <br/>
thinking.<br/>

Mabye I&#39;m just way more liberal than most people, but the only time <br/>

a &quot;biggie&quot; i.e. it threatens people or property.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mabye because he&#39;s told so often what to do and not do do about <br/>
things that don&#39;t really matter that he&#39;s tuning adults out when <br/>
they are saying something that *does* matter.  I, personally, would <br/>
have removed the stick from his hand myself right off the bat!  I <br/>
don&#39;t waver when it comes to my kids&#39; safety.  The last friend who <br/>
visited here and wasn&#39;t nice to my three year old wasn&#39;t invited <br/>
back for a long time.  To me that&#39;s a whole different issue <br/>
than &quot;may I please be excused.&quot;<br/>

I have never taught my kids or Husband to say thank you and may I please be <br/>
excused (reminds me of &quot;thank you may I please have another&quot;). They DO say <br/>
thank you or thanks Mom I have never told them to.  They do not ask for permission <br/>
to leave the table as they don&#39;t ask for more helpings they just do it. When <br/>
they are out at others homes they don&#39;t just get up and walk away they sit <br/>
with the family until they notice or know what the routine is. I have never told <br/>
them what or how to do it.<br/>

<br/>
I guess we don&#39;t have a sit down meal so I have no point of reference.  My <br/>
boys eat when they are hungry so it is hard to pin point a time to have a meal <br/>
prepared and I am learning to eat that way too.  I try to have things around <br/>
that they like and when they are hungry they sometimes ask for help to see what <br/>
we have and help cooking it if that is what they want.  If I am cooking <br/>
something for myself I will ask if they wane me to cook extra for them as well.  <br/>
Also have things in the frig that can be microwaved.  Anyway that wasn&#39;t the <br/>
point of the post.<br/>
<br/>
I guess for my boys eating is just to relieve hunger.  They eat till they are <br/>
no longer hungry then stop.  They like things that are portable so they don&#39;t <br/>
have to stop whatever exciting thing they are doing at the moment.  I can <br/>
appreciate that.  I know sometimes I am busy and don&#39;t want to stop.<br/>

&quot;cool&quot; friends that he wanted to eat and get back to whatever exciting thing he <br/>
was doing before.  I don&#39;t think about excusing myself from the table. I was <br/>
never asked to excuse myself from the table as a child, I don&#39;t think it is <br/>
necessarily the norm in most households, at least not so many that I would expect <br/>
that from my neighbors or friends. <br/>

everyone has a car but we do.  I don&#39;t hold that over my children.  They don&#39;t <br/>
have to act a certain way to get a ride.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys love sticks.  We bring at least 2 home every week from play group and <br/>
they even have a little collection and can tell you where they picked up each <br/>
stick.  So much creative play with a stick.  But I do have to remind them <br/>
often that it might not be a good idea to take it on a crowded jungle gym (you <br/>
know those slide/play things they have on playgrounds now).  A lot of children <br/>
running and jumping, someone might get hurt.  But I offer to hold it for them <br/>
while they get up and go play, and they usually take me up on it.  Sometimes <br/>
just a little reminder that the child might not see everyone in his sticks path <br/>
is all it takes.  Reminder to make sure they know where the stick is going.<br/>
Anyway, long enough.<br/>

ignore that kind of stuff because they like playing with him overall.  They <br/>
treat him nice.  Sometimes I feel like my boys are &quot;too nice&quot; for that rude <br/>

to have him over then I should stay out of it. I don&#39;t feel it is my <br/>
responsibility to &quot;change&quot; his behavior. I do watch what is going on out of the corner <br/>
of my eye, and stay involved with what they are doing.  My boys do have other <br/>
friends and if it gets to a point where they are not willing to put up with <br/>
his behavior to play with him they know they have other options.  Didn&#39;t we just <br/>
have a discussion about putting up with rudeness...my boys are good at <br/>
problem solving and also asking for help problem solving.<br/>

Why? Why not say it nice? Why not move the 2 yr. olds? I am thinking you see <br/>
this child as someone who is lacking in parenting and you know who the parents <br/>
are and are trying to fix the child or prove a point behind the parents back. <br/>
That would make you the royal enforcer. You are convinced your way works or <br/>
will produce a better child. My children see me as an equal not a disciplinary <br/>
force ruling over them. <br/>
 <br/>

asking advice. What does a family do, when kids join <br/>
activities, <br/>
Whose behavior is irritating, rude, dangerous? Something, I&#39;m sure. <br/>
We <br/>
don&#39;t want to say &quot;No more of that boy&quot; because he is friendly and <br/>
interesting. <br/>
But I also don&#39;t want him here simply irritating me <br/>

 <br/>
I understand that you FEEL that he was rude to you BUT does that mean that a <br/>
parent who spanks heavily should feel that your child should be spanked for <br/>
not following their family rules?<br/>
Irritating you, rude to you? The basis of a friend is for your son not you <br/>
why not let the boy be a child.  My guess is this table thing is not all that <br/>
takes place. I see you have religious values but some of them do not fit into <br/>
Unschooling as they are laid out.  <br/>

To me if the boy eats your food that alone tells you he likes your cooking. <br/>
If you where at someone&#39;s home would you ask to be excused? I bet no, you may <br/>

I originally thought the boy was waving the stick *at* the two year <br/>
olds and wouldn&#39;t respond to verbal input, hence my position that I <br/>
would take it.<br/>
If he was just playing with it in a dangerous way, and was open to <br/>
the suggestion to move the play elsewhere, then I think taking the <br/>
stick away would be totally unreasonable.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Patti<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I agree with all of this.  To me also, the table manners are not nearly <br/>
as big a deal as the safety issues.   I would ask the kid once to put the <br/>
stick down, say something like, &quot;oh, watch it with the stick, we don&#39;t want <br/>
anyone to get hurt, please put it down&quot;  Then if he didnt, just take it away from <br/>
him and say again, &quot; I dont want anyone to get hurt&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>
The table manners.. well, we don&#39;t have any at my house.. LOL.. nah, we do, <br/>
just not the &quot;formal&quot;kind.   We do say &quot;pass the so and so&quot;, and my kids <br/>
usually thank me for a meal or maybe just tell me how much they liked it.  But, they <br/>
do that of thier own accord.   Maybe because they have always heard me say <br/>
something along those lines to other folks when we eat at thier houses.  Maybe <br/>
it&#39;s just because they appreciate it and want to tell me.  My Daddy once told <br/>
us, &quot;your Moma worked very hard on this meal, you should thank her for it&quot;    <br/>
And, he would always thank her for the meal or say how good it was.  I agreed <br/>
100% with him and I DID appreciate my Mom for cooking our food, so I always <br/>
told her, and I still do.   I always thank my husband when he takes us out for <br/>
dinner ( or whomever pays for the meal)  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do the &quot;excused from the table&quot; thing.  It&#39;s just something we never <br/>
adopted as good manners practice.  Maybe it is a regional thing, but folks <br/>
around here don&#39;t usually excuse themselves.. Well, if you get up in the middle <br/>
of a meal, you would say &quot;excuse me&quot;  the same as you would do if you had to <br/>
leave in the middle of anything.    But after eating, folks usually sit around <br/>
and talk or get up and leave, whichever they want to do.   Sometimes the kids <br/>
want to stay and talk, sometimes they eat  and  then  back to whatever they <br/>
were doing.   If they are REALLY into something, but they are also hungry, they <br/>
will just get thier food and take it with them to eat as they continue thier <br/>
&quot;thing&quot;.     If we are having a sit down meal, they usually opt to sit down <br/>
with us and enjoy the family conversation.    <br/>
<br/>
I would think, if your family usually excuses themselves after their meal, if <br/>
the kid continues to come around and have meals with your family, he will <br/>
pick up on that and probably start to do it too.   And, if he doesn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
stress over it.  It&#39;s just probably something he is not accustomed to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That reminds me of a story.  We were at a McDs with Jackson&#39;s dad, Jackson <br/>
was not there.  Just me father-in-law and my two boys (6 and 9).  Dad&#39;s choice <br/>
of restaurant by the way, none of us really like McDs food.  The boys got happy <br/>
meals.  The were nibbling and playing as they were really not that hungry.  <br/>
He, father-in-law, grabbed Dallen&#39;s toy and said &quot;you can&#39;t play with that <br/>
until you eat all your food.&quot;  Dallen looked puzzled as he has never been told <br/>
that before then reached over and gently took his toy back.  He said &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>
hungry.&quot;  Father-in-law said &quot;you have to eat your food.&quot; That is when I stepped <br/>
in and said &quot;no he doesn&#39;t.&quot; End of conversation.  (by the way I was the one <br/>
that bought the food not my FIL)<br/>
<br/>
 I didn&#39;t want to say anything else in front of the boys to him so I <br/>
explained the situation to Jackson at home that night and had him talk to his dad <br/>
about trying to discipline our boys when he is visiting us.<br/>
