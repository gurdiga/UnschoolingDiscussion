<br/>
Holly was at a barbecue with several families.  One homeschools. One was <br/>
going to homeschooling meetings last year with her four year old daughter.  <br/>
One family doesn&#39;t homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Holly told me this afternoon that the mom of the four year old said she was <br/>
going to put her in school, partly because it was free daycare, and partly <br/>
because she had asked the girl to write down her ABCs and the child refused, <br/>
so she should go to school.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That SO SAD,&quot; Holly said.<br/>
<br/>
And of the other family she said the mom was reporting that the first morning <br/>
of school he didn&#39;t want to get up and refused to go.  &quot;When he got home&quot; <br/>
(she said, which means his refusal didn&#39;t work) he said &quot;I don&#39;t want to go <br/>
back to school. I want to be homeschooled like Josh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked her if the mom was likely to let him, and she didn&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me, though, of what might be a good thing for some people, and <br/>
will surely be a bad thing for many more:  Our proving that there is an <br/>
option will make many children resent school and their parents even more.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little and there was really NO option it was easier for parents <br/>
and children to resign themselves to what they saw as inevitable.  And for <br/>
some parents now it is still inevitable.  Ijust got e-mail from a single mom <br/>
friend of mine who works full time in Washington DC.  She just got a better <br/>
job and is thrilled. But it&#39;s expensive to live there and she&#39;s taking care <br/>
of her son all alone.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are extreme options, but not easy options.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe we need to remember to be compassionate in this back-to-school <br/>
season and not do the happy dance TOO publicly.<br/>

schooled kids. Tonight, as they were waiting to go into the pool, I heard<br/>
a few of them discussing unschooling, homeschooling, and schooling. One<br/>
of the girls said she couldn&#39;t homeschool because all her mom and dad<br/>
knew was &quot;Mexican stuff&quot;. I found that to be really sad, how she had<br/>
learned that &quot;mexican stuff&quot; wasn&#39;t valauble, just &quot;school stuff&quot; was.<br/>
<br/>
The she segued into discussing who had breasts and who didn&#39;t, and how<br/>
big she wanted hers to eventually get. These girls are *9*.<br/>

but let&#39;s remember to be kind to those *other* children who aren&#39;t as<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a choice. I didn&#39;t even consider it to be a very extreme one, at<br/>
least it wasn&#39;t for me. I think people with unsupportive spouses or<br/>
extended families where everyone is a public school teacher have a much<br/>
harder time unschooling than I did as a single mom taking care of my<br/>
child all alone. I don&#39;t actually know of any single moms who decided<br/>
they wanted to homeschool, tried to make it work, and ended up sending<br/>
their kids to school because they couldn&#39;t do it financially. OTOH, I<br/>
know *lots* of homeschooling single moms who seem to be doing just fine.<br/>
Maybe you don&#39;t take your dream job, or you don&#39;t live in your dream<br/>

because if they REALLY didn&#39;t think it was better they wouldn&#39;t be doing it.<br/>
<br/>
My friend in DC WOULD like to unschool, but she wouldn&#39;t like it enough to <br/>
forego living near relatives and having a car and a place she feels is safe <br/>
and good to live in.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about how great unschooling&#39;s going for us, but it&#39;s bad <br/>
enough that sometimes she asks directly how the kids are, and that sometimes <br/>
she forgets and starts gong on about problems her son&#39;s having in school.   I <br/>
AM being nice to her, in a kind of pitying or compassionate way, by just not <br/>
talking much about homeschooling.<br/>

She might have pulled it off had she stayed in New Mexico, but the culture <br/>
here was foreign to her, and she felt isolated and wanted her son to grow up <br/>
among people more like her and her parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516521790">Sandra,  you are so right,  I feel as though I really need to be sensitive to others when it comes to our choice of staying home.  I have several friends of my children who want to be homeschooled, but their parents don&#39;t think its an option for them, reason being they only can see school-at-home option.  I particularily have a good friend who is a wonderful parent, involved and also interested in doing so much with her kids, fun stuff.  But she doesn&#39;t think she would have the patience to do school at home.  I keep trying to eep in to her the idea of unschooling but this is a very hard concept for her, she was a special ed. teacher.  I&#39;m just going to keep showing her how happy we are and how much we are learning without even sitting down and &#39;doing lessons&#39;.  They just got home from a trip where they stopped at all the caves and history places in So. Dakota and such,  I wish she could see life could be like that always!  Not only in the summer.  <br/>
 <br/>
P.S.  What is really sad is that both children are awesome natural learners they would thrive so well in an unschooling atmosphere.  And the son is really struggling with depression and self-hate because he is really scared to do something wrong in school!  Poor guy. <br/>
I am so thankful to have found unschooling! Kelli<br/>

my kids are unschooled all the way doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m somehow a <br/>
&quot;better&quot; parent than someone who chooses to send their kids to <br/>
school. I don&#39;t see the question of education as much different than <br/>
any other choices one makes in life, like food, clothes, where to <br/>
live, how to make a living, etc. I&#39;ve made different decisions for my <br/>

someone who&#39;s made other decisions. Or did I confuse your intent?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interestingly (to me, anyway), I came across this same statement in <br/>
one of the notes sent by a parent looking for homeschooling <br/>
information this morning (the office deals with most of them, but I <br/>
receive a dozen or so direct inquiries every day). There seems to be <br/>
a popular misconception that unschooling or homeschooling in general <br/>
takes vast amounts of time and patience on the part of a parent. In <br/>
my experience it doesn&#39;t take any more of either than thoughtful <br/>
parenting should rightfully take anyway, and in fact, as our kids got <br/>
older it seemed like they took increasingly less time and patience <br/>
than their public schooled friends, whose parents were always running <br/>
here and there either transporting them to events or attending things <br/>
or buying them stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wondered how much the wheels of economy are greased by <br/>
this constant buzz of activity. I went to Wal-Mart with my mom <br/>
yesterday and was amazed to see a rack with lists of school supplies <br/>
from the various schools around the area; kids and parents were <br/>
scanning the rack and seizing the list for their school... Out of <br/>
sheer curiousity I ventured down the school supplies aisle and sure <br/>
enough - there were scads of parents and children busily filling <br/>
their carts with items on their lists. I must not get out enough <br/>
because this struck me as pretty weird, but these folks all seemed to <br/>
take it in stride.<br/>
<br/>
Where was I? Oh yeah, patience. I don&#39;t think patience is a virtue <br/>
we&#39;re born with. I think we need to learn how valuable it is to apply <br/>
patience as liberally as possible, especially where smallish children <br/>
are concerned. I know I didn&#39;t start out as a patient person; it took <br/>
quite a while for me to figure out how to really listen to what my <br/>
kids were saying, and I know I&#39;m still learning now with my <br/>
grandkids. It&#39;s interesting to watch how their parents react to <br/>
things they say, and how I get a totally different interpretation <br/>
based on body language, tone, attitude and other subtle and <br/>
not-so-subtle indicators. Their parents tend to take things at <br/>
surface value - they said this so they must want that - whereas I&#39;ve <br/>
pointed out a number of times that there&#39;s more going on with little <br/>
kids than meets the eye, or the ear. Case in point: the eternal &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
hungry,&quot; which sometimes does mean they&#39;re hungry, but more often <br/>
than not means they&#39;re bored, or restless, or want attention, or want <br/>
to distract attention from something else (usually something they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be doing), or any of a number of other things.<br/>

thier kids.  I think there are some who mostly do what&#39;s best, others <br/>
who sometimes do what&#39;s best and others who rarely do what&#39;s best.<br/>
I think people who homeschool have their childrens education on a <br/>
slightly to vastly higher priority than schoolers.  I think that <br/>
people who unschool have their childrens freedom and rights to <br/>
respect, and trust in them on a slightly to vastly higher priority <br/>
than school at homers.<br/>
I think people who choose whole foods and/or are vegetarians have <br/>
theirs and theirs childrens dietary needs on a slightly to vastly <br/>
higher priority than me and many others.<br/>
Infact, I feed my kids chicken nuggest and pizza on a regular basis <br/>
and am not always good about offering a well rounded diet.<br/>
I don&#39;t always use good judgment when I am dealing with my kids and <br/>
our living together.  I will galdly admit to be lesser in many areas <br/>
that I see others as slightly to vastly more intuned to.  I strive to <br/>
be better, or live in a form of denial, while every once in a while <br/>
trying to be better in those areas, or with some things constantly <br/>
striving to be better.<br/>
I do see things as better or worse in varying degrees.  If it&#39;s <br/>
important enough to me to put my energy into, I stive for the better.<br/>

Some people will only wear natural fibers.  They must think wearing natural <br/>
fibers is better than not, for some reason.  Some will not let their girls <br/>
wear shorts or pants or sleeveless shirts.  They think their reasons for <br/>
doing it is good.  They think those who DO let their daughters dress <br/>
immodestly are making a horribly irresponsible and dangerous decision.<br/>
<br/>
If they won&#39;t admit it they&#39;re being hypocritical.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t believe they&#39;re doing the best they can do.  Some people <br/>
wish they had other jobs, or ate better, or went to church more, or weeded <br/>
their yards more.  But when someone makes a decision like taking a child out <br/>
of school and it&#39;s not JUST about that one child&#39;s needs at the moment but it <br/>
involves their belief that schools are harmful and that homeschooling is <br/>
better in MANY ways, they might as well admit they think it&#39;s better in many <br/>
ways.<br/>

&gt;involves their belief that schools are harmful and that homeschooling is<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If one truly believed that then there&#39;s no reason why they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
anyway, but what about those who aren&#39;t so certain that homeschooling <br/>
is better? And at what point does one change from one certainty to <br/>

&gt;Date: Wed, Aug 28, 2002, 2:41 PM<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I get the patience thing from everyone when they hear that I homeschool,  I<br/>
&gt; guess its just that they really don&#39;t understand what we (unschoolers) are<br/>
&gt; doing.  And to me we aren&#39;t really doing anything?!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If schooling parents are clearly interested and sincere, I tell them that<br/>
because homeschoolers can choose what kind of materials to use with their<br/>
kids (including letting the kids have some or all of the input), and can<br/>
change their minds 10 times a year if they want to, that homeschooling<br/>
requires much, much less patience than coping with somebody else&#39;s homework<br/>
assignments, and even with a formal program doesn&#39;t have to take much more<br/>
time than same.<br/>
<br/>
When they say they couldn&#39;t be with their kids all day, I tell them that it<br/>
takes some adjustment and compromise for the first few weeks or months, but<br/>
after that everyone learns everyone else&#39;s orbits and habits and how to deal<br/>
together as a family.<br/>
<br/>
But most people who say these things are just latching on to an<br/>
excuse-for-the-moment because they don&#39;t want to homeschool and don&#39;t want<br/>
to think or talk about homeschooling. With practice, I have become able to<br/>
tell the difference between the sincerely-interested and the<br/>
insincerely-interested &lt;g&gt; and either give helpful, longer answers to the<br/>
former or smile and change the subject with the latter.<br/>
<br/>
As with anything else, people will see what you do and if their family is<br/>
having a consistently hard and stressful time and they see your family<br/>
having a consistently peaceful and happy time, they may come to realize they<br/>
can change if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
This goes back to what Dar (I think) was saying about single moms and<br/>
affording homeschooling and all that -- it&#39;s a matter of priorities. If job<br/>
or city or neighborhood or proximity to family is a higher priority than<br/>
freedom in education, that&#39;s fine, but I think there is rarely (very rarely?<br/>
somewhat rarely? don&#39;t know) a real &quot;can&#39;t&quot; to homeschooling, for those who<br/>
really want to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forget that question. Sandra&#39;s just talking about systems of belief<br/>
basically. That question just muddies my interpretation ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. I can only make it work if I believe other systems are harmful. Say, if<br/>
my reasons for choosing vegetarianism are for moral or (universal) health<br/>
reasons. I would think the world would be a better place if it naturally<br/>
evolved towards the same belief.<br/>
<br/>
I would work for raising kids in an ideal unschooling environment too.<br/>
<br/>
But I can&#39;t make it work for atheism or UU. Though I think atheism is<br/>
intellectually superior, and though I think belief in God has caused harm,<br/>
it isn&#39;t belief in God alone that has caused the harm. And though atheism is<br/>
superior for me in all aspects, I don&#39;t think the world would be superior in<br/>
all aspects if everyone was atheist.<br/>
<br/>
So I have to remove my &quot;Sandra Interpretter&quot; hat on that one. She&#39;s going to<br/>
have to handle that one herself. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085102732">I think that some people don&#39;t ever consider that they can make a <br/>
choice that&#39;s different than the majority of people around them.  (A <br/>
direct result of school, I believe, as described in Gatto&#39;s dumbing <br/>
us down.)  <br/>
<br/>
I know a lady who was talking to me about how she felt when she sent <br/>
her girls to kindergarten.  She hated it.  She wished she didn&#39;t have <br/>
to.  But she just didn&#39;t know there was another way.  She might have <br/>
vaguely heard of homeschooling, but didn&#39;t know anyone who ever did <br/>
it.  Compulsory age in our state is 8, but NO ONE, other than <br/>
homeschoolers, really knows that.  Everyone just assumes that when <br/>
kids turn 5 they HAVE to go to kindergarten.  As far as most people <br/>
are concerned their only choice is whether or not to send their kids <br/>
to pre-K.  <br/>
<br/>
The same thing is true with a lot of things.  The doctor says to <br/>
vaccinate.  How many people every sit down and research the pros and <br/>
cons of vaccinating?  Not many.  The majority just say that since the <br/>
doctor says to do it, the billboards say to do it, and every one else <br/>
does it, it must be what to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I do think that unschooling is the best choice for <br/>
children.  Some people will ask what about parents who use drugs or <br/>
are abusive, and my answer is that what needs to change is the drug <br/>
use and the abuseiveness, not the unschooling.  I don&#39;t unschool <br/>
because I don&#39;t believe the school-at-home approach isn&#39;t best for my <br/>
kids, I unschool because school at home isn&#39;t good for any kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do believe I&#39;ve made a superior choice.  That doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that I&#39;m superior to other people, it just means that in this one <br/>
life decision, I think I&#39;ve made the better choice.  If I didn&#39;t <br/>
think it was a better choice, I wouldn&#39;t bother--I&#39;d just send my <br/>
kids to school! <br/>

Some people<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; wish they had other jobs, or ate better, or went to church more, <br/>
or weeded<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; their yards more.  But when someone makes a decision like taking <br/>
a child out<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of school and it&#39;s not JUST about that one child&#39;s needs at the <br/>
moment but it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; involves their belief that schools are harmful and that <br/>
homeschooling is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; better in MANY ways, they might as well admit they think it&#39;s <br/>
better in many<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; ways.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Helen:<br/>
&gt; &gt; If one truly believed that then there&#39;s no reason why they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway, but what about those who aren&#39;t so certain that <br/>
homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; is better? And at what point does one change from one certainty to<br/>
&gt; &gt; another? And whose business is it to call them hypocritical if<br/>
&gt; &gt; they&#39;re not even sure themselves of how they&#39;re feeling about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; issue? Cut people some slack, Sandra.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was that &quot;but&quot; in there. She isn&#39;t talking about the people <br/>
who aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; certain only the ones who are sure of their decision but then say <br/>
all other<br/>
&gt; choices are equally valid.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I think that some people don&#39;t ever consider that they can make a <br/>
choice that&#39;s different than the majority of people around them.  (A <br/>
direct result of school, I believe, as described in Gatto&#39;s dumbing <br/>
us down.) &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was one of those people.  My son had problems in school since the beginning.  I even went so far as to have him tested (due to his kindergarten teacher&#39;s insistence) and &#39;they&#39; found him to be ADHD, ODD, and bulemic (vomiting since 18mos. with no physiological reason found.  I personally believe it is mainly due to anxiety).  He was 5 years old.  I was advised to medicate him. During that time I was researching on the internet about ADHD and &#39;discovered&#39; homeschooling.  I had not even thought of that as an option.  I was so upset, and I am still a little bitter, that no one tells you that you have a choice of sending your child/ren to school or keeping them home. The many doctors, counselors, other parents, grandparents, and friends gave a lot of advice but no one ever mentioned homeschooling, much less UNschooling.  It was like a bright beacon of light at the end of the long, dark tunnel.  <br/>
<br/>
He did return to school after staying home a year and things did seem to be going okay.....for a while........then it got worse again.  I really tried to &#39;play by their rules&#39; and fully encourage school, be the room mother, etc...but it just didn&#39;t feel right at all.  I think all along I knew that my children needed to be home with me and that&#39;s what we are doing now.  School started here last week and we are still doing the &#39;happy dance&#39; every morning at 9am when they get up and realize that they would have been late for school if we were going.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone on the list for the continuing support, advice, and encouragement.  I joined this list in the spring (when my kids were still in school) and by &#39;listening&#39; to all of the posts, I firmed up my beliefs about what is right for my family.  Unschooling has taken such a load off our my shoulders.  We don&#39;t have to try to fit the mold any longer.  I feel such freedom and I do wish that more people were more aware/knowledgable of the possiblities..........<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; decisions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I read Sandra&#39;s comments about thinking the choices we make are <br/>
better than the alternatives, I did not take from it that she was <br/>
judging the person but the choice.  Do you not think unschooling is <br/>
better than ps or school at home?  Isn&#39;t that why you chose to do <br/>
it?  And don&#39;t you think that giving chldren control over their <br/>
learning is better for most if not all kids, not just yours?  Every <br/>
time we make a choice about something, we are judging its value.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Or maybe some people recognize that things change. In Richard Bach&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Illusions&quot; (one of my personal all-time favorites) there&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>something <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; along the lines of &quot;Ask yourself these questions once in a while: <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; am I? Where am I going? Where have I been? - and see how the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>answers <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; change.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try hard not to judge people but when I see someone shaming their <br/>
child or some such thing it is hard not to make some judgement.  I <br/>
was talking with some moms a couple of years ago and a mother <br/>
mentioned that she had told her seven year old son to call his penis <br/>
and testicles his monkey and coconuts and how when he asked what <br/>
sanitary napkins were, she told him they were throat warmers.  Now, I <br/>
think that is just the same as telling him that he better not ask her <br/>
questions about sexuality because she won&#39;t answer them honestly, not <br/>
to mention what it says to me about whether or not she is likely to <br/>
treat her son respectfully. If I knew that when she was a child she <br/>
was slapped every time she asked such a question, then I could <br/>
recognize and appreciate that she is doing better than what was done <br/>
to her and maybe if she has younger children, she will come even <br/>
farther and answer them.  However, I still think it&#39;s even better to <br/>
be honest with your kids.  And I can allow for the possibility that <br/>
she may not ever get to a place where she can do that.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>or weeded<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;their yards more.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that I am doing the best I can do in several areas of <br/>
my life;  I can be a better parent and I don&#39;t weed my yard nearly <br/>
enough.  I had to smile at that example because we live in between <br/>
two homes of truly superior gardeners and I used to feel badly about <br/>
that.  But then I realized that right now my energy goes towards <br/>
being a better parent and just accepted that having a beautiful <br/>
garden is not a priority in my life right now.  That doesn&#39;t mean my <br/>
neighbors are better people, but they are definitely superior <br/>
gardeners.  And if they want to base their opinion of me as a <br/>
neighbor on the condition of my yard, then so be it.  And <br/>
coincidentally (or not I think) this realization came shortly after I <br/>
started unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
If that&#39;s true, then everyone&#39;s posts are equally valid and useful.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember who, when, a year or two ago was arguing that her ideas were <br/>
as valid as anyone else&#39;s on the list, even though she wasn&#39;t an unschooler <br/>
(or had been since that week or something.<br/>
<br/>
It was a problem with the concept of &quot;valid,&quot; I think.  Valid in relation to <br/>
what?<br/>
<br/>
My opionions about nuclear weapons are mine, but they&#39;re not as &quot;valid&quot; as <br/>
those of a nuclear engineer or admirals and generals, or even of Tom Clancy! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They just do really know more about it than I do.<br/>
<br/>
The opinion of someone who&#39;s never lived around field irrigation by ditches, <br/>
never read about it, is less valid than mine.  But my opinion is way less <br/>
valid than a hydro engineer&#39;s or an agricultural professor who has studied <br/>
irrigation IF the topic is irrigation!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone I know knows more than I do about something.  But if they want <br/>
information about playing recorder, for example, most of them will come to <br/>
me.  And there are a few people I would go to if I needed recorder help, or <br/>
if I didn&#39;t know an answer, I&#39;d refer the people to those I know are more <br/>
knowledgeable or experienced than I am.<br/>
<br/>
The opinon of someone who just picked up a recorder yesterday is not as valid <br/>
as mine as regards recorders.  As regards the stock market or transmission <br/>
repair or smoking salmon, I&#39;d guess sight unseen they easily knew more than I <br/>
did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100135477">It seems to me (and my kids are pretty little now, but I&#39;ve had bigger <br/>
ones before) that it takes much more patience to deal with the demands <br/>
(not requests) of school--like getting everyone up and out on time with <br/>
all their stuff, doing stuff from school at home every night, meetings, <br/>
fundraisers, before and/or after school practices that have to be <br/>
scheduled around and remembered.<br/>
<br/>
Versus the patience I need when they wake me up early--1/2 hour AFTER <br/>
the school bus went by.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406823856">**but doesn&#39;t anyone here on the board do anything because <br/>
it truly is *better*?**<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m trying to completely stop eating trans-fats (partially<br/>
hydrogenated oils).  I think I need a support group for that because I&#39;m<br/>
really swimming against the tide when I&#39;m shopping at a conventional<br/>
grocery store.<br/>
