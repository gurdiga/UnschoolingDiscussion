<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697975578">I have really enjoyed reading everyone&#39;s posts about their unschooling. I have been smiling and nodding while reading, thinking, &quot;How fun!&quot;...&quot;Sounds like our house!&quot;...&quot;What a great idea!&quot; It has been very stimulating, and has really encouraged me to take a step back and look at what&#39;s going on at our house. It never fails to make me smile with gratitude, so thank you all for bringing helping me be more mindful of that by sharing your lives with me.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried a number of times to post a minute in our life, but I never quite finish the post before I have to go. Hopefully, this will be the one that gets through!&lt;g&gt; Right this minute (11:00am) all 3 kids are watching Drake & Josh on the Disney Channel. They are warming up after having been out on their new 14 foot trampoline that the grandparents gave them for Christmas. It&#39;s only about 45 degrees here, which may as well be sub zero for southern FL!!! Brrrrrr!!! I just figured out how to download a video to a site so that I can link it here. My oldest DS just made it. It&#39;s about half a minute showing what we&#39;ve been up to lately, at least the outside stuff. Of course it also showcases what oldest DS has been up to, that is learning how to use the movie editor on our computer. Hope you like it!<br/>

That is so cool!  I liked the color changes on the trampoline, and  <br/>
loved the sparklers.  Marty watched it over my shoulder and said  <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s Tom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had no idea there was a place like that where people could put  <br/>
little videos.  I LOVE THE WORLD I LIVE IN!<br/>

So cool!!  My boys loved it, can&#39;t wait to show it to the  oldest...they <br/>
said, &quot;He&#39;s gooood!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We got a new video camera and computer for Christmas, and we&#39;re still  <br/>
learning how to use it all.  Do you have a program you bought for your  computer for <br/>
editing the video/DVD, or did it come with the camera?  <br/>
 <br/>
Movies are a huge part of our life at our home, and the kids love doing  <br/>
their own skits and silly stuff...They once made an audio tape that was  <br/>
hilarious...full of farts and them laughing uncontrollably.  One of those  things where <br/>
their laughter is so genuine, you can&#39;t help but laugh yourself,  and it sort <br/>
of snowballs till everyone&#39;s hysterical.  I wish I had kept  it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763351969">Same here.  I think about when I grew up...cable tv was just beginning, <br/>
computers were huge things that you couldn&#39;t carry around, cell-phones <br/>
weren&#39;t even available to just anyone...and now :).  It&#39;s hard to imagine <br/>
not having even this list!  Homeschooling was even frowned upon then and it <br/>
really wasn&#39;t that long ago!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047476342">We had a BIG, big, long week, culminating in two birthday parties.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s excited about having found her MSN  because she downloaded a  <br/>
new one and accidentally didn&#39;t request an icon.  So she was  <br/>
frustrated half an hour ago but now she&#39;s excited.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is playing World of Warcraft, which he hardly did all week, but  <br/>
in half an hour we&#39;re going to watch 24 together.  (Holly will watch  <br/>
Desperate Housewives, and tell me what happened, and I&#39;ll read about  <br/>
it online and maybe download it, or wait for reruns.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty is in his room listening to Big and Rich, or Nickelback.  He  <br/>
went and bought a new CD of each.  And he bought a video game, some  <br/>
cowboy thing.  He used birthday money for all that.  He&#39;s on the  <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
Keith is watching a movie, or packing for a work trip.  I&#39;m doing the  <br/>
last two loads of laundry.  He needs one shirt that&#39;s in there, and  <br/>
most of the rest is towels and stuff.  Very routine.<br/>
<br/>
All last week Pam Sorooshian and her two younger girls were here.  We  <br/>
had all kinds of exhausting touristy fun and watched silly videos and  <br/>
played singing games.  And tomorrow, Keith&#39;s going to California for  <br/>
three days of meetings and will be near Pam&#39;s house.  The good thing  <br/>
is that he can take the things they left here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I came online to see whether a power cord thing I found went to  <br/>
Roxana&#39;s computer, but she says it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s probably Brett&#39;s  <br/>
phone charger.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s singing &quot;Something Tells Me I&#39;m into Something Good&quot; which is  <br/>
on her Christmas-gift Herman&#39;s Hermit&#39;s CD.  Marty just got  got a  <br/>
phone call from his friend Logan, who missed his birthday party.<br/>
<br/>
For our first relaxing night after a chaotic week, it sounds pretty  <br/>
busy, but it&#39;s peaceful (now that Holly&#39;s computer panic is over).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more than a minute, but it needed context.  Sorry I&#39;m messing up  <br/>
the pattern.  And from the time I started typing to the end, some  <br/>
things happened.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738090885">Dagny&#39;s up in her room.  Her new floor was finished today and she&#39;s putting<br/>
her room back together.  Actually, it&#39;s quiet up there, so she may be done<br/>
and I&#39;d bet she&#39;s on the computer talking to some of your kids :o).   Rowan<br/>
is sick and asked Jon to run a warm bath for her.  While she&#39;s waiting she&#39;s<br/>
turning a Girl Scout cookie box into a piggy bank.  She just asked me to<br/>
spell please.  Jon is playing video games - Halo, I think.  Up until a<br/>
minute ago I was knitting a baby blanket for my latest great-niece<br/>
or -nephew, but now I&#39;m sitting at the laptop on our living room couch with<br/>
my puppy on my lap.  Jon just called down that Rowan&#39;s bath is ready.  She<br/>
left her box here - it&#39;s got a sign taped to it with a cent symbol and the<br/>
word please, with an arrow pointing to the coin slot.  So I&#39;m off to find<br/>
some change :o).  ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
My son has been thinking about buying editing software for our <br/>
computer, but then he decided to check our computer to see what was <br/>
already on it. Amazingly, he was able to do this all with Windows <br/>
Movie Maker, which came with our computer. The clips were all taken <br/>
with our digital camera, which can take 30 seconds at a time. We <br/>
also got a video camera for Christmas, so once we become more <br/>
proficient with that, I expect the videos may get a little <br/>
lengthier.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228762502">The videos were very cool!  Thanks for sharing them!  I love our<br/>
technological world too.  It&#39;s so easy to connect with others and take a<br/>
peak into their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted in a long while about what we&#39;ve been up to.  Last summer<br/>
we got our second horse and after a while we realized she just wasn&#39;t going<br/>
to work out for Lilly, aged 9.  We listed her for sale all fall and recently<br/>
got an offer for a trade.  (Almost seemed too good to be true)<br/>
<br/>
The woman who came to see our horse said she had a horse that would be a<br/>
great confidence builder for Lilly and we went to see him.  He was sweet<br/>
although he was a little forward.  We took the barn owner back with us to<br/>
try him a second time and we decided that we would take him. &lt;shriek of<br/>
excitement&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lilly can handle him although she does need to build some trust with him so<br/>
that she knows he isn&#39;t going to buck her off like that last horse did.<br/>
He&#39;s been here for just over two days and he has just the sweetest<br/>
personality.   He really seems to love to interact with people and that is<br/>
just what Lilly hoped for.  He loves her kisses.<br/>
<br/>
The girls are off visiting friends for the day today but will be back in<br/>
time to help at the barn tonight.  It&#39;s what we all live for lately.  (I<br/>
mistyped LOVE for LIVE and really that&#39;s more appropriate...It&#39;s what we all<br/>
love for lately.)  <br/>
<br/>
My little girls are growing up.  They never used to like to go anywhere<br/>
without me.  Sometimes when I am watching them ride it blows me away to<br/>
realize that they&#39;ve gone from little babies to these competent horseback<br/>
riders in what seems like no time at all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After Kirby was driving and I no longer drove him to work and to  <br/>
karate, I really missed our time together.  About a year went by when  <br/>
we didn&#39;t have a regular shared thing.  Then he asked me to watch the  <br/>
second season of 24 with me; said I would really like it.<br/>
<br/>
In a way I don&#39;t like it.  I don&#39;t enjoy the adrenaline.  And now I  <br/>
see there&#39;s a regular aspect which is some parent being separated  <br/>
from his/her teenager who is afraid and in mortal danger.  That&#39;s  <br/>
rougher for me than for Kirby, I think.  And last night I missed  <br/>
Desperate Housewives (yeah, I really should set that VCR up now that  <br/>
the sun&#39;s shining again, but I bet I won&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
But...  Tonight again I&#39;ll sit with Kirby and we&#39;ll share two hours  <br/>
of drama, and have something shared to discuss.  It&#39;s good.  And  <br/>
Keifer Sutherland is great.  I also watch Commander in Chief, on  <br/>
which Donald Sutherland is a main character, and it&#39;s interesting to  <br/>
see the father in the son, and their similar expressions and movements.<br/>

In my family we decided we dislike watching 24 right before bedtime, we <br/>
just get far too wired from the tension.  (I said it, and spouse and kid <br/>
agreed that they feel the same sensations.)  So our group decision was <br/>
to wait and watch it in big gulps, probably in the daytime, when it <br/>
comes out on DVD.  (Another possibility would have been to time shift it.) <br/>
<br/>
I blundered into the second hour last night while channel surfing and <br/>
succumbed to the temptation to watch it.  (Now I have to not talk about it!)<br/>

recorded the previous seasons I&#39;d missed and would watch them every <br/>
Monday morning before the kids woke up... a few times Hayden would wake <br/>
up before the episodes were over and ask me not to delete them before he <br/>
watched them... then he began asking me to wake him up to watch with me, <br/>
when he tired of that, he asked for me to wait to watch them with him.  <br/>
The kids have not nearly been as excited about 24 as I am &lt;I&#39;ve got <br/>
Kiefer Fever, baaaaaad!!!!&gt; but when the big shocking deaths happened on <br/>
the first episode of this season, I called them both into the room to <br/>
mourn with me &lt;g&gt; Last night, we all curled up on the loveseat and <br/>
watched together; we all jump and squeal and cry together... it&#39;s <br/>
amazing!  (and *still* they don&#39;t mind going to scary LA, where all the <br/>
crazy 24 stuff happens)<br/>
