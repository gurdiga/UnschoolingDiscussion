<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104298620">**It&#39;s amazing how intolerent our society is towards<br/>
children and their emotions.**<br/>
<br/>
Oh -- I was thinking the same thing today.<br/>
<br/>
I was listening to Fresh Air on NPR.  Terri Gross was interviewing <br/>
Stephen King and asked him about painful medical procedures he had as a <br/>
child and as an adult.  As a child he was told that very painful things <br/>
&quot;wouldn&#39;t hurt&quot;.  As an adult, the doctor included him in more <br/>
discussions and even though he had extremely painful therapy after his <br/>
car accident, as an adult he didn&#39;t feel victimized in the same way he <br/>
did as a child.<br/>
