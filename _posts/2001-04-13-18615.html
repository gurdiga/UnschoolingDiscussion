<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373971715">I know we&#39;ve had some threads where we&#39;ve discussed sensitive <br/>
children. Perhaps this quote applies to some of you. I know it<br/>
applies to us (me, included).<br/>

~Nancy<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: <br/>
A human creature born abnormally, inhumanely sensitive. <br/>
<br/>
To him<br/>
a touch is a blow,<br/>
a sound is a noise,<br/>
a misfortune is a tragedy,<br/>
a joy is an ecstasy,<br/>
a friend is a lover,<br/>
a lover is a god, <br/>
a failure is death.<br/>
<br/>
Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to <br/>
create, create, create - so that without the creating of music or <br/>
poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath <br/>
is cut off from him. <br/>
<br/>
He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, <br/>
inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating.&quot;<br/>

My new favorite quote. <br/>
...one of them anyway. but right up there in the top 5<br/>
for sure! <br/>
beautiful!<br/>
I&#39;m going to use it next time someone says something<br/>
about my overly sensitive daughter...or my not quite<br/>
so sensitive - but still right up there (he cried for<br/>
a good while the other day cuz the video game<br/>
controller broke...one of his most prized posessions)<br/>
- son.<br/>
thanks so much for sharing.<br/>
-Bobbie<br/>
(who&#39;s a little overly sensitive at times<br/>
herself....but not as much as her little sister. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
