LOL!<br/>

Oh we&#39;ve done that before!!  I was supposed to visit with a friend in Phili.  But her whole family fell ill while we were in the city.  We were close enough to home that we could have gone home but somehow, I don&#39;t even remember how, we ended up staying with another family that we had met &quot;online&quot;.  We even had an offer from yet *another* family that we knew online.  (I think we had all agreed to meet at the Franklin Institute because that is where we met).<br/>
<br/>
We slept on her living room floor.  I have to confess, it was quite the adventure, staying at a stranger&#39;s house, sleeping on their floor!!!<br/>
<br/>
Someday I&#39;ll have to write a book about untraveling!!<br/>
