<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086762356">Have you heard that tampon makers include asbestos in<br/>
tampons? Why would they do this? Because asbestos makes you bleed <br/>
more...if you bleed more, you&#39;re going to need to use more. Why isn&#39;t <br/>
this against the law since asbestos is so dangerous? Because the <br/>
powers that be, in all their wisdom (not), did not consider tampons <br/>
as being ingested, and<br/>
therefore wasn&#39;t illegal or considered dangerous. <br/>
A woman getting her Ph.D. at University of Colorado,<br/>
Boulder sent the following: &quot;I am writing this because women are not <br/>
being informed about the dangers of something most of us use -- <br/>
tampons. I am taking a class this month and I have been learning a <br/>
lot about biology and women, including much about feminine hygiene.<br/>
<br/>
Recently we have learned that tampons are actually dangerous (for <br/>
other reasons than TSS). I&#39;ll tell you this, after learning about <br/>
this in our class, most of the females<br/>
wound up feeling angry and upset with the tampon industry,<br/>
and I for one, am going to do something about it. To start, I want to <br/>
inform everyone I can, and email is the fastest way that I know how. <br/>
Here is the scoop: Tampons contain two things that are potentially <br/>
harmful: Rayon (for absorbency), and<br/>
Dioxin (a chemical used in bleaching the products).<br/>
<br/>
The tampon industry is convinced that we, as women, need bleached<br/>
white products -- in order to view the product as pure and clean.<br/>
The problem here is that the dioxin produced in the<br/>
bleaching process can lead to very harmful problems for a woman. <br/>
Dioxin is potentially carcinogenic (cancer-associated) and is toxic <br/>
to the immune and reproductive systems. It has also been linked to <br/>
endometriosis and lower sperm counts for men -- for both, it breaks <br/>
down the immune system.<br/>
<br/>
Last September the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported <br/>
that there really is no set &quot;acceptable&quot; level of exposure to dioxin <br/>
given that it is cumulative and slow to disintegrate. The real danger <br/>
comes from repeated contact (Karen Hopper &quot;Pulling the Plug on the <br/>
Tampon Industry&quot;). I&#39;d say using about 4 - 5 tampons a day, five days <br/>
a month, for 38 menstruating years is &quot;repeated contact,&quot; wouldn&#39;t <br/>
you?<br/>
<br/>
Rayon contributes to the danger of tampons and dioxin<br/>
because it is a highly absorbent substance. Therefore, when fibers <br/>
from the tampons are left behind in the vagina (as usually occurs), <br/>
it creates a breeding ground for the dioxin. It also stays in a lot <br/>
longer than it wouldwith just cotton tampons. This is also the reason <br/>
why TSS (toxic shock syndrome) occurs.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES? Uing feminine hygiene products that aren&#39;t <br/>
bleached and that are all cotton. Other feminine hygiene<br/>
products(pads/napkins) contain dioxin as well, but they<br/>
are not nearly as dangerous since they are not in direct contact with <br/>
the vagina. The pads napkins need to stop being bleached, but <br/>
obviously tampons are the most dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
So, what can you do if you can&#39;t give up using tampons? Use tampons, <br/>
that are made from 100% cotton, and that are UNBLEACHED. <br/>
Unfortunately, there are very, very few companies that make these <br/>
safe tampons. They are usually only found in health food stores. <br/>
Countries all over the world (Sweden, Germany, British Columbia, <br/>
etc.) have demanded a switch to this safer tampon, while the US has <br/>
decided to keep us in the dark about it. In 1989, activists in <br/>
England mounted a campaign against chlorine bleaching. Six weeks and <br/>
50,000 letters later, the makers of sanitary products switched to <br/>
oxygen bleaching (one of the green methods available). (MS magazine, <br/>
May/June 1995.)<br/>
<br/>
WHAT TO DO NOW: Tell people. Everyone. Inform them. We are being<br/>
manipulated by this industry and the government. Let&#39;s do<br/>
something about it! Please write to the companies:<br/>
Tampax (Tambrands), Playtex, OB, Kotex. Call the 800 numbers listed <br/>
on the boxes. Let them know that we demand a<br/>
safe product - ALL COTTON UNBLEACHED TAMPONS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918050619">Urban legend.  They all have a tiny morsel of truth in them somewhere but<br/>
not quite as radical as they end up trailing across cyber-space.<br/>
<br/>
There were found trace amounts of asbestos in one batch a few years ago.<br/>
They were voluntarily recalled.  Something about remodeling a plant and the<br/>
stuff getting into the system.<br/>

The asbestos part may have been a hoax, however,
<br>I watched a program on either nova or 60 minutes or
<br>pbs, that covered the dangers to humans using bleached
<br>products.&nbsp; This program included the bleaching of tampons.
<br>They had biologist/scientist explain the mutations bleached
<br>products have caused which included human birth defects as
<br>well as mutations in frogs, etc where these chemicals were
<br>disposed.&nbsp; They covered lawsuits of dioxin-exposed workers
<br>and how the corporations will do anything to hide the lawsuits.
<br>I used to be the &quot;queen of bleach&quot;.&nbsp; I use it in the laundry and
<br>also for cleaning.&nbsp; After seeing that documentary I quit using
<br>bleach completely.&nbsp; I quit using tampons.&nbsp;&nbsp; It certainly
is worth
<br>looking into yourself.
