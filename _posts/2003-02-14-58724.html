<br/>
We just got this particular WofOz tape from half.com.  It was the 50th <br/>
anniversary edition and there was some footage at the end of the tape (home <br/>
movies and stuff) that was so sweet.  I&#39;m such a sucker for that stuff!  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter how many times I&#39;ve seen that movie; I still get a little <br/>
rush at the sound of the opening theme and there are parts that always <br/>
choke me up.  Goofy!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when Liam and I are out on a hike, we&#39;ll sing those three songs <br/>
(&quot;If I Only Had a Brain/a Heart/the Noive&quot;) followed by &quot;We&#39;re Off to See <br/>
the Wizard&quot; and we&#39;ll do the dance steps (complete with a few steps in the <br/>
wrong direction and the pointing thing).  What fun!<br/>

Thanks!  I don&#39;t want to DO it, but it does sound interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, they&#39;re saying it&#39;s not a lobotomy but could accidently become one! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&#92;When I was in the psych hospitals as a teen, one of the older nurses<br/>
explained to me, in great detail, how to do a lobotomy through the eye<br/>
socket, using nothing more than a poky metal probe thingy. Apprently they<br/>
used to do them assembly-line fashion, it&#39;s pretty easy to poke through<br/>
the top of the eye socket and then you just swish the probe around a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I think she was hoping I&#39;d decide to try it out on myself...<br/>
<br/>
I think trepanning is different, it&#39;s just making holes in the skull,<br/>
rather than scrambling the frontal lobe. It was considered a legitimate<br/>
medical treatment like 100 years ago.<br/>
