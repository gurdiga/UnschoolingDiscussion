&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve often been criticized, lectured, and sneered at for what I believe, <br/>
but <br/>
rarely let it effect me.  But the funny thing is, many of the people who have <br/>
done this, eventually tell me that my children are considerably &quot;brighter,&quot; <br/>
and &quot;more socially well behaved&quot; than the majority of other kids they have <br/>
come <br/>
across.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That happens with our family too.  <br/>
<br/>
The same people who thought we were clueless when our kids were young  now <br/>
GUSH about them, and I feel like The Little Red Hen.  <br/>
<br/>
Generally I hate the story of The Little Red Hen.  I get it, but it seems <br/>
harsh and cold.<br/>
<br/>
But when people who were once close with us but who fell away and were snarky <br/>
when our kids were six now go all glowy about how great they are as teens, I <br/>
feel like saying &quot;You could&#39;ve seen this unfold if you hadn&#39;t been so <br/>
pointedly looking the other way and badmouthing us, so shove off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just me, and my immediate loaf of bread, as it were.<br/>
<br/>
What I DO feel good about in those instances is that those same formerly <br/>
judgmental others (many of them childless, some who would have liked to have had <br/>
children but couldn&#39;t/didn&#39;t) will be much MORE accepting of the next <br/>
attachment parenting or unschooling family they come across.<br/>
<br/>
What bugs me is when they try to get in for the photo-op (if there were one,  <br/>
you know what I mean) by saying, &quot;OH, I&#39;ve known Kirby since he was born!&quot; or <br/>
&quot;I used to babysit Marty&quot; like that gives them partial credit for the success.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been mean to them but I&#39;ve thought negative thoughts about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391281883">I can say that no one, not family or friends, have fallen away because they<br/>
didn&#39;t agree with our lifestyle. We gets &quot;tsk, tsk&quot; and other comments but<br/>
we are basically supported(no one knows we are unschooling though, they<br/>
think we do &quot;sit down work&quot; but I still believe we wouldn&#39;t lose any friends<br/>
over it) How sad that your family was treated that way! And then they want<br/>
to get in on the glory when it turns out your kids turned out so well! The<br/>
nerve...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m never mean either.  In the beginning, I would really let it get to me <br/>
though, and let it second guess my beliefs, but over the past nine years, I&#39;ve <br/>
come to the conclusion that it doesn&#39;t matter.  My children are what they are, <br/>
and they are GOOD people.  I don&#39;t necessarily take full credit for it, but I <br/>
do realize that the fact that I let them be who they are, is what gives them <br/>
the confidence to continue.  Of course I try to stress good behavior in them, <br/>
but my manner in doing this is to talk to them.  Talk to them about feelings, <br/>
talk to them about cause/effect.  Such as... when you do &#39;abc&#39;, what do you <br/>
think happens and who do you think it happens too?  Why do you think things <br/>
happens that way?   It helps them keep aware that the things they do and say can and <br/>
do have direct effects to others around them.  <br/>
Rather than hollowly saying things such as &quot;Don&#39;t talk that way, or, don&#39;t do <br/>
that&quot;  I just imagine they are thinking &quot;Don&#39;t talk what way?  All I said is <br/>
*********&quot;  Know what I mean???  I just have vivid memories of feeling those <br/>
ways when I was a kid.  From before I ever had children, I always felt I want <br/>
them to know and feel that they are people too, not some alien life forms known <br/>
as children, who magically *turn* humans at the age of 18!!!!<br/>
If this thought and life style brings criticism from others...well, so be it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778062422">I had the best thing happen to me a while back;<br/>
<br/>
A friend at the time came to live with me and after watching from the <br/>
inside full time how I parent my daughter she said this &quot;I used to <br/>
think when interacting with your daughter that if only you would do <br/>
this or that she wouldn&#39;t do some of the things I found annoying. I <br/>
assumed you were letting her get away with things and that&#39;s why she <br/>
did them or if you did what I thought you should she would change. <br/>
But now living with you I see how much you parent and how much work <br/>
you are doing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised that anyone I knew might have been judging my life <br/>
(ok silly naive me), appreciative that she had at least kept her <br/>
opinions to herself before hand, and thrilled that having gotten <br/>
closer to us she had seen with her own eyes what she needed to see <br/>
all without any input from me.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes feel sorry for people who judge or put down others but <br/>
mostly I just feel secure in the fact that I am doing what is right <br/>
for me each step of the way wether others understand that/me or not. <br/>
