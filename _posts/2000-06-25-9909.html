&gt; &gt; recipes???  huh~huh???  mmmmm, these sound wonderful and I&#39;m always on<br/>

&gt; &gt; Pris ~&gt; who&#39;z just drooling @ her puter cuz her garden is LOADED w/<br/>
zucchini<br/>
&gt; &gt; :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For zucchini bread, cake and cookies simply follow one for carrot bread,<br/>
&gt; cake or cookies substituting zucchini.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The zucchini marmalade I&#39;m trying to hunt down after buying some at a<br/>
&gt; local church bazzar. I think I found one in a library cook book last<br/>
&gt; year so I&#39;ll have to cruise the cookbook shelves there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other one (for the pasta) I&#39;ll have to hunt through my veggie cook<br/>
&gt; books to find it but when I do find it I&#39;ll post it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is one from the top of my head though ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Instant Zucchini side dish ...<br/>
&gt; Saut√© 2 cups of shedded zucchini in a few tables spoons full of olive<br/>
&gt; oil that you&#39;ve flavoured with garlic. Takes about 7-8 minutes. </span></blockquote></div>
