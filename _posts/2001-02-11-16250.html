<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393874240">Lynda again on this subject.<br/>
There is a difference in semi-automatic and fully automatic guns; ALL fully<br/>
automatic guns are banned. Having a choice of a weapon for our own<br/>
self-defense or hunting is a preference, if we want a semi-automatic pistol,<br/>
a revolver or a shotgun. One is no more &#39;evil&#39; than the other..its just a<br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
Making the victim of a burglary responsible for the criminals &#39;next&#39; crime<br/>
is shifting the responsibility for that crime. That&#39;s just like trying to<br/>
make the gun manufacturer responsible for all crimes and accidents committed<br/>
with guns.<br/>
I see this as the line of reasoning used, to try to make the &#39;gun&#39;<br/>
responsible and not &#39;people&#39; for their own actions. This is a tactic to ban<br/>
guns.<br/>
<br/>
The police would not sell a weapon that has already been banned. If the<br/>
police are selling it &#39;legally&#39; and those guns are then getting in the hands<br/>
of felons, then somebody else must have sold it to them &#39;illegally&#39;.. and<br/>
should be prosecuted.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the waiting period.. criminals are going to get their guns<br/>
illegally anyway. Most states do have a waiting period on handguns.<br/>
<br/>
And if some drunk steals your car and then injures or kills another while<br/>
driving it, are YOU also responsible? This seems to be your line of<br/>
reasoning.<br/>

Coming from England as I do, can someone tell me the difference between
all this stuff. I guess a shotgun is one of the long ones and a revolver
is a small black handgun like the FBI carry in films?

We&#39;re moving the States soon and the gun thing has worried me slightly.
Do Americans habitually carry them around or kepp them locked up?
<br>I might learn to shoot (I do archery already) but wont be allowed to
keep one as an alien.
<br>As a matter of interest, do all american&#39;s &#39;hunt&#39; ie. Go out and shoot
food or non-food animals? Why?

<p><br>I assume shotguns are what the aristocracy over here use for game
bird shooting. Not being posh means I don&#39;t really know. Common people
don&#39;t get invited :)
<br>We don&#39;t have skeets. Whatever they are.
<br>Very few people shoot over here. Farmers may carry a gun to take out
rabbits and things and I mentioned organised hunts. There are gun clubs.
People now have to leave there guns there AFAIK under lock and key. I would
imagine that over here (in the UK), if you have a gun in your house it&#39;s
cos you&#39;re a criminal.
<br>Once I get to the states I&#39;d best be polite about telling the neighbours
to turn down their music or whatever :)
