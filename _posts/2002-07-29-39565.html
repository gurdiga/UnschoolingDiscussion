feel like I have to prove to him, and others that question this life<br/>
choice, that unschooling will be successful by the end of the next school<br/>
year.  I tried to explain to him about child-led learning, and that<br/>
&quot;education&quot; doesn&#39;t have to exist solely within the parameters of the<br/>
public education curriculum, but this is hard for him to wrap his brain<br/>
around.  I am wondering if anyone knows of a good &quot;one stop shopping&quot;<br/>
resource for him to get a clearer picture of what we are about to embark<br/>
on.  Unfortunately he is an orthopedic surgery resident so any spare time<br/>
he has he&#39;s usually reading his medical books.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for<br/>
a concise, informative, unschooling read that he could get through quickly,<br/>
transforming him into an unschooling advocate (I can dream, I always tell<br/>
him). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959785322">Hi Wendy!  <br/>
<br/>
Sue from the NNNetwork here! I&#39;ve been lurking here too! We too have <br/>
a kindergarten age child, whom we have been unschooling for the past <br/>
5 1/2 years, :-), and i found that to convince my husband about the <br/>
benefits of unschooling, the easiest thing to do was to compare their <br/>
learning to a baby learning to walk, talk, etc. You don&#39;t have <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; those things, children learn them when they are ready. The <br/>
same with everything else in life, children will learn it when they <br/>
are ready to learn it!  Also &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; by Gatto is quick read <br/>
and very convincing! All I had to do was read my dh a few paragraphs <br/>
and he was agreeing with me. Hope that helps you somewhat! And hope <br/>
to see you soon at a playgroup! Now time to delurk myself....:-)<br/>
<br/>
Sue<br/>
