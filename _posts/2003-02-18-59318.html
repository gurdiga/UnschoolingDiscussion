<div id="ygrps-yiv-694587178">I love that quote.  Which old song did it come from?  Can I quote it in <br/>
our local newsletter?  I think it is good that we discuss labels from <br/>
time to time.  We all face them. I can brush them off, but once in a <br/>
while I go to period where the labels get to me and I start wondering <br/>
where I  belong.   I think I&#39;ll post that old song on my frig...<br/>

&gt;p.s. The subject line got that old song stuck in my brain again...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Labels are good for canned goods,<br/>
&gt;so you don&#39;t mistake the spinach for the beans<br/>
&gt;but the people that your meetin&#39;<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t the same as food you&#39;re eatin&#39;<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t put labels on my friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981938262">OK, things are slow here, and I have managed to stay through loads of posts<br/>
this time, so an introduction is probably due.  I have been here this time<br/>
since Nov., but I have dropped in  a couple times over the years and then<br/>
left due to the volume of mail and what I felt at the time was the tone of<br/>
the list. (I will address that below)  <br/>
 <br/>
I live with my dh of 15 years (when he isn&#39;t on the road) and my two dd&#39;s<br/>
Leigh (8) and Lilly (6) in Maine.  I began my parenting journey by following<br/>
my heart which I eventually found out was attachment parenting.   I have<br/>
learned so much about parenting from on-line communities and books though<br/>
and I continue to try to improve my parenting and myself all the time.  I am<br/>
not a perfect parent, but a work in progress and I am very happy with my<br/>
progress.  :0)  <br/>
 <br/>
I discovered unschooling about a year before my oldest was school aged.  I<br/>
figured it was what we had always done so in one aspect it was easy to<br/>
continue.  The hardest part was telling the relatives that I was<br/>
homeschooling, but we haven&#39;t looked back since.  Last year when we had our<br/>
first annual review by a certified teacher, I was pretty nervous, but with<br/>
the help of a couple unschooling lists, I got through it.  Yeah!!  :0)  <br/>
 <br/>
Lilly (6) is into writing stories or recording them for me to type.  She is<br/>
very long winded (some of her stories are ten chapters long) and her stories<br/>
are wonderful.  She is very imaginative and wants to publish her stories.<br/>
She loves to swim and ride horses and listen to me read aloud.  She likes to<br/>
cross country ski, ice skate, and snow shoe.  She is funny and sweet and<br/>
sensitive.<br/>
 <br/>
Leigh (8) loves to ride horses and play with her sister or friends.  She<br/>
loves board games and card games, listening to me read aloud, helping Lilly<br/>
type her stories and spell some of the words, she also loves geography and<br/>
has since she was about 4.  She is a wonder with a globe.  She also loves to<br/>
swim.  She likes to cross country ski, ice skate, and snow shoe.  She is<br/>
very sensitive and loving and love to be with me.  <br/>
 <br/>
I like to knit esp. with wool or mohair.  I love to read non-fiction and an<br/>
occasional fiction book.  I enjoy baking bread and eating it and it shows.<br/>
:0)  I enjoy cross country skiing, snow shoeing, sliding with the kids, and<br/>
ice-skating.  I enjoy being part of email lists and emailing friends.  I<br/>
enjoy journaling, when I remember to do it.  I enjoy swimming and I enjoy<br/>
reading or watching shows about history, esp. the history of our country.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have come to this list a few times over the last couple of years thinking<br/>
it was a support list.  I felt like the list as a whole was too rough on new<br/>
people and that the tone of the list was negative.  I didn&#39;t understand what<br/>
you were trying to do here, but now I get it!!  (happy dance!)  I think I<br/>
have come far enough in my unschooling journey/non-coercive parenting<br/>
journey that in order to continue to grow, I need what this list<br/>
provides...the tearing apart of ideas and discussing them in every detail.<br/>
It really helps me to reflect on why I do the things I do and how I can<br/>
change to become a better person and parent. (and I can see now that the<br/>
list mostly sticks to tearing apart the issues, not the parents)  I most<br/>
definitely didn&#39;t understand you at first, Sandra.  But upon reading your<br/>
name all over the web again and again, I kept thinking that if so many<br/>
people have benefited from your ideas and love you, then you must have<br/>
something to share that is worth reading.  I tried the list once again and<br/>
this time I *got* it.  You really get people to think.  (I like that!)  And<br/>
the list is not a support group, but a place that tries to uphold the<br/>
definition of unschooling so that people don&#39;t get confused about what<br/>
defines unschooling. (at least on this list.)<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you.  I look forward to continuing to participate here.<br/>
