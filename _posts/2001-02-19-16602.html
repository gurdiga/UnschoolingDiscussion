<br>Well, we&#39;re not lawyers we only play them on TV! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;But I would hope the 
<br>schools have better things to do.
<br>
<br>You could start with the state regs at www.nhen.org.
<br>
<br>They also have a page for new hsers.
<br>
<br>If I were moving and my children attended ps, I wouldn&#39;t notify the old 
<br>school of my new address, I would notify the new school. &nbsp;That would make 
<br>sense to me if they were continuing with ps. &nbsp;Why wouldn&#39;t it be the same 
<br>with hs? &nbsp;You move mid-year so you notify mid-year. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Good luck.

We probably know more about homeschooling laws than all but a very few <br/>
lawyers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t get arrested for not sending kids to school unless you ignore <br/>
requests for information and lock social workers out, ignore a court order <br/>
and stick a gun out the window.      And long before all THOSE steps, you can <br/>
register to as homeschoolers and have done with it.<br/>

    Julie. I live in Tacoma, WA.&nbsp;The law here is you need to give a 
    declaration of intent to the local school dist if your child is age 8 or 
    over. Sometimes the local schools will try something tricky and add things 
    to the declaration. Make sure you&#39;re filling out the real 
    thing.</span></font></tt></div>

    sure there&#39;s plenty of underground, unregistered homeschoolers around. No 
    one has ever asked me to produce my declaration. If I want a homeschooler 
    discount, I just say I homeschooling and they say, okay. For resources like 
    using school facilities, you&#39;d probably have to show your declaration. 
    Unless you are with a recognized hs group, like 4-H or the local support 
    group. And with these, I&#39;ve never been asked to prove my legal status, 
    either.</span></font></tt></div>

    declared your child or not. But I&#39;ve never heard of anyone around here being

    another thing, but since you&#39;re coming in from out-of-state, that wouldn&#39;t 
    apply.</span></font></tt></div>

even had to show my declaration of Intent when my teenager was taking advantage

it.</font></div>
