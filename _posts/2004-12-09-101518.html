<div id="ygrps-yiv-165124563">Someone wrote that her kids didn&#39;t want Calvert, they wanted to unschool.<br/>
For that to work the mother really  needs to become an unschooler herself.  A <br/>
recent Calvert Curriculum purchase is not a good sign of understanding and <br/>
believing that natural learning can work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-. Any ideas on how to mend my evil ways?-=-<br/>
<br/>
LOTS.  I&#39;ve collected the ideas of many moms who wrote at crucial moments in <br/>
their growing awareness.  Two good starting places:<br/>

-=-I really never meant to create this atmosphere. Will time help the <br/>
situation if I just stop acting that way or should I make amends somehow?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Time will heal the situation sooner if you make amends.  At least tell him <br/>
you&#39;re changing your beliefs.  But then work to change them steadily and <br/>
directly toward your goal.  Saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry I did that&quot; to a kid is invaluable in <br/>
nurturing an authentic relationship with him as a whole human.  Not a mom/kid <br/>
relationship, but a person to person relationship.  Would you say &#39;sorry&#39; to a <br/>
friend you had wronged?  Would you try to make it up to a friend if you had <br/>
done something you regretted?  Treating children like friends is a big move in a <br/>
good direction.<br/>

<br/>
How about bringing out snacks during cartoon or game time and smiling <br/>
approvingly?  (If it isn&#39;t fake.)<br/>
