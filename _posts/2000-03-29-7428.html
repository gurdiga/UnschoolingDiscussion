<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe the Bob books come 12 in set 1 and 8 books each in sets 2 and 3. I <br/>
found a Scholastic catalog with the books in them for $14.95 each set plus <br/>
shipping. It was in the Supplementary Materials 2000 catalog. You can call <br/>
them at 1-800-scholastic and ask for a catalog. Someone correct me if I&#39;m <br/>
wrong, though. I don&#39;t have the Bob books yet but I have been searching for <br/>
some. <br/>
You could also try the veg board. I know people sell them once in awhile on <br/>
there.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that they are really neat books!  <br/>
