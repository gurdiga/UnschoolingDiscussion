spend or save as he chooses?  Would he like helping you clip coupons; maybe<br/>
he could add up the money saved and he could have it.<br/>
<br/>

When they ask for something when you&#39;re shopping, do you discuss how much it<br/>
costs and whether it might fit your family budget this month?  Do you go to<br/>
thrift shops and have fun seeing what you can buy for a dollar?  Do you walk<br/>
around Wal Mart (or expensive department stores) and laugh at the things<br/>
you&#39;d never want and how much money you save by not buying these silly<br/>
things?  <br/>

stick-in-the-mud, I start looking at when we last went someplace really fun<br/>
like the swimming pool with big water slide, the zoo, the toy store to look<br/>
at the new legos, etc.  Sometimes we just have a picnic so I feel like I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten out.  But we do that maybe once a week or so.  You don&#39;t have to be<br/>
an entertainment service, either.  If they were unhappy playing lots of<br/>

<br/>
Finally, one of my unschooling &quot;duh&quot; moments came when I realized that my<br/>
son spends a lot of time &quot;just hanging around&quot; because he HAS a lot of time<br/>
to just hang around.  If he went to school, he&#39;d spend a lot of time &quot;just<br/>
sitting around&quot; waiting for a teacher, the other kids, etc.  I figure he&#39;s<br/>
better off hanging around my house than a classroom.  Kids are pretty good<br/>
at letting us know when they need more going on.<br/>
<br/>
Relax, enjoy, and talk to yourself more!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-213618083">Brenda,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your great ideas.  No, I don&#39;t think I do <br/>
enough of those things.  We do a number of them but I am trying to <br/>
add more into our daily lives.  Keiran has never been very interested <br/>
in art so sometimes I offer but he always turns me down. Maybe, I <br/>
need to rethink how to introduce different things to him to see if I <br/>
could get his interest.  Sometimes, he needs a little push.  Like <br/>
this morning, I offered to let him listen to a book on tape we got <br/>
from the library.  Of course, his response was no.  I put it on <br/>
anyway while he played and said we would try it for a while.  One <br/>
minute later, &quot;I don&#39;t like it&quot;.  SO I said a little longer, went <br/>
back in 20 minutes later and he was laughing and enjoying it.  He <br/>
plays with his action figures while its on so it does not stop his <br/>
play, but I am hoping to instill an interst in literature.  I figure <br/>
there is no better way to learn to read then to have an interest in <br/>
books.  We do read all the time so I know that will come.  His <br/>
attitude with the book is sometimes how he is with alot of things.  <br/>
He shows little interest but once we get going he really has a great <br/>
time.  So I am working on that balance with him, to give a little <br/>
shove without pushing what I think his interests should be on him.<br/>
<br/>
Olga :)<br/>

Instead of &quot;introducing different things,&quot; why not just get different things <br/>
or do different things.  Why does he have to be the target and you the <br/>
&quot;shootist&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
There are things my kids love that nobody noticed the first month or year <br/>
they were in the house.  I just cycled through things until one day one would <br/>
spark an interest.  A few never did.  Some were so great we bought a second <br/>
thing/set or replaced it as soon as it broke.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of these whatever-things (games, toys, art supplies, books, computer <br/>
programs, yard toys, oddities) were used, from thrift stores or garage sales.  <br/>
Some were new from dollar stores.  Some were new from top-price educational <br/>
supply houses.  It didn&#39;t make any difference as to their appeal or value.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;but I am hoping to instill an interst in literature&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See?  It wasn&#39;t my imagination.  You&#39;re seeing him as a vessel and you want <br/>
to INSTALL something.  &quot;Instill&quot; you said, but it did sound like you had put an <br/>
installation on your mental checklist. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  **Maybe, I <br/>

<br/>
  What about going with what he is interested in.<br/>
<br/>
  This sounds alot like my son.   He has never had a whole lot of time for arts and crafts. For example, like when he was in preschool,  &quot;here kids, lets paint&quot;  well,  Alec would slap some paint on there and he&#39;d be done.   He&#39;d be off to the sand box.  (Creating something there, situations, events; but some wouldn&#39;t consider that art.)<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve learned to stop introducing things that I think he should be doing.  Now I try to find things that add to what he is doing.   Like right now he loves video games so we went out and got a game link for his gameboy.   Game links are great because you can transfer info from one game to another.  Like info from Ruby version to Sapphire.   I even think that&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I also look at it like no one forces me to work on my car.  It would maybe make me more of a *rounded* individual, learning more mechanical things, but I really don&#39;t want to!   Or I don&#39;t try and convince my husband to help me plant things.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy it.  <br/>
<br/>
  I want to feed my kids interests,  nurture them.  If I start putting certain guidelines or required subjects on them,  they might as well be in school.   We can leave those subjects and requirements behind! <br/>
<br/>
  I think the more we push on our children what we think they should be doing; the farther they grow away from what their true passions are.    They will forget their true selves and lose that innate drive of what makes them happy.<br/>

Thanks for this response.  We have been trying to let him do his own <br/>
thing and you are right I need to go with the flow of his interests.  <br/>
Obviously, I am still caught in that idea of well-rounded knowledge <br/>

&gt; love books and reading.  Fact is he enjoys it on his own, although he <br/>
&gt; did get into the book on tape for a while and wants to listen to the <br/>
&gt; rest when he goes to bed.  We will see if that holds up tonight &lt;g&gt;, <br/>
&gt; he will probably say no and make a liar out of me ..LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t ask him, If it looks like you want him to he may not. Can he run <br/>
it him self?<br/>
Can you have the tapes/CD&#39;s where he can get them and do it himself?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419881988">From: &quot;Alan & Brenda Leonard&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abtleo@...">abtleo@...</a>&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;At this age, Olga, I don&#39;t see that necessarily as a bad thing!  Do you<br/>
play<br/>
with them sometimes, getting down on the floor and all?  Do they play<br/>
outside now that the weather is getting nicer?  Do they have friends who<br/>
join in their play sometimes and bring fresh ideas?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids do a lot of play inside with their toys. I&#39;m also very fortunate<br/>
that they have each other and get along as they do. Plus we get together<br/>
with other kids once a week. When it&#39;s not summer, it&#39;s twice a week<br/>
generally. Some times more often than that but not usually less unless<br/>
someone is sick. They also have the backyard with swing set, sandbox and<br/>
pool. We take walks arounf the neighborhood or just go to the park<br/>
ourselves. My kids always find someone else to play with. I&#39;m also lucky<br/>
that pretty much all year round my kids can out and play if they want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Do you have art supplies around, available to them&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not realy crafty at all. But I keep one whole cupboard full of creative<br/>
things for the kids. They can get to it themselves. We have a felt board<br/>
with all kinds of felt objects I made for them. Playdough, paper, markers,<br/>
pencils, crayons, paints, yarn, pipecleaners, glues, scissors, fake eyes,<br/>
pom poms, stencils and I&#39;m sure more. Being that it&#39;s right there for them<br/>
to use, they often do all sorts of things without me suggesting anything. If<br/>
I come across something on the net, or like at holiday times I&#39;ll go<br/>
searching for cute little things to make, I&#39;ll ask and see if the want to do<br/>
it. I must admit that last Christmas I had a wonderful time with the kids<br/>
watching them make snowdomes and ornaments of all kinds. I even joined in<br/>
and made some of my own. Not bad for a craft handicapped person!<br/>

<br/>
Identify what you are scared of.  Sometimes I get wierd anxious moments, and <br/>
you know what it turns out to be *every time*?  Someone else&#39;s fear, or <br/>
anxiety, NOT mine.  <br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t say that will be true of you as well, but it could very well be.  <br/>
