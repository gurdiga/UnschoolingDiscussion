<div id="ygrps-yiv-773928337">&lt;&lt; Children ask zillions of questions, and yet they&#39;ll never ask about<br/>
everything.  They need to have all sorts of things pointed out to them and<br/>
discussed around them so that they have some idea what *can* be asked about. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For example:<br/>
&lt;&lt; Mars was easy to spot because it was so<br/>
<br/>
much larger than all the other stars (I know Mars is a planet and not a<br/>
<br/>
star) and it was actually red!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to wait for my child to discover Mars on his own!  My husband <br/>
has always been interested in astronomy.   He points these things out to us all <br/>
the time.  His dad did it for him.   Nobody&#39;s ever forced anyone else to look <br/>
up or care, but we&#39;ve had LOTS of times when other people were over too, and <br/>
most or all would go out and let Keith tell them what was cool to see that <br/>
night.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve driven 50 miles to get past clouds to see meteors and moonrises.  We&#39;ve <br/>
played with eclipses all kinds of ways.<br/>
<br/>
It would be kind of sadistic not to tell a kid when something cool is going <br/>
to happen that won&#39;t happen again for years (if ever in his lifetime).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you have kids?  Do your kids think in these deep philosophical ways?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That question wasn&#39;t to me, but my kids are deep philosophical thinkers AND <br/>
comedians, and those two things often come together.  <br/>

<br/>
Exactly.  I saw something about Mars being close to Earth on a few lists and<br/>
I thought it would be interesting so I looked for it.  I would not have<br/>
known about it if someone didn&#39;t post it somewhere.   Sure, I could have<br/>
looked up on the one day it wasn&#39;t cloudy around here and discovered it<br/>
myself but I doubt I wouldn&#39;t have because I&#39;m not usually out at night.<br/>

across several towns. Sizes of the planets are shown in human sizes. Heres the <br/>
