<div id="ygrps-yiv-166797093">My daughter is 14 and has been vegan for about a year.  When she first started we read books and websites and figured out how much protein she needed to eat in a day, and what good sources of protein were.  She has been fairly good about that, eats a wide variety of foods, and has been healthy and growing normally.<br/>
<br/>
We go shopping every week at Whole Foods and she stocks up on a variety of foods, and I always remind her to get the protein-rich foods.  Unfortunately she hates tofu, even disguised, and soy milk.  While I see what we buy every week, I don&#39;t monitor what she eats and when she eats it.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight she said she felt a little off, a bit fuzzy, kind of blah.  I asked (amongst other things) if she had been eating enough protein recently.  She said &#39;probably not.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to take over and start controlling her eating, but I am concerned if she doesn&#39;t eat properly it will affect her health and her growth.  I do touch base with her during the day and check that she&#39;s eaten enough, or make suggestions when she says she&#39;s hungry but can&#39;t think of what to eat.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I would try making sure there are some bowls (or ziploc baggies) of nuts set <br/>
around for her, or like prepped trail mix which I&#39;m sure you can make or get <br/>
perfectly vegan. Stuff that she can just graze on almost without thinking <br/>
about having to prepare something or stop what she&#39;s doing right at that <br/>
moment. Certainly she could put that in her bag when going out, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386581160">I love the idea of making up trail mix baggies and tossing them w/ her when she runs out!  I used to do this for myself after a trip to the bulk section (putting a serving size into baggies and taking one w/ me each day to work for a morning snack.)  I find, esp. when I&#39;m on the run, that if I *don&#39;t* pack some sort of food that is easily and readily accessible, I am likely to ignore my hunger until I feel faint, leading to me usually binging on the first edible and easy to reach food I find (like a bag of chips, etc.)  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe check out the work of Dr. Joel Fuhrman to learn more about vegan nutrition.  I&#39;ve heard his book &quot;DiseaseProof Your Child&quot; recommended in many a vegan discussion on various food lists for ideas of how to ensure vegan children get all the nutrients/vitamins/etc. they need.  He has a website as well w/ articles and more... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drfuhrman.com/default.aspx">http://www.drfuhrman.com/default.aspx</a>  Perhaps there you might find more ideas of high-energy/nutrient-rich vegan foods to prepare for her when she&#39;s on the go?  (Disclaimer: I am not vegan and have not read Fuhrman&#39;s work, but have heard him/his work spoken of highly by multiple vegan parents.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve found joining yahoo groups that focus on recipes very helpful in creating variety and yumminess in our meals--perhaps joining a vegan list might give you more ideas of foods to prepare for her as well?   (Mmmm--just made this pine-nut ricotta lasagna tonight after seeing it recommended on a list: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bookofyum.com/blog/soy-free-dairy-free-but-still-decadent-cheesy-spinach-lasagna-366.html">http://www.bookofyum.com/blog/soy-free-dairy-free-but-still-decadent-cheesy-spinach-lasagna-366.html</a>  We used a meat sauce, but it was delicious and absolutely can be made vegan!  Just wanted to throw that in there!)<br/>
<br/>
HTH!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ooo--this reminds me of my favorite quick and easy way to have a refreshing drink and consume greens--green smoothies.  Usually a mixture of some kind of liquid, fruit and greens, these are so quick to make (if you have a blender--my $20 one works fine for this purpose.) and I think easier to make and consume than even a simple green salad, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squidoo.com/greensmoothies">http://www.squidoo.com/greensmoothies</a><br/>
<br/>
My morning smoothie right now usually consists of 1 cup water, 1 banana, some blueberries, raspberries, 1 cup kale or other leafy greens, and 1/2 tbs. raw honey.  DS likes his w/ coconut milk, berries, honey and various salad greens.  SOOOO yummy and refreshing--and they can be poured into a thermos to be sipped on during the day (so maybe good for your dd when she&#39;s on the go!)  I know folks who add nut butters and extra fats like coconut oil as well...  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been drinking around 2-4 cups of these daily as the weather has gotten warmer and I don&#39;t want to turn on the oven.  Maybe I&#39;ll make one right now... ;)<br/>

<br/>
Vegan is not that big of a deal. I think you are over thinking things if you are worried about protein. It is very unlikely she is &quot;not getting enough protein.&quot; What you need to worry about is vitamin B12. Is she taking a multi-vitamin? If she&#39;s not I would suggest she take a vegetarian multi-vitamin.<br/>
<br/>
*We go shopping every week at Whole Foods and she stocks up on a variety of foods, and I always remind her to get the protein-rich foods.* <br/>
<br/>
I would go far as to say you don&#39;t need to do this. Why are you constantly reminding her? Why are you constantly questioning her throughout the day? <br/>
<br/>
* Unfortunately she hates tofu, even disguised, and soy milk. While I see what we buy every week, I don&#39;t monitor what she eats and when she eats it.*<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to eat tofu or drink soy milk to be a healthy vegan. :)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your daughter is not eating enough, in general. Do you have reason to be concerned about an eating disorder? If you say she eats a variety of foods and is generally healthy. So, it sounds like that is not the issue. <br/>
<br/>
I have often read articles about &quot;vegans&quot; dying or parents who are vegan and their infants die because of their vegan diet. However...usually upon closer inspection I find myself screaming &quot;they weren&#39;t vegan!&quot; I remember  reading a specific article about a family who&#39;s infant had died. It was blamed on the strict vegan diet of the parents. But also in the article it said the parents only fed the infant apple juice and soy milk! That&#39;s not vegan (well it is) but that most certainly would not be what is considered a &quot;vegan diet&quot; that is only feeding a kid apple juice and soy milk. It would be the equivalent of saying &quot;child dies from meat diet&quot; if you fed the baby only a teaspoon of meat a day. That particular child died of starvation. <br/>
<br/>
Okay...I guess the rant was to reassure you that your daughter is probably fine. I would make sure she is taking a supplement for the B12. Don&#39;t over think things on this and I would really try backing off her a bit. You say you don&#39;t monitor her but if you are constantly asking her about it...you really are. <br/>
<br/>
Have you explored the reasons your daughter has gone vegan? <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

You couldn&#39;t &quot;control&quot; her eating anyway.  If you&#39;ve helped her learn  <br/>
and if she has choices available, let it go.<br/>
Instead of talking, maybe set out some snacky foods.  Monkey platter.   <br/>
Don&#39;t talk about it, do it.<br/>
