<div id="ygrps-yiv-823803147">&lt;&lt;The only thing I&#39;ve ever seen described as a tract&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What we used to give out (not at Halloween) was a small booklet type thing<br/>
like a comic book.  One strip I remember from 30years ago was a man being<br/>
attacked by an intruder and dying.  He went to Hell with all sorts of demons<br/>
reaching for him.  Then they show the scenario again but when attacked the<br/>
man called out to Jesus.  He still died but went smiling into the &quot;light&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
I get mad about this stuff.  My older kids (9 and 12 at the time) were with<br/>
me at a stock show in Fort Worth.  We were unloading our animals and stuff,<br/>
making trips in and out of the show barn.  People always stop and ask<br/>
questions about the animals (it is kind of the tacit agreement, like leaving<br/>
your light on during Halloween) and the kids readily and happily answer<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
An older couple stopped and was talking to the kids about the goats etc. and<br/>
I went to get another load.  When I came back, this couple was reading from<br/>
the Bible to the kids and praying over them.  It pissed me off and I gently<br/>
sent them on their way.  Yuck!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782543863">&lt;&lt;then why make up some big baptized version of it at all?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because thats how all Christian holidays came into being.  Christmas is<br/>
Yule, when the Pagans celebrate the coming of the Sun God, born out of the<br/>
Mother who was impregnated by the Horned God.  Easter is the Pagan festival<br/>
of fertility, hence all the eggs.  All Saints Day or All Hallow&#39;s Day or Day<br/>
of the Dead (depending on your particular flavor of Christianity) is the<br/>
Pagan Samhain that celebrates the lowering of the veil between this world<br/>
and the spirit world.<br/>
<br/>
A fictional book that talks about some of this kind of stuff, using lots of<br/>
actual facts is &quot;The Davinci Code&quot;.  Good read and will give people a place<br/>
to start researching if this kind of thing actually interests them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; But TV is the tool people use to achieve that state, not the cause of<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unschooled kids don&#39;t need to watch TV to tune out the noise of the day.<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; &gt; if they do need that, then there&#39;s something wrong in the unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; environment that needs fixed! Unschooled kids watch TV because they want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; pay attention to a particular show not because they want to tune<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; &gt; out.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you, Joyce!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was getting a little worried &lt;g&gt; with this thread, because 15 yo ds<br/>
watches<br/>
&gt; quite a bit of TV, really.  Someone said the other day that tuning out is<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; sign of a problem (and you repeated it here).  That is what worried me.<br/>
Back<br/>
&gt; when he was in school, he used the TV to tune out on a disturbingly<br/>
regular<br/>
&gt; basis.  Now, after 2 years at home, he&#39;s started watching it more again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;m looking at what he&#39;s watching, and it&#39;s *stimulating* TV, for the<br/>
&gt; most part.  Not *tuning out* TV.  There really is a difference.  He&#39;s<br/>
getting a<br/>
&gt; lot of history, physics, mechanical engineering, biology, etc. with his TV<br/>
&gt; time.  And some pure entertainment, and I don&#39;t see anything wrong with<br/>
that,<br/>
&gt; either.  Science fiction shows and anime.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, today was the day.  I called Fisher&#39;s school principal and told<br/>
&gt; him we would be homeschooling, starting next week.  He&#39;s only got two<br/>
&gt; half-days of school left, since this is parent-teacher conference week<br/>
&gt; -- a chance to say good-bye.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that the wheels are in motion, I&#39;m surprised at how many fears are<br/>
&gt; surfacing for me.  I thought I felt very sure of this.  When we made<br/>
&gt; the decision to do it *now*, Fisher was feeling overscheduled and very<br/>
&gt; much wanted to do it.  Now his thoughts are turning to his nice<br/>
&gt; teachers and the things about school that he does like (recess, gym,<br/>
&gt; music &lt;g&gt;), and the fact that people there like him.  I know in the<br/>
&gt; long run this is the right thing, but the transition is feeling a<br/>
&gt; little dicey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll take any and all words of encouragement. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; I read in a book called One to One about homework help.  This was advice<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; parents who couldn&#39;t pull their kids out of school just yet (or ever<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; of custody agreements/disagreements or whathaveyou).  The author<br/>
recommends<br/>
&gt; actually *doing* the homework for the child!  What a brilliant idea.<br/>
Doing<br/>
&gt; the homework went along with making sure that your child understands that<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t think there&#39;s something wrong with him because he can&#39;t read or<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; the math.  What a great way to minimize the trauma of early schooling for<br/>
&gt; the child who just isn&#39;t ready.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not your situation, but your email made me think of it.<br/>

&gt;   Sandra, this is a great article! Can you explain the 2 things below<br/>
&gt; and where to get them? I am not familiar with them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - two or more matching geoboards and colored rubber bands (you could<br/>
&gt; &gt; get just<br/>
&gt; &gt; one, but then you can&#39;t copy each other&#39;s designs)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Cuisenaire rods if you can get them for less than full price (or if<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; rich), but don&#39;t worry about the &quot;real&quot; exercises<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

car..<br/>
&gt; running across big lawns,  dropping your candy,  all some common<br/>
&gt; pain-in-the-ass  things about door to door trick or treating in the<br/>
boondocks.   In town,<br/>
&gt; and in housing developments, folks do still go door to door, but there are<br/>

options<br/>
&gt; to country living trick or treating.<br/>

&gt; Think of it like diving into a swimming pool. You dread the initial plunge<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, today was the day.  I called Fisher&#39;s school principal and told<br/>
&gt; &gt; him we would be homeschooling, starting next week.  He&#39;s only got two<br/>
&gt; &gt; half-days of school left, since this is parent-teacher conference week<br/>
&gt; &gt; -- a chance to say good-bye.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now that the wheels are in motion, I&#39;m surprised at how many fears are<br/>
&gt; &gt; surfacing for me.  I thought I felt very sure of this.  When we made<br/>
&gt; &gt; the decision to do it *now*, Fisher was feeling overscheduled and very<br/>
&gt; &gt; much wanted to do it.  Now his thoughts are turning to his nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; teachers and the things about school that he does like (recess, gym,<br/>
&gt; &gt; music &lt;g&gt;), and the fact that people there like him.  I know in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; long run this is the right thing, but the transition is feeling a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little dicey.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll take any and all words of encouragement. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; I have obviously not been exposed to what some of you have experienced.  I<br/>
&gt; looked at the Chick tract site-never seen them before.  What we get around<br/>
here,<br/>
&gt; and it is the only thing I&#39;ve ever seen described as a tract, is a peice<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; paper the size of the candy with Jesus Loves You all over it in different<br/>
&gt; colors, and maybe a Scripture.  Always attached to the candy, so my<br/>
children have<br/>
&gt; never felt like they didn&#39;t get the &quot;deal&quot; they were supposed to get.  And<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve gotten more than candy-sometimes they get Halloween pencils, vampire<br/>
teeth,<br/>
&gt; coloring books, crackers, and spider rings.  Oh, yes, this year we got<br/>
&gt; eyeballs!  Please forgive my being so naive, I have just been so surprised<br/>
at the<br/>
&gt; reactions to this subject.  I would have never had a clue!  I&#39;m just not a<br/>
person<br/>
&gt; that wastes much time and energy on things I can&#39;t change.  And I hope no<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; takes that the wrong way.  That is just what works for me.<br/>

&gt;  if<br/>
&gt; someone really CARES to try to convert people, this is a<br/>
&gt; counterproductive way to do it because it is offensive to other<br/>
&gt; parents. I get it that they think they have this great gift - eternal<br/>
&gt; life - and they want to pass it on - but my point is that they are<br/>
&gt; hurting their own chances of passing it on when they hand out tracts to<br/>
&gt; trick-or-treaters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Totally agreed, Pam.  I believe the only true way to &quot;convert&quot; is to live<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; example.  I have a friend that people always ask her, &quot;why are you so full<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; joy&quot; and that opens up much more doors than anything else I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>

&gt; &quot;What a great way to minimize the trauma of early schooling for<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Funny that&#39;s what I did do for my kids for a long time. I was so angry at<br/>
the schools for sending home all this homework for young children. Like the<br/>
8 hours a day they had them wasn&#39;t enough. But once I gave them the option<br/>
to be at home and they decided to go back to school because they missed<br/>
their friends ( and honestly  I believe they are so brainwashed by school<br/>
and friends they truly believe they&#39;ll be stupid if they don&#39;t go) I started<br/>
to question what the right thing to do is. I mean helping them feels right<br/>
because I love them and want them to succeed at what&#39;s important to them,<br/>
but I also feel like an enabler at times. Enabling them to stay in a<br/>
situation that I don&#39;t think is all that healthy by not making them suffer<br/>
the consequences of either the hours of homework and the time it takes away<br/>
from family and friends or not doing it and dealing with the teacher<br/>
comments/punishements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The funny thing is they are slowly seeing that their sisters and brother<br/>
at home are learning the important things like reading and having a great<br/>
time all day too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I totally agree with what that author said for parents stuck sending their<br/>
kids to school. Why make a kid with no choice suffer any more then they have<br/>
to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the info.<br/>

&gt;   I read in a book called One to One about homework help.  This was advice<br/>
for<br/>
&gt;   parents who couldn&#39;t pull their kids out of school just yet (or ever<br/>
because<br/>
&gt;   of custody agreements/disagreements or whathaveyou).  The author<br/>
recommends<br/>
&gt;   actually *doing* the homework for the child!  What a brilliant idea.<br/>
Doing<br/>
&gt;   the homework went along with making sure that your child understands<br/>
that<br/>
&gt;   you don&#39;t think there&#39;s something wrong with him because he can&#39;t read<br/>
or do<br/>
&gt;   the math.  What a great way to minimize the trauma of early schooling<br/>
for<br/>
&gt;   the child who just isn&#39;t ready.<br/>

&gt; exploring feelings and thoughts and various points of view. I find it<br/>
&gt; fascinating how and why people believe what they do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the Christians that hand out these tracts do believe they&#39;re doing<br/>
&gt; good. They know, of course, that most of the tracts get thrown away, but<br/>
&gt; probably feel that if even one saves one person, then all was worth it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They are probably thinking most of the tracts have a neutral effect, and,<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; there are people who get angry about a tract, they were already angry.<br/>
Since<br/>
&gt; they can&#39;t see the negative effects -- the negative feelings towards<br/>
&gt; Christianity and their brand in particular that their approach<br/>
*creates* --,<br/>
&gt; and do see the positive effects of new faces turning up at church<br/>
&gt; occasionally, it seems like more good than harm is coming out of it.<br/>

&gt; Hey Amy! You&#39;re doing great, simply by taking this deep breath and<br/>
&gt; making that phone call.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now...hang out with your child. Don&#39;t worry about whether he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; learning or what...he IS, take it from me...and let him take the<br/>
&gt; lead. Enjoy him. It&#39;s like Julie S said...like diving in and the<br/>

&gt; But what if there&#39;s a physical sensitivity to sugar that interferes? You<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t suggest to an alcoholic that he just keep his glass filled till<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; was sick of it. I&#39;d really like to try the endless-supply candy idea, both<br/>
&gt; for myself and for my sons, but I&#39;m truly afraid that I just wouldn&#39;t<br/>
stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know the concept of sugar addiction is controversial, and I&#39;m certainly<br/>
&gt; not suggesting that it&#39;s an addiction the way alcoholism is, but I know I<br/>
&gt; react physically and psychologically to sugar in a way most people do not.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; candy will last for weeks. My younger son has eaten all his<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; have candy, I will eat it all at one sitting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You won&#39;t if there&#39;s more of it than you are physically capable of<br/>
&gt; &gt; eating. If you buy 14 bags of 1/2 price Halloween candy you won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; eat it all at one sitting. And if you somehow managed to, you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably be put off candy for a good long time. ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;If I have candy, I will eat it all at one sitting&quot; is one of those lies<br/>
&gt; &gt; we tell ourselves, and I think goes along the same lines of &quot;he<br/>

&gt; You see, Hallowe&#39;en is an EVIL holiday. Pagan in origin, and<br/>
&gt; celebratory of death (see? Sonic the Hedgehog going door to door.<br/>
&gt; Death...yah)...we Christians mustn&#39;t do Hallowe&#39;en.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What? The kids REALLY like putting on costumes? Why should the pagans<br/>
&gt; have all the candy? Good points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *I* know, let&#39;s have a &quot;Harvest Celebration&quot;! We won&#39;t use the &quot;H&quot;<br/>
&gt; word at all! It&#39;ll be a genuine day of celebration for the bounties<br/>
&gt; that God has showered upon us this Autumn! We&#39;ll put booths in the<br/>
&gt; church basement, and every booth will hand out prizes...*I* know, the<br/>
&gt; prizes can be CANDY!!! and the kids can dress up in costumes! Nothing<br/>
&gt; scary, though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And so, for about the past decade, the Christian thing to do was hit<br/>
&gt; the church &quot;Harvest Celebration,&quot; &quot;Hallelujah Night,&quot; or what have<br/>
&gt; you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But other kids were out there, dashing door to door and getting candy<br/>
&gt; from everyone in the neighborhood! Oh, darnitall. We simply can NOT<br/>
&gt; do trick-or-treating...but that fresh outdoor air! the dashing door<br/>
&gt; to door...*I* know! Let&#39;s take the Harvest Carnival outside!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; anyway. Sorry. I&#39;ve been cynical about this for a long time. If<br/>
&gt; Hallowe&#39;en is evil, then Christians shouldn&#39;t have anything to do<br/>
&gt; with it at all. No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out<br/>
&gt; candy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some<br/>
&gt; big &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843352511">I wouldn&#39;t rely on The DaVinci Code for historical data. He cites The <br/>
Gnostic Gospels with as much veracity as valid historical documents, <br/>
when the earliest copies of the Gnostic Gospels are dated in the 4th <br/>
century or later. The author claims that early Christians didn&#39;t <br/>
consider the Lord to be God, when early Christians most certainly DID <br/>
consider Him to be just that. I enjoyed reading The DaVinci Code, but <br/>
it isn&#39;t an historical treatise by anyone&#39;s measure, and it really <br/>
isn&#39;t all that well written.<br/>
<br/>
As for all these Christian holidays coming out of Paganism... <br/>
actually, I have read a book that refutes this notion. (and can&#39;t <br/>
remember the title. It is a scholarly, historian thing. Like, a PhD <br/>
thesis or something. 500 pages + ) The Reformers wanted Christians to <br/>
make a clean break from R Catholicism; therefore, they stigmatized <br/>
various Catholic practices by saying they came from paganism. <br/>
According to this essay, archaeological data indicates that many of <br/>
these traditions didn&#39;t come into practice until after Christianity <br/>
got into an area. I&#39;ll try and remember specifics. The Yule Log was <br/>
one of the &quot;pagan practices&quot; debunked in the book. sheesh. can&#39;t <br/>
remember, but Christian feast days coming from paganism or not, isn&#39;t <br/>
my main point.<br/>
<br/>
IF Christian traditions come from paganism, my question just takes on <br/>
more weight. Why is Halloween evil (and it IS considered evil by many <br/>
Christians. Take my word on that one. One of my best friends won&#39;t do <br/>
trick or treating, and another one completely ignores the day...) Why <br/>
is All Hallow&#39;s Eve considered evil, and to be shunned, when <br/>
Christmas and Easter are embraced? IF they come from pagan practices, <br/>
we should shun all of it. And in fact, the Reformers and their <br/>
followers DID. Christmas was illegal in Puritan America. The <br/>
book &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was written by the Puritan Daniel Defoe. He <br/>
makes a point of ignoring Dec. 25. by having the main character mark <br/>
off days on his calendar and pointedly having Dec. 25 be just another <br/>
day, nothing special.<br/>
<br/>
The Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. Sunday being <br/>
named after the Sun, Monday after the Moon, and so forth. Can&#39;t have <br/>
THAT.<br/>
<br/>
If Hallowe&#39;en is evil, having come from paganism, then we must follow <br/>
through on our logic and ban other Christian high holy days. But <br/>
today&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. They just consider <br/>
Hallowe&#39;en evil, but only certain parts of it, like trick or <br/>
treating. They allow the dressing up and the candy, but ban the trick <br/>
or treating...or, just put it in the church basement or parking lot. <br/>
And they never think twice about Christmas and Easter or the origin <br/>
of any other tradition. <br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<br/>
We know fundamentalists who won&#39;t celebrate anything but Easter, and that one <br/>
is only a Church-going day, no eggs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s being discussed here as Christian holidays and pagan holidays is <br/>
dealing just with England/English/American stuff.   The Catholic church has been <br/>
really good about adapting local custom and giving it a religous overlay.  So <br/>
local observances were maintained but given Christian meanings. It happened in <br/>
Rome and Greece, all over Europe.  It&#39;s still done now.  At the Pueblos on the <br/>
northern Rio Grande they have traditional dances which have come to be <br/>
associated with Christmas and danced on Christmas eve, with the dancers starting in <br/>
the church (or ending there).  Other dances which haven&#39;t been attached to <br/>
Christian holidays start and end in the kiva.<br/>

I just finished reading it.  She has a lot of really cool theories <br/>
about the lost feminine in Christianity (thanks to Catholicism)and <br/>
how it was secretly handed down through the ages, through secret <br/>
societies, songs, art....<br/>
Mary Magdaline being the wife of Jesus.  <br/>

A.D. These Early Fathers are documented to have written before that <br/>

solid. There is a fragment of the Gospel of John haling from the <br/>
first century, which scholars believe is a copy made from the <br/>
original gospel, written by John. I.e., one of JOHN&#39;S students, <br/>
within John&#39;s lifetime. <br/>
<br/>
The DaVinci Code came across as &quot;The early followers of Jesus loved <br/>
him alot, but didn&#39;t believe he was resurrected nor that he was <br/>
deity. The Council of Nicea made it up and voted on it.&quot; That is <br/>
bogus. The first Christians believed in the resurrection of Jesus <br/>
Christ and spread that news with fervor and boldness.<br/>

for the Moon? It&#39;s pretty common knowledge. Dunno where I first heard <br/>
it. Some time, as a child, I imagine.<br/>
<br/>
In German, Sontagg, Montagg, Dienstagg (service day?), Mittwoch (mid-<br/>
week), Donnerstag (Thor being the god of thunder), Frietag and <br/>
Sonnabend (sunday&#39;s evening)<br/>
<br/>

=midweek; Thursday=Fourth day??? Friday=fifth day, I suppose. <br/>
Saturday=Sabbath. I got THIS from historical fiction LOL <br/>
<br/>
since the other weekdays are named after gods, where do YOU suppose <br/>
the names Sunday and Monday came from? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>and that one <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is only a Church-going day, no eggs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So do we. They want to drop any and all trappings of &quot;traditions of <br/>
men&quot; These are the same &quot;variety&quot; of Christian who want no candles, <br/>
no bells, no stained glass, in their worship services. We go to a <br/>
pretty conservative church which outright rejects the &quot;traditional&quot; <br/>
common cup in communion (among many other things such as the liturgy <br/>
and the church calendar, etc). The reason being, the common cup is <br/>
used in mainline denoms, which fundamentalists broke from 100 years <br/>
ago, because the mainliners were turning away from Scripture. The <br/>
fundamentalists dropped EVERY element that was used by the main <br/>
denoms, because they wanted to make the break complete.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, they cut themselves away from an important anchor. <br/>
<br/>
But this illustrates my point (and my peeve): They dropped the <br/>
liturgy and the colorful altar decor and candles and such, not <br/>
wanting anything to do with &quot;extra-biblical&quot; practices...but they <br/>
(eventually?) went along with Christmas (nowhere commanded nor <br/>
recommended in the Bible) and Easter (okay, celebrations for the <br/>
Resurrection of Christ are mentioned in the New Testament, but dyeing <br/>
eggs? bunny rabbits? nope) And although evangelical churches still <br/>
don&#39;t do much with candles, they have taken to decorating their <br/>
churches colorfully...not with liturgical robes and altar cloths, but <br/>
with big felt banners and the like. <br/>
<br/>
IF a Bible-believing, truly obedient Christian church must drop &quot;the <br/>
traditions of men&quot; then DROP THEM. If we truly can&#39;t have anything <br/>
outside of Biblically mandated practices, then better not do <br/>
Hallowe&#39;en...and then you&#39;d best drop Christmas as well as Easter <br/>
(unless it is a simple, celebratory church service in honor of the <br/>
Resurrection) As you say, there are groups who do just this. They ARE <br/>
following through on their convictions when they don&#39;t do Christmas <br/>
or other celebrations.<br/>
<br/>
But for the most part, my observation has been, Modern Christians of <br/>
the Fundamental Variety (outside the mainline denoms, mind you), <br/>
Evangelicals if you will, consider Hallowe&#39;en to be an evil day. This <br/>
is why you&#39;ll find basement &quot;Harvest Celebrations&quot; in various <br/>
churches. Can&#39;t do actual trick or treating, but you CAN go to the <br/>
church festival...it&#39;s okay. THAT isn&#39;t Hallowe&#39;en. THAT is a Harvest <br/>
Celebration.<br/>

least SOMEONE is finding evidence that not all Christian holidays <br/>
have roots in paganism. For some of it at least, the traditions began <br/>

Christian holidays by the church...<br/>

I thought she meant she hadn&#39;t heard the Puritans had tried to rename the<br/>
days of the week.  I probably thought that because I never heard that.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
  It seems logical they would try though, all those days named after<br/>
other gods must have been hell on Puritans. <br/>
