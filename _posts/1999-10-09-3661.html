<div id="ygrps-yiv-333221114"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;Now with attachment parenting did you go out every once in a while,<br/>
&gt;just you and your husband, or was the baby always with you?  Also, when<br/>
&gt;baby fell asleep did<br/>
&gt;you put her in a crib or ... what did you do?  I&#39;m just curious.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Each of my four babies were always with me....we never owned a bottle and<br/>
they nursed when s/he needed to. When each child was ready to choose to stay<br/>
home for a time with the older ones, that is when s/he began to do so. They<br/>
each chose to go out with Dad for short periods beginning around 2yo. My dh<br/>
and I never felt that going out with the current baby was a hardship or<br/>
detracted from our time together.<br/>
<br/>
When the baby fell asleep in my arms while nursing, sleep continued that<br/>
way. I would read to the older ones, sit at the computer or do paper work as<br/>
needed. Before slings became readily available, I used a twin-sized sheet as<br/>
a sling. Our babies were always in arms. At night the baby was (is) tucked<br/>
in next to me while I read to the older ones and do my own reading. When the<br/>
child wanted to move out of the family bed, that&#39;s when it occurred.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782596676">I don&#39;t think I am a good enough parent NOT to breastfeed. I never did work out<br/>
how to deal with comforting without it. Like when #2 had his finger jammed in a<br/>
door and totally flattened (at age 8 months). Having established it wasn&#39;t<br/>
broken, they had to squeeze it to mold it back into shape. Imagining the<br/>
screaming? Nope, none - he nursed through the lot. Then the time we were<br/>
visiting and #4 (at about 15 months) put his hand on the unprotected wood stove.<br/>
He did scream but nursing was a great comfort. And then there was ....... too<br/>
numerous examples. Praps it make the likes of me lazy, but it always seemed such<br/>
an easy way to comfort that I didn&#39;t bother looking for too many alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
With respect to time out with or without my husband, I really wanted that time<br/>
when I had my 1st, but by the time the 2nd arrived, and from then on, it hasn&#39;t<br/>
bothered me having the kids with me. Now the oldest is 18 and the youngest is<br/>
nine, we do go out sometimes. But most of the time, knowing we CAN go out alone<br/>
is enough, and most of the time we choose to take the kids. What is really nice,<br/>
is being able now to take just one and spend some special time with that one.<br/>
