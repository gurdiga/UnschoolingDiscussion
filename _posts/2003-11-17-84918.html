Sure they have textbooks to help them, and the other kids fall right into <br/>
hammering down the shiny spikes of independent thought, but that doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
it&#39;s EASY.   There&#39;s a whole curriculum!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410516206">hi, my name is pat and i am new to homeschooling/unschooling and to this <br/>
website. i been reading for about a week to get a feel of everything. i agree <br/>
totally with what you said, that school&#39;s take away independant thinking. i have <br/>
twin boys, that are 11 that i decided to homechool this year because of that <br/>
reason. i watched my 2 sons, who had the most amazing imaginations and great <br/>
self-esteem have both slowly wilted away by school. one i have shared this with <br/>
people they ask, well do your boysdo poorly in school, bad grades, thinking <br/>
that that is the only way a child can be effected by school. these same people <br/>
are always amazed when i say no in fact they usually got straight A,s or A,s and <br/>
one B. it is their independance, their ability to think outside the box, <br/>
their willingness to take chances and to do something with out looking for <br/>
constant approval or wanting to know if they are doing it the&quot;right &quot;way, that made <br/>
me realize how much they had had taken from them. i am now encouraging  them to <br/>
try different things, fiqure out what you are truly interested in and that <br/>
they don&#39;t  have to make it the same for bothof them. i also have ayounger son, <br/>
who just turned 5. I feel like i am learnig new things every day and that your <br/>
website has helped me look at many things in a different lite. it has <br/>
definitely helped with my understanding of unschooling. i had wanted to <br/>
unschool/homeschool 4 years ago but my youngest was a baby and my husband thought it would <br/>
be way too much,so i decided not to. at the time the twins were happy in <br/>
school and seemed to be doing well, but it was always in the back of my mind. every <br/>
time i went to the library i would pick up the copy of homeschooling magazine <br/>
and read it from cover to cover. i feel so blessed that i finally am doing <br/>
this, i just wish that i had done it years ago. my one big question i have is <br/>
how to you have the kids work evaluated at the end of the year, or how what do <br/>
you put in a portfolio so that you get a letter from a teacher saying that they <br/>
have made progress. i would appreciate any ideas to help me with this because <br/>
this is the thing that i am concerned about . thank you for taking the time <br/>
to read this and to answer me. pat<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Pat,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure you mentioned your kids&#39; ages, so our situations may not be <br/>
all that similar. I have a 6 yo (who would be 1st grade), an almost 5 and a <br/>
3 yo. I dealt with portfolio reviews through my county last year (for <br/>
Kindergarten), and my next scheduled review is early January.  We do twice <br/>
a year in Maryland, and I can tell you that it differs quite a bit here <br/>
from county to county and even reviewer to reviewer.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you on the no testing, if you have any say. That&#39;s a situation <br/>
that you absolutely don&#39;t want to set up.<br/>
<br/>
People I know approach the review process in a couple of different ways. <br/>
Some folks take lots of pictures and document their learning that way. <br/>
Other folks go in with the idea of overwhelming the reviewer with <br/>
stuff--just bring anything and everything that&#39;s of value (in the <br/>
reviewer&#39;s eyes). In the county north of me, there is a drop-off system, <br/>
which I would just hate! You drop off your portfolio and pick it up with <br/>
teacher comments on it. That would really fire me up, like I was being <br/>
graded with no chance to comment or explain. GRRRRRR!<br/>
<br/>
My situation is a bit different, for better or for worse. My husband and I <br/>
both have PhD&#39;s, so I went in with the attitude of knowing far more than <br/>
they do. I tossed a couple of things at my reviewer like Bose-Einstein <br/>
condensation, and before she knew it, her head was spinning. I think that <br/>
most homeschoolers could adopt this tact if they chose to (I did this, btw, <br/>
in a very friendly and non-aggressive way). Homeschoolers learn about so <br/>
many interesting things in such depth that there&#39;s a very good chance that <br/>
we know more than ps reviewers about many things. Actually documenting <br/>
stuff in a portfolio is kinda difficult for me as an unschooler, which is <br/>
why I would really hate not having a face to face interview. I can talk <br/>
about all kinds of things that make it quite clear my kids have been <br/>
exposed to interesting things and have learned a great deal even if it&#39;s <br/>
not documented. This past year, my reviewer was fine with the fact that ALL <br/>
of our math and science were hands on, because I was able to describe the <br/>
kinds of things we did.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering right now how this will play out in the higher grades. I&#39;m <br/>
figuring that I will end up switching to an umbrella school that is more <br/>
friendly to unschoolers. This is an option in Maryland, kind of like <br/>
enrolling in a private school.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this was helpful or if it was what you were looking for. <br/>
I&#39;d be happy to try to answer more specific questions if you have any.<br/>

Ohio has three options for end-of-year assessment:  1) the composite <br/>
score from a nationally normed achievement test, 2) a portfolio <br/>
assessment from an Ohio certified teacher, 3) anything that you and <br/>
your superintendent can agree upon.  I have long advocated that <br/>
everyone try option #3 first.  Only in those few districts where the <br/>
superintendents have a record of ogrely behavior will home educators <br/>
have a problem getting supers to agree to any number of things, <br/>
including:  1) since you are the child&#39;s teacher, and are authorized <br/>
by the state to select all his/her curriculum, administer the daily <br/>
educational hours, assess and observe the student on a daily basis, <br/>
then you are, of course, the most logical person to assess your <br/>
child, not some teacher who you visit with a pile of papers for one <br/>
hour (or less) once a year; 2) for older children some kind of yearly <br/>
project could provide a great record of your child&#39;s year of <br/>
learning, including a video production, a blog of learning <br/>
experience, a photo journalism display, or something else.  You see, <br/>
Ohio isn&#39;t so bad, once you really read the regs and understand the <br/>
possibilities.   <br/>
<br/>
What you have to present for the portfolio assessment option depends <br/>
entirely on the teacher.  Our group, CATCH, a totally inclusive, non-<br/>
directed, community-based home ed support group, has free membership <br/>
for anyone, and every spring we offer a free group portfolio <br/>
assessment event to members who join before Jan. 1 of each year (and <br/>
who remain members).  I am an Ohio certified teacher and I also will <br/>
do private assessments, for a fee, for those who can&#39;t make the free <br/>
group one. Get in touch with me offlist if you&#39;d like more <br/>
information.  <br/>

The regulations say something about a written assessment, so maybe this is<br/>
in the form of an essay that you write. If it were me, I would start by<br/>
keeping a very simple journal/scrapbook of what you are doing each day - not<br/>
writing in &quot;educationese&quot;, or just what could be normally construed as<br/>
educational activities, but everything that you do, and how you all spend<br/>
your time. It will give you a place to start when memory fails. When they<br/>
are grown up won&#39;t you have fun looking back. It may also help you feel<br/>
better once you realize just how much is being done.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that you ask you kids (sorry I forget their ages) for their ideas<br/>
for storing written pieces, art projects or other records. <br/>

Not that people can&#39;t or won&#39;t answer here, but while you&#39;re waiting, you<br/>
might want to check out the state folders and the &quot;How to meet your state&#39;s<br/>
