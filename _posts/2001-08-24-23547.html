<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215082144">Does anyone have any ideas for &quot;story&quot; type history books that are good for<br/>
the 5-7 yr old group?  Or even some history books not in story form geared<br/>
for this age level that your kids enjoy(ed).  Thanks<br/>

&gt; &gt; She doesn&#39;t want to understand.  If she understands she will have<br/>

&gt; &gt; 1) her education<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2) her profession<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3) her parenting<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a lot of questioning for an August 22, for a teacher, and<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I also think she has cried &quot;uncle&quot; and you can patch her up and let<br/>

&gt; &gt; a few months or years.<br/>

&gt; I agree, Sandra.  And she proved my point, too:  you can&#39;t teach<br/>

&gt; &gt; I very seriously doubt that she taught any seminars on &quot;the method<br/>
&gt; you use.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; the unschooling &quot;method&quot; cause there isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; a &quot;method.&quot;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think she was probably referring to seminars on &quot;using the<br/>
&gt; interests of the child to teach the subjects that the child wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; normally approach on their own.&quot; (quote from her e-mail) which is NOT<br/>
&gt; unschooling, but more like using my daughter&#39;s interest in fish to<br/>
&gt; learn reading (let&#39;s read this book about fish; let&#39;s add and<br/>
&gt; subtract fish; what types of fish and marine life do you think the<br/>
&gt; Pilgrims saw while crossing the Atlantic on the Mayflower? etc.)<br/>

&gt; Janet, you must be in New England. We used to live in Massachusetts and<br/>
Sturbridge Village was one of my children&#39;s favorite places to learn about<br/>
history. My boys met Norm Abram of New Yankee workshop there once and it was<br/>
the highlight of their day. My daughter was amazed with the kitchens and how<br/>
they prepared the food. We spent days and days there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was wondering if you get that back to school feeling still?&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know how you feel.  School started here last Monday, and the Sunday<br/>
before that, Wal-Mart was JAMMED with stressed out moms and jittery kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The kids were amazed that so many kids were buying paper!  hehehe  We<br/>
picked up the school list for the school they would be attending and read<br/>
over the supply list out of curiosity.  This last week, we drove by on our<br/>
way to the Sam Davis Home to take pictures of the corn and there were kids<br/>
outside running around.  I asked my oldest if he felt sad about not being<br/>
with them and he said, &quot;No, I just feel sad that they have to go.  Mom?  Can<br/>
we go to the park and ride bikes and look for bugs?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess he has no feelings about it, since he has never gone, but I found<br/>
myself looking forward to the start of school.  There are less kids out and<br/>
it seems the &#39;bullies&#39; are ALL mysteriously gone!  Now the kids can play on<br/>
the playground and use the pool in our community without a kid twice their<br/>
age and half their intellect bossing them around...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It also seems that once school starts, we are able to get back on more of<br/>
a schedule.  It seems everything child-related revolves around school hours<br/>
anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, maybe I don&#39;t get the same ones you do-but I DO have some<br/>
back-to-school feelings.<br/>

&gt; sorry if I already sent this out.... I think I am becoming more and more<br/>
&gt; forgetful as I age... think that is it? LOL I thought some of you might be<br/>
&gt; interested and since I am already getting quite a response from structured<br/>
&gt; schoolers I thought more unschooly type stories would help balance the<br/>
book:)<br/>

&gt; I too have school related feelings.....complete and utter relief and<br/>
joy!!!<br/>
&gt; The last couple weeks I have heard both Moms and Dads talking about how<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t wait for the kids to go back to school...this seems to be an<br/>
accepted<br/>
&gt; feeling.  I find it appalling.  There are even many commercials echoing<br/>
&gt; this(exploiting this).  It really makes me sick.<br/>
&gt; I am so very happy, and feel so very lucky to have my kids with me.  I am<br/>
glad<br/>
&gt; we get to share the journey together.  Don&#39;t get me wrong there are plenty<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; days I&#39;m stressed and need a break from my kids, but that isn&#39;t any<br/>
different<br/>
&gt; than being married.  :)  Seems like a normal part of life...finding the<br/>
balance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also enjoy when all the kids go back and sort of &quot;get out of our way&quot;.<br/>
Most<br/>
&gt; place we go are more pleasant.<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t let it drive you nuts. She is  a public educatior who has spent many<br/>
&gt; years of college being taught hers is the correct and best way and she may<br/>
&gt; not get it. Don&#39;t take it personal. I have a friend who is &quot;from a long<br/>
line<br/>
&gt; of educators&quot; as he says. He thinks our kids are smart, articulate, polite<br/>
&gt; and really great kids. Homeschooling is not for his daughter according to<br/>
&gt; him. His wife would make a great homeschooler but he won&#39;t let her. I<br/>
&gt; learned to let it go.<br/>

&gt; to go to school, however I cannot make space for such a<br/>
&gt; time-consuming hobby in our lives right now ;-)  I am<br/>
&gt; expecting some fall-out because one child who my<br/>
&gt; children have spent quite a lot of time with this<br/>
&gt; Summer dumped my eldest like a hot rock when she went<br/>
&gt; back to school last year :-(  And a baby due in a few<br/>
&gt; weeks...  complicated times...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No doubt we&#39;ll get through it :-)<br/>

&gt; Yesterday my boys and I had a &quot;thank God we aren&#39;t in school&quot; ice cream at<br/>
the local burger place........its right next to the public school and they<br/>
just laughed and laughed at the thought of being cooped up in there all day<br/>
while we were having ice cream to our hearts content.  I loved it!<br/>

&gt;  The back to school feeling I first thought of was the scared queasy<br/>
feeling I always got. I can still feel it when I observe most of the town<br/>
getting ready for school. I am so glad my boys don&#39;t have to feel that<br/>
helpless feel of no choice.<br/>
&gt;  Otherwise, I love it when school starts also.We took our vacation last<br/>
year in September. I picked hotels that had indoor pools & we usually had<br/>
the pool to ourselves.<br/>
&gt;  Our community pool closes when school starts!<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I also enjoy when all the kids go back and sort of &quot;get out of our<br/>
way&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have mixed feelings about my relief that some are going back and getting<br/>
&gt; out of our house.  There were a few &quot;school kids&quot; who spent a lot of time<br/>
&gt; here in the summer, because it was summer, and as school approached they<br/>
&gt; intensified their visiting, knowing the days of &quot;no, you can&#39;t go to Kirby<br/>
&gt; and Marty&#39;s&quot; were nigh.  So it&#39;s nice for the house to be quieter, but<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; kind of lonely.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I was wondering if you get that back to school feeling still?&lt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know how you feel.  School started here last Monday, and the Sunday<br/>
&gt; before that, Wal-Mart was JAMMED with stressed out moms and jittery kids.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The kids were amazed that so many kids were buying paper!  hehehe  We<br/>
&gt; picked up the school list for the school they would be attending and read<br/>
&gt; over the supply list out of curiosity.  This last week, we drove by on our<br/>
&gt; way to the Sam Davis Home to take pictures of the corn and there were kids<br/>
&gt; outside running around.  I asked my oldest if he felt sad about not being<br/>
&gt; with them and he said, &quot;No, I just feel sad that they have to go.  Mom?<br/>
Can<br/>
&gt; we go to the park and ride bikes and look for bugs?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess he has no feelings about it, since he has never gone, but I<br/>
found<br/>
&gt; myself looking forward to the start of school.  There are less kids out<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; it seems the &#39;bullies&#39; are ALL mysteriously gone!  Now the kids can play<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; the playground and use the pool in our community without a kid twice their<br/>
&gt; age and half their intellect bossing them around...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It also seems that once school starts, we are able to get back on more<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; a schedule.  It seems everything child-related revolves around school<br/>
hours<br/>
&gt; anyway.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, maybe I don&#39;t get the same ones you do-but I DO have some<br/>
&gt; back-to-school feelings.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m new to this list, and also new to the Portland (Oregon) area.  I&#39;m<br/>
wondering if there exists a playgroup for younger children--mine is 13<br/>
months, and right now there are no kids around for him to play with.  I&#39;m<br/>
really inspired by the unschooling philosophy and I hope my son will be too!<br/>
Are there any playgroups for this age group already formed, or is anyone<br/>
interested in starting one with us?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Tracy- Very true!!! Parents do have many decisions they must make in the<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; interest of their children, but children have the right to make decisions<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; their own lives. As Parents we need to have our children look up to us and<br/>
&gt; respect us. To see us as examples for them, and to see us as people who<br/>
love<br/>
&gt; them with our whole hearts. Not people who can&#39;t wait until they are gone,<br/>
&gt; are too dumb for our children to consider our suggestions, etc.<br/>

&gt; The commercials are awful!!  Not only the ones about the parents that<br/>
&gt; are thrilled the kids are going back (ie the Staples commercial), but<br/>
&gt; even the clothing ads are bad.  What about the JC Penney ad where a<br/>
&gt; pre-teen girl, dressed in junior slut clothes, asking her mom if she<br/>
&gt; can have a tattoo?  Or the young teen boy wanting to shave his<br/>
&gt; eyebrows?  The girl with half-pink hair?  We have all the latest<br/>
&gt; styles so your kids will fit in.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There was another commercial out earlier in the month (I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
&gt; it recently) with a teen explaining that it&#39;s not what you look like,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s what&#39;s inside that counts.  But she&#39;s going shopping to get all<br/>
&gt; of the latest, coolest stuff, &quot;just in case&quot;.  There was another one<br/>
&gt; with a teen girl trying on all of her newest clothes and admiring<br/>
&gt; herself, and her mom comes in and says, &quot;you&#39;re not going to school<br/>

&gt; I sure wish there was something to be done about all those types of<br/>
things...<br/>
&gt; I mean we &quot;are&quot; the consumers!<br/>
&gt; Of course it seems like we are in the minority.  Most people don&#39;t seem<br/>
&gt; bothered by this at all.<br/>
&gt; That scares me!<br/>

&gt; &gt; The commercials are awful!!  Not only the ones about the parents that<br/>
&gt; &gt; are thrilled the kids are going back (ie the Staples commercial), but<br/>
&gt; &gt; even the clothing ads are bad.  What about the JC Penney ad where a<br/>
&gt; &gt; pre-teen girl, dressed in junior slut clothes, asking her mom if she<br/>
&gt; &gt; can have a tattoo?  Or the young teen boy wanting to shave his<br/>
&gt; &gt; eyebrows?  The girl with half-pink hair?  We have all the latest<br/>
&gt; &gt; styles so your kids will fit in.....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was another commercial out earlier in the month (I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; it recently) with a teen explaining that it&#39;s not what you look like,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s what&#39;s inside that counts.  But she&#39;s going shopping to get all<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the latest, coolest stuff, &quot;just in case&quot;.  There was another one<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a teen girl trying on all of her newest clothes and admiring<br/>
&gt; &gt; herself, and her mom comes in and says, &quot;you&#39;re not going to school<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: Digest Number 1377<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been enjoying the converstaions lately. I recieve flack on our<br/>
&gt; homeschooling all the time. I am the closes thing to a radical in my<br/>
family.<br/>
&gt; hehehehe... I am always hearing and reading  of people trying to explain<br/>
&gt; their choice to unschool. As for me, I haven&#39;t bothered telling anyone. We<br/>
&gt; started out doing school at home and have gradually come into unschooling.<br/>
&gt; We have been &quot;at it&quot; for three years now, and I haven&#39;t told anyone. They<br/>
&gt; all assume I do school at home, I let them assume. If I am ever asked I<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; give a truthful answer, but until then....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this bad? Is there a reason I should explain my choices to others? Is<br/>
&gt; this a sign that I am really a chicken? :) Well, the last statement is<br/>
true,<br/>
&gt; at least in regards to my mom. (an over bearing woman, who only sees black<br/>
&gt; and white, I love her and know she means well, but I shake at the thought<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; her anger). When I talk to other people I will state my beliefs and<br/>
&gt; opinions, from there I allow them to say what they please, for I know in<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; heart what is right for my family. And I secretly feel sorry for people<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t see the joy in my life or find the happiness in their children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Last years was the commercial where they hauled the kids shopping and the<br/>
&gt; dad was estatic.  The year before the mom was gleeful about school<br/>
starting<br/>
&gt; and the kids were gleeful because all the stuff was left on the car roof<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; was sailing away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t remember what it is for but there is one where the mom is in tears<br/>
&gt; and the kid waltzes off unconcerned on the first day of school and talks<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; another little kid and says something like &quot;what&#39;s her problem&quot; or<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; like that or at least that is what I got from it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Kim, you must just love those nasty commercials you have been seeing...<br/>
&gt; &gt; You know the one where the Mom is tearfully leaving her kindergartner at<br/>
&gt; school,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and as soon as she turns the cornier she starts jumping up and down.  Oh<br/>
&gt; boy do<br/>
&gt; &gt; I dislike those things... what is the matter with people that they think<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is ok?  What is this saying to their children??????  AHHHHHH!<br/>

into<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; tiff or two over it as I haven&#39;t quite learned how to bit down on my<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I hear my closest friends say this and I try to lovingly help them<br/>
&gt; realize<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what it is that they are saying. The tiffs I&#39;ve gotten into were<br/>
online<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; over and over people are saying it and finally I can&#39;t take hearing<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; say this about their own children. It&#39;s so frustrating and at times I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; literally bit my tongue to keep quiet. And to think I was once one of<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people. I&#39;m glad my eyes are now opened to my  children, IYKWIM.<br/>

Are they boys or girls? My daughter has taken to the American Girls <br/>
collection books. I generally read them to her, but she absolutely loves <br/>
them. There&#39;s also the Dear America books. And along the lines of Dear <br/>
America there&#39;s a series of books about boys from history too, I forgot the <br/>
name of the series however.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I dont&#39; know how much history your looking to get into, but we sure like<br/>
the Magic Tree House series where they go back in time starting with the<br/>
dinosaurs. They are short chapter books that can be read in 30 minutes or<br/>
less.<br/>
