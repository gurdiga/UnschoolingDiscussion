&lt;&lt; That&#39;s just <br/>
 got to be one of the first criteria, is an interesting bookshelf easily <br/>
 visible from the front door. &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that&#39;s us for sure.  &#39;Course our whole house is pretty much visible from <br/>
the front door :)<br/>

A room without books is just not finished. Like a soulless person or <br/>
something.....<br/>

<br/>
My daughters boyfriend just showed me 1/2 carat diamond stud earrings he <br/>
bought her for Christmas. They are beautiful and set him back some with a <br/>
ZALES card. She&#39;s going to absolutely love them. She&#39;s that type, and a book <br/>
would be totally lost on her unless it was a catalog!! (she&#39;s the school <br/>
kid)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, her earrings totally blows away anything I have in my little jewelry <br/>
box. I would love to have diamonds. I can only imagine how many books I <br/>
could buy for what I sold them for. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
  When I worked in preschool, I bought from Scholastic all the time.  The <br/>
teacher (I was the assistant) would get three or four books a month, I&#39;d get <br/>
a whole boxful.  One day she smiled when my delivery came, and feeling <br/>
sheepish, I said, &quot;I can&#39;t help it.  Books are my weakness.&quot;  She said, &quot;No <br/>
they&#39;re not.  They&#39;re your passion.&quot;<br/>
  YESSSS!!!<br/>
Mary J<br/>
PS  Anyone see the Dr. Phil where the wife complained that her husband had <br/>
too many books?  She should come here.  I had to give away the couch from my <br/>
front room so I&#39;d have a place to put more bookcases.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156189309">Can I like jewelry AND books? I actually have several nice pieces...my grandmother was<br/>
really into jewelry and I got several of her pieces (each has a story behind it). She <br/>
also gave me a 15 point diamond for my birthday every year until I turned 20 . Hubby <br/>
set six of them set in a gorgeous ring for me one year and the other 14 went into a necklace.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby used to buy me jewelry when I used to work, but since I have been at home I have<br/>
found there is not much need. I have everything that I really would want...<br/>
<br/>
As far as books go, I am lucky. My dad and I have similar tastes in fiction so he passes<br/>
me his books when he is done. I have gotten better at checking homeschooling/parenting<br/>
books out from the library and then buying the ones that I know I will want to refer<br/>
to later.<br/>
<br/>
I buy the kids books constantly...can&#39;t wait for Dec 12...the Scholastic book warehouse<br/>
is having a teachers sale that includes homeschoolers...all their books are 50% off.<br/>
Jason and I were in heaven when they did this last spring. A huge warehouse filled with<br/>
books at great prices. Ahhhh.....<br/>
