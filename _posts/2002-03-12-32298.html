<br/>
I have found a major difference between my boy & girl. My girl is sweet, <br/>
compassionate, responsible, she understands things & thinks things through, <br/>
while my boy (who is 2.5 yrs. older) acts clueless most of the time.  He <br/>
needs to be told over & over again the same things (like to blow his nose or <br/>
to answer his sister when she&#39;s talking to him.)  He appears to be way more <br/>
self-centered than his sis--I understand kids are supposed to be <br/>
self-centered.  If she gets hurt he&#39;s more upset that she can&#39;t play with <br/>
him than concerned about how she&#39;s feeling.  He&#39;s always been more advanced <br/>
with using his body than his intellect.  He can build anything with legos & <br/>
once showed his dad how to put the futon back up (having never done it <br/>
before.)  Girl has been more intellectually gifted.  All in all I see a huge <br/>
difference between them & their interests are also different.  As far as <br/>
potty training, we really forced it on the oldest & it wasn&#39;t very nice for <br/>
any of us.  With the second, we let it go & she&#39;s almost 5 & wears a pull up <br/>
when she sleeps still but she just suddenly stopped wearing daytime diapers <br/>
around 2.5.  I&#39;ve heard that boys take longer to get the toilet thing than <br/>
girls.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW,<br/>
Sara<br/>
<br/>
I am continually amazed at the<br/>
difference between them that seems to be solely due to gender differences as <br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure I don&#39;t parent her much differently than I did him at the same <br/>
age.<br/>
Have any of you come across this in your family???<br/>
<br/>
This was  a lot longer than I intended...guess I&#39;m no longer lurking:)<br/>
<br/>
Beth- busy mommy to Shawn and Shannon, my precious angels.<br/>
<br/>
oh...today we started intense potty training....I think I&#39;m not using the<br/>
unschooling method here because I initiated it, but Shawn had NO accidents <br/>
today<br/>
and went to bathroom to pee a number of times without telling me! So I&#39;m <br/>
pretty<br/>
sure my gut instincts were right and he is ready, but was holding out for <br/>
the<br/>
attention due to little sister. What is your experience with this?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343021995">yikerssss!! WHY ARE YOU ALL PICKIN ON EACH OTHER??  i guess we get defensive <br/>
when we are afraid or not sure of ourselves.... I Have gotten off other lists <br/>
of homesteaders and such because of ARGUMENTS~~~ Once someone told me to lose <br/>
the caps! OK well anyway, I agree that kids will naturally choose good stuff <br/>
for themselves much of the time......tv, stories, even food!&gt; EVENTUALLY <br/>
(after 3 days of candy and ice cream ) THEY WILL ASK FOR BROCCOLI!!!!!! they <br/>
really will!!!! BUT ~ i am still thinking and aware of the <br/>
subconscious.......i have had sexually abused foster children in my care. <br/>
What makes a person do that? Someone once suggested to me that society has <br/>
raised the bar on what &quot;excites&quot; a person by tv and lewdness and movies and <br/>
what&#39;s acceptable. I BELIEVE STRONGLY in not protecting kids from all this by <br/>
pretending it doesnt exist. THats ludicrous. We watch tv tog. and discuss and <br/>
the kids are pretty opionated let me tell ya~~~I also wonder though about how <br/>
the subconscious doesn&#39;t find killing wrong after seeing it over and over on <br/>
a video game or tv, or doesnt find sex with a  3 yr old wrong because sex <br/>
with adults is boring when we watch it all the time on tv. I was wondering <br/>
what you all think about letting the tv be absorbed into their subconscious. <br/>
I let my 8 year old choose what he watches and he &#39;s able to turn off scary <br/>
stuff. Even so.....the 5 yr old twins need guidance.......i believe this is <br/>
pretty important and i m trying to figure it out for my kids and me. I am a <br/>
single adoptive (former foster mom) of 31 children. I adopted 3 and im about <br/>
as open minded as they come. I realize reading back what i wrote, that i <br/>
might sound VICTORIAN to some of you!!!! any ideas or opinions??? Elissa~! we <br/>
jsut spent teh weekend in Syracuse. Good luck!!! ~Denise</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if there is more of perversion going on, or if they are just <br/>
out in the open more so it appears to be more of a problem. I&#39;m honestly <br/>
not sure.<br/>
<br/>
And this does go back to a nature vs. nurture situation. Personally, I <br/>
don&#39;t feel a child would grow up to hurt another life (of any kind) if <br/>
they have been modeled full respect for life (of all kinds) as a child.<br/>

thought. Could you please clarify?<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;m reading, it sounds like you dont&#39; feel TV is an issue??? Am <br/>
I right?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think scary shows should be viewed with another person to talk it out <br/>
with. And if its too scary, I find they will usually tell you. Again, it <br/>
might be the hour I&#39;m reading this, or my brain has finally come to a <br/>
complete stop, but I think I need clarification on your question.<br/>
<br/>
And, that is SOME track record with kids you have.. blessed be!<br/>

You don&#39;t sound Victorian to me.  I NEVER limit content of TV, but <br/>
I understand why some people do.  I have only ever had to limit one of <br/>
mine as to the amount of time spent and as stated before, he is a <br/>
special case although he&#39;s not the only one in the world.<br/>
