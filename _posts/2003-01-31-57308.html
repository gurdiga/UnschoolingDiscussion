&lt;&lt; Then we got home, I asked if they could please clean up the <br/>
 livingroom so that people can walk through it and there is a <br/>
 comfortable place for everyone to sit on the couch, because their <br/>
 grandma and grandpa are coming over for big monkey&#39;s birthday party <br/>
 and to watch a movie with them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of asking my children to clean up, I say &quot;will you guys come help me <br/>
get this room picked up, I am feeling really stressed right now.&quot; or with a <br/>
happy smile &quot;this room is difficult to even walk in, let&#39;s get some of this <br/>
put away&quot; and I start right in.<br/>
If you are joyfully doing things, they will WANT to join you most of the time.<br/>
Asking them to just do something for me is more like a maid (if it&#39;s <br/>
happening often) rather than a companion.<br/>
I do ask them to please get certain things done, but I use that option rarely <br/>
and it&#39;s not so hard to get a positive response.<br/>
Aren&#39;t your children younger Sheila?<br/>
I don&#39;t expect much help from little ones, my 13 and 9 y.o. are more capable <br/>
of independently pitching in.<br/>
It takes time.<br/>
I think possibly you are assuming that their needs and your needs are going <br/>
to magically overlap on the cleanliness issue. It&#39;s possible they will never <br/>
care about having a clean house and in that case they will help because they <br/>
know you need it.<br/>
But you can&#39;t use it every time you need something cleaned or they quickly <br/>
shut you out.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; People on this list have said that their houses don&#39;t look like <br/>
 tornadoes have gone through them.  If that&#39;s true, I don&#39;t understand <br/>
 how they do it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone here said that? who, where?? I want to know their TRICKS!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, my house usually looks like a tornado hit it.<br/>
I am doing a one year cleaning that organizes a small area each week, and I <br/>
have to say it&#39;s really working well.<br/>
But there are always messes piled somewhere, usually lots of somewheres.<br/>
