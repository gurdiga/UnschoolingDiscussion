<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246304451">I could use some input about a difficult situation in my family.  My dh, two ds and I regularly watch episodes of our favorite shows or movies in the evenings.  The problem is that this time together all too often results in an emotional scene where everyone ends up feeling bad.  My younger son Julian (9) usually has a lot of questions about what is going on in the show.  No problem so far.  But, when my dh or I try to answer his question (calmly, with no irritation or impatience) he usually doesn&#39;t understand imediately and then he begins to get upset (sometimes he is upset when he first asks the question).  He gets this tone of voice which sounds like he is about to cry and his facial expression screws up into something like anger or frustration. We (dh and I) do our best to stay calm and explain in different ways to help him understand.  Sometimes we do stay calm, manage to help Julian reach some kind of understanding and he calms down.  Other times one or both of us shows<br/>
 irritation and frustration and raise our voice(s) and of course that just makes things much worse.  It gets more complicated when our older son Charles (12) gets angry and upset because he is tired of spending more time waiting for his brother to understand than watching the show.<br/>
 <br/>
I should add that this doesn&#39;t just come up during TV watching.  Julian frequently gets very emotional when he is trying to understand anything that comes up in our day to day lives.  Often, he seems to have formed an expected response in his mind.  When we don&#39;t answer him with his expected response he doesn&#39;t seem to &quot;hear&quot; what we say at all.  It&#39;s like he totally discounts anything that doesn&#39;t fit the mold he has prepared in his mind.  We try explaining a different way.  Still not what he wants to hear. He really starts to melt down.  Later, if we repeat the first answer (or one of the other explainations) it may finally &quot;click&quot;.  Then he invariably says something like &quot;Finally! An answer to my question. Why didn&#39;t you say that in the first place?!&quot;  (Excuse me a moment while I relive the incredible frustration this comment evokes)  If we point out that we DID say it in the first place he says he never heard us say that. Probably we should just keep our mouths shut once he<br/>
 understands.  Sometimes I am tempted to record these conversations just so I can make sure that I am not going crazy or remembering what I said completely wrong.<br/>
 <br/>
The thing I am really worried about here is the emotional aspect.  I don&#39;t mind taking time to explain over and over again until he understands. But he gets soooo upset and I feel so bad for him.  And so often I (or dh or Charles) end up getting upset.<br/>
 <br/>
I have learned that he is a very visual person.  So I try to use visual aids whenever I can in these situations. Some help but not enough.<br/>
 <br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
TIA<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the input. However, we watch TV episodes off of DVD&#39;s we <br/>
get from BlockBuster.  So we already stop and rewatch when <br/>
neccessary.  My older son gets frustrated when we are stopping every <br/>
5 minutes &lt;g&gt;.  Actually, we have come to an agreement with the <br/>
boys. When we sit down to watch something we set a timer for 20min. <br/>
When it goes off it is &quot;question time&quot;.  We started this to try and <br/>
accomadate both boys needs. It does help with the general <br/>
frustration level. But during those question times (and during other <br/>
daily life situations, as mentioned before) Julian still gets very <br/>
upset when trying to understand. He seems to have this overwhelming <br/>
urgency - he needs to know and he needs to know now!<br/>

I was going to say &quot;would it help to watch less suspenseful TV shows?&quot;, but if it&#39;s also happening in real life then, yeah, I don&#39;t really comprehend why he&#39;s so urgent about the answers.<br/>

This sounds too scheduled to me.  Maybe instead of trying so hard to watch <br/>
things with both boys, maybe watch some things with one and some with the other. <br/>
 Or watch it with the one who has questions first, and then let the other boy <br/>
watch it later without interruption.  And if the younger wants to watch it <br/>
again the second uninterrupted time, THEN they can be watching it together.  <br/>
<br/>
We watch a lot of movies separately here.  We can still discuss them in the <br/>
days and weeks and years to follow without having watched them all together.<br/>

Good reason to watch just with him, and let HIM hold the remote and pause it <br/>
as much as he wants to to ask questions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like younger sibling frustration to me. Rosie has had some of <br/>
that at different ages. Not a quick fix - but it might mean that the <br/>
family needs to find some things to focus on where the younger sibling <br/>
has more expertise than the older one - gets to explain things TO <br/>
somebody else once in a while, instead of always feeling like he&#39;s <br/>
playing catch-up?<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that he&#39;s sort of &quot;on the edge&quot; all the time - of <br/>
feeling overwhelmed by how much he doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; compared to his <br/>
brother and parents. So seemingly little things push him over the edge <br/>
and he looks sort of irrational - too touchy, too urgent, as you <br/>
described it?<br/>
<br/>
Is there some reason you can&#39;t watch things that are more accessible to <br/>
him so that he doesn&#39;t HAVE to feel like he&#39;s not understanding?<br/>
<br/>
When my youngest wasn&#39;t able to keep up with stuff - the things we <br/>
watched as a family were geared to her level - there is plenty of <br/>
material out there for younger kids that is interesting and <br/>
entertaining to adults and older kids, too.<br/>

<br/>
Our son Joseph (10) is very analytical about a lot of things. General<br/>
explanations that satisfy the other kids just don&#39;t work on him. So for that<br/>
reason, watching movies or shows with him can be a bit frustrating. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t get upset about asking but sometimes my husband does when he just<br/>
wants to watch the show. So if it&#39;s a movie that my husband really wants to<br/>
see, we will watch it first and then again with the kids. My husband is much<br/>
more calm answering questions about something he&#39;s already enjoyed watching.<br/>
TV shows we will tape. That way also, Sierra can watch through as she<br/>
doesn&#39;t question things like Joseph does either. Works very well here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898293350">Does Julian read?  I have difficulty sometimes understanding a show<br/>
because I don&#39;t always get what&#39;s said - processing problem, not hearing<br/>
