 </span></blockquote>The easiest way to get off all these mailing lists is to actually be<br/>
practive about it.  Rather than create more junk mail by mailing things<br/>
back, though, call the 800 number inside the catalog or on the junk mailing.<br/>
<br/>
Ask to be taken off their mailing list.  Ask the people you do want to<br/>
receive catalogues from to put you on their &quot;do not sell list&quot; or whatever<br/>
such thing they have.  Check the &quot;privacy&quot; box on every web site you visit.<br/>
Call that number that&#39;s regularly circulated to opt-out on credit card<br/>
offers.  And finally, check with your phone service provider -- in Montana,<br/>
they told us that if we listed our phone number without address, we wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be on the junk-mail lists.  We received very little junk mail during our<br/>
years there.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it takes time, especially initially.  But it cuts your junk mail down<br/>
extraordinarily, and I think that&#39;s worth something as far as the<br/>
environment is concerned.   Moving overseas helps a lot, too, but that&#39;s not<br/>
for everyone!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
