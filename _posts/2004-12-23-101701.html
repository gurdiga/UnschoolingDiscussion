<div id="ygrps-yiv-70423980">Thanks to everyone here for boosting our spirits all year!  I often <br/>
drop in without piping in, but wanted you to know that I appreciate <br/>
the support of this group more than you&#39;ll ever know! <br/>
<br/>
The following message was recently posted to FloridaLIFE -- Terri <br/>
Willingham and I have been exchanging some information offlist since <br/>
then.  I&#39;d like to know if there are any Florida-based or other <br/>
(vacationing/visiting) unschoolers out there who would be interested <br/>
in a workshop of this type or know of any other groups or area <br/>
events that would be potential contacts for making this happen on <br/>
the East coast, either this year or next.  <br/>
--------------------------<br/>
I&#39;m looking for information on the upcoming LIFE Fest, if<br/>
available. Specifically, I would to suggest Inbal Kashtan,<br/>
Parenting Project Coordinator of the Center for Nonviolent<br/>
Communication (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnvc.org/parents.htm,)">http://www.cnvc.org/parents.htm,)</a> as a future guest<br/>
speaker. It would be helpful to know if any other homeschool<br/>
conventions are usually held around the same time, in order to<br/>
determine the potential for Ms. Kashtan to participate in more than<br/>
one event when her itinerary is open for a visit to the East coast.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate a response from any and all interested parties in<br/>
the next day or two, if possible, but understand if the holiday rush<br/>
precludes that possibility for many of the subscribers to the list.<br/>
Thanks for providing a forum to allow us to network together, share<br/>
resources, and explore the possibilities!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays, Amigos ~<br/>

&quot;What I want in my life is compassion, a flow between myself and <br/>
others based on a mutual giving from the heart.&quot;<br/>
