&lt;&lt; Also the 5 forests I know of are owned by 3 neighbors.  They chose to <br/>
strip the land for money.  Not b/c of hardships but because they <br/>
wanted new things.  A new yacht.  A huge new house.  Other examples.<br/>
With no regard to the land or animals. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The national forests exist to save some land.  The national parks and <br/>
national monuments are saving some land (not counting the tourist-tromp, but <br/>
that&#39;s okay).  Wildlife sanctuaries exist.<br/>
<br/>
When people buy land, it&#39;s not fair to get on them for not preserving it as a <br/>
sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
Some people DO buy land for that purpose, and that&#39;s their right.  But in the <br/>
same culture in which wooden furniture is valued over plastic or steel (and <br/>
what are the other options and what effect on the environment do THOSE <br/>
methods have?) and wood fires are considered more moral than coal or natural <br/>
gas in some circles, how can ANYONE do anything their friends don&#39;t rag on <br/>
them to death for if their friends don&#39;t take some deep breaths and be a <br/>
little more realistic about what is and isn&#39;t okay to do with one&#39;s own land <br/>
and what is and what isn&#39;t a moral way to have an income?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been paying attention to who has said what on this subject at all, <br/>
so it&#39;s not personal or directed at ANYBODY individually, but I can say this:<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people get stuck being critical.  Of movies, music, neighbors, the <br/>
moms at WalMart (that would be ME, last week very frustrated, and it was <br/>
Target, actually, with some bad mothering practices in public). <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s easy to get stuck in that running-criticism mode.  But it does less <br/>
good than trying to get stuck in a running optimism mode.<br/>
