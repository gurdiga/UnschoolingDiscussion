<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136928579">I just wanted to let ya&#39;ll know that we did loosen the<br/>
reins and let our 3 year old sit down and watch part<br/>
of LOTR the other night.  My partner had it on and<br/>
Sebastian woke up and started watching it.  Instead of<br/>
turning it off (we had been discussing whether or not<br/>
LOTR would be appropriate for him to view etc.) we let<br/>
him watch and made sure to answer his questions like,<br/>
&#39;what&#39;s happening&#39;, &#39;what&#39;s that&#39; etc.  A few times he<br/>
would say &#39;I&#39;m scared&#39; and a couple times we would<br/>
check in with him and ask him if he was scared.  A<br/>
couple times I could tell by his facial expression<br/>
that something was a little intense for him.  He did<br/>
alright though!  He was very interested in who Golem<br/>
was.  He kept calling him a baby monkey which I got a<br/>
good chuckle out of.  He liked the horses, and<br/>
everytime he saw a group of people marching towards a<br/>
battle scene, he thought they were doing a parade! LOL<br/>
Once when Golem got beat up, Sebastian mentioned how<br/>
someone &#39;kicked&#39; him and we talked about how that<br/>
probably hurt Golem and made him sad and how that was<br/>
rude and bad manners.  My partner chimed in that they<br/>
would check to see if Golem was ok.  And, after about<br/>
5 min. he was done, and asked to watch Little Bill<br/>
instead.<br/>
<br/>
I sure did a lot of worrying about whether or not it<br/>
would be appropriate for him to view LOTR and am not<br/>
sure if it was worth all the worry!  A neat<br/>
unschooling experiment.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m trying to share info on unschooling to my<br/>
partner who is not as embracing of it as I am, and<br/>
although he is quite radical, thinks it may be too<br/>
radical.  He said he would read up on it so he can<br/>
make a more &#39;educated&#39; opininion.  So, if anyone has<br/>
any good, not too lengthy snips that would be good to<br/>
e-mail him, please let me know.  We were talking about<br/>
the unrestricted food thing, and now he jokes around<br/>
and calls it &#39;unfeeding&#39;. LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A book that I found very powerful which started me down the path of<br/>
thinking/reading about unschooling was &quot;Child&#39;s Work&quot; by Nancy Wallace. <br/>
If you can find a copy I would recommend it.  It&#39;s one families account<br/>
of the process of disengaging from the school system, and had lots of<br/>
good details about why that were motivated to do so, what things they<br/>
were worried about as they got going.<br/>
