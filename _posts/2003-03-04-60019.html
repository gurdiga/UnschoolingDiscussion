respect them as individuals.  In my opinion the statement above does not flow <br/>
with the unschooling philosophy.  It is controlling another person.  It is <br/>
only a choice when there is an option to say no.  <br/>

  Just guessing here, but maybe she *wants* a clean house, but doesn&#39;t really &quot;want&quot; to go through the motions to have it that way and Flylady helps her do that.<br/>
<br/>
  That would be my motivation if I was using flylady.  (But I don&#39;t much care for flylady, so I don&#39;t :o))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702606192">I also hated fly-lady.<br/>
<br/>
First her stance, no bitching. Well, if you couldn&#39;t bitch about problems<br/>
with her system that meant her system went unchallenged. Either it works or<br/>
you didn&#39;t work, one or the other.  Second, it was all up to whoever was<br/>
reading the emails; mostly women. The system was suppose to make the family<br/>
members help. HA! I went on this kick for awhile, cleaning so that when I<br/>
did the living room I was washing the floors with wood soap (Wood floors)<br/>
each week....by hand, it was so clean, and no one really helped all that<br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
Half my problem is not my stuff but others.  She leaves you two choices;<br/>
leave it or toss it, if it is the kids. Well, I&#39;m not tossing the children&#39;s<br/>
stuff, or dh&#39;s and my own stuff, basically if I keep it I want it.  The<br/>
boogies (27 boogie) meant I was either tossing things I may have wanted or I<br/>
was tossing bit of paper etc. But the house is not going to look clean if my<br/>
dh doesn&#39;t do the recycle, doesn&#39;t want me to do it (he has a particular<br/>
way) and the recycle keeps flowing out of it&#39;s area and into the rest of the<br/>
house.  The house isn&#39;t going to stay clean if five minutes after I&#39;ve put<br/>
everything away, the kids take out their toys and spread them on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
After awhile all my attention was focused on trying to keep the house clean<br/>
and i was becoming bitter and angry.  I ended up working all the time to<br/>
keep it clean, feeling like a dishrag, and hating the house, the family etc.<br/>
etc. And then I would get sick, or have some other obligation that kept me<br/>
from doing my routines; the house would just collapse and become a mess, and<br/>
no one was pitching in.  It just didn&#39;t work for us.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we have too many people with too much stuff for the size of the house,<br/>
but FlyLady just left me angry, not happy, and made me feel like a person<br/>
who is always on a diet, where they can think of nothing but food.  <br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann<br/>

big trash bag and waded into my kids&#39; room and started putting stuff <br/>
into it that I thought was really obviously stuff they didn&#39;t care <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
THAT very night my then-10 yo was asking if anybody knew where her <br/>
Polly-Pocket was - a little plastic toy that I never remembered seeing <br/>
her play with - I&#39;d picked up pieces of it here and there and dumped <br/>
them into the trash bag. The trash bag was gone already - dropped at <br/>
the GoodWill. We jumped in the car and went to the dropoff point, but <br/>
it was gone. We couldn&#39;t find out where they took it. I spent many <br/>
hours going to stores and calling and online trying to find a <br/>
replacement. I felt AWFUL about it. REALLY awful. That was one of the <br/>
most rude things I&#39;ve ever done to anybody, much less my own child!!! I <br/>
also gave up on FlyLady then. Maybe what we need is the same kind of <br/>
email list encouragement/reminders and a system - that is more in tune <br/>
with being respectful of the so-called junk which is really somebody&#39;s <br/>
&quot;stuff.&quot; I know I could use encouragement and some sort of system to <br/>
get me moving.<br/>

principals that are helping me.  I never shined my sink at night; cleaning<br/>
it after washing dishes is enough for me.  I wear shoes, but not lace-ups<br/>
because my Birks are better for my back.  But I *did* learn about baby<br/>
steps.  You do what you can.  When you get used to that, then you try to do<br/>
a little more.  My house is still messy and often unclean, but it&#39;s better<br/>
than it was before, and I can get back &quot;on track&quot; faster when I fall off.<br/>
<br/>
I also feel free to alter her instructions to suit me.  If 15 minutes is too<br/>
much at one time, set the timer for 10 or even 5.  To have the house the way<br/>
you want it might require more of those shorter bursts of action than if you<br/>
could do 15, but I know I can get more done over the long haul if I break it<br/>
up into shorter bursts.<br/>
<br/>
I no longer get the nagging messages from her, but I&#39;m glad I did it for a<br/>
while.<br/>

About two years ago, I realized that I could either spend time with <br/>
people or spend time cleaning things.  I chose people.  To other <br/>
people, I suppose our home looks rather bare.  There are just a <br/>
precious few knicknacks on top of tables, dressers, etc. (makes it <br/>
quicker to dust); bathroom stuff is stored in bins in the cabinet <br/>
under the sink, next to a spray bottle of cleaner and a roll of paper <br/>
towels for quick clean-ups; kids have stackable bins in their rooms <br/>
to hold their *stuff*; boxes that slide under beds hold magazines and <br/>
reams of printer paper; bulletin boards keep stray papers from <br/>
cluttering desktops; industrial shelving lines our basement walls for <br/>
roller blades and helmets, and storage bins holding old games, <br/>
puzzles, toys, etc. (until the kids have decided they don&#39;t want them <br/>
anymore and we give them away).<br/>
<br/>
Two big storage bins sit in the front hall closet - one for <br/>
hats/gloves/scarves, and one for shoes and boots.  My silk flower <br/>
arrangements, candle holders, decorative glass bottles, etc. are <br/>
packed away in boxes stored in the attic.  Our bookcases hold nothing <br/>
but books.  <br/>
<br/>
Spend the money and buy a wet swiffer mop, and store it in the <br/>
kitchen; it makes spills and messes much easier to clean up, and <br/>
you&#39;re more likely to grab the swiffer than haul out a bucket and mop.<br/>
<br/>
Except for big jobs, like mopping the floor or shampooing the carpet, <br/>
for which I require loud music and cold beer, I keep cleaning to 10 <br/>
minute intervals.  I can clean a toilet in ten minutes.  I can wash <br/>
an entire set of windows in ten minutes.  I can grab my heavy-duty <br/>
dustbuster and vacumn the steps in ten minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband says it takes a strong personality to make the Spartan <br/>
look work &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is similar to the way I&#39;ve adapted the Flylady techniques.  I honestly <br/>
feel that Flylady can be a jackbooted thug-type approach, and I just hate <br/>
that.  I&#39;ve decided to take a page out of another highly successful program <br/>
and *take what I want and disregard the rest.*  :-)  I&#39;m still working on it, <br/>
but what I do is fourfold.  1) I try to have my kitchen spotless before I go <br/>
to bed.  Even if nothing else is done, it feels so good to get up to a clean <br/>
kitchen.  (This is what I take Flylady to mean about *shining my sink.*)  2) <br/>
I make my bed in the morning.  3)  I empty the dishwasher early so that it is <br/>
ready to receive rinsed dished during the day.  And 4) I work for as long on <br/>
a task as I feel comfortable.  If that&#39;s 5 minutes or 30.  Then I sit down <br/>
and do what I want to do for a bit, then get up and do a little more...until <br/>
the job is done.  I get the messages but delete most of them without reading <br/>
them, I don&#39;t use a timer, I hate wearing shoes, and purple feather dusters <br/>
are stupid and an extra expense I don&#39;t need.  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
YMMV,<br/>
