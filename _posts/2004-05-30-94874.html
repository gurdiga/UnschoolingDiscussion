I already know<br/>

 &gt; children that I have been struggling to be a calmer Mommy who<br/>
 &gt; doesn&#39;t yell at them, and I told them that I don&#39;t want to make them<br/>
 &gt; suffer anymore, because their suffering makes me suffer too because<br/>
 &gt; I love them.  I asked them to help me by reminding me to breathe<br/>

 &gt; and we have a deal!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I taught a class several years ago to help angry mothers deal with &quot;the <br/>
moment&quot; of anger. One of the things we did was to sit quietly with eyes <br/>
closed and re-examine the most recent blow-up. I would walk them <br/>
through the images, the body sensations, the words and events, alert to <br/>
the trigger points that bubbled over into the outburst of anger. <br/>
Usually most of us feel a &quot;point of no return&quot; with anger where it <br/>
simply seems to &quot;take us over.&quot; And yet, had a girlfriend been in the <br/>
room at the time of the event, usually we would be magically able to <br/>
hold back from spilling over. So it is possible to do something besides <br/>
the pattern of anger - we just need some kind of witness or thwarting <br/>
mechanism at the trigger point.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of the closed eye process is to help yourself develop a <br/>
witness - an internal voice that pops up to say &quot;warning - you are <br/>
about to be angry.&quot; That&#39;s the time to breathe or schedule a mommy time <br/>
out (just change rooms for fifteen seconds instead of blowing up). <br/>
Usually one change in the pattern is enough to buy you time so that you <br/>
won&#39;t blow up and can stop yourself. But self-awareness is key and that <br/>
takes a little practice.<br/>
