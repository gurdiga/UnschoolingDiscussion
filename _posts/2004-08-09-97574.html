Unless  the moderators have asked you to be very, very quiet about the <br/>
Live and  Learn Conference coming up, I would urge you NOT to hide your <br/>
light under  a bushel barrel.  Talk it up here some more!<br/>
<br/>
(Taking the minutiae  off list makes sense to me, but c&#39;mon, let&#39;s have <br/>
some more  noise.)<br/>
<br/>
I realize that Sales and Marketing are sometimes considered  &quot;vulgar&quot;, <br/>
but you are &quot;selling&quot; an unschooling conference to the  unschooled.  <br/>
Seems appropriate for this  list.<br/>

<br/>
No -- I&#39;m a travel wimp.  I have a kid who often has asthma attacks when <br/>
we travel, and I&#39;ve ended up taking most of my vacations close to home <br/>
out of sheer nervousness (and cheapness).<br/>
<br/>
But I want to enjoy the conference vicariously.  That&#39;s fun in a minor way.<br/>
