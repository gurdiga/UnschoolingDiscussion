<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217196876">We were sitting eating dinner and Bryan remembered at 7about lighting the <br/>
candle. We quickly got a small one and went outside and were holding it. We <br/>
wanted to leave something burning for awhile. . . seemed the right thing to <br/>
do. I remembered that Bryan had given me this candle for Christmas that was a <br/>
tower looking thing (I guess it was a castle, but it looked like a tower. . . <br/>
like two of them actually). I found it and brought it outside, holding it <br/>
reverently and we placed it at the end of the driveway, each of us silently <br/>
giving our own prayer/thought up to the universe . . . we stayed outside for <br/>
awhile watching it and watching the planes flying overhead again . . .  it is <br/>
still lit at 11. . . I imagine that it will melt all the way and the towers <br/>
will be no more in the morning. I had thought about lighting it a few weeks <br/>
ago, and something told me no, there will be a better day. Tonight, it was. <br/>
