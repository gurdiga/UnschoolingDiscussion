the HSLDA@Capitol Hill E-lert 
Service...<br>&nbsp;----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>&nbsp;April 
2, 2001<br><br>&nbsp;Dear Michigan Members and Friends,<br><br>&nbsp;On March 
27, 2001, state Representative Michael Switalski and eight<br>&nbsp;other 
cosponsors introduced a bill that would burden home school<br>&nbsp;families 
with a heavy and unfair testing requirement. House Bill 4521<br>&nbsp;would 
require each Michigan home school child to take the 
Michigan<br>&nbsp;Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) test for each subject 
area in<br>&nbsp;which MEAP is administered to public school students in the 
child&#39;s<br>&nbsp;grade level. Additionally, home school parents would have to 
submit<br>&nbsp;their child&#39;s completed test to the Department of the 
Treasury.<br><br>&nbsp;This is similar to a measure proposed just a few weeks 
ago in the<br>&nbsp;Maine Senate. Maine home schoolers loudly objected to the 
state&#39;s<br>&nbsp;trying to force their children to take the public school tests. 
By<br>&nbsp;clearly conveying this opposition through an outpouring of 
phone<br>&nbsp;calls and packing out a legislative hearing room, home schoolers 
got<br>&nbsp;their message across to their legislators and the bill was killed 
by<br>&nbsp;a joint committee. (For more information on the Maine battle, 
see<br>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.hslda.org/elink.asp?ID=45).">http://www.hslda.org/elink.asp?ID=45).</a><br><br>&nbsp;Here 
in Michigan, now is our opportunity to head H.B. 4521 off at the<br>pass, before 
it comes up for a floor vote. Every phone call is<br>&nbsp;important in the 
effort to defeat this dangerous bill.<br><br>&nbsp;REQUESTED ACTION:<span

<div><tt><span class="ygrps-yiv-2000265354170452201-03042001">&nbsp;</span><br>Please call as many 
H.B. 4521 sponsors (listed below) as possible and<br>&nbsp;give them this 
message:<br><br>&nbsp;&quot;Please withdraw H.B. 4521, which imposes unnecessary 
testing<br>&nbsp;requirements on home school students. Home schooling works. 
This bill<br>&nbsp;limits parental rights and is a waste of taxpayers 
dollars.&quot;<br><br>&nbsp;These legislators need to know that home schoolers in 
Michigan<br>&nbsp;appreciate their freedom and do not want to be regulated. The 
goal is<br>&nbsp;to nip this legislation in the bud and to send a clear message 
to<br>&nbsp;prevent such onerous legislation from being introduced again 
anytime<br>&nbsp;soon.<br><br>&nbsp;SPONSORS OF H.B. 4521<br>&nbsp;Rep. Michael 
Switalski, (517) 373-0854<br>&nbsp;Rep. Ruth Ann Jamnick, (517)

HSLDA&#39;s legislative toolbox<br>&nbsp;at <a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.hslda.org/toolbox.">http://www.hslda.org/toolbox.</a><br><br>&nbsp;BACKGROUND:<br><br>&nbsp;The 
main sponsor, Rep. Michael Switalski, has already indicated that<br>&nbsp;he is 
not interested in withdrawing the bill. He recently wrote, &quot;The<br>&nbsp;bill 
was suggested by a constituent, and I agree with its purpose.<br>&nbsp;While 
there are many good home schoolers who do their job<br>&nbsp;conscientiously, 
there are a few who abuse the program and use it for<br>&nbsp;inappropriate 
purposes or to avoid scrutiny of a dysfunctional<br>&nbsp;domestic situation. 
Since oversight of home schooling is not<br>&nbsp;feasible, this testing would 
provide a measure of review and<br>&nbsp;evaluation.&quot;<br><br>&nbsp;It is 
important for home schoolers to inform the sponsors of this<br>&nbsp;bill of 
their opposition. Even though you may not be one of these<br>&nbsp;legislators&#39; 
constituents, they need to know that this bill will<br>&nbsp;affect all home 
schoolers&#39; rights.<br><br>&nbsp;Information Network of Christian Homes (INCH), 
along with many other<br>&nbsp;organizations, joins HSLDA in opposing this 
bill.<br><br>&nbsp;We base our opposition on the following 
reasons:<br><br>&nbsp;The MEAP test is a highly content-specific test, based on 
the state&#39;s<br>&nbsp;public school curriculum. It is not a nationally 
recognized<br>&nbsp;standardized achievement test. Public schools teach students 
to the<br>&nbsp;specific content that the test covers, but home school families 
do<br>&nbsp;not normally use the same curriculum as public schools. It is 
unfair<br>&nbsp;to test home school students on material they may not have 
been<br>&nbsp;taught.<br><br>&nbsp;No state in the country requires home school 
children to take the<br>&nbsp;state&#39;s assessment.<br>&nbsp;One of the reasons 
home schooling is so successful is that parents<br>&nbsp;have a choice to 
determine the educational program that is most<br>&nbsp;effective for their own 
children. If home schoolers are required to<br>&nbsp;take the state assessment, 
which is based on the curriculum of the<br>&nbsp;public school, there will be 
unfair pressure on parents to give up<br>&nbsp;the curriculum they believe is 
best for their child and instead teach<br>&nbsp;the public school curriculum. No 
one wants his or her child to have<br>&nbsp;the stigma of a low score on the 
MEAP.<br><br>&nbsp;It is financially irresponsible to require testing of home 
school<br>&nbsp;students when there is no evidence that home schoolers are 
failing.<br>&nbsp;In fact, the evidence is to the contrary. Scores of 
independent<br>&nbsp;studies conducted around the country and in Michigan prove 
that home<br>&nbsp;schoolers on the average score 20û30 points above the 
national<br>&nbsp;average on standardized achievement tests. (See<br>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.hslda.org/elink.asp?ID=46.)">http://www.hslda.org/elink.asp?ID=46.)</a><br><br>&nbsp;Let&#39;s 
send the message that home schoolers have earned the right to<br>&nbsp;be left 
alone. Please call the state representatives listed above.<br><br>&nbsp;Thank 
you for standing with us for family and 
freedom.<br><br>&nbsp;Sincerely,<br>&nbsp;Christopher J. Klicka<br>&nbsp;HSLDA

&gt;Wow! I didn&#39;t realize how lucky we are to be in<br/>
&gt;Michigan! Maryland sounds like it&#39;s trying to make<br/>
&gt;homeschooling a hassle. Here, you just don&#39;t send your<br/>
&gt;kids to school. Period. No forms, no record-keeping,<br/>
&gt;no state involvement, no testing, nothing. I hope<br/>
&gt;those strict states loosen up as time goes on.... it<br/>
&gt;must be very hard on unschoolers.<br/>
