<div id="ygrps-yiv-686961390">First of all, I&#39;ve enjoyed the converstations here. While I don&#39;t <br/>
feel a couple questions have been answered concretely, I will go read <br/>
(again) through unschooling.com and Sandra&#39;s website (if I am correct <br/>
in thinking you are the same Sandra Dodd). <br/>
<br/>
I will also look into Sandra&#39;s suggestion of the &quot;Unschooling <br/>
Otherwise&quot; section, which I do with a smile at the &quot;otherwise&quot; as if <br/>
coming from a Christian viewpoint is somehow less worthy or <br/>
meaningful than &quot;true&quot; unschooling as the inference seems to be and <br/>
general discussion since I joined this list have indicated. <br/>
<br/>
So long and thanks for all the fish!<br/>

No, I swiped it from the lingo of the English homeschooling terminology.  <br/>
&quot;Otherwise&quot; as different from the school.  &quot;Education otherwise,&quot; which I <br/>
think is taken from the wording of the law in England.  Then Japanese <br/>
homeschoolers borrowed it.  Then I used it because I needed a one-word <br/>
indicator to cover all the kinds of things I had put on that page early on, <br/>
and when it was expanded the address stayed the same so links would still <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
When and if &quot;a Christian viewpoint&quot; keeps unschooling from working, as it <br/>
sometimes does, though, then it is less worthy from my radical unschooling <br/>
point of view, and in my personal opinion.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966258752">I just wanted to come back to this and point out that I am a <br/>
Christian and I unschool and I don&#39;t think that the two contradict <br/>
each other.  <br/>
