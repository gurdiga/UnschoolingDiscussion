<div id="ygrps-yiv-26992236">I could use some help here, could anybody send me some good unschooling sites my 13yo could go to to see how other people are learning and so she can better grasp the unschooling philosophy! she is beginning to panic that she is not getting what the kids in school are, I told her that was her brains way of telling her it was time to dive into something that was exciting to learn about!<br/>
(conversation was much more than that ) so if everyone who has a good site she can visit to see other unschoolers in progress I think it ould help  thank you!<br/>
she also only sees local homeschool/unschoolers and isn&#39;t getting how many of us there really are in the world!<br/>

other unschooled kids, as well as regular message boards peopled mostly by <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372427001">Hi Tanya,<br/>
Here is a site by the Virginia DOE: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pen.k12.va.us/VDOE/Instruction/wmstds/home.shtml">http://www.pen.k12.va.us/VDOE/Instruction/wmstds/home.shtml</a><br/>

My DD went through the same thing.  She wanted to make sure she was learning enough.  So I gave her a test and told her if she felt that she really had to know she could take the test, but that she should trust herself.  Anyway, she never took the test as far as I know.  I just bought her a book called, &#39;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&#39; by Grace Llewellyn to help ease her mind and teach her how to unschool and trust herself.<br/>
