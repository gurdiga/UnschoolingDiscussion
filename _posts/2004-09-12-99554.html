places in US in alphabetical order AK, CT, DC, ID, IL, IN, MI, NJ, <br/>
OK, TX. I think there are a couple of provinces in Canada that are <br/>
also pretty hands-off but don&#39;t have details handy.<br/>

Some places may have strict laws which are laxly enforced. Also, <br/>
someplaces may be legally unrestricted but have a lot of DCS <br/>
interference.</div>

places to completely freely unschool with no interference of any kind - <br/>

other places with homeschooling law, but also the option of private <br/>
school freedom.<br/>
