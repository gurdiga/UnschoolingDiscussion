<div id="ygrps-yiv-50373239">A counselor who thinks it is possible or desirable to discuss homeschooling <br/>
decisions while &quot;leaving the children out of the issue&quot; is operating from a <br/>
truly bizarre frame of reference (unfortunately a common one in this culture) <br/>

<br/>
Unless you wish to be converted, I&#39;d highly suggest finding another therapist <br/>
who is at least not going to be working against you.<br/>
<br/>
Neither you or your husband are going to be helped by counselors who help one <br/>
of you gang up on the other. You need someone who will take on the far harder <br/>
task of helping you each listen to each other.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing the counselor was really trying to get to what they dynamics are <br/>
between the husband and wife about the issue of the kids.<br/>
