<div id="ygrps-yiv-44523463">For math anxious parents I highly recommend the book Math: Facing an<br/>
American Phobia by Marilyn Burns (also the author of books for kids--The I<br/>
Hate Mathematics Book and Math for Smarty Pants). Burns writes well about<br/>
math phobia and offers concrete ways to teach math so as to avoid<br/>
perpetuating the anxiety in our children. She&#39;s not writing from a<br/>
homeschooling point of view, but I found a lot of encouragement for our<br/>
math-in-context approach and she helped me relax about paper-and-pencil math<br/>
skills (which are not as important as schools might have us believe).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629852798">Another good book is &quot;Overcoming Math Anxiety&quot; by Sheila Tobias. Pretty<br/>
good -- I didn&#39;t finish reading it though because it was overdue. It seems<br/>
more geared toward women, but pretty good on the whole. ~Eryn<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read a  bunch of her books, too and then relaxed.  We also got into <br/>
tessalations, pattern blocks, toothpick and marshmallow constructions, rolled <br/>
up newspaper geodesic domes( my 7 yo dd told us tonight that  did we know <br/>
that the triangle is the most stable figure) and many other art <br/>
activities--all mathematical thinking. Music is mathematical . We have an <br/>
interesting book(now out of print) called The Mathematical Basis of the Arts. <br/>
Both kids know how much money they have and both can always divide by 2!!!1<br/>
