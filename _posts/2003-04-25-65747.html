<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595282218">The &quot;selective hearing&quot; option SOUNDS good in theory, but I think it&#39;s a bad <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m upset about something and my dh tunes me out on purpose, is that <br/>
helpful to our relationship? I think children don&#39;t have the communication <br/>
skills of an adult and whining is going to happen. <br/>
If you decide to ignore it, chances are the child is going to feel worse, not <br/>
better! And I&#39;m quite sure it won&#39;t cure whining.<br/>
I say to Sierra &quot;If you could use a different voice I could hear you better&quot; <br/>
in reference to a whiny sounding voice. But I take the complaint/desire very <br/>
seriously.<br/>
<br/>
A child that wants a pool and can&#39;t have a pool has LOADS of other options.<br/>
Our job is to brainstorm ideas with them......<br/>
Swimming at an indoor public pool, buying a small wading pool (heck, we&#39;ve <br/>
had swim time in our teensy kitchen with a wading pool!) having a water fight <br/>
somewhere with water guns or water balloons, A large bucket full of water on <br/>
the patio or deck to sit and play in, filling the bathtub up SUPER full and <br/>
putting swim trunks on (covering the floor with towels is helpful to avoid <br/>
flooding damage :), water play in the kitchen sink....<br/>
Anyway, you get the idea.<br/>
There are always options. Being creative and coming up with solutions to a <br/>
need is MUCH more helpful than ignoring a desire.<br/>
At the very least you can sympathize and say things like &quot;if I had a magic <br/>
wand I&#39;d make a pool appear right in our apartment!&quot; <br/>
Fantasize about what it would be like to have a big pool right in the room, <br/>
or if the streets were canals and you had to swim to the grocery store. Find <br/>
ways to turn the negative into a positive.<br/>
Follow the flow of electricity! (negative to positive)...:)<br/>

And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>
