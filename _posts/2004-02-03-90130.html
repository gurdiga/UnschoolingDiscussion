<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If unschoolers believe that kids learn to read when they are ready, how <br/>

it, most of these people went to school and some even graduated! They are <br/>
exposed to a lot of books, Like unschoolers are, but yet they do not read. I was <br/>
laying in bed last night wondering about that! You guys always have such <br/>
excellent advice and great comments, I thought Id ask you!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
They went to school, you say! Unbelievable! And GRADUATED! My word! Did you <br/>
know there was a &quot;non-reading degree&quot; given at a small college here in <br/>
Columbia, SC? Really. A &quot;non-reading degree&quot;! Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
All those illiterates have been coerced into learning before they were ready. <br/>
Given time, understanding, patience, and the written word, a healthy child <br/>
with an engaging parent will inevitably read by playing. It&#39;s just another part <br/>
of the unschooling world.<br/>
<br/>
Those that become illiterate adults are not &quot;playing&quot; at reading: they are <br/>
WORKING at reading. Doing something they find hard and/or unpleasant because <br/>
someone else is forcing them to.<br/>
<br/>
Play will result in learning painlessly. Work will result in resentment and <br/>
avoidance.<br/>
