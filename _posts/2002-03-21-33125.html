was. Her death was sudden but not unexpected - she had terminal cancer<br/>
and deteriorated rapidly over the last 4 days of her life, going from<br/>
weak but lucid to comatose, and then dying. We - her family and friends -<br/>
 weren&#39;t quite done talking to her, we weren&#39;t ready, and it was helpful<br/>
to have her actual face to talk to. My brother hadn&#39;t seen her for 5<br/>
months, except for a few minutes the night before she died. He,<br/>
especially, needed to just look at her - not a photo, not a memory, but<br/>
her face. Cacie needed a photo of her in the casket (digital cameras are<br/>
useful), I&#39;m not sure why but it was part of her grieving. Some of us<br/>
kissed her face, I smoothed her hair so it looked right again, one last<br/>
thing to do for her...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think bodies are something to be scared of, or repulsed by. This<br/>
is the body that had held us, hugged us, smiled on us, given birth to the<br/>
three of us. These are the hands that made cookies, the mouth that<br/>
smiled, the forehead that wrinkled in exasperation, the feet that waded<br/>
in the Sea of Cortez. For me, anyway, the body is a reminder of all of<br/>
those things, and of the soul who dwelt within. <br/>
<br/>
My whole family seemed to understand that what is done with a body after<br/>
death is done for the benefit of the living, not the dead. It&#39;s your<br/>
right to chose a closed casket after your death, but it might not be the<br/>
best thing for the people who love you at the time. <br/>

This is beautiful. What a wonderful way to remember your mom.<br/>
I never met her and I have tears in my eyes.<br/>

Very well put.  Some one said they didn&#39;t want any one looking at them after<br/>
they were dead ... after you are dead do think that hang up willl be gone?<br/>
Do you really think you will care after you are dead?<br/>
As you said -- anything that the living does after a person is dead is for<br/>
the living.  As far as I am concerned my loved ones can do whatever they<br/>
need to do as long as it isn&#39;t fighting about what posessions may be left.<br/>
