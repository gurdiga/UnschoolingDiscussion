I think you handled it well Brenda...I loving approach is good.  We don&#39;t always know what is going on, but if my is on her last nerve, and someone is kind, that does help her have time to regroup.<br/>

  &gt; How exactly do you approach a situation like this?  I have the hardest time in<br/>
  &gt; public when I witness other parents being hurtful to their children (not just<br/>
  &gt; through spanking but through belittling, saying hurtful things, etc).<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve stepped into a situations like you described in the restaurant by<br/>
  saying something directly to the parent about how cute their toddler is, or<br/>
  how nicely their boys are sitting, whatever I can dream up that they *are*<br/>
  doing well.  Then when they give me one of those wary &quot;thank you&#39;s&quot; I carry<br/>
  on with how proud they surely must be of them and how I hope they will tell<br/>
  them that every time they&#39;re this good, and of course their age-appropriate<br/>
  little antics aren&#39;t bothering me in the least, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve walked up to a couple of different mothers who were spanking and<br/>
  berating their children in public and asked, quietly, if they needed a break<br/>
  to pull themselves together.  One swore at me and left, and one froze, burst<br/>
  into tears, and sat down.  We chatted for quite a while about how tiring<br/>
  parenting can be and I tried to help her with some better ideas, and I left<br/>
  hopeful that maybe things would improve a bit for her daughter.<br/>
<br/>
  I believe that someone needs to step in sometimes, but I&#39;m also not very<br/>
  good at doing it.  More ideas are certainly welcome, because I&#39;m not usually<br/>
  sure what the right thing to say is.<br/>

Well good for you in saying something either when the kids are good or the <br/>
parents are bad! I think it seems like you did the right thing in the latter <br/>
case. You will always have someone not want to listen but you also had <br/>
someone who needed some help. You gave it to her if just for a moment. That <br/>
might make the difference the next time.<br/>
<br/>
I would love ideas too, as when I do say something, I have a tendency to <br/>
come across a bit harsh. &lt;BG&gt; I&#39;m a wimp when it comes to sticking up for <br/>
myself, but bother my kids or other kids, I&#39;m different. I guess I over <br/>
compensate.<br/>

<br/>
I really think people get away with bad stuff by relying on our good<br/>
manners.   We are shocked, but we&#39;re decent people and we try to over<br/>
look what ever the bad thing is.  They get to keep doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Would we be worrying about being gentle to a man who was hitting a woman?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how we can change the situation for kids who are getting<br/>
spanked if we don&#39;t speak up.  I just honestly don&#39;t know if it&#39;s<br/>
possible to do it *nicely*.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we just have to get used to throwing up after.<br/>

Brenda, I think your action was right on!  Compassionate intervention is<br/>
always best, just saying &quot;Stop that!&quot; doesn&#39;t do much, IMO.  I&#39;ve stopped<br/>
to say something sweet to the child and even an angry mother is more<br/>
open, sometimes she will begin to chat and even tell me how frustrated<br/>
she is.  I&#39;ll commiserate and then ask if she would like to know what<br/>
works for me, by this point they always do.  Scolding the parent only<br/>
generates more anger, certainly not helping anyone.<br/>

By thinking about the child.  I&#39;m not nice to the mom because it comes<br/>
naturally but I know that anger and abruptness will only make it worse<br/>
for the child.  It&#39;s a suck it in, control myself and be calm for the<br/>
child&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
What usually happens though is that when the mom begins to talk about her<br/>
frustration I tend to be less angry.  I&#39;ve met very few parents who<br/>
didn&#39;t care about how they were parenting, they may too entrenched in old<br/>
and accepted ways but not purposefully negligent.<br/>

Rachel Ann, is it your experience that Jewish families are more patient and <br/>
loving with their children than others?<br/>
