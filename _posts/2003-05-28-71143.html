<br/>
Blue Hawaii, with Elvis Presley.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some National Geographic things about Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;d avoid &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; the originally-for-IMAX thing with erupting <br/>
volcanoes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
On the DVD of that, though, there&#39;s a bonus video which is all close-up of <br/>
lava, with music and no voice.<br/>

Charlton Heston was head of the NRA, and a fairly radically-conservative <br/>

could butt-shoot pacifists at 50 paces with one posteriorly-located, <br/>

does something really slimey in real life, I can&#39;t stand to watch him in movies <br/>
or performing anymore.  From all appearances, it seemed like Tom Cruise left <br/>
Nicole and jumped into the waiting arms of Penelope Cruz (could be wrong, don&#39;t <br/>
follow movie mags).  I&#39;ve never liked him since.  Even someone like Phil <br/>
Collins...years ago he left his wife of many, many years for someone about 20 or 30 <br/>
years younger than her.  Can&#39;t stand to listen to him sing anymore, even the <br/>
old stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I LOVED Dragonfly too....bawled like a baby...  I like Kevin Costner, <br/>
but my husband says he has no personality....seems like the same character in <br/>
all his movies.  Can&#39;t really argue with that..<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t like any of them, but I must say Tom Cruise didn&#39;t look bad <br/>
with the long hair.   My understanding, as I remember this tidbit <br/>
from LONG ago is that Kevin Costner screwed American Indians out of <br/>
some land in Montna (I believe) after filming Dances with Wolves <br/>
which I love and cannot watch.  Big jerk and Hypocrit as far as I am <br/>
concerned.   These days all my favorites, I cannot watch because I <br/>
get to overwhelmed.  I buy the movie and it just sits there, oh well <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757869917">I don&#39;t think Charlton Heston has ever done anything the least bit slimey in <br/>
real life.  He is still with his wife who is the first woman he ever dated.  <br/>
He raised his kids nicely and did all kinds of physical family vacations with <br/>
them.  He was good to his mother, and his step father, and his sister.  He <br/>
researched his historical parts and characters and locations himself, instead of <br/>
just showing up and taking someone else&#39;s word for it.<br/>
<br/>
But that said, I have friends who have expressed what you have about certain <br/>
actors, and it baffles me (and makes me think they&#39;re not too analytical, or <br/>
that they have a teen-fan mentality).   Maybe it&#39;s because they don&#39;t really <br/>
care about acting or music or whatever it is.  Maybe they are using <br/>
identification with famous people for something I totally do not understand, but for <br/>
example my friend Wendy used to love Harrison Ford above all actors, and owned all <br/>
Harrison Ford movies.  He left his wife, and she hates Harrison Ford now, and <br/>
will not watch his movies, and doesn&#39;t want God to let him be on any more <br/>
magazine covers.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s crazy.<br/>
<br/>
And Michael Jackson, even if he has made some unfortunate cosmetic choices <br/>
and even if he is an arrested development nutcase, has still written some really <br/>
good music and survived a crazed abused life.   And he can dance.  And there <br/>
is video of when he was dancing and NOT so sadly messed up.<br/>
<br/>
My sister decided never to listen to Linda Ronstadt nor to watch The Pirates <br/>
of Penzance because they were at the same party in 1972 or some damned time <br/>
and Ms. Ronstadt lured someone&#39;s boyfriend into private frolic and then left <br/>
town.   So her music sucks (in my sister&#39;s world).<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me the ultimate prejudice to judge someone for a socio-political <br/>
sin and to go backwards and brand all his work prior to that as tainted or <br/>
unworthy.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s being done now with the King James Bible, which for hundreds of years <br/>
was worshipped by many Christians as the perfect, inspired word of God.   Ah, <br/>
but lately scholars are saying James was not quite a heterosexual model of the <br/>
American family man.   Yeah?  Duh.  *HE* didn&#39;t translate the Bible any more <br/>
than Elizabeth herself built those ships and sailed against the Spanish Armada <br/>
or Victoria personally made everyone sexually uptight.  Royalty gets their <br/>
label on stuff in England.  Ancient tradition.   <br/>
<br/>
So now Americans in DROVES are rejecting the King James Version (KJV as it <br/>
was once lovingly referred to) for being the evil project of a sodomite.  I <br/>
suspect the language finally became too archaic for them and they need a reason to <br/>
dump it.  So homosexuality is scapegoated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really hoping my kids will judge art on its own merits, not on whether <br/>
the artist had a cute butt, or whether the songwriter was a pinko commie.  I <br/>
don&#39;t mind thinking Wendy and my sister and the Jackson 5 detractors are lacking <br/>
in philosophy, but I hate to think there are unschoolers who will pass on to <br/>
their children that what&#39;s REALLY important about music, acting or art is <br/>
whether we &quot;like&quot; the artist.<br/>
<br/>
That said, Kevin Costner seems to be paid huge amounts of money for doing a <br/>
lame job.  He seems to walk through roles and then act like he&#39;s just bested <br/>
Laurence Olivier.  Arrogance, I think.  And arrogance without a basis for it.    <br/>
If it were confidence in true ability, it wouldn&#39;t seem arrogant.  Maybe he&#39;s <br/>
a good businessman who can keep his own franchise afloat financially.  And <br/>
maybe he&#39;s there because lots of women find him attractive.  I don&#39;t, so maybe <br/>
because there&#39;s no sexual spell woven I see the flaws?  Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the thing with Charlton Heston&#39;s anti-fans?  They don&#39;t think they&#39;d <br/>
have ever wanted to go to bed with him no matter when they were born?  <br/>
<br/>
Is much of this sort of attraction/revulsion sexual?  (My husband would be <br/>
wanting to say &quot;yes,&quot; that it has to do with fantasy relationships, but lots of <br/>
his favorite music has NO &quot;personalities&quot; behind it and he couldn&#39;t begin to <br/>
tell you who&#39;s even in the group, not by name or face.)  Can we only cheer on <br/>
people we can identify with?  If that&#39;s true, then only art by the sexy and <br/>
commendable is &quot;art&quot;??<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think Charlton Heston has ever done anything the least bit slimey <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; real life.  He is still with his wife who is the first woman he ever dated.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He raised his kids nicely and did all kinds of physical family vacations <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; them.  He was good to his mother, and his step father, and his sister.  He <br/>
&gt; researched his historical parts and characters and locations himself, <br/>
&gt; instead of <br/>
&gt; just showing up and taking someone else&#39;s word for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Around here, he&#39;s almost viewed as a hero, as many, many people rely on their <br/>
guns to eat.  Walmart stays open 24 hours (usually closes at 11:00) and <br/>
school is closed for the first week of deer season.  :o)  Personally, I like him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Maybe it&#39;s because they don&#39;t really <br/>
&gt; care about acting or music or whatever it is.  Maybe they are using <br/>
&gt; identification with famous people for something I totally do not understand, <br/>
&gt; but for <br/>
&gt; example my friend Wendy used to love Harrison Ford above all actors, and <br/>
&gt; owned all <br/>
&gt; Harrison Ford movies.  He left his wife, and she hates Harrison Ford now, <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; will not watch his movies, and doesn&#39;t want God to let him be on any more <br/>
&gt; magazine covers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s crazy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d call it crazy.  It&#39;s hypocritical for him to be on a <br/>
magazine cover, pictured as a loving, loyal husband who dumped his long time wife. <br/>
 I wonder how it makes his original wife and children feel to see them.  <br/>
<br/>
I admire certain actors/artists not only for their acting ability, but their <br/>
&quot;causes&quot;, views, etc.  I love U2, but I also love the band because they donate <br/>
tons of money to causes they believe in, they speak against injustices.  <br/>
Often a song writer will write about his passions, and the line between their <br/>
private lives and their music/acting will sort of mesh.  Call me crazy, but when <br/>
someone is singing &quot;Looks like we made it....&quot;, supposedly written about her <br/>
and her husband, makes millions on it, and a few months later has left him and <br/>
is dating someone else...I just can&#39;t look at the song in the same way (not <br/>
that I ever liked it to begin with!)  When someone is singing about love, <br/>
marriage, leading a Christian life, and then leaves her husband of many years to <br/>
marry someone else who has left their wife of many years (Amy Grant and Vince <br/>
Gill), I just don&#39;t have the same respect for them or their &quot;work&quot;...it seems very <br/>
hypocritical to me.  Remember Michael Landon?  He left his wife and family to <br/>
start a new one, and was constantly preaching &quot;family values.&quot;  *shrug*  this <br/>
sort of thing just bothers me...I guess it&#39;s a fault of mine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And Michael Jackson, even if he has made some unfortunate cosmetic choices <br/>
&gt; and even if he is an arrested development nutcase, has still written some <br/>
&gt; really <br/>
&gt; good music and survived a crazed abused life.   And he can dance.  And there <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is video of when he was dancing and NOT so sadly messed up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the saddest thing about Michael Jackson is that he obviously had some <br/>
real deep problems...self esteem, abuse when he was younger, never being able <br/>
to BE a child.  None of these things were addressed and when he tried to fix <br/>
things in his own way (cosmetic surgery, fantasy living (?)) it was all done <br/>
in the public eye.  He was/is a very talented person who just has a lot of <br/>
problems. :o(  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s being done now with the King James Bible, which for hundreds of <br/>
&gt; years <br/>
&gt; was worshipped by many Christians as the perfect, inspired word of God.   <br/>
&gt; Ah, <br/>
&gt; but lately scholars are saying James was not quite a heterosexual model of <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; American family man.   Yeah?  Duh.  *HE* didn&#39;t translate the Bible any more <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; than Elizabeth herself built those ships and sailed against the Spanish <br/>
&gt; Armada <br/>
&gt; or Victoria personally made everyone sexually uptight.  Royalty gets their <br/>
&gt; label on stuff in England.  Ancient tradition.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now Americans in DROVES are rejecting the King James Version (KJV as it <br/>
&gt; was once lovingly referred to) for being the evil project of a sodomite.  I <br/>
&gt; suspect the language finally became too archaic for them and they need a <br/>
&gt; reason to <br/>
&gt; dump it.  So homosexuality is scapegoated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if homosexuality is the whole thing...being of a Catholic <br/>
background, we have problems with it in other areas...things being left out, others <br/>
being added.  I think Christians are just being dealt now what Catholics have <br/>
been saddled with their whole lives...being labled &quot;unrighteous&quot; because of <br/>
things like the crusades, indulgences, etc...things their &quot;leaders&quot; or those in <br/>
charge did in the name of their religion.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really hoping my kids will judge art on its own merits, not on whether <br/>
&gt; the artist had a cute butt, or whether the songwriter was a pinko commie.  I <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t mind thinking Wendy and my sister and the Jackson 5 detractors are <br/>
&gt; lacking <br/>
&gt; in philosophy, but I hate to think there are unschoolers who will pass on to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; their children that what&#39;s REALLY important about music, acting or art is <br/>
&gt; whether we &quot;like&quot; the artist.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With the whole Linda Ronstadt thing...what if she had stolen your SISTER&#39;S <br/>
boyfriend..as a human being how could she ever look at Linda Ronstadt the same?  <br/>
What if Linda Ronstadt had called Hispanic American&#39;s dirty spics then made <br/>
an album of Mexican music?  Would she deserve respect from Hispanic people <br/>
because she has a lovely voice?<br/>
<br/>
  I love the book, &#39;The Education of Little Tree&quot;....but it DOES sadden me to <br/>
know that the author also wrote white supremecist speeches...I just can&#39;t <br/>
look at it the same way.  If it turned out that a favorite actor of mine <br/>
supported a cause I absolutely disagreed with, should I give him more money to support <br/>
that cause by buying his DVD&#39;s because he&#39;s a great actor?  He&#39;s a <br/>
hypocritical pig...who CARES what a great actor he is...there are PLENTY of other great <br/>
actors out there, unknowns who have never gotten a break.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; That said, Kevin Costner seems to be paid huge amounts of money for doing a <br/>
&gt; lame job.  He seems to walk through roles and then act like he&#39;s just bested <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Laurence Olivier.  Arrogance, I think.  And arrogance without a basis for <br/>
&gt; it.    <br/>
&gt; If it were confidence in true ability, it wouldn&#39;t seem arrogant.  Maybe <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s <br/>
&gt; a good businessman who can keep his own franchise afloat financially.  And <br/>
&gt; maybe he&#39;s there because lots of women find him attractive.  I don&#39;t, so <br/>
&gt; maybe <br/>
&gt; because there&#39;s no sexual spell woven I see the flaws?  Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe.  Hubby says he just has the personality of a sweatsock.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Can we only cheer on <br/>

&gt; commendable is &quot;art&quot;??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, I don&#39;t think so.  I personally just have a &quot;thing&quot; with people who have <br/>
been married for a long, long time, through thick and thin, through stardom <br/>
and all, then once at the top, they dump the one who helped them get there.  <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just a loyalty thing.  <br/>

in<br/>
all his movies.  Can&#39;t really argue with that..&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
You know I don&#39;t really give much thought about why I like or don&#39;t like<br/>
people I don&#39;t know. I either do or don&#39;t. But I think that is a factor with<br/>
Costner. Same thing all the time. Seems boring. Maybe between the subject of<br/>
the movie Dragonfly and him being so confused and out of it in the movie<br/>
(possibly not a stretch for him!) that&#39;s why I love that one.<br/>

&lt;&lt;It seems to me the ultimate prejudice to judge someone for a<br/>
socio-political<br/>
sin and to go backwards and brand all his work prior to that as tainted or<br/>
unworthy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree. We can not like what they did or how they seem on a talk show but<br/>
when it&#39;s come to someone&#39;s music or acting or talent, well you have to just<br/>
look and see that they are really good. Doesn&#39;t really change the way you<br/>
feel about them. Someone leaving their spouse should have no bearing. We<br/>
really have NO idea what they are like behind closed doors. When I divorced<br/>
my first husband, everyone wondered why, he was such a sweetheart. Little<br/>
did they know and from what they saw, he was an angel. Home alone can be a<br/>
whole different story!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a big football nut. I have to admit Danny Marino was a great<br/>
quarterback. I can&#39;t stand him though personally. Doesn&#39;t take away what<br/>
he&#39;s accomplished. I wouldn&#39;t stand in line for an autograph but I went to<br/>
the games. Terry Bradshaw, not half as good. Really nice guy. Joe Namath, in<br/>
between on both aspects!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is much of this sort of attraction/revulsion sexual?  (My husband would be<br/>
wanting to say &quot;yes,&quot; that it has to do with fantasy relationships, but lots<br/>

on<br/>
people we can identify with?  If that&#39;s true, then only art by the sexy and<br/>
commendable is &quot;art&quot;??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have this running joke. When I look at a guy, any guy,<br/>
either right in front of me or on tv, I see him as doable or not. (gasp!!!!)<br/>
What can I say, for as long as I can remember, I&#39;ve thought this way. Never<br/>
act on it, but it comes to my mind right away. Joe will be the first to ask<br/>
me when I comment to someone and my friends do too. It&#39;s a big joke. Anyway,<br/>
just because I like someone doesn&#39;t mean I see them as doable. Like I would<br/>
go in a heartbeat to an Arnold S. movie, but he is in no way someone I would<br/>
do. So for me it is sexual but not in a I like what you do kind of way. I<br/>
guess I&#39;m strange!!<br/>

Divorces aren&#39;t always petty and spurious, and I think the more public a <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Some pretty close to my situation too. All my friends were his friends and<br/>
it was hard after I left. Then a very nasty custody battle unsued and no one<br/>
wanted to get involved. I left them all behind and started over with new<br/>
friends. Plus my choice of partners wasn&#39;t at all what people were<br/>
accustomed to. I went from a short, bald, older already divorced oldies<br/>
listening have to have everyone love him guy to a tall, mop headed, younger<br/>
never married hard rock listening not give a shit kind of guy!!!<br/>
The first treated me like a child and the second like a person. Didn&#39;t seem<br/>
to matter when it came to other peoples opinions. It&#39;s sad really.<br/>
<br/>
So now Tara&#39;s dad is living in the same old house in the same run down<br/>
neighborhood with a friend who has no car and works at a licquor store.<br/>
Tara&#39;s dad rarely works and when he does it&#39;s at a drugstore. He drives a<br/>
car his parents gave him and still talks a big story. He&#39;s 52 and prety much<br/>
alone. Friends don&#39;t stay long once they get the idea of his BS. I feel sad<br/>
for Tara having a dad like that. She gets embarrassed sometimes.<br/>

version of Landslide by the Dixie Chicks, and was thinking about getting the CD <br/>
just for that song. (Do not like country music.) Then, when they got <br/>
annihilated for doing the very thing that is supposed to be this country&#39;s back legs <br/>
(saying an opinion), I went and bought two copies to show support. And would <br/>
have bought more as gifts if I could! (And if you could wear a CD out, I&#39;d have <br/>
