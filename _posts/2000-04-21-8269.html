&lt;&lt; Though, that day he enjoyed doing it on his own, with me reading<br/>
 in the waiting room. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky with my younger son; if I arrived too early to pick him up, since <br/>
I volunteered with the same organization, there was always something I could <br/>
do, or people to chat with.  Sometimes my daughter, then 5, would volunteer!  <br/>
She <br/>
several times helped set up rooms for meetings, moving chairs around, putting <br/>
packets and pencils on tables, etc :)  Start &#39;em young!<br/>
<br/>
With my older son, I just arrived to pick him up, didn&#39;t go inside or <br/>
anything, so I always came armed with knitting and books--got a lot of <br/>
knitting and reading done :)<br/>
<br/>
Gotta be prepared for down time when you&#39;re driving kids around who don&#39;t <br/>
drive or don&#39;t have a car yet :)<br/>
