<br/>
Some of Charles Dickens&#39; novels were written as installment stories (like <br/>
soap operas) in the newspaper, and so letters from readers affected the <br/>
outcome.  We read them as full &quot;novels&quot; but they weren&#39;t written as novels in <br/>
the first place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417902977">I&#39;ve read responses about so called fluff books here and how<br/>
books by <br/>
Shakespeare and Dickens wrote the pulp fiction of their day. How <br/>
about Chaucer? I had an English Lit professor in high school call him<br/>
the Larry Flint of his day! <br/>
On to my question... Does anyone limit or restrict books their <br/>
children read? I ask this because my Mom always kept a fairly good <br/>
eye on what I read as a child.(until I was about 14 or so.)For<br/>
example, when I was about 11 I wanted to read `The Thornbirds&#39; and <br/>
when I was about 12 the book in question was Steven King&#39;s `It&#39;, and <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t let me. She did explain what her reasons were any time <br/>
she did this. Usually it was something like I know you can read the <br/>
book, but I don&#39;t think at this time in your life you will understand <br/>
the issues and themes in the book... or something like that. So far, <br/>
I have not done anything like this to my children, but have been <br/>
wondering what I would say if Moly (8) should come to me with one of <br/>
my books and ask if she could read it. Then again, I don&#39;t see my <br/>
child bringing one of my books and asking if she could read it. I see <br/>
me finding her wrapped in a blanket on the couch half way through it! <br/>
I guess it all boils down to, if you have an 8, 10, 12 year old with <br/>
reading abilities far advanced, do you take into consideration their <br/>
emotional advancement as well?<br/>

individual tales. These witnesses all had different orders and contents <br/>

nineteenth century most editions have followed these. In the 1930&#39;s a group <br/>
of scholars attempted to build a textual stemma for the entire poem including <br/>
the 20 000 lines extant in over 80 witnesses. The attempt failed because of <br/>
the volume of the material - the number of textual variants runs into <br/>
millions. Today, however, a group of researchers at four prominent <br/>
universities (Oxford University, Sheffield University, De Montfort University <br/>
and Brigham Young University) is slowly but surely carrying out the task in <br/>
what is called the Canterbury Tales Project. -=-<br/>

only getting a little bit of all the stuff about concubines, etc.  I <br/>
certainly enjoyed the book and the view it gave me of that culture at that <br/>
time.  I also remember going with my parents to see Never on Sunday.  I was <br/>
12, and I honestly had *no idea* that it was about a prostitute until years <br/>
later.  I just enjoyed all the music and dancing and stuff.  Nowadays, I&#39;d <br/>
be surprised to find a 12 year old who was that &quot;innocent&quot;.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-491850694">The kids in our homeschool group (mine included) are performing 3 of the<br/>
Canterbury Tales in 2 days!<br/>
Some of these tales are really racy and some are dark, but we&#39;ve toned them<br/>
down a bit for the kids.<br/>
They are doing<br/>
- The Nun&#39;s Priest Tale: The Nightmare Beast of the Firebrand Tail<br/>
- The Franklin&#39;s Tale: Love on the Rocks and<br/>
- The Pardoner&#39;s Tale: Death&#39;s Murderers.<br/>
<br/>
My 9 yos Jonathan will be playing &quot;Death&quot;. He loves it.<br/>
My other son has a few other great parts.<br/>
Should be *quite* a performance, come Saturday.<br/>

from the shelf and just starts reading - and also I just don&#39;t agree with<br/>
censorship. <br/>
<br/>
I do warn her if I know a book might be upsetting to her, just like I&#39;d<br/>
do with a tv show or a museum exhibit. I don&#39;t always know, though...<br/>
but, now she&#39;s reading Song of the Magdalene, and I happened to pick it<br/>
up and read it the other day, and there is a scene where Miriam is raped.<br/>
I did ask how far she&#39;d gotten, and mentioned that some pretty awful<br/>
things happen to Miriam later on, and she asked what... and after I<br/>
ascertained that she really wanted to know (she doesn&#39;t seem to mind<br/>
spoilers, in general), I told her... and she&#39;s still reading the book, I<br/>
think it&#39;s more being prepared...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No.  NEVER.  Jenni is 14 now and started picking her books out on the <br/>
first floor (the children&#39;s section was on the second floor) when she <br/>
was ten or eleven at the recommendation of the children&#39;s librarian.  <br/>
Mind you, the librarian recommended specific books but that got the <br/>
ball rolling and made Jenni realize that she could choose the <br/>
downstairs books too if she wanted to.  I think it just hadn&#39;t occured <br/>
to her yet.<br/>
<br/>
Jenni is 14 now and we both just read LK Hamilton&#39;s Anita Blake <br/>
Vampire Series.  Jenni reads faster than I do and was two books ahead <br/>
of me by the end.  There are some *VERY* adult themes in this <br/>
series especially in the last two books.  I asked her if she needed to <br/>
ask about anything and she said nope, she understood it.  And I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure she really does understand it - that she isn&#39;t <br/>
misinterpreting or anything.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s reading Anne Rice (last I looked.)  Although we need to hunt <br/>
down a new copy of the Witching Hour because mine&#39;s missing.  I&#39;m <br/>
sure there are some Christian parents out there who would want to <br/>
restrict these kinds  of books for religious reasons.  Not having that <br/>
factor in our lives, I just don&#39;t see any reason to patrol their <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, BTW, my other daughter . . . she reads Agatha Christie and other <br/>
mysteries of that style and time period.  She also has a penchant <br/>
for old tyme radio detective shows.  I found her two Saint tapes <br/>
and the library book sale Saturday and she was practically jumping <br/>
for joy!  She also collects old typewriters and fans and wants to set <br/>
up an office like Sam Spade&#39;s.<br/>

so much! Although my parent&#39;s weren&#39;t<br/>
really religious, there was a definite overall feeling that anything having<br/>
to do with witchcraft and general anti-christian subjects were highly taboo.<br/>
