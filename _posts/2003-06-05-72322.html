<br/>
&lt;&lt; a jump in technology from chalk to <br/>
<br/>
pencil isn&#39;t the same kind of jump as from pencil to calculator. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the calculator math teachers&#39; scenario rang false. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
When people are worshipful of pen and ink, the next question (backwards, not <br/>
forwards) is it important that they make their own quill pin?  Grind and mix <br/>
their own ink?  Make their own paper?<br/>
<br/>
At some point technology IS real.<br/>
<br/>
You can drive a car without needing to know how to build or even how to fix <br/>
one.  And although a quick thought suggests that with horses people needed to <br/>
know their horses personally, feed and clean them and train them, in lots of <br/>
situations people rode or drove horses they NEVER had to feed or brush, because <br/>
that&#39;s just how it was.  They had people to do that.<br/>
<br/>
So about calculators...<br/>
If people are going to &quot;do math&quot; (for example, in school) themselves on <br/>
paper, how far can that really go?  Bookkeeping isn&#39;t even done by hand anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
Slide rules and proportional rulers (those three-sided rulers lots of our <br/>
dads had, whatever they&#39;re called) kept people from having to do their own <br/>
calculations at one level, but they&#39;re useful for things you can&#39;t very well do on <br/>
paper.<br/>
<br/>
And in all cases, the real math is knowing what numbers to put into the <br/>
calculator, not knowing what buttons to push.<br/>
<br/>
Doing school math on paper is over 90 percent just pushing the buttons <br/>
someone else told you to push, and knowing times tables and &quot;subtraction facts.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a lame, tiny corner of mathematics.<br/>

wrong because he didn&#39;t show his work.  Problem was he didn&#39;t do math they <br/>
way they did it nor did he want to. So, they, the school said he was LD in math <br/>
also. Why? They never once got that he did it in his head instead they accused <br/>
him of &quot;cheating&quot; with a calculator.  I did ask a few times why a paper was <br/>
wrong and they said he didn&#39;t show the work.  (like he was secretly tapping <br/>
away on a calculator in class, they where not allowed)<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I brought him home that I noticed his actual method.<br/>
<br/>
When he has a figure he needs to do he does it in his head.  Multiplication <br/>
tables and memorizing them was difficult for him. He had his own way of the big <br/>
picture in his head not their one way teaches all.  Funny thing is he can do <br/>
division and fractions but when asked x tables he goes blank.  I noticed this <br/>
when he was trying to cook something and the measuring cup was missing so he <br/>
needed use a different one but was trying to figure out where to make up the <br/>
difference. I suggested the way I knew/learned in school and he went blank and <br/>
said Mom, I got it! Ok,lol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh I remember this so well in school. I have never been able to show my work <br/>
in math. It always annoyed me and the more the teacher insisted the harder it <br/>
was for me to understand. I was accused of looking at the answers in the back <br/>
of the book and I was horrified at been told to my face I was a cheater. It <br/>
had never occured to me to look up the answer, for I understood the question and <br/>
was able to answer it just couldn&#39;t show how I got there. Especially with <br/>
word problems. You know the ones where if you get on a train travelling to <br/>
Timbuctoo at yada yada yada, I always pictured myself on the train with a watch and <br/>
could calculate whatever was requested by simply putting myself there. Try <br/>
explaining that to your math teacher who has a personality of a protractor. <br/>
Geometry was even worse, because I have this whole space and time issue anyway, so <br/>
I would slip into these planes and if I could not fathom them regardless of <br/>
theory, it was a lost cause. To this day I don&#39;t know how I got thru all the <br/>
math that school required, because I simply don&#39;t see math like most everyone <br/>
else I know.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad my kids will never be faced with: &quot;you&#39;re doing it wrong!!!&quot; I don&#39;t <br/>
get what could be wrong if you get the answer right.<br/>
<br/>
Pam S. what do you do when you get students like me? <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who was a banker of all things until she retired 5 years ago LOL No <br/>
one cares how you get the answer in banking as long as it&#39;s the correct amount <br/>
of $$$.<br/>

I had such a difficult time buying the you have to do it this way, when I <br/>
found other ways to be so much easier. Just asking for clarification. And I loaned <br/>

&lt;&lt;who is it who writes that the way to get a solution is by getting <br/>
<br/>
into the problem.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book by James Adams about thinking.  He says that a problem like <br/>
there is one trail from the bottom of a mountain to the top.  A monk starts at <br/>
the top, walking down, and another monk starts at the same time, walking up <br/>
from the bottom.   Will they meet?  He says that question cannot be handled in <br/>
ANY way other than visualizing it.  No words and no numbers will help a single <br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called Conceptual Blockbusting, and it&#39;s a really wonderful book.  I&#39;ve <br/>
given several copies away over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Still in print after 25 years!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a blurb:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Book Description <br/>
<br/>
The best-selling guide to overcoming creative blocks and unleashing a torrent <br/>
of great ideas-updated for a new generation of problem solvers. <br/>
<br/>
James Adams&#39;s unique approach to generating ideas and solving problems has <br/>
captivated, inspired, and guided thousands of people from all walks of life. <br/>
Now, twenty-five years after its original publication, Conceptual Blockbusting <br/>
has never been more relevant, powerful, or fresh. Integrating insights from the <br/>
worlds of psychology, engineering, management, art, and philosophy, Adams <br/>
identifies the key blocks (perceptual, emotional, cultural, environmental, <br/>
intellectual, and expressive) that prevent us from realizing the full potential of <br/>
our fertile minds. Employing unconventional exercises and other interactive <br/>
elements, Adams shows individuals, teams, and organizations how to overcome these <br/>
blocks, embrace alternative ways of thinking about complex problems, and <br/>
celebrate the joy of creativity. With new examples and contemporary references, <br/>
Conceptual Blockbusting is guaranteed to introduce a new generation of readers to <br/>
a world of new possibilities. --This text refers to the Paperback edition. <br/>
<br/>
Synopsis<br/>
Identifies the perceptual, environmental, emotional, and intellectual blocks <br/>
that obstruct people from correctly perceiving problems and conceiving their <br/>
solutions and provides games and exercises that limber up mental muscles.</div>

This list is a plethera of information and I just knew you all wouldn&#39;t think <br/>

<br/>
You asked in SOME post, SOME where, whether your logic fit in with <br/>
Holt. I clicked around some, trying to figure out where you were <br/>
coming from in the math/calculator thread. Couldn&#39;t find what you had <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
LOLAnyway, I think getting into the problem IS the way to think well, <br/>
whether math probs or otherwise. Not fishing around for the right <br/>
answer, but seeing oneself IN it, and figuring it out from there. If <br/>
you posted about that, then yeah, you were following Holt logic!<br/>
<br/>
L I find Yahoo lists difficult to follow a thread. In fact! I <br/>
went &quot;up thread&quot; on a topic today, and ended up reading something <br/>
posted in the year 2000.!!!<br/>
