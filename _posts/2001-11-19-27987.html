<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017629276">&lt;&lt;that television viewing is always benign&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course it isn&#39;t always benign.  But I don&#39;t think that is the issue.  I<br/>
think the issue is who decides when it has become malignant?  How is that<br/>
decision arrived at?<br/>
<br/>
I have a very sensitive 10yo dd.  &quot;Matlock&quot; scares her.  When something is<br/>
coming on that I think might cause her problems, I say &quot;This program is<br/>
about such and such.  It might be too scary for you.&quot;  Then she decides if<br/>
she wants to watch it or not.<br/>
<br/>
She went through several months of sitting on her behind watching television<br/>
reruns all day.  She was crabby and tired all the time.  I pointed out that<br/>
I thought she would feel better if she got her blood flowing, got outside.<br/>
SHE decided that she would give it a try and SHE decided that she agreed<br/>
with me.<br/>
<br/>
Was television viewing benign in those situations?  No.  But Adriane was<br/>
able to found that out for herself and I feel that I have to trust her to<br/>
find those things out.<br/>
<br/>
Other times, I have been dead wrong with my suggestions.  We have fire ants<br/>
here and little kids just love to stir the mounds and watch the ants<br/>
scatter.  Marsie, then 3yo, loved messing with the ants.  I told her to be<br/>
careful how she played because when the ants bite it really hurts and might<br/>
make her cry.  She blew me off and has spent the 2 years since then happily<br/>
picking up fire ants and letting them crawl all over her without ever<br/>
getting bit.  We call it &quot;the force&quot; (It is either that or the ants can tell<br/>
she&#39;s gonna taste bad).  She has learned a tremendous amount about insects<br/>
and trusting her own decisions.  She would not have learned either if I was<br/>
a &quot;good&quot; mom and kept her out of the ant piles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641768972">&lt;&lt;Yeah, but do you really think that moms who report<br/>
signs of crabbiness <br/>
and<br/>
unhappiness from kids who are getting a lot of screen<br/>
time are being as <br/>
silly as<br/>
moms who don&#39;t want their kids to wear red?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there really is a bad vibe that some people can<br/>
feel coming from <br/>
cathode<br/>
ray tubes.  **Are you 100% prepared to dismiss as<br/>
goofy the <br/>
observations of<br/>
parents who find TV viewing time influences their<br/>
child&#39;s behavior?<br/>
<br/>
I realize there is a big brainwashing in our culture<br/>
about TV being <br/>
evil, but the<br/>
fact that some propaganda exists does not in itself<br/>
prove that no <br/>
criticism of<br/>
television is true and that television viewing is<br/>
always benign.<br/>
<br/>
** or maybe I&#39;ve seen too many episodes of the<br/>
X-files?<br/>

Nowhere in Besty&#39;s post do I read (or read into it)<br/>
that she&#39;s afraid of TV!  I&#39;m really baffled (after<br/>
reading quite a bit of your posts) as to how you reach<br/>
your conclusions. I&#39;m not trying to start another<br/>
childish rant here. I am genuinely curious about your<br/>
thought process. Because I cannot seem to follow your<br/>
interpretations, they are so different from how I see<br/>
(and read!) things.<br/>

<br/>
I assume that Sandra was responding in kind to my humorous postscript.<br/>
<br/>
Humor can be really flat in a post, unless you expect it.<br/>
