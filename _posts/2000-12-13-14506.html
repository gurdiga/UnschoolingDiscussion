was recommended to me. Let some olive oil soak into the scalp, then gently<br/>
scrub it, then shampoo with a mild baby shampoo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745270816">somoene recently suggested to me that cradle crap is a form of yeast<br/>
overgrowth.  she forwarded a web site to me that discusses this, but i<br/>
deleted it, sorry.  also, i found that patchouli scented almond massage<br/>
oil rubbed into the scalp and then gently massaging with a rake shpaed<br/>
lice comb did the trick.  We were fortunate in that we only had to do this<br/>
once and it was a minor case.<br/>

**********<br/>
Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056809100">My son was born with an umbilical hernia, and had thick cradle cap all over<br/>
his head, down his forhead and through his eyebrows. After he had  had<br/>
repeated ear infections which failed to respond to medical treatment, I took<br/>
him to a classical homeopath. He was a bit over 2 yo (the kid, not the<br/>
homeopath &lt;g&gt;) A week later the ear infection had cleared never to return to<br/>
date - he is now 17yo. By the end of that same week his umbilical hernia had<br/>
also healed, and his cradle cap was completely cleared as well. I&#39;ve been<br/>
using homeopathy ever since.<br/>
