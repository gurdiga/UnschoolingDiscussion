<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133203504">This group has a lot of wisdom, but the squabbling is really a drag. 10 <br/>
digests ago you guys were fussing about the same thing. I will unsubscribe and go <br/>

&gt; To me this entire post was attacking. Laura D<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I suppose it was.  I&#39;m on digest and didn&#39;t see that when I sent my <br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was because of all the attacking in general and she went on the <br/>
defensive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he difference is Oom didn&#39;t want to examine the<br/>
&gt; belief that led her to feel that swatting for safety reasosn was a good<br/>
&gt; philosophy. She wanted to cling to her belief that she was right. She <br/>
&gt; wanted<br/>
&gt; to have the right publicly say *here* that it was good advice<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; She has a right to cling to her belief. She does&#39;t have a right to <br/>
&gt; bring it<br/>
&gt; here and present it as good advice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this being stated in this way makes me see see why there was so <br/>
much vitriol before. I just seemed to see the person being attacked , <br/>
not the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just be glad you weren&#39;t subjected to why<br/>
&gt; women should stay in bad marriages for their children&#39;s sake, when it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; ok<br/>
&gt; for a husband to hit his wife, and punishing one&#39;s spouse.  ~Rue<br/>
