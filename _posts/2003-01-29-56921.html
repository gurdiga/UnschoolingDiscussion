<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041644064">On the topic of music.. We just found out today ( after several dead ends) <br/>
that Anna can join the local homeschool group band.!!  She plays clarinet and <br/>
she loved band at school.   She&#39;s really been missing making progress on her <br/>
clarinet.   The greatest thing is, I was worried about the fees, afraid it <br/>
was gonnna squeeze us,  the man who directs  the band does it voluntarily on <br/>
his day off !!..  We only have to pay $5 a month for sheet music!!..  ANNA IS <br/>
SO HAPPY!!..  Ethan may even decide to learn to play drums.  This is just <br/>
great.   We are slowly becoming involved in the homeschool community.  Anna <br/>
and I have also decided to go on the Spring trip with the local homeschool <br/>
group to Washington DC.  She is really looking forward to meeting some new <br/>
friends.    We are soo psyched about the trip, it should be great fun.    All <br/>
this good news is only overshadowed by Landons continuing bad attitude about <br/>
us homeschooling.  He said some very harsh and mean things to us at Dinner <br/>
tonight.  I told him.. &quot;Please.. do not say anything else negative.&quot;   I cant <br/>
just tune him out.. hes pretty insistent ( I WONDER where he gets that??)   <br/>
Its ripping our family apart.  I dont know what to do..<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is Landon your older son that decided to stay in public school?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  And I &#39;ve tried to talk to him.. Tell him this decision is does NOT <br/>
mean that he was brought up &quot;wrong&quot;  or that him staying in public school is <br/>
wrong.  He&#39;s said, he feels like the other kids are just &quot;getting off easy&quot;  <br/>
And hes also made lots of remarks to the effect that they wont learn, they&#39;ll <br/>
fail in life, hes just waiting for it to all blow up in my face.  He DOES <br/>
have the option to quit school.. he says he CAN&#39;T.. and he doesnt want to, <br/>
hes got too many friends and has too much fun at school.   He&#39;s brilliant, <br/>
but he barely passes in school, and I dont hassle him about it.  Then he  <br/>
complains that I dont care about his education.. I think he just &quot;fails&quot; to <br/>
try to rile me up.   I&#39;ve said before, ( and thanks Pam, for at least asking <br/>
about the situation)  my family is not supportive either.  Its really tough. <br/>
really more than I can convey here.  I would go so far as to say Ive <br/>
considered taking Anna, Ethan and JP and just moving far away.  But, to me, <br/>
that would be abandoning Landon ( and my husband) and letting &quot;them&quot; win by <br/>
running away.  ..   Sorry for dumping all of this stuff.. ..I just have no <br/>
where else to let them go<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It must be hard with family that don&#39;t support a decision but to have that <br/>
family in the house with you must be more difficult.  Sorry I have no <br/>
suggestions.  Never have been in that situation or even close to it.  Hope <br/>
someone else can offer some suggestions though.  There are very creative <br/>
people here.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How are you saying it? Are you pleading? Or are you saying &quot;No, don&#39;t,&quot;<br/>
firmly and with confidence?<br/>
<br/>
You could keep repeating calmly and firmly &quot;No, don&#39;t. Talk to me privately<br/>
if you have concerns,&quot; as soon as he starts to say something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I cant <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You shouldn&#39;t tune him out. The rest of the family is listening in. He needs<br/>
a better outlet for his fears and concerns. He&#39;s trying to control things<br/>
that aren&#39;t his to control.<br/>
<br/>
Have him come here and tell us what his fears are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I &#39;ve tried to talk to him..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you trying ot reason with him and convince him you&#39;re right and he&#39;s<br/>
wrong or are you firmly setting your own boundaries that must not be<br/>
crossed? Think of this as hitting you. You need to be firm that this is your<br/>
personal boundary and he must not cross it.<br/>
<br/>
And, like the hitting, there&#39;s reasons behind it. Talk to him about his<br/>
concerns. Give him some articles to read.<br/>
<br/>
But also understand that you&#39;re making a lie of everything you and he<br/>
beleived about what people must do to succeed in life. Everything you made<br/>
him do, everything he&#39;s convinced himself he must do because it&#39;s what<br/>
people have to do, is wrong. He has a right to resent that. He has a right<br/>
to resent that he&#39;d feel off kilter if he didn&#39;t do what he&#39;s been told he<br/>
must do. He *has* to believe you&#39;re wrong or he&#39;s doing it all for nothing.<br/>
