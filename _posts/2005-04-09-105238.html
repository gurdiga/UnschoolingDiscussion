<div id="ygrps-yiv-437744231">I&#39;m sure this has been beaten to death. We just moved from an <br/>
apartment complex where there were lots of kids my kids ages, so they <br/>
had lots of friends. My kids are 7,5, and 3. Now we live in a house in <br/>
a neighborhood where there really aren&#39;t any kids, at least not little <br/>
kids like mine. I recently lost my vehicle so we haven&#39;t been able to <br/>
do lots of outside activites. There is a park around the corner from <br/>
us so we do walk to the park often,  but its usually just the 4 of us. <br/>
My kids don&#39;t seem unhappy and play with each other, building tents <br/>
and &quot;houses&quot; outside, making up games. I can&#39;t help feeling like I&#39;m <br/>
not doing all I can to socialize them, especially when I hear of all <br/>
these other parents who&#39;s children are taking various classes and <br/>
such. I am in the process of arranging it so we can go to the <br/>
library&#39;s and museums. I feel so weird being worried that they don&#39;t <br/>
have outside friends when all DH and I would do most of the time at <br/>
our previous home would be complain to each other about our kids <br/>
friends and our own kids behavior from their friends influence. I <br/>
don&#39;t know, am I over reacting? or do I really have a reason to worry?</div>

If they&#39;re happy then they are!<br/>

 <br/>
If you break &quot;socialize&quot; down into all its elements and look at them  <br/>
separately, it won&#39;t seem so much like a monolithic thing.  The bad parts  can be <br/>
discarded, and the good parts can come in all kinds of different  ways.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- other parents who&#39;s children are taking various classes and  <br/>
such.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve taken a lot of classes in my life.  Sometimes I was told  &quot;You&#39;re not <br/>
here to socialize.&quot;  Most of the good socialization took  place before and after <br/>
things like girl scouts and 4-H, not during the  meetings.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
School friends are like prison cellmates or co-workers or platoon  buddies.  <br/>
It&#39;s often a temporary relationship, not based on choice  and common <br/>
interests.  Occasionally one will last years, but longterm  friendships seem to do <br/>
better when the people met in a place they had both  chosen to be.  As your kids <br/>
get older they&#39;ll want to be doing and being  outside and with others, so let <br/>
their desires and requests be more important  to you than your vague fears.  <br/>
When they let you know they want out more,  then help them find outside people <br/>
and experiences.<br/>
 <br/>
Are there a few kids from the apartments you could invite over,  maybe?  Can <br/>
you go back to that neighborhood to let the kids play with  the other kids <br/>
sometimes, or arrange trade-off playdates?<br/>
 <br/>
When we moved, we stayed in touch with some of the kid-neighbors for a  <br/>
while.  It eased the transition.<br/>
 <br/>

-=-<br/>
 <br/>
The fears are natural, but try to look at your kids needs of the moment  <br/>
instead of looking at it through the lens of &quot;truisms&quot; like &quot;they need to  <br/>
socialize.&quot;  If this moment is good, it&#39;s easier for the next moment to  be good.  If <br/>
you have three or four really good moments in a day, people  can go to bed <br/>
happier, sleep better, and wake up happy.  In as many small  ways as you can, <br/>
create a peaceful and interesting nest for your children and  they&#39;ll leave it <br/>
as happy, interesting people someday.<br/>

snipped &lt;&lt;My kids don&#39;t seem unhappy and play with each other, building<br/>
tents<br/>
 and &quot;houses&quot; outside, making up games. I can&#39;t help feeling like I&#39;m<br/>
not doing all I can to socialize them, especially when I hear of all<br/>
 these other parents who&#39;s children are taking various classes and<br/>
 such.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your kids seem fine with what they have right now then you have no need<br/>
to worry. I know with my 3 youngest, there was quite awhile when they were<br/>
perfectly happy to play with each other when we went out to parks. They were<br/>
even happy staying home at a younger age too. Your kids are still young and<br/>
a lot of times they don&#39;t have the desire for friends until they get older.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until my 2 middle kids were around 7 and 8 that they wanted<br/>
friends. And even at that, they were perfectly happy with just one friend<br/>
coming over to the house. Now at 9 and 10, they enjoy our weekly get<br/>
togethers with a group. But they still aren&#39;t the kind of kids that want to<br/>
go out every day.<br/>
<br/>
Now my youngest at 4 loves going out, even to the grocery store. So for her,<br/>
she takes quick trips out with me, her dad, my oldest daughter (19) and also<br/>
with her grandma. So it all depends on the child too and what they want and<br/>
need for them to be happy. Go with their needs and don&#39;t worry about what<br/>
others are doing. Your kids aren&#39;t their kids.<br/>
