<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740809142">Dear Fellow Homeschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
Long-time readers of Home Education Magazine know we&#39;ve addressed the <br/>
issue of charter, cyber, e-schools and related programs for several <br/>
years now, highlighting the pros and cons of these programs, <br/>
explaining the dangers we see and offering potential solutions. As <br/>
these programs have grown and proliferated in state after state we&#39;ve <br/>
come to feel they are perhaps the single most important issue <br/>
affecting the future of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If the lines between homeschooling and public school become too <br/>
blurred, or are even erased, how then will future generations view <br/>
this moment in time? Our fervent hope is that we won&#39;t be remembered <br/>
as those who clumsily dropped the ball and let the promising <br/>
potential of homeschooling in freedom and independence be lost.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding the dynamics involved is critical to ensuring that <br/>
homeschoolers are not eventually drawn back into the public and <br/>
private school systems. Among those working the hardest to bring <br/>
clarification and understanding to this issue is a group known as &quot;We <br/>
Stand for Homeschooling,&quot; whose website can be found at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.westandforhomeschooling.org">http://www.westandforhomeschooling.org</a><br/>
<br/>
The publishers of Home Education Magazine have chosen to sign the &quot;We <br/>
Stand for Homeschooling&quot; Statement and Resolution, and are <br/>
distributing the announcement below. We encourage you to stand with <br/>
us as an individual homeschooler, and to share the &quot;We Stand for <br/>
Homeschooling&quot; Statement and Resolution with your support group or <br/>
organization through your newsletter, web site, group discussion <br/>
list, park days, meetings and other avenues of information. We hope <br/>
your group will join the many groups and organizations already <br/>
supporting this effort to stand together for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>
<br/>
Your support needed to make strong stand for homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
June 5, 2003 - Please join many homeschoolers and their allies who <br/>
are publicly taking a stand for homeschooling. Why is this necessary? <br/>
Because homeschooling freedoms are being threatened by the increase <br/>
in both corporately-owned cyber charter schools and the creation of <br/>
school district-sponsored programs directed at homeschoolers. Both <br/>
are designed to bring homeschoolers under the control of public <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
Most homeschoolers understand the difference between enrollment in <br/>
taxpayer funded schools and homeschooling, which requires neither <br/>
enrollment nor taxpayer funding. With the We Stand for Homeschooling <br/>
(WSFH) Statement and Resolution, homeschoolers and their allies can <br/>
stand together to clearly identify these important distinctions.<br/>
<br/>
The WSFH Statement and Resolution distinguishes between homeschoolers <br/>
and those who would make a profit from publicly funded, home-based <br/>
education. Citing a variety of media reports, the Statement clearly <br/>
shows why it is important to take this stand for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
No one can or should claim to define homeschooling, and the authors <br/>
of WSFH were careful not to do so. However, it is not difficult to <br/>
identify what homeschooling is not. Because cyber charter schools <br/>
work hard to be so visible and so public, they could easily become <br/>
the standard of identity that the general public and legislators <br/>
expect when they think of homeschooling. &quot;Blending&quot; homeschooling <br/>
with public schools risks the same outcome.<br/>
<br/>
The WSFH Statement and Resolution was authored by an ad hoc <br/>
committee. Joining the committee are many original signers from <br/>
diverse political, philosophical, religious, and activist <br/>
perspectives. All are standing together to preserve homeschooling and <br/>
the opportunity for the many families who want to choose <br/>
homeschooling, free from the government regulation and other <br/>
requirements that come with taxpayer funding. You are encouraged to <br/>
visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.westandforhomeschooling.org">http://www.westandforhomeschooling.org</a> to view the WSFH <br/>
Statement and Resolution and to add your name to those standing for <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
