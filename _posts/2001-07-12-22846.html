<div id="ygrps-yiv-186277329">I needed some feedback... Hubby and I have been researching <br/>
unschooling for about 3 years and it seems the way to go.  In the <br/>
meantime I put my 5 1/2 yr old in a summer program and this is my <br/>
experience so far (6 weeks into it)... I&#39;d love some feedback that <br/>
I&#39;m not crazy... and going in the &quot;right&quot; direction.<br/>
<br/>
The kinds of socialization that Zak has learned that other kids do <br/>
and thereby copies most of it have been:<br/>
<br/>
teasing over cherished toys brought to school (such as his baby)<br/>
being called pinhead or butthead<br/>
being hit or kick by aggressive children<br/>
spitting<br/>
shouting and screaming when he doesn&#39;t get his own way at home.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say he&#39;s coming out of there today!!!!!  It&#39;s also been <br/>
costing us $500 a month to send him to this great place of <br/>
socialization.  I know that Zak loves to be with other kids, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think these are the kids he needs to be with.  He doesn&#39;t like <br/>
the teasing and we have talked and talked to the teachers.  Basically <br/>
their attitude is &quot;all kids have to go through this&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s part of <br/>
life&quot;.... My life does not include anyone who displays the above <br/>
behavior... None of my friends spit at me or tease me, so how is this <br/>
a part of life?<br/>
<br/>
I guess we realized that we are very concerned about our son&#39;s <br/>
socialization and healthy socialization is what we are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday afternoon his grandma and grandpa picked him up from school <br/>
(early) and took him to their house.  Grandpa had been setting traps <br/>
(not ones that kill) for the squirrels that have been eating their <br/>
flowers in the garden and Zak had a wonderful time with grandpa <br/>
putting the squirrels in a box and going in the truck to a wash where <br/>
they let them go.  Then they played chess and dominos and finally <br/>
daddy came to pick him up after work.... Doesn&#39;t that sound more like <br/>
healthy socialization?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037287551">It&#39;s only &quot;part of life&quot; because people have been so brainwashed to believe<br/>
that it has to be.  We unschool, and teasing is not part of our lives.  You<br/>
can choose what kind of socialization is important to you.  I&#39;d much rather<br/>
an afternoon with Grampa than a day with a bunch of unhappy kids who take<br/>
out their frustration on the kids around them.  Top that off with some<br/>
adults who think kids should have to go through it, and you couldn&#39;t pay ME<br/>
$500 a month to go :).  I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about socialization.<br/>
You really can&#39;t do anything in life without socializing to some extent.<br/>
Your son will just be able to do so with a wider variety of people than the<br/>
average school kid, and will most likely not feel any need to torment others<br/>
since his sense of self and freedom will be encouraged instead of trampled.<br/>
I guess I could have just said, No, you&#39;re not crazy, huh? ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615235780">This is not what I call socialization...this is negative peer pressure.  I am<br/>
very concerned about the influences n my children&#39;s life, and it is very<br/>
difficult to find children (even homeschooled) that I think are worth their<br/>
time.  We don&#39;t do alot of play dates ect because of this reason.  My<br/>
children love to play with one another, and they love being around me, their<br/>
father, and their Grandmother (who lives up the driveway)<br/>
They are happy children, healthy...and very busy.  They also don&#39;t have any<br/>
of those negative type behaviors.  We have just had company twice, and they<br/>
both had children.  There was a MAJOR difference in their behavior and my<br/>
children&#39;s behavior.<br/>
Let me give you one example from many....<br/>
All the kids were swimming...my son (age 8) said to our visitor girl (also 8)<br/>
that there was a wolf spider on her head.  (no adult heard this to this<br/>
point)  She came yelling to her Mother that my son had said there was a<br/>
spider on her...  Her Mother laughed and said, &quot;Well, I think he just has<br/>
your number (meaning her was teasing her)  Well, I was quite surprised..and<br/>
so was my son...he was truthfully telling her there was a spider on her, and<br/>
was going to get it off of her.  I was so surprised to realize that this type<br/>
of teasing is so commonplace, that the Mother immediately thinks like this<br/>
too.  It really struck me....my kids do not tease each other like this..it is<br/>
just not done in our house.<br/>
<br/>
My children also relate well to adults.  This is something that schooled<br/>
children are not very strong on...  But, I know some homeschooled children<br/>
who are also like this.<br/>
<br/>
Socialization is not just playing with others of ones age.  Socialization is<br/>
being around all people...of all types, all ages, all everything.  My kids<br/>
spend much more time around adults, and are none the worse for wear.<br/>
:)<br/>
Guess I&#39;ve rattled on long enough...I hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219229287">Thanks Ann and Rue:<br/>
<br/>
I calmed down quite a bit since I wrote the e-mail and it&#39;s wonderful to hear <br/>
from people that support my feeling that I&#39;m doing the right thing in pulling <br/>
him out.  As I was worried that I wouldn&#39;t be able to work in the day <br/>
time.... My nearly 2 year old took his nap and Zak sat in my office putting <br/>
charts in envelopes for me and putting stamps on the postcards I&#39;m just about <br/>
to send out to my clients.  He said &quot;mummy, I love working in your office <br/>
with you, this is fun&quot;  which I thought was wonderful... I know we are making <br/>
the right decision.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715908660">I have 5 kids, 4 which are school age.  My girls complain here and <br/>
there about not being around a bunch of kids like they use to when <br/>
they where in school.  But I think they romanticize about it.  I <br/>
remember them always complaining about someone&#39;s behavior when they <br/>
got home and I was soooo sick of it. I have always taught our kids to <br/>
be respectful to others.  I know they are not perfect, but from what <br/>
I see from some other kids (not all schooled kids) they are pretty <br/>
darn nice.  <br/>

Hi Dawn!  Nice to see you again :-)  Thanks for a great <br/>
reinforcement of why I don&#39;t want mine to go to <br/>
school!!!  You&#39;re not crazy, and the grandparents stuff <br/>
sounds lovely, definitely more useful &#39;socialisation!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes wonder if it would be worth my girls going <br/>
to school or something similar like this for a while so <br/>
that they know what it&#39;s like,a nd that we all know <br/>
what we&#39;re missing :-)  But only sometimes...<br/>
