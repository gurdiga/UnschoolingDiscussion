&gt;   Just wanted to touch base with you - let you know that for you and for <br/>
&gt; those who love Skye - you and they are in my thoughts. What a tragedy.  I <br/>
&gt; can not begin to express what was in my heart after reading your post.  But <br/>
&gt; wanted to let you know that I care.  My care is with you, the kids, his <br/>

I was just speechless and didn&#39;t know what to say (thanks for saying what I <br/>
was thinking, but couldn&#39;t get it out Deborah)......It&#39;s just so much <br/>
happening to children in the world..........<br/>
