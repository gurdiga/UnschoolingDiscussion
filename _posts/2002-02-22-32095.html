<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712794173">This is a scary thing that is going on over here at my house...My son is <br/>
almost 11 years old...<br/>
<br/>
One day in January, he did not want to go with me to get some goat&#39;s milk <br/>
and run one other errand...usually would take me no more than an <br/>
hour...well it took a bit longer due to snow.  Some person decided to call <br/>
the police for my son being left home alone.<br/>
<br/>
So now Social Services is involved and are really questioning me on the <br/>
fact that I am homeschooling/unschooling my son...so much in fact, that <br/>
they are trying to get the school district that my son used to be in, to <br/>
take him back without charging me tuition (we are out of district and the <br/>
school where we are is horrible!).  They are saying that my son is not <br/>
socialized enough and that he is suffering by not being in school.<br/>
<br/>
My son has blossomed this year with being home.  We do not fight anymore, <br/>
he is no longer depressed (he was suicidal in first grade because of a <br/>
teacher)and he smiles so much more.<br/>
<br/>
The school in the better district promised my son so many services/help and <br/>
not one thing was ever done beyond the promises.  He does not want to go <br/>
back at all and I do not want him to.  He has learned so much more being <br/>
home and has not had any of his old problems since he is  home.<br/>
<br/>
I really thought it was ok for a 10 year old to be  home alone as my <br/>
neighbor does it all the time and I know of people who have left an 8 year <br/>
old home alone (that is too young in my book) and my son is very responsible.<br/>
<br/>
He does get out and do things with his friends on the weekends, he takes <br/>
classes at a museum near here with other kids, he swims, he gets out all <br/>
the time so he does get socialized during the week...<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be great...Being scared right now is an <br/>
understatement!!!!  I will answer any of your questions that you may have <br/>
to help me with this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888195837">I&#39;d also let them know LOUDLY & CLEARLY that you don&#39;t intend to be quiet about this. Many times these issues turn into you being harassed. <br/>
My son attended public school to &quot;try&quot; it, and hated it. When I informed them I was returning to homeschooling, they gave me a list of who I&#39;d have to contact, submit curriculum info. etc... I found out under the law I didn&#39;t have to do any of this! I didn&#39;t even have to notify the school in writing if I didn&#39;t want to. When I &quot;assertively&quot; informed them that I knew my rights, gave info. on the such, etc... they quickly shut up & left me alone. <br/>
I am so SO tired of supposedly living in a &quot;free&quot; country & having the government insist on raising my child in certain istances such as this & butting in. Whether it&#39;s education, vaccination, or our lifestyle, I am constantly hearing of people being treated like evil aliems because we don&#39;t do things like the cattle car ditto heads making up the majority. <br/>
Makes me so mad I could just...well...anyway, you get the idea. LOL~<br/>

scary!<br/>
This might be a good place to start looking up info on your states <br/>
laws...<br/>

<br/>
You might also want to find out if there is any law about what age <br/>
children can be left home alone.  I know some states have them.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any other hsers in your area you can contact?  Most <br/>
usually know the laws and can help you find out more about them.  <br/>
<br/>
As hard as it may be when faced with these people, try to remain calm <br/>
and confident.  I hope everything works out all right for you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946870826">Hi Jessi,<br/>
<br/>
Though I have never been in your predicament I can certainly sense your feelings of being afraid and scared right now. It seems that this scenario is a homeschooler&#39;s and especially an unschooler&#39;s worst nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
It might help if you mentioned what state you are in, and then possibly someone on this list would know the law in your state or be able to help look it up for you, so you can at least know your rights. It doesn&#39;t seem to me that you did anything all-so-bad and that someone has been just itching to find a reason to call the authorities on you.<br/>
<br/>
It would be such a shame if you were forced to send your son to school after he has been improving so much since he has been home. That doesn&#39;t sound legal to me at all. Someone is trying to and doing a good job of scaring you. Try not to feel intimidated, although I would probably be feeling the same way if I were if your shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you and keep us informed about what happens.<br/>
<br/>

In Maryland the law states that children under the age of 8 can not be left<br/>
alone. Check your state and see if there is a law similar and what is the<br/>
age.<br/>
Also, on the HSing front, stand firm and show them whatever the state<br/>
requires for homeschoolers. As long as you are complient with the law, they<br/>
can&#39;t use that against you. Start keeping a paper trail  of all their phone<br/>
callls and correspondance (and your replies) as well as telephone call<br/>
notes - get names of anyone who calls you as well as their title. CPS does<br/>
not determine if you are complient or not with the HS regs. the DOE does.<br/>
Contacting your state inclusive HS group, preferably the most politically<br/>
active one is important also. They can help you decifer (sp?) the law.<br/>
Good luck and keep us posted!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-957142776">Jessi, It sounds like you may want to call a lawyer and just ask what the<br/>
law says about leaving a child home alone in your area.  Also, my heart<br/>
goes out to you and I believe in the power of prayer and will be praying<br/>
for you.  It sounds like someone in the neighborhood is being vindictive<br/>
towards you or something.  Someone once called children&#39;s services on me<br/>
when I was doing nothing just because they were being spiteful because I<br/>
refused to do something they were manipulating to get.  And the first<br/>
thing the children&#39;s services person asked me was, &quot;Why do you homeschool<br/>
your children?  Are they seeing enough other children.  Are they learning<br/>
enough?&quot;  And I had to really look them in the eye without fear and give<br/>
them my schpeel that is almost canned by now for all the imbeciles out<br/>
there who can&#39;t just say, &quot;Oh you homeschool?  Cool.&quot;  In my state the<br/>
legal age to leave a child alone is 10, and for younger children there is<br/>
a time limit on how many minutes you can leave them alone in the house. <br/>
Which is just weird to me because I see little kids all the time on the<br/>
street and at parks who are totally unsupervised in a location that is<br/>
even more unsafe than the home.  And I grew up often out in the country<br/>
where I explored all the time in nature unsupervised and look at me, I&#39;m<br/>
still alive.  And I think whoever called them deserves to be sued for<br/>
slandering your name.  But most importantly, don&#39;t give in to the fear. <br/>
Stand strong and don&#39;t give up on homeschooling your child if that is<br/>
what you believe is best for him.  It sounds like his &quot;school&quot; experience<br/>
was just a nightmare.  Oh, and document everything social services says<br/>
to you and does, including your argument for why he should be<br/>
homeschooled and why you left him at home so that if it does go too far,<br/>
and you go to a judge, you will have evidence to present.<br/>
Jessi, I like your name.  My dad&#39;s name was Jess.  It&#39;ll make it easy to<br/>
remember to pray for you.<br/>
