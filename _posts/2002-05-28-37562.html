<div id="ygrps-yiv-653485361">**At libraries they put the new books out on open shelves, so you can<br/>

<br/>
At some bookstores and libraries they put out &quot;Staff Favorites&quot; as well<br/>
as new books.  I think that&#39;s a bit of what I&#39;m doing when I &quot;strew&quot;.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve been chewing on the ethics of strewing a bit.  I&#39;ve concluded that<br/>

it&#39;s part of required &quot;cultural literacy&quot; is not so cool. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people hate those Hirsch books, or have said they did, and it seems <br/>
to boil down to the title of &quot;needs&quot; to know.  Joyce pointed out that he did <br/>
recommend using better materials than his own in some (or all) cases.  <br/>
<br/>
What he means by &quot;needs to know&quot; is bigger than that set of books.   As he <br/>
was the main proponent of &quot;Cultural Literacy&quot; as a basis for schools&#39; <br/>
curriculae, and he WAS starting to be listened to, he wrote that series as a <br/>
way to create a path to the theoretical goal.<br/>
<br/>
What his overall system involves is everyone in the culture having common <br/>
terminology and a common historical knowledge base so that when something&#39;s <br/>
being discussed among educated adults, few to none of them are standing there <br/>
baffled as to what the others are talking about.  And a big part of the <br/>
commonality he&#39;s promoting is linguistic and literary.  That&#39;s why the books <br/>
have the common phrases, idioms, homilies--&quot;don&#39;t let the cat out of the bag&quot; <br/>
and things like that.  And that&#39;s why the folktales and mythology.  If <br/>
someone says &quot;the patience of Job&quot; it might be useful for others to know who <br/>
the heck Job was and what the overall context of that statement is because <br/>
it&#39;s not just &quot;patience,&quot; it&#39;s much larger.  &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&quot; is <br/>
(I think) the only simple reference in our culture to the idea that people <br/>
are so easily led as to say they see something they don&#39;t, if they fear for <br/>
their own self-image in the presence of those they perceive to be wiser or <br/>
better.  That&#39;s a lot of words to say &quot;the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes.&quot;  So people <br/>
who know those stories can communicate better with one another.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, which is an odd little <br/>
town filled with intellectuals of geeky breeding, in HUGE part, and when <br/>
physicists marry physicists and live among physicists, some weird things do <br/>
happen.  (The&#39;re starting to intermarry nowadays &lt;bwg&gt;.)   He only knew what <br/>
he knew, and what he knew he had pretty much learned on his own.  What his <br/>
parents had valued was satire from before 1950 (what THEIR parents had <br/>
valued, and nothing new), math and science.  Engineering.  He learned to fix <br/>
cars a bit, from his dad, and to tie lots of knots, from boy scouting.  <br/>
<br/>
We were English majors.  I was out before he got to UNM, and knew him while <br/>
he was in college.  He was having a TERRIBLE horrible time in Shakespeare and <br/>
Milton and some other literature  classes because he knew not ONE Bible story <br/>
but the nativity and knew vaguely about what Easter was about.  He knew no <br/>
Garden of Eden, Noah, Tower of Babel--none of those things which others are <br/>
expected to know.  So he didn&#39;t want to go to church to learn them (they <br/>
don&#39;t teach those to adults so much as kids anyway), and so I was telling him <br/>
the stories and finding the passages to give him to read.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that they didn&#39;t go to church at all ever.  His mother was an <br/>
umpty-generation Unitarian from New Hampshire or somewhere.  He just didn&#39;t <br/>
have any Bible basis.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s the sort of situation Hirsch&#39;s stuff is designed to address.  If <br/>
you want to read Shakespeare it helps to know English history and the Bible <br/>
(at least the highlights) first.  It helps to know the cultural situations at <br/>
the time the things were written. <br/>
<br/>
My friend Derek was fascinated most by the story of Jacob and Esau, and Jacob <br/>
fooling their father into blessing him instead of his hairy brother.  It&#39;s <br/>
Genesis 27, and sets a weird light on the whole business of Jacob and the <br/>
tribes of Israel.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; the Hirsh books in order, but I do look in there once in a <br/>
while and do a mental checklist, and I wouldn&#39;t feel bad if given a straight <br/>
choice between something the kids already know, and something that they <br/>
don&#39;t, directing their attention toward the new piece of information.  But I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t press it if they passed it by.  Any information worth having is out <br/>
there in the world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really agree with this statement. I think that the phrase &quot;needs to know&quot; <br/>
is what raises my hackles. (Whatever hackles are.) I do thumb through the <br/>
books occassionally to comfort myself that my kids are doing just fine and my <br/>
son likes to look through the books and ask for more information about what <br/>
he reads. I have found that the books make a great jumping-off point and lead <br/>
to interesting conversations.<br/>
