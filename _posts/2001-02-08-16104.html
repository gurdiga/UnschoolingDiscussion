<div id="ygrps-yiv-104639963">Well, I&#39;d rather my kids lied till they were blue in the face than that they<br/>
play with guns and accidently kill a playmate or themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I think laying down absolutes doesn&#39;t accomplish anything.  Each incident<br/>
should be judged on its own merits.  There are gray areas in all things.<br/>
<br/>
Until children reach an age where they either feel comfortable putting their<br/>
own two feet down or aren&#39;t too shy to take things into their own two hands,<br/>
I think the use of parents is a very acceptable safety measure!<br/>
<br/>
Do you teach your children that they should respond in all situations with<br/>
absolute truth?  My kids were in a situation not too long ago which is a<br/>
perfect illustration of the truth not being a good thing.  We were at the<br/>
grocery store and one of the little girls from youngest kidlet&#39;s softball<br/>
team was there with her mother and their new addition.  Now, if you want<br/>
honesty, this baby was sooo ugly it could give a person nightmares!  The<br/>
usual conversation was going on about &quot;oh what a cute/sweet/pretty/doesn&#39;t<br/>
she look just like/you are so lucky&quot; blah, blah blah.  Well, one of the<br/>
lol&#39;s turns to youngest kidlet and says, &quot;Don&#39;t you think Marissa is pretty?<br/>
Don&#39;t you think Sara is lucky to have such a pretty little sister? Don&#39;t you<br/>
wish you could have a pretty little sister just like Marissa?&quot;  Honesty<br/>
would have required a &quot;No, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s pretty, No, I don&#39;t think<br/>
Sara is lucky (by now the baby was screaming at the top of her lungs) and<br/>
No, I don&#39;t want a little sister like Marissa.&quot;  Would you require that<br/>
&quot;no?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; I also waited for a time of maturity when my dd<br/>
&gt; would be able to separate the honest person she is from a moment of crisis<br/>
&gt; that may call for lying.  Yes, I do believe there are rare events which a<br/>
&gt; higher calling takes precedence. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was discussing all this with a close friend last night.  On another list<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re on, the past few days have also involved guns and honesty,<br/>
&gt; coincidently, and that was about what factors might affect or totally<br/>
&gt; preclude an SCA teacher/student relationship.  Monday I had written that<br/>
&gt; although I don&#39;t like or have guns, gun ownership wouldn&#39;t be a big factor<br/>
&gt; for me with students, but honesty was my big #1.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So in telling him that this list had come to the juncture of guns and<br/>
honesty<br/>
&gt; too, on the the next day, he made this point:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a child is taught that there are times when lying is acceptable, the<br/>
&gt; parents should not be surprised when the children then lie to the parents.<br/>
&gt; Moments of crisis and rare events will happen between teens and parents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I didn&#39;t mean toy guns.  I meant that I would rather give my children<br/>
&gt; real guns to play with than to teach them to lie.<br/>

Holly&#39;s saying she might say &quot;I wish I had a little sister&quot;  or &quot;I wish I was <br/>

There&#39;s a difference between not lying and telling hurtful, tactless &quot;truth.&quot; <br/>

To say &quot;That dress is hideous&quot; isn&#39;t even necessarily truth!  Some people say <br/>

<br/>
But if someone asked Holly, &quot;Did you make that dress?&quot;  I wouldn&#39;t want her <br/>
to tell anything but whatever the truth was.  Either she made it or I made it <br/>
or someone else did, or it was a hand-me-down, or whatever.  Or maybe she <br/>
doesn&#39;t know.  The &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; is the answer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the favorite red herring of people who want to defend dishonesty, to say <br/>
that if someone thinks truth is important that they will walk around telling <br/>
people &quot;Your roots are showing&quot; or &quot;your baby is ugly.&quot;  <br/>

This much I agree with.  It&#39;s actually easy to say something positive and not <br/>
lie.  My dd is actually very good at this, quite sensitive to other&#39;s <br/>
feelings.  She loves babies so I&#39;m sure she might have just said exactly that.<br/>

Boy was *I* sleepy!!  I thought I had started off with &quot;where&#39;d that dress <br/>
come from.&quot;  I guess if the asked if she made it and she said &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; <br/>
she&#39;d be hard to carry conversations on with ANYtime!!<br/>

What I meant was if she didn&#39;t know where a dress came from &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; <br/>

If you want to talk subjective, then you can&#39;t use an absolute as your<br/>

wasn&#39;t in response to mine). My daughter&#39;s friend asked her if she liked her <br/>
haircut which she did not and she simply said, &quot;It&#39;s not my style, but it <br/>
suits your personality.&quot; It was all true. <br/>
<br/>
It was actually to the original example of a gun and other situations where <br/>
harm can come to someone that I was referring. While a lie is never the <br/>
preferred choice, I would not have my children sacrifice their lives or <br/>
well-being on the altar of the truth. <br/>

Again, we chose the words specifically.  Kids are smart and one kid suddenly <br/>
saying &quot;I&#39;m going home now&quot; would be a strong clue that they are leaving <br/>
because of the gun.  I want to remove ANY reason for them to try and stop <br/>
her.  We considered the choice you suggested and decided that it was NOT <br/>
sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
Within a short time the kids would know WHY she left because I would be <br/>
contacting the parents and, if necessary, the police.<br/>

No, I agree that it could be sufficient and true, except there are times when <br/>
other kids won&#39;t let you get out of it so easily, as I stated in my previous <br/>
post. I was referring to extreme situations such as that, as well as the ones <br/>
I listed before. We don&#39;t know what the circumstances of the gun play may be, <br/>
since it&#39;s hypothetical.<br/>
<br/>
What if the kid replied, &quot;No, you&#39;re not,&quot; while pointing the gun at my <br/>
daughter, and standing between her and the door? That&#39;s the kind of turn of <br/>
events I was imagining. The truth has been tried, now I want her to use her <br/>
wits, truth or no truth, to get out of there. At this point, no, I don&#39;t want <br/>
them sacrificing their lives so they can say they were honest.<br/>

I didn&#39;t say it *has* happened, or that any of her friends *would* do it. It <br/>
was obviously meant to be hypothetical. But there are certainly kids who play <br/>
around like that all the time. When I grew up, I knew kids who though it was <br/>

suggested they use wit when necessary. Although we have discussed what would <br/>
be wise to say or do in such situations, the other person doesn&#39;t always know <br/>
their lines. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve reiterated that I don&#39;t expect any of these instances to be <br/>
everyday situations. Sure, we can *usually* walk away from bad situations, <br/>
but it does not *always* work. I&#39;m not discussing the usual, rather the <br/>

<br/>
Yes and yes.  I do not allow her, nor does she want to play in their homes.  <br/>
She doesn&#39;t care to play with them at all.  However, these kids have been <br/>
known to show up at the homes in which she is allowed to play.<br/>
<br/>
Picturing one of the kids trying to stop her or pointing the gun towards her <br/>
is NO stretch of the imagination, nor is it a head &quot;drama&quot; for me.  They have <br/>
become such a problem that they are known to every neighbor and rather than <br/>
deal with their parents (it gets nasty every time) folks now resort to <br/>
calling the police.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m truly happy for anyone who lives in a neighborhood free of this kind of <br/>
problem but it&#39;s a present threat in ours.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you expect other people to act like dramatic movie characters, then I <br/>

<br/>
Perhaps if you were living in our neighborhood the drama would be in YOUR <br/>
head.  Are you assuming that the kids you encounter where you live are the <br/>
same that others do?  Perhaps they are, perhaps MOST of them are but if <br/>
you&#39;ve encountered kids similar to a few who live here I&#39;m not sure you would <br/>
see the scenario as so fanciful.<br/>
<br/>
Is it so far fetched to believe that those of us who make a choice that <br/>
diverges a bit from your own are capable of equally careful, judicious and <br/>
honest in making them?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So far I&#39;ve disarmed (pun intended) more people with the truth than with <br/>
any <br/>
thought-out dialog.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here and I hope as much for my dd, she is already quite adept in this <br/>
area.  When it comes to a crisis moment I have to use my best discernment in <br/>
equipping her with the tools to cope.  I&#39;m the only one who knows her <br/>
challenge areas so well.<br/>
<br/>
As in most decisions made when parenting we have to access risk vs risk and <br/>
only WE can KNOW the risks we face.  Our ethics effect these decisions but <br/>
I&#39;m hoping that slight differences aren&#39;t fodder for diminishing one <br/>
another&#39;s concerns because we don&#39;t share them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve misunderstood what I was saying. Maybe I haven&#39;t said <br/>
it clearly enough. I do *not* encourage lying. My children and I have <br/>
discussed many ways to be honest when it is difficult to do so. My daughter <br/>
has amazed me with her ability to be tactful and wise in these situations. I <br/>
don&#39;t know who originally brought it up either, so I don&#39;t take it personally.<br/>
<br/>
What I was saying is that in situations where the truth has not worked to get <br/>
them out of a dangerous situation, I would prefer that they lie rather than <br/>
fall victim to harm that could have been avoided with the right words.<br/>
<br/>
The example I used was a rapist in my home asking me if there was anyone else <br/>
there. I wouldn&#39;t feel a need to be honest and reveal my daughter&#39;s presence. <br/>
Dramatic? Maybe. I was going for the extreme situations because they are the <br/>
exceptions to my ban on lying. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577401816">Gee, how soon we forget!  Either that or you have no kids.  And, not being<br/>
one to trust to my own memory, heaven forbid the accusations that would<br/>
follow that &lt;g&gt;, I asked a group of kids from three age groups.<br/>
<br/>
While, the kids might not necessarily point a gun at anyone deliberately, it<br/>
is quite possible they would inadvertantly point the gun.  But, 100% agreed<br/>
that regardless of age (8-10, 13 and 16 & 17 yo&#39;s), the concensus was that<br/>
they have never been able to leave a group gathering without the old &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
go now,&quot; &quot;why, now&quot; and various other coercive statements.  That is reality.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked if there would be less of a problem if they used the excuse<br/>
given by whomever&#39;s daughter, the general concensus was that the kids<br/>
wouldn&#39;t try to stop the other kid from leaving but would probably give out<br/>
some teasing such as &quot;you&#39;re gonna be in trouble&quot; or something of that sort<br/>
and the child would be out the door with little or no trouble.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m used to this.<br/>
<br/>
My whole life there have been people who were determined to prove I lied, and <br/>
that a policy of truthfulness wasn&#39;t possible.  Nobody&#39;s proven it yet, and <br/>
I&#39;m 47.  If it makes you feel better about your own practices and theories to <br/>
believe strongly that it&#39;s not possible, then you&#39;re doing something with <br/>
yourself, and not to me.<br/>
<br/>
But at this point in the discussion it does seem pretty personal.  Like this, <br/>
for example:  -=-Gee, how soon we forget!  Either that or you have no kids. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-And what an adult may get away with and what a child will encounter or two<br/>
seperate animals.__<br/>
<br/>
Then perhaps it is my children&#39;s luxury of never having been to school, and <br/>
hanging out with families either they have chosen or we their parents have <br/>
chosen because of philosophical similarities (La Leche League, Society for <br/>
Creative Anachronism, homeschooling), or intelligence or SOMETHING somehow <br/>
selective, and my kids&#39; self confidence or something.<br/>
<br/>
There is one boy they hang around with who has gotten Marty in minor trouble <br/>
a couple of times.  Once the police stopped and talked to them because they <br/>
were out walking around at night and had made too much noise.  But right in <br/>
front of the other kid I told Marty (and so him along with it) that Marty <br/>
needed to agree with or veto all actions, and he couldn&#39;t blame kidx, and <br/>
that kidx needed to NOT push Marty, or he wasn&#39;t coming over anymore.  But <br/>
they came right in reporting that the police had talked to them and told them <br/>
to &quot;run home&quot; (from  half a mile and some) and that the policeman was going <br/>
to come and talk to me and they better be home.<br/>
<br/>
He lied.  And that half mile was too far and too dangerous to run, in the <br/>
dark, next to a major road.  And I tried hard not to say &quot;Well he lied,&quot; but <br/>
I really did not appreciate a law officer lying to my son.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish he HAD come and talked to me and to them.  It would have been more <br/>
effective.  <br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;ve not yet since been in trouble and they hang around much in groups <br/>
of four or six and the other kids would tell me or hint if those two had been <br/>
difficult.  They&#39;re 12 and 13.<br/>
<br/>
I have not only the three children I have now (9, 12, 14), but had custody of <br/>
my accidental half-brother for a few years, in the early/mid 1980&#39;s (a <br/>
habitual liar, fetal alcohol syndrome, raised in very sad situation, which is <br/>
why my mother relinquished parental rights.  And that was after I had married <br/>
a friend in 1975 because his parents both died in very short time and his 10 <br/>
and 12 year old siblings were going to be taken away (a long story).  With <br/>
them, lying was not common, but was done sneakily to &quot;keep peace,&quot; but it <br/>
only kept peace for that moment, until the truth was found out and there were <br/>
ten units of work/talk to make up for that one unit of peace.<br/>
<br/>
Having grown up carefully honest, this confirmed my theories.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have known one another since 1977, and I know of no lies <br/>
which have passed between us.  Is it genetic?  Are we naturally brave and <br/>
confident?  That could be, as there seem some people who are naturally timid <br/>
and easily led.  Maybe what we believe is training and values passed down is <br/>
more genetic.  <br/>
<br/>
To have my awareness, honest and motherhood questioned in public should hurt <br/>
me, and twenty years ago would have, but now I&#39;m used to it.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
change the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
P.S.   I HAVE been asked directly &quot;Isn&#39;t she cute?&quot; about babies and have <br/>
said &quot;Some people think all babies are cute, but I never have.&quot;  (Which is <br/>
true.) and &quot;All babies look like Eisenhower or Churchhill at first.&quot;   <br/>
Probably I get away with such things socially because it&#39;s not ALL I&#39;m going <br/>
to say in the conversation.  I&#39;ve also referred to many babies, my own <br/>
included as &quot;grubs&quot; or &quot;the larva stage&quot; meaning they weren&#39;t yet doing <br/>
anything impressive or coordinated but someday they would.  I&#39;ve never said <br/>
&quot;that is a grub&quot; and walked away.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815427593">i remember being 18, on my own for the first time, in a city far away<br/>
from home.  i met a guy, a neighbor, at a party and when the party was<br/>
over he followed me out and eventually pulled out his gun.  his intent<br/>
and desire were made clear to me.<br/>
<br/>
i took a deep breath and then decided.  i told the guy how cute i<br/>
thought he was (he was ugly), how i&#39;d liked him from the moment we&#39;d met<br/>
(i hadn&#39;t noticed him), how i wanted to get to know him better (not),<br/>
and that he was going about this all wrong.  i spoke of romance and<br/>
flowers and love, about starting things off right with a date.  even i<br/>
thought it sounded preposterous.   i couldn&#39;t believe i had a chance,<br/>
that he would ever possibly believe anybody would like him, but in my<br/>
panic it was the only thing i thought of to do.  my mother taught us to<br/>
be honest but in her own life demonstrated that she wasn&#39;t always<br/>
honest.  maybe that saved me from being raped or worse.  i don&#39;t know.<br/>
i do remember seeing in his face that he wanted to believe me and i<br/>
persisted.  it gave me some time and i was able to escape.  i think i<br/>
was clever and very lucky.  and, oh, yes, dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t even know why people want to think their baby is &quot;cute&quot;.  what<br/>
people always commented on about my daughter as an infant, was that she<br/>
was the happiest baby they&#39;d ever seen.  that&#39;s a compliment that meant<br/>
the world to me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740066069"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My whole life there have been people who were determined to prove I lied, and<br/>
&gt;that a policy of truthfulness wasn&#39;t possible.  Nobody&#39;s proven it yet, and<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m 47.  If it makes you feel better about your own practices and theories to<br/>
&gt;believe strongly that it&#39;s not possible, then you&#39;re doing something with<br/>
&gt;yourself, and not to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was going to stay out of this, but I do not think I can after that comment.<br/>
<br/>
In many cases, I do think the truth may be a SUBJECTIVE thing.  Personally, <br/>
in *MY* opinion, the way that you, Sandra, handled things with Christina <br/>
over her personal email to you was VERY, VERY dishonest.  You might not <br/>
have flat out lied about anything, but you were dishonest in your handling <br/>
of the situation none the less.<br/>
<br/>
If that email had bothered you that badly, you should have brought it to <br/>
the list right away, or at least to the moderators.  But instead, you kept <br/>
it, THOUGHT you saw an opportunity to use it against her, and forwarded a <br/>
PERSONAL email to a list of over 450 people. Not because it bothered you, <br/>
but because YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD CAUGHT HER IN A LIE.   THEN, when you <br/>
*should* have realized you were wrong, you instead made a big deal about <br/>
people sending personal emails off the list, which was NOT what the issue <br/>
was about even!!  You jumped on the chance to embarrass someone and prove <br/>
them wrong, and that is worse than any little white lie a child has ever told.<br/>
<br/>
First off, a personal email should remain that way, PERSONAL.  On just <br/>
about every list I have ever been on in the six years I have been using the <br/>
internet, the policy has always been to take personal emails OFF the list. <br/>
On my own list we often request that people take PERSONAL thing to PERSONAL <br/>
emails, so that the rest of us do not have to be in it.  Most of the time <br/>
people have enough sense to do it on their own. Christina did not threaten <br/>
you, and though her email may have been rude and possibly off the mark, it <br/>
was still made in *private*.  If I were to come to you with a private <br/>
problem and asked you for help, would you forward THAT to the list as <br/>
well?  You know, when Chris said that she could not access the vaccine info <br/>
page, I emailed her OFF LIST and told her I would get the info she needed <br/>
for her.  We then emailed each other a few times, should we make those <br/>
emails public too?    Does everyone out there wish to be bored with every <br/>
little personal exchange?<br/>
<br/>
Second, you waited until you THOUGHT she was trying to pull something over <br/>
on the group (ie lying about her identity) which, if you had read the <br/>
email, she was not.  Whereas I do not agree with Chris&#39;s position on the <br/>
topic of abortion, I did not see her post, using the name Tina instead of <br/>
her own, as dishonest.  I could have easily done the same thing in my own <br/>
post.  It is a way to make an anecdotal story MORE dramatic. People use <br/>
that tactic often, there is nothing at all dishonest about the technique.<br/>
<br/>
So, you get all high and mighty and decide you are going to put this girl <br/>
in her place!  You call her on her so called bluff, only to realize that <br/>
YOU WERE IN THE WRONG (which maybe you never realized seeing as that you <br/>
are never wrong).  But, instead of being honest and admitting this mistake, <br/>
you turn it into some thing about not sending private emails, when that was <br/>
not even what the issue was about.  You thought you had caught this person <br/>
that pissed you off in some kind of lie, but you had not.  And instead of <br/>
saying OOPS, which would have been the HONEST thing to do, it turned into <br/>
some whole other monster.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you can justify this out and rationalize it any way you wish IN YOUR <br/>
MIND, but the fact remains, that there are plenty of us out here, on this <br/>
list, that found your sending that email when you did and your further <br/>
reaction to it to be totally dishonest.  So are you wrong because some of <br/>
us feel that you are wrong and dishonest, or are you totally ok because <br/>
*you* feel rationalized in what you did?  And if you do feel that you were <br/>
in the right with what you did in regards to that email, isn&#39;t the child <br/>
that tells a white lie to get out of a bad situation just as right? In <br/>
certain grey areas, doesn&#39;t the truth become just a little more subjective <br/>
than a clear cut case of right or wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Honesty is not always about truth telling.  It is also how you handle <br/>
situations and info.  If I tell you a secret in confidence, and then I piss <br/>
you off, do you have the right to go and tell that secret?  Do I tell my <br/>
friend with the ugly baby and PPD that her kid is uglier than my dog?  Do I <br/>
tell my landlord that the second cat (which was my daughters bday gift) he <br/>
sees really is ours when I know he will make us get rid of it?  Do I tell <br/>
my sister when she ask, every little thing her kid has done wrong while she <br/>
was out with her husband for their anniversary date?  Do I tell you that <br/>
you really do come off as a snotty, holier than thou, Ms Know-It-All over <br/>
email?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the truth is nothing more than our OPINIONS, and more times than <br/>
not, they really should be kept to ourselves anyway.  Opinions are <br/>
subjective, and therefore, so can be the truth.  Marrying a *friend* so he <br/>
could retain custody of his siblings might not have been an HONEST thing to <br/>
do, and to many it might have even been a LIE, but it was probably the <br/>
RIGHT thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
There is no blanket policy of truth.  Life is not black and white, and <br/>
truth is not always that simple.  Hurting someone&#39;s feeling just so you can <br/>
feel self righteous is much worse than telling a small white lie.<br/>
<br/>
Thats just my opinion though, and I have probably opened myself up to one <br/>
hell of a flame war, so bring it on.<br/>

<br/>
No, I mentioned it right away.<br/>
I just didn&#39;t post it until she showed that she hadn&#39;t left the list, but had <br/>
stayed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;First off, a personal email should remain that way, PERSONAL.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t need private insult over public commentary.  I wasn&#39;t being personal <br/>
on the list.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;If I were to come to you with a private problem and asked you for help, <br/>
would you forward THAT to the list as well?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That wouldn&#39;t be harrassment.  If someone wrote to me privately and later <br/>
claimed something about the exchange that flatly wasn&#39;t true, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
hesitate to defend myself with the facts.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We then emailed each other a few times, should we make those <br/>
emails public too?    Does everyone out there wish to be bored with every <br/>
little personal exchange?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I doubt either of you was insulting the other or making false claims.  I wish <br/>
I had only gotten boring little personal mail instead of BIG nasty personal <br/>
mail.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; that there are plenty of us out here, on this <br/>
list, that found your sending that email when you did and your further <br/>
reaction to it to be totally dishonest. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was straightforward at each point along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Whether a white lie or a big deal lie or an elaborate set of falsehoods is <br/>
right or wrong is subjective.   I&#39;ve already said that in my own set of <br/>
priorities truth is #1.  Others have other priorities.  I was talking all <br/>
along here about what I would do.  For some people it&#39;s guns, or choice, or <br/>
being a good Christian, or a Republican, or a Pagan, or having kids who win <br/>
contests or clean their rooms or whatever.  Everybody has their top five <br/>
(ten, whatever) sacred obligations.  <br/>
<br/>
So again, for explaining and defending what I believe, people are insulting <br/>
me very directly and personally.<br/>
<br/>
When one&#39;s truth is no more than opinion, that&#39;s what discussions are made <br/>
of.  When a person makes a statement she knows to be false, she judges <br/>
herself and others judge who know of it.  It kinda depends who you want to <br/>
please and what you believe about what God knows and cares about, too.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of preventing a rape or harboring Jews in WWII, those are BIG <br/>
exceptions which are justifiable.   Some here considered the presence of a <br/>
gun to be a similar life and death situation.  I didn&#39;t.  That doesn&#39;t make <br/>
me a criminal.  That makes me a person who believes that teaching children to <br/>
lie is worse than having children see/touch guns.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people feel that strongly about sending their kids to school, or <br/>
vaccinating, or feel that strongly that natural childbirth is stupid and <br/>
breastfeeding is disgusting and all KINDS of things.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Honesty is not always about truth telling.  It is also how you handle <br/>
situations and info.  If I tell you a secret in confidence, and then I piss <br/>
you off, do you have the right to go and tell that secret?  Do I tell my <br/>
friend with the ugly baby and PPD that her kid is uglier than my dog?  Do I <br/>
tell my landlord that the second cat (which was my daughters bday gift) he <br/>
sees really is ours when I know he will make us get rid of it?  Do I tell <br/>
my sister when she ask, every little thing her kid has done wrong while she <br/>
was out with her husband for their anniversary date?  Do I tell you that <br/>
you really do come off as a snotty, holier than thou, Ms Know-It-All over <br/>
email?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In this and all else, the best anyone can do is do what they think is right <br/>
and live with the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
If one of the (VERY minor) consequences is that someone you don&#39;t even know <br/>
might, on an e-mail loop say &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; that should be a <br/>
consequence you can live with. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s right to be honest about what I believe.  Because of that <br/>
belief, there are people homeschooling who wouldn&#39;t have if I&#39;d have just <br/>
said &quot;huh.  Yeah, your ideas about school seem right&quot; or who would not be <br/>
unschooling if I&#39;d have said, &quot;Sure, yeah--keep on pushing that curriculum.  <br/>
You paid good money for it.  If he doesn&#39;t finish his work, ground him or <br/>
something.&quot;  There are MANY, many unschoolers and mothers in similar <br/>
attachment parenting situations of all sorts who, just by sharing honestly <br/>
and being somewhat critical of other people&#39;s non-working theories who have <br/>
made gigantic differences in those other people&#39;s lives and families and the <br/>
futures of their children.  I&#39;m not apologizing.  When someone says &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>
decide whether to do this or that,&quot; or &quot;I think TV is evil and so I don&#39;t let <br/>
my children visit where TVs are&quot; or &quot;I will unschool, all except math and <br/>
English,&quot; and if they do it on this list, or on unschooling.com, or at a <br/>
homeschooling meeting where I am, I won&#39;t say &quot;Good Idea!&quot;  And if they seem <br/>
open to another point of view, I won&#39;t keep quiet about what I have learned <br/>
through dealings with my own kids and the other homeschooling families I <br/>
know. <br/>
<br/>
The assumption on discussion lists is that all participants are open to other <br/>
points of view.   I think it would be nice if those offering points of view <br/>
would not be attacked for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736826087">&lt;&lt; To have my awareness, honest and motherhood questioned in public should <br/>
hurt <br/>
 me, and twenty years ago would have, but now I&#39;m used to it.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
 change the truth.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just for what it&#39;s worth, Sandra, when you state that you never lie I don&#39;t <br/>
doubt your word.  You&#39;ve been a source of inspiration (not a word I chose <br/>
lightly) for to me for some time now.  I even save some of your posts to <br/>
reread at another time, usually something that encourages me to be less <br/>
timid, more bold and/or relax.  I&#39;ve recommended this list and the web site <br/>
often and mention your name telling them to take note of when you post and <br/>
how much what you&#39;ve written has meant to me.<br/>
<br/>
I got a chuckle at myself when I read your age.  I&#39;ve often noted how someone <br/>
younger than me had so much more confidence.  Now I know that you&#39;re 3 years <br/>
older.  Don&#39;t ask me why I made this assumption, obviously it doesn&#39;t matter. <br/>
 We don&#39;t always agree and that doesn&#39;t alter my respect for your opinion.  I <br/>
hope that nothing I&#39;ve said has come across as a personal attack.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;P.S.   I HAVE been asked directly &quot;Isn&#39;t she cute?&quot; about babies and have <br/>
 said &quot;Some people think all babies are cute, but I never have.&quot;  (Which is <br/>
 true.) and &quot;All babies look like Eisenhower or Churchhill at first.&quot;   <br/>
 Probably I get away with such things socially because it&#39;s not ALL I&#39;m going <br/>
 to say in the conversation.  I&#39;ve also referred to many babies, my own <br/>
 included as &quot;grubs&quot; or &quot;the larva stage&quot; meaning they weren&#39;t yet doing <br/>
 anything impressive or coordinated but someday they would.  I&#39;ve never said <br/>
 &quot;that is a grub&quot; and walked away.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*snicker*  I&#39;m one of those who thinks all babies are cute so my response is <br/>
usually, &quot;To me all babies are cute&quot;.  The thought of someone calling <br/>
someone&#39;s baby a &quot;grub&quot; cracks me up though.<br/>

much think of it as a life and death situation too.  I have lost <br/>
friends, and had friends that accidentally shot people, so I have <br/>
been on both sides too. My cousin lost his life at 14 while out <br/>
hunting with his younger brother.  One of our close friends lived <br/>
here in St Louis with his dad instead of in New York with his mom and <br/>
brothers because when he was four years old the eight year old <br/>
neighbor handed him a gun that happened to be loaded and our friend <br/>
managed to fire that gun and kill the boy that handed it to him.  I <br/>
knew two young men that lost their lives playing russian roulette.   <br/>
Under normal circumstances, these young men were very smart.  It <br/>
happens, and to some of us it happens all too often.  <br/>
<br/>
My own husband carried a gun with him around town when he was 15.  He <br/>
went to a military school, was familiar with guns, understood them, <br/>
but still walked around with an unloaded gun in his coat just to mess <br/>
with people.  He never really stopped and thought about meeting up <br/>
with ANOTHER fool with a gun that might be loaded.  <br/>

any damn day of the week.  My big thing is that they come tell ME <br/>
right away what happened so we can deal with it, and not lie to me.  <br/>
And you can go on and on about how lying leads to lying and blah blah <br/>
blah.  I guess you never did santa, easter bunny, tooth fairy, told <br/>
fairy tales, imagined you were something you were not with your <br/>
kids?  If not, you must live in a REALLY boring house!!<br/>

subject of the guns, and this actually has nothing to do with your <br/>
opinion on that.  But I do think you are being a hypocrite about <br/>
honesty and about how you have never lied, never been dishonest, <br/>
etc.  You are coming off as quite pious and self righteous and if <br/>
that is your intention, then so be it.  I have a sister that is just <br/>
like that and no one ever wants to talk to her or be around her <br/>
either.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

said, feel free to rationalize it out any way you wish.  As long as <br/>
you can live with yourself at the end of the day, then so be it.<br/>

 I&#39;m not apologizing.  When someone says &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then do not attack others.  There are tactful ways to take part in <br/>
opposing discussions. Your posts that I have read often come off as <br/>
blunt, rude, or down right condecending.  Or another option is  just <br/>
not take part! Just because you happen to have an opinion on <br/>
EVERYTHING does not mean you always have to share. I kept my opinions <br/>
on AP parenting to myself when that was going on.  I am not a fan of <br/>
it myself, but I am not going to step in and come down on someone <br/>
that really believes in it.  Just because it is NOT FOR MY FAMILY <br/>
does not make it wrong or evil for someone elses. <br/>
<br/>
All of this is beside the point.  The fact of the matter still <br/>
remains that in the opinion of some  you were totally in the <br/>
wrong and dishonest about what you did with Christina.   And since <br/>
honesty is of the utmost importance for you, I thought I should share <br/>
that.  And since you INSISTED it all be done on the list, that is <br/>
what I have done.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a good evening, <br/>

in everyone eyes as she likes to think she is.  She is more than willing to <br/>
put her opinions of others on the table, but when others do it to her, it <br/>
is an attack, and that is just wrong.<br/>
<br/>
And I never came out and said what Christina said was right either, and in <br/>
fact said she was quite rude and off the point.  The fact still remains <br/>
that the email was not sent in as an honest way of dealing with an ongoing <br/>
problem, but was sent in to nail someone for doing something wrong, which <br/>
she had not even done!  Sandra&#39;s point was that this girl had used a <br/>
different name when she sent in the PRIVATE email, and she was trying to <br/>
call her on THAT.  It was evident that this girl was not doing that, but <br/>
instead of saying OOPS, she did not.<br/>
<br/>
So, I was just merely pointing this out.  The subject was honesty was it <br/>
not?  Did I not go on to say that if Sandra felt justified in what she did, <br/>
then that was all that matters?<br/>
<br/>
Just as she kept stating over and over that these mothers were wrong to <br/>
encourage these children to maybe lie in hard situations, I am just stating <br/>
that I feel she is equally wrong in saying that she is free from being <br/>
dishonest herself.  And that honesty is often a SUBJECTIVE thing.<br/>
<br/>
She has a right to share her opinions, as I do, and just as she will call <br/>
bull on something, so will I.<br/>

&lt;&lt; ***Sandra: Does she know kids like that?  Do you?<br/>
 It sounds very much like a scene from a movie, and not even a very <br/>
 imaginative movie.  Sorry.<br/>
 <br/>
 If you expect other people to act like dramatic movie characters, <br/>
 then I <br/>
 guess you should have your own dramatic movie lines prepared.*** <br/>
 <br/>
 To me, that was kind of a mean, snide and personal jab.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that comment by Sandra was in response to my post. To be honest, I did <br/>
take it to be an attempt at a jab, but didn&#39;t let it bother me since I knew I <br/>
was being realistic, *not* overly dramatic. I responded with a humorous (I <br/>
hope) bit of sarcasm, and clarification of my point, and left it at that.<br/>
<br/>
I decided not to take it personally since Sandra doesn&#39;t actually know me and <br/>
everyone else on this list is intelligent enough to make their own <br/>
determination about what I was saying. I didn&#39;t worry about it because I am <br/>
secure in my position. I have lost a grandfather, a best friend, and a cousin <br/>
to guns so I recognize any situation where a fool is playing with a gun as <br/>
dangerous. I also enjoy target shooting at a gun range, so I don&#39;t feel like <br/>
an extremist on the subject. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that so many people on this list have strong opinions <br/>
about things. I think it&#39;s helpful to remember, though how our messages will <br/>
be perceived, no matter how we intend them. My dad always taught me I could <br/>
catch more flies with honey. That doesn&#39;t mean compromising your principles, <br/>
it simply means communicating with respect, candor, and compassion. I sure do <br/>
love my daddy.<br/>

I believed it was someone who was no longer on the list.  Why make a deal <br/>
about someone who was gone?<br/>

&lt;&lt;I am just stating that I feel she is equally wrong in saying that she is <br/>

It would be really cool for people who want to defend lying if they could <br/>
believe everyone lies, consciously and willingly, and that it&#39;s really REALLY <br/>
okay.  I don&#39;t believe that.  I know lots of people who do not.  I have <br/>
former friends who are gone for being dishonest.<br/>
It&#39;s a personal thing and I can&#39;t expect it of everyone (or anyone, except my <br/>
own family and closest friends).  I was stating that just as some people&#39;s <br/>
main issue in life is abortion (pro or con) or guns (pro or con) mine is <br/>
honesty.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So yes, if one must have a gun, <br/>
safty precautions MUST be taught.<br/>
I do not like guns and will not have them in the house.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My parents were both hunter safety instructors.  I never took their course.  <br/>
I never had a gun, and have never gone hunting.  Many of the other kids at <br/>
school thought that bizarre--they LOVED my parents and they loved hunting, <br/>
and they saw it as a big waste that I wasn&#39;t taking advantage of the <br/>
opportunity literally in my own home.<br/>
