&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Especially when the crime involves a symbol of the political <br/>
entity, don&#39;t  you think?  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to me that many Europeans I&#39;ve met (Germans in <br/>
particular) are very apathetic - lackadaisical - unconcerned - not <br/>
sure exactly what word I need here - toward nationalistic symbols.  <br/>
They are frankly uncomprehending of American patriotism and don&#39;t get <br/>
what the big deal is if someone wants to burn a flag as a symbolic <br/>
gesture - as one pragmatic German friend said to me, &quot;It&#39;s just a <br/>
piece of fabric.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think if this incident had happened in Germany, if the crime had <br/>
been prosecuted at all, it would have been as theft without any <br/>
additional hoopla about desecration of a national symbol. I think <br/>
this was also the case in the incident in Greece.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know any Greeks, though, so maybe they do have more of an <br/>
attachment to their flag.<br/>

I have a German friend who is fascinated with all things American.<br/>
<br/>
He was here on Flag Day one year.  Flags were EVERYWHERE.  I told him even on <br/>
other days, though, there are flags at all the schools, fast food places, car <br/>
dealerships...  He said he had noticed that and thought it was wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
I asked him whether there weren&#39;t flags out at schools and post offices in <br/>
Germany,  He looked surprised and said there is only one flag flown, and that&#39;s <br/>
where the chancellor (or whatever he is) is.   His charming and sensible <br/>
explanation about their not having their flag out more was this:  <br/>
          &quot;It makes the neighbors nervous.&quot;<br/>

Yeah, that&#39;s a good way to put it.  I love Germany now, but it wasn&#39;t all <br/>
that long ago that vitriolic nationalism was a REAL problem there...<br/>
