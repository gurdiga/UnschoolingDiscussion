<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I agree with this to a point, but I think some of it depends on their <br/>
&gt; nature.  I have two girls, one <br/>
&gt; will always delve into a new topic that she is interested in and will &#39;play <br/>
&gt; with it&#39; until she is done.  <br/>
&gt; The other doesn&#39;t seem to have interests that draw her in.  She needs more <br/>
&gt; guidance and <br/>
&gt; encouragement to broaden her horizons and interests. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That didn&#39;t contradict what I said, though. Unschoolers have parents and <br/>
other adults around to help them broaden their horizons and interests - so <br/>
that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
However, a lot of what people may think the kids NEED for college - may not <br/>
be accurate. <br/>
<br/>
MUCH more than needing a knowledge of any particular &quot;subject&quot; -- they need <br/>
curiosity, initiative, perserverence, time-management skills, and <br/>
self-confidence. And other such things. <br/>
<br/>
And they need &quot;background&quot; and they need to be able to read for information <br/>
and listen for information (because most college courses, but not all, rely <br/>
on traditional textbook/lecture formats. By &quot;background&quot; I mean they need to <br/>
exist in a world that containts lots of input - has lots of opportunities to <br/>
learn interesting stuff and make connections between things. There is no <br/>
content that is specifically necessary.<br/>

have these traits naturally.  If not, will they strive for <br/>
improvement in these areas on their own given support?<br/>
<br/>
Can you think of anything you have done *in particular* for each of <br/>
your children to nurture these characteristics?<br/>

there.  Feel free to email me offlist.<br/>
