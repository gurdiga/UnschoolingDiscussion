<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks, Sherry.&nbsp;I definitely use that number. 
I do know that nail polish usually contains dibutyl phtalate that gets into a 
woman&#39;s reproductive organs and when she becomes pregnant gets into the babies 
also causing defects.&nbsp; I wonder if this is why so many woman have trouble 
conceiving...probably a combination of environmental chemicals and the chemicals 
ingested from processed and conventionally grown food.-Collette</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335420306">Hi Collette,<br/>
<br/>
As far as working it a Nail Salon, while pregnant.  I&#39;m certainly glad I<br/>
didn&#39;t have to do it.  I would expect that it would effect an unborn<br/>
child, how I have no idea.  I have friends who might know.  From the<br/>
information I have, anything with formaldehyde in is a possible human<br/>
carcinogen.  Many cosmetics contain formaldehyde as a preservative.  The<br/>
information is from a Toxin Checklist that can be ordered from Healthy<br/>
Home Publishing toll-free 1-(877) 288-3344.  It&#39;s a informative list<br/>
that takes the ten most common cleaners and personal care products and<br/>
lists the long and short term hazards.<br/>
