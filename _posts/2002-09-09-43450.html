<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058577688">Kama Sutra is a bit outdated in it&#39;s original form. Creative <br/>
positions <br/>
to be <br/>
sure, very open about sex but not as respectful to the woman as what <br/>
is <br/>
culturally acceptable today.<br/>
BUT, the line of products bearing the Kama Sutra name are incredible.<br/>
They are classy, high quality, intimacy products. I beleive they <br/>
will <br/>
enhance <br/>
anyone&#39;s sex life.<br/>
The game is very, very erotic...slow paced and brings you much <br/>
closer <br/>
to your <br/>
partner by communicating desires and so on.<br/>
So I&#39;m sorry for the person here that would never think of having <br/>
any <br/>
Kama <br/>
Sutra in their house......it&#39;s actually a rather beautiful way to <br/>
promote <br/>
closeness with your spouse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, don&#39;t feel sorry for me!  I am the one who said I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
that game in my house.  I am also Catholic and don&#39;t appreciate <br/>
another poster implying that means I can&#39;t have fun with sex unless <br/>
I am aimed at procreation.  A joke, maybe, but it also shows a great <br/>
misunderstanding of what sex means to a Catholic.  My children might <br/>
be raised to believe that sex outside of marriage is a sin, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they (or I) believe that sex must be for procreation <br/>
only.   I wasn&#39;t raised to believe that and my children know very <br/>
well that I have a stash of sexy nighties in my drawer and that <br/>
their father and I enjoy closeness that includes sex more often than <br/>
the seven times that resulted in children!  I don&#39;t need a game <br/>
based on some Hindu practice to have some fun with my husband in the <br/>
bedroom.   What being open to life means in our sexual relationship <br/>
is that God is a part of our lives in all respects, including our <br/>
sexual life.  We believe that God designed sex for pleasure as well <br/>
as for procreation.   Trust me. I don&#39;t need a game or a book to get <br/>
creative with my husband.<br/>
-married for 23 years, and it just keeps getting better!<br/>
