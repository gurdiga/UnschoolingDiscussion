<br/>
&quot;If you live in a material universe where acquiring things is very <br/>
important to you, then family is an absolute deterrent to maintaining <br/>
that sort of a world, because family involves values like affection, <br/>
and sympathy, and passion, and types of pleasure that lead nowhere in <br/>
a material sense.&quot; ~~John Taylor Gatto in &quot;Alternatives in Education&quot; <br/>
~~<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
HOMESCHOOL RESOURCE CENTER IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY<br/>
http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/191.html<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever wanted your library to have a wealth of homeschooling <br/>
supplies, curriculums and resources like microscopes and telescopes? <br/>
Most of us have that fantasy, and in one small town in Illinois, it&#39;s <br/>
a dream that has come true.<br/>
<br/>
For many years now I have held a vision of the library of the future. <br/>
This library would be a public learning center. It would do more than <br/>
lend out materials. It would be far more than a school. It would be <br/>
similar to the private Homeschool Resource Centers that are cropping <br/>
up in areas, but it would not require a paid membership to use. It <br/>
would be a community-based learning Mecca!<br/>
<br/>
I never really expected to see even a small part of my dream become a <br/>
reality, but I knew that I wanted my small town library to be as <br/>
strong as it could be. I began to volunteer with the Friends of the <br/>
Johnsburg Public Library almost as soon as we moved into the area. <br/>
From the first, I found volunteering was a win-win situation. I could <br/>
help them raise money for programs and updated technology and <br/>
meanwhile get first pick of all the books in the used book sale for <br/>
my family. Best of all my children could volunteer along with me and <br/>
I knew that when they were bored or tired they could wander off and <br/>
find a good book for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Over a few years, as I volunteered more and more, I slowly began to <br/>
share some of my ideas with the staff and the Friends group. Together <br/>
we were able to make numerous small changes, such as providing the <br/>
library with receipt printers so every patron gets a full listing of <br/>
all the items checked out (great for sticking in a file to look back <br/>
on when you worry that the kids aren&#39;t learning enough!). Library <br/>
staff was made increasingly aware that a large number of <br/>
homeschoolers lived in the area because we kept pointing ourselves <br/>
out to them whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
Staff and volunteers together have built, month-by-month, project <br/>
upon project, a strong foundation of trust. In Stephen Covey&#39;s book, <br/>
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, he discusses how people need <br/>
to build relationships (networking), they need to work within their <br/>
sphere of influence and they need to begin with the end in mind. At <br/>
my small town library we were actively doing these things in our own <br/>
ways. Slowly our small library has become technologically advanced, <br/>
well equipped and well respected.<br/>

HOMESCHOOLING LEARNING DIFFERENCES<br/>
<br/>
From Prima Publishing: In &quot;Complete Guide to Successfully<br/>
Homeschooling the Child with Learning Differences&quot; (Prima, ISBN <br/>
0-7615-3569-1), author Leonore Colacion Hayes shines a spotlight on <br/>
the challenges and joys of homeschooling special-needs children <br/>
(children with disorders ranging from autism or ADD to those with <br/>
other learning disabilities or who simply march to the beat of a <br/>
different drummer). Author Hayes, who has experienced and met this <br/>
challenge personally as well as worked professionally with hundreds <br/>
of homeschooling families, begins with simple starting points and <br/>
moves through issues such as how to develop strong family bonds with <br/>
a child who may not want to do this naturally and ends with extensive <br/>
lists on where to get help from both public and private sources. <br/>
Scattered throughout are experiences from homeschooling families <br/>
across the country who emphasize how they were able to successfully <br/>
homeschool their special needs children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m glad today that Kirby is a tattler. Marty, Caiti (Rhiannon&#39;s <br/>
Caiti) and Holly were halfway up our LONG street--about five houses <br/>
away, on the other side, and still truckin&#39;. Holly was absolutely <br/>
naked except for wet sand on her feet and up to her elbows. Marty had <br/>
on a pair of torn pants, no shirt, no shoes. At least Caiti was <br/>
clothed. No one was out there to see them except three humorless <br/>
grandparents. I walked down and said, &quot;Whose idea was it to walk up <br/>
here?&quot; Marty immediately pointed at Caiti with a sincere look, and <br/>
Caiti pointed at Marty with a devilish look, and Holly let me carry <br/>
her home and put clothes on her. Now they&#39;re eating popcorn, turkey <br/>
sandwiches, watching Tiny Toons, and drinking chocolate milk or juice <br/>
(some one, some chose the other).<br/>
<br/>
When I used to watch Gilligan&#39;s Island in 4:00 re-runs after school <br/>
every day, I would wonder whose idea it was for the plot, how many <br/>
writers there were, how they decided who could come and visit, what <br/>
device they would use to prevent the visitor from rescuing them, how <br/>
they must plan in advance not to have too-similar plots near each <br/>
other, and the re-runs must be kept in that same order too. I <br/>
wondered about them changing the theme song--at first it had said, <br/>
&quot;the movie star, and the rest,&quot; but in later seasons it said, &quot;the <br/>
movie star, the professor and Mary Ann,&quot; and I wondered whether they <br/>
had resung the whole thing or just spliced in that line, because it <br/>
sounded the same as it had before. And had they done it because the <br/>
actors complained? Their agents complained? I wondered whether the <br/>
pedal-powered washing machine (or whatever it was) really worked by <br/>
the pedals, or whether it was just secretly plugged in, and if so, <br/>
where did the wires run? I wondered if much of it was on indoor sets. <br/>
How deep was that water? (As an adult, I saw what&#39;s left of the set <br/>
at Universal Studios. Cool! Outside! Actual little lake.) When I <br/>
would see a show the second time, I&#39;d look around for things I had <br/>
missed the first time. I would re-write lines in my mind, things that <br/>
could have been funnier, or sounded more in character for that <br/>
person. I&#39;d wonder who knew more about hammock making, the captain or <br/>
the professor? Maybe Ginger or Mary Ann knew macram√©. When there was <br/>
a show which didn&#39;t have one of the actors in, I&#39;d wonder whether he <br/>
was sick or on vacation or what? And if an actor misses the filming <br/>
of a sitcom, does he still get paid? I wondered about them having to <br/>
keep their hair the same for years, and which of them were might be <br/>
wearing wigs. Where were they supposed to be getting nail polish and <br/>
lipstick? Hair spray? I wondered if the professor was a physics <br/>
professor or engineering, or what, and whether he would lose his job <br/>
at the university. I wondered about that Mr. Magoo voice on Thurston <br/>
Howell. I wondered about Amelia Earhart. I wondered about the <br/>
soundtrack music. Did they just have little themes they pushed a <br/>
button on during final edit, or was each show done separately? I <br/>
wondered if the fruit was real or props. I wondered about <br/>
cameras--where were they? Did they have to sweep the dirt between <br/>
takes? I wondered if the guy who played the lost WWII pilot was <br/>
really Japanese. I could think more during an episode of Gilligan&#39;s <br/>
Island than most other people I knew could think in a whole week. I <br/>
didn&#39;t bother to ask my parents any of the questions. They would have <br/>
thought it was stupid to be thinking them. So to all outside <br/>
appearances (except to my cousin, Nada, who was my age) I was just <br/>
zoning out, involved in the plot of another 25 minutes of Gilligan&#39;s <br/>
Island. That wasn&#39;t true at all.&quot;<br/>

HOMESCHOOL WEBSITE OF THE MONTH<br/>
http://borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers Unlimited is the website for an informal group of <br/>
Connecticut unschoolers. You&#39;ll find a decent list of resources and a <br/>
number of good articles. If you suffer from doubting family members, <br/>
share with them the article about site owners Luz Shosie and Ned <br/>
Vare&#39;s 21- year-old son Cassidy. Other websites sharing the same home <br/>
page give information on the myths about ADD. Lots to explore here.<br/>

READER RESPONSE QUESTIONS<br/>
<br/>
Questions for the May/June issue of Home Education Magazine&#39;s <br/>
Questions and Answers column:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are moving to a remote area of Alaska in the next few months. We <br/>
homeschool the two children still at home, ages 10 and 14. I don&#39;t <br/>
know how we will fill their time without libraries, museums, theaters <br/>
and other enrichments. Any suggestions?&quot;<br/>
~~ Emma ~~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There was a time in our home when &#39;Let&#39;s read!&#39; meant I had about <br/>
two seconds before 10+ books landed on the bed in front of me. We <br/>
couldn&#39;t get enough of reading. Sometimes the only way I could stop <br/>
reading was if I fell asleep, at which time the eight year old (now <br/>
10) would pick up reading where I left off. During a very hectic year <br/>
and a half of moving three times we lost our insatiable reading times <br/>
together, and now that we are finally settled in a new town and new <br/>
home I want them back again. But, alas, those times seem to be gone <br/>
forever. Our children don&#39;t want to read anymore, nor listen to me <br/>
read. I don&#39;t and can&#39;t force them to sit and listen to me read but I <br/>
feel they are really missing out, especially the younger one, age <br/>
six. Will he love books and stories like his brother if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
get the exposure that his older brother received? How can we get back <br/>
into reading together or have I lost my read-aloud job forever?&quot; ~~ <br/>
