<div id="ygrps-yiv-187958242">I just posted the third edition of Unschooling Voices. The link is:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.foreverparents.com/UnschoolingVoices.html">http://www.foreverparents.com/UnschoolingVoices.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Scroll down to the bottom of that page for the direct link.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll find links to #1 and #2 there and also information if you&#39;re <br/>
interested in participating in the 4th one. The more the merrier! <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to answer the new &quot;Question of the month&quot; but don&#39;t have <br/>
a blog, post it here with &quot;Unschooling Voices #4&quot; as the title and I&#39;ll <br/>
post it for you. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. :-)<br/>
