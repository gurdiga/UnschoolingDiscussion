Especially consider the fact that the authros of TWTM not only sell this book  ( as an unschooler may sell a book on unschooling) - but also write and sell English and History and related actvity books that are *sugested for their  curricula ideas... I like the ideas of a classical education, Ã§os I like reading and history - but for me, not to force onto my dc...Leonie W. <br/>
