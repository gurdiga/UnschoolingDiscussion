&lt;&lt; Can *any* of you guarantee that you haven&#39;t done some<br/>
 unknown violence or irreparable damage to your child&#39;s<br/>
 future by any action or decision you have made?  Would<br/>
 you want a Majority to tell you that you have<br/>
 ignorantly and callously played Russian Roulette with<br/>
 your child&#39;s life?  Would you feel comfortable in<br/>
 saying that very thing to other people on this list<br/>
 about the immunization, educational, religious,<br/>
 sexual, tv/computer, Ritalin issues, among others?<br/>
 <br/>
 Probably not.  You are too vulnerable that way.  BUT<br/>
 you *are* comfortable in applying an inflexible,<br/>
 simplistic and virtuous-sounding generality in judging<br/>
 a small minority who are un-PC or independent enough<br/>
 to see things differently than the Majority.  You are<br/>
 comfortable with applying that one-size-fits-all<br/>
 measuring stick for &#39;violence&#39; to all children and<br/>
 families, no matter how different *their* experience<br/>
 might be from your own.<br/>
 <br/>
 Must be comfy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103383479">I am not being sarcastic or ironic at all when I say<br/>
that I am glad that you have been able to avoid ever<br/>
using smacking your child again after that one<br/>
incident, and that this has worked for you.  I agree<br/>
that spanking is an ineffective at best and damaging<br/>
at worst form of regular discipline.  I agree that it<br/>
is preferable to avoid *all* forms of violence in<br/>
dealing with your children, whenever possible.  I also<br/>
have observed situations where I felt that parents had<br/>
no *better* choice than to use one form or another of<br/>
coersion or physical discipline... not that it was a<br/>
*good* thing, but that all options available were<br/>
undesirable to some degree, and that the least evil<br/>
had to be chosen.<br/>
<br/>
I was not addressing every person who had posted from<br/>
an anti-spanking position here... there are people who<br/>
have had thoughtful and valid points here, who<br/>
expressed their opinions reasonably and<br/>
nonjudgmentally.  But there were also people who very<br/>
specifically were condemning me, and also condemning<br/>
wholesale any parent who did not hold the poster&#39;s<br/>
opinion.  Those were the people to whom I was<br/>
speaking.<br/>
