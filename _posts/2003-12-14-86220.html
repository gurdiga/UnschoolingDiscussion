<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733043397">Okay, I take it back.  It&#39;s something that really went around, and apparently <br/>
there was a song about it.   A song might make people remember something.  A <br/>
cartoon poster might help.  But talking about an alligator eating wouldn&#39;t <br/>
help.   <br/>

Maybe this is  the sort of thing that should never be taught to first and <br/>
second graders.  If you wait until they&#39;re older they don&#39;t  need to invest any <br/>
time in a song or cartoon about  an alligator eating a big number.   They could <br/>
be doing fun stuff or REAL alligator-behavior-learning, or mathematical <br/>
concepts in English instead of in numerical symbols.<br/>
<br/>
I still think it&#39;s a profoundly bad idea as an explanation, and that any <br/>
concept that makes the memory device more convoluted and complicated than the <br/>
situation at hand is horrible.  &quot;Righty tighty&quot; is useful.   If it were replaced <br/>
or augmented with &quot;If you were facing north in the northern hemisphere and an <br/>
alligator were facing east and you wanted to tighten a screw on the crocodile. <br/>
. .&quot;    Another thing with screws is muscle memory and trial and error.  One <br/>
way works, and the other way doesn&#39;t.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even complicated convoluted ideas might help one child understand something.<br/>
As lowercase b having a belly helps Ethan.<br/>
<br/>
(If anyone does have kids mixing up b and d you can show them that if they<br/>
make circles with their forefingers and thumbs and hold up their fingers to<br/>
make b with the left hand and d with the right and then hold them together<br/>
that it looks like the word bed and the object bed. It&#39;s a lot more complex<br/>
to write out than to show someone! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But the point Sandra is trying to make is that complicated convoluted ways<br/>
aren&#39;t a good place to start when explaining something. Begin with simple<br/>
and clear. And if simple and clear doesn&#39;t work then maybe they aren&#39;t ready<br/>
to understand yet.<br/>
<br/>
The alligator thing was meant for little kids who don&#39;t have the need for<br/>
greater than or less than. It was purely for memorization&#39;s sake. It was to<br/>
make a fact stick so the kids could spit it back for a test. It turned<br/>
something nonsensical and useless (to them since they didn&#39;t need it) into<br/>
something that resembled something they enjoyed (animals).<br/>
<br/>
If we just wait until they need the information, then simple and clear will<br/>
very likely work.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m curious now whether you feel the same about that as you do about<br/>
&gt; the alligator thing.<br/>
&gt; Is it different because the letters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; come up in the real<br/>
&gt; world much more often than &lt; and &gt; or is it just more convoluted<br/>
&gt; nonsense?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure Sandra will come an explain, but the way I see it is that the<br/>
&quot;help&quot; is more confusing than the actual symbol. Why would alligators eat<br/>
only big numbers? What do alligators have to do with greater than or less<br/>
than.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes memory aids aren&#39;t straightforward but they&#39;re easier than what<br/>
someone is trying to memorize. Every Good Boy Deserves Favor, Roy G. Biv, --<br/>
there&#39;s one for the planets that I&#39;m forgetting -- don&#39;t have anything to do<br/>
with music, colors (or planets if I could remember it) but they&#39;re catchy<br/>
and help someone remember something that doesn&#39;t have an obvious pattern or<br/>
obvious visual or other relationship to what it&#39;s representing.<br/>
<br/>
The less than/greater than symbol *is* obvious: small number on the small<br/>
side, big number on the big side. b and d together do look like a bed.<br/>
Righty tighty, lefty loosy has the directions and their relationship to what<br/>
they do right in the rhyme. There&#39;s a direct relation to the help and what<br/>
the thing trying to be understood is.<br/>

that is often mistaken for dyslexia in young children.<br/>
<br/>
Everything in a child&#39;s world is 3D, until reading and<br/>
arithmetic enter in.<br/>
<br/>
A chair is a chair is a chair, whether it is facing<br/>
left or right or turned upside down or on its side. <br/>
He understands the &quot;chairness&quot; of the object no matter<br/>
what its position, and changing the position doesn&#39;t<br/>
change what it is.<br/>
<br/>
All objects are what they are.<br/>
<br/>
A lowercase p, b, d, q  are basically all the same to<br/>
the child because he is looking at it with the same<br/>
reasoning he explores the rest of his world.<br/>
<br/>
The same for 2 and 5, for 6 and 9.  <br/>

<br/>
I think Teresa said he made it up to help himself. So for some reason that<br/>
convoluted obscure little thing helped him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably not something that would help anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
(All I can think of is that he knew that belly was spelled belly and not<br/>
delly so equated the belly on b with the word belly.)<br/>
<br/>
What I meant when I said &quot;Even complicated convoluted ideas might help one<br/>
child understand something&quot; are the things kids come up with to help them<br/>
remember something. Sometimes those things don&#39;t make sense to anyone else.<br/>
They&#39;re based on the the unique colletion of connections a particular child<br/>
has. (And it did turn out that Ethan made up the belly thing himself.)<br/>

Ok, about this less-than greater-than thing... what I<br/>
don&#39;t understand is WHY it would ever need to be<br/>
taught.  I mean, even a 2 year old knows when their<br/>
brother gets more cookies than he does...and that he<br/>
has less than his brother.<br/>
<br/>
Am I really missing something, or is it just so a kid<br/>
can get a few math problems right on a standardized<br/>
test and bulk up his score to look good for the<br/>
beaurocrats?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849514367">By the way, just to be really clear. I am not saying that these little <br/>
memory tricks never work. I&#39;m sure there are people who remember that <br/>
the alligator eats the big number.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying that unschoolers should think really hard about whether or <br/>
not they really want to teach their kids to think of math as memorizing <br/>
a bunch of tricks. THAT is a really bad idea, imo.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of things &quot;work&quot; in achieving a specific goal, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
make them a good idea in the bigger picture.  Spanking, bribing, <br/>
sweeping the dirt under the rug, stuffing dirty clothes into a closet <br/>
&lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes little tricks can be played around with to see why they work <br/>
or as shortcuts to do something quickly, too. The &quot;nines&quot; trick for <br/>
multiplying on the fingers is an example of that. I wouldn&#39;t show that <br/>
to a kid until they already very thoroughly understood what multiplying <br/>
is - but as a fun way to &quot;do&quot; the nines, I would, because I&#39;ve seen <br/>
kids play with it and try to figure out why it works and they learn a <br/>
whole lot that way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see things like the alligator eats the big number as useful in <br/>
those ways, though, unless it stimulates the kid to think about whether <br/>
alligators really eat numbers or big things or ???<br/>

&lt;&lt;LOL Sarah came up with that one on her own when trying to remember how to<br/>
write them correctly...she says &quot;b has a belly&quot; and &quot;d has a derriere!&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s cute. But wouldn&#39;t it depend on which way this little letter was<br/>
standing?<br/>
I can see where some people still can&#39;t see that as working. If I&#39;m thinking<br/>
of the letter facing the opposite way, the b would have the butt and the d<br/>
would have the belly.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the way Joseph thinks!<br/>
