<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941026993">I&#39;ve been back and forth with the unschooling/preschool <br/>
unschooling/kindergarten thing.  Zak has been to 7 different preschools (1 of <br/>
which is a Kindergarten) and one of those schools he&#39;s been too twice.  You <br/>
would have thought that by now I would have made the decision that <br/>
unschooling him is the best way to go.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading Linda Dobson&#39;s &quot;The First Year of Homeschooling&quot; and it&#39;s been so <br/>
much help to me in making me look at myself and what I&#39;m expecting of me.  <br/>
I&#39;ve made a list of pro&#39;s and cons for unschooling (I can&#39;t imagine doing <br/>
anything formal) and there are only 2 cons and they both have to do with me.  <br/>
One is that I won&#39;t be able to work on my business during the day because <br/>
I&#39;ll have both kids and the second is that if I send him to school I won&#39;t <br/>
have find kids for Zak to socialize with.. All of the pros had to do with the <br/>
kids.  So far I&#39;ve come up with 7 reasons to unschool Zak and eventually Max <br/>
(2) next month....I&#39;ll get there completely soon.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Zak and I talked for half an hour about smoke detectors, fire, <br/>
smoke, what to do in the event of a fire, why he was scared of smoke <br/>
detectors.  He stayed up till 9:30pm (normally goes to bed at 7:30pm) and he <br/>
also came into our bed and then talked about a different subject.  It was <br/>
wonderful.  Some of the best conversations I have with Zak are late at night <br/>
where I&#39;m just answering his many, many questions. He&#39;s more of a night <br/>
person with his questions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you every &quot;really&quot; know for sure you are doing the &quot;right&quot; <br/>
thing by unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

<br/>
You will get more sure as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
You can work on your home business at other times of the week.  Finding <br/>
playmates IS part of the job of an unschooling mom, but the greatest benefit <br/>
will be that as you yourself meet other homeschooling families you&#39;ll see <br/>
more clearly what the range of kid-knowledge is, and you&#39;ll get to see how <br/>
what those families are or aren&#39;t doing affects their <br/>
peace/progress/learning.  It will be strengthening for you to be around other <br/>
homeschoolers (and unschoolers if you can find them).  <br/>
<br/>
Having the kids be home alone with mom all day every day isn&#39;t the ideal way <br/>
to make them think unschooling is their whole future.  Get them out.  Get <br/>
other kids/families in.  Mix it up.  Carschooling and worldschooling might be <br/>
better terms for you to think about at first. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Ther is nothing better than to read everything at www.unschooling.com, and if <br/>
your answers aren&#39;t there, ask more questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And even if I were to<br/>

finding out.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too schooly.<br/>
Let her find out by making them both ways, not from being told in words.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Can all kids (even though public<br/>
schooled though 6th grade) be unschooled?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All humans, no matter what age, can learn on their own unless it is trained <br/>
out of them.  And it can be recovered.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s more important for the parents to understand it than for the kids to.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think we&#39;re saying go into the yard and see what bugs are there, and you&#39;re <br/>
wanting someone to send you a dead butterfly with a pin through it.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t tell you want to say because we can&#39;t know what you will see or hear <br/>
or touch today.  Just have conversations with your kids as you would with <br/>
interesting/interested adult friends, and see where life leads you.  But keep <br/>
things interesting.  Go to museums, construction sites, tool stores, seed <br/>
shops, look at neat Christmas decorations for a long, long time even if you <br/>
don&#39;t need any.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have noticed recently that many people think of unschooling as<br/>
&quot;sneaking in learning&quot;  to what the kids are doing.  I don&#39;t see this as<br/>
unschooling. I&#39;m not sure I even see that as honest. I dobn&#39;t know oif<br/>
that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about, but it&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen coming up<br/>
a lot lately in a few different places.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as your job to get your daughter &quot;involved&quot;, if that means<br/>
to push her into being curious about brownie recipes or other ways to<br/>
measure stuff. I imagine that someday this stuff will come up - I<br/>
remember that we&#39;ve had to halve recipes sometimes because we run out of<br/>
eggs, stuff like that, but it&#39;s not something I would plan. I&#39;m just not<br/>
the director here, so I don&#39;t need any specific resources besides the<br/>
ones my kid asks for. <br/>
<br/>
As I was sitting here writing this, Cacie bounded up to me holding the<br/>
comics from tody&#39;s paper, very excited because they&#39;ve finally opened the<br/>
voting on whether or not to keep the comic Preteena, which she really<br/>
likes. She had read that you could vote by email and wanted to make sure<br/>
she got her vote in, so I saved a draft of  this message and typed her<br/>
email vote in to the newspaper as she dictated. I put that in my outbox<br/>
and she danced away again and I went back to email. That&#39;s how it works.<br/>
I think she&#39;s now practicing her lines for her part as Br�unhilde in Die<br/>
Walk�re, either that or continuing her most recent playmobil setup, which<br/>
is about a talent show. I can hear her voice but not what she&#39;s saying...<br/>
if she asks me to do lines with her, I will, but it&#39;s her play so I&#39;m not<br/>
going to go tell her it&#39;s time to practice. She&#39;s doing what she loves<br/>
and wants to do...<br/>
<br/>
And we both have the flu today, so technically I guess she&#39;s &quot;home sick&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with this but don&#39;t worry. When I start to wonder or worry I look at <br/>
my kids and think about what they are doing or have done and it really is <br/>
quite remarkable. A friend of mine called me last spring to say that his 3rd <br/>
grader had tested at public school to have the abilities in most subjects of <br/>
a 6th grader. He was not calling me to &quot;shove it in my face&quot; type of thing, <br/>
he was just proud and we always tell each other what our kids are doing. <br/>
Anyway I could have felt anxious that my kids were &quot;missing out&quot; somehow but <br/>
I knew it wasn&#39;t true. I see my children&#39;s accomplishments and to me they are <br/>
astounding. My girls (17 & 15) are now teaching some classes and the boys are <br/>
building things that passed my husband&#39;s and my abilities long ago. I just <br/>
let them do what they love and it turns out that their zest to learn grows <br/>
and grows. Whenever I become worried I just remind myself that I was a public <br/>
school student who really learned very little. <br/>

the markings and what type of bird by looking at<br/>

<br/>
Each child is an individual and the only way to know for sure is to be able<br/>
to see into the future.  Do the best you can and trust your personal<br/>
knowledge of your child.  Only *you* know your child best, not the ps<br/>
system, not your neighbors, not your friends and relatives, not the<br/>
newspapers, not magazine articles or even books by *experts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By unschooling you are giving your child an opportunity to actually live<br/>
learning and an opportunity to develope into the person they want to be, not<br/>
some pigeon hole that some *expert* decided would be best for him/her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019820691">Have her make instant mashed potatoes, using the measurements for a single serving, but making enough for your family.  Double some recipe, or cut it in half.  Cut a pie or cake into slices - more or less than you need, and discuss the relative size of each piece as you have more or less pieces.  Use a smaller measuring spoon than required, and figure out how many of them you should use now.  (like using a half-teaspoon spoon to measure 1 tablespoon&#39;s worth).  Use the 1/4 cup measure to get your 2.75 cups of flour.  I&#39;d advise letting them mark down how many they&#39;ve already put in, or you&#39;re likely to end up with very interesting creations!<br/>
<br/>
Does this help?<br/>
<br/>
Rather than asking her questions, like the egg thing (that is too much like &quot;school&quot;), concentrate on hearing hers, and ANSWER them, or look them up together until they learn to find out on their own.<br/>

Did she want to homeschool?<br/>

-=- I plan to go somewhere I<br/>
find interesting every week (with 2yo) museums, zoos,<br/>
cultural festivals, etc.  Grace (13) may go to humor<br/>
me, or sometimes she may even give me a hard time<br/>
about it (and I will let her stay home.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Will it help to have her pick some places?  And you could go some places that <br/>
are for Grace&#39;s benefit, not the 2 year old&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s new to homeschooling, she probably has the school-trained habit of <br/>
being embarrassed to be with her mom, and it might take a while to get over <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
Puberty does change what kids are willing to do.  Even trip to the mall <br/>
during school hours (so she won&#39;t see other school-age girls there without <br/>
moms) with the baby in a stroller so she might fall asleep and give you more <br/>
time with the older girl might be good for some conversation and some calming.<br/>
<br/>
Being out breaks the patterns which develop at home, though.  <br/>

te things she liked (ie: art & videography) and bad in<br/>
somethings she started school likeing (liked &<br/>
excelled in math, but began to hate it - won awards<br/>
for writing (not pennmanship)in 2nd/3rd grade, began<br/>
to hate & fail it by 6th grade - she&#39;s very athletic,<br/>
but failed gymn for talking, etc.) She prefers<br/>
homeschooling to ps (she says she may want to return<br/>
next year for hs - this is another concern, if she<br/>
didn&#39;t think of returning it would not matter where<br/>
she was in relation to peers - but if she plans to<br/>
return she&#39;ll need to be at their level in order to go<br/>
into that grade. They do test returning homeschoolers<br/>

They&#39;re just places that are within my commuting<br/>
distance. Grace may be interested in going to NYC<br/>
museums. I don&#39;t go to NYC, although I suppose we<br/>
could figure out some way (I don&#39;t like public<br/>
transportation and I won&#39;t drive it either.) Most of<br/>
the things I offer will seem boring to her because<br/>
I&#39;ve made the mistake? of allowing her to visit her<br/>
sister in Manhattan quite frequently over the summer.<br/>
(I don&#39;t think her sister would take her to museums<br/>
-she would say she would, but it would never get<br/>
done.)<br/>

&gt; less than you need, and discuss the relative size of each piece as <br/>
&gt; you have more or less pieces.  Use a smaller measuring spoon than <br/>
&gt; required, and figure out how many of them you should use now.  (like <br/>
&gt; using a half-teaspoon spoon to measure 1 tablespoon&#39;s worth).  Use <br/>
&gt; the 1/4 cup measure to get your 2.75 cups of flour.  I&#39;d advise <br/>
&gt; letting them mark down how many they&#39;ve already put in, or you&#39;re <br/>

 </span></blockquote>To me, this is just like school - it&#39;s creating false problems for the<br/>
sole purpose of &quot;teaching&quot;. Why would anyone use the measurements for a<br/>
single serving and adjust to make potatoes for a crowd, when the<br/>
measurements for 4 and 6 servings are right on the box?  I suppose a kid<br/>
might be interested in it as sort of a puzzle - &quot;Are the proporions<br/>
constant?&quot;- but generally my kid would consider it a waste of time. <br/>

We have used a 1/4 cup measure to measure 2.75 cups of flour, but only<br/>
when all of the other cup measures were greasy and buried under a load of<br/>
dirty dishes. I can&#39;t see doing it on purpose, it was pretty inefficient.<br/>
 When you cook by yourself, do you measure that way? <br/>

I use a 1/4 cup sugar scoop for my pots of tea, but for a while it was lost, <br/>
so I had a 1/3 cup measure in there.  I&#39;m in my 40&#39;s.  I thought really hard <br/>
(by visuals, not by forumals to think how much of 1/3 was 1/4, and figured <br/>
out it must be 2/3 of 1/3, so there it is.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I measure cups of flour I count backwards, because counting forward I <br/>
lose track.  So I&#39;ll count 6, 5, 4, etc.  I do that dealing cards, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338586623">There&#39;s a line in the editorial of the new LINK newspaper that came yesterday <br/>
that struck me in light of this conversation:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Homeschooling is not a verb.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that applies even more to &quot;unschooling&quot;. It&#39;s not something you do, <br/>
or that someone else can tell you step by step how to do. <br/>
<br/>
Bummer, huh?  :)<br/>
<br/>
In the specific, 13 is a hard time for a lot of kids. Big scary world out <br/>
there that they&#39;re just dying to get into, except when they&#39;re not. Flip flop <br/>
emotions. Who the heck am I anyway? Some might just jump right into a &quot;new <br/>
