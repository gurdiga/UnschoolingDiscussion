<div id="ygrps-yiv-821690825">Our Brittany had puppies last night. It was incredible!<br/>
There was 5 in all. I thought one had passed away but it was just delayed in <br/>
the canal. I was just getting ready to reach up and pull it out thinking it <br/>
was gone and stuck. But a minute later she pushed him out.<br/>
I video taped most of it, sounds gross but it was just amazing!<br/>
My older two children watched a few being born. It was a long night as it all <br/>
began at 2am and ended at 5:38 am. I stayed up until 11am and took a short <br/>
nap. Hard to sleep listening to them im so afraid she will lay on them but so <br/>
far so good.<br/>
<br/>
She had 4 boys and 1 girl. The girl was the smallest and the most white. I <br/>
have three &quot;girl&quot; wants on my list so im going in order of who requested first. <br/>
We already have one we have temp named tank as he was the first pup, fast to <br/>
latch and the biggest.<br/>
My son is asking to keep him..... <br/>
<br/>
So its been a long exciting day and my body aches from sitting in the <br/>
whelping box with her for hours. <br/>
Thanks for reading I am soo excited. BUT glad I only have one as it was a <br/>
long night for her also.<br/>
