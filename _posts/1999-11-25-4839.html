                            November 25, 1999<br/>
<br/>
Dear friends �<br/>
<br/>
Most of you who know me from homeschooling circles, Quaker or<br/>
interreligious service work, or are just plain ol� friends, have heard<br/>
me wax eloquent about the work of my adopted Indian parents in the far<br/>
south of India in the state of Tamil Nadu � S. and Krishnamal<br/>
Jaganathan. I apologize in advance for this appeal but, as I hope you<br/>
will see, it is heartfelt and much needed.<br/>
<br/>
My father is now 89, mother 73 � they have worked uninterruptedly as<br/>
Gandhian land reform organizers, trying to bring land to the landless<br/>
poor, for some 50 years.  And after about 30 years, their work began to<br/>
bear fruit. Through an inventive combination of loans, nonviolent action<br/>
(to get government land ceiling laws enforced), friendly persuasion, and<br/>
just plain hard work, through their organization Land for the Tillers<br/>
Freedom, they have helped 11,000 agricultural families come to own their<br/>
own land � most of whom had been landless for more than 40 generations.<br/>
The land is held either in cooperatives, or by women (the men have been<br/>
known to sell it to pay for drink), provides for the basic needs of<br/>
their families, with enough left over to support small cottage<br/>
industries.  I have visited regularly since 1977 and, quite frankly, it<br/>
is a miracle!  They have been nominated for the International Right<br/>
Livelihood Award, and Women�s World Summit Foundation in Switzerland<br/>
just gave my mother their prize for �Women�s Creativity in Rural Life�,<br/>
calling her �a Gandhian Joan of Arc�.  Whenever I am there, I get<br/>
introduced to all my �relatives�, as she is considered mother by all.<br/>
<br/>
In the last 3 years, they have had to fight another battle (their lives<br/>
almost sound Biblical in proportion!) � against multinational<br/>
corporations who had set up prawn farms that were destroying the coastal<br/>
ecology, salinating and polluting the soil, destroying the mangroves<br/>
protecting against the cyclone winds.  My father�s case ended up in the<br/>
Indian Supreme Court � he and his one lawyer against 116 lawyers<br/>
representing the multinationals.  He won � the Supreme Court ordered all<br/>
the prawn farms in fragile coastal areas closed -- but quite literally<br/>
lost his eyes in the process.  The government threatened to pass a law<br/>
overturning the Supreme Court order, while he was having an eye<br/>
operation.  He signed himself out of post-operative recovery 10 days<br/>
early, traveled 2,000 miles via train in 110 degree summer heat, and set<br/>
up a fast at the Gandhi Memorial in New Delhi.  The government backed<br/>
down, but his eyes never recovered.  And this year, after a series of<br/>
nonviolent actions and fasts involving thousands of people, he got the<br/>
order enforced, at least in the district where their land reform<br/>
activities havetaken place.  I have come to learn that when my father<br/>
acts as Don Quixote going up against the windmill, I wouldn�t bet on the<br/>
windmill!<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of all of this, my mother also collects stray children.<br/>
Literally.  She picks them off garbage heaps, roaming the streets,<br/>
begging in bus stations.  (A boy I personally  support was found hanging<br/>
from a tree by one foot, placed there by an abusive father.) She now has<br/>
120 of them, (46 at my �home�) who she feeds, clothes, houses, sends to<br/>
school, and finds what love she can for them.  We�ve managed to find<br/>
families in Italy to �adopt� them and pay for their expenses. Last year<br/>
when I was in India, I raised money (my own and some friends) to deepen<br/>
the well next to the house, so the kids could plant 200 new coconut and<br/>
papaya trees � they help plant and harvest rice, care for six<br/>
milk-giving cows and water buffaloes, and grow vegetables (all in<br/>
addition to their school work), so they can help feed themselves.  My<br/>
mother and father live simply (on around $70 a month) � since 1939, my<br/>
father has spun the cotton for every article of clothing he has worn<br/>
(luckily, he doesn�t need much clothing). So their own needs are<br/>
minimal.<br/>
<br/>
But we have a need, and that�s why I am appealing for help.  The 11,000<br/>
families now have land, but their houses are made of mud and straw, and<br/>
when the cyclones come (as they did north of them this year), the houses<br/>
are virtually all destroyed.  They leak during the monsoon rains (which<br/>
happen twice year), and the kids end up sleeping on the wet ground. My<br/>
mother�s dream is to house them all decently, or more correctly, have<br/>
them house themselves.  She has a well-developed plan whereby she can<br/>
start a cottage industry making cinder blocks, sell enough of the blocks<br/>
on the open market to cover raw material costs, and have the people<br/>
build their own homes with the bricks they make themselves.  But she<br/>
(we!) need just under $5,500 for a brickmaking machine (and the people�s<br/>
ability to access loans is already too stretched by payments on the<br/>
land.)<br/>
<br/>
I have received sponsorship from the Gandhian Foundation, a 501(c)(3)<br/>
charitable organization based in New Jersey to receive funds for the<br/>
project (which I desperately want to get started after this year�s rice<br/>
harvest festival � the South Indian equivalent of Thanksgiving, around<br/>
January 20 � after the harvest, people are free to pursue cottage<br/>
industries, and build homes.  I plan to contribute significantly from<br/>
what income I make from my book (And the Skylark Sings with Me), and my<br/>
kids are counting their pennies, too.  THERE ARE NO ADMINISTRATIVE<br/>
EXPENSES RELATED TO THIS PROJECT.<br/>
<br/>
So, tax deductible donations (large and small) will be deeply, deeply<br/>
appreciated.  They should be made out to the Gandhian Foundation, and<br/>
mailed to me:<br/>

<br/>
I do hope you will seriously consider this appeal. Thanks very much<br/>
indeed, and have a joyful, prayerful, truly meaningful thanksgiving and<br/>
remembrance of what it means to live in a land where there truly is<br/>
enough for us all.<br/>
<br/>
(P.S.  If there are homeschoolers who want to know more about India,<br/>
etc. � we�d be happy to help � we might also be able to arrange for<br/>
Indian penpals -- though I can�t promise this for sure � you have to<br/>
remember, the kids we are supporting are just becoming literate in their<br/>
own languages, and most struggle with their English.)<br/>
