<div id="ygrps-yiv-364720481">Hi there! I&#39;m Keara, single WAHM to ds Tristan (2.5) and dd Isabel <br/>
(7 mos, my unassisted birthed babe!) We are unschooling already, i <br/>
suppose. :) When I was pregnant with my first child, i knew i would <br/>
be homeschooling. The idea of public or even private schools scared <br/>
the heck out of me. Plus it just doesn&#39;t seem right to stick a bunch <br/>
of kids in seats all day, forcing them to speak only when called <br/>
upon, learning what the teacher wants them to learn for only a <br/>
specified period of time, tests, etc. etc. So I planned on <br/>
homeschooling until i stumbled upon unschooling, and now I&#39;m really <br/>
happy! I wonder what my life would have been like had i been <br/>
unschooled...<br/>
<br/>
We are a vegan, unschooling, cloth diapering, non-vaxing, co-<br/>
sleeping, breastfeeding family. Whew! LOL  Actually, I don&#39;t know <br/>
how I turned out this way...I wonder if I was raised the way I <br/>
parent MY children, would I be a conservative yuppie CIO mother <br/>
now?? Hmmmmmm...I guess I&#39;ll have to wait and see how my children <br/>
choose to parent!<br/>
<br/>
I am starting a new magazine, premiering in February. It&#39;s called <br/>
Pandora&#39;s Box &quot;Parenting Outside The Box&quot; In every issue, it&#39;ll have <br/>
unassisted childbirth stories, homeschool/unschool articles, veggie <br/>
stuff, a cloth diapering column, and attachment <br/>
parenting/breastfeeding articles. If anyone is interested in writing <br/>
your unschooling experiences for the mag, I&#39;d love to hear from ya!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to learning a lot here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549790773">Hi Keara,<br/>
 <br/>
I have a friend, although I havn&#39;t met her in person yet, who just wrote an article for your mag.   <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck with the endeavor and welcome to the list!<br/>
 <br/>
My Keara (spelled Kyra) is/was just sitting on my lap.  She&#39;s 5 so she doesn&#39;t sit still very long.<br/>
 <br/>
Take Care,<br/>
