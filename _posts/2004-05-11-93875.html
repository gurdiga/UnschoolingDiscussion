  You know, I never thought of visiting local businesses.  I guess it&#39;s <br/>
  just out of my comfort zone, not visiting businesses but the busy-<br/>
  ness of the city.  What wonderful opportunities we must be missing.  <br/>
  I never would have thought of it just because I truly detest walking <br/>
  in my neighborhood.  There are SO many cars!<br/>
<br/>
  We live in Roseville, MI right where I-94 and I-696 meet.  We are <br/>
  surrounded by two expressways, one two lane busy road and one six <br/>
  lane divided highway.  Our lives are so fast paced that I spend my <br/>
  time trying to get away from the traffic.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe it&#39;s time for Mom to step out of her comfort zone and venture <br/>
  into the neighborhood.  Who knows?  Maybe we&#39;ll find something that <br/>
  we didn&#39;t know was there.  I&#39;m not too confident as there is no down <br/>
  town persay.  It&#39;s just a through way, but you never know unless you <br/>
  try, right?<br/>

  &gt; Going to the big department stores.  I found the city pretty <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407257212">No, we are between Detroit and Mt. Clemens.  I-696 runs east and <br/>
west.  It dead ends right by my house.  You either have to take I-94 <br/>
east or I-94 west.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish we were near Battle Creek compared to here.  It&#39;s great <br/>
there!  We just went to Grand Rapids a few weeks ago for an Odyssey <br/>
of the Mind competition.  I love it there too!<br/>
<br/>
If you look on your map, you will see Roseville east of Warren, south <br/>
of Mt. Clemens, west of St. Clair Shores and north of Detroit.<br/>
