<div id="ygrps-yiv-355030371">Well, my son and I slid right off the road today and went down a steep <br/>
embankment.  Of course, we landed in a nice deep swamp of mud and it froze <br/>
around us while waiting for the tow truck...neither of us is hurt, just <br/>
shook up as the truck almost went upside down on us!  Yes, we were both <br/>
wearing our seat belts, something I do not always do but did today!<br/>
<br/>
I am sore and just thankful that is all that is wrong.  The truck running <br/>
board on my son&#39;s side will need work along with the mirror on his side but <br/>
other than that, there is not much damage!  You should see the hole we made <br/>
in the muck.  Took out some small trees too.<br/>
<br/>
Mathieu is still talking about it and will for some time yet.<br/>

Too often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve.<br/>
