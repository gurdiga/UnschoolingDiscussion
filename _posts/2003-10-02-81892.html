&gt; &gt; In my personal opinion, the large majority of persons who want &quot;tests, <br/>
&gt; &gt; ect&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; are ex-professional teachers who have taught in an actual &quot;school&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; environment,<br/>
&gt; &gt; such as a public school or a private school, or has gone through <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;teaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; college&quot; and earned teaching credentials to actually &quot;teach&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my experience it is the opposite. Those who have taught are often <br/>
&gt; ready and willing to embrace alternative ways - they KNOW what a wasted <br/>
&gt; effort preparing for tests is.<br/>

<br/>
Hard to generalize, but easy to refute a definite statement with lots of <br/>
exceptions! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My experience is Pam&#39;s too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One big advantage that teachers do have when unschooling with our own <br/>
families -- complete confidence that there isn&#39;t some secret handshake or <br/>
other important key to a successful life that our children can only receive <br/>
through schooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just as with any group of the population, some teachers are analytical, <br/>
verbal, thoughtful and maybe perfectionist and anal.   And some are robotic, <br/>
inflexible, dim, and maybe perfectionist and anal.  Then there are all points of the <br/>
spectrum between.<br/>
<br/>
Many times people have come saying &quot;Well I&#39;m a teacher, so it&#39;s going to be <br/>
difficult for me to get over my need to make lessons and charts and tests.&quot;  <br/>
I&#39;ve just said I was a teacher, and I never had that need.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it helps them or not, I&#39;m just not willing to let them generalize <br/>
their a-flitter insistence that teachers will find it hard to unschool.  Some of <br/>
the best unschoolers I&#39;ve known used to be teachers and are embarrassed or <br/>
ashamed of things they were forced to do, and of their contribution to &quot;the <br/>
system.&quot;  Another batch of the best unschoolers I&#39;ve noticed are people who really <br/>
never liked school in the first place and stopped really cooperating when they <br/>
were twelve or so.  Interesting that those two groups have produced lots of <br/>
great unschoolers.  And lots of unschoolers report having been A students, <br/>
honors students, scholarship students, and then one day they looked back over <br/>
their shoulders and saw it for the facade it was, and didn&#39;t want to run their <br/>
kids on that course.  For one thing, it&#39;s risky.  One horse wins; the rest are <br/>
losers.  And the winners?  Do they get better food?  Their owners and jockeys <br/>
get paid, they go back to the stall.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve seen a rash of those bumper stickers lately about &quot;my child was caught <br/>
being good&quot; and &quot;...honor student.&quot;   A kid does well in school, gets a good <br/>
mark on a little piece of paper (an &quot;A&quot; or a &quot;VG&quot; or an &quot;E&quot; or something which <br/>
has no intrinsic value) and their parents might get a bumper sticker.   I took <br/>
psychology classes in the operant-conditioning days, early 70&#39;s, and we <br/>
taught rats to &quot;bar-press&quot; for food pellets.   Some of the pushed the bar five <br/>
times, then food came out.  Some pressed ten.  That kind of conditioning is out of <br/>
style among psychologists, but damned if they&#39;re not still doing it in <br/>
schools in Albuquerque, for A&#39;s and bumper stickers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And this would be me. Graduated in the top ten in my class. <br/>
Don&#39;t remember what I learned in history, but remembered <br/>
everything to the tee from my after school work in the theater. I <br/>
can teach theater as an adult but can&#39;t tell you almost anything <br/>
about history (what I now know is from historical fiction and good <br/>
movies). Unschooling seemed to make sesnse of my <br/>
experienceÂ—that learning isn&#39;t what school was about. <br/>
Performing is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My grad school professor said something profound during week <br/>
one. He said school is designed to reward those who can get <br/>
through without ever making a mistake. We hold up the ones <br/>
who got perfect scores, who memorized facts and ideas that <br/>
someone else learned and taught. He said, &quot;That&#39;s not learning. <br/>
That&#39;s surviving. That&#39;s holding back and never risking. But <br/>
learning doesn&#39;t happen until you risk and fail and discover <br/>
another way. And unfortunately, that can&#39;t happen in school since <br/>
each future component depends on near-perfect scores in the <br/>
previous segment.&quot;<br/>
