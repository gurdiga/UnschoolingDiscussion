<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329316035">RE working for yourself vs. working for someone else:<br/>
<br/>
I dread the idea of a job that takes over my house and home (I work outside <br/>
the home)-- I like my job in another place, where I can leave it. I know <br/>
that&#39;s a luxury, because my husband, who has a home-based business, always <br/>
seems to be working. The phone rings for him at night, on weekends, during <br/>
meals, etc. He claims he has to answer the calls right away because <br/>
otherwise clients might go to someone else. But I always let the answering <br/>
machine get it if I&#39;m home.<br/>
<br/>
I read recently that some of the Amish have conceded to use telephones, but <br/>
they keep them in booths out in the fields, so they don&#39;t interrupt their <br/>
family lives. That sounded like a great idea to me. I get so tired of phone <br/>
interruptions.<br/>
<br/>
