<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160107775">Here is something I received from another list.  I though it was interesting enough to share with everyone here.  I cut and pasted everything below this line from the other list.<br/>

MIT had a story highlighting their latest &quot;MacArthur genius award winner,&quot; who happens to be the youngest of this year&#39;s crop of MacArthurs--and he&#39;s a 22-year-old MIT asst. professor who homeschooled in a very unorthodox way which led to pathbreaking research in a field called &quot;computation origami.&quot;  So cool, so beautiful...and lots of potential practical applications too (including molecular geometry.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the latest story about the MacArthur grant:<br/>

and, for background, here&#39;s more details about his unorthodox and fascinating homeschooling background:<br/>

I really liked this second article, originally in the Boston Globe. <br/>

Quotes:<br/>
&quot;Raised among hippies and jugglers and free thinkers, Erik Demaine has found himself at the center of a field where abstract math somehow intersects with street performance. That he is a prodigy is not even a question, say people who have worked with him; the question is what will amuse him. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;We would go to a museum,&#39;&#39; Demaine said. &#39;&#39;Anything he pointed to or mentioned, I&#39;d go to the library and find a book and leave it on the table. Sometimes after three days the books would disappear.&#39;&#39; <br/>
