Basically the concensus was, if you don&#39;t like that person&#39;s posting <br/>
style, then delete their messages.<br/>
<br/>
If that person is calling you names or being prejudicial or derogatory.. <br/>
thats another story.<br/>

working on it!) so if someone says something with my name in the post <br/>
I read it first.  Of course if there&#39;s more than one Cindy, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
help as much!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
