When I found this link, it let me know how school isn&#39;t the only way <br/>
to learn. The introduction reminded me of Grace Llewellyn&#39;s writing <br/>
style, with a little of John Taylor Gatto and John Holt. It&#39;s a <br/>
place for unschoolers and people who are interested in informing <br/>
others about unschooling.</div>
