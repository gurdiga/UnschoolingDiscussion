<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002318382">I&#39;ve been following the Ned or No-Ned thread.  He&#39;s got his good points, <br/>
but his carpet bombing of this list almost drove me to unsub.  Actually, <br/>
I just went on digest and any time I saw he was the predominant poster I <br/>
would just delete the entire digest.  The whole thing went on ad <br/>
nauseum, and I know that from the length of time he was allowed to post <br/>
his diatribes  that he was given ample opportunity to ease up, but he <br/>
didn&#39;t.  It all just got very tiresome and -- booorrring.  I&#39;m really <br/>
quite glad that he&#39;s moved on to other lists now -- voluntarily or <br/>
involuntarily.      <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t view banning as censorhip -- though I guess one could argue that <br/>
it is in the strictist sense.   One&#39;s own rights end where other&#39;s <br/>
begin.  If we were all out in a public park having a circle discussion <br/>
and some person came right in the middle of our circle and started <br/>
yelling and screaming about things that were not on topic -- would that <br/>
be censorhip if we asked that person to please pipe down and allow <br/>
everyone to speak?  Would it be censorship if the discussion leader <br/>
asked that person to please stay on topic if they decided to <br/>
participate?   Wouldn&#39;t the screamer be censoring the speech of others <br/>
if he continually yelled while they were trying to have their <br/>
discussion?  The right of  free speech does not also carry the right to <br/>
disturb and disrupt.  <br/>
