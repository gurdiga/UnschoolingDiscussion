&gt; What does legally organized mean?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know of a whole bunch of folks getting together to do all kinds of things.<br/>
&gt; I have a friend offering lessons in Spanish to hsing families in my<br/>
&gt; community.  I haven&#39;t a clue how she would *organize legally*?<br/>

Lisa by legal organzation I&#39;m refering the &quot;co-operatives&quot; as opposed to<br/>
&quot;corporations&quot; and more permanent than most &quot;homeschool support groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cooperatives have been around since the organization of Rochdale<br/>
Cooperatives in England in the mid 1800&#39;s.  The best known use in the USA<br/>
has been the food co-ops of the 1960.  Before that were the producer co-ops<br/>
of the 1920s.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve been trying to explore is the use of legal cooperatives to extend<br/>
the life of &quot;homeschool support groups.&quot;  And to give them more clout. In<br/>
the &quot;New Chapters&quot; section of the online book on<br/>
&lt;http://www.CreatingLearningCommunities.org&quot; there is a good chapter by<br/>
Laddie Lushin, a co-op lawyer, who gives some pointers on if, why, and how<br/>
to organize a &quot;learning co-op.&quot; Lushin has been working with local food<br/>
co-op for 25 years and is considering giving his prim attention to helping<br/>
self-learners establish learning co-ops.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of listservs on co-operatives both here and in England as<br/>
well as a number of publications for co-ops.  To date I&#39;ve found only a fes<br/>
examples of homeschoolers or other collaborative learners taking advantage<br/>
of the co-op movement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426139579">Lisa, most of your questions have been answered in &quot;Creating Learning <br/>
Communities&quot; by people more expert in the co-operative movement than I.<br/>
But, by creating permanent cooperative of homeschoolers and other<br/>
autodidacts there will be organizations to purchase equipment, rent meeting<br/>
rooms, and pass on the the next generation of homeschoolers the facilities<br/>
and services they need or want.<br/>
<br/>
We have a cooperatgive preschool learning center in my hometown on which my<br/>
wife is a board member.  The parents own their own building, playground,<br/>
books, computers and equipment.<br/>
<br/>
They hire a program coordinator and each parent puts in a number of hours a<br/>
week working in the learning center.  Parents of participating learners<br/>
elect the board with one or two outside the current active participants.  A<br/>
similar learning center for homescoolers is being considered. So far the<br/>
group has a telescope, microsopes, and computers that will stay with the<br/>
learning co-op for the next bunch of unchoolers that come along.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the day to day operation Learning Co-ops can have more clout with<br/>
banks, businesses, donors, and government than can a single homeschooler or<br/>
even an ad hoc homeschool support group.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lisa, I am guessing that your kids are still young. Its really easy to find <br/>
fun, interesting things to do without a lot of money or planning. You can <br/>
throw together great learning activities for young children. When they get a <br/>
little older, the co-op can do so much more that is difficult to do without <br/>
more structure.<br/>
<br/>
We have had some wonderful classes that involve speakers and field experts <br/>
that would be difficult to schedule. We have access to materials that are <br/>
available to schools, but not always to homeschoolers just because they will <br/>
reach more children. We have gotten grants to pay for some classes and <br/>
materials. We have a permanant meeting place so long term commitments can be <br/>
made. One of my latest thoughts is to try to get appoval to start drivers ed <br/>
classes at the center-in Ohio the kids have to attend a course through <br/>
school or a private driving school, so why not have a school program at the <br/>
center so we don&#39;t all have to pay $300 to the local driving school.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is alot easier for new homeschoolers to find the support they <br/>
need when you have a co-op like this too. They can jump right in to a <br/>
thriving community of homeschoolers instead of winging it on their own.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Center that we use is quite far from us, so we often do not get to <br/>
participate in many of the activities that interest us. I wish we could have <br/>
them in every community so that more of the wonderful opportunities were <br/>
available to every one who want to learn for life. Not just the hsers or <br/>
even just the kids.<br/>

homeschooled every year but 3rd grade.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;more structure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not talking about being able to meet the *learning* needs of the kids<br/>
here. I&#39;m asking for what purpose would some sort of legal sanction be<br/>
necessary.  And my teen did have access to some great resources and we<br/>
lacked a few at times.  It wasn&#39;t the structure we needed, it was just other<br/>
interested parties. Teens begin to have very specific needs and interests.<br/>
We didn&#39;t mesh with a whole lot of the other homeschoolers around here.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But did this take *clout* or just hard work by the group?   We&#39;re working on<br/>
some sort of permanent meeting place in my community, as that is our most<br/>
pressing need.  But we don&#39;t need clout, we just need money. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&gt;thriving community of homeschoolers instead of winging it on their own.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I sometimes think they substitute this for school and never spend the<br/>
downtime that is necessary during that first year. I think some families end<br/>
up delaying the deschooling process until they are burned out on<br/>
homeschooling activities.  Winging it a bit forces self-reliance... and<br/>
well...that&#39;s a pretty important step in the homeschooling journey.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  And I think we&#39;re moving that way, even though it&#39;s very slow.  I<br/>
just do not want the idea that homeschoolers *need* to do these things to be<br/>
legitimate to become prevelant.  I value my freedom too much to lose it to<br/>
the idea of needing a *legalized learning center* to make it work well.<br/>

I get the idea that the &quot;clout&quot; they&#39;re talking about has to do with getting <br/>
real estate loans and that type of deal--stuff nobody&#39;s going to do for a <br/>

<br/>
We paid over $200 for an insurance-sponsored, profit-driven &quot;driving <br/>
school&quot; in Louisiana -- typical, conventional week&#39;s worth of wasted <br/>
time.  They insisted that our son should be able to drive on the <br/>
road after six hours of instruction to some arbitrary standard (with <br/>
no other &quot;official&quot; road hours under his belt) -before- issuing a <br/>
learner&#39;s permit (you know, the one you get so you can learn how to <br/>
drive on the road?) and when he &quot;failed&quot; to meet their so-called <br/>
standard, they had the legal right (as a for-profit company offering <br/>
a state-mandated service) to require us to fork over ex-tra bucks <br/>
for ex-tra hours from their ex-pert driving instructor.  What a scam!<br/>
<br/>
Next time around -- No driver&#39;s ed course required in SC -- <br/>
autodidacts simply pass the written test, which includes some of the <br/>
drug & alcohol awareness info, and receive a learner&#39;s permit -- <br/>
then, proceed to learn to drive on the road under an adult, licensed <br/>
driver&#39;s supervision (you know, like the old days when your parents <br/>
sat by your side and took part in the process as a matter of course -<br/>
- white knuckles notwithstanding.)  Common sense and a lot of love <br/>
kept them in the passenger&#39;s seat till they were confident in our <br/>
ability to steer clear of trouble.  Those were the days, my friend...<br/>
<br/>
Here we are in FL -- mandated Traffic Law & Substance Abuse course, <br/>
reasonable priced (under $50) and even available in a convenient <br/>
online version.  Major problem -- the course content on substance <br/>
abuse is highly objectionable (nightmarish to those who have gone <br/>
through the trauma of losing loved ones to DUI) and in conflict with <br/>
our sincerely-held religious beliefs and educational philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
Have contacted the HSMV and State Representatives for information on <br/>
a waiver (for the objectionable part of the course, if not all), but <br/>
no go.  Our Senator&#39;s legislative assistant is still looking into <br/>
the matter... maybe.  Once we exhausted the obvious legal <br/>
alternatives, we decided to check out CompuHigh&#39;s offerings and drop <br/>
a line to Pat Montgomery at Clonlara.  Haven&#39;t received a response <br/>
in the past few weeks since our first inquiry, so plan to follow-up <br/>
in a week or so.  <br/>
<br/>
Will have to see if any of the umbrella schools/co-ops here in FL <br/>
have tackled this one already -- perhaps it&#39;s our turn to take the <br/>
wheel and formalize our relationship to the un/homeschooling <br/>
community by gearing driver&#39;s ed to individual needs.  <br/>
<br/>
IMHO, driving should never be tied into grades, attendance, or <br/>
anything else as a matter of privilege -- it should be recognized as <br/>
a marketable skill, and in some cases, an absolute necessity.  We <br/>
want all who are able to take the initiative to gain this skill <br/>
without compromising their values or welfare in the process.   <br/>
<br/>
Advice & suggestions welcome & encouraged!  Hasta luego, Amigos...<br/>
