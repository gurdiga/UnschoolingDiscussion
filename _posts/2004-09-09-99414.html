<div id="ygrps-yiv-996629273">***Mothers have thrown out older boys&#39; baseball card collections and comic books without asking them.****<br/>
<br/>
Okay� I see what you are saying.  My mother tends to buy things for DD with the idea that someday they may be worth something.  Then she gives them to her and expects her not to want to play with them.  I hate that.  Either keep it and save it for later when the kid may actually consider the idea that they can have something of value, or simply let the kid play with the stuff and if it has value later then so be it.  At least the child has the joy of playing with it rather than the torture of seeing a pretty/interesting item that they will be ashamed for desiring because it will make someone upset.  I don�t want to be my mother� lol.  <br/>
<br/>
***It&#39;s not as honest a question as it could be.***<br/>
<br/>
Okay� I obviously didn�t think it through.  How about this:  Am I wrong to ask DD to either store her things in her room, the attic, the garage, the basement, or a closet � as I store my things � and save the common areas (kitchen, dining room, and living room) from the clutter of boxes in all areas of the room that end up blocking sitting areas (chairs/couch) and walking paths?  And if that is wrong of me to ask, then what do I do - both physically and mentally?  Perhaps I should take some pics of my house and show you what I mean.  I don�t see how our house can be conducive to unschooling when you cannot sit anywhere to play, watch a video, sew, do a project, make cookies, make playdough cities, etc�  I&#39;m not the one making the area like that, and while I will pick up what I can, I can&#39;t do it all.  It&#39;s just physically impossible.  Even sitting to eat is a chore right now, as one usually has to clear off a chair or something to sit on.<br/>
<br/>
***But if the priorities in a home include respect and choices, then those questions answer themselves different from the traditional ways.**<br/>
<br/>
I wasn�t clear, obviously � and am doing poorly in asking the right questions.  I hope this is better:  How does one respect the need for a child to have their things, projects, etc�  and have the space for them while also respecting other children or adults space and things?  What ARE the choices?<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem seeking storage for my daughter�s things she wants to keep.  I just would like it to be stored somewhere other than the middle of the living room floor, the couch, or the kitchen counters.  <br/>

OH! I hate that too.  Like giving a little girl a Christmas Barbie and sayi=<br/>
ng <br/>
&quot;keep it in the box.&quot;  WRONG. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

and walking paths? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.  I just read it (wherever I read it) as adults could stor=<br/>
e things in <br/>
other places, but kids were limited to their rooms.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t see how our house can be conducive to unschooling when you <br/>
cannot sit anywhere to play, watch a video, sew, do a project, make cookies=<br/>
, <br/>

<br/>
There are days... yeah.<br/>
We have more room than we did when the kids were little, and that makes it =<br/>
<br/>
easier too.<br/>
But remember that many families aren&#39;t even wanting their kids to play, sew=<br/>
, <br/>
do a project, make cookies, etc.  They expect that the kids will get to do =<br/>
that <br/>
stuff at school.  So at home they&#39;re expected not to make a mess, just get =<br/>
<br/>
ready for school tomorrow.  If you&#39;re bored, mop the floor.  That kind of <br/>
traditional family might be expected to have  cleaner house than a family <br/>
PLANNING to do projects, make playdough cities, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We had a neighbor who wouldn&#39;t even let her daughter have water colors.  <br/>
&quot;You can do art at school.&quot;    I&#39;ve also heard &quot;They have books at school,&quot;=<br/>
 from <br/>
people who didn&#39;t want to own books or get bookshelves.    Makes me <br/>
shudder.<br/>

Have you been peeking in my windows? Don&#39;t forget the dining table - on or<br/>
