<div id="ygrps-yiv-533795696"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I can teach like they can sing.  So why am I saying teaching doesn&#39;t exist?  <br/>
&gt;&gt;Beginners need to stand up to sing.  Beginning teachers need to know that <br/>
&gt;teaching isn&#39;t a thing you do to someone else.  Rather, learning is something <br/>
&gt;that you MIGHT, if you&#39;re lucky, get to assist with.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well said, Sandra! This really expresses it. Now I see your purpose, if<br/>
you are talking about a way to help new unschoolers.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;In beginning stages, like student teachers and beginning homeschooling <br/>
&gt;parents and assistant karate teachers (which my son is) and games teachers <br/>
&gt;(Marty and Holly have both &quot;taught a game&quot; in the past couple of days, or <br/>
&gt;rather recited rules in the presence of other people) need to look for and <br/>
&gt;see learning as a separate process from their own song and dance. In advanced <br/>
&gt;stages there is teaching, but it is compassionately and competently <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;facilitating another&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;If a teacher lectures in the forest and nobody hears it...<br/>
&gt;If a teacher lectures in a classroom and nobody&#39;s actually listening...<br/>
&gt;If a teacher presents a lesson and everyone there already knows the <br/>
&gt;material...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is no teaching happening.<br/>
