<div id="ygrps-yiv-803216678">(was teens moving out)<br/>
I had to comment on what Nancy said in her last post about wondering <br/>
if others came to this way of life because of what happened to them. <br/>
I also moved out @ 17 and felt lost and alone with nowhere to go. It <br/>
was the worst feeling. Well I should clarify that I didn&#39;t move out <br/>
I was displaced because my sister went one way and my mom went the <br/>
other without any disregaurd for where I was going to go or live. I <br/>
remember my mom saying right before graduation saying welcome to the <br/>
real world - was this some kind of a sick joke I <br/>
thought ????????????????????????????????????????<br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough I now have a room down in my basement that we recently <br/>
spent $1,000 on to fix up just for her. She was displaced and needed <br/>
somewhere to stay while she finishe out her retirement before moving <br/>
back to her home in Florida. (Long story) It is ironic but my mother <br/>
alwyas told me what goes around comes around and you never know if <br/>
you might need your child someday not just your child needing you. I <br/>
thought I would just give a little food for thought. Thankfully I <br/>
have a WONDERFUL, SUPPORTING husband that knows how to do the right <br/>
thing despite the way my family has treated us over the past.<br/>
<br/>
Because that post isn&#39;t really about unschoolig I would like to also <br/>
add something that relates to the above mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
I plan on alwyas providing a roof over my childs head and I&#39;m glad <br/>
that I can unschool him to better prepare him for the real world in <br/>
the real world. Instead of saying okay now that your out of the <br/>
simulated world (out of prsion)go try your hand at the real world.<br/>
I always wondered how the hell people coul pick college when they <br/>
don&#39;t even know what they like because they haven&#39;t had the freedom <br/>
to pursue their hearts desires ??????????????<br/>

*****************<br/>
<br/>
I really struggled with this whole concept for a long time.  It took years for my mom and me to mend our relationship.  Now we are the best of friends.<br/>
<br/>
But I remember thinking I would never take her into my home.  I feel differently now of course, and I&#39;m glad.<br/>
<br/>
But those scars are pretty deep.<br/>
