<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177534198">Hi ladies.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, we are into week four and I need some support. So far, <br/>
lots of great kid interaction, we&#39;ve seen lots of movies, played <br/>
games, read books, gone ot the library and all that stuff. I feel <br/>
fine about our family life and I feel good about our decision to <br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where I need some perspective.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (15) is in Algebra II at the local high school. He is a <br/>
sharp kid (in all the ways I know him). He&#39;s taught himself guitar <br/>
(plays well for being at it 6 mos.) plays piano beautifully, reads <br/>
voraciously. He loves music and books and is really into the <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
Until now, he&#39;s always done well with math. He&#39;s taken a couple <br/>
of co-op clases (like biology and Algebra I) and came out with As <br/>
and Bs. <br/>
<br/>
But this is the public high school now. Not homeschool co-op. <br/>
He had an A- at midterm and now ended up with a C+ for his <br/>
final semester grade. He&#39;s studied a lot. I mean a lot. He goes in <br/>
for early morning help and has had a little tutoring too. He had a <br/>
97% on the homework but just isn&#39;t doing well with testing in <br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
This gnaws at me. It&#39;s what made me almost quit <br/>
homeschooling him. I felt like maybe he needed a bigger dose <br/>
of that kind of learning to overcome the test phobia and bugs. But <br/>
then I spent all of Christmas break reading and rethinking. I can&#39;t <br/>
bear the thought of putting this artistic, musically inclined kid into <br/>
the straight jacket of school.<br/>
<br/>
Yet he wants to go to college and we don&#39;t know how else to do it <br/>
with math (paying for math is out of reach for us and our co-op <br/>
didn&#39;t offer it this year). What have you all done about testing and <br/>
school habits (for college prep)? I don&#39;t want to stress over this. <br/>
But I find that I keep coming back to it in my head. Will he actually <br/>
be able to handle college? How will we know? Will this C+ from <br/>
a high school stand out as proof that homeschool hasn&#39;t <br/>
educated him enough when we apply to colleges? Am I <br/>
overcompensating in my head by saying he&#39;s actually smart <br/>
when really he isn&#39;t because the tests are proving it?<br/>
<br/>
What about those stories that hoemschooled kids would do <br/>
better than their peers in school? Is that propaganda?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need some options and some vision. Have your kids <br/>
taken four years of math for college prep? Does it matter if they <br/>
do? What do you think about being ready to operate in that <br/>
sphere at the point they choose to or want to? How do you <br/>
help/support them so they succeed?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Julie B</div>

hs or jr. college, these grades will tell them more than all of the <br/>
work he&#39;s done at home. :( He also said to KEEP everything, <br/>
including text books used (ugh), work completed and so on.<br/>

They are most interested in ACT or SAT scores. So far, he&#39;s done <br/>
well on ACT which relieved me some.<br/>

next year or two (after he&#39;s driving).<br/>
<br/>
We get some kind of discount if he goes to Xavier, but I am <br/>
willing for him to go elsewhere. he just has his heart set on it at <br/>
this point.<br/>

Yeah, well I sure hope you&#39;re right. he&#39;s only a sophomore, so I <br/>
suppose a lot can change between now and then.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It might depend on the university. I can only speak of English ones but I ditched maths at 16 and was accepted to do a neuroscience degree in London which was heavy on statistics. In fact, in their<br/>
brochure they stated that A levels (we do 3 at 18) required were Biology, Chemistry and another one. My A levels were English, Religious Studies and History. Bad grades too cos I went to the Glastonbury<br/>
Festival instead of revising for the exams.<br/>
Because I took two years off between High School and University they gave me an interview and were more interested in my attitude and interests than exam results from 2 years previously. English<br/>
universities can be quite flexible and some are more interested in the person than what bits of paper say. I&#39;ve heard some American ones are the same way.<br/>

department. The only thing Admissions is interested in is <br/>
numbers/stats/testing. Talk with someone who will have actual CONTACT with <br/>
your son. Have him start hanging out there on a regular basis. Go to whatever <br/>
&quot;fundays&quot; they host or whatever. Audit. Get &quot;KNOWN&quot;.  Go where the grad <br/>
students/TAs hang out. He&#39;ll be better off KNOWING the faculty of the school <br/>
he&#39;ll be attending than the lame admissions director (whose job ENDS after <br/>
the $$&#39;s in).<br/>
<br/>
The Head of the Department is who can waive requirements. No one else. If he <br/>
skows he&#39;s CAPABLE, that counts for way more than some test/texts/curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
Also check out other schools. Every school looks like THE one. Have him visit <br/>
many---especially ones that excel in what he&#39;s interested in.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yet he wants to go to college and we don&#39;t know how else to do it <br/>
with math (paying for math is out of reach for us and our co-op <br/>
didn&#39;t offer it this year). What have you all done about testing and <br/>
school habits (for college prep)? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people go to college having not taken much math, or having taken it <br/>
in high school and not really understood it.  Lots of people unschooled, <br/>
never took a class, and see it for the first time, formally taught, in <br/>
college.<br/>
<br/>
The people I&#39;ve talked to did NOTHING about prepping school habits.  Often a <br/>
good unschooling life is better college prep than anything else, because the <br/>
kids know that what they learn THEY learn, they can&#39;t wait for the teacher to <br/>
tell them.<br/>
<br/>
They take the ACT or SAT or whatever, and just go.<br/>
<br/>
Test taking can be practiced by just speed trials of problems in the book, <br/>
maybe, but does he REALLY need to practice test taking?<br/>
<br/>
Does he need an A or B in this class?<br/>
<br/>
Is he there for the learning or for the grade?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Will he actually be able to handle college? How will we know?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Was he actually able to ride a bicycle?<br/>
How did you know?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Will this C+ from <br/>
a high school stand out as proof that homeschool hasn&#39;t <br/>
educated him enough when we apply to colleges? Am I <br/>
overcompensating in my head by saying he&#39;s actually smart <br/>
when really he isn&#39;t because the tests are proving it?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THIS IS SCARY.<br/>
This is not an unschooling attitide, if you&#39;re thinking that tests scores <br/>
prove or disprove &quot;smart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
What about those stories that hoemschooled kids would do <br/>
better than their peers in school? Is that propaganda?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is and would be impossible for ALL homeschooled kids to do better or for <br/>
ALL to do worse.  Each kid&#39;s an individual.  Did you get a homeschooled <br/>
guarantee?  I sure as hell did not.<br/>
<br/>
You would be feeling better about your son right now if he hadn&#39;t taken that <br/>
class, it seems.  If that&#39;s true, I think it was a mistake for him to take <br/>
the class.  But you weren&#39;t unschooling when he first signed up in there, <br/>
right?  (Correct me if I&#39;m wrong.)<br/>
<br/>
You wrote earlier in the month:<br/>
-=-Middle child looks appalled. &quot;How can we still learn math if we <br/>
don&#39;t do it every day? How will we be ready for high school or <br/>
college?&quot; (I can see I&#39;ve instilled that thinking thoroughly.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe some kids can&#39;t learn math if they *DO* &quot;do it every day,&quot; <br/>
because it becomes a thing separate from real uses.<br/>
Why would unschooled kids need to be &quot;ready for high school&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Have your kids taken four years of math for college prep? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised you would honestly ask unschoolers that.  NO.<br/>
<br/>
Did you take four years of math before you went to college?  New Mexico <br/>
requires two.  I took ONE.  I got a degree at 21.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there someone there who could dash cold water on you maybe?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What do you think about being ready to operate in that <br/>
sphere at the point they choose to or want to?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they want to and they don&#39;t feel ready they will find a way to GET ready, <br/>
just as they&#39;ve done with every other project or plan along the way.<br/>
<br/>
How old is your school-attending son?<br/>

interesting that might also on the side involve math (photography? <br/>

<br/>
But, having a Jr in high school myself, I know where your coming from.  ( <br/>
although I dont homeschool him)  My understanding is that grade transcripts ( <br/>
from high school or home school) along with SAT scores are a BIG <br/>
consideration in college acceptance.  Extracurriulcar activiites  (or <br/>
community involvement ) and essays are also a big  determinant to being <br/>
accepted into college.   So, if he wants to score decently on his SATS, he <br/>
will need to learn the math.   800 being a perfect score in math, I think a <br/>
500 would be decent, but certainly not outstanding.   A lot probably depends <br/>
on where he wants to go to college and what he wants to study.  Maybe check <br/>
out some college requirements from some colleges hes interested in.<br/>

Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I think this is especially good advice considering that Xavier is a<br/>
relatively small school.  I imagine the Jesuit tradition would initially<br/>
frown on unschooling....until they came to understand it, which they may<br/>
or may noe be willing to do.  But most math departments heads would give<br/>
their eye teeth to have a really interested student over those who are<br/>
there for the degree and the &quot;success&quot; they believe that paper will<br/>
bring them.<br/>
<br/>
You said Noah gets 97% on his homework.....I imagine his understanding<br/>
of math is fine.  And I do believe if this is his area of interest, he<br/>
will be able to do well.<br/>

learned, Colleges look at Jr -Sr grades, test scores, etc much closer than <br/>
Freshmen/ Soph.   ( at least I HOPE SO!.. Landon pretty much scrapped 9th and <br/>
10th grade)..   So, dont despair, if he really wants to go to college, its <br/>
VERY feasible that he can go to the college of his choice<br/>

hard.<br/>
<br/>
Remember you said that simply lifting controls without a gradual <br/>
process can be too overwhelming for kids? Well same with <br/>
dumping old thinking. it helps me to replace it with something I <br/>
can hang onto. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had no troulbe embracing unschooling with younger kids. <br/>
But I&#39;ve been deeply impacted by the idea or college and that&#39;s <br/>
the one I am working through now.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If you care more about what someone at school said one <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone else&#39;s school, you should put your kids in school.<br/>

needlessly harsh. What about saying, &quot;Julie, some of us went <br/>
through that and hung on and got to the other side. You can too&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, am I bugging you? I have appreciated all the replies I&#39;ve <br/>
rec&#39;d in this group to date. That&#39;s why I&#39;m still here. Your last two <br/>
emails mystify me. I guess I thought that part of getting out of the <br/>
other mindset is being able to talk about it and get new <br/>
information to replace the old. You&#39;ve been incredibly helpful  and <br/>
yet now I get the distinct impression that I am annoying you. <br/>
Would you rather me post these questions somewhere else?<br/>
<br/>
Or am I misreading you? Email can be tricky that way. I hope I&#39;ve <br/>
just misperceived your tone. So far I&#39;ve been taking your <br/>
comments with good humor. But this last one (&quot;I&#39;m trying to be <br/>
gentle&quot;) made me think: Wow, she actually wants to land on me <br/>
and is holding back!<br/>
<br/>
Ouch!<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that if one of my kids was asking questions that I <br/>
felt had obvious answers, I&#39;d still want to be gentle and help <br/>
them to move forward in the thinking. So I come here with the <br/>
same expectation. Let me know if I&#39;ve got it wrong. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
be guilty of derailing the purpose of this group with my inquiries, <br/>
if they are considered really off topic.<br/>

If it&#39;s just calculation mistakes, it&#39;s just a matter of him being more<br/>
careful and perhaps double and triple checking his work before moving on to<br/>
the next problem. You say he&#39;s doing well with his homework so that leads me<br/>
to think that he IS understanding the work. Maybe he just has to get the<br/>
hang of taking tests - maybe he doesn&#39;t like the feeling of being under<br/>
pressure and having limited time. I think that in time, he could work at<br/>
being a better &quot;test taker&quot; if that&#39;s what the problem is. Maybe even<br/>
practice taking tests at home in a more relaxed environment?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a &quot;C&quot; grade is so bad, either. That&#39;s just average - it&#39;s not<br/>
bad. My husband has his associates degree in computer-something, bachelors<br/>
in business, and masters in computer science. He just scraped by on math and<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a &quot;math&quot; head, but still is a whiz with computers, both the<br/>
hardware and software and has a great job. Don&#39;t let this initial school<br/>
experience get you or your son down. Keep at it if it&#39;s his goal and what he<br/>

  DISCLAIMER.. I could ALWAYS be wrong<br/>
<br/>
  But, having a Jr in high school myself, I know where your coming from.  ( <br/>
  although I dont homeschool him)  My understanding is that grade transcripts ( <br/>
  from high school or home school) along with SAT scores are a BIG <br/>
  consideration in college acceptance.  Extracurriulcar activiites  (or <br/>
  community involvement ) and essays are also a big  determinant to being <br/>
  accepted into college.   So, if he wants to score decently on his SATS, he <br/>
  will need to learn the math.   800 being a perfect score in math, I think a <br/>
  500 would be decent, but certainly not outstanding.   A lot probably depends <br/>
  on where he wants to go to college and what he wants to study.  Maybe check <br/>
  out some college requirements from some colleges hes interested in.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979758032">Duh! I want you to encourage me not to worry about it and tell me <br/>
  why. Why would I ask here otherwise? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Ok here&#39;s why:<br/>
<br/>
  I can take any test and pass it with flying colors.  ANY test.  I don&#39;t need to know the content.  I&#39;ve DONE it on several occasions.<br/>
<br/>
  I did NOT know the content.  One was the analysis of literature CLEP worth 6 points.  I saved myself about 1800 dollars by taking that exam and got the equivalent of a B on it....and I knew NOTHING about analysis of literature.  I didn&#39;t even study.<br/>
<br/>
  I took and passed both the CCRN (Critical care registered nurse) exam and the state paramedic exam.  I didn&#39;t spend one iota of time studying for EITHER of them.<br/>
<br/>
  Several of my friends with WAY more experience and knowledge than I had failed those tests over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
  Tests do not measure ANYTHING except &quot;how to take a test&quot;.  Many many good profs/teachers know that.  They are the ones you want to work with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985396649">One more thing Julie...this is now the &quot;networking&quot; age.<br/>
<br/>
Its not about WHAT you know.  Its about WHO you know.  If you work on &quot;who&quot; you know you&#39;ll find people who understand that a love of learning with a lack of expertise is a whole lot better than no love of learning with minimal expertise (public school grads)<br/>
<br/>
If your child is networking, he&#39;ll get where he needs to be.  It might not be at the college of his choice, but thats not a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
There are hidden blessings in having to look elsewhere to get what you need without conforming to someone else&#39;s agenda and expectations.<br/>
<br/>
ok now someone remind me I said this when I start panicking!!<br/>

I can&#39;t believe you think I am asking for support in school. I am <br/>
asking what to do about it. And I hoped that the help I&#39;d get would <br/>
strengthen my conviction that unschooling will indeed work even <br/>
for college, even with this current class situation.<br/>
<br/>
So far, that was the help I have rec&#39;d. And I appreciate it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233482968">One brother just got a job working for the state,  entry level,  worked his way up and found his niche,   he struggled through high school and started working for the state at 18,  he&#39;s now 42.<br/>
 <br/>
My other brother also struggled through high school.  He took a few courses at a university, while working an entry level position at a hospital, became a respitory therapist.   He then worked with some docs as a respitory therapist and told them of some ideas he had for improving some of their devices.   He designed a hand held device that moniters gases an individual inhales and exhales,   the old model the docs were using was about the size of refridgerator.     <br/>
 <br/>
 Anyway, they  got some rich guy to back it and they are trying to produce them,  its been a very hard road.   Meanwhile,  he&#39;s had to earn a living,  he met people at GE when he was promoting his product.   They were impressed with his knowledge,  not his degrees, which he has none.     Hired him to do trouble shooting with different projects that the accredited engineers can&#39;t figure out.  He&#39;s now 47.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m very proud of both of them. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if this helps with your husband.    I bet if your husband was able to get into any type of job with a somewhat  sizeable company he could show them his knowledge and he would be an asset to the company.      <br/>

been home his whole life. This is a total change for us (using the <br/>
school system for anything) and I don&#39;t like it!<br/>
<br/>
Btw, even in the TLHB by Grace Llwellyn, there are examples of <br/>
using schools as a resource for classes of interest. That was <br/>
one of the places we even heard of the idea.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s been harder on me than I thought it would be. So I was <br/>
hoping for support (which I&#39;ve gotten) about how to interpret the <br/>
results. That&#39;s what I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
And we don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll do next year.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, we are unschooling as far as I can tell based on the <br/>
definitions here.<br/>
