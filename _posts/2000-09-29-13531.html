Some excerpts:<br/>
<br/>
     Federal laws have been passed to allow the military to provide<br/>
transportation for Scouts and to loan them equipment without charge. Every<br/>
national Boy Scout jamboree since 1981 has been held on a military base. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many local councils receive substantial funding from the United Way. Such<br/>
United Ways have a national and local policy of not ordinarily funding any<br/>
charitable organization which discriminates on a basis of a religious test<br/>
or a sexual orientation test. Many United Ways have stopped funding the Boy<br/>
Scouts.  However, many still continue such funding.<br/>
<br/>
San Diego CA: The American Civil Liberties Union and the Tom Homann Law<br/>
Association have asked the city of San Diego to end its financial subsidies<br/>
to the Boy Scouts until the BSA ends its discrimination based on sexual<br/>
orientation and religion. The legal groups are also asking that the city<br/>
council end its $1.00 lease to the Boy Scouts council for their <br/>
