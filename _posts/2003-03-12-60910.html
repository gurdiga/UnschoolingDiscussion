I just called and spoke with vice principal Jeffrey Andreano of <br/>
Oleans <br/>
high<br/>
school at length.  He was very open to discussing the incident and <br/>
not <br/>
at all<br/>
defensive.  Here is the story from his pov.  The principal told the <br/>
student he<br/>
could not hang the posters up (because that is a school policy to <br/>
prevent all<br/>
sorts of opinion posters, hate speech, etc.  from being posted).  <br/>
Posters<br/>
advertising an event (such as a peace rally) are allowed, but not <br/>
&quot;opinion&quot;<br/>
posters.<br/>
<br/>
Next, the student approached individual teachers and received <br/>
permission (even<br/>
though, again, it&#39;s not really school policy).  When the Vice <br/>
Principal <br/>
learned<br/>
that the student had received permission, he removed the detention.  <br/>
(Indeed,<br/>
the vice principal complimented the student on the wording for <br/>
peace, <br/>
etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, people are leaving nasty voicemails at Oleans high <br/>
school <br/>
with no<br/>
names because they are not hearing the entire story (and are not <br/>
willing to take<br/>
responsiblity for their own actions).<br/>
<br/>
While I applaud the spirit of this e-mail message, I am very much <br/>
concerned that<br/>
we are not getting the whole picture, and that this is simply making <br/>
the peace<br/>
movement look somewhat incompetent, gullible, and as if we are not <br/>
doing our<br/>
homework.  Perhaps we should hear from the student Jeff Chandler <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
If you wouldn&#39;t mind forwarding this to everyone that you originally <br/>
sent the<br/>
message to, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you,<br/>
