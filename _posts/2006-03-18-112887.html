<div id="ygrps-yiv-928191895">There&#39;s an article here about altruism in babies:     <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-03/04/content_4255251.htm">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-03/04/content_4255251.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an excerpt:<br/>
 *To be altruistic, babies must have the cognitive ability to understand<br/>
other people&#39;s goals plus possess what Warneken calls &quot;pro-social<br/>
motivation&quot; a desire to socialize. <br/>
&quot;When those two things come together they obviously do so at 18 months of<br/>
age and maybe earlier they are able to help,&quot; Warneken explained. *<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interesting article but the researcher could have asked a couple<br/>
of unschoolers and saved himself all that time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

  &quot;Nothing came easy, I was just born with<br/>
a need to explore every tool shop of my mind, and with long searching and<br/>
hard work, I became devoted to my restlessness.&quot;  ~ Gordon Parks</div>

all very cooperative.<br/>

Maybe two years.  And true, they&#39;re 14-19, but they&#39;re also doing  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465454211">Sandra -<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the story...<br/>
<br/>
We just got back from several stores - and I sometimes feel guilty that I<br/>
buy most often something in every store for the kids... This time we went<br/>
into a kids consignment store which said they were having a 65% off winter<br/>
stuff sale. Beside the clothes that I found my older daughter wanted this<br/>
purse and a visor hat - her little sister seeing the hat wanted one as<br/>
well... and my son who could care less about clothes (except knows what he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like ;-) wanted a bionicle. I thought they had priced them a bit<br/>
high for second hand and was concerned that maybe all the pieces would not<br/>
be in it - and then I would have to come back... but I figured the girls<br/>
each picked out things - and fine if I had to go back because pieces were<br/>
missing oh well.... everyone left happy.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the library and they were having a used book sale and each picked<br/>
out a few books -  and to the health food store where Lex picked out a very<br/>
expensive organic chocolate bar for each one. When I tried to suggest that<br/>
maybe we could get one and share it  - no one could agree on which kinds -<br/>
so they each got their own and swapped pieces. Happiness $6.00 ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I really needed to do today was go to OfficeMax and exchange<br/>
my used printer cartridge for a free ream of paper ;-) We can&#39;t go into a<br/>
store where the kids don&#39;t see something they want. My husband thinks I<br/>
should be saying no more often.... and they don&#39;t ask him for things very<br/>
often. But sometimes he will just stop and get an ice cream - or a soda<br/>
while at the gas station...so they do get things - they just may be smaller<br/>
things...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I sometimes feel that I really don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to spend the extra<br/>
money - I can go in for what I need and get out...but then again it must be<br/>
hard being a kid without your &quot;own&quot; money. If I see something I want I can<br/>
just buy it.(Well within reason....) Sometimes kids need to ask - and it can<br/>
get very frustrating for them if they are always hearing no.<br/>
<br/>
I think you or someone on this list compared the cost of these little treats<br/>
to years of adult therapy... certainly the little things win hands down ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027872560">Marty, Holly and Brett just came back from the group&#39;s lunch at Olive  <br/>
Garden.  I heard them, but haven&#39;t seen them and they don&#39;t know I  <br/>
heard them.  They came in laughing, stopped to talk to Keith who&#39;s  <br/>
working in the garage, and Marty was laughing and telling them about  <br/>
some mishap he had getting into the front door with his to-go box  <br/>
(the wind is blowing hard).  Then Marty started singing &quot;When I&#39;m  <br/>
home everything seems to be right...&quot;  (A Hard Day&#39;s Night, by The  <br/>
Beatles... just that one line; he&#39;s got a good singing voice).<br/>
<br/>
Now they&#39;re in Kirby&#39;s room, right up above me, talking about  <br/>
something on MySpace, something happy and interesting.  They&#39;re all  <br/>
animated and talkative.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t know I know they&#39;re home, so they&#39;re certainly not doing  <br/>
any of that for my benefit or to receive a good report on  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion.&lt;bwg&gt;  They&#39;re just honestly nice, happy kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950788437">My name is Mary Beth and I have been a silent member of the group, but<br/>
so enjoy all the nurturing family life stories.  My four kids are ages<br/>
10-21 and get along very well together.  They have common interests,<br/>
such as Japanese anime, video games, and drawing and often spend time<br/>
together. They share spaces and resources without a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest son saw my daughters listening to an iPod, each with one<br/>
earplug, and went out and bought them a splitter so they could each<br/>
have a full pair.  He also provided them with a lot of music.  And, he<br/>
is teaching my daughter how to make a website.  My two sons, 18 and<br/>
21, share friends and often go places together or make purchases of<br/>
electronics together.  I really love it when my 18yo son, 16yo<br/>
daughter, and 10yo daughter retreat to the girls&#39; rooms to listen to<br/>
music and draw for the evening.  Sometimes, my 10yo daughter will play<br/>
videogames with her 18yo brother and they have a great time.  My 16yo<br/>
daughter and 10yo daughter share interest in ballet and will often<br/>
talk ballet together or watch ballet videos or even practice together.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, my husband and I will hear them all chatting and laughing<br/>
together and my husband will laughingly say, &quot;This has got to stop!&quot;<br/>
We have had strangers at restaurants tell us that they enjoy seeing<br/>
how our kids get along together. <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say that I attribute this all to being homeschooled as<br/>
they have grown together instead of apart. <br/>

I just spent 6 weeks in Florida with my 3 boys (7,9,11). We stayed in<br/>
relatively close quarters with my mother (83) and her 90 year-old<br/>
partner, who is fairly conservative. Needless to say, I was a bit<br/>
apprehensive about how all of this would go down (they&#39;d never really<br/>
seen our &quot;unschooling life&quot; up close).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was all fine. BUT they were absolutely blown away by (and<br/>
kept commenting on) my boys&#39; ability to get along, the fact that all 3<br/>
played together for hours, the relative absence of bickering, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Then, we spent several days with friends in Orlando (more boys, more<br/>
unschoolers) and again, the five kids just played so beautifully<br/>
together and were consistently respectful of each other. <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that so much of what they&#39;re learning as unschoolers is<br/>
the &quot;true grit&quot; of living: communication, interaction, observation,<br/>
exploration, etc...and it shows!<br/>
<br/>
Like you all were saying in the thread about hiring: &quot;Gimme an<br/>
unschooler any day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885185002">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Robyn, you have such an incredible way of cutting through to the<br/>
really <br/>
crucial points of an issue. I&#39;m so glad to see this collection! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; She still might!   And if she does I&#39;ll put up a big link to it. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aww, shucks you guys... <br/>
<br/>
Most if the time I feel like I such a beginner on this journey. Remarkably<br/>
enough I still get a lot out of re-reading my old posts, refreshing my<br/>
memory about strategies that I am developing for my tool box. <br/>
<br/>
Luckily for me Jayn continues to be both forgiving and a great teacher (heh,<br/>
heh) The other day she told me that she &quot;couldn&#39;t listen to her heart and my<br/>
voice at the same time so I shouldn&#39;t tell her what to do when she was going<br/>
wild&quot;. It was very profound to me. She suggested that I write it down and<br/>
keep it where I could see it.<br/>

Last night Holly and I had a little moment.  She wanted to buy a salt  <br/>
lick, but not a big cow salt lick.  It&#39;s for a joke gift for one of  <br/>
Kirby&#39;s friends, who likes a lot of salt on his food, and who told  <br/>
Holly sure, he&#39;d be her best friend.  I told her they sold smaller  <br/>
salt licks for deer, and I looked them up on the internet.  I wanted  <br/>
to buy one, but she said I had told her I would take her to a feed  <br/>
store, and she wanted to do that because she liked me to drive her  <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
Our last two shopping trips have ended badly, with Holly wanting to  <br/>
go home.  For all her joy at clothing, she doesn&#39;t like shopping for  <br/>
clothes.  Or rather she can look a long time but doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
dressing rooms at all, so after one trip to the dressing room she  <br/>
wants to come back.  But this is worse.  We don&#39;t live near feed  <br/>
stores.  We&#39;ll have to go ten or fifteen miles, and I don&#39;t know if  <br/>
they&#39;ll have deer licks, and there they were—four kinds, four lbs.,  <br/>
less than $6.00 each—all I had to do was click &quot;yes and charge my  <br/>
paypal account,&quot; basically.  But she was saying no, let&#39;s go to  <br/>
feedstores.<br/>
<br/>
But nobody yelled or cried.  And she said &quot;I had a picture in my mind  <br/>
of what was going to happen, and my mind picture got jealous.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s a pretty good way to describe an irrational frustration.   She  <br/>
wants to buy her own salt lick.  She wants to SEE salt licks.  She  <br/>
wants me to take her to do it, not for me to click and wait for the  <br/>
mail next week.<br/>
<br/>
We might end up ordering it by mail anyway, or we might find a ten  <br/>
pound one somewhere that&#39;s a good compromise.  And honestly, I wanted  <br/>
to get some birdseed and the feedstore&#39;s a good place for that.  So I  <br/>
said today when we&#39;re out for the orthodontist I&#39;ll take her to a  <br/>
feedstore.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I was being worse than she was.  I was taking her project  <br/>
away from her just because it was more convenient for her.  But I had  <br/>
never realized that her explanation clarified why I get mad at Keith  <br/>
sometimes, when he wants to change a plan without asking me or  <br/>
persuading me that his way is really better.  My mind picture gets  <br/>
jealous.<br/>

(Linking this back to clothes shopping...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think in particular it&#39;s a great description of how I feel trying on clothes in dressing rooms!  It&#39;s a bummer when how you imagine the garment is widely discrepant from how it really looks.<br/>
<br/>
I remember hearing that some online merchants (particularly Lands End) have visual simulations that show how their clothes look on someone with your measurements.  (Being extra extra large, I never tried it myself.)  It could be fun to mess with, if it isn&#39;t too slow.  (On their website)<br/>
<br/>
I had a disappointing experience at Target on Friday.  Their &quot;fitted&quot; T-shirts were much smaller than I expected, and the nice striped shirts, in what should be my size, wouldn&#39;t button over my chest.  I think I&#39;m the same size as I was last year, so I think the baggy look has been replaced by tighter cuts and it is confusing.<br/>
<br/>

PS  I remember when I was 12 (younger than Holly) growing out of some of my favorite clothes (psychadelic Nehru jacket) when I would have loved to keep them.</div>

They sell even smaller ones for guinea pigs.  I had piggies when I <br/>
was 12-15 or so.  The salt licks for them are round, about 3 inches <br/>
across, and have a hole in them to tie them to the cage.  There are <br/>
white ones (all salt) and brown ones (salt plus other minerals).  It <br/>
would be fun to put one on a hemp cord or something as a necklace <br/>
for the salt lover.  They have them at pet stores, maybe Walmart <br/>
too, the feed store is probably more fun though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh thanks!  She already found one at the feed store.  It was on the  <br/>
aisle with wild bird seed and such.  Maybe it was for rabbits?  It  <br/>
has a groove down the sides, so I guess there&#39;s a holder created for it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll let her know about the miniature wearable ones!  Thanks.<br/>
