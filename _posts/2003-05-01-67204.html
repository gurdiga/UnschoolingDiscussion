 </span></blockquote>Tell me more! :)  I&#39;m in Rapid City, SD ~ when I arrived our first Sunday, my <br/>
kids were the only ones there.  The second time, there were the three :( <br/>
regulars and another new kid.  Luckily, we newbies have felt right at home <br/>
and are completely comfortable with just 6 kids (sometimes 7) in RE.  They&#39;re <br/>
all aged 4 to 9 and we do one program including all of them.  The parents <br/>
usually take turns doing the programs for the kids, though I&#39;ve begun asking <br/>
others [who I find interesting] to contribute to our children, as well.  We <br/>
do UU Principles every-other week with a fun crafty project [or just playing <br/>
soccer] in between.  My kids have no problem being the only homeschoolers, <br/>
just as they have no problem being the only ones with a dead dad ;)  We got <br/>
the UU&Me magazine for the first time ~ how blessed we were to have a topic <br/>
covered that my children know so well (death) and for it to be talked about <br/>
in a *this is how SOME people believe* format.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh and I wanted to tack this on ~ How could you not LOVE a church that says <br/>
this:  <br/>
Grateful for the religious pluralism which enriches and enables our faith, we <br/>
are inspired to deepen our understanding and expand our vision.  As a free <br/>
congregation we enter into this covenant promising one another our mutual <br/>
trust and support.  <br/>
Sounds like an unschooling parental promise to me &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856435361">Another UU here! I actually just started going to a UU church last year and <br/>
joined a few months ago. We just had a visioning weekend to decide where we <br/>
wanted to go in the next 5-10 years. I have really been enjoying it and am <br/>
planning on getting more involved this year. The people have been great and <br/>
I feel so comfortable being around folks who are so open to ideas.<br/>
<br/>
It has the perfect place to explore what I believe.<br/>
<br/>
There are not many homeschooling kids there though. I think one other family with<br/>
older kids. In talking a bit with UU friends they think that it might be because<br/>
UUs tend to be big supporters of public education.  <br/>
<br/>
Is the UU hsing list on yahoogroups?<br/>
