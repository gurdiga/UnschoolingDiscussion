<div id="ygrps-yiv-377412273">I don&#39;t actually tell him he is lazy etc. at least not as rule. I may <br/>
have in anger once. I wish I was perfect  LOL Itell him he is  bright and <br/>
smart. Sometimes I think he feels like my telling him he is smart puts pressure on <br/>
him and that is not my intent. Geez, hormones at 15!  Sometimes the more I <br/>
try to encourage the more hegets frustrated. Actually, he and I are very close. <br/>
He loves to hang out with me. We go to the mall and bookstore and stuff. He <br/>
says he wants to take summer classes to make up what he got Fs in. We just found <br/>
out this morning that all of the day classes are full. I have no idea what he <br/>
will decide. Maybe night time is better for him. I have told him he has so <br/>
many options. He  wants to go to college by the way, it is not just my dream for <br/>
him. I think in the past he just wasn&#39;t very interested in the way they do <br/>
school, and unfortunatley I was not ready to HS. I had not learned about it. <br/>
Then we got thiscomputer and I met people here that HS and I gained the <br/>
confidence to try. Then I had to convine dh. I don&#39;t think I totally have yet but I got <br/>
the courage to as Nike says.....just do it!  oh back to my original thot  LOL <br/>
(sorry I type as it comes out of my brain!) I think he is not so much <br/>
disinterested (which may be still part of it) but more just undecided and feels <br/>
frustrated? At ps you can&#39;t just try a class then change your mind in the middle <br/>
cuz you don&#39;t like it or don&#39;t like the instructor. I wish he would give HS <br/>
another try. I am still learning and make mistakes just like he does. It has taken <br/>
me a while to deschool too! Old habits die hard!<br/>
       Bye the way  I am an ENFP  could ya tell?<br/>

Just because you&#39;re not perfect doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t try to do the best <br/>
you can do.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe telling him he&#39;s bright and smart isn&#39;t going to be very helpful right <br/>
now either.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes the more I <br/>

<br/>
Kinda like that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
When encouragement and praise are actually part of manipulation and cajoling <br/>
one to be one way instead of another, it&#39;s anoter step back.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;At ps you can&#39;t just try a class then change your mind in the middle <br/>
cuz you don&#39;t like it or don&#39;t like the instructor. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t?  When I taught, kids changed teachers.  Teachers changed kids.  <br/>
Maybe instead of make-up classes, he could take some community college <br/>
classes with people of varying ages who WANT to be there, not who are forced to be <br/>
there.   Non-academic, fun, REAL stuff.<br/>
<br/>
He can make those credits up later IF he stays in school, and if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
stay in school it never has to be done, ever.<br/>
