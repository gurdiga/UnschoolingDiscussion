&gt; &gt;interests he has (SCA activities, Celtic arts, and many more) are not<br/>
&gt; &gt;available here on our gorgeous island of Kauai - &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He could visit here too. We aren&#39;t into SCA, but several homeschoolers in<br/>
&gt; our group are. One family is pretty active in the Celtic festival here<br/>
&gt; (sometime in the summer, but I don&#39;t know exactly when but could find out).<br/>
&gt; We have a studio apartment in our basement, so we&#39;re pretty well equipped<br/>
&gt; for visitors.<br/>
&gt; Hey, he could do the unschooling house tour of the mainland! Now a cool way<br/>
&gt; to do it would be to have each family drive him to the next family&#39;s house,<br/>
&gt; then we could meet up with even more fun folks and road trip at the same<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

Boston! <br/>
