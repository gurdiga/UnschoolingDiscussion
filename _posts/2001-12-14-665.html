<div id="ygrps-yiv-380370898">OK, that&#39;s the strangest article I&#39;ve read in a long time. It&#39;s<br/>
fundamentalism taken to the extreme, and I sit here wondering why that<br/>
should bug me so. I&#39;m nth-generation fundamentalist and I play along because<br/>
of dh and, yes, because my parents are still alive, so the whole concept<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be that alien. It&#39;s just that they&#39;ve taken their interpretation<br/>
of Jewish marriage customs as presented in the Bible and brought it forward<br/>
to today and it&#39;s downright creepy. Still, for all we know, this couple is<br/>
really happy. They wouldn&#39;t know any differently. Would they?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the only thing related to Jewish Marriage customs was the folk<br/>
dancing!<br/>
<br/>
I actually find it interesting. (Not that I would want to do something even<br/>
remotely like that) But I am always fascinated by people who give up so much<br/>
of their own control. It seems to me to make life very easy. No decisions<br/>
are made by a person therefore they can never make any mistakes.<br/>
