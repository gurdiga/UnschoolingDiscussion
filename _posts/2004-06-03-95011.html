 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been wanting to respond to Sheila&#39;s posts and this seems like a <br/>
good place to jump in. It sounds (from comfortably far away, I <br/>
realize) like there have been lots of power struggles, both growing <br/>
up and now with the kids. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s taken quite a while for me to learn that there&#39;s a third option, <br/>
rather than just choosing who, the parent or the child, is going to <br/>
win the power struggle. Avoiding the power struggle is the best way. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, with a child able and willing to discuss the issue, <br/>
negociation and brainstorming is good to avoid fighting about it, or <br/>
having one person feeling put out. Other times, empathizing with <br/>
feelings &quot;I know it&#39;s hard to wait for Mommy to finish the dishes&quot; or <br/>
distraction and diversion (playing with water, cups and bowls will <br/>
Mommy cleans up)...or whatever you work out with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so much the specific solution for any one situation, it&#39;s <br/>
seeing that third option. On another list, people were hearing &quot;not <br/>
controling&quot; TV watching as meaning they couldn&#39;t have any influence <br/>
over what their children did. No, there&#39;s something in between. <br/>
<br/>
Flylady&#39;s 15 minute cleaning sessions can work if the kids get into <br/>
using timers and knowing their turn is coming. Some kids, some adults.<br/>
<br/>
Sheila, I again recommend Kurcinka&#39;s &quot;Power Struggles&quot; book. If the <br/>
kids are used to getting your attention by winning a power struggle, <br/>
it&#39;s going to be some work to help them understand they aren&#39;t losing <br/>
if you do something without them for a little while. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68431477">Question.<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; discussion. What do you <br/>
think of this as a principle for how to say yes or no?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we need to get honest with ourselves and each other.<br/>
<br/>
I had the following situation last summer. My 13 year old daughter had <br/>
a very active social life. She wanted to go out with friends most <br/>
nights of the week and usually needed rides that were 30 minutes round <br/>
trip to get where she wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say yes as much as possible and did for four weeks until I <br/>
was dreading another request for a ride.<br/>
<br/>
I finally told her that I wanted her to have a wonderful summer with <br/>
friends and I would do all I could to facilitate it, but I needed to do <br/>
it less because I found myself dreading her requests instead of looking <br/>
forward to them. We have four other kids who needed me too and I was <br/>
spending too much time in the car. I asked her thoughts and she told me <br/>
that she felt frustrated that she had so few alternatives for rides.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to brainstorm some ways to make us both happy. She brought the <br/>
kids to our house a few times instead of going out, she got a few rides <br/>
and I drove a little less. I took a one week break once just to have a <br/>
vacation. :) During that week, my husband did more of the driving. Once <br/>
my son got his license, he helped even more.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, perhaps the principle might be that when you feel you need to <br/>
say &quot;no,&quot; it helps to give the context for the &quot;no&quot; and also search for <br/>
a possible &quot;yes&quot; solution for the one requesting your involvement. <br/>
Seems like we need to communicate more than &quot;I will&quot; or &quot;I want to&quot; or <br/>
&quot;I won&#39;t&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; in order for this to work.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;What do you think?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds pretty good. <br/>
<br/>
I think it covers not saying no arbitrarily, and modelling problem solving <br/>
strategies.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to facilitate the kids&#39; busy lives.  The idea is not to be the <br/>
sole facilitator!  <br/>
<br/>
And as to boredom or feeling overwhelmed with kid-need on everyday-days, I <br/>
don&#39;t think anything comes close to having other kids over more, or maybe a <br/>
mother&#39;s helper.  Kids can do more in their own homes just with the addition of <br/>
another human.  Lego is different, Barbies are different, the swingset is <br/>
different, the videos are different, if the new kid has new ideas and methods and <br/>
knowledge.<br/>

I missed this one. I agree Julie. I think that&#39;s absolutely what mindful<br/>
parenting is about.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I&#39;m working on right now along those same lines, and would<br/>
welcome comments on it:<br/>
<br/>
Freedom and flexibility are two key components to parenting my youngest<br/>
child, both of which fly in the face of traditional parenting techniques<br/>
that would recommend stricter controls and absolute authority to really<br/>
teach this kid &quot;who&#39;s boss!&quot;  Parenting with freedom and flexibility<br/>
presents a whole new set of challenges because most of us have no model for<br/>
what it should look like. It requires us to throw out the ingrained images<br/>
from our own childhoods, to suppress our knee-jerk reactions to situations<br/>
and, instead, turn our critical eye inward to examine the underpinning and<br/>
legitimacy of our reactions and requests, which requires a whole new set of<br/>
introspective skills!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The simple word &quot;no&quot; has a myriad of meanings when we take it apart<br/>
situationally. It might mean &quot;I don&#39;t want you to get hurt&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want<br/>
that to get broken.&quot; Or, it might really mean &quot;I don&#39;t want to listen to<br/>
that&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to clean that up.&quot; The common element to<br/>
these situational differences, however, is the primary importance of the<br/>
parent&#39;s self rather than the child&#39;s.  &quot;No,&quot; then, is really a reflection<br/>
of the parent&#39;s own needs and desires rather than a direct expression of the<br/>
child&#39;s actions. Once we see this connection, we can begin to parent more<br/>
honestly-for ourselves and our children.<br/>
<br/>

There&#39;s a story in there of how I learned a lot about the word &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wed, Jul 28, 1993<br/>
The first thing [Marty] said after “good morning” was “Mom, if you count to <br/>
infinity, is it illegal?”<br/>
<br/>
I explained to him about infinity, with a million plus one and a “gadillion” <br/>
plus one. He was fine with the explanation, and I said, “Who told you you <br/>
can’t count to infinity?” He said I did, so I explained the difference in things <br/>
that are impossible and things that are illegal (have consequences).<br/>
<br/>
--------<br/>
<br/>
It made a  difference in how I used &quot;can&#39;t&quot; after that.<br/>
