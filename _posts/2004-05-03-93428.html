<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133033553">Hello Everyone ~<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t post much at all........but I just wanted to thank you all for your <br/>
honesty and wonderful insights into homeschooling.  Most of all your REALNESS <br/>
in life and homeschool.....I have been homeschooling for two years.  I was <br/>
involved with local homeschool groups and just didn&#39;t fit in ~ when I found this <br/>
list, I pretty much found the support I needed, and left the local groups to <br/>
superschooling......  My boys are happy and very well adjusted, and seek their <br/>
education with excitement.......(we built a campfire in the front yard today <br/>
and discussed what being a cowboy must have been like..... last night we watched <br/>
the mystery of the bermuda triangle)  We do workbooks with math.....but other <br/>
than that, we just explore and learn together........and it&#39;s wonderful. This <br/>
way of life ROCKS!!  <br/>
<br/>
This group of Emporer&#39;s in PJ&#39;s is the best!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again ~<br/>
