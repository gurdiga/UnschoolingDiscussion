&lt;&lt; Todd, who *certainly* didn&#39;t mean to offend anybody :-((( &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YOU didn&#39;t offend me Todd, the notion that people who disagree may be <br/>
half-cocked did. :) grins.<br/>
It&#39;s quite alright. I suppose I get a bit touchy when people say stuff like <br/>
that...because then if you offer advice or opinions that are totally against <br/>
what someone has already said, people scream &quot;put down&quot;!  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
a put down to dissect an idea, but then, some would disagree with me..<br/>
<br/>

Well, I was more or less talking about people flaming others with differing <br/>
opinions, not people who just disagreed or dissected ideas. That&#39;s all :-)<br/>
