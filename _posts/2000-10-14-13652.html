<div id="ygrps-yiv-402511636">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many people out there are homeschooling an only child.  I<br/>
have a six year old boy that we unschool.  The older he gets the more<br/>
self directed he gets.  There are times that I&#39;m bored and feel like I<br/>
have not purpose other than being the adult at home.  I suppose I could<br/>
start cleaning my house more.  I&#39;m trying to involve him more in what I<br/>
do but on the other hand when he&#39;s on a roll of discovery I don&#39;t want<br/>
to interfer.  Today I road in the back of a train he made to go down<br/>
into a iron mine.  (we saw an iron mine last week and took a train down<br/>
in it.) We are sort of trying to have another child, I&#39;m 42 and it&#39;s<br/>
been about a year.  Our son said today, &quot;He&#39;d be happier if he had a<br/>
brother or sister but he&#39;d still be happy if he didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
I guess the question is how to handle a day that is an endless discovery<br/>
for my son but rather isolating and boring to me at times?<br/>

We are unschooling an only child, 3.5 years, and I look forward to his<br/>
independence as it seems your son has at 6. Now you can get involved in<br/>
hobbies/interests and unschool yourself. It will be good for him to see you<br/>
learn something new, and  passionate about a project. Is there something you<br/>
always wanted to know more about? Start dabbling. Craft or art projects?<br/>
Musical interests? Volunteering?<br/>
Causes you believe in and want to help? The Society for Creative Anachronism<br/>
got me going on making medieval costumes, a fun thing for me. Maybe there is<br/>
a class you would like to take? A dance happening in your town? Making<br/>
friends that are adults can also help, other hs parents or just parents. I<br/>
like the idea of working together on whatever with friends with kids near in<br/>
one person&#39;s home.<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604952870">Hi Sherry:<br/>
<br/>
I am unschooling only one child, a boy who is seven, and there are lots of <br/>
times I ask myself the question you have asked. There are days when I <br/>
suggest many activities my son and I could do together and he doesn&#39;t like <br/>
any of them; he would prefer to work alone, on a computer program usually, <br/>
or finish some Lego project. I feel quite unnecessary sometimes, except for <br/>
lunches, driving him to the activities he likes, and the <br/>
all-important  touch-base-with Mom hugs that are needed here and <br/>
there.  Also, I am coming to realize that parents won&#39;t always share the <br/>
passions of their children; although I play with my son and share his <br/>
projects, my passions tend towards nature and natural history, not cars and <br/>
computer games. (Sometimes I just can&#39;t stand playing car racing games just <br/>
one more time, and my son yawns when I get excited about seeing a new bird <br/>
in the yard!) I guess it&#39;s good that these children can self-direct, but <br/>
that points up the fact that we adults should also be self-directed and <br/>
find things about which we can become passionate. Of course, that requires <br/>
deciding what interests us and pursuing those interests, thus providing a <br/>
good example of adults (especially female adults) leading full lives. This <br/>
is sometimes easier said than done, at least I have found it <br/>
so.  Unschoolers say that boredom is often a good thing because it leads us <br/>
on to new interests. Are there any hobbies or past interests that you may <br/>
want to revisit? Or perhaps learn something new? Well, I am still working <br/>
on finding my interests, but I can definitely say they won&#39;t include more <br/>
housework! :-)<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I feel we are in a similar place as far as age (I&#39;m <br/>
turning 41) and more children go. I had a miscarriage over two years ago <br/>
and we haven&#39;t really been trying since, but I am rethinking this idea <br/>
(although I am worried about childbirth at this age). I am also thinking <br/>
about adopting an older child (perhaps toddler age?), but wonder how <br/>
homeschooling would affect adoption. I feel I have the time and love to <br/>
give to another child, but my son has been used to being an only for so <br/>
long that he prefers not sharing his parents with anyone else. I have <br/>
suggested the idea and he isn&#39;t thrilled. It is true that I am more <br/>
available to him now for sports play, field trips and one-on-one play than <br/>
I would be if we had another child, especially another infant. But there <br/>
are other personal, emotional issues that go into the decision to add to <br/>
one&#39;s family that need to be considered. It is difficult to weigh all the <br/>
options sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am rambling. As a final thought, sometimes when I am feeling <br/>
isolated and my son has spent a lot of time absorbed in one thing, I try to <br/>
get us out of the house to do something we both like, or I spend some time <br/>
investigating fresh ideas for field trips and start planning something. A <br/>
change of scene breaks the monotony, and if we involve other friends and <br/>
their parents, I get to exchange ideas with other adults while my son has a <br/>
good time with other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this was too long!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278899124">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for responding.  It&#39;s nice to know other folks are out<br/>
there and coming up with creative solutions.<br/>
I&#39;ll be making Christmas presents for family soon, which can be fun.<br/>
I&#39;ll be doing some sewing of skirts, shirts and pants.<br/>
It&#39;s basically Ren. Fair type clothes.  My son likes to push the peddle<br/>
on the machine for a little while (until something else<br/>
excites him).  If  I&#39;m spending any more time on housework it&#39;s going to<br/>
be a group project!<br/>
