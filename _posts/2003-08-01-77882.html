<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210563108">My husband taught himself calculus and logic from his mom&#39;s college <br/>
textbooks because he was bored and had completed all the honors courses <br/>
his hs had to offer.  It was interesting to him and he also studied <br/>
philosophy this way and had much joy using it arguing with his teachers <br/>
all day.<br/>

&gt; There&#39;s no reason why it can&#39;t.   For example, if he becomes <br/>
&gt; interested in<br/>
&gt; Physics, and he find he needs Algebra, he&#39;ll learn it to help him <br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; Physics.  I like that example because I failed Algebra twice in HS, <br/>
&gt; but got straight<br/>
&gt; A&#39;s in Physics, all I needed was context to help me understand it.<br/>
