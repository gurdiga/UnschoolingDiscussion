<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi everyone! I just joined the group yesterday and have already gotten so <br/>
much out of the posts. I wanted to jump in here and introduce myself, because <br/>
the comment this poster made describes what I&#39;m trying to get through right <br/>
now. We&#39;ve been homeschooling for almost 3 years. I have a son (who will be 8 <br/>
in a couple of weeks) and an almost 3 year old daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on this list before (a long time ago) and ended up unsubbing <br/>
because I just couldn&#39;t get past my &quot;schoolish&quot; mentality, even though I <br/>
really wanted to. A few weeks ago, I ordered a boxed curriculum, I don&#39;t know <br/>
what came over me and I regretted it immediately. We got the box full of <br/>
workbooks etc at the beginning of last week. I made a little schedule and we <br/>
got started. It was terrible!! It was so boring and unnatural! But at the <br/>
same time it was wonderful because I finally realized that the &quot;schoolish&quot; <br/>
way is the wrong way for us! The whole lot of stuff has been put up for sale <br/>
and I can&#39;t wait until it&#39;s gone. Looking at the stacks of workbooks makes me <br/>
realize how ridiculous I have been in the search for the right way for my fa<br/>
mily to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I am so excited to have found this list again! I am eager to learn from your <br/>
examples how to relax and let go. I welcome the opinions (and I&#39;ve read the <br/>
archives, lol, so I know how that can go)!!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know you all better!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
Dena in Florida<br/>

WAIT!!! You might want to keep it around, you know, available on the <br/>
shelf and just don&#39;t use it the way you were.<br/>
I have &quot;schoolish&quot; looking stuff around. You never know if the kids <br/>
might find it interesting. Most of mine gathers dust, but once in a <br/>
while someone pulls it out for fun.<br/>
Welcome back!<br/>
People like you are the reason I keep &quot;sticking my neck out&quot;...cuz ya <br/>
never know what posts are going to reach a person and help them get <br/>
to a more flowing, happy, unschooling lifestyle....even later when <br/>
they might have left the list.<br/>
Also, there is a FL e-mail list if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
I could e-mail it to you.<br/>

    Hi! I have kept some of the schoolish things we had, just for reference <br/>
if we should ever need it. The curriculum I bought though was boring, believe <br/>
me, no one in this house will ever want to use it for anything! LOL! We do <br/>
have workbooks laying around for the kids, I&#39;ll keep those around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks! You wouldn&#39;t believe how much the things I read here before went <br/>
through my mind! I think that I knew that we&#39;d be unschoolers someday, I just <br/>
had a few hurdles to jump first.<br/>
<br/>
I would love the addy for the  Florida email list when you get the chance!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I know it isn&#39;t funny, ha ha style, but it is funny in the curiouser and <br/>
curiouser style (ala Alice in Wonderland) how we humans have to do things to <br/>
ourselves to get our OWN attention &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

    You&#39;ve got that right! Hopefully I&#39;ve learned my lesson now, lol! Now if <br/>
I can only convince my hubby that unschooling is a good thing ...<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
