<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Some rehashed old stories&quot; is pretty harsh about something like Hamlet, or<br/>

<br/>
And Hamlet has very little plot to speak of anyway.<br/>

I agree that playing with the time frame is fun. And that if good writers or<br/>
poets use the ideas and rework them, great. I&#39;m just talking about the idea<br/>
of &quot;translating&quot; the words of Shakespeare into modern words.<br/>

I saw Disney&#39;s Pocahontas. It made me more curious to know what the real<br/>
story was.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the barrier to Shakespeare is trying to understand the story while<br/>
trying to understand the words. (Kids are probably a lot better at it since<br/>
they are used to pulling meaning out of speech without understanding all the<br/>
words.) As I read the translation and then the original I could appreciate<br/>
better his use of words because of the contrast of the modern words and<br/>
because the modern words gave me the gist of what he was trying to say.<br/>

<br/>
In the past I have read Charles and Mary Lamb&#39;s versions of Shakespeare<br/>
before reading the orginal works. It made it easier to understand the<br/>
language. I agree that side by side translations will make Shakespeare more<br/>
accessible and be the bridge to many people becoming comfortable reading the<br/>
original language. Takes away the &quot;I&#39;ll never be able to understand this so<br/>
why bother&quot; for kids required to read it too.<br/>
