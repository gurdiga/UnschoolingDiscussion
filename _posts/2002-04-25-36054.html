<div id="ygrps-yiv-19929938">To paraphrase Bridget:  Is unschooling just education or life in general<br/>
with a special needs child?<br/>
<br/>
I believe that it is life in general.  Danny has tremendous trouble<br/>
controlling his emotional outbursts and so we spend a lot of time talking<br/>
about it.  There are places that I must go that I may choose to leave him<br/>
home with a babysitter because the circumstances pretty much guarantee a<br/>
fit.  So I am working more with him in that area to help him be happy and in<br/>
control of himself.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane is not &quot;special needs&quot; but she is a terrible speller (she would be<br/>
the first one to tell you so).  So when she has 4-H reports or whatever, we<br/>
spend a lot of time talking about spelling, I help her by telling her how to<br/>
spell words.<br/>
<br/>
Zach would be labeled &quot;special needs&quot; if he were in school (the dreaded<br/>
ADHD).  Again we spend time talking about what behaviors drive others<br/>
insane, possible alternatives.  I encourage him to get outside as much as<br/>
possible and to get plenty of rest.  When he starts just flopping across the<br/>
floor about 11:00, I tell him to go to bed if he is tired.  He isn&#39;t forced<br/>
but encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie should have been special needs (her birth family is full to the gills<br/>
with retardation and psychosis) but she is probably the most energetic<br/>
learner we have.  It is all I can do to just keep up with her learning and<br/>
to answer her many and varied questions.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle is not special needs but she is two, so I help her see the benefits<br/>
of picking up toys, of not throwing food during dinner.  I answer all her<br/>
questions as they come.<br/>
<br/>
For each of the kids, I work to meet them where they are.  That is<br/>
unschooling, that is individualized parenting for special needs.<br/>

Very good post and pretty much sums up what I think about unschooling <br/>
with special needs well.<br/>
