There are so many hormones in our food, chicken and milk especially, she<br/>
could have had a day where she ate a great deal of synthetic hormone and had<br/>
a hormone shift of her own that brought on the spotting. She might not spot<br/>
again for a year or more.  9-10 is not too young for the first signs of<br/>
puberty.  At early 10 my first daughter put on a layer of fat all along her<br/>
torso.  This is normal. They use it to in the up and coming hormone<br/>
production and to make breast and hips out of. &lt;G&gt; I would take processed<br/>
chicken and as much dairy as I could out of her diet.<br/>
<br/>
You have done the important part. You have informed her, provided resources.<br/>
She knows she can com to you when the idea has had time to sink in and for<br/>
other body signs to be noticed.  Now you have to do the hard part and let<br/>
things unfold at their own pace.<br/>

        Wow... at 8 1/2,   that does seem early, but I&#39;m not sure it seems <br/>
too early nowadays.  I read somewhere that girls are starting periods at an <br/>
earlier age than when their mothers did, and that we, as daughters, may have <br/>
started a little earlier than our mothers.  My mom is in her late 50&#39;s, and <br/>
started at about 16.  I am in my mid 30&#39;s and started at 13.  You said you <br/>
started I believe at 11, so maybe at almost 9, your daughter&#39;s system has <br/>
&quot;kicked in&quot;.  She does seem uneasy talking about it, so giving her some books <br/>
is probably a good idea, however, I would suggest these books were not too <br/>
graphic and intended for older readers-- maturing physically does not always <br/>
equal maturing mentally.  I was uneasy talking openly about it with my mom, <br/>
too, so looking at books helped me understand in a way that was comfortable <br/>
to me.  She, too, was always there for me; she gave me the birds and bees <br/>
talk, and then gave my bro and me a 4pc set of books on how the body <br/>
changes--both boys and girls.  My bro dove right into them... I would look at <br/>
them by myself in my room...he would ask a thousand questions... I don&#39;t <br/>
remember asking any!  I&#39;m not really sure how old we were, but I know we were <br/>
in the middle-upper elem grades.  I think you are thinking this out, and <br/>
handling it just fine!  There are probably lots of moms who  feel they are  <br/>
not exactly ready for their daughter&#39;s puberty, especially when it seems to <br/>
come on early... trust yourself to handle it in a comfortable way for your <br/>
daughter and yourself, I know you will do fine!                                 <br/>

I think you need to slow down a bit. This spotting may or may not be the<br/>
begining of her periods and I think it might be a little premature to be<br/>
talking about GYN visits and tampon use. First of all, if it is her periods<br/>
starting her pediatritian can help, I know I sarted my periods 3 years<br/>
before my first GYN visit and you probably don&#39;t need a doctor at all. I&#39;m<br/>
not sure about tampon use in 8 year olds, but I would imagine if you&#39;ve got<br/>
your periods it&#39;s o.k. to use them. They do make a junior size. Also<br/>
remember that the spotting could be from something else. I remember when my<br/>
cousin was young she fell onto the cross bar of her bike and bled vaginally<br/>
for a few days. And, barring any injuries ( which I&#39;m sure she would have<br/>
told you about) there can be other physical contidions (such as uti&#39;s and<br/>
rectal fisures) that could have produced the bleeding. That&#39;s where the<br/>
pedi. would come into play. My 7yo. dd had acouple of days of spotting a few<br/>
months back. Nothing ever came of it and she did not start her periods. I<br/>
hope I&#39;m not going on too much here. What ever the situation turns out to be<br/>
I wish you and your daughter luck. Keep us posted.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; This board has been quiet for a while. But I hope all you supportive moms<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; somewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; some real good advice soon.<br/>
&gt; okay here is the situation.<br/>
&gt; My dd is 81/2.<br/>
&gt; Over the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a<br/>
cleaning<br/>
&gt; spree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for her<br/>
&gt; last weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of<br/>
&quot;spotting&quot;<br/>
&gt; on them .<br/>
&gt; Okay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11<br/>
myself<br/>
&gt; my sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I believe<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; husbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>
&gt; Anyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was talking<br/>
&gt; about. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little<br/>
&gt; embarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my<br/>
&gt; bestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her 10<br/>
yod<br/>
&gt; just had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave me<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; bring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; out for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; tried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have any<br/>
&gt; questions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject for<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; .What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp this<br/>
&gt; concept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want to<br/>
&gt; make sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to the<br/>
&gt; Drs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone agree?<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; booklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ?????? For an<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-687977482">Well, I started at 9, back in the dark ages (50&#39;s) as did several other<br/>
members of my family.  So, some<br/>
pre-spotting prior to that age doesn&#39;t sound too out there.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to the tampons.  That whole business about it being o.k. is simply<br/>
manufacturers trying to get more customers.  When I went through the<br/>
classes back in the dark ages, we were told they were definately not o.k.<br/>
for anyone who wasn&#39;t sexually active and were really not designed for<br/>
anyone who hadn&#39;t had a child yet.<br/>
<br/>
We now know that they contain Dioxin and this push for younger and younger<br/>
girls to use tampons would seem to correlate with the increase in various<br/>
cancers and the younger and younger age that women are getting cancer<br/>
(ovarian, cervical, uterine and breast).<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is really weird because this seems to be a topic on several lists<br/>
right now so I have my whole Dioxin speel down.  Dioxin is in the top 10 of<br/>
known carcenogens.  It is the &quot;evil&quot; from Love Canal, etc.  It is fat<br/>
soluable, not water soluable which means it resides in fatty tissues and is<br/>
found in humans, mammals, birds and fish and seeks them out, so to speak. <br/>
Dioxin is the by-product of the bleaching process that cotton goes through<br/>
and is residual.  Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>
are put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>
chemical free.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765277417">Just dropping in on this very personal topic.<br/>
<br/>
I had toxic shock syndrome when I was 30 from tampon use.  I nearly died, and <br/>
lost all the skin on the palms of my hands and soles of my feet, along with a <br/>
lot of hair.  The physicians told me that I was someone who should not use <br/>
tampons again.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old is going through some of the puberty things.  Surprising, <br/>
since I was 16 when I started, and my pediatrician says like mom, like <br/>
daughter.  Anyways, she knows my story and is only using pads, at least for <br/>
the time being, at her choice. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511025134">I found this discussion interesting as I have only a son, no daughter.  My<br/>
son, now 11, has known about menstrual periods as long as I can remember.<br/>
It was just part of the bathroom thing like peeing and pooping.  He knew I<br/>
had periods before it ever occured to him to be embarassed about it, so, it<br/>
is quite a natural process for him now.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that although I am a rather prudish person in my way<br/>
of dressing, I have felt quite comfortable talking to my son about sexual<br/>
topic as he brought them up.  Answering only what he asked has always<br/>
worked for us. As he is a question asker, we have covered just about<br/>
everything in this way (but not wet dreams yet, as I don&#39;t really<br/>
understand them and I&#39;ve asked my husband to talk about it, and I don&#39;t<br/>
think he has yet).<br/>
