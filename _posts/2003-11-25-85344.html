No money for anything like that. However, I have planned for a couple <br/>
educational type games for the computer for her for Christmas, I may just go ahead <br/>
and get them early. She does enjoy being on the computer.<br/>

e-mail?  It might satisfy her urge, but she&#39;d still be at home.  It might be <br/>
fun or it might not be, but it wouldn&#39;t involve all the clothing travel <br/>
expense <br/>
and exposure of school itself, nor involve you the mom in the <br/>
teaching/organizing/approving of stuff.<br/>

I missed somehow how old your daughter is, but there are some cool, free <br/>
courses through Barnes and Noble online. You might have to help her if she&#39;s <br/>
younger. But there&#39;s a big range of topics...pretty cool. My son did part of a <br/>
Civil War thing, and I did a Writing thing. Check it out. <br/>
