<br/>
Not by Texas law.<br/>
<br/>
In Texas, you can be psychotic and still legally sane.  To be legally insane<br/>
here, you must be unable to tell that your actions were wrong.  By calling<br/>
the police, Mrs. Yates indicated that she was aware her actions needed to be<br/>
reported.<br/>
<br/>
In Houston a few years ago, a man took quite a few school children<br/>
&quot;hostage&quot;.  It came out that he believed the school was a prison camp and<br/>
that children were being kept there against their will.  He was attempting<br/>
to &quot;liberate&quot; them.  By Texas law, he was legally insane.<br/>
<br/>
The thinking behind the law is that being psychotic is not a protection<br/>
against being criminal.<br/>

he&#39;s going to have to get on with his life now.  Wanta bet he&#39;s married <br/>
again within the year?<br/>

He also missed out on Andrea&#39;s sentencing (and his own jury duty) because <br/>
he was flying across the country to be on two different talk shows.  You&#39;d <br/>
think he&#39;d want to be there to find out what was going to happen to her.<br/>

said episode the person will know that what they did during the episode was<br/>
wrong or that help was needed.<br/>

Her episode was no different in that she felt that she had to protect the<br/>

The difference is that she has the misfortune of being a woman in Texas<br/>

all he could to help her.  He trusted the doctors opinion and they never said <br/>
she was a threat to her children.  She probably did not tell the doctors all <br/>
that she was thinking for fear they would come and take her children away.  <br/>
She probably thought she could handle everything.   Her mother in law was <br/>
staying with her and had been every day for a couple of months.  She was <br/>
getting better so the mother in law started coming an hour later in the <br/>
morning.  That is when the tragedy happened.  I feel sorry beyond belief for <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377652681">I read in a book that it was King Solomon who advocated spanking.  His<br/>
son grew up to be a harsh ruler who caused the kindom to divide because<br/>
of it.  You don&#39;t find spanking any where else in the Bible.  In fact,<br/>
Jesus said not to rule over people but to serve everyone.  Also, even<br/>
Solomon taught to use a rod, which was like a thin, flexible stick that<br/>
holds mylar baloons at the store.  It is meant to sting, but cannot<br/>
physically harm the child like a bigger, rigid stick or a paddle.  Of<br/>
course, there is no where it says you have to spank in the Bible.  I<br/>
know, I read it every day.  In fact, it seems to never really say an<br/>
absolute in the proverbs.  Proverbs is just a book of things to think<br/>
about, that usually apply abstractly to things in life.  For instance, it<br/>
says stripes of a friend are faithful- that&#39;s not literally true.  People<br/>
don&#39;t spank their friends, they use words to confront things that they<br/>
see as wrong.  So it&#39;s often figurative.  And the scripture about saving<br/>
your child from hell has to do with it&#39;s better for him to get a spanking<br/>
now for rebelling than to later become a criminal who kills and steals. <br/>
The idea of hell being the grave, or dying an early death due to wrong<br/>
behavior.  Of course, it also implies the idea of defying your parents<br/>
and getting away with it may lead to defying God without remedy.  It says<br/>
in the New Testament to not make your kids mad by provoking them, but<br/>
instead to instruct and correct them respectfully.  Also, in other places<br/>
in the Bible, the rod implies the one shepherds used to guide their sheep<br/>
to keep them from going over a cliff and as a visual aid so their sheep<br/>
would know where the shepherd was-not something to beat the sheep with. <br/>
In fact, other scriptures villify the shepherds who beat their sheep. <br/>
The New Testament teaches that we are no longer under the law, but under<br/>
grace.  We are no longer to be getting in trouble by God, but free to<br/>
have a relationship with God of love, forgiveness and acceptance.  That<br/>
should describe a Christian&#39;s relationship with one&#39;s children, since we<br/>
are supposed to be examples to them of God&#39;s nature.  Okay, now I&#39;m done.<br/>

her to be but back on antipsychotic medication, he&#39;d had her hospitalized<br/>
at least twice, his mother had come out to stay with her and help with<br/>
the kids for a long period. It sounded to me like he was lulled into<br/>
believing the &quot;experts&quot; because he just didn&#39;t know what else to do. The<br/>
&quot;charismatic religious leader&quot; they followed for a time seemed almost<br/>
cult-ish, and thinking on his own seemed like something he wasn&#39;t really<br/>
comfortable or experienced in doing. No one - including the father - ever<br/>
believed she&#39;d hurt the children. I imagine he worried that she probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be cooking great meals or interacting much with them, but he<br/>
thought they would be safe and really didn&#39;t know where else to turn to<br/>
get help.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, she did.<br/>
<br/>
The doctor who made the recommendation against any more children was a woman<br/>
and one she had seen a couple of years ago.   And one who really helped her.<br/>
<br/>
The last doctor she saw discharged her from the hospital because she could<br/>
feed and bathe herself.  He also took her off her medication (Haldol or<br/>
something like that) over her objections.  She knew it was helping her.<br/>
A few days after her prescription ran out she killed the children.  That<br/>
doctor is a man and IMO should be on trial with her as an accessory to<br/>
the murders.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684183226">I haven&#39;t read all of the posts, probably. I am a couple of digests behind, <br/>
but wanted to go ahead and put in my two cents.<br/>
<br/>
I think her husband is still in shock and denial. Oprah spoke briefly about <br/>
the stages of grief. He thinks he has accepted it and moved on. My thought <br/>
while watching him yesterday is either he will fall apart several months <br/>
down the road. Or he will be totally immersed in another relationship and <br/>
not have dealt with the tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
They had a clip on her family. They are obviously in the anger and blaming <br/>
stage of grief. It would be difficult not to go there during the grieving <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
I hope he gets there at some point. It&#39;s important to complete all the steps <br/>
of grieving.<br/>

One of the things that bothered me the most was that even after it was recommended she not have anymore by doctor and psychiatrist, *his feeling was that they would continue to have as many as God gave them... HELLO! That and after watching Oprah, the man doesn&#39;t have one emotion, it was very unnerving and I just don&#39;t believe him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289919709">the shrinks and the medical doc (it is in the medical records) recommended<br/>
that she not have more children because the ppd and pyschosis was<br/>
progressive.  They gave them the % and &quot;strongly recommend that Andrea have<br/>
no further children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
According to her family, the father made the decision along with the &quot;cult<br/>
leader&quot; they were seeing and she was coerced into having more children, &quot;the<br/>
Bible says, blah, blah, blah&quot; and &quot;a good Christian would, blah, blah, blah&quot;<br/>
as a means of forcing into getting pregnant again.<br/>
<br/>
The malpractice comes in with the last shrink she was seeing.  The norm is<br/>
to reduce psych drugs, not go cold turkey, particularly when the husband and<br/>
several family members have told the shrink that she is as bad if not worse<br/>
than she was when she was admitted to the psych unit after her last<br/>
pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did he delete a med, he did not prescribe anything to replace it.<br/>
He was asked to give her the shots that had helped her before.  He refused.<br/>
He was asked to admit her to the psych unit, he refused.<br/>
<br/>
Had he done as requested or followed normally accepted medical procedures<br/>
those children would still be alive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456029537">You make a good point here,  Mary.   The mental &quot;health&quot; system is really in<br/>
a bad way these days.  I know the horrible ordeal I went through to get<br/>
insurance approval to see a psychologist regarding our the 6 yr old.  Ours<br/>
was not near a desperate situation.....had it been,  I&#39;m afraid the process<br/>
of getting approved may have driven me over the edge...and by the time we<br/>
jumped through the hoops and got to the appointment,  it would have been too<br/>
late.   In our case,  the issues had been resolved almost cy the time of our<br/>
initial appointment.<br/>
    I though so much during that period about how people with deeper<br/>
problems may not survive this process.  For us,  the issues were basically<br/>
situational......new baby,  exhausted mom,  led to flare-ups with 6 yr olds<br/>
medical problems,   then the mental aspects of us dealing with it.<br/>

<br/>
Living with a mentally ill person does not mean one knows how to manage the<br/>
person or situation well.   From what has been made public,  I see know<br/>
reason why Russell *should have*  or *actually did* know the risks involved.<br/>
    A counselor *may have* known the potential risk.<br/>
reminds me of a situation I once went through while at our local Alzheimer&#39;s<br/>
Association.  A d-i-l  explained a situation about her F-i-l with dementia,<br/>
who was living alone in a four apt bldg.  He had been an electrician and<br/>
seemed to like to &#39;work on&#39; the electrcal equipment for the bldg.<br/>
    She absolutely did not see the danger.  He still seemed proficient with<br/>
his tools....and often was.....however,  she did not know &quot;the illness&quot;  the<br/>
way I did.  Even at the end,  she wasn&#39;t completely convinced of the<br/>
potential danger,   but trusted me enough to allow for my opinion and have<br/>
it checked out.   She agreed to get an thorough medical exam<br/>
(hospitalization)  and he was soon removed from the situation to a safe one.<br/>
<br/>
    I am still profoundly grateful that there was no bureacratic crap for<br/>
her to attain our services.....the outcome could have very likely been<br/>
different.    But there are hardly any services &#39;out there&#39;  for people<br/>
these days.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I often have a problem when the media describes people such as Yates as<br/>
&gt; &quot;Christian&quot; or how about the headline &quot;Homeschooling mother kills<br/>
children&quot; -<br/>
&gt; it almost implies that homeschooling or Christianity had something to do<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think in her case both homeschooling and Christianity did have something<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; do with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if people want to say &quot;NO, it was entirely just because she was<br/>
crazy,&quot;<br/>
&gt; do we want the fallout of the thought that the insanity made her<br/>
homeschool<br/>
&gt; or be Christian?<br/>
