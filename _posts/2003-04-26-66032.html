<br/>
Lets see, there was Skipper, Stacie, Kelly. Then Tutti and Todd.. and then <br/>
another &quot;baby sister&quot; Krissy.   Also, Francie and Jazzie were her cousins.  <br/>
But, just think, counting Barbie, there were 7 children in that family!!.. It <br/>
IS odd that the parents are ever elusive, then again, to make all those <br/>
kids.. maybe they were just always &quot;busy&quot;  LOL<br/>

We have her. It is Midge, Barbie&#39;s best friend. Her husband is Allen and<br/>
they have an older son also (the size of Kelly and Tommy.) They really<br/>
make sure that you know they are married - wedding pictures on the box<br/>
and a tiny silver ring painted on Midge&#39;s finger. The tiny accessories<br/>
are really cute, but easy to lose. It has amazed me the anti-pregnant<br/>
doll reaction from some people. I remember a grocery store cashier<br/>
saying she felt they were disgusting with a look of great distaste - not<br/>
that we had ours with us at the time. She was just voicing her opinion<br/>
because Jayn had another Barbie with her. Jayn loves her Barbies,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, we are not supposed to flaunt being happily pregnant nor nurse <br/>
in public.  We are supposed to hide in shame in the disguting dirty <br/>
public bathrooms or ridiculously small dressing rooms.  I remember <br/>
when me and hubby visited Scotland a few years back their malls had <br/>
acutal baby stations.  An entire, large room devoted to mom.  Huge <br/>
isles of diaper changing areas with bottle warmers and lovely large <br/>
sofas for nursing.  Of course, clean as can be.  What a difference to <br/>
Florida, where apparently nursing moms do not exist.  Let me also <br/>
mention for those of us who had trouble enough, it did not ease our <br/>
transition into public life.  It definitley hampered my experience!  <br/>
Just my little soap box &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; Midge is part of the Happy Family line from the fine folks who<br/>
&gt; bring you Barbie - Midge has a husband, a son, and the new baby<br/>
&gt; girl (maybe even a dog, LOL).  You can still get pregnant Midge<br/>
&gt; from Target.  Apparently folks thought Midge was Barbie - the<br/>
&gt; kids call all of the line Barbies - and Barbie isn&#39;t married.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, Barbie is simply having too much fun!<br/>
 I was at Walmart in NH last week and somebody must have returned one cuz <br/>
there she was Pregnant as can be all alone on the clearance self. I almost <br/>
bought her cuz I knew she wouldn&#39;t be loved there. lol<br/>

chested, and when you cranked her arm around in a circle, she stretched <br/>
taller and her boobs got bigger!  There was a terrible controversy about <br/>
that, and I believe they were pulled from the shelves too.  I&#39;d sure like to <br/>
have one  now...bet they&#39;re worth a pretty penny!<br/>

the Barbie and Ken that lived at our house when my sisters and I were growing <br/>
up frequently &quot;got it on&quot;.. LOL..  .  Well, actually, they got married <br/>
several times too. YEAH, didnt they also sell  Bride Barbie and Groom Ken???? <br/>
Maybe they should sell the pregnant Barbie as &quot; Family Barbie&quot;, along with <br/>
her husband Ken.<br/>
