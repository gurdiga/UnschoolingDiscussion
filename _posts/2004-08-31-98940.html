<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001046432">Sharing.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t believe that by making kids share that they will automatically<br/>
become generous people.  I also think that kids are held to higher standards<br/>
than adults when it comes to sharing.  While an adult wouldn&#39;t generally<br/>
feel compelled to let anyone (let alone a two year old) play with their<br/>
expensive important X, children are expected to share their toys whether or<br/>
not they saved for a year to buy it or not and whether or not they know the<br/>
child or how responsible they are and whether or not they feel quite sure<br/>
that they will get back their item unharmed and whole.  I have never made my<br/>
kids share and I have always let them put away things that they don&#39;t want<br/>
to share before company arrived.  With their close friends, they share<br/>
generously and from the heart.  They know and trust these children and<br/>
sharing isn&#39;t an issue at all. <br/>
 <br/>
Why am I writing?  Because it makes me feel bad under certain circumstances,<br/>
that&#39;s why.  At the conference my dd&#39;s brought their very special (it<br/>
usually takes them 3 months or more to save and buy one with their small<br/>
allowance, without spending it on anything else) Breyer horses.  It was my<br/>
idea.  I thought that other children who like horses might bring theirs and<br/>
they could all play together.  That worked very well with a couple of<br/>
children and they made a couple of friends that way.  They all had their<br/>
horses and they played together and shared.  They even shared with a little<br/>
girl who didn&#39;t have horses because she was respectful of them and their<br/>
stuff and they could feel that.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sadly, though, the horses were a draw to many smaller children who<br/>
continually asked to play with them.  Some children approached them and just<br/>
took their horses.  Another time a teenager who was watching a small child<br/>
told the child to go up and ask *which* horse he could play with, instead of<br/>
asking *if* he could play with one.  It was overwhelming to me and to my<br/>
kids.  My kids didn&#39;t feel safe sharing with the multitude of children who<br/>
all wanted to play with their horses.  They ended up putting them away<br/>
completely or playing with one horse at a time so they wouldn&#39;t have to deal<br/>
with the onslaught of children asking to play with their horses. I felt like<br/>
we were being stalked by one child who kept tracking us down, looking for<br/>
their bags of horses so he could take one.  I just felt awful.  I felt like<br/>
I was hoarding them and hiding them.  But I also felt like it isn&#39;t up to me<br/>
to allow other children to play with my children&#39;s things. (they aren&#39;t mine<br/>
to give permission to use.)   I wasn&#39;t going to dismiss my own children&#39;s<br/>
feelings on the issue and *make* them share or coerce them to share.  I know<br/>
that many people just expect children to share regardless of the<br/>
circumstances and it makes me feel really bad.  It&#39;s still bugging me.   <br/>
 <br/>
I explained to some children that the girls weren&#39;t comfortable sharing<br/>
right now.  If my girls were handling it fine, I let them deal with it.<br/>
Other than feeling frustrated, they did fine telling the other children<br/>
gently, that they didn&#39;t want to play right now or that they weren&#39;t<br/>
comfortable sharing right now.  My kids play best with one or two friends at<br/>
a time.  They just don&#39;t feel comfortable in large groups.  Just coming to<br/>
the conference was stressful to us all.<br/>
 <br/>
I am confident that children should be allowed to choose who they share<br/>
their toys with.  I want to not feel so badly about my choice to let them<br/>
decide.  Do I just need to get a spine?  Feeling bad to some extent, must be<br/>
normal, but I shouldn&#39;t still be thinking about it days later.<br/>
 <br/>
To add to my concern, we came home and dd&#39;s told dh what happened...that<br/>
everyone seemed to want their horses.  They said they put them away instead<br/>
of handing them out to all the kids and he said something to the effect that<br/>
they must have seemed really selfish to have done that.  I&#39;ve talked with<br/>
him about the whole sharing thing.  I mentioned that he wouldn&#39;t just give<br/>
over his laptop or palm pilot to any two year old who wanted to play with<br/>
it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I feel stingy just sending this out to the list.  I&#39;d like to get over it.<br/>
Ideas welcomed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-516017484">I hear you on that one!!! You&#39;re in Maine right? Have you heard of Pam <br/>
Leo? She has a fabulous idea related to sharing at home... she has a <br/>
box of her own toys so when another child comes over, she shares the <br/>
toys in that box. It helps her granddaughter (who she&#39;s raising) to not <br/>
have to share her stuff but many times she does because she chooses to <br/>
which I&#39;m sure feels a whole lot better than being forced!! I never <br/>
feel like a friend&#39;s child should HAVE to share with mine. I really try <br/>
to bring them something of their won to play with in social <br/>
situations...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should worry about it!!! Your daughters have every <br/>
right not to share!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394024850">Sweetie - I wouldn&#39;t make my daughter share her Breyer horses, either <br/>
(maybe only those with that particular love really can understand how <br/>
MUCH they love those plastic forms &lt;G&gt;). But taking them to a <br/>
conference and playing with them in front of other children, but not <br/>
sharing? That&#39;s not the same as just not making them share.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is the equivalent of creating an &quot;attractive nuisance&quot; - I <br/>
know that when my girls were little, if you&#39;d showed up with a bunch of <br/>
Breyer horses, I&#39;d have spent the entire weekend having to tell them, <br/>
&quot;No, those aren&#39;t yours and they don&#39;t want you to play with them.&quot; It <br/>
would have made my own weekend very very difficult.<br/>
<br/>
So - hope you can see it from others&#39; points of view in that way.<br/>

want to share and that that was PERFECTLY okay - but that you don&#39;t <br/>
trot things out in front of other kids and then not share (get the pun? <br/>
&lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Instead, bring things to do - to break the ice and keep them occupied - <br/>
which DO involve sharing - that&#39;s the best way to have fun. I sometimes <br/>
picked up little things at sales - little games or toys - that I could <br/>
put into a bag and bring out at the park or other group activities. <br/>
Since these were things that my kids would have no attachment to, <br/>
they&#39;d be happier sharing. This is something that would help attract <br/>
other kids, give them something to do together, so they&#39;d make friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161172620">I can see where you are coming from, Pam, but I can also see where <br/>
Angela is coming from. Some kids have STRONG attachments to things and <br/>
feel more secure if those things are with them at all times. I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
leave my digital camera at home because it may cause someone to be <br/>
upset if I didn&#39;t want to share it. And I may not be so forthcoming in <br/>
handing it over to a stranger to inspect either... it all depends on my <br/>
vibe from the interested person. I don&#39;t think its asking a lot to <br/>
teach our kids that sometimes others don&#39;t want to share their <br/>
possessions. My daughter Ella (4) has understood that since she was 2. <br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t want to share, she gets it, because she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to share either. I find that kids who are not forced to share are much <br/>
more likely to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153746359">I might rather have brought one favorite for each rather than a <br/>
whole group of them. For one, it&#39;s easier to keep track of in <br/>
general so less stress over things &quot;trotting off&quot; <br/>
accidentally/getting left or lost. And, obviously, if there&#39;s just <br/>
one of a thing and a person doesn&#39;t feel like sharing right then, <br/>
there&#39;s no question. BUT if there are 6 of something and the person <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to share (which is their option), it can get a little <br/>
sticky.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212358267">I try to help my ds have appropriate expectations for different aged <br/>
kids. We&#39;ve talked about how sometimes two year olds have a hard time <br/>
waiting their turn in line at the playground, and how sometimes he <br/>
may just need to let them go first. We talked about how when babies <br/>
like to knock over block towers. And so on. <br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean he has no right to build a block tower without his <br/>
sister knocking it down, just that if they are playing together, it&#39;s <br/>
pretty likely she&#39;s going to knock it down! If it&#39;s important to him <br/>
to build towers, I can distract her or take her elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Today we were going to an LLL meeting and he wanted to take his very <br/>
special teddy bear. I explained why I did not think that would be a <br/>
good idea--if anyone touched it or even asked to see it, he&#39;d get <br/>
very upset. This was the first meeting of this group, so I didn&#39;t <br/>
know who would be there or how many kids or how they&#39;d behave. There <br/>
would be shared toys there, so kids would expect that his bear was to <br/>
be shared also.<br/>
<br/>
With the horses at the conference, I guess I&#39;d say that if they kids <br/>
were in a situation with lots of younger kids, it was going to be <br/>
really hard for them to not be allowed to touch. That they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
understand why the girls didn&#39;t want to share. I&#39;d encourage my kids <br/>
to find something that everyone would enjoy, instead of making some <br/>
people feel left out. Or maybe go somewhere away from the smaller <br/>
kids. I don&#39;t know exactly what, just that I try to model the idea of <br/>
finding something that will work for everyone. I love hearing my ds <br/>
tell other kids &quot;let&#39;s find something to do that makes us both <br/>
happy.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Hope this makes sense...I&#39;m trying to say that sharing/not sharing is <br/>
complicated and I try to go into most situations with other kids <br/>
knowing that we&#39;re going to need to actively work toward a solution <br/>
for that moment, those people, those toys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551326296">Instead, bring things to do - to break the ice and keep them occupied - which DO involve sharing - that&#39;s the best way to have fun. I sometimes picked up little things at sales - little games or toys - that I could put into a bag and bring out at the park or other group activities. Since these were things that my kids would have no attachment to, they&#39;d be happier sharing. This is something that would help attract other kids, give them something to do together, so they&#39;d make friends.<br/>
<br/>
-pam<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve done this for years, at park or playground outings -- even if we don&#39;t know there will be other kids there.  I have a big bag of sand toys, and I&#39;ve recently added a bag with a couple of soft ball & bat sets, some frisbees and a couple of big balls (soccer, etc).  I just toss them out on the ground, and as kids wander by we invite them to play with us.  <br/>
 <br/>
The same could be done with inside toys.  I have boys, so with us it&#39;s HotWheels cars, duplo/lego blocks and the like.  There are some toys almost no kids can resist, and they&#39;re cheap enough to buy enough to share.  We find some of our best stuff at the dollar store or Target, end of season. <br/>
 <br/>
I can understand why the kids wanted to bring their favorite toys.  Maybe you could have brought both the horses, and other less-precious toys to share publicly, saving the horses for smaller playdates with other kids who had horses or who understood the importance of the horses.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619408062">I still agree with Pam.  And I think there is a difference between bringing<br/>
one digital camera and bringing multiple horses and then choosing to share<br/>
with some kids and not with others.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if they only had 1 horse each out at a time -- or does that defeat<br/>
the game?<br/>
<br/>
It does seem to me to be  ....um....I don&#39;t know... unkind(?) to have a<br/>
bunch of somethings that they are playing with in front of other children,<br/>
but not allowing the other children to use.  And especially allowing some<br/>
children to use but not other children.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps buying some horses designated for sharing (we have some we got at<br/>
Red White and Blue) - or even buy one or two with your money that are<br/>
intended for sharing?  Then those could be the sharing horses when other<br/>
kids want to play.  Now that I think about it - we have several Barbies,<br/>
Pollies/Dolls/Stuffed Animals that we have picked up at garage sales/thrift<br/>
stores so that there is a nice selection for other people to be able to play<br/>
without have to have the items that are Lydia&#39;s favorites.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372865573"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Sweetie - I wouldn&#39;t make my daughter share her Breyer horses, <br/>

understand how MUCH they love those plastic forms &lt;G&gt;). But taking <br/>
them to a conference and playing with them in front of other <br/>
children, but not sharing? That&#39;s not the same as just not making <br/>
them share.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was my first thought too. I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; my kids share <br/>
everything either. Don&#39;t beat yourself up over that. I doubt you <br/>
appeared stingy. But next time you might want to reconsider bringing <br/>
tresured items to group settings. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve told my kids over <br/>
the years. They should try to bring what they feel comfortable <br/>
sharing. In this case, they could have even brought their horses to <br/>
play with in their room, but left them there when venturing out to <br/>
play in the group.<br/>

 -------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>
 <br/>
I think perhaps we figured out the best course as it all unfolded and I just<br/>
need to stop feeling bad about it.  (I talked with a friend about it this<br/>
afternoon and that helped me gain some perspective.)   In the end, the girls<br/>
kept out one horse at a time after we realized that it was causing a<br/>
problem.  That seemed to help. (But yeah, when they really get into playing,<br/>
they all have a bunch of horses to play with.) <br/>
 <br/>
I understand what you are saying about buying some for a group to share, but<br/>
that isn&#39;t realistic for us because they cost so much.  The Traditional<br/>
Breyers start at about $30 each and go up.  (not quite the same as match<br/>
boxes or something.)   If it were a continual problem, I might invest in<br/>
them, but this situation comes up so rarely that it wouldn&#39;t be worth it to<br/>
me.  Just going to the conference was stretching our budget, a lot.  We<br/>
could have gotten some cheap dollar store horses to share, but I think the<br/>
difference in the horses would be so glaringly obvious that the kids might<br/>
still have felt left out.  (I think I have issues with pleasing everyone all<br/>
the time.   I didn&#39;t want anyone to feel bad or left out but I wanted my<br/>
kids to be happy and feel safe with their stuff too.)<br/>
 <br/>
We also could have brought things that weren&#39;t so personal, but the whole<br/>
idea was to meet some other children who like the same things so they could<br/>
have a real connection.  My girls live to ride horses and play with their<br/>
Breyer horses.<br/>
 <br/>
My girls have always been quite reserved around people they don&#39;t know, so<br/>
it comes as a surprise to me (it probably shouldn&#39;t, I&#39;ve lived long enough<br/>
to learn) when children approach us ready to join right in or just even just<br/>
take things.  Different personalities, I think, but having my little ones<br/>
take other kid&#39;s toys wasn&#39;t ever an issue, so I didn&#39;t really think of it<br/>
ahead of time.  We don&#39;t do group things very often because the girls just<br/>
aren&#39;t comfortable in group settings. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you all for your responses.  <br/>

thought it would help break the ice. She said: &quot; At the conference my <br/>
dd&#39;s brought their very special (it<br/>

allowance, without spending it on anything else) Breyer horses.  It was <br/>
my<br/>
idea.  I thought that other children who like horses might bring theirs <br/>
and<br/>
they could all play together. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - mom suggested that they bring them in order to play with other <br/>
kids. But, I&#39;m saying that is not a good choice for that purpose - if <br/>
the goal is to have some fun playing with other kids, don&#39;t bring <br/>
something that you don&#39;t want to share, bring something specifically TO <br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
My kids would have left her kids alone - gazing longingly at the horses <br/>
from a distance &lt;G&gt;. But, they&#39;d also have quietly thought to <br/>
themselves that those were not very nice kids, to bring something so <br/>
wonderful out and play with it right in front of them, but refuse to <br/>
share, and they very liekly wouldn&#39;t want to have anything much to do <br/>
with them after that.<br/>

----------------------------<br/>
Actually, on the Live and Learn list I mentioned that the girls were<br/>
bringing their horses and if any other girls enjoyed Breyers, would they be<br/>
interested in bringing them and playing together.  I said that I thought it<br/>
would be a good ice breaker.  So yes, a couple other girls planned and<br/>
brought theirs and they played together well.  <br/>

------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
I understand what you are suggesting, but I don&#39;t think it would work for my<br/>
kids. They don&#39;t feel comfortable playing in groups and so something like a<br/>
group game sounds good on paper, but wouldn&#39;t work for us.  They&#39;d still be<br/>
sitting on my leg looking miserable.  (They are 9.5 and almost 8, btw.)<br/>
Hence the idea to find a common denominator between my girls and one or two<br/>
other girls, rather than a large group. I thought planning ahead was the<br/>
ticket.  Saturday night we actually were invited to eat dinner with another<br/>
family who brought Breyer horses and it was a wonderful time.  The girls<br/>
really connected and we mom&#39;s had a good time too.  But the time I was<br/>
trying to fill was the time spent sitting listening to speakers.  I just<br/>
wanted them to have something to do while I listened to stuff that held no<br/>
interest to them.  They don&#39;t do workbooks.  ;0)<br/>
 <br/>
A group activity wouldn&#39;t have worked for my kids, but bringing out one<br/>
horse at a time seems like a solution we could all live with.   I just wish<br/>
I&#39;d thought of the problem that might be caused by the horses, ahead of<br/>
time, so I could have planned better<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135415972">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I like the whole idea Jessie shared about having an extra set of things to<br/>
share for - One set that is their own and one to share. It kind of goes hand<br/>
in hand with my approach to toys and things that are important to my boys. I<br/>
try to as much as I can to buy things in 3&#39;s or when requesting that someone<br/>
get Christmas presents etc. buy 3 of the same thing for all 3 of my boys.<br/>
That way none of them HAVE to share unless they want to. I admit this is<br/>
harder for bigger ticket items like Nintendo etc. BUT by them having their<br/>
own sets of things for the smaller priced items, it has made it so my boys<br/>
feel like they are valued and have their own special things and they have<br/>
been much more willing to share with friends that way or amongst themselves<br/>
for the bigger ticket items as well as the smaller priced items too if they<br/>
feel that they are valued enough as a person to have their own things and<br/>
not forced to share if the do not choose to.<br/>
 <br/>
I do not believe in forcing my children to share either. I think that makes<br/>
them in the long run resentful and less willing to share as they grow and as<br/>
they journey into adulthood. For myself, as an adult, there are things that<br/>
I share and there are things that I choose not to at times, and I feel that<br/>
this is ok and it is not meant in the context of taunting like I have<br/>
something I am not gonna share ha ha kind of thing, but merely that I have<br/>
things that are personal just to me and that I should not be made to have to<br/>
share all of my things all of the time only when I wish to. Children should<br/>
be given the same freedom to choose whether to share or not, provided that<br/>
it is not done in a taunting fashion. This should not be different just<br/>
because they are children. <br/>
<br/>
I do not feel that what you where trying to do with your kids Angie was at<br/>
least from what you wrote, I do not think you were or your children where<br/>
doing this, in a taunting manner. I can see where it may have been hard for<br/>
the other children who wished to also play with what your children were<br/>
playing with, so having a second set of the same toy if feasible is an<br/>
excellent option to ease this type of a situation and also to open the door<br/>
to IF your children want to then share their set of toys, they can, or they<br/>
could just simply play with their set and the other children play together<br/>
with them with the second duplicate set.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel that because of me not forcing them to share my children are much<br/>
more willing to share and do share. more often than not.  An example of this<br/>
just recently was when my middle son, Matthew, who just turned 8 today, whom<br/>
even though he had lost his new gameboy advanced sp at a homeschooling event<br/>
 still wished to give not just share but actually give as a gift of<br/>
friendship and love, his other older gameboy to a friend of his whom did not<br/>
have one, even though he knew that he would then have no gameboy.  His<br/>
comments to me were &quot;I want to give this to my friend because I know he does<br/>
not have one and even though I do not have one now, once my gameboy has been<br/>
found, maybe he and I will be able to play together gameboys because then we<br/>
will both have one!&quot;.He did this of his own volition and I was very proud of<br/>
him for being so loving, generous, and kind.<br/>
<br/>
So, I want my kids to share because they want to, not because of me or<br/>
someone else forcing them too. And this idea for an extra set of toys seems<br/>
like a great way to balance the idea of giving our children the choice to<br/>
share and also making it so that other children do not feel like they are<br/>
tormented by not being able to play with something they wish to.<br/>

Subject: Re: Sharing Again<br/>
 <br/>
I hear you on that one!!! You&#39;re in Maine right? Have you heard of Pam<br/>
Leo? She has a fabulous idea related to sharing at home... she has a<br/>
box of her own toys so when another child comes over, she shares the<br/>
toys in that box. It helps her granddaughter (who she&#39;s raising) to not<br/>
have to share her stuff but many times she does because she chooses to<br/>
which I&#39;m sure feels a whole lot better than being forced!! I never<br/>
feel like a friend&#39;s child should HAVE to share with mine. I really try<br/>
to bring them something of their won to play with in social<br/>
situations...<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think you should worry about it!!! Your daughters have every<br/>
right not to share!!<br/>
:)<br/>

&gt; Sharing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I don&#39;t believe that by making kids share that they will automatically<br/>
&gt;  become generous people.  I also think that kids are held to higher<br/>
&gt; standards<br/>
&gt;  than adults when it comes to sharing.  While an adult wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; generally<br/>
&gt;  feel compelled to let anyone (let alone a two year old) play with<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt;  expensive important X, children are expected to share their toys<br/>
&gt; whether or<br/>
&gt;  not they saved for a year to buy it or not and whether or not they<br/>
&gt; know the<br/>
&gt;  child or how responsible they are and whether or not they feel quite<br/>
&gt; sure<br/>
&gt;  that they will get back their item unharmed and whole.  I have never<br/>
&gt; made my<br/>
&gt;  kids share and I have always let them put away things that they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt;  to share before company arrived.  With their close friends, they share<br/>
&gt;  generously and from the heart.  They know and trust these children and<br/>
&gt;  sharing isn&#39;t an issue at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Why am I writing?  Because it makes me feel bad under certain<br/>
&gt; circumstances,<br/>
&gt;  that&#39;s why.  At the conference my dd&#39;s brought their very special (it<br/>
&gt;  usually takes them 3 months or more to save and buy one with their<br/>
&gt; small<br/>
&gt;  allowance, without spending it on anything else) Breyer horses.  It<br/>
&gt; was my<br/>
&gt;  idea.  I thought that other children who like horses might bring<br/>
&gt; theirs and<br/>
&gt;  they could all play together.  That worked very well with a couple of<br/>
&gt;  children and they made a couple of friends that way.  They all had<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt;  horses and they played together and shared.  They even shared with a<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt;  girl who didn&#39;t have horses because she was respectful of them and<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt;  stuff and they could feel that. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Sadly, though, the horses were a draw to many smaller children who<br/>
&gt;  continually asked to play with them.  Some children approached them<br/>
&gt; and just<br/>
&gt;  took their horses.  Another time a teenager who was watching a small<br/>
&gt; child<br/>
&gt;  told the child to go up and ask *which* horse he could play with,<br/>
&gt; instead of<br/>
&gt;  asking *if* he could play with one.  It was overwhelming to me and to<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt;  kids.  My kids didn&#39;t feel safe sharing with the multitude of<br/>
&gt; children who<br/>
&gt;  all wanted to play with their horses.  They ended up putting them away<br/>
&gt;  completely or playing with one horse at a time so they wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to deal<br/>
&gt;  with the onslaught of children asking to play with their horses. I<br/>
&gt; felt like<br/>
&gt;  we were being stalked by one child who kept tracking us down, looking<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt;  their bags of horses so he could take one.  I just felt awful.  I<br/>
&gt; felt like<br/>
&gt;  I was hoarding them and hiding them.  But I also felt like it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; up to me<br/>
&gt;  to allow other children to play with my children&#39;s things. (they<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t mine<br/>
&gt;  to give permission to use.)   I wasn&#39;t going to dismiss my own<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  feelings on the issue and *make* them share or coerce them to share. <br/>
&gt; I know<br/>
&gt;  that many people just expect children to share regardless of the<br/>
&gt;  circumstances and it makes me feel really bad.  It&#39;s still bugging<br/>
&gt; me.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I explained to some children that the girls weren&#39;t comfortable<br/>
&gt; sharing<br/>
&gt;  right now.  If my girls were handling it fine, I let them deal with<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;  Other than feeling frustrated, they did fine telling the other<br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt;  gently, that they didn&#39;t want to play right now or that they weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  comfortable sharing right now.  My kids play best with one or two<br/>
&gt; friends at<br/>
&gt;  a time.  They just don&#39;t feel comfortable in large groups.  Just<br/>
&gt; coming to<br/>
&gt;  the conference was stressful to us all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I am confident that children should be allowed to choose who they<br/>
&gt; share<br/>
&gt;  their toys with.  I want to not feel so badly about my choice to let<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt;  decide.  Do I just need to get a spine?  Feeling bad to some extent,<br/>
&gt; must be<br/>
&gt;  normal, but I shouldn&#39;t still be thinking about it days later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  To add to my concern, we came home and dd&#39;s told dh what<br/>
&gt; happened...that<br/>
&gt;  everyone seemed to want their horses.  They said they put them away<br/>
&gt; instead<br/>
&gt;  of handing them out to all the kids and he said something to the<br/>
&gt; effect that<br/>
&gt;  they must have seemed really selfish to have done that.  I&#39;ve talked<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt;  him about the whole sharing thing.  I mentioned that he wouldn&#39;t just<br/>
&gt; give<br/>
&gt;  over his laptop or palm pilot to any two year old who wanted to play<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt;  it. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I feel stingy just sending this out to the list.  I&#39;d like to get<br/>
&gt; over it.<br/>
&gt;  Ideas welcomed.<br/>

There were lots of fun shops but the kids don&#39;t like group activities and<br/>
they were overwhelmed by the amount of people.  And no, they wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
gone without me.  They&#39;d have been happy if we hadn&#39;t gone at all and I just<br/>
bought tapes.  It would have been cheaper too, but for some reason, I just<br/>
wanted to be there.  To see people&#39;s faces and here their voices.  It<br/>
changes this whole email exchange for me when I know what a person looks and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102105293">We could replace the word &quot;horse&quot; with &quot;Yu-gi-oh Cards&quot; or &quot;video <br/>
game system&quot; or anything else and I think the results would be the <br/>
same.  Some kid will bring something precious to them that they only <br/>
want to share with other kids who know the value of the item, and <br/>
some little kid will want to join in.  That little kid might be <br/>
totally inappropriate for the game or toy, but they want to join to <br/>
be part of the group.  It would not seem selfish to me if the bigger <br/>
kid/owner of the toy would just turn to the little kid and be nice <br/>
and maybe even talk for a minute, but not share the item.  I think <br/>
any kid of any age has been the little kid at one time or another <br/>
and it doesn&#39;t feel good to be left out.  This is a great lesson in <br/>
empathy and respect on both sides.<br/>

Absolutely!! I&#39;m just suggesting the idea that we might have to miss <br/>
a speaker or two in favor of going to all the stuff besides the <br/>
speakers. And for just the reasons you gave. The speakers are usually <br/>
wonderful, but accompanying a kid around to help foster connections <br/>
while you maybe chat with another mom of a kind of introverted <br/>
unschooler...well that&#39;s good too. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724335214">&lt;&lt;&lt;So do you think we just shouldn&#39;t have brought them at all or kept them<br/>
in our room?  I do understand how difficult it was for the other kids.<br/>
That&#39;s why I feel so badly.  It was also the only idea that I had (a way to<br/>
break the ice) to help my own children find someone to play with that they<br/>
would have a common interest with.  I can&#39;t imagine them not having<br/>
something to do while I listened to all the speakers. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had read a lot of posts about Breyer horses coming to the conference with<br/>
their owners, and certainly got the idea that these were slightly older<br/>
girls - in the 7/8/9 range - and that there were quite a lot of them with<br/>
this hobby. Nevertheless I suggested to Jayn (4.5) that she bring along her<br/>
Fisher Price horse and a couple of riders just in case she was able to hook<br/>
up with some groups. That didn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
We also brought along a collection of Barbies with clothes in the hope of<br/>
finding some girls to play with them - a maneuver that was largely<br/>
successful. At first she wanted to leave them in our room, and invite people<br/>
to play there, (she and Ella had a great time on several occasions) but<br/>
later she was willing to bring the whole shebang downstairs and use them as<br/>
a lure for the like-minded. I suggested that she only bring down to the<br/>
foyer area those toys she was willing to share, and that worked well for<br/>
her, and turned out to be all of them.<br/>
<br/>
Last year at the conference Jayn was adopted by the lovely Heather, who I<br/>
guess was 11 at the time. Jayn followed her around, with me in the distance,<br/>
and Heather was very patient and kind. This year Jayn had the unfortunate<br/>
experience of going up to a number of different girls, older than she is but<br/>
clearly younger than Heather had been, and asking if they wanted to play<br/>
with her, and being told &quot;No&quot; quite a lot, always pleasantly and sometimes<br/>
with a long reason why not. She was only in tears once, at the end of a long<br/>
day, when someone had said &quot;Maybe later&quot; and Jayn decided that it was<br/>
&quot;later&quot; and so where was the girl. She wanted to wait in the hallway all<br/>
night for her. Jayn will just go up to any girl and invite her to play.<br/>
She&#39;s like that at the park too.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn was in heaven a few times when a small group of girls, I&#39;m guessing<br/>
about 7 or 8 yo, I think Keira (sp?) and Hannah were in that group, kindly<br/>
took her around with them for a while. They kept her with them longer than I<br/>
would have expected. It is tough when you have a tenacious and oblivious 4yo<br/>
that you just can&#39;t easily ditch. <br/>
<br/>
For some reason we had a hard time finding many other 4-5 yo&#39;s. Most folks<br/>
seemed either older or younger. Luckily Jayn and Ella found each other, and<br/>
being on the same floor made it even easier. Jayn is looking forward to<br/>
sending some drawings to her. She also hooked up with Jessie from San<br/>
Francisco, and hopes to have an ongoing relationship with her also.<br/>
