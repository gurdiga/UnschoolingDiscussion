<div id="ygrps-yiv-566921034">You might recommend she read the book &quot;Stealing Jesus&quot;.  It points out how<br/>
the Conservative Fundamentalist &quot;My way or the highway&quot; Christian movement<br/>
have hijacked Jesus&#39; teachings.  It also suggests that Jesus supported doing<br/>
away with any of the rules or laws that tended to separate people rather<br/>
than bring them together.  It also suggests that the few places in the Bible<br/>
where Jesus proscribed behavior are viewed by scholars as things that have<br/>
been added in over the centuries.  Not things actually attributed to Jesus<br/>
by theological scholars.<br/>
