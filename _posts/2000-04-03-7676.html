<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762991228">Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not Stephenie but I thought I&#39;d let you know that I&#39;ve been using <br/>
alladvantage for a long time now.  I make about $20 a month.  There are also <br/>
other programs that you can use along with it...including this email program.  <br/>
If anyone is interested I can send them an email with all the different <br/>
programs I belong to.  It makes sense to make money if you&#39;re going to be <br/>
online anyway.  They just pay you part of the ad money they collect.  It&#39;d be <br/>
great if tv worked this way.  :)<br/>
