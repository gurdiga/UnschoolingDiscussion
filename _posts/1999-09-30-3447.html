<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019631290"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Jesus wasn&#39;t even born in December or anywhere near December for that<br/>
&gt;matter.  The whole Christmas celebration came about as Christianity spread<br/>
&gt;through Europe. When the Church started converting the cultures and tribes<br/>
&gt;they would many times integrate parts of the culture into the Christian<br/>
&gt;traditions so as to make the conversion more smooth, easy. It was supposed<br/>
&gt;to make it easier to convert folks but what it really did was  compromise<br/>
&gt;Christianity and clutter it up with a bunch of pagan ritual. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Speaking from a Pagan perspective, I always appreciate it when those of<br/>
varying religions, particularly Christians, are educated and open minded<br/>
enough to acknowledge the roots of this holiday, and the fact that many<br/>
popular traditions in modern America stem from those original roots.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;as it stands now we still hold to some of the basic Christmas traditions<br/>
 </span></blockquote>such as a &gt;tree<br/>
<br/>
The tradition of bringing an evergreen tree indoors stems from a number of<br/>
European traditions, but it&#39;s meaning is clear enough.  It is the<br/>
representation of Life within the season of the &quot;little death&quot; or winter.<br/>
Christmas (or Yule) is the celebration of the Winter Solstice, which is the<br/>
longest night and shortest day of the year.  As such it is the clebration<br/>
of the birth/rebirth of the Sun god in many many cultures around the world,<br/>
because the days grow longer from the Winter Solstice on until the Wheel of<br/>
the Year turns at the Summer Solstice.  The word Yule is believed to come<br/>
from the old Norse word &quot;Iul&quot; which means: Wheel.<br/>
<br/>
It was naturally logical for the Christains to choose the time of so many<br/>
other religions&#39; Sun God birth as the time for the Birth of the Son of God.<br/>
 The Christian church adopted midwinter and the Winter Solstice as the<br/>
birth of Christ in 273 AD, for the reasons Mary mentioned (conversion) but<br/>
also for another reason.  As St Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople a<br/>
century later explained:  &quot;The Nativity of the &#39;Sun of Righteousness&#39; had<br/>
been so fixed in order that while the heathen were busied with their<br/>
profane rights, the Christians might perform their holy ones without<br/>
disturbance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;ever notice, &#39;Deck the Halls&#39; is not a Christmas song but a Yule<br/>
&gt;song?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We do not do Santa (or that bunny or fairy either) just cause it is like<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lying. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I think of Santa as the embodiment of the spirit of giving.  A jolly<br/>
elf who represents the joy of sharing.  When the children outgrow the<br/>
belief of Santa as a reality, they become part of the tradition of playing<br/>
Santa.  We all do stockings here, including adults, and have a lot of fun<br/>
with it.  Santa is part of the magic of the season, which is a celebration<br/>
of life and loved ones, and a reaffirmation that spring will come again,<br/>
bringing the warmth of the Sun with it.<br/>

I could highlight and copy your whole post and say &quot;well said&quot;!<br/>
I don&#39;t think it really matters when Christ was born, it is the one specific <br/>
time that the world can come to a something close to peace.  I love Santa, it <br/>
is fun, but hey, I was raised in a time when we had a haunted house in the <br/>
basement of our church.  Halloween was a time of fun and joy for the kids, <br/>
and people weren&#39;t lecturing us that it was the celebration of Satan,  maybe <br/>
in other countries it was, but it was never that intent here and as a child <br/>
we had such fun, dressing up and getting free candy, and roaming for hours <br/>
outside, at night! by ourselves!  Can&#39;t do that today.  Wow, how did I get to <br/>
Halloween from Christmas? LOL,  To get back to the point, Christmas for us is <br/>
a beautiful time, your family makes it what it is, and you do what you want.  <br/>
I love the hustle and bustle, the carols and everything that goes with it.  <br/>
Heck, my boys were born, Dec 3 and Dec 24.  We have a joint birthday party <br/>
the second weekend of Dec.  We have friends and family, at our home, the kids <br/>
play all day inside, outside, where ever.  The parents then have their party <br/>
in the evening, and I usually end up with about 7or 8 little boys spending <br/>
the night and half the next day.  We just hang out, cook burgers on the <br/>
grill, order pizza the next day.  It is a fun time for all the families.  <br/>
Sorry, seems I am replying to everybody&#39;s posts on holidays and bday parties!<br/>
