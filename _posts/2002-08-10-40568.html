<div id="ygrps-yiv-664285333">I don&#39;t know where but I would try this. Call the company or search through<br/>
some of the academic sales places online to see if they have &quot;academic<br/>
pricing&quot; for this program. I just found out that Adope Photoshop 7 which<br/>
would cost me about $650 locally can be had for about $280 through academic<br/>
pricing. Each product has different rules. SOmetimes you need to be a school<br/>
but I started seeing that many of these (expensive ) programs are also sold<br/>
to homeschoolers for that price!!!<br/>
Also I saw some on ebay.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few stores online -these were sites recommended by a company that<br/>
has plugins for Adobe Photoshop. I don&#39;t think they have what you need but<br/>
this is good info for all interested in getting what they are buying at a<br/>
lower cost.<br/>

This site has a classroom program of Hooked on Phonics but looks more<br/>
expensive as there is more than one copy. You might call them and ask if<br/>
they have a single copy at academic prcing or the company itself.<br/>

&gt; store around that sold it at least we could save the shipping & handling.<br/>
&gt; Also, do you know anyone who has used it?<br/>
