<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m also on the Olympic Peninsula, west side of Port<br/>
&gt;Angeles.  Nanci, were you at the homeschool<br/>
&gt;get-together at the beach in Port Townsend a couple<br/>
&gt;months ago?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cheryl.  Are you on the PHEnet mailing list?  We<br/>
just recently moved to the Olympic Peninsula, after<br/>
years of planning and maneuvering to get there.  We<br/>
love the area.  No we didn&#39;t make the Fall Gathering,<br/>
although I was much looking forward to it, and planned<br/>
to go early and help Lauren get the fire going.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband Tom was in a major car accident on the<br/>
Eastern side of the state (where he works during the<br/>
week) on Nov. 7th.  So the kids and I packed up and<br/>
left town the next morning to be with him.  We are<br/>
still here.  <br/>
<br/>
His broken bones are well on the mend now and he is<br/>
getting around better.  So we will be trying to get<br/>
another commutting car for him this weekend, to<br/>
replace the one that was totally beyond recovery, and<br/>
hopefully get the boys and I home in the next week or<br/>
two.  We are desperate to get home, and sick of living<br/>
at my parent&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
We have 16 acres of cedar woods above the shores of<br/>
Larson Lake, North of Quilcene.  We are about 15<br/>
minutes South of PT, and we do all our shopping at the<br/>
Co-Op there.  I keep trying to get together with some<br/>
of the folks from PHEnet and meet some local friends,<br/>
but circumstances keep preventing it.  Maybe we could<br/>
get together after we get back into town?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just love Port Townsend.  We do our grocery shopping<br/>
there on the weekends at the Co-Op, but I love to shop<br/>
at the little stores downtown as well.  Rising<br/>
Phoenix, Sand Castle, and Wild Sage are some of my<br/>
favorites.  We love all the wonderful restaurants too.<br/>
 You won&#39;t find a Denny&#39;s there, but you will find<br/>
quirky, original little restaurants with lots of<br/>
personality and local color, and a ton of fresh<br/>
seafood.  We often take the kids to Chetzamoka park<br/>
after we do our shopping, or to play at one of the<br/>
many little beaches off Water Street.<br/>
