around their kids all the time, and I wonder if there&#39;s something wrong with <br/>
me.  I do like a break.  One of my unschooling friends is doing a kind of a <br/>
kids-day-out a couple of times a month for a few families, and she did her <br/>
first one yesterday.  My kids had a blast and so did I.  I spent most of the <br/>
time in the library -- the adult fiction section, no less!  That&#39;s my idea of <br/>
pampering myself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our county parks dept. came up with a great idea (what a surprise).  They<br/>
offer HS Sports Day once a week, 9-11:30 for the kids (K-5) to do team/group<br/>
type sport and swimming.  The cost is $15 per month.  The staff mentioned<br/>
the kids don&#39;t know the team sports rules but they only have to tell them<br/>
once.  They are well behaved, everyone plays together and polite.  While<br/>
their after-school program they play by age groups, constantly ask questions<br/>
& probably don&#39;t know the phrase &quot;thank you&quot;.</div>

I think I remember where that is!  :)  I definitely need a little break (if <br/>
only a nice, soaky bath) every once in a while.<br/>
