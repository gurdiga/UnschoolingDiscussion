<div id="ygrps-yiv-618038777">I am going back to the cleaning thing , because I read all the things people <br/>
wrote and have a story to share.<br/>
Today asked my son if he would like me to help him tidy up his room.<br/>
Formerly I would have said it was a dump and I was going to clean it up.<br/>
He said no. I said ok and walked away. He was amazed. He changed his mind and <br/>
asked for help. We entered it and commenced cleaning together. I did not <br/>
grumble, did not ask why it was so messy, nor did I insult his room. We <br/>
chatted, and I asked where he wanted things. Instead of threateniing to get <br/>
rid of things, I simply put them away as instructed. I did ask permission to <br/>
throw away obvious garbage. Even the toddler sister was involved. It was fun. <br/>
Even the much disliked little neighbor girl was welcomed and involved. WE got <br/>
the mammoth job done with no fuss.<br/>
Right up until the moment I looked in the underwear drawer and saw a bunch of <br/>
beyblades and roboriders.I had a hairy fit and demanded they be removed.<br/>
My wonderful son stated adamantly that they would stay there, he liked them <br/>
there and that ws that.<br/>
I swallowed , agreed, and thanked him for sticking up for himself,  and left <br/>
his room alone!!<br/>
This was a big change for me, as the voice of my mother usually takes over <br/>
when cleaning this 7yr olds room. I like the new way better.<br/>
A small thing maybe, but bigger things will come of it I am sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787008730">I am learning more and more about the idea of unschooling every day. I<br/>
was wondering if any of you have any comments or opinions on the<br/>
Charlotte Mason method of homeschooling. When I first read about it I<br/>
really liked the idea - but now I&#39;m wondering if it isn&#39;t too contrived.<br/>
There are long lists of things to do each day. Wondering if any of you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701157311">I have read a lot about Charlotte Mason&#39;s method.  There are a lot of<br/>
really great ideas, like nature journals and using living books instead<br/>
of texts.  I also loved the idea of using travel guides for geography.<br/>
I love to read, so I liked that it was literature-based.  I also loved<br/>
the ideas about going outside more and having nature walks.  But when it<br/>
comes right down to it, I can&#39;t imagine getting up in the morning,<br/>
setting a timer and saying, &quot;Twenty minutes for reading, then we&#39;ll do<br/>
math, then a nature walk, etc.&quot;  That just isn&#39;t my style.  And though<br/>
the nature journals sound like fun, what if my kids don&#39;t want to do<br/>
them?  I bought a great book on nature journaling for myself, because I<br/>
realized *I* was the one who liked the idea!  And all the reading -<br/>
it&#39;ll be great if my sons want to read classic literature.  But if they<br/>
don&#39;t, that&#39;s their personality.  I can read Treasure Island and the<br/>
Chronicles of Narnia to myself, since I&#39;m the one who likes them.  If<br/>
they&#39;re interested, great.  If not, I&#39;ll still enjoy reading the books.<br/>
I think the schedules were what really turned me off to the Charlotte<br/>
Mason method.  I&#39;m just not a schedule person.  And the fact that it<br/>
could take 12 weeks to read a novel because you&#39;re only reading for 20<br/>
minutes before going on to the next subject.  I couldn&#39;t enjoy a book<br/>
over 12 weeks.  I read with my kids by piling a bunch of pillows onto<br/>
the bed and camping out for an afternoon (or morning, or evening).<br/>
Charlotte Mason had a lot of great ideas to make schools better for<br/>
kids, but it&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29011680">Hello all,<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list. I&#39;ve been lurking for a bit just getting to know you <br/>
all. I&#39;m a mom to nine. I&#39;m not a strict unschooler per se. And I&#39;m a bit <br/>
ambivalent about that. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I think contrived might be a good word for Charlotte Mason. I agree with a <br/>
lot of what she said in theory. But don&#39;t agree with a lot of it too. One <br/>
big thing CM liked was short lessons. Maybe 15 minutes on a subject and <br/>
then move on. This was so that kids didn&#39;t get tired of an activity. But <br/>
mine barely have time to get into something in 15 minutes. I like letting <br/>
them direct the amount of time they spend in things. Even books are read in <br/>
very short bites. I think this was so children had time to ruminate on the <br/>
books between sessions. But again, it&#39;s awful to quit just when you really <br/>
get into it.<br/>
<br/>
But she did respect children as people, not little vessels to be filled <br/>
with knowledge. And she did believe they needed a lot of time outdoors to <br/>
explore rather than being stuck in a school room.<br/>
<br/>
So while her list may have been long, &quot;school&quot; time was to be short because <br/>
she thought they ought to be outside. But yes, most of this was organized <br/>
and led by the teacher or mother or caregiver rather than the child.<br/>
<br/>
But like anything else, if you treat it like a cafeteria, taking what you <br/>
like and leaving what you don&#39;t, the CM method might have some good things <br/>
for you--at least some reassurances for the parent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710810018">I agree with you. I never did get what the purpose of narration would<br/>
be. <br/>
 <br/>
When we read I often ask my daughter questions about the book, but more<br/>
in a conversational way. I&#39;ve noticed that she often misses many aspects<br/>
of the story. I might think her comprehension is lacking - but the truth<br/>
is she is very focused on other aspects of the story - the aspects of it<br/>
that really interest her.<br/>
 <br/>
When I thought about that with her I thought of how when I was in school<br/>
and they&#39;d do those comprehension tests I always had to wonder who could<br/>
REALLY pay attention to every single detail. I thought they were dumb<br/>
tests. Then again, most tests are.<br/>
