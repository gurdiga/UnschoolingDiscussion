<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587407358">Below is another &quot;either or&quot; message, and in case any of you are interested <br/>
and see this before it&#39;s aired...<br/>
<br/>
-=-In the last few weeks, media interest started soaring following reports in <br/>
USA Today and on CNN. In the last 72 hours a profound wave of interest has <br/>
erupted across the global stage. Tomorrow morning (Monday November 21st) at <br/>
8.06am eastern time, ABC&#39;s Good Morning America is scheduled to feature a segment <br/>
on the Indigo children and the Indigo Evolution documentary.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-On the one hand, we have experts claiming that the Indigo phenomenon is <br/>
nothing more than some parents’ attempts to excuse and explain away dysfun<br/>
ctional behavior. On the other hand, we have experts claiming that there is real <br/>
solid evidence that today’s children are more intelligent and more multi-sensory <br/>
than previous generations.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two choices, and if it seems today&#39;s children are more <br/>
multi-sensory and more intelligent, maybe it&#39;s just because people are finally <br/>
starting to LISTEN to children and not just tell them to shut up.<br/>
<br/>
The Indigo Children stuff is being shoved out front in kind of sneaky ways.   <br/>
  Christmas catalogs are coming, and one called &quot;Explorations: Visions of the <br/>
Past * Memories of the Future&quot; came.   On the first page of the &quot;Enlightened <br/>
Entertainment&quot; section it shows three DVDs:   <br/>
Whale Rider, Dead Poets Society and Indigo.<br/>
That pretty much sets that up as the equal of those movies.   <br/>
<br/>
Indigo is a documentary from this year, making weird claims, and created by <br/>
the people who run the magazine.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s someone else making money making spurious claims, and not very useful <br/>
claims either.<br/>
<br/>
At one point it seemed there was interest there about homeschooling, and I <br/>
was asked to write an article for them.   I didn&#39;t know or care at the time what <br/>
their claims were, because it wasn&#39;t going to make any difference in how I <br/>
wrote about homeschooling.   Turned out, though, they were basically using me to <br/>
get to unschoolers and homeschoolers for their magazine subscription base.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s yet another thing that&#39;s about money first.   And it&#39;s the ULTIMATE in <br/>
labelling children superior to others.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, it&#39;s weird and it&#39;s on TV Monday morning, and there&#39;s information <br/>
critical of the proponents and iniators of the Indigo Children stuff here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430398158">Another false dichotomy, this time from an article here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://skepdic.com/indigo.html">http://skepdic.com/indigo.html</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-The hype and near-hysteria surrounding the use of Ritalin has contributed <br/>
to an atmosphere that makes it possible for a book like Indigo Children to be <br/>
taken seriously. Given the choice, who wouldn&#39;t rather believe their children <br/>
are special and chosen for some high mission rather than that they have a <br/>
brain disorder?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those two extremes are FAR from being the only two choices.   &quot;ADD&quot; (whatever <br/>
bundle of indicators you want to think of) is NOT &quot;a brain disorder.&quot;   But <br/>
it not being a brain disorder in no way means that those with the symptoms <br/>
identify superior, more evolved beings from another planet.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t have much to do with unschooling directly, but because there&#39;s a <br/>
big blitz and they&#39;ll be on TV, it will be coming up in discussions, I&#39;m <br/>
afraid.    A few years back before I knew how nutty it all was, just knew there <br/>
was a new new-age magazine coming out about kids, I wrote something for them.   <br/>
They didn&#39;t put it in the magazine (for which I&#39;m relieved), it was on the <br/>
website (but isn&#39;t anymore, for which I&#39;m relieved).   <br/>
<br/>
Somehow they discovered the existence of the Live and Learn conference, and b<br/>
asically saw homeschoolers as a market for their magazine, I think.    (A <br/>
quote that accidently came appended to another e-mail was this:   <br/>
]-=-=-&quot;the Sandra Dodd who is their guest speaker is quite &quot;Big&quot; in the<br/>
homeschool/unschool realm.   Notice they have a message board.   Maybe they<br/>
would let us post.   As I have been researching for NEXT, I am finding that<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling is much bigger than I previously thought.   Maybe I<br/>
will try to find this Sandra Dodd for an article.   I think we have a large<br/>
realm out their to tap for the magazine.-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So just in case this topic bubbles up on other lists or exchanges this week <br/>
or in the future, please know that it&#39;s another kind of money-making scam-like <br/>
thing succeeding not in making children&#39;s lives better, but in being a <br/>
moneymaker for its leaders.<br/>
