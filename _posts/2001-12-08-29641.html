<br/>
&gt; Hi Sheila,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re absolutely right.  What I wrote really does sound bad.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mean it to offend anyone.  I honestly don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong<br/>
&gt; with failing tests.  That&#39;s why I wrote that.  Of course, I don&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; to assume that all unschoolers will fail standardized tests.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; many will do very well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason I wrote that is because some of us who choose to go the<br/>
&gt; unschooling route, have kids who naturally start reading at a later age<br/>
&gt; than schooled kids.  My boys are a good example.  They are 7 and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure it&#39;ll be a few years before they start reading.  My unschooled<br/>
&gt; friends are all late readers, although there is one who started reading<br/>
&gt; early at 4 1/2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was referring to these standardized tests that young kids have to take<br/>
&gt; in the early grades.  If the test-taker is an unschooler and is a late<br/>
&gt; reader, s/he probably won&#39;t do very well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That isn&#39;t to say they&#39;re not bright.  They&#39;re just doing other things.<br/>
&gt; My boys may just barely know their ABC&#39;s and their numbers but they sure<br/>
&gt; know how to think.  They ask very sophisticated question and have an<br/>
&gt; extraordinary vocabulary.  Both are very interested in history and the<br/>
&gt; other day, I spent at least 30 minutes discussing various economic<br/>
&gt; systems with them (we were in the car).  Leroy just would not stop<br/>
&gt; asking those questions.  He wants to know everything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that, as unschoolers, we should<br/>
&gt; not ALWAYS view failing a test as a bad thing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sheila<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; To be honest, I&#39;m not sure if it is possible to unschool in a state<br/>
&gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Maine.  They require annual testing.  Can you find out how many<br/>
&gt; &gt; years in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; a row your child can fail the test before she&#39;s required to go back<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; school?  I think the longer a child has the opportunity to<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschool, the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; better.  The older s/he is, the better s/he will be able to put up<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the bull the state requires without much harm to her psyche.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; personal opinion.  I honestly don&#39;t know how else to advise you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93147436">hm......... something to think about, Lynda, but the first thought that came to my mind is that an unschooling family, being more hands-off until signaled, may *not* be playing those games you&#39;re referring to. Maybe it&#39;s the kid&#39;s more natural time-clock to read at 10 or 12 than at 5,6,7ish? Don&#39;t get me wrong... I&#39;m not against the games you mentioned because I believe exposure plays a big part in learning and that can *still* imo be unschooling.<br/>
Hm...... still thinking on this..<br/>

<br/>
Bridget and Lynda,<br/>
You&#39;d be making a big mistake to make this assumption. My experience is that those who have the most success with unschooling as a way of life are are very motivated or have become self motivated as a result of their opportunity to learn , explore and discover, by their own direction and on their own timetable. These are children who are busy all the time. They can be very demanding because they require all kinds of materials and information to accommodate their curiosity and their unlimited projects. Their parents spend a GREAT deal of time playing games with them and facilitating their need to be constantly engaged in some activity or another until they begin to enjoy movies and TV &lt;bg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The notion of unschooling implies that learning happens all the time and that one need not seek out opportunities and materials to accommodate learning but rather one provides and facilitates the exploration of life and the pursuit of making meaning by being available and participating in child led pursuits. My dd was reading at two years and is teaching herself piano when she&#39;s not watching TV or baking or skateboarding or beading or drawing or playing video games or reading..... I remember joking with one of the kids that we&#39;d not teach the baby to talk so she wouldn&#39;t become to much of a bother&lt;g&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
Just as one doesn&#39;t have to teach a child to walk and talk one does not have to teach them to use a toilet or to read. I was never happy with describing our lifestyle as home schooling because that implies doing school at home and that&#39;s not what we do. Unschooling as a label is a better fit but it also has some negative connotations which are easily misunderstood and I&#39;m reticent to use the term with anyone other than those on these lists. We allow our curriculum to manifest itself in our daily routines, which are best described to those who use schools, as being on summer holiday all the time. Everyone understands that holidays have a natural rhythm that&#39;s determined by the weather, a visitor or an activity of your own choice along with daily routines including grooming and meals, shopping and housekeeping etc.... All of these activities provide opportunities to learn and grow. I don&#39;t believe that anything will interfere with natural learning and the growth of intelligence except K-12 curriculum, not even TV!<br/>

phrase rubs me wrong, because of the implication that some games involve<br/>
learning and some don&#39;t... I would think all games involved learning, so<br/>
when I see it specified I think of those horridly educational games like<br/>
&quot;Sight Word Bingo&quot; and stuff... <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I spent a great deal of time playing games with Cacie when<br/>
she was little... my patience with stuff like Candyland and Chutes and<br/>
Ladders is almost non-existent. I guess she started playing chess at two,<br/>
because we used to hang out at so many coffeehouses all the time and it<br/>
was always there, but she&#39;d usually get tired mid-game and start having<br/>
the queens invite each other over for cake or something.I play lots of<br/>
games with her now... I didn&#39;t spend much time faciliatting, either... I<br/>
was almost always *there*, but mostly I wasn&#39;t doing much actively with<br/>
her, just hagning out and talking and all.<br/>

who need help or support on the issue of &quot;later than our culture&#39;s norm&quot;<br/>
readers.  People like me who have a child who learned to read a few<br/>
months before his 5th birthday don&#39;t have a whole lot to offer someone<br/>
who is struggling over a 9 or 10 year who isn&#39;t reading.  So I won&#39;t post<br/>
anything since I feel it could be inconsiderate to say &quot;my kid learned<br/>
early.&quot;  I occasionally see posts of &quot;my kid started reading and s/he <br/>
is X&quot; where X is within a comfortable margin of our culture&#39;s norm.  <br/>
Very rarely does that turn into a discussion which lasts days - if any <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698761217">We are going off in different directions here.  I made no assumptions, I<br/>
asked the question  because so many folks are talking about their late<br/>
readers and I was wondering if it was because for some folks unschooling<br/>
means not doing things that we just kinda found to be &quot;natural.&quot;  I was<br/>
wondering if sometimes folks don&#39;t start out by wanting to be so hands off<br/>
that they go too far in the opposite direction and don&#39;t do any play that<br/>
might come under the heading of educational.  That would not appear to be<br/>
the case for your children but I am still wondering if it was so for those<br/>
that have children that they are now worrying about because they are late<br/>
readers.<br/>
<br/>
What has happened in this house is that back in the 60s we &quot;acquired&quot; five<br/>
nieces and nephews.  I didn&#39;t send them to school because I figured their<br/>
life was traumatic enough, why subject them to still more trauma.<br/>
<br/>
I bought a whiteboard/magnetic board on one side, felt board on the other<br/>
side for the baby (she was two) to play with when we went to the laundry<br/>
mat.  It is old and decrepid now but all the kidlets have played with it.  I<br/>
made felt animals and people and bought magnetic letters and fridge poetry<br/>
magnets and fraction burgers and tangegrams and all kinds of magnetic or<br/>
felt &quot;stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the livingroom is a box with all of these &quot;quiet&quot; toys and these are the<br/>
ones they can &quot;play&quot; with when we watch television after dinner.  They&#39;ve<br/>
all been pulling them out and playing with them since they were old enough<br/>
to pull them across the livingroom floor.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean that this house isn&#39;t filled with &quot;stuff&quot; but simply that<br/>
the one room (and only the one room &lt;g&gt;) is semi-organized.  Every single<br/>
room has at least one book case with some having as many as 3.  IMHO, one of<br/>
the greatest inventions of the 20th century was the over the back of the<br/>
door hanging book shelves &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We also have lots of musical instruments and have sing alongs almost every<br/>
night.  All of the musical instruments are in the diningroom (isn&#39;t that<br/>
what its for &lt;g&gt;) which is connected to our pathetically small kitchen.  So<br/>
if hubby is cooking dinner, I play the piano and if I am cooking he plays<br/>
the guitar and fixing dinner has turned into a singalong hour.  They&#39;ve all<br/>
been singing since they could talk.<br/>
<br/>
None of this was a forced issue, the use of all this was by their<br/>
initiation.  And, by request, half the time I would end up on the floor with<br/>
them or they would crawl up on the couch with me.  That is except during<br/>
Wheel of Fortune because they have all been playing along with that since it<br/>
came on tv.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d be singing the Jimminy Cricket song and they would want to know what<br/>
&quot;e&quot; was and so forth (from singing e-n-c-y-c-l-o-p-e-d-i-a) or Mickey Mouse<br/>
songs (what&#39;s an &quot;m&quot;, etc.) and of course the ABC song.<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, with this type of &quot;play&quot; which they initiated, they all knew<br/>
their alphabet, numbers and could read when they were little guys, with the<br/>
latest being five.  And it didn&#39;t have anything to do with trained poodle<br/>
responses, they just did it.  And you would have no problem believing that<br/>
if you ever heard some of the ways they ended the ABC song &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; Just as one doesn&#39;t have to teach a child to walk and talk one does not<br/>
have to teach them to use a toilet or to read. I was never happy with<br/>
describing our lifestyle as home schooling because that implies doing school<br/>
at home and that&#39;s not what we do. Unschooling as a label is a better fit<br/>
but it also has some negative connotations which are easily misunderstood<br/>
and I&#39;m reticent to use the term with anyone other than those on these<br/>
lists. We allow our curriculum to manifest itself in our daily routines,<br/>
which are best described to those who use schools, as being on summer<br/>
holiday all the time. Everyone understands that holidays have a natural<br/>
rhythm that&#39;s determined by the weather, a visitor or an activity of your<br/>
own choice along with daily routines including grooming and meals, shopping<br/>
and housekeeping etc.... All of these activities provide opportunities to<br/>
learn and grow. I don&#39;t believe that anything will interfere with natural<br/>
learning and the growth of intelligence except K-12 curriculum, not even TV!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277837883">.....I was wondering if sometimes folks don&#39;t start out by wanting to be so hands off that they go too far in the opposite direction and don&#39;t do any play that might come under the heading of educational......<br/>
<br/>
  What I&#39;m saying is that all play is &quot;educational&quot;! Learning is happening all the time. <br/>
<br/>
  ......That would not appear to be the case for your children but I am still wondering if it was so for those<br/>
  that have children that they are now worrying about because they are late readers......<br/>
  My middle son didn&#39;t begin to really read until he was 10yo. He was one of those kids that spoke with a kind of Boston accent and phonics didn&#39;t make any sense to him. By the time he really began to understand reading he had memorized many words but he wasn&#39;t reading by a school teachers definition until he was 10 and he still, at 12, is not at the expected reading level but he does and can read almost any word. Interestingly there are times when it comes easier and times when it still doesn&#39;t make sense to him. Diane&#39;s post about her own experience with &quot;Dyslexia&quot; was particularly interesting for us in this regard. Sometimes he can look at some print and find exactly what he&#39;s looking for in an instant and other times he still struggles. He still doesn&#39;t read novels but he&#39;ll pour over books about dogs or lizards for half hours at a time&lt;G&gt;. My 12yo son may be reading at the same skill level as my 7yo but his level of sophistication is of a 12yo not a 7yo. <br/>
<br/>
  .......I bought a whiteboard/magnetic board on one side, felt board on the other<br/>
  side for the baby (she was two) to play with when we went to the laundry<br/>
  mat.  It is old and decrepit now but all the kidlets have played with it.  I<br/>
  made felt animals and people and bought magnetic letters and fridge poetry<br/>
  magnets and fraction burgers and tangegrams and all kinds of magnetic or<br/>
  felt &quot;stuff.&quot;........<br/>
<br/>
  My kids love the fridge magnet poetry. Words and letters are everywhere and so are numbers. Chocolate bars divide into fractions and so do apples and oranges. I find the whole industry that&#39;s evolved to facilitate learning with contrived materials to be just that, another industry. When I had my first, 18 years ago, all of my acquaintances were into flash cards and the like, insisting that their children would have a jump on the others if they were reading by 2 etc... I&#39;ve now read more than one study that shows that by the time one&#39;s in graduate school those who were labeled gifted and those who were labeled challenged can not be told apart. I believe that all of us are gifted and should be allowed to pursue our gifts without being obliged to spend copious amounts of time working on stuff others, the professionals, deem to be necessary. When the time is right a child will begin to use the toilet and the same is true with the alphabet. You can have them drawing letters and repeating letters each day for as long as it takes or you can wait until they naturally come to it and they&#39;ll learn the alphabet and how to use it in an afternoon because it has actually been part of their everyday life experience all along. I often wish I&#39;d developed Hooked on Phonics, not to teach kids how to read but to become a multimillionaire feeding on completive and insecure parents ( just kidding about taking advantage of  poor parents who are just trying to do the right thing. What good parent could forgive themselves for not taking the opportunity to &quot;raise their Childs letter grade by one full mark in less than a year&quot;)&lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  ......In the livingroom is a box with all of these &quot;quiet&quot; toys and these are the<br/>
  ones they can &quot;play&quot; with when we watch television after dinner.  They&#39;ve<br/>
  all been pulling them out and playing with them since they were old enough<br/>
  to pull them across the livingroom floor.....<br/>
<br/>
  I have stuff like Lego and sketch books near the TV always hoping for a little creative activity while they&#39;re in front of the tube. Dylan loves shows like Crocodile Hunter and other nature and science stuff but the Simpson&#39;s is their favorite. Bart has been a life saver for my guy, a cool and clever character who doesn&#39;t fit the mainstream either. I try to watch with them as much as I can stand and constantly critique the shows to make them aware of controversial attitudes and behavior. Dylan likes the show Titus and I think it&#39;s horrible so when I hear it come on I&#39;ll often join him to his dismay. They love Third Rock and the Simpson&#39;s and so do I so I&#39;ll join them for those too and point out the particularly clever parts which lead to great discussions about human nature and culture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170020652">No, I just think that some folks define some things more as play and some<br/>
things more as educational.  We use to have a rabid unschooler on a list I<br/>
belonged to that would froth at the keyboard over anything that could<br/>
possibly be labeled &quot;educational&quot; or &quot;learning&quot; games, so was just asking in<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure the stats are tilted.  I think what we see here are people<br/>
&gt; who need help or support on the issue of &quot;later than our culture&#39;s norm&quot;<br/>
&gt; readers.  People like me who have a child who learned to read a few<br/>
&gt; months before his 5th birthday don&#39;t have a whole lot to offer someone<br/>
&gt; who is struggling over a 9 or 10 year who isn&#39;t reading.  So I won&#39;t post<br/>
&gt; anything since I feel it could be inconsiderate to say &quot;my kid learned<br/>
&gt; early.&quot;  I occasionally see posts of &quot;my kid started reading and s/he<br/>
&gt; is X&quot; where X is within a comfortable margin of our culture&#39;s norm.<br/>
&gt; Very rarely does that turn into a discussion which lasts days - if any<br/>
&gt; responses are seen, it&#39;s usually &quot;oh that&#39;s great!&quot; type of responses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Would it be clearer if I defined my idea of learning games?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you think there are any games which aren&#39;t learning games? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Now, none of us watch the Simpsons but we all love Titus.  I find it<br/>
&quot;interesting&quot; how he manages to sometimes, shall we say, slap up along side<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611018103">I&#39;m curious as well. To me, &#39;learning games,&#39; when applied to games young children play, is any game. Me, out of my many, had one very early reader, and another pretty early reader, and yet another was a later reader. Who knows when #4 will read, but so far he spends a lot of time going through this one huge dinosaur book ;)<br/>

  &gt; These are children <br/>

  Did we ever get a definition of &quot;learning games&quot;? I have to say that the<br/>
  phrase rubs me wrong, because of the implication that some games involve<br/>
  learning and some don&#39;t... I would think all games involved learning, so<br/>
  when I see it specified I think of those horridly educational games like<br/>
  &quot;Sight Word Bingo&quot; and stuff... <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think I spent a great deal of time playing games with Cacie when<br/>
  she was little... my patience with stuff like Candyland and Chutes and<br/>
  Ladders is almost non-existent. I guess she started playing chess at two,<br/>
  because we used to hang out at so many coffeehouses all the time and it<br/>
  was always there, but she&#39;d usually get tired mid-game and start having<br/>
  the queens invite each other over for cake or something.I play lots of<br/>
  games with her now... I didn&#39;t spend much time faciliatting, either... I<br/>
  was almost always *there*, but mostly I wasn&#39;t doing much actively with<br/>
  her, just hagning out and talking and all.<br/>
