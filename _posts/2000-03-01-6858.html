<div id="ygrps-yiv-558953680">Hi all,<br/>
This is my first year of hsing my 8 yo son, James. I live in New York.<br/>
If there is anyone who lives in NY or has regs similar to NY, could you<br/>
please give me an idea of what type of format you use for your qtrly<br/>
reports and yr end written narrative. I started out trying to duplicate<br/>
school, which made qtrlies easier. I have found that unschooling is the<br/>
best route for us, but now I am a little confused as to how to document<br/>
and report. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks<br/>
