I wish I could contribute to your list, but most of my reading these days is<br/>
juvenile literature.  I would, however, love to have a copy of your reading<br/>
list in case I ever get to read for myself again (it&#39;s getting better as the<br/>
kids are getting older).<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a children&#39;s list also, or just adult?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781680376">Last year, Abi picked a book for me at the library, it <br/>
was about the English settlers, in particular an event <br/>
at Deerfield, I just searched for it at amazon, and it&#39;s <br/>
&#39;The redeemed captive, returning to Zion.&#39;  It&#39;s history, <br/>
not fiction, and I didn&#39;t read all of it, but the culture <br/>
clash between the settlers and the Native Americans <br/>
is very interesting...<br/>
