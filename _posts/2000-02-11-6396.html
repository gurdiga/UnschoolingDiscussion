<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052048159">I also like Grace Llewellyn&#39;s book &quot;Real Lives&quot;.  It&#39;s a compilation of life<br/>
stories by 11 teenagers who either left school to unschool, or never went to<br/>
school at all, and how it has effected their lives.  Each story is written<br/>
by the actual teenager.  My own teenage son read it and so identified with<br/>
&quot;Patrick&#39;s Story&quot;, that he quit high school the following week and hasn&#39;t<br/>
looked back since.  He&#39;s happier than he&#39;s ever been, and passion has<br/>
returned to his life.  That&#39;s been two years ago.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514233530"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Two of my favourites are John Holt&#39;s Learning All the Time and Nancy <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wallace&#39;s Child&#39;s Work.  John&#39;s book really goes into the idea of just <br/>
getting out of the way and letting them learn.  Nancy&#39;s book looks back at <br/>
the things her children did obsessively when they were little and shows how <br/>
those obsessions were really preparing them for what would eventually be <br/>
their life&#39;s work.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have Nancy Wallace&#39;s Child&#39;s Work. I read it years ago when the kids were younger. The other thing I got from the book was how it is important to let your child play - that is their &quot;work&quot;. That is how they are learning and processing things in their world. And to be courteous of them when they are playing. Let them finish what they are doing before dragging them away from it. This book was one of the reasons why I always let my kids play, especially when they were involved in play, I was hesitant to pull them away (and do schoolwork!). I always tried to let them come to their own stopping point. Sometimes, though, I found myself comparing my kids to her somewhat genious kids! Her kids seemed &quot;ahead&quot; of mine. LOL. But that was back when I was stil HS&#39;ing. I wouldn&#39;t do that now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can relate. I love books, and there isn&#39;t a room in my house that isn&#39;t<br/>
piled high with them. People are always giving me more, because they know<br/>
our family enjoys them. One time my sister, who at the time had a 3yo,<br/>
6yo, and 12yo, brought me over crates of childrens books that she cleaned<br/>
out of her house. I asked her if she wanted to wait till the children<br/>
outgrew them, and she just said no, that is what school is for. I almost<br/>
always buy her children books for gifts, and they will ask her if she<br/>
will read them that night. She always gives them a &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot;.<br/>
Not me! I&#39;m always trying to read books to my children, and they love it.<br/>
Last summer we went to a flea market and the girls ran right past the<br/>
tables of beanie babies and time-out dolls, straight for the new book<br/>
tables. I told them that they could each pick out two books. They were<br/>
having trouble deciding because there were so many nice ones. The elderly<br/>
man selling the books said that any children that excited about books<br/>
deserves to have them, and proceeded to give them a stack of about six<br/>
brand new books for free! The girls were so happy that they gave the man<br/>
(a total stranger) a big hug. It made my day too.<br/>

We had neighbors whose daughter was very artistic, but she wasn&#39;t allowed to <br/>
have paints in the house.  Their house was kept absolutely clean and arranged <br/>
as though the photographers were coming, and paints would have been a risk to <br/>
the carpet or the surfaces.  Also, where would she keep them afterward?<br/>
<br/>
They figured she would get to paint in school.  <br/>
And music was for school too.  Be quiet at home, because someone is watching <br/>
the TV.<br/>
<br/>
So at our house, she painted.  She sang really loud along with some video or <br/>
recording, and she painted and drew and sculpted.  But she couldn&#39;t take the <br/>
finished stuff home.  It would have just gone into the trash.<br/>
<br/>
No bookshelves there either.  I guess they figure school libraries are the <br/>
right place for kids&#39; books, and the kids will get to read them at school.<br/>
<br/>
Only by the time all those messages are digested and school does its part to <br/>
make the kids feel book-sick, and by the time art and music are actually <br/>
available as electives, the kids aren&#39;t so interested.<br/>
<br/>
Holly called this girl in December to wish her happy birthday.  They were <br/>
best friends when they were two to five.   The other girl is doing <br/>
cross-stitch embroidery now.  That&#39;s quiet and not messy, I thought.<br/>

<br/>
And THAT&#39;s why I don&#39;t understand the lack of books in the military! It&#39;s not <br/>
as if the soldiers had to PAY to get heavy boxes of books shipped all over <br/>
creation! Your tax dollars pay to have them shipped. So really it&#39;s a lack of <br/>
interest, NOT the moving fees! <br/>

overseas --- so I don&#39;t care if they&#39;re heavy!  And we own so little<br/>
furniture (mostly bookshelves &lt;g&gt;) that we were at about half our weight<br/>
allowance.  So I can go book shopping!  Hooray!<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm.  Now where should I go?  Nearest English language bookstore is 2 1/2<br/>
hours.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83044590">Yea Brenda, way to go with the books!  When we moved to Haiti five years<br/>
ago, I kept wondering if anyone was going to complain about the amount of<br/>
books we had sent over.  My excuse was that we weren&#39;t going to be able to<br/>
buy any over there and we would need books for homeschooling.  Of course, I<br/>
still found books to buy, but it was a lot more difficult, lol.  When we<br/>
left, we left most of them in Haiti at the English school, but don&#39;t worry<br/>
we quickly returned to having a house full of books!<br/>
<br/>
 I have brothers who don&#39;t have any books in their houses, and probably can<br/>
say they haven&#39;t read a book since they graduated from high school.  That<br/>
just amazes me!<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

up stairs and down hallways.  You may not have to move them OCONUS but you <br/>
still have to move them.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872069422">My son Joey LOVES the magic tree house series but there is another <br/>
one similar calle &quot;The Time Warp Trio&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just yeterday my son bought a game based on video game and I bought <br/>
the new book &quot;Eragon&quot; written by the home school boy that graduated <br/>
when he was 15.  That is what it says inside the flap.  I like the <br/>
looks of it so far and I look forward to reading it to all my three <br/>
boys ages 15,11 and 7.  I&#39;ll keep you posted - there was alos a <br/>
comment on the book that if you enjoyed the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; you <br/>
will like this ???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985097601">Hi,<br/>
I just read my post and saw that it didn&#39;t make any sense <br/>
LOL...........<br/>
First my son purchased this vidoe game called &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; and then <br/>
when we were in the bookstore he saw the book. !! He noticed that it <br/>
was the same by the picture-how cool is that ! It has 34 chapters <br/>
(short) and after I read what was on the cover &quot;The first official <br/>
novel based on the thrilling video game&quot; I just had to get it. When <br/>
I looked inside I found that it was a first of a series.  Joey is <br/>
only 7 and cannot read but understands everything and that is what I <br/>
love about unschooling. Just because he cannot read doesn&#39;t mean he <br/>
shouldn&#39;t get exsposed to books he would really love so I am his <br/>
reading eyes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724699450">We are also reading Eragon.  My son says its pretty good so far, I&#39;m just a<br/>
chapter in or so.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m been thinking about this discussion quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was Wendy who asked about it.<br/>
<br/>
**What are some good books for an 8 year old (That reads pretty good) to<br/>
read? **<br/>
<br/>
Things that he wants to read. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** Can he just read Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Yo books and Game Manuals and be<br/>
OK????? **<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  He&#39;ll have that good feeling about reading and you never know where<br/>
it will go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** I would like, in a perfect world, for him to be reading the Classics!<br/>
haha! **<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;re joking around but I think this is a huge step in deschooling.<br/>
Being Ok with the fact that maybe our kids won&#39;t want to read those.  I know<br/>
so many people who have never picked up a &quot;classic&quot;  and they are leading<br/>
totally great lives.  I also know some people who have read those books and<br/>
are really unhappy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Alec finished HP4 and I was searching and searching for<br/>
something for him to read.  This was preunschooling days. :)  (Notice I was<br/>
searching, not him, that&#39;s the key,  he hadn&#39;t even asked for something to<br/>
read!  I just thought he needed to be reading something.)    I suggested the<br/>
Unfortunate Events, Narnia, Redwall,  all sorts of adventure books,  nope.<br/>
He didn&#39;t want to read those.  Maybe he just didn&#39;t want to read anything<br/>
right then.  He did read HP5 when it came out, in about 2 days!  What he has<br/>
found that he likes right now is the DragonballZ graphic novels and the<br/>
Showen Jumps.   And now Eragon.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s my dd, Abbi(9),  who doesn&#39;t want to sit and listen to me read<br/>
anymore, :( and doesn&#39;t want to read through such a long book as HP books,<br/>
(she says they look too long) but then the other day asked to sit with me<br/>
and read Macbeth.   She also reads the graphic novels,  like Rurouni<br/>
Kenshin,  which I like because of the history that I&#39;m learning.  Her<br/>
interest in Anime has led to Tae-Kwon-Do,  Japanese and Chinese writing,<br/>
history of Japan and China  and lots of other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We just never know.............<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let them do what they want and they may end up in the Classics.  And they<br/>
may not.  But that&#39;s OK too.<br/>
