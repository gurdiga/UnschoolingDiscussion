&lt;&lt; I am STILL waiting to hear from SOMEONE, ANYONE, on the subjects mentioned<br/>
 in my original introductory message.  Where is everyone?<br/>

introductory message as I just signed up for this loop today. Can you repeat <br/>
it and maybe I can offer some feedback?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Marti, married to Hal and we have two unschooled-from-birth daughters. <br/>
Emily, 8 and Carline, 6. We live on Puget Island in Washington State (middle <br/>
of the Columbia River) and are in the process of moving to Olympia, Wa (next <br/>
month). <br/>
<br/>
I have always wished that there was an unschooling loop so I am really <br/>
excited to have found this one!!! :o)<br/>

A real person!!  I was beginning to feel like I was stuck on a bank &quot;help&quot;<br/>
line, and was never going to fine anyone breathing to actually help me!<br/>
The following is a copy of the original message I sent.  By the way, we are<br/>
located in Idaho, recently moved from Washington state.  We were married on<br/>
San Juan Island, and lived in the Tri-Cities.  My husband grew up there but<br/>
I did not.  It&#39;s a small world!<br/>
<br/>
Hi there all!<br/>
Please excuse the gargantuan proportions of this message.  I have a number<br/>
of things to convey in order to solicit advice that is accurate to our<br/>
situation.  I also want to let you get to know us a &#39;little&#39; (a word used<br/>
very loosely!)  I just joined the list, and as such, have not yet gotten<br/>
any idea about the types of amounts of messages speeding through<br/>
cyberspace.  However, I would like to introduce myself, and ask you<br/>
&quot;veteran&quot; homeschoolers/unschoolers out there for a little advice.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all I would like to say...WOW!  This is my first experience with<br/>
&quot;Unschooling&quot; and I am fascinated, and excited!!  I have planned to<br/>
homeschool my children since before they were born.  Having grown up in a<br/>
big city with parents who were apathetic, and being socially awkward, I had<br/>
agonies in public school my entire school career.  Picture a child who<br/>
comes home in hysterics at least a couple of times a week from the<br/>
emotional pain of peer inflicted tortures.  Imagine if you can, hating<br/>
school, your teacher(s) and the entire environment SO much that at 7 or 8<br/>
you hid under your bed, or in the garage, or played sick, in desperate<br/>
attempts to avoid school.  <br/>
<br/>
The playing sick was a big mistake because I was a very sickly child and<br/>
often when I really WAS sick I was called a liar and sent to school anyway.<br/>
 Once I actually ended up in the ER and had the satisfaction of hearing the<br/>
doctor reprimand my mother for not noticing the very overt sympotms that<br/>
are the prelude to my particular condition at the time.  That week in the<br/>
hospital I got whatever I asked her for! <br/>
<br/>
Eventually I took charge of my own education.  I left public school at age<br/>
14, against my parents wishes and those of the Principal at the High<br/>
School, and began attending an independant study school.  There I attended<br/>
a meeting with my instructor once a week to go over assignments, recieve<br/>
new work assignments, discuss problems, etc, and the rest of my time was up<br/>
to me to organize.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, as a parent, I want so much more for my children.  I don&#39;t want them<br/>
to feel tortured and persecuted by peers or adults.  I don&#39;t want them to<br/>
come to see learning as a chore or knowledge as a burden.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
them to have to submit to the wills of teachers and administrators that<br/>
they may hate.  I don&#39;t want them to be subject to the whims of<br/>
disillusioned teachers who have come to despise their charges, or<br/>
instructors who know less than the children, or many worse things.  I want<br/>
them to enjoy their childhood and get a good and thourough education at the<br/>
SAME TIME!<br/>
<br/>
So here I am!  My name is Nanci Kuykendall and my husband is Tom.  Our<br/>
children (Thomas and Alexander) are still far from &quot;school age&quot; and so,<br/>
although I knew I was going to homeschool, I had not done any research into<br/>
the arena until now.  Now we have a new situation arrising, and that is<br/>
where I need help.  <br/>
<br/>
We are in the process of adopting a little girl (we have two boys) and have<br/>
been struggling in the course of our research with all the confusing<br/>
options and pros and cons in various adoption scenarios.  We originally<br/>
thought a baby would be best for us, to maintain birth order.  However, we<br/>
were not counting on falling in love with the listing for an 8 year old<br/>
little girl in Foster Care!  Well!  This changes everything!  Hopefully she<br/>
will turn out to be a good match for us, once our homestudy is completed<br/>
and we are able to get more details about her and her history.<br/>
<br/>
But, and this is a large exception, that leaves me with a ready made 2nd<br/>
grader!!  Where do I begin?  What do I do?  I don&#39;t even know what, if<br/>
anything, I have to do to establish homeschooling status.  If I interpert<br/>
our State (Idaho) laws correctly, then I don&#39;t have to do anything - except<br/>
be a parent and a teacher that is.<br/>
<br/>
There are SO MANY MANY considerations to bringing a child from Foster Care<br/>
into our home; dealing with her history, and her adjustment to our family,<br/>
protecting my VERY young sons from any &quot;acting out&quot; that may follow her<br/>
history, having a daughter (!), dealing with race issues (she is AA and we<br/>
are caucasion), and on and on.  I would like to give her time to adjust and<br/>
for everyone to get to know each other.  How on earth do I take a child I<br/>
barely know out of public school, and all the other institutions that her<br/>
life has been focused around, and intergrate her into our family and into<br/>
learning at home??<br/>
<br/>
HELP!!!   I would appreciate ANY help and advice, any at all, just sing<br/>
out, we need options from all corners, especially on Unschooling which I<br/>
just discovered.  Until now I assumed that homeschooling required that your<br/>
child complete certain subjects in a certain order and be tested regularly<br/>
to ensure they are up to &quot;grade&quot; level ( I heard that somewhere &quot;once upon<br/>
a time.&quot;)  What a wonderful notion that children can be allowed to be<br/>
children, not miniature adults, and learn freely and naturally allowing the<br/>
marvelous human brain to do it&#39;s awe inspiring work of growing, learning<br/>
and being! <br/>
<br/>
Eager to Hear From You,<br/>

<br/>
Well, I have a friend who is from an unschooling family. Not only are they<br/>
an unschooling family, but they have two adopted children (bi-racial boys --<br/>
and one of them has AIDS), and the mother is a foster parent as well. They<br/>
are a chaotic but pretty happy family on the whole, and I really respect the<br/>
mother for doing this. With your situation, I think unschooling (or maybe<br/>
homeschooling at first?) the girl would be a good move. That is, unless she<br/>
*wants* to go to school -- it should be her choice. The whole foster and<br/>
adoption thing might be confusing for her, so I&#39;d recommend doing some<br/>
simple lessons in the morning to add some structure to her life -- but you<br/>
don&#39;t have to do that. I just think that unschooling would be a great thing<br/>
to do for her. Good luck! ~Eryn<br/>

Hi Nanci! Yup, there are a bunch of real live people here, but this one has <br/>
been especially busy. Sounds like you too have a lot going on. <br/>
<br/>
**Where do I begin?  What do I do?  I don&#39;t even know what, if<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t know about Idaho. But in general, to get started, just think of the <br/>
kinds of things you like to do, and do them. Sounds oversimplified, I know, <br/>
but really that&#39;s about it. Then leave yourself open to whatever direction <br/>
your kids want to take. Go to the library, the zoo, take a nature walk, rent <br/>
a bunch of movies, read a great book out loud, play Monopoly. <br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and ask us lots of questions. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; How on earth do I take a child I<br/>
barely know out of public school, and all the other institutions that her<br/>
life has been focused around, and intergrate her into our family and into<br/>
learning at home??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can&#39;t right away. That sounds like an awful lot of change for any <br/>
person. After you do get to know her, you will know when you can bring her <br/>
home from school.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re at the start of a great journey. Above all, have fun!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  just joined the list, and as such, have not yet gotten<br/>
 any idea about the types of amounts of messages speeding through<br/>
 cyberspace. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Know what.. this list is pretty new, we opened it with the site.  So none of <br/>
us relly knows how much mail we&#39;ll be able to generate. &lt;G&gt;  Do you all want <br/>
a busy, busy list??  Let&#39;s brainstorm just what  we do and do not want out of <br/>
this list. Right now we don&#39;t have any other list rule, other than the Golden <br/>
Rule.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  However, I would like to introduce myself, and ask you<br/>
 &quot;veteran&quot; homeschoolers/unschoolers out there for a little advice.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I should say that I&#39;m Lisa Bugg, mom to 4 wonderful kids and Greg&#39;s wife.  <br/>
We&#39;ve unschooled for about 11 years now.  I&#39;ve been reading, thinking and <br/>
talking about education and schooling or not schooling since my oldest was 2. <br/>
 I love to read and talk, and I&#39;m committed to sharing what unschooling is <br/>
and can be with anyone who wants to listen.<br/>
 <br/>
 F<br/>
 &lt;&lt;  Imagine if you can, hating<br/>
 school, your teacher(s) and the entire environment SO much that at 7 or 8<br/>
 you hid under your bed, or in the garage, or played sick, in desperate<br/>
 attempts to avoid school. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I see this daily. There is a good book called We&#39;ve All Got Scars by Rapheala <br/>
Best.  After reading that book I don&#39;t see how anyone can say complusory <br/>
attendence is a good thing. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;Now, as a parent, I want so much more for my children.  I don&#39;t want them<br/>
 to feel tortured and persecuted by peers or adults.  I don&#39;t want them to<br/>
 come to see learning as a chore or knowledge as a burden.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
 them to have to submit to the wills of teachers and administrators that<br/>
 they may hate.  I don&#39;t want them to be subject to the whims of<br/>
 disillusioned teachers who have come to despise their charges, or<br/>
 instructors who know less than the children, or many worse things.  I want<br/>
 them to enjoy their childhood and get a good and thourough education at the<br/>
 SAME TIME!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Le&#39;ts define education then.. what do you see them doing in order to *become <br/>
educated*?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;.  However, we<br/>
 were not counting on falling in love with the listing for an 8 year old<br/>
 little girl in Foster Care!  Well!  This changes everything!  Hopefully she<br/>
 will turn out to be a good match for us, once our homestudy is completed<br/>
 and we are able to get more details about her and her history.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds amazing. I wish you all the best as you chart this new course.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; But, and this is a large exception, that leaves me with a ready made 2nd<br/>
 grader!!  Where do I begin?  What do I do?  I don&#39;t even know what, if<br/>
 anything, I have to do to establish homeschooling status.  If I interpert<br/>
 our State (Idaho) laws correctly, then I don&#39;t have to do anything - except<br/>
 be a parent and a teacher that is.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t hvae to DO anything, you begin by bringing her home and loving her. <br/>
 If you love her up and listen deeply, she&#39;ll show you want she needs next. I <br/>
suspect she&#39;s gonna need to be held and touched and taken places and fed and <br/>
nurtured. An emotionally healthy child will learn at the speed of light.  :)  <br/>
So first, JUST do her emotional needs.  <br/>
<br/>
You can come here to the list and talk all about what&#39;s going on with her and <br/>
we can help find materials and ideas for the two/five of you.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt; How on earth do I take a child I<br/>
 barely know out of public school, and all the other institutions that her<br/>
 life has been focused around, and intergrate her into our family and into<br/>
 learning at home??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One day at a time.  Wake up and do each and every day with an awareness that <br/>
today is all that matters, at least for awhile. You focus on her, she&#39;ll <br/>
focus on learning.  I promise.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;  Until now I assumed that homeschooling required that your<br/>
 child complete certain subjects in a certain order and be tested regularly<br/>
 to ensure they are up to &quot;grade&quot; level ( I heard that somewhere &quot;once upon<br/>
 a time.&quot;)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re here to definately break that notion. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  What a wonderful notion that children can be allowed to be<br/>
 children, not miniature adults, and learn freely and naturally allowing the<br/>
 marvelous human brain to do it&#39;s awe inspiring work of growing, learning<br/>
 and being! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep and it&#39;s so simple it&#39;s hard to believe at first.  My main job is mom the <br/>
taxi and mom the cleaner upper of all things.  My second job is that of <br/>
acquirer. I acquire nuts and bolts, rubber bands, fish.... just all sorts of <br/>
stuff.  I acquire, the kids use.<br/>

and spend lots of time loving and getting to know her, and don&#39;t worry about<br/>
schooling at all.  There is plenty of time for that, when she and you have found<br/>
her interests.  You will have lots to learn about each other.<br/>

 of her current school, no matter what.  I don&#39;t think I should then put her<br/>
 in a new public school, in a new town and state, along with adoption and a<br/>
 new family, do you?  She lives in the South and no doubt has an accent,<br/>
 which would probably earn her unwanted attention at the public school here<br/>
 as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, summer is approaching.  You could just take the rest of the year <br/>
off (Shouldn&#39;t be hard, many schools in the South are finished already due to <br/>
the hot weather.  They start in August and end in May, many times).  Take the <br/>
summer to talk to her, get to know her, let her get to know the family.  See <br/>
how it is going.  Talk to her about the way you plan to educate the other <br/>
family members, give her input.  Assure her that it doesn&#39;t mean she won&#39;t <br/>
make friends, you&#39;ll do LOTS of stuff to help her get to know other kids.  <br/>
She may very well decide to stay home with you, and continue getting to know <br/>
you better...<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to Olympia!  I am the father of two wonderful homeschooled<br/>
daughers - Aliyah age 11, and Meera age 8, and we are part of a<br/>
non-sectarian homeschooling network (religions and homeschooling<br/>
practices of all kinds) of 55 families -  The Learning Web -- we have a<br/>
monthly newsletter which is usually on-line, but my wife Ellen says this<br/>
month&#39;s hasn&#39;t been put up yet.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us have worked successfully with the school district (which is<br/>
very partial to homeschoolers) and got them to set up a homeschool<br/>
computer lab for us; and they allow participation in school music and<br/>
stuff if that is your preference.<br/>
<br/>
Culturally, Olympia is very diverse, and has lots of activities for kids<br/>
and adults, including the largest per-capita youth symphony association<br/>
in the U.S.  There is also an active Olympia Christian Homeschooling<br/>
Group for those so inclined.<br/>
<br/>
I am the author of a forthcoming book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me:<br/>
Adventures in Homeschooling and Community-Based Education (Holt<br/>
Associates/New Society Publishers, 1999, with a foreword by Joseph<br/>
Chilton Pearce) which is about our unschooling experiences in Olympia.<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to meeting you.  Welcome again and see you next month!<br/>

I hope that is true, I would hate to get in &quot;trouble&quot; for truency or<br/>
something.  My next door neighbor told me something very interesting the<br/>
other day.  They are a large hispanic family, and their children attend the<br/>
elementary school three blocks away.  We were talking over the fence, so to<br/>
speak, and I mentioned that I was planning on Homeschooling the boys.  She<br/>
says &quot;I hear that is a really good thing to do, that those kids do better<br/>
than the kids in regular school.&quot;  (To say the least!)  and then she<br/>
confided to me that she attended the public schools in town, including the<br/>
very elementary school aforementioned, and that she could neither read nor<br/>
write!!  They passed her all the way through the system, ignoring her and<br/>
&quot;sticking&quot; her &quot;in the corner.&quot;  It amazes me, just how bad it can still<br/>
get, even today!<br/>
<br/>
Her daughter came home crying because the teacher was yelling at her and<br/>
berating her for &quot;not trying hard enough to do the work correctly&quot; and<br/>
would not go back to school for a week, she was so frightened, hurt and<br/>
humiliated.  She is 5 years old!  Her mother went off to the school and let<br/>
the teacher &quot;Have it!&quot;  Good for her.<br/>

when  they were young.  They did the public school to private school to<br/>
homeschooling ( I call ours homeschooling eclectic, because we do some<br/>
traditonal school work and some unschooling).  Your 2 are just little<br/>
ones, my opinion, for what it is worth is just have fun with your kids -<br/>
forget anything that it schoolish or curriculum like.  Those little ones<br/>
just learn all the time no matter what they are doing - play is their<br/>
&quot;school&quot;.   I have always read to my 2 and they still love it and are 12<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521329189">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined so I thought I&#39;d introduce myself.  My name is Elizabeth and <br/>
though we have no children yet we&#39;re planning on starting later this year.  I <br/>
work in homeschooling (though I&#39;m definitely not here to promote my <br/>
workplace) and I&#39;ve been interested in education for a long time.  I started <br/>
by reading Summerhill years ago and more recently have been introduced to <br/>
John Holt&#39;s works.  I plan on homeschooling my kids and where I fall on the <br/>
unschooling continuum will probably depend on their personalities, though I <br/>
myself like the idea of total or near-total unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m the type that likes to prepare for things way ahead of time so I <br/>
decided I&#39;d join a few homeschooling and pregnancy lists now that we&#39;re <br/>
almost ready to take the big step.  I imagine I&#39;ll mostly lurk, only coming <br/>
out now and then until I actually have a little learner around the house.<br/>
<br/>
I will make one comment on the teach/learn discussion that I&#39;ve caught part <br/>
of.  I recently read a terrific book by Monty Roberts, The Man Who Listens to <br/>
Horses.  (I&#39;m an animal person.)  In it there&#39;s a quote something along the <br/>
lines of &quot;There&#39;s no such thing as teaching, only learning.&quot;  (I don&#39;t have <br/>
the book with me so it&#39;s probably not exact, but it captures the spirit.)  <br/>
And before anyone lectures me on how children aren&#39;t animals (I&#39;m not saying <br/>
anyone here would, I don&#39;t know you all, but I&#39;m on a couple of other lists <br/>
where I think I might get such a comment) he first heard this comment from <br/>
one of his own teachers in childhood, a nun no less.  I thought it was a cool <br/>
quote.<br/>

Emily has taught herself to read and write, and loves to draw.  I am a bit<br/>
challenged by my twins, and wonder if anyone on this list has any experience<br/>
with multiple learning styles.  For example, yesterday Molly was upset that<br/>
we wouldn&#39;t run a bath for her right after her sister&#39;s shower because there<br/>
wasn&#39;t enough hot water.  No amount of explanations satisfied her until<br/>
daddy actually put her hand under cold running water to show her what her<br/>
bath would feel like.  It strikes me that these girls need a different<br/>
approach, and since both my husband and I are visual learners, we are<br/>

Interesting.  I am a visual learner, and also anything I write down I <br/>
remember.  My eldest son (who was diagnosed with ADHD and visual impairment) <br/>
is a totally auditory learner.  This kid remembers EVERYTHING he hears, even <br/>
when he is jumping up and down and seemingly paying no attention.  <br/>

I&#39;m not sure yet about my other children.  Time will tell, I guess.<br/>

with the 10 yog.  We are striving to find a livable balance and are doing<br/>
much better than last year at this time :o)  thanks largely to our support<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to find you all and look forward to getting to know you better.<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My name is Laraine.  I live in Ohio with dh David and 2 dds Leslie and<br/>
&gt;Melissa ages 10 and 6.  This is our 2nd year hsing and we are a part of a<br/>
&gt;homeschooling support group with many unschoolers.  I guess you could call<br/>
&gt;me an unschooling wannabe at this point.  Just can&#39;t let go of those math<br/>
&gt;text books!<br/>

That is so wonderful to hear.  I&#39;ve been on unschooling lists that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
tolerate discussion about any curricula/school.  This will be refreshing!<br/>
So glad to have found you guys!<br/>
