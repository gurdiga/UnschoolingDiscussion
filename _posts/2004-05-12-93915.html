<br/>
I just took a class from Dr. Mikulas on Buddhism, and I believe he&#39;s written some books. Check google. If he&#39;s as good in writing as he is live, it will be detailed and relevant to today&#39;s world.<br/>
I personally have &quot;Everyday Zen&quot; and &quot;The sayings of Buddha&quot; and really like them both.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033677850">&quot;When Things Fall Apart&quot; by Pema Chodron.<br/>
<br/>
Pema Chodron is an American Buddhist nun and her writing is very accessible <br/>
to the western mind.  She has written other books also.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; recommended?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was just checking in with an online class I&#39;m taking, and saw that <br/>
there&#39;s a free class on Buddhism and Everyday Life starting in early <br/>
June.  You can check it out at Barnes & Noble&#39;s site -- go to <br/>
www.bn.com then click on the B&N University tab all the way to the <br/>
right, then you can check out liberal arts classes from there.  I <br/>
can&#39;t make any recommendations on this particular course as I know <br/>
absolutely nothing at all about the subject (at this point), but just <br/>
thought I&#39;d let you know of this class, so you can see for yourself <br/>
if it&#39;s at all useful.<br/>
<br/>
What I can say about the classes I&#39;ve taken them is that there are <br/>
all kinds of discussions going on at the classes&#39; messages boards, so <br/>
that even if you don&#39;t have the book(s) they&#39;re using, you can still <br/>
glean information from the conversations.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps in some way.<br/>
