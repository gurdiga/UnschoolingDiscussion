&lt;&lt; During a correspondence I had when I was doing my LLL leader <br/>
 application process, I got this (paraphrased here):  &quot;The more you stay <br/>
 with your baby, the easier it is to stay with your baby; the more you <br/>
 separate from your baby, the easier it becomes to separate.&quot;  The minute a <br/>
 mom starts to ignore the voice that is her Mother&#39;s Instinct, the harder it <br/>
 becomes to hear it, the easier it becomes to make choices that are less <br/>
 than natural.  I think you know where I&#39;m going with this.  :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh gosh. This really is so true.<br/>
I got a sick feeling in my stomache when I read this. I truly did have to <br/>
work when Trevor was little. Even with my work, we were in collections for <br/>
stuff and barely able to get by the first couple of years.<br/>
He was in daycare from a very young age, up until 3 yrs. old.<br/>
I was also very young, don&#39;t know if that had anything to do with it, because <br/>
looking back I feel I hadn&#39;t gotten my adolescent rebellion over with after <br/>
leaving the control of home.<br/>
He suffered for it, and I thought it perfectly natural to spend time away <br/>
from him.<br/>
I never wanted to be away working, but it still took a huge paradigm shift to <br/>
see how much I could love being with him all the time.<br/>

Couldn&#39;t agree with it more. I see it with my friends, first they dropped their kids for one morning at daycare, then two, then three. And the really sad thing is they think I&#39;m lazy choosing to be with my kids instead of dropping them and earning some money.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is sad...my hubby&#39;s partner (he has his own IT consulting company) had a baby<br/>
about 3 years ago. The supposedly bfing friendly dr told her at the *2 day* check<br/>
up that the baby was nursing too frequently and to try to stretch out the feedings.<br/>
I saw her at 3 days and noticed the baby rooting. Mom told me what the dr said and <br/>
gave a paci. I tried to explain a bit about building up the supply and what I<br/>
had learned with my oldest. She didn&#39;t listen. At the 2week appt, the baby had<br/>
not gained back her weight, the dr suggested formula, baby gulped it down, the mom <br/>
tried to pump got nothing and decided that she did not make enough milk. This<br/>
then made it easier to leave the baby. At 6 weeks, they left the baby overnight<br/>
with the grandparents so they could get some sleep. I could not IMAGINE being <br/>
away from my 6 week old overnight! I am just trying to figure out if my almost<br/>
3 yo will be ready in Dec and hubby and I can get a hotel room after the company<br/>
christmas party. :o)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I am not saying that formula feeding always leads to more separation from the <br/>
baby (a very good friend of mine bottlefed her oldest two (limited supply due to<br/>
breast reduction which she was able to somewhat over come and nursed (with supplements<br/>
her youngest for a year). But it sure as heck makes it easier.  Hubby&#39;s partner<br/>
was telling me last month or so that they were hoping the company made more money<br/>
this year, so that his wife could stay home more with their dd (and new baby born <br/>
in Oct). I had to bite my tongue...I have been home for 3 years now and hubby and <br/>
his partner make the exact same salary. Our house is smaller, we don&#39;t go out to <br/>
fancy dinners or vacations as much and we don&#39;t have half the debt that they do.<br/>
But we are in NO WAY deprived...we have a great house, a place at the beach<br/>
and enough flexibility to not have to worry *too* much about money. It is scary, they<br/>
live on twice the income we do and a couple of years ago when the company had a cash<br/>
flow issue, we lent the company the money to cover it because they did not have<br/>
any available! Amazing to me....<br/>
<br/>
Many of my friends are surprised that I would want to homeschool and be at home<br/>
with my kids all day. What a shame...<br/>

That&#39;s sad, it really is. What&#39;s worse is my niece had that beat. She left <br/>
her first born with her parents overnight starting at 2 weeks old. I don&#39;t <br/>
even talk to them anymore. Couldn&#39;t handle them at all. Gee, wonder why?<br/>
