<div id="ygrps-yiv-893696167">There are several support group lists I am on.  I live in Columbus, OH.<br/>
This one is statewide - oh-homeschool at yahoo groups.  There is also<br/>
Unschoolers Network Ohio, UNO at yahoo groups - this one hasn&#39;t been too<br/>
busy lately though.  Also OHS-ANN is an ohio homeschool announcement list<br/>
for activities, classes, etc., throughout Ohio, another yahoo group.<br/>
Several people from northeast Ohio post to these lists regularly -<br/>
Akron/Canton area, some in Youngstown.  You might check these out for<br/>
current info.<br/>
