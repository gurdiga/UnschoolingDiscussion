<div id="ygrps-yiv-486082795"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;BTW, Sandra could out-debate the POPE on the subject of being christian so <br/>
&gt;&gt;watch out! :o) LOL&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oohhhh....I don&#39;t think we need a debate on *being* Christian. And probably <br/>
Sandra does not want any gauntlets thrown down for her. :o) There are <br/>
certain segments of the homeschooling community that *are* very vocal and <br/>
*are* based on their version of Christianity. As their beliefs bubble over <br/>
into, and affect, our unschooling world, there&#39;s the discussion.<br/>

a present.  We both got the flu and had to cancel.  Another couple took our<br/>

gliders and I refuse to go up in one now &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; I was quite nervous to be so close to that plane - but my instructor<br/>
&gt; informed me that it was so big it only looked like it was close!  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been in one on the ground but it&#39;s another thing to have it flying near<br/>
&gt; you! Flights into SFO would routinely fly over us too.  Learning to share<br/>
&gt; the sky with the big boys is part of being a pilot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree about the weather!  I&#39;m wondering if we will see snow again.<br/>
&gt; It is cold and wet out there (okay cold for coastal CA - it&#39;s in the<br/>
&gt; high 40s!).<br/>

this way.  And it&#39;s almost unheard of here too, at least at sea level, <br/>
where we are.  And the hills are worse.  Rod has been snowed out for a <br/>
couple of weeks, and it looks like it&#39;s going to be at least another couple <br/>
of weeks.  It&#39;s probably a good thing though.  The company he has a <br/>
tree-planting contract with is *very* close to bankruptcy (thanks to the <br/>
softwood tariff mainly) and this way he&#39;ll have a chance to see whether he <br/>
gets paid for work already done before doing any more that he might not get <br/>
paid for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385288242">I have a friend who lives in Seattle and I asked her if she would be so kind<br/>
as to take back her weather.  She said she&#39;d try but it doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
working &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only one not complaining is the youngest kidlet because she built a<br/>
weather station and she&#39;s been busy charting weather and then looking up<br/>
various years to compare it to.<br/>
<br/>
Her comment the other day was a hoot.  She had finished checking her weather<br/>
station and then she checked to see what the weather person had said the<br/>
weather was going to be like.  She was being real industrious and flipping<br/>
pages like crazy and I asked her what she was doing.  She gave me this very<br/>
serious look and said, &quot;If weathermen always make so many mistakes, how do<br/>
they keep their jobs?&quot;<br/>
