<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020998104">I probably shouldn&#39;t reply because I don&#39;t fit the demographics but <br/>
my answer fits in with the vegetating thread.<br/>
<br/>
I hate TV and we don&#39;t watch much.  I limit both the time and the <br/>
programming severly.  Our house is small and there isn&#39;t a room where <br/>
you can get away from the sound and it just sets me on *edge*- makes <br/>
me nervous and jumpy and I can&#39;t sleep if it&#39;s on anywhere in the <br/>
house.  I think I&#39;m just very sensitive to it because I can *feel* <br/>
the moment it&#39;s turned on even if the sound it all the way down.<br/>
<br/>
However, Justin, my vegetating son, chooses mostly comedy when he <br/>
watches and he loves old comedies and sit coms.  We have the Marx <br/>
Brothers, W.C. Fields, old screwball comedies like My Man Godfrey, <br/>
Abbott and Costello and so many more.  He looks like some burn out <br/>
sitting there with his long hair, goatee and glazed eyes just <br/>
laughing like a kid at movies he&#39;s seen a million times.  It turns <br/>
out that he uses the things he&#39;s learned by watching these comedians <br/>
in his work as a clown and an actor.  <br/>
<br/>
He now analyzes comedies (without realizing it) and told me the other <br/>
day why a local comedy act is like the Marx Brothers even though they <br/>
appear to be so different.  He was almost academically analytical.  <br/>
He can tell the difference between comic actors who got their start <br/>
on stage or as stand up comics or went straight to the movies or TV <br/>
just by watching them.  It&#39;s really kind of cool.<br/>

&gt; I probably shouldn&#39;t reply because I don&#39;t fit the demographics but<br/>
&gt; my answer fits in with the vegetating thread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hate TV and we don&#39;t watch much.  I limit both the time and the<br/>
&gt; programming severly.  Our house is small and there isn&#39;t a room where<br/>
&gt; you can get away from the sound and it just sets me on *edge*- makes<br/>
&gt; me nervous and jumpy and I can&#39;t sleep if it&#39;s on anywhere in the<br/>
&gt; house.  I think I&#39;m just very sensitive to it because I can *feel*<br/>
&gt; the moment it&#39;s turned on even if the sound it all the way down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, Justin, my vegetating son, chooses mostly comedy when he<br/>
&gt; watches and he loves old comedies and sit coms.  We have the Marx<br/>
&gt; Brothers, W.C. Fields, old screwball comedies like My Man Godfrey,<br/>
&gt; Abbott and Costello and so many more.  He looks like some burn out<br/>
&gt; sitting there with his long hair, goatee and glazed eyes just<br/>
&gt; laughing like a kid at movies he&#39;s seen a million times.  It turns<br/>
&gt; out that he uses the things he&#39;s learned by watching these comedians<br/>
&gt; in his work as a clown and an actor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He now analyzes comedies (without realizing it) and told me the other<br/>
&gt; day why a local comedy act is like the Marx Brothers even though they<br/>
&gt; appear to be so different.  He was almost academically analytical.<br/>
&gt; He can tell the difference between comic actors who got their start<br/>
&gt; on stage or as stand up comics or went straight to the movies or TV<br/>
&gt; just by watching them.  It&#39;s really kind of cool.<br/>

and play it for just a bit, and can tell if it&#39;s going to be worth <br/>

download them. And Robby has played LOTS of them, and is getting <br/>
a &quot;feel&quot; for good ones. I don&#39;t know how deep it goes, or if it <br/>

good. <br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable, so that might affect some people&#39;s take on the response. <br/>
 We get eight clear broadcast stations, being right down the hill from the <br/>
transmitters, clear line of sight.<br/>
<br/>
We have five operational TVs.  Three of them have video games on them. Three <br/>
have DVD players (counting the video games as DVD players too).  Four play <br/>
videos.  People watch recorded stuff more than they watch broadcast.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t limit access.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are teens and have looked at some unsavory on-line stuff.  I&#39;ve asked <br/>
Marty not to leave anything nasty on the internet trail for his sister to <br/>
find.   He usually does online games and humor (lately StrongBad, but other humor <br/>
sites) and instant messages with in-town friends.     The few times he looks, <br/>
he deletes the trail.   That&#39;s fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them has ever bought any &quot;dirty magazines,&quot; nor do their older <br/>
friends seem to do that.   Mostly they hang out with gamer geeks.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve gotten where they are, being responsible teenagers, by having made <br/>
choices their whole lives about what they watched and read and did.  <br/>
<br/>
I nip in the bud racist or sexist humor.  I told off a friend of Marty&#39;s who <br/>
said &quot;I hate lesbians&quot; the other night.   We remind people that others&#39; <br/>
feelings are prime in what goes on at the house.  So that&#39;s the principle that says <br/>
it&#39;s okay for Marty to look at some visual stuff IF he keeps it to himself and <br/>
doesn&#39;t leave it out to be found by a click.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had a bikini-model picture up as a desktop background on his computer <br/>
for a while, and then it was Aragorn for a while, and then Strongbad&#39;s e-mail <br/>
screen, and now it&#39;s a female fantasy character with lots of fantasy clothes on.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not obsessed with anything.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all bright and informed and pretty kindhearted.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My two just turned four and five.  We have no limits on tv, we find they <br/>
limit themselves.  They&#39;ve left friends houses when the show was too scary or too <br/>
loud or just not how they wanted to spend their time.  We don&#39;t have cable, <br/>
but we have a gizzillion tapes and a smattering of dvds.  They decide what they <br/>
want to watch, argue it out and then pop it in.  Or not.  They don&#39;t spend the <br/>
whole day in front of the tv, they are very active in a lot of things.<br/>
<br/>
I rented the PBS show on babies, I think it was called Life&#39;s Greatest <br/>
Miracle.  The kids have been interested in my ever expanding belly and keep asking <br/>
what Lovey (the baby, not Thurston Howell&#39;s wife) is doing.  They watched a <br/>
bit, liking the pictures of the fetus, but then went to play with their castly.  <br/>
It was either too gross or too boring, it was their decision.  Mark and I <br/>
loved the show.<br/>
<br/>
A funny note not all that related to the topic:  Julia has been afraid and <br/>
shy at dance class.  Hers is first (at 9 a.m., which should be a crime it&#39;s so <br/>
early) and Nathan&#39;s is the following class.  She sat with her head in my <br/>
shoulder the entire first class.  Today she wanted to dance, but was shy, so the <br/>
teacher asked if she would want Nathan to dance with her.  They were both <br/>
thrilled!  Nathan got to dance two classes, which made him happy and Julia got to <br/>
have her brother help her through the rough spots and hold her hand.  At the end <br/>
of Nathan&#39;s class, the instructor was pleased that Nathan, at 5, would be <br/>
willing to dance with the babies and that he has no problem being the only boy.  I <br/>
said that because they had never really been to school, it doesn&#39;t occur to <br/>
him that someone would find something odd about spending time with another age <br/>
group or gender!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just curious, how many of you don&#39;t limit quantity TV watching, but put<br/>
&gt; &gt; limits on types of programming?  Would love to hear some varying<br/>
opinions on<br/>
&gt; &gt; that subject<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My two just turned four and five.  We have no limits on tv, we find they<br/>
&gt; limit themselves.  They&#39;ve left friends houses when the show was too scary<br/>
or too<br/>
&gt; loud or just not how they wanted to spend their time.  We don&#39;t have<br/>
cable,<br/>
&gt; but we have a gizzillion tapes and a smattering of dvds.  They decide what<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; want to watch, argue it out and then pop it in.  Or not.  They don&#39;t spend<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; whole day in front of the tv, they are very active in a lot of things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I rented the PBS show on babies, I think it was called Life&#39;s Greatest<br/>
&gt; Miracle.  The kids have been interested in my ever expanding belly and<br/>
keep asking<br/>
&gt; what Lovey (the baby, not Thurston Howell&#39;s wife) is doing.  They watched<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bit, liking the pictures of the fetus, but then went to play with their<br/>
castly.<br/>
&gt; It was either too gross or too boring, it was their decision.  Mark and I<br/>
&gt; loved the show.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A funny note not all that related to the topic:  Julia has been afraid and<br/>
&gt; shy at dance class.  Hers is first (at 9 a.m., which should be a crime<br/>
it&#39;s so<br/>
&gt; early) and Nathan&#39;s is the following class.  She sat with her head in my<br/>
&gt; shoulder the entire first class.  Today she wanted to dance, but was shy,<br/>
so the<br/>
&gt; teacher asked if she would want Nathan to dance with her.  They were both<br/>
&gt; thrilled!  Nathan got to dance two classes, which made him happy and Julia<br/>
got to<br/>
&gt; have her brother help her through the rough spots and hold her hand.  At<br/>
the end<br/>
&gt; of Nathan&#39;s class, the instructor was pleased that Nathan, at 5, would be<br/>
&gt; willing to dance with the babies and that he has no problem being the only<br/>
boy.  I<br/>
&gt; said that because they had never really been to school, it doesn&#39;t occur<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; him that someone would find something odd about spending time with another<br/>
age<br/>
&gt; group or gender!<br/>

But likewise it grates on my nerves and I have asked him if he had a <br/>
problem with turning it off between 10:30 and 4pm. He said no and he <br/>
knows if there is something he really wants to watch during that <br/>
time, he can. I do ask the two boys not to view any porno on the <br/>
computer. It&#39;s very offensive to me and I don&#39;t want any history, <br/>
cookies or popups or anything remotely related to it on this PC. We <br/>
talk about this and other than that there are no restrictions. Pete <br/>
doesn&#39;t like scary stuff and only now is watching action movies some <br/>
kids saw when they were 5 or 6! His best bud used to have terrible <br/>
nightmares because of what he watched. Pete has never had bad dreams <br/>
or nightmares....I believe the security of being at home and loved <br/>
and being free keeps his mind worry free. Sara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471326466">We starting lifting restriction in the beginning of this year.  Our <br/>
summer has been crazy with moving and the kids have spent much more <br/>
time than I would have liked watching TV, but than again I was not <br/>
offering anything better during our days at this time (i.e going to <br/>
the park, movies, musuem, etc.).  I had that little worry in the <br/>
back of my head about them sitting there forever, but lately my son <br/>
turns the option of TV down when it comes up.  NOt all the time, but <br/>
he is does not jump at the chance tro watch which is how he used to <br/>
act when I offered it.  I guess it took time but he knows he can put <br/>
it on when he wants and it does get boring after a while.  Right now <br/>
his main limitation is he really does not know all the channels so <br/>
it pretty much stays where it is set (PBS kids or Disney, <br/>
whatever).  He likes cartoons and kids shows at 5 and is content <br/>
with that.  <br/>
<br/>
He can also definitly moniter his own fear of shows.  He requests <br/>
any &quot;scary movies&quot; on DVD (he has already requested Pirates of the <br/>
Carribean) and he can use the controller to flip past any part that <br/>
unnverves him.  I was worried about Spiderman because it has some <br/>
pretty graphic things, but he watched all the great stuff with no <br/>
interest in the scary parts.  He has an imagination that can go <br/>
crazy like both me and dh so that control has been great for him.<br/>
<br/>
We are lucky with the move, we have a play room downstairs and the <br/>
tv is on in there so it does not drive me crazy.  I like a little <br/>
peace occasionaly so in the old house I would be inclined to turn it <br/>
off for sanity&#39;s sake!<br/>
