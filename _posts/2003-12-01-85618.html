<div id="ygrps-yiv-798845832">I have to agree with Tuck on this one.  I never read what my children or dh have written without an invitation, and I don&#39;t like them looking over my shoulder when I&#39;m writing.  But at least the Mom here (I forget who it was) only peeKed, and didn&#39;t do what I apparently did to my poor mother&#39;s closet!<br/>
