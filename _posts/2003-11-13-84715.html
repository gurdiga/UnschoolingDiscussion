<div id="ygrps-yiv-360061899">I guess it brings us back to the fact that, yes, some parents can and will <br/>
use the privacy of homeschooling to conceal abuse and/or neglect. There are even <br/>
people who abuse children in the name of homeschooling. It doesn&#39;t justify <br/>
laws that make it hard to homeschool (because it&#39;s not that hard to conceal <br/>
anyway), but we can&#39;t pretend it doesn&#39;t happen. <br/>
<br/>
Argh....that poor girl. <br/>
