<div id="ygrps-yiv-263979484">Anika, my 6yo dd is a daisy scout.  I am the troop leader.  The troop has<br/>
been together for just over a year and I am getting ready to bridge them to<br/>
Brownies.  All is not well, however, in Daisy land.  Anika really wants this<br/>
group but she is frustrated with the format.  Wants more free play and less<br/>
crafts and meeting stuff.  The problem is when she feels frustrated she<br/>
whines, yells, and acts in ways that bring the meetings to a screaming halt.<br/>
 <br/>
Ani is loud when she is playing but mostly when she does not like the way<br/>
the meeting is going.  Some of the other girls&#39; mothers have told me that<br/>
this frightens their daughters.  and although I could see this when they had<br/>
just met, My take is that they are annoyed with her and frustrated rather<br/>
than frightened.  If I give her verbal guidance, no matter how gentle, in<br/>
the moment, she will shout something like, I don&#39;t care!   Now, I know she<br/>
does care about having friendships with these girls.  She was nearly in<br/>
tears about it last week.  <br/>
 <br/>
The other moms are about fed up with the disruptions.  They are mostly very<br/>
nice.  They are all very schooly and have recently asked that we implement<br/>
&quot;consequences&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot;.   I am afraid the actual consequence of not<br/>
fixing this problem will be that we won&#39;t have a troop next year because no<br/>
one will sign up again.  I just hate that it has gotten to the point where<br/>
my dd is being viewed as &quot;the problem&quot;.  These girls are only 6.  Surely<br/>
part of the experience is to help them with just these kinds of<br/>
interpersonal issues.<br/>
 <br/>
Any ideas would be welcome.<br/>

<br/>
If she were going to a meeting and you weren&#39;t the leader, wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
you quit taking her?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re justifying her behavior even to the point of questioning the  <br/>
veracity of people who were brave enough to tell you how they and  <br/>
their daughters felt.  Most people aren&#39;t brave enough to say things,  <br/>
they just wander away quietly.  If people tell you how they feel and  <br/>
you say &quot;My take is that they are [this] rather than [that],&quot; you&#39;ve  <br/>
discounted their input.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now, I know she<br/>
does care about having friendships with these girls. She was nearly in<br/>
tears about it last week. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Nearly in tears?  Did you tell her that developing friendships will  <br/>
require her to stop shouting and will need for her to learn to let  <br/>
other people have their way at least half the time?    Did you tell  <br/>
her that most kids&#39; moms won&#39;t want to help maintain a friendship  <br/>
between their child and a child who shouts &quot;I DON&#39;T CARE!&quot; at her  <br/>
scout leader?  or at her mother?<br/>
<br/>

&quot;consequences&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot;. I am afraid the actual consequence  <br/>

<br/>
The actual consequence will be that your daughter loses all access to  <br/>
those girls.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I just hate that it has gotten to the point where<br/>
my dd is being viewed as &quot;the problem&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Your own description shows her to be the problem, unless you want to  <br/>
suggest that the whole troop do what she wants all the time.  That  <br/>
would be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s just way too young for an organized activity like that.   <br/>
Girl Scouting is not an unschooling type of activity.  It can be, to  <br/>
some extent, with older girls pursuing their own interests  <br/>
independently, but with kids too young to read, where you&#39;re trying  <br/>
to organize group activities, it can&#39;t help but be a situation that  <br/>
needs to involve discipline and consequences and schoolishness.  It&#39;s  <br/>
a group meeting on a schedule, limited by age and gender.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Surely part of the experience is to help them with just these  <br/>
kinds of interpersonal issues.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are reasonable expectations in people who come to a scout  <br/>
meeting at any level.  It&#39;s not an interpersonal issue if one member  <br/>
is being so disruptive that the troop can&#39;t function.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I can think of besides dropping the project would be  <br/>
for you to have someone near enough to extricate her when she gets  <br/>
tired of it, so she&#39;s gone before she blows up.<br/>
