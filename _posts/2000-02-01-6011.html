<div id="ygrps-yiv-418418066">I am supposed to go vote tomorrow and it&#39;s supposed to influence the country so if anyone wants to tell me who they think should be the best guy to vote for president and if anyone is better for unschooling or not I am still undecided and would be happy to listen to what anyone here has to say. <br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392252694">Well, the Bush family is deep into the Gothard/H$LDA type stuff, so I would<br/>
be real leary of George W.  Besides, I don&#39;t like folks who refuse to<br/>
answer questions which is another one of his favorite things to do.  To me,<br/>
if you refuse to answer a question about possible drug use you have as good<br/>
as admitted that you did.<br/>
<br/>
The democrats are notorious in their NEA beliefs, so that is another<br/>
problem.  Of course, that is being addressed by a letter writing campaign.<br/>
<br/>
So, I can&#39;t say who I would vote for, simply who I wouldn&#39;t vote for.  Gee,<br/>
aren&#39;t I helpful &lt;g&gt;<br/>
