<div id="ygrps-yiv-125676278">&quot;If unschoolers believe that kids learn to read when they are ready, how can you <br/>
explain the Millions of Americans that cant read? &#39;<br/>
<br/>
They were schooled.<br/>
Think about it, those that are unschooling, in happy, joyful households might learn to read when they&#39;re 3y.o., or 7 or 10 or 15. With unschooling, it doesn&#39;t matter WHEN, it matters that it is natural and enjoyable.<br/>
In school, if you aren&#39;t reading by 7 or 8, there will be a label slapped on you, special treatment given to you (that makes you feel even more convinced of your dumbness) and a lot of damaging crap that makes you HATE reading. Kids that are meant to be late readers turn into NON-readers,due to the insanity of the compulsory schooling system.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t have to deal with any of that insanity. So why wouldn&#39;t they learn to read? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301972282">This was a great response! I was a schooled child like explained below and my <br/>
son was heading down the same road until he left school for unschooling. We <br/>
have seen the difference first hand in our home. A child labeled LD in school <br/>
CAN learn to read on his/her own at home.  Life doesn&#39;t have to look like <br/>
school to learn. Laura D<br/>

<br/>
And you will not only have been told you are a non-reader (not a future <br/>
reader, not &quot;you&#39;ll read someday,&quot; but you *are* not a reader), you&#39;ve started <br/>
being given failing grades in history and science and math, for not reading the <br/>
directions or the questions.<br/>
<br/>
All of school hinges on reading.  Late readers are destroyed to the core of <br/>
their souls and beings.<br/>

All she wanted to do was dance and twirl.  <br/>
<br/>
The teacher told her, during the second lesson, that<br/>
she danced like an elephant because she couldn&#39;t land<br/>
silently after jumping.<br/>
<br/>
She quit the class and has never danced since.  Still<br/>
says she can&#39;t.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>
