<div id="ygrps-yiv-578543667">I can only assume that letting my child have an animal is part of this <br/>
unschooling thing.  Zak told me last week he would like to have 2 rabbits <br/>
&quot;real ones&quot; he said that we could keep in the garden.  So we are going to <br/>
look at animals today, including rabbits.  Went to our 2nd hand bookstore and <br/>
found books on caring for rabbits, which lots of pictures in them (sort of DK <br/>
type books), which are are going to give him this morning before our trip.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sort of nervous about the whole rabbit thing as I don&#39;t want to end up <br/>
being the one who looks after them the majority of the time.  <br/>
<br/>
When getting animals in the past has been something your kids request how <br/>
have you handled them taking the responsibility?  What kind of research to <br/>
they (the kids) do before having and animal?  Some feedback would be helpful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest son has loved all manner of flying things since he was an infant.<br/>
When he was three he wanted to get a parakeet. I thought I was doing the<br/>
responsible parent thing by telling him I wanted him to wait until he could<br/>
take care of it... I thought that would be about age 8. Over several years<br/>
he never gave up on the idea of getting a parakeet, and he spent his money<br/>
on bird toys and a cage. When he was 7 we bought a book about parakeets and<br/>
I sat down to discuss with him the daily chores involved in caring for a<br/>
bird. Well, the chapter on cleaning the cage did him in. He decided he<br/>
didn&#39;t want a bird after all.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, I regret not getting the bird when he was 3 and eager. I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have minded helping to take care of it and I know he would have done most of<br/>
the work. OTOH, it was good for him to weigh the responsibilities and decide<br/>
he didn&#39;t want to take them on. He, however, has no regrets with this ending<br/>
and still does not want a bird. A while ago, we even went to visit a friend<br/>
of a friend who breeds parakeets (and we talked about why buying an animal<br/>
from a petstore is not a good idea.) He enjoyed looking at the birds but<br/>
still didn&#39;t want to bring one home.<br/>
<br/>
We do have animals in the house... 3 dogs and 2 cats...   but they&#39;re my<br/>
responsibility because I the one who brought them all home. ;-)<br/>
