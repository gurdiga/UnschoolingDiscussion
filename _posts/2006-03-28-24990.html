<div id="ygrps-yiv-463997022">I have 5kids (hence the name) and I just let them pick the food I buy <br/>
and let them eat it while we have it (when its gone its gone till the <br/>
next time I have the $$$ to go shopping again) <br/>
I don&#39;t limit at all and they go shopping with me or lett me know what <br/>
they like to eat so it works out pretty well.  But they know I we are <br/>
not always going to have everything they like to eat.  <br/>
One time when discribing going food shopping with me to one of the <br/>
kids friends they said just ask mom so she can say yes!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083770401">LOL. For a minute there, I couldn&#39;t figure out what an rus-ing family <br/>
was. All I could think of was Rodents of Unusual Size. :-)<br/>

Proud to be an RUS,<br/>

P.S. Maybe we should get some t-shirts printed up for the conference: <br/>
RUS with a big nutria on there. :-)</div>
