<div id="ygrps-yiv-604403844"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; MANY, stanch pro-abortionists have had an abortion, thus their<br/>
&gt; passion to support what they&#39;ve done.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve made a couple of inflamatory statements here.  Please don&#39;t, because<br/>
that&#39;s not the point of this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called pro-CHOICE, not pro-abortion.  As in, I&#39;m in favor of women<br/>
having the right to choose.  I&#39;m not in favor of telling everyone they<br/>
should have abortions.  There&#39;s a world of difference between those two<br/>
statements.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m strongly pro-choice.  I&#39;ve also never had an abortion.  Just because I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t choose to have one myself doesn&#39;t mean that I think it shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
available.  I wouldn&#39;t have breast implants, either.  But I&#39;d rather it was<br/>
done under sterile medical circumstances than by anybody who thought they<br/>
could do it.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome to think of me as your enemy.  But you should KNOW your<br/>
enemy.  Not just the stuff that your friends provide you about them, but the<br/>
things they can tell you themselves.  Listen to women here.  We might have<br/>
different views, but we&#39;re real women who hold those views.  Not the<br/>
stereotypes you might previously have held of us.<br/>
