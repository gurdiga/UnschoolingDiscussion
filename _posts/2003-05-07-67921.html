<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082543175">&lt;&lt;&lt;I was always amused that the only she things she ever claimed about <br/>
missing<br/>
about school were a prom (which she attended with a younger friend as an<br/>
adult) and riding the school bus (so she bought one to ride around in.) I<br/>
guess you can even do THAT kind of stuff later.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know. So far, I haven&#39;t seen anything negative.  I keep telling my husband <br/>
we need to buy an old school bus and let the kids paint it however they <br/>
want.  He screams Partridge Family!!!! at me, but I think it would be fun!  <br/>
Although, he&#39;d NEVER be caught dead in it.  My 6 yr old wants to go to <br/>
school desperately so she can ride the school bus.  That&#39;s her sole reason. <br/>
LOL  As if I&#39;m not weird enough to my family and others...imagine us <br/>
trekking around town in a big &#39;ol school bus!!!  Oh, just the thought makes <br/>
me want to rush out and trade my boring conversion van in.....<br/>

We once drove three hundred miles so my son could ride on a steam<br/>
locomotive for forty five minutes.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Yes, and she&#39;s ridden that bus, but it&#39;s totally different from the cramped <br/>
little schoolbuses.  The new city busses here have big spread out sideways <br/>
lounging seats and a raised up back end (over their newfangled chicken-fart <br/>
engines or whatever they have, natural gas turbines, nuclear reactors, I <br/>
don&#39;t know).<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of a little journey down Central Avenue with Holly.  She wants <br/>
to go to Jones Surplus with me.  Jones is a ratty old army surplus and used <br/>
office furniture place where the twitchy vets hang out to fantasize.  I go <br/>
there to get nylon straps and other sewing supplies sometimes.  Going there <br/>
on the bus would make it even more dangerously exotic.  Then we could go to <br/>
the anthropology museum at the university, where I regret to admit Holly has <br/>
never been.  (The boys have been, when they were younger, and for special <br/>
exhibits, but Holly was a baby.)<br/>
<br/>
I have deprived Holly of some things!<br/>
<br/>
But I also figure Holly&#39;s trailing now, but when the boys are grown and out <br/>
and Holly&#39;s the only kid left, she&#39;ll be living in luxury, Kirby&#39;s room as <br/>
her boudoir, her room as My Little Pony storage, Marty&#39;s room as a guest <br/>
room, driving a convertible...  [Keith has a convertible Dodge Valiant (I <br/>
think it is, or a Dart) in a body and upholstery shop being the last job in <br/>
trade for some stuff he did/traded years ago, and he still checks on it <br/>
sometimes.  It&#39;s his, it just isn&#39;t ready yet.  It&#39;s just becoming more and <br/>
more antique, though!]<br/>
<br/>
Ah, then we could go on down to the state  natural history museum so she <br/>
could look at hee grossing me out)<br/>
<br/>
And then back on the bus at rushhour.  That could be fun, now that I can walk <br/>
a few blocks.<br/>

<br/>
Haven&#39;t tried that, but I suspect it&#39;s the big yellow version that is <br/>
appealing to her. &lt;g&gt;  I should ask!<br/>
<br/>
Buying a bus does&#39;t seem that bad until summer comes round with no ac!<br/>

Does it have to be a big yellow bus, or will any bus work? Jaiden(alomost 5) really wanted to ride the school bus, we talked to him about how you have to just sit there in your seat and wait till they get to your stop and its always the same. But when we ride on the city bus, there are lots of different ones that go different places, there is a wire that you get to pull so the driver knows that you want to stop, some times you ride up front, sometimes in the back, you can sit on your knees and look out the window...he has no desire to ride the school bus anymore cause he kid ride on the city bus when ever he wants to. Would that work for your daughter?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337052705">It has worked for my kids!  There is a little bus system in this area<br/>
called the Southbank Shuttle that covers some ground on both sides of<br/>
the Ohio river.  It used to be only a quarter per ride...and those under<br/>
about 4  1/2 feet tall ride free.  It was a great way to get some bus<br/>
riding and see many sites in our city region.<br/>
