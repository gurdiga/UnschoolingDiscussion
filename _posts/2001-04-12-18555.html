<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007102925">I really liked the one about the soldier in New Zealand.<br/>
<br/>
We have no ghosts.  When I found out, while we were buying our house, that it <br/>
had been a halfway house (resident treatment center) for schizophrenics and <br/>
druggies (university-run), I was concerned that there might be some &quot;bad <br/>
vibes&quot; for us to suffer later, but I&#39;ve never felt anything negative. <br/>
<br/>
I asked a couple of more sensitive friends who&#39;ve been here a lot, and they <br/>
said no, it seemed totally stripped of any former activities.  <br/>
<br/>
There was one family here for a long long time (from new-house through <br/>
remodel, it&#39;s only from 1972 or so) and then nine years of rehab, and now us.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t &quot;get it blessed&quot; or anything, something that many in the Asian and <br/>
also New Age &quot;neighborhoods&quot; are doing for houses.  I hear in Japan you can <br/>
get new cars blessed (by Shinto priests?  who?).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     *I just had to reply to this one.  I also thought it was funny <br/>
when we lived there.  Every time there was an opening ceremony for <br/>
anything - a new store, school, office building, house, whatever, <br/>
before anyone stepped in the building (except the construction <br/>
workers, evidently), a priest - sometimes shinto, sometimes buddhist -<br/>
 would throw salt (to keep demons out) and say their prayer.  It&#39;s <br/>
just tradition.  Nobody pays any heed any other time.  Most people <br/>
there are kinda shinto, kinda buddhist, mostly nothing.  And the <br/>
differences between the two religions (shinto and buddhist) are <br/>
interesting, but there&#39;s no competition (if that&#39;s the right word).  <br/>
I wish I understood it better.<br/>
