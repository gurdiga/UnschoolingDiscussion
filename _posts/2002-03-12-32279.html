My 3 girls are TV addicts. It started when we moved 4 times in 2 years. I was always busy unpacking and settling in, so the the TV made a nice sitter. (I&#39;m horrible, I know). Since we&#39;ve been in one place long enough to get settled, I&#39;m trying to restrict the TV, but the adverse reactions from my 3 girls (3, 6 and 12) are loud and often.  I too notice that their behavior deteriorates with the more TV they watch.  I simply got rid of cable, and since we don&#39;t get reception where we live, except for PBS, that limited TV viewing somewhat. The other part was that I had to be assertive and tell them not to pop movies in to watch whenever they want. I let them watch an hour or 2 (if they get up early enough) in the morning, then it goes off.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 year old has it the worst. She whines for it and is more clingy when it&#39;s not on. Has anyone else had this happen? It is almost like she going through withdrawals.<br/>
<br/>
About potty training. My 3 1/2  year old is just now potty training too. We&#39;ve told her since she was around 2 1/2 that pottying is best done in the potty, but we still allowed her to wear diapers.  A couple of weeks ago, she asked to wear panties and has not had an accident since. She still wears a diaper to bed, but she does not yet wake up dry.  It was her decision to potty train not ours. My 6 year old did the same thing on her 3rd b-day. We bought her Scooby panties as a gift, and from then on she was potty trained.  It&#39;s a heck of a-lot easier than spanking and humiliation, which I&#39;m sure none of us do.<br/>

&gt; I have a 3 1/2 yr old and an 11 month old. TV seems to be an issue in my house. If I let Shawn watch all he wants and whatever he wants I find that his behavior deteriorates...so do you find that some things need to be controlled until a certain maturity occurs? or am I being too concerned over it?  I fully intend and consider myself unschooling. I don&#39;t expect Shawn to DO anything other than behave like any normal 3 yr old...and sometimes he truly surprises me and I think I have a 5 yr old in the house! He is very articulate and loves documentaries and movies about mummies. We&#39;ve had a number of conversations-which he initiated-on why people die and what happens etc, etc. He loves watching Nik jr and Disney and Noggin....and at night he always wants to watch Junkyard Wars on TLC  and of course on the weekend he cant get enough of Monster Jam on TNN :)  My boy loves monster trucks...well actually all form of motor vehicles. And my 11 month old girl seems to also enjoy playing cars<br/>
&gt; and says vrrooom quite clearly.  She also kisses all the stuffed animals and dolls in the house...of her own initiative:)  I am continually amazed at the difference between them that seems to be solely due to gender differences as I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t parent her much differently than I did him at the same age. Have any of you come across this in your family???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was  a lot longer than I intended...guess I&#39;m no longer lurking:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Beth- busy mommy to Shawn and Shannon, my precious angels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; oh...today we started intense potty training....I think I&#39;m not using the unschooling method here because I initiated it, but Shawn had NO accidents today and went to bathroom to pee a number of times without telling me! So I&#39;m pretty sure my gut instincts were right and he is ready, but was holding out for the attention due to little sister. What is your experience with this?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Hi Vivian,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Completely off topic, but have you read The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood? One of the main characters is named Vivian (Vivi for short) and seeing your name reminded me of that book. If you haven&#39;t read it, consider it! I really enjoyed it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Anyway, just thought I&#39;d share how we are unschooling in our family.<br/>
&gt;   I have 2 boys, 9 & 10 (soon to be 11) and we&#39;ve been unschooling since September. I homeschooled them for 5 years previously.<br/>
&gt;   Since we started, we have changed almost every aspect of our lives. Unschooling applies to EVERYTHING around here. After learning as much as I could about unschooling and how it works best, I figured if I wanted unschooling to work like it was supposed to, I needed to go &quot;all the way&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Since unschooling I have dropped any and all expectations required of my boys. The only thing I expect from them is to treat others and themselves respectfully and not to hurt each other.<br/>
&gt;   So, that means that I don&#39;t make them do any schoolwork anymore, like math, spelling, grammar, science, history, etc...<br/>
&gt;   They have unlimited tv viewing access all day long. I have removed the rules of when they can or can&#39;t watch tv and how long.<br/>
&gt;   They have unlimited computer and/or gameboy playing time all day long, as long as they want.<br/>
&gt;   I used to require that they do chores around the house, but I stopped that too. They even had to take turn&#39;s doing dishes every night, but that too is stopped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   What have all these changes done to our household? Brought chaos and confusion and spoiled kids you might wonder?<br/>
&gt;   No, in fact, compared to before unschooling, we have much more peace and joy and most importantly, more love. I&#39;ve found that since I&#39;ve dropped all expectations of my boys, I no longer get dissapointed in them (for something they didn&#39;t complete or accomplish). They are simply allowed to &quot;be&quot;, to do whatever they want to do. I love them and appreciate them more now than every before. My whole perception of them has changed for the better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   About chores, I have a lot of prior experiences with all different chore systems. It always ended up the same - me nagging at them to do their chores (even if they were getting paid for it) and me and them feeling terrible.<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve gone back to doing all the sweeping, vacuuming, laundry, bathroom cleaning, cooking, etc. all by myself. But you know what I found out? That when I don&#39;t require them to do chores, after a while they will spontaneously do odd cleaning jobs around the house without me telling them to do so. They really do have their own desire to help out around the house, but don&#39;t appreciate being told to do so. Imagine how you would feel if your dh TOLD you it was time to clean the toilet, wash the windows, vacuum the floors, etc. I don&#39;t know about you, but I would get pretty upset! So that&#39;s why I felt it was best to change the way we handled chores around here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Now, I&#39;m not telling ANYBODY to change their lives and live the way that we do. That would be CRAZY! :-) But I am so happy since unschooling and it has fit our family like a glove. Sorry this turned out to be so long, but I got on a roll! Just sharing.....<br/>

&gt;   I dont have any specific questions. I just would like everyone to comment on how they feel their children stay motivated. I have only been &quot;un&quot; schooling since December but I have been home schooling since October 2000.<br/>
&gt;   With our &quot;unschooling&quot; now, I dont require them to do anything but occasionally write in their journals. I also read to them daily and they have a daily quiet time. But I guess what I am asking is what are your days like? And while I have seen some progress, I worry a little about wether or not they will progress overall.<br/>

concerns that you are having. As with my 3 y.o.&#39;s withdrawal from tv -- it is good to know<br/>
that I am not alone. I don&#39;t think anyone condemned tv completely, but with those of us<br/>
who have problems, it&#39;s nice to be able to discuss them.<br/>

I am really glad to read this one. It seems so long ago that we had potty <br/>
training and the issues were so different. Lelia trained herself at 2. . . <br/>
Quinton is 2 1/2 and although he knows &quot;how&quot; to go on the potty and <br/>
occasionaly does, he is never forced. . . sometimes I ask if he wants to and <br/>
he usually says no. I am just glad to read about how when left alone, they <br/>
just do it (pretty much what I figured anyway). My fil made some comment the <br/>
other day about how next Christmas there would be no diapers (he has three 2 <br/>
1/2 year old grandchildren). I said, well, maybe, maybe not. He empatically <br/>
said they would all be out of diapers. I just don&#39;t want to make it an issue <br/>
ever.  Glad to read of others &quot;unschooling&quot; potty training.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66359752">So your advise would be to pretend that all kids are within that abstract<br/>
known as the &quot;norm?&quot;  I believe that the majority of the unschoolers, albiet<br/>
the non-vocal ones, are unschooling because they believe each child is<br/>
unique and that there is no such thing as that &quot;ideal&quot; that ps holds onto so<br/>
tightly, &quot;the norm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have found the the homeschooling community as a whole is not &quot;into&quot; that<br/>
whole &quot;norm&quot; thing either.  They are inclined to share the whole spectrum of<br/>
what may or may not be happening with any given child.<br/>
<br/>
AND, how sad it would be if a mother with that hypothetical child with the<br/>
heart condition did not say, &quot;well, there are many possibilities that come<br/>
to mind that might cause breathlessness.  My recommendation would be that if<br/>
it is a concern that you see your doctor.  In some instances that could be a<br/>
serious problem.&quot;  I would think that if the other parent is then<br/>
interested, the hypothetical mother of the hypothetical child would share<br/>
what is wrong specifically with her child.<br/>
<br/>
I also see no problem with people whose children have a unique set of<br/>
circumstances to share those circumstances.  I don&#39;t think there is in all<br/>
honesty any realistic fear that &quot;newbies&quot; will get the wrong idea.<br/>
particularly if they read any of the archieves and see how rabid some folks<br/>
become over the sharing of information on INDIVIDUAL children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779454266">Just out of curiousity, how many unschooling families do you know IRL?  And<br/>
by IRL, I don&#39;t mean someone that a person meets at some convention and<br/>
maybe visits for a week or a few days.  I mean IN REAL LIFE!  Like your next<br/>
door neightbor, someone you interact with on a regular basis, someone whose<br/>
children you witness interacting without the &quot;company is coming&quot; faces put<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
How many unschooling families do you know who have adult children?<br/>
<br/>
I know many over a period of 40 years.  I don&#39;t see this perfect little<br/>
family that lives within this perfect little curve known as &quot;normal.&quot;  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen families that breeze through the whole birth to grandparent stage with<br/>
barely a ripple.  I also know families that have seen many &quot;bumps&quot; in the<br/>
road.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have never seen an &quot;unschooler&quot; discouraged or run off by what<br/>
other folks say.  I&#39;ve seen them discouraged but go looking in another<br/>
direction.  If someone is so easily dissuaded by chitchat on the net, I<br/>
don&#39;t think they are going to get there anyway.  Unschooling is not exactly<br/>
the easy road.  It takes effort to set aside a whole life time of<br/>
programming.  It takes, to put it bluntly, starry eyed idealists who go<br/>
merrily on their way listening to no one but that inner voice that says &quot;I<br/>
know I can, I know I can&quot; or just plain stubborn folks who KNOW that there<br/>
is a different way and come h*ll or high water they are going to find &quot;it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think that all the continual harping on one person is more<br/>
likely to run off the &quot;newbie&quot; than the minor sharing of the learning style<br/>
of one child.<br/>
<br/>
It might be wise for folks to remember the unschooling is NOT some<br/>
&quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; garment.  Which as we all know is the ultimate oxymoron!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;And when that child later falls over while running, of a massive<br/>
&gt; MI what will you say to his mum?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***It&#39;s good that she allowed her child to live his/her life without fear<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the unlikely happening. (remember this is the one without a history of<br/>
heart<br/>
&gt; problems)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I really don&#39;t know know how common it is for a child to react badly<br/>
&gt; to TV, but to ignore the entire issue because it may be a minority is<br/>
&gt; wrong. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***I agree with you. I don&#39;t think ignoring it is what I am suggesting. I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; thinking it is less detrimental to new unschoolers to not bringing it up<br/>
&gt; like it is a common occurance in unschooling families.<br/>

About 50. of varying ages from birth all the way up to adulthood. We have an<br/>
extensive HS/US community where are live. I also have access to Hundreds on<br/>
the net.<br/>
The original poster and I had cleared up our converstaion at about the third<br/>
email on the thread. Since then I have been blasted by a few others. Why is<br/>
this continuing. I apologized laready to Vivian, she accepted. I stand by my<br/>
belief of what unschooling is or is not, that I won&#39;t apologize for. I came<br/>
by this belief after along time of reading, writing, debating, observing,<br/>
networking, etc. I believe that the definition for GWS is what I am<br/>
defending. Someone said it is just semantics at this point, I agree. I made<br/>
some statements here and asked some questions, clarified my views that<br/>
weren&#39;t clear and the person you are so heartily defending and I have come<br/>
to an understanding. Let&#39;s let this drop.<br/>
