<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555224941">Hi all,<br/>
Does anyone know if you hit &quot;remove&quot; or &quot;whatever&quot; for porn spam if<br/>
they really will stop or if they then &quot;have ya&quot; (kind of like<br/>
answering the phone)?  I am new to this spam stuff.  We have been<br/>
lucky or under the radar for spam in general for several years.  It<br/>
started (all types of spam) soon after using an on-line mortage<br/>
refinance site.<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.  <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Beth in MD</div>

address link, you will be adding yourself to further lists and &quot;confirm&quot; <br/>
that you want even MORE email from them!<br/>
<br/>
I suggest NOT hitting the remove button, or what have you, and either <br/>
deleting and setting up a junk mail folder or forwarding the spam to your <br/>
internet provider.  Most havean email address to forward thsoe things to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220644420">I used &#39;MailWasher&#39; to screen my email before downloading it from the <br/>
server.  It&#39;s free online (well, shareware so you send the programmer a few <br/>
bucks if you like it.)  so you can download it and use it without spending <br/>
a dime, should you so wish.<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t like a piece of email, I can choose to delete it, to blacklist <br/>
it (which means all future emails from that same address come in already <br/>
marked for deletion) or to bounce it.  Bouncing it is the most fun &#39;cause <br/>
it sends an email back that looks like it&#39;s from my server-daemon saying <br/>
that my email address doesn&#39;t exist.  It&#39;s nice knowing that I&#39;m &#39;spamming&#39; <br/>
the spammers, and possibly getting my email addy removed from their lists <br/>
as non-functional.  When I&#39;m all done previewing my email, I hit the <br/>
&#39;process&#39; button which deletes all the one&#39;s I don&#39;t want to see, leaving <br/>
only my clean email on the server ready for Eudora to download onto my <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
My spam-count has dropped significantly since using it, I think because of <br/>
the &#39;bounce&#39; option.<br/>
It&#39;s great stuff.<br/>
I don&#39;t have a URL for it, but you can google MailWasher and it&#39;s bound to <br/>
come up.<br/>
