<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554402369">If you want to make one, not out of newspaper, out of plastic or metal pipes <br/>
and have a jungle gym/ dome house out back, check out www.desertdomes.com (or <br/>
maybe desertdome.com).  It has a calculator for making different sizes.  We <br/>
haven&#39;t done it but we want to.  (What else is new?)<br/>
