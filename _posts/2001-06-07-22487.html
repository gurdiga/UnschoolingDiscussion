<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249647687">Hi, I am planning on homeschooling my 10 yr special needs son<br/>
this fall. He needs some routine and structure, but not the sit at<br/>
his desk and do worksheets all day. I do want some though. I would<br/>
like to work moree in areas he enjoys to keep his interest. If any<br/>
one has any favorite sites you would like to share I would sure<br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have been told by a friend, (cps worker) that I should count<br/>
on being turned in since he is special needs. She said she would<br/>
be the one sent and just keep good records. My question is has any<br/>
one been turned into CPS for homeschooling? and what kind of records<br/>
should I keep. There are no specifics here that I have been told<br/>
or read, just have to have 180 days of school.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Linda<br/>

&gt;Here&#39;s the latest from mom. Many times on this list I have seen folks <br/>
&gt;absolutely livid over CPS coming into homeschooling homes and trying to <br/>
&gt;remove children. I have seen folks on this list make almost identical <br/>
&gt;statements to those made by this mom. I am absolutely flabbergasted by the <br/>
&gt;rush to judgement and the lockstep attitude that concurs with what the <br/>
&gt;local brown-shirts have put out in the press.<br/>

&gt;A judge at a Monday afternoon hearing said JoAnn McGuckin could leave jail <br/>
&gt;on her own recognizance if she would agree to terms set by the State <br/>
&gt;Department of Health and Welfare around visits with her children, but she <br/>
&gt;refused to agree and remains in jail. She also demanded an apology from <br/>
&gt;government agencies for how the situation has been handled.<br/>

&gt;&quot;Those children are my children, not wards of the state. The state needs to <br/>
&gt;learn its place and that is not in family business. It is up to them to <br/>
&gt;explain their behavior to everyone because it affects us all. May the <br/>
&gt;public demand some answers. May the family be protected for ever and ever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;May they (the state) be punished for their imposition. But may affairs of <br/>
&gt;the heart be the purview of love within the home, and may they never be <br/>
&gt;confused. The Constitution of the United States of America supports this <br/>
&gt;premise.&quot;<br/>

&gt;Original Message ----- From: &quot;Vicki A. Dennis&quot; &gt; &gt; bandaid, from walking in <br/>
&gt;a &gt; &gt; public place minding our own business, I&#39;d consider it fairly severe. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, there has been no indication that this reported injury <br/>
&gt;occurred on &gt; public property. The only reference to location is that of a <br/>
&gt;person &quot;walking &gt; near the house&quot;. A house located on 40 acres and with <br/>
&gt;signs warning folks to &gt; stay away. For all we know, dogs chased and bit <br/>
&gt;someone who was either &gt; accidentally trespassing while on a nature walk or <br/>
&gt;was intent on checking out &gt; this prime property. Or perhaps refused to <br/>
&gt;continue on their way down a &gt; public road when dogs displayed protective <br/>
&gt;behavior while on private adjacent &gt; property. &gt; &gt; Are y ou saying that if <br/>
&gt;while bicycling a paved road, you or your child hit a &gt; pebble and take a <br/>
&gt;tumble, you would be upset because you would consider the &gt; ensuing broken <br/>
&gt;arm or cut on knee requiring either a butterfly bandage or 3 &gt; stitches to <br/>
&gt;be &quot;severe&quot;? &gt; &gt; My use of &quot;carried away&quot; refers to defining and usage of <br/>
&gt;the word &quot;severe&quot; , &gt; not to the emotional action one might feel for ANY <br/>
&gt;&quot;boo-boo&quot; suffered by &gt; one&#39;s babies---whether occurring on public or <br/>
&gt;private property. &gt; &gt; Vicki &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a <br/>
