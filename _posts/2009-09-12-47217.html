<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709647491">This week is the first week on unschooling. All my son wanted to do was to play video games & get on facebook. Well, he did go to the fitness center today & work out for an hour. Tuesdays he has voice lessons, which went well according to his instructor. We also went to Co-Op Thursday. The classes he takes are Guitar, Photography, & PE. The lessons go alright, but on the times he&#39;s home, he&#39;s basically doing nothing. We are enrolled in an umbrella school & I&#39;m having a hard time writing down what he does all day. Any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565690890">Well since you just started unschooling there is a process of <br/>
deschooling. and then after you have worked your way out of the stuff <br/>
you have been brainwashed with you have that which you truly want to do. <br/>
What is wrong with playing video games? if he where knitting would that <br/>
be better?<br/>
Spend time with him when he plays the games and watch the games for <br/>
awhile. this also allows you to understand the educational value of a <br/>
game so you can fill in your forms. The last week I have sat down with <br/>
my 3 boys multiple times a day to watch the same video of bear in the <br/>
big blue house. I picked an easy knitting project that kept me from <br/>
going insane and just spend time with them.<br/>
Google teacherese (think thats the word) and see how everyday activities <br/>
get turned into educational stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But most importantly let him be!! give him the opertunity to find <br/>
himself and support him in that. Do interesting things yourself and if <br/>
it interests him he will join you.<br/>
Redefine your definition of nothing, playing a game is not nothing, <br/>
chatting on facebook is not nothing.<br/>
It is important to move your mind from schooling to unschooling read <br/>
sandras site (www.sandradodd.com/unschooling) find unschooling podcasts <br/>
and online groups that hel inspire you to inspire your son.<br/>
<br/>
Was it his choice btw to leave school?<br/>
<br/>
I have been out of school for 10 years and I am still deschooling <br/>
myself, especially since having kids I notice more and more how school <br/>
is imgrained almost in my brain<br/>
