<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356476692">This is a last minute thing that came up, so I thought I&#39;d tell<br/>
interested folks, that I will be speaking west of Baltimore, as below<br/>
on October 21st. I&#39;m going to introduce material from my forthcoming<br/>
book &quot;Homeschooling and the Voyage of Self-Discovery&quot;. This will be my<br/>
one and only chance to find out whether I&#39;ve written a dud!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what the organizer wrote:<br/>
<br/>
I write to invite you to come to hear David H. Albert, author of And<br/>
the Skylark Sings with Me: Adventures in Homeschooling and<br/>
Community-Based Education (New Society Publishers, 1999) speak at<br/>
Gunpowder Friends Meeting House on Monday, October 21, 2002 at 7:00<br/>
