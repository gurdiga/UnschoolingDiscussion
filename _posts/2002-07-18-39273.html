<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010667355">SANDRA: you wrote, &quot;I can&#39;t dig up a reason to use my handwriting <br/>
with my *new* pens.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although many friends have email, I&#39;m sure they would LOVE to get <br/>
snail mail.  I know I do, and I try to write occasional notes to far-<br/>
away friends and relatives a few times a year. Am I the last person <br/>
who still uses this medium??  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe you were just being tongue-in-cheek to express the point <br/>
that people don&#39;t need good handwriting unless they want to have it.  <br/>
Sorry if I mis-interpreted.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
ALL: also just wanted to say this list is GREAT.  I am reading all <br/>
the Holt I can get my hands on and I feel more enlightened and open <br/>
minded every day!!  And &quot;listening in&quot; on your conversations is great <br/>
research for me too.  Thanks.<br/>

An old friend from my home town wrote to me (e-mail &lt;g&gt;) the other day, and <br/>
among other things mentioned that her high school boyfriend had died.  <br/>
Yesterday I was going through some photos looking for stuff to scan (because <br/>
I&#39;ve gone add-to-website-with-scanner crazy), and found a photo the guy had <br/>
sent me when he was in the navy in 1969.  So I&#39;m going to mail it to her, and <br/>
tell her she might want to ceremoniously burn it (she&#39;s been happily married <br/>
for over 25 years).  And it will definitely need a cover letter!!!  Woohoo!!  <br/>
A real excuse to use one of those pens.<br/>
<br/>
I like in the mail letters too, but with the price of postage and the risk of <br/>
loss, sometimes (Albuquerque&#39;s not bad, but some places are) I understand <br/>
when people don&#39;t want to use it!  I used to use mail a TON, and still am <br/>
surrounded by all sizes of envelopes, really nice paper, postage scales, a <br/>
tray with all denominations of postage...  detritus of a bygone era (until I <br/>
need to mail a package!)<br/>
