<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035534504">Cynthia! I had to laugh when I saw this expression. I would love to know <br/>
what you do to discourage a screaming 3-year-old. I would not have believed <br/>
without hearing the squeals, shrieks and glass-shattering screeches that <br/>
emanate from my little blond angel. It does, to say the least, disrupt the <br/>
tranquility of the home (the car, the library, the restaurant, the park....)<br/>
