<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706248757">This is something I&#39;m looking at right now... I much prefer that my house be<br/>
a mess and my children be in order, than the other way around.  So I look at<br/>
my family&#39;s attitude toward cleaning ~ NONE of the adults in my local family<br/>
clean, ALL require it of their children and/or cleaning lady.  My house is<br/>
actually on the clean side of the scale and it&#39;s sometimes a harrowing trip<br/>
thru the living room ~ past the happy laughing children, the lego<br/>
sculptures, drawings and newspapers (and now compounded by vacation schtuff<br/>
that has yet to find a home).  What does cleaning look like in my house?  A<br/>
pissy, grumpy, grumbling mommy from whom the children scatter like<br/>
chickens... who&#39;d wanna help me?  who&#39;d want THAT job?  If picking up the<br/>
house means a bad attitude, my children (and me for that matter) would<br/>
rather take their happy attitude right out of the house, as far from me as<br/>
possible.  BUT, I assert, what *could* happen if I did it joyfully?  What if<br/>
I found cleaning just as much a part of being their parent as giving birth?<br/>
My house would be clean (a relative term), I would practice joy and wonder,<br/>
my kids would want to be with me.... sounds like an amazing and attainable<br/>
goal.<br/>
<br/>
**Commercial interruption: Sandra&#39;s Peaceful Parenting talk ~ WOW!! After<br/>
the conference, I found the tape to be a powerful reinforcement to what I<br/>
discovered about myself there ~ I imagine for those who didn&#39;t go to the<br/>
conference, you will find this conversation AMAZINGLY enlightening.<br/>
One point that really hit home for me, and one I am looking at deeply in my<br/>
daily life, is the practice of being ___________.  The more time you spend<br/>
being/feeling __________, the more reinforced being ____________ is in your<br/>
life.  Do I want to work out for the pissy, grumpy marathon with my kids? or<br/>
do I want to work out for the joyful wonder marathon?  The choice is mine,<br/>
*I* choose how I invest my time and energy in my own *training* and it IS<br/>
contagous !!!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just for today, choose JOY!!!-=-<br/>

For all that has been, I say THANKS!<br/>
For all that has yet to be, I say YES!</div>

I really really like this.  It hit me like &quot;Duh!, why didn&#39;t I think of that!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are a little older, and have already experienced cleaning as a drudgery.  I think I will have a &quot;family meeting&quot; and ask the kids what they think we could do to make cleaning fun.  If we all come up with some fun and silly ideas, I think that would really help to change everyone&#39;s attitude toward cleaning in general, and maybe I&#39;d get my own needs met too.<br/>

That was one of the neatest things about that performance art group at <br/>
the conference. I don&#39;t know how many people actually sat in on that--I <br/>
saw some, left, came back and caught the end. It was really incredibly <br/>
powerful at times.<br/>
<br/>
At one point they had audience members share two different emotions they <br/>
had about unschooling, then two performance artists acted them out <br/>
together. One woman said her two emotions were &quot;They can watch tv all <br/>
day!&quot; like, cool! And, &quot;They can wach tv all day!&quot; like, how is that <br/>
okay after all I&#39;ve been told?  One performance artist had a pained, <br/>
screaming expression on her face while the other was happily munching <br/>
popcorn. In a quick, simple visual, it was so easy to see which parent <br/>
*I&#39;d* want to look like.<br/>

The word &quot;just&quot; does a lot of damage in people&#39;s minds, I&#39;m coming to believe.<br/>
<br/>
When something has a good purpose, like putting the milk back in the <br/>
refrigerator or putting socks in the laundry basket or getting hair out of the shower <br/>
drain, it might help to picture the alternative and remind yourself you had a <br/>
choice. Then it&#39;s not fun or silly or work, it&#39;s making life better by choice.<br/>

for sentimental reasons.  Take a picture of each thing and make a scrap<br/>
book.  You&#39;ll still have the memories, but they&#39;ll take up much less space.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413069964">RE: The ketchup on the floor incident.  I&#39;ve learned to circumvent<br/>
frustration on my part and obligation/embarassment/shame/hiding/sneaky<br/>
behavior on my 6yo childs part by reminding her when she brings messy food<br/>
into a room other than the kitchen the following...&quot;if it spills call me<br/>
quickly and i&#39;ll help clean it up so that it doesn&#39;t leave a sticky mess.&quot;<br/>
And I DO this with smile on my face, just as I did when she learned to walk<br/>
or when she was trying to understand a new word or if she needed help<br/>
reading a new word or wiping her butt. I will help her carry something into<br/>
another room if i think she&#39;ll have trouble carrying it without spilling.<br/>
And when she eats in another room, if i am concerned about the carpet or<br/>
furniture,  i lay down a drop cloth (old towel) under her plate or bowl<br/>
first.   If my older dd leaves something behind or clothes on floor I&#39;ll ask<br/>
her when she&#39;s leaving the room if she would bring it into the other room.<br/>
She seems to easily recognize the choice in my request and will do it if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s taken me a while to find joy in cleaning. I&#39;ve never been a neat/clean<br/>
person and am not a natural &#39;homemaker&#39; type.  Like Pam, I qualify as the<br/>
artist/organizer/social type of person.<br/>
<br/>
I used to hate/resent washing dishes (we don&#39;t have dishwasher). Why was it<br/>
my job when everyone ate? (Specifically my dh)  I&#39;ve learned to only wash<br/>
when i feel like it.  Gee he&#39;s not percieved as a slob (as i&#39;ve felt like i<br/>
am) and he doesn&#39;t seem to do it unless he wants to.  Yes that means that<br/>
there may be dishes in the sink in the morning when i get up.<br/>
<br/>
If i begin to feel the slightest resentment in washing a dish or picking up<br/>
toys or putting away crafts, books, clothes, garbage, etc.  I stop.  If I<br/>
don&#39;t want to do it now i won&#39;t.  Once i really gave myself permission to<br/>
NOT HAVE to clean cleaning became a helluva lot easier.<br/>
<br/>
It also helps to put on some really good music.  I will clean to the drum<br/>
beat of Gabrielle Roth or the jam of some good old fashion rock n<br/>
roll...punk rock can get me rockin as well.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be facinated by your hand, if you&#39;re not who will be &quot; was a statement made<br/>
by Gabrielle Roth.  This has allowed me to really enjoy washing dishes and<br/>
find the meditative peacefulness in the activity.  How can I not enjoy an<br/>
activity that allows me the opportunity to appreciate myself/mybody?<br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest freedoms i&#39;ve felt in my life was when I realized i<br/>
wasn&#39;t cleaning for my mother.  Boy did i feel emancipated and all grown up.<br/>
<br/>
Out of respect for my dh&#39;s needs after working out of the house all day we<br/>
will attempt to leave one straightened room available for him when he comes<br/>
homes so he doesn&#39;t have to sit in alot of clutter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also hired help for both cleaning and organizing.  I have found that if<br/>
i have a scheduled appointment for a teenager to come over and help with me<br/>
with my &quot;storage&quot; room...then it will happen. It&#39;s so easy to put off<br/>
organizing my stuff.<br/>

<br/>
It might help our discussion if we recognize that housekeeping has <br/>
traditionally been a very low status activity, and that feeling like <br/>
it&#39;s a &quot;lowly&quot; job can be an attitude that makes doing it more <br/>
unpleasant.  But, truthfully, many housekeeping tasks are not <br/>
particularly respected in our culture.  And the rate of pay for doing <br/>
them isn&#39;t high.<br/>
<br/>
In a craftsman&#39;s workshop, it would probably be the youngest and least <br/>
experienced or talented apprentice that swept the floor.  It&#39;s not <br/>
surprising to me that many people want to get out of doing this kind of <br/>
task once they&#39;ve done it enough times to master it.<br/>

stuff. I&#39;ve been surfing the internet, reading various sites about this <br/>
issue, and the LAST thing I want/need is a self-imposed &quot;system.&quot; That <br/>
just adds to the guilt since I can never follow anybody else&#39;s system.  <br/>
I think it is ALL about not ever doing it with resentment and not <br/>
feeling guilty when I choose to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
And, then, there is being willing to do just a bit. THAT is my big <br/>
problem way of seeing things - I see it all as one HUGE big mess to <br/>
clean up and I&#39;m not satisfied if I get a bit done. So - I&#39;m going to <br/>
just ignore that feeling and do little bits here and there. And I&#39;m <br/>
ONLY going to do it when I feel like it. And I&#39;m going to just wipe out <br/>
the guilty feelings of not getting stuff done and look at what I AM <br/>
doing instead.<br/>
<br/>
I should be able to do this - I am a true natural unschooler. I have no <br/>
problem of lack of confidence in unschooling, I totally see how the <br/>
kids doing what they are interested in works, I see that doing <br/>
something resentfully is a TERRIBLE disincentive for children, and I <br/>
know for sure how feeling like they &quot;should&quot; do something, and then <br/>
shirking on doing it, builds up a vicious circle of guilt and <br/>
resentment.<br/>

<br/>
I thought maybe that might be part of it.  Earlier you were writing <br/>
about 3 scenarios of being busy --  being late for a scheduled event, <br/>
running out the door for park day, and having your husband waiting for <br/>
you to join him to watch a movie on TV.  When I read the post, I was <br/>
thinking that in case (b) and case (c) it was theoretically possible to <br/>
spend 5 or 8 minutes cleaning before starting the next activity.  <br/>
Because I still believe (down deep in my heart, somewhere) that <br/>
incremental activity can make a difference.  But if incremental activity <br/>
is unsatisfying for you, then that&#39;s not the way to go.  (I do a lot of <br/>
things incrementally because I have a very short attention span and I <br/>
find it a huge struggle to try and stick with something until it is <br/>
completly done.  And I mean often I start unloading the dishwasher and <br/>
don&#39;t finish.)<br/>
<br/>
**And I&#39;m ONLY going to do it when I feel like it**<br/>
<br/>
I think this is good.  And like any unhappy thing that we might tend to <br/>
dwell on, you could maybe use the technique of scheduling your negative <br/>
thoughts.  When you catch yourself thinking unhappy thoughts about the <br/>
housework, you might try telling yourself (firmly) that noon on Monday <br/>
is your scheduled time for thinking about how to clean or how to <br/>
declutter and that thoughts on the subject can darn well come back at <br/>
that time for you to address them constructively.  (I&#39;m stealing a <br/>
technique that I used for awhile for scheduling worrying about money.  <br/>
There are some problems that we can&#39;t completely ignore or minimize, but <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean we should consent to let them drape themselves around <br/>
our necks and oppress us all the time.)  (If you need to physically get <br/>
away from the clutter, you might try just spiffing up a bathroom or <br/>
patio and hide out there when you need respite from the irritations of <br/>
clutter.  Or start a list of enjoyable passtimes that you can do with <br/>
your eyes closed &lt;eg&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone talk much yet about hiring help?  Is that financially or <br/>
emotionally unappealing?<br/>
<br/>
**I totally see how the<br/>
kids doing what they are interested in works, I see that doing<br/>
something resentfully is a TERRIBLE disincentive for children, and I<br/>
know for sure how feeling like they &quot;should&quot; do something, and then<br/>
shirking on doing it, builds up a vicious circle of guilt and<br/>
resentment.**<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Even possibly when pay is involved.<br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking there is some way to make some kind of economic game out <br/>
of divvying up housework.  Because clearly people vary in which tasks <br/>
they dislike most.  There&#39;s got to be some optimum way to get tasks done <br/>
while minimizing human inconvenience.  I also think that the idea of <br/>
paper snippets on the floor and pollution tax credits are somehow <br/>
linked.  Can you see that connection and explain it to me? &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m <br/>
vaguely remembering stuff in an Econ textbook about &quot;externalities&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Oh Pam, I know the feeling.  I&#39;ve read so many tricks and tips over the<br/>
years and bits and pieces have been helpful but only for a short time.<br/>
Ultimately i&#39;ve come up with my own tricks and tips that work for me.   The<br/>
best having learned to choose to not have to clean.  Eliminating all the<br/>
obligation has allowed me to be comfortable with whatever i get done...some<br/>
days more than other.  Humor helps a lot as well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think it is ALL about not ever doing it with resentment and not<br/>
feeling guilty when I choose to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
And, then, there is being willing to do just a bit. THAT is my big<br/>
problem way of seeing things - I see it all as one HUGE big mess to<br/>
clean up and I&#39;m not satisfied if I get a bit done. So - I&#39;m going to<br/>
just ignore that feeling and do little bits here and there. And I&#39;m<br/>
ONLY going to do it when I feel like it. And I&#39;m going to just wipe out<br/>
the guilty feelings of not getting stuff done and look at what I AM<br/>
doing instead.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes i decide to focus my attention on only one corner of a room or one<br/>
shelf or one drawer or one cabinet.  That way I can have a sense of<br/>
accomplishment even if the rest of the room is in total chaos or the kidlets<br/>
are right behind me fully utilizing another corner.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes i decide to take the kids and leave the house for the day because<br/>
being home is just one big glaring headlight of what i am not attending to.<br/>
And i really want to focus my attention on anything but what &#39;needs&#39; to be<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I should be able to do this - I am a true natural unschooler. I have no<br/>
problem of lack of confidence in unschooling, I totally see how the<br/>
kids doing what they are interested in works, I see that doing<br/>
something resentfully is a TERRIBLE disincentive for children, and I<br/>
know for sure how feeling like they &quot;should&quot; do something, and then<br/>
shirking on doing it, builds up a vicious circle of guilt and<br/>
resentment.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am always amazed with myself how easily I can accept, respect and give my<br/>
children what i cannot easily accept, respect and give to myself or other<br/>
adults (specifically dh).  Sometimes it takes a conscious effort to<br/>
recognize the hypocrisy of my actions and then adjust accordingly.<br/>

<br/>
In theory it may sound like a good idea, however, if one is already messy, disorganized and cluttered, the reality of having the energy, time and inclination to take pictures and catalogue them is totally out of my realm of being.  I still haven&#39;t mounted my wedding pictures (16 years later) &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My solution is to have a box (or many) and to have a closet, room, attic, or basement with a corner for all those sentimental things that accumulate that i really don&#39;t want to display and am not ready to be rid of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-54238170">In our home, getting rid of regular assigned &quot;chores&quot; has made a huge <br/>
difference.  Instead, I do as much as I can on my own, but will say, &quot;Hey, Michael, <br/>
could you please check on the bathroom and see if it needs straightening up?&quot;  <br/>
Or &quot;Travis, the food bucket (compost) needs emptying really badly&quot;  etc...<br/>
<br/>
Praise and big thank-you&#39;s go a LONG, LONG way in our home too.  I&#39;m amazed <br/>
that since getting rid of chores, the number of times has quadrupled (or more) <br/>
that the kids just jump right in and help if they see me doing something.  <br/>
Jumping in and helping them with things, especially help with finding something <br/>
they&#39;re looking for, has taught them much more than heaping guilty feelings on <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How to Talk So Kids Will Listen, and Listen so Kids will Talk&quot; has turned <br/>
our home inside out in a wonderful way too...lots more empathy with each other.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are all usually up late, so they sleep in, and getting up about 1/2 <br/>
hour to an hour before them and doing some speed cleaning (and flybaby stuff) <br/>
has helped a lot.  And probably once a month I talk my husband into taking <br/>
everyone (youngest 6) someplace and I do an all over house organizing thing while <br/>
listening to a really good book on tape.  Makes me feel great, I don&#39;t go <br/>
crazy trying to find stuff everyday (like scissors, or hairbrushes, or tape, etc) <br/>
and gives me time to do stuff I like, like try new recipes, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if the kitchen&#39;s a wreck, I&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey guys, lets get this all <br/>
cleaned up really fast and then I can make a treat for tonight.&quot;  Not bribery, I <br/>
make them something really cool because I APPRECIATE their help throughout <br/>
the day and cooking something really special is a way I can do it.<br/>

Ugh...I&#39;m like you.  I&#39;d probably live like St. Francis if I were single.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing that has helped with my 2 oldest daughters (18 and 20), who are <br/>
pack rats, is to just let them keep whatever they want, but they need to keep it <br/>
in their rooms.  If they can stand to live with so much stuff, more power to <br/>
them.  But what usually happens eventually is they realize they don&#39;t need so <br/>
much stuff, and about once a year declutter their rooms, or give half their <br/>
stuff to younger siblings!  LOL...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thrown out stuff that belongs to my husband and lived to seriously <br/>
regret it later.  I once donated a pair of pants to goodwill, that went to a suit <br/>
(jacket)...I thought, &quot;he&#39;ll never be able to fit into it again&quot;, didn&#39;t <br/>
realize it was part of a suit...<br/>
<br/>
Ugh...turns out my son CAN fit into it...it was so old it came back in style <br/>
(double breasted silky type suit...son looks like a mobster in it but still, <br/>
very classy! Hand tailored :o)  He had 2 suits that were the same, so my son <br/>
looked wonderful in the one...then my husband began looking for the pants to the <br/>
second suit...yikes...I felt like dirt.  Lets just say I learned my lesson to <br/>
only declutter my own stuff.<br/>

----------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
You described my family here too.  I am the only one who enjoys getting rid<br/>
of stuff and living with minimal stuff.  (And I&#39;ve rarely ever wanted<br/>
anything back that I threw out.) What I have done is to have two smaller<br/>
containers upstairs for paper stuff that is saved.  (one for each kid) and<br/>
when it is full, I move it to plastic bags, date it, and put it in those big<br/>
Rubbermaid buckets and date them and when they are full, put them in the<br/>
basement closet.  We are going to build shelves, some day, to stack those<br/>
buckets on so we can fit them floor to ceiling in the basement closet, which<br/>
is quite large.<br/>
 <br/>
If something is debatable when it comes to throwing it out.  Like a gum<br/>
wrapper that is really a horse leg wrap, or something.  I put it in the<br/>
pantry on a shelf and if someone asks for it, I find it.  If no one asks for<br/>
it in a couple of days, then I throw it out.  My kids even save cereal<br/>
boxes.  I let them play with them until they are bored with them, they move<br/>
to the shelf and if no one asks for it in a few days, I throw it out.  <br/>
 <br/>
I feel like I am meeting my needs to not live in a house filled with trash<br/>
and I am meeting their needs to allow them to play with stuff till they&#39;ve<br/>
had their fill.  It is a compromise because they wouldn&#39;t actually choose to<br/>
throw away the cereal boxes ever and I would choose to throw them out<br/>
immediately. When they ask if they can have a cereal box when it&#39;s empty, I<br/>
make sure I say, you can have it to play with for a while.  It&#39;s so hard<br/>
having kids who don&#39;t want to part with anything.  My dh is just like that<br/>
and it&#39;s a challenge to keep the house livable because their just isn&#39;t a<br/>
place for everything.<br/>

I agree. The reason I&#39;ve actually gotten something out of reading <br/>
Flylady, though, is that I&#39;m doing the same things as before, just <br/>
making them easier. It used to be overwhelming to get myself and the <br/>
kids ready in the morning and actually get us out the door. I took a <br/>
leap of faith and made a checklist (yuck) and followed it every day <br/>
for a month or so. For me, in that situation, it was so much easier <br/>
to be focused on checking items off than feeling overwhelmed, being <br/>
mad (at whom?) for having to do it by myself, etc. Now it&#39;s...not a <br/>
routine, but a rhythm that works for me. Making myself do it for a <br/>
while got me to learn to do it well, instead of feeling bad and <br/>
giving up. <br/>

for 10 minutes (or until you have to leave or until a child needs <br/>
you) and you&#39;re focusing on getting a lot done in that time, you <br/>
think less about how large the mess is. <br/>
<br/>
What would you most like to change about your house right now? <br/>
Something big or little. And how would spending 5 or 10 or 15 minutes <br/>

Is it really fair to basically tell kids the only part of the house that is <br/>
theirs is their own room?  If they packed a box up really well wouldn&#39;t you be <br/>
able to find a place to store it (shed, basement, store room, under your bed, <br/>
in the bottom of a shared closet) for when they&#39;re grown?  When they&#39;re grown, <br/>
they won&#39;t be living in just one room, and it would be too bad for them to <br/>
have had to get rid of things for arbitrary reasons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757704197">My mom threw away just about everything (she actually accidentally threw away her wedding rings, they were in a napkin drying from being cleaned, she never got them back).  A friend of my mine had a whole box of toys to give to her son when he was born that she had played with. Some were from her mom and dad when they were kids.  It made me sad that I don&#39;t have hardly anything left from my childhood because my mom would throw or give everything away, not one blanket, toy, art project, card I made, nothing I would of like to have.  I got one box when they sold their house.  It had some meaningless twirling trophies and a couple of ribbons and crowns from pageants that I did when I was little.  Nothing that meant a thing to me, but clearly these were important to my mom, so she kept them.  She did save a box of books for us and I have enjoyed reading those to my son.  He can keep whatever he wants.  Periodically, we go through his stuff looking for items he doesn&#39;t want anymore.  He has a roomful of toys, but still plays with some of his baby things.  I have also saved some of his clothes and toys for him (and me).  I think my mom is understanding now a little bit.  When my grandmother died recently, she called me and asked what would I like to have as a keepsake.  She picked out quite a few things and brought them to me.  Things that really remind me of my grandmother.  My mom just really hates clutter and her stepmom kept everything.  So, I think it must skip a generation or something. Probably from a need created by the prior generation.  I&#39;m very sentimental about certain things.<br/>

<br/>
This is just like my mom. My mother would methodically declutter every year and give <br/>
away or throw away everything that had a cracked lid or was a bit worn. That meant <br/>
perfectly good games were given away, toys that were no longer new and so on.<br/>
<br/>
When my aprents divorced, all the family films and many of the family photo albums <br/>
disappeared too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m much more sentimental about stuff as a result and hang on to things just for what they <br/>
signify to me (I kept a plastic bag that came from Morocco for five years until it wore out <br/>
just because I had bought it when living there).<br/>
<br/>
What I am trying to do now is to at least keep the sentimental stuff organized and to really <br/>
get rid of the stuff that is just making me crazy (or making me trip &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Emilie Barnes used to say, &quot;You can be a pack rat. Just be an organized pack rat.&quot; That <br/>
helped me to not feel guilty for keeping what other people might jettison.<br/>
<br/>
(I  did manage to keep every diary or journal I&#39;ve ever owned in spite of four international <br/>
moves. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t succumb to the advice, &quot;You&#39;ll never look at thoswe again.&quot; Not <br/>
true.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it really fair to basically tell kids the only part of the house that is<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is another instance where words are conjuring different images.<br/>
I could be wrong since Nancy implied she&#39;d live without much stuff if she<br/>
were single, but stuff that pack rats accumulate doesn&#39;t bring up images of<br/>
video games and magazines and letters from friends and Pokemon figure<br/>
collections for me. It brings up images of broken pens, children&#39;s menus,<br/>
rocks, mail solicitations, candy wrappers, bottle caps, rusty bolts, pencil<br/>
nubs, ...<br/>
<br/>
So as far as pack rat treasures are concerned, it&#39;s a *big* help to me if<br/>
Kat keeps all that stuff in her room. (Rooms actually ;-) And I keep my pack<br/>
rat stuff that might look like trash in my computer room. And Carl keeps his<br/>
pack rat stuff on his desk and the alcove. It&#39;s a way of protecting it and<br/>
not putting the burden of deciding what to do with it on someone else.<br/>
<br/>
When the whole house is a dumping ground for pack rat stuff, there&#39;s no<br/>
pressure to ask yourself &#39;Do I really want to keep this?&quot; Infinite space<br/>
tends to accumulate infinite stuff. At least for pack rats! ;-)<br/>

Reminds me of the photos I took to sell some baby clothes on Ebay. They <br/>
looked so cute and I was so sad to see them go then came Nicholas....and Cameron&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This past week after the convention I was on my Holt kick again. I bought <br/>
&quot;What Do I Do Monday&quot; and a 1964 &quot;How Children Fail&quot; for 7.00 on Ebay. I dont <br/>
need them but I wanted to have them to read and thought how cool to have some of <br/>
his older books/versions. <br/>
<br/>
I also was moving books and stumbled upon a 1938 &quot;The Little American Girl&quot; <br/>
book that I may not need but thought again gee this is a very old book I think <br/>
I&#39;ll hold this for a while. Maybe its the old version of the American Girl <br/>
books and some family may think its pretty neat someday. Then there is the <br/>
Gymdandy that I found last week (3 seat seesaw from the 70&#39;s) that I plan to <br/>
refinish for the kids. <br/>
<br/>
We also have many, many toys in every room. Having four kids I dont want them <br/>
to feel they didn&#39;t have things of their own. For example we have 3 pedal <br/>
cars, 2 cozy coups, 3 scooters, 3 wagons, 2 swing sets (outside thank goodness) <br/>
and boxes and boxes of trucks,dolls,blocks and more blocks and bigger blocks. <br/>
Barbies, houses, people, a large box of fast food toys and a lot of VCR <br/>
tapes..... My home is much too full and i would be happier with less stuff (I think) <br/>
but they wouldn&#39;t be. (most of the above items were given to us)<br/>
<br/>
Its nearly impossible to keep this place uncluttered and Ive pretty much <br/>
given up on worrying what my mother would say (she moved to SC anyway). As a child <br/>
my Mom was a neat freak and still is. She has wasted years cleaning to the <br/>
point of madness and misery. I think I went the other way just because it made <br/>
me so sad that cleaning was more important than playing with me.<br/>
<br/>
What are my (4) kids going to say as adults? Mom I hate you because you <br/>
played with me and didn&#39;t spend hours picking up the same stuff over and over <br/>
again.. I dont think so. They know I pick up I just dont say im sorry I cant <br/>
play/go/do because you/I made this mess and I need to pick it up. Ive been known to <br/>
leave the house and a trail behind me it will be there when we get back. Shut <br/>
the door and enter sunshine :)<br/>
So that said, if any who live near me come to visit my home is not free from <br/>
blocks, cars and toys in every room. Oh and boxes of books (while I wait for <br/>
my husband to build a few book cases oh and maybe an addition&lt;G&gt;) I think after <br/>
writing this ive come to realize that my husband and I are living our missed <br/>
childhood&#39;s though our kids..<br/>

This is the well known corollary to Murphy&#39;s Law:<br/>
<br/>
The stuff expands to fill the space available.<br/>
<br/>
Also a useful addition that always seems to apply on a movie set:<br/>
<br/>
The work expands to fill the time available.<br/>
