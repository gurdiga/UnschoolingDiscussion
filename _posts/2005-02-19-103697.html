<div id="ygrps-yiv-618922808">-=-Another thing that made reading very important to me is that I am dyslexic. I was deemed unteachable by the school I attended.-=-<br/>
<br/>
One of my kids would&#39;ve been labelled dyslexic.  It&#39;s not &quot;a thing he is,&quot; it&#39;s a problem the school would&#39;ve had getting him to travel on their assembly line&#39;s schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
The really good thing about unschooling is that it doesn&#39;t matter what a child&#39;s strengths or weaknesses are, if all sorts of input is available, each child will learn in his or her own way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It made me so upset and I felt like a failure because I couldn&#39;t read that much and didn&#39;t understand why.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, this doesn&#39;t happen with unschoolers.  And kids who have access to other ways of getting information don&#39;t have to wait impatiently for the information in books. They can start getting it other ways and when they do learn to read they&#39;ll start at an advanced level rather than with one-syllable words and nonsense stories for &quot;practice reading.&quot;<br/>
