 </span></blockquote>    To me the true definition of unschooling is child/student directed <br/>
learning, with the child making the choices and the parent seeing his/herself <br/>
as a facilitator rather than as a teacher. For each child this will look <br/>
different. For one it may look nothing like &quot;school&quot; while another may be <br/>
really into academic pursuits. The key is that the child is being supported <br/>
in making choices that work for him/her rather than being imposed on by the <br/>
adult&#39;s picture of things.  Also academic pursuits are generally suited to <br/>
the older child&#39;s brain (depending on the individual development). All of my <br/>
kids learned to read in a mostly organic way; the oldest one at 4 and the <br/>
other two at around 8 or 9 years old.<br/>
     We have always been unschoolers partly based on the interests and <br/>
learning style of our oldest, Jenny,who is now 19. Also philosophically I <br/>
believe in unschooling. Over time however the younger two kids, Ariana and <br/>
Michael. now aged 11 & 15 started wanting more of an academic focus for a <br/>
variety of reasons. We are now living in California and  they are enrolled in <br/>
a distance learning charter school. This provides some structure without <br/>
feeling oppressive and a share of public school tax money to order the <br/>
materials of our choice. <br/>
     This would never have worked for Jenny, who is artistically and <br/>
dramatically motivated. She would have found the academic categories <br/>
(English, Science, etc.) restrictive and unworkable. To me unschooling is not <br/>
a set path but a journey of exploration that is unique to each child and each <br/>
family. We still consider ourselves to be unschoolers since being in the <br/>
charter school is their choice. In fact the way I found it was by exploring <br/>
public school independent study programs at my son&#39;s request. I feel that <br/>
each of us in our family is successfully in progress with becoming who we are <br/>
meant to be. Good luck with finding your way. -Amalia Darling-</div>

John, your son sounds perfectly normal to me. Isn&#39;t 8-12 the average for<br/>
boys to start reading if left to do it naturally?<br/>
<br/>
My 2nd daughter is 8-1/2 and is reading only haltingly. She is absolutely<br/>
determined to read Harry Potter (which we already read aloud...we are really<br/>
behind the times...we&#39;re only on the 2nd book now). She sits there every day<br/>
and slowly but surely reads that book. She&#39;s so proud when she finishes a<br/>
chapter. Must be a pain to be the younger sister of a book devourer. But I<br/>
know she&#39;s going at her natural pace so I try to tell her not to worry about<br/>
it that she isn&#39;t as fast as others her age. At least she won&#39;t develop a<br/>
fear or hatred of reading.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, not all ps kids are reading by 6, for one thing.  That&#39;s 1st grade <br/>
around here and they are still learning their sounds and are beginning <br/>
readers.  <br/>
<br/>
And each kid is different.  That&#39;s what I explain to my daughter anyway.  My <br/>
son read at 4 1/2 yo but my daughter is already the ripe old age of almost-6 <br/>
and is a beginning reader.  She actually reads better than she will admit but <br/>
that&#39;s another story.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the whole idea that all 6 year-olds will be reading at the same time <br/>
is just silly so maybe a smile for the rude stranger and a hug for your <br/>
daughter would be the best answer to anyone needing one.<br/>
<br/>
And I think a large part of why your friend talks about reading is that that <br/>
is all they teach in the lower grades.  That&#39;s the major emphasis.  Now, if <br/>
your child likes math or science or art beyond coloring, there aren&#39;t that <br/>
many opportunities to shine.  But if you can read, but not to too well <br/>
because then you are ahead of the pack, then you are doing just what the <br/>
teacher wants you to do.<br/>
<br/>
Let me just say that my K daughter (pre-reader/beginning reader) would be <br/>
just as bored with coloring a latter a week as my son was at that age (when <br/>
he was a full-fledged reader). (Yes, he went to K -- for 7 months.)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

 I am new to this list and had to jump in here. I am<br/>
SO glad to know that I am not the only one with a late<br/>
reader. My middle son will be 8 in Dec. and is still<br/>
struggling to read. He can read the first couple Bob<br/>
books and that is about it. <br/>
 Today he knows his alphabet and sounds, tomorrow he<br/>
doesn&#39;t. It is so fustrating because he is so advanced<br/>
in just about everything he does except reading. <br/>

He struggled and cried many a night trying to get the reading down.  He learned over the summer when he was ready, without even really trying.  It just came to him.  The book he learned to read on was James Fennimore (sp?) Cooper&#39;s Last of the Mohicans.  He is now a voracious and insatiable reader, with lightning speed and impressive comprehension.  Some of the things he reads are too heady for me, and I was reading at 4, self taught, and I am a very language oriented person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114547458">Hello,<br/>
I am very new to the idea to unschooling and would love to <br/>
understand more about it. I have been homeschooling our two youngest <br/>
children since kindergarten, they are now it 3rd and 5th.  I also <br/>
home schooled our older girls for about 4 years so there is such a <br/>
ingrained feeling that I need to continue although I feel that my <br/>
children do much better when I let them pick the subject areas that <br/>
interest them and delve abit more into it than what the text books <br/>
offer. So............. where do I start. <br/>
I live in Arkansas and they have mandatory testing in the 5th, 7th <br/>
and 10th grades. So I have that that I will have to somehow have to <br/>
deal with. <br/>
I also would like to know how do you all really teach the kids. I <br/>
know that I have desided this year to try to get as much as I can <br/>
off of the internet. I would guess the biggest subject area that I <br/>
really finding difficult to find is math that is taught as a fun <br/>
game that will slowly build up on its self teaching as they have <br/>
fun. I would appriciate any help anyone could offer.<br/>

I have fun every day.  My only complaint about unschooling these days, is<br/>
that it&#39;s sort of ruined vacation for me.  Vacation from what?  Having fun?<br/>
We can travel, play, relax, etc. any day.  I don&#39;t know how to vacation<br/>
anymore.  (Maybe I should go to school for 2 weeks every year.  It would be<br/>
different at least.  Hmmm....nah!)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, letting them pick the subjects will work better than you or the<br/>
textbook picking.<br/>
<br/>
Even better is letting them live life and learn from living. :-) Don&#39;t you<br/>
learn a lot faster, better and more enjoyably when you&#39;re learning something<br/>
you want to -- like knitting, cooking, gardening, whatever you&#39;ve learned in<br/>
the past out of interest -- than when you&#39;re learning something you see no<br/>
point in learning that someone is insisting is important and won&#39;t give you<br/>
the choice about learning or not?<br/>
<br/>
It makes new unschooling parents very nervous! :-) Unschooling doesn&#39;t look<br/>
at all like school. It looks like summer vacation but with parents who are<br/>
more &quot;with&quot; their kids, more attuned to the kids&#39; needs (as opposed to what<br/>
the experts tell us the kids need): letting the kids hang as much as they<br/>
need, providing *opportunities* for them to do things, taking them places,<br/>
connecting our lives together -- without attaching them to us ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What are the consequences? Does the state take some action? What action? At<br/>
what percentile?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the law summary and link to more information from National Home<br/>

<br/>
It looks like you can delay the test by just telling the state they&#39;re in<br/>
grades that are 2 lower (depending on their ages) than what they would<br/>
normally be in. (&quot;... student must not be more than two years beyond the<br/>
normal age for the appropriate grade&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
It says at the link &quot;The law used to say that children who didn&#39;t perform<br/>
well on the standardized test could be forced into government school. That<br/>
provision is GONE!!!!&quot;<br/>

It says on another page:<br/>

<br/>
Q: Do homeschooled students have to be tested by the state or attain a<br/>
minimum test score to be able to continue home schooling?<br/>
<br/>
A: Homeschooled students do not have to attain any minimum score in order to<br/>
continue home schooling. They must take the same norm-referenced test at the<br/>
same grade levels as public school students. Currently, public school<br/>
students are tested in grades 5, 7 and 10 using the SAT9.<br/>
<br/>
(But please do read the websites yourself. One of our best allies is being<br/>
informed :-)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Tia. It isn&#39;t fair to the kids or our ability to help them<br/>
learn naturally to assume that natural learning will keep them on the same<br/>
track as public school. It won&#39;t. Their track will be as unique as our<br/>
children are. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Especially math. Not because math is hard but because of the way math is<br/>
taught. Learning math naturally means slowly building up a picture of how<br/>
numbers work by using them. It&#39;s the same way they&#39;ve learned English.<br/>
(Which has worked splendidly hasn&#39;t it? :-) It&#39;s like the jigsaw puzzle Pam<br/>
mentioned before. Learning naturally means building tiny sections over the<br/>
whole thing, putting in bits and pieces and making connections here and<br/>
there. In school they don&#39;t get to look at the picture on the box and they<br/>
start in the top corner and work painstakingly across. If kids see some<br/>
connection somewhere else the teachers tell them to set it aside and they&#39;ll<br/>
get to that later.<br/>
<br/>
So when they&#39;re tested, the kids *aren&#39;t* tested on what they know. They&#39;re<br/>
*only* tested on what they know of the stuff across the top of the puzzle.<br/>
If the schools had decided to test your kids on how well they were acquiring<br/>
language and they had little interest in standard kid stuff but could<br/>
expound about dinosaurs, they might test &quot;behind&quot; but would that really mean<br/>
they were behind? Or would it really mean they knew *different* stuff?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also would like to know how do you all really teach the kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The same way I &quot;taught&quot; her to walk and speak and read. I created an<br/>
environment -- well, just by living life actually! -- that made those things<br/>
useful and enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I <br/>
&gt; know that I have desided this year to try to get as much as I can<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning math from games is great. Using games as a way to get math into<br/>
kids can make kids avoid games. It&#39;s like deciding kids need to learn to<br/>
hammer so finding a lot of projects for them to do that you think they&#39;d<br/>
find fun. What if they don&#39;t? What if they&#39;d rather do something else? If we<br/>
assume that the projects are necessary to learn hammering, we&#39;ll get<br/>
nervous. But if we realize that tool use is leared as a *side effect* of<br/>
doing what interests you, then it can help ease our worries and see learning<br/>
in a whole new way.<br/>
<br/>
Math is a tool. It helps us understand the world better. It helps us compare<br/>
things and make connections. But unless the kids are curious about the world<br/>
and wanting to make the connetions then math is pointless. (And they *will*<br/>
be curious unless we get in their way!)<br/>
<br/>
So play games for fun. :-) Play board games. Software. Dice games. Yes, even<br/>
video games! The user&#39;s guides are full of charts and maps and statistics<br/>
that schools spend tedious hours trying to get into kids. But kids will<br/>
study the guids *for fun*! Because the point of the game is figuring out the<br/>
puzzle, not doing the math. The math is just a tool for figuring out the<br/>
game :-)<br/>

&gt;I live in Arkansas and they have mandatory testing in the 5th, 7th<br/>
&gt;&gt; and 10th grades. So I have that that I will have to somehow have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; deal with. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh hey!  I missed this....who is it???<br/>
<br/>
Joyce was doing a very good job at describing the testing, etc.  The <br/>
test is NOT AN ISSUE.  Local homeschoolers in Arkansas (the Christian <br/>
fundy kind for sure) will give you a hard time about your cavalier <br/>
attitude.  Most everyone there is still hung up on if the tests are <br/>
showing homeschoolers are good enough.  I say, :PPPPPP to that.  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Definitely, DEFINITELY register your child 2 years behind (how old are <br/>
they?).  The schools get to decide what grade they put someone in.  So <br/>
do you!  Some homeschoolers are so smart they skip 5th, 7th and 10th <br/>
grades altogether!  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t live in Arkansas anymore.  What part do you live in?  I can get <br/>
you in touch with some unschooly folks in the Little Rock area, if you like.<br/>

I am in Arkansas also and I hadn&#39;t even thought about skipping a grade like that!  My son is 4th grade (by their standards) and we don&#39;t have to worry about testing until next year but I am already a little worried for him.  He is very shy and he get so nervous in new situations.  He tends to vomit from the anxiety.  :(  I don&#39;t think he would have any problem with the materials on the test, it&#39;s just the actual taking of the test that would freak him out. Could you actually skip 3 grades and not have anyone from the state knocking on your door asking why you have never tested your child??   I am not very good at intentionally &#39;breaking the rules&#39; so I guess this is why I would be hesitant to do it.  <br/>

more than a year, so you can just mail your intent form in....just keep <br/>
him back in 4th another year, and then next year he&#39;s in 6th grade.  <br/>
<br/>
It has been my experience that no one compares the records from last <br/>
year, but there are some superintendents (like the one in Riverview) who <br/>
seem to be &quot;out to get&quot; homeschoolers.  The thing is, it is NOT illegal <br/>
to do this.<br/>

As for unschooling &quot;going against God&#39;s word&quot;, NO WAY.  I&#39;m a Catholic Christian, go to our Catholic Bible study weekly, belong to a Catholic Homeschool group and list and never, never have found or heard of anything in the Bible that should make one think unschooling is against God.  The Catholic Christians that I know are very child centered.  Some unschool, some eclectically homeschool, and some do use curriculums,  but most, I think, not in an authoritarian style.  My youngest child, dd8, is currently unschooling, while my middle child, ds10, is an eclectic.  (Even these lables bother me some).  <br/>
<br/>
Basically, you may see quite a different attitude in homeschooling practices between Protestant Christians and Catholic Christians.  But then, this generalization too, may not be fair to those that are very tuned in to their childrens needs and many, many are.  There is a Catholic Christian parenting author/child psychologist/ homeschooling dad that has written a book advocating breastfeeding, extended nursing, attachment parenting, and homeschooling.  His name is Greg Popcak and can be found on the web.  <br/>
<br/>
Please be assured that I am not trying to convert you or anyone else on this list to Catholocism, just answering your concern from my experience.  I just hate to see religion divide people when we have so much in common and just want to love our children the best that we are able.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637725536">Hi Rachel<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really an unschooler, just researching options at this point, <br/>
but your question had me thinking. The only concern I would have, <br/>
would be that children, being humans, and the human heart <br/>
being &quot;deceptive&quot; as the Bible says, would more readily choose to do <br/>
wrong or foolish things, than good things, if allowed to choose <br/>
without any guidance. But! If you as a parent model wise or good <br/>
choices, your kids will follow your example. <br/>
<br/>
As for educating by this style...well, the Bible says &quot;tell these <br/>
words to your children when you rise, and when you walk along the <br/>
way, and when you lie down to sleep.&quot; I would say that unschooling is <br/>
closer to that description, than buying curriculum, sitting them down <br/>
and making them do school for a set number of hours, and then letting <br/>
them go back to life. That life is loaded with learning, is a very <br/>
Biblical concept. separating their learning from their lives doesn&#39;t <br/>
ring true to me. <br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi<br/>

&gt;   book advocating breastfeeding, extended nursing, attachment parenting,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   homeschooling.  His name is Greg Popcak and can be found on the web.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Please be assured that I am not trying to convert you or anyone else<br/>
on<br/>
&gt;   this list to Catholocism, just answering your concern from my<br/>
experience.  I<br/>
&gt;   just hate to see religion divide people when we have so much in common<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   just want to love our children the best that we are able.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Peace,<br/>
