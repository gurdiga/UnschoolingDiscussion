<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703585858">I&#39;ve been subbed to the digest for a few weeks now and figured it was<br/>
time to introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Lesley- I have a 4yo (5 in January) son, Logan.   We live in<br/>
Pennsylvania.  I have a teaching certificate for this state, otherwise I<br/>
would imagine unschooling would be a bit difficult here (though I&#39;ve<br/>
heard of plenty of folks who do it!).  I am finally a SAHM after several<br/>
years of working outside the home full time and I&#39;m expecting my second<br/>
baby in March.  My dh and I have been happily married for over 7 years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be trying to just lurk for a while because I get and send way too<br/>
much email already..and I have lots to do for the holidays!  Hi to those<br/>
of you I&#39;ve met elsewhere before- looks like I&#39;m in good company here!<br/>
