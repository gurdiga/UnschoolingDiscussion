Do these types of schools accept unschoolers?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ALL schools accept unschoolers (except maybe Bob Jones and the like! &lt;g&gt;). <br/>
There may be more hoops to jump through in some than in others (large state <br/>
schools seem to be tougher than smaller schools). Many schools are seeking out <br/>
unschoolers, as the kids they&#39;ve recently had as students are SO interested and <br/>
interesting----as opposed to the typical high school graduates. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting in on a Sociology-101 class right now. It&#39;s pathetic to look <br/>
around and see the apathy on the kids&#39; faces. They&#39;re PAYING (or at least Daddy&#39;s <br/>
paying for them) to be there. They don&#39;t WANT to be there. They are so <br/>
disinterested! <br/>
<br/>
Cameron and I are very involved in the class----asking questions, answering <br/>
questions, interjecting jokes, etc. The only other one in the class that gives <br/>
a rat&#39;s butt is the young man sitting next to me. He&#39;s Middle Eastern and glad <br/>
to be there. The other kids are sleeping (one actually SNORED!), doing <br/>
homework from another class, day-dreaming, chatting with each other. And this is NOT <br/>
a boring class. Teacher is very animated and interesting and bright and <br/>
engaging. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a night class. He said he prefers the night classes to day classes <br/>
because he usually gets more adults that sign up. The kids are ALWAYS like this! <br/>
