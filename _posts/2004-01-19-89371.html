I read something somewhere about you wanting to be a writer. Your <br/>
posts are always inspiration to me and often my hubby.So last night <br/>
when we were playing Scattagories we needed an authors name. It <br/>
needed to start with L.. And you were it.I did not have time to <br/>
access my full brain and your name was the one out in front for me. <br/>
No one even questioned my answer at all.. SO FYI besides being a <br/>
inspiring poster you are a recognized author..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-40785416">Well...gee...ummmm...I don&#39;t know what to say!  (I&#39;m not used to being left speechless, lol.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Kathleen.  What a nice thing to say.  I don&#39;t usually find myself very inspiring, but it&#39;s nice to know that someone does.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Scattagories....now there&#39;s a game we haven&#39;t played in a while.  Maybe I&#39;ll suggest that tonight.  <br/>
<br/>
See!  You&#39;re inspiring me too!<br/>
