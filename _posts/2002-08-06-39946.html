<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611768012"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;But - my point is that it isn&#39;t the &#39;funding source&#39; of the school that I <br/>
&gt;&gt;object to or that John Holt was writing about - it isn&#39;t because the <br/>
&gt;&gt;public schools are government-schools. My objections to &quot;schooling&quot; are <br/>
&gt;&gt;just as much relevant to private schools and to parents who use similar or <br/>
&gt;&gt;even worse method on their own kids at home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. When I first started homeschooling the concept of &quot;government <br/>
schools&quot; really bothered me. But the longer I&#39;ve been at this, the more I&#39;ve <br/>
come to realize that it&#39;s the concept of compulsory schooling in any form <br/>
that is the culprit. It&#39;s the idea that there is a timetable for learning <br/>
and that it can be structured and broken down and imposed on children. It&#39;s <br/>
all those schoolish ideas  about how things are done, how things must be <br/>
done, that I feel are really damaging to children and the thinking and <br/>
learning process in general.<br/>
