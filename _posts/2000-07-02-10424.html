<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618557499">I was trying to think of a snappy name for this, but my brain&#39;s <br/>
stopped working.  I wanted to add a comment to the bit about <br/>
children with health problems being blessings on their families.  <br/>
The nail-bomber who killed several people in a bomb attack on a <br/>
pub in Soho in London was found guilty and sentenced last week of <br/>
murder.  On of our current affairs programs ran a long segment on <br/>
far-right-wing websites where this individual found the instructions <br/>
and encouragement to do what he did.  One of the people <br/>
interviewed worked for an anti-fascism organisation, but had himself <br/>
been part of the neo-nazi movement.  What changed his mind was <br/>
that he had a son born with cleft lip and palate, and would therefore <br/>
be euthanised by his peers in the event of their coming to power.  <br/>
What a wake-up call!!!<br/>
