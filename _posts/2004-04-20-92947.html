&lt;&lt; So the idea is that it i my job to provide a rich environment, be <br/>
watchful<br/>
for &quot;sparks&quot; and then help him pursue those interests by providing more<br/>
opportunites (trips to the library, relevant &quot;field trips&quot;, etc.)? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kinda, but library and field trip should be only two of fifty things <br/>
you&#39;ll<br/>
eventually consider I hope.<br/>
<br/>
-=- SOme obvious (today he said he&#39;d like to tour a car<br/>
wash and a place that builds cars) -=-<br/>
<br/>
You can tour a car wash just by taking your car to be washed.<br/>
&quot;To tour&quot; sounds so formal.<br/>
To hang out and watch is doable every day.<br/>
<br/>
I like to watch the produce guys work at the grocery store.  You don&#39;t <br/>
have<br/>
to get a tour.  Just stall while you&#39;re there, and watch what they&#39;re <br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
How about flower shops?  You don&#39;t have to be needing to buy flowers <br/>
just to<br/>
go in and look around, and you might get to see them arranging or making<br/>
things.   BIG floral seasons coming up, with proms and mothers&#39; day.   <br/>
Even if you<br/>
don&#39;t think you&#39;re interested, I bet you&#39;d find interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
-=So he shows a spark.... then what? How involved do I become at that <br/>
point to<br/>
where it is still considered &quot;unschooling&quot;?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to plan your next many years, just live today.  <br/>
What&#39;s he<br/>
doing right now?<br/>
<br/>
Learn it by doing it.  Like riding a bike.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree. My son was very into trains for a long time. We spent many <br/>
pleasant afternoons parked near the freight yards, just watching <br/>
trains. Train museums were nice too, and the funky/weird/cool guy who <br/>
ran the train bookstore locally, and model train shows, and Lego <br/>
train exhibitions, and all that, but just watching the trains was <br/>
loads of fun for him. My dad loved trains as a boy and he used to go <br/>
hang out at the switching yards and catch rides on all of the <br/>
locomotives that were switching cars around(probably can&#39;t do that <br/>
anymore due to liability, but what fun.) He still loves trains and <br/>
sends me links all the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, we could consider our weekly trip to the Farmer&#39;s market a <br/>
regular field trip. We talk to the beekepers, hang out with the lady <br/>
who makes homegrown jam, the organic farmers, the person whose <br/>
chickens lay multi-colored eggs, we listen to the guys playing <br/>
washboard and bucket-bass and fiddle on the corner and just people-<br/>
watch in general. Of course more organized field trips are lots of <br/>
fun too, just that there&#39;s also a lot you can see just by being <br/>
around in the daytime with your kids and doing your regular thing.<br/>
