&lt;&lt; Lars is like this.  His team went to the Western Canadian Fastball<br/>
<br/>
Championship a couple of years ago.  They didn&#39;t get a medal, but Lars won<br/>
<br/>
the MVP award.  He didn&#39;t call to tell me about it.  He didn&#39;t say anything<br/>
<br/>
about it when he arrived home.  (The other coach had come back a day early<br/>
<br/>
and mentioned it to me.)  I had to ask him about it.  I also had to prompt<br/>
<br/>
him to at least tell a few family members about it.  And it was the same<br/>
<br/>
reason.  He&#39;s a team player. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Awards are given as gratitude, though, and if a coach doesn&#39;t express his <br/>
gratitude then he&#39;s a churlish guy and others will resent that.  If a leader <br/>
of a volunteer project doesn&#39;t acknowledge the hardest-working volunteers <br/>
SOMEhow, and doesn&#39;t publicly thank the mom who brought the lunches and water <br/>
bottles, then he might well feel like he used a person and ended up taking <br/>
too much credit himself.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking in terms of music, which I know better, a musical group (say ro<br/>
ck&#39;n&#39;roll band) is a team, but if one guy also wrote all the songs and did <br/>
the arranging, that HAS to be acknowledged by the others in some way <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more than courtesy, it&#39;s integrity and humility.<br/>
<br/>
If a child refuses an award out of humility, at another level he might be <br/>
robbing the coach of HIS chance to say &quot;We didn&#39;t win because of my coaching, <br/>
we won because THIS kid is so inspiring to the others, and they worked harder <br/>
because HE worked so hard.&quot;<br/>

coach is Dad, who hates singling out kids for awards and won&#39;t do it unless<br/>
he absolutely has to.  Rod had no idea that Lars was going to get the award.<br/>
