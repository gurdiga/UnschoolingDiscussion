In the name of having a good time and amusing and horrifying our teenaged <br/>
son, my partner and I have begun singing the song everytime we come across any <br/>
chimp, monkey, gorilla, etc. Happens a lot. We also put a postcard with a chimp <br/>
in a Harvard tee shirt in Julian&#39;s stocking this Christmas.<br/>
