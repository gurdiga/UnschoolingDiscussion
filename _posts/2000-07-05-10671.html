&lt;&lt; They also collect Playmobils - I have 5 folding card tables set up in the <br/>
&quot;project&quot; room (garage) and they keep their &quot;Playmobil City&quot; there (up off <br/>
the floor). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful idea... I&#39;m going to steal this... Target recently had a 75% <br/>
sale on Playmobile stuff and Zak ended up with Castles and Police Stations <br/>
and Campers etc and I had no idea where to put them all.  So what we have to <br/>
leave the cars out in over 100 degree weather.. I&#39;ve also been thinking of <br/>
screening in my patio, putting that fake grass out there and putting the <br/>
Playmobiles out there... Now there&#39;s another option.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But alas, with 4 sets of grandparents, and 9 sets of aunts and uncles, my <br/>
kids STILL have too much stuff!<br/>

sales.  Maybe he should hold one of his own!  :)  ~Karen</div>
