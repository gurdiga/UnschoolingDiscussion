<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792719666">I haven&#39;t posted before.  I&#39;ve been busy deschooling myself.  I have <br/>
an 8 mo (Zack) old and a 3 yr old (Alex). <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Alex became a wild child.  He is a very active, sensitive <br/>
little boy.  He suddenly started hitting, throwing, yelling, <br/>
running.  He was constantly doing things that would hurt himself, his <br/>
brother, or me.  Tried keeping Zack (8 mo old) in a sling but Alex <br/>
kept trying to hit or pull on him.  I got Zack to sleep in another <br/>
room and tried to do some activities with Alex that he enjoys but he <br/>
seemed unable to focus or enjoy them.  He just kept running, hitting <br/>
things, ect.  Tried talking with him but could not get him to stay in <br/>
a room long enough to tell me anything or hear what I was saying.  <br/>
Tried taking him outside but it presented too many opportunities to <br/>
hurt himself.  He refused to have his diaper changed.  I tried making <br/>
it into a game.  He did not want to be touched (this is unusual for <br/>
him, he loves to cuddle).   He seemed really distressed but I was <br/>
unable to find a way to comfort him.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh came home and he had to hold Alex to keep him from hitting <br/>
himself, the baby, or me.  :-(  I thought that he might be having a <br/>
reaction to some things he had eaten (he&#39;s really sensitive to <br/>
certain chemicals) and tried to get Alex to take some anti-<br/>
histamine.  He refused and became more hysterical.  We finally ended <br/>
up forcing him to take the medicine.  All in all, it seemed like we <br/>
did a pretty terrible job.  Today Alex is back to his old self.  No <br/>
aggressive or frantic behaviors.  He&#39;s playing calmly, and singing to <br/>
his brother.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what others would have done.  I really need some non-<br/>
coersive alternatives in case this happens again.  Sorry for the long <br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162018424">My thoughts on the diaper situation: Why make him put it on right then? <br/>
My younger kids 12 mo and when 3yr would often run/crawl around with no <br/>
diapers on.  With the older one it was more a sign that she was ready to go <br/>
diaperless so we did.  It was only a matter of days and she was going in the potty <br/>
during the day.<br/>
<br/>
My now 12 mo old began at about 8 month to resist getting his diaper changed. <br/>
He would crawl off and did not want any part of laying down.  Since then I <br/>
let him crawl away. He may be without a diaper for an hour or if I find him <br/>
standing somewhere I just put it on. <br/>
I think over the past few months I have changed him standing 97% or the time <br/>
it&#39;s just easier on both of us.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to medicine it can be tough esp if the child knows what it is.  <br/>
I can now give the 3 yr. old say dimeatap but when she was younger I had to <br/>
put it in her cup. I never force fed it just doesn&#39;t work.  If you have a child <br/>
that requires meds more often or resists try a cup. Our DH drinks chocolate <br/>
so when we needed to she could never taste it.<br/>
But again I think it comes down to how much a child gets sick and weather <br/>
they know the drill.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539396998">&lt;&lt;I thought that he might be having a reaction to some things he had<br/>

<br/>
You may have hit the nail on the head for the cause if it was a sudden<br/>
change in behavior. The first time Jayn (@ 20 mths) got some peanut she<br/>
first started running around wildly, then came up in hives around her<br/>
mouth, then threw up. Who knew she was sensitive to it? Now if she<br/>
accidentally ingests some she first becomes very quiet and withdrawn,<br/>
goes off to a corner and then throws up after a while. The important<br/>
thing is to invite her to throw up, to make it go away quicker. <br/>
<br/>
She is also very reluctant to take any medicines on the fortunately rare<br/>
occasions she has a cold. Since they are really only for her comfort,<br/>
rather than actually therapeutic, it doesn&#39;t worry me. Sometimes if she<br/>
really has had trouble sleeping due to stuffy nose, I will sneak some<br/>
flavored cold medicine into a juice drink. The problem is that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t like the flavors they have, especially cherry. :p Seems like<br/>
this solution would not have helped you. I don&#39;t know what we would do<br/>
if it were some serious issue that needed the medicine. Probably end up<br/>
having to insist, as you did. Sometimes with ointments Jayn refuses, but<br/>
if I sit quietly and wait, without comments or cajoling, after a few<br/>
minutes she says, &quot;I&#39;m ready now&quot;. Again, I&#39;m not sure this would have<br/>
applied in your situation with the wildness. It seems like he may have<br/>
forgotten and forgiven. I think I would probably talk to him about the<br/>
need to sometimes take medicine, and also do some serious investigation<br/>
with him as to the cause - either external or internal. I&#39;d be<br/>
interested to know if you are able to track it down. BTW did the<br/>
antihistamine help or have no effect? That would be a clue.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if it occurs again and were possible, take him somewhere where he<br/>
could really run, a large park or field; perhaps he needed the physical<br/>
response to help get the &quot;contaminant&quot; out of his system.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89525097">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Time to jump in. First, I&#39;M BACK! I took a break from the boards after <br/>
my father passed away. I just needed to have as much quiet time as I <br/>
could get.<br/>
<br/>
Life in NYC is getting, let&#39;s say, more and more demanding what with <br/>
the recession we are experiencing (nobody wants to call it that, but I <br/>
will). So I took the time off to regroup. I must be feeling better <br/>
because I definitely missed you all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy I am back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now to the subject at hand.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I thought that he might be having a<br/>
&gt; reaction to some things he had eaten (he&#39;s really sensitive to<br/>
&gt; certain chemicals) and tried to get Alex to take some anti-<br/>
&gt; histamine.Â  He refused and became more hysterical.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lisa, I read your post and I have to say that it does sound like Alex <br/>
was having an allergic reaction of some sorts. That used to happen to <br/>
my Evan, who was consistently colicky until 6-8 months and <br/>
intermittently until he was about 2 years old. Even these days (he <br/>
turns 6 in August), when he is in a crabby mood and throwing tantrums <br/>
for no reason, I know it has to do more with a physical reaction than <br/>
an emotional need.<br/>
<br/>
How have I handled outbursts? He is not a hitter but he will throw <br/>
himself on the floor and in the process he has hurt himself. When he <br/>
was 3, I would just sit on the floor and hold him. By then, though, we <br/>
were on the right track, identifying all his allergies (17 markers) and <br/>
making changes to our health care options. We use homeopathy and <br/>
chiropractic medicine to deal with his allergies, eczema, asthma and <br/>
irritable bowel syndrome. We use conventional allopathic drugs when the <br/>
allergens (especially environmental ones like pollen or dust) are so <br/>
bad that nothing works.<br/>
<br/>
When he was that little, after the episode, we would &#39;review&#39; it. We <br/>
would talk about what he went through and try to find the words to <br/>
describe it. I remember being surprised by Evan&#39;s first own description <br/>
of a throat infection --he described it as having a sandshrew stuck in <br/>
his throat (for all you Pokemon fans, guess which episode that <br/>
reference comes from). Given the colic hell we lived through his first <br/>
2 years of life, I have to say that his explanation was like winning <br/>
the lottery. There is nothing more depressing than to have your baby <br/>
screaming to the top of his lungs and not knowing how to help them.<br/>
<br/>
So see if you can talk about the incident with him. It actually has <br/>
been one of the most empowering things for Evan --to be able to explain <br/>
what he is going through so that we can figure out what caused the <br/>
distress. Because once he knows the cause, then he can control the <br/>
potential reaction. He is not anymore at the mercy of unknowns <br/>
attacking his body.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332321103">From: &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dezigna@...">dezigna@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;I thought that he might be having a reaction to some things he had<br/>
eaten (he&#39;s really sensitive to certain chemicals) and tried to get Alex<br/>
to take some anti-histamine&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The behavior you describe sounds *exactly* like my son if he gets any dairy<br/>
in his system. He will get so manic, he&#39;ll throw himself against walls, run<br/>
around in circles, break down weeping and screaming, etc. It&#39;s really<br/>
frightening, both to watch as a parent and feel helpless, and for him being<br/>
inside of it and not knowing how to handle it. When it happens now, I just<br/>
take a deep breath, say to myself &quot;There&#39;s nothing he can do about this,<br/>
he&#39;s as scared and upset about this as I am&quot;, and just try and do as best as<br/>
I can to keep him from hurting himself or others. I hold him if he wants<br/>
holding, or try to give him options to help equalize the feelings he&#39;s<br/>
having (safe things to bash on, like a big plastic baseball bat he can slam<br/>
against a tree, or something similar), give him deep pressure squeezes if he<br/>
wants that (sometimes it helps him feel more organized inside). I tell<br/>
myself that this will pass, and it always does. Fortunately, now that we&#39;ve<br/>
identified the triggers, eliminated most of the allergies that cause it via<br/>
NAET (www.naet.com) and avoid the one that we haven&#39;t been able to eliminate<br/>
(dairy), this happens very infrequently.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my best suggestions are to do your best to identify and either avoid<br/>
or fix the allergic reactions that are happening for him. Once you do that,<br/>
this kind of day should be very rare and you can recognize it for what it<br/>
is. When it happens, cancel all plans, remind yourself of the things that<br/>
are important, and buckle in for the ride. Just try and help him through it.<br/>
Afterwards, you can talk to him about it and help him understand what is<br/>
happening inside him. I know my son really hates the way it feels and he<br/>
hates being out of control, so it really helps him if I just remind him that<br/>
it is not his &quot;fault&quot; and that it will pass, it *will* be over. He knows<br/>
that I&#39;m on his side and not blaming him or trying to make him feel bad for<br/>
anything. Mostly, like I said, I just have to make sure he doesn&#39;t hurt<br/>
himself or others (once, he almost managed to break through a window with<br/>
his body, he slammed into it so hard &lt;shudder&gt; ).<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re concerned about how to approach this respectfully, just think<br/>
about how you&#39;d want to be treated if you had some kind of fit and a friend<br/>
was present. How could they best help you? It *is* hard to go through this.<br/>
Make sure you are not around unsupportive people in this kind of time,<br/>
because you sure don&#39;t need the extra stress of dealing with that, and<br/>
neither does the child.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really behind in responding to posts, but have you heard of the Feingold <br/>
plan?  There&#39;s an article in this issue of Mothering and you can go to <br/>
www.feingold.org to get more info.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 4 year old, asthmatic, many allergies, very chemically sensitive.  <br/>
We&#39;ve been doing the plan for about a month and the change in my boy is <br/>
amazing!  The basic plan is to eliminate all artifical colors, flavors and <br/>
preservatives and, for the first four weeks, all natural salycalites  (apples, grapes, <br/>
oranges, etc.).  It&#39;s hard at first and feels just so restrictive that it <br/>
drives you crazy.  But knowing that diet can help my son to feel better is worth <br/>
it.  He used to have major meltdowns daily that lasted for an hour or two.  Now, <br/>
he still gets upset - what 4 year old doesn&#39;t - but he can work through it <br/>
and get over it.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he had some Wendy&#39;s chicken nuggets and french fries after a <br/>
brownie and frozen waffle.  He felt like he was crawling out of his skin all day.  <br/>
&quot;Too many chemicals, Mommy.&quot;  I think of the past month as a detox and now we <br/>
will be more careful what he eats.  He&#39;s been very involved in the whole <br/>
process and likes being the way he is now.<br/>
<br/>
This may be way off the mark for your situation, but I thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
