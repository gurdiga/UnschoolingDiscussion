<div id="ygrps-yiv-633514619">After my last post there may be those on this list that<br/>
doubt my ability to teach algebra to my &quot;so inclined&quot;<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
An amazing thing happened to me as an adult.  I learned<br/>
algebra from a wacky lady on PBS, our local channel.<br/>
I tuned in for several weeks, nightly, and now I &#39;GET&#39;<br/>
algebra...age 37 and still learning!  Do I need it?<br/>
No.  Do I want to learn it? Yes!  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;And that has made all the difference in the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I want this for my kid&#39;s!  I want them to want to know<br/>
whatever it is that make&#39;s a difference in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Weird to my folk&#39;s, but even Mom is asking question&#39;s.<br/>
Miracle&#39;s never cease!<br/>

&quot;There are two ways to live your life.   <br/>
One is as though nothing is a miracle.  <br/>
The other is as though everything is a <br/>
miracle.&quot; -Albert Einstein.</div>
