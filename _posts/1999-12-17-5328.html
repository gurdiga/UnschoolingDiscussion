<div id="ygrps-yiv-311528630">&quot;All we are saying is give peace a chance&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;War is over if you want it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You say you&#39;ll change the constitution, well you know<br/>
We all want to change your head<br/>
You tell me it&#39;s the institution, well you know<br/>
You better free your mind instead&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People say we got it made<br/>
Don&#39;t they know we&#39;re so afraid<br/>
Isolation<br/>
We&#39;re afraid to be alone<br/>
Everybody got to have a home<br/>
Isolation<br/>
Just a boy and a little girl<br/>
Trying to change the whole wide world<br/>
Isolation<br/>
The world is just a little town<br/>
Everybody trying to put us down<br/>
Isolation<br/>
I don&#39;t expect you to understand<br/>
After you caused so much pain<br/>
But then again you&#39;re not to blame<br/>
You&#39;re just a human, a victim of the insane<br/>
We&#39;re afraid of everyone<br/>
Afraid of the sun<br/>
Isolation<br/>
The sun will never disappear<br/>
But the world may not have many years<br/>
Isolation&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Love is real, real is love<br/>
Love is feeling, feeling love<br/>
Love is wanting to be loved<br/>
<br/>
Love is touch, touch is love<br/>
Love is reaching, reaching love<br/>
Love is asking to be loved<br/>
<br/>
Love is you<br/>
You and me<br/>
Love is knowing<br/>
We can be<br/>
<br/>
Love is free, free is love<br/>
Love is living, living love<br/>
Love is needing to be loved&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
