You are so right about wasting months or even years.  I was so reluctant to totally let go of all that schooly stuff that I&#39;m sure we wasted 2 years of quality living and learning, maybe more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, now my brain is all in a whirl, because if everything is <br/>
learning, how can any thing be a waste of time? Even if time is spent <br/>
learning to &quot;let go of schooly stuff&quot; that&#39;s still something <br/>
important that had to be learned, right? Even the time spent in <br/>
school was time spent learning that school wasn&#39;t the right place for <br/>
the kids. If unschooling is life, then just like the rest of life, <br/>
some people are going to take different paths, right? <br/>
<br/>
I think this is called metacognition, what we&#39;re doing here, isn&#39;t <br/>
it? Thinking about thinking? Argh! I think my mind just exploded! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50485248">This is from the unschooling.com FAQ list<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can unschooling be structured?<br/>
It depends on what you mean by structure. Imposing<br/>
external structure onto the learner, by specifying<br/>
materials and methods, is not unschooling. A person<br/>
creating structure to suit his or her own purpose,<br/>
that is unschooling. Some people are by nature<br/>
methodical, and we want our children to respect and<br/>
work with their own internal rhythms. Our job as<br/>
parent is to help them create what they need. For<br/>
example, it is entirely possible that one child will<br/>
learn everything in a more relaxed, free flowing way,<br/>
except for one sucject- perhaps history. With history<br/>
that child may want a time line and a access to<br/>
materials in chronological order. If it works for the<br/>
child and is created at the behest of the child, then<br/>
structured, methodical learning is also unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still trying to put my exploded brain back together, <br/>
Juli<br/>

<br/>
If you expand all that out, then staying in school for 16 years isn&#39;t a waste <br/>
of time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to go from Albuquerque to Denver, don&#39;t drive south.<br/>
If you want to go from school to unschooling, don&#39;t use a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;if everything is learning, how can any thing be a waste of time?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Everything is learning once the participants stop trying to force learning to <br/>
grow in certain times, places and ways.  When there is a &quot;this will be <br/>
educational&quot; edge to life, some things are educational (by the parents&#39; <br/>
definition) and some are NOT.  Until you get over that, unschooling cannot <br/>
flourish.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If unschooling is life, then just like the rest of life, <br/>
some people are going to take different paths, right? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the path they take is a private boarding school in Switzerland, they need <br/>
to stop even THINKING about unschooling, and how close to it they are.  If <br/>
you enroll your children in a swiss boarding school, they need to be there as <br/>
much as possible or you&#39;re wasting your money.  If you decide to unschool, <br/>
don&#39;t have your child miss the first few months of home-boarding-unschool <br/>
doing something else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603945208">Ok, thanks, Sandra, your responses helped clarify<br/>
things for me. I&#39;ve thought about the list thing, and<br/>
talked to the kids. Erik says great, no problem.<br/>
Aubrey says, &quot;Can I ask for a list sometimes when I<br/>
want one?&quot; I said yes. When she asks, the list will<br/>
say, &quot;1. Choice. 2. Choice.&quot; etc. I&#39;ll see how she<br/>
reacts to that. <br/>
<br/>
This is kind of like weaning.... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-806488029">We ordered our&#39;s through Delta Education, Hands On Science.  The description<br/>
reads:  &quot;Hydroponics Mini Kit:  Grow plants without soil in this mini kit&#39;s<br/>
easy-to-follow steps.  Explore and measure variables that affect the success<br/>
or failure of plant growth including water, polycrystals and the use of<br/>
nutrients.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It shows a little plastic box (looks kinda like a shoe box) with a some<br/>
beaker like little jars, support sticks, measuring tools, seeds, &quot;nutrients&quot;<br/>
and a booklet.<br/>
