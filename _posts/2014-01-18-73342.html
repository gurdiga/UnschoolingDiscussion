<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711692582">Marta Pires has been my assistant for many months, helping me organize and remember things I want to do on my site, and to help me announce chats.  She&#39;s been saving and editing recent unschooling chats.<br/>
<br/>
In a project to gather them all up that she&#39;s gently reminding me to finish, I&#39;ve just come to one from 1995, from the AOL forum.   It&#39;s not ready to share yet, but is about &quot;detox,&quot; recovering from school.  <br/>
<br/>
I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t care if people disagree with me. I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to agree with me blindly, nor disagree blindly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s still true. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Right now there are chat transcripts saved raw (not to share before they&#39;re edited, some have been edited and available for a long time, but not all easy to find, some are listed in one place or another.  Some people really enjoy chats better than &quot;composed&quot; pages.  i personally like the favorite quotes kinds of pages.  Some people prefer long essays.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where some of the chats are linked, though, for people who are interested, and that first one has links to get to notifications of newer chats.  I think there are about twice this many edited and might be available at some point.<br/>

and here&#39;s the construction site for getting them all organized in one place.  Might never happen, but some will get there.<br/>
