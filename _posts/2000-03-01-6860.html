 </span></blockquote>yea i think about that too - sounding paranoid.  i&#39;m not honest:)  i just think<br/>
it takes a bit of conscious effort to not blindly (or out guilt and<br/>
manipulation) &#39;follow the pack&#39;.  though some days it crosses my mind that<br/>
perhaps it might just be easier &#39;to follow the beaten path&#39; but then i come back<br/>
to my senses &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i find that rene&#39; is much happier and more fulfilled because i will love him no<br/>
matter what &#39;dastardly deed&#39; he may have just performed:)  and that&#39;s the real<br/>
experience they need at these early stages - unconditional love and acceptance<br/>
while learning to co-exist with other (e.g. i love you but stop jumping on my<br/>
head &lt;g&gt;  this is not generally how other would react and understandable so:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>thank you for asking.  actually i&#39;m doing surprisingly well (even though my<br/>
mother had her lawyer call me 2 days after - she knew about the miscarriage,<br/>
she&#39;s just an opportunist at heart &lt;g&gt;.  i&#39;m just happy we live 1700 miles<br/>
away)<br/>
<br/>
i went to see an acupuncturist who is really wonderful.  she is very positive<br/>
and is close friends with my midwife so when we all agree - hopefully in a few<br/>
months - we&#39;ll try again.  also, rene&#39; has now reduce the number of his request<br/>
for sibling from 3 sets of twins, lol, (2 girls, 2 boys and 1 girl & 1 boy) to<br/>
just one (1 girl & 1 boy).  he&#39;s a funny kid.<br/>

&lt;&lt; i think this whole concern with/pressure to socialize kids at younger<br/>
 and younger ages, is society&#39;s way of rationalizing &#39;our&#39; new social<br/>
 trend to institutionalize our kids (and ultimately our society) &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I could not agree with you both more.  I have my little ones at home and they are doing just great.  I think it is so vitally important for them to form those bonds and relationships at home well and strongly before they are thrust out into the larger culture to fend for themselves in social situaitons.<br/>

I agreee with you all about this and have no intention of putting my 16mo in <br/>
Mommy&#39;s-day-out as people keep insisting I should. I will take her to mom and <br/>
me in the park, but that&#39;s for me to meet moms, not for her to meet toddlers. <br/>
Having said that, am I the only one who is sometimes overwhelmed by the <br/>
strength of that bond? I rarely get a break, not even a shower by myself, <br/>
unless she&#39;s sleeping. She will not stay with her dad and let me walk out of <br/>
the room, although they&#39;re fine together if I can sneak out without letting <br/>
her see me go. If she sees me leaving for a run,a shower, a nap or whatever <br/>
she totally loses it. She has always been this way so it&#39;s not a separation <br/>
anxiety phase. I really appreciate the chance to be home with her, because I <br/>
couldn&#39;t with my older daughter when she was this age, but I would <br/>
occasionally like to leave her with her dad and not have to sneak out of my <br/>
own house. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>IKWYM! Bridget is almost 17 m/o and I don&#39;t get many breaks. From 4-9<br/>
months (when she started crawling) she absolutely would not go to anyone<br/>
else. So I just went with it :-) Grin and bear it, lol! She has become<br/>
much more independent, but is still very much a mama&#39;s girl. If I leave<br/>
her with someone I have to sneak away. If she does not see me go she&#39;s<br/>
fine, but if she sees me leave she gets very upset and I cannot leave<br/>
her. Well, ok, I guess I could leave her. I mean to say I will not leave<br/>
her when she is upset. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I only take showers on weekends now when her dada plays with<br/>
her. During the week I lean over the tub and wash my hair. Yes, I&#39;m<br/>
stinky, lol! But she does not like for me to shower. I think it scares<br/>
her. <br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying this thread since I was feeling guilty about not bringing<br/>
her to play groups. I&#39;m not a very social person myself, and we sleep in<br/>
late so we tend to miss a lot of morning stuff. However, after last<br/>
week, when another toddler attacked her in a store and an older child<br/>
hit her, I am not inclined to go out of my way to find children for her<br/>
to visit. She&#39;s getting plenty of socialization running daily errands<br/>
with me and seeing family. <br/>

NO, NO, and NO!!!  I felt that way with both of my boys and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll <br/>
feel that way with my Josephine too.  I think it&#39;s a good sign.  They are so <br/>
deeply bonded that to them it feels like losing a limb when we go away.  It&#39;s <br/>
hard for us but just think how utterly secure these children will feel when <br/>
they are a bit older.  My 8 year old has only recently let me out of his firm <br/>
grasp.  He loosened up last year when we took him out of school and he had <br/>
the chance to be around me all the time - coincidence?  I think not.  My five <br/>
year old still hovers more than I would really like, but I know he needs me <br/>
and it&#39;s for such a short time.  I do put my foot down on Saturday mornings.  <br/>
They have &quot;guy time&quot; with dad.  I go to the bakery with a good book, then I <br/>
run all my errands, and usually end up at the library.  Aaaaahhhh...  There <br/>
are definitely times during the week when I begin to feel desperate for a <br/>
little space.  That&#39;s why I LOVE my computer!<br/>
