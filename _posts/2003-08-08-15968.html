<div id="ygrps-yiv-760104321">Columbia. I grew up here--and keep trying to leave again! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we do have a wonderful zoo---Riverbanks Zoo and Botanical Gardens. Some <br/>
popular exhibits are the gorillas (one female has an injured finger permanently <br/>
stuck shooting the bird! &lt;G&gt;), the koalas, the elephants, and the lorikeets <br/>
(you can feed them nectar in a cup for a dollar. There&#39;s also a lovely <br/>
carousel!<br/>
They have Homeschools Mondays!     <br/>

The botanical gardens are just gorgeous---and a nice walk.<br/>
<br/>
The State Museum has a King Tut exhibit that has been held over until <br/>
January. It also has a hands-on science center, a SC history walkthrough, a dinosaur <br/>
exhibit, a toddler/young child room and more. Closed Mondays, but open Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
The Art museum on Main Street has a waiting room painted by Christian Thee, <br/>
one of outr presenters. Trompe l&#39;oiel. Again, I think, closed on Mondays.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a tiny firefighter&#39;s museum---it&#39;s not big, but they&#39;ve packed a lot <br/>
into it. Sandra actually told ME about it last year before she came. Duncan <br/>
and I had a good time there! Old fire engine and photos and equipment! Attatched <br/>
to the firehouse! Fun!<br/>
<br/>
The state house is a nice place to walk and hang out---just down the street <br/>
from the hotel. Anne and her boys and Marty spent several hours there late one <br/>
night! &lt;G&gt; There are stars in the walls where Sherman&#39;s cannonballs hit it! <br/>
Cool! If you take peanuts or popcorn or bread, the squirrels will eat out of <br/>
your hand. <br/>
<br/>
Across the street is Trinity Cathedral (episcopal) where Ben and I were <br/>
married. There are neat gravestones there.<br/>
<br/>
We have MANY old houses on tour. Just drive around or google  &quot;historic <br/>
houses Columbia, SC&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that if you google Columbia more places will pop up. These are just <br/>
the ones that pop into MY head!<br/>
<br/>
Charleston is a romantic southern city. DO try to get there if you&#39;re coming <br/>
from afar! It&#39;s worth the two hour drive from Columbia! <br/>
<br/>
Walk along the Battery---lovely little tree-lined park on the waterfront in <br/>
downtown Charleston, complete with old cannons to climb! <br/>
<br/>
The Slave Market---where slaves were bought and sold. It is now a touristy <br/>
spot where they sell all kinds of stuff---but the neatest thing they sell is the <br/>
sweetgrass baskets. All sorts of baskets and things woven out of sweetgrass <br/>
(found only on the coast of SC), made by the daughters of daughters of <br/>
daughters of slaves. They are quite expensive---and beautiful. Every bride receives at <br/>
least one sweetgrass basket as a wedding present! &lt;G&gt; The Salve Market <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be missed. Like I said, it&#39;s become touristy, but if you stand back, close <br/>
your eyes, and breathe deeply, you can imagine what it was like 150 year <br/>
ago!---ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
Take a carriage ride---the horses wear diapers, but it&#39;s a nice way to see <br/>
the old city, cobblestone streets and all.<br/>
<br/>
Next to the Market are a lot of good restaurants. A.W. Shucks is good and <br/>
casual for seafood. Garibaldi&#39;s a good for italian, but pricey. Poogan&#39;s Porch is <br/>
&quot;southern&quot;. Baker&#39;s Dozen, for breakfast & pastries. Charleston is THE place <br/>
for food!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an aquarium, and you can see dolphins naturally in the bay on the <br/>
water side of the aquarium. They also have an I-Max theatre.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Pirate museum. I haven&#39;t been since 1973! Sorry. I don&#39;t remember <br/>
much!<br/>
<br/>
Charlestowne Landing was built when I was leaving Charlestom in 1970. I&#39;ve <br/>
never been, but it&#39;s supposedly a nice glimpse into SC history.<br/>
<br/>
The Citadel, the military college of SC, is a lovely &quot;drive-through&quot;. VERY <br/>
historic, and ummmm---controversial! &lt;G&gt; Ben&#39;s alma mater. Beautiful buildings, <br/>
if you can look past the bars on the windows!.<br/>
<br/>
Rainbow Row is a row of VERY colorful houses---painted pinks and blues and <br/>
yellows and very famous.<br/>
<br/>
Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie are cool. Moultrie is a just drive to the <br/>
beach. Sumter is a boat ride (take bread---you can fed the seagulls that follow the <br/>
boat---and dolphins follow it too!)----it&#39;s where the first shots were fired.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an aircraft carrier that you can board--the Yorktown. I went YEARS <br/>
ago---I don&#39;t remember all that much except how incredibly HUGE it is! and that <br/>
they have a giant mixing bowl with a recipe for chocolate chip cookies for a <br/>
million! &lt;G&gt; 20 dozen eggs, 25 lbs of butter, 60 bags of flour---I thought that <br/>
was NEAT! You can also see where they sleep and eat and everything. A cool <br/>
stop!<br/>
<br/>
Beaches: Folly Beach is quirky and bohemian---a lot of &quot;alternatives&quot; down <br/>
there (it&#39;s our favorite---and we&#39;re going for the day tomorrow). Isle of Palms, <br/>
Sullivan&#39;s Island, & Edisto Beach are the most beautiful---and ritzy. There <br/>
is camping at several state parks (eewre FULL of state parks!). I think you can <br/>
buy a membership for very little and camp all over. Google &quot;SC state Parks&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Charleston&#39;s one drawback, for me, is the damned one-way streets! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Along the coast, heading north are MANY beaches. Litchfield is north as you <br/>
approach Myrtle Beach and Pawley&#39;s Island&#39;s &quot;logo&quot; says &quot;elegantly shabby&quot;! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
---lots of golf along the coast for those into spoiling a good walk!  <br/>
<br/>
Brookgreen Gardens is a must see. Its has the most beautiful sculptures done <br/>
by the owner of the property many years ago. Her history and the history of <br/>
the property is there. Nice shop too. The horses at the entrance are worth the <br/>
whole visit for me! &lt;g&gt; And there&#39;s usually an art exhibit available, I <br/>
believe. Lovely gardens, to boot!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Myrtle Beach. Well, no self-respecting South Carolinian would be caught dead <br/>
there---it&#39;s a tourist trap, and you&#39;re welcome to it! &lt;G&gt;. The beaches aren&#39;t <br/>
very pretty, but they have the pavillion--rides and such. Lots of stores and <br/>
shows. You can STAY busy there! They have an excellent aquarium, so I <br/>
hear---better than Charleston&#39;s and I really liked Charleston&#39;s! <br/>
<br/>
Another little town that might be of interest: Camden is a small and <br/>
beautiful town about 40 minutes northeast of Columbia, Their slogan: &quot;Come spend a few <br/>
peaceful hours where the British spent a rough year!&quot; Just for you, Shyrley! &lt;<br/>
G&gt; It&#39;s where Lord Cornwallis and &quot;Bloody&quot; Bannistre Tarleton, a ruthless <br/>
Brit, struggled to keep the colonies. They were defeated by the Swampfox, Francis <br/>
Marion (all very loosely portrayed in the Mel Gibson movie, The Patriot).  It <br/>
was also the winter home of a bunch of yankees for many years---and they <br/>
still come down and winter their racing thoroughbreds here.( I used to exercise <br/>
racehorses there for Frank Whitely! 50 lbs ago! &lt;G&gt;). It&#39;s a nice place to spend <br/>
a day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure other locals can chime in on what not to miss. And if you have any <br/>
particular questions, I&#39;ll try to find the answers for you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so excited you&#39;re all coming!<br/>
<br/>
