<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227943079">I loved this movie!  I didn&#39;t catch, until about 20-30 mins. into it, <br/>
that it was &quot;A Knight&#39;s Tale&quot;!!  DUH!  Even when they picked up <br/>
Chaucer.  It wasn&#39;t until they met the summoner and the pardoner that <br/>
i smacked my head and said to DH, &quot;OOHH!!  A KNIGHT&#39;s Tale....  as in <br/>
Canterbury!!&quot;  ROFL.  I just thought it was a story about a knight, <br/>
like Dragonheart of one of those...<br/>
<br/>
I can be so SLOW...  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s off topic... so i&#39;ll just add that i really enjoy your <br/>
conversations regarding unschooling.  Even if i don&#39;t decide to do <br/>
that with my son, it will greatly affect how i homeschool and even <br/>
parent him.  I used to be MUCH more rigid and had high expectations <br/>
of what he should do/see/say and how he should act, etc...  I&#39;m <br/>
really learning to back off.  so, THANK YOU!!<br/>
