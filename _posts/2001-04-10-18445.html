<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712720223">The little girl across the street is only 5, is gone for hours at a time and her mother is often seen &quot;looking&quot; for her at dusk.  It&#39;s bone chilling to me., this neighborhood isn&#39;t THAT safe.<br/>

Sad but true, many children are left to wander unsupervised, play in the street, near rivers and canals, etc.  This area is terrible for that.  There was a death in the paper last winter of an 18 month old left in his pajamas in the cab of a truck all day while his father went hunting.  Another recent death involved a three year old left to play by the Snake River with a five and 6 year old in supervision.<br/>
<br/>
I do not even let my 3 and 4 year old children play in our own backyard unless they are adult supervised.  But our next door neighbor&#39;s five year old public schooled child (now age 7) was andering the neighborhood at will for hours, crossing streets etc, when she was 5.  They were always wandering around calling her at dusk, usually her older sister, since her mother could not be bothered.  She also went into neighbors homes to play that her parents did not know, played with older kids, etc.<br/>

<br/>
This is what concerns me most about children being responsible for other<br/>
children, they will carry the burden of this for the rest of their lives.<br/>
 It is difficult enough for adults to deal with the guilt of something<br/>
happening to a child in their care, children just aren&#39;t equipped to deal<br/>
with this.<br/>
<br/>
That is why I&#39;m so leery of allowing my daughter to babysit, even when<br/>
she is older.  She already takes on the cares of the world, I&#39;m afraid if<br/>
something happened to a child she is watching it would be more than she<br/>
could deal with.<br/>
