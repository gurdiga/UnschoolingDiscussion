&gt; <br/>

&gt; can paint on my front porch windows? I live directly in front of the<br/>
&gt; elementary school an thought it would be fun!<br/>
&gt; I have 10 windows that have two pains each and a all glass door!!!!<br/>
&gt; thanks for your help!<br/>
&gt; please try to make them ones that people will :&quot;get&quot;!<br/>

Whatever your message is, I suggest putting your contact information in a<br/>
prominent place. That way, if parents get the idea, they will know how to<br/>
contact you.  &quot;HOMESCHOOLING INFO:  555-1234<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation is to put ONLY THAT up --<br/>
no inflammatory signs at all.<br/>
<br/>
If you include an email address, I suggest a different one from the one<br/>
above. &quot;Bingoqueen&quot; might not be something you&#39;d want to advertise.<br/>
<br/>
Your idea will turn you into a target.<br/>
<br/>
In general, if you are trying to turn your home into the &quot;anti-school,&quot; my<br/>
own experience tells me that you will bring the wrath of the school down<br/>
upon yourself, and while we know that you are trying to help those children<br/>
escape school, the price might be high for you personally.<br/>
<br/>
If your put signs on your house that incite the teachers, you are certain to<br/>
get some very nasty phone calls from those teachers and their friends and<br/>
relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I would not put it past the teacher&#39;s union that they would send some very<br/>
bad people to your house and do things to it that you can&#39;t imagine.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to try to find one parent at a time, and do for them the same<br/>
thing that this list does....provide information and reassurance that there<br/>
is a better way for a child to grow up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280069665">It isn&#39;t about being anti school or advertising home or unschooling just some thought provoking quotes from some well known people that don&#39;t say anything bad about schools at all.<br/>
I should have known not to ask this list for anything as always  my post has been ignored  when I wanted the help and now a lecture given on why I should or should not do something, that was not what my question was it was does anyone have any great quotes. (my mistake for explaining why I wanted them!)<br/>
and as far as my email address is concerned I don&#39;t find it to be a problem if others do that is their own problem. thank you for the suggestion<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, if you&#39;re expressing to the teachers the opinions of teachers that you<br/>
do here is it surprising that they wouldn&#39;t be sending flowers?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that if you express understanding of the positive reasons why<br/>
people go into teaching in the first place that you might find there are<br/>
some, if not many, teachers who actually agree with homeschooling and even<br/>
unschooling. If you broadbrush them all with the assumption that they&#39;re all<br/>
motivated by the same things that motivate the teachers who are bitterly<br/>
taking advantage of the system that has used them up and treated them with<br/>
contempt there won&#39;t be much of a reason for them or the parents who trust<br/>
teachers to listen to you.<br/>
<br/>
We can understand how people can know they&#39;re right without agreeing that<br/>
they&#39;re right. But if we treat people with contempt and as though they were<br/>
the enemy, we&#39;ll get contempt back and they will be the enemy.<br/>
