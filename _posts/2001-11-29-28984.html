<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235394723">If I had my way, the world would be full of Summerhill Schools. Sudbury <br/>
Valley Schools. Albany Free Schools.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling would be supported with resource centers. Communitys would <br/>
offer support for those unschooling parents that are single or <br/>
impoverished.<br/>
<br/>
Public education based on a democratic model would have an amazingly <br/>
smaller amount of administrative positions and the gazillions of wasted <br/>
money would be put back into the schools and the community.<br/>
<br/>
After a generation of children that grow up in this atmosphere, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry about the earth, the planet, the takeover of individual <br/>
freedoms of corporation. It would all take care of itself.<br/>
<br/>
The world would heal. And the future would be stable.<br/>
<br/>
Humanity would be full of well adjusted, empathetic, intelligent, <br/>
spiritual beings.<br/>

I read Summerhill when I was 14.  Nothing was the same after that.<br/>
