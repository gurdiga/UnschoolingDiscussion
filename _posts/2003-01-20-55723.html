<div id="ygrps-yiv-483922725">Another thing to be done with too-salted meat is boiling it.<br/>
<br/>
I just remembered a pressed-beef recipe I made for a medieval campout, which <br/>
involved first salting the HECK out of raw beef, rolling and tying it (large <br/>
slabs) and then boiling it, then unrolling it and pressing out the liquid.  <br/>
It made something a little like the joy of leftover porkchops.  Not quite <br/>
jerkey.<br/>
<br/>
But oversalted meat could also be used to chuck into a stew or soup.<br/>
