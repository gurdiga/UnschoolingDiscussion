<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735953994">My daughter is tuning five in September. I am having problems<br/>
with her dad and his wife always talking to her about going to school.<br/>
They are telling her about all the things she will do when she starts<br/>
school and making it out to her like she is going to love it.<br/>
<br/>
  I have already told them that I haven&#39;t decided if I want to put her in<br/>
public school or not.  They are completely against the idea of not<br/>
putting her in public school.  It is really my decision I am the<br/>
custodial parent.  I am very confused at this point about what would be<br/>
best for my daughter.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326670718">I&#39;m a divorced mom, too, and unfortunately dad (your ex) does have a say in how she&#39;s educated.  If you can convince him that unschooling is fine (start with HOMEschooling and curriculum might help him see that learning at home works).<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not on board it could get ugly.  He could fight for custody over &#39;educational neglect.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lucky in that my kids&#39; dad was fully on board with unschooling prior to the divorce and still is.  It&#39;s not easy with two working parents as we just &#39;can&#39;t stay home.&#39;  The kids have done part time in a Sudbury school (if you are near one of those it might be a good alternative at first as well).  This year they are choosing not to go to Sudbury.  We will work it out.  I&#39;m fortunate in that my kids can come to work with me and there is an area they can hang, with computers, direct tv, kitchen, level yard and low traffic parking lot out back, and we can fill the space with cool stuff.  And my kids are older (almost 12 & 8 within the next month).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;m not sure if it makes a difference or not, but we were never<br/>
married. In my court papers it says I am the one to make decsions on<br/>
education. I could be reading it wrong also. It is confusing sometimes<br/>
the way they word things.</div>
