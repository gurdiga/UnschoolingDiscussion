<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223930724">We are thinking about converting this bunkbed (see photo here:) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://melonary.blogspot.com/2005/05/bedrooms.html">http://melonary.blogspot.com/2005/05/bedrooms.html</a><br/>
into a loft bed by removing one board - the long, bottom board on the frontside that supports the board that supports the bottom mattress.  We would leave the like-board on the wall side.<br/>
<br/>
The big question is whether this would be safe.  The bunkbed is made from good, solid wood and feels very sturdy, even though the top bunk is only &quot;attached&quot; to the bottom by one thin dowel in each of the four corner posts.<br/>
<br/>
Would it still be sturdy enough?  The picture shows the footboards.  The headboards are in the same arrangement.  What do you think?  Any other ideas?<br/>

<br/>
My thought is that the reason the thin dowels in the corner posts are<br/>
sufficient is because the lengthways cross beam of the lower bed prevents<br/>
motion or torqueing in the vertical supports. My suggestion (I was a set<br/>
builder rather than a home furnishings carpenter) would be to add solid<br/>
floor to base (of the top bed) supports to the inside of the current legs<br/>
(ie reinforcing the join and taking some of the weight) - 2 x 4&#39;s. Possibly<br/>
to look at additionally fixing of the top bed to the wall (find the studs!)<br/>
to help take some of the weight and minimize movement. I would keep the<br/>
ladder like arrangement of the head/foot boards rather than risk free<br/>
standing legs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716770007">We did this a while back with wood bunkbeds.  Our main reason was that the bottom mattress was up too close to the top bunk that once the kids got bigger it didn&#39;t work so well.  So, Noelle wanted her mattress/boxspring on the floor.  So we did this, leaving the back railing and discarding the one in the front.  We didn&#39;t have any problems, but you&#39;re the best judge...if it seems wobbly don&#39;t do it....or maybe you can secure the frame to the studs in the wall to ensure safety?<br/>
