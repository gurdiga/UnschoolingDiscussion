<div id="ygrps-yiv-166397621"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;. I have never been<br/>
&gt;&gt;able/willing to take meds. The few times when it could not be avoided I<br/>
&gt;&gt;always washed them down with something sweet. Usually a milkshake. Now my<br/>
&gt;&gt;kids are the same way so they pick their favorite thing and I stock up on<br/>
&gt;&gt;it until their done having to take meds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cathy, you&#39;d love the stuff they give my son when he has a bad cold..For<br/>
some reason, many medicines in Japan are given in powder form, so for a<br/>
small child it has to be mixed with something and one of the things on the<br/>
list is ice cream. As you can imagine, I NEVER have trouble getting my son<br/>
to take that medicine! In fact, after breakfast today he reminded me that<br/>
I&#39;d forgotten to give it to him, LOL..<br/>
