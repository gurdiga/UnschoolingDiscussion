<div id="ygrps-yiv-567235668">&lt;Bad analogy. ;-) Marriages for love are not very successful<br/>
and that&#39;s quaitified by the devorice rate.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t say this is true either.  Have they ever done a study on how <br/>
many of those that divorced married for love, money, or prestige?  <br/>
Maybe the ones that are divorcing aren&#39;t marrying for love, at least <br/>
not unconditional love?<br/>
