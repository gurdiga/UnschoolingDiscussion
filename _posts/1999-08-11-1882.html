Expanding School-Based Health Clinics: A Bad Idea<br/>
<br/>
by Karen Holgate, President, PNN<br/>
<br/>
It wasn�t that long ago that opponents fought against establishing health<br/>
clinics on school campuses. These opponents argued that once clinics were<br/>
established, clinic supporters would not be content with offering limited<br/>
services to the poor.<br/>
<br/>
They argued that like all government entities clinics would seek to expand<br/>
services and encourage greater dependence on the services offered.<br/>
<br/>
Those early opponents were right. Many states, and now some members of<br/>
Congress, believe school-based health clinics should offer not only<br/>
&quot;comprehensive&quot; primary health care, but also include a full range of mental<br/>
health services.<br/>
<br/>
In California, AB 1363 (Davis, D-SD), is making its way through the<br/>
legislature. This bill seeks to drastically alter and expand the scope of<br/>
services offered by school health centers. The original version of this bill<br/>
&quot;required&quot; school boards to provide &quot;school-based health centers as<br/>
traditional and safety net providers.&quot; The amended version altered this<br/>
mandate by saying:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This bill would �authorize� the board to include school-based health<br/>
centers<br/>
as traditional and safety net providers that �meet certain requirements.�&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Reality: schools that now have centers will be greatly expanding services;<br/>
those that don�t have clinics will be implementing them. If some school<br/>
boards try to hold-out, you can be sure they will be pressured into<br/>
implementing these full-service clinics.)<br/>
<br/>
AB 1363 will include comprehensive primary medical and mental health,<br/>
including:<br/>
<br/>
Prescribing and dispensing &quot;prescriptions&quot; (drugs)<br/>
<br/>
Counseling�individual, group and family<br/>
<br/>
Examinations<br/>
<br/>
Mental health assessment<br/>
<br/>
Reproductive services that will include:<br/>
<br/>
pelvic exams<br/>
<br/>
information on sex<br/>
<br/>
diagnosis and treatment<br/>
<br/>
prescribing, dispensing and referrals for birth control, &quot;including condoms&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Substance abuse treatment<br/>
<br/>
Weight control<br/>
<br/>
Acne<br/>
<br/>
You name it; the proposed new clinics will cover it.<br/>
<br/>
Davis� bill continues by saying that these clinics must be &quot;easily<br/>
accessible&quot; and must be open during classroom hours as well as limited<br/>
before<br/>
and after school hours. It says that local providers will decide their own<br/>
&quot;parental consent policy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As a parent, does that give you a warm and fuzzy feeling that you will have<br/>
control over your child�s health? Do you feel confident that your school<br/>
will<br/>
protect your rights? Do you believe your child�s school should be allowed to<br/>
determine the extent of your participation in, and &quot;parental consent&quot; of,<br/>
your own child�s basic health needs? AB 1363 mandates that clinics &quot;shall&quot;<br/>
be<br/>
&quot;user-friendly&quot; (for students), &quot;private,&quot; and &quot;confidential&quot; and should<br/>
involve parents as is &quot;age appropriate&quot; for the student AND only with the<br/>
student�s consent.<br/>
<br/>
(Do you still feel in control?)<br/>
<br/>
AB 1363 continues by saying that the clinics are to &quot;encourage&quot; students to<br/>
use them. It makes it clear that the clinics will recognize the rights of<br/>
the<br/>
child (not the parents). Children will be able to participate in the<br/>
&quot;decisionmaking&quot; process for their own health care (not parents). The bill<br/>
repeatedly reiterates the students� need for privacy; it then states that<br/>
students &quot;shall be&quot; provided with a written statement about the hours and<br/>
services offered by the clinic. (not parents). Of course the bill mandates<br/>
that extensive data will be collected on each child. This &quot;consistent and<br/>
complete&quot; data is to include, but not be limited to:<br/>
<br/>
name and ID number,<br/>
<br/>
personal and biographical information,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;all significant illness and medical conditions �shall� be on a problem<br/>
list,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;�use of cigarette, alcohol, illegal substances, or other high-risk<br/>
behaviors<br/>
�as determined by each school health center,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
�history and physical examination records shall document �appropriate<br/>
SUBJECTIVE and objective information,&quot; etc., etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, students�not parents�are given the right to approve or<br/>
disapprove of the release of their records.<br/>
<br/>
This is not just a California phenomenon. In Minnesota, Dr. Karen Effrem,<br/>
MD,<br/>
says that school-based clinics allow mental health screening, tracking, and<br/>
referrals without parental knowledge or consent. She says that parents<br/>
and/or<br/>
the parents� insurance is often billed for these services�again without<br/>
parental permission or even review of records.  Dr. Effrem points out that<br/>
the guidelines for diagnosing mental health are extremely broad and vague.<br/>
<br/>
This mounting absurdity is not just occurring within individual states;<br/>
Congress has entered into the debate. Some members now believe that using<br/>
school-based health centers to treat &quot;depression&quot; in children will help<br/>
reduce the chances of another Littleton disaster.[1]  Before engaging in<br/>
feel<br/>
good &quot;knee-jerk&quot; reactions to the Littleton tragedy; or before authorizing<br/>
massive expansion of school-based mental health services, issues of privacy,<br/>
confidentiality, parental rights, funding, and the proper role of government<br/>
(and public schools) in the lives of citizens must be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
Psychological evaluations are already being conducted on children in<br/>
classrooms across America�often without parental notification or permission.<br/>
Teachers often administer surveys that ask children whether their parents<br/>
treat &quot;other children&quot; in the family better than they treat them, whether<br/>
their parents are headed for a divorce, about their personal use of alcohol,<br/>
drugs or other substances, about their thoughts, feelings and attitudes,<br/>
about how they feel about mom and dad, etc. Most of these surveys are given<br/>
without parent notification or permission.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes teachers (not trained psychologists) are asked to evaluate<br/>
students. A  survey given to third grade teachers in Ohio [2] asks teachers<br/>
to subjectively measure and record students� behaviors. Some of these<br/>
questions ask the teacher to judge whether the student<br/>
<br/>
1) &quot;appropriately questions rules that may be fair,<br/>
<br/>
2) appropriately tells you when he or she thinks you have treated him or her<br/>
unfairly,<br/>
<br/>
3) gets along with people who are different,<br/>
<br/>
4) fidgets or moves excessively, disturbs ongoing activities,<br/>
<br/>
5) has low self-esteem,<br/>
<br/>
6) appears lonely,<br/>
<br/>
7) gives compliments to peers�&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Notice the subjective nature of the questions. Who determines what is<br/>
&quot;appropriate&quot;? What does it mean to &quot;fidget or move excessively&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
(We�re talking 3rd graders!)<br/>
<br/>
If your child doesn�t give enough compliments to his/her peers, does that<br/>
mean your child is not normal? In this particular survey teachers are<br/>
actually instructed that if they don�t observe one of the behaviors listed<br/>
they are to &quot;estimate&quot; what they think the child would do.<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine the scope of subjective evaluations of your child�s &quot;mental<br/>
health&quot; if school-based health clinics decide they can and should start<br/>
screening every child for potential &quot;mental health&quot; problems? The<br/>
opportunity<br/>
for wide-scale abuse is staggering. Parents are already complaining about<br/>
the<br/>
abuse of current school practices. For example:<br/>
<br/>
Twelve 3rd graders were sent to the school psychologist. After being asked<br/>
numerous personal questions about their families, the children were told not<br/>
to talk to anyone outside the classroom about the &quot;counseling group.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Parents who gave permission for an educational aptitude test for their 4th<br/>
grade twin daughters were shocked when the girls told them they were grilled<br/>
about possible sexual abuse and whether their parents yelled.<br/>
<br/>
A single mom learned her 7th grade son had been seeing a school psychologist<br/>
for six weeks. The school labeled him at-risk because she was divorced. In<br/>
the note, her son told her he hadn�t realized he was such a &quot;burden&quot; until<br/>
the counselor told him. She found him several hours later wandering the<br/>
streets in the dark�crying.<br/>
<br/>
Curriculum that teaches elementary students that &quot;any form of punishment or<br/>
permissiveness is disrespectful and discouraging to children&quot; and then asks<br/>
young children to share times when they have been punished.<br/>
<br/>
If you find it hard to believe that this can happen, consider the following:<br/>
In California, current law requires that parents be notified at the<br/>
beginning<br/>
of each year that they have the right to be told they have no rights�that<br/>
their child may be removed from campus for &quot;confidential medical services&quot;<br/>
without their consent.[3]<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the concerns over parental rights, concerns over the growing<br/>
cost to maintain these clinics should be considered. For instance, while AB<br/>
1363 is gaining legislative support, [4]  SB 468, [5]  will change current<br/>
California law and allow mental health parity insurance coverage. For<br/>
parents<br/>
of school-age children, this means that SB 468 will allow their insurance to<br/>
be used to pay for mental health services administered by the school-based<br/>
health clinics. All too often these services will be administered, and<br/>
payment made, without parental knowledge, consent or involvement.<br/>
<br/>
But the cost doesn�t stop there. Another bill, AB 920, was also introduced<br/>
this year. Designed to provide $35,000,000 in &quot;seed&quot; money to kick-off the<br/>
implementation of these centers, the bill didn�t make it out of committee<br/>
this year. However, a call to the author�s office verified that the bill<br/>
will<br/>
resurface in January, 2000.<br/>
<br/>
The cost to the taxpayer doesn�t stop at &quot;seed money&quot;. Pennsylvania State<br/>
Representative Sam Rohrer has strong words about the cost of this movement<br/>
to<br/>
install comprehensive health care into our school system. Rep. Rohrer says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is involved in the �Medicalization of the Schools�? At issue is<br/>
Medicaid. Once the government sponsored health insurance program for the<br/>
poor, Medicaid has now moved mainstream into our schools. It is paying<br/>
salaries, funding multiple programs that boldly intrude into the sanctity of<br/>
the home, and is the cause of escalating federal and state budgets. If this<br/>
weren�t objectionable enough, the Medicaid component is but one spoke on the<br/>
wheel of the larger societal restructuring movement that clearly<br/>
orchestrates<br/>
a number of large federal entitlement programs to produce what the Clinton<br/>
administration calls a �safety net�.&quot; [6]<br/>
<br/>
Rep. Rohrer is right. The burden of supporting the &quot;medicalization&quot; of<br/>
schools will fall on the taxpayer. Health care doesn�t come cheap. And at a<br/>
time when many families and older Americans can�t afford decent health care,<br/>
the government now wants to use highly questionable tactics to create a<br/>
massive bureaucracy that will violate the sanctity of the family and drain<br/>
America�s workers of personal income. Taxpayers will be paying higher taxes<br/>
and increased insurance premiums to cover the costs of a government run, and<br/>
staffed, comprehensive, full-service health care system in schools.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than enact legislation that would lower taxes and insurance premiums,<br/>
thus making it easier for America�s families, and seniors, to afford medical<br/>
care, the government�s answer is to force Americans into paying increased<br/>
taxes and premiums thus forcing more and more of them to rely on the<br/>
government to provide these services.<br/>
<br/>
This is nothing more than Hillary Clinton�s original�and failed�health plan<br/>
now being implemented in schools across the country. It is the fulfillment<br/>
of<br/>
the &quot;village school&quot; concept.<br/>
<br/>
What is a &quot;village school?&quot; In 1996, Pomona, California established an<br/>
&quot;Education Village at Plaza Azteca.&quot; This new &quot;village school&quot; includes &quot;a<br/>
seamless flow of services from preschool to university,&quot; [7] health services<br/>
for students and their families, and a full range of services that includes<br/>
social and family support systems. &quot;Village schools&quot; allow the<br/>
centralization<br/>
of government services. They have a captive audience.<br/>
<br/>
At the opening ceremony of Pomona�s &quot;village,&quot; Superintendent Patrick Leier<br/>
said that he expected the new facility to cost $10 million. He said the<br/>
district had budgeted $5 million and anticipated an additional $4 to $5<br/>
million from the state in matching funds. This, of course, is just the<br/>
beginning. Initial costs pale in relation to ongoing operational expenses.<br/>
<br/>
Expanding school-based health clinic services to include mental health and<br/>
&quot;comprehensive primary health care&quot; for students is nothing more than a<br/>
blatant attempt to wrest control away from parents and place the<br/>
decisionmaking for their child�s health in the hands of the state run health<br/>
center. Clinic employees will decide what services are needed; whether a<br/>
child is &quot;depressed&quot; and whether a child needs a pelvic examination,<br/>
medication, etc. And remember, the parent is NOT considered a necessity in<br/>
this process.<br/>
<br/>
There are already ample procedures and agencies in place to aid children and<br/>
parents�whether the problem be mental or physical.  Expanding school-based<br/>
health centers and their services  are totally unnecessary. The cost is<br/>
prohibitive and the potential for abuse far outweighs any imagined benefits.<br/>
Increasing government intrusion into the private lives of families is<br/>
something that should be taken very seriously.<br/>
