<div id="ygrps-yiv-506392238">I&#39;ve heard the Scholastic Warehouse sales are wonderful places to get<br/>
awesome books and such dirt cheap. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I just stumbled across a page at Scholastic where you can click on your<br/>
state and get a list of when and where. It&#39;s at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://teacher.scholastic.com/fairs/warehouse/">http://teacher.scholastic.com/fairs/warehouse/</a><br/>
<br/>
You can even sign up there to have Scholastic notify you of their next sale<br/>
by email.<br/>
