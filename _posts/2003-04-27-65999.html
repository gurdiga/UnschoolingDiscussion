Ah, but Barbie must be reasonably adept at math and sciences. Her many<br/>
careers include Pediatrician, Veterinarian and Astronaut.<br/>
<br/>
In fact I am convinced that Barbie is the ultimate unschooler/life<br/>
learner. Not only has she investigated every career under the sun, she<br/>
still finds time to be involved in a wide variety of sports, the arts,<br/>
charity work AND to hang out and play with her younger sisters. Of<br/>
course her parents seem a little absent.<br/>
