<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324523057">I&#39;m really looking forward to getting a laser printer that has better <br/>
registration so I can do this type of thing. Our 12+ year old dot matrix <br/>
printer starts about 1/2 inch down, and not fully predictably, either.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m a graphic designer, this drives me batty!<br/>
