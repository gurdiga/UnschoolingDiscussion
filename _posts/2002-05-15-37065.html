<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256780906">How about blob tag? When you tag someone, you hold hands, and each <br/>
person tagged joins the blob until you have this big blob of kids trying <br/>
to tag the one or two who are left -- lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone remember the name of the book about cooperative games that <br/>
was popular in the seventies? It was great. I had a copy once, lent it <br/>
to someone....<br/>

I&#39;ve had another one from the library.  I can&#39;t remember the title, but it <br/>
was by Terry Orlick, or something close to that.<br/>
