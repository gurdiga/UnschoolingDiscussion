&gt; What kind of farm do you have?          Karen <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Karen,<br/>
<br/>
The url for the farm website is <br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm">http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm</a><br/>
 also if you are interested in getting monthly updates on the farm I <br/>
have a newsletter list with Onelist to subscribe to that go to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a> <br/>
All my newsletters are archived there and there are lots of up to <br/>
date photos from around the farm there too, with the most recent <br/>
one being a photo of a 3 day old baby goat we adopted yesterday <br/>
with his new &quot;mother&quot;, my daughter Rhianon.<br/>
<br/>
The farm is a bit like an old fashioned family farm, with a little bit of <br/>
everything.  Over the years it has been a beef cattle farm and a <br/>
dairy farm.  Now it is the local compost site... you should see the <br/>
cows gobble up the grass clippings that people bring, and the <br/>
goats and sheep eat at fresh brush.   We also get food waste from <br/>
the local hospital and university, that is composted until we have a <br/>
way to cook it so we can feed it to animals.  However we can feed <br/>
the outdated bakery, produce, dairy, and frozen goods that we get <br/>
daily from the local supermarket.   <br/>
<br/>
We bottle feed dairy steers with the outdated milk.   My daughter <br/>
milks one of the 9 female goats and feeds the milk to two female <br/>
kids and a buck kid we bought yesterday.  There are two wethers <br/>
from last year, two bucks and 8 kids.   We bought 3  10month old <br/>
angora goats last week, as we want to take up spinning... as if we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get enough fleeces from our 24 sheep and their 23 [so far] <br/>
lambs.  We have 4 beef cows, 2 bred heifers and 3 younger heifers <br/>
[the youngest is 7 days old], two bulls who will be going to market <br/>
before the little heifers are much bigger, and 12 dairy steers from a <br/>
couple of weeks to almost two years old.  We also have 1 rabbit <br/>
and one cat.  I almost forgot we have two sows, who due to their <br/>
huge appetites for doughnuts became too fat to breed, the vet isn&#39;t <br/>
sure if they will ever be capable of reproducing, but they are very <br/>
happy pigs.... we are probably buying a bred sow soon, she will not <br/>
be allowed to eat baked goods!<br/>
<br/>
There are two pairs of Canada geese, both geese are sitting on six <br/>
or seven eggs, 5 domestic geese and a young Canada goose who <br/>
thinks he&#39;s a domestic goose, 4 turkeys, six ducks [and 28 fertile <br/>
duck eggs in an incubator], and too many chickens to count   We <br/>
incubate chicks from our chicken&#39;s eggs in three incubators and <br/>
last week over 350 chicks hatched, all through summer we will <br/>
keep the incubators going, we can incubate 46 eggs a day, the <br/>
excess we sell at the local co-op and here on the farm, and most <br/>
of the roosters the Hmongs buy.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s about all the livestock.<br/>
<br/>
The farm is 175 acres, but only 55 is tillable land, the rest is <br/>
returning to the way nature had intended it to be, and there is an <br/>
abundance of wildlife.   There are two trout streams joining on the <br/>
farm, and beavers have been busy damming one of them, there are <br/>
coyotes, deer, skunks, squirrels, chipmonks, ground hogs and <br/>
many other critters living here.  There is a 600&#39; hill to climb.... a <br/>
great exercise machine, and from the top you can see the <br/>
Mississippi River.<br/>
<br/>
The kids [human ones] love it here and really enjoy helping out with <br/>
the farm tasks, they learn so much for the things the experience.<br/>
