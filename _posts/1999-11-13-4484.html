&lt;&lt;OK guys,  I&#39;m getting paniky here.  I kept the books like Family Math, I<br/>
<br/>
Hate Mathematics, and Mathematics for Smarty Pants and others laying around<br/>
<br/>
here for about a month and dd never even picked one up! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bought the Family Math book about a month ago myself, and have barely <br/>
looked at it so far.  My plan (or hope) was that my son and husband and I <br/>
would do some of the activities together in the evenings.  I know that I&#39;m <br/>
gonna have to be the person that picks the first activity to start with and <br/>
invites the others to join me.  I&#39;m pretty sure that if it looks fun, they <br/>
will want to join me, but if it looks and smells educational they are going <br/>
to turn away.<br/>
<br/>
(My son is probably younger than your daughter, which helps me keep panic at <br/>
bay.  I may get tenser as he gets older.)<br/>

&lt;&lt;Logic puzzles and games and mazes are a big hit in our house and <br/>
<br/>
they sort of get the math juices flowing even if you are not actually <br/>
<br/>
learning division or fractions or whatever.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have some dice with more than 6 sides (10 sides, 12 sides and 20 sides) <br/>
that we got from a game store.  (Also 4 sides)  We&#39;ve been substituting them <br/>
for regular dice in some of our games.  This brings in Probability.<br/>
<br/>
We play the Aristoplay Knights and Castles game, which resembles Parcheesi in <br/>
it&#39;s board layout.  It takes an awfully long time to get around the board, so <br/>
we use one of the bigger dice to speed up the game.  BUT, to start a man on <br/>
the board you must roll a 1 or a 6.  Your odds of rolling these are better <br/>
with the 6 sided die.  We start the game with that, and each player can <br/>
decide when he has enough players started that he wants to switch to using <br/>
the bigger die.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m suggesting differently sized and shaped dice for stocking stuffers for <br/>
Christmas if you don&#39;t already own some.<br/>
