<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885464759">I can&#39;t get my kids to clean up their rooms, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have much success in getting the world to follow along with my opinion ;-)  <br/>

Honestly? Again it depends on what you mean.  I would vote, protest etc. against something which I felt morally reprehensible.  However, I don&#39;t need anyone else in the world to see it my way.  (Psst, just between you and me, most of the world sees it differently than I do. Even most Orthodox Jewish, homeschooling feminists!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  I am feeling rather numb I guess.  I just came back from the funeral of a 27 man.  Who did a lot of living in his short time on earth.... It was very upsetting....<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
