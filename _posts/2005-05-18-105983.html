<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071741714">I took a crafts class last weekend and a woman that I met there (who I <br/>
think was likely over 40) mentioned that this was the first time she had <br/>
selected her own colors for making the item.  In all previous classes <br/>
she had closely copied the teacher&#39;s sample or illustration.  I&#39;m <br/>
inclined to think that at a young and impressionable age some teacher <br/>
told her emphatically that &quot;ponies are not purple&quot;.  It just seems <br/>
surprising that it took her so many years to move from careful following <br/>
of &quot;authority&quot; to striking off in her own direction. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s an unschooling moral to this story. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

How about &quot;It&#39;s never too late to deschool yourself and start following your<br/>
own heart&#39;s guidance&quot;.<br/>
