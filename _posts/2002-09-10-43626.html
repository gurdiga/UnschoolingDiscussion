&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Hang out with&quot; has been our euphemism usually.  It&#39;s funny, because other <br/>
&gt; euphemisms over the years came to be charged with sexuality (or vice versa, <br/>
&gt; that it started strong and got lighter)--like &quot;parking&quot; or &quot;making out&quot; or <br/>
&gt; whatever that one generation considered just hanging out and another saw as <br/>
&gt; total intercourse.  It would be funny if our kids someday said with shock <br/>
&gt; &quot;You&#39;re &#39;*hanging out*&#39; with that boy!?&quot; to their kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you call your husband Keith to the kids? That doesn&#39;t make sense. I&#39;ll try <br/>
again. I call Darin, Darin when I am talking to him, but if I am talking to <br/>
the children about Darin, I call him Dad or Daddy. Do you do the same? Or do <br/>
you call him Keith even when you are talking to the kids? Do your kids call <br/>
you and Keith, Sandra and Keith, or Mom and Dad? <br/>

Our kids sometimes (when talking to each other) call us &#39;parents&#39;.&lt;g&gt; As <br/>

more times than not they call us mommy and daddy :-)<br/>

I, Darin or Nancy, especially Jack. It doesn&#39;t bother me, but Darin always <br/>
says &quot;I am Dad,&quot; or something like that. Jack also calls me Meme, I don&#39;t <br/>
know why, or where he got the name, but it is cute. It is his snuggle name <br/>
for me. <br/>
