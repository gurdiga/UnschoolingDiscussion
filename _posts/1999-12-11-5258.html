<br/>
I remember her! I was on the Christ Centered Unschoolers list when all<br/>
that was going on. Heartbreaking, and I am so glad to hear she got both<br/>
girls back here. Last I heard she only had one of them cleared. I wrote<br/>
the Arizona senators and congressmen using a form letter she had at her<br/>
website. Her daughters were just the most darling girls you ever saw too!<br/>
Huge dark eyes... melted my heart! They also enlisted the help of local<br/>
radio and tv stations. <br/>
