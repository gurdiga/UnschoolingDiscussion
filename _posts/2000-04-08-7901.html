This channel is open to any of the children whose parents are on <br/>
the unschooling email list.<br/>
I am not familiar with aol, but I would think you would still just <br/>
download the software from the mIRC website, and join us.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure if aol allows you to add servers to its program or not.<br/>
<br/>
We also have something called icq.  It is another chat service.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe, although I am not certain, that aol is exclusive to aol <br/>
customers.<br/>
<br/>
So far I have just left the computer running, and we are hanging out <br/>
in the chat room, just incase anyone anyone pops in.  If you won&#39;t <br/>
to set up a time, remember to post the time zone.  We are in the <br/>
eastern time zone, with daylight savings time.<br/>

Ditto for me.  I confess, I&#39;m not very web-literate.  I don&#39;t even know what <br/>
irc is!<br/>

IRC stands for real time chat.  Rather than send messages through <br/>
email, and wait for the person to respond, this chat program allows <br/>
for real time chat.  I see what you type the minute you press enter, <br/>
and vice versa.  You can &quot;talk&quot; to people from all around the world.  <br/>
Because of the time differences, and everyone&#39;s different sleep <br/>
patterns, you could literally stay connected 24/7, and always find <br/>
someone to talk to.  Some of the kids channels can be pretty <br/>
vulgar.  Some of the older kids get on the channels, and like to <br/>
practice their &quot;lovely&quot; new vocabulary, away from mom and dad&#39;s <br/>
ears.  They also like to &quot;teach&quot; some of the younger kids things <br/>
which would shock you and I.<br/>
I have set up a channel, which will be secret.  Only those people <br/>
who are aware of this channel, (the unschooler&#39;s list) will have <br/>
access to the channel.  It will not be listed for everyone to see.  <br/>
You will also need a password to enter the channel.  <br/>
Initially I would suggest monitoring your child, until we are sure the <br/>
channel takes off in the direction we would like.  Anyone using <br/>
inappropriate language, and/or vulgarity, will be banned <br/>
immediately, meaning, they will no longer have access to the <br/>
channel. <br/>
Once again, the download site is:   www.mirc.co.uk<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to keep my post with all of the information on it.  If someone <br/>
could repost it, either to the list, or to me, I would appreciate it.<br/>
