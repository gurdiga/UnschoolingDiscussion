<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752434220">I think it was on this list that someone mentioned a program that helps kids<br/>
make the freeze frame type movie. (I can&#39;t remember what it is called!). It<br/>
is the type that you set up the props, take a picture, then move the props,<br/>
take a picture, etc etc. Then you put it all together so that it looks like<br/>
the figures are moving. Does anyone have a recommendation for a program? My<br/>
kids are 7 years.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215327611">The term you&#39;re looking for is &quot;stop action.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lego has a movie creator digital camera/legos/computer interface for<br/>
making movies with minifigs.  That&#39;s the youngest set I&#39;ve seen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822172202">Oh well and you are gonna LUV this.  I looked it up because it <br/>
sounded like something I would like to do with ds when he gets <br/>
older.  He is very detail oriented and so is his father and so am I, <br/>
and I know that this could be fun for all of us as individuals and <br/>
together too.  We&#39;ll see how it goes.  Hopefully this works for macs <br/>
too because I have an old one it probably WON&#39;T work on.  :(  We&#39;ll <br/>
see.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhoodle.. The program is Stop Motion and it is at this link: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stopmotionpro.com/">http://www.stopmotionpro.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
AND there is something called Brickfilms who are having a contest:  <br/>
<br/>
     The next Brickfilms contest is in cooperation with BrickFest. <br/>
The annual animation competition at BrickFest will also be an <br/>
official Brickfilms contest. BrickFest will be August 13-15 in <br/>
Washington DC. <br/>
We&#39;ve got some more great prizes for this contest, with another copy <br/>
Stop Motion Pro animation software being graciously provided by the <br/>
folks over at Stop Motion Pro. The Sisters are also giving away <br/>
another camera. Scroll down for more details.<br/>
The theme of this contest will be High Adventure Theatre . This is <br/>
not as specific as it might seem. The only requirement is that a <br/>
character or characters must partake in some sort of adventure in <br/>
your film. After that, it&#39;s totally up to your imagination. Any <br/>
genre is fair game, whether it be space, cliffhangers, cavemen, <br/>
hitmen, airplanes, boatplanes, pirates, gangsters, or brickfilm <br/>
noir. <br/>
There will be two sections of the competition, the on-line portion <br/>
and the BrickFest portion. Each will have its own set of prizes and <br/>
system of judging. The same films will be in both sections, you need <br/>
not submit separate films. <br/>
The films will be compiled onto an official Brickfilms/BrickFest DVD <br/>
which will be sold at the festival and afterwards from the <br/>
Brickfilms website. The price will be relatively low, with the aim <br/>
of recovering the costs of production and contest prizes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462242066">At Explora, our hands-on science and children&#39;s museum in Albuquerque, <br/>
there&#39;s a very cool stop-action station where kids make little movies with 195 <br/>
frames or so (fewer I think if you put in sound effects).  Holly loves that and <br/>
made some wonderful things, but...  they don&#39;t save.  Each is erased before the <br/>
next kid comes.<br/>
<br/>
She has started taking her own stuff when we go now.<br/>
<br/>
The last one she made (I helped with part of it) was shown over and over by <br/>
and to volunteers, showing it to each other and being impressed that she wasn&#39;t <br/>
just goofing around with it.<br/>
<br/>
We added paper, and drew on the paper too, as it went.<br/>
<br/>
That was inspired by Teeny Little Super Guy, which used to show on Sesame <br/>
Street sometimes.  Those were combinations of drawn cartoons (on clear plastic <br/>
cups, mostly but not always) and stop-action.   Does anyone know if the guy who <br/>
did those did other things or if those are available somewhere?  We have a <br/>
couple on old tapes of Sesame Street from when Kirby was little, but I would LOVE <br/>
to have them all.  <br/>
