<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547761297">I just had to share this cute bedtime moment with everyone. I was just<br/>
putting 3yo. dd to bed and when I took off her pants to put her pull-up on I<br/>
noticed she had on 2 pair of pants. When I asked her why she said it was<br/>
because she wanted to look cute and cool at the same time. Well 7yo. dd and<br/>
I burst out laughing and then she added to the humor by telling 3yo. that<br/>
cute and cool together made cuticool (as opposed to cuticle). Sorry, I&#39;m<br/>
just having one of those, I&#39;m gushing because my kids are so cute moments.<br/>
