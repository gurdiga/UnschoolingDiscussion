<div id="ygrps-yiv-885421989">I was hoping this topic would come up.  Each yr I struggle with this<br/>
issue.  I came from a family with lots of privileges, and now I feel<br/>
like I&#39;m cheating my kids if there is just a few things under the tree.<br/>
This is strictly my problem.  They probably wouldn&#39;t care a bit.  They<br/>
wouldn&#39;t notice I don&#39;t think.<br/>
Last year instead of buying gifts for all the cousins, we make a book<br/>
for them.  Each one of my kids had a page.  They picked something they<br/>
wanted to tell their cousins and extended family about themselves.    My<br/>
sister, sister in law and cousin all agreed we would do this instead of<br/>
presents as a way to bring our families closer.  We would send them<br/>
before Christmas to be put under the tree and shared on Christmas<br/>
morning.  We were  the only ones that actually did it, and before<br/>
Christmas.  We never received one from my sisters kids at all.  This yr.<br/>
I&#39;m just going to do whatever we decide, and not think about anyone<br/>
else.<br/>
We, in the last couple of years, have also eliminated the big dinner.<br/>
Since I do it at Thanksgiving, it was kind of a bummer to have to take<br/>
part of our special family day and cook, set the table ect....  So, now<br/>
I make homemade pizza, and we eat it off paper towels.   No one minds,<br/>
and I love it.<br/>
I&#39;m gradually learning how to make the holidays a much more relaxed and<br/>
enjoyable time.  I still need help with the gift reduction.  I wish I<br/>
was handy and could make special things for my kids, but, I&#39;m not.<br/>
Hopeless in that dept.<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear how others deal with holidays.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572264581">Ahhhh..... Christmas-time...<br/>
<br/>
Guess what?  I live in the North Pole!!! North Pole, Alaska... exactly 4<br/>
miles from Santa Claus! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a family that made a *very* big deal about Christmas (and<br/>
birthdays, and Thanksgiving, and... and....)  My husband, on the other hand,<br/>
grew up not celebrating *any* holidays!  I&#39;m sure many of you can imagine<br/>
the &quot;struggles&quot; we&#39;ve had, trying to merge his ideas and mine around<br/>
holidays...   My husband&#39;s point (and I think it&#39;s a valid one), is that<br/>
most of us celebrate &quot;big time&quot; on holidays and birthdays, and basically<br/>
ignore our &quot;extended family&quot; and &quot;friends&quot; on other days.  In our family, we<br/>
try to get together and enjoy each others&#39; company on &quot;regular&quot; days...<br/>
buying (and/or making) gifts and giving them on &quot;normal&quot; days, too... You<br/>
know, the same idea as sending a long-lost friend a &quot;Thinking of You&quot; card<br/>
out of the blue, just cuz ya miss her...<br/>
<br/>
At any rate... at Christmas-time, we&#39;ve &quot;run the gammut&quot; from all-out huge<br/>
family gatheringsgourmet meals & fancy clothes in previous years, to last<br/>
year -- it was just my husband, my kids, and me... stayed in jammies **ALL<br/>
DAY** didn&#39;t answer the door or the telephone, watched football, read,<br/>
opened our (very few) gifts... enjoyed each others&#39; company... etc... it was<br/>
truly blissful, relaxing, and stress-free.<br/>
<br/>
This year, we&#39;ll likely be in our new home (it&#39;s not really new... ya&#39;ll can<br/>
check it out on the web at www.universalminds.com/dreams ), which will be<br/>
present enough... All our extra $$$ is going into fixing that place to make<br/>
it livable (mortgage-free.... YES!!!!!!!!!!!).  I plan on making gifts with<br/>
the kids, watching Christmas movies & listening to Christmas music...<br/>
enjoying the festivities around us...<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have special traditions for Christmas that are free or inexpensive<br/>
they&#39;d like to share?<br/>
<br/>
1)  Santa always leaves an orange in our stockings for good luck<br/>
2)  Gram always wraps one present in Sunday comics<br/>
3)  I watch Sound of Music *every year* (and sing along, of course....)<br/>
4)  I call my parents (who each have new spouses who don&#39;t like this ritual)<br/>
each year at 5am (that&#39;s what time I used to wake them up as a kid, and<br/>
since I&#39;m still their kid, I still &quot;bug them&quot; on Christmas morning &lt;gggg&gt;)<br/>
5)  I give each of my children 2 books... one I think they&#39;ll enjoy, and one<br/>
&quot;Christmas&quot; book to add to their collection for their own homes<br/>
6) Each child gets an ornament that in some way ties in to the theme of<br/>
their book...  For example, last year, Zac receive the book &quot;The Three<br/>
Trees&quot; and received a pine tree ornament. (check your local used bookstore<br/>
for great finds on books...)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we now have snow here... I&#39;m already &quot;getting in the spirit&quot;....<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;d love to hear how others deal with holidays. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well another two weeks and I&#39;ll have my shopping done.  I hate christmas <br/>
crowds so I start in July, buy something for each of them every month, stick <br/>
it away.  It took awhile to do this and I slipped up last year big time.  <br/>
But, I gain on this because we can afford to by a little here and there for <br/>
the big type christmas.  It also allows us to stay home during the holidays <br/>
and enjoy each others company.  We also celebrate St. Nicholas day on <br/>
Decemeber 6th, Santa comes to leave something in the shoes of boys and girls, <br/>
what they get depends on whether they&#39;ve been good or bad, so the story goes, <br/>
no one here has gotten the required coal or switches for the bad ones though. <br/>
 Anyway, that and advent calenders set off the season for us, we try to do <br/>
something together that is christmasy every night starting on the 6th.  Even <br/>
if that means just pulling out everyone&#39;s santa/snowman/tree mugs to sip hot <br/>
chocolate from.  And of course we tend to have every holiday movie ever made. <br/>
 Last year was a big milestone when the 7yo actually sat through most of <br/>
White Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
I got sick of the *spend the holidays in the kitchen* syndrome too.  I make <br/>
the Thanksgiving meal.  For christmas, we open gifts on Christmas eve, I do a <br/>
spread of sandwich stuff or bake a ham that day with salads that I try to do <br/>
the 23rd.  Every body eats left overs on Christmas day and lays around :)<br/>
<br/>
New Years I&#39;ve taken to making snacks for the football crowd and making <br/>
something I like, something each one likes.  Sauerbraten only gets cooked <br/>
here once during the year in other words &lt;g&gt;....<br/>

<br/>
Mmm... that sounds tasty.. I&#39;ve had it only once, but think I liked it..<br/>
<br/>
Our &quot;only once a year&quot; Christmas fare includes tamales, which take *days* to<br/>
make...  I wrote earlier that we stayed in jammies all day last Christmas,<br/>
which is true.. I&#39;d made the tamales beforehand, and forgot to mention that<br/>
we eat those every year..  Last year, I made 22 dozen of &#39;em.  (Didn&#39;t eat<br/>
them all though....&lt;ggg&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;ve thought about this for some time, and I can&#39;t come up with a<br/>
single thing.  &quot;THing-wise&quot;  I thing the most special thing about the<br/>
holidays is the time we spend together.  Not just on the day, but the whole<br/>
time preparing.  The tree, putting up lights, opening advent calendars<br/>
ect...  Those things are more special Magical than anything.<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking about special traditions we have.  Every Christmas Eve<br/>
the Christmas eve elf comes when no one is around, and leaves a book and an<br/>
ornament under the tree for each child.<br/>
The book is always some book with very special illustrations, maybe a<br/>
Christmas book, but not always.<br/>

 The book is always some book with very special illustrations, maybe a<br/>
 Christmas book, but not always. &gt;&gt;<br/>
    A special tradition for us, well a few would be...<br/>
While the children are bathing, the jamma elves come and if you have been <br/>
good, they leave you a pair of Christmas jammas. One year, my oldest threw a <br/>
temper tantrum in the store on Christmas Eve. He got out of the tub, and got <br/>
a note from the elves. He needed to straighten up NOW or he would be left <br/>
out. You see, that is how Santa knows for sure that you have been good. Santa <br/>
gets his list, but the last few weeks are so busy that he cannot keep an eye <br/>
on everyone so well. The elves travel around and give jammas to the really <br/>
good children. Ds was great for the rest of the night and the elves left <br/>
jammas on his pillow.<br/>
    We read &quot;&#39;Twas The Night Before Christmas&quot; every year just before bed. We <br/>
get a mug of cocoa and sit together and read the story. This year I am <br/>
sending a tape down to my Dad and asking him to read it on tape. I grew up <br/>
listening to him, and my children will not hear it from him for too much <br/>
longer (he is 78). So I feel that this would be a great way to add to the <br/>
sentiment of Christmas.<br/>
    We do the tree together, but Santa does the candy canes. If we did them, <br/>
we would be up until sunrise zinging around, and Santa would miss our home.<br/>
    We always leave milk and homemade goodies.<br/>
    The children pick out a new ornament each year. This is so that the first <br/>
Christmas that they are on their own, they will have something from their <br/>
life at home, to remember the family Christmas.<br/>
    And Santa does not wrap gifts. It is expensive, and all the paper is <br/>
wasted. Never appreciated. Why bother Santa with the extra work.<br/>
That is our Christmas in a nutshell.<br/>
We go to mass, most of the time. I have never done the advent calendar, but <br/>
would love to. This year is going to be simplified, so all the same <br/>
traditions, it just should not take all day to get through the presents under <br/>
the tree.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873850470">My traditions:<br/>
<br/>
1) Every year *after* Christmas, I buy one ornament (on sale, of course)<br/>
for each of my three children, and give it to them the following year to<br/>
hang on the tree;<br/>
<br/>
2) My kids are pretty well grown now, but when they were all at home,<br/>
I&#39;d wrap each kids&#39; presents in a different wrapping paper and there<br/>
would be no names on any of the gifts. Only *I* knew whose paper<br/>
belonged to whom. (I would tape a snippet of each into my Christmas<br/>
Journal in case I forgot!)<br/>
<br/>
3) It may sound boring, but we have the same Christmas meal every year<br/>
with traditional family recipes; I used to think it wasn&#39;t<br/>
appreciated/noticed, but now that my kids are almost grown, they *fuss*<br/>
if I leave one of the usual things out of the menu!<br/>
<br/>
4) All three of the kids used to always sleep in the same room together<br/>
on Christmas Eve, even when they got to be teenagers! (I don&#39;t really<br/>
think it was sibling love; I think they each wanted to make sure no one<br/>
got to the presents before the others!)<br/>
<br/>
5) I always call &quot;home&quot; (Illinois) on Christmas Day to talk to everyone<br/>
who is gathered at someone or other&#39;s home for the big day ~ and I cry.<br/>
:o( (I&#39;m 45 years old, have been away from &quot;home&quot; for over 20 years, yet<br/>
it still happens.) <br/>

<br/>
We do the same thing, for the same reason.  It is so special to have these.  <br/>
My guys also pick out a plaster ornament at the craft store to paint, as well <br/>
as a plaster village piece to make their own Christmas Village.  I am an avid <br/>
collector of Christmas village and add to mine each year.  Soon will be <br/>
running out of room!   From October to Christmas has always been my most <br/>
favorite time of year.  The special things we did as kids, mean so much as <br/>
the years go on.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you spend lots of money on toys, or <br/>
make your gifts.  If you dress up for the day or stay in your jammas,  it is <br/>
just the specialness of the day and what that means to your family, and what <br/>
they will take with them for ever.  My DH had next to nothing growing up, and <br/>
living in a poor country that depended on tourism, the holidays meant extra <br/>
work and extra money, but there were still the memories of the fun on Boxing <br/>
Day, the day after, when everything on the island was closed, everything <br/>
being open on Christmas.  Well, I wonder on, but it is just because I <br/>
remember all the warm, beautiful times, and hope my guys are building <br/>
memories too.<br/>

Doesn&#39;t sound boring at all, ours is the same way and the repeat of <br/>
Thanksgiving.  Last year I broke my ankle right after Halloween,  I was off <br/>
my feet for a good six weeks, and we decided to just order the dinner from <br/>
Publix,  Dh brought me the menu and prices, ect.  I couldn&#39;t stand it.  There <br/>
was nothing there, nothing that we always had.  I had to make the dinner <br/>
myself, just couldn&#39;t stand it.  DH did all the shopping, it was such a joke, <br/>
we kept forgetting things and he kept having to go back.  The boys helped, <br/>
everyone got in on the act, and here I was, in a kitchen chair on wheels, <br/>
rolling back and forth across the kitchen.  It was such a joy that we all did <br/>
it at Christmas too, cause I still wasn&#39;t 100% for standing.  Point is, the <br/>
boys, and dh, have talked about it all year.  They still bring it up, and <br/>
laugh,  Memory made for a lifetime.  <br/>
