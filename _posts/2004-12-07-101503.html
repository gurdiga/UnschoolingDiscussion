<div id="ygrps-yiv-441750383">I learned that my nephew is getting Donkey Konga for Christmas and I would like to get him an extra drum.<br/>
<br/>
Is it best to just get the drums that are sold specifically to go with the set?  Do they hook up to the gamecube somehow?  Or is it just as much fun to have any old kongas for multiple players?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
