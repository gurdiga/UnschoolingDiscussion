&lt;&lt; I&#39;m on a list about going from homeschool to college and at least according<br/>
to most of those folks&#39; experience, the above is not true. It seems that<br/>
most places do expect a transcript of some kind. Most hsers make them up<br/>
themselves - it seems like a personal decision as to how much you make it<br/>
look like a regular school&#39;s or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well they want a high school transcript, which is automatic for people who go <br/>
to high school.  What they expect of general applicants and what they will <br/>
actually get from unschoolers won&#39;t be the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Transcript&quot; just basically means a written record, for one thing.  The <br/>
record of unschooling won&#39;t look like a list of courses with grades.  When they DO <br/>
look like that, they&#39;re fraudulent.  If I were an admissions officer I would <br/>
care more about honesty and integrity than &quot;a transcript.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The current issue of People Magazine has an article about people (not <br/>
homeschoolers) who have done special things when they applied to college, and in each <br/>
of the listed instances it helped.  Weird things.<br/>

<br/>
But if a college insists on transcripts they COULD look like what is standard <br/>
and really not be fraudulent.  Aren&#39;t grades in school subjective?  They <br/>
reflect only the areas the teacher chooses to test or grade on.  So IF you were to <br/>
do transcripts for an unschooled child and you graded them as fully <br/>
successful in the things you list, wouldn&#39;t that be an accurate statement of how you <br/>
feel as a parent, the &quot;teacher&quot; in the schools sense of the word?  You could use <br/>
the list of requirements that the college/university accepts and &quot;grade&quot; your <br/>
child on what you feel is appropriate accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could spend some time talking to how ever many people it takes to <br/>
explain &quot;unschooling&quot; a term they may not have heard of before and make phone <br/>
calls and write letters and have visits until someone recognizes the uniqueness of <br/>
your child and agrees to admit them to their school.<br/>
<br/>
Probably even more ways but sometimes just providing what they ask for in a <br/>
direct sort of way is easiest and perfectly acceptable.<br/>

Doesn&#39;t it depend on what the teen wants to do?  Most schools are very open<br/>
to &quot;alternative&quot; students, some aren&#39;t at all.  Depending on the teen&#39;s<br/>
plans, they might want to attend a school that isn&#39;t open to &quot;unschooling<br/>

that if an unschooled kid made up a transcript that made it look like <br/>
they&#39;d taken classes and gotten grades, and if he found out later that <br/>
it was all made up, that they&#39;d consider the kid had gotten in <br/>
fraudulently and they&#39;d evict him from the school. He said he wanted <br/>
the truth about what the kid had been busy doing during those years, <br/>
not something made up. He said that courses listed and graded by a <br/>
homeschooling parent didn&#39;t mean much to him anyway because ALL <br/>
homeschooling parents pretty much give their kids all &quot;A&#39;s.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
AND he said he&#39;d be FAR more likely to take a close look at a kid <br/>
without a traditional transcript, too.<br/>
<br/>
When we chose to unschool, we chose to NOT school and that meant we <br/>
don&#39;t get the trappings of school. So - to later make up something that <br/>
implies that we DID school, that is clearly dishonest. I&#39;d far rather <br/>
have my kid never go to college then to go based on a complete <br/>
fabrication like that.<br/>
<br/>
But it really is not a choice of &quot;lie or miss out&quot; - to create a <br/>
transcript that describes what the child REALLY did, that is honest and <br/>
can be pretty wonderful, is very possible. It doesn&#39;t have to list <br/>
courses he didn&#39;t take with grades he didn&#39;t earn and it doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to be done under the pretense that he &quot;did school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you ask them, colleges will say, &quot;Yes, he must have a transcript.&quot; <br/>
But the transcript can very often be a narrative, not a course/grade <br/>
listing. Even when they want it in a more traditional format, it can be <br/>
without grades, just a list of subjects that the kid has spent time <br/>
learning something about during the previous few years. It certainly <br/>
does not have to be a course list divided into semesters with credits <br/>
and grades EVEN if the college says that is what they want, when they <br/>
actually get the application, they&#39;ll review it. IF the student has <br/>
high SAT or ACT scores, they will barely look at it.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE universities that will not take homeschoolers based on <br/>
coursework at all - unschoolers or otherwise. University of California <br/>
is one of those. They have coursework that is required and it has to be <br/>
pre-certified that it meets their requirements. This means they have to <br/>
have, in advance, approved the textbooks and subject matter for the <br/>
courses. Most public schools have had their courses approved and some <br/>
private schools. But there is no way an unschooler is going to qualify <br/>
based on &quot;coursework&quot;. Still, unschoolers get into UCLA and Berkeley <br/>
and other UC&#39;s all the time. They often do it based on high SAT scores <br/>
and they also do it based on community college coursework. And all <br/>
schools have a &quot;special admissions&quot; category.<br/>
<br/>
When you step outside the mainstream, it is not honest to suddenly jump <br/>
into the middle of the river and pretend you&#39;ve been swimming along <br/>
with everybody else all those years. And, it is the nonmainstream <br/>
activities that will get a child noticed anyway - pretending to have <br/>
done coursework just like everybody else makes the kid look just like <br/>
everybody else. Not an advantage for getting into a prestigious <br/>
university and not necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-324658355">&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s harsher than advice to lie and fake transcripts.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody said to lie or fake.  What was suggested is that the parent is the<br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; and she can choose what skills and content areas she wishes to use<br/>
to &quot;assess&quot; her &quot;student&quot;.  There is a HUGE range between &quot;no transcripts&quot;<br/>
and &quot;lying and cheating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have had to do this numerous times here in the Bible belt where school<br/>
grades and report cards are rewarded in totally unrelated areas, like<br/>
gymnastics team or karate.<br/>
<br/>
My transcript was a narrative, the kind used in some schools, and was<br/>
mastery-based.  I didn&#39;t say &quot;Math--A&quot;.  Perhaps this is the &quot;lying and<br/>
cheating&quot; transcript to which you referred.<br/>
<br/>
I said that &#39;Adriane raises dairy goats and the paperwork required her to<br/>
use the following mathematical skills:  Addition with decimals, adding and<br/>
subtracting fractions, long division....&quot;   No lying, no cheating, but a<br/>
transcript nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I chose Adriane&#39;s better skills to highlight (I didn&#39;t mention<br/>
spelling) because as the &quot;teacher&quot; I got to choose the things I thought were<br/>
&quot;important enough&quot; to assess.  Spelling didn&#39;t make the top ten &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could have simply told her coach that we unschool and I am<br/>
philosophically opposed to transcripts but it wouldn&#39;t have served Adriane&#39;s<br/>
purpose which was to get a free slushie for a good report card.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this as any different than talking about how in theory rewards<br/>
and punishments are bad for kids, but in practice paying Billy $5 to sit<br/>
through a concert that you really want to attend and he would just as soon<br/>
miss.<br/>
<br/>
Theory is very clean and easily delineated.  Life tends to get messy and the<br/>
lines blur.<br/>

compromise.  Transcripts can be perfectly morally done by a parent.  No one said <br/>
to say you sat through three years of advanced mathematics or four years of an <br/>
English class.<br/>
<br/>
Much like Julie said, you can simply write a &quot;transcript&quot; of what your child <br/>
DID accomplish in the years that prepared them for the <br/>
College/University/School they are attempting to get into.  Things that YOU feel would make them an <br/>
asset to the program.  After all, that&#39;s what teachers and counselors do all <br/>
the time.  You go to the teacher/counselor/person who is most likely to give you <br/>
a glowing review and recommendation right?  Who better than a parent to <br/>
provide glowing comments on a wonderful child?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think it important that I add &quot;if your child hasn&#39;t had four years <br/>
of German/Latin/Spanish, don&#39;t say they&#39;ve had it.  I simply meant that use <br/>
what your child knows and highlight it in a way to make it attractive to the <br/>
school they are looking for admission into.<br/>

You did not describe anything remotely like what Julie did, you said<br/>
supplying grades for a transcript was ok.  Julie described a perfectly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056880639">Is this off-topic?  If it is, please say so  <br/>
 <br/>
I try to be purposeful, or somewhat so, about the toys my kids have.<br/>
Sure, a lot of it is stuff I wouldnt consider learning toys, etc.,<br/>
but I have a problem including toys that are violent such as guns,<br/>
swords, green army men.  My thought is that if they want these toys they<br/>
can fashion them from sticks, bats, green rocks, or whatever.  It is one<br/>
way I have of sharing nonviolent values w/my kids. <br/>
 <br/>
Do any of you have similar values?  How did you address it with family<br/>
and friends?  It hasnt been an issue w/my girl but I expect, based on<br/>
giving of vague aunts and uncles to other boys in the family, that with<br/>
this birthday (#2) or next it will be an issue.  Ive spread the word as<br/>
best I can, but if such a gift is given, how might I approach it w/out<br/>
coming off as rude and irrational?<br/>
 <br/>
On a broader note, does it much matter if one has a lot of learning<br/>
toys around the house vs. toys like electronic VTech toys?  (My familys<br/>
favorite gifts.)  Im wondering if I should start constructing a<br/>
different environment or just wait until they ask for these learning<br/>
toys (tinkertoys, etc.)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for any thoughts or advice!<br/>

&lt;&lt; More people are finding ways into college without them. <br/>
More colleges are accepting students without transcripts.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Those improvements didn&#39;t come about by unschoolers lying and faking<br/>
transcripts, and  <br/>
no one will be helped if unschoolers or homeschoolers gain a reputation<br/>
for cheating.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
VERY true.<br/>
<br/>
Admissions officers and all kinds of people everywhere are gradually learning <br/>
that alternatives exist and can be fantastic.   Why not help with that <br/>
instead of hindering it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-       I can respect different points of view about why a family might <br/>
choose <br/>
this or that for themselves, including a parent&#39;s view that for HER family it <br/>
would be dishonest, just as it might be a matter of conscience not to <br/>
register or to submit annual evalautions to the school system. <br/>
<br/>
-=- But this can be carried past that point of personal conscience and <br/>
become moralizing against parents who see it differently, as has happened <br/>
with <br/>
charter schooling and virtual schooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have to agree here.  Different points of view are being expressed.  <br/>
If a transcript is honest, that is not dishonest.  I recommended describing <br/>
unschooling in prose, not with a list of classes, credits and grades.  If <br/>
someone knowingly creates the illusion that a child took a chemistry class and &quot;got <br/>
an A&quot; (or a B or a D, it doesn&#39;t matter) when there was no formal chemistry <br/>
instruction whatsoever, that is fraud.  And it could reflect badly on other <br/>
unschoolers in the future.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not moralism.  It&#39;s an objection to illegality.  I don&#39;t think the <br/>
mother will go to hell, but I think she could make my life worse later, AND I <br/>
believe that it sets a bad example for othed on a list of which I&#39;m part owner <br/>
(without the counter-opinion being offered).  <br/>
<br/>
-=-      When it&#39;s suggested that moms just take their kids&#39; tests and do <br/>
their <br/>
homework for them, to keep school off their backs, we didn&#39;t see moralizing <br/>
about dishonesty and lies and complete fabrications.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember that being seriously proposed.  I remember recommendations <br/>
of not timing tests, or answering kids&#39; questions, and I remember one <br/>
recommendation that if the dad wanted to see workbooks, the mom could help the child <br/>
get that over with to get on to better things.  If someone were to serious make <br/>
those recommendations and press them, I would be glad to say &quot;why not just be <br/>
honest&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
When New Mexico required a calendar showing which 180 days would be school <br/>
days with each homeschooling letter of intent, one year I made a calendar.  One <br/>
year I said &quot;Same as APS.&quot;  The third year I lightly photocopied our first <br/>
year&#39;s and wrote over it that it was important to  me to model honesty for my <br/>
children, and we had no days off from learning, but our &quot;schoolyear&quot; was 365 days.<br/>
<br/>
They cared no more or less about that than they had the other two ways.<br/>
<br/>
If honesty is as good as dishonesty, then it&#39;s a better choice. <br/>
That&#39;s not moralizing.  It&#39;s logic and practicality.<br/>

It would have been for me.  But for Adriane who is the only homeschooler she<br/>
knows that isn&#39;t extremely conservative, sometimes she just wants to do what<br/>
the other kids are doing.  Her gym is next door to Sonic and the coach goes<br/>
over during their warm down and the kids have them all together at the end.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Who benefited from the slushie situation?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My child did.  It didn&#39;t break my moral bank and she was happy.<br/>
<br/>
And just for the record, having the parent fill out the tests for kids to<br/>
keep the schools off their back has been recommended on this list in what<br/>
seemed a serious manner to me more than a few times.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sorry, but isn&#39;t not timing a timed test dishonest? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Only if you&#39;re trying to prove something with a high score.<br/>
If what you want is to have a score that you and your child are absolutely <br/>
certain is INvalid, then &quot;dishonest&quot; isn&#39;t an issue.<br/>
<br/>
If a family cheats and gets a perfect high score, that sucks nine ways.  But <br/>
to invalidate with a middling, not impressive, not frightening, not valid <br/>
score is just tampering without a victim.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re not supposed to talk if you&#39;re taking the standardized test the <br/>
standard way for the standard purpose.<br/>

I don&#39;t believe lying is a good idea at all.<br/>
<br/>
If I helped a kid goof up a standardized test and someone from the testing <br/>
company asked me point blank &quot;Did you administer this test according to the <br/>
directions?&quot; I would say, &quot;No, I didn&#39;t, but the state law has been fulfilled and <br/>
you got your $35 and we don&#39;t intend to use those scores for anything on this <br/>
earth.  B&#39;bye.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve suggested that people who are afraid not to register but don&#39;t want <br/>
to register can fill out the form, get it notarized and make copies for their <br/>
relatives and neighbors but not mail the form, I&#39;ve never said &quot;and then lie <br/>
and say you sent it.&quot;  I say &quot;If the state asks you, don&#39;t lie.  Just say &#39;I <br/>
have a copy; I&#39;ll send it to you.&#39;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
People have gone that route but never has anyone actually been asked.  But by <br/>
New Mexico law it&#39;s not even a misdemeanor.  It&#39;s a request from the state to <br/>
comply, and if a person sent a paper notorized months before, nobody at the <br/>
filing-desk would give a darn.  They would assume they&#39;d just misfiled the <br/>
first one.  No emotion, no victim, no harm, no evil.<br/>

THEM liars.  IAnd I haven&#39;t done either one.<br/>
<br/>
       The prejudice I meant was that of people who view as lying all <br/>
academic transcripts as a &quot;form,&quot; or standardized tests or grades as a form -- I <br/>
don&#39;t like those form either and believe there are all kinds of legal, moral, <br/>
useful ways around them, nevertheless the form itself is not automatically a lie. <br/>
Not even for unschoolers imo. <br/>
<br/>
      But there are plenty of legitimate criticisms and alternatives to both <br/>
that we could discuss, which is all I meant to suggest. JJ <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I haven&#39;t run into a gun issue yet but my 2 yr old loves to sword fight. Play is how they sort out life and issues and violence is an issue in life. I have great memories of hours of GIJoe, lots of wrestling with my sister and brother and stupid dueling games that involving getting whipped with bungee cords if you were too slow (My husband complains that my playful punches really hurt. He didn&#39;t grow up with brothers :) ). If your kids are asking for swords and guns are you refusing? You may also be showing your predjudice and a narrow view of these items. Swords have a captivating history. Bow technology played a big role in european history (check out the English long bow), guns are often used as valuable tools with no violent connotation (that&#39;s the view I grew up with - you shot deer with a gun to feed the family ). Are your kids being denied a wider view of these things because of your ideas about them? <br/>
<br/>
  Do any of you have similar values?  How did you address it with family<br/>
  and friends?  It hasn&#39;t been an issue w/my girl but I expect, based on<br/>
  giving of vague aunts and uncles to other boys in the family, that with<br/>
  this birthday (#2) or next it will be an issue.  I&#39;ve spread the word as<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Learn about it. I think &#39;violent&#39;  toys are no different then any other issue in unschooling. And for me unschooling has never meant shutting things out but rather learning all I can about them so there&#39;s balance. You may not have that balance right now in regards to swords and guns. Maybe some reading on the art of swordmaking. How about the physics involved? And why the variety?If swords are just gloryfied sharp sticks why would one person or culture require a wide curved blade, another a long, slim one, another a huge thing that you need both hands and strong shoulders for?  What about the roles that guns have played in history. Gun barrels grew to ridiculous amounts here in NA when natives would trade a stack of beaver pelts that had to match the length of a rifle...a good reflection of the lack of respect shown to a native trading partners in the last century. Are guns and sword really just about violence or is that just how you see them. My interest in swords and bows has brought me to history, Shakespeare, science, politics, etc. Not much violence as a result though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As with anything that gets limited or controled, it often becomes more<br/>
desirable.<br/>
<br/>
I watched my sister in law go through this. She didn&#39;t want guns in her<br/>
home. But her son was really really interested and turned anything into a<br/>
gun. Eventually she relented and she would tell him to only point at<br/>
imaginary bad guys.<br/>
<br/>
He now has a BB gun and rifle and enjoys paint ball. Exactly what you don&#39;t<br/>
want to hear ;-) And yet he&#39;s a very peaceful kid. He has no interest in<br/>
hunting. When he and my daughter were watching an anime together with 5 guys<br/>
controlling huge armored robots, he chose the pacifist as his favorite<br/>
character, the one who didn&#39;t want to kill.<br/>
<br/>
Play can be a way of exploring something kids will be doing for real in the<br/>
future. But it can also be a way of safely playing out a desire for<br/>
something they *don&#39;t* want to do in real life. By killing pretend people,<br/>
it helps them reinforce the ideas why they wouldn&#39;t want to kill real<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is one way I have of sharing nonviolent values w/my kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And perhaps it would be useful to examine how you&#39;re going about sharing<br/>
your nonviolent values: You are using your natural power over kids -- or<br/>
planning to -- to stop them from exploring something that (perhaps)<br/>
interests them. It&#39;s the same method that people with guns do. They want<br/>
someone to do something that the other person doesn&#39;t want to do, so they<br/>
use power over them to make them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Other than what you&#39;ve done by mentioning the types of things that go<br/>
against your values, there isn&#39;t a way to graciously refuse a gift. Either<br/>
the gift giver is oblivious to your message or they&#39;re choosing to ignore it<br/>
because they think you&#39;re wrong. If your son has no interest in the guns he<br/>
receives, you can say thanks and list it on eBay the next day or return it<br/>
to Toys R Us for store credit if you&#39;ve left it in the package.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s more helpful for getting unschooling to not divide toys into<br/>
educational and non-educational but to divide them into things they&#39;re<br/>
interested in and things they aren&#39;t (yet) interested in.<br/>
<br/>
The most learningful toys are the ones the kids play with :-)<br/>

things that might interest them. Get more of what they like, but keep other<br/>
things that might intrigue them running through their lives. If they enjoy<br/>
building with cardboard boxes, try other building toys. (But those are the<br/>
kinds of things that are easy and cheap to get at garage sales so you don&#39;t<br/>
need to invest a lot of money.)<br/>

 <br/>
On a broader note, does it much matter if one has a lot of “learning”<br/>
toys around the house vs. toys like electronic VTech toys?  (My family’s<br/>
favorite gifts.)  I’m wondering if I should start constructing a<br/>
different environment or just wait until they ask for these “learning”<br/>
toys (tinkertoys, etc.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I used to be all gung ho about only buying &quot;educational&quot; toys or toys deemed<br/>
more worthy by virtue of being &quot;old fashioned&quot; and of high quality - like<br/>
only wooden block sets or those personality neutral dolls that are sold for<br/>
big $ in some beautifully printed catalogues. I have so totally relaxed. <br/>
Now the only criteria I use for whether I will buy a toy are: 1/ Jayn (4.5)<br/>
has actually asked for it; 2/ We can afford it; 3/ We have the room for it<br/>
in our apartment. (She can hardly wait for a new room so she can have a<br/>
dolls&#39; house). *All* her toys are learning tools, and the issue of quality<br/>
has been one that I have also let go of. For example, I was only interested<br/>
in getting her nice paints and real bristle paintbrushes. She asked for the<br/>
really cheap little watercolor trays that come with coloring books, and<br/>
likes using those awful cheap brushes they come with to scrape on the paper,<br/>
along with her good brushes. She has often gotten just as much out of the<br/>
dolls that come with her Happy Meal, as she has out of her collectible<br/>
Barbies - and boy do I feel better about her pulling those ones apart to<br/>
turn them into puppets, or repainting their clothes different colors.<br/>
Actually I let go of my anxiety about her destroying any of her own things,<br/>
as long as she is doing it deliberately and mindfully - transformation not<br/>
destruction. I mean, if she is throwing something in a fury, I try to<br/>
prevent the damage since I know she will be sorry later, but if she is<br/>
cutting their hair knowing it won&#39;t grow back - well they are her things,<br/>
not mine. She also has a bunch of porcelain dolls, of which she is very<br/>
careful.<br/>
How does Jayn discover the toys she wants? TV, internet, catalogues,<br/>
browsing at stores, visiting friends, seeing some toy/tool Daddy has bought<br/>
for himself. Least successful: adults buying her some unseen or unasked for<br/>
toy and giving it to her as a surprise. Sometimes she gets downright angry<br/>
and insists we take it back to the store.<br/>
I have always disliked those electronic toys along the lines of Lets Pretend<br/>
Elmo (is that the right name?) that direct the child&#39;s play. I think<br/>
disliking them allowed me to feel superior somehow. Jayn solves that problem<br/>
with pretty much all the dolls she has that talk, by choosing to switch them<br/>
off. What a concept: she is in charge of her own playing and there is no<br/>
&quot;right&quot; way to use any of it! I can trust her to use all her stuff in ways<br/>
far beyond the instructions. And her enormously expensive plain wood blocks<br/>
(a gift from grandparents) have a bunch of drawing and coloring on them.<br/>
Do &quot;violent&quot; toys create violent nasty children? Does seemingly violent role<br/>
playing in games, electronic or physical, create violent people without a<br/>
grasp of limits in other real situations (ie psychopaths)? All of my<br/>
experience observing gently parented and unschooled children says &quot;no&quot;<br/>
resoundingly. <br/>
However, nor does the absence of these violent toys guarantee having a child<br/>
who is universally non-violent in her regular behavior either. The &quot;worst&quot;<br/>
we have are some plastic &quot;Medieval&quot; swords and shields from Ikea that we<br/>
play with together, and I like them better than sticks because the swords<br/>
are blunted, and the shields guard ones hands from whacks. They sit on the<br/>
shelf for many months at a time. She has a couple of toy armored vehicles -<br/>
but it is about them being battery operated and they could just as well be<br/>
painted with pink polka dots as army camouflage colors. She has self limited<br/>
the violent type toys, by not wanting any of them. Her preferred<br/>
video/computer games are Barbie and Princesses. She asks me to fast forward<br/>
through scary violent moments on her DVD&#39;s. She has never been hit or<br/>
punished, although I have shouted at her sometimes, and am working on that.<br/>
She will hit me across the head when frustrated, and sometimes laughs while<br/>
doing it - exploring her own power? Testing my limits? She has turned those<br/>
innocuous &quot;educational&quot; toys into dangerous projectiles, but it is all<br/>
directed at me, or her father - safe targets I guess. It has been a long<br/>
time since she has kicked or hit another child while playing - and it was<br/>
sometimes provoked at the time. She sometimes still gets excited with sand<br/>
tossing, throwing it up into the air, and this escalates into throwing at<br/>
people - but I step in (as I have mentioned in other posts).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203132118">Would you buy them a power wheels car to drive? Or let them play with trucks<br/>
and cars? What about playing with a toy oven? Or if they pretend to build<br/>
and play with a fire?<br/>
<br/>
Just something else to think about. All real things that aren&#39;t toys at some<br/>
point too.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; We choose not to have any toys that are/look like guns or knives/swords as<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; us these things should never be considered toys as the real things are to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; respected and handled with care (and not toys to be played with). I feel<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; they grow up this way they will likely go hunting with their Dad but will<br/>
always<br/>
&gt; take weapons seriously and not ever see them as a play thing/toy.  JMO!<br/>
Works<br/>
&gt; for us! LynnF<br/>
