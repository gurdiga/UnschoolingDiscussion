<br/>
We all want to quit occassionally.  I want to run away and live a life <br/>
of clean houses, no children, few bills, and then I realize what I&#39;d miss.<br/>

<br/>
Scared to quit school?<br/>
Using a curriculum?<br/>
<br/>
You want to quit unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ve wanted to just quit life.  That&#39;s a dangerous place for <br/>
mothers of children to be.  So if you&#39;re talking depression, that&#39;s big and you <br/>
should get help to breathe and think better.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re talking fear of unschooling, we can help you lots and easily, I <br/>
think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493087584">I believe from your previous posts that you are a high school age  girl who has been with us on the list for a short while and have also posted on the message board...Is this correct?<br/>
If so Hi-and yes  a lot of us have concerns before we  &quot;make the move&quot;.<br/>
Well I guess if I was  sitting having a coffee with you in person I might ask what your real joys and interests are. Are they such that you can get just so involved in following your interests that  one day soon you just don&#39;t  have time to bother going  to public school? LOL <br/>
Actually if we knew more about  your situation , plans, interests, reasons, parents viewpoint  many of us would be more than happy to make more useful comments or offer some ideas.<br/>
But yes, thinking of leaving public school  could be too scary if you  are thinking of it as quitting. If you are looking ahead to having more time and  energy and enthusiasm to follow some dreams its more like coming in from the cold to a warm and exciting place.<br/>
Take care now...<br/>

<br/>
I want to quit, but am too scared to, is this common? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you mean quit unschooling?  I think it&#39;s not uncommon to feel<br/>
anxious, or sometimes question if what you&#39;re doing is best for your kids,<br/>
or yourself.  How long have you been unschooling?  How old are your kids?<br/>
Do you have support or opposition?  Are you going through a particular<br/>
struggle, or just feeling exhausted?  More information would help a lot in<br/>
knowing how to respond best to the question. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  <br/>
Marjorie, who just helped organize a by-monthly unschoolers discussion group<br/>
to give me that boost when needed!</div>
