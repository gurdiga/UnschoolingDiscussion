may have not met the folks on this group who profess to be accepting <br/>
Christians in person, you can talk to and relate with us via this group.   Hopefully, <br/>
you will see that not all Christians are judgemental, narrow minded folks.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638202390">Gee, I know we had this discussion recently.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested that a useful &quot;shorthand&quot; in these kinds of discussion is that<br/>
there are practicers of a faith (Christians, Pagans, Muslims, etc), there<br/>
are those who are &quot;fundamental&quot; in their beliefs, and there are &quot;fundies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t care what faith you come from, there are FUNDIES in every one.<br/>
And they are all nuts.  Having a strong, or even a very narrow<br/>
interpretation of your faith doesn&#39;t make you a fundie.  Believing that you<br/>
are right, everyone else is wrong, and you have to make sure they all know<br/>
about it makes you a fundie.<br/>
<br/>
Pagan fundies annoy me WAY more than any Christian fundie.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>THAT is so true.. So exactly true.  And, it&#39;s the &quot;fundies&quot; in every group <br/>
that give that group a bad name or incorrect perceptions.   I think anything in <br/>
the extreme is not healthy..( physically, mentally, socially, or emotionally). <br/>
 A &quot;fundie&quot; will say that whatever thier particular beliefs are can ONLY be <br/>
practiced in the extreme measure.  They will say.. well, you dont do this or <br/>
that, so you are not a ___________  Folks can say that because I do not judge, <br/>
and I accept completely, homosexuals, that I am not a Christian.  BOLONEY!   <br/>
It&#39;s what is in your heart that matters.  Not how others define you<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure a lot of vegetarians and vegans feel strongly that you&#39;re <br/>
either in or you&#39;re not.<br/>
