<div id="ygrps-yiv-922959403">Albuquerque ALLive — The Top of the Mountain<br/>
We will discuss the philosophy of unschooling, and go up the tram to Sandia Crest.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too soon to register, but I hope it&#39;s not too late for some of you to save the dates and start planning. <br/>
<br/>
December 27-30<br/>
Albuquerque<br/>
Nice hotel rooms, between $50 and $60 a night<br/>
