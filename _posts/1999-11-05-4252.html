 show....they certainly promote reading, anyway. I am accentuating that <br/>
 positive! LOL<br/>

And, while Arthur does get a little syrup-y for me sometimes, I think it&#39;s OK <br/>
for my kids to know that most kids do go to school.  They are in the minority <br/>
after all.  And some shows (like Magic School Bus - and we love the books) <br/>
are so good that the whole school thing is a minor part of it.<br/>
