<div id="ygrps-yiv-444208761">I went to see Curious George with the kids (14-3) last night. There  are many <br/>
parts of this movie that speak of exploring and having fun in  learning. It <br/>
follows the story line. A man who works in a museum finds happiness  through a <br/>
(child like) playful monkey who sees every moment as an exciting  experience.. <br/>
 There is a small sad part but it bounces back ;).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>DH, DS and I took toddler nephew T to see this on Tuesday night - it <br/>
was T&#39;s first time to a theater-movie. DS was wonderful, holding T&#39;s <br/>
hand from the car into the theater, and helping him up the small steps <br/>
to the seats and all. Occasionally (okay maybe more than occasionally) <br/>
I&#39;d look over at them and DS would have his arm across T&#39;s shoulders <br/>
(just like me sitting there with DH&#39;s arm across my shoulders). It was <br/>
a totally sweet evening.<br/>

I loved that line. He finally came to realize that there was life beyond  his <br/>
facts and he tried it and was a happier man. He found love and happiness and  <br/>
joy. I liked the teacher even though she was a bit love struck.. Two of my <br/>
kids  14 and 6 have requested the purchase of the movie as soon as it&#39;s  <br/>
released.<br/>
