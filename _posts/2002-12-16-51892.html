 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, about unschooling...<br/>
<br/>
Holly had cramps this morning.  She&#39;s eleven, and will at some point have <br/>
cramps regularly for a while, I suppose.  Hasn&#39;t started her period, but <br/>
showed me where it hurt, said it it didn&#39;t feel like any sore muscles from <br/>
skating, nor any stomach or intestinal thing.  She took an Aleve, sat with <br/>
hot corn bag on it for a while, felt better, and went bicycling with a <br/>
neighbor who just got a new bike.  Before that she was listening to the Raffi <br/>
Chistmas stuff (which has been lost in a box in the garage for two years), <br/>
and helping me make pancakes.<br/>
<br/>
Other kids her age are in school, pretty much marking time because it&#39;s the <br/>
week before a vacation and schools get airy and ghostly in those times, from <br/>
some people being gone and the rest being distracted.  Anyone trying to &quot;keep <br/>
up with school&quot; in such seasons can totally relax.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby ate pancakes, was sweet to everyone (his vacation did him good), talked <br/>
to his dad about various things, culminating in his coming and asking if we <br/>
had a copy of Disney&#39;s Jungle Book.  I didn&#39;t ask why.  Maybe because he saw <br/>
Treasure Planet this weekend, and I know Keith likes The Jungle Book.  I had <br/>
one home-copy I bought at a fleamarket or somewhere.  He took it happily.  <br/>
Then Keith took him to work, where he&#39;ll be from the 2:30 he got there to <br/>
7:30 tonight, first doing general floor stuff, and later running anime gaming <br/>
night.  Lots of kids consider him a famous gaming celebrity in town.  He gets <br/>
awestruck looks at the mall.   And he has over two years now of real work in <br/>
a retail business.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty is helping his dad cut wood to make a medieval rope bed, for camping. <br/>
Before that he was playing an online game a friend of his just finished after <br/>
two years of planning, brainstorming and home experimentation.  It&#39;s <br/>
finished.  Oh... and he skated to the credit union to get me cash, and then <br/>
tried to rent a DVD or video, but Hollywood Video was out of both (of the <br/>
movies he wanted). After the wood is cut, Marty and I are going to watch Good <br/>
Will Hunting.  He doesn&#39;t believe it has &quot;the f word&quot; more than Jay and <br/>
Silent Bob.  I said I was sure it did.  That made me remember that Holly has <br/>
requested a click counter (like people use for gate counts) as a gift and I <br/>
had forgotten.  I wish we had it today.   I&#39;ll use tic-marks on a notebook <br/>
and later we&#39;ll have to count the other.  I told Marty I thought there were <br/>
online sites with counts already, but he wants us to count them ourselves.   <br/>
I&#39;ve seen Good Will Hunting twice; he&#39;s never seen it.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, although it&#39;s a light day (so far, at 2:53), I&#39;m fully confident <br/>
that my kids are having more experiences today which will spark their thought <br/>
and imagination than kids in school, AND they&#39;re getting some exercise.  <br/>
Holly&#39;s biking, Marty skated on errands, and Kirby will get that sort of <br/>
exercise people get working with ten or twenty kids, moving between and <br/>
around tables, then taking all that stuff up and vacuuming.    PE.<br/>
<br/>
Keith just said &quot;Well thank you, Martin&quot; outside the window, and Marty said <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Time to watch a movie.<br/>
<br/>
Later!<br/>

<br/>
We saw Treasure Planet this weekend - and it had a trailer for Junble Book 2, so maybe that&#39;s the connection?...BTW, after watching Treasure Planet, some of the younger kids were asking abput supanovas and black holes so we looked up info and I learned something, too. Unschooling is great for all of us. :-)..Leonie W. .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267210011">To get back to the topic of unschooling, I too am very new to the <br/>
concept, and I am willing to learn from anyone willing to offer <br/>
advice or suggestions.  Here&#39;s how our first day went.  You think we <br/>
are on the right track? <br/>
<br/>
I had to get up and take my oldest son to school. He loves school and <br/>
has no desire to stay home.  My dd woke up with her period this <br/>
morning so she had a quiet morning curled up in bed after taking some <br/>
Midol.  My 11 yo ds, after getting up bright and perky at 7:30 am!, <br/>
spent all morning playing on the computer to his hearts content. <br/>
Ususally, I have had to beg plead and bargain with him to get up and <br/>
get ready for school. It was wonderful to see him get up happy this <br/>
morning.  My 7 yo, otoh, slept til almost 10. After he had a bowl of <br/>
oatmeal for breakfast, he said he was ready for school.. LOL  He was <br/>
grinning so  big and he brought me a  book called &quot;What your second <br/>
grader needs to know&quot;  He actually loves that book and he and I took <br/>
turns reading whatever struck his fancy.  This morning he wanted to <br/>
look at maps and try to figure out which state is bigger and <br/>
fartherest away from us. He loves maps and geography.  OH.. <br/>
&lt;interjection&gt;  I saw this interactive globe from Leap Frog while I <br/>
was shopping this weekend.. I know he would love that thing.. Maybe <br/>
Santa can come up with some inventive budgeting to cover it for a <br/>
surprise gift ( since ds doesnt even know the thing exists) OK back <br/>
to our day...I gave the kids an early christmas present of some of <br/>
those velvet posters.  They spent a while coloring those in and <br/>
proudly displaying thier talents.  We had bologna sandwiches for <br/>
lunch and some chex mix and Sundrop.  The boys spent a lot of time <br/>
outside as it was in the upper 60s here today.  We wrapped more <br/>
Christmas presents, each child taking a turn to help wrap the others <br/>
gifts.   Dd had an orthodontist appt at 3, she got green and red <br/>
bands.  Dd asked for cinnamon toast when we got home, and everyone <br/>
decided they wanted some, so I made a pan of cinnamon toast.   Dd <br/>
checked her email and surfed around the net some while the boys spent <br/>
some more time outside jumping on the trampoline.  I had plenty of <br/>
time to sweep the floor, pick up clothes and toys, wash dishes and <br/>
throw in a load of laundry.  All in all, a very good first day of the <br/>
rest of our unschooling lives.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870241262">I forgot something very important.. In the midst of it, I kept <br/>
thinking.. How do I handle this?? I need advice!!  I got through the <br/>
situation, but I would still like to know how others would have <br/>
handled this.  I am sure that things like this will come up a lot as <br/>
me and my family are all learning how to get along with this new <br/>
concept.  OK, here&#39;s the deal.  The kids wanted me to wrap some <br/>
Christmas gifts last night.. I wrapped a few for each of them.  Well, <br/>
7 yo ds wanted to open one this morning.  This Christmas is going to <br/>
be slim and they dont have many to open.  I struggled with what to <br/>
do.  I have let them open presents before Christmas before.. Then, on <br/>
Christmas Eve, when we open packages, they are disappointed because <br/>
they have fewer to open than the other children.  Because of this,I <br/>
had vowed to not let them open any presents early.  Well, now that I <br/>
am trying to T(My)CS, I didnt know what to do.   He got more and more <br/>
upset wanting to open his presents.  Thats when I decided to wrap up <br/>
the velvet poster I had bought and let him open it.  My rationale was <br/>
that that particular gift was inexpensive and more disposable as a <br/>
Christmas gift.  The other kids wanted to color thiers too, so I let <br/>
them all have thier posters.   They really enjoyed the posters today, <br/>
and ds was satisfied at opening that one gift. But, now what?? What <br/>
about tomorrow ? What if he wants to open all of his gifts and then <br/>
he has none to open on Christmas Eve when the other children open <br/>
thiers?  Lay it on me.<br/>

down &#39;til Christmas? Candy canes work great for us. But many years ago when <br/>
Ben and Cameron were here in Columbia already and I was still in St Louis <br/>
selling the house at Christmas, &quot;Mrs. Claus&quot; sent a huge box full of 25 small <br/>
presents to open every day. Bigger and better than candy canes---but I missed <br/>
him so much! He&#39;d call every day to tell me what Mrs. Claus had sent him!<br/>

Jigsaw puzzles of the U.S. are kind of fun for the size comparison.  You<br/>
can see which pieces fit on top of other pieces.  You can accomplish the<br/>

<br/>
I am pretty much winging it..  I know my instincts are pretty good, <br/>
but sometimes old habits are hard to break.  It&#39;s easy to fall back <br/>
into familar routines.  I&#39;ve been researching and reading and reading <br/>
and learning and listening for several weeks now.  I&#39;ve tried to <br/>
unschool as much as possible with my kids still in school till I got <br/>
all of my ducks in a row with my state regs.  The last few weeks of <br/>
school, the kids basically just showed up to be counted present so <br/>
truancy wasn&#39;t an issue.   They knew the BIG DAY was coming and they <br/>
were so excited.  I think my Dd, Lydia (13) was a little apprehensive <br/>
about giving up routines and &quot;school work&quot;.  She has always succeeded <br/>
in PS and she thrives on structure.   The boys, (Phillip, 7 ,and Cal, <br/>
11) OTOH let it go with wild abandon.  Lydie really struggled with <br/>
the decison to stay at home.  I think she felt a lot of pressure from <br/>
her friends and teachers at school.  But, she decided she wanted to <br/>
give unschooling a try.  Of course, if we can gradually shift our <br/>
whole lives into an unschooling totality, then her going to PS will <br/>
become obsolete.   Are there any other unschoolers who made this <br/>
decision with older children?  How did the transition work out?<br/>

Have him wrap up some stuff in his room or let other kids, and let him guess <br/>

while (mostly slept and watched tv---for about a year). He&#39;s a full-convert <br/>
now (he&#39;ll be 15 next month), and sees all his friends in high school SO <br/>
miserable. He talks with them about it all the time: they think he&#39;ll get no <br/>
education and won&#39;t be successful---they&#39;re brainwashed already! But at the <br/>
same time, they envy his life BIG TIME! Of course HE&#39;S the one who has the <br/>
time to write, direct, and produce the screenplay they&#39;re FINALLY going to <br/>
tape during Christmas vacation!<br/>
<br/>
These kids also HATE their parents right now. They&#39;re constantly grounded or <br/>
punished and are always having things withheld---mostly for not doing some <br/>
school-related thing. They&#39;re trying to get away with something---ANYthing!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT just the &quot;school&quot;/education part of it that&#39;s different. It&#39;s the <br/>
BEING with them.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Duncan (6.5) went to a friend&#39;s house, so Cam and I had the day <br/>
together. We shopped and had lunch. As we ate, I saw a sign for a shop that <br/>
does body-piercing. I asked whether he really wanted anything pierced. (At <br/>
14, he might need a parent there to get it done. He had extra Christmas $$; I <br/>
was there, so...) He said no. &lt;g&gt; But we talked a lot about piercings. And <br/>
tattoos ---illegal in SC; he didn&#39;t know that. That morphed into Blue Laws <br/>
(which SC ALSO has many of), and children&#39;s rights and....we&#39;re back to his <br/>
schooled friends! And how THEIR moms would have NEVER offered piercings! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dropping his brother off at a friend&#39;s...$1<br/>
Three CD&#39;s...$29<br/>
Lunch @ Andy&#39;s...$11<br/>
No body piercings...0<br/>
<br/>
Ability to shop, eat lunch, and chat with a teenager in the middle of a <br/>
&quot;schoolday&quot;---and call it &quot;education&quot;...priceless! <br/>

has too much fun with  his friends at school. Yeah, the academics can <br/>
suck, but he tolerates them.  That is just his choice, and he knows <br/>
he can leave school anytime if he wants.  Maybe that is why he does <br/>
not resent school, because he  knows he has options.  I&#39;ve never told <br/>
him that he couldnt get a tatoo or a body piercing, but he&#39;s never <br/>
shown any interest in one.  If he did, I would say, well, it&#39;s your <br/>
body.. have at it..LOL    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 18 yo left school at 6th grade like Kelly&#39;s.  Completely jibed with <br/>
unschooling as soon as I found it, and he taught me a lot.  He went back in <br/>
the second half of 10th and stayed through the first half of 11th.  (But <br/>
before that he went to college.  &lt;g&gt;)  He went to school for the girls, he <br/>
says.  <br/>
<br/>
We spent a day like that yesterday, kinda.  I was actually spending it with <br/>
the 9 yo (don&#39;t take sensitive 9yo&#39;s to see 8 Crazy Nights, BTW), and we were <br/>
at the mall where my son works.  So we spent time with him in his store, and <br/>
on his break and had fun.  He&#39;s not pierced or tattooed, but works in a place <br/>
with lots of people who are, and sells body jewelry at the store.  <br/>
<br/>
Long ago I told him he couldn&#39;t get pierced or tattooed until he was 18, <br/>
because I didn&#39;t want to be the one he blamed if he didn&#39;t like it or <br/>
regretted it someday.  He did get an earlobe pierced this summer, but let it <br/>
grow back because it hurt too much!  <br/>
<br/>
All this time since he left school (the first time), it seems to me that he <br/>
has been just marking time until he can be and do stuff on his own.  That&#39;s <br/>
not to say that he didn&#39;t learn and do things in these intervening years!  <br/>
It&#39;s just not all what he *wanted* to do.  Everything he&#39;s really *wanted* to <br/>
do has been blocked by driving laws, day time curfews and compulsory <br/>
attendance, and at times he had to live furtively, watching his back.  <br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s really doing it, though.  His goal is to be a &quot;rock star&quot; and we can <br/>
laugh at the cliche, but now he&#39;s in a band and doing auditions with record <br/>
companies and benefit concerts and everything.   Doing what he wants to do, <br/>
with complete freedom (fettered by money, sometimes!)...and we get to claim <br/>
he&#39;s still in high school if it&#39;s convenient!  <br/>

turned 13dd. I love spending time with her. <br/>
<br/>
Can never understand parents who look forward to school or camp or some <br/>
activity so they &quot;won&#39;t have to deal with their teenage children&quot;. This was <br/>
an actual discussion last night at my daughter&#39;s basketball practice. Some of <br/>
the parents were dreading the upcoming school hiatus because they&#39;d have <br/>
&quot;their children at home and have to deal with them more&quot;.  Maybe if they quit <br/>
trying to control them and really spent time with their children they&#39;d know <br/>
how terrific they are?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, your day with Cam sounded similar to our outing last week. Eric 11ds <br/>
was at a friend&#39;s house, so Carly and I went to the mall in Charlottesville. <br/>
This was her big day; she got her ears pierced. Then we had lunch and <br/>
discussed everything. It&#39;s like having lunch with a close girl friend. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t trade that experience with her for the world. <br/>

PS, thanks to all who post on this board; I gain so much from your insight, <br/>
points of view, comments; I&#39;m returning to listening and learning mode.<br/>

concept, and I am willing to learn from anyone willing to offer <br/>
advice or suggestions.  Here&#39;s how our first day went.  You think we <br/>
are on the right track? <br/>
<br/>
I had to get up and take my oldest son to school. He loves school and <br/>
has no desire to stay home.  My dd woke up with her period this <br/>
morning so she had a quiet morning curled up in bed after taking some <br/>
Midol.  My 11 yo ds, after getting up bright and perky at 7:30 am!, <br/>
spent all morning playing on the computer to his hearts content. <br/>
Ususally, I have had to beg plead and bargain with him to get up and <br/>
get ready for school. It was wonderful to see him get up happy this <br/>
morning.  My 7 yo, otoh, slept til almost 10. After he had a bowl of <br/>
oatmeal for breakfast, he said he was ready for school.. LOL  He was <br/>
grinning so  big and he brought me a  book called &quot;What your second <br/>
grader needs to know&quot;  He actually loves that book and he and I took <br/>
turns reading whatever struck his fancy.  This morning he wanted to <br/>
look at maps and try to figure out which state is bigger and <br/>
fartherest away from us. He loves maps and geography.  OH.. <br/>
&lt;interjection&gt;  I saw this interactive globe from Leap Frog while I <br/>
was shopping this weekend.. I know he would love that thing.. Maybe <br/>
Santa can come up with some inventive budgeting to cover it for a <br/>
surprise gift ( since ds doesnt even know the thing exists) OK back <br/>
to our day...I gave the kids an early christmas present of some of <br/>
those velvet posters.  They spent a while coloring those in and <br/>
proudly displaying thier talents.  We had bologna sandwiches for <br/>
lunch and some chex mix and Sundrop.  The boys spent a lot of time <br/>
outside as it was in the upper 60s here today.  We wrapped more <br/>
Christmas presents, each child taking a turn to help wrap the others <br/>
gifts.   Dd had an orthodontist appt at 3, she got green and red <br/>
bands.  Dd asked for cinnamon toast when we got home, and everyone <br/>
decided they wanted some, so I made a pan of cinnamon toast.   Dd <br/>
checked her email and surfed around the net some while the boys spent <br/>
some more time outside jumping on the trampoline.  I had plenty of <br/>
time to sweep the floor, pick up clothes and toys, wash dishes and <br/>
throw in a load of laundry.  All in all, a very good first day of the <br/>
rest of our unschooling lives.   <br/>

while (mostly slept and watched tv---for about a year). He&#39;s a full-convert <br/>
