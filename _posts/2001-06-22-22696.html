<br/>
&quot;Dear Everyone:<br/>
<br/>
As late I have come to realize that one huge advantage <br/>
the=20<br/>
anti-bedsharing camp has against those of us who <br/>
support the parent&#39;s=20<br/>
right to cosleep--are &quot;numbers of deaths&quot; without any <br/>
numbers of how=20<br/>
many infants or children survived cosleeping---and <br/>
numbers of=20<br/>
instances in which the cosleeping (with parental <br/>
presence) might=20<br/>
have actually saved an infant&#39;s life. The only evidence <br/>
that coroners=20<br/>
and forensic pathologists come across, of course, <br/>
failures of the=20<br/>
worst kind, ---which almost always occur in very <br/>
dangerous urban=20<br/>
environments environments. It is easy to understand <br/>
why so many=20<br/>
forensic pathologists have such a bad opinion of <br/>
cosleeping in the=20<br/>
form of &quot;bedsharing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, any infant deaths--whether small or large, <br/>
under any=20<br/>
circumstance are tragic and impressive. What I am <br/>
hoping is that we=20<br/>
in the lactation/infant sleep research fields can begin <br/>
to provide a=20<br/>
different set of numbers. What I have in mind as a <br/>
counter defense=20<br/>
is also anecdotal--but all of the bedsharing death <br/>
statistics that=20<br/>
are making the news likewise are also anecdotal.<br/>
<br/>
So hear is the plan. Any improvements to it--are <br/>
welcome but here goes.<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in hearing and collecting (and <br/>
categorizing) success=20<br/>
stories, especially, numbers of parents who <br/>
successfully co-slept=20<br/>
with any or all of their children, and learning how <br/>
they did it, how=20<br/>
long they did it, why they did it, and, in retrospect, <br/>
what they now=20<br/>
think about it. Moreover, I am also interested in <br/>
knowing--as would=20<br/>
the audiences I speak to and write for---how their <br/>
children sleep now=20<br/>
or, if the case is such, how they sleep as adults or <br/>
teenagers. It=20<br/>
would be important to know if the parents were <br/>
breastfeeding or=20<br/>
not--and whether or not they smoked.<br/>
<br/>
The most important additional question for which I am <br/>
asking your=20<br/>
assistance is in collecting/tracking down stories <br/>
from parents=20<br/>
concerning whether or if by cosleeping, they think that <br/>
they may have=20<br/>
saved their infants life. Through the years, at least <br/>
on 25 times or=20<br/>
so--parents have come up to me after a lecture and said <br/>
that they=20<br/>
felt that if they had not been cosleeping, they are <br/>
sure that their=20<br/>
infant or child would have died., as miost woke up to <br/>
find their=20<br/>
infant choking or turning blue. What would be <br/>
extremely helpful in=20<br/>
these days in which bedsharing and various kinds of <br/>
cosleeping are=20<br/>
getting such a bad name, by such a few number of <br/>
people, is to=20<br/>
provide the &quot;good news&#39;--some good numbers...to be able <br/>
to provide=20<br/>
documented success stories. Do you think you can help <br/>
me?<br/>
<br/>
If you can, what I am asking is for you to use any or <br/>
all of your=20<br/>
resources--and your internet connections/chat rooms or <br/>
whatever, to=20<br/>
collect on line--such stories. I would ask the mother <br/>
or father to=20<br/>
talk about exactly what happened, in as much detail as <br/>
possible,=20<br/>
including th enature of their &quot;beds&quot; and <br/>
characteristics of their=20<br/>
sleep environment or anything they they think was <br/>
important to the=20<br/>
outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Either you could put out some questions in some <br/>
standard=20<br/>
questionnaire out to your own personal network or <br/>
listserv --or=20<br/>
simply that--if there is a story to be told, that <br/>
Professor McKenna=20<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:James.J.McKenna.25@...">James.J.McKenna.25@...</a>) would love to receive it--<br/>
in order to=20<br/>
document. Of course, if any of this is relevant to you, <br/>
too--please=20<br/>
provide your own personal experience too. I will print <br/>
it off my=20<br/>

<h4>Sharon Rudd</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742601064">Dear Tracy<br/>
<br/>
You may forward this on to Dr. McKenna if you think it<br/>
might be useful. I think I answered most of his<br/>
questions.  It is LONG.  I think about this issue a<br/>
lot as there is  occasionally a death I hear of.<br/>
Usually (it seems to me) there is a MISTAKE made that<br/>
could have been avoided with a little thought.  A<br/>
couple of years ago a Navy couple (near where I<br/>
live)lost a child when the father smothered the baby<br/>
by sleeping on a sofa with her.  To me that is a<br/>
special circumstance.  Sofa&#39;s are particular dangerous<br/>
to babies and toddlers, anyway.  All that upholstery<br/>
on three sides, cushions with spaces for little ones<br/>
to get wedged into. Then a Papa who accidently fell<br/>
asleep. There is a short on the local news every few<br/>
months telling parents not to seep with children<br/>
......due to the mistake of this person. As if we<br/>
should ALL feel guilty.<br/>
<br/>
I SLEPT WITH MY CHILDREN AS BABIES AND TODDLERS AND<br/>
EVEN BIGGER<br/>
<br/>
....I have four sons, all breast fed, and all slept<br/>
with me.  Three are adults now, and the youngest is 7.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The oldest (27)is married (7 years) and cohabitates<br/>
(ha!) with his wife. Queen size bed. Hand made quilts.<br/>
<br/>
Second son (25) lives with his girl friend (3 years).<br/>
Queen size bed.  Hand made quilts.<br/>
<br/>
Third son (20) lives in his own place and rents out<br/>
two of the bedrooms to his bachelor friends.  It looks<br/>
like it too!! They have a band. He sleeps in the<br/>
single bed that his Daddy made for him. Hand made<br/>
quilts, too.<br/>
<br/>
The littlest (7) sleeps in his room, usually alone in<br/>
a double bed (the grownups hand-me-down when we got a<br/>
king size) with lots of stuffed animals and pillows,<br/>
hand made quilts,after one or both parents read to<br/>
him.  Mama (me)lays beside him while he falls asleep .<br/>
He chats (sometimes interminably). <br/>
<br/>
I did this for the older boys, too. Sometimes, when I<br/>
am (was)particularly fatigued I fall asleep, too, and<br/>
awaken 1 to 6 hours later and get up.  Once in a while<br/>
I sleep all night. Sometimes the 7 year old<br/>
(now)awakens and comes to climb in (my side of the<br/>
bed) with his parents in the early morning. The older<br/>
boys did, too.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest and youngest have sleep apnea (as do<br/>
Grandparents and the youngest&#39;s Daddy).  It is my<br/>
thought that that may be a source of SIDS......but who<br/>
knows?  Anyway I monitored their sleep and touched<br/>
them to restore breathing when it seems too long<br/>
between breaths, to me.  It has been documented that<br/>
children do adopt the sleep patterns of their mother.<br/>
Unfortunately I am and insomniac. Or perhaps<br/>
fortunately, as I am always alert to the children. Any<br/>
children in the house!! I had custody of a younger<br/>
sister.....who lived with me off and on and slept with<br/>
me from age 6 months. I also have had other children<br/>
stay with me for extended periods of time.  I read to<br/>
all of them (or sang) and let them talk, and stayed by<br/>
them to go to sleep until they seemed to want to be<br/>
alone.  About age 6,7, or 10 or off and on.....each<br/>
one slightly different.  More if a crisis was<br/>
happening (from their point of view).<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER I did find that neither of my husbands (first<br/>
husband is Daddy to the three older boys....second to<br/>
the youngest) was alert to a child in the bed!! ELBOWS<br/>
were the worst hazard.  <br/>
<br/>
They were also not concerned about nudity.  I (it is<br/>
just my opinion as a survivor of sexual abuse) do not<br/>
feel (think) that children of any age should sleep<br/>
with naked adults.  Cuddling is good, sex or any hint<br/>
of it with children is not. The children may<br/>
instinctively want to pursue those inclinations, but<br/>
it is up to the care giver to redirect the behaviors.<br/>
My husbands did not want to give up sleeping nude due<br/>
to my concern for the children.  They preferred for<br/>
the babies to be elsewhere anyway.  So ate sleeping<br/>
arrangements were up to me to fit around everyone&#39;s<br/>
else&#39;s needs.  As it USUALLY is with most things and<br/>
Mamma&#39;s and children.<br/>
<br/>
I feel strongly that little children shouldn&#39;t have to<br/>
be lonely, especially if there is a parent or two, or<br/>
grandparent or responsible sibling or SOMEBODY<br/>
anywhere near. That SOMEBODY in my house,is me.<br/>
<br/>
To deal with the Daddy problem (problem for me, not<br/>
for the Daddy) I stayed awake until EVERYONE was<br/>
asleep, (still do)or in their own beds asleep.  The<br/>
parental bed with the older boys was a double bed..not<br/>
big enough!! With the babies I often just held them<br/>
all night, in a rocker or in the crook of my arm while<br/>
lying down.  But I had to stay awake enough to hold<br/>
onto them. When they were bigger I ended up balanced<br/>
on the side of the children&#39;s beds (mattresses on the<br/>
floor at first) or holding hands with the older and<br/>
huggling (cuddling) the youngest or pushing all the<br/>
beds together and having my arms around<br/>
everybody.....If there was a baby, he got a side all<br/>
to himself as I didn&#39;t trust anyone else to stay alert<br/>
enough for long enough. Youngest son&#39;s Daddy and I<br/>
have a king size bed now......the elbow problem was<br/>
(is) much easier to deal with and siblings were in<br/>
their own rooms in their own beds indulging in the<br/>
things teens like to do. However we had a double bed<br/>
for the first couple of years.  I made a pallet on the<br/>
floor, for myself and the baby, for safety. I was too<br/>
tired to stay awake all night watching out for Daddy&#39;s<br/>
elbow or to keep the baby from falling out of the bed.<br/>
  When he had his own room, (we moved when he was<br/>
almost one) there was matress on the floor (he could<br/>
climb out of a crib as soon as he could pull<br/>
up....about 7 or 8 months...DANGER) The crib was only<br/>
used when he was tiny for me to go to the bathroom or<br/>
change clothes!! With the matress he noticed if he<br/>
fell out, but he wasn&#39;t hurt. He could get up from a<br/>
nap safely. <br/>
<br/>
I traded the crib to my sister-in-law for a wardrobe. <br/>
Her child seep all night from about 2 months...and<br/>
NEVER, even at over 2 years old, climbed out! She had<br/>
and intercom in his room, which was on a different<br/>
floor, even.  Dunno if their power ever went out.<br/>
Maybe it was battery powered.  He never slept in the<br/>
parental bed.  She attempted to breastfeed,<br/>
unsuccessfully.  Perhaps not related to sleeping<br/>
arrangements. They have two older children from my<br/>
brother&#39;s first marraige.  One of which stayed with me<br/>
when she was little (1 year old).<br/>
<br/>
I either sat up or slept with all of my children when<br/>
they were ill.  Each has been ill with respiratory<br/>
flue, one had pneumonia, all had asthma reactions to<br/>
flue, third son had an intasaseption, two have sleep<br/>
apnea, then there were the ordinary things....chicken<br/>
pox (yuck) allergies (stuffy heads, can&#39;t breathe)<br/>
vomiting, fevers, diarrhea etc, etc.  How can a parent<br/>
keep track of these things in another room? WHAT IF? <br/>
A child could easily aspirate regurgitated yuck.  Who<br/>
knows WHAT would have happened if I wasn&#39;t right<br/>
there?  <br/>
<br/>
I baby in the bed is sort of like a leaky hot water<br/>
bottle!! (not my analogy but I like it) Daddy&#39;s seem<br/>
more disturbed by the leakiness than I was.  But with<br/>
the first three sons, the house was COLD. (the toilet<br/>
was frozen.  My fish bowl froze solid).  Even with<br/>
footed sleepers and snow suits, I felt that the babies<br/>
needed ME to make sure they were warm in the winter (I<br/>
did NOT use disposable diapers)....and not too hot in<br/>
the HOT summers or with fevers.  Cool cloths, fanning,<br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My little sister used to pull the covers over her head<br/>
to keep warm.  She never did learn to leave a<br/>
breathing hole!  I had to do that for her.  As she was<br/>
a BIG girl when I got permanent custody of her I would<br/>
go into her room and uncover her face.  As she<br/>
realized her face was uncovered she would pull the<br/>
covers up some more, exposing her feet.....then get a<br/>
little more chilled and pull them up some more,<br/>
uncovering her legs!! and get more chilled.....till I<br/>
covered her again.  More cover and a night-cap (hat)<br/>
didn&#39;t help.  Then she would get too hot and kick<br/>
everything off and get cold again. She has been<br/>
married (with 3 children) for 20 years now, has a<br/>
queen size bed. She slept with me until I had lovers. <br/>
I did not want to share that aspect of my life with<br/>
her. (ha!) She did not sleep with my babies.  She was<br/>
one of those all elbow and knee everywhere type of big<br/>
kids. And she might have suffocated them with the<br/>
covers pulled up too high or ?????  She didn&#39;t sleep<br/>
in the bed with her babies either.  And they all slept<br/>
through the night from about 3 weeks (WOW).<br/>
<br/>
My boys don&#39;t have children yet.  Dunno if they will.<br/>
They older three think it may be more than they want<br/>
to bother with....it is a lot of that!! And I&#39;m glad<br/>
that they acknowledge what they prefer to do with<br/>
their time.  An ignored child is so sad. <br/>
<br/>
My husband has adult adopted kids of his first wife<br/>
(her natural children).  She NEVER slept with the<br/>
children. Put them in bed, let them cry. Their<br/>
daughter, now has two children.  She belongs to the<br/>
Put Them In Bed And Let Them Cry School, too. The<br/>
adult son (Air Force) has two children.  His family is<br/>
also of that method.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the heart for Put Them In Bed And Let<br/>
Them Cry.  Even Dr. Spock disagrees with himself on<br/>
that! <br/>
<br/>
Hope this is useful.  <br/>
<br/>
Sharon   Oh.......and I don&#39;t smoke.  And nobody else<br/>
ever smoked in the house. How is this realted?<br/>

Sharon, I didn&#39;t read most of this, just posted it to <br/>
the addy at the bottom of the message I forwarded.  But <br/>
I did notice this bit, basically the risk of SIDS is <br/>
much higher for babies whose parents smoke, and <br/>
especially smoke and co-sleep.  I was at a conference <br/>
session where the results of research into SIDS were <br/>
presented, I posted a summary of the resutls on a web-<br/>
page but can&#39;t find the link right now :-(  I&#39;ll <br/>
forward it on if I find it, or maybe someone else out <br/>
there has it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68424657">Dear Tracy.....Thanks again   My DH is a former<br/>
smoker. The sediments (deposits or whatever it is<br/>
called)within his lungs are still not cleared out<br/>
(x-rays to the contrary). Don&#39;t think they ever will<br/>
be. I suspect some physiologic changes are permanent.<br/>
Nicotene is a pretty heavy duty muscle relaxer so it<br/>
does seem that it would have an influence on SIDS,<br/>
especially with infants who tend to sleep too deeply<br/>
to rouse when they do pause in breathing. &#39;course this<br/>
ain&#39;t nothin&#39; new to you. <br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t realize that Dr. McKenna&#39;s study was actually<br/>
SIDs.  Thought it was more the social/anthropoligical<br/>
aspects of co-sleeping and safety.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for clarification, Sharon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040508473">Dear Tracy.....Thanks again My DH is a former<br/>
smoker. The sediments (deposits or whatever it is<br/>
called)within his lungs are still not cleared out<br/>
(x-rays to the contrary). Don&#39;t think they ever will<br/>
be. I suspect some physiologic changes are permanent.<br/>
Nicotene is a pretty heavy duty muscle relaxer so it<br/>
does seem that it would have an influence on SIDS,<br/>
especially with infants who tend to sleep too deeply<br/>
to rouse when they do pause in breathing. &#39;course this<br/>
ain&#39;t nothin&#39; new to you. <br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t realize that Dr. McKenna&#39;s study was actually<br/>
SIDs. Thought it was more the social/anthropoligical<br/>
aspects of co-sleeping and safety.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for clarification, Sharon<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it is, though probably with McKenna&#39;s <br/>
background you&#39;re probably right, it&#39;s just that the <br/>
question about smoking could be to do with SIDS or <br/>
perhaps it&#39;s to do with whether the message that <br/>
parents who smoke put their babies at risk even when <br/>
they&#39;re not actually smoking is getting out...<br/>
