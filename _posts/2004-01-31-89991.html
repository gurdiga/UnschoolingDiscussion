<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593624228">Hi. The girls (age 8) rented Harvest Moon this week and are having fun but not making much &quot;progress&quot; which is making them a little disapointed. They have just had  their Playstation 2 since Xmas. Anyone have kids who might help them with a few tips? mainly about how to get some money to buy  seeds I think. I  googled one site for cheats but didnt get a lot that was useful for them at this stage. My e-mail is  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pennacres@...">pennacres@...</a> .<br/>
Also it looks like an interesting game  to buy- Do any of you have kids that like to play it a lot?<br/>
ps I dont play but I can relay it to them if  is isn&#39;t too hard for &quot;an ole lady&quot;. thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-813681851">Holly has played Harvest Moon for Super, Playstation and original gameboy, <br/>
but not gameboy advanced.  She&#39;s in the midst of a Super game at the moment.  <br/>
She tried to play the 64 game but it was before she could read, so she&#39;s <br/>
planning to try that again now that she has the 64 in her room.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But about the Playstation version she says this:<br/>
<br/>
There are berries you can pick by the pond where the goddess comes up.  And <br/>
there are little yellow flowers that you can sell to the flower shop and you <br/>
can sell the berries to the grocery store.  Blueberries or the yellow/orange <br/>
berries.<br/>
<br/>
We have an owned game and there was a booklet with it where you can look up <br/>
who likes what, who hangs out where, when the festivals are, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for cheats or walkthroughs, look for &quot;save the homeland&quot; so <br/>
it will be particularly that game. <br/>
<br/>
If you dig in your farm, in the garden area, just dig sometimes with your hoe <br/>
and there will be rocks you can sell at Louie&#39;s Tool Shop.  Sometimes there <br/>
will be gold in the ground there too.<br/>
<br/>
You can do a job for money (and eventually earn a horse if you do it long <br/>
enough) at Brownie&#39;s Farm.  Go up to Bob (a scary looking guy) first thing in the <br/>
morning, and say that you want to do volunteer work.   Brush the horses and <br/>
milk the cow.  You get to save the milk, which you can sell, and depending how <br/>
long you stay at the farm, he will give you some money.  Just run around and <br/>
stay there a while and he&#39;ll give you more money.  When you want to go, just go <br/>
up the hill.   (I&#39;m typing what Holly says.)<br/>
<br/>
Almost any of the plants you can see you can pick up and sell somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something you can&#39;t sell and that&#39;s grass, but you can feed it to <br/>
your dog.<br/>
<br/>
Just put food in the dish by your front door, and grass will work, and after <br/>
a while if you chase a dog around it will let you pick it up.  At first when <br/>
you chase them they&#39;ll run away, but if you keep putting food out every day and <br/>
don&#39;t chase the dog every day, then one will let you pick it up after while.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing to look for is &quot;walkthrough.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471653314">Thanks Holly and  Sandra-printed  your post  out for them <br/>
found a &quot;walkthrough&quot;- spent  the last half hour reading it to them and answering questions.-they dont read  well enough to get all the info straight-but are off again-<br/>
my god-do kids really  do all that!!!!   :-)  their Mom did; and I couldn&#39;t believe it then...<br/>
No wonder they  &quot;don&#39;t have time to go to school&quot; :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663385217">My child does not play, but I do.  I have every version of Harvest Moon that <br/>
has come out.  For my 40th bday, I even recieved a GameBoy SP so I would be <br/>
ready when the Game Boy Advanced version came out.  I am waiting very <br/>
impatiently for the Game Cube version to come out in March.<br/>
<br/>
Now for ways to get money. Start by going to the store and buying an egg.  <br/>
Take it home and put it in the incubater and in 4 days (game days) you will have <br/>
a chicken.  Also each season you can forage for things in the forest, like <br/>
mushrooms, berries, and medicinal herbs.  Put these in your produce bin and you <br/>
will get money everyday.  On this version you can also go to the guy who runs <br/>
the stable and get part time work.  That will give you some extra cash.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and you should buy it,<br/>

&lt;&lt; Try googling “Harvest Moon Playstation Cheats”. Works for other games. I’m<br/>
<br/>
assuming Harvest Moon is a game.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is, but it&#39;s the kind of game that needs a walkthrough.<br/>
Cheats give you more of this or that, they&#39;re programmer&#39;s codes that affect <br/>
your power, or the timer, or something (classically, generally) but for a game <br/>
that&#39;s a long story with various things to do along the way, what people need <br/>
is more like a tour guide, and a schedule/calendar and a map (in various <br/>
forms).<br/>
