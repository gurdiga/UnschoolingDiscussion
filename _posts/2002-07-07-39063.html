<div id="ygrps-yiv-105362138">As a lover of the English language, as well as kids and learning, I have<br/>
to jump into this one. Philosophically, I agree with what Mary said very<br/>
well:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Teaching to me is a role we all play. Learning is a growth process. My son<br/>
 </span></blockquote>loves to teach me how to scooter. He shows me how to put on a helmet, to<br/>
raise<br/>
my handle bars, to start and stop. He shows me just how to go off a<br/>
curb, to<br/>
twirl and pop wheelies. I know these things already. I have learned<br/>
them. He<br/>
gets great joy showing me all the fine details he himself has learned.<br/>
He is<br/>
practicing being an expert and someone who can explain an activity to<br/>
another<br/>
person. We all learn, we all get taught things from others and we all<br/>
teach<br/>
when asked. A goal of unschooling my kids is to show them to believe in<br/>
themselves and everyone they interact with. We all have something<br/>
valuable to<br/>
share. I hope they learn this. <br/>
Mary &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids and myself, we all think we &quot;learn&quot; things even more deeply when<br/>
we try to explain it or show it to someone else so they can enjoy it or<br/>
do it or understand what we mean, too. And it is a natural human process<br/>
that works both ways. Only with a structured school society does<br/>
teaching mean from adult &quot;person with the power&quot; to child and not vice<br/>
versa. I would sorely miss it if I didn&#39;t have the chance to learn<br/>
things from my kids and other kids. And they have fun teaching me. It is<br/>
delightful as each person has their own unique viewpoint and insights.<br/>
Sadly that is what we lose when &quot;mass teaching&quot; occurs. THe information<br/>
and ideas flow only in one direction and that always will jam up and<br/>
build resistance, or sheep, eventually.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Words may have one connotation to one person and a different connotation<br/>
to another person. Both are valid as connotations. Since &quot;raise<br/>
yourself&#39; cannot be said any other way by the structure of Spanish,<br/>
talking about whether it was done with enforcement and domination were<br/>
used or a laissez faire attitude that encouraged self-discovery, the<br/>
differentiation between these would have to be made using other words. I<br/>
understand Liza&#39;s response that &quot;teaching yourself&quot; is a good thing. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I understand you meant to point out the philosophical difference<br/>
&gt;between  *teach* and *learn*. Nevertheless, I particularly like the<br/>
&gt;authority reversal of my kids being their own teachers as opposed to<br/>
&gt;somebody else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I first read this thread, I thought to myself &quot;oh, teach oneself&quot;<br/>
would be better than just &quot;learning&quot; as to me it emphasizes that concept<br/>
that I decide WHAT and HOW and HOW MUCH I learn. Whereas &quot;learning&quot; to<br/>
me implies &quot;following a track or furrow&quot; (that someone else put there)<br/>
since that is its derivation. My parents used to ask me what I was<br/>
&quot;learning&quot; in school or if I had or hadn&#39;t &quot;learned&quot; something<br/>
worthwhile when doing  a thing. So to me that word has had less of an<br/>
&quot;infinite possibilities&quot; connotation. I can see both views of it, and it<br/>
can have both of these ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the development and meanings of the words one can see that it<br/>
really isn&#39;t fixed one way or the other, and just depends on which<br/>
meaning you choose to use. So a discussion of ways to relate to your<br/>
kids and how they relate to the world and things they are learning may<br/>
be more helpful to expand someone&#39;s understanding of how to do<br/>
unschooling than limiting the meaning of a word to one connotation. I<br/>
appreciate finding out someone&#39;s idea of it, but if I think &quot;learning&quot;<br/>
is going down a furrow made by others, and you tell me that that is the<br/>
best thing to do, it might come out different for me than what you had<br/>
in mind at all. Clarifying what each person is trying to say without<br/>
limiting the words may be most helpful.<br/>
<br/>
The roots of the word &quot;teach&quot; go way back before an &quot;enforced school&quot;<br/>
situation was entrenched in our society (and I myself have been so far<br/>
away from the established schools and that mindset for so long that I<br/>
forgot that it could be the only way some see &quot;teaching&quot;). The roots of<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; go ultimately back to &quot;to show&quot; in Proto-Germanic. (Warning: I<br/>
love languages, the roots of our English language, and learning about<br/>
the mindsets demonstrated by different words and languages. I personally<br/>
keep pursuing knowledge in this field. You can stop reading at this<br/>
point if you wish to avoid this!) &quot;Teach&quot; is also related to &quot;token&quot;<br/>
which, before it came to be used for a &quot;stamped metal piece&quot; in about<br/>
1598, meant a sign, evidence, symbol, wonder, miracle (as in Beowulf,<br/>
725 AD). Not too pedantic or dry a word. IT was the showing of something<br/>
special, perhaps miracles! A demonstration of perhaps supernatural<br/>
ability -- and my kids can teach me the miracle of their viewpoints<br/>
anytime! So can any person actually - everyone here in fact. (I<br/>
appreciate it when it is miraculous!;)) <br/>
<br/>
Definitions of &quot;teach&quot; from the Encarta World English Dictionary<br/>
include:<br/>
<br/>
1.verb transitive - To impart knowledge or skill to somebody by<br/>
instruction or example. (Hmm... example is good; I learn by example all<br/>
the time and my kids wanted to see others with skill perform whenever<br/>
available. we went to rodeos, theatrical shows, pizza flipping<br/>
demonstrations, Russian speaking people, animal training shows,<br/>
storytelling concerts, etc, etc including any kind of good<br/>
puzzle-solvers and thinkers too.)<br/>
<br/>
2. verb intransitive - to give lessons in a subject, or to give lessons<br/>
to a person or animal (yucckk! This sounds like the lessons are given<br/>
whether the person or &quot;animal&quot; wishes it or not or has anything useful<br/>
he wants to do with it or not).<br/>
<br/>
3.verb transitive - To bring understanding to somebody, especially<br/>
through an experience. (Yeah, we like experiences form which we learn<br/>
something, or we each us something. DOn&#39;t want to waste time with<br/>
experiences which don&#39;t teach us something useful or enjoyable.)<br/>
<br/>
4. verb intransitive -To engage in imparting knowledge or instruction<br/>
for a period of time in a particular place &quot; he teaches college&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to say that receiving input is valid as a learning process. I<br/>
don&#39;t appreciate programmed enforced teaching, but as Mary said there is<br/>
teaching going on all the time. The word doesn&#39;t intrinsically mean to<br/>
dominate or enforce something. If our kids have never been in a school<br/>
or not for a long long time, why keep that connotation of the word? If<br/>
it means that for you, it does. If it means other things to you, that&#39;s<br/>
valid too. And the way, the spirit in which you do it is more important<br/>
than the term. Wouldn&#39;t you let your child go visit with a grandparent<br/>
who is an awesome fisherman who&#39;ll teach him stuff about fishing if he<br/>
wants to learn it? Or would he have to figure it all out for himself<br/>
without any help or input, even if he wanted to go with Grandpa?<br/>
<br/>
A brief linguistic &#39;treatise&#39; on &quot;learn&quot; - &quot;Learn&quot; is used both as an<br/>
intransitive verb and a transitive verb in the dictionary. <br/>
<br/>
1. verb intransitive - To come to know something, acquire knowledge of a<br/>
subject or  skill through education or experience. (I am learning to<br/>
play piano or I am learning all the time.)<br/>
<br/>
2. verb intransitive - To gain information about somebody or something.<br/>
(I just learned that Jim is arriving tomorrow.)<br/>
<br/>
3. verb transitive - To memorize something, e.g., facts, poem, a piece<br/>
of music, or a dance. (I learned the hokey-pokey.)<br/>
<br/>
4.  verb intransitive - To teach somebody something (non-standard). (A<br/>
la Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn: &quot;He learned me how to write.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;learned&quot; means &quot;well-educated and very knowledgeable&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Note: The Encarta World Dictionary also says that the underlying idea of<br/>
&quot;learn&quot; from its derivation &quot;track&quot; is to &quot;follow a course of<br/>
instruction&quot;. &quot;Learn&quot; comes also from Proto-Germanic root, the same root<br/>
that formed into the Modern German words &quot;lernen&quot; meaning to study or<br/>
learn and &quot;lehre&quot; meaning rule, doctrine, system, science, lesson,<br/>
warning,and as a verb - to teach, instruct or show. And &quot;Lehrer&quot; meaning<br/>
teacher, master, boss and related words.<br/>
<br/>
So, it depends really on you are trying to express, rather than one word<br/>
meaning inherently what you are trying to say and another always<br/>
expressing something else, not as good, by definition. DOn&#39;t expect all<br/>
others to share your connotations. This discussion is so valuable<br/>
because we all are trying to handle our own circumstances and can ask<br/>
questions and share ideas and experiences that can give others new<br/>
insights. But I wouldn&#39;t say one word or the other inherently mean &quot;the<br/>
bad&quot; thing to do. I&#39;m new to this list and maybe ai am stepping on toes<br/>
here of people I don&#39;t even know. It seemed like an interesting<br/>
discussion and I hope what I have added to it isn&#39;t distasteful. I<br/>
really hate schools, public schools in particular, and the warehousing<br/>
of kids. THe teacher texts I have seen are so full of psychology terms<br/>
like &quot;operand and operand&quot;, it is a no wonder that trained teachers<br/>
haven&#39;t a clue what they are doing. But I have always enjoyed learning<br/>
from an insightful friendly individual who knows more than I do in an<br/>
area I am interested in. I don&#39;t think kids&#39; learning is really much<br/>
different than that. There&#39;s some learning you do on your own and some<br/>
you do with others..... Man is a social being who likes to live in<br/>
groups. <br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to comment on the Sunday school teacher who thought the<br/>
boy needed to be like the other kids ......... what an idiot. &#39;Nuff<br/>
said. Is your son getting enough out of the Sunday school class in his<br/>
opinion to be worth the negative aspects of the class and teacher?<br/>
Sometimes there is enough to put up with the junk. If not, is there an<br/>
alternative to satisfy your family&#39;s reasons for taking the class? <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that people are talking about unschooling meaning letting<br/>
your child learn what and as he wants without limiting him (or her) to<br/>
learning what and how someone else wants him to. Is that right? And we<br/>
as parents learning to let go and not interfering with that. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; this is something I&#39;m really trying to grip myself!  Granted, we have only been unschooling for a very short while, but the more we do, the more dh relaxes, and the better things flow (I&#39;m the one whose dh really wanted a school-at-home atmosphere). But I&#39;m still running into all kinds of unexpected snags, even though I am a staunch supporter of all the things you&#39;ve mentioned above.  I am continually berating myself for not unschooling properly!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that &quot;learning to work with a group&quot; would be a normal<br/>
desired part of anyone&#39;s growing up, - such as learning to sail with a<br/>
crew, learning to play baseball as a team, learning to exchange things<br/>
of value with others and work together on a project or business,<br/>
learning to get along as a family and contribute to its survival. On<br/>
other hand, this society is so far off the rails with control by<br/>
power-hungry people and psychological tools employed to achieve that,<br/>
and just general personal aberration,  that we do have to be wary of<br/>
putting our kids in group situations where someone who doesn&#39;t respect<br/>
the rights of others may have undue influence. &quot;Teaching&quot; our kids that<br/>
character in the face of pressure matters, that we can maintain our<br/>
individuality and survival and how some have succeeded in that, and how<br/>
to approach interpersonal problems when one decides to stay in a group<br/>
where there are some (pretty much any human group!) - those are all<br/>
things to discuss with our kids as they get older especially. And hold<br/>
up some good examples, or read some good stories where characters dealt<br/>
with such things for ideas of what people do.<br/>
<br/>
To me the actual learning of things a kid wants to do is pretty easy and<br/>
natural. It&#39;s where we come head to head with others and how to sort<br/>
that out and manage to survive as individuals and also as a groups, and<br/>
as mankind all together, that is the trick .... <br/>
 I let my daughter just stay home so she wouldn&#39;t have to deal with a<br/>
lot of *** so young. BUt as the kids get a little older, there it is to<br/>
handle. They&#39;ll form our society when we are old, and let&#39;s hope we&#39;ve<br/>
helped them do better for themselves, and for us as a whole race.<br/>
<br/>
oh my gosh! I am on a mountain-high soapbox and don&#39;t know how to get<br/>
down..!! Help!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Whereas &quot;learning&quot; to<br/>
me implies &quot;following a track or furrow&quot; (that someone else put there)<br/>
since that is its derivation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t just look at the Indo European roots and say the first one listed <br/>
is &quot;its derivation.  Under Germanic-to-English (in American Heritage) it <br/>
lists &quot;lore&quot; which is knowledge.  That&#39;s the origin given in the Oxford <br/>
English Dictionary.   And another type of meaning in the various <br/>
re-constructed Indo-European roots has to do with footprints or tracks in <br/>
THAT way--a path.<br/>
<br/>
The origin of the word for &quot;book&quot; had to do with a stick, but when someone <br/>
uses the word book, it doesn&#39;t imply &quot;stick.&quot;<br/>
