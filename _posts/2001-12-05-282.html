start.  It seems so many of the games have so many levels, so much add on<br/>

 </span></blockquote>D&D is one of the cheapest, because you don&#39;t really have to have the books <br/>
if you don&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
There are other more self-contained games that can be played with two <br/>
players, in the category of &quot;collectable card games&quot; or CCGs--Pokemon, Magic, <br/>
Legend of Five Rings, 7th Sea, Warlord, Doom Town.  Those can be more <br/>
expensive, but can also be played with alone (insofar as arranging decks and <br/>
looking at card art can take hours), and definitely with two people.  D&D <br/>
takes more people, but less stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There are websites which discuss the particular games.<br/>
<br/>
What town are you in?  Maybe someone here (or the teenaged boy of someone <br/>
here) could help you find a gaming shop in your area.  Gaming shops often <br/>
have tables and chairs where kids hang out for hours and learn the games, and <br/>
get regular repeat games going, either on the store&#39;s schedule or their own.  <br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to interest the Bible School group in D&D, it would be more <br/>
efficient to find existing D&D players, I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
<br/>
There are also online games sometimes.  My boys are in a long running one on <br/>
AOL which is a marvel in a good season (week/month) and an irritation to them <br/>
other times, but they &quot;live&quot; there sometimes just as they&#39;re sometimes in the <br/>
SCA.  It&#39;s a soap opera in which they have speaking, improvisational parts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-694843299">The only CCG that I can recall seeing that might be acceptable to the locals<br/>
is one based on some sport - basketball or baseball, I think?  I saw it at<br/>
the Wizards of the Coast store, so if you don&#39;t have a shop near you, it&#39;d<br/>
be easy to get online.<br/>
Also, I heard somewhere that there is a website devoted to Magic, the<br/>
gathering where you make up a deck online and play there too.  Might be a<br/>
good way to get your feet wet with the game while you&#39;re figuring it out.<br/>
Sorry I don&#39;t know the url.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516873850">Hmmm, how old are your kids?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing all the RPG&#39;s out there for years. I&#39;m an addict *G*.<br/>
I&#39;ve got the kids at my church addicted. Thank gods for UU&#39;s<br/>
