<div id="ygrps-yiv-502145699">I have been having some major sibling related issues that I am hoping those of you could give me some insight on.  Basically, there is intense competition with my 6 & 7 year old - did and ds. A an example - yesterday we were making a volcano - and they both fought and argued over who would do what, go first etc. They do a lot of name calling to each other - and purposely doing or saying things that will aggravate the other. My usual course of action has been to separate them when they get like this - and have them do something away from each other - we talk about this afterward and often they will then treat each other nicely for a little while. <br/>
<br/>
However, inevitably something comes up again. We had just been playing clue Jr. My daughter will bring out a game and then say - I only want YOU to play with me. This is hard, because I want to respect that about her - but then my son is crying that he wants to play. If I play with her and then play with my son - she has a fit that she then wants to play....<br/>
<br/>
I have thought that maybe this is caused by a need for attention thing - and do try and take them out one on one - so that each gets a little individual time.<br/>
<br/>
But what bothers me a lot is the name calling and just over all meanness to one another. The problem gets worse because it irritates me so much that I wind up getting angry and irritated about it all - that I just don&#39;t want to do whatever it was because of the fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my daughter will want to play with one of my sons toys - and she will ask :&quot;nicely&quot; and he will say &quot;No&quot; - for whatever reason. She will then pitch. On the one hand I feel that he should be allowed to say &quot;No&quot; if someone asks to play with something and he doesn&#39;t want them to. But sometimes he will say No - just to bug her - or she will go at  his toys just to bother him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I was hoping for some suggestions here. When everyone is calm and we talk about name calling and being nice vs. being mean they all seem to understand. <br/>

the children always unschooled or did they attend<br/>
traditional schooling?  Did you do school at home? <br/>
Have they attend daycare or preschool?  Or always been<br/>
at home with you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832248833">&lt;&lt;I have been having some major sibling related issues that I am hoping<br/>
those of you could give me some insight on.  Basically, there is intense<br/>
competition with my 6 & 7 year old - did and ds. A an example - yesterday we<br/>
were making a volcano - and they both fought and argued over who would do<br/>
what, go first etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From the time my kids were really small, we always had them take turns when<br/>
it was something important to them.  And we kept track of whose turn it was<br/>
to go first with something fun.  It solved a lot of potential problems<br/>
because they knew we were trying to be fair.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They do a lot of name calling to each other - and purposely doing or<br/>
saying things that will aggravate the other.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is name calling something that you model in your family?  My kids don&#39;t<br/>
generally call each other unkind names and the first time they might have<br/>
done it, I am sure I was all over them like flies on dung.  Name calling is<br/>
unkind and it doesn&#39;t solve anything.  I would say something similar and<br/>
then get to the root of the problem.  Help them to express their frustration<br/>
with each other (perhaps out of earshot of each other if it is too unkind)<br/>
and then help them to phrase it in a way that is productive and kind.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;My usual course of action has been to separate them when they get like<br/>
this - and have them do something away from each other - we talk about this<br/>
afterward and often they will then treat each other nicely for a little<br/>
while. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is a short term solution, not a long term one.  Helping them to<br/>
verbalize how they feel to each other esp. before they are completely<br/>
frustrated would be better.  Perhaps you need to be nearer to them during<br/>
their play so you can help them communicate.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;However, inevitably something comes up again. We had just been playing<br/>
clue Jr. My daughter will bring out a game and then say - I only want YOU to<br/>
play with me. This is hard, because I want to respect that about her - but<br/>
then my son is crying that he wants to play. If I play with her and then<br/>
play with my son - she has a fit that she then wants to play....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is hard and we have this issue now and then but it usually only happens<br/>
when they are frustrated with each other to begin with.  I don&#39;t have any<br/>
hard fast rule concerning this and I play it by ear.  Sometimes I refuse to<br/>
play at all unless everyone is included and I try to help them find more<br/>
solitary things to do until they are less frustrated with each other.  Other<br/>
times they are happy to know that when I am done playing with one of them, I<br/>
will happily oblige the other one with the activity of their choice, alone<br/>
with me.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have thought that maybe this is caused by a need for attention thing -<br/>
and do try and take them out one on one - so that each gets a little<br/>
individual time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say it is caused by a need for attention.  But time spent<br/>
individually with them doesn&#39;t need to be time away from home.  You can<br/>
spend individual time with each of them throughout the day in different<br/>
ways.  My older dd gets up first and often enjoys sitting down to play a<br/>
game more than her younger sister.  We have these times together to connect.<br/>
My younger dd loves to snuggle in bed and in the morning when I wake her<br/>
(because she wants to be woken at a certain time) we are able to spend a few<br/>
minutes connecting and cuddling in bed before she starts her day.  There are<br/>
also other times during the day when I can see their need for connection and<br/>
I can meet those needs without alienating the other child.  But often,<br/>
sitting down together meets the need too.  Time spent on the couch with each<br/>
child on one side of me while I read to them helps a lot too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But what bothers me a lot is the name calling and just over all meanness<br/>
to one another. The problem gets worse because it irritates me so much that<br/>
I wind up getting angry and irritated about it all - that I just don&#39;t want<br/>
to do whatever it was because of the fighting.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would just be matter of fact about it.  Would you let a stranger come into<br/>
your home and call your kids&#39; names or would you protect them?  It is no<br/>
different when it is their siblings.  They each deserve to be protected from<br/>
unkindness and I would not stand by and allow that to happen.  But like I<br/>
said before, it is always about communication and if you help them<br/>
communicate, it won&#39;t get to name calling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes my daughter will want to play with one of my sons toys - and she<br/>
will ask :&quot;nicely&quot; and he will say &quot;No&quot; - for whatever reason. She will then<br/>
pitch. On the one hand I feel that he should be allowed to say &quot;No&quot; if<br/>
someone asks to play with something and he doesn&#39;t want them to. But<br/>
sometimes he will say No - just to bug her - or she will go at  his toys<br/>
just to bother him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he is saying no, just to bug her, I suspect he isn&#39;t feeling like she has<br/>
been very generous lately.  Maybe you could address that.  <br/>
