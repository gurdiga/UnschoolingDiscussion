&quot;homeschool leader&quot; &lt;g&gt;) a month&#39;s free rentals.....They are doing a superb <br/>
job of sending out the DVDs (with the return, pp, envelopes) ASAP.  <br/>
Currently, we&#39;re engrossed in &quot;The Life of Birds&quot;, and about to embark on a <br/>
Sister Wendy fest. <br/>
<br/>
But, at $25 a month, and three days travel time from California to Iowa, I&#39;m <br/>
not sure we&#39;d come out &quot;ahead&quot; on the rentals.  We simply cannot get a fast <br/>
enough turn-around time. <br/>
<br/>
But, if you&#39;re interested....<br/>

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are <br/>
to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and <br/>
servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>
