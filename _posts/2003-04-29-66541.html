I think some of the group members do not check their email like we do so you <br/>
are still getting people posting from the first few posts.<br/>

It&#39;s okay to let some responses just sit there without responding. <br/>
It&#39;s a zen thing. Quiet reflection. Just let the answers sit without <br/>
responding or doing anything about them. Try it. Things will make <br/>
more sense after they have a chance to just *be* for awhile.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
