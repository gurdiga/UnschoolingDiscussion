<div id="ygrps-yiv-352975307">It has been nearly two years since I stopped limiting TV.<br/>
<br/>
I have to share what happened tonight.  It isn&#39;t the first time it happened either.  I was so tired after dinner that *I* suggested we watch a movie.  (Usually it is someone else suggesting that.)  My 8 year old said please can&#39;t we play a game instead!  This is a child who can watch TV whenever she wishes.  When the entire family is home, she is much more likely to vote for playing a game than watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
So we played yahtzee.  When one child got a yahtzee, the other joined her in dancing for joy.  Everyone was cheering when someone had a good turn and saying &quot;oh too bad&quot; but in a nice way when the roles weren&#39;t so great.  And I won!  I can&#39;t remember the last time I won at Yahtzee.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t mean to suggest that playing a game is always better than watching TV.  I just wanted to put this out for those who are new to the idea of not limiting TV.  It is one more example of a kid who does not have TV limits and does choose to do other things besides watch TV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462427890">Just another comment or two on the limiting topic...I just never had any<br/>
limits on much of anything and so my children never learned to think that<br/>
something was better than something else.  Like cake vs. carrots at dinner<br/>
or games vs. TV for recreation.  I never limited anything to make something<br/>
else look better. &quot;If you don&#39;t eat those carrots, you can&#39;t have the cake.&quot;<br/>
In fact, when they were very small and noticed that I was making something<br/>
yummy and got excited, I&#39;d put it right on their plate with the meat and<br/>
potatoes.  Sometimes they would eat the cake first and then the meat.  I<br/>
wanted them to see/understand that sometimes you want to eat cake and<br/>
sometimes you want the steak.  Sometimes you want to read a book and<br/>
sometimes you want to watch TV.  Sometimes you want to ride your bike and<br/>
sometimes you want to stay in and color.  Neither choice is neccessarily<br/>
&quot;bad&quot; and your particular behavior doesn&#39;t make one thing better than<br/>
another.  My husband has stories of falling asleep at the table because he<br/>
didn&#39;t finish his dinner and couldn&#39;t get down until he had done so.  His<br/>
mom tries to withhold dessert from our kids if they don&#39;t &quot;clean their<br/>
plate.&quot;  I always override and &quot;spoil&quot; the kids! Geesh!<br/>
