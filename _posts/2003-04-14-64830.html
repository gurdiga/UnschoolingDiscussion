<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007043180">we&#39;re planning baby number 4 but DH is fretting about the age gap. He reckons having a baby will stop us doing interesting things with the other 3 and will interfere with their &#39;learning&#39;.<br/>
(I don&#39;t think he&#39; yet figured out that we don&#39;t do work books...)<br/>
<br/>
The gap between the babe and my youngest will be 8 years.<br/>
eeeep, I must be nuts, back to nappies and spew-up ;-)<br/>

independent Cameron was at that age. <br/>

Tara had been an only child for a long time. She was 9 when Joseph was born.<br/>
It was the most wonderful thing ever. I absolutely loved the baby days all<br/>
over again. It had been much too long. Tara was thrilled with her baby<br/>
brother. She was at a great age to be a big sister. We were all enjoying<br/>
Joseph like crazy. Must have lost our minds in the moment, Sierra was born<br/>
13 months later!! (minus 2 days) I had my hands full but it was the<br/>
greatest. Alyssa came when the others were 15, 6 and 5. It was a good time.<br/>
They were old enough to manage some on their own, not jealous at all and<br/>
also very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Alyssa is 2 and a half now and I would love to have another one. Not sure I<br/>
could go it again physically. If I had the money I&#39;d find a surrogate or<br/>
even adopt. If you get pregnant, I want to hear all about it. I&#39;ll live<br/>
vicariously through you!<br/>

instincts kicked in then (she was the 12 year old) and she wanted nothing<br/>
more than to be a mother after that.  When she was around, I only got Lars<br/>
when he was hungry.  She even changed dirty diapers.  She thought she waited<br/>
a long time after that to become a mother, 7 years.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Well Tara never did the dirty diaper thing. She was a great big sister,<br/>
still is great with all three of them. But it&#39;s only the sister thing she<br/>
wants.....for a long time. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m unhappy about that. She sees what<br/>
it takes and intends to wait a while before jumping into motherhood. For<br/>
her, it&#39;s definitely the right decision. She can&#39;t understand how I do it.<br/>

Actually I find it helps if he moves a bit....  Seriously we have<br/>
a 24 and a 6, planned and beloved.  Granted, the 24 was headed<br/>
out the door when the 6 arrived, but starting over is great!<br/>

Oh heavens that sounds trying. Tara was most difficult as a baby. For being<br/>
the first, she really put me to the test. People who knew her as a baby were<br/>
surprised I wanted anymore. She hated being a baby and our first 2 years<br/>
together were rough. But I must admit my next 3 children were wonderful<br/>
babies and very easy to care for. I have to say it made the whole baby again<br/>
experience go easier. And I always had that 1% fear factor too. From the<br/>
first to the last. Alyssa, my last had some detected possible problems<br/>
before she was born. I had amnio&#39;s with the last 3 because of my age and<br/>
they picked up a possible problem in her brain. It was a tough few months.<br/>
Luckily everything worked itself out fine. But my placenta ruptured with<br/>
her, they did an emergency c-section (had one before) and she wasn&#39;t<br/>
breathing when she came out. She also stopped breathing the next day. Put<br/>
all that together and my husband says he just can&#39;t go through all that<br/>
again!!! Men!<br/>
<br/>
As far as keeping your husband in one place long enough, I&#39;m sure you can<br/>
think of something. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
