Thanks for sharing!  I&#39;m off to look for one nearby!  I had looked into the <br/>
website, but you are right, I didn&#39;t *get it*.  I&#39;d say we are an agnostic <br/>
family at this point...we go through our phases &lt;g&gt;, but I *SO* miss the <br/>
fellowship of church!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You just reminded me...I&#39;ve got an unschooling friend who tells a great story <br/>
(true) about moving to a small town in Texas and being asked, first thing <br/>
upon meeting a townperson, *So, what church do you go to?*  Rather taken <br/>
aback, she replied, *Oh, I&#39;m an agnostic.*  The woman didn&#39;t bat an eye and <br/>
reassuringly said, *Well, that&#39;s okay, honey.  I&#39;m a Methodist!*<br/>
