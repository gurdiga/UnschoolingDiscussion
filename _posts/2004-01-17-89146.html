<div id="ygrps-yiv-105696319">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I am rose. I am a sahm to 3 children, Levi 8( 2nd grade), Nathan 4 (<br/>
preschool) and Lillian 13 months (new walker).  I am step mom to Joseph who<br/>
7 this month, we are the part-time family ( public schooled with mom 1st<br/>
grade).<br/>
<br/>
I am a homeschooling mom but I am beginning to see the &#39;light&#39; with the<br/>
prospect of &#39;unschooling&#39; my 8 year old.  Because of custody issues I do<br/>
need to keep a record of &#39;daily learning&#39;.  I need to be ready at any given<br/>
time to present a &quot;what has and is being learned&#39;.  At this time I keep a<br/>
daily chart after the work is done. I can see how this could easily be<br/>
adapted to &#39;unschooling&#39;..<br/>
<br/>
I am finding for me &#39;unschooling&#39; isn&#39;t really a proper term for how I feel<br/>
about learning/teaching this way. But rather it is an &#39;alternative teaching<br/>
style&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I can also see that &#39;unschooling&#39; will make me do more with my children<br/>
compared  to &#39;sheet work&#39;.  I like this idea too.<br/>
<br/>
Because of custody issues with my two boys I don&#39;t think I would openly tell<br/>
the boys that I am unschooling them. I will just keep calling it <br/>
homeschooled&#39;.   It looks better to a judge as long as I can prove we ARE<br/>
learning at least at grade level or above (although 8 year old is in 3rd-5th<br/>
grade level on most subjects)<br/>
<br/>
I have enjoyed reading (the overwhelming amount) of e-mails and look forward<br/>
to all the encouragement here.<br/>

<br/>
It is still homeschooled, it&#39;s just a particular way of doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I always say &quot;homeschooling&quot; unless I&#39;m talking to other homeschoolers and <br/>
then I get more particular.   To the outside world, my kids aren&#39;t in school <br/>
because we&#39;re homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s that relativity thing.  Where are you in relationship to the person <br/>
you&#39;re talking to and what do they know (and what do they care?)--like if I&#39;m in <br/>
Canada, I&#39;m an American; if I&#39;m in Texas, I&#39;m a New Mexican; if I went to <br/>
another planet I&#39;d be an Earthling.  I&#39;m all those things, but the designation I <br/>
choose depends on who&#39;s asking and why and how general or specific it&#39;s <br/>
appropriate to be.<br/>
