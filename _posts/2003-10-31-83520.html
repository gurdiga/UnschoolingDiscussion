<div id="ygrps-yiv-437516259">Hi <br/>
This email is for all people who are, plan to, or support Home Education or the right to home educate your children and live in Alberta Canada.  All others can delete at will ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending this to all the lists I&#39;m a member to whether I have posted or not just to make sure people that need the information can get it.  So Hi to all you who may not recognise me and those who do, and apologies to those who receive this multiple times.<br/>
Cheers <br/>
Teresa<br/>
<br/>
Currently new Home Education Regulations are being drawn up by Alberta Learning.  They will affect you for the next 5-10 years until it is time to rewrite them again.  That could influence the remainder or majority of your child&#39;s school years.  <br/>
<br/>
There will be meetings held by Alberta Learning throughout the province, we need to have people in those seats to show Alberta Learning that we care about home education in this province.  If you are unable to attend those meetings then write a letter or phone your local school services branch to let then know what you think.  Your local support groups and organizations should have information about this as well.  <br/>
<br/>
If you would like information on the changes being made you can contact me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ctbucknum@...">ctbucknum@...</a> and I will help you find your local contact or send you information as I get it.  I think all families in Alberta need to be made aware of the regulations as they are now and as they will be in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Teresa Bucknum<br/>
