<div id="ygrps-yiv-736762811">Evan attached immediately and then, completely lost it (this was <br/>
before the colic kicked in). It was hard the weeks afterwards. Thanks <br/>
to friends who work with La Leche League, I was able to get back in <br/>
track with it. Same with Aidan. We have an ultrasound with him <br/>
sucking his fore and middle fingers; he sucked his fingers minutes <br/>
after he was born but latching on was a huge undertaking. It was <br/>
really difficult to the point that I developed mastitis for several <br/>
times and got really sick --with both of them. The encouragement I <br/>
got from friends, LL-Leagers and midwives, plus my determination to <br/>
breast feed got me through it.  And the lactation consultants said it <br/>
--some get it immediately, others just don&#39;t and yes, you have to <br/>
teach babies how to latch on.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, I think it is a part of evolution that, thanks to the <br/>
technology and resources we have available, we are by-passing a lot <br/>
of drama involving childbirth and newborn care. If not, Evan would <br/>
not have been born alive or after having Aidan I would have bled to <br/>
death. Nature would have definitely dealt us a blow but thanks to <br/>
nurture my children and I are here.<br/>
