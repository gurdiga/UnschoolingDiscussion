<br/>
This is exactly what is happening at our house.  I tried to &quot;do phonics&quot;<br/>
with Zach when I was &quot;supposed to&quot;, meaning when he was 5.  It was a<br/>
horrible experience for both of us and it took YEARS for him to get the bad<br/>
taste out of his mouth.  At 10, he still has no interest in books, but<br/>
neither does his dad, but he can read well enough to play the PS2 and he<br/>
reads signs along the road a lot.  He will ask what a word means and I&#39;ve<br/>
found the less I worry, the more he reads.<br/>

Is Sharon of the Swamp still on this list?  She lives right there as well<br/>
and is about as cool an unschooler as you would want to meet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794148238"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;At 10, he still has no interest in books, but<br/>
&gt; neither does his dad, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I keep this fact in my mind all the time, to ease my mind about  my <br/>
late starting reader. Nine, and just barely starting to want to try <br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
Me: bookish<br/>
<br/>
My husband: Not bookish...and yet, he reads just fine.<br/>
<br/>
And when I think about it, there are SO MANY ADULTS in my life, who <br/>
aren&#39;t all that into books...my brother, my dad, a very close <br/>
girlfriend who &quot;doesn&#39;t read for pleasure&quot;, my grown son...very <br/>
intelligent, very responsible, capable, literate people, who just <br/>
aren&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
BOOKISH<br/>
<br/>
why get in a panic about my 9 year old girl not into books at her <br/>
age, when so many people aren&#39;t into them, even into adulthood? <br/>
