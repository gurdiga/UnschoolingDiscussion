<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567137562">&lt;&lt;Is it because they are so big that they are attachments or are they<br/>
attachments regardless?  One suggestion is that people take the time to only<br/>
put small snippets into a reply rather than the whole e-mail they are<br/>
replying to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they are too big.   If the size is more manageable, it comes as a plain <br/>
e-mail.   Your suggestion is a good one, but I doubt that very many people <br/>
will really take heed.  Anyone else out there receiving the digest verson of <br/>
the list and prefering not to download it?<br/>

  I also delete the digest if it means downloading it. I just don&#39;t have time <br/>
to do it!<br/>
