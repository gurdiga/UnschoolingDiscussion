<div id="ygrps-yiv-827051459">Hi all, I am working on an article on the common myths or misconceptions <br/>
about unschooling and unschooling families. We have all heard the very <br/>
sad.... If left to there own devices kids would just sit and watch TV or play <br/>
video games all day. What are some others that you have heard? <br/>
Thanks<br/>
