<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943881769">Hey, Juli!<br/>
<br/>
In an earlier post of yours, you asked me where I live in MI and that <br/>
you live in the UP. I live in the Detroit area. Yes, it is GREAT to <br/>
live in Michigan and home school ... especially unschool. Very easy.<br/>
I hope it stays that way. Where in the UP are you? We spent our <br/>
honeymoon in St. Ignace. We drove up see Taquamanon Falls and we also <br/>
went on the Agawa Canyon train. Beautiful! I am jealous that you live <br/>
up there and we don&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023471415">We&#39;re in Marquette, the UP&#39;s &quot;city.&quot; :) I love it<br/>
here. We&#39;re right on Lake Superior, and it&#39;s a<br/>
friendly small town, but because of the university,<br/>
it&#39;s not hickish, you know? We love St. Ignace, or<br/>
more exactly, Mackinac Island. If you ever come up<br/>
here for a trip, we could meet! Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462279441">Awww, you guys are making me homesick....<br/>
I grew up in a suburb of Chicago, but we had a summer home in Land O Lakes, WI...  We always went up to the UP.  I loved it up<br/>
there...staying at lodges, going to the devil&#39;s bathtub...  Stopping at Eirnerlei, and eating at the Library in Houghton/Hancock...  I so<br/>
love Lake Superior.  It makes me feel very homesick, although, now that I am in NC...the winters are very nice here (for the long haul)  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870578809">Uh... the Library in Houghton burned down and got<br/>
rebuilt (after a couple years) but it&#39;s all trendy,<br/>
huge picture windows. Not the same at all. Though it&#39;s<br/>
non smoking now, and I like that! Juli<br/>

But, I&#39;m willing to try the new!  That place was sort of dark, but I do have some great memories of going there with my parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087378376">Dear Julie and whoever else is from the UP and/or from Michigan,<br/>
<br/>
I, also, love the UP.  My parents grew up in Iron Mountain so I&#39;ve spent<br/>
quite a bit of time in that area.  It wasn&#39;t until 4-5 years ago that we<br/>
made it to Marquette.  My daughter and I Iove it there.  We usally stay<br/>
at the Dandelion Cottage.  Lake Superior is incredible!  Maybe someday I<br/>
can live there!  Until then I&#39;ll have to &quot;settle&quot; for trips there and<br/>
living down here in the metro Detroit area.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great to see that there are a few of us in Michigan!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Christina<br/>
