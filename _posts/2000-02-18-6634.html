<div id="ygrps-yiv-392413712">My 17yo dd (who is a devoted vegetarian) wishes to make soap using no animal fats. I have several soap making books, but they only mention some substitutions, not the actual &quot;recipe&quot;. She is really interested in those with an herbal flare and having never tried this before we really need something tried and true. If anyone has suggestions for either websites or books I would greatly appreciate your input!<br/>
TIA, Aleasa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182006319">Aleasa, are you on Many Paths??  I would think Nubs or Ria would have a<br/>
site.  If you aren&#39;t, I will ask for you.<br/>

My 17yo dd (who is a devoted vegetarian) wishes to make soap using no<br/>
animal fats. I have several soap making books, but they only mention some<br/>
substitutions, not the actual &quot;recipe&quot;. She is really interested in those<br/>
with an herbal flare and having never tried this before we really need<br/>
something tried and true. If anyone has suggestions for either websites or<br/>
books I would greatly appreciate your input!<br/>
