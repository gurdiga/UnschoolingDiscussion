I will never forget then image of my mother and older brother sitting at<br/>
the dining room table for hours every evening, both crying in frustration,<br/>
trying to force him to learn to read.  This torture went on for weeks.  He<br/>
was about the age of your son, or a little older.  I was reading and<br/>
composing poetry by five, so they thought there was something wrong with<br/>
him.  But my brother is just the type of person who likes to be cautious<br/>
and takes things all in his own time.  <br/>
<br/>
He is very much like my one year old, who is very analytical and technical<br/>
in his play style, yet very emotionally sensitive.  That summer we took a<br/>
car trip and my parents were reading Last of the Mohicans aloud to us, to<br/>
pass the time on the road.  My father reached a key passage in the book and<br/>
then passed it to my brother saying, &quot;Here Neil, it&#39;s your turn to read...&quot;<br/>
 He picked it up and dove right in to the story, and has never looked back.  <br/>
<br/>
He is now a voracious reader and loves highly technical Science Fiction<br/>
novels.  He must have devoured thousands more books than me, although I am<br/>
also an avid reader.  I just can&#39;t keep up with him.  He also spent four<br/>
years in the Navy as a &quot;tech&quot; working on the electronic and computer<br/>
systems on Viking Jets, and he now manages a retail computer software store.<br/>
<br/>
Not bad, for the &quot;poor little third grader&quot; who couldn&#39;t read.  Your son<br/>
will come around, in his own good time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168123140">My 11yo dd didn&#39;t read fluently  until she was 8(I think) and the 1st book <br/>
she picked up was Little Men.  She now reads everything with words on it, <br/>
including cereal boxes!!!<br/>
My 7 yo dd is starting to read but not confidently. We read as a family all <br/>
the time and I am confident that she&#39;ll be ok. My mil watched the kids the <br/>
other night (my dh and i went out ALONE for our anniversary!!!) and we <br/>
returned to Grandma &quot;teaching&quot; my patient child to read. Both dd&#39;s later told <br/>
us that Grandma &quot;really didn&#39;t need to do that, but you know...&quot;   The kids <br/>
have been grilled by her  while we&#39;ve not been around, which makes them (and <br/>
me) uncomfortable.<br/>

I think reading is a pretty easy thing to learn when you&#39;re motivated. A lot<br/>
of children learn to read by themselves -- because they feel the need to<br/>
understand the communication of words. To understand something. Learning to<br/>
read is like learning to do HTML, programming, music notes, etc. Learning to<br/>
know something -- to get something done.<br/>
I sort of feel like I&#39;m preaching to the converted here *smile*, but I<br/>
thought I&#39;d add my 2 cents. ~Eryn<br/>

<br/>
It IS easy when you are motivated and when you are ready. My precious 8yo <br/>
(whom I seem to talk about quite a bit :o)) taught herself to read at the <br/>
tender age of 4. She has been reading chapter books since she was 5. The only <br/>
thing I did was read constantly out loud, and she got it. My darling 6yo has <br/>
finally caught on to reading in the past few weeks. She has just not been <br/>
interested in learning to read or write but something has finally &#39;clicked&#39; <br/>
and she gets it. The only thing I have done with her is constantly read out <br/>
loud. <br/>
<br/>
When your child is ready, no matter what age he/she may be, they will &#39;get <br/>
it&#39;. I love watching the girls learn new things. One day things click and <br/>
they say &quot;Oh yeah, this is what it is all about!&quot; The best thing is that it <br/>
happens in their own time and when they are ready, not when a teacher or <br/>
curriculum says they have to be.<br/>

No magic, here, Tami, but we just keep plugging along. In my heart of hearts <br/>
_I_ know my kids are fine, great even, but when I&#39;m at a low point, it&#39;s hard <br/>
to keep things in perspective.  <br/>
I think that parents and other significants others _do_ want the best for our <br/>
kids--we just differ on what that means. We are mostly all products of a <br/>
traditional ed. system, our parents included, and re-defining just what <br/>
education means isn&#39;t easy for them .  I go out of my way to share with my <br/>
inlaws the great things our kids do.  We&#39;ve invited them to our events <br/>
including our Art Show and a Science Fair we participated in--we try to drive <br/>
home the point that the kids are doing these things because they _want_ to do <br/>
them.<br/>
  Right now my 11 yo dd is working on her portfolio(our assessment is next <br/>
Wed.),;she&#39;s practiced her fiddle, and has done some of her 4H projects--and <br/>
it&#39;s 10:00am!!!  Is it like this every day? Of course not.  But that&#39;s ok.<br/>

     I think that is great.  I am hoping that eventually my parents will <br/>
accept what we do.<br/>
I have tried to show them what we do, and I have tried to get them to read <br/>
some books on the subject, so that they understand where I am coming from.  <br/>
Right now, they just refuse to read anything, and they say that they believe <br/>
in the public school system.  They agree that something is wrong, but they <br/>
say it is just the violence, the absence of teachers being able to spank the <br/>
kids, the noninvolvement of the parents, and the &quot;certain&quot; things they are <br/>
having to teach in the schools now. However, they still think that the way <br/>
kids are taught in the public school system is right.  They get so defensive <br/>
about it, that they don&#39;t even want to accept that there may be a better way <br/>
for kids to learn.  Right now, I am not pushing the issue, I am just hoping <br/>
that in a few years, they will see the results with my kids.<br/>
