<div id="ygrps-yiv-447979428">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share with you all something that happened today...something<br/>
that makes me glad I decided to homeschool my kids.<br/>
My oldest daughter&#39;s best friend came over today (after she got home from<br/>
school ...public...and had done her homework). While they were playing near<br/>
me, the friend tells my daughter that something &quot;funny&quot; happened in school<br/>
today. Keep in mind that the friend is in 5th grade (my oldest would be in<br/>
4th). She said that her teacher had thrown chalk at a kid in math class<br/>
today...breaking it on the kid&#39;s head! Although I grew up in the public<br/>
school system--and have actually SEEN this type of thing happen many<br/>
times--I was still shocked. (Partly because this had happened when I was in<br/>
High School ...and I guess I never expected it to happen in a grade school.)<br/>
I know that many people don&#39;t have the patience it takes to deal with<br/>
kids...and I know that even those with lots of patience can get upset and<br/>
&quot;lose it&quot; at times with a child they feel is especially trying...but this is<br/>
ridiculous! And, I know that nothing will be done about it--THAT&#39;S the worst<br/>
part! And the thing that makes this even worse in my mind, is that this is<br/>
the same school (my oldest used to attend it) that swore to me it was the<br/>
absolute best! They hyped up their &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; status and so on and so<br/>
forth! (They also got the &quot;Star School&quot; honor!)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it seems I am blowing this out of proportion a bit...but there are<br/>
many other incidents (of varying types) before this one--I suppose this one<br/>
is just the proverbial straw.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541983463">Here is another one. Tuesday, a 13 yo girl was on her way to school here in<br/>
Port Huron, MI. Holland Woods Middle School backs up to the local partially<br/>
wooded park. As she cut through the park, a man approached her. He asked her<br/>
why she wasn&#39;t in school. She said that she was not allowed to talk to<br/>
strangers, and he hit her in the head several times. She hit a tree, started<br/>
yelling, and hitting back. He ran away, and has not been caught. BTW, this<br/>
is the same school that became a national media target when 4 boys planned a<br/>
pep rally massacre and bomb was found...<br/>
We all have a choice in education. For most families, the choice is private<br/>
or public education. My choice is real education, at home!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519228540">I heard one around here too...<br/>
A bus driver got fed up with the kids on his bus.  He stopped the bus<br/>
and made all the kids get out and walk home!<br/>
There were kids of several ages on this bus.<br/>
He is no longer a bus driver.  Can you imagine?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631844036">I have heard of a teacher in my area that,teaches pre-1st, that got fed up with a student, he couldn&#39;t sit still for very long, and taped him to his chair.  This was a six year old boy.  I don&#39;t know many of them that can sit still.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, I can imagine......while I was in school our bus driver did all<br/>
kinds of horrible stuff.  If the kids would get too noisy (so he<br/>
couldn&#39;t hear the radio....) and it was hot weather he wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
anyone lower the windows.  We&#39;d sit in a stifling hot bus for the whole<br/>
ride home.  This same driver was also rather reckless and sent the bus<br/>
flying off the road and into a ditch in the snow one afternoon (curvy<br/>
country roads...he wasn&#39;t very cautious).  Luckily no one was hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago I happened to work in the same factory as this man...he got<br/>
fired.  And I later heard that he had been fired from driving bus too<br/>
(lots of school bus drivers in our area drive bus as a second job, and I<br/>
heard this from another driver)...but he was the driver of the bus I<br/>
took home from school for at least 10 years.  I really wonder what<br/>
finally got him fired....he really was a creepy sort of guy.<br/>
