<div id="ygrps-yiv-585847688">You guys are da bomb!  (As my dd would have said five years ago.)  <br/>
But then, I knew you would be.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of other questions that have come up during my research.  I <br/>
referenced these in other posts, but I&#39;m separating the questions <br/>
here in case someone who knows might not have been following the <br/>
other thread.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know anything about the Endview Plantation in the Newport <br/>
News/Hampton Roads area of Virginia?  It&#39;s quite a bit out of the way <br/>
of my planned path, but it looks great online.  A living history kind <br/>
of place -- it was a field hospital during the war, etc.  They are <br/>
also hosting a Civil War Ghost Walk while we&#39;ll be in Virginia, and <br/>
that looks like creepy fun.  I don&#39;t, however, want to drive all that <br/>
way without an endorsement.  Won&#39;t, in fact.  So -- anybody know it?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found a whole cluster of Underground Railroad sites and a <br/>
museum outside of Philadelphia -- in the Westchester area.  It&#39;s <br/>
called the Kennet Underground Railroad Center.  Anyone know anything <br/>
about that?  Most of the other UR stuff (museums and any <br/>
concentration of hiding places still open for public viewing) seem to <br/>
be in Ohio and Kentucky, and we&#39;re not traveling through either state.<br/>
Would a drive over to Philly from Gettysburg be worth it, I wonder?  <br/>
I don&#39;t want this trip just to be about the battlefield experience, <br/>
but also about the human experience, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks a lot for what you&#39;ve given me so far.  It&#39;s invaluable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065166303">&quot;Walkin&#39; the Line,&quot; by William Ecenbarger, gives a feel for this area. He traveled along the Mason-Dixon Line, talking to people along the way. Here is a quote from Booklist: &quot;Ecenbarger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, walked the accessible parts of the 365-mile line and sought out people with stories to tell that would shed light on the line&#39;s historical and racial significance. Ecenbarger also cites Charles Mason&#39;s journal, courthouse records, and interviews with residents of Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania who live along the line. The Mason-Dixon Line represents racial tensions and mirrors animosities that have persisted through slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the civil rights era, and even today, with some towns practicing unofficial racial division. Highlighting this checkered history, Ecenbarger visited Harriet Tubman&#39;s Underground Railroad and the site of reverse operation, where free blacks were sold into slavery in the South.&quot;<br/>
