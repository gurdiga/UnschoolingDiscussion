&gt; Had intended to write in and ask if anyone saw it. What the review I read<br/>
&gt; said the lead character shows strength and doesn&#39;t become the shrinking<br/>
&gt; violet. I thought that was a good sign for homeschoolers. We will probably<br/>
&gt; wait for the dvd but I&#39;ll put it on my list just the same.<br/>

even the heroine. It&#39;s a messy journey in which everyone disappoints <br/>
themselves and others, yet they each find ways to break through and become more <br/>
&quot;real.&quot; The end is kinda &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; in feel. <br/>
<br/>
       I wonder if those of us who were schooled ourselves but now have <br/>
unschooled awhile will actually appreciate it more (or on more levels) than those <br/>
who can only see it from inside the school perspective. I think the social webs <br/>
schoolkids weave might have such emotional resonance that those people will <br/>
take the movie literally, and maybe miss the metaphorical (or allegorical or <br/>
whatever) layers.  JJ<br/>
