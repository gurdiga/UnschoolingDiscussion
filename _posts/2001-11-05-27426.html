<div id="ygrps-yiv-793122523">My twelve year old son is physically gorgeous and prefers to let his very <br/>
curly hair grow until it gets totally out of control (so the squirrels will <br/>
be comfortable, don&#39;t you know). He also tends to dress rather androgynously. <br/>
As a result, he is often mistaken for a girl. When it happens, he casually <br/>
will say, &quot;Actually, I&#39;m a boy,&quot; whereupon the person will apologize <br/>
profusely. <br/>
<br/>
The thing is, he doesn&#39;t see being mistaken for a girl as an insult.  <br/>
Certainly not worth changing his appearance for.  I suspect, as he&#39;s hit <br/>
puberty with a vengeance, it&#39;s not likely to come up for much longer. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118475885">Kirby used to have a bowl haircut in front and waist-length in back, but he <br/>
got tired of people thinking he was a girl (that&#39;s when he was seven, eight <br/>
or so) and so he asked me to cut it, and said he&#39;d grow it again when he was <br/>
older and nobody would mix him up anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s broad-shouldered and has some facial hair, and his hair&#39;s about to pass <br/>
the middle of his back again.<br/>
