<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977734889">Have to say here,  I have been using tampons since day one and never had any<br/>

swimmer. also no problems for her.  and I will encourage my daughter to use<br/>

&gt;&gt; Well, I started at 9, back in the dark ages (50&#39;s) as did several other<br/>
&gt;&gt; members of my family.  So, some<br/>
&gt;&gt; pre-spotting prior to that age doesn&#39;t sound too out there.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now, as to the tampons.  That whole business about it being o.k. is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>simply<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; manufacturers trying to get more customers.  When I went through the<br/>
&gt;&gt; classes back in the dark ages, we were told they were definately not o.k.<br/>
&gt;&gt; for anyone who wasn&#39;t sexually active and were really not designed for<br/>
&gt;&gt; anyone who hadn&#39;t had a child yet.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We now know that they contain Dioxin and this push for younger and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>younger<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; girls to use tampons would seem to correlate with the increase in various<br/>
&gt;&gt; cancers and the younger and younger age that women are getting cancer<br/>
&gt;&gt; (ovarian, cervical, uterine and breast).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now, this is really weird because this seems to be a topic on several<br/>
&gt;lists<br/>
&gt;&gt; right now so I have my whole Dioxin speel down.  Dioxin is in the top 10<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;&gt; known carcenogens.  It is the &quot;evil&quot; from Love Canal, etc.  It is fat<br/>
&gt;&gt; soluable, not water soluable which means it resides in fatty tissues and<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;&gt; found in humans, mammals, birds and fish and seeks them out, so to speak.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Dioxin is the by-product of the bleaching process that cotton goes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>through<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; and is residual.  Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>
&gt;&gt; are put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>
&gt;&gt; chemical free.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; This board has been quiet for a while. But I hope all you supportive<br/>
&gt;moms<br/>
&gt;&gt; are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; somewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and<br/>
&gt;&gt; need<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; some real good advice soon.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; okay here is the situation.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; My dd is 81/2.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Over the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a<br/>
&gt;&gt; cleaning<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; spree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for<br/>
&gt;her<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; last weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;spotting&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; on them .<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Okay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11<br/>
&gt;&gt; myself<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; my sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>believe<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; my<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; husbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was<br/>
&gt;talking<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; about. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; embarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; bestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her<br/>
&gt;10<br/>
&gt;&gt; yod<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; just had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; bring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left<br/>
&gt;&gt; them<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; out for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; tried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have<br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; questions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; now<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; .What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; concept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; make sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to<br/>
&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Drs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone<br/>
&gt;agree?<br/>
&gt;&gt; The<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; booklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ?????? For<br/>
&gt;&gt; an 8<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; yo? I think not.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Anybody have answers or ideas as to handle this situation?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; HELP!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877190929">When I used disposable diapers they didn&#39;t have the gel in them.  I mainly<br/>
used cloth but on an extended vacation they were what we choose to use.<br/>
<br/>
However, wishing to fight or not, I think that no one is trying to be nobel<br/>
(rather strange choice of words), one was simply sharing information that<br/>
the drug companies and manufacturers of various products have worked very<br/>
hard to keep us, the consumers, from knowing.  You can&#39;t make informed<br/>
choices if you don&#39;t have the information/knowledge to make those choices. <br/>
As one acquires more information/knowledge, one frequently finds that the<br/>
choices they made in the past are not the choices they would make in the<br/>
present.<br/>
<br/>
Now, TSS is similar to tetenus and blackleg in the environment it needs to<br/>
cause problems and putting something on the outside of a body will have<br/>
nothing to do with one acquiring any of the above unless one puntures a<br/>
spot that they are on.  All take a closed environment (lack of oxygen) that<br/>
has been traumatized--puncture wounds are the norm for tetenus, the scrapes<br/>
and pinches caused by the plastic applicators of the major culprit tampons<br/>
created the environment for TSS, a bruise is the norm for blackleg.  And,<br/>
it should be noted that the tampons with the plastic applicators were the<br/>
ones that were pulled and that other tampon makers were only required to<br/>
print a warning statement on their packages.<br/>
