<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183184405">I LOVE sseing my little ones pretend.....I know for many years I had<br/>
forgotten this joy.  Is this something one outgrows?  Wanders away from?  Do<br/>
any of you take time to &#39;pretend&#39;?  Does fantasizing about the lottery<br/>
winnings whenever I see the jackpot billboard count?<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is one of the things I find so charming about my son.  He seems to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a kind of old wisdom, an intuitive sense about right and wrong and<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; maturity in some things I don&#39;t see in most adults I know.   At the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; time he believes in the possibility his stuffed animals are really<br/>
alive,<br/>
&gt; &gt; his favorite blanket can hear, and keep his secrets, and an ancient<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone is living in the mountain ash tree.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My 14 yo and her 15 yo best friend still play pretend - with stuffed<br/>
animals<br/>
&gt; galore. They can &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; and have a great time. I think that<br/>
&gt; their ability to do this is just amazing. The difference between them and<br/>
a 7<br/>
&gt; yo doing the same thing is, I think, that they have a certain level of<br/>
&gt; background awareness that they are doing it, that the 7 yo wouldn&#39;t<br/>
probably<br/>
&gt; have. Maybe.<br/>
