<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533246886">I&#39;ve been thinking this over for a while. I think some people (including <br/>
me when I fall into this mode of thinking) expect that unschooling will <br/>
cure all the ills of humanity. On another list I&#39;m on, there was some <br/>
discussion about a family who homeschooled, respected their kids, and <br/>
still had serious problems. It was presented as if it were a problem <br/>
with homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But when I get into this mode of thinking, I ask myself what people were <br/>
like before schooling became widespread. The answer is that many people <br/>
were good, generous, hardworking and upstanding. But there have always <br/>
been people in every age that were shiftless, lazy, irresponsible, <br/>
drunk, selfish people. It&#39;s not only about schooling. I think schooling <br/>
and the attitudes that go with it make these things worse. And I think <br/>
unschooling and the attitudes that go with it decrease the probabilities <br/>
of that, but I also think it&#39;s not a panacea for all the ills of the world.<br/>

Nice disclaimer! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that unschooling won&#39;t solve everything, but going with the flow that <br/>
says treat your children badly and force them into school is pretty well <br/>
showing itself not to solve much of ANYthing (except that pesky &quot;how do we break <br/>
this parental bond?&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What bothers me sometimes is when someone blames unschooling for not working <br/>
when they didn&#39;t really relax into it and LET it work, HELP it work, when the <br/>
parents themselves never exhaled and began rebuilding their own model of the <br/>
way learning works.  Then they say unschooling might work for OTHER families, <br/>
but it didn&#39;t work for theirs.<br/>
<br/>
I have a story about Marty watching Othello on video, but I have to go to the <br/>
dentist.  <br/>
