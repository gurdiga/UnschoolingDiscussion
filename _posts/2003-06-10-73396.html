<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oh dear! Now you all are starting to sound like the &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
&gt; stereotypes that float around the homeschool world (pejoratively <br/>
&gt; depicted, unfortunately). You know, unshaven pits and legs, <br/>
&gt; birks, T-shirts and now to add to the list: husbands briefs and <br/>
&gt; boxers! ROFL!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t help it. I&#39;m a clothes person. I shop at Ann Taylor and like <br/>
&gt; my hip hugging black pants that make my daughter&#39;s teen <br/>
&gt; friends tell me their secrets. :) They think I&#39;m hip!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, my daily uniform when at home is often jeans with a <br/>
&gt; variety of J Crew or Gap t&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can I still play here? I do love Birkenstocks! :) But my legs are <br/>
&gt; smooth as silk... and so are my pits.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, of COURSE you can still play here, as long as you understand that some <br/>
of us no longer like you quite as much. But as your mama said, we&#39;re just <br/>
jealous.<br/>

&gt; I wear hubby&#39;s boxers also and started when I was pregnant also. Worked out <br/>
&gt; great cuz nothing fit me. I was 128 pre pregnancy and went all the way to <br/>
&gt; 198 <br/>
&gt; pretty much hubby&#39;s weight. I wore some of his t-shirts and sweats.<br/>
&gt; I usually don&#39;t leave unless my hair is done but I will work in the yard <br/>
&gt; without it curled.<br/>
&gt; I used to wear the work boots I just liked them more. Now it&#39;s usually a <br/>
&gt; pair <br/>
&gt; of sneakers or dock shoes. Loafers I think is what most call them. I want to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; be comfortable tiz all. <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t wear a bandana though I have thought about it.<br/>

Okay...you people are wandering around wear men&#39;s underwear, work boots, or <br/>
Birkenstocks,  tee shirts, leg hair so long it rustles in the wind, hairy pits, <br/>
 etc....<br/>

Forget unschoolers, you people are a bunch of DYKES!! :)<br/>

Kathryn, who gets to say &quot;dyke&quot; &#39;cuz she is one, and hopes she doesn&#39;t freak <br/>

&gt; LOL, and some of us even ride *motorcycles* too! I&#39;ve been called a dyke<br/>
&gt; many times for that one. Heck, I&#39;ve even been called a FAG because people<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t tell I&#39;m a girl under my pink-and-white leathers! Though there have<br/>
&gt; been many times in my life that I *wished* I could work up a craving for my<br/>
&gt; own sex (being generally disgusted with men at the time), I&#39;m hopelessly<br/>
&gt; hetero.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For all they talk about lebians been man-haters, in my experience straight <br/>
women are a LOT more likely to hate (or mistrust) men.  They have to hang out <br/>
with them more. <br/>
<br/>
Julian was mistaken for a girl most of the time, probably up until a year and <br/>
a half ago. He was very pretty, tended to leave his curly hair longish. So <br/>
we&#39;d be somewhere and someone would mistake him for a girl, and he&#39;d very <br/>
casually say, &quot;Actually, I&#39;m a boy.&quot; No big deal. But people would be VERY <br/>
apologetic. Julian never thought being considered a girl was an insult.<br/>
