<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039420106"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have been patient the past two days, trying as gently as possible<br/>
&gt;to remind members that there are children with special needs that<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t just learning disabilities, but your post really pissed me off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh dear, another misunderstanding. This was what I was talking about in a <br/>
previous post. The use of special needs to cover such a HUGE range of <br/>
abilities/disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Using my long-standing posting/reading technique of picturing both you and <br/>
Peggy as dear friends, I can see where each of you has a valid point of <br/>
view.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe Peggy was indeed talking of children with school type  <br/>
learning disabilities. Or special needs of a type that parenting, <br/>
understanding and therapies combined would alleviate many symptoms. We&#39;ve <br/>
all met parents who do seem to trust the &quot;experts&quot; and the &quot;diagnosis&quot; more <br/>
than their own instincts and their own child. I don&#39;t think Peggy meant to <br/>
include your situation in her observations.<br/>
<br/>
I also truly believe that you, dear Debbie, are doing the best you can with <br/>
your son&#39;s physical limitations. I am amazed and delighted that you are <br/>
unschooling with your precious son. Going against the advice of many <br/>
specialists I would suspect. What an inspiration!<br/>
<br/>
I can hear your pain and frustration at your son&#39;s escalating seizures. It <br/>
must be so difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything we can do to help you cope?<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Mary.  The encouragement helps.  Someday I&#39;ll write about my <br/>
experiences with the developmental and educational *experts* &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
That will come after my tell-all book about doctors and hospitals; <br/>
Kevin and I spent 5 months in the hospital last year so I have lots <br/>
of material...&lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Mary,<br/>
I thought I had responded to this...but I&#39;ve been back and forth to <br/>
the computer today in between baking cookies (the perfect snow day <br/>
activity), admiring ds-10&#39;s skill with LOTR Two Towers game, biting <br/>
my lip while dd-13 and dd-17 swing Kevin in a blanket suspended <br/>
between them, listening to dh mutter and curse while he cleans out <br/>
the basement looking for the rock salt...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Mary, for the understanding words.  I appreciate when other <br/>
people aren&#39;t afraid of talking about Kevin.<br/>
<br/>
