<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000571340">ok, now i&#39;m new to a lot of this, sort of, but the workbook talk is giving me <br/>
grief.<br/>
<br/>
it was nice to read someone (sandra?) talk of unschooling themselves, i&#39;ve <br/>
been doing that for myself for awhile now. it was a major awakening to find <br/>
that i actually like learning, now i *love* it and can&#39;t get enough.<br/>
<br/>
but what about workbooks, i agree that they shouldn&#39;t be pushed, but how <br/>
necessary are they? i love learning about religions, but sitting down in <br/>
front of a multiple choice questionnaire, which i recently did, causes me <br/>
stress and i feel limited.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve been of the opinion that &#39;doing&#39; math can be done with grocery play, <br/>
cooking, etc. do i need to be providing my son of 3 yr with workbooks for <br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
he likes to learn to drraw letters and numbers off and on, is a structured <br/>
workbook necessary for this?<br/>
<br/>
i guess i hadn&#39;t really given much thought to buying specifically written <br/>
textbooks or workbooks, we have and keep getting or borrowing so many books <br/>
on so many different topics, and educational tv shows, and computer stuff, <br/>
and just daily life...<br/>
<br/>
am i biased in thinking that most textbooks and workbooks are geared toward a <br/>
scheduled curriculum?<br/>

<br/>
Not necessary at all.<br/>
<br/>
My 2nd and 3rd kids liked math puzzles, and sometimes we&#39;ve bought a workbook <br/>
at the grocery store or toy store--like an Animaniacs math thing--the same <br/>
way we might buy a magazine or coloring book.  Those we have are in with <br/>
coloring books.  Nobody&#39;s expected to finish them or do them right or <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
We had homeschooling company once years ago, and Marty brought me a workbook <br/>
and asked what the directions said.  I read whatever it was, &quot;Put a red <br/>
circle around the picture that...&quot; (whatever it was, some phonics thing).   <br/>
He said &quot;Do I have to use red?&quot;  I told him it didn&#39;t matter what color, it <br/>
didn&#39;t matter if he drew a circle, he could do whatever he wanted to do with <br/>
it.    The other mom stiffened up in her chair and said in a  very <br/>
stiffened-up voice, &quot;At our house we think it&#39;s important for our kids to le<br/>
arn to follow direction.&quot;  I said I was sure when it was important my kids <br/>
would be able to follow directions.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids are rules lawyers extrordinaire when it comes to stuff like Magic <br/>
cards and Disc Wars and Mage Knights.  They can absolutely follow directions. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people were recommending text books or workbooks, Brenda, just <br/>
discussing what they did or didn&#39;t do with the ones they had, and suggesting <br/>
devaluing those already in the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people like word search puzzles.  Nobody at my house likes them.  But <br/>
they do like matching and sorting games (GeoSafari kind of stuff, or computer <br/>
games that involve matching stuff up, like Zoombinis) and sometimes workbook <br/>
pages are that way too.<br/>

give workbooks.  If they dont want workbooks, dont give them <br/>
workbooks. I dont think there is any right or wrong in workbooks, <br/>
only in * making* a child use them........<br/>

<br/>
No, no, no, no. <br/>
<br/>
My fault, sorry, I muddied the waters by saying we own more textbooks and <br/>
workbooks than most schoolathomes.<br/>
<br/>
My kids (and me) are the kind who like puzzles and mazes and games. So we&#39;ve <br/>
collected workbooks that are full of things to think about, problems to <br/>
solve, puzzles. Math is a tool, and math is a puzzle, too.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;ve got a collection of upper level textbooks for reference starting <br/>
spots. We&#39;re book addicts, what can I say. :)  Almost no elementary level <br/>
textbooks though, as we&#39;ve run across very few worth giving even pile space, <br/>
let alone shelf space.  :) <br/>
<br/>
None of that is necessary, nor is it where learning happens. They&#39;re <br/>
diversions more than anything else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395399070"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have a saxon book but it is so repetitive.  I&#39;m thinking Key To might be a<br/>
&gt; good one to have around, because that way if someone is interested in learning<br/>
&gt; fractions the way their friends do, they could just pick it up.  Key to is<br/>
&gt; pretty self explanatory.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But again, it would be their choice to use it, not use it, or just use a<br/>
&gt; little of it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son has schooled friends, and school-at-home friends (and a new, very<br/>
exciting unschooled pen pal -- the first unschooler he&#39;s ever known; Thanks,<br/>
Kelli!).  We keep workbooks around.  Can&#39;t say they get a lot of use, but<br/>
sometimes he&#39;ll pull one out if somebody has been talking a lot about &quot;what<br/>
grade are you in&quot; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my take on workboooks: buy the cheapest ones you can stand.  I figure<br/>
they&#39;ve all been written and published by at least minimally capable people<br/>
(we hope!).  They&#39;re not likely to see lots of use, so why invest a bunch of<br/>
money?  And if the instructions are less than clear, you can help your child<br/>
yourself, find a friend or neighbor who remembers the stuff, or go to the<br/>
library and track down a book that&#39;s clearer, right?<br/>
<br/>
My son just finished another math workbook.  He did 3 pages of it, announced<br/>
he knew how to do everything in it, and declared it done.  Seems fair to me!<br/>
