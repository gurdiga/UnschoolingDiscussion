it&#39;s &quot;Clydesdale&quot; and for women over 150 lbs. it&#39;s &quot;Athena&quot;. They are <br/>
athletes, some of them have been competing and doing well for years. They are <br/>
still large, even by non-athletic standards. But they&#39;re healthy and fit. <br/>
People need to be more accepting of different body types.<br/>
