<div id="ygrps-yiv-319140265">&quot;I do really good with the kids as long as no massive stress comes into play.<br/>
The kids are asked nicely to do things and usually agree.  The kids make<br/>
their own decisions about food, tv, friends, etc..  Lots of hugs and kisses,<br/>
lots of laughing but with 7 of us in the house and 3 under age 6, we live on<br/>
the edge of chaos (which again is ok as long as life is smooth).  Then<br/>
something happens and I find myself taking out my stress on the kids<br/>
(over-reacting, biting someone&#39;s head off, etc.)  I always apologize when I<br/>
have one of my tantrums but I&#39;m having trouble moving past this level.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the same boat. We only have four children, but boy can things get <br/>
chaotic, especially with a wee one that wants to destroy the house!!<br/>
I find my stress level rising when to many things are coming at me at once. <br/>
The house is a mess, the kids are having a rough day and getting on each <br/>
others nerves etc...<br/>
If you take any one stress at a time, I am fine. But combine them and I get <br/>
cranky.<br/>
I do find myself talking more now, than just screaming and being reactive.<br/>
And I don&#39;t think it hurts kids to know you&#39;re angry, sometimes they do <br/>
things that warrant anger.<br/>
But it&#39;s how the anger is directed......am I making them feel rotten? Or am I <br/>
just saying &quot;I&#39;m really, really frustrated and angry right now!!&quot;<br/>
Time out is not something I&#39;m very good at giving myself...but I try.<br/>
I ran outside the other night and did some deep breathing, just being out in <br/>
the moonlight really calmed me down.<br/>
The kids were a little freaked out I think, because I didn&#39;t say I was taking <br/>
 a time out, I just ran out the door because I could feel the rage rising up.<br/>
They wondered if I was going to drive off I think!! So it is good to warn <br/>
everyone that you&#39;re going to be alone for a while.<br/>
Meditation helps a lot. We have these little stones with words on them like <br/>
&quot;strength, joy, patience, God&quot; etc....and holding one seems to help you focus <br/>
on that characteristic and keep in mind how you want to act.<br/>
Reading Deepak Chopra helps a lot.<br/>
Buying fun items that I think the kids will like from the dollar store and <br/>
keeping them around for tense moments helps (Sandra&#39;s idea).<br/>
Right now I have a puzzle, sticker book, mini-dolls, a Zen Garden, fake fruit <br/>
and Barbie clothes all tucked in my closet. I pulled out a coloring book the <br/>
other day which kept Sierra entertained ALL day, so no time for fights with <br/>
her brothers.<br/>
Worth a buck anytime!!<br/>
Taking everyone for a walk to search for leaves or bugs can break my tension, <br/>
or if it&#39;s really bad I go by myself.<br/>
Putting on a new movie can calm me down. Dates with my dh seem to keep things <br/>
from building up, time alone or with him helps refresh me and be a better Mom.<br/>
Getting dh to entertain the kids for an afternoon without me, or Trevor to <br/>
keep them all in his room and watch tv or something, lets me clean the house <br/>
without much interruption.<br/>
Somehow, house cleaning helps me feel calm. It&#39;s something I CAN control when <br/>
other things feel out of control.<br/>
That&#39;s the trigger for me I think, feelings of lack of control. I&#39;m sure it <br/>
stems somewhat from childhood. But my anger is definitely related to that.<br/>
I used  to feel SO angry as a child over certain issues. I was extremely <br/>
independant and that was coming into conflict with my Mom and Dads parenting <br/>
style too often....caused a LOT of anger and rebellion.<br/>
So here I am trying to let go of that. Trying to not let lack of control make <br/>
me cranky even though it&#39;s in my nature.<br/>
House cleaning gives me some sense of control and I can then be very mild and <br/>
relaxed for my children. Their messes don&#39;t bother me, the noise doesn&#39;t <br/>
etc... just because I got things straightened up.<br/>
Crazy eh?<br/>
And I&#39;m no neat freak, I&#39;m just talking getting the dishes done, laundry <br/>
started and floor picked up.....strangely calming for me.<br/>
That and the meditation seem to help the most right now.<br/>
