<br/>
Funny thing is, I feel like dh and I talk a lot about unschooling and what<br/>
the kids are doing, yet he made a comment not long ago that I needed to<br/>
update my blog so he knew what was going on in his home. Huh? He was just<br/>
being silly, not mean or anything, but it made me realize how much he<br/>
enjoyed going to the blog during his week and reading about the kids and our<br/>
adventures. I guess just being able to read something when he feels like<br/>
taking a break, something that&#39;s not addressed to him or pushing a<br/>
particular agenda, really holds an appeal for him. I don&#39;t know if a blog<br/>
would work in your case, but it has become an interesting form of<br/>
communication with my dh that I never foresaw.<br/>
<br/>
On another note...<br/>
Dh and I seem to go in circles about unschooling. He&#39;s totally on board and<br/>
then busts out with some really inappropriate remark like, &quot;Well, we have to<br/>
expose them to math; otherwise, how will they be able to do word problems?&quot;<br/>
He&#39;s clearly distorting the word &quot;expose&quot; in a way that makes me really<br/>
uncomfortable--we&#39;ll be coming back to this during our hot tub therapy<br/>
sessions. *g* This came out the other evening when we were discussing a<br/>
possible move to Virginia where either portfolio review or testing is<br/>
mandatory every year. Sigh. Maybe my blog will begin to have a dh-aimed<br/>
agenda after all! *eg*<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, I&#39;m thinking these worries manifest themselves as he&#39;s<br/>
projecting the kids into the future. He&#39;s supportive about what&#39;s going on<br/>
now, has backed off about reading, etc. My hope is that the blog and other<br/>
conversations will help him continue to be okay with the present all along,<br/>
if you know what I mean. The more years he can do that, the more likely I<br/>
think he is to let go of concerns over the future. I think he will begin to<br/>
see that he&#39;s worrying uselessly as he realizes that the kids really are<br/>
okay and really are learning loads of things that make word problems and<br/>
other schooly things look silly and abstract. It&#39;s just hard for him to make<br/>
those connections now.<br/>

<br/>
Word problems are the real everyday ones!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny, in a funny way.    Kirby&#39;s got a GED practice math workbook, <br/>
and it&#39;s not the word problems that are news to him, it&#39;s all that notation with <br/>
a lack of words!<br/>
<br/>
But exposing him to it sooner wouldn&#39;t have helped much.  He&#39;s exposed to it <br/>
now, he has a need to know, and he&#39;s old enough and experienced enough to <br/>
understand the explanations.  SOME of them.  There were a couple of things in <br/>
there that Keith and I were &quot;HUH!?&quot; about, and looking at the answer section <br/>
didn&#39;t really clarify.  But it wasn&#39;t a math question, it was a test-taking <br/>
problem.  They have these grids to put numbers in, and it wasn&#39;t clear on looking <br/>
whether it mattered what columns the answers went into.  I don&#39;t know how the <br/>
scanner that scores the test is going to look at those.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here know?  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re columns with circles from 0 to 9, and then up top the choices in the <br/>
middle three columns are slashes and decimals.   The answer sheet showed a <br/>
fraction going 7/3 in the middle three columns.   So that was centered.   What if <br/>
someone put it on the first three or last three?  Would it be counted as <br/>
wrong?<br/>

The GED test publisher probably has a free practice pamphlet and may <br/>
have an extensive website.  I would start with their website if the <br/>
1,000+ minds on this list are all stumped.  (I&#39;m stumped.)<br/>

This reminds me of the worksheets that my step-daughter, Sarah would bring<br/>
home when she was in second and third grades at a private school (and also<br/>
my son, when he was younger and was still going to school.)  Sometimes the<br/>
directions made absolutely no sense at all.  There would be missing<br/>
information or it would be so poorly written that neither my husband or<br/>
myself could figure out what they wanted the kid to do!  We assumed that<br/>
they were probably doing similar problems in class and that our kids were<br/>
just supposed to remember what to do, but still, this was so unreasonable.<br/>
We didn&#39;t blame either of the kids for hating math homework.  Sometimes, we<br/>
would just show them another way to accomplish what we thought was<br/>
essentially the same thing being asked in the worksheet, but other times, we<br/>
were completely mystified as to WHAT they wanted.  I asked my son&#39;s teachers<br/>
about the worksheets a couple of times, but never really got a satisfactory<br/>
answer, though I can&#39;t remember what they said, exactly.<br/>
