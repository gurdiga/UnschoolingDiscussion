<div id="ygrps-yiv-185557705">Hello everyone!<br/>
It is the time of year that Pizza Hut and Book IT get together and try to<br/>
tally up the numbers for next year&#39;s program. So, I am here getting ready to<br/>
start up my own tally.<br/>
As most of you know, last autumn I sent out all the Book It packets, and I<br/>
would like to do it again. I have received the papers already for<br/>
homeschooling children, so I need to get a list of who would like to join<br/>
for next year. *When Book It starts again, you will need to send me a SASE<br/>
for this program, I am donating my time and energy to something worthwhile<br/>
for our children, but I cannot afford to pay to send the packet out to every<br/>
individual family - this year was over 100*<br/>
If you are interested, please email me PRIVATELY (as to keep lists clear) at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Lifeslearn@...">Lifeslearn@...</a> with the following information:<br/>
your name<br/>
email address<br/>
number of children participating.<br/>
Thanks and hope to hear from ya soon-<br/>
Stephanie<br/>
If you have any ?? feel free to contact me:)<br/>
