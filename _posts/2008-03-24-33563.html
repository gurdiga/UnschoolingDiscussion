<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483570437">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a search on pen pals in these archives but couldn&#39;t find<br/>
what I wanted.  So, I hope this is ok to post here.  My daughter has<br/>
been reading some of my unschooling list with me and now she&#39;s<br/>
interested in having a unschooling pen pal (that she doesn&#39;t know<br/>
IRL).  My daughter is 10 almost 11 and we live in Iowa.  Feel free to<br/>
email me privately or if you know of a link to a group that&#39;d be great<br/>
to see!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll apologize now, if I shouldn&#39;t be posting this here!<br/>
