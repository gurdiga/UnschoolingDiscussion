<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268969512">I have a funny story! I have already sent it out to be published, so <br/>
please dont call it your own. I have seen alot of this on the net, no <br/>
I&#39;m not nuts, well, yes, I am but.....Oh nevermind, heres the story!<br/>
<br/>
When my son, Jay , was born we received a piggy bank as a gift. As he <br/>
grew, he enjoyed putting the spare change he would find into it. He <br/>
asked me what he was saving for when he was2 and when I told <br/>
him &quot;college&quot;, he never questioned it.<br/>
Shortly after we returned from a Cape Cod vacation a year later, Jay <br/>
was dropping his pennies in the bank and told me he couldnt wait to <br/>
have enough money for cottage.<br/>
&quot;College&quot;, I corrected.<br/>
&quot;Whats that?&quot; he asked.<br/>
I explained to him that college was school you go to after you finish <br/>
high school. The look on his face was priceless as he cried &quot;Oh no! I <br/>
don&#39;t want to go to school! I want to go to the beach!&quot;<br/>
All along he had thought he was saving for a cottage at the beach!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t give it much thought at the time, but I guess he has always <br/>
been an unschooler at heart!<br/>
