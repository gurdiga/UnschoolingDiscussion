<div id="ygrps-yiv-861334199">Your feelings and concerns are normal I would say. It is hard to relax and <br/>
trust the child will come out in the end functioning fine but they will.<br/>
My daughter watches the shows you listed in the likes and dislikes. Some days <br/>
she does and some she does not. She prefers rugrats and all the Nick, Jr. <br/>
shows.<br/>
<br/>
I think what matters is not the shows, movies and outsiders but rather the <br/>
parent model. If you are not beating people over the head or committing crimes <br/>
your son will be just fine. Children know the shows are not real (most of them).<br/>

&lt;&lt;My dh watched Ed, Ed, Eddy with him <br/>
and said the way in which some of the characters talked to eachother <br/>
showed alot of rudeness although I have not seen that one.  The <br/>
fairly oddparents really gets under my skin and that one we do not <br/>
allow because I think he is too young.  In general, I think I am <br/>
having difficulty seeing value in some of these shows.  I am <br/>
struggling with how much freedom to give.  IS he making an <br/>
intelligent choice or just staring like a dog foaming at the mouth  <br/>
watching shows that corporate america has put out there marketed to <br/>
little boys (harsh but how I feel. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Olga, this was really hard for me to get too.  Not so much about tv, because <br/>
they have always made choices there which I have had no cause to question.  <br/>
But with food, it was exceptionally difficult.  My 5 year old boy has one <br/>
potentially fatal allergy  (peanuts) and one that gives him eczema (processed corn <br/>
additives).  Once I gave up control of his eating, he ran with it.  He asks <br/>
what is in something, wont touch anything with chocolate in it and always tells <br/>
people of his allergies.  Today a mom at our homeschool group offered him <br/>
unfamiliar crackers and he said he couldn&#39;t eat them without me reading the label <br/>
and because there was no label, he&#39;d just rather not.  I thought to myself, <br/>
&quot;What a kid!&quot;, but they are all this way if we let them be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked very hard recently on finding the value in superman and I think <br/>
I&quot;m there, thanks to help from this list.  <br/>
