<div id="ygrps-yiv-404023412">I know I&#39;m probably one of the few people on this list who hasn&#39;t yet<br/>
read a book by John Holt.  I just started reading Learning all the<br/>
Time and what an amzing book!  <br/>
<br/>
I usually only have time to read when I&#39;m riding my bike in the<br/>
mornings (stationary bike).  I ride for an hour a day and that&#39;s when<br/>
I get caught up on my reading.  I&#39;m usually so tired when I get done<br/>
that I just want it to be over.  Well, this morning, I started reading<br/>
Learning all the Time and, before I knew it, 75 minutes had gone by! <br/>
I couldn&#39;t believe how much I related to this book. I grew up in<br/>
public schools and, everything that he said about the &quot;learning&quot; that<br/>
goes on in them is true.  I never really learned anything.  I would<br/>
memorize it for the test and then quickly forget everything that I had<br/>
&quot;learned.&quot;  The only thing that I have retained from school is only<br/>
those things which I really wanted to know about and went so far as to<br/>
reseach on my own time.  <br/>
<br/>
The things that he points out about how children are taught to read in<br/>
the public schools and how absurd some of the phonics &quot;rules&quot; are, are<br/>
so true.  I remember, when I was learning to read, how they just<br/>
didn&#39;t make any sense.  And the same with math &quot;rules.&quot;  I remember<br/>
asking a teacher once (in my highschool trig class) &quot;but why is that?&quot;<br/>
 He just looked at me and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, it just is.&quot;  Gee that<br/>
really helped me to figure it out.  :)  I never asked that question<br/>
again. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am now even more excited about unschooling than I was<br/>
before.  I can&#39;t wait to watch my daughter learn on her own (with help<br/>
from me, if asked) those things that I struggled with as a child in<br/>
the public school system.  I can&#39;t wait to give this book to my<br/>
husband to read, maybe he&#39;ll now understand what I mean when I say<br/>
&quot;unschooling.&quot;  <br/>
