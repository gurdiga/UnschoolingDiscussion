<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263071071">Blech. I even edited my own post and still found all kinds of typos <br/>
in that last email (about writing, no less!) Just want you to know <br/>
that I simply type too fast for my own good so if you run across a <br/>
mistake, it is invariably fingers that got out of control, not my <br/>
spelling or grammar abilities. :)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry!<br/>
