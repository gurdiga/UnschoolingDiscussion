 </span></blockquote>Hello, Julie!  We are Washingtonians -- and we are essentially unschoolers<br/>
(though we never use the term -- my book explains what we do, and you can call<br/>
it whatever you want.)<br/>
<br/>
The laws in Washington are very simple and easy:<br/>
<br/>
Parents are required to file an &quot;intent to homsechool&quot; between the time the<br/>
children are 8 and 15.<br/>
<br/>
Parents are allowed to homeschool if either:<br/>
1.  One parent has at least the equivalent of about one year of college; or<br/>
2.  One parent takes a &quot;homeschooling qualifying course&quot; -- these usually take<br/>
about 16 hours, either four evenings or a weekend -- and for the most part<br/>
they just put you in touch with resources in your community. They are almost<br/>
always taught by homeschoolers -- lots of my friends teach them.<br/>
<br/>
Between the ages of 8 and 15, children must either:<br/>
1. Take a standardized test (from a list supplied by the Board of Education --<br/>
it can be done at home -- and we have a wonderful organization in Spokane,<br/>
Washington named the Family Learning Organization which can supply the tests);<br/>
or<br/>
2. Be evaluated by a &quot;certificated person&quot; (it&#39;s supposed to mean a qualified<br/>
teacher).<br/>
Results of these evaluations or tests are NOT, by law, to be shared with<br/>
school districts or board of education; they are meant for the parents&#39;<br/>
benefit only in evaluating their own children&#39;s progress.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all there is.<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me further if you need more info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16777210">I live in Kitsap County - we are a bridge away from Tacoma (30 miles) and a <br/>
ferry ride away from Seattle (or a 75-mile drive around the water). Our <br/>
prices are still low in Bremerton and some in Port Orchard, but places <br/>
where a lot of Seattle commuters live have shot up. Still, my 4 bd, 2 ba <br/>
house with a view of the Olympic Mts., hot tub (old) and .41 acre is worth <br/>
about $140,000 now - in Seattle it would be nearly three times that. Our <br/>
traffic isn&#39;t bad either. We&#39;re small town folks but are being infiltrated <br/>
by more and more city folks, so we might get some culture out of the deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639491311">I meant to say, also, when the state wrote in the clause for having an<br/>
assessment in lieu of standardized testing, I&#39;m sure that they didn&#39;t<br/>
imagine a mail-order arrangement.  Their intent probably was to have a<br/>
current teacher meet with the family to make sure that the child was<br/>
learning what he was supposed to be learning (ie grade level and all that<br/>
stuff) and to make sure that the family was really homeschooling and not<br/>
just too lazy to bother with getting the kid to school.<br/>
<br/>
Although I think if I were that lazy, it would be easier to send the kids to<br/>
school than to have them home all day!<br/>
