<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134052225">It&#39;s a long story, but I&#39;m finally ready to download a clean copy of my old<br/>
favourite mail program, Eudora.  Before I do that, I&#39;d like to hear how some<br/>
of you approach &quot;email discipline&quot;.  I have well over 600 messages in my<br/>
Unschooling-Discussion folder in Outlook Express, from about the last year.<br/>
Some of those are posts I planned to reply to and never did.  Some are posts<br/>
I truly wanted to save.  Some are posts I meant to go back and read when I<br/>
had time.  You know how it goes.  I *do* delete an awful lot of email, but<br/>
not nearly enough.  And I still haven&#39;t come up with a good way to organize<br/>
the stuff I *want* to save.  Anyone want to give me tips?  You don&#39;t have to<br/>
be as good at it as you wish you were.  Some tip that you suggest might work<br/>
for me anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t delete. I read every last piece of unschooling mail I get (I *do* <br/>
delete mortgage rates and penis and breast enlargements! &lt;G&gt;). <br/>
<br/>
But the things I want to save, I just print out. I have BOOKS of things I&#39;ve <br/>
saved. I have some of *your* posts too, Tia!  My &quot;Book of Tia&quot;. &lt;g&gt; I punch <br/>
holes in them, sort them by author, and put them in a three ring &quot;Unschooling <br/>
Notebook&quot;. The negative is that I have to type it back out if I want to forward <br/>
it on to someone (which I actually did for Sandra last week). The positive is <br/>
that I can access them anytime.<br/>
<br/>
You *could* just make your own website---like Sandra&#39;s---and keep them there. <br/>
It wouldn&#39;t have to be fancy, just available.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Each of those things has to be formatted, though, and so it&#39;s not as easy as <br/>
just hitting &quot;save.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have some things in folders by topic on my computer.  I have lots in my <br/>
mailbox and either I do something with it in the month before it disappears or I <br/>
don&#39;t.  So my newish mail is stored on AOL&#39;s computer.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t save all that much, myself (except the website stuff, now, and I have <br/>
several things saved on the computer to put there.  Every few days I put <br/>
another little bit in.  Yesterday I added another &quot;typical day&quot; to Heidi C&#39;s <br/>
typical day page, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/day/heidic">http://sandradodd.com/day/heidic</a> )<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a good person to advise, because my office is a mess and my computer <br/>
is a mess.  I use the search function on my own computer to find things more <br/>
easily than I can click through folders.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274320699">I started a word document with different topics &quot;cool websites, neat quotes, things to keep in mind&quot; that sort of thing.  I&#39;ve been cutting and pasting from the posts onto the word document.  That way I&#39;m only keeping the bits I want and I don&#39;t have to dig through a post to find what I&#39;m looking for.  <br/>
<br/>
However it&#39;s filling up fast so IF you go that way I&#39;d recommend making several documents and having them each contain a topic.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

certain subject?  I wouldn&#39;t print them out (paper, ink) but I&#39;m going to<br/>
try pasting them into Word docs and saving them that way.  It&#39;s not so much<br/>
what system to use; it&#39;s the system for making myself *use* my system that&#39;s<br/>
really the problem.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I got one idea from another list.  (I&#39;ve posted this on three.)  This person<br/>
puts everything that&#39;s left at the end of the day into a special &quot;tickle<br/>
file&quot; with a date a month from then.  So each day she&#39;s got a tickle file to<br/>
go through and deal with.  (I know, I could just deal with them right away,<br/>
but I don&#39;t.)<br/>
