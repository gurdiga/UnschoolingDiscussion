We got the plans off the &#39;net. Try googling homemade rat cage maybe? There <br/>
are many sites. Look around &#39;til you find the one you like.<br/>
<br/>
We used the shelving you can find at Lowe&#39;s or Home Depot. It&#39;s not &quot;wire&quot; <br/>
exactly, but it&#39;s often used in closets, mostly white---I don&#39;t think I saw <br/>
any colors. You must cut ut with a handsaw, or maybe a dremel would work. The <br/>
shelves are 6&#39; long. We cut them in half. Do all your measuring in the store! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got one of those under-the-bed storage boxes for the base---throw the top <br/>
away. Make sure the shelving fits side-by-side and in the corners of the <br/>
base. <br/>
<br/>
Four 6&#39; shelves will make two double sides (Length), two single sides <br/>
(Width), and a top with a lip that measures 32&quot; X 16&quot; X 35&quot; (they overlap in <br/>
the corners) with one extra piece that can be cut up and used for ramps and <br/>
perches if you&#39;re clever and handy (we didn&#39;t!&lt;G&gt;). We attached everything <br/>
with some neat fasteners from the hardware department. The lid is attached <br/>
with those plastic things men love to connect stuff with (I don&#39;t know what <br/>
they&#39;re called: you thread one end into the other which has a hole, and pull <br/>
tight?)). You can add &quot;stories&quot; by attaching more shelving. We also have a <br/>
rope and a hammock. Some families cut doors into the sides for easy access; <br/>
we just lift the top and they scurry up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707097068">Thanks everyone for sharing. I can see I really need to talk to some<br/>
breeders.<br/>
 You are right...we got him at a pet shop. we were told they were no<br/>
different than breeders just less expensive.hmmmm!  I can see that we<br/>
will want to pay for quality.<br/>
  Now I feel kind of bad knowing that if we got him a friend it might<br/>
have helped. Oh well...next time I will go to a breeder. We are in TN. I<br/>
will need to serf the net awhile and see if there is anyone. Everyone is<br/>
too far to get their extras.*grin* but I am sure we will make out.<br/>
  Do any breeders ship? and is it an arm and a leg? what price might we<br/>
be talking for two rats? I don&#39;t know the different breeds so I can&#39;t say<br/>
I am particular. I go more for the personality......I guess except when I<br/>
go to the pet store huh? LOL!<br/>
