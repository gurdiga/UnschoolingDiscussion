&lt;&lt; Sorry. I used &quot;can&#39;t&quot; on a practical, concrete level--their knives <br/>
physically don&#39;t do the job. I honestly didn&#39;t consider that the same <br/>
word is used in the sense of &quot;forbidden.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the very cutest things Marty ever said to me was about &quot;can&#39;t,&quot; and I <br/>
wrote it down then so I can pull it from the Marty-Diary:<br/>

The first thing he said after “good morning” was “Mom, if you count to <br/>
infinity, is it illegal?”<br/>
I explained to him about infinity, with a million plus one and a “gadillion” <br/>
plus one.  He was fine with the explanation, and I said, “Who told you you <br/>
can’t count to infinity?”  He said I did, so I explained the difference in <br/>
things that are impossible and things that are illegal (have consequences).<br/>
<br/>
I need to try to get Marty’s first comment or question of the day.  They tend <br/>
to be pretty wonderful.  I don’t know whether he dreams things or wakes up <br/>
and lies there thinking before he gets out of bed, but he rarely comes out <br/>
saying “food” or “bathroom”--it’s usually something pretty interesting.<br/>

He&#39;s 14 now, so he was four.<br/>

Yesterday on the way to the home improvement store the almost 4 year <br/>
old daughter and I were having a love contest. We do this sometimes. <br/>
I&#39;ll say I love you bigger than the moon, and she&#39;ll say I love you <br/>
bigger than a rainbow. Yesterday she was coaching me, telling me <br/>
after she says how big she loves me, I have to say &quot;No, way, who zay&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who has been telling her no way, Jose, probably my <br/>
sister. <br/>
<br/>
We got to ride in daddy&#39;s big ole red Jeep pickup, which gave us <br/>
opportunities to talk like we don&#39;t normally get to because the Vulva<br/>
(volvo) has airbags and the kids are in the back. One of the best <br/>
things is my 10yo being big enough to ride up front with me in the <br/>
Volvo, I longed for her to ride up with me and hold hands and talk <br/>
when she was younger and I felt like a taxi-driver as she was an only <br/>
child for seven years. We had a great time bouncing down the highway <br/>
in that old red pickup, sometimes the three year old sings the <br/>
Sanford and Son tune as we drive LOL<br/>
<br/>
Ang, insomniac and jabber-mouth as we are putting on a new roof this <br/>
weekend. Worrying about the weather, worrying about the weekend <br/>
running out too soon, knowing that it is costing more than we figured <br/>
and I probably won&#39;t make it to SC this year :0( </span></blockquote></div>
