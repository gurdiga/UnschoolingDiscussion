<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370093899">It&#39;s New Year&#39;s eve, my husband is working, and my 4 year old son Logan and I are sitting at the computer, he is watching &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, and I have been reading the thread on this list about ODD.<br/>
<br/>
We stop and chat, he asks me questions about the movie.<br/>
We&#39;ve had a busy, socially active few days, so this is downtime is perfect for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
I bring him a snack, he says he&#39;s not hungry, and a few minutes later he tells me that he is hungry after all. I could have said, &#39;You just told me you weren&#39;t hungry&quot;. That would have created an adversarial moment between us. Instead, I made a few suggestions, and he decides he wants cucumber. As I am cutting the slices I have a creative flash, and make the slices look like a face, with blueberries for the nose and pupils.<br/>
He is delighted with this, and after he finishes eating it, he asks me make another plate.<br/>
I am getting into it at this point so I cut the slices of cucumber in half to make the smile look better, in my opinion. I knew I was taking a risk because Logan likes things a certain way, including his cucumbers, as circles.<br/>
As soon as he sees the plate, he tells me he does not like the cucumbers cut in half. I tell him I will remake it, no problem, and all was well.<br/>
<br/>
In both instances I chose to be his partner and friend.<br/>
I&#39;m getting better at it, and it pays off because the times I go back to to reacting, Logan reacts right back, and to an outsider, he might be viewed as defiant, difficult or spoiled.<br/>
Most people don&#39;t examine the parents behavior.<br/>
<br/>
My mom worries about him because she thinks he cries too much.<br/>
He has had some major meltdowns around my family, but as I reflect on why it happens I have to come back to me. I get nervous and stressed, and feel judged around them because I parent dfferently than the way I was raised, or how my sister is with my niece. Logan feels my energy, and minor things cause him to have major upsets.<br/>
They don&#39;t get the benefit of seeing our happy household on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to my husband and I to create a loving and peaceful place for our son wherever we are.<br/>
