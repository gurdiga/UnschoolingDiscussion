<div id="ygrps-yiv-558093798">I was getting those &quot;quarantined&quot; messages the other night.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
worry about it.  I think yahoo or some other layer of provider is hiccuping <br/>
and sending out weird messages.  I emailed Joyce about the messages the <br/>
other night, and she didn&#39;t really know what was going on, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be affecting anyone&#39;s ability to post.  Weird, though.<br/>
