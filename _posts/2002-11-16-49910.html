&gt; I can talk knowledgeably about.)<br/>

I think part of this issue is in the presentation.  I never learned I was<br/>
adopted, it&#39;s part of my history.  The adoption stories are part of the<br/>
litany of family stories I grew up with.  (There was a point when I was mad<br/>
at my older sister because she remembered MY adoption and I of course<br/>
couldn&#39;t remember hers!)  We celebrated 3 birthdays a year -- birth,<br/>
adoption, and baptism, and each one had seperate traditions.  We always went<br/>
out to eat at a fancy place on my adoption birthday, which was pretty<br/>
special; those were lean years for my parents.  I don&#39;t look like my<br/>
parents, but I was a teenager before that ever really occurred to me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen children whose biological parents had less tie with them than my<br/>
adoptive parents.  Adopted children at least know that they were wanted.<br/>
It&#39;s a real effort to adopt.  Lotsa people can have babies &quot;the easy way&quot;!<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
I would hope that an adoptive parent would reassure an adopted child that he<br/>
or she was their descendant, too.  It&#39;s not just about blood.  It&#39;s about<br/>
your heritage.  <br/>
