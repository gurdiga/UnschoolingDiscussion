<br/>
Well....just about anything could be educational depending upon what one&#39;s<br/>
interests are.<br/>
<br/>
My son was watching and enjoying &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot; for a long while there.  If<br/>
you haven&#39;t seen it, it&#39;s great.  Here are a couple websites that tell about<br/>
it:<br/>

<br/>
My older daughter likes the arts/crafts/decorating shows on HGTV/TLC.  (She<br/>
also likes books about beading, sewing, crafts, jewelry, etc.)  She watches<br/>
the morning news shows (primarily Today Show) pretty faithfully and she&#39;s<br/>
pretty current on world news.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter loves any show about animals, but we don&#39;t get Animal<br/>
Planet here.  She catches a lot of them on TLC and Discovery Channels.  She<br/>
and my older daughter also like &quot;The Price is Right&quot; and they really have<br/>
learned some math there.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
My husband and son enjoy many programs on The History Channel.  We also<br/>
enjoy A&E&#39;s &quot;Biography&quot; show occasionally.  We watch PBS from time to<br/>
time---especially the &quot;sociology&quot; or &quot;history&quot; kinds of shows.  We have<br/>
watched many interesting science/health shows on The Discovery Channel.  The<br/>
kids like some of the trivia shows like &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Jeopardy&quot;, etc., though they don&#39;t watch them a lot.  We sometimes watch<br/>
the forensics/crime-solvers shows....they&#39;re on TLC or Discovery.<br/>

<br/>
TV is not restricted in our house.  My 7-year-old boys have access to it <br/>
whenever they wish.  Personally, I don&#39;t think that a show has to be <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; to be worthwhile - although my boys pick up new vocabulary <br/>
from some of the silliest shows around - so, I suppose, all of them can <br/>
be viewed as &quot;educational&quot; to a certain extent.<br/>
<br/>
There are certain shows on the Cartoon Channel like, Dexter&#39;s <br/>
Laboratory, Tom & Jerry, Ed, Edd, & Eddie, and Justice League that my <br/>
boys just love.  If these shows entertain them and make them happy, then <br/>
I really don&#39;t see anything wrong with letting them watch them.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly TV can be educational, but, in our house, it primarily serves <br/>
as a form of entertainment.  There are other shows and channels they <br/>
love to watch, which, I guess, many other people would consider as being <br/>
more &quot;educational&quot;.  Some of these shows are:  History Channel <br/>
(History&#39;s Biggest Blunders, any show about tanks, planes, battleships, <br/>
submarines, GI&#39;s, Nazis,WWI, or WWII, The History of the Gun, Shows <br/>
about Knights, &quot;Blacksheep Squadron&quot;).  They love Animal Planet (that <br/>
crocodile guy), Discovery and The Learning Channel (Walking with <br/>
Dinosaurs, etc.), they also love &quot;Battlebots and Junkyard Wars&quot;.  They <br/>
like American Movie Classics channel because they like westerns, <br/>
especially JOHN WAYNE.  They like old movies like Godzilla and on Friday <br/>
nights, there&#39;s monster fest so they get to watch &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, <br/>
&quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;, and other old monster movies.  On <br/>
Friday nights at 9PM there&#39;s a show called &quot;Special Effects&quot; on AMC <br/>
which is a little documentary show about how the special effects of <br/>
movies are made - They really like that a lot.<br/>
<br/>
TV offers them a lot of entertainment and educational stuff as well.  <br/>
But, believe me, that&#39;s not all they do.  They are very involved in more <br/>
active pastimes such as riding bikes, Legos, taking compressors, etc. <br/>
apart, helping me in the yard, kitchen and cleaning, helping their my <br/>
husband with his Chemistry, etc., lots of drawing, computer games, <br/>
playing with friends, etc.  They have very full lives and TV just <br/>
happens to be a part of their lives because it makes them happy.  If <br/>
they&#39;re happy, I&#39;m happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think almost anything can be educational in certain circumstances.  <br/>
FOr example, Wyndham really like action stuff like Speed, ID4, <br/>
Volcano.  Those are movie but his TV taste is similar (except for his <br/>
pokemon thing.)  <br/>
Anyway, most of those actions shows lend themselves to discussion of <br/>
physics/science and whether the &quot;action&quot; is possible or not.  Anyway, <br/>
as hard as I have worked to limit the amount of time he spends <br/>
watching, I NEVER limit what he watches unless there is conflict with <br/>
other family members but that&#39;s a different issue.<br/>

<br/>
ps - sometimes the educational lesson is one about boredom and that&#39;s <br/>
okay too.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288780420">Any program is educational if you are learning something from it.  AR<br/>
expands the mind, opens horizons.  Sounds like a learning opportunity to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904662993">My family likes the Simpsons, too.  I don&#39;t know how I forgot to include it!<br/>
(I like it, but it&#39;s not on at a good time for me to watch it, so I usually<br/>
don&#39;t--my 8 y/o daughter sets her clock by it.)  We also like _King of the<br/>
Hill_ and one of our big favorites:  _Malcolm in the Middle_.  All of them<br/>
&quot;dysfunctional family&quot; kinds of shows.  By examining what is &quot;off&quot; I think<br/>
we can come to a better understanding of what is desireable in our lives and<br/>
why....and we laugh, of course!  _Spongebob Squarepants_ is funny, too, but<br/>
also not on at a good time for me to watch.<br/>
<br/>
I agree--there are *all sorts* of things to learn from these shows.  Humor<br/>
is something that requires a great deal of intelligence to understand.<br/>
