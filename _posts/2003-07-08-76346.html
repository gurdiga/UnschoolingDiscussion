<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577153317">I had a situation today and it sure didn&#39;t turn out to be very pleasant. I would love some feedback on what you would do.<br/>
<br/>
Today I caught my mom in Tara&#39;s room in her desk drawer reading a letter sent to her by an ex boyfriend. I was livid, and went ballistic. I avoid confrontation and more so with my mom, but I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. And then my ears as she didn&#39;t see it as a big deal because she would never say anything to Tara to let on she knew anything. Well I don&#39;t know who was talking but I let her have it. She&#39;s all pissed now at me. No big deal. <br/>
<br/>
Now, should I tell Tara what happened? Should I just mention putting her private things elsewhere without really saying what happened? I&#39;m just not sure what would be better for Tara. I&#39;m ready to shoot the old lady. Sorry, still very upset.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any opinions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102751079">Hi Mary - I would tell Tara what happened and ask her if she wants a lock<br/>
for her door.  I think not telling her would just be violating her trust in<br/>
a different way.  I don&#39;t blame you for being upset!  I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d<br/>
do/say to my mom, but I know I&#39;d wait til I had calmed down a bit (or a lot<br/>
:0)).  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348591186"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Now, should I tell Tara what happened? Should I just mention putting her<br/>
 </span></blockquote>private things elsewhere without really &gt;saying what happened? I&#39;m just not<br/>
sure what would be better for Tara. I&#39;m ready to shoot the old lady. Sorry,<br/>
still &gt;very upset.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be tempted to tell Granny she better darned well apologize to Tara,<br/>
frankly.  That is a huge violation.<br/>
<br/>
You just telling Granny that it&#39;s a problem isn&#39;t going to sink in.  And it<br/>
might happen again.  But saying that it&#39;s not allowed to violate someone&#39;s<br/>
space in your home and you expect her to correct the problem might change<br/>
that.  Plus it gives her a chance to see just how offensive it is to Tara.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the letter.  I&#39;m assuming you don&#39;t, since you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have the bad manners to read it.  So there IS the chance that it<br/>
would be a big embarrassment to Tara to know it had been read.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it could be made WAY more embarrassing to Grandma to have it<br/>
pointed out by a teenager just how out of line she was.<br/>
<br/>
UGH!  I don&#39;t know if I could actually follow this advice in your situation,<br/>
it&#39;s just my first, somewhat bitchy thought.  Still, I think it&#39;s valid.<br/>
She didn&#39;t violate your trust as much (I mean, she did, by snooping in your<br/>
home.)  But she sure did violate Tara&#39;s and should apologize.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588119228">Another thing.  To avoid some embarassment, Grandma can just say she was<br/>
looking, without being specific.<br/>
<br/>
Still, how yucky!<br/>

Tara.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh I went nuts. Really I did. Like I never have with my mom. I let her know<br/>
it was not okay under any circumstances and that it would not be done again.<br/>
She said she made a mistake and she would never do it again. I&#39;m not exactly<br/>
sure I believe her, but I think I do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now, we don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the letter.  I&#39;m assuming you don&#39;t, since<br/>
you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have the bad manners to read it.  So there IS the chance that it<br/>
would be a big embarrassment to Tara to know it had been read.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tara and I talked about the letter. As in I asked her if she was okay after<br/>
reading it and she said yes and pretty much told me what he wrote. (strange<br/>
circumstances with it all) By her reaction, I believe that it was no big<br/>
deal really. When I first questioned my mom about it, she was making it<br/>
sound like she looked at the envelope, as the kid writes stuff on that too.<br/>
Then she told me something that I know wasn&#39;t on the envelope, I saw that.<br/>
That&#39;s when I realized she read the letter. From my mom&#39;s reaction and what<br/>
she said, I don&#39;t think the letter was embarrassing in that way. Still no<br/>
better by reading it though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I think it could be made WAY more embarrassing to Grandma to have it<br/>
pointed out by a teenager just how out of line she was.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I tell Tara what happened, she will be very upset. She will feel violated<br/>
in her own room. I understand that. But I do not think she will ever say<br/>
anything to my mom. Tara&#39;s not like that with many people. She&#39;s not good at<br/>
being mad or upset at anyone but Joe and I. She&#39;s not good at expressing<br/>
that anger or hurt at anyone but us. So I&#39;m not sure it will help Tara.<br/>
Right now I think my mom knows better. If I ever even suspected that again,<br/>
she knows I would not be nice to live with.<br/>
<br/>
So my dilemma is what will help Tara or hurt her the least.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Not that I know of. But I hid a lot of things too. I have always had trust<br/>
issues with people. Still do. Maybe it is something from way back I&#39;m just<br/>
not remembering. My mom was never respectful of me and my decisions until I<br/>
was well into my 30&#39;s. I was a kid, what did I know? I never trusted her and<br/>
I still don&#39;t. Even before today! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was a younger me talking. I really let loose. Not screaming or<br/>
anything, just telling her how crappy that was what she did and what could<br/>
possibly make her think it was okay to do. It wasn&#39;t at all like any<br/>
exchange I&#39;ve had with someone over something I disagreed with. I usually<br/>
get all upset over what I said or didn&#39;t say. This all just came out perfect<br/>
for me. Joe wanted to know if I felt better after. I just don&#39;t like anyone,<br/>
especially family, where one should feel safe, screwing with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t feel too bad if I were you.  I&#39;d let it all ride a couple of<br/>
days<br/>
 and see what your mom says or what you&#39;re willing to say when it&#39;s cooled<br/>
off.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was angry after it happened but not feeling bad. My mom was sitting in the<br/>
dark all night watching TV. That&#39;s a cue for me to feel sorry for her.<br/>
Wasn&#39;t happening. Kids and me said goodnight as always. She does have a<br/>
thing going on with her brain and mini strokes. I can never quite tell<br/>
what&#39;s really forgotten or just convenient. It doesn&#39;t make her do strange<br/>
things, but she forgets.<br/>
<br/>
We are out all day tomorrow, me and all 4 kids. I have no doubt she&#39;ll be<br/>
fine when we see her.<br/>

Thanks Sandra, this really helped me see things a bit clearer. My first<br/>
instinct was to not tell. Joe thought I should and then I just didn&#39;t know.<br/>
I figured I would ask for some opinions, wait awhile and see what I thought<br/>
then. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t want to tell right away. I&#39;m glad Tara wasn&#39;t home<br/>
when it all happened. Kids didn&#39;t know what happened either. Only Joe when<br/>
he came home and saw my face. He knows me well. All he asked was if it was<br/>
something he did!!!! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

already passed, I know.  But I think grandma getting caught reading them, and <br/>
being yelled at by her daughter is probably enough humiliation for grandma.  <br/>
I&#39;m sure she&#39;s ashamed enough without anyone insisting on apologies.  If it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be a big deal for the granddaughter, then I&#39;d just let sleeping <br/>
dogs lie.  <br/>
<br/>
Besides...(probably putting my foot in my mouth on this one)...if we as <br/>
parents are trying not to yell at our kids, and trying not to shame and humiliate <br/>
them, why is it OK to do this to another adult?  I&#39;d just let it go, she&#39;s <br/>
probably ashamed enough..but that&#39;s me.  <br/>
<br/>
And yes, my mom read my diary once (an entry about the first time I&#39;d ever <br/>
had sex...oy.....)<br/>
