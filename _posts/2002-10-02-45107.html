 </span></blockquote>I have a psycho dog and life is very interesting.  She runs to the phone<br/>
when it rings just as if she is expecting a call.  She howls for every<br/>
occasion, good morning, goodbye, hello, I&#39;m hungry, I want out, I want<br/>
cookies.  You can always tell the &quot;I want cookies&quot; howl from the others<br/>
because she says &quot;YO, mama&quot;  (I swear!)  She sleeps in odd places, she<br/>
grooms herself like a cat, she tries to bite bees, she kills all<br/>
newspapers, she screams if you tease her.  If you look at her for a long<br/>
time without saying anything she&#39;ll zoom around the house and bounce off<br/>
the furniture. <br/>

Your post really made me laugh!!! And I thought I had some nutso dogs!!!!<br/>
<br/>
The one I remember the most was Maxie. A 30lb stray that jumped in the back <br/>
of our van when we opened the door on an infamous FL stormy day. She was <br/>
shaking like a leaf. We tried to find and owner and when none was found, she <br/>
found a home with us. The ppor thing, as described by a friend was said to <br/>
look like a bat with legs. She wasn&#39;t the most attractive little dog but <br/>
definitely a lovey one. She was gross in what she liked to get into and we <br/>
had to watch especially around certain times of the month. (nuff said) And <br/>
she would never just go and lie down. You literally had to tell her to. She <br/>
would just stand.....for very long periods of time. Our house then was small <br/>
and it got unerving to see her in the middle of the living room just <br/>
standing there while the cats and other two dogs were alseep. We would have <br/>
to say Maxi, go and lay down and she would snap out of whatever coma she was <br/>
in and then go and settle somewhere. The day she died in my arms, my husband <br/>
and I both cried like babies.<br/>
