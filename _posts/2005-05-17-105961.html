<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246363129">This is from a friend of mine who&#39;s writing a series of novels on the Civil  <br/>
War battles in New Mexico.  Her web site is down there, if that seems  <br/>
interesting to any of you. Pati&#39;s one of my singing partners, and I&#39;ve known her  <br/>
since she was a teenager and I wasn&#39;t much older.  She said she was going  to be <br/>
a writer and she is!  But further, she&#39;s become an expert in her  field of <br/>
historical interest, so if you get The History Channel and you&#39;re  interested in <br/>
this sort of thing, here&#39;s a little background you can&#39;t get  elsewhere. <br/>
(Chris is her husband, also in our singing group):<br/>

Chris spotted this listing for Wild West Tech on The History Channel.   Not <br/>
only did they actually pay me, it appears they&#39;re finally going to air  the <br/>
episode.  Look sharp or you&#39;ll miss me - I have six or eight sound  bites, <br/>
total time approx. 15 seconds.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The Civil War is thought of as a conflict between  North and South. But the <br/>
West figured into it, too. There were more than  2,000 battles west of the <br/>
Mississippi River--action stretched clear to the  California coast. The <br/>
rugged, wide-open West presented special challenges  for armies. Soldiers <br/>
had to be hearty--able to maneuver themselves and  equipment through ice, <br/>
snow, and mountain passes. They often improvised with  whatever they had. <br/>
Shovels and belts proved especially useful. Then there  were the arid <br/>
plains, which required armies to adapt in different ways. Men  had to cover <br/>
great distances in order to get food, arms, and other supplies.  We&#39;ll take <br/>
a look at the weapons, clothing, transportation, and tools  employed on the <br/>
Civil War&#39;s Western Front. Host: David Carradine. TVPG  V<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200238119">Over the summer Apple Stores offer 2 (or 3?) hour sessions helping kids  <br/>
explore iPhoto (making a slide show to burn onto a CD), iMovie (cutting  <br/>
and pasting clips and making transitions and titles between scenes,  <br/>
adding music) and GarageBand (putting various rhythms and instruments  <br/>
together). And they&#39;re *FREE* :-) (Of course they&#39;re hoping kids will  <br/>
persuade their parents to spring for new Macs or at least iLife :-)  <br/>
Kathryn took them last year and she had a lot of fun. Most parents  <br/>
dropped their kids off but I stayed and they let me make a movie too  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193437328">I tried the links Joyce provided but they didn&#39;t work for me.  So, I  <br/>
did a little digging around and came up with this one that might work  <br/>
better for some others:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/retail/camp/">http://www.apple.com/retail/camp/</a><br/>
