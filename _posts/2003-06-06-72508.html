<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271389833">Oh I love these stories!<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days ago, the kids and I went to the mall to escape the horrible <br/>
heat...still no ac!  We went into J C Penney&#39;s to go to the bathroom.  <br/>
Nicholette was in the stall already and I walked into the stall next to her <br/>
after I changed Chloe&#39;s diaper.  She had been in there a long time and I <br/>
heard lots of &#39;air&#39; and diarrhea sounds.  I asked her if her tummy was <br/>
hurting her again (she had recently been sick) and she said, &quot;No, I feel <br/>
fine Mom&quot;.  A couple of minutes passed and I still heard the noises along <br/>
with slight grunting noises.  So I say, &quot;Nic honey, are you sure your tummy <br/>
is fine?  It&#39;s sounds like you are still having diarrhea.&quot;  &quot;No Mom, I&#39;m all <br/>
done, I&#39;m washing my hands now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh my!  It dawned on me that it wasn&#39;t Nicholette sitting next to me but <br/>
some poor woman with terrible diarrhea!!!  ROFLOL!!!  I don&#39;t know what the <br/>
hell came over me but I started laughing hysterically out loud so bad the <br/>
woman started laughing too, which made the *noises* even worse!   Of course, <br/>
all my kids were in the bathroom with me and we were ALL dying!  I didn&#39;t <br/>
know if I should apologize or hide out until she left or hurry like hell and <br/>
bolt!  Ended up, I apologized, while *trying* to contain my laughter and we <br/>
bolted!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m such a pitiful example to my kids sometimes! LOL!<br/>

<br/>
I have no idea.   Other than the fact that I have a gob of children, so <br/>
farts are just as common humor as knock-knock jokes! :)<br/>
<br/>
Ugh, and believe you me, I&#39;m READY to get the house situation settled.  I <br/>
barely have time to eat, much less get online and play catch up on emails.  <br/>
I&#39;ve deleted so much it hurts to think of what I may have missed. :(<br/>
<br/>
Hehe, as I&#39;m writing, my daughter is singing the spelling of her name.  <br/>
L-A-U-R-E-N<br/>
LOL  My Caeleb is playing with &quot;Naked&quot; (the latest name for the blue <br/>
jay...har har) and trying to make bird noises at him.  &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I took the day off from house hunting and the kids and I went shopping, out <br/>
to eat and to the park.  We really needed the break!  I&#39;m having such a <br/>
dilema as to which house to push forward with.  One is smaller than the <br/>
other by about 550 sq.ft. but the smaller one is better built and VERY <br/>
nicely decorated and the kids room&#39;s are all upstairs, which is nice for <br/>
drop-in company.  The larger house is $250 cheaper per month and has a <br/>
gameroom but the neighborhood isn&#39;t as nice or safe and it&#39;s close to school <br/>
and highway trafic.  High School traffic, btw.  We have the opton to buy <br/>
both at the end of a two year lease, or sooner so that&#39;s good about both.  <br/>
The cheaper, bigger house is closer to my husband&#39;s work, :::psh:::, not <br/>
that that makes much difference since he&#39;s rarely AT work, or home for that <br/>
matter.  Ick, I need a magic wand.<br/>
<br/>
I went ahead and filled out the application for the smaller house.  It&#39;s not <br/>
really small, but compared to the other....Hopefully I&#39;ll know more by <br/>
Monday.  I&#39;m just ready for this to be over. :(<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, who OH OH OH got the summer Pandora&#39;s Box Magazine and WOW, I love <br/>
it!  Finally, a magazine all about ME!!!  Wehooooo!  I&#39;m thinking of sending <br/>
my grandmother a subscription for fun!  It would be nice for her to see that <br/>
I&#39;m not the ONLY unschooling, unmedicating, unassisted birthing, <br/>
unconventional woman alive! &lt;BWG&gt;  Plus, I&#39;ve *always* wanted to be a writer <br/>
and I could possibly send in an essay/article and have a chance at being <br/>
published!  I can always dream........<br/>

makes my day to hear stuff like this! I love to hear when people <br/>
connect with the magazine!<br/>
<br/>
And PLEASE do send in an essay/article. Most, if not all of the <br/>
articles in every issue are written by parents. Not always writers, <br/>
just parents with experiences to share! Did you birth unassisted? <br/>
You can always begin by sending in your birth story! :)<br/>

I may do that!  My first six were all run-of-the-mill hospital births, <br/>

Anyway!  I really do love the magazine!  I&#39;m impressed beyond words!  I&#39;ve <br/>
always wanted to open up a shop locally and you have hit upon the theme of <br/>
my store!  Maybe someday, if I ever do, I&#39;ll carry your magazine!!! :) LOL<br/>

Jennifer...off to start scratching out my birth stories ;)<br/>

TIME FLIES!<br/>
I thought for a second &quot;HOW could she know she&#39;ll be having a baby in <br/>
December &#39;03?!  Must be a great planner, or a month pregnant!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then slowly (two seconds) it came to me that it&#39;s already June &#39;03.<br/>

Whooooie!  I have to go to an August conference any minute now!<br/>
