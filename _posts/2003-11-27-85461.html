Christmas so it&#39;s part of our penance to have to have them so close together<br/>
in order to celebrate Christmas. ;-)<br/>

It&#39;s a harvest festival.  They live practically in the arctic, so their <br/>
harvest is earlier.<br/>

We usually have Thanksgiving warm enough to go out and play, and this year it <br/>
was way freezing.   Dry, nothing artsy like snow or even rain, but COLD cold. <br/>
  I&#39;m thrilled that we have a fireplace.   Giddy.<br/>
<br/>
It will probably warm up again.  But for a stuffingish thing I made I was <br/>
able to use onion greens from the back yard.  I brushed fallen leaves off them <br/>
and snipped lots of greens.  That&#39;s the extent of my personal harvest. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Real harvest festivals have to do with real harvests.  Real federal holidays <br/>
have to do with... whatever.  Symbolic myth-building culture-shaping something <br/>
or other.  And four-day weekends.<br/>

It&#39;s 9am here and I&#39;m thinking I might go and put the air-conditioner on. My<br/>
kids have been complaining that it&#39;s too hot to go outside and play! We are<br/>
still feeling festive though. the tree is going up today and the kids woke<br/>
up an hour or two earlier than usual bursting with excitement. Halfway<br/>
through my morning cup of tea I&#39;m beginning to wake up and share their<br/>
enthusiasm. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
