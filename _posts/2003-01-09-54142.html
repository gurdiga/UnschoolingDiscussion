<div id="ygrps-yiv-630770742">&lt;&lt; &gt; Sorry, should have said&quot;You are mature enough to learn how to read.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; I don&#39;t know about you, but I know my children and what they are <br/>
 &gt;capable of. Two summers ago, my then 11 year old asked me to please <br/>
 &gt;make him some toast. He&#39;s a smart lad with hands and feet that work, I <br/>
 &gt;told him to make it himself because I was busy. He whined that he <br/>
 &gt;didn&#39;t know<br/>
  &gt; how. Well, I realized that I was allowing him to become helpless.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What happened to the value of mothering? IMO, kids (and adults too)<br/>
sometimes have a hard time expressing how they feel, and the only way<br/>
they find is by *regressing* a bit, if you know what I mean, and asking<br/>
things that may seem inappropriate to their age. They simply want to be<br/>
mothered, taken care of, comforted somehow and if your response is, &quot;you<br/>
do it, I don&#39;t have time for you,&quot; or decide to grumpily do what they&#39;re<br/>
asking you to, the message is, &quot;what you are trying to express here, or<br/>
what you are trying to be comforted for is not important.&quot; I mean, don&#39;t<br/>
you feel like that sometimes, too, like being comforted and taken care <br/>
of? I think it has to do with LOVE and not with maturity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; So I taught him how to make buttered toast! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think he didn&#39;t know how and you had to *teach* him? My<br/>
daughter knows how just by seeing me do it  many times, and she is 4. I<br/>
truly believe his reasons for asking were different than what you<br/>
perceived.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I suppose I could have kept buttering his toast till he turns 49 (and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; I&#39;m dead), but I have better things to do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you give that same response to your husband if he asks you to butter<br/>
his toast, or do something for him, or to a friend? Haven&#39;t you ever <br/>
asked anyone to do something for you that you can actually do yourself? <br/>
I am bit surprised by your comments. You sound so cold!<br/>
<br/>
I have nothing better to do than being a mom, it is my priority and I <br/>
love it (even though I love other things as well). And I have nothing <br/>
better to do than trying to be a better, more loving individual...<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; &gt; I always say to my children, that I am happy to do for you what you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; cannot do, but----I have a life too, and it&#39;s of equal value, and<br/>
  &gt; therefore I should not do things for you that you are capable of doing<br/>
  &gt; yourself.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If what we want is to build a relationship based on trust and<br/>
understanding, the attitude that they *should* do it themselves when<br/>
they ask for help (read support, love, companionship, comfort,<br/>
togetherness, etc.) certainly doesn&#39;t help. I am not sure where you are<br/>
coming from and what kind of relationship you want to establish with<br/>
your kids, but from what you say I get the impression that it&#39;s one of<br/>
total *independence* (read distance) from each other.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; &gt; If I&#39;m feeling generous, then I&#39;ll do things and that&#39;s a gift for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; both of us. Now my son is 13, and can do all kinds of things like<br/>
  &gt; butter his own toast and read to himself.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Generous??? That sounds more like it&#39;s a gift for him, since you&#39;re only<br/>
being &quot;generous.&quot; Again, you seem so distant and cold to your kids...<br/>
<br/>
I personally believe that this culture puts too much stress on kids<br/>
becoming &quot;independent.&quot; Right after they&#39;re born they&#39;re supposed to go<br/>
in a separate bed, in a separate room, separated by school, and later a<br/>
job and a new family. No wonder why this society is so incredibly<br/>
dysfunctional. People are continuously pushed away since they&#39;re born!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great to see your kids grow and become autonomous, but at<br/>
their own pace and within the community of their family. I&#39;ve always<br/>
wondered, what&#39;s the rush to kick them out???<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; &gt; Just this evening, we snuggled up and I read the last 3 pages<br/>
of his<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; book to him, the rest of which he read independently. Reading those 3<br/>
  &gt; pages together were a pleasure for both of us, (followed by an<br/>
  &gt; interesting discussion) . They were a pleasure because I didn&#39;t have<br/>
  &gt; to do it, and he didn&#39;t have to ask me to. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe they were a pleasure for you for those reasons, but they might<br/>
have been a pleasure for him because in spite of being able to do it on<br/>
his own, you were WITH him. Just a thought.<br/>

I&#39;ve been having problems with my e-mail. I had to post this at the<br/>
yahoo site. I am not changing identities... ;-)<br/>
