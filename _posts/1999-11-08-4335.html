 </span></blockquote>buying cheese and eating it with crackers (figuratively) I feel<br/>
frustrated, ie, nothing accomplished, nothing gained by the experience. <br/>
So what was the point, what was the profit of doing it at all?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The profit is tremendous if they learned that there is more to cheese<br/>
than orange cheddar.  (Why are there so many different cheeses in the<br/>
world?)  If they tried a new food because of it, that is great too (one<br/>
of mine is still at that &quot;if I&#39;ve never tasted it before I don&#39;t like it&quot;<br/>
stage)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But I know I don&#39;t approach our unit studies this way.  My dd wanted<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to study the ocean - it was a direct request.  So, I&#39;m trying to help her<br/>
do this.  We have made a posterboard of the ocean floor, put animals in<br/>
it and studied some of the animals.  We will pursue it more through<br/>
library books as long as they are interested. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that this could be an example of child-led learning, you<br/>
are just calling it unit studies.  For me, unschooling means that I don&#39;t<br/>
force them to do things in a schoolish way.  So if we were doing this<br/>
ocean study with you, I wouldn&#39;t require them to memorize terminology or<br/>
write a report on it or even spend time at it unless they wanted too. <br/>
Maybe it could even include a trip to the ocean.  (Easy for us, we are<br/>
only a few hours away)  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But do you know what, she would do nothing about it if I just looked<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at her and said &quot;great honey - study the ocean!&quot;  So what do you do<br/>
differently when your child wants to study a subject?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure she wouldn&#39;t?  And would it matter if she didn&#39;t?  Maybe you<br/>
need to ask more questions.  &quot;What would you like to know about the<br/>
ocean?&quot;  &quot;How do you think you could find this information?&quot;  &quot;Is there<br/>
something I can do to help you get started?&quot;  I don&#39;t think you should<br/>
have to apologize if you want to study the ocean with her!  But if you<br/>
are doing most of the work, then whose project is it really?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;So as adults with our (hopefully) mature brains we ought to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>whizzes.   However this is not the case, at times I think I&#39;m even losing<br/>
what I once knew. What gives?<br/>
Laura&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you never knew it in the first place?  I was great at memorizing<br/>
factoids for tests, but the majority was never really &quot;learned&quot; at all! <br/>
Also, remember that living with children is demanding!  I don&#39;t mean this<br/>
in a negative way, but when there are usually children around you,<br/>
wanting you for one thing or another, it can be hard to focus.  So don&#39;t<br/>
be too hard on yourself.<br/>

<br/>
Sorry to quote out of context -- <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think either or any of you should have to apologize.  Period.  I <br/>
think you should do what works for you and yours and call it whatever the <br/>
heck you want to -- un or relaxed or the man in the moon.   It seems to me <br/>
that what works changes over time and subject and from child to child anyway. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to sound impatient but it seems to me that if your method is <br/>
working for you, that should be enough soul searching.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought unschooling meant never having to say you&#39;re sorry . . . ha ha ha !!<br/>

<br/>
i agree with this theory, in my case i didnt commit to long term mem much <br/>
from school situations.  but, to look at it another way, it is hard to <br/>
quantify what you do know.   like things i learned by incorporating into my <br/>
perspective.  maybe you were referring to facts but there is so much we have <br/>
really learned throughout our lives that cannot be rattled off in a list or <br/>
win a game of trivial pursuit.<br/>

touches it!).  But that aside, I did learn today that she does not really<br/>
know how to ask for the help she needs.  And I have to learn how to listen<br/>
and ask the right questions.  Today she said she needed more &quot;structure&quot;<br/>
when  it came to reading.  ?????????  She reads all the time!  So needless<br/>
to say alarms went off.  Bottom line (10 minutes and 20 questions later) I<br/>
discovered she was uncertain about how to break down words into proper<br/>
syllables and found it tedious - so she would just skip the word when<br/>
reading.  But hey, I rejoice in the fact that at least it bothers her (it<br/>
didn&#39;t use to a year ago!)  So, I&#39;ll do some syllable breakdowns with her<br/>
(perhaps steer her in the direction of some pages in a book on the subject)<br/>

You hit it on the head as far as I&#39;m concerned - yet, I do understand that<br/>
many do not feel that  these types of activities (unit studies or whatever<br/>
you want to call them) are to contrived.  Being new to this whole thing of<br/>
unschooling (less than 2 years) I guess I&#39;m striving for I know not what!<br/>
Yikes!  What a path to travel.<br/>
<br/>
Actually this conversation came about by a post that questioned why we<br/>
would use unit studies in the first place. :O)  Great conversation by the way!<br/>
