<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337913537">Thank you, Ned....._that_ was very helpful, not to mention inspiring :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently joined this list to learn more about unschooling.  My dh<br/>
and I have a three year old little girl and I&#39;ve come to understand that<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; is what we&#39;ve been doing ever since she was born!  <br/>
<br/>
Now that she&#39;s getting older, and I&#39;m getting more involved w/our local<br/>
homeschoolers and field trips, etc., I just need to build up my own<br/>
confidence that &#39;I&#39; can deschool MYSELF.  It&#39;s hard, you know?  My<br/>
idealist side knows this is exactly how we want our Emma to<br/>
learn....with us acting more as facilitators, definitely not as her<br/>
teachers.  <br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s that old &#39;schooled&#39; side of me who worries that if we do,<br/>
will Em learn all the things she might &#39;need&#39; to know, say, to enter<br/>
college.  I think, &quot;What about memorizing her multiplication tables?&quot;.<br/>
I never did learn half of mine and still find myself counting sometimes<br/>
on my fingers (and that really embarrasses and aggravates me and only<br/>
makes me wish I&#39;d been &#39;taught&#39; better....even though I always hated<br/>
math).<br/>
<br/>
Then adding to my worries... I heard several unschoolers at my local<br/>
homeschoolers group say that in hindsight they wished they had &#39;taught&#39;<br/>
their children the &#39;3 R&#39;s&#39;....They suggested unschooling for &#39;most of<br/>
the child&#39;s time&#39;, but also doing &#39;some&#39; teaching that you come up with<br/>
(making it fun but still &#39;you&#39;re&#39; the one instigating it).  What are<br/>
your feelings on this, and what has been your experience?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think it is detrimental, for instance, that a child totally<br/>
uninterested in math not learn any math?  And is it necessary for a<br/>
child uninterested in certain subjects to learn about those subjects<br/>
anyway?  If not, how would this affect them if they chose to go to<br/>
college later?  In other words, IS there a certain &#39;core&#39; knowledge that<br/>
they &#39;need&#39; to know and understand??<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure my questions may sound terribly naive to most of you<br/>
veterans...but please, be kind :)  I admit I know very little about all<br/>
this...really, only that I love my daughter more than life itself, and<br/>
want with all my heart for her to love learning and have a wonderful<br/>
childhood and life!  You guys are the experts, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m<br/>
here....to learn from you :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh....I have just today checked out John Holt&#39;s &#39;How Children Learn&#39;<br/>
from our local library.  Any other recommendations?  I saw a book on<br/>
amazon called something like &#39;homeschooling our children, deschooling<br/>
ourselves&#39;....or something like that.  Anyone read this one?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is stopping you from working on memorizing them now?  Sure it will take<br/>
some effort but no more than when you were 10yo and probably less because<br/>
now you know how useful they are.  On the other hand, has not having your<br/>
tables memorized stopped you from accomplishing anything you really wanted<br/>
to do?  If not, then how vital is it really to memorize your tables?  Sure<br/>
it is convenient but thousands of people are functioning quite well without<br/>
having them memorized and thousands more can only do their tables by rote.<br/>
Our daughter wanted to learn her tables because I repeatedly demonstarted to<br/>
her how much quicker I could work things out than if I had to use only<br/>
adding.  Any time I have wanted her to learn something that I knew she would<br/>
have trouble appreciating the value of I made a big deal, for a few days, of<br/>
how I used a particular bit of knowledge and she would want to copy what I<br/>
was doing.  This opened up the opportunity to share knowledge.  The instinct<br/>
to copy  is one of the best kept parenting/homeschooling secrets.  Yes, it<br/>
is manipulative but then isn&#39;t all parenting about manipulating our children<br/>
to be acceptable to us and hopefully the wider community?  Anyway, shouldn&#39;t<br/>
we be modelling behaviours, attitudes, etc. we want our children to emulate?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have a problem with instigating a learning experience.  Don&#39;t we all<br/>
do this when we go on field trips? Unless a child is deliberately exposed to<br/>
some sorts knowledge they may never know it exists.  It depends on how<br/>
important I believe it is that a child gain a certain type of knowledge.  If<br/>
I consider it vital I will insist the child learn it while being mindful of<br/>
maturity and readiness to learn. If I think it is really useful for the<br/>
child to know about something I would try to ignite interest in a variety of<br/>
ways.  However, I would hesitate to push the child to learn where there is<br/>
no interest when the subject is broached and back off rapidly if there is<br/>
resistance.  I then try and work out why there is resistance/lack of<br/>
interest and find a way around it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you think it is detrimental, for instance, that a child totally<br/>
&gt; uninterested in math not learn any math?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would be extremely difficult for anyone to function effectively in our<br/>
society with no mathematical knowledge.  In the adult world we rarely need<br/>
more than basic calculating skills.  Just about everything we need to know<br/>
mathematically can be learned from real world activities such as price<br/>
comparisons when grocery shopping, working out what time to leave home to<br/>
get to an appointment on the other side of town.  I have always encouraged<br/>
children to try to figure out the answer to their own questions or if I<br/>
provide the answer I talk them through how I worked it out.  This does not<br/>
have to come across as teaching it is more about sharing information.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And is it necessary for a child uninterested in certain subjects to learn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about those subjects<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; anyway?  If not, how would this affect them if they chose to go to college<br/>
 </span></blockquote>later?  In other words, &gt;IS there a certain &#39;core&#39; knowledge that they<br/>
&#39;need&#39; to know and understand??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only time I can think off that a child should learn &quot;subjects&quot; that have<br/>
no interest for them is if it is part of achieving a bigger goal.  With this<br/>
in mind,  a child who wants to go to college would be sensible to approach<br/>
prospective colleges a year or two in advance of applying for entry to find<br/>
out what each requires to be considered for eligibilty.  That allows plenty<br/>
of time to ensure any gaps are filled so the child can demonstrate their<br/>
knowledge.  If college entry is the goal the motivation to study the<br/>
required subjects, no matter how &quot;boring&quot;, should be high.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;core knowledge&quot; I think things such as inter-personal skills and<br/>
general life skills are probably more important than the academic ones as<br/>
intellectual learning can occur at any age where emotional learning is much<br/>
harder to change once past childhood.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not so sure about being an expert.  Like you, I know and cherish my<br/>
daughter and want the best for her.  If you see your daughter&#39;s education as<br/>
an adventure you are both taking part in rather than something you do to her<br/>
it is unlikely you will go far wrong.<br/>

Children at Home&quot; by Alan Thomas published by Cassel ISBN 0-304-70179-3<br/>
(hardback)  0-304-70180-7 (paperback).  The author conducted a systematic<br/>
enquiry into how a hundred families educate their children at home.  His<br/>
purpose was to examine whether individualized learning works as well in<br/>
practice as predicted in theory.  Homeschooling families were the only place<br/>
where this type of learning is the norm rather than contrived as in<br/>
experiments in schools.  He ultimately questions a number of assumptions<br/>
about learning that traditional schooling is based on.<br/>

Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves - by Allison McKee<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t finished this book yet (just came this week) but I HIGHLY recommend <br/>
it to new unschoolers and anyone else who likes to read about the experiences <br/>
of real families. <br/>
<br/>
The best part of the book so far is that the author details how every time <br/>
she panicked and introduced required learning, she interfered with the real <br/>
learning going on in her children&#39;s lives.<br/>

You can&#39;t make a child learn something.  You can &quot;insist&quot; that they look at a <br/>
page or write something or recite something, but none of that can be <br/>
insistance on learning.  <br/>
If insistance helped, school would have no failures whatsoever.<br/>

for help with laundry, etc.  Also, we do the checkbook in front of the<br/>

one, but I&#39;ve lost it for months at a time and not noticed &lt;G&gt;. <br/>

My kids have their own accounts with ATM cards. Roya works a lot and makes <br/>
good money and it gets direct-deposited into her account- she is 17. Roxana <br/>
is 14 and gets $14 per month from us and also makes some extra by creating <br/>
flyers and announcements and website stuff for friends and family once in a <br/>
while. Rosie is 11 and gets $11 per month from us and somehow manages to earn <br/>
other money doing odd jobs for people. They always have a bit of money saved <br/>
up - occasionally get $20 for a gift from a relative, for example. They don&#39;t <br/>
seem to have any trouble saving it or spending it on what they want. <br/>

Oh - and they know ALL about compound interest -- they learned that because <br/>
the points earned playing NeoPets games online are compounded.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604901649"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There ARE basic things that a person NEEDS to know<br/>
&gt; in order to live well<br/>
&gt; in various different societies.   I<br/>
&gt; view it my responsibility to help my children know<br/>
&gt; these certain things<br/>
&gt; by the time they are living on their own.  To do<br/>
&gt; this, I sometimes ask<br/>
&gt; for help with laundry, etc.  Also, we do the<br/>
&gt; checkbook in front of the<br/>
&gt; kids- how can a kid see this without asking what in<br/>
&gt; the world you are<br/>
&gt; doing?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree. <br/>
<br/>
I often will refer to a book I read 13 yrs.ago, &quot;The<br/>
Continnum COncept&quot; by Jean Liedloff. Jean studied the<br/>
Yequana indians in the Amazon jungle, and saw how they<br/>
raised their children. They were never &quot;coerced&quot; to do<br/>
anything, but trusted that their innate natures would<br/>
guide them into participation into the workings of the<br/>
tribe. <br/>
<br/>
This is how I view unschooling. The &quot;work&quot; of the<br/>
tribe is very visible to the youger members, and they<br/>
naturally imitate. (Remember how our toddlers would<br/>
pick up a broom and try to help?)<br/>
<br/>
I can go on about that forever, but I&#39;ll just say<br/>
here, in my own experience, I would often find myself<br/>
putting pressure on the boys to &quot;do&quot; school<br/>
stuff...and it occured to me last year that I think<br/>
was envious of their opportunity to pursue whatever<br/>
their interests were. SO, (duh) why don&#39;t I pursue my<br/>
own interests, and lay off them? I started some<br/>
projects of own, making sure I was very conspicuous<br/>
about it! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Jean Liedloff explains that it is far more natural and<br/>
interesting to a child to be in the presence of an<br/>
adult who is involved in his/her own activites, and<br/>
welcomed to join in if desired, than to be the center<br/>
of attention and focused upon exclusively. So, I&#39;ll<br/>
spread my stuff all over the table, or exclaim loudly<br/>
when I&#39;ve discovered something cool..and sometimes<br/>
they&#39;ll be curious about what I&#39;m doing, and ask to<br/>
help. (Or not..but it&#39;s okay).  It&#39;s especially hard<br/>
for little ones to resist joining in, if mom&#39;s doing<br/>
something &quot;fun&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
Peace, Gina<br/>

GOOD ONE!<br/>
<br/>
My boys are going to a big SCA campout this weekend.  My husband and I are <br/>
not.  Holly is not.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a big difference.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty just left with two other teenagers.  I filled out paperwork to give <br/>
somene else legal guardianship of Marty for the weekend as the rules <br/>
required.  We helped them pack and checklist, and now they&#39;re gone.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s leaving at 7:00 or so with the knight to whom he&#39;s squired.  So <br/>
they&#39;ll both be at the same place, but not together, and neither with parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I WILL be doing laundry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341935359">Dear Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Do you mind asking Kirby for me what are some basic<br/>
things I should know about anime other than it being a<br/>
Japanese cartoon.  My six year old daughter is<br/>
suddenly interested in Sailor Moon so I wanted to give<br/>
some background information but I don&#39;t know where to<br/>
start.  There were hundreds of Sailor Moon websites,<br/>
too much for me to go through one by one.  Could you<br/>
ask him what the appeal is?  Why the big eyes on the<br/>
character ;)?  How does it compare to &quot;American&quot;<br/>
cartoons?  Anything would be appreciated ... perhaps<br/>
he knows a good website?  Mahalo! Dawn<br/>

happen. And that you&#39;ll miss something if you don&#39;t keep watching. ;-) (In<br/>

the Japanese do. ;-) The eyes just indicate something about the character.<br/>
