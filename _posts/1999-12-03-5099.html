&lt;&lt;Nice to meet you too, Carrie.  I believe that Homeschooling is one of the<br/>
<br/>
best ways to help kids with multiple allergies and/or sensitivities.  In a<br/>
<br/>
very real and important sense we can control their environment much more<br/>
<br/>
than if they were in IS. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really grateful for homeschooling, too.  My son has asthma and pet <br/>
allergies, plus pretty mild food allergies.  We&#39;ve had the experience of <br/>
going to the emergency room from 2am to 6, and then having James be mostly <br/>
well, but exhausted.  If he was enrolled in school, I have to wonder if the <br/>
school would hassle me for keeping him home to school to sleep the next day.<br/>
<br/>
James is shy, having to tell the teacher he needs medicine and then go to the <br/>
school nurse to get it, when his breathing flares up, would be difficult for <br/>
him, especially in front of all the other kids.  I&#39;m happy to skip that.  <br/>
(Around here schools are so freaked out about drugs I&#39;ve heard that they <br/>
won&#39;t let kids carry their own inhalers.  Yuck!)<br/>
