&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Some questions from a Newbie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Welcome Michelle,<br/>

&gt; and 2 cats.  Some books that I can recomend on hsing are: The Homeschooling<br/>
&gt; Book of Answers by Linda Dobson; The Big Book of Learning-Getting<br/>

daughters, wife, dog, lovebird, snakes, and miscellaneous -- I&#39;m also the author<br/>
of that Skylark book, but don&#39;t let that scare you -- we&#39;re all working hard at<br/>
figuring this out.<br/>

Actually, I&#39;m going to disappear from this list for awhile -- we live in<br/>
