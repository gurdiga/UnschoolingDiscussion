<br/>
Yes, but I think other Peabody hotels do it now too....<br/>
<br/>
It all started in Memphis.  It is SO funny to see a fancy lobby full<br/>
of people, craning their necks towards the elevator. At exactly 11am,<br/>
the door opens and out waddle these ducks, who walk down a red carpet<br/>
and jump in the lobby fountain (solid marble) to swim all day.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve stopped there twice, it&#39;s really fun. Once, they gave the kids<br/>
little duck pins to wear. My children think it&#39;s quite funny that<br/>
ducks have their own penthouse upstairs somewhere...<br/>

Yes, all three of them--Orlando, Memphis and Little Rock (which used to be  <br/>
the infamous Excelsior where Bill and Paula had their thing.)<br/>
 <br/>
You can go up in the elevator and visit the duck palace on the roof.   The <br/>
one in Little Rock is all glassed in, but the Memphis one is quaint, and the  <br/>
view of the river is worth the trip.<br/>
 <br/>
Next time you go, you really should go upstairs on the roof.<br/>
