<br/>
I learned as much outside the classroom as in.<br/>
<br/>
Recorder-playing and Renaissance music, more ballads than I had known before <br/>
I went there, how to throw pots.  But even in class I learned a ton of things <br/>
I still pursue and use.  Learning theory, applied psychology, linguistics, <br/>
Shakespeare, Chaucer (that has tied in with lots of things; still does), <br/>
cultural anthropology, comparative religion.  Some of those things I was <br/>
interested in before.  More, I knew nothing about.  But I kept looking into <br/>
them after I left school.<br/>
