Just  wondering how she and anyone else down that way fared with <br/>
Ivan.   Hoping all is well.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I talked with Ren today. They have phone, but not electricity. Power may  not <br/>
be restored for 2-3 weeks. But the grocery store, hospitals, and gas  <br/>
stations have power.<br/>
 <br/>
Her yard was trashed---littered with debris, but her house  was practically <br/>
untouched by wind or water. She feels very lucky. They&#39;re  all safe and happy <br/>
to be home. <br/>
 <br/>
Pensacola Beach, where the hotel is, is unaccessible; mandatory evacuation  <br/>
and the bridges are out, so no one can get on to check it out.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re not yet ruling out P&#39;cola for next year&#39;s conference. The hotels  *say* <br/>
they&#39;ll be up and running by the spring. We&#39;ll wait to make decisions  until <br/>
we hear what the real scoop is---maybe another month or so.<br/>
 <br/>
If you want to send her cards or letters, e-mail me privately. I&#39;ll be  happy <br/>
to give you her address or phone number.<br/>
 <br/>
She says she misses everyone---and thanks for all the good wishes.<br/>
