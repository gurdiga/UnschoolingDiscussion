<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this really depends upon the preschool. I sent<br/>
my dd to preschool when she turned 2 1/2 even though<br/>
we planned to unschool. I needed the space because ds<br/>
was born. It was a very constructive and well paid<br/>
more than just a baysitter in a time when I needed it.<br/>
My dd became very attached to all the teachers at her<br/>
preschool. She loves them all and still talks about<br/>
them. She got tons of positive energy from all the<br/>
teachers at a time when I was very low energy after<br/>
the birth of little brother.<br/>
<br/>
The preschool had very little over control structure.<br/>
The practiced what is called divergent(I think this is<br/>
right) &#39;curiculum&#39;. When they set up a project and the<br/>
kids wanted to go in a different direction from the<br/>
teachers beginning idea the teachers supported them in<br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
The teachers were also very respectful of all the kids<br/>
feelings. They also help the kids solve disputes<br/>
peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was a very positive experience for my dd.<br/>
But just because it was for her doesn&#39;t mean I think<br/>
everyone should do it.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t need socialization which is forced (which<br/>
is what compulsory education is IMHO)but at some point<br/>
many kids like to be social because being social is<br/>
human nature. Preschool allowed my dd that outlet and<br/>
gave my tired my introverted self time to recharge<br/>
when I couldn&#39;t find homeschooling community.<br/>
<br/>
Not all preschools are bad. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646917113">Good point, Samantha. I hadn&#39;t considered it. I also<br/>
want to say that I think a preschool would reallyl NOT<br/>
work for my kids or me, but I know it is a help to<br/>
some people. If you find the right one. The one you<br/>
used sounds nice. That divergent curiculum thing is<br/>
lovely sounding. Plus I truly know the meaning of<br/>
fatigue and being introverted so I can totally see<br/>
your point there. Glad it worked out for you and your<br/>
family the way it did and proved to help instead of<br/>
hinder. <br/>

calendar. A weekly calendar. ASk him to help you set aside blocks of time in 
that week for things he wants do to. Ask him if he wants to read, watch a 
special program, watch a video, go to the library, etc and see how he does on 
that. It will change from day to day. Tell him its ok if he doesn&#39;t plan every 
single moment. IF a week is too much, sit down each evening and plan the next 
day with him. Not too structured, but loose enough that he can learn to enjoy 
himself. </font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241468299">That has happened with my son and daughter, ages 10<br/>
and 8 respectively. I should NEVER have enrolled them<br/>
in PS. Although they are still lovely children, I<br/>
feel their self confidence was undermined in school. <br/>
I am having a hard time trying to &quot;deschool&quot; them. My<br/>
son, in particular, is having trouble making the<br/>
transition from school to home even though he is all<br/>
for homeschooling. Any suggestions? I just started<br/>
this in January.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to say that this reply is for Linda with the <br/>
LD child too :-)  Unschooling (for me, anyway) isn&#39;t <br/>
about teaching our children what we think they need to <br/>
know or even skills we think they&#39;ll need to use.  It&#39;s <br/>
about following their interests and trusting them, that <br/>
if they need or want to know something they&#39;ll find a <br/>
way to find it out.  Our role is as facilitator, like <br/>
the great stories about the train-obsessed boys!  Those <br/>
&#39;let&#39;s go look it up!&#39; sessions...  I have a similar <br/>
thing with my dd and dinosaurs atm, we got a DK CD on <br/>
dinosaurs cheap with a newspaper, and now she quotes to <br/>
anyone who&#39;ll listen, and wants to know anything and <br/>
everything there is to know about dinosaurs *grin*  We <br/>
went to the UK&#39;s National Museum of Photography, Film <br/>
and Television on Friday, and she was more interested <br/>
in the model dinosaurs used in 10 million years BC (or <br/>
whatever it&#39;s called!) (oh, we saw the Art of Star Wars <br/>
exhibition while were there, spendy but good, real <br/>
production models of the ships and costumes and stuff, <br/>
wish I hadn&#39;t been dragged round by the kids who wanted <br/>
to look at something else...)  So I don&#39;t do &#39;maths&#39; or <br/>
&#39;reading&#39; or &#39;writing&#39; or any other subject, we just <br/>
live our lives and follow what we&#39;re into.  And you <br/>
know what, it really works!<br/>
<br/>
Maths, Linda, you&#39;ve had great suggestions about how <br/>
you can deal with maths in real-life ways.  Now I <br/>
wonder if you can let go of the idea that it&#39;s <br/>
necessary to think about it in this way, and just do <br/>
those things without turning your life into a series of <br/>
&#39;educational experiences.&#39;  (I think it&#39;s very easy for <br/>
home-edders to fall into this pattern, and it&#39;s a very <br/>
quick route to burn-out.)<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling is a natural process which will occur if <br/>
it&#39;s allowed to.  You can&#39;t deschool your son, nor make <br/>
him deschool, it would defeat the object I think.  <br/>
Given that (can someone back me up on this, I keep <br/>
quoting it and I need to know if others concur) <br/>
deschooling is said to take around a month for each <br/>
year of institutionalised school, you can give both you <br/>
and him at least until August to shed whatever <br/>
preconceptions about learning and issues of self-image <br/>
and self-worth have been gathered in his time at <br/>
school, before even thinking about assessing any <br/>
&#39;progress.&#39;  It&#39;s my guess that in that time, he&#39;ll <br/>
have rediscovered enough of himself and his interests <br/>
to be doing stuff on his own initiative.  Simply <br/>
support whatever he&#39;s doing and try not to worry when <br/>
he doesn&#39;t seem to be doing anything, many people&#39;s <br/>
brains work best when they don&#39;t appear to be doing <br/>
anything!  (Those vacant driftings-off are actually <br/>
times of brain development, or so I read a couple of <br/>
years ago, and it&#39;s important not to interrupt them.  <br/>
Unfortunately if I left my dd until she came out of <br/>
such fugues, the cats would come and eat her tea from <br/>
her plate without her knowing, and we&#39;d never go <br/>
anywhere!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope this helps in some way, even if it&#39;s not <br/>
what either of you were asking in the first place!<br/>
