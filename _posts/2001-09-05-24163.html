<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809263041">Tanya and Dawn have hit on something I would like to ask others their opinion of, bedtimes. What do you folks think about having bedtimes? Do many of you find your children often open up and want to discuss everything personal to them at bedtime? When my children need sone individual time or something is heavy on their hearts, they ask to sleep with me. My husband is on the road most of the time so we usually end up having deep converstions late into the night with the older children. Right now we have bedtimes but I am considering changing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824523829">If it were me I would change the bedtimes. Having those late night talks <br/>
sound really special. Maybe it could be agreed that when Dad is home they <br/>
will need to decide on their own when they want to go to bed and what they <br/>
are going to do if they stay up. Especially if Dad likes to go to bed <br/>
earlier. If he is like my husband he wants it reasonably quiet when he is <br/>
tired. :)<br/>

We have a lax bedtime. The children know that 8 o&#39;clock is bedtime, however, <br/>
they are very rarely in bed by that time. It&#39;s more of a time to be all ready <br/>
for bed, jammies on, teeth brushed, bathed, yadda yadda yadda. Once all the <br/>
kiddies are ready for bed we will sit down to play a family board game, read <br/>
books together, work on a computer project together, play silly games. Daddy <br/>
doesn&#39;t usually get home until around &quot;bedtime&quot; so for us it&#39;s our family <br/>
time. Once the kids are acting tired we suggest they head off to bed. If they <br/>
are in a &quot;so tired i&#39;m irritable&quot; mood we&#39;ll tell them, however most of the <br/>
time we suggest it and they do go. Most days all the kids are in bed by 10pm. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736360401">Good topic Johanna<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have bedtimes. . . I have Lelia (12) and Quinton (2). They both are <br/>
free to go to sleep when they are tired, although sometimes we have to tell <br/>
Quinton he is tired LOL.<br/>
<br/>
When I married Bryan he was of the opinion that Lelia needed a bedtime, even <br/>
though she hadnt had one. We tried it for awhile but it didnt work out. I <br/>
think he just wanted some time with me alone. Now time alone is a rarity, and <br/>
it doesnt seem to be an issue. <br/>
<br/>
My thoughts on it are that no one knows what my bedtime should be but me, and <br/>
I think the same applies to the kids. Of course, there are times when they <br/>
might need a suggestion, because they are so tired. . that happened two night <br/>
ago with Lil. . . she needed me to tell her to go to bed because she was too <br/>
tired to do it herself. . . she laughed and went on her way. I will say we <br/>
have evolved to this though. . . .I needed a re-education on it, and Bryan <br/>
DEFINITELY did.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What do you folks think about having bedtimes?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have them.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby is an all-nighter risk, so I ask him to get to sleep by 5:00 a.m.  <br/>
Sometimes he goes to sleep at 2:00 or 3:00 but he&#39;s almost always the last <br/>
person up, and he gets up at noon.  I&#39;m not loose enough to go TOTALLY <br/>
&quot;whenever&quot; on him, for a few reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) I want the house quiet and not consuming too much electricity when my <br/>
husband goes to work, partly because I want my husband to sneak out quietly <br/>
and not wake up those who are asleep, and if Kirby were awake then there <br/>
would be some passive/agressive noisemaking (on the part of my husband).<br/>
<br/>
2) I want Kirby to wake up at noon because of my delicate sensibilities, and <br/>
so there are times when nobody has to be quiet, and so his friends know when <br/>
they can call.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby works at 8:30 (Saturdays) he gets up at 7:30.<br/>
When he was working a shift at a booth at a convention at 4:00 a.m./morning <br/>
and 5:00 a.m./morning (Bubonicon, a schedule made by a teenaged girl and <br/>
something the boys just went with), he pulled that off too, without my help <br/>
even.<br/>
<br/>
(I tell those stories so people don&#39;t think &quot;no bedtime&quot; means no ability to <br/>
get up if necessary.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly usually goes to bed about 11:30.  Marty usually 1:00 or so.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not much of a sleeper.  Eight hours is too much for me unless I&#39;m sick <br/>
or had some exceptionally strenuous day.  I stay up with or later than Holly, <br/>
and get up 6:00 or so, usually.<br/>
<br/>
When we all lived in a really small house and the kids were littler, we&#39;d get <br/>
it dark and quiet by 10:30 (reading or listening to music in bed was <br/>
happening, often).  Now that&#39;s not necessary.  <br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t have set bedtimes.  Those of us who have &quot;normal&quot; body clocks conk <br/>
out at about 10ish but ds stays up until goodness knows when. But he had to <br/>
get up early, for instance, for an event last week and he set the alarm and <br/>
did great.<br/>

He&#39;s 8.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204751736">Thanks Sandra. How old is Kirby? I think this is my worry sometimes. I<br/>
remember when I was a teenager I would pull all nighters most of the time<br/>
and sleep in till noon. I think you hit the concern with not being able to<br/>
get up early when needed. On Wednesday my kids decided to take classes with<br/>
the homeschool cooperative this year. This means we must be out the door by<br/>
7:15.   I don&#39;t mind giving the kids flexibility with the bedtime, but when<br/>
dad is home, he expects them to turn in early and it becomes an issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141579272">It&#39;s just me and my 3yo and he doesn&#39;t really have a bedtime. But he&#39;s gotten <br/>
pretty good about his routine, 8-9 ish we start the routine. There have been <br/>
some times when I&#39;ve insisted it&#39;s time to go, but I don&#39;t think in general <br/>
it&#39;s a good idea. Mostly it&#39;s very relaxed and he&#39;s content with that. In <br/>
fact, part of our routine is having a &#39;puppet show&#39; with his small toy <br/>
flashlight with the bedroom light off. Then he&#39;s got control and he usually <br/>
gets to a point and says, &#39;let&#39;s go to sleep&#39; and turns it off. Then I, like <br/>
and idiot, get up for my night owl time, sometimes into 2 or 3. I love <br/>
nighttime, sometimes I live in denial that I&#39;ll have to get up early. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I lived with my sister for a short time and her daughter was 4. She had a <br/>
strict routine and bedtime. Which was a fight every single night. Drove me <br/>
nuts. With all the fighting and yelling it generally took 2 hours after the <br/>
actual &#39;bedtime&#39; cutoff anyway. I always thought it silly that she didn&#39;t <br/>
just move the bedtime back, or at least relax a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501633380">&lt;&lt;my dh had a quiet house to himself&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gosh can I relate.  I stay up at night often as well because I enjoy the<br/>
quiet.  But it seems that things may be getting mired down in side issues.<br/>
Dh is really wanting quiet and alone time, seems like bedtime isn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily the issue.  Perhaps a family confab to discuss how to get Daddy<br/>
some downtime?  Something my kids do from time to time is have a sleepover<br/>
with each other.  Turns into something of a slumber party but they are up in<br/>
their rooms.  We are redecorating our garage to give me my &quot;space&quot; (actually<br/>
a work out room).  Perhaps Dh needs a space where he can read or watch tv or<br/>
whatever.  His own little quiet nest for the evenings.<br/>

my children are in bed and I also get it on weekends when my DH runs<br/>
errands with the kids.  Just an hour or two a week is all I need but<br/>
if I don&#39;t get it, I get crabby.<br/>

contraptions off, just long enough for me to get baby calmed down and <br/>

Either way, I just ask for it to be quiet to allow others to sleep.<br/>
I usually play musical beds the first two hours of the night.....babsy boy <br/>

Usually I fall asleep with one of them and move to my bed eventually. Or <br/>
babsy boy wakes me up to nurse again and I&#39;m back in with him. I never sleep <br/>
in the same place all night.<br/>
Crazy eh? But it works for me...and keeps the kids sleeping with their Mommy <br/>
since we don&#39;t have one big bed for everyone. Dh can&#39;t sleep with kids, they <br/>
wake him up.<br/>
But he also will start with Jared or Sierra some nights.<br/>
The quiet time is just my request for helping the house get calm enough for <br/>

&lt;&lt; No, I mean when I see that the baby is needing to sleep, I get the whole <br/>
 bedtime routine started. Her older sister who also needs more sleep than her <br/>
 brother follows right along and my son does also. He just stays up later. <br/>
 Once the routine is going, bedtime is never a problem. This just all happens <br/>
 at different times every night. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is the way we do it too. I don&#39;t see it as coercion, just a request to <br/>
help me get the littler ones calmed down.<br/>
As they get older it changes.<br/>

&lt;&lt; just curious - do you monitor the tv content your 12-year-old is watching <br/>
at<br/>
 2 or 3 AM?  It just seems to me that there could be a lot of REALLY<br/>
 inappropriate stuff on at that hour... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I do not monitor it. He tells me what he sees, and sometimes I&#39;m in there <br/>
watching with him. I know what this guy likes.....Anime, cartoons and the <br/>
Simpson type stuff. He watches movies and History channel and Cop shows <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
If we did get porn (which we don&#39;t) I still wouldn&#39;t worry. Not because I <br/>
don&#39;t think he MIGHT one day be curious, he may, but right now it would <br/>
seriously bother him to see something like that.<br/>
I trust my son. I know that he will only watch what HE is comfortable with <br/>
(may have nothing to do with what I am comfortable with) And because we don&#39;t <br/>
control the content, he has no fascination with any type of show.<br/>
We have offered to watch Braveheart with him and he declines. Will rarely <br/>
watch anything rated &quot;R&quot;. Today he said &quot;I don&#39;t watch rated R movies&quot; and I <br/>
asked why. He said that there wasn&#39;t much in the &quot;R&quot; category he thought he <br/>
could handle.<br/>
HE feels uncomfortable with too much violence mainly.  Very sensitive about <br/>
people violence. He said he doesn&#39;t mind if there are alien guts being blown <br/>
all over the place but human violence bothers him deeply.<br/>
So much for the theory that if you let them choose anything, they&#39;ll choose <br/>
the worst stuff out there eh?<br/>

channel hop bits with sex in seem to build up gradually. My kids all <br/>
hide behind cushions if anyone even holds hands on TV! I did a <br/>
channel hopping exercise earlier. 9 times out of 10 it seems that <br/>
any channels are showing commercials. Not once did I find <br/>
anything naughty and the one horor film that was on &#39;Aliens 3&#39; was <br/>
at a bit where people were having a discussion. I couldn&#39;t find <br/>
anything naughty on at all. Even the Oxygen channel which <br/>
advertised a show called &#39;women and sex&#39; had two women sitting <br/>
on a couch wittering and giggling.<br/>
Wat could possible be on that would &#39;traumatise&#39; someone? Sex in <br/>
movies is all funny camera angles and heavy breathing and isn&#39;t <br/>
traumatic either. I find the commercials more traumatic than <br/>
anything else mainly cos they make me want to bang my head <br/>
against a wall.<br/>

hours stems from a circle of things. I am afraid of the dark and when I do <br/>
sleep I have nightmares because I was abused as a child so because of not <br/>
being able to sleep at night anyway, when I worked, I always worked the night <br/>
shift. So now my body (even after almost four years of not working, even part <br/>
time.) won&#39;t allow me to go to sleep most nights before 2 or 3 and many <br/>
nights before 4. I think I have passed this late night, thing on to my kids. <br/>
I have also noticed that Moly will go to bed as late as midnight or 1, and <br/>
get up most mornings by 6 or 7. Jack will go to bed at most anytime, but gets <br/>
up most nights and plays for a few hours and then goes back to sleep. I have <br/>
often wondered if I should try and adjust their sleep cycles. Any thoughts on <br/>
this?<br/>

develop their own sleep patterns that suit them best. Now unless someone is <br/>
only sleeping a few hours and walking around like a zombie or sleeping all <br/>
day, I would say let their bodies, no matter how little, figure it all out. <br/>
Unless for some reason it also interferes withe the family in some way.<br/>
<br/>
I know here it works for us to stay up later. My husband works late most <br/>
nights and if the kids went to bed by 9:00, wouldn&#39;t have any time to spend <br/>
with him. We play outside on the swing set and swim in the pool regularly at <br/>
9 or 10 at night. He&#39;s up early and out and a lot of days comes home in the <br/>
afternoon and spends time again here. He also comes home and does field <br/>
trips with us. So it all works for us. If he worked nights, I could see <br/>
where I might try to alter our schedule to be able to have more together <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I said &quot;I might try!!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re not talking about a small child either....there is a difference.<br/>
If a 12 y.o. happens upon something that bothers them, they&#39;re going to <br/>
change the channel or look away.<br/>
A younger child may not have the skills to do that.<br/>
He only watches the same channels every night, so it&#39;s not much of a concern. <br/>
He knows the programming and where to go for what he wants.<br/>
He&#39;s also sensitive to the fact that his younger sister doesn&#39;t need to see <br/>
certain things and changes it when she&#39;s with him. Adult Swim is great <br/>
entertainment to him, it&#39;s a bit over her head and I don&#39;t think she needs to <br/>
hear some of the cussing on it just yet.<br/>
He&#39;s capable of choosing, he&#39;s capable of knowing what he can&#39;t handle.<br/>
I wonder what some of you think will happen if you give your children choice.<br/>
It seems you think they would either choose the worst or stumble across <br/>
really bad stuff and not know what to do?<br/>
So at what point to you give them more freedom so that they can become wise <br/>
about choices? <br/>

When my boys are up late at night they&#39;re playing video games or computer <br/>
games, or card games with their friends (there were three extra teenaged boys <br/>
here last night).<br/>
<br/>
Families who insist on quiet and control will eventually find their kids <br/>
needing to go elsewhere to socialize at night.  At my house I know WAY more <br/>
what&#39;s available for them to do and see than when they&#39;re out and about.  <br/>

Partly it&#39;s a luxury of having a big enough house that people can make noise <br/>
in one end of the house and others can sleep in the other.  But having that <br/>
luxury, letting other homeschoolers use this as a hangout ends up being <br/>
pretty much a control factor, even in an atmosphere of little apparent <br/>

not about me.  This is not personal.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that a boy on the cusp of (or in the throes of) puberty would <br/>
find some of the almost-porn movies, ads and infomercials that <br/>
are on at 3 am anything but &#39;grossand scary&#39;.  I think many of <br/>
them would find such material pretty damned compelling, to be <br/>
honest.  Now perhaps there are boys out there who have it all <br/>
together enough that they would be turned off by the fact that <br/>
these images are degrading stereotypes of women.  Perhaps, <br/>
but what about the other 98% who will be thinking, &quot;Wow.  <br/>
Naked.  Boobs.  Wow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I did not say forbid.  I did not say create a &#39;fobidden fruit&#39; <br/>
atmosphere.  What I was talking about was monitoring content, <br/>
so you know what is being watched, so you can discuss it.  It is <br/>
deliberately designed, produced and marketed to be as <br/>
compelling as possible, by very, very smart and sophisticated <br/>
people.  I am sure all these unschooled kids are as savvy as <br/>
they come, but they are still inexperienced, and vulnerable to this <br/>
stuff.  However savvy a twelve-year-old may be, he is not as savvy <br/>
as the team of marketers that are targeting him.   It&#39;s a pretty <br/>
complex issue, and takes a lot of sorting to figure out.<br/>
<br/>
Now, THIS is directed at you personally, because I am asking for <br/>
clarification on your personal position.  Are you telling me that <br/>
you believe that that kind of imagery (by this I mean the typical <br/>
hypersexualized images of women) holds no interest for your <br/>
twelve-year-old son?  That he regards it as &#39;nasty and awful&#39;?  <br/>
What if he doesn&#39;t? Or, what if he does?  What if he does see it <br/>
as nasty and awful and gross and scary, but still finds himself <br/>
drawn to it?  That is the nature of pornography - it is INTENDED <br/>
to be thus.  What protection does he have?  You&#39;re telling me <br/>
he&#39;s on his own, because you believe if there is a problem, he&#39;ll <br/>
let you know?  The purveyors of pornography in our society are <br/>
sophisticated predators.  You are happy to let them have as <br/>
much access to your son as he deems appropriate, without any <br/>
monitoring from you?<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying he IS watching this stuff.  I am saying that from <br/>
what you are telling me, you can&#39;t say with much authority that he <br/>
ISN&#39;T, because you aren&#39;t really paying enough attention to know.<br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of women out there are just as sure their <br/>
husbands would NEVER.  <br/>

kids watch. Now I&#39;m sure a lot of what they watch, many people have problems <br/>
with. I&#39;m also sure what I won&#39;t allow, many even here would question as to <br/>
why.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I can think of is the Simpson&#39;s. It was a few years ago when it <br/>
came on TV and never having watched it, the kids wanted to see it as it was <br/>
a cartoon. Well after about 10 minutes, I said no way. I didn&#39;t like the <br/>
attitude and language and just the whole feel of the show for my little <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
Now there are a lot of movies that we let are two middle ones see that a lot <br/>
of people probably would have a problem with. I generally have a very good <br/>
idea of what it will show before they see it. Sometimes I&#39;m off. Like one <br/>
movie that my husband and I had seen before and were certain there wasn&#39;t <br/>
anything we objected to. Well our memories served us wrong on one little <br/>
part. Man and woman in bed, so far okay, some kissing and snuggling and then <br/>
all of a sudden he dives south and although nothing was really seen, it was <br/>
vivid enough to where the kids were wondering what was going on. Now that&#39;s <br/>
the kind of stuff I avoid with my kids right now. I have more of a problem <br/>
with the sex being seen than the language and violence.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m sure I&#39;m leaving out parts that may be more detailed but I think you <br/>
get my point.<br/>
<br/>
My 16year old was raised the same way and now she sees what she wants and <br/>
also doesn&#39;t really get into the stuff that is too excessive, as far as she <br/>
is concerned, which what I&#39;ve seen is okay with me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Now, THIS is directed at you personally, because I am asking for <br/>
clarification on your personal position.  Are you telling me that <br/>
you believe that that kind of imagery (by this I mean the typical <br/>
hypersexualized images of women) holds no interest for your <br/>
twelve-year-old son?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 13 and 16.<br/>
They have seen pictures of naked people before.  They&#39;ve seen R rated movies <br/>
before.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; That he regards it as &#39;nasty and awful&#39;?  <br/>
What if he doesn&#39;t? Or, what if he does? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not interested in photo porn as far as I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago Kirby had a copy of Cosmopolitan in his bathroom, and a <br/>
printout of some fantasy alien teen stuff.  Shape-changers having sex in <br/>
fantasy-animal bodies or some such.  I didn&#39;t make a deal about it.  It was <br/>
my &quot;tip&quot; for cleaning his bathroom that I got a peek into what he was looking <br/>
into.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if he doesn&#39;t? Or, what if he does?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They spend a LOT of time at home, voluntarily.  They have lots of teenaged <br/>
friends, mostly gamers (translation:  geeks).  But not all.  Kirby, in <br/>
particular is hyper-popular.  At the moment they&#39;re off at a Lifehouse <br/>
concert with a group of teens, all but one homeschoolers.  Eleven kids, one <br/>
mom (Carol Rice, from the late-reading article), three of them girls.   None <br/>
of them will end up coupled up or kissing.  They&#39;ll all end up over here when <br/>
the concert&#39;s over.  Probably five of them will spend the night, but the <br/>
girls and two of the boys all live in other towns over the mountains and will <br/>
go home.   Kirby got a phone call after they left, an invitation to do <br/>
something else tonight.  Tomorrow he works, and will go and do something or <br/>
other with older kids (the anime crowd) after that.  I&#39;ll know where he is <br/>
and there&#39;ll be someone with a cellphone.  I have all the phone numbers he <br/>
has.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night he was up online until about 5:00 a.m.  He doesn&#39;t erase his <br/>
internet trail.  he was playing AON (an online role playing game) and <br/>
chatting with others who were playing that.  He was on my computer because <br/>
his is being repaired.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if he does see it as nasty and awful and gross and scary, but still <br/>
finds himself drawn to it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then he&#39;ll look at it some.  He&#39;s way too busy a guy to need it for <br/>
distraction.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What protection does he have?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think seeing some pornography will kill, maim or even taint him.  <br/>
He&#39;s living life in the world as a healthy, busy, thoughtful human being.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You&#39;re telling me he&#39;s on his own, because you believe if there is a <br/>
problem, he&#39;ll <br/>
let you know? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  If he has a problem he&#39;ll let me know.  I don&#39;t just believe it, I know <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable TV, and if we did we wouldn&#39;t have Playboy channel, or <br/>
whatever might be the current nastiest of the batch.  But he has single male <br/>
friends in their 20&#39;s.  One is a fundamentalist Christian (the president of <br/>
their anime club, which has a rule against pornographic anime).  The others <br/>
aren&#39;t, but they don&#39;t smoke or drink.  They MIGHT, some of them, have nasty <br/>
anime or magazines, but from all reports they spend their time playing video <br/>
games, card games or watching the same series of Japanese animated series&#39; <br/>
that my adult friends in Denver do, because I&#39;ve heard them discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The purveyors of pornography in our society are <br/>
sophisticated predators.  You are happy to let them have as <br/>
much access to your son as he deems appropriate, without any <br/>
monitoring from you?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This question is not applicable to my son&#39;s life.  But as a straight-up <br/>
question, I would have to (if I were on the witness stand, as I seem to be) <br/>
say &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And what &quot;yes&quot; means is that I trust him.  I know him.  <br/>
Drug dealers have as much access to him as he deems appropriate.<br/>
Hookers have as much access to him as he deems appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
There are many things I haven&#39;t said &quot;NO, don&#39;t do this&quot; about because they <br/>
fall under the area of things he has no interest in doing.   Because of the <br/>
principles our lives are lived on, the kids aren&#39;t needy, and very little <br/>
freakish stuff is going to hold any allure.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not saying he IS watching this stuff.  I am saying that from <br/>
what you are telling me, you can&#39;t say with much authority that he <br/>
ISN&#39;T, because you aren&#39;t really paying enough attention to know.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no reason for them to be sneaky, because they have so much freedom of <br/>
choice and expression that there would be no trouble to get into.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason I know they are NEVER sneaking candy or sodas at night is that <br/>
there&#39;s no such think as sneaking when the things are allowed.  And because <br/>
they&#39;ve always had access, the things are also no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I think much of the thrill of &quot;nasty pictures&quot; is the idea that mom thinks it <br/>
will ruin your life, you have to go to sleep early to be protected from it, <br/>
it&#39;s something sophisticated predators are lying in wait to lure them into, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
We have neither glorified nor villified things, and so the children&#39;s choices <br/>
are made in a whole different manner than most people can imagine if the only <br/>
people they know were raised in the traditional, controlled and shame-based <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Lots and lots of women out there are just as sure their <br/>
husbands would NEVER.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a horrible thing.<br/>
<br/>
(Does anyone have a way to remember the last discussion here about kids, <br/>
pornography, erotica, and so forth?  I&#39;m thinking maybe someone remembers <br/>
because it was around a holiday or a move.)<br/>

Just because he won&#39;t get in trouble, doesn&#39;t mean he wants you <br/>

wouldn&#39;t get in trouble for having sex, but does he know when <br/>
you do it?  If he says, &quot;So how come you and Dad went to bed so <br/>
early last night?&quot;  would you say, &quot;Well, we wanted to have sex.  <br/>
Oh - now that you mention it, I should change those sheets!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, yes.  The old &quot;If you were enlightened like ME, you&#39;d <br/>
understand&quot; argument.  Do you hear the superiority in your <br/>
words here?  Holy smokes!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a horrible thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pornography?  You don&#39;t think pornography is a horrible thing?  <br/>
Then you may want to do a little research.  Pornography destroys <br/>
a LOT of lives, and hurts a LOT of women.  It changes the way <br/>
men think about women, interferes with their capacity for true <br/>
intimacy, and sets up a lot of unreasonable expectations and <br/>
impressions of healthy sexuality. <br/>
<br/>
What I read here is denial, naiveté, and a pretty blinkered view of <br/>
the impact of mainstream sexual messages on young men.  <br/>
Sure.  He&#39;ll be fine.  No need for gudance - he can navigate his <br/>
way through that minefield all alone.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever.<br/>
