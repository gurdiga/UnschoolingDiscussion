<div id="ygrps-yiv-635546282">Something happened last night that I&#39;d like to hear some of your <br/>
ideas on.  My husband and son, David (11), were going to <br/>
see &quot;Madagascar&quot; with a friend and his son, Cooper (7).  Everyone <br/>
was waiting for Cooper in the car.  I came into the house and saw <br/>
Cooper standing by David&#39;s massive pile of Legos with a very guilty <br/>
look on his face and with his hands behind his back.  I told him <br/>
that they were waiting for him and he sort of slid his hands into <br/>
his pockets and slowly inched past me.  I was pretty sure he had <br/>
taken something but decided to just let it play out.<br/>
<br/>
When they got back from the movie I asked David if Cooper had <br/>
anything &quot;new&quot; in his pockets at the movie.  David said no but both <br/>
he and my husband noticed that he was acting very suspicious.  David <br/>
then looked through his Legos and immediately noticed that an <br/>
arrangement of Star Troopers was obviously missing something.<br/>
<br/>
Cooper&#39;s dad is a dear friend so my husband called him and asked if <br/>
maybe Cooper had taken something.  Cooper denied it so we said we&#39;d <br/>
look again.  In the meantime, his dad had found the Star Trooper and <br/>
they came over to bring it back.  <br/>
<br/>
When they got here, Cooper had been well-rehearsed.  He was supposed <br/>
to tell David he was sorry, that he wouldn&#39;t do it again, and <br/>
something else (I forget) then he was supposed to apologize to both <br/>
my husband and me for doing something wrong in our house.  It was <br/>
all very painful.  David tried to be gracious and forgiving.  I told <br/>
Cooper that he&#39;s still welcome here anytime.<br/>
<br/>
After they left, David said, &quot;That was so sad.  Everybody was <br/>
telling him what to say.  It just made me sad.&quot;  I thought too that <br/>
the scripted apology was just humiliating, yet I also feel for <br/>
Cooper&#39;s dad.  What should he have done?  These are people that we <br/>
care about and want to be at ease with.  Still, I don&#39;t want David <br/>
to feel that his (precious!) posessions are in jeopardy when <br/>
Cooper&#39;s around.<br/>
<br/>
What would make a child steal?  Cooper has lots of toys and parents <br/>
who love him and provide for him.  It just seems there&#39;s something <br/>
else going on there that I&#39;d like to understand.<br/>
<br/>
OK.  Thanks for your insights!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920585733">What a sad situation all the way around.  I know there<br/>
are powerful desires at work that seem to overwhelm<br/>
us.  The apology scene you described makes me ache. <br/>
Poor little guy.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the only alternative might have been for you<br/>
to &#39;catch&#39; him at the outset, clear up the matter<br/>
gently and let it go.  But you didn&#39;t really know and<br/>
I understand that you certainly wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
accuse (for lack of a better word) the child without<br/>
being 100% certain.  Bringing in Cooper&#39;s parents<br/>
probably made it rougher on everyone involved.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe David is the one who can take the lead on this. <br/>
Maybe Cooper can tell him why that item was so<br/>
precious, so dear that he&#39;d risk so much to have it. <br/>
And maybe they can work out a way to let David feel<br/>
his treasures are safe and Cooper can feel that he&#39;s<br/>
able to enjoy them without having them.<br/>
<br/>
Once they have resolved the issue, it seems like all<br/>
the grownups could take a breath and be satisfied that<br/>
the two parties involved worked it out.  I hope<br/>
everyone can return to a more enjoyable relationship<br/>
soon.  It sounds like these are all very important<br/>
people in your family&#39;s life.<br/>

<br/>
A few weeks ago our neighbor Renee (7.5) was over here, and the last game<br/>
the two girls were playing was &quot;dress up&quot; in the bathroom. A few minutes<br/>
after she left I noticed that my diamond ring, that I had left in the<br/>
bathroom when I washed my hands, was missing, although my gold wedding ring<br/>
was still in the tray.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Jayn if Renee had tried it on because I couldn&#39;t see it, and she<br/>
said yes, so I called R&#39;s house. I said to her Mom that I thought Renee may<br/>
have tried on my ring and &quot;forgotten&quot; that she had it on when she left<br/>
shortly after. I could hear part of the conversation where Mom asked, Renee<br/>
denied and then Mom found the ring - in Renee&#39;s jewelry box. The upshot of<br/>
it was that Mom assured me that Renee would bring it back at once, although<br/>
I offered to come up and collect it.<br/>
<br/>
Boy was she ever subdued when she came back down the hall in about five<br/>
minutes - probably the time it took for whatever punishment and<br/>
unpleasantness to be undertaken. She had a pretty implausible story about<br/>
believing it was her aunt&#39;s ring she had on (my ring is pretty unusual in<br/>
being a heart shaped diamond). I *hope* I handled it well by being kind to<br/>
her, not acting all accusatory, and thanking her for bringing it back as if<br/>
she had done so by choice. <br/>
<br/>
I believe that Renee stole my ring because she is jealous of the freedoms,<br/>
and huge amount of freely shared stuff, that Jayn has. I think maybe she was<br/>
trying a bit of magical thinking of bringing something visibly precious of<br/>
ours back with her to put with her personal treasures, or somehow trying to<br/>
test the limit of what could be shared. Or maybe she just liked the sparkle<br/>
- but I doubt it is that picayune. Maybe she was trying to get Jayn into<br/>
trouble - for the same reasons of jealousy, and because that is the primary<br/>
dynamic between her and her little brother.<br/>
<br/>
All it means to me is that I have to step up the vigilance when she visits -<br/>
and not leave my rings about, however mildly inconvenient that may be. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408506345">I distinctly remember stealing an Indian doll that someone had brought <br/>
to share at school. And I brazenly lied about how I had gotten it to <br/>
my mom. I was 7 also. It seems that I&#39;ve heard many stories like this <br/>
so I think this is not that unusual for this age range. Although, I&#39;ve <br/>
never stolen anything else in my life. I don&#39;t really know the best <br/>
way to handle it...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a (possibly half-baked) personal theory that there&#39;s a<br/>
developmental reason that kids at about age 7 might try lying or<br/>
stealing.  I know quite a few kids who either start lying for a while<br/>
or try stealing something right around that age.  I did both myself<br/>
right around that age.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something about age 7 -- a child can really start to see the<br/>
big world around him, and is trying to make sense of his place in it.<br/>
 He gets some ideas about managing his situation a little more --<br/>
taking some more control.  <br/>
<br/>
I know of one boy who told his father he&#39;d already brought his books<br/>
in from the car, when he hadn&#39;t.  Now if I was his parent, I&#39;d<br/>
probably just go get the books myself.  But I think the boy lied<br/>
because he was just starting to figure out that he could manage the<br/>
situation so that he wouldn&#39;t have to get up from what he was doing<br/>
and get the books.  Of course, he hadn&#39;t foreseen the point at which<br/>
his father looked in the car and saw that he was lying.  The new<br/>
connections only go so far at this point.<br/>
<br/>
In your case, I think Cooper saw the things he wanted and thought<br/>
about trying to get them.  He doesn&#39;t see the big world enough yet to<br/>
think about asking his parents to buy them -- he wants these specific<br/>
things, the ones he sees right now.  It occurs to him, because his<br/>
brain is offering up more ideas than it used to, that he might just<br/>
try taking what he wants.  And lying about it.  So he tries it.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel great about it (that&#39;s part of the learning, too), and it<br/>
goes against what he&#39;s been told, which he kind of vaguely remembers.<br/>
 But he&#39;s just trying something out, and seeing if it&#39;s a good way to<br/>
manage the situation.<br/>
<br/>
So I think when he comes over again, you can just share with him that<br/>
if there&#39;s something he really wants, you will help him try to get one<br/>
for himself.  You could write down the exact name of the toy or item,<br/>
and if he needs to go to a special store or website to get it. You can<br/>
offer to bring it up with his dad.  That will help his brain learn<br/>
that there are other ways to manage situations (collecting<br/>
information, asking) and to get what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, thanks, Amy.  This is very insightful.  What I&#39;m seeing now is <br/>
that part of the problem is the anxiety of the adults involved.  We <br/>
are scared and worried that Cooper is on his way to a life of <br/>
crime.  :-)  Seeing this as a developmental task gone wrong really <br/>
changes the way I feel about it and will undoubtedly change the way I <br/>
respond to Cooper.  I&#39;m sure having a Lego catalog handy and being <br/>
able to write down the things that he really likes will appeal to him.<br/>
<br/>
This illustrates for me two reasons why this unschooling way of <br/>
thinking is so good for me.  1. I no longer have to be making &quot;moral&quot; <br/>
judgments about kids&#39; behavior--there are more constructive ways to <br/>
interpret things.  And 2. I can treat kids like human beings, not <br/>
inferior creatures to be managed and &quot;raised.&quot;</div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with #2, but I think morals are real and legitimate.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kirby was little (seven or eight?), when he came in one day holding a $20  <br/>
bill and looking at it like he&#39;d never seen one.  He said &quot;Look what I  found in <br/>
the road,&quot; but he said it without looking away from it, and without  sounding <br/>
convinced, like he was in a fog about where it had come from.<br/>
 <br/>
I told him to hang onto it, and if nobody claimed it he could have  it.  <br/>
 <br/>
He had been at the neighbor&#39;s house, and I figured that the kid there had  <br/>
given it to him, because that kid was always trouble of one sort or another, but <br/>
 I also considered that Kirby had picked it up and not figured out how or <br/>
when to  set it back down again, which is what happened.  <br/>
 <br/>
The neighbor mom called and said basically, &quot;Hi, Kirby was just here and a  <br/>
$20 bill I had on the shelf is missing,&quot; and I said, &quot;Yeah, he has it, we&#39;ll be <br/>
 right over.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So I walked him over without shaming him and just said sometimes when you  <br/>
pick something up it&#39;s kind of embarrassing to figure out how to put it back  <br/>
where it&#39;s supposed to be but that maybe he could&#39;ve said &quot;Here, I was just  <br/>
looking at this,&quot; and give it back as he was leaving.  <br/>
 <br/>
He was clearly not trying to be sneaky.  He had it in his hand and  showed it <br/>
to me the moment he walked in.  He could&#39;ve hidden it, but he  didn&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
A year and some later I got a call from the karate dojo saying some money  <br/>
was missing from the men&#39;s dressing room, and Kirby had been in there but hadn&#39;t <br/>
 been the only one.  He wasn&#39;t accusing Kirby, but just wanted me to keep an  <br/>
eye out, and they would follow other leads and keep looking.   I told  him <br/>
when he called about the other incident.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think some moms would&#39;ve marched in and searched the kid and made a  <br/>
ruckus.  I didn&#39;t.  I thought... what will Kirby do if he has some  cash?  He&#39;ll <br/>
want to go to the card shop.  The rest of the day passed  and he didn&#39;t say &quot;Can <br/>
I got to Magic Moments?&quot;  The next day passed  without a request for me to <br/>
take him anywhere.  I don&#39;t remember now  whether I called the dojo or waited <br/>
until I went in, but they had found the  money still in the dressing room, like <br/>
the guy had stuck it in his shoe or  something like that, and it was still <br/>
sitting there.    I didn&#39;t  tell Kirby about it until it was all settled out, I <br/>
think.  (It&#39;s been  years now.)<br/>
 <br/>
Our kids have always been very scrupulous about bringing us the change if  we <br/>
send the out with money.  They&#39;ll bring change and receipts usually,  which I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t care about myself.  Because they&#39;re so honest, I don&#39;t  mind <br/>
over-supplying them.  Last week Kirby went out to eat and only had $5  or so.  I gave <br/>
him a $20 and said take it in case, and if he didn&#39;t need it  bring it back.  <br/>
He brought it back.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I was his age if I&#39;d had $20 of my parents money I would&#39;ve found  <br/>
something to spend it on, but I think that&#39;s because I so rarely had any money  and <br/>
I resented the amount my mom spent on cigarettes and beer, jukeboxes and  <br/>
buying drinks for other drunks.   Maybe part of our kids&#39; advantage is  they <br/>
don&#39;t see us spending money frivolously and then telling them we don&#39;t have  any <br/>
to give them.  My dad didn&#39;t do it, but my mom sure did.  (They  divorced when <br/>
I was Kirby&#39;s age.)<br/>
