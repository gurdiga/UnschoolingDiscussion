<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185946914">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Today unschooling consisted of going to the airport, seeing a<br/>
helicopter.  We also visited someone my husband knew that has an<br/>
airplane and he gave my son and I a ride.  One of Rowyn&#39;s friends who&#39;s<br/>
in Kindergarten at school said to our son,  &quot;Are you just home from<br/>
school?&quot;  I said, &quot;Yes, we saw a helicopter and rode on an airplane.&quot;<br/>
Let&#39;s see a school beat that for an afternoon.  Rowyn also got to see<br/>
how he gets the plane ready with gas, checks the gas and checks the<br/>
plane over.  The airplane owner was impressed with our son, who is 6<br/>
years old, knowledge of planes and how they work.<br/>
<br/>
We will be starting a flight group with local homeschoolers and<br/>
families.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301538885">How KEWL!!!  There&#39;s an aerodrome near here, and we often <br/>
get small planes over us, as well as the bigger ones on their way <br/>
to Manchester Airport, for some reason we&#39;re under the incoming <br/>
flight-path.  I was outside one day when one came over and I <br/>
decided (I knew already, but it came to the top of my head) that <br/>
I&#39;d want flying lessons if we got enough money, and I suppose I <br/>
could earn it for myself if I wanted to.  Then I got to thinking how <br/>
cool it would be to travel round the world with a little plane, and <br/>
earn a living wherever I was with my flying skills.  But I decided <br/>
the problem with that was that some of the work I could get <br/>
would be crop-spraying, and that doesn&#39;t go down well with my <br/>
organic-gardening and farming sensibilities, so I wondered if it <br/>
would be feasible to do crop-spraying with organic fertilisers.  <br/>
Yes, I have a strange mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-817949297">We want to join too! When you all learn to fly you can come to Ohio and pick <br/>
us up, right?<br/>
