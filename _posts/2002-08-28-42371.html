  This is a difficult problem but with child led learning, it is good to let <br/>
them give swords a try. My son got his fascination at an early age from <br/>
reading the Redwall series. (Brian Jacques, wonderful books)<br/>
 If they really want to learn swordplay, do the real thing. See if you can <br/>
find a fencing club near by and let them learn to fence with the safety and <br/>
control that is necessary for being a good athlete. Most clubs start kids <br/>
when they are 7. <br/>
 Both my daughter and son fence. Go to USfencing.org and look at the left <br/>
hand column to &quot;New To Fencing?&quot; There you will find a map of the US and can <br/>
click on your state to find fencing clubs. Your kids are at the perfect age <br/>
to start. Sport fencing is not about wacking each other, it requires a lot of <br/>
strategy and thinking. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I should probably go back to the beginning of swords, but if I start here in <br/>
the middle maybe I&#39;ll say something someone else has already said.  And that <br/>
can be valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get back to that question in a minute.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Am I being ridiculous here?  Did any of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you involved with SCA have similar feelings?  I know weaponry is a really <br/>
&gt; big part of the Middle ages. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been in the SCA for 26 years.  REALLY in the SCA.  <br/>
My sons are 16 and 13 and have always had &quot;boffers,&quot; always been with and <br/>
around sword-fighting guys.  They&#39;ve attended SCA wars, and the older one has <br/>
done some rapier fighting, and is working (sometimes, slowly) on armor  now <br/>
that he&#39;s old enough for &quot;heavy weapons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys are peaceloving, kind to children, gentle with kittens and bugs, <br/>
etc.  Neither has ever asked for a real sword.  Marty owns three knives.  <br/>
It&#39;s his &quot;knife collection.&quot;  We got him a Leatherman for Christmas, and he <br/>
takes good care of it, but very rarely takes it anywhere.  Even when I say <br/>
&quot;Marty, take your leatherman&quot; when we&#39;re going camping or to a birthday party <br/>
where gift-opening might be a problem, he forgets.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And can I still ban guns? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can, but it doesn&#39;t help anything.  It hurts some things.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Secondly, do I let <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them make do with odds and ends, or do I help them earn the money for the <br/>
&gt; gorgeous plastic swords encrusted with fake jewels? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought my kids fake swords.  One of Kirbys favorite toys of all time was <br/>
the plastic sword that came with a &quot;NeNardo costume&quot; when he was three.  A <br/>
Ninja Turtle costume with a VERY cool sword with the turtles logo embossed in <br/>
the blade.  I wish we still had it, or another like it.  It was played with <br/>
nearly daily for years, by him or Marty.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; So would it be ridiculous to give in and allow something I am so <br/>
opposed to, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if I impose the rule that if the weapons are ever used against each other <br/>
&gt; or other children the toys will be immediately put on a shelf?  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would talk to them instead of putting toys up.  If talking doesn&#39;t work, <br/>
then maybe.  But not for a really long time. <br/>
<br/>
The trust between parent and child is worth way more than any rules about toy <br/>
weapons, and when moms are calling all the rules and making dire predictions <br/>
and shaming their kids, pretty much those predictions turn out NOT to be <br/>
true, and so the child&#39;s trust in the mother erodes a little.  And the peace <br/>
of the house is disturbed more by arguments and begging and the negativity of <br/>
all that than the &quot;danger&quot; one plastic sword, or water gun, or cap pistol <br/>
would bring to a house where the mother is willing to listen to her son and <br/>
the son is then more likely to want to listen to his mother.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I think.<br/>
I could be wrong.<br/>

<br/>
You can, but it doesn&#39;t help anything.  It hurts some things.<br/>
<br/>
    The silly thing is, they have never even asked to play guns.  I don&#39;t know why I am even worried, except that so much of what I have done in the past has been aimed at preventing problems.  Unschooling is so much about fully living in the here and now ... it&#39;s still hard to make that shift in some areas.  I feel like I am giving up all vestiges of parental control, and then I think more about it and realize I *have* no parental control.  Their choices are their own.  I am sure I could get them to comply, but at what cost?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
    Once it is put like that, I find it simple to agree.  I wish I already had those thoughts internalized, but when I measure how much I have already grown I know I am at least on the right track, and at 35 with my oldest only 9 1/2, I still have time.  Thank goodness!    Debi <br/>

Debi, You&#39;re LUCKY!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was an old mom.  Now that my kids are older I&#39;m an even older mom.  <br/>
Sometimes I wish I were only twenty-some years older than they are instead of <br/>
as old as some of their friends&#39; grandmothers.  <br/>

I&#39;m 49, and I don&#39;t do math in my head easily, but I was 33 (barely turned) <br/>

think.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I hung around with kids who had older parents than mine, and <br/>
I wasn&#39;t even a &quot;preemie, in the sense that my mom had been 22 or 23 when I <br/>
was born.  They used to say &quot;Your parents are SO YOUNG!&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m 45 and have 6.5 and 4 y/o sons!  I met a women when I was pregnant of the little one and she was 44,  she was feeling so ashamed to be pregnant at that age until she met a 48 pregnant woman!  I think that it&#39;s a fashion been 40 something and pregnant.<br/>

twentieth birthday and Jack just a little over six months after my <br/>
twenty-second birthday. Sometimes I think something like Homer Simpson and <br/>
his &quot;18 And You&#39;re OUT the DOOR! WhOO!&quot; I just get so excited at the idea <br/>
that by the time I am 40 both my kids will be 18 or over. Most of the time I <br/>
want them to stay with me forever, but sometimes that emotional immaturity <br/>
creeps in. I often wonder if I would have been a more patient parent if I had <br/>
waited till I was in my late 20&#39;s or even into my 30&#39;s to have kids. <br/>
Obviously I wouldn&#39;t have the ones I have now. &lt;g&gt; My Mom says I am so laid <br/>
back it amazes her. She says she could have never just sent us kids out to <br/>
play, or let us paint at the table without her being right there. It really <br/>
amazes me what my Mom thinks is being laid back, and what I think is being <br/>
laid back. I don&#39;t think kids need me to direct something they already know <br/>
how to do. (like play) But I can get a big fit of the screaming mimis when I <br/>
suddenly decide the house needs to be cleaned up and everywhere I look I see <br/>
kids, toys, books, magazines, paper, glue, paint, an assorted collection of <br/>
outside nature inside, the dog, games, videos, food, more kids... My Mom, <br/>
could deal with situations like that. Actually, situations like that didn&#39;t <br/>
happen too often, and if they did, she probably had a sweet smile on her face <br/>
and a wooden spoon behind her back, so maybe my screaming isn&#39;t quite as bad. <br/>
But I think maybe it is. My Mom thinks I am laid back, I think I need to be <br/>
more laid back, and sometimes I think that would have happened if I had <br/>
waited to have kids. Other times, I think I would have been more like my Mom. <br/>
Would I have been a better Mom if I had waited? Maybe, but then I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have the kids I have now! :o)<br/>
