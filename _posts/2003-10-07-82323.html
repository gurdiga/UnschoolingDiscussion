&lt;&lt;  I was wondering if there is <br/>
somewhere I could get her a better recorder if she decides she wants one. Are <br/>
they <br/>
all plastic or are some wood? Do they come in different sizes? I hope someone <br/>
knows. Sandra? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Recorders have two sizes very easy to come by, and four fairly easy, and two <br/>
or three more obscure sizes in the teensy and gigantic range that the fanatics <br/>
might buy.<br/>
<br/>
Easy set:  <br/>
Soprano (probably the one you got--the very bottom note is &quot;C&quot; so they call <br/>
them &quot;C&quot; recorders)<br/>
Alto (called &quot;Treble&quot; in England) and is an &quot;F&quot; recorder (bottom note &quot;F&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
If she ends up playing by ear mostly, she can switch back and forth between <br/>
them without regard, just finding a key that&#39;s good (and easy for her) for the <br/>
people she&#39;s playing or singing with.<br/>
<br/>
If she learns to play it reading  music, she&#39;ll need to pick one or the other <br/>
and stick with it until she feels confident enough to learn a second set of <br/>
names for the same fingerings.<br/>
<br/>
Both instruments work the same way, but what&#39;s a C on the alto is a G on the <br/>
soprano (finger-wise).<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re both &quot;C instruments&quot; in the larger scheme of life, meaning that when <br/>
there&#39;s a C on &quot;piano music&quot; that&#39;s the same C that&#39;s called C on a recorder.  <br/>
(Sorry to touch on one of life&#39;s biggest mysteries here, but there are some <br/>
&quot;band instruments&quot; which were pitched and labelled in ways that should have <br/>
been prevented in the beginning, so that a clarinet&#39;s Bflat is a piano&#39;s C.  <br/>
Never mind that!  Doesn&#39;t apply to recorders.)<br/>
<br/>
So If someone asks if a recorder is a C instrument, the answer is yes.<br/>
<br/>
Then within that truth, every other size is &quot;an F recorder&quot; which has nothing <br/>
to do with the piano or &quot;real C.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They hands.  Some have a couple of keys to help with the reach.<br/>
<br/>
By the time she&#39;s playing with groups (if that were to happen) they can tell <br/>
her all about the other sizes; she&#39;ll see other people&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
When you get ready to buy another one, go to a music store in person if you <br/>
can, or e-mail me and I&#39;ll help you find a mailorder source. <br/>
<br/>
A cheap wooden one is not better than a good plastic one.<br/>
An expensive wooden one if out of most people&#39;s price range.<br/>
