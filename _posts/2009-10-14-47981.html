<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066288223">I let Cameron&#39;s symposium announcement through, but subsequent  <br/>
reminders won&#39;t be on the list, so if you&#39;re interested in it,  <br/>
definitely sign up for his mailing list.  I&#39;m sure it will be a really  <br/>
great gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like for the Always Learning list to be filled with chit chat  <br/>
about gatherings or conferences, for several reasons.  They&#39;re  <br/>
regional, and expensive, and off topic, mostly.  Yes, they can be  <br/>
helpful, but they&#39;re not necessary for unschooling to work.  Most  <br/>
families can&#39;t afford them.  We paid full price once, for Holly and  <br/>
Marty to go to North Carolina, and it was a strain for us.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if there were somehow (squint your eyes and twist  <br/>
your brain to follow this analogy) university courses in unschooling  <br/>
that would help unschoolers get it, they might be worth taking, and  <br/>
would cost as much as a conference but be much less fun.<br/>
<br/>
So I want to talk about a symposium I&#39;ve organized, and why, and why I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t talking about it much sooner.  And after this I won&#39;t talk  <br/>
about it on the list, so if you&#39;re interested, e-mail me and I&#39;ll add  <br/>
you to my announcements list and start collecting money  and  <br/>
reservations this week.<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to do has not been done, and isn&#39;t likely to happen  <br/>
again.  I wanted Pam Sorooshian, Joyce Fetteroll and myself, in  <br/>
person, in the same place, with all our husbands and our kids. It&#39;s  <br/>
set up now, and barring emergencies, is happening January 7-9, 2010,  <br/>
in northern New Mexico.    People whose words you&#39;ve read and whose  <br/>
kids have been &quot;poster children&quot; for years will be all in one place,  <br/>
in person.   And not to be morbid or anything, but not many people now  <br/>
unschooling ever heard John Holt speak in person.  I didn&#39;t, and he  <br/>
was even in New Mexico after I was interested in education.  This  <br/>
might be one of those things you can look back on in the future and  <br/>
say &quot;I was there when Joyce, Pam and Sandra were all in one place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because I had already signed up to speak at three conferences, and two  <br/>
were also in the southwestern U.S., I felt wrong about telling people  <br/>
to save their money to come to Santa Fe.  It&#39;s within range of San  <br/>
Diego and Phoenix.   I didn&#39;t want to seem to conflict with what  <br/>
people were already offering me compensation (flights and rooms) to do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ready now, though, and I need forty families who have unschooled  <br/>
at least five years and who have a teen.  If I don&#39;t get forty of  <br/>
those, I&#39;ll open it up to families with younger kids or less experience.<br/>
Alternately, the conference would be good for parents of younger  <br/>
children who leave their children at home, or who bring another adult  <br/>
to stay with the kids and find them things to do in Santa Fe or around  <br/>
there.   Driving is better than flying, or flying to Albuquerque and  <br/>
renting a car could work well.  It&#39;s off the path of public  <br/>
transportation, pretty much.  But if you wanted to take the light rail  <br/>
to Santa Fe (or fly into  Santa Fe if you&#39;re decadently wealthy) and  <br/>
use taxis in Santa Fe, that&#39;s a possibility.  You might want a car to  <br/>
go up to Ten Thousand Waves (Japanese hot-tub/spa, in the tall pines),  <br/>
or skiing or snowboarding at Ski Santa Fe, if you&#39;re so inclined.<br/>
<br/>
This would be the first and best conference for which an EXCELLENT  <br/>
arrangement would be for two or three dads, or two or three moms, to  <br/>
come without families and share a condo.  This could be a great  <br/>
vacation for unschooling parents who have made friends with other  <br/>
parents they don&#39;t get to visit much.   And honestly, if the kids got  <br/>
video games for Christmas, they&#39;ll still be mesmerized back home and  <br/>
one of the parents could sneak off to Santa Fe pretty easily; maybe  <br/>
both, if there are awesome grandparents or other caretakers the kids  <br/>
trust to feed them during video game play.<br/>
<br/>
Most conferences emphasize the social aspect, and have workshops to  <br/>
introduce people to how unschooling works.  I want zero beginner  <br/>
questions, and all very-advanced sharing of unexpected outcomes.  I&#39;ll  <br/>
be learning too, if we take all our &quot;Yes it&#39;s working; how and why did  <br/>
it work?&quot; energy and bring it into one place where we can discuss  <br/>
things in depth.<br/>
<br/>
The site is &quot;Fort Marcy Hotel Suites&quot; but the name is misleading.   <br/>
It&#39;s not a hotel; it&#39;s a timeshare condo complex with one main  <br/>
building.  People&#39;s doors open to the outside, there are steps, it&#39;s  <br/>
hilly, and could be snowy or icy.  We don&#39;t have lots of rooms, we  <br/>
have one big room for presentations and evening meals, and a breakfast  <br/>
room that could be used for gathering and visiting during the day.   <br/>
All the activities will be focused and together.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most expensive parts of conferences can be the food and the  <br/>
cost of the rooms.  Our condo rates are very low, but can&#39;t be had  <br/>
unless one is registered for the conference in advance.<br/>
Each condo has a full kitchen and so food can be prepared  <br/>
inexpensively.   Dinners will be shared in the conference room--two  <br/>
catered as part of the conference fee (not fancy catering, but plain  <br/>
and fun), and one will be a potluck.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty will take and set up Rock Band and Beatles Rock Band  <br/>
in their condo, and other kids are welcome to go there and hang out.   <br/>
There will definitely be a session of the teens and young adults  <br/>
telling stories and answering questions, and one for dads only, as well.<br/>
<br/>
The condos can be packed full.  Two families would fit into a three- <br/>
bedroom.  A two-bedroom will hold probably four or five people  <br/>
easily.  Any one-bedroom will hold three people, unlike hotel rooms.   <br/>
The living rooms all have either a couch someone can sleep on, or a  <br/>
fold-out bed, or both.  You could bring a futon from home, too, if you  <br/>
drive.<br/>
<br/>
We will furnish firewood and kindling, and each condo has either a  <br/>
fireplace or wood-burning stove.   That might not sound good this  <br/>
week, but in January in northern New Mexico I can tell you for certain  <br/>
that it&#39;s magical.<br/>
<br/>
More information is on this page and blog, and I&#39;m ready to register  <br/>
attendees.   The conference fees are below.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://santafeunschoolingsymposium.blogspot.com/">http://santafeunschoolingsymposium.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
There are photos of various rooms in various of the condos on the  <br/>
posts there.<br/>
<br/>
$100  One person<br/>
$150   Two people in the same family<br/>
$180   Three<br/>
$200<br/>
Each additional, another $20.<br/>
<br/>
If this turns out to be more money than we needed for transportation  <br/>
of the speakers, firewood, food and printing, families who were the  <br/>
most valuable to the proceedings will be offered small rebates to help  <br/>
them get back home.<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me if you know you&#39;d like to come.<br/>
<br/>
Locals who don&#39;t need to stay at the condos will pay the same price.<br/>
One-day local admissions are half the full-conference price.<br/>

<br/>
Checks are better than PayPal for me, but either&#39;s okay.<br/>
There are only four three-bedrooms suites in our block, so if you&#39;re  <br/>
wanting one of those you might want to do whatever you&#39;re going to do  <br/>
pretty quickly.<br/>
There are 10 one-bedrooms and 25 two-bedrooms.<br/>

<br/>
I did e-mail you a while back to let you know we were interested in this, but I thought I&#39;d do so again, just in case. And I&#39;d love to be on your announcement list as well. We do not have a teen, even though we have been unschooling for 5 or more years. Our boys are 10 and 5 (by January) and are not willing to stay with someone else while Dave and I come. :~) I certainly understand you wanting to keep it to families with teens, first, so I&#39;ll be content with being on the &quot;waiting list&quot;. (We could do either a 1 or 2 bedroom, as long as there is room on the floor of the 1 bedroom for a sleeper or 2.)<br/>
<br/>

Thank you,<br/>

<br/>
De, I sent you an e-mail but your mailbox rejected it.  &quot;mailbox  <br/>
full.&quot;  Please attend to that, or send me a different e-mail if you  <br/>
have more than one.  Thanks, Sandra</div>

<br/>
No, not these.  These will be two to three hour discussions, rather  <br/>
than talks.  I&#39;m planning two sessions per day so that the schedule  <br/>
every day is long session, long lunch, long session, dinner together,  <br/>
group activity.   Lots of time to think and be together and talk.<br/>
<br/>
I expect that new-improved ideas will come out of it, but it might  <br/>
take a while for those crystals to form.   And I hope people will be  <br/>
blogging from the event and soon after so that people can share in it  <br/>
that way.  Maybe I&#39;ll ask people to do that.  &quot;Please blog your  <br/>
thoughts, because Bea and others need to know!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And because the Friday afternoon unschooling chat comes during this  <br/>
time, maybe someone could be in the chat during the afternoon session  <br/>
and pass on good quotes to people in the chat.  It&#39;s possible.<br/>
