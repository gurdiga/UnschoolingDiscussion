<br/>
I have half a century&#39;s experience too, or will have when I turn 50 in July.<br/>
<br/>
I have eleven years&#39; intense involvement in unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
The mainstream advice is totally familiar to me.  Engrained.<br/>
<br/>
Then I have years of questioning it.  And on the subject of kids deciding on <br/>
their own what to eat, rather than having someone else &quot;dole it out&quot; to them  <br/>
I have nearly seventeen years successful experience at that, with three <br/>
children now, added to three children of whom I had custody earlier in life (and did <br/>
NOT know what I know now about freedom of choice), and my own history, and <br/>
the histories of the hundreds of people who are likewise involved in alternative <br/>
family lives and successfully finding that giving freedom creates good <br/>
judgment, while withholding freedom creates problems.<br/>
<br/>
Christina, it&#39;s likely you&#39;ve not known families in which children can eat <br/>
what and when they want, where the children have never once been made to &quot;clean <br/>
their plates.&quot;  It&#39;s rare, and the traditional methods of feeding children <br/>
make it seem crazy, but it&#39;s not.  I came to those ideas before any <br/>
homeschooling, because of attachment parenting, La Leche League, and an article in <br/>
Mothering Magazine that said offering children all kinds of food resulted in them <br/>
eating a balanced diet without it being measured and prescribed for them.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I delivered a fourteen year old boy to an all day activity.  <br/>
They have to bring a lunch.  It can&#39;t have candy or soda.  He wasn&#39;t feeling very <br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
We have lots of food in the house, and what he chose and I fixed up for him <br/>
was a sandwich of leftover beef/barbecue sauce, an apple, and some cranberry <br/>
juice.   He turned down chips, pie and other fruit.<br/>
<br/>
When he got home yesterday he had a milk shake, which I offered to make him <br/>
and he happily accepted.  We have candy and soda, but he didn&#39;t want any.  He <br/>
has three pieces of chocolate he got Tuesday (looks like little rolls of film, <br/>
imported chocolate in foil).  He has eaten one.<br/>
<br/>
If candy were doled out, he would want his dole.  It&#39;s freely available, and <br/>
he can leave it alone.<br/>

I did not write the statement below.  I wrote the one following it :&quot;You<br/>
are obviously...&quot;  The statement I did write about doling out candy was<br/>
metaphorical. I&#39;m in enough trouble here it seems without having<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I never have said anything to mine. I never said too much snacks is too <br/>
much. Just has never been an issue. This am, the baby dug out a tomatoes and the 3 <br/>
yr. old grabbed a cucumber and cut it up and shared with the 11 yr. old and 1 <br/>
yr. old.  She also likes to dump uncooked Mac N cheese in a bowl and play <br/>
with it and eat some. Today she added shredded cheese. The 11 yr. old cooked a <br/>
box of Mac N. Cheese. <br/>
<br/>
I often see them eating lunch things for breakfast cuz they get up now <br/>
between 9-10. Not an issue here. If they get hungry later they may have a bowl of <br/>
cereal. <br/>
I usually will cook the 1yr old a meal he may or may not eat it but knows he <br/>
can go over to the fridge and grap what he wants like <br/>
cheese,apples,orange,banana, Yogurt, pudding, tomatoes, cucumbers or cantaloupe whatever happens to be <br/>
in there that day. If he sees a snack on the counter he points to it, we get <br/>
it.<br/>
If we are in a store and they ask for a candy bar or something I buy it.  <br/>
They may ask once a week or once a month.  I have never made a stink about junk <br/>
food so its something they may or may not want-not a must have because they are <br/>
checking to see if I will say no.<br/>

<br/>
I thought it was a simile, suggesting that both praise and candy should<br/>
be doled out sparingly because too much sweetness is bad for kids.  I<br/>
recognize that that last part is *my* inference about where you were<br/>
leading.  Lots of people believe it.  But not so many on this list.<br/>

There was a really excellent discussion about this not long ago.  I looked at <br/>
www.unschooling.com and didn&#39;t find it. Does anyone remember where and have a <br/>
link?  Maybe it wasn&#39;t there, but on this list.  If so, is there a good <br/>

that you KNOW he would eat sweets all the time.  But from what you say, you<br/>
haven&#39;t given him the chance to find out.<br/>
<br/>
Mary and Sandra were trying to clarify if you had in fact ever tried and<br/>
found out.  Now you have answered.<br/>

Perhaps if you&#39;d been clearer at first they wouldn&#39;t have asked.<br/>

Well I won&#39;t just drop it because there may be others here wondering about<br/>
the very same thing in their own homes. I wasn&#39;t at all being sarcastic. I<br/>
was sincerely asking you how long you watched him eat only sweets. Now you<br/>
say that you didn&#39;t. You say you know he would, but you can&#39;t possibly know<br/>
that unless you watched him eat only sweet things for a year. You are<br/>
assuming your child will make unhealthy choices for his life without really<br/>
knowing he will. That&#39;s a key point in a lot of what has been said here<br/>
recently. You&#39;re not getting it and that&#39;s fine. But no reason to get upset<br/>
and accuse me of being sarcastic when I wasn&#39;t while you do try to get it.<br/>
Again, if one doesn&#39;t question as to how to always do better, one won&#39;t know<br/>
there is a better.<br/>

<br/>
Clear thinking can only come across through clear writing.<br/>
<br/>
In casual and polite conversations we often look past the words people use<br/>
and guess at what they mean. That way people who aren&#39;t as talented at<br/>
putting thoughts into words can relax and participate too. People can throw<br/>
around words like &quot;never&quot; and &quot;always&quot; and other people can guess from the<br/>
context whether it&#39;s literally never or always or just a virtual never or<br/>
always.<br/>
<br/>
But on this list being precise in wording *is* important. We aren&#39;t trading<br/>
opinions of what we believe to be true. We&#39;re discussing principles and<br/>
logic and real life examples of children raised in joy and freedom.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In the &quot;regular world&quot; there are few families that have ever allowed their<br/>

say they know) that their children would make bad choices.<br/>
<br/>
But in families where children have the support to make their own decisions,<br/>
they do in the long run choose wisely. There isn&#39;t a reason for a child to<br/>
only eat sweets if the sweets aren&#39;t forbidden. Some kids do have a sweet<br/>
tooth and will eat more sweets than a mother would choose for the child but<br/>
they do eat more nutritious food and balance out their diets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252835615">And in regard to the below the thing that got me to think and <br/>
understand was when it was brought up that this {including <br/>
restrictions on television - personally my main hang-up was the so <br/>
called mindless cartoons- or anything else} was more about MY comfort <br/>
level and what *I* had been told and believed. And therefore I <br/>
believed such and such would happen, when in reality is was really <br/>
just a worked up fear.<br/>
<br/>
I am and have always been a relaxed mom for the most part. Especially <br/>
comparing me with other mothers I know. And even if I don&#39;t agree <br/>
with a tiny portion of what it said, It still pushes me to THINK and <br/>
then THINK AGAIN. And thereby I am working on areas where I do <br/>
sometimes become more anal retentive then is necessary. And those <br/>
areas I do tend to be a bit more defensive about. <br/>
<br/>
But like is always said sometimes it&#39;s better to just read along and <br/>
get a feel for the list and reactions {especially if you tend to have <br/>
a defensive nature} and take what you need, make a note and work on <br/>
those areas in your personal life if you DO find there is need for <br/>
improvement and work on it in your personal life.<br/>
<br/>
Also change isn&#39;t something that happens overnight. So it&#39;s advisable <br/>
not to tell the kids,&lt;example&gt; &quot;From now on you can eat anything you <br/>
want to. I won&#39;t say anything to you about it, anymore.&quot;. LOL  <br/>
It&#39;s tends to be a much easier transition change a bit at a time. And <br/>
to do so just by doing not by saying you are going to do it. <br/>
Especially if there is a lot to change.{metaphorically speaking it&#39;s <br/>
like} Trying to a remodel your whole house in one week and expecting <br/>
not to get burned out and disgusted. It&#39;s easier and tends to be more <br/>
permanent I think when we have a clear understanding and work it out <br/>
with in ourselves and know why we are choosing to parent this way, <br/>
and do a bit of it at a time. And hopefully in the end we will be in <br/>
a more comfortable atmosphere for us and out kids. :-)<br/>

Keith pulled an easter rabbit out of the cabinet the other day.  I don&#39;t even <br/>
know which kid it belonged to, but it was put back in public pantryspace.  <br/>
Kirby still has Halloween candy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
More evidence:  Marty (14) and I stopped at Furr&#39;s after his long day of <br/>
working out.<br/>
He could have anything he wanted.  He didn&#39;t get salad.  He didn&#39;t get jello. <br/>
 He got potatoes, turkey and dressing, bypassed gravy (though he usually <br/>
loves it, he wasn&#39;t feeling really well and said the grease wouldn&#39;t be good); got <br/>
broccoli (and ate it), got bread, no butter (thought about butter but decided <br/>
against it).  He didn&#39;t even look at the desserts.  His tray was full.  He <br/>
drank an IBC rootbeer and a glass of water.  There&#39;s ice cream.  He wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have gotten any even if he had been feeling great, I don&#39;t think.  He rarely <br/>
chooses ice cream ever.  He had first planned to share my fish, but he was too <br/>
full.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what comes of letting a kid eat what he wants.   I neither praised nor <br/>
teased nor coached him about that stuff.  I wouldn&#39;t have if he had gotten <br/>
jello and pie, either, because he can listen to his own body and doesn&#39;t just <br/>
eat for fun.<br/>
<br/>
He came home, put his uniform in the wash, watched wrestling, and went to <br/>
sleep at 9:10.<br/>
<br/>
This is a kid who honestly can do what he wants to do, and that&#39;s what he <br/>
wanted to do. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; First of all, I&#39;m nothing in this world if I&#39;m not honest.  So, here&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some honesty for you:  Whal the hell is wrong with you, woman?  If I<br/>
said, &quot;Go jump in a lake&quot; or &quot;I thought I was going to die laughing&quot;,<br/>
etc., etc., would you be questioning how literal those statements were? <br/>
Don&#39;t you recognize an expression when you hear one?  Don&#39;t you<br/>
understand that when people make statements such as, &quot;My child would...if<br/>
I let him...&quot;  it&#39;s not meant to be taken so literally?  It&#39;s only meant<br/>
to suggest that, as in my case, the child likes something above and<br/>
beyond what would seem usual.  Come on, do you really think, as in your<br/>
example, the child would literally never, ever, ever turn off the<br/>
Nintendo game--?  Eureka!  We&#39;ve discovered true perpetual motion in our<br/>
son&#39;s room!!  Lighten up.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I don&#39;t have to &quot;sit in&quot; for awhile to discover what this group<br/>
is all about.  As one of my favorite professors used to say, &quot;I only have<br/>
to smell perfume to know a woman&#39;s been in the room.&quot;  I haven&#39;t made up<br/>
my mind yet about &quot;unschooling&quot;, but I&#39;ll tell you, my brief experience<br/>
with this group has taught me volumes.  You folks talk about preventing<br/>
your children from being exposed to rude people -- well, maybe you need<br/>
to reconsider your definition of rude.  You need to walk the walk.  From<br/>
what I&#39;ve seen here, it sounds like you&#39;re raising your children in some<br/>
collective bubble, and if this is the direction unschooling is taking,<br/>
then the &quot;experiment&quot; is doomed to fail. Exposure to negative elements in<br/>
life can provide some immunity for children down the road, when they&#39;re<br/>
on their own -- much the same way that exposure to certain viruses, etc.,<br/>
provides defenses against further attack.  How is a child to learn to<br/>
tolerate frustration if mommy and daddy never allow frustration in<br/>
his/her life?  The ability to handle frustration is one of the gifts we<br/>
possess as humans, but it&#39;s a skill that needs to be honed, as with any<br/>
other skill.  Delaying gratification is another very necessary &quot;skill&quot; we<br/>
need to teach.  Allowing children -- who are not just little adults --<br/>
free rein over absolutely everything that affects their lives is doing<br/>
them a great disservice.  It&#39;s hedonism gone berserk!!<br/>
<br/>
You say you&#39;re giving your children &quot;freedom&quot; to choose their own paths,<br/>
but are you really?  Isn&#39;t this whole &quot;unschooling&quot; concept just another<br/>
form of brainwashing, of manipulation?.  Whatever happened to children<br/>
needing boundaries?  How can anyone, in good conscience, allow children<br/>
to choose their own boundaries to the extent that you all seem to be<br/>
doing?  You all just seem to be feeding off of each other with no clear<br/>
direction.  It&#39;s some type of dysfunction disguised as good parenting. <br/>
Bullshit!!  There are some things you just shouldn&#39;t mess with, one of<br/>
them being human nature.  Children seek and need limitations in their<br/>
lives.  They don&#39;t need to be wholly left to their own devices -- that&#39;s<br/>
why they are children and we are adults!  And this whole thing about<br/>
letting the child choose what he/she is interested in. Okay, that&#39;s good<br/>
-- to a point.  If I hadn&#39;t insisted when my kids were younger on their<br/>
participating in certain events, taking up certain activities, etc., they<br/>
never would have discovered their true interest in those activities. <br/>
This extreme position I&#39;m seeing here, which you define as &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
is looking more and more like laziness to me.  Let the kid play video<br/>
games all day, what the hell -- I&#39;ll just read this book I&#39;ve wanted to<br/>
read, or watch my soaps, blah, blah. Give me a break!  What you&#39;re doing<br/>
is inviting criticism and, ultimately, disgust.  It&#39;s a form of covert<br/>
child abuse.  You&#39;ve got a cult thing going on here, and you&#39;re convinced<br/>
you&#39;re doing the right thing.  I shudder to think of a future world<br/>
populated by unschooled automatons.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Vegetarianism does not necessarily equal healthy and nutritious.  I know<br/>
this firsthand since I am a vegetarian, too.  However, my children are given<br/>
a full refrigerator and cupboards of food and they pick out lots of things<br/>
at the grocery store every time we go.  They&#39;ve never been coerced to eat<br/>
anything and they are the ones that have the healthiest diets in my family.<br/>
DH and I grew up with lots of food restrictions and we find comfort in the<br/>
foods that we snuck as children.  I&#39;m slowly &quot;Undieting&quot;, but I can see that<br/>
it is going to take a long time to undo all the years of food teaching that<br/>
was done to me.  Thankfully, my children will never have to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Today, we had a picnic with another wonderful homeschooling family (I&#39;m<br/>
finally starting to find some).  My 2.5 yo daughter was given the option to<br/>
eat whatever she wanted.  She chose 3-4 potato chips for an appetizer,<br/>
grapes for her main course, and a couple of apple slices for dessert, with<br/>
only water to quench her thirst.  Her choice and she stopped eating the<br/>
second that she was full and she refused to eat anymore.  It brought back<br/>
memories of not being allowed to have the chips until the &quot;healthy&quot; sandwich<br/>
was eaten, eating the sandwich and being full, but still downing as many<br/>
chips as I possibly could just so that I could finally have them (then I&#39;d<br/>
eat the dessert, too, and I usually didn&#39;t even like it).  I&#39;ll never force<br/>
my children to eat or not eat certain foods.  They were naturally born with<br/>
the ability to figure out what to eat and when, I&#39;m not going to teach that<br/>
out of them and I listen to their natural wisdom every day.<br/>
<br/>
-Lisa in AZ<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I just looked in the freezer and saw a pint of ice cream that my 6.75<br/>
yo picked out a few months ago going bad (DH has permission from her to eat<br/>
it now).  It looked good to her at the time, but she claims that grapes just<br/>
taste better and satisfy her more.  She knows her body.  That is wisdom.</div>

of negative elements.  We, unschooling parents, are here to help our<br/>
children deal with them as they experience them in real life situations, not<br/>
pretend situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Delaying gratification is another very necessary &quot;skill&quot; we<br/>
&gt; need to teach.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every child that has wanted a toy or food that a parent couldn&#39;t provide<br/>
right that moment has learned that skill.  My 2.5 yo has to wait for me to<br/>
finish going to the bathroom before I feed her sometimes.  I certainly don&#39;t<br/>
create new unrealistic challenges for her when she&#39;s got real life<br/>
challenges right here to deal with and I am right here to help her deal with<br/>
them.  My 6.75 yo has to wait for me to buy the things that she needs for<br/>
her experiments before she can do them (at least the time it takes to go to<br/>
the store and back, but often until we have the money for it).  That sure<br/>
didn&#39;t have to be taught.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Allowing children -- who are not just little adults --<br/>
&gt; free rein over absolutely everything that affects their lives is doing<br/>
&gt; them a great disservice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed and that is why unschoolers don&#39;t do this- ever.  If you think that<br/>
you&#39;ve read that people do that here, you might want to ask some specific<br/>
questions about what people mean.  I don&#39;t mean to talk for everyone else,<br/>
but I keep reading that not a one of them thinks that a child is an adult,<br/>
but every one of them thinks that children are people.  In the U.S.,<br/>
children are often treated like a lesser class of beings.  In the<br/>
Unschooling environment, they are equals with individual needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Isn&#39;t this whole &quot;unschooling&quot; concept just another<br/>
&gt; form of brainwashing, of manipulation?.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand how and I&#39;m really interested in hearing why you think<br/>
this might be the case.  It is very important to me to never be brainwashed<br/>
on any topic.  Do you think that it is possible to be brainwashed that<br/>
children need to be taught things in order to learn them?  I used to be<br/>
brainwashed that way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Whatever happened to children<br/>
&gt; needing boundaries?  How can anyone, in good conscience, allow children<br/>
&gt; to choose their own boundaries to the extent that you all seem to be<br/>
&gt; doing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For starters, you don&#39;t seem to quite get what the people here are doing.<br/>
After that, you should see that the human race has existed for quite a<br/>
while.  We aren&#39;t born wanting to harm ourselves, why would a child<br/>
naturally want to and why wouldn&#39;t a parent protect that child from<br/>
unintentional harm?  I&#39;ll physically protect any person that I see that is<br/>
close to harm.  I do it all the time in all kinds of situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Don&#39;t bother to reply...I can&#39;t wait to click on UNSUBSCRIBE...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you have already unsubscribed, it is unfortunate.  I hope that your<br/>
unconscious mind is still thinking about what has really been said here.<br/>
Perhaps this thread will help the facts of unschooling be explained for<br/>
other newcomers and help make the world a better place through them and for<br/>
them and their children.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve created an image that will be hard for us to replace by what really<br/>
happens in our lives. And because you&#39;ve created such a repulsive image<br/>
you&#39;re not going to want to look closer at what we do which makes trying to<br/>
get you to see what really is going on even harder.<br/>
<br/>
It takes 1000s of words to explain away a false impression. It may take 10s<br/>
of 1000s of words -- in fact it may never happen -- if someone is determined<br/>
to hold onto that false impression.<br/>
<br/>
It takes far far fewer words if someone is open and willing to listen and<br/>
learn why and how others believe what they believe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Don&#39;t you<br/>
&gt; understand that when people make statements such as, &quot;My child would...if<br/>
&gt; I let him...&quot;  it&#39;s not meant to be taken so literally?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here on this list when discussing children&#39;s behavior we need to use literal<br/>
statements since we&#39;re talking about what does and doesn&#39;t work for kids<br/>
raised in freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the population only know what children raised under control are<br/>
like. They assume the negative behavior they see when they let go of control<br/>
is part of children&#39;s nature not a result of control.<br/>
<br/>
A child who has TV, video games, food controlled will often glut on them<br/>
without control. It&#39;s natural to assume that behavior would continue unless<br/>
parents returned the controls. Most parents believe that to be true.<br/>
<br/>
Which would mean that children who are not controlled would be eating<br/>
nothing but sweets and do nothing but watch TV or play video games.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t happen. if parents trust that children will choose what they<br/>
need, after a transition period, when children trust that something is truly<br/>
unlimited that they can access at any time, then they let go of the need to<br/>
hoard it.<br/>
<br/>
Here we need to discuss honestly what does and doesn&#39;t happen with kids<br/>
because there is no body of &quot;common knowledge&quot; of what will happen with kids<br/>
who are raised in freedom.<br/>
<br/>
But it isn&#39;t unexplored territory. There are people here who are living it<br/>
with happy, joyful children. There are grown unschoolers out in the world.<br/>
There are kids who are about to enter the world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You know, I don&#39;t have to &quot;sit in&quot; for awhile to discover what this group<br/>
&gt; is all about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably true of any group that we can learn a lot more by assuming --<br/>
not accepting but assuming -- that the people in the group are being honest<br/>
and thoughtful. If they say something that strikes us wrong, we&#39;ll get<br/>
better information by asking questions to try to understand why they believe<br/>
something to be true than if we tell them we&#39;re right and they&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If we enter a group curious but determined to hold onto what we believe it&#39;s<br/>
likely we&#39;ll learn little. That protective wall we enter with to defend<br/>
ourselves and our ideas does a good job of screening out ideas that are<br/>
confusing or frightening or seemingly stupid.<br/>
<br/>
But if we check our defensive walls at the door and enter as empty vessels<br/>
we&#39;re likely to learn a lot.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean we need to automatically believe what we hear but we can<br/>
try to understand how others believe it.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing and trying to understand new ideas isn&#39;t like getting a tatoo. It<br/>
isn&#39;t permanent. If we spend a while trying to understand people and ideas<br/>
and the ideas don&#39;t feel right we can drop them like new clothes and put our<br/>
old ones back on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From<br/>
&gt; what I&#39;ve seen here, it sounds like you&#39;re raising your children in some<br/>
&gt; collective bubble, and if this is the direction unschooling is taking,<br/>
&gt; then the &quot;experiment&quot; is doomed to fail. Exposure to negative elements in<br/>
&gt; life can provide some immunity for children down the road<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps not to draw conclusions quickly when learning about anything new.<br/>
Once conclusions are drawn, we start unconsciously paying attention to only<br/>
the information that supports those conclusions and ignoring the information<br/>
that doesn&#39;t fit.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children are out in life. They will naturally encounter rude<br/>
people. Their friends will not always behave nicely. Our children will not<br/>
always behave nicely. They *know* that life isn&#39;t like home. That&#39;s pretty<br/>
much a &quot;duh!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to make children remain in situations that are unpleasant to<br/>
expose them to negative elements. What people in general need is to feel<br/>
*empowered* They need to know they have a choice about the negative<br/>
elements. They don&#39;t have to put up with them. They can change something, or<br/>
walk away from it and find a better path, or decide the end result will be<br/>
worth the negative elements, or ...? But their only choice isn&#39;t to put up<br/>
with something.<br/>
<br/>
By removing them or stepping in or talking about something or helping them<br/>
deal with a situation -- but this is too vague and real examples are *much*<br/>
more fruitful for discussing what we&#39;re talking about -- we&#39;re modeling for<br/>
them what they can do when faced with something they don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How is a child to learn to<br/>
&gt; tolerate frustration if mommy and daddy never allow frustration in<br/>
&gt; his/her life?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How can a child live life without frustration? Being a child *is*<br/>
frustration. Things are up too high. They can&#39;t go places without an adult.<br/>
Days are too long.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to frustrate them more than life naturally will. By removing<br/>
them from a situation or helping them in some way we&#39;re modeling that people<br/>
have the power to protect themselves from things they don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Allowing children -- who are not just little adults --<br/>
&gt; free rein over absolutely everything that affects their lives is doing<br/>
&gt; them a great disservice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then you&#39;ve made assumptions about what we&#39;re talking about and it&#39;s going<br/>
to take 100 times as many words to try to get you to see what we&#39;re really<br/>
talking about. It will take a lot fewer words if you drop the assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
Does it make sense that we&#39;d be giving kids &quot;free rein&quot; as you&#39;re imagining<br/>
it? That we&#39;re all sitting back and letting our kids make decisions in<br/>
vacuum?<br/>
<br/>
So ask. You&#39;ll learn more by asking questions. If something does&#39;t make<br/>
sense, then ask why we believe something to be true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Whatever happened to children<br/>
&gt; needing boundaries?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And that common wisdom conclusion is based on what? On children who are<br/>
controlled and then let loose? On children whose parents are uncaring and<br/>
unaware?<br/>
<br/>
How does that apply to parents who are very aware and very much attentive<br/>
whose children set their own boundaries?<br/>
<br/>
(Boundaries that are set in the real life context of the rest of the<br/>
family&#39;s needs. Though my daughter could -- as could I -- play the stereo at<br/>
full volume at 2AM. But why would she? If she&#39;s treated with respect, there<br/>
isn&#39;t a reason for her to treat others with disrespect. Being conscious of<br/>
others needs isn&#39;t immediate and takes more years for some kids than others.<br/>
But if we understand that they aren&#39;t doing something because they&#39;re mean<br/>
and it&#39;s just because they can&#39;t understand yet we can help them deal with<br/>
it and work towards understanding without controling them and setting up<br/>
rules.)<br/>
<br/>
Most adults would be livid if they were treated as children are treated by<br/>
parents. How would it make a wife feel if her husband told her she had to<br/>
start dinner at 5 or go to bed at 10? We accept that children need to be<br/>
treated differently than adults because &quot;they just have to learn&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an assumptions that should be questioned in the light of parents here<br/>
who are helping their kids be aware of when their bodies are telling them to<br/>
rest rather than telling thier kids the clock knows them better than they<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
If children are treated with disrespect then they will do as was modeled for<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They don&#39;t need to be wholly left to their own devices -- that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; why they are children and we are adults!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a tricky point. There just aren&#39;t the proper words to describe to<br/>
someone who is used to control what freedom means. People often read what&#39;s<br/>
written here and hear &quot;left to their own devices.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Aware parenting isn&#39;t hands off. It&#39;s very hands on. Probably more hands on<br/>
than rules are because we&#39;re helping our children make their own decisions<br/>
rather than setting some rule in place and having them follow it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I hadn&#39;t insisted when my kids were younger on their<br/>
&gt; participating in certain events, taking up certain activities, etc., they<br/>
&gt; never would have discovered their true interest in those activities.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, you don&#39;t know that. It&#39;s an assumption stated as fact.<br/>
<br/>
In general society we hear and see the positive outcomes of children being<br/>
made to do something so it seems like a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
But we can&#39;t see the interests that were killed because a child was made to<br/>
do something against their will.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t know what they would have discovered had they been allowed to make<br/>
their own choices. (Choices in a rich life where they had a variety of<br/>
opportunites to choose from, where the parents were also involved in doing<br/>
interesting things.) If you read long enough you&#39;ll see how parents can<br/>
encourage and make available without making kids do anything.<br/>

Unschooling isn&#39;t starting a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; environment in one&#39;s home.  <br/>
Although I too am still trying to grasp the wholeness of what it is, I think <br/>
that challenging this on this email list is inappropriate... ONLY because the <br/>
home page of the list says that this is for people who already do this... not <br/>
for people like you and me who are curious and trying to see if we are actually <br/>
unschoolers according to what goes on in these folks&#39; lives here who belong to <br/>
this list.  I want to know what it is too... but I don&#39;t want to challenge <br/>
the answers... I just want to know.  If I over time find that I don&#39;t agree, I <br/>
will graciously move on (not that you should move on).  ~Kris<br/>

let them run loose and be hovering at the same time? Unschoolers have <br/>
been accused of both, sometimes by the same person. I can never <br/>

else&#39;s perspective. There are a lot of choices people make, and I try <br/>
my best to truly understand why they do what they do, even when I <br/>
don&#39;t agree with them. And I respect their choice and don&#39;t put them <br/>
down, even if we never agree. <br/>
<br/>
I have had this same phenomenon from family members, and online <br/>
acquaintences on a message board. It can be so frustrating. I call it <br/>
the MOmmy wars. Some parent doing something different than the status <br/>
quo is perceived as some sort of threat, calling into judgement the <br/>
other parent&#39;s own choices. It&#39;s an assumed criticism, responded to <br/>
with condescending assumptions and insults as a self-defense. I have <br/>
seen it with homeschooling, attachment parenting, breastfeeding, stay <br/>
at home mothers. It can get quite ugly. It divides people quicker <br/>
