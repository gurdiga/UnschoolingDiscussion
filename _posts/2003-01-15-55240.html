That is so cool! My husband races too, only it&#39;s a quarter mile at a time<br/>
&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
He is going to Gainesville the end of February, and he has races<br/>
scheduled for Ohio, Indy,  Kentucky, Bakersfield, Darlington, and a few<br/>
others I will probably find out about when it is time to pack. That was<br/>
one of the reasons I was attracted to unschooling. You just never know<br/>
where you will be from week to week, and our children learn so much on<br/>
the road seeing the country. If you and your children go with your<br/>
husband, I&#39;d love to hear of any activities or games you play on the<br/>
road.<br/>

this time around. As long as you have room for a truck and 35&#39; trailer,<br/>
I&#39;ll get in touch with you when the time comes. Sounds great!<br/>

the neighborhood. You might be surrounded and never let out! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Let me know! <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been to Indy, (lived there for a month, two years in a row) though not<br/>
to the drag racing track.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, homeschooling (and ultimately, unschooling) made sense when we were on<br/>
the road with dh, too.  We&#39;ve been home more in the past few years, but it&#39;s<br/>
always easy to pick up and go at a moment&#39;s notice.  We&#39;ve done a lot of<br/>
stuff  and met a lot of people we wouldn&#39;t have if Michelle had been in<br/>
school.<br/>

&gt; road.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure!  We usually fly to where dh is, so we don&#39;t do much in the way of car<br/>
games.  But we take a lot of drawing and colouring stuff, CDs & a portable<br/>
CD player and games for dh&#39;s laptop.  Beanies and playmobil usually find<br/>
their way into our luggage, too. We&#39;ll probably take some card games this<br/>
time, as Michelle is starting to enjoy those.<br/>
<br/>
My dream has been to sell our house, buy a motorhome and travel all over<br/>
North America. If we ever do that, I&#39;ll have some more ideas!<br/>
