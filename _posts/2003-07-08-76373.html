natural and my kids helped me see that. I do know lots of &quot;successful&quot; school at <br/>
homers (Doh!) Most of them seem to be that super organized, super structured <br/>
type. They&#39;ve been very structured with their kids since birth and that has <br/>
simply continued. They tend to have &quot;chores&quot;, their houses are neat and clean, they <br/>
have time for hobbies.<br/>
I think they&#39;re all anal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the more the kids have to do, the more harsh the tactics the parents<br/>
have to have. Unless they&#39;ve got really compliant kids, or have done the<br/>
&quot;groundwork&quot; -- swift no nonsense punishment for disobedience as soon as mom<br/>
felt they were ready to obey -- so their kids know they don&#39;t have a choice<br/>
except to do what mom says.<br/>
<br/>
The one mom I knew who did some school at home, had her kids do those big<br/>
workbooks at the table in the morning. There wasn&#39;t much time required of<br/>
the kids compared to a curriculum. Her attitude appeared to be you don&#39;t<br/>
have a choice, get it over and done with so you can do what you want to do.<br/>
And then repeat as often as necessary, adding volume and firmness. Pretty<br/>
much the attitude and techniques parents use with chores and brushing teeth<br/>
and anything else parents make kids do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which, therein, IMHO, lies the beauty of unschooling.  I&#39;ve not had ONE <br/>
SINGLE FIGHT since I pulled my daughter out of school at the end of her 6th grade <br/>
year over learning.  Now, LOL, we may have a few go-arounds this year, because <br/>
we ABSOLUTELY NEED to do the stuff that she had no interest in (Algebra, for <br/>
one, probably the only, really) since she&#39;s wanting to go to college in 2 <br/>
years.  Other than that, she&#39;s pretty much a self-directed learner.  No fights <br/>
about what to get done.<br/>

Maybe you should do the algebra while she continues as a self-directed learner?&lt;g&gt;<br/>

out of it, I tend towards those thing.  You can be organized, have a neat<br/>

still don&#39;t have to inflict it on your children!  I&#39;m anal to my house and<br/>
especially to my kitchen, so I fulfill my own needs there.  Tim does what he<br/>
wants.  He&#39;s not a total disaster, but he&#39;s definitely not my level of<br/>
organized.  And that&#39;s fine!<br/>

ago that we could keep a cleaner and neater house, but it would ruin <br/>
our relationship.  Now we just blame it on the kids! (little do they <br/>
know....)<br/>
