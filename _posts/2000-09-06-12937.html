We used to live in Vienna and later in Fairfax.  I worked for Congress back<br/>
then (many 60 hour weeks, but I loved it ---I&#39;m a political junkie! )  We<br/>
lived in the DC metro area for 6 1/2 years (in Maryland, at first; then, in<br/>
Virginia).  We left in June of 1993 for me to take a policy position with<br/>
the State of Mississippi.  We had always planed to go back up there (I was<br/>
going to go to law school  and go back to the Hill as an attorney) and my<br/>
hubby, who has a law degree, was going to get his masters in history.<br/>
Well, I never got to law school and the Congress changed from Democratic<br/>
control to that (expletive deleted) bunch we have now.  He didn&#39;t get too<br/>
far along on his masters either.  We even sold our house and moved back up<br/>
there in 1996 thinking that we were going to take back the House!  So much<br/>
for believing in causes (I still believe).  I&#39;m just a bit slower to sell<br/>
the property and move-- we did that FIRST!  You live and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we are in the Texas Hill Country now and have decided to move to the<br/>
NW.  Gonna find jobs and a nice place to live BEFORE we sell the house (&<br/>
very small ranch) this time!<br/>
<br/>
Geez!  Did I go on and on or what?!!!  But I am proud of myself!  I have<br/>
kept quiet through several political discussions and haven&#39;t flamed a soul<br/>
(in quite some time---never have on this list).<br/>

,of course, would be wrong! IMO)  =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Melodie, where in the DC &#39;burbs&#39; are you?  My dh&#39;s db and family<br/>
&gt;live in Fairfax, is that anywhere near you?  We&#39;d love to go over<br/>
&gt;and visit &#39;em, but I kind-of wonder if I&#39;d go nuts, since their life is<br/>
&gt;so opposite ours (bil&#39;s wife went back to work within weeks of<br/>
&gt;birth, as standard, and justified it by saying that they daycare<br/>
&gt;people would be better at it than her, as if that makes a<br/>
&gt;difference, babies need mothers!!!!!!, but I digress, as usual...)<br/>
&gt;So if you are in that neck of the proverbial woods, I&#39;d love to have<br/>
&gt;some contact with someone more on my wavelength while I was<br/>
&gt;there.<br/>
