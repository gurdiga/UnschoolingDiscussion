<div id="ygrps-yiv-197296602">Someone posted a while asking ago about Venn diagrams.  I found this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.venndiagram.com/">http://www.venndiagram.com/</a><br/>
I remember loving Venn diagrams, thinking about things and what they have in<br/>
common and what they don&#39;t and grouping them accordingly.  Probably no surprise I<br/>
became a programmer and Venn diagramming really came in handy.  In real life,<br/>
even!<br/>
