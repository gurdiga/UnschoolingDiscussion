<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Years ago, I came across a book by the Danish religious philosopher <br/>
&gt; Johannes Anker-Larsen.  It was called With the Door Open: My Experience.  A <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; passage from it has always stayed with me:<br/>
&gt;     “The most comprehensive formula for human culture which I know was <br/>
&gt; given by <br/>
&gt; the old peasant who, on his deathbed, obtained from his son this one <br/>
&gt; promise: to sit every day for a half an hour ALONE in the best room.  The <br/>
&gt; son did this and became a model for the whole district.  This father’s <br/>
&gt; command has take thought for everything, for Eternity, soul-deepening, <br/>
&gt; refinement, history.”<br/>
&gt;     I’ve thought a good deal about the meaning of that passage.  When I see <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; baby quietly staring at his or her hands….or a toddler off in a corner <br/>
&gt; putting something into a cup and then taking it out, over and over again… <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; a preschooler lying in the grass daydreaming… I like to think that they, in <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; their own ways, are “alone in the best room” of their houses, using the <br/>
&gt; solitude they need to find the courage to grow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, this moved me deeply, and I thank you for sharing it, Jennifer.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a Class-A jerk in many ways, but as is true of a lot of abusive <br/>
people, he had his deep and charming side as well.  I tend to focus on his <br/>
negatives and forget the many positive things he gave me.  I wonder if he <br/>
read Anker-Larsen?<br/>
<br/>
I have early memories of a *Thinking Bench* right outside our back door when <br/>
I was little -- about 5.  Daddy used to make me sit there every day.  I hated <br/>
it at first, and felt like I was being punished, but I wasn&#39;t.  This was <br/>
never related to punishment at all (he had much more creative ways of doing <br/>
that.)  I don&#39;t know how long I was required to sit.  It was likely too long <br/>
for a 5 year old, but it still worked its magic on me, over time.  I found <br/>
inner stillness on that bench.  I had my first experiences of BEING.  Even I <br/>
recognized that it was a prfound experience, although I certainly didn&#39;t use <br/>
that word when I thought of it -- it was just a magical time for me.  <br/>
Remembering it still is.  Being taught the value of solitude at such a young <br/>
and highly impressionable age.  I KNOW this changed me.  What a gift.<br/>
