<div id="ygrps-yiv-454837998">Is there a natural remedy for arthritis pain?  I have it in my dominant<br/>
hand, and possibly nerve damage <br/>
<br/>
Hi Amber,<br/>
<br/>
One thing to remember is different types of arthritis responds differently<br/>
to different drugs.<br/>
What type have they diagnosed you with?  <br/>
<br/>
Why a doc gave you pain meds for arthritis and nothing else is beyond me<br/>
... this was not<br/>
a rheumotologist I would hope - just a reg. MD, correct?  <br/>
<br/>
I have had arthritis since I was 13 y/o and have it in every joint of my<br/>
body.  However, I rarely<br/>
deal with pain anymore and when I do it is isolated to one or two joints at<br/>
a time (Thank God)<br/>
What works from me is dependent on how bad it is at the time but here are<br/>
some alternatives to try:<br/>
<br/>
1) hot wax machine ($50 at the store) you dip your hand in perofin (Wax)<br/>
and it does wonders:)<br/>
2) aleve - over the counter<br/>
3) take a lot of calcium, vit b and d<br/>
4) shark cartilidge is suppose to help with many forms of arthritis<br/>
5) I am not sure of spelling but panathentic acid .... take it regular to<br/>
clean out system and boost immune<br/>
<br/>
and ask doc about things like naproxen or other antiinflammatories instead<br/>
of treating the pain with heavy meds<br/>
that wreck yer system tell him to fix the root cause with something easy on<br/>
the system - inflammation causes <br/>
the pain (and the wreckage of joints)<br/>
<br/>
I STRONGLY suggest one of those wax machines when arthritis is in your<br/>
hands it feels like you have new hands when <br/>
you take them out - it is wonderful and sooooo soothing when the wax is on<br/>
too<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335066351">I found this &quot;tip&quot; submitted to Family Fun Magazine by<br/>
a reader from Ohio:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have found a wonderful (sic) way to encourage my<br/>
two children to help with household chores. Every<br/>
week, Megan, age 14, and Cole, 11, earn points for<br/>
each job they complete and then use these points for<br/>
privileges and activities. For instance, dusting or<br/>
vacuuming earns them 10 points, giving the dog a bath<br/>
is worth 15 points, and mowing the lawn nets them 70<br/>
points.Megan and Cole redeem the points they&#39;ve earned<br/>
for activities such as seeing a movie or having dinner<br/>
with a friend(25 points each), going to a school<br/>
football game or inviting a friend to sleep over (50<br/>
points each).Any points left over at the end of the<br/>
week can be turned in for money.This system has really<br/>
motivated my kids to pitch in and make our home run<br/>
more smoothly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I see so much truly fucked-up thinking here I hardly<br/>
know where to start. Let me ask this person (who<br/>
admittedly is not here to defend herself) a few<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
1. And what motivates YOU to pitch in and make your<br/>
house run smoothly?<br/>
<br/>
2. If your kids live in the house, why do they need to<br/>
be bribed to keep it nice if you don&#39;t need to be?<br/>
<br/>
3. Do YOU get points? And what do you turn them in<br/>
for?<br/>
<br/>
4. Who gives them this money at the end of the week?<br/>
And does anyone give YOU money at the end of the week<br/>
for YOUR share of the work?<br/>
<br/>
5. How will your kids be motivated to keep their<br/>
houses nice as adults? <br/>
<br/>
6. Do you bribe your husband too? 80 points equals the<br/>
missionary positions, 100 points for a oral sex?<br/>
<br/>
7. Don&#39;t your kids deserve to go to football games or<br/>
have friends over without having to earn the<br/>
privilege?<br/>
<br/>
8. How many points do they get for flushing the toilet<br/>
or breathing or going to the library?<br/>
<br/>
9. You&#39;re teaching your kids that keeping your home<br/>
nice is a dreadful chore that can only be borne with<br/>
the right reward. How about giving them 50 points for<br/>
playing basketball and letting them turn that in for<br/>
the privilege of vacuuming.<br/>
<br/>
10. Why are the traditionally female jobs only 10<br/>
points while the stereotypically male job of mowing<br/>
the lawn is 70 points. I&#39;d like to know who does which<br/>
chores in your family.<br/>
<br/>
Any more questions? Fling them my way. I want to write<br/>
to the editor with this response. They&#39;ll probably<br/>
edit out the oral sex stuff, but I can change that to<br/>
something else. <br/>
<br/>
Juli, whose daughter is vacuuming to rave music<br/>
because she wants the house nice for the exchange<br/>
student, not because I&#39;ll &quot;allow&quot; her to watch<br/>
football later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702269421">Juli, I think you raise some good questions.  At the same time, I have <br/>
to confess that I can understand how the woman came up with a system like <br/>
that.  I have tried to figure out the best way to deal with chores for years. <br/>
 I don&#39;t think they&#39;re less pleasant just because we assign points or <br/>
whatever to them and call them a chore whereas we call basketball fun.  I <br/>
think they truly are less pleasant!<br/>
     I posted on here one time before about making up chore cards for us and <br/>
using them...having each kid pick 6 of them for 3 days out of the week <br/>
(though sometimes we end up doing it only 1 or 2  days) and then I go through <br/>
the ones I pull out and work through them as well.  It sounds regimented and <br/>
most unschoolers, including me, tend to dislike regimentation.  But for us, <br/>
this worked a lot better than trying to just clean as we go, as needed, <br/>
because it seemed like only the same main things got done all the time and <br/>
other things never got done.  <br/>
     I agree in principle that the kids should care about the housework and <br/>
help with it simply because they live there, just like the adults.  However, <br/>
I have found in practice that they have a really high tolerance for a mess, <br/>
much higher than mine, and mine is pretty relaxed.  I have also found that <br/>
they themselves feel better if we keep it fairly clean, especially if we find <br/>
ways that seem fairly painless.<br/>
     I think my main objection to her method would be that it sounds like a <br/>
big hassle.  Also, I agree that the things the points are being redeemed for <br/>
should be things the kids can do anyway. <br/>
      What do you think about kids getting money of their own...should it be <br/>
a set amount regardless of what they do or should it be based upon some sort <br/>
of earning situation?  Right now ours is tied to the chore cards but I have <br/>
done it the other way as well.  We have even done it where we figured out the <br/>
total amount of spending money left at the end of the week or month and <br/>
divided it up or got together to decide how to use it.  Surprisingly, my kids <br/>
didn&#39;t really like that method even though I liked the principle of it.<br/>
     One thing we try to do is let each person do the chores he/she likes <br/>
more.  Jonathan, my 12 year old, loves gardening so he doesn&#39;t mind watering <br/>
the plants as one of his chores.  Even with those we don&#39;t love, there will <br/>
be one person who hates cleaning the bathroom and another one who doesn&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s that bad but hates sweeping (we have a lot of sweeping because our <br/>
house is all tile and wood floors and we live in a dusty area).  The chore <br/>
cards give them the chance to pick out what they want.  We take turns picking <br/>
and take turns with who gets to have first pick.<br/>
     Hope you don&#39;t think my logic is screwed up as well....just trying to be <br/>
honest...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923239814">I think any chore or anything at all that we do in life can be viewed in a <br/>
negative way. Kids learn that chores are not fun from us. . . and so maybe <br/>
the solution to getting kids to help out with chores lies within each of us <br/>
and changing our own attitude about them. Kids are such great mirrors for us <br/>
. . . sometimes we sure don&#39;t like what we see, but there it is anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165344972">Our son gets a set allowance every week, but if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t do one of his chores and somebody else has to<br/>
do it, he has to pay them for the work they did on his<br/>
behalf out of his savings (he&#39;s very profligate with<br/>
*our* money, but very thrifty with his own, and hates<br/>
having to spend it on that sort of thing).  More of a<br/>
&#39;real life&#39; deal... he&#39;d have to pay a cleaning<br/>
service to clean, so it&#39;s reasonable for him to pay a<br/>
person acting as a cleaning service.  This is<br/>
important to us because we tend towards the<br/>
disorganized ourselves, so it can get chaotic in here<br/>
pretty quickly, and our son clearly inherited a<br/>
tolerence for mess in spades... once when I asked him<br/>
why he was so resistant to picking up the toys on his<br/>
bedroom floor, he said &#39;because then it wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>
like home!&#39;   &lt;blush&gt;<br/>

This is too much in the vein of school acheivement reward programs. Do it for the reward, not for personal responsibility. This is &quot;our&quot; house, and if we don&#39;t take care of it, we suffer the consequece.

<br/>
1) hot wax machine ($50 at the store) you dip your hand in perofin (Wax) and it does wonders:)<br/>

I&#39;d propose to him that just because he sees something arthritis-like doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean you don&#39;t have nerve damage from getting hit in the hand by an airbag.  <br/>
You could have both.<br/>

In labor I crushed a nerve which I can&#39;t spell (cyatic?  Psyatic?  Down the <br/>
outside of my leg, to the top of my foot, someone spell, please; thanks).  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t lift my foor for weeks, but it got well.  The remaining damage might <br/>
not be from that.  The fourth toe on that leg is number than the rest.  But I <br/>
also broke that leg badly the year before I had Kirby, and so the nerve <br/>
damage could be from that.  <br/>
<br/>
Hands are full of nerves.  If one was tweaked, it will probably calm down and <br/>
recover.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Our son gets a set allowance every week, but if he<br/>
 doesn&#39;t do one of his chores and somebody else has to<br/>
 do it, he has to pay them for the work they did on his<br/>
 behalf out of his savings ( &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     This is an interesting take on the whole thing.  I have read through <br/>
everyone&#39;s posts on this and it does help me think about different ways of <br/>
doing things.  This whole issue is one that I&#39;m not firmly set on as far as <br/>
our own methods.<br/>
     I have at times gone with the method where I just tell everyone it&#39;s <br/>
time to clean for a while but my three older kids didn&#39;t like that because <br/>
they wanted the freedom to do the work when they wanted to.  I found that <br/>
everything felt more free and relaxed when I just let them figure out when <br/>
they would do the work within the day or even which three days of the week <br/>
they wanted to do the main chores on.  They do help out a lot in smaller ways <br/>
that aren&#39;t accounted for in any way, like getting food or drink for a <br/>
younger brother sometimes.<br/>
     Part of this may be different in families with a lot of kids.  I have <br/>
found that one of my kids will work really hard and fast to finish a chore <br/>
and the other two will go pretty slowly or even stop a lot of times so it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem fair to have everyone race through housework for an hour but <br/>
have the main work fall on him and me.  And I don&#39;t want to have to keep <br/>
policing them so it seems easier for them to just pick out chores and get <br/>
them done on their own time.  If they choose not to do them and someone else <br/>
has to, it seems like there should be some kind of natural consequence but <br/>
not one that is overly harsh.  That&#39;s why I ended up tying it to weekly pay.  <br/>
If they want to have more time, they can skip the work and just not get as <br/>
much money (which they sometimes choose to do).<br/>
     To me, this kind of thing does seem to relate to real life as an adult.  <br/>
If we want more time than money, we choose to work less.  If we want people <br/>
to do our share of domestic work, we have to pay them, as Eileen says.  I <br/>
think I will do it this way from now on, too...paying them the set amount at <br/>
the beginning of the week and then having them pay whoever does their share <br/>
of the work if they decide not to.  But they usually don&#39;t have a big issue <br/>
with doing their share.<br/>

helping me think out a lot of these issues and I like things that make me <br/>

the ideas I hear are more likely to be in tune with my own values...not <br/>
degrading kids, not punishing them, not being as materialistic as our general <br/>
society, giving all the people in the family as much freedom as possible to <br/>
do things they love doing, etc...<br/>
