<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725086817">We had cloud cover here in Michigan too.  I&#39;m so glad Lynda was able to see it and take  photos...I&#39;m jealous! :-}  I was running around the house outside in the snow and the cold with my slippers on looking for the darn thing, but noooo I couldn&#39;t even find it.  What I site I must of been with my nose in the air, wondering around like that.  The things we do for our kidos!Robin</div>
