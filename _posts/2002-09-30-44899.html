<br/>
I was playing with my dog and feeding her in the spaghetti-sauce pan, and <br/>
didn&#39;t watch any TV today.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not interested in what dogs eat, etc etc.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was about unschooling, at first, not at all about what dogs eat.<br/>
<br/>
It was about the philosophical issues of making decision for other beings, <br/>
and double checking whether those decisions are really being made <br/>
thoughtfully and in light of natural needs and instincts and realities, or <br/>
because of cultural tradition and sales/marketting considerations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you missed that aspect of it.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of using a post to discuss other posts, next time discuss <br/>
unschooling.  You have as much right and power to guide the conversation as <br/>
anyone.  Sitting on the side telling other people what to discuss is NOT the <br/>
same as joining the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Did anyone see &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; tonight?  He had <br/>
some &quot;unschooling&quot; thoughts...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Like what?  Your post didn&#39;t get to the good part.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, I assume they&#39;re all unschooling dogs... and a group of unschoolers<br/>
learning about dogs sounds like unschooling to me. I kept careful mental<br/>
notes, since we&#39;ve been looking for The Perfect Dog for a few months now<br/>
and I know he&#39;s coming soon. Of course, I&#39;ve been looking at heelers or<br/>
German shepherds, and Rain just told me she&#39;d really prefer a chocolate<br/>
lab or a greyhound... but we&#39;ll figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t watch TV tonight because we spent the day watching videos that<br/>
are due tomorrow. Rain had chosen the original Psycho and Carousel (I<br/>
watched the latter with her but not the former, not my cup of tea, but<br/>
she&#39;s in a community theater Carousel that just started rehearsals). I<br/>
chose Children in Heaven (Persian with English subtitles) and Rain<br/>
watched most of it with me, she kept worrying that Ali was going to get<br/>
hit by the dad or the teacher so she&#39;d leave for a while. We liked it but<br/>
didn&#39;t quite get the ending... <br/>
<br/>
What did Raymond have to say?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We didn&#39;t watch TV tonight.  My husband&#39;s out of town and we ordered<br/>
pizza and read and played Yahtzee.<br/>
We have an old cat with kidney failure and he gets subcutaneous fluids,<br/>
60cc&#39;s every day.  It&#39;s getting harder and harder to give him the shots<br/>
because he&#39;s developing scar tissue and it&#39;s starting to hurt, and we<br/>
spent a long time talking about what we should do and whether we were<br/>
helping now or harming and what we would want if it was one of us.  The<br/>
shot went smoothly tonight, and Dylan held him for a long time and talked<br/>
to him while he tapped Dylan&#39;s nose with his paw.  His name is Mr. Fuzz,<br/>
and he&#39;s seventeen, so he&#39;s been with me seven years longer than my son,<br/>
who is ten.  My oldest dog is twelve, and she is an unschooler through<br/>
and through.  Thinking about how we treat our friends and companions is<br/>
just part of the big picture.  I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t see it.   <br/>
But now you can tell us about Raymond.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just have to say that although I&#39;m sure these posts don&#39;t interest <br/>
everyone, not everything talked about will. I delete too when something just <br/>
doesn&#39;t apply to me or if it has gotten old for me. Isn&#39;t that why we <br/>
subject the posts? But with unschooling, isn&#39;t everything of interest to <br/>
someone a time to learn more and share, no matter what the topic is? I <br/>
certainly have learned some things here with all this dog talk and although <br/>
it might not be life altering, I have enjoyed it and extended my knowledge. <br/>
Pokemon doesn&#39;t interest me in the least but if I deleted my brain everytime <br/>
my kids told me a made up story and made up their own Pokemon movies for me <br/>
to watch, what would that do to them? I hope to have at least a little <br/>
knowledge about a lot of things so I can share and learn and grow right <br/>
along with my kids and friends and family too.<br/>

Oh if I could only trust my dogs like my kids to do the right thing. In my <br/>
case it would be for my Bullmastiff puppy not to eat the house every time I <br/>
looked the other way!!!!! Maybe we&#39;ll get there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck searching, that&#39;s half the fun. My Sierra was promised a puppy for <br/>
her 6th birthday this past year. We started our searching months ahead of <br/>
time. We have an all breed encyclopedia and also got a copy of Dog World <br/>
magazine and she looked for what appealed to her. Then we would hit the <br/>
internet and decided whether it was a good choice for the family and dog. We <br/>
learned so much and even my son, who is not a pet lover, got interested in <br/>
the whole origin thing with each breed. It was a fun and a great experience <br/>
for the whole family. Sierra finally decided on a Beagle and Kelli is not <br/>
almost 11 months now. The Bullmastiff was my husbands birthday present!!!<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind the Humane Society and rescue groups are great places to adopt <br/>
too. It all depends on what you are looking for. Have fun!<br/>
