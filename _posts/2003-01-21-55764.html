<div id="ygrps-yiv-352056315">Hi all:<br/>
I need some perspectives, please! My 13yod, after being unschooled her whole<br/>
life, decided to try middle school last year.  She started in October,<br/>
stayed 5 days, said &quot;It&#39;s interfering with my life...&quot; and stopped. One girl<br/>
that she met there has called sometimes.  Jayme and her got together to go<br/>
shopping yesterday. Now, Jme wants to try middle school again, in March,<br/>
after she goes down to visits friends in February, flying back and forth<br/>
unaccompanied! Help! There has been so much change this year-we moved 1000<br/>
miles in April, she&#39;s in dance, 4h, the yearbook committee, 2 youth in<br/>
philanthropy projects, and she baby-sits and works for an elderly neighbor.<br/>
I think she has a cool life with out adding #@$%&*! school to it.<br/>
I also think my comfort level has to have something to do with the equation.<br/>
Let&#39;s hear what ya&#39;ll think...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well Robyn, I can&#39;t offer any help but I&#39;m curious what some others would do <br/>
or has done as well. I use to think that I would never let my kids go to <br/>
school, but after being on the list, I&#39;ve changed my mind. Thinking that if <br/>
they really wanted to bad enough and were aware of what it entailed, I would <br/>
let them try. Now you have brought up another good point. How many times <br/>
should they keep trying? I know the back and forth would be a lot for me.<br/>
<br/>
Tara has a friend from grade school yet that really wants to attend the <br/>
private school Tara does. She does sometimes but when her parents run out of <br/>
money, she attends the local high school. She goes to public school for a <br/>
couple of weeks and then back at the private school for a couple of weeks. <br/>
This has been going on for 2 years. I honestly don&#39;t know how she does it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lets see.  She stayed 5 days the last time.  My guess is that she&#39;ll stay<br/>
even fewer days this time.  Like she said.  It interfered with her life.<br/>
She&#39;s probably just forgotten *how much* it interfered last time.  I&#39;d let<br/>
her do it and hope that she gets at least one of the kind of teacher my<br/>
granddaughter got when she tried school for a week.  That teacher was<br/>
perfect for our purposes (convincing her that school wasn&#39;t for her).<br/>

My daughter went to 5th grade for a few days and came home.  Then she did cyberschool.  Then she quit bec. she wanted to homeschool.  Now she wants to go back to school.  I am making her wait until the beginning of next year because the honest truth is she really does not know what she wants to do (yet).<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I am talking with her about her friends&#39; idea of fun being different than hers because they have so much less freedom to start with.<br/>
