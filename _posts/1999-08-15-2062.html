<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387163446">Hi there Candice in OK, mother of Abigail!<br/>
you wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;she is asking me when I am going to start teaching my dd to read.&quot;<br/>
BELIEVE that you don&#39;t have to &quot;Teach&quot; her to read.  If she wants to read<br/>
she will when she&#39;s ready.  She doesn&#39;t need to read at 2 when there are so<br/>
many other things to be doing and she has you and Kevin to read to her.  If<br/>
she wants to, great, but why should it be a big deal? My older 2 (now 20 &<br/>
18) were both late readers and then when Cody was younger I saw all these<br/>
signs of &quot;early readiness&quot; and I was so excited thinking he would be an<br/>
early reader - but no, he still has those &quot;readiness&quot; signs, but the reading<br/>
hasn&#39;t clicked.  He&#39;s 7 1/2 and I guess he&#39;s going to be like the other 2<br/>
and we still have a year or 2 before it does.  Aren&#39;t there a lot more fun<br/>
things you and Abigail can be doing that don&#39;t involve flash cards!<br/>
<br/>
My niece was a very early reader - but she was not gonna&#39; use that potty!<br/>
and she didn&#39;t have any hair so my sister has pictures of her at about 4<br/>
reading to her twin bro and sis - so cute - &quot;3 babies&quot; sitting on a couch<br/>
reading together!  Then she didn&#39;t do anything very different with the<br/>
twins, in fact probably did less since she was busier - and sure enough, Amy<br/>
starts reading even sooner than her sister but Tom still wasn&#39;t reading when<br/>
he stared school.  Same household, same opportunities, but he wasn&#39;t ready<br/>
so he didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; himself.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you gently relate to your mother and grandmother that their<br/>
great acomplishments of &quot;teaching&quot; you and your sister to read were really<br/>
YOUR OWN acomplishments!  Hmm - probably better leave that alone!<br/>
But do try to believe that you don&#39;t need to teach Abigail to read now.  If<br/>
she wants your help she will let you know, and there&#39;s plenty of time before<br/>
reading independently becomes important to her - I&#39;m sure she would much<br/>
rather snuggle up with you and a good book (or maybe 20 good books)<br/>
<br/>
Relax!  Becky<br/>

Yes!  Thank you!  I would much rather spend my time with her watching bugs <br/>
crawling on our back steps or playing her newest version of &quot;baseball&quot; (which <br/>
involves a huge inflatable yellow ball and her plastic shovel as the bat!) -- <br/>
or whatever else she is excited about at the moment.  If only the rest of my <br/>
family saw the value in these &quot;lessons&quot; as well -- maybe in time.<br/>
