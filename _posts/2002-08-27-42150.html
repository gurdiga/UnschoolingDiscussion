<br/>
Leslie, you are another mother who sees that schools damage children. This<br/>
list seems to be made up of people who realize that, while the &quot;leaders&quot;<br/>
seem in denial about it and don&#39;t want us to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, the damage is exactly what most of us are trying to avoid, and if<br/>
we don&#39;t recognize it, we won&#39;t be able to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Leslie continues:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;my three older children are also<br/>
&gt;deschooling from their experiences, so they have a<br/>
&gt;double whammy.  My younger son who has never been in<br/>
&gt;school is probably more ahead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, I&#39;d like to ask you, Leslie, to describe how you believe schools<br/>
&quot;reinforce dysfunction,&quot; and how you feel that your former attitudes also<br/>
did similar damage to your kids, and what you do in your unschooling not to<br/>
damage your kids the way schools do.<br/>

<br/>
WE KNOW THAT. We are trying to do something about it. Thiis list focuses on<br/>
only ONE of the ways to change.<br/>
This list is to help others find positive proactive ways to spend out days<br/>
learning with our children.<br/>
Why in the world should we spend our time focusing on something that we have<br/>
already  rejected?<br/>
The simple act of removing our children speaks volumes about our opinion of<br/>
schooling.<br/>
So here&#39;s my response to you:<br/>
You are absolutely right Ned, schools suck. So my kids are out of them.<br/>
NOW WHAT? What do I do with my children? How do I look at life from Outside<br/>
the school mindset? I know you have answers, I&#39;ve been to your website, it<br/>
is a positive joyful look at learning outside of school. Why is your writing<br/>
and thoughts so different here?<br/>
How about helping us out with these questions?<br/>
Think of it this way, We read &quot;How Children Fail&quot; and &quot;Dumbing us Down&quot;, we<br/>
agreed and discovered unschooling. Now we are on to &quot;So what do I do on<br/>
Monday?&quot;<br/>

those who&#39;ve been here for a long time. I personally have repeated over and<br/>
over that I understand the damage that schools do. I&#39;ve repeated over and<br/>
over that this list is for helping people move on. We don&#39;t need to turn<br/>
every conversation to it in order to recognize it. When school damage comes<br/>
up *in the natural flow of conversation* it gets discussed. People do get<br/>
help to deal with it and help to move on. Yes, it is like therapy.<br/>

Why is that so difficult to understand?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe that&#39;s what I&#39;m not getting.  It is possible to focus on only <br/>
one aspect of unschooling (the day to day) but it sometimes is <br/>
necessary to force oneself to not go to other aspects of the <br/>
conversation which flow naturally.  For example, one big thing that <br/>
drew me to unschooling was the idea that schools don&#39;t work.  They&#39;re <br/>
terrible, awful places for children to be.  And once I acknowledged <br/>
that, I had to acknowledge that creating a school in the home didn&#39;t <br/>
work.  I described myself as a relaxed homeschooler with unschooling <br/>
leanings for YEARS before I finally was able to let go and totally <br/>
unschool.  For years after first considering unschooling I NEEDED to <br/>
talk about how terrible schools are before I was able to accept that <br/>
unschooling was the best way to go.  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that there will be a lot of people who are looking into <br/>
unschooling that will need to go through a similar process.  Some <br/>
people get it right away, but others need to internalize just how bad <br/>
school is before they can UNschool.  <br/>
<br/>
To say that this list won&#39;t be willing to talk about how terrible <br/>
schools are and discuss all the things we need to do politically to <br/>
take the power away from them is fine.  The list owners have the <br/>
right to make their list whatever they want and after this, I&#39;ll let <br/>
it go.  But if they are unwilling to discuss it, this list isn&#39;t <br/>
really for all those considering unschooling, it&#39;s for those who have <br/>
already come to terms with the terribleness of school and the <br/>
rightness of unschooling and are ready to discuss day to day.  And <br/>
sometimes you won&#39;t be able to allow things to flow naturally and <br/>
there will be holes in the conversation because we&#39;d be cutting some <br/>
of the (political, school bashing) stuff out.  <br/>

one aspect of unschooling (the day to day) but it sometimes is <br/>
necessary to force oneself to not go to other aspects of the <br/>
conversation which flow naturally.  For example, one big thing that <br/>
drew me to unschooling was the idea that schools don&#39;t work.  They&#39;re <br/>
terrible, awful places for children to be.  And once I acknowledged <br/>
that, I had to acknowledge that creating a school in the home didn&#39;t <br/>
work.  I described myself as a relaxed homeschooler with unschooling <br/>
leanings for YEARS before I finally was able to let go and totally <br/>
unschool.  For years after first considering unschooling I NEEDED to <br/>
talk about how terrible schools are before I was able to accept that <br/>
unschooling was the best way to go.  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that there will be a lot of people who are looking into <br/>
unschooling that will need to go through a similar process.  Some <br/>
people get it right away, but others need to internalize just how bad <br/>
school is before they can UNschool.  <br/>
<br/>
To say that this list won&#39;t be willing to talk about how terrible <br/>
schools are and discuss all the things we need to do politically to <br/>
take the power away from them is fine.  The list owners have the <br/>
right to make their list whatever they want and after this, I&#39;ll let <br/>
it go.  But if they are unwilling to discuss it, this list isn&#39;t <br/>
really for all those considering unschooling, it&#39;s for those who have <br/>
already come to terms with the terribleness of school and the <br/>
rightness of unschooling and are ready to discuss day to day.  And <br/>
sometimes you won&#39;t be able to allow things to flow naturally and <br/>
there will be holes in the conversation because we&#39;d be cutting some <br/>
of the (political, school bashing) stuff out.  <br/>

&gt;Maybe that&#39;s what I&#39;m not getting.  It is possible to focus on only<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For people who are still struggling with this, talking about it can be a <br/>
good thing.  I think most people here would agree that it&#39;s on topic *in <br/>
that case*.  The person doing the most talking about it is long past that <br/>
struggle.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To say that this list won&#39;t be willing to talk about how terrible<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure you quite understand what people are objecting to in terms of <br/>
the school-bashing and political stuff.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with posting <br/>
about how bad school was for either you or your kids if it&#39;s still <br/>
affecting you.  There&#39;s also nothing wrong with posting about political <br/>
things that are happening *right now* to you or in your area.  You might <br/>
get some pointers to information that&#39;s available elsewhere, but you&#39;ll <br/>
probably also get a fair amount of sympathy and support here.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s causing the problem is the generalized, schools and *everyone* <br/>
connected with them are evil and corrupt, etc. If someone starts talking <br/>
like that, and no one else disagrees, it&#39;s just going to look to new people <br/>
like unschoolers don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about.  (I&#39;m sure just <br/>
about every one of us knows at least one person connected with the schools <br/>
who is a caring person, trying to do what they can for kids within a system <br/>
that doesn&#39;t work very well.)<br/>
