shop.  This would  all be great for the kids too!  Anyway,  this is my little <br/>

I cried when I read this.  I was a foster mom for several years and adopted<br/>
several of our foster kids.  I also worked for years with teens at a mental<br/>
health clinic.  I always had a special place in my heart for the kids that<br/>
were willing to fight back against real and perceived wrongs, that still<br/>
viewed themselves as something worth protecting.<br/>
