We&#39;re a Catholic unschooling family.  Well, we&#39;re beginning unschoolers <br/>
anyway.  There&#39;s an egroup list for Catholic unschoolers, appropriately <br/>
called CatholicUnschoolers.  E-mail me if you&#39;d like to chat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460810179">Hi Renee-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re practicing Catholics and unschool and none of my kids go to CCD <br/>
(religious ed.)  We have 7 children...aged 13 down to 6 mos.  <br/>
We use all kind of resources to teach our kids the Faith in our home.  We <br/>
read lots of stories and the gospels-we go to Mass together.  But, I think <br/>
the kids are especially open to the rich traditions that the church offers, <br/>
so we try to implement as many of those as we can in our home...like <br/>
celebrating feast days, lighting candles, singing songs at home.  I&#39;ve always <br/>
liked that about the Catholic Faith-that there are so many &quot;tangible, <br/>
hands-on&quot; ways to celebrate what we believe.<br/>
And really, those skeptical kids are the fun ones...they really cause you to <br/>
have to stop and think about what you believe!<br/>
If you need some catalog resources, let me know. <br/>
You can e-mail me privately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277070588">Hi Carol,<br/>
It&#39;s nice to know that there are other Catholics on the list.  Both my <br/>
husband and I are relatively recent converts to the Faith (5 years).  I&#39;d <br/>
love to hear about some of the things you do (traditions etc...) with your <br/>
children to help them learn the Faith.  I&#39;m not sure if this is a topic <br/>
others would enjoy reading about, so if you&#39;ve got time maybe you could <br/>
e-mail me privately.  Oh, yeah!  To subscribe to the Catholic unschooling <br/>
list, just go to egroups and look for the list called CatholicUnschoolers.  I <br/>
think they&#39;ll walk you through the sign up process.  Take care.<br/>

I will write to you privately...thanks for the info.  Might be a while before <br/>
you hear from me, though...we&#39;re up to our ears in 4-H projects and swimming <br/>
lessons!<br/>
