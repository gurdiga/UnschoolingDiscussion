&lt;&lt; I think the new American Girls series of books, featuring &quot;Kit&quot;, is set<br/>
in the Thirties.  Do you think they would be too simplistic and cutesy<br/>
for Holly? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No!  I think it would be great. <br/>
I&#39;ve read her Josefina Montoya books, because it&#39;s local to us (thirty five <br/>
miles north of here is where they set it).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get one of those and see what she thinks.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Have you done Paper Moon?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  She LOVES that.  And she loves that she got a Simpsons scene entirely, <br/>
every nuance, because of knowing that movie well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Did you know that there was a campaign in California to get everyone to<br/>
read The Grapes of Wrath on the same day this year?  You two visited CA,<br/>
but you may have missed the day... &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s interesting!<br/>
I used to love that book when I was young and angstful.<br/>
