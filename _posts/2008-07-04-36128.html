<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429701270">My son Jeffrey will be 12 years old in a couple of weeks.  He is my <br/>
child with Aspergers Syndrome that I have talked about in some other <br/>
posts.  My DH used to be so on board with unschooling but started <br/>
changing his mind when he realized how narrowly focused Jeffrey can <br/>
be.  My DH isn&#39;t interested in schooling our son, but he does want <br/>
to find a way to help our son explore the world around him.  Jeffrey <br/>
can be challenging sometimes because of the things he doesn&#39;t like.  <br/>
He doesn&#39;t like going outside (bugs and weather), swimming (hates <br/>
water in or near his face), museums, fiction, and traveling away <br/>
from home, just to name a few.  When we do get him to agree on going <br/>
somewhere, he withdraws and is with us only physically.  He trails <br/>
along and continually asks, &#39;how much longer until we go home.&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
My DH and I definitely agree that putting our son in a school would <br/>
be harmful.  That&#39;s not an issue.  But my DH has gotten frustrated <br/>
because strewing doesn&#39;t work with Jeffrey.  He is completely <br/>
indifferent when it comes to something he hasn&#39;t specifically sought <br/>
out on his own.  That&#39;s why my DH suggested we pull some academics <br/>
in to our day.  He likes to see Jeffrey &quot;learning&quot; by discussing <br/>
math concepts and reading books aloud and discussing them.  Jeffrey <br/>
is thoughtful and insightful when discussing things, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
take the interests further.  He wants to go back to playing his <br/>
video games.  I still say he&#39;s young enough that his main interest <br/>
in video games is completely normal.  <br/>

Does your husband play the games your son likes?  That might be a  <br/>
good thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
How about movies?  Will he watch movies with you?  DVD nights  <br/>
together maybe?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems clear that he really isn&#39;t ready to go out.  I have found that whenever I think it&#39;s a <br/>
good idea to do something that my daughter hasn&#39;t agreed to at least try, it just isn&#39;t a <br/>
good thing.  It&#39;s like she needs to muster the inner resources to do whatever <br/>
task/adventure is at hand, and if she hasn&#39;t chosen to do it then she doesn&#39;t shift into a <br/>
place within herself to open to the experience.  Therefore, she gets nothing (or little) from <br/>
it.  It becomes a very two-dimensional experience, with the main focus on when we are <br/>
going home.<br/>
<br/>
He may just need more cocooning time.  My son (just 13) wanted to go out very little <br/>
during his 12 year old year.  He has been very involved in computer activities.  He plays <br/>
WOW and is also very into Roblox (which your son might like if he hasn&#39;t discovered it <br/>
already).  But things seem to be changing.  They changed on his 13th birthday <br/>
(yesterday!).  He had a long talk with me and told me what some of the changes he&#39;s <br/>
decided to make are.  Some of them have to do with how he seems himself and interacts <br/>
with others, and I had already noticed that change when he decided to tell me about it, so I <br/>
know he&#39;s pretty serious.  It actually reminded me of how he decided to potty train.  Right <br/>
after his 3rd birthday he announced that he&#39;d no longer wear diapers.  There was no lead <br/>
in--no consistently dry ones at night or using the potty during the day--he annouced it <br/>
and did it.<br/>
<br/>
The point I was trying to make is that he might still be percolating inside and not be ready <br/>
to show the world yet.  But trying to force him doesn&#39;t seem like the way to go.  Through <br/>
the intensity of his interest in video games, he will likely find himself.  It can challenge us <br/>
to see our children be so narrowly focused in a &quot;well-rounded&quot; world, but when you <br/>
concentrate the beam of a Magnalite flashlight, it has so much more power than when it is <br/>
diffused.  I would keep providing him with a good variety of games, and see if you can <br/>
branch out through the games he likes into websites and chat rooms about the games, or <br/>
movies with similar characters--think Tomb Raider (great flick!), stuff like that.  Field trips <br/>
to the video store.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could sit and make a list of all the academic subjects that are covered through the <br/>
different video games he&#39;s playing.  Aside from being filled with mathematical concepts <br/>
like complex puzzle solving, many of them have great stories, as well as beautiful artwork <br/>
and good music.  My kids have been excited to hear the classical pieces that are in their <br/>
video games.  Maybe instead of &quot;pulling in&quot; you could think of &quot;branching out&quot; from where <br/>
his interests already are.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter had similar tendencies at 12 and she&#39;s no where near the  <br/>
autistic spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
Prepuberty can be a very odd time for some kids. They&#39;re caught  <br/>
between child interests and adult interests and for some very little  <br/>
seems interesting which is supremely frustrating. Between 10 and 12  <br/>
she watched lots of TV and played lots of video games.<br/>
<br/>
Probably at 12 she showed glimmers of moving past, but boys develop a  <br/>
year later. At 13 I do remember her taste chemistry had finally  <br/>
changed and she could eat beyond a very narrow range and she was  <br/>
definitely drawing and writing again.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He likes to see Jeffrey &quot;learning&quot; by discussing<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In that transition period I don&#39;t think she was even taking art  <br/>
classes which she had always enjoyed. But at 14 she took one of my  <br/>
husband&#39;s math classes. She also finally moved into her own room ;-)  <br/>
And though she&#39;d had problems staying over night at other&#39;s houses 6  <br/>
months later she was at an intense car design camp halfway across the  <br/>
country for 2 weeks without a bit of homesickness. (She also  <br/>
discovered that though she enjoyed it she definitely didn&#39;t want a  <br/>
college that is that intense. She wants time to have fun ;-) And then  <br/>
she flew back to Boston all by herself (my husband had driven her out).<br/>
<br/>
At 15 she discovered guitar and threw herself into it. Along with  <br/>
more art. At 16 she discovered social needs which got added into the  <br/>
mix and spends several hours on the phone and IMs and interacts on  <br/>
Deviantart and Facebook. She knew of those things before but it was  <br/>
like &quot;Why?&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
She just would not have been interested in &quot;intellectual&quot; stuff at  <br/>
12. But by 14 she was moving that direction. Now at 16 we can have  <br/>
discussions about movies and books and music that are deep and  <br/>
insightful. The changes between 12 and 16 were huge for her and there  <br/>
was little indication in her 12 yo self of who she&#39;d be at 16.<br/>
<br/>
And the year she began moving towards more expansive adult-like  <br/>
thinking coincides with high school. I think educators at least got  <br/>
that part right ;-) 14 can be the age of thinking that&#39;s expanding as  <br/>
well as focusing more intensely on what interests them. (I&#39;m  <br/>
wondering if boys are still not at that stage at 14. Physically they  <br/>
still look like middle schoolers.) It&#39;s why they don&#39;t have high  <br/>
school for 12 yos. In fact lots of educators admit that middle school  <br/>
is just a holding pen. They really can&#39;t achieve much with them at  <br/>
that age. They just keep them contained until they can pass them off  <br/>
to high school ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So I think your husband is seeing a slide into deeper Aspergers when  <br/>
he&#39;s really seeing a child in prepuberty.  The symptoms may be more  <br/>
intense for your son but the effects are the same.<br/>

like Mario Kart, or Super Mario.  Jeffrey has lost interest in those <br/>
types of games.  He plays more mature games like Grand Theft Auto, <br/>
Mercenaries, Battlefield Bad Boys, and Call of Duty.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How about movies?  Will he watch movies with you?  DVD nights  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we are Netflix members which has been great.  We&#39;ve had a lot of <br/>
fun sharing old favorites with the kids.  The only movies Jeffrey has <br/>
really refused to watch are musicals of any type.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So maybe this is a natural thing for Jeffrey to be feeling?  I had <br/>
someone else suggest that puberty can be playing a large role in our <br/>
son&#39;s life.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The point I was trying to make is that he might still be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is what I&#39;d like to help my DH understand.  I think some <br/>
individuals like a nudge now and then, but Jeffrey has always been <br/>
the kind of person to choose his own timing.  I&#39;m reminded of when <br/>
he wanted to try TaeKwonDo.  A kid in his Kindergarten class brought <br/>
in a TKD belt for show and tell and it impressed Jeffrey.  We went <br/>
to a TKD place to observe classes.  My youngest daughter Allison is <br/>
20 months younger than Jeffrey.  She is an impulsive person, like <br/>
me, and signed up on the spot.  Jeffrey watched her classes for 6 <br/>
months before he asked to join.  I think my DH is having a hard time <br/>
letting our son take the lead on things because he&#39;s getting close <br/>
to high school age.  It&#39;s that old schoolish mentality again, isn&#39;t <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would keep providing him with a good variety of games,...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I think that&#39;s a great idea.  In fact, Jeffrey wants his <br/>
birthday centered on Game Stop.  Jeffrey doesn&#39;t like opening <br/>
presents because he doesn&#39;t like surprises.  Instead, we take him <br/>
shopping for his birthday gifts.  The past several birthdays have <br/>
been spent at the Lego Store.  This year he wants to go to Game <br/>
Stop.  He&#39;s so excited!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You could sit and make a list of all the academic subjects that<br/>
&gt; are covered through the different video games he&#39;s playing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true!  And he likes stuff about war like Call of Duty.  He&#39;s <br/>
picked up history from playing those games.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe instead of &quot;pulling in&quot; you could think of &quot;branching out&quot;<br/>
&gt; from where his interests already are.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great idea.  I should learn more about the games so I can share some <br/>
suggestions with Jeffrey.  He reads about games in magazines and <br/>
online so he chooses his own games and knows an incredible amount <br/>
about them, but I don&#39;t much about them at all.  I need to take more <br/>
of an active interest in his passion.  Perhaps even if my DH <br/>
can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; it, my DH will feel better knowing I am involved in our <br/>
son&#39;s interests and learning.  <br/>
<br/>
That resonates within me actually.  My DH has always trusted my <br/>
instinct in homeschooling decisions.  He tells me he happily shares <br/>
with coworkers that our homeschooling is going so well because I am <br/>
so passionate about our children.  No wonder my DH is worried <br/>
lately.  Jeffrey spends so much time in his room alone with his <br/>
video games.  I need to get in there and be with him.  I bet he&#39;ll <br/>
be so excited to show me how to play those games. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of seeing the &quot;well roundedness&quot; by &quot;schoolyear,&quot; look at it  <br/>
by five or ten year blocks.  It IS hard, but that&#39;s how unschooling  <br/>
works.  You don&#39;t get &quot;good samples&quot; at any one point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The advice about letting kids move out and away when they want to,  <br/>
and how they want to, is important.  It&#39;s the basis of attachment  <br/>
parenting.  If you don&#39;t leave toddlers in daycare, and you let them  <br/>
sit by you or on you or hold your hand when they want to, then when  <br/>
they DO move away a little, you know for sure that they wanted to,  <br/>
that they felt confident about it.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was 12 he wanted to be by himself.  I remember thinking he  <br/>
was being cruel to Marty and Holly by wanting them away from him all  <br/>
the time, and I was blaming it on our having moved (just a few miles,  <br/>
but he didn&#39;t want to move).  But I thought later it was just his age  <br/>
and his need to have more time alone as he was going through those  <br/>
physical changes.<br/>
<br/>
The next year he started spending time at a gaming shop up the road  <br/>
(good thing we moved! &lt;g&gt;) and when he was 14 they hired him, because  <br/>
they had seen him a lot and gotten to know him, he had been helpful  <br/>
lots of times, and was good at helping other people understand  <br/>
games.  Probably part of that was  the private analysis he had been  <br/>
doing of games he was playing alone, by choice.<br/>
<br/>
He grew up to have a game-related job.  Lots of my kids&#39; friends have  <br/>
jobs like that, that either involve games, or computers, or cellphone  <br/>
tech support or customer service.  Those aren&#39;t games that even  <br/>
existed when I was growing up.  Too many parents are preparing their  <br/>
kids for the 1980&#39;s (or earlier).  With younger kids, you can&#39;t even  <br/>
prepare your child for a 2010 job.  They&#39;ll have 2020 jobs you  <br/>
couldn&#39;t imagine yet.<br/>

his &#39;thinking&#39; is going astray from our previous beliefs in <br/>
unschooling.  Jeffrey is who he is today and will be who he is when <br/>
he&#39;s 16.  We don&#39;t need to do anything specific to prepare him for <br/>
the future.  I need to talk to my DH and see I&#39;m understanding him <br/>
correctly.  I know my DH thinks a high school diploma is really <br/>
important.  That&#39;s probably influencing his thoughts tremendously.<br/>
