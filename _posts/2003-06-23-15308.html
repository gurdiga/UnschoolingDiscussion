exercise, then she&#39;ll come and whine the whole time.  So i stop <br/>
asking cause it gets old really quick.<br/>
I also know she is grieving Sam, and is also in the midst of puberty <br/>
and that doesn&#39;t help the situation.  But she has always had a sweet <br/>
tooth and tends to like to fill up on that stuff.<br/>
I feel I should be helping her, but I don&#39;t know how.<br/>
Any suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917103266">Grief and hormones and genetics all working on your little girl sounds<br/>
rough.  <br/>
<br/>
If you were to just focus on things she really loves to do and things<br/>
she&#39;s good at, I wonder if that would improve her self image?   Maybe<br/>
she&#39;s forgotten some good things about herself, some talents and passions<br/>
and you can help her find those again.   After my dad died, it took me<br/>
awhile to remember there were paints in the cupboard and flowers in the<br/>
garden and art galleries to visit and ponds full of ducks.   <br/>
<br/>
If she becomes naturally happier with herself and her accomplishments her<br/>
self image maybe won&#39;t be based on how she fits into a bathing suit.   I<br/>
don&#39;t know, Joanna.   If she finds things about herself to really like<br/>
and be happy with, the rest might fall into place naturally.<br/>
<br/>
If you go for walks and bike rides and talk about what you saw and what a<br/>
nice time you had, she may be encouraged to go along with you sometimes. <br/>
Do you live where you can hike and explore?   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get some good ideas, and I&#39;ll keep thinking about it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424631272">I highly recommend that BOTH you and your dd read &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot;.<br/>
It may help you both to understand society, the parent-female teen<br/>
relationship, and teen experience more--- as well as get past so much of<br/>
the garbage our culture places on our young girls.<br/>
