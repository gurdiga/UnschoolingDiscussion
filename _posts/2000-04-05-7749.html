<div id="ygrps-yiv-24374769">Welcome Bernadette, Try anything by John Holt for<br/>
unschooling and I read everything my library had on<br/>
homeschooling but I bought and enjoyed was &quot;The<br/>
Ultimate Guide To Homeschooling&quot; By Debra Bell <br/>
Good Luck in your quest!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926679386">Hi everyone,<br/>
I too am (pretty) new to this list. My name is Brooke and I am a single (by<br/>
choice) mother to four gorgeous kids all of whom are unschooled. My eldest<br/>
is Ashley 10yog, Dane 7yob, Paige 5yog and paloma Grace 2yog.<br/>
We have never schooled-at-home but we have home-schooled and are now very<br/>
happily unschooling!<br/>
I read and read and read about unschooling. I live in New Zealand and the<br/>
information here does take a bit of digging to locate but some of the<br/>
greatest books I have read apart from John Holt and John Taylor Gatto (of<br/>
course!!!) have been &quot;Taking The Joy Out Of Egypt&quot; and &quot;And The Skylark<br/>
sings With Me&quot; I do have to add the proviso however that after reading both<br/>
books I did look at my kids a bit slit-eyed wondering why none of them<br/>
showed any desire to study architecture or make their own telescopes!! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I have realised of course that all kids are gifted and special in their own<br/>
ways and my kids will discover their particular passions when they are ready<br/>
(but still, I am only human and seriously considered &quot;casually&quot; leaving<br/>
books on physics scattered about!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Better than books though (which do sometimes seem to be a bit daunting!!<br/>
especially if your kid would rather make planes out of books than study<br/>
them!!) are these message boards! I find that joining these boards has given<br/>
me inspiration, encouragement, resource ideas as well as the priceless<br/>
knowledge that I am not alone in my trials, tribulations and joys.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble,<br/>
Brooke (enjoying the kids being outside!!!!)<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Brooke</div>
