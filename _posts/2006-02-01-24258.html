<div id="ygrps-yiv-419743471">I&#39;ve been a lurker on this site for months. I need some advice on getting my<br/>
family on the same page.<br/>
I am a (so far!) an unschooling family of a 5 yr old daughter, 3 yr old and<br/>
20 month old sons in central Texas.<br/>
His family is very educated (parents are retired professors, lawyer/doctor<br/>
sisters,etc.) so they are very PRO public schools.<br/>
My husband is a sweet loving kind of guy and we have always &quot;talked&quot; about<br/>
homeschooling. He has never really researched or done much in the way of<br/>
their education (besides reading to his 3 kids).  Now family members are<br/>
putting pressure on him to put our daughter in public school. He is getting<br/>
cold feet and wonders if I can do it all &quot;by myself with 3 kids&quot;. We have no<br/>
set schedule and he is worried that we (I?) would do them a disservice by<br/>
staying home.  We have never had disagreements about this and guess it stems<br/>
from my daughter&#39;s ability to start p/s this coming Fall &#39;06. He feels we<br/>
are running out of &quot;time&quot; - that we have to &quot;shape up&quot; or send her to public<br/>
school.<br/>
Do y&#39;all have any advice on this? I hope to show him that we can do it with<br/>
3 kids under 6.<br/>
Help!<br/>

One good tool when starting out is to say &quot;We&#39;re going to try it this  <br/>
year and see how it goes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It gives the relatives hope that you&#39;ll fail.  With that hope,  <br/>
they&#39;ll leave you alone for a year.  If it&#39;s going well, you can say  <br/>
&quot;One more year, if it&#39;s working.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
it can also help to give your relatives something to read and say  <br/>
&quot;After you read this, we could talk about it.&quot;  If they read it it  <br/>
will probably help. If they don&#39;t read it, you don&#39;t have to talk  <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases it might be worth saying &quot;Some families move 2000 miles  <br/>
away to raise their kids without interference, but I really wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
want to do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things here:<br/>

could be easier than that ;-)<br/>
I don&#39;t have any advice, but just wanted to let you know that it can  <br/>
work, and it&#39;s beautiful. Our kids were in ps for five years and it  <br/>
was a nightmare.<br/>
They really don&#39;t learn all that much at ps that they couldn&#39;t learn  <br/>
at home, except how to be mean, exclusive and that they hate to  <br/>
learn. HTH<br/>

That is invaluable advice, as I am in a similar situation as Debi (my <br/>
boys are 6 and 4).  Husband is not really supportive and my Mother <br/>
has just simply been terrorizing me over the decision not to send the <br/>
kids to school.<br/>
<br/>
After the most recent shouting match with my Mom, I told her that I <br/>
am not holding any more conversations on the subject until she reads <br/>
up on unschooling.  Suprisingly, she agreed.  Yesterday I spent over <br/>
an hour looking for unschooling books in Russian and when I was about <br/>
to give up, I found that &quot;Happy Child&quot; by Steven Harrison has been <br/>
translated into Russian.  I am ordering it today.  I am delighted.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the husband, still working on him to read up on the <br/>
subject.  So far, that has not been successful.  I am actively <br/>
promoting a local unschooling group in order to get more support and <br/>
to get him to meet families who have older children who all have been <br/>
unschooled.  And last, DH is going to take Landmark Forum at the end <br/>
of February and I hope that will help me to have better <br/>
communications on the subject.<br/>

<br/>
This has been helpful not only for my dh but for me over the years.  Connecting with families with older children is great. Now I am the older more experienced unschooling family inspiring younger ones &lt;g&gt;.  It is amazing to be a part of the lives of older teens who are now off in the world.  If you are able to i would also strongly recommend attending an unschooling conference, either the Northeast in May this year or the Live and Learn conference in New Mexico in September.  After my dh attended his first Live and Learn conference he came home total on board.  He still occasionally slips up with questions like &quot;are you working on math or reading?&quot; but it&#39;s not an on going conflict.  And my younger dd calls him on his slips...&quot;i thought you said you were turning over a new leaf dad?&quot;<br/>
