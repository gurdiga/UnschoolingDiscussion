<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess that this feeling comes from years of doing what was expected<br/>
&gt; of me (external motivation). Now I am free to do what I want and I am<br/>
&gt; lost (no internal motivation). I am hoping that I just need to<br/>
&gt; deschool myself longer (20 years equals almost 2 years so...do you<br/>
&gt; deschool work years too??)&lt;g&gt; I need to find out who I am and what I<br/>
&gt; want to do along side my children. (14.10,7)  I tend to gravitate to<br/>
&gt; somewhat schooly things (reading, naming, lists, attempts at<br/>
&gt; organizing). I was drawn to WTM because I thought it would be neat to<br/>
&gt; trek in an orderly fashion through time and do lots of history and lit<br/>
&gt; stuff that I missed in school.  We have dumped any such plan<br/>
&gt; (regardless of how relaxed our version was). The kids certainly have a<br/>
&gt; better idea of what they want to do. Maybe I should just do it for me?<br/>
&gt; But this seems too schooly? I don&#39;t feel like I have an artsy,<br/>
&gt; spontaneous bone in my body. Has anyone struggled with this and can<br/>
&gt; recommend some reading/activities that may have helped you<br/>
&gt; reawaken/rediscover your passions?  Very sad that I am still looking<br/>
&gt; for someone to &quot;tell me what to do&quot;  Yikes!!!<br/>

&gt; PS I have been enjoying lots of the unschool movies and book favorites<br/>
&gt; that Sandra and others recommend.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Beth, it&#39;s probably not that bad. So breathe :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to recommend a book I have before: Wishcraft, by Barbara Sher. If <br/>
yoiu were here, I&#39;d lend you one of my copies...I try to keep several on <br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
Think about what is fun for you, or excites you. What did you think you&#39;d be <br/>
when you grew up, when you weren&#39;t listening to other people&#39;s ideas? If you <br/>
had another life to live, not being an unschooling mom, what would you be? <br/>
What if you had five lives to live? You don&#39;t have to be artsy, or even <br/>
spontaneous...maybe that&#39;s just not you.<br/>
<br/>
Get the book and read it. It really will help!<br/>
