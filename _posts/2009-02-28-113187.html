<div id="ygrps-yiv-586010602">A while ago I compiled some strategies unschoolers had come up with  <br/>
to handle brushing teeth. I posted them and finally found time to  <br/>
format the page for the website:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Originally I figured it would be a list of little things, like not  <br/>
using toothpaste. But it turned into little windows peering in on  <br/>
unschoolers finding ways to help children respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
And I also compiled and put up a page on Transitions: helping kids  <br/>
move from one activity to another. (There will be more at some point,  <br/>
but time is the huge factor!)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any more strategies, please pass them on and I&#39;ll add  <br/>
them :-)<br/>
