<br/>
I am Chad, father to Taylor, a 7 yr old. I am the full time dad and<br/>
homeschooler, and I am enjoying it very much!<br/>

&gt;     Hi!  I&#39;m Kyle and my wife is Paula.  We have two children, Steven 13<br/>
&gt; and Kayla 9.  We have been homeschooling now for six yrs. or I guess I<br/>
&gt; should say conducting school at home.  We just started unschooling about<br/>
&gt; three weeks ago. I have made feeble attempts at it in the past but  have<br/>
&gt; had a hard time turning over the reigns of control.  Ok, Ok, I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; struggling with that one but am learning to trust my children more<br/>
&gt; everyday.  I&#39;ve read all of John Holts books subscribe to GWS and HEM<br/>
&gt; and believe in the homeschooling or natural learning philosophy with al<br/>
&gt; of my being, but believing and doing are to totally different things.<br/>
&gt; So here we are now trying to put legs to our beliefs.<br/>
&gt;     Being the primary domestic engineer for the past six years I would<br/>
&gt; love to here from any other homedads if there are any of you out there.<br/>

&gt;  I know exactly what you are saying about being able to change.  I want to be<br/>
&gt; able to trust the kids,too, but it is very difficult.  It is as if we, the<br/>
&gt; ex-teachers , need the de-schooling.  All the yrs as children in schools,<br/>
&gt; then college, then teaching in the schools adds up to alot to shut out of a<br/>
&gt; person&#39;s mind, no matter how much other philophies make sense.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dear Karen --<br/>
<br/>
I might have mentioned it already, but I am trying to gather material for a book<br/>
about public school teachers (or employees) who decide to homeschool their own<br/>
children.  If you are still teaching, how do your colleagues react?  Why did you<br/>
decide to do it? What out of your teaching training/experience turned out to be<br/>
useful, and what useless? How&#39;s it going? other reflections?  (and then the<br/>
usual, where are you, how many kids, what age, what did you teach, etc.)<br/>
500-2000 words will be fine, and don&#39;t worry too much about editing -- that&#39;s my<br/>
job!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll send something!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I have read<br/>
&gt; Holt, and agree with most everything I have read.  He,too, was a teacher;<br/>
&gt; however, I don&#39;t think he was a parent.  My point is that living with<br/>
&gt; children 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, is different than being with them for<br/>
&gt; prescribed hours each day.  When I taught, I was not a parent.  When I became<br/>
&gt; a parent, my ideas about educ. did change radically.  I cannot fathom putting<br/>
&gt; my kids in school, and I know homeschooling is definitely the best for<br/>
&gt; children, but I, too, find what works for me- at least for now- is a blending<br/>
&gt; of sorts.  I encourage  and offer ideas, and at times I fight the frustration<br/>
&gt; of having ideas rejected, and the &quot;teacher&quot; in me wants to rear up and &quot;take<br/>
&gt; charge&quot;.  This is why I am researching other ideas like  C Mason , and Samuel<br/>
&gt; Blumenfeld.  I don&#39;t know how much of it I may use, but I am open to learning<br/>
&gt; as much as I can about it all.  What each family ultimately feels most<br/>
&gt; comfortable  with in the long run, is what will matter most, and that&#39;s what<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to keep in mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830816306">Sure!  We are far from deciding what to include and what not to, and that<br/>
decision will be based on the quality of the material.  So send it along.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445003837">Hi Kyle,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a home business.  I retired early when we decided to start<br/>
a family: our biological son, Taylor who is now seven.  A couple of<br/>
years ago, we adopted two Russian girls, now 10 and 14.<br/>
<br/>
I home schooled them for a year, and they are now in public school<br/>
getting a dose of Americana. <br/>
<br/>
Home schooling Taylor, &quot;after school home schooling&quot; the girls, keeping<br/>
up with our home, dealing with a rental property, keeps me plenty busy. <br/>
And with my wife&#39;s good income, we survive.  <br/>
<br/>
Look forward to hearing more from you,<br/>
<br/>
Chad  <br/>
