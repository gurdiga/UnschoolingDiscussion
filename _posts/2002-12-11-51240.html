&lt;&lt;  And if the child is saying that he can&#39;t go <br/>
 to sleep without mom laying with him first, that mom says, &quot;If you <br/>
 want me to lay with you, it has to be by 11 pm because after that <br/>
 point I&#39;ll be too tired.  Because one child might want to be up until <br/>
 2 am but another child might want mom to get up at 7 am.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that isn&#39;t setting arbitrary limits. That&#39;s telling them honestly what <br/>
your needs are.<br/>
If you&#39;re tired, no one is suggesting ignoring your body to do only what <br/>
other people want!<br/>
But arbitrary limits and bodily needs are two different things.<br/>
I tell my children when I&#39;m going to bed and if they want me to lay down and <br/>
tuck them in, that&#39;s the time they need to come, or I&#39;ll fall asleep and <br/>
they&#39;re on their own.<br/>
And I ask Trevor to shut down the tv long enough for me to get the baby and <br/>
Sierra through the bedtime ritual if they&#39;re getting tired (or me). They need <br/>
a quiet calm house to help them settle in.<br/>
After they are tucked in then Trevor and Jared can do as they wish (although <br/>
Jared usually comes when I tuck babsy boy in, as he likes to cuddle too).<br/>
Last night I was a Grinch and sent everyone to their rooms so the main part <br/>
of the house would be quiet.<br/>
We had a hectic morning coming up, and I needed to have some prep <br/>
time.....none of them were told to go to sleep, just be in their rooms quiet. <br/>
I went to cuddle with them and they were all asleep!! Even Trevor.<br/>
I guess Gameboy just wasn&#39;t captivating enough! Funny how those kids with all <br/>
the options will just fall asleep when they could be doing something else! lol<br/>
