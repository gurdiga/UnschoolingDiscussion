<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717428384">I&#39;ve been attending our UU Fellowship for months now, and it&#39;s now my turn to <br/>
give a talk during the service.  As my journey into unschooling has changed <br/>
our family, so has the *unchurching* of my spirituality enriched us.  So, I&#39;m <br/>
asking my fellow UUUs (and the rest of yous too :)) to help me out in <br/>
introducing these folks to the world of joyful learning in the context of the UU <br/>
principles ~ which I read today and will modify to say *family* instead of <br/>
*fellowship* and show their logical application to family.  I have a great book about <br/>
the founding mothers of the UU movement in the Midwest (can&#39;t find it in all <br/>
the chaos at the moment &lt;bg&gt;), I&#39;m looking for some supportive stuff there (as <br/>
one of the first ministers in Sioux City, IA was, herself, homeschooled).  I <br/>
thought some John Holt quotes would be good ~ and maybe permission to use some <br/>
Sandra Dodd ???  I&#39;ve got until mid-August to get my thoughts straight :)  <br/>
Thanks in advance!  <br/>
