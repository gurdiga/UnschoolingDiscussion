&gt; Actually, Native Americans do not have a separate word for &quot;religion&quot; or <br/>
&gt; for &quot;art&quot;. It is all a part of life......as it should be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Marla, you are absolutely right! It is a way of life and the way it should <br/>
be, but people.........I don&#39;t know.<br/>
I only said that because that&#39;s what people nowadays associate with...<br/>
Me being part native, I am trying to get back to that way of life... My <br/>
native ancerstors are calling me and have been for YEARS. Out of fear I <br/>
rejected them. Because of what certain religions say about things like that I <br/>
rejected them...... I will not do that anymore and perhaps that is why it is <br/>
a daily battle and struggle for me. To break those chains from around mind!<br/>
That way of life is so simple......Just plain simple....<br/>
<br/>
I am on a mission to free myself.........free my mind and get out of debt and <br/>
become debt free.<br/>
Free of society&#39;s materialistic ways and thoughts. Even though I have learn <br/>
that lesson a while back.....you slip back now and then.<br/>
I have now say hey.....why can&#39;t I make my own furniture....... I was tired <br/>
of constantly buying because stuff just don&#39;t last. Which of course it does <br/>
cause they want you to spend , spend, spend!<br/>
I got tired of the chairs from the store breaking over time......so we made a <br/>
bench that has a back to it and storage. I covered it with fabric and <br/>
cushions.<br/>
We just made another plain bench. The top piece is a 2x12x8 and that piece of <br/>
wood was only $8.52 and then we cut 2x4&#39;s and turned them into 4x4&#39;s and I <br/>
covered the seams with 1x3&#39;s. Then we took what 1x4 and made feet, and <br/>
rounded the edges.<br/>
I am going to either back a cushion or cover for that....<br/>
<br/>
I am learning to simplfy my life....It feels a little better, but I know it <br/>
will be alot better debt free.<br/>
It feels good not being apart of the rat race and consumerism.......<br/>
