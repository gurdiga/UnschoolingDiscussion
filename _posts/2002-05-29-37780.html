What&#39;d you think of the season ender?  That last thirty seconds made<br/>
me fall off my chair!**<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Bridget --<br/>
<br/>
I had read Buffy spoiler boards on the Television Without Pity website<br/>
every day for about six weeks leading up to the finale.  (That&#39;s<br/>
obsession!)  So I knew what was going to happen.  Which made for a<br/>
completely different viewing experience.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me offlist if you want to chat more, but be warned, I<br/>
know too much!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen recaps of a pretty interesting interview with one of the Buffy<br/>
scriptwriters (Jane Espenson) who says the Spike&#39;s quest scenes were<br/>
intentionally misleading.  Their objective was to make people fall off<br/>
of their chairs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read a lot of speculation about what Spike&#39;s personality (and hair)<br/>
are going to be like next season.  Be warned, I can go for hours on the<br/>
whole Buffy and Spike topic, which has only a very tenuous connection to<br/>
unschooling.  So I&#39;ll stop here.  For. Now.<br/>
<br/>
