<div><font size="2">interestingly, our local commercial tv station ran a segment 
on a magazine show about a home-educating family, unschoolers though perhaps 
they would not like the label (I used to be on a list with the mother :-) which 
others have told me did a good job of showing &#39;a day in the life.&#39;&nbsp; The 
producers of that show wanted a &#39;round-the-table&#39; bit, but since they don&#39;t do 
that, they didn&#39;t do it.&nbsp; Don&#39;t know whether the show has a website or 
anything, but tv can sometimes do a good job of providing a taste of 
something.&nbsp; Unfortunately, what it also does, seeing as it is mostly used 
by advertisers to promote unaccesible beauty and the accumulation of things, is 
put what it portrays on pedestals.&nbsp; People see experts doing stuff, try to 
match it and fail, so give up and pay someone else.&nbsp; Cookery programmes are 
a case in point.&nbsp; There are more cookery shows showing more ways of cooking 
more different food, yet less and less people actually prepare food from 
scratch.&nbsp; Anyhow, I&#39;ll have to wait a while for that episode of Oprah to 
reach these shores :-)</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736519829">&quot;I believe we&#39;d all be better off if we left homeschooling off<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of television and educated people about it through other mediums.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Later, on page 324 he writes, &quot;When dealing with primitive peoples,<br/>
&gt; objective events such as hunting, building, fighting or dancing are<br/>
&gt; easier to convey through television than subjective details of<br/>
&gt; qualities of experience, ways of mind, alternative perceptions. The<br/>
&gt; latter qualities, which form the heart of life for primitive people,<br/>
&gt; are dropped out in favor of the former.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This applies to us, too. Whenever I see a story about homeschooling on<br/>
&gt; television, there are images of mom sitting around the table with the<br/>
&gt; kids, the kids getting their schoolbooks, mom asking the kids<br/>
&gt; questions. This would not encourage ME to homeschool my kids. But this<br/>
&gt; is what television people are looking for because this is ALL THEY CAN<br/>
&gt; SHOW. They don&#39;t know that unschooling isn&#39;t about what you can<br/>
&gt; necessarily see on paper. It&#39;s about development, growth, independence<br/>
&gt; and love of learning - none of which can be conveyed on television in<br/>
&gt; a 2 minute video segment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Havidha, I think I agree with your thoughtful post.  Even though I didn&#39;t<br/>
watch the show (dont have tv) I did go to the site and email the producers<br/>
with the idea of doing a show dedicated to natural learning or &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
But now I am beginging to think that you are right... we are better off to<br/>
pass on information about uschooling in other ways... that the potential for<br/>
people to get the complete wrong idea is almost unavoidable, and very<br/>
likeley such a show would end up causing more harm than good...<br/>
My next thought was that an indepth documentary would be more appropriate...<br/>
does any-one know of any??<br/>
