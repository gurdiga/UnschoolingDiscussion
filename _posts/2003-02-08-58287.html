 Maybe it depends on where you live. Since the Northwest has about 3 <br/>
 dependable months without rain, almost every race imaginable is <br/>
 squeezed into that timeframe - July through September, with August <br/>
 being the least rainy and therefore most popular.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

OH! See, I forget what the rest of the country lives in, I&#39;m so spoiled.<br/>
Tri-season here is mainly March through October, but there are runs and races <br/>
all year really.<br/>
FL is the capital of triathlon (as far as how many are held).<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
