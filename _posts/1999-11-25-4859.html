<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558457788">&quot;It&#39;s kind of funny, but when you are connected to so many home schoolers,<br/>
you forget that the world at large doesn&#39;t understand or approve.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read this and it struck a real sad note.  I guess that even with all the<br/>
problems we have with imported crime, for homeschooling/unschooling, we<br/>
live in a great area.  The local school districts even refer folks to the<br/>
local homeschooling group.  Where ever we go, youngest kidlet is forever<br/>
being asking about being in school or having a school holiday, since we are<br/>
out and about a lot.  She always informs them she is homeschooled and the<br/>
responses are always &quot;gee that&#39;s great,&quot; &quot;wish I had the patience,&quot; &quot;gee<br/>
you&#39;re a lucky little girl,&quot; and other comments along those lines.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been homeschooling since the late 60&#39;s and have never run up against<br/>
the prejudices, etc. that others seem to.  I sincerely wish all that have<br/>
had these negative experiences to have the positive ones that we always<br/>
have in their future!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lynda, it&#39;s a live and let live attitude about MOST things in that part of<br/>
the world!  That is precisely why most folks like to live there, or move<br/>
there, among other things.  I grew up in SF and spent a great deal of time<br/>
in the surrounding counties also.  It&#39;s a very open minded and accepting<br/>
place to live. (In general that is, I got my fair share of reverse<br/>
discrimination and violence too.)  The &quot;Hippie&quot; movement being centered in<br/>
N. Calif. went a great way towards making folks tolerant of alternative<br/>
lifestyles there I think.  It also doesn&#39;t hurt that there is such a huge<br/>
proportion of races and cultures gathered there besides middle-class white<br/>
American.<br/>

black listed.  I accidentally (and boy were their bloomers in a twist) got<br/>
a copy of their approved newspaper, tv and radio station list for CA a<br/>
couple of years ago.  And being the naughty Berkeley and Alcatraz alumni<br/>

About Learning: Conversations with My Violin&quot;.  It is about how when<br/>
learning anything, really, there are five internal conversations which<br/>
take place (and i use the violin as an example): with nature and the<br/>
physical world, with the past and history, with the present and the<br/>
social order and current custom, with the future, and with oneself (or<br/>
with the divine).  So yes, we use music this way, only more deeply,<br/>
because math, reading, and history doesn&#39;t cover the half of it.<br/>

Tell me more of how you use music.  My boys take keyboard and guitar,  we are <br/>
very involved in the music school, and I use their practice, theory, band and <br/>
lessons as part of our course of study. <br/>

<br/>
My book has no fewer than four chapters on our musical adventures (my<br/>
older one started playing the violin at 23 months, and is a composer,<br/>
and my younger one is a very gifted pianist) -- and I&#39;d be happy to<br/>
e-mail you some sample chapters offline.  But we don&#39;t use music as a<br/>
&quot;course of study&quot;.  Rather in the course of studying music (or anything<br/>
else for that matter), specific questions raise their head, in the five<br/>
&quot;conversations&quot; I spoke about in the last e-mail.  This learning process<br/>
is messy, and doesn&#39;t organize itself until the final conversation (the<br/>
conversation with oneself) -- so it is not so much a course of study, as<br/>
an orientation toward the world.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that we don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; music. The kids do -- we are just there<br/>
to facilitate the learning process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759949189">I have a violin that my great uncle made in about 1890 (I don&#39;t remember<br/>
the exact date).  This sits in a place of honor on top the ol&#39; player piano<br/>
we have.  It has lead the kidlets down many roads and they still all like<br/>
hearing about its origins, about how my great grandfather &quot;imported&quot; a<br/>
tutor who had trained in Europe and ordered a Strad knock off (one done by<br/>
a pupil of a pupil of Strad).  They follow its history (and our family<br/>
history) to present day because some of his violins, violas and cellos are<br/>
being played by folks in the Boston Pops and the Philharmonic.  Which leads<br/>
them to listening to classical music and then they take another turn to<br/>
Irish dancing and the trail goes on.  All because of one violin.<br/>
<br/>
Well, long winded, when what I meant to say was that it was so weird that<br/>
you should use a violin when that has lead the kidlets on so many learning<br/>
adventures.<br/>
