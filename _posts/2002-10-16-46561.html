unschooling. My only consolation is that,if they do something at my <br/>
request for a few minutes, then they are free otherwise. It is better <br/>
than hours of school and  homework but it still does not meet the <br/>
ultimate goal. We are new at the homeschool thing as this is our <br/>
second year.  I need help from those who unschool within the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475465326">I wonder if it would help to go through your state&#39;s specific<br/>
requirements with the kids - so that you are all involved in firstly:<br/>
the decision whether or not to comply with the legal requirements (and<br/>
thus accepting the potential for consequences which you might also like<br/>
to investigate) and secondly: deciding how to proceed with the first.<br/>
If you all want to comply (or appear to comply) with requirements, their<br/>
wording may give you some clues - can you tell us how those requirements<br/>
are phrased?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123866609">I don&#39;t register, but if someone came to ask me about what and how my kids <br/>
learned I could talk a blue streak and send them away with some required <br/>

Carol Narigon&#39;s older child has &quot;graduated&quot; (in that odd manner of speaking <br/>
when unschoolers &quot;graduate&quot;), but here is the format she used in Ohio.<br/>

CAROL NARIGON&#39;S UNSCHOOLING CURRICULUM<br/>
<br/>
In case an unschooler is required to submit a curriculum, here is one Carol <br/>
wrote, and has generously offered as a model for other families in need. <br/>
Brandon will use a developmentally-appropriate, integrated curriculum. We <br/>
will plan his learning together, based on his interests, so I can&#39;t state in <br/>
advance which specific topical areas we will cover, however we expect to <br/>
cover the following subjects.<br/>
He will read from self-chosen and parent-chosen literature on a daily basis. <br/>
He will engage in reflection on those literature pieces in one or many of the <br/>
following ways: journal writing, book reviews, conversations, drama based on <br/>
the books, book clubs. My goal is for Brandon to continue to enjoy reading, <br/>
to read for pleasure, to gain exposure to a wide variety of genres, and to be <br/>
able to reflect critically on what he reads. <br/>
Brandon will read content-area non-fiction materials as needed to support his <br/>
chosen areas of interest. He will reflect on these pieces in one, or many, of <br/>
the following ways: journal writing, writing an article for submission to a <br/>
magazine, discussions, development of a scrapbook in an area of interest. My <br/>
goal is for Brandon to learn to read critically for information, to <br/>
understand and be able to reflect on the materials he reads and to be able to <br/>
compare them to other sources of information, and to learn how and where to <br/>
find written resources as needed.<br/>
Brandon will study science as it relates to the areas of his interests by <br/>
watching science videos, reading related written materials, conducting <br/>
scientific experiments, gardening, keeping journals, making and recording <br/>
observations, visiting scientists in their work places, taking classes at the <br/>
Dayton Museum of Discovery, participating in science fairs, earning science <br/>
merit badges through Boy Scouts, visiting museums such as COSI and the <br/>
Indianapolis Childrenâ€™s Museum and through cooperative classes with our <br/>
homeschool group. My goal is for Brandon to experience a wide range of <br/>
scientific exposure in his areas of interest, to develop a positive interest <br/>
in science, to learn to think scientifically, to develop a respect for the <br/>
work scientists do and to understand the importance science has in his daily <br/>
life.<br/>
Writing, spelling and grammar will be covered as part of Brandon&#39;s writing <br/>
processes. He expects to write creatively, to write letters and lists, to <br/>
create and write drama pieces, etc. He will also write in conjunction with <br/>
Boy Scout merit badges. My goal is for Brandon to enjoy writing, to gain <br/>
skills in both the writing process and in technical skills required of an <br/>
edited piece, and to develop a sense of power over the written word.<br/>
History and geography will follow the same plan outlined for the above <br/>
subjects. Brandon will read historical fiction and non-fiction, participating <br/>
in field trips such as the Renaissance Festival, Carillon Park, Union Station <br/>
in Cincinnati and the Fair at New Boston. We expect to integrate history and <br/>
geography into our study of other subjects through one or many or the <br/>
following ways: the use of time lines and maps, discussion, journal writing, <br/>
cooking, plays, road trips, invention building, Scout camping trips and art. <br/>
My goal is for Brandon to appreciate the nuances and fluidity of history, to <br/>
recognize his place in history, and to enjoy and understand the importance of <br/>
his knowledge of history.<br/>
Health, physical education and safety will be continued as a part of our <br/>
daily living skills. Brandon will learn to care for his body and his physical <br/>
environment through one or many of the following ways: shopping for and <br/>
preparing food, discussing the necessity of a healthy diet, participation in <br/>
fire drills and other emergency preparedness, exercise both as play and as <br/>
part of a structured group experience, and through Boy Scout camping, merit <br/>
badges and classes. My goal is for Brandon to appreciate the necessity of a <br/>
healthy body and to learn to care for his body&#39;s needs as he understands them.<br/>
Brandon will learn art and music through both self-chosen and structured <br/>
methods including one, or many, of the following: art classes at Rosewood, <br/>
DAI, or the K-12 Gallery, piano and guitar lessons, choral singing, listening <br/>
to various styles of music, learning through reading and videos about the <br/>
people who have influenced music through history, and working on self-chosen <br/>
art projects and Boy Scout badges that relate to music and art. He has been <br/>
and will continue to be active as an actor and performer in various community <br/>
theaters in the Dayton area. My goal is for Brandon to appreciate a wide <br/>
variety of art and music experiences, including performance, while <br/>
understanding the importance of art and music as it pertains to history. In <br/>
addition, he will be spending time at our family framing and print store <br/>
where he will meet a variety of artists and learn about many facets of the <br/>
art business.<br/>
Brandon will learn math through participation in daily livingâ€”cooking, <br/>
building, shopping, etc. In addition, he will continue using the Key toâ€¦math <br/>
series for algebra and geometry as well as Mathematics a Human Endeavor and <br/>
Algebra by Harold Jacobs. My goal is for Brandon to gain conceptual knowledge <br/>
of mathematics as well as an appreciation for the daily application of math <br/>
in his life. <br/>
