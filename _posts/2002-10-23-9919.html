<div id="ygrps-yiv-467084383">&lt;Fundamentalist Christians who won a legal battle to<br/>
keep homosexual men from being leaders and if a child<br/>
is homosexual I guess he&#39;s out too (I don&#39;t know).&gt;<br/>
<br/>
yes, homosexual boys are not welcome according to the<br/>
official policy.  Of course, individual troops may be<br/>
in violation if they are welcoming.  &quot;In June, 2000,<br/>
the United States Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote<br/>
overturned a unanimous ruling by the New Jersey<br/>
Supreme Court in the James Dale case and upheld the<br/>
right of the BSA to bar from its ranks gay SCOUTS and<br/>
scout leaders.&quot; (from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uua.org/news/scouts/)">http://www.uua.org/news/scouts/)</a><br/>
 <br/>
&lt;So I asked if a child and parents with Buddhist<br/>
beliefs or beliefs in American Indian gods or Pagan<br/>
gods would feel welcome.&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Unitarian Universalists (like me) Boy Scouts are not<br/>
welcome to earn their Religion in Life emblem,<br/>
according to the official boy scout policy. They don&#39;t<br/>
&quot;approve&quot; of our religious teaching which specifically<br/>
includes respect for all, not just heterosexuals.  You<br/>
can read more about the ongoing dispute at the link<br/>
listed above.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wondering, but if the boy believes in himself as the &#39;supreme being&#39;, <br/>
is that still workable?  He&#39;s religious about GameBoy, so we&#39;re good to go <br/>
there... (small grin)<br/>
I&#39;m asking just as a sort-of-wondering.  My darling atheist son (of his own <br/>
choice) is not interested in boy scouts, so it&#39;s not really an issue for <br/>
us, except in the wider social sense.<br/>

booklet from our church. He worked thru it at home (although his leaders<br/>
knew he was doing it) and then was awarded it in front of the whole church<br/>
-- quite a big one and he got loads of applause. He told everyone that if<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t let him wear if then he would quit the pack but no one ever<br/>
said a word. I think again it has to do with your leaders more than anything.<br/>
<br/>
They ended up quitting when we moved here anyway but it was a good<br/>
experience for him to have to decide where he stood on his beliefs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834168460">i don&#39;t think lisa meant that boyscouts justified slavery, but they do <br/>
justify discrimitory practices (against gays and those who don&#39;t believe <br/>
as they believe) in the name of &quot;wholesome&quot; living.  Slave owners <br/>
justified slavery saying blacks were not as smart as whites and that <br/>
they were rescuing them from swinging in trees in africa and showing <br/>
them god.  Those that killed native americans justified it by saying <br/>
they were heathens and that whites needed the land.  Boyscouts use god <br/>
and godly living as a reason for their behavior--it&#39;s a very old reason <br/>
for behavior that hurts others.<br/>
