<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063267706">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I would definately expose them as the older they get,<br/>
the harder it may be to deal with it.  Also, you need<br/>
to expose your child to the infected child within the<br/>
window of contagiousness; so don&#39;t think too long<br/>
about it, or you may miss your opportunity.  Try<br/>
having the kids share a drinking cup or eating utensil<br/>
etc. to share germs via saliva.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that you and some of your children may be<br/>
immune!<br/>
<br/>
Also, with people immunizing for Chicken Pox<br/>
now-a-days, it&#39;s seems harder and harder to find<br/>
someone with it.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885238678">Hello.  My husband (49 yo) had them in June. Covered from head to toe.<br/>
Covered.  Doctor walked in, took one look, and said, &quot;You&#39;re f***ed.&quot; Doctor<br/>
gave him an antiviral medicine, and he was completely healed in two weeks.<br/>
Son (14) had them, well, today is day 20.  He had them much worse than his<br/>
dad, but he couldn&#39;t take the antiviral med (it made him itch worse).  He&#39;s<br/>
just now losing the scabs and no longer contagious.  Every one of the spots<br/>
started to get infected, and I had to take him in for antibiotics.  I hate<br/>
antibiotics, but this really scared me.  Any more questions, because we&#39;re<br/>
still dealing with it, and it&#39;s very fresh in my mind. I&#39;ve been putting<br/>
vitamin E on the worst marks on his face to hopefully minimize the scarring,<br/>
but I see three or four that are going to be noticeable.<br/>

I was 19.  I only had about 20 spots, on my back and side, and I thought it <br/>
was chigger bites or something because I&#39;d been camping.  But it turned out the <br/>
little boy who was camping with us came down with big chicken pox that week <br/>
too, and my case was just quite mild. I was a little woozy and slightly <br/>
feverish, but there were midterm tests to take, and I went but sat in the back away <br/>
from others.  <br/>
<br/>
Student health left a message for me to call them, and I got told off for <br/>
going to class.  They said &quot;We said to stay away from other people.&quot;  I said <br/>
&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t sit by anyone.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
They meant REALLY away. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My mom had tried to expose me when I was 11 and my two cousins and sister had <br/>
it all at once.  I slept with them, played with them, shared glasses, but <br/>
didn&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids had it from and with other kids in the babysitting co-op.  My friend <br/>
Carol (who wrote the thing about late reading) had her kids get it in series, <br/>
so it took two months.  Like clockwork, after two weeks one more would break <br/>
out, but not three; then two weeks later one more, not two.<br/>
<br/>
We babysat the sickies sometimes because my kids had already had it, except <br/>
Holly and we didn&#39;t mind her getting it.  Her case was bad in that there were <br/>
lots of spots, in ears, everywhere.  She pretty much lived in the tub.  She was <br/>
little.  She played with a sock full of oatmeal, and we put calamine on <br/>
after, and the whole drawn out deal.  It seems like it will last forever on day <br/>
three, but it doesn&#39;t ultimately last long at all.<br/>

My closest friend here in WV had them (for a second time) when she was <br/>
43...it totally floored her.  She was sick for over a month, bedridden for part of <br/>
it.  She hates medicine though, and I think she tried to get through without <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
At a church we attended years ago, an 18 yo boy died from Chicken Pox.  But I <br/>
dont&#39; know all the circumstances...could have been a reaction to the <br/>
medicine, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I heard once that it can cause sterility in adults, like the mumps <br/>
can...anyone know if that&#39;s true?<br/>

Chicken pox never really leaves, it&#39;s just that your body learns to deal with it, but it can sort of re-activate years later and cause shingles. So any one who&#39;s had chicken pox as a child (95% of us) is at risk for shingles as an adult.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69014265">Chicken pox does kill. So do cars and boats and planes and we don&#39;t <br/>
all fear them and avoid them although some people die each year. It <br/>
is tragic, of course, but assuming that we &quot;prevent&quot; deaths with <br/>
vaccines, which also have serious risks, is like never riding in a <br/>
vehicle to prevent accidents. Everything has to be weighed for its <br/>
pros and cons based on your best information. Health care, like any <br/>
life decision, has no guarantees. Security is a superstition. <br/>
<br/>
Be informed, see the CDC site about disease occurances, severity, age <br/>
of greatest risks, and vaccines side-effects for yourself. <br/>
Extrapolate these numbers for all Americans (274 million) and 3.7 <br/>
million babies born in 2000, 72 million children under 18 (US census <br/>
data). Read the government&#39;s vaccine adverse events reporting system <br/>
on line at VAERS.org. You will be astounded at the number and <br/>
severity of events reported to be corrolated with the vaccines <br/>
compared to the number of children vaccinated. (Approximately 26 <br/>
vaccines per child by age 4).<br/>
<br/>
The huge number of vaccines multiplies the risk of an adverse effect <br/>
every time the child is exposed to the toxins in the vaccines. See <br/>
vaccine ingredients on-line, some of these are known neurotoxins. It <br/>
isn&#39;t too incomprehensible why parents of autistic children and <br/>
scientists are questioning if the vaccines are not corrolated in the <br/>
dramatic increase in newly diagnosed autism (0.3/10,000 to 2.1/10,000 <br/>
cases: 1100 case in 1988 to 7700 cases in 1999. A sevenfold increase <br/>
in 10 years. (See autism incidence on-line). Just as the number of <br/>
vaccines &quot;required&quot; with mercury and other toxic ingredients have <br/>
increased dramatically. <br/>
<br/>
Mind you after 30-40 years of mercury in our children&#39;s vaccines the <br/>
system has recently decided it might be safer to remove it. No <br/>
admission that it isn&#39;t safe to inject thimerosal (mercury) into <br/>
people. (Many adult vaccines still have mercury, and are even given <br/>
to pregnant women!) How much mercury is too much for any one <br/>
individual infant, child or fetus?<br/>
<br/>
Is it too late for many children? YOU have to decide as the parent, <br/>
or let your child decide when she or he can understand the risks and <br/>
potential benefits of vaccination. What other practice and <br/>
institutions do we sheepishly follow without questioning in America <br/>
than the vaccines and education system? Doctors and teachers are not <br/>
the experts for all knowledge. Question assumptions and conclusions, <br/>
yours, theirs and mine. Injections are permanent choices.<br/>
<br/>
Critical thinking. Yes, even in of most ingrained belief systems. I <br/>
know, I was part of the medical system. It was harder to question <br/>
inside the system but for my child&#39;s sake I do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167143660">Yeah, I really didn&#39;t know if there was any validity to that statement.  I<br/>
just know that it worried dh, because he was made to believe that his pox<br/>
would/could turn into shingles.  Actually, I don&#39;t even really know what<br/>
shingles are!  I&#39;m going to have to look that up...<br/>

~Andrea<br/>
<br/>
Ahh...here is something from Indiana University Health Center:<br/>
<br/>
What is shingles?<br/>
Shingles is a painful skin eruption caused by the varicella zoster virus,<br/>
the same virus that causes chicken pox. The virus remains dormant in a nerve<br/>
root near the spinal cord after chicken pox. Fatigue,emotional upsets,<br/>
immune suppressive drugs (such as corticosteriods), radiation therapy or<br/>
unknown factors cause the virus to reactivate. When it reactivates, it<br/>
travels down the nerve to the skin. Anyone can get shingles if they have had<br/>
chicken pox but it is more likely to occur in older people.<br/>
<br/>
What are symptoms of shingles?<br/>
Pain usually begins along the nerve before the rash appears. Itching,<br/>
burning or weakness in the associated muscles may also be present. The rash<br/>
usually develops within a few days after the pain begins. The rash appears<br/>
as groups of small blisters on the skin along the nerve tract.This often<br/>
occurs on one side of the chest or face, but may appear on any part of the<br/>
body. The blisters crust and heal during the next two weeks. Pain may<br/>
persist for weeks or sometimes months after the rash heals.<br/>
<br/>
Treatment<br/>
Antiviral medications such as acyclovir can be used to reduce the pain and<br/>
promote healing if started early in the course of illness. Pain relief<br/>
medicine and soothing soaks or lotions may also be used.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890928333">I had chickenpox at 9, and I remember it.  As illnesses go, not so bad, tho the itching drove me crazy.  <br/>
 <br/>
In high school, my friend next door had them at 15, and it was awful -- she had them in her mouth, inside her ears -- virtually everywhere and she was miserable.  I was told it was because of her age.  <br/>
 <br/>
In more recent years, a cousin of mine had them at 9, very similar to my friend above -- pox in her mouth and throat, etc.  An neighbor&#39;s son had them at age 10 (just after being vaxxed to prevent them) and was miserable, very sick. His younger brother, then 3yo, had a very mild case.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think, just like with any illness, there are a lot of factors.  Probably everything from one&#39;s age, to current health status, to diet, and overall constitution.  Two years ago at our house, we had a virus run thru -- Dan (16mos then) landed in the hospital. Gary and the other boys (6 & 17) threw up for a couple of days. My Mom was sick for almost a week. I never caught it, tho I tended to everyone except my Mom.  <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s part of why I&#39;m not really all that worried by the vax-preventable illnesses.  It&#39;s all a big crapshoot, anyway.  Keep the kids as healthy as you can, and hope for the best.  <br/>
 <br/>
The only one that concerns me is Rubella, for its risk to pregnant women. If I had a daughter, I&#39;d tell her about the risks measles while pregnant so she could choose to be vaxed, and that it might be a good idea for her partner to also be vaxed by the time they want children.  <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Is this another modern day myth?  I hear people say it is worse to get chicken pox when you&#39;re older, but I know at least one toddler who had a horrible case - so I know it can be worse for some younger children too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527754484">My son had a mild case of chicken pox when he was 4--barely phased him<br/>
actually and he only had a few sores.  When he was 8 he had a much more<br/>
severe case--LOTS of sores everywhere.  They hurt him most in his groin area<br/>
and armpits.  But the thing that surprized me was his fever.  He was really<br/>
out of it, even deliriously mumbling nonsense in his half-sleep. He had<br/>
never been that sick before, and I don&#39;t believe, since (he&#39;s 15 and living<br/>
in Alaska with his dad, so I don&#39;t know for sure, even though I&#39;m in pretty<br/>
constant contact.)  Still, I felt comfortable just trying to make him as<br/>
comfortable as possible, while letting the fever do it&#39;s thing.  (As a side<br/>
note, I also chose not to vaccinate any of my children for anything based on<br/>
ongoing research on my part.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477122239">At a church we attended years ago, an 18 yo boy died from Chicken Pox.  But I dont&#39; know all the circumstances...could have been a reaction to the medicine, etc. <br/>
 <br/>
*****<br/>
When I was in high school, a teenage boy died from Reyes Syndrome, which developed after his parents gave him aspirin when he had chickenpox.  Apparently, something about aspirin and chickenpox can cause that.  <br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
I heard once that it can cause sterility in adults, like the mumps can...anyone know if that&#39;s true?<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve heard that chickenpox exposure for a pregnant woman can cause deafness for the baby.  Also, from what I&#39;ve read, it&#39;s really quite rare for mumps to cause sterility in men.  The virus would have to infect both testes, and significantly enough to cause a rupture.  Really doesn&#39;t happen very often. <br/>

&lt;&lt; What other practice and <br/>
<br/>
institutions do we sheepishly follow without questioning in America <br/>
<br/>
than the vaccines and education system? Doctors and teachers are not <br/>
<br/>
the experts for all knowledge. Question assumptions and conclusions, <br/>
<br/>
yours, theirs and mine. Injections are permanent choices.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Critical thinking. Yes, even in of most ingrained belief systems. I <br/>
<br/>
know, I was part of the medical system. It was harder to question <br/>
<br/>
inside the system but for my child&#39;s sake I do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just such hard work.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people have spent as much risky energy as they had in them to <br/>
take their kids out of school, and there they are, very busy moms of children, <br/>
and then they&#39;re expected to research vaccines, and foods, and reward/punishment <br/>
factors in childrearing, and whether video games will create criminals, and <br/>
what cars and carseats are safest, and whether living here or there will be <br/>
best, and whether a child has to wear all cotton and use more expensive cotton <br/>
sheets or some polyester isn&#39;t his problem...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, and it&#39;s not crucial, in a way.  It&#39;s a choice.<br/>
<br/>
People can go along to get along.  They can use their peripheral vision and <br/>
do what their friends and neighbors are doing, and few will blame them if the <br/>
outcome isn&#39;t ideal.   <br/>
<br/>
The worst part is the outcome isn&#39;t guaranteed to be ideal even if you DO <br/>
research the heck out of the world and make all your best decisions.  And if you <br/>
have wrestled science and culture and family down so that they will not stop <br/>
you, then you&#39;re solely responsible for the results of your decisions, and <br/>
that&#39;s harder for some people to accept than the vagaries of following the herd.<br/>
<br/>
If people send their kids to school and get them vaccinated, then they can <br/>
blame other people for bad outcome, unless they knew they had a choice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the choice itself that causes the responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Darn it.<br/>
<br/>
Life is hard.<br/>
<br/>
Within the current conversation, I&#39;m just relieved that my kids all had <br/>
chicken pox when they were little.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby had vaccinations his first few years.  Marty had a very few.  Holly had <br/>
almost none.  Something in the hospital.  We refused live polio vaccines <br/>
because one of the dads in our babysitting co-op was an organ transplant diabetic, <br/>
waiting for another transplant, and the clinic didn&#39;t have killed vaccine, so <br/>
we wandered away.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someday one of my kids will get polio and I might feel that it&#39;s All My <br/>
Fault.<br/>
<br/>
Religion is really good in cases like this.  People pray for guidance, do <br/>
what they think God wants, and say &quot;Will of God...mysterious ways...&quot; if it&#39;s <br/>
disappointing down the line.<br/>

This is very much what my sister does.  It&#39;s easier to go along with what&#39;s expected and just hope for the best, than to do any research or question anything.  At some times, it&#39;s almost been like a child who covers her ears and sings la-la-la-la so she won&#39;t hear any bad news.  She&#39;s actually said, &#39;yes, I know there are risks, but nothing bad has happened yet, do I don&#39;t want to hear about it.&#39;<br/>
 <br/>
I just don&#39;t get that -- I can&#39;t not ask and question.  Just too skeptical, I guess.<br/>

I was just stating what I had learned about chicken pox in response to what someone had said about how it could be serious. Frankly, I think 12 deaths in a population of 30 million where almost everybody gets the disease is very, very small and not worth a widespread vaccination program (That doesn&#39;t sound right, sounds uncaring about those deaths I know). My son was vaccinated but I wish I&#39;d read more (though I&#39;m not sure my decision would have been different). Catherine made the choice not to have the chicken pox vaccine after we talked about it and I&#39;m fine with that (though I did not give her the same choice about other vaxes unfortunately). They&#39;ve both had all the vaxs the province reccomends and I&#39;m satified that it did not harm them. I&#39;m not satisfied about having made the right choice however as I did very little research. One thing I&#39;ve come to realize is that because a decision did no harm does NOT mean it was the right one or made properly. <br/>

Did  anybody on this list have them when &quot;older&quot; and not have too bad of  a<br/>

most people had them so young that they don&#39;t remember how  sick they were?<br/>
The people who had them when they were old enough to  remember simply<br/>
remember how bad it was?  My mother says I had chicken  pox, but I don&#39;t<br/>
remember it, so it must have been before I was  &quot;older&quot;.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

I already gave my story, I think. I was 13 and was COVERED. On the palms of  <br/>
my hands, on the soles of my feet, in my mouth, and in my vagina. I  had a <br/>
dangerously high fever. Laid up in bed for three weeks.<br/>
 <br/>
My brother got them iimediately after me. He&#39;s fifteen months younger. He  <br/>
was sparsely affected. <br/>

Cameron got them when he was almost five. Mild fever, just  &quot;uncomfortable&quot;.<br/>
