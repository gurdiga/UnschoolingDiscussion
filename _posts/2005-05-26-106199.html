<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555206139"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There was a time when the only<br/>
 </span></blockquote>way for a kid to get information from  <br/>
outside <br/>
his home and neighborhood was books.  (Think Abraham<br/>
Lincoln, log  <br/>
cabin in <br/>
the woods far from centers of learning.)   Now books<br/>
tend to  be <br/>
outdated, and <br/>
google.com is better for information.  If Abraham<br/>
Lincoln  had had <br/>
full-color <br/>
DVDs of the sights of other countries, of people<br/>
speaking in  their <br/>
native <br/>
accents and languages,  and of history, he would have <br/>
shoved those <br/>
books aside <br/>
and watched those videos.<br/>
 <br/>
When someone thinks books are the one crucial step to<br/>
any  further <br/>
learning, <br/>
then books and school have crippled that person&#39;s<br/>
ability to  think <br/>
expansively, and to see what&#39;s unfolding in front of<br/>
them in the real  <br/>
world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>just wanted to bookmark this quote because it is an<br/>
important one. I have come around to seeing this the<br/>
hard way through my son. two years ago after ps I<br/>
tried to limit videogames. I have given up. now he<br/>
surfs the net every day and I forward my &quot;so simple to<br/>
make money this way a child could do it&quot; emails to him<br/>
to screen and make a decision. he&#39;ll be 12 in a month,<br/>
but his onscreen identities are 18+.<br/>
I supervise to screen out net predators, but that&#39;s<br/>
all. He&#39;s way ahead of me in cyberspace.<br/>
