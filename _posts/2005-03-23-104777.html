I bought  her cookie cutters and receipe books from e bay and printed them <br/>
off the  internet and she has turned her cookie love into a little hobby and <br/>
sells the  cookies to her friends, on a stall each year and gives them wrapped as <br/>
 gifts.<br/>
<br/>

On a side note, our family visited the cookie cutter museum in Joplin,  <br/>
Missouri yesterday.  There are cookie cutter clubs and exchanges throughout  the <br/>
world.  Amazing how the littlist items can turn out so BIG.<br/>
