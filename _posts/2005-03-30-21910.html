working here. My kids are reluctant to try new things that I <br/>

<br/>
I know that they are learning, but it just seems like they are <br/>
bored, and I am not sure what to do. I don&#39;t want to push them into <br/>
doing things, but at the same time, how do they learn about things <br/>

This is where I get confused. It seems I should be constantly <br/>

about going places. It seems they have an attitude about <br/>
homeschoolers too. They say I don&#39;t want to go if we are going with <br/>
the HS group. We rarely even do anything with them. And there are a <br/>

don&#39;t get it. I know I don&#39;t want them to go to school, but at the <br/>

admitting that, but it is the truth. I know people that are <br/>
unschooling IRL, but they struggle too. It just seems like everyone <br/>
else has more exciting things going on.<br/>
<br/>
Any inspiration you can offer me? Please?!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let Them Be Bored.  They&#39;ll find something to do.  Boredom is a great <br/>
catalyst to learning.  In the meantime, you find something interesting <br/>
to do.  Model self-starting.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids always hated going places, too.  They were reluctant to leave <br/>
whatever they were doing in order to do something else, including <br/>
eating meals.  Usually, they enjoyed an outing once they got there.  I <br/>
had to make sure they understood that they truly did have a choice; if <br/>
they didn&#39;t want to go, we didn&#39;t go, with no shaming repercussions for <br/>
that choice.  (I didn&#39;t buy tickets in advance to anything ;-)<br/>

other homeschoolers, they wouldn&#39;t go.  They preferred to go at their <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How long have you been living it?  Not &quot;doing&quot; it, but living it?  <br/>
Unschooling has less to do with activities than with philosophy, I <br/>
think.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excitement is overrated.  Too much stimulation is just exhausting to <br/>
some of us, and is counter-productive for learning.  Long periods of <br/>
just hanging out, daydreaming, contemplating, and digesting are <br/>
essential.  What are these unschoolers you know struggling with?  And <br/>
by unschoolers, do you mean the parents or the kids?<br/>

<br/>
Forget &quot;learning&quot; ;-)  You have lots of time; your boys should be <br/>
spending it playing -- Humans learn by playing.  My 17 y.o. daughter <br/>
just said to tell you &quot;let &#39;em outside to find bugs.&quot;  Bugs are great:  <br/>
I have a spider living on the outside of my kitchen window; we&#39;ve <br/>
watched her catch and eat several large insects, and now she&#39;s guarding <br/>
her egg sac.  We&#39;re looking forward to spiderlings.  Every fall we <br/>
watch the orb web spiders spin a new web each evening; my kids like to <br/>
toss moths into them (we also have a pet tarantula, I should confess!).<br/>
<br/>
If your boys aren&#39;t into bugs, I&#39;m sure they have lots of other things <br/>
they like; let them show you, without you trying to direct them into <br/>
something &quot;edumacational&quot; ;-)  (That&#39;s Homer Simpson, fyi.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664039586">&lt;&lt;Mine *hated* group activities; if the outing was a field trip with <br/>
other homeschoolers, they wouldn&#39;t go.  They preferred to go at their <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids were never big on group activities either.  They would only want to<br/>
go to a group thing once in a while (if they really thought they&#39;d love the<br/>
place) and only if it was something that we couldn&#39;t do without a group.<br/>
Sometimes things are much more affordable with a group too.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t just about going places.  It&#39;s also about exposing them to<br/>
things through books, movies, conversation, TV, etc.  It felt to me that my<br/>
kids didn&#39;t have a passion for a long time.  I&#39;d see other homeschoolers who<br/>
did all these great things that they were passionate about (karate, dance,<br/>
volunteering, etc.) and it seemed like my kids just played, for a long time.<br/>
We didn&#39;t go to a LOT of things then, but we did plod along, going to the<br/>
things that interested the kids here and there.  Like you, I felt it was my<br/>
job to expose them to stuff but it was only fun if they wanted to be there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, one trip to a riding stable and the kids found their passion and we&#39;ve<br/>
been on a great ride ever since.  :-)  Before the horse obsession, we played<br/>
lots of board games, played outside a lot, (in winter cross country skiing,<br/>
snow shoeing, sliding), (in summer, camping, swimming, going to beaches,<br/>
lakes, state parks, etc.), we walked to the farms nearby a lot to visit the<br/>
animals, read aloud a lot, and the kids just played pretend a lot, and we<br/>
did the occasional field trip (sometimes alone, sometimes with a group).<br/>
Post horse obsession, we do the horse thing twice a day and fit the other<br/>
stuff in around the edges if we have time.  Some things my kids enjoyed<br/>
doing alone were local animal rescues/parks, forts, museums, children&#39;s<br/>
museums, going on picnics in the woods, hiking small mountains, swimming<br/>
where we had a membership, cooking, gosh, I can&#39;t remember what else.  Some<br/>
things we did with groups in the past were theater, small zoo, art class,<br/>
going to the ballet, stable tour, hiking, playing baseball, going to living<br/>
history places (did that alone too), can&#39;t think what else right now, but a<br/>
fair amount of things. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What about having the kids over to play, rather than seeing them in a group?<br/>
I say, just try to enjoy your day.  Follow your own passions.  Make<br/>
opportunities available to the boys and they will find their passion one day<br/>
and if they never have a passion that&#39;s o.k. too.  They might just enjoy<br/>
doing a lot of different things or just using their imaginations for a long<br/>
time.  <br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s a list new to my site, by Deb Lewis.  It&#39;s a far-north-winter list, <br/>
but still...<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strew/deblist">http://sandradodd.com/strew/deblist</a><br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re pretty new to unschooling, maybe look again at deschooling:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
Will your boys watch movies with you?  The more common knowledge you have <br/>
between and among you--music, jokes, sights, experiences--the better your <br/>
relationship will be, the more conversant you&#39;ll be in their lives.  Hang out with <br/>
them and do what they want to do rather than try to draw them out to do what you <br/>
want to do.  BE with *them.*<br/>
<br/>
When people say &quot;be with them&quot; they too often emphasize the &#39;with,&#39; but I <br/>
think the BEing is the most important part.   Be interested with them and excited <br/>
with them and sad with them.  Be with them emotionally and intellectually, at <br/>
their level.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amie - You could be describing my kids, ds 12 and dd 10.  Sometimes <br/>
when one interest is winding down, and the new interest hasn&#39;t <br/>
started yet, I hear them say they are bored.  But they don&#39;t want to <br/>
go anywhere, and the things I suggest don&#39;t interest them.  But I <br/>
just go about my business (my busy-ness), checking in with them <br/>
frequently during the day, and before I know it they are totally <br/>
into something new.  Now, that something isn&#39;t looking up <br/>
information about whales or volcanoes or dinosaurs or anything <br/>
schooly, but I can assure you, they are using their brains, their <br/>
creativity.  <br/>
<br/>
Pretend they are on summer vacation--one that never ends.  That <br/>
usually helps me because I can still remember what summer vacation <br/>
felt like.  About a week or two into it, I would get bored, <br/>
restless.  And then I would realize that I had weeks and weeks to do <br/>
whatever I wanted!!!  And I could do nothing at all if I wanted!!!  <br/>
Were your summers like that?  I loved it.  My kids have it even <br/>
better than that &#39;cause they have a grown-up (me) at their beck and <br/>
call to help them bake those cookies they are in the mood for, or <br/>
sit down and chat with them, and cheer them on when they hit the <br/>
next level with a video game they have been working on.   Both my <br/>
parents were gone all day to work and I stayed home with a <br/>
babysitter and 3 siblings.  <br/>
<br/>
The amazing thing about unschooling is that &quot;doing nothing&quot; is so <br/>
productive.  I think I have interesting, educated kids, and they got <br/>
that way playing video games, playing with cars and stuffed animals, <br/>
watching cartoons on TV.  I don&#39;t know what you visualize other <br/>
unschooled kids doing all day, but I can assure you mine aren&#39;t  <br/>
researching ancient Egypt.   My kids know about pyramids and <br/>
mummies, and I can&#39;t tell you how!  I read Smithsonian magazine <br/>
every month, but I have never seen them so much as flip the pages of <br/>
it.   <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580113164"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;  It just seems like everyone<br/>
&gt;&gt; else has more exciting things going on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe the others, those whose lives look more exiting, are people who <br/>
view the mundane things, the ordinary family-centered everyday things, <br/>
as more exciting? Maybe it is a difference in perspective?<br/>
<br/>
It really makes a huge difference how the parent is feeling about what <br/>
the kids are doing.<br/>
<br/>
My sister inadvertently taught me this when her now-24 yo son was only <br/>
about 4 years old. They had old very beat-up furniture and her son, <br/>
Alex, was standing next to a couch with holes in it. He was pulling out <br/>
little bits of stuffing and rolling it in his fingers, feeling the <br/>
texture, stuffing it back in, pulling out another tuft, feeling it, and <br/>
so on. He had a faraway look in his eyes and was clearly really focused <br/>
on experiencing the sensation of the texture of those tufts of couch <br/>
stuffing.<br/>
<br/>
She and I walked in and saw him at the same moment. MY reaction would <br/>
have been to stop him from pulling stuffing out of the old couch. Julie <br/>
stopped and smiled and said, quietly to me, &quot;Look at that - he is <br/>
having such a deep sensual experience just with a bit of stuffing from <br/>
an old couch. How wonderful!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another parent might have complained, &quot;My kid is so bored he&#39;s <br/>
literally pulling the stuffing out of our old couch. That&#39;s the best <br/>
thing he can find to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This might sound sort of phony or silly and unimportant - I&#39;m just <br/>
recommending that people look at what their kids ARE doing and see if <br/>
they can change their own thinking about it - see it in the best <br/>
possible way. It doesn&#39;t change what they&#39;re doing, but it changes the <br/>
&quot;tone&quot; in the home and that is so all-important it can&#39;t be <br/>
overemphasized.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, to be honest, I don&#39;t think people who are negative, <br/>
pessimistic, or cynical are going to make great unschooling parents and <br/>
that if they know themselves to be that way, they owe it to their kids <br/>
to work on being more positive, optimistic, and especially at not <br/>
expressing even minimal scorn. They&#39;ll do better by choosing to be more <br/>
child-like themselves, more filled with wonder at even little ordinary <br/>
aspects of life.<br/>
