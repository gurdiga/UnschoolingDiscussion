We lived in PA for several years. They ask for a copy of your HS diploma<br/>
in order to homeschool your kids. If my kids ever end up in PA, decide to<br/>
homeschool their kids and send in a copy of a diploma I create for them<br/>
today, I wonder if it&#39;ll work. PA laws inhale wind!<br/>

Simple solution!  Make it look good and what are they going to do <br/>
about it?  My daughter turned down a full 4 year scholarship to a <br/>
very nice private school because she prefers unschooling.  The <br/>
diplomas from this very nice private boarding school are not fancy.  <br/>
I could duplicate one of theirs any day.  My own from high school is <br/>
not fancy, either.  Soooooooo, unless PA has laws or regulations that <br/>
make you provide a certified high school transcript who is going to <br/>
know? <br/>
