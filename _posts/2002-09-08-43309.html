<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233258892">I&#39;ve been deleting alot of postings since Ned&#39;s posts have been <br/>
blocked...I&#39;m sorry, but I was truly disappointed that someone so <br/>
interesting was prevented from posting.  That said, I just started <br/>
reading again, and was pleasantly surprised to find some very <br/>
interesting, albeit controversial, topics bouncing around, sans <br/>
Ned!  I am a Christian unschooler, and the mother of 7.  Like the <br/>
poster, H., I believe in monitoring what my children read, watch, or <br/>
do, even though I trust them. Why? Because I think that should be a <br/>
part of parenting.  I, too, am a little shocked at the attitude that <br/>
children can decide what is good or bad for themselves.  At a <br/>
certain age, yes, and I think that age varies with each child, but <br/>
in general, I think the lure of pornography is very strong and very <br/>
dangerous (even for many adult men!  It has ruined many a marriage)  <br/>
I have a 22-year-old son who always jokes that I &quot;ruined&quot; dirty <br/>
magazines for him by nursing his siblings so long and openly.  He <br/>
says if he looked at a woman in a magazine he would probably just <br/>
imagine them nursing an infant and it would ruin the whole <br/>
thing. :o)   We had talks with him and all our children know we <br/>
think Playboy and other such magazines are a sinful portrayal of <br/>
both women and sex. (yes, we do still believe in sin at our house) <br/>
We wouldn&#39;t have any Karma Sutra books or games in our house either, <br/>
and we have raised our children to believe sex outside of marriage <br/>
is wrong too.  Luckily, my oldest son has found a wonderful girl who <br/>
believes that too.  However, they also know that we believe humans <br/>
make mistakes and they could come to us if they ever got into <br/>
trouble in any way.  My daughter was a virgin when she got married a <br/>
year ago, and is proud of that.  I have a 15-year-old son who stays <br/>
up until 11:00 and watches &quot;Friends&quot; (which we have talked about- <br/>
those characters sleep around pretty freely, we had to talk about <br/>
that)  As a family, we often watch war movies that are rated &quot;R&quot; but <br/>
we limit our other video-viewing to rated &quot;G&quot; or maybe &quot;PG&quot; (which <br/>
limits us greatly, but we have better things to do than watch <br/>
television anyway)  I don&#39;t know who brought it up awhile back about <br/>
music and video viewing, but I agree that what we listen to or watch <br/>
has a strong influence in what we become.  I would add reading to <br/>
that, too.  My kids read voraciously but there are books they end up <br/>
setting aside because of the content, just as I do. We even <br/>
hesitated on the Harry Potter books for a very long time because I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to &quot;invite Satan into my home&quot; (as my mother put it)  I <br/>
let the older children read it and they weren&#39;t impressed and didn&#39;t <br/>
jump on the Harry Potter bandwagon like they probably would have if <br/>
they had been in school.   I mentioned once we are fairly isolated, <br/>
and we like it that way.  That also means my children are not really <br/>
exposed to peer pressure until they are old enough to deal with it <br/>
really well.   This is apparent if you are around my children for <br/>
any length of time.  They don&#39;t care what is &quot;in&quot;, they don&#39;t feel <br/>
the need to dress a certain way, they read what they want, unlike <br/>
their schooled cousins who read what everyone else is reading, wear <br/>
what everyone else is wearing and listen to whatever everyone else <br/>
is listening to.   They don&#39;t get caught up in the latest fads, <br/>
either.  They don&#39;t know that a 16-year-old isn&#39;t supposed to want <br/>
to play with his younger siblings, or if they do know that, they <br/>
don&#39;t care. Anyway, I am getting off-topic, my basic point is that <br/>
we do monitor what they watch, read, listen to, in a fairly loose <br/>
and flexible way. (in other words, they can convince us to let them <br/>
read or watch something if they can point out or find some merit in <br/>
it)<br/>
I missed the references to birth and discipline but I sure hope no <br/>
one on this list follows the Ferber or whats his name (the couple <br/>
who strongly encourages letting babies cry it out and now I can&#39;t <br/>
remember their names)method of controlling their babies.  I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine an unschooler being so rigid.  I guess with nursing on <br/>
demand, going with the flow, family-bedding type of parents we are, <br/>
we naturally turned towards unschooling.  <br/>
In regards to birth, I&#39;ve had it all- laboring in 1980 lying flat on <br/>
my back hooked up to machines, laboring in 1987 walking the hospital <br/>
corridors until 10 cm. dilated and pushing a baby out in two pushes, <br/>
an emergency c-section, a V-Bac.... I would have loved a home <br/>
birth.  &quot;Mothering&quot; magazine has been one of my most helpful <br/>
resources in pregnancy and beyond.  Dr. William Sears&#39; books have <br/>
also been wonderful. He is a Christian attachment-parenting <br/>
advocate. <br/>
I&#39;ve rambled long enough, feeling very vocal today....  I think the <br/>
pornography issue got my blood going again.  I have 3 sons and this <br/>
is an area I am always sensitive to.  I never want any of them to <br/>
look at females in that way.  Of course, our family&#39;s religious <br/>
principles are our guiding force in these decisions.  But, religion <br/>
aside, I would have to say I would not want my son to have a friend <br/>
that is freely exposed to pornography in his own home.  (my oldest <br/>
son DID, and chose to end that friendship himself, after the <br/>
prominent lawyer&#39;s son pulled an X-rated video out of their cabinet <br/>
and popped it into the VCR one day)<br/>

<br/>
I would worry about what happened to all the friends and activities which <br/>
were keeping him happily busy all week for so many years, but IF he decided <br/>
he&#39;d rather read porn (he&#39;s not old enough to rent it and we don&#39;t have any <br/>
cable-porn) I would figure it was something he needed to explore and that he <br/>
would survive.<br/>
<br/>
He has SO many healthy relationships with people of both sexes, and adults, <br/>
married and unmarried, that it&#39;s not going to be his first or only <br/>
introduction to romance or sex (as it seems to be for some people).<br/>
<br/>
Asking that question about Kirby is like asking what would I do if he DID buy <br/>
a gun and join a street gang.  He isn&#39;t desperate for friends or input.  <br/>
<br/>
But having said that, I don&#39;t think viewing pornography becomes an addiction <br/>
for everyone who sees it, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s akin to getting a gun and <br/>
terrorizing the neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who was reading EVERY harlequin romance, until they started <br/>
publishing faster than she could read.  It was cutting into her actual <br/>
lovelife (she read them in bed to go to sleep, and her husband would fall <br/>
asleep before she did sometimes).  She said she&#39;d like to stop, or wished <br/>
they would stop making them.  That was an addiction.  It affected her <br/>
expectations of love and romance.  It didn&#39;t kill her or maim her.  She&#39;s <br/>
still married, they have two teenaged boys, and I bet those boys will never <br/>
become porn fiends, although I know their uncle and HE was a porn fiend when <br/>
the videos were $80 apiece and he bought them, long ago.  AND he wrote his <br/>
own.  AND he had a sex change operation.   So...  Their mom read Harlequin <br/>
romances.  Their paternal uncle is now an aunt.   Their dad is None of the <br/>
Above, a boyscout leader, a calmly straight guy.   So what are their risk <br/>
factors?  Genetics?    Their lives are safe, happy, busy and joyful.  Porn <br/>
can&#39;t possibly find its way into the top ten in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
(I don&#39;t think they&#39;re churchgoers, but dad was raised UU and the mom Mormon, <br/>
from SLC; genetic Mormon.)<br/>

I feel uncomfortable watching people control their children because <br/>
they are *theirs*. If a friend was doing something you didn&#39;t approve <br/>
of you would either discuss it with them and agree to differ or <br/>
wouldn&#39;t interfere. Children are people too and are deserving of the <br/>
same respect for what they think and do.<br/>
I also think an interest in pornography dring the teenage years is <br/>
natural. I may not like it and have tried to bring my sons up to be <br/>
open about women and respect all humans but should one day I <br/>
find a porno mag in their room I wouldn&#39;t try to shame them or <br/>
make them feel dirty or guilty.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was cleaning my 17 yo brother&#39;s room one day and <br/>
found a stack of mags under his bed. She cleaned the room and <br/>
neatly stacked them on his pillow but never ever said a word. If she <br/>
had yelled at him and treated him like he was 5 I imagine their <br/>
relationship wouldn&#39;t be astrustign and open as it is now he is 30.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160602674">Shyrley,  You have a cool Mom!  If it were my Mom she would have thrown them away and never said anything to him.  Nothing like denial and not dealing with anything!  I grew up in a loving environment too, they thought, but.... my parents were soooo uptight about sex that the whole porn thing was a total nothing to me.  I had no idea what exactly was in those movies!   <br/>
This kind of upbringing(for me) developed into shame for sexual feelings and all sorts of other uncertain feelings when it came to relationships.  I think if my parents would have discussed things with me, I may have had a clue and not put sex on the taboo list.  Along with drinking and other things.  <br/>
Sandra, I commend you for your honesty and people delving into your personal life.  I don&#39;t quite understand some accusations of not being involved in our children&#39;s lives just because we are trusting them.            Do we always have to expect the worse from our children?  hmmmmm...  I feel this goes with religious convictions sometimes!  IMO     <br/>
It seems that if we make something a taboo or off limits or a topic of avoidance its going to be a huge magnet for our children.  I feel this way about porn, drinking, drugs,,,,staying up late, eating snacks...the list goes on.  I&#39;m sure this has been discussed a ton on this list.       We just need to talk with our children and let them talk about how they are feeling.      <br/>
Thank you Sandra, Ren,Mary, Debs, Shyrley and others who have taught me so much on just being an accepting and loving parent and hopefully I can do a better job with my children than mine did with me!  They might not have all the hangups that I had to fight my way through. <br/>
 <br/>
Kelli,  who is going to shut up now for a while.<br/>
