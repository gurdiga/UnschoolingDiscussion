I am not an expert on this, but some things I&#39;ve done to keep it &#39;light&#39; include scanning the newspapers, esp the want-ads, for mistakes. Then dh and point them out to each other. It&#39;s kind of a game cause some of them can be quite funny. I think there&#39;s some program sold which does the same thing. <br/>
Also have asked dd(now 14) to edit my writing and find mistakes-ha ha she loves this. This has been really a need when I&#39;m in a hurry. <br/>
Sometime, take some sentences, change around the punctuation so that it changes the meaning of the sentence. Mad libs are a really fun way to play with words, although not directly about punctuation. <br/>
dd and her friends get a kick out of each other&#39;s spelling mistakes on e-mail, in a nice way. Her spelling seems to be improving because of that. <br/>
Let him see you trying to communicate clearly to someone- getting the idea across and improving your own grammar or spelling. Don&#39;t count mistakes, count improvement. If you can take a playful attitude and try to let it go if he&#39;s not interested in a particular thing, you might find your own way. <br/>
Good luck, <br/>
Mary T.  <br/>
