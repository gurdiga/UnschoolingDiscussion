<div id="ygrps-yiv-886978262">**Also it may be that those with early readers don&#39;t have the same need for <br/>
support or the ability to provide it with personal stories.**<br/>
<br/>
:) Probably a very good guess. Sometimes people get annoyed at discussions of <br/>
early readers or precocious math ability. <br/>
<br/>
So hey, I&#39;ll add a few more real live unschooled kids to the anecdotal <br/>
&quot;statistics&quot; pile here. I have three totally unschooled kids (never schooled <br/>
for a single day in their lives). 1 girl and the boy were reading fluently on <br/>
the early side of average. The girl read avidly for pleasure from then on, <br/>
the boy is rarely interested in fiction and only reads for information needs <br/>
not the pleasure of the hunt though he reads very well. The other girl was a <br/>
big surprise, she used sophisticated language at an early age but had a great <br/>
deal of trouble learning to read despite her earnest efforts. She wanted to <br/>
read early more than any of my children but ended up a late reader anyway, <br/>
still struggling with it. She has definite discernable differences in the way <br/>
she perceives the world and the printed page.<br/>
<br/>
The most interesting thing about her story is that she mostly never thought <br/>
of herself as a nonreader or slow reader. All those years when she wasn&#39;t <br/>
being remediated or prodded by anyone but herself, she could sit on the couch <br/>
taking an hour to read a five sentence paragraph, and know she was a reader. <br/>
<br/>
Except for the months when she was five that I HID the early readers and <br/>
phonics materials from her and helped her twin with reading only when she <br/>
wasn&#39;t around. But that&#39;s another story. :) No, really it&#39;s the same story. <br/>
She was at the time INSISTING on learning to read, insisting on trying over <br/>
and over and over until she was crying in frustration and I felt like joining <br/>
her. She wasn&#39;t ready. In spite of her sophisticated vocabulary she didn&#39;t <br/>
understand rhymes (so phonics made no sense to her) and couldn&#39;t see the <br/>
differences in words. <br/>
<br/>
It helped some. She still tried to read and failed but she wasn&#39;t so <br/>
frustrated because she knew she was trying to work with REALLY HARD STUFF so <br/>
it was okay in her head for her to be messing up.<br/>
<br/>
Well, see, I guess I just supported my point. The late reading stories are <br/>
usually more interesting, so that&#39;s what folks hear.  :)<br/>
