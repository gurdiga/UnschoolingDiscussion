What&#39;s the name of the classical-education curriculum?   Maybe at least I <br/>

It was from a list discussing Latin and &quot;classics&quot; so I&#39;m guessing mythology <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539923303">I was given a game called &quot;Puzz 3D Notre Dame Cathedral&quot;. You have to build<br/>
and then get to explore a Virtual 3D puzzle with other tasks inside. Very<br/>
beautiful graphics. There are others in the collection. This is possibly a<br/>
different suggestion than some of the others. I know there are those Empire<br/>
Building series of games that Kirby is probably familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t the classical education the rationale behind &quot;The Well-Trained Mind&quot;.<br/>

Well, last Christmas I gave my almost 11 year old son the Age of Mythology computer game and he loved it (he was/is very interested in mythology).  The developers used Bulfinch&#39;s Mythology as a guideline during development.   We got him the gift pack that included the game, a copy of Bulfinch&#39;s Mythology, a DVD on the making of the game, a CD of the game music, a couple of quick reference sheets, and a &quot;movie&quot; poster of the game.  He enjoyed many hours of game play.<br/>
<br/>
This Christmas he&#39;s getting The Titans expansion pack that came out for it.<br/>

There are games based on the Egyptians and other civilizations.  One of them <br/>
is called Pharaoh, and there are others but the names are blanking on me now.  <br/>
One of them I think actually has the word &quot;civilization&quot; in it, I think.  <br/>
When Jon was 11, he was way into Pharaoh.  <br/>

If you are talking about homeschooling curriculum,<br/>
there are several.  I think The Well Trained Mind is<br/>
the most popular &quot;non christian&quot; one, as well as<br/>
several christian ones like Tapestry of Grace.<br/>
<br/>
Dorothy Sayers is a popular author.  She wrote &quot;The<br/>
Lost Tools of Learning&quot;.  Here is a link to a web page<br/>
with more info: <br/>

And wasn&#39;t there a critique of this program that there were actually 5 areas <br/>
in a &quot;classical&quot; education from ancient times instead of 3, and two were left <br/>
out because they were unbiblical or something like that?  I&#39;d like to read it <br/>
again if anyone knows what I&#39;m talking about.  <br/>
