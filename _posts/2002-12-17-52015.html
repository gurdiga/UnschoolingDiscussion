 </span></blockquote>We attend story-time at our local library and a local daycare/preschool <br/>
usually brings in a group of about 10 kids to pick out books. There&#39;s a <br/>
puppet theater there that my kids love to play in and I&#39;ve watched the <br/>
daycare kids look wistfully at it. The teachers seem in bad moods most of the <br/>
time and I&#39;ve listened as they tell kids that they can&#39;t pick a book this <br/>
week because they forgot to bring in last week&#39;s book, or to get away from <br/>
the puppet theater, or to quit talking and hurry up. My ds is 5 and all of <br/>
his friends go to school and I wonder what he thinks when he watches the kids <br/>
leave in a straight line and look back at us as we play.<br/>
