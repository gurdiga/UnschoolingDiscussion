<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784088411">I am on board with seeing television as a source of education and am<br/>
not opposed to it as a source of entertainment either. What I&#39;m<br/>
struggling with right now is how our house is set up. When the TV is<br/>
on, it dominates the acoustic space.<br/>
<br/>
That means that the kids who do have to study (I have one part time<br/>
enrolled in high school and another who has chosen to follow The Well<br/>
Trained Mind program of his own accord and a third in college part<br/>
time) and me (who is in grad school) don&#39;t have the quiet necessary to<br/>
focus. It doesn&#39;t help to leave the room. The entire downstairs can<br/>
hear the TV. The primary place to study is the kitchen table or the<br/>
living room. Our kids&#39; bedrooms don&#39;t have space for desks since they<br/>
are doubled up with beds and dressers (the bedrooms are tiny).<br/>
<br/>
So what is happening is that there is conflict over TV - turning it<br/>
off, when it can be on and so on. The X box is not a problem since<br/>
there is no laugh track of talking. But TV? It&#39;s on a lot and it&#39;s<br/>
very distracting.<br/>
<br/>
And we have the difficulty of schedules. Some kids need TV as downtime<br/>
after school while the other is just getting ready to sit down to study.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas I&#39;m not thinking of for making TV not a source of tension<br/>
and not so dominating?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546174213">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if headphones would do the trick? I think they have wireless headphones, so no one is stuck to a cord &lt;g&gt;. Hope you find a solution that works for you! Tess<br/>

Could you move the TV to your bedroom or the set up a cozy corner in the<br/>
basement or something?<br/>

sure sells them.<br/>
<br/>
There are also splitters (also at Radio Shack) so you can plug two  <br/>
headphones into the one jack. My thinking might be musty on this but  <br/>
I think that would split the signal strength in half so you&#39;d need  <br/>
headphones you could turn the volume up on. Anyway that&#39;d be  <br/>
something to check before you buy a splitter<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734907730">Wireless headphones... that&#39;s worth looking into. We can&#39;t move it to<br/>
the bedroom since we already have a smaller TV up there (but the<br/>
DVR&#39;ed shows are my dh&#39;s and he doesn&#39;t want the kids adding thereis -<br/>
takes up too much space). So not workable.<br/>
<br/>
Basement is not finished and is freezing in winter so no go there.<br/>
<br/>
Will look into headphones.<br/>
