&gt;Schools ARE leaving us alone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I beg to differ. IMO it is highly dependent on the area. Even here, in <br/>
supposedly liberal WA state, I have friends who have just in the past year <br/>
been harrassed, lied to, and threatened by the school district. The <br/>
overzealous nature with the belief that all children must fit into the same <br/>
mold was evident by the incidents that went on.What you state may hold true <br/>
for your area, but it does not change how it is for many others in many areas.<br/>
