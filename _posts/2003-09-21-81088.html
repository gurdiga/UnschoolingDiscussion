<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891966208">Lexie is lying in bed, talking.  She says, in a very disgusted tone of <br/>
voice, &quot;oh, now I must do my homework.&quot;  I don&#39;t say anything and she <br/>
continues &quot;I have to read four chapters in this book, before I go to <br/>
sleep, four whole chapters.&quot;  I kinda &quot;hmmm&quot; to her and she goes on with <br/>
this crabbing about her homework until I&#39;m about to crack up.  Finally I <br/>
can&#39;t take it any longer, and I fall for her trap.  &quot;Homework, Lexie, <br/>
who has given you homework?&quot;  She sighs heavily and says &quot;my teacher.&quot;  <br/>
I laugh and say &quot;your teacher?  What do you mean your teacher.&quot;   She <br/>
cracks up and says &quot;Yes, ME!  I&#39;m my teacher and I gave myself homework <br/>
but now I&#39;ve decided I don&#39;t have to do it anymore!  I&#39;m going to go to <br/>
sleep instead.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
silly girl.<br/>
