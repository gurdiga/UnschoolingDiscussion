<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362836614">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading stuff on Ralph Nader.  It&#39;s quite different than Gore<br/>
or Bush or Bore or Gush.   He&#39;s predicted to get 15% of the vote in<br/>
Alaska.  He&#39;s bringing out some important issues.  Nader is from the<br/>
Green Party.  I have no idea of his stand on homeschooling.  His running<br/>
mate is a Native American gal from a Minnesota Indian Reservation.  The<br/>
problem with a third party in this election is that mostly only<br/>
Republicans and Democrats have a chance.  Next Tues. at our<br/>
homeschooling meeting we will be discussing the upcoming election.<br/>
