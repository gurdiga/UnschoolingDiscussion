Some contend, in poetry, that the mind is dangerous and should be <br/>
left out. Well, the mind is dangerous and should be left in. ~~ <br/>

<br/>
GOOD-BYE<br/>
<br/>
This is the most difficult part of this month&#39;s newsletter to write, <br/>
because this is my &quot;good-bye&quot; as the editor of HEM&#39;s Online News. My <br/>
first newsletter was the April, 1999 issue only four short years ago. <br/>
During those four years I&#39;ve learned a lot just by surfing the <br/>
Internet to find the best websites and resources to pass on to you. <br/>
But more than that, I&#39;ve been blessed to write for some of the <br/>
kindest, most complimentary subscribers an editor could hope for. OK, <br/>
and a few people who thought I missed the mark every now and then. <br/>
:-) I&#39;ve appreciated and treasured every email I&#39;ve received, and I <br/>
thank all of you who wrote and told me your stories and your <br/>
opinions. Thank you for reading and sharing the joys of homeschooling <br/>
with me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not leaving HEM though. I&#39;ll still write the Ask Carol column for <br/>
every issue of Home Education Magazine, and last fall I took over as <br/>
articles editor. So instead of websites, excerpts and resource <br/>
recommendations, I&#39;ll be bringing you the best homeschooling articles <br/>
you&#39;ll find in any magazine. If you ever want to get in touch, you <br/>
can email me at HEM-articles@ home-ed-magazine.com.<br/>
<br/>
Shay Seaborne will take over as editor with the April issue. Shay is <br/>
an experienced editor and writer who will keep you entertained and <br/>
informed every month in her own special way. Welcome, Shay!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading!  ~~ Carol Narigon ~~<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
CIRCLES<br/>
http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/202.html<br/>
<br/>
Love seems like the best of all reasons for homeschooling. Not the <br/>
only reason, of course--there are as many different reasons as there <br/>
are children to be homeschooled--but the love a parent feels for his <br/>
children ensures a desire to keep those children from harm&#39;s way, to <br/>
protect and defend them from any perceived dangers, whether physical, <br/>
emotional, or bureaucratic. The experts might not understand it, and <br/>
might in fact even disagree, but parents have the right--indeed, they <br/>
have the responsibility--to intervene when their children need help, <br/>
protection, or assistance in finding another way.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of parents have started down the path toward homeschooling <br/>
by doing nothing more than acting on their love for their children. <br/>
Mark has often said all you need to homeschool successfully is love <br/>
and a library card, and the library card is optional. Listen to your <br/>
heart and trust yourself, and trust your children.<br/>
<br/>
When my children were small I remember sometimes sitting and just <br/>
watching them be children, playing or scuffling or reading or <br/>
sleeping, and my heart would just ache to see how quickly they were <br/>
growing up, mastering the mechanics of life, racing through childhood <br/>
to take their own place as parents. I watch our sons now with their <br/>
own young children and I see that same light of love, that <br/>
bittersweet knowledge that the days of childhood are so special, so <br/>
altogether fleeting and short.<br/>
<br/>
Babies grow so quickly into toddlers, and toddlers grow into young <br/>
children, who will be stretching into teenagers before you know it. <br/>
The hours and days and years we&#39;re given to spend with them are so <br/>
few, so very small a piece of one&#39;s lifetime. And yet schooling <br/>
easily consumes the bulk of childhood: Five to six hours per day or <br/>
more, five days a week, for three-quarters of each year, for twelve <br/>
long years. So much of a child&#39;s time; so much of a parent&#39;s rightful <br/>
joy.   ~~ HEM managing editor Helen Hegener in the brand-new <br/>
March/April issue of Home Education Magazine ~~<br/>
<br/>
You can read the rest of this article, as well as a couple other <br/>
articles and columns from the current HEM at the address above, but <br/>
you&#39;ll have to get the magazine--the one you hold in your hands--to <br/>
read them all! See special subscription information in this <br/>
newsletter, or visit your local bookseller to get your copy today.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
EXTRACTING DNA<br/>
<br/>
In February our thoughts turn to science and our homeschool group&#39;s <br/>
annual science fair. This year the project my daughter and I did was <br/>
so much fun I just had to share it with you. Believe it or not, we <br/>
extracted DNA from her cells and from wheat germ. Although the <br/>
science fair is over, we intend to tease out DNA from onions and <br/>
yeast as well.<br/>
<br/>
Who would have thought you could do that in your own kitchen? It <br/>
wasn&#39;t as hard as it sounds, and you may have everything you need <br/>
already in your kitchen cupboards. Even kids as young as 6 can <br/>
probably do this with lots of help from you. Here are some of the <br/>
websites we used:<br/>
http://gslc.genetics.utah.edu/units/activities/extraction<br/>
http://www.nal.usda.gov/bic/Education_res/protocols/onion.extract.html<br/>
http://www.onlyinternet.net/preceptor/rm118/downloading%20files/dna.doc<br/>
http://gslc.genetics.utah.edu/units/activities/wheatgerm<br/>
<br/>
Although most sites call for beakers and test tubes, we made do with <br/>
what we had-glass measuring cups and spoons and small jars. We did <br/>
get some ethyl alcohol at the pharmacy, but had good luck with <br/>
regular rubbing alcohol as well. Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
ASK CAROL<br/>
<br/>
In addition to editing this newsletter, I write a column for Home <br/>
Education Magazine. Now, I don&#39;t want to take Dear Abby&#39;s place, but <br/>
I will take those thorny questions and problems you struggle with and <br/>
try to give you some options or information that might help you. <br/>
Although I don&#39;t answer the questions in this newsletter (this month <br/>
is an exception), I do answer them in every issue of HEM, the <br/>
original print version where homeschoolers have found support for <br/>
over 20 years. A couple of them are online <br/>
(http://www.home-ed-magazine.com), but most you have to read in the <br/>
magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you <br/>
think your question is too stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has <br/>
your particular problem (probably not true). So, don&#39;t be shy; don&#39;t <br/>
procrastinate; send me your questions. I even have a special email <br/>
address: askcarol@... . Of course, I don&#39;t promise I <br/>
can answer every question in the magazine (especially if you don&#39;t <br/>
send one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use it for a <br/>
column or not. Don&#39;t wait! (~ CN ~)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
Beginning unschoolers need to REALLY be with their kids, a lot. <br/>
Letting a month or a year go by thinking that after that time you&#39;ll <br/>
REALLY concentrate on unschooling can lead to discouragement on the <br/>
part of everyone concerned, and until the parents really see and <br/>
believe how natural learning works, they&#39;re in danger of throwing in <br/>
structure to appease their internal fears.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;What? I have to spend six hours a day being an <br/>
unschooling mom?&quot; I think no, the answer is you have to spend twenty <br/>
four hours a day being an unschooling mom.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not going to take LESS time and energy to have kids home instead <br/>
of in school. The energy is different, and that&#39;s good. The energy is <br/>
less on someone else&#39;s schedule (few to none of those panicky <br/>
mornings when forms weren&#39;t signed, fees aren&#39;t available, lunch <br/>
isn&#39;t made, socks aren&#39;t clean, bus is coming), but the kids still <br/>
have the same amount of time in their days and if they&#39;re to spend it <br/>
staying out of the way of a housecleaning mom, it&#39;s possible, in some <br/>
cases, that they&#39;d be better off in school.<br/>
<br/>
When there&#39;s only one child, I think the moms should put some extra <br/>
energy into finding play partners, other families with kids, trading <br/>
out trips to little parks with playgrounds, or SOMETHING to keep from <br/>
being their child&#39;s sole source of entertainment. Unless it&#39;s in the <br/>
child&#39;s personality and the mom&#39;s too that they&#39;re quite sufficiently <br/>
enough for each other week after week. It does happen. It didn&#39;t <br/>
happen with me and Kirby. He wanted to see OTHER people&#39;s stuff and <br/>
other people&#39;s houses and other people&#39;s dogs and cats and cars. ~~ <br/>

ONLINE LEARNING<br/>
www.WorldWideLearn.com<br/>
<br/>
World Wide Learn claims to be the largest online directory for online <br/>
education. I believe it. Divided into 155 subject areas, this site <br/>
contains links to hundreds (maybe thousands) of places where you can <br/>
take classes online. I found many that were free; others require a <br/>
fee, but you can sometimes receive a discount if you take a for-fee <br/>
class through the World  Wide Learn website. You can choose from <br/>
online degree programs, business and training courses, single classes <br/>
and continuing education programs. If you&#39;re interested in learning <br/>
something new, why not give this site a glance.<br/>
<br/>

NHEN ADVOCACY REPORT<br/>
www.nhen.org<br/>
<br/>
The NHEN Advocacy Report informs the homeschooling community about <br/>
any legal/legislative networking by NHEN members as well as sharing <br/>
topics that are being discussed on the busy NHEN-Legislative <br/>
yahoogroup list. The newsletter is published monthly, but more <br/>
frequently if events warrant. Read the current issue of the NHEN <br/>
Advocacy Report posted in the Legal/Legislative section at <br/>

<br/>
THE MEGAPENNY PROJECT<br/>
http://www.kokogiak.com/megapenny<br/>
<br/>
Ever wonder what a thousand pennies looks like? OK, you&#39;ve got that <br/>
many in a jar under your bed, right? How about a million pennies? A <br/>
billion? A quadrillion? The MegaPenny Project attempts to give you <br/>
some perspective on the many penny situation. In addition to a visual <br/>
model, they give you height, weight, value and area. Next time your <br/>
curious child asks how many a million is, this is a site where you <br/>
can try to get a grasp of large amounts of small copper disks.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>

<br/>
NATIONAL WHAT MONTH?<br/>
<br/>
Most people know this is Women&#39;s History Month. One of the best <br/>
websites for links and resources is the National Women&#39;s History <br/>
Project site at http://www.nwhp.org/tlp/links/links.html. For more <br/>
information, check out the women&#39;s history page at about.com at <br/>
http://womenshistory.about.com.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t stop with women&#39;s history, though. Did you know March is also <br/>
Irish-American Heritage Month? You can learn a lot at Conrad Bladey&#39;s <br/>
Irish Studies Pages, where you&#39;ll find stories, folklore, <br/>
biographies, music and crafts.<br/>
http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~bj333/HomePage.home.html#Main<br/>
<br/>
Looking for more unusual topics for the month? How about National <br/>
Frozen Food Month (I&#39;d celebrate with ice cream), National Craft <br/>
Month (http://www.i-craft.com), Optimism Month (for those who believe <br/>
spring will finally come), National Umbrella Month (you&#39;ll need one <br/>
if spring ever comes and Play-The-Recorder Month <br/>
(http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/recorder). For more unusual <br/>
observances, both monthly and daily, check out <br/>

<br/>
EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE<br/>
www.equipped.org<br/>
<br/>
Survival is on a lot of people&#39;s minds right now. Here&#39;s an excellent <br/>
website with information on surviving all kinds of situations. The <br/>
editor of the website has this to say about it:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Equipped To Survive Web site provides an excellent resource for <br/>
children and adults on the subject of survival in wilderness, marine, <br/>
and aviation environments.  It is used regularly by students <br/>
researching school assignments, by teachers assigning projects and <br/>
homework and by homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
The site also includes a special section for children, &quot;Survival For <br/>
Kids,&quot; (http://www.equipped.org/kidsrvl.htm) that provides <br/>
potentially lifesaving survival information written especially for <br/>
children K-8 and their parents. The Web site is supported by the <br/>
non-profit Equipped To Survive Foundation.&quot;<br/>
