<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947703512">&quot;Second, my kids are old enough to not be wetting the bed. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I reacted very strongly to this. I really hope for your children&#39;s <br/>
sake that you aren&#39;t telling them this. It&#39;s hard enough to deal <br/>
with wetting the bed, without any added stress from adults that <br/>
think you&#39;re too old for it.<br/>
<br/>
One of my children is well past that age and still has accidents. My <br/>
8y.o. only this year started staying dry.<br/>
So I&#39;ve had one that started staying dry around 5, one around 8.5, <br/>
one around 12 and one that stopped the day he used a toilet, at <br/>
3y.o.!! Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
A body develops in it&#39;s own way and time, not according to some pre-<br/>
set schedule. Many times, a child that wets the bed, is not making <br/>
enough of the hormone that slows down urine production at night. The <br/>
only &quot;cure&quot; is to wait....the body will grow and begin to develop <br/>
more of that hormone later.<br/>
Sometimes bladders are too small, sometimes kids don&#39;t make enough <br/>
of the hormone that wakes you up when your bladder is full. All of <br/>
these simply take TIME and growth.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, you can support what is already a difficult thing <br/>
for them, by buying large pull-ups or laying something under the <br/>
sheet and not making any comments about their age in relation to <br/>
bedwetting. <br/>
<br/>
Sierra just told me to tell you &quot;help them and say &#39;sorry you wet <br/>
your bed&#39;&quot;:) Wisdom from my 8 y.o. that just started staying dry and <br/>
doesn&#39;t mind me sharing that.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the cleanup, I use a natural all-purpose cleanser (I make <br/>
myself) that is a mix of borax, water and Dr. Bronners soap. I&#39;ve <br/>
used it for beds, floor stains, walls, bathrooms etc... and it seems <br/>
to work really well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654510492">&quot;Long term waking a child to pee<br/>
can lead to bedwetting persisting in to adulthood.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know, when one of my kids was really frustrated over not being <br/>
able to stay dry, we talked to the pediatrician about it, for ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
One of her bits of &quot;wisdom&quot; was to wake him up in the middle of the <br/>
night to go pee. I explained that he was an extremely deep sleeper <br/>
and it probably wasn&#39;t worth the agony...she stood by her advice so <br/>
I finally decided to try it.<br/>
We tried ONCE. It was a nightmare. He would literally start falling <br/>
asleep while I held him up, it was such a struggle. I remember <br/>
tucking him back in and deciding at that moment that I would never <br/>
try to take him pee while he was asleep again!! Terrible advice.<br/>
I figured a peaceful sleep was more important than staying dry and I <br/>
just kept buying him really good pullups and waiting.<br/>
<br/>
Darn pediatrician!<br/>

NEVER in any way shamed any of my kids for bed wetting.  EVER!!  I think<br/>
that is wrong and cruel.  I thought they were old enough, but it is very<br/>
obvious that they are not.  We don&#39;t let anyone shame them.  I did want to<br/>
put that out for you to know though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475888413">I guess it depends on the child.<br/>
<br/>
I posted in another post that we used an alarm and it woke *us* up, and then we woke my son up, and got him to the bathroom half asleep or maybe all asleep LOL.<br/>
<br/>
But it worked within a week, I think in about 3 days actually.  He has never wet the bed since then.  And it wasn&#39;t a nightmare.  It was just a simple get him up, walk him across the house to the bathroom, let him go, and then walk him back to his room.<br/>
<br/>
He was 8 years old at the time though I think.  Maybe being older made it easier.  I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Had it been a nightmare experience though, I agree....forget it and just get a peaceful nights rest!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038837256">The alarm is in the child&#39;s underpants - they&#39;re made for this  <br/>
purpose. My oldest daughter is a VERY sound sleeper - still is at 21  <br/>
years old. She was still wetting the bed every night, at 8 or 9 years  <br/>
old. This was hard on her - she REALLY didn&#39;t want to do it, but she  <br/>
slept a lot - about 12 hours per night, and she slept VERY deeply. A  <br/>
neighbor loaned us one of the little underpants alarm thingies - it  <br/>
turns out that kids often &quot;leak&quot; a little urine before they really  <br/>
let it all out. The alarm senses this moisture and sounds JUST before  <br/>
the child is about to really wet.<br/>
<br/>
Roya wore it for about a week, but it only went off one time - she  <br/>
never wet the bed again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Meaning she REALLY didn&#39;t want to wet the bed anymore. She was very  <br/>
frustrated and upset, no matter how much we told her not to worry,  <br/>
she&#39;d get over it when she was ready, etc. She was a very social kid  <br/>
- we did a lot of overnighter stuff with Girl Scouts and other  <br/>
friends. Pull-ups were brand new and not very good - she wore them,  <br/>
but they did not contain the flood at all. I had 2 younger kids  both  <br/>
out of diapers and dry at night. She was EAGER to try the alarm  <br/>
thingie - we fooled with it during the day to see how much moisture  <br/>
it took to set it off (not much) and so she was familiar with what it  <br/>
would feel like and sound like. That first night, it went off, she  <br/>
woke up and got up and went to the bathroom. She was SO happy to get  <br/>
back into her DRY bed! Then that was it - I know it sounds strange  <br/>
but she never wet the bed again - the alarm never went off after that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678211745">i guess then that it&#39;s usefulness depends on at least these factors...a) <br/>
the child is ok with using the device and there&#39;s no shaming/coercing in <br/>
it&#39;s use, b) the child&#39;s bedwetting is caused by the fact that they <br/>
sleep too deeply to wake if they need to go to the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
i wet the bed as a child, until i was 9 or so.  my parents put me <br/>
through hell about it.  they thought i was being willful, they openly <br/>
resented the mess and being woken up in the middle of the night, etc.  <br/>
by the time i was 5 or 6, they decided that the bribing and reward <br/>
charts and threats and forcing me to sleep in my mess wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
work afterall, so they started to take me to medical specialists.  i had <br/>
many, many invasive procedures performed on me without my consent and <br/>
with no explanation...i was on round after round of several different <br/>
types of drugs (some with very strong side effects and terrible flavors <br/>
that made me vomit.)  still, nothing changed for the better.<br/>
<br/>
when i was 8, they bought *the alarm*.  it was NOT something i wanted to <br/>
do.  it was humiliating to me to have to strap something into my <br/>
underwear connected to a wire that i got tangled in...and that&#39;s <br/>
speaking NOTHING of the large, cumbersome box on my wrist.  i was even <br/>
afraid that it might electricute me.  it didn&#39;t help me.<br/>
<br/>
by the time i finally stopped wetting the bed (and it was a sudden sort <br/>
of occurance!), my final documentation from the doctor was that i just <br/>
had an immature bladder.   i needed time to grow out of it.  mind you, i <br/>
didn&#39;t get a chance to see these papers until last year, so i never even <br/>
knew this.  they didn&#39;t bother to tell me that i wasn&#39;t a freak of <br/>
nature...i just had a slow growing bladder, and more than that, a lot of <br/>
children besides me did too.<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t know how long my parents forced me to wear that darned <br/>
thing...but many years later, i found it in some things packed up when <br/>
helping my mother move and it brought all sorts of emotions back for <br/>
me.  my husband handed me a hammer and suggested i smash the hell out of <br/>
it.  i did, and BOY...that felt good. :)<br/>
<br/>
so anyways...that&#39;s MY story.  i thought i would put out that <br/>
perspective for anyone who may have thought that the *alarm* idea might <br/>
help.  not to counter the positive stories, just to give another <br/>
experience and outcome.<br/>
<br/>
my son (5 1/2) is still not dry at night.  it&#39;s an easy thing for me to <br/>
not get worked up about because i know what it&#39;s like to not be able to <br/>
control it.  it&#39;s not because it doesn&#39;t annoy me...lol.  but because my <br/>
annoyance is so much less important than his feeling at peace with where <br/>
his body&#39;s at.  it&#39;s hard enough for him to be wearing *diapers*, i <br/>
don&#39;t need to add any more negative energy to the experience.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for listening...<br/>

alarm from the kid down the street, not from me. SHE brought it up  <br/>
and told me to ask Nick&#39;s mom about it. When I did ask, Nick&#39;s mom  <br/>
loaned me theirs. Roya was enthusiastic about the idea - kind of  <br/>
fascinated with the whole thing. I would not have initiated this, I  <br/>
don&#39;t think. I wasn&#39;t worrying about her bedwetting - but she wasn&#39;t  <br/>
happy about it. My younger sister went through what Lisa described  <br/>
with the multiple medical exams and all the pain and fear. My parents  <br/>
were very very kind and gentle people - they didn&#39;t shame her, but  <br/>
they were sure there was some medical problem. It was really awful  <br/>
for her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not recommending that parents use an alarm on their kids. But for  <br/>
a kid who wets the bed because of sleeping really soundly, it might  <br/>
be something the kid wants to try out.<br/>

I don&#39;t remember why we decided to use the alarm.  I think we had been using pullups, which worked fine...but I think he wanted to be dry because of sleepovers and such. <br/>

We never shamed our son.  It was just something we tried just like we tried pullups.  There were no medical tests involved, mabye because I&#39;m a nurse and I knew better (and I myself was traumatized by invasive medical stuff when I was little).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887181193"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yeah it is, if it was just an alarm clock set for some arbitrary  <br/>
&gt; time, and then they went and woke the kid up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But it wasn&#39;t an arbitrary time with an alarm clock, it was an alarm <br/>
that went off when the child wet the bed. Enuresis alarms are a very <br/>
effective treatment if the child wants to use one. Not waking when <br/>
the alarm goes off is quite common and often parents have to be <br/>
supportive and help wake the child up.<br/>
<br/>
Bedwetting is technically called nocturnal enuresis over here (UK).<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally there is a big difference between primary nocturnal <br/>
enuresis which is where the person has always had a problem being <br/>
dry at night and secondary nocturnal enuresis where a person has <br/>
been dry for some time and then starts to be wet at night. Primary <br/>
is primarily developmental/maturational and will usually stop by the <br/>
time a person reaches puberty, alarms can help. With secondary <br/>
enuresis there is usually an emotional/psychological cause, or <br/>
sometimes an illness, so secondary is more cause for concern than <br/>
primary.<br/>
<br/>
Waking when an enuresis alarm goes off has a different effect from <br/>
just waking a child to take them to the loo. What I was trying <br/>
initially to say was that waking or lifting a child up in the night <br/>
to take them to loo in the hope that it will prevent or stop <br/>
bedwetting will not work. In fact it can have a negative effect and <br/>
prolong the bedwetting in to adult hood.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants a bed alarm as they want to stop wetting the bed <br/>
and parent wakes them as the child doesn&#39;t hear the alarm has a <br/>
different effect from arbitrary waking. <br/>
<br/>
Got these stats below off a UK enuresis support site. This is an <br/>
amazingly common problem. <br/>
<br/>
Bedwetting often runs in families and affects over half a million <br/>
children between the ages of 6 and 16 in the UK. So your children <br/>
are by no means isolated. In fact, according to surveys taken in <br/>
Great Britain, Holland, New Zealand and Ireland in 1998, the number <br/>
of children who regularly wet the bed average: <br/>
1 in 6 five year olds <br/>
1 in 7 seven year olds <br/>
1 in 11 nine year olds <br/>
1 in 50-100 fifteen year olds and older [including adults] <br/>
