The reason we can&#39;t use those links is the archive is for members of the <br/>
group only and you have to go to yahoogroups and say the password.<br/>
<br/>
But I was just looking at the photos again, with the two new ones, Joanne&#39;s <br/>
and Reenie&#39;s, and some of the older ones.  And the light coming out of a <br/>
bunch of those kids, and the relaxed faces of the moms reminds me of how lots <br/>
of the families I see are NOT.  <br/>
<br/>
There are the faces of kids who don&#39;t have to wake up at 6:00 a.m. to get <br/>
ready to get on a bus.  There are the faces of moms who aren&#39;t forcing kids <br/>
to finish homework before they can read for fun, or play.  There are the <br/>
faces of a bunch of dads who know their kids on a daily basis, not just <br/>
weekends or report card days.  There are parents who can see their kids <br/>
dance, or sing, or demonstrate this&#39;or&#39;that without waiting for the school <br/>
concert or science fair.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby heard a schoolbell up close for the first time when he was thirteen.<br/>
<br/>
Marty will be surprised, when we go to the Japanese drumming performance <br/>
later this month, that we&#39;ll have to line up to go into the theatre, and be <br/>
dismissed &quot;by class.&quot;  That&#39;s never happened to him.   He&#39;s thirteen.  He&#39;s <br/>
going to laugh.  (Holly and I went to one of the shows in this series last <br/>
week, and it was TOTALLY a performance for schools.  So we were with <br/>
Tumbleweeds homeschool group, and the dismissals started in this order:  a <br/>
high school group, probably the drama group; Monte Vista elementary, because <br/>
they&#39;re two blocks from the university and the kids would have been walking, <br/>
not getting on a bus; then us, then another homeschooling group.  So they <br/>
called our &quot;school&quot; and we filed out from the rows they had told us to file <br/>
into.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing those photos, and I hope we&#39;ll get to see more as others <br/>
here get to scanners, or join the group, or find just the coolest photo of <br/>
their family.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for being here.<br/>
