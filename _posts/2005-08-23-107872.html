<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381838988">I would like to explore the notion of judgment in the context of an <br/>
Unschooling lifestyle and as Unschooling parents. The AU list is having <br/>
a bit of a debate again, and I&#39;d like, for my part, to bring it to a <br/>
larger forum--I&#39;m also posting at Unschooling.info under the &quot;parenting&quot; <br/>
folder. I know part of this is problematic because it&#39;s not technically <br/>
an Unschooling issue when children are under 5 (that&#39;s mandatory school <br/>
age where I live). But, taken in the context of an Unschooling lifestyle <br/>
and factoring in age-appropriate expectations, I see the issue on a <br/>
continuum about whether or not judgment is useful or possible when <br/>
relationships are the priority.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, there is agreement that undesirable behavior is most <br/>
often an expression of an unmet need--whether he&#39;s hungry, feeling <br/>
ignored, whatever--agreement on the priority being to meet the <br/>
underlying need. The questions arise over whether to address the <br/>
*expression* of the need, whether to judge the *method* of meeting the <br/>
need, whether it is useful for a parent to *label* the behavior or the <br/>
choice in a particular instance as worse and whether to discuss better <br/>
possible choices in future similar situations.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, is it productive parenting/ useful in an Unschooling <br/>
context to discuss choices on a better-worse continuum and help our <br/>
children find better tools to use in place of worse ones, or is any form <br/>
of judgment better/ worse likely to undermine trust, relationships and <br/>
communication?<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the things I&#39;ve written on the topic fwiw...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I believe the best approach is a two pronged effort where we focus on <br/>
the need behind the behavior as well as offering important information <br/>
and feedback as to the behavior as a choice of expression. People do <br/>
have a choice in how they express themselves and there are better and <br/>
worse ways to do that--better and worse in terms of Respect for the <br/>
other person, but also better and worse in terms of achieving a goal, <br/>
both of which I think need to be talked about. I think problems arise <br/>
with focusing exclusively on the behavior OR exclusively on the need.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree that this discussion is not always best done in the <br/>
moment though there are times when it is and can be, at least, briefly <br/>
addressed. It&#39;s a delicate, situational balance that I try to strike. <br/>
But I truly believe that the discussion *needs* to happen at some point, <br/>
if not in the moment or as an immediate follow-up, then as a revisiting <br/>
(later in the day or week) or a reapplication (as in taking something <br/>
they can easily see in a tv show, for instance, and helping them apply <br/>
it to a recent incident in their own life). There are times when not <br/>
offering information as the opportunity naturally occurs, robs our <br/>
children of the chance to learn from life. I&#39;m not saying anything <br/>
remotely close to offering etiquette lessons. I&#39;m talking about genuine <br/>
feedback as to our reactions, potential general reactions of others <br/>
outside the home, etc.&quot;<br/>
*****<br/>
&quot;For me, it becomes a matter of looking past the behavior to the need <br/>
and the choice. In other words, instead of seeing a &quot;misbehaving&quot; child, <br/>
where the focus is on the behavior itself, we see a needy child who made <br/>
a poor choice. By seeing the need and the choice, we are able to address <br/>
both while still seeing the Whole Child, free of labels. By seeing the <br/>
choice, we keep the behavior within the moment rather than extrapolating <br/>
it to include most moments or a way of being. But, most importantly, we <br/>
empower the child to make a better choice the next time they face that <br/>
need, which empowers them to live in a world with other people.&quot;<br/>
*****<br/>
&quot;I have three children *very* close in age--who all are in similar <br/>
developmental stages in terms of empathy, etc. I cannot, personally, <br/>
imagine what my house would look like if we didn&#39;t talk about choices, <br/>
if we didn&#39;t brainstorm together more successful--i.e better--ways to <br/>
get our needs met. This has been a crucial step for us in understanding <br/>
each other and living together. So, it&#39;s difficult for me to see life <br/>
without voicing the &quot;hitting hurts&quot; or &quot;I felt sad when you called me <br/>
x.&quot; As I said in my book discussion post, I can see many of Rosenberg&#39;s <br/>
points about communication, but they are so wordy and involve so many <br/>
steps that I can&#39;t see them working for problem solving amongst many <br/>
small children, though I do find *myself* acting as interpreter of needs <br/>
after such statements as &quot;I felt sad when you called me x.&quot; I do those <br/>
extra steps, hoping that my children will someday be able to do them for <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s possible to talk about an array of choices. I think it&#39;s <br/>
possible and even beneficial to talk about them in terms of better <br/>
choices and worse choices. I&#39;m very interested in this, and I&#39;m going to <br/>
open it up personally (without references to others here) to the UD list <br/>
because I would like to hear a wider range of voices for my own personal <br/>
growth.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Someone sent me something a while back that was good (good meaning I judged <br/>
it good; good meaning I agreed with it &lt;bwg&gt;) parenting <br/>
discussion/advice/summary, and I was liking reading it, but near the end it said (to <br/>
whichever/whoever it was aimed at) not to worry about what other people thought about your <br/>
child.     That was NOT (in my judgment good).<br/>
<br/>
I was planning to come here and figure out how to bring that up.   Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
not what Danielle&#39;s after discussing and maybe it is.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In other words, is it productive parenting/ useful in an Unschooling<br/>
context to discuss choices on a better-worse continuum and help our<br/>
children find better tools to use in place of worse ones...-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think YES, absolutely and unquestionably yes.   <br/>
To do otherwise is cruel.<br/>
<br/>
If you were hosting a visitor from a very different culture who didn&#39;t know <br/>
how to shake hands or otherwise greet people, would you   not advise him?   If <br/>
your visitor had NO IDEA of table manners, wouldn&#39;t you point out what was <br/>
better and what was REALLY unacceptable?     (And if you went to his native place <br/>
and ate with his grandmother, woudln&#39;t it be WAY kinder of him to brief you <br/>
beforehand of what is truly offensive table behavior that might be no big deal <br/>
here?)<br/>
<br/>
-=-... or is any form<br/>
of judgment better/ worse likely to undermine trust, relationships and<br/>
communication?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did someone actually recommend that?   That being (somehow, falsely, <br/>
infuriatingly) &quot;non judgmental&quot; could in ANY way increase trust?   Strengthen <br/>
relationships.   AID COMMUNICATION!???<br/>
What&#39;s there to communicate if there&#39;s no discussion of one thing being <br/>
better or worse than another?   If there are no ideals, no joys, no successes, no <br/>
excitements over accomplishment, what&#39;s there to talk about?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think problems arise<br/>
with focusing exclusively on the behavior OR exclusively on the need.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Balance.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the answer.   <br/>
Some people withhold what the child needs as punishment for bad approach, for <br/>
being demanding or grasping or whatever.    Some people give the child the <br/>
thing no matter how he got it, and just look away contentedly.    Neither is <br/>
good for relationships or trust or communications.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
I totally agree that this discussion is not always best done in the<br/>
moment though there are times when it is and can be, at least, briefly<br/>
addressed.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depending how strong the problem is and whether someone in the room has been <br/>
harmed (psychically, at least &lt;g&gt;), I might just let it go altogether until <br/>
we&#39;re on the way home or something, but there are some things I would even say <br/>
to an adult, and when a kid is old enough to understand hints or sarcasm or <br/>
humor, I might drop a clue in the presence of the others.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There are times when not<br/>
offering information as the opportunity naturally occurs, robs our<br/>
children of the chance to learn from life.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.    Some parents don&#39;t have much interpersonal skill or awareness, <br/>
though, and what can be done in such cases?   When cluelessness has a genetic <br/>
component too, THEN what?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m not saying anything remotely close to offering etiquette lessons.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can something be &quot;remotely close&quot;?   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
If so, I have very often offered something remotely close to etiquette <br/>
lessons. <br/>
<br/>
--When Kirby and Marty went to their first funeral (and I wasn&#39;t going with <br/>
them), I briefed them on funeral etiquette, what to expect, what they   might <br/>
say to the nearest older relatives (their friend&#39;s mom died).     <br/>
<br/>
--When Holly went to a mixed overnighter recently and had been told there <br/>
would be three other girls there, I asked her if she wanted motherly advice.   <br/>
She said &quot;If you feel like giving me some, I&#39;m willing to listen.&quot;   We were in <br/>
the car on the way, me her and Keith.   She had known the host family (two <br/>
boys her age) for many years, and I told her she might not want to press that <br/>
point right off, but get to know the girls first.   All we knew was they were <br/>
girls from two different middle schools.   I told her briefly that it would be <br/>
good for her to show some interest in the girls themselves separate from their <br/>
friendships with the boys.   She was really listening, because she understood <br/>
there might be some kind of schoolgirl thing she might have missed out on.<br/>
<br/>
--Holly came home the other night and told me she felt bad because she had <br/>
embarrassed a boy.   She saw her name written on his jeans and said &quot;Why is my <br/>
name on your jeans?&quot;   He made a joke about it being &quot;a typo for &#39;holey,&#39; that <br/>
he had misspelled it, but she realized she had put him on the spot and wished <br/>
she hadn&#39;t later.   We discussed how she might have gotten out of it or put <br/>
him more at ease.   She wished really she just hadn&#39;t mentioned it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
I think it&#39;s possible to talk about an array of choices.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Like The Terminator&#39;s pull-down menu. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
That&#39;s been a good model for me over the years as I&#39;ve worked to become a <br/>
more understanding mom.   Kids are familiar with the model from video games like <br/>
Harvest Moon and Knights of the Old Republic, where there are dialog options <br/>
from short lists, and your choice affects the next move.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I think it&#39;s<br/>
possible and even beneficial to talk about them in terms of better<br/>
choices and worse choices.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I really should transcribe the Peaceful Parenting tape.   I am SO USED to cut <br/>
and paste that things not cut-and-pasteable irritate me now. &lt;g&gt;   &quot;Make the <br/>
better choice&quot; is central to what I said there about people gradually becoming <br/>
the parents they can be, and NOBODY can aim straight to &quot;the right choice&quot; <br/>
because there are so many other variables all the time.      But just because <br/>
there&#39;s   no one single right choice does not even &quot;remotely approach&quot; saying <br/>
that there are no horribly wrong choices.   There are tons of those.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s exactly the context in which I put it--probably from <br/>
reading around a lot here over the years. Here&#39;s my whole post:<br/>
******&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to articulate this for a while, <br/>
and this seems like a window to me.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the best approach is a two pronged effort where we focus on <br/>
the need behind the behavior as well as offering important information <br/>
and feedback as to the behavior as a choice of expression. People do <br/>
have a choice in how they express themselves and there are better and <br/>
worse ways to do that--better and worse in terms of Respect for the <br/>

both of which I think need to be talked about. I think problems arise <br/>
with focusing exclusively on the behavior OR exclusively on the need.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree that this discussion is not always best done in the <br/>
moment though there are times when it is and can be, at least, briefly <br/>
addressed. It&#39;s a delicate, situational balance that I try to strike. <br/>
But I truly believe that the discussion *needs* to happen at some point, <br/>
if not in the moment or as an immediate follow-up, then as a revisiting <br/>
(later in the day or week) or a reapplication (as in taking something <br/>

it to a recent incident in their own life). There are times when not <br/>
offering information as the opportunity naturally occurs, robs our <br/>
children of the chance to learn from life. I&#39;m not saying anything <br/>
remotely close to offering etiquette lessons. I&#39;m talking about genuine <br/>
feedback as to our reactions, potential general reactions of others <br/>
outside the home, etc.<br/>
<br/>
People have recently pointed out the problem with comparing children to <br/>
spouses, though I still think it holds up in terms of my treatment if <br/>
not their freedom of possibility in the wider world, but I think another <br/>
useful analogy, for me anyway, is the idea of a foreign traveler.<br/>
<br/>
If a person came to visit us, putting us in a position of responsibility <br/>
as their host, and we continually focused only on meeting the need <br/>
rather than discussing the choice of expressing that need, chances are <br/>
we&#39;d be doing that person a disservice. If, for instance, we focused <br/>
exclusively on the need, say operating an elevator, and we showed him <br/>
how to operate the elevator by pushing the appropriate button and giving <br/>
the corresponding numbers for the person&#39;s understanding, we would meet <br/>
the immediate need, and he&#39;d likely know how to operate future elevators <br/>
just fine. Both useful services we&#39;ve provided.<br/>
<br/>
But, if we haven&#39;t addressed the notion of personal space and tone when <br/>
asking for help--expressing his need--then the next time that visitor <br/>
has a need he will be no better equipped to consider his expression or <br/>
to express it in the circumstances in which he finds himself. If it <br/>
happens with someone less generous or understanding, he could be open to <br/>
some rather negative reactions. We wouldn&#39;t be very good hosts if we <br/>
allowed that to happen through an error of omission, in my opinion. I <br/>
see my responsibility as a parent as even greater than my responsibility <br/>
as a host. &quot;********<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did someone actually recommend that?   That being (somehow, falsely,<br/>

Rosenberg--Non-Violent Communication, and I believe that Alfie Kohn, <br/>
too, in his recent book _Unconditional Parenting_ makes the point that <br/>
it&#39;s not possible to judge the behavior without also judging the child. <br/>
So, much of this is the outgrowth of our book discussions, and several <br/>
people believe very strongly in these ideas. I, too, can see a certain <br/>
logic behind them--how blaming someone is not a good way to open <br/>
communication because it places in a position to either defend or <br/>
attack. But, I think that judgment itself can be used in productive ways <br/>
as well as non-productive ways, which is what I&#39;m trying to get at, I <br/>
guess.<br/>

100th time on why such-and-such was rude and then sending the child <br/>
away &quot;until you can be nice.&quot; It&#39;s about taking a few seconds to <br/>
remind someone that what they just did wasn&#39;t the best way to express <br/>
oneself. Now, let&#39;s reconnect and move forward. <br/>
<br/>
Being able to give and take honest, gentle feedback is a wonderful <br/>
thing to model to our kids. Yes, as the big and powerful parents, we <br/>
have to be careful not to take advantage of our strength, but I&#39;m not <br/>
too worried about unschooling parents doing that. I love to hear my <br/>
kids say to each other or to other people--kids and adults--&quot;I didn&#39;t <br/>
like it when you...&quot; and then move on. I&#39;m still learning to stand up <br/>
for myself in small ways instead of keeping it inside and then running <br/>
away when really upset. <br/>

with a number of different philosophies jumbling together and even more <br/>
questions. :)<br/>
<br/>
So, to continue... Another important part of the puzzle clicked for me <br/>
as I was laying in bed, unsuccessfully trying to turn off my brain and <br/>
fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
How do folks characterize their own mistakes?<br/>
<br/>
When I make bad choices, and that&#39;s what I call them because I believe <br/>
we can all make bad choices in the moment and better ones in the next, I <br/>
apologize to my children for making a bad choice. I acknowledge what I <br/>
could have done better, what I hope to do next time, what I wish I had <br/>
done. We&#39;re all human; we all make bad choices from time to time, but <br/>
we&#39;re one step up if we can recognize that and see how to do better.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really curious how folks apologize (assuming they do) and how they <br/>
characterize that apology if they don&#39;t pass judgment in some way on <br/>
their own actions. And if they do pass judgment on their own actions and <br/>
choices, do they believe their child(ren) picks up on that? Is there any <br/>
chance that the child may feel that reactions with them are not genuine <br/>
or authentic?  I really think my children would pick up on the dichotomy <br/>
and it would just feel wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I continue to come back to the fact that it feels disingenuous to me to <br/>
not talk about judgment.<br/>

<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s big into the non-violent communication books.   She&#39;s <br/>
talked to me about it.   It seems not genuine and not authentic.   <br/>
<br/>
For anyone to subscribe entirely to everything in ANY book is odd on several <br/>
levels.   For one thing, our culture has a history of living by one book, and <br/>
that&#39;s the Bible.   So we have a cultural history of &quot;subscription.&quot;  What are <br/>
you?   That question can be answered with &quot;a republican&quot; or &quot;a vegetarian&quot; or <br/>
whateveer.   But some books have come along and gotten followers, adherents, <br/>
etc.   It shouldn&#39;t be about a book, a single individual book.   Nobody who <br/>
loves and uses tools has just one single tool.   If they decide a handsaw is the <br/>
best tool, do they get rid of all their other tools???<br/>

do when they&#39;ve discussed the &quot;social niceties&quot; and possible results if a <br/>
different route is chosen, and the behavior doesn&#39;t change? I&#39;m not talking one <br/>
or two items, but most we discuss. Nix that-I talk about. He (6 year old) <br/>
listens and says he understands, but never asks questions-even to ask something <br/>
like, &quot;Really? That happens?&quot; or to say something like, &quot;Oh, my friends would <br/>
never treat me like that!&quot; I don&#39;t remind every time the situation comes up, but <br/>
every once in a while I will sit down and casually say something after the <br/>
fact. I&#39;ve been at the point for a while of basically giving up-that maybe <br/>
experience in the world will show him... I hate to think I&#39;m &quot;putting him through&quot; <br/>
that, and now that I&#39;ve read the above statement, I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s <br/>
something else I might do, or maybe I&#39;m taking the wrong angle or maybe not trying <br/>
enough? Its very hard for me to relate to my childhood, because I was very <br/>
controlled, and for a long time, I was a &quot;pleaser&quot;, and would do anything asked <br/>
of me-whether it was indoctrinated or forced on me from toddlerhood or if that <br/>
was just my personality, I don&#39;t know, but it definitely didn&#39;t last into the <br/>
teen years. I&#39;ve tried to raise him with confidence in himself, his choices, <br/>
his thoughts, his self-control or independence and he seems to be going along <br/>
fine with that. We are just so alike in so many ways, and yet had extremely <br/>
different-even opposite-upbrinings to this point in his life, that I cannot <br/>
relate to what he might be feeling or thinking. Any thoughts? I&#39;d appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986803146">I want to apologize for that last cross post, where I discuss moral <br/>
conviction. It was a blunder of mine that it was sent to this list. <br/>
Please, feel free to discuss my ideas, but the OP should *not* have been <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I realize it&#39;s out there now, but I&#39;d sure appreciate everyone&#39;s help <br/>
keeping my blunder as minimal as possible by not discussing the OP quoted.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! Won&#39;t happen again!<br/>
