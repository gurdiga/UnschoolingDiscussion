Princess Bride is the most like the book of any movie I&#39;ve ever seen and read <br/>
the book both.  WHAT a good job.  I was thinking just yesterday that some of <br/>
the best movies have been directed by Rob Reiner (who did Princess Bride) and <br/>
Frank Oz (Little Shop of Horrors--the musical).  Both did other things too, <br/>
of course, but those two are sterling.<br/>

Marty says he&#39;s seen the bumper sticker (where Kirby used to work).   <br/>

you have to get the Princess Bride: the Good Parts version to get a <br/>
good match - apparently the actual original book has pages and pages <br/>
of detail on everything ad nauseum. Never read either version so I <br/>
can&#39;t say for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918236491">From the Science Fiction Book Club&#39;s blurb on &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; book:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THE PRINCESS BRIDE<br/>
by William Goldman<br/>
  Member Edition: $9.99   <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; As a child, William Goldman loved hearing his father read the &quot;S.<br/>
Morgenstern classic, The Princess Bride.&quot; When he grew up and got his own<br/>
copy, however, he found that Morgenstern&#39;s story wasn&#39;t precisely the one he<br/>
recalled. Apparently his Dad had carefully omitted the boring parts as he<br/>
read. So Goldman decided to reconstruct his father&#39;s version of the tale-the<br/>
&quot;Good Parts Version&quot;... &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The boring parts were apparently lengthy genealogy recitations (which I<br/>
think sound interesting but I&#39;m not a kid). Goldman had bought the full<br/>
version, all unknowing, for his son, and was disappointed and baffled when<br/>
the son was reluctant to read it. Then he perused his son&#39;s copy and got the<br/>
shock of discovering that his dad had been skipping whole dull chunks.<br/>
<br/>
When I got my copy of the &quot;good parts version&quot; I was enthusiastic about<br/>
reading it. But then I discovered that it was almost word for word the<br/>
movie. Call me perverse! I was hoping that the book would have more - as<br/>
most movie adaptations have to leave *something* out - for time, for<br/>
enhancing the visuals, because they cast someone who looked different than<br/>
the original description - whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the movie makers did a fantastic job with the movie, including<br/>
adding the framing device that recalls Goldman&#39;s story with his dad - but if<br/>
you haven&#39;t seen it, and want to read the book, I recommend reading the book<br/>
first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056602737">It&#39;s not intimidating, it&#39;s just exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
Just to put this into context, my first teaching gig was as a high  <br/>
school teacher at the age of ... get ready .... 24. I had students  <br/>
who were months shy of 21 because as long as you don&#39;t turn 21 during  <br/>
the school year, you can go to high school in NYC til then  <br/>
because ... ahem ... you&#39;re still a minor. So I had 20 year-old women  <br/>
with 2 kids attending day high school.<br/>
<br/>
It was exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, McCourt taught a lot of people I know. And I mean, A  <br/>
LOT. Stuyvesant has always been a HUGE high school and there is  <br/>
always someone in my circles of NYC techies or artists who will say,  <br/>
yeah, he was my teacher back in ... Every one of them has something  <br/>
funny or positive to say about him as a teacher. It seems he was one  <br/>
of the few who actually cared. But, mind you, he was an English  <br/>
teacher in a Science and Tech heavy high school. So it was rough not  <br/>
only for him but for the students who adored him that were not really  <br/>
that into tech.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I think he rocks as a writer.<br/>
<br/>
Liza in NYC,<br/>
who wished he had been her English teacher;<br/>
but then he would have had to move to Puerto Rico<br/>
for that to happen.<br/>

all.&quot;<br/>

Cool.<br/>
I never researched this part of it...although the movie is a favorite<br/>
around here, one we watch a few times every year.  He&#39;s quite a brain,<br/>

Don&#39;t you think that they were there by choice, though, and therefore more  <br/>
empowered than the typical 16 year old?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe or maybe not...sometimes insurance and other benefits are tied <br/>
to being enrolled in school fulltime and if they weren&#39;t in school <br/>
fulltime they wouldn&#39;t have whatever it is they are needing for <br/>
their family. So their being in school at 20 is perhaps less by <br/>
choice than by economic necessity.<br/>

It&#39;s not  intimidating, it&#39;s just exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
Just to put this into context, my  first teaching gig was as a high  <br/>
school teacher at the age of ...  get ready .... 24. I had students  <br/>
who were months shy of 21 because  as long as you don&#39;t turn 21 during  <br/>
the school year, you can go to  high school in NYC til then  <br/>
because ... ahem ... you&#39;re still a  minor. So I had 20 year-old women  <br/>
with 2 kids attending day high  school.<br/>
<br/>
It was exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if you mean it&#39;s  more exhausting teaching a presumably  <br/>
motivated 20 year old mother than it is a 17 year old who HAS to be there?<br/>
 <br/>
In what ways?<br/>
