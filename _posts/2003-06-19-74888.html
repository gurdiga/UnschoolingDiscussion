 </span></blockquote>Well once again the bullying is rearing it&#39;s ugly head. I thought we were <br/>
going to be general in our posts. Everytime it looks like the thread is going to <br/>
move forward again it gets yanked back into the abyss of school like <br/>
behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
Teresa&#39;s question was legitimate. I was not aware that &quot;maroon&quot; was an actual <br/>
saying, perhaps because I find Bugs Bunny himself to be a sarcastic <br/>
character. Hated him as a child, hate him now. Therefore, I would have asked, I thought <br/>
it was a type-o, apparently so did Teresa. When a response came through I was <br/>
glad to learn something new. <br/>
<br/>
Then this post, with it&#39;s vehemence, comes through as an attempt to regulate <br/>
a particular person&#39;s postings?  I thought these posts were seen by everyone <br/>
and finger pointing was being resisted for the sake of keeping discussions <br/>
general? I thought list netiqette here was suppose to include not naming names and <br/>
not getting personal? I thought we weren&#39;t name-calling here, but directly <br/>
stating someone natters is ok? Some babble, some yak, so what? Or is natter in <br/>
particular not allowed? Was &quot;please&quot; added simply to pretend to be polite or <br/>
was it sarcastic as several posts have been??  Maybe it was both, pretend <br/>
politeness dripping in sarcasm. Maybe it was humor. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps everyone should only post once or twice a day. Silence can be golden. <br/>
I&#39;m sure several here wish I were. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is unaware of just how much learning can be done when they stop <br/>
speaking and start listening, I would encourage them to read, read, read. Look <br/>
things up, go to google, do something. Don&#39;t ask questions until you have. Don&#39;t <br/>
give perspectives until you can qualify yourself with what research you have <br/>
done. But what if it&#39;s a book others haven&#39;t read?  Oh wait I forgot some <br/>
people here know everything. But then again, there are individuals who refuse to <br/>
legitimize other perspectives, they want proof that posters have in fact <br/>
thought and read and researched. What happens though if several members research but <br/>
no one reads the same material, then whose worthy?<br/>
<br/>
Oh man, who is that going to leave to post?<br/>
<br/>
I wish the rules for posting applied to everyone, but wait, that would <br/>
require equality and we aren&#39;t.  Or are we? But if in fact we are not, who <br/>
determines what we are? Who deems the worthiness or equality? Oh maybe it all falls <br/>
under who gets moderated. Those who should be heard, are quieted under the guise <br/>
of what&#39;s best for the list, when truthfully it&#39;s about not wanting certain <br/>
toes stepped on, while others are allowed to yak away (note they don&#39;t natter) <br/>
with absolutely no censorship whatsoever.  <br/>
<br/>
Things that you go, &quot;Hmmmmm,&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300481963">&quot;What I heard was some people denying that it is even a reality that <br/>
people do engage in ranking other people socially AND other people <br/>
saying it was wrong to do so, that they don&#39;t believe in ranking <br/>
people <br/>
- that all people are the same, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s when I feel people are projecting their own desires and <br/>
ignoring reality.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to me, that on a board where many people took a <br/>
personality test and discussed the results, that some of those same <br/>
people deny the &quot;naturalness&quot; of rank and hierarchies.<br/>
I have the book that is based on the Myers-Briggs test and in <br/>
reading about all of the different personality types, it is all too <br/>
obvious that some (more passive types) will defer to the more <br/>
aggressive (leadership oriented) personality types.  Not just <br/>
because it makes more sense, but it is NATURAL for their personality.<br/>
<br/>
There are personalities that crave structure, others that are free <br/>
flowing. One often balances and assists the other. Humans are pack <br/>
animals. We are social creatures that need each other and hence it <br/>
is natural and desirable for there to be some kind of order to our <br/>
society.  There are going to be numerous opinions on how to <br/>
structure a society, but so far I haven&#39;t seen anarchy actually <br/>
working in real life.<br/>
One of those theories that sound good, but hasn&#39;t been proven to <br/>
work in reality because they don&#39;t take into account that thing <br/>
called human nature.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m spinning off topic though. The whole point was that rank <br/>
exists. Others tried to deny it and then claim that it has nothing <br/>
to do with instinct or nature. Doing a simple personality test is <br/>
one model that shows it is indeed natural and instinctual.<br/>

rank?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and then claim that it has nothing <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to do with instinct or nature. <br/>

both? Hence, my cell phone exist, so is it natural? It is composed of materials <br/>
created by man utilizing natural matter. Therefore, because said compositions <br/>
are created from natural matter, does that then make my cell phone natural? <br/>
Depends on ones perspectives. And just because it may not be easily understood by <br/>
some, that the possibility exists that this argument could in fact be made <br/>
that my cell phone is natural, by maintaining it&#39;s existance thru natural means, <br/>
that lack of understanding does not disqualify that argument.<br/>

   Doing a simple personality test is &gt; one model that shows it is indeed <br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK going out on a limb again...So if one does a personality test and finds <br/>
their personailty to in fact be that of one who rejects the idea of authority, <br/>
then according to this argument, it would in fact be &quot;natural&quot; for them, <br/>
therefore from their POV, it would be valid to reject such an idea. <br/>

<br/>
If people say your argument isn&#39;t a parallel that means they just don&#39;t <br/>
understand it?<br/>
<br/>
Bad examples are as &quot;qualified&quot; as good arguments?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So if one does a personality test and finds <br/>

<br/>
Rejecting the idea of authority is kinda like rejecting the idea that the <br/>
earth goes around the sun, or rejecting theideathatice is frozen water.<br/>
<br/>
If a wolf took a personality test and it showed that he &quot;rejects the idea <br/>
that wolves live in packs,&quot; or rejects the idea that there is alpha male behavior <br/>
(and natural behavior toward an alpha male) would that mean he was a superior <br/>
kind of wolf?  Or just maybe a delusional kind of wolf?  <br/>
