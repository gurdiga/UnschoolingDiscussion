<div id="ygrps-yiv-145616304">My 3yo son has recently taken a large interest in what the tv/movie <br/>
characters are made of, i.e. clay, cartoon, puppets, computer image, etc. <br/>
I&#39;ve been answering all questions best I can, but wanted to know if anyone <br/>
knew of any resources for this kind of thing.  Like some &#39;making of&#39; type <br/>
videos or something. I&#39;m drawing a blank.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889788173">There was a documentary on the making of Roger Rabbit that was GREAT--about <br/>
how they did the interplay between filmed characters and the overlaid <br/>
animations, and how they made the animated characters look 3-D.  Nowadays <br/>
even TV cartoons have that lighting and shading, but until Roger Rabbit, <br/>
computer animation wasn&#39;t doing &quot;depth&quot; in that way.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone here has the link for some of the video-rental-by-mail places.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the best animations I&#39;ve ever seen is Teeny Little Super Guy.  There <br/>
used to be some on Sesame Street, and it&#39;s other places too.  (Not owned or <br/>
done by CTW.)  If anyone knows of a making-of for those I&#39;d love to see it.  <br/>
There is stop-action animation  but also the characters are a series of <br/>
drawings on cups, mugs, glasses... and so as the piece is moved to create the <br/>
movement, the cup is changed to another pose of the character too.  <br/>
