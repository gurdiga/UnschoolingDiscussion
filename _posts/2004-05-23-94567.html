That is one of my truly most favorite books of all time! And I read A LOT!<br/>
Both Sky and Nell read it within the past two years, and found it to be the<br/>
treasure that I raved about. It was originally recommended to Sky and Nell<br/>
by Grace Llewyln when they were at Not Back to School Camp one summer, but<br/>
I read it first. A very compelling and gripping story.<br/>
I&#39;m thrilled to hear she has a new one! I&#39;m getting it next trip into town!<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490000574">I don&#39;t know if this has been discussed here before, but I just <br/>
finished reading &quot;Into the Forest&quot; by Jean Hegland, and the novel is <br/>
written in first person by the narrator who is a 17 y.o. unschooler <br/>
living in the redwoods of northern California. It&#39;s pretty unusual <br/>
that you see unschooling described in a work of fiction, and I had no <br/>
idea that would be the case when I picked up the book.<br/>
So I just went to hear Jean Hegland read yesterday from her new <br/>
book &quot;Windfalls&quot; (which sounds even more amazing than her first) and <br/>
had to ask her if she homeschooled (she does). <br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone else had read this book and what they <br/>
thought of it. It was a very intriguing story about a post-<br/>
apocolyptic world, though I have to admit it got a bit slow in <br/>
places, it&#39;s beautifully written.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763196829">I read this recently with my book group HERS<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webpages.charter.net/hers/">http://webpages.charter.net/hers/</a><br/>
We meet monthly and read fiction and non-fiction.  We all recomend books and<br/>
vote in the fall for the next year&#39;s books.  We use a guide (see website)<br/>
for our discussion, but we use it as a starting point.  We seek to share<br/>
views rather than agree on &quot;correct&quot; answers.  We also enjoy food and<br/>
beverages related to the theme of the book, and just spending time together.<br/>
<br/>
I really liked &quot;Into the Forest&quot;.  There were a couple of weak points, but<br/>
I&#39;ve yet to read a *perfect* novel.  It happens that a couple members of the<br/>
book group are eclectic/leaning toward unschooling, and one member respects<br/>
that choice but thinks parents should work to make schools better, rather<br/>
than remove their kids from it.  It was interesting to hear their ideas<br/>
about the homeschooling/unschooling in the book.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the way the two main characters found their paths as teens (though<br/>
of course that all changed by the disaster).  The book did play into the<br/>
stereotype of the granola/isolate family from society homeschooler.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s cool. I&#39;d like for some of my HS/Unschooling friends to read <br/>
it, I think it would be cool to discuss. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true, though in the case of this story I think it was pretty <br/>
realistic. I have a friend who lived in the same area of the Redwoods <br/>
and she said that she knew several families exactly like this - <br/>
relatively isolated unschoolers 30+ miles back in the woods. Not <br/>
unlikely, but still not the norm for homeschoolers, of course. I just <br/>
don&#39;t think it would&#39;ve worked for her plot to have them less <br/>
isolated, and indeed, the author homeschooled her kids on 55 acres in <br/>
the redwood forest, so perhaps it&#39;s more than a bit autobiographical.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as an author, I have a homeschooling character in my 2nd novel <br/>
and I have to say it&#39;s pretty tough to think about the way his <br/>
character presents vs. what his character really is. He&#39;s being <br/>
homeschooled because he&#39;s very gifted and his mom didn&#39;t think he was <br/>
well served in the school system. But he&#39;s not unschooled, and his <br/>
two siblings are in school. The mom&#39;s character is just not that of a <br/>
homeschooler. So although I would love to present unschooling in my <br/>
own fiction, the truth of it is that the characters are who they are, <br/>
not who I&#39;d like them to be for my own reasons (presenting <br/>
unschooling to the world). It always feels weird to me to have my <br/>
characters have different experiences/make different choices than I <br/>
would make, but they are their own people, they&#39;re not me. So I can <br/>
see where the author just needed to have her characters be who they <br/>
were, for their sake and for the plot&#39;s sake.<br/>

Stones from the River even though it was very dark. This one sounds <br/>
good, and we&#39;re going to the library tomorrow, so I can add to my <br/>
pile :-).<br/>
