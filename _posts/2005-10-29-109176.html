I am sorry as if it seems that I was not requesting him to get  off, get him to come down.  He was just refusing, climbing higher.  I have MS and I am not as fast as he is.  I was doing my best in a difficult situation.  I do like you idea of offering other places to climb.  I have done that in the past and do take him to playgrounds and parks were there are more appropriate places to climb.  Joanne<br/>
