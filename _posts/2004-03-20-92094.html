<div id="ygrps-yiv-642922867">We don&#39;t own any now, but used to have 4 of them. They<br/>
are friendly creatures, and usually don&#39;t bite.<br/>
All of ours were male. Haven&#39;t heard about differences<br/>
in the sexes (if they are like rats however, the<br/>
females tend to get more tumors).<br/>
If you get more than one, my experience is that if you<br/>
want them together start early or they won&#39;t get<br/>
along.<br/>
They don&#39;t like wire cages (hurts their feet) so a<br/>
flat solid bottomed cage is best. they eat lots of<br/>
different things, but also require salt wheels.<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t play with ours enough for this, but I<br/>
know of one girl who has a male guinea pig and carries<br/>
him a lot of the places that she goes - to do this<br/>
there has to be a large investment of time early on to<br/>
get them uused to it. <br/>
<br/>
Two other things: If anyone in your family has<br/>
allergies/asthma the bedding they require can make<br/>
these worse. And they go to the bathroom a lot - we<br/>
used to have to use towels so it wasn&#39;t all over :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349673747">We currently have a guinea pig - she is a rescue piggy (our 2nd rescue) & 3rd piggy.  If they are handled properly and early - they can be very cuddly pets.  Do Not buy one from the local pet store - instead check w/ yr local 4-h and get a baby from them.  Teach it hands/being held are a good thing by giving it the fresh veggies and fruits by hand.  Ours have all chirpled - (our word - they make a piggy squeal with a chirp noise at the same time) when we enter the room or go by their cage and talk to them.  Our first rescue used to &quot;sit-up&quot; like a little dog when we went over to talk w/ him.  It is rare for a piggy to bite.  We have had both males and females - and both are very sweet.<br/>
<br/>
They take time and patience and regular daily attention - like rabbits they are social animals.  Our piggy and mini rex bunny share a cage together now - both seem to be fine w/ the arrangement and enjoy the company - especially on days we are out all day!  But intro them slowly if you decide to do this- and like dogs - do it away from their cages - and be prepared to step quickly if they don&#39;t get along!<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012482548">Hi,<br/>
I have 3 piggies and they are very sweet and friendly. Some advice: <br/>
If you get more than one make sure they are the same sex (that&#39;s <br/>
where my third one came from ;-). Guinea pigs are social animals so <br/>
it&#39;s better to get a couple. Pet store cages are not big enough for <br/>
piggies...there is an excellent website www.cavycages.com which has <br/>
lots of good info on caring for the piggies and ideas for building <br/>
deluxe homes for your piggies. Any questions...feel free to drop me a <br/>
note.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Carol!<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago my daughter&#39;s guinea pigs &quot;got married&quot; (one male, three<br/>
females) and produced more babies than I care to remember. :-) Happily, her<br/>
guinea pig phase is over. Now she is into astronomy (age 12).<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend getting females over males (though it is sometimes hard to<br/>
tell them apart when they are young). Guinea pigs are social critters who<br/>
are happier if they have a friend or two to snuggle up with when they sleep.<br/>
Males tend to fight with each other unless they are brothers from the same<br/>
litter who have always lived together. Females are pretty mellow and will<br/>
get along with just about any other guinea pig, even if the second pig is<br/>
introduced much later.<br/>
<br/>
Our male seemed to be messier than the females. He was always strutting<br/>
around marking his territory, flinging the bedding out of his cage and<br/>
knocking over his food dish. This went on even when we kept him in a<br/>
different cage well apart from the females. He would still try to impress<br/>
them from across the room!<br/>
<br/>
We have great memories of our piggies. No regrets. The only down side I can<br/>
think of is that you also have cats. We once had two cats who thought our<br/>
piggies were the most delicious playthings in the world. Our cats liked to<br/>
lounge on the tops of the pig cages with their forelegs dangling down<br/>
through the bars. They&#39;d often make a quick grab for the pigs whenever they<br/>
came out of their hiding places. This resulted in some ugly looking<br/>
scratches on the piggies backs. (We treated the wounds with neosporin.) The<br/>
cats also liked to knock the cages off of the table and/or pull the cage<br/>
doors open, so we had to fasten the cages to the wall and lock the doors<br/>
shut with zip-ties. All those security measures were hard to work around at<br/>
feeding/cleaning times.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m sure that your 4 cats are more civilized than mine were. If they<br/>
have not yet eaten the rats, frogs, rabbit, bird, fish (and dogs--lol) that<br/>
you already have, welcoming guinea pigs into the group should be easy as<br/>
pie. Enjoy! :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274781322">Thanks to everyone who replied to my question about guinea pigs.  We are now the proud owners of a baby named Pema, named for one of my favorite writers, a Buddhist nun called Pema Chodron.  My Pema is just lovely, sweet and affectionate, and a terrific addition to the family zoo.  Kayla (4) just adores her, although she gets her small furry creatures confused and calls Pema a Beanie pig!  I am still experiencing the hormonal surge which resulted in my bringing Pema home to nurture, so I am considering other pets.  I&#39;d love to have a goat, although my husband rolled his eyes, shook his head and walked away from me when I mentioned it the other day.  Anyway, thanks for the advice.<br/>
<br/>
Carol, keeper of the zoo<br/>
