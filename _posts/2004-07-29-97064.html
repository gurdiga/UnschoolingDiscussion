If you have a history that could use a more particular slant, you can <br/>
probably find it by google (if you had an alcoholic parent, or some kind of past <br/>
problems or recovery needs), but to replace the voices in your head, you just need <br/>
more soothing, helpful voices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082832170">Hello Sandra,<br/>
 <br/>
I have enjoyed your writing in the past and look forward to future articles. You may or may not be interested, but I&#39;m spearheading a local publication here in the Olympia, Washington area and I am currently seeking submissions. It is a quarterly issue on the idea of self-directed learning and community-based learning. The next theme is on democracy at home and community. I am looking for someone to perhaps speak (write) on behalf of democracy (if or when it applies) at home or within homeschool groups. I have done a lot of (research) exploration into homeschooling, unschooling, deschooling, and intentional communities, as a part of my college studies and beyond. Please let me know if this is feasible. I look forward to hearing from you. Feel free to shoot me any questions or concerns <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:naturallearning@...">naturallearning@...</a>. BE WELL! Paul <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925469647">Wow!  Wow.  Thanks so much for all of this Sandra!  I started reading and<br/>
I&#39;m re-inspired and ready to change the world (ours anyway, then who<br/>
knows?).  If only I weren&#39;t getting sleepy.  I want to read and read.   I<br/>
don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t look at some of this sooner.  I know it&#39;s there.<br/>
Thanks for pointing it out, yet again.<br/>
<br/>
I will try the affirmations too.  I promise.  At first when I read your<br/>
suggestion that I should replace the voices in my head with more helpful,<br/>
soothing voices, I thought to myself, &quot;Yeah, OK, but I was just joking to<br/>
illustrate my occassional state of mind.&quot;  But then I realized, that IS my<br/>
state of mind and it&#39;s no joke!  Can&#39;t really explain, but I was being hard<br/>
on myself, and not taking myself seriously at the same time.  Anyway, it&#39;s<br/>
late and I&#39;m probably not making sense, but I promise that I will change the<br/>
self-talk that goes on in my head.  It will be hard.  I have a history and<br/>
have been told this before.  But I can change this now.  I&#39;m ready.  (I<br/>
actually think this is an essential to changing our whole family<br/>
dynamics--how I feel seems to permeate us all.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
Andrea<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-607722586">My latest affirmation is &quot;peace is powerful, breathe&quot;. My son is a <br/>
barometer of me. When I am tense, worried, aggitated, hungary, tired, <br/>
etc. he keys up a notch and starts clinging, whining, or seeking to <br/>
distract me from whatever he perceives to be bothering mama. He is so <br/>
perceptive of my emotions, more so than I am even, that he is a <br/>
little mirror for me to learn about myself. He is so acutely in tune <br/>
with me that it is very unsettling for him when I am unsettled, even <br/>
a little bit. I am amazed at his ability to read me. He is <br/>
NOT &quot;acting out&quot;; he is calling out for the calm mama. He will even <br/>
start saying &quot;little baby needs his mama&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, I realized that my peace is powerful to our calmness as a family. <br/>
I know that his reactions are a cue to recenter myself. As he has <br/>
grown older, he uses his words more to show me myself. When he was <br/>
younger, he used his actions too: hitting, grabbing, even biting a <br/>
few times. I have learned that these are his calls for help to <br/>
resettle our home. He wants a happy home as much as I do. But I do <br/>
have much more ability to break the cycle of harmony and disharmony <br/>
as the adult.<br/>
<br/>
So, I will stop, kneel down to his level, hold or hug him and <br/>
whisper. Then he knows I am calmer, he is able to rely on me to help <br/>
him and he can move on. It is very disturbing to have the mama out of <br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
I am learning not to be a type A, it doesn&#39;t work well for us as a <br/>
family. Mama needs to be peace for the family to be peaceful.<br/>

I am so happy to read this - I had forgotten this about Jayn. Exhaustion and<br/>
grumpiness really are contagious, aren&#39;t they? Just as much as joy and<br/>
calmness.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past few nights I have been very tired and crabby. Early in the<br/>
week Jayn suddenly switched to her up-all-night mode, instead of slowly<br/>
moving to it over a period of weeks. I was playing catch-up and felt<br/>
desperate for sleep. Two nights ago she seemed to be crazier and wilder the<br/>
closer to morning it got (the tireder I got), including kicking me in the<br/>
head and laughing about it when I sat down near her. <br/>
<br/>
I find it very hard to stop her from hitting and kicking out. Sometimes I am<br/>
literally just batting her hands away from my face, or desperately holding<br/>
her arms down, while keeping her body far enough away that she can&#39;t bite<br/>
me. I am reluctant to hold her until she is calm, after reading Jan Hunt&#39;s<br/>
article &quot;The Dangers of Holding Therapy&quot; ( www.naturalchild.org ) although<br/>
it is tough to know what to do instead. I do tell her to take deep breaths<br/>
and that helps her. <br/>
<br/>
It is clear to me that the best solution generally is to avoid things<br/>
escalating to the point where she is acting crazy. In the daytime if there<br/>
is restlessness we can run outside to the pool, go to the park, or just run<br/>
about the neighborhood. At four in the morning these options are denied us,<br/>
if only in consideration of the other apartment dwellers across the<br/>
courtyard. Nor can she do too much big jumping and running in our second<br/>
floor apartment. Also my brain is not usually mush when I am less tired.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I did differently the following night was make sure she had<br/>
more food more regularly. My internal appetite/clock is so out of whack that<br/>
I just am not feeling hungry, so I had been waiting for her to let me know<br/>
that she was hungry. It made a lot of difference to just put out a bowl of<br/>
cut fruit and some eggs and bacon at appropriate (relative to hours awake<br/>
rather than the clock) times.<br/>
<br/>
The second thing was rather than squabble over the television (we were<br/>
arguing over who was going to watch the big tv for goodness sake) I decided<br/>
to use her little tv/dvd combo to catch up on some dvd&#39;s that I have wanted<br/>
to see, using the headphones for quiet. To my pleased amazement, Jayn has<br/>
spent the last two nights letting me do quite a lot of this quiet watching,<br/>
which is easy to pause when she needs something, while playing nearby. She<br/>
gets to watch her stuff, or have the big set off. We have also done more<br/>
reading, and she has been playing with her musical instruments. The main<br/>
plus is that I don&#39;t have to listen to yet another rerun of &quot;Max and Ruby&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The third thing has been that she has spent some time in the evening (her<br/>
morning) playing with dh, a crucial break for both of us. He had been out of<br/>
the house for the first couple of &quot;angry&quot; nights, by coincidence, and pretty<br/>
much going directly to bed when he got home. Not having to be her sole<br/>
source of interaction has made me feel less pressured.<br/>
<br/>
The slow march back to daytime continues. Today she went to sleep a little<br/>
earlier than I would have liked at about 9.10am. Unless this is just a nap,<br/>
she will awaken at about 6.30 - 7pm. I&#39;m about to go to bed now. I&#39;m going<br/>
to keep the idea of her as a mirror in the forefront of my mind. <br/>
<br/>
Great post, Pat. I&#39;ve saved it in my Unschooling Keepers folder.<br/>

===========<br/>
<br/>
Marty did a couple of those cycles when he was fourish, five.  He would do <br/>
his long sleep a little earlier each night, and wake up TOO early, and wasn&#39;t <br/>
taking naps anymore.  But he finally settled.<br/>
<br/>
I cried myself to sleep alot as a child. It&#39;s not good rest.  And if a parent <br/>
can rest well while a child is sobbing her guts out, damn them. They <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be sleeping well.  So I just never opted for &quot;I SAID GO TO SLEEP&quot; commands <br/>
resulting in crying.   And when a kid is crying, nothing is more calming (she <br/>
says sarcastically) than the threat &quot;Shut up or I&#39;ll give you something to cry <br/>
about.&quot;  I hope and I wish that I was the last child on the earth to have <br/>
heard that.<br/>
