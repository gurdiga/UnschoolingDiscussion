<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685204156">Thanks, Pat & Kolleen for the bday wishes<br/>
I spent the day doing more of nothing than something, actually. DD wanted to show me some ice skating tricks she is learning so I did that. I stayed *out* of the kitchen for the entire day &lt;g&gt; and took myself and my girls out to eat. <br/>
Next year will be the *big* one... 5-0 ;-). <br/>
oh oh! I did do something that is taking yet another step toward that attitude of &quot;I&#39;m &#39;x&#39; yrs old and I don&#39;t give a darn&quot;. I have lots of slogan buttons that are, well... they say what I feel and I pinned them all over my denim pocketbook for all to see. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;ll provide a list of the slogans below.<br/>
Sarah<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Well Sarah, now that it is coming to the end of your 49th birthday, tell us how you celebrated.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Birthday<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slogans:<br/>
  a.. If only closed minds came with closed mouths<br/>
  b.. It&#39;s your hell... you burn in it<br/>
  c.. Licenses for dogs, cats ,cars, marriages, but NOT GUNS?<br/>
  d.. Every mother is a working mother<br/>
  e.. Children are people, too<br/>
  f.. At first they burn books. Eventually they burn people.<br/>
  g.. Prochild Pro choice<br/>
  h.. If you think Education is expensive, try ignorance<br/>
  i.. Reincarnation: been that, done that<br/>
  j.. Feminism is the radical notion that women are people<br/>
  k.. Question Authority<br/>
  l.. .... and more I shall not post :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349002694">Actually, it is a long family tradition.  Its beginning has gotten lost in<br/>
time.  My grandfather (1860-1957) said that people worry too much about age<br/>
and that one should celebrate how how long the world has been blessed with<br/>
one&#39;s presence.  He said that folks should cumulatively get presents for<br/>
each year on this earth (sorta like the 12 days of Christmas).  Seems to<br/>
have worked in our family as all his brothers and sisters (18 of them) lived<br/>
well past 90.  Uncle Billy had 101 present days, Uncle Irving had 99 present<br/>
days, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, everyone get busy and send Sarah her 49 presents &lt;g&gt;<br/>
