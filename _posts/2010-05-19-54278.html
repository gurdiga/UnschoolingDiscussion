<div id="ygrps-yiv-231207000">Kelly Halldorson wrote a review of my book, and when she wrote to me  <br/>
to tell me where it was, there was a question.<br/>
<br/>
  ------------------<br/>
As, I was writing I realized something. You didn&#39;t do a segment on  <br/>
&quot;trust&quot; did you? I&#39;ve just looked through it...three times thinking I  <br/>
must have missed something.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering why?<br/>
<br/>
For me that is the absolute biggest *disagreement* I have with  <br/>
unschooling philosophy...is that word. I don&#39;t like how it&#39;s used. I  <br/>
think most people use it wrong....okay maybe not wrong...just not how  <br/>
I think of it.<br/>
So, I generally gloss over that when I hear it and it made me  <br/>
think...that&#39;s what I did when I came across it in your book<br/>
----------------------<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t tell by that whether she meant she did find a section  <br/>
after, or that there wasn&#39;t one.<br/>
Because I have the word file and so can search the book, I looked.    <br/>
One section is called<br/>
Trust, Free Time, Compost.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s on my site, too. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/substance">http://sandradodd.com/substance</a><br/>
It&#39;s about trusting the process of natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
Other places in The Big Book of Unschooling where &quot;trust&quot; is  <br/>
mentioned, it&#39;s usually about the parents earning the children&#39;s  <br/>
trust, and about deciding which sources the parents will consider to  <br/>
be trustworthy.<br/>
<br/>
page 130, section on humor:<br/>
&quot;Smiles and laughter involve safety and trust.  Those emotions are  <br/>
good for families, for relationships, and for learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
168, on eating in peace:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A little bit of plain food in a peaceful room filled with trust and  <br/>
love is better than the greatest food in the world choked down through  <br/>
fearful tears.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
191, judging interests:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They will trust you as long and as far as you are trustworthy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
196, Becoming the Parent you Want to Be  (the third paragraph)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Change one thing.  Smile one sweet smile.  Say one kind thing.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If that felt good, do it again.  Rest.  Watch.  Listen.  You&#39;re a  <br/>
parent because of your child.  Your child.  You should be his parent,  <br/>
or her parent.  Not a generic parent, or a hypothetical parent.  Be  <br/>
your child&#39;s parent in each moment that you interact with her.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Somehow you will need to experiment with trust and patience, in  <br/>
little ways.  If it feels good, if it seems to work, try to remember  <br/>
what you did physically or cognitively to get to that place, so that  <br/>
you can induce it in the future....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those are the ways I think about trust, so I asked Kelly this, and she  <br/>
agreed to bring it here:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is there &quot;unschooling philosophy&quot;?  Is there one way in which all  <br/>
unschoolers use &quot;trust&quot;?  I&#39;m anxious to know why you wrote so much on  <br/>
trust.   If you don&#39;t like the way it&#39;s used (by whom??), why are you  <br/>
wondering why I didn&#39;t have a section on it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think we should talk about that on always learning.-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385834531">***Is there &quot;unschooling philosophy&quot;? Is there one way in which all <br/>
unschoolers use &quot;trust&quot;?***<br/>
<br/>
The following is my understanding of trust and how it&#39;s applied in real life... via a story:<br/>
<br/>
A new friend of Chamille&#39;s stayed the night at our house the other night.  She hadn&#39;t planned on it.  Her phone died and she doesn&#39;t have any of her phone numbers memorized to call from another phone.  John took our only working car to do some late night work about 10 or so miles away.  Chamille and her friend didn&#39;t know that John was going to do that and they had assumed that he&#39;d give her a ride home.  By the time they realized their predicament, it was after 10 pm.  This girl doesn&#39;t live in walking distance from our house, she lives about 5 or 6 miles away.  <br/>
<br/>
We were talking about how her mom was going to handle the situation.  The girl thought it likely that her mom might not even know that she was gone.  She was a little worried about it, but mostly didn&#39;t care.  I don&#39;t know this girl&#39;s parents at all and I probably won&#39;t ever meet them since this girl is moving back to Hawaii in about a week, to spend the summer there.<br/>
<br/>
I said that if it were Chamille, I&#39;d be worried and that I couldn&#39;t imagine not knowing where she was in the middle of the night, but that I would try my best to assume positive intent and trust that she was ok.  Chamille responded by saying that she couldn&#39;t imagine not finding a way to let me know where she is, even if she couldn&#39;t get home late at night for whatever reason.  She went on to say that she wouldn&#39;t want me to worry and that she knew that I would be relieved and understanding about her predicament.  So even if all attempts to reach me failed, she knew that I&#39;d still be understanding and sympathetic to her situation that she found herself in.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s mutual trust.  I trust that she&#39;ll do the best she can and she trusts me to be calm and considerate.  Her friend figured that at any time she DID show up, she&#39;d be in trouble with her mom, even if she showed up at 1 am, IF her mom even noticed that she wasn&#39;t at home.  <br/>
<br/>
Her turns out her mom did notice.  She noticed when it was time to wake her daughter up to go to school the next morning.  There&#39;s that trust too, a kid should be able to trust that their parents are looking out for them.  Not the whole watching and waiting by the front door to make sure they made curfew, but generally being aware and connected to your child.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling is a bit different.  Chamille trusts that her parents are there for her, she trusts that we trust her.  We aren&#39;t out to prove her untrustworthy, like a parent waiting to make sure that their child makes curfew, but that we trust our kids to make the best decisions they can in any given moment and know that people make mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing that since each of our kids were small and making small choices, so that it naturally evolved to big kids making bigger choices.  Our kids aren&#39;t afraid to tell us things, they don&#39;t hide mistakes, they don&#39;t need to lie and cover up.  That helps us trust them more and it helps them trust us more because they know we are reliable to be kind and considerate.<br/>
<br/>
How that relates to unschooling:  If learning happens through the living, the more peaceful that is, the more learning can happen.  Trusting each other is way more peaceful than the alternative.  And more than that, if our kids trust us, they are much more likely to accept what we say and listen to us.  If our relationship was adversarial through a general distrust, we likely wouldn&#39;t have those great conversations that our unschooling life is sprinkled with, those ones that just happen and lead to great learning moments.<br/>

It&#39;s about trusting the process of natural learning.&lt;==<br/>
<br/>
This is where I think most unschoolers get confused or maybe not. I&#39;m curious what others think. <br/>
<br/>
Here is one John Holt quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To trust children we must first learn to trust ourselves...and most of us were taught as children that we could not be trusted.&quot; -John Holt<br/>
<br/>
There are others and really a many mentions of &quot;trusting children&quot; in the words of John Holt. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/3y5ehyv">http://tinyurl.com/3y5ehyv</a><br/>
<br/>
John Holt seems to mean blanket trust of children. <br/>
<br/>
==&gt;Other places in The Big Book of Unschooling where &quot;trust&quot; is <br/>
mentioned, it&#39;s usually about the parents earning the children&#39;s <br/>
trust, and about deciding which sources the parents will consider to <br/>
be trustworthy.&lt;==<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about the parents earning the children&#39;s trust in specific areas too. These examples don&#39;t bother me at all. I&#39;m in agreement with all of them...because of the context. And it&#39;s not a general blanket trust. <br/>
<br/>
-=-Is there &quot;unschooling philosophy&quot;? Is there one way in which all <br/>
unschoolers use &quot;trust&quot;? I&#39;m anxious to know why you wrote so much on <br/>
trust. If you don&#39;t like the way it&#39;s used (by whom??), why are you <br/>
wondering why I didn&#39;t have a section on it?<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I wrote back to Sandra with a little bit of expansion....<br/>
<br/>
I was *informed* early on by my local folks that the core of unschooling is about trust, more specifically &quot;trusting your children&quot; -- this always pissed me off. It implies (the way folks said it to me) that if you don&#39;t unschool then you don&#39;t trust your kids. Period. I&#39;m not a fan of absolutes. I think everything has a perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I eventually just learned to get over it and find a different word that worked for me. And somewhat tune-out that word... <br/>
<br/>
I generally don&#39;t like the way people use the word trust. Because often times there is this assumption that you are a bad person if you don&#39;t &quot;trust&quot; someone. I don&#39;t think trust is that all inclusive. I actually think some unschoolers use that word to make themselves sound/feel *better* than everyone else in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example that has nothing to do with unschooling but everything to do with the word trust. I recently spoke with a woman who&#39;s husband cheated on her. She has decided to stay with him. She says she is miserable, can&#39;t trust him SO they can&#39;t have a good relationship. <br/>
<br/>
I replied to her this...paraphrased a bit. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t think you need blanket trust to have a good relationship. I think it&#39;s more important to live in reality. He&#39;s not trustworthy, in that way. I think you work your life around that limitation. If he evolves, if things change...okay but in the meantime don&#39;t focus on needing to trust him. Don&#39;t beat either yourself or him up about it. Accept it&#39;s an issue/limitation and work around it. I don&#39;t expect my husband to trust me to fix the brakes on the car. I&#39;ve pretty much proven that I&#39;m not real good at that stuff. If I demanded he trust me and I didn&#39;t have him check up on my work. I might inadvertently kill the family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blanket trust does not exist. I have not met a single parent of a toddler that &quot;trusted&quot; her child to walk across the street alone. There are limitations that can be developmental, environmental, biological, personal etc. You do your children no favors if trust them without taking those factors into consideration. <br/>
<br/>
Trusting in the process of natural learning, trusting that your kids know best what interests them...that&#39;s where trust comes into play, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

It&#39;s different from either/or and having a spectrum of possibilities. More like allowing situations to expand until I get to the hazy edges and need to weigh up pros and cons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605270275">Kelly, I agree with a lot that you say about trust.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there&#39;s a couple of wayw that NOT trusting children&#39;s intentions<br/>
(despite apparent as well as actual lack of skill) can mess with<br/>
unschooling. For, I&#39;d say, most parents.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents will only extend trust once a child has proven themselves<br/>
to be able to do what they&#39;re trying to do, but if the child isn&#39;t<br/>
given the chance to do things in a protective environment, the risk of<br/>
danger or making mistakes or getting discouraged or sneaking to do<br/>
forbidden things when parents can&#39;t see increases. My parents didn&#39;t<br/>
trust me (especially my dad who got a lot of rough treatment in<br/>
childhood) and both told me I was irresponsible but they gave me<br/>
little opportunity to prove myself. This was scary for me and I still<br/>
lack confidence in some areas that I&#39;ve NEVER tried but wanted to<br/>
--was *eager* to-- when I was younger.<br/>
<br/>
Music is one of those. My parents didn&#39;t think I could do music so<br/>
they didn&#39;t encourage it and said I couldn&#39;t carry a tune in a bucket<br/>
(which is true because I can&#39;t hear well) but I wanted to enjoy music<br/>
in my own way and wasn&#39;t given much chance to. It was great years<br/>
later when a friend who played very well handed me her guitar after a<br/>
while and said &quot;Here, you play&quot; and I didn&#39;t have to even tell her I<br/>
wanted to try! I didn&#39;t even know I wanted to at that point. My friend<br/>
just caught a glimpse and went with it. Nice.<br/>
<br/>
Trusting children (or anyone) need not be an all or nothing deal. I<br/>
trust Karl a lot and help him to succeed in his goals by going<br/>
alongside until he and I feel confident with him doing things on his<br/>
own when he wants to. Until then, I trust his intention to do well, or<br/>
I assume positive intention as Jeff Sabo recently put it in his blog,<br/>
and simply go with. One benefit of that is Karl trusts me to be in his<br/>
corner, pulling for him, when he wants to try something. Whether he<br/>
can do it yet, or not.<br/>
<br/>
When parents mistake unschooling as an all-at-once, cut and dried kind<br/>
of deal, there&#39;s the flip side of what I experienced. Many parents may<br/>
not realize how scary it is for their kids to be on their own with the<br/>
things they wanted to do before they&#39;re ready. Just because the<br/>
parents were bursting for freedom doesn&#39;t mean that what their kids<br/>
want to do comes easy for a young person. It doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t<br/>
want their parents to help. Maybe the parents never realized or have<br/>
forgotten that things adults consider to be easy are more complex for<br/>
probably most children. This apparent &quot;trust&quot; means their kids have a<br/>
very conventional upbringing after all. They can call it unschooling<br/>
tho. ;) Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
An example are kids whose parents won&#39;t talk much about sex and their<br/>
kids are forced to deal with that area of their lives without their<br/>
parents as a source of info. See how that&#39;s conventional in terms of<br/>
how trust is laid out in parent/child relationships? Everything&#39;s<br/>
groovy until something goes wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The people that have a hard time with trusting because they&#39;ve been<br/>
burned by the people in their lives, have a hard time with trusting<br/>
anyone, including their own children. And this turns up in unconscious<br/>
ways. All of this is why most if not all parents NEED to hear that<br/>
Holtian message of &quot;trust your children&quot; if they&#39;re going to do<br/>
nurture the relationships within the family and build the kind of<br/>
rapport that makes unschooling succeed.<br/>

I guess here is one of those areas. I don&#39;t think this is a matter of trust. Just because they didn&#39;t think you could do it or said you didn&#39;t carry a tune...I don&#39;t think that is about a lack of trust in you. I guess I just don&#39;t think that is quite the word. I&#39;m probably splitting hairs but this feels more like just not believing in you or maybe your interest in music was an annoyance. Maybe they thought it would end up costing them money or they&#39;d have to drive you to lessons or something like that. Or maybe they just didn&#39;t like music themselves?<br/>
<br/>
+++Trusting children (or anyone) need not be an all or nothing deal.+++<br/>
<br/>
Which is really what I was saying in the first place. The problem (I see) is there are a lot of unschoolers that claim it is all or nothing...or are so loose with the word *trust* that it seems that way. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure how you got that interpretation but I trust that you  <br/>
did ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What the statement means is that unschooling is built on a foundation  <br/>
of trust, not that unschoolers have claimed ownership of trust! Trust  <br/>
is one of the building blocks. There&#39;s still trust left over for  <br/>
everyone else to use. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But I agree about the use of the word trust in describing unschooling.  <br/>
I think it muddies more than clarifies. While unschooling is about  <br/>
trusting children, and it&#39;s obvious what people mean once you get it,  <br/>
the way it&#39;s expressed doesn&#39;t paint the right picture.<br/>
<br/>
Trust children&#39;s wants and needs. (I&#39;ve written trust kids understand  <br/>
their needs, but that&#39;s not it. It&#39;s not intellectual. It&#39;s a drive, a  <br/>
curiosity, biology, a hole that needs filled with something. Trust  <br/>
they can feel it and trust that if they&#39;re trying to meet it, then  <br/>
it&#39;s important to them.)<br/>
<br/>
Digging deeper into that: kids know they want something but they don&#39;t  <br/>
always know what it is and what will fill it. Trial and error is a  <br/>
good tool! By trying out things they&#39;re drawn to, they grow their  <br/>
understanding of the hole, of what doesn&#39;t work, what does work, and  <br/>
more about themselves and the things they&#39;re trying. Being a partner  <br/>
is good, not just in physically helping them but tapping into a  <br/>
parent&#39;s greater knowledge and experience to help them figure out what  <br/>
might work and better ways to get it. We don&#39;t necessarily want to  <br/>
hand them the solution, just help them face a more useful direction  <br/>
and eliminate some of the things that look good on the surface but  <br/>
don&#39;t really offer what they appear to (like misleading cover art on a  <br/>
book).<br/>
<br/>
Trust children don&#39;t want to die. But they don&#39;t always know how not  <br/>
to. So we help them find safe ways to get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve said they don&#39;t want to hurt themselves, but we all judge how  <br/>
much pain and difficulty we&#39;re willing to bear to get something we  <br/>
want. Different wants will be worth different levels of pain and  <br/>
irritation. For instance, kids are plenty willing to risk scrapes and  <br/>
bruises to master skateboarding.<br/>
<br/>
Trust children don&#39;t want to hurt others. But they don&#39;t always know  <br/>
how not to. So we help them find respectful paths to get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
Trust children want to be better and do better. Trust that they can  <br/>
learn through trying things. Those are connected. Regardless of  <br/>
whether a child is learning what we think they should learn from what  <br/>
they&#39;re doing, they *are* learning something that&#39;s important to them  <br/>
right now. The thing we think they should be learning, may be worth  <br/>
putting up with for now to get something else that&#39;s far more  <br/>
intriguing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192099188">== Here is one John Holt quote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;To trust children we must first learn to trust ourselves...and most of us were taught as children that we could not be trusted.&quot; -John Holt<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are others and really a many mentions of &quot;trusting children&quot; in the words of John Holt. <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/3y5ehyv">http://tinyurl.com/3y5ehyv</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; John Holt seems to mean blanket trust of children.==<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, this means trusting that your children know what they need physically and emotionally and trusting that your children don&#39;t have bad intent. <br/>
<br/>
Using the toddler crossing the street as an example: <br/>
<br/>
First, I think it depends on the street. If we lived on a country road on which the only traffic was us or people we were expecting, it might be safe to let a toddler cross that road alone. On a very busy, city street, it might not be safe for anyone to cross.<br/>
<br/>
Second, it&#39;s important to trust that the toddler does not have ill intent by wanting to cross the street. The child isn&#39;t being &quot;bad&quot;. Assume there&#39;s something interesting on the other side that the toddler wants to see, hear or do. Then do what you can to make it safe for the toddler to accomplish rather than screaming at the child, grabbing the child and spanking the child.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of parents assume ill intent for any behavior that bothers the parents. I think that goes back to religion and the idea of original sin. Everyone is born a sinner. To me, that&#39;s what Holt was getting at with the idea that we were taught that we couldn&#39;t be trusted. My husband thinks this way without even realizing it. When we&#39;ve talked about people being able to do what they want, he assumes they will do something mean or hurtful or bad. He can&#39;t fathom the idea that most people might be able to do what they want without hurting others. When I&#39;ve asked him if he thinks that comes from his Catholic upbringing, he denies it. I think it&#39;s been so ingrained into his thinking that he&#39;s not conscious of it. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about assuming that the toddler who wants to cross a busy street knows when it&#39;s safe to cross. The child is new to this world and doesn&#39;t understand that a large hunk of metal coming at a person at even 15 mph can be very dangerous. It&#39;s our responsibility as parents to keep the child safe from those things that are truly and immediately dangerous. That&#39;s where trust from the child to the parent comes in. Children should be able to trust their parents to keep them safe.<br/>
<br/>
Food and sleep are the other areas where I think parents have difficulty with trusting their children. Babies and children don&#39;t need to be taught what it feels like to be hungry or satisfied. They don&#39;t need to be taught what it feels like to be tired or well-rested. These are instinctive survival mechanisms that every person is born understanding. That&#39;s why the baby cries when his tummy hurts from hunger and roots around for the nipple when picked up and then falls asleep after getting his fill. So rather than forcing a child to eat everything in his plates at only certain times of the day and making him go to bed and wake up at certain times because someone taught you that was the right, responsible, disciplined thing to do, trust the child to eat when he&#39;s hungry and sleep when he&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
Teenagers get a lot of flack for sleeping until noon and craving pizza and potato chips and soda. Teenagers are going through a major growth period, both physically and developmentally. They need the extra sleep and the high calorie foods to fuel that growth. Back in the day before processed foods and fears about fat and cholesterol, it was bacon and eggs, butter, meat and potatoes. Humans, like other animals, instinctively strive to provide for their needs as quickly and efficiently as possible in order to optimize survival. So now it&#39;s easier and faster to get what they need from all the processed, prepackaged, premade high fat, high calorie foods. It&#39;s not ill-intent. It&#39;s basic survival instinct. That&#39;s my opinion, anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Trusting natural learning is what I meant by the example of<br/>
opportunities to try and see if an interest is what creates learning<br/>
and fun.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty fine line between trusting that children want to learn,<br/>
that they will learn organically, and trusting children. Probably in<br/>
the child&#39;s view, there would be very little distinction. And in the<br/>
parent&#39;s eyes, there&#39;s something very intertwined in the child and<br/>
learning that must be trusted or else the conventional parent will<br/>
continue to make decisions for the child and override the child&#39;s<br/>
interests and motivation, thinking that the child can&#39;t be trusted to<br/>
know what they really want.<br/>
<br/>
There is considerable trust in children, and an unaccustomed trust in<br/>
themselves to change old ways, that one could use to build<br/>
unschooling. Unless I&#39;m missing something.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a BIG issue of trust that Brian and I overcame in order to<br/>
unschool our child. Otherwise, there would be all the trappings of<br/>
conventional parenting plus the burden of assuming we&#39;re all &quot;born a<br/>
sinner&quot; working against any hope of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of people never come with that kind of baggage. Yet for<br/>
parents who do, trusting children is directly connected to the ability<br/>
to trust in the learning process. It means the parent needs to<br/>
experience learning in a very different, freer, less convoluted<br/>
context in order to realize that thinking and exploration won&#39;t<br/>
necessarily lead a child to death (or hell itself). However the<br/>
diligence needed to make safe paths to exploration is very different<br/>
from the exhausting energy needed to subdue children and keep them<br/>
from learning dangerous things.<br/>
<br/>
We know a religious family who bars their children from all manner of<br/>
things because they might be spiritually dangerous. Lego Batman on the<br/>
DS was one of those things and Karl was baffled by that restriction<br/>
for his friends. He doesn&#39;t get it. But in that game, the child can<br/>
choose to play the bad guy, and that&#39;s why his friend&#39;s mother will<br/>
probably never get those 3 boys a DS. Yet they have an old Atari where<br/>
the goal is to shoot spaceships down one after the other which I<br/>
assume IS ok.<br/>
<br/>
I feel bad that this lady&#39;s first experience of the DS (it was Karl&#39;s<br/>
DS) may have messed up her kids probably ever getting one. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
trust the learning or the things in the world a child might learn<br/>
from, and most of all she doesn&#39;t trust her kids not to turn into<br/>
killers due to exposure to these things. The mother&#39;s lack of trust<br/>
may translate later on into the inability of the children to trust<br/>
themselves to be good people, and so it creates an insecurity built-in<br/>
for the rest of their lives. I think it&#39;s unnecessary to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Sure they can learn from other things, but what this means is that the<br/>
parent filters rather than facilitates in the learning process. I<br/>
think any parent filters somewhat for a myriad of reasons, financial<br/>
limits for instance, not enough access to the right knowledge at the<br/>
moment, etc. Those are not permanent hurdles probably or they depend<br/>
on circumstances. Some filters are permanent or close to it. I know<br/>
because all the rules and no-nos that Brian and I learned in childhood<br/>
are very difficult (a LOT of work) to overcome once they take.<br/>

&gt; what it feels like to be hungry or satisfied. They don&#39;t need to be taught<br/>
&gt; what it feels like to be tired or well-rested. These are instinctive<br/>
&gt; survival mechanisms that every person is born understanding. That&#39;s why the<br/>
&gt; baby cries when his tummy hurts from hunger and roots around for the nipple<br/>
&gt; when picked up and then falls asleep after getting his fill. So rather than<br/>
&gt; forcing a child to eat everything in his plates at only certain times of the<br/>
&gt; day and making him go to bed and wake up at certain times because someone<br/>
&gt; taught you that was the right, responsible, disciplined thing to do, trust<br/>
&gt; the child to eat when he&#39;s hungry and sleep when he&#39;s not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Teenagers get a lot of flack for sleeping until noon and craving pizza and<br/>
&gt; potato chips and soda. Teenagers are going through a major growth period,<br/>
&gt; both physically and developmentally. They need the extra sleep and the high<br/>
&gt; calorie foods to fuel that growth. Back in the day before processed foods<br/>
&gt; and fears about fat and cholesterol, it was bacon and eggs, butter, meat and<br/>
&gt; potatoes. Humans, like other animals, instinctively strive to provide for<br/>
&gt; their needs as quickly and efficiently as possible in order to optimize<br/>
&gt; survival. So now it&#39;s easier and faster to get what they need from all the<br/>
&gt; processed, prepackaged, premade high fat, high calorie foods. It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; ill-intent. It&#39;s basic survival instinct. That&#39;s my opinion, anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805058274">+++Trusting children (or anyone) need not be an all or nothing deal.+++<br/>
<br/>
***Which is really what I was saying in the first place. The problem (I see) is there are a lot of unschoolers that claim it is all or nothing...or are so loose with the word *trust* that it seems that way.***<br/>
<br/>
Are you thinking about this in terms of kids doing whatever they want and the parents trusting them to do it and for all involved to be okay with it? <br/>
<br/>
If so, then I agree.  The thing about trust is that it really is one of those things that must go both ways.  Parents can trust kids to navigate their world, but kids also need to trust that their parents will be there to help them when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to understand where you are coming from here... <br/>
<br/>
+++Until then, I trust his intention to do well, or<br/>
I assume positive intention as Jeff Sabo recently put it in his blog +++<br/>
<br/>
***I prefer to not assume intent. I prefer to ask the person/child their intent, if it&#39;s even relevant.***<br/>
<br/>
Assuming positive intent is one the biggest aspects of parenting that needed to shift in order for me to be a better parent.  Not in all things of course.  If one of my kids is angry and hitting people, that&#39;s not a place of positive intent, but I can still assume that they&#39;d like to have a positive outcome and need help getting there.<br/>

I guess I don&#39;t understand, you *seem* to be saying. - I assume positive intent except when there isn&#39;t positive intent and that makes me a better parent.-<br/>

When a ball is coming toward you, do you always kick at it?  Always  <br/>

If you never assume any intent at all, then are you treating others  <br/>

&gt; there is no way to know what their intent is except to ask.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, boy. *That* would go over like a lead balloon in my house &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
Talking to my child in the heat of the moment (like Pam did *not* do  <br/>
with Roxana) would be the worst thing I could do. Maybe later would be  <br/>
okay, but I want to hear what she has to say, before I ask what she  <br/>
was intending. She can easily take what I say as blame, which can  <br/>
start the whole upset over before she&#39;s finished calming down.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly assume that Senna is trying to get her needs met (to be  <br/>
heard, perhaps) and may be going about it in a totally inappropriate  <br/>
manner. That often requires intervention of some sort (moving her out  <br/>
of the space;  many times, Senna stalks off, much like Pam&#39;s Roxana)  <br/>
to make sure others aren&#39;t hurt by words or actions. But I still think  <br/>
of her wanting a good outcome, so I try to help her with that.<br/>
<br/>
I do *not* assume she *wants* to be mean or loud or hurtful.  It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t always that way, though, when my need for approval from other  <br/>
parents caused me to assume that she had bad intentions. It affected  <br/>
my relationship with her; it&#39;s recovering.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see any good in assuming anything but I&#39;m open to hearing  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might be worth it to repeat more of Pam&#39;s words:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  The most important thing I did was really listen<br/>
&gt; to Roxana and really pay attention to what seemed to help and what<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t. Enlist the child&#39;s help - it isn&#39;t like the kid wants things  <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; be hard - kids want to be happy, too.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is part of assuming positive intent. That kids want to be happy,  <br/>
that they want to get along with others, that they want to do the  <br/>
right thing. Sometimes, they just don&#39;t know how or don&#39;t yet have the  <br/>
maturity to better handle situations or they have that &quot;hair-trigger&quot;  <br/>
emotional response.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; It feels a lot like the idea of blanket trust. Should I just trust  <br/>
&gt; intent is always positive? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think trust is important in knowing that your child, with your help,  <br/>
will eventually have better thought processing, will eventually  <br/>
mature, will eventually have better social skills. I don&#39;t think we  <br/>
can abdicate our responsibility to our children to help them, by  <br/>
trusting everything will just *happen*.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like trusting your child will know what they will need to know  <br/>
(in terms of &quot;academic&quot; learning, for instance) by giving them plenty  <br/>
of resources and tools and opportunities. If we lock them in an empty  <br/>
room and trust they&#39;ll learn those things, it&#39;s not going to happen.  <br/>
Oh, they&#39;ll learn something alright. Not to trust you to help them.  <br/>
Not to trust you to be there for them. Not to trust you to believe  <br/>
they are doing their best, and to help them do better.<br/>
<br/>
When unschoolers talk about trust, it&#39;s in the context of trusting in  <br/>
the learning process. That with all the opportunities and facilitation  <br/>
and help we can give them, they will learn. I think that applies to  <br/>
their lives in all aspects.<br/>

<br/>
All relationships involve assumptions.<br/>
I assume Keith will still be in the back room when I go back there,  <br/>
unless he comes up here or has gone for a walk.<br/>
If he goes for a walk, I assume he&#39;ll come back unless he&#39;s wounded or  <br/>
dead.<br/>
I have reason to believe he wants to come home.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is playing a game and singing along to a song he&#39;s playing on  <br/>
Pandora, on the Roku/TV.<br/>
I assume he&#39;s happy and comfortable.  I offered him food a bit ago,  <br/>
and he wasn&#39;t hungry.<br/>
I assume because of where he&#39;s sitting (and where he usually sits)  <br/>
that he&#39;s in that chair because the swamp cooler fan blows in that  <br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
I could go and confirm these assumptions, but it would be irritating  <br/>
to Marty and Keith.<br/>
<br/>
I know Keith as assuming I&#39;m going to keep heating the hot tub.  I  <br/>
told him I would. He assumes I&#39;ll remember, and that I&#39;ll do it.  I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want him to come and ask me if I mean to really do that.   <br/>
It&#39;s already above 90 degrees. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All these assumptions of mine are based on knowing these people well,  <br/>
and trusting them, and trusting my perceptions of them.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was little he was a lot like me, so we would guess that his  <br/>
preferences would be like mine, and were often right.<br/>
When Marty was little he was a lot like Keith, and often guessing  <br/>
Keith&#39;s preferences would be right (before Marty could communicate).<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was little she wasn&#39;t like either of us or like either  <br/>
sibling, so our guesses weren&#39;t right as often.  We had to guess more  <br/>
things, and be more aware of her responses and hints, until she could  <br/>
explain things.<br/>

<br/>
Say I&#39;ve got a 6-year-old (hypothetically :-) who is going through a time of being easily frustrated, during which he will hit, bite, or pull his older brother&#39;s hair with little or no apparent provocation. He will resort to punching before even _saying_ anything, like, &quot;Eric, please stop that.&quot; The first indication we have that he&#39;s mad is Wham! He&#39;s whacked his brother.<br/>
<br/>
We can see him as a mean, out-of-control kid and crack down on him. We can put him in time out when he hits, or we can take away a privilege, or cut his allowance. We can see this as flat-out Bad Behavior That Must Be Stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Or: we assume that Carl has a positive intent. That his positive intent is to get a need of his met. In this case, we still want to make sure he knows he shouldn&#39;t hit people (and believe me, he knows! He&#39;s not stupid! He&#39;s known since he was 2 that people don&#39;t like to be hit), but instead of trying to stop the behavior by punishing it, we try to stop it by figuring out to the best of our ability what need he has that isn&#39;t getting met, why he has this underlying frustration that is giving him this hair trigger, and what skill he is lacking that would let him find a more productive way to meet that need.<br/>
<br/>
[Disclaimer: we have not yet figured all of this out.]<br/>
<br/>
Attributing positive intent even to &quot;bad&quot; behaviors changes the parent-child dynamic dramatically. For the better, I think. It shifts the focus from behavior and punishment to support, help, skill-building, and relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s not a useful way to frame things for you. It has been for me.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;First level, humans need food, water, air and sleep. Without those, they just can&#39;t concern themselves with anything else.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The second level of human needs, according to Maslow, is safety and security. If they don&#39;t feel safe and trusting, they can&#39;t concern themselves with other things.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Third level is the need for love and belonging—friends, supportive family, some kind of feeling of being part of a social unit.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And that&#39;s part of trust. Trusting how human nature works and figuring<br/>
out ways to respond that are helpful.<br/>

&gt; what skill he is lacking that would let him find a more productive way to<br/>
&gt; meet that need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; [Disclaimer: we have not yet figured all of this out.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Attributing positive intent even to &quot;bad&quot; behaviors changes the parent-child<br/>
&gt; dynamic dramatically. For the better, I think. It shifts the focus from<br/>
&gt; behavior and punishment to support, help, skill-building, and relationship.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe that&#39;s not a useful way to frame things for you. It has been for me.<br/>

intentions would cause someone to respond similarly to assuming good  <br/>
intentions.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it&#39;s part of most people&#39;s natures to try to make  <br/>
connections between action and intent. It&#39;s a fundamental process of  <br/>
story telling to wonder why someone&#39;s doing something. If it&#39;s not  <br/>
part of your makeup, then it would be confusing why someone would want  <br/>
to assume anything.<br/>
<br/>
To not make assumptions I think would be unnatural for most people so  <br/>
it&#39;s better to replace it with a positive natural thing rather than a  <br/>
negative natural thing.<br/>

saying I assume anything about your specific reasons for doing <br/>

That&#39;s how I feel.<br/>

My assumption isn&#39;t the whole game.  My assumption is what I&#39;ll base  <br/>
my first move on.  Then the other person (my husband my child, someone  <br/>
on the list) makes their move.  Then I know more.<br/>
