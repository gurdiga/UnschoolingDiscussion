<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214089484">&lt;&lt;do you point out the spelling/grammar mistakes or not&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It depends on what your child wants.  Do they just want to share a story<br/>
they thought up?  Why spoil that by pointing out where they could have<br/>
&quot;improved&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Last year Adriane was applying to a program through 4-H and had to write an<br/>
essay.  When she gave it to me to read, before I even looked at it, I asked<br/>
her if she wanted help with spelling.  She said &quot;no, I think I&#39;ve got it<br/>
pretty good&quot;.  So we sent in an essay with a few words spelled creatively.<br/>
She was accepted into the program and felt good about doing it herself.<br/>

Well, if she wants to learn these things, why doesn&#39;t she?  You seem to be<br/>
posting that the critical difference is whether or not YOU imposed these<br/>
&quot;basics&quot; on her at a given time.  It is much easier for an 11yo to learn to<br/>
tell time than a 5yo.  If your dd wants to learn these things, what is<br/>
keeping her from doing that?<br/>

While age does usually make learning something easier, a child with a learning dis-ability may not find it any easier at 10 than at 5.  I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s my dd&#39;s problem exactly... there&#39;s been no testing and diagnosis of &quot;x&quot; disorder as I don&#39;t see why I should put her through all that if we can help it. <br/>
I didn&#39;t find any helpful information in your response to my post  but I did sense a lot of annoyance. Is there a problem?<br/>

<br/>
I agree. In the past when I&#39;ve been insecure and letting all that school <br/>
mentality creep through, I&#39;ve corrected their spelling in stories that they <br/>
write. Eventually they quit writing. They quit sharing. It took nearly a <br/>
year before their natural creativity took over and they started writing <br/>
again. They still have some stuff they won&#39;t show me. I feel that it&#39;s out <br/>
of fear I might point out gammar mistakes. All I managed to do is teach them <br/>
that somethings have more value than others.<br/>
Learn from others but go to your own school<br/>

reading &quot;problems&quot; in the posts where people pose questions to you and <br/>
&quot;challenge&quot; you (for lack of a better term). It appears that you may be a bit <br/>
defensive. I always find it helpful when my hackles get raised by something <br/>
someone said, to check my own reactions because there is most often a clue <br/>
there for me. It&#39;s free advice. . . feel free to ponder or discard. :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s best if personal irritations are sent off list.<br/>
<br/>
No one has a posting style that is universally loved. Some of us have<br/>
posting styles that irk some people. Some of us have *personalities* that<br/>
irk some people. ;-) If we are bothered by a trend of a fair number of<br/>
people getting irked, then it&#39;s problably something we&#39;re doing and we can<br/>
try to figure out what we&#39;re doing to cause that. If it&#39;s isolated people<br/>
getting irked, then we can chalk it up to it being their problem and we can<br/>
just ignore them. But we can&#39;t change other people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lots of helpful ideas and suggestions and only a *few* who have offered<br/>
&gt; empty-minded posts. Refreshing...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And perhaps in terms of community building if we find some people of less<br/>
help to us than others then we can just take what we liked and leave what we<br/>
didn&#39;t find helpful for someone else?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s helpful to picture our best friend saying with a gentle smile<br/>
what&#39;s being said. Too often words stripped of body language lose a lot of<br/>
what someone is trying to communicate.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hear where you&#39;re coming from, Sarah.  I&#39;ve been through much the same <br/>
scenario with my son, except that he didn&#39;t seem to want to learn.  He <br/>
certainly never asked for help, but I often wondered if that was because he <br/>
had already decided that he was &quot;too stupid&quot; to learn it.  (Yes, even <br/>
unschooled kids can end up feeling stupid when they have trouble learning <br/>
something.)  In fact, the main reason I panicked and decided to push him <br/>
(at age 12) was because someone told me about an unschooling family that <br/>
discovered all their children were dyslexic when the oldest was 14.  The <br/>
mother had felt guilty about not trying to do something about it earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t know the answer.  The testing for dyslexia is very expensive, <br/>
and my son doesn&#39;t want to go through it anyway.  For the last few months, <br/>
I&#39;ve just let him be, and I got more support for doing that here.  He does <br/>
seem to be able to read his bike magazines and web pages about bikes.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t read anywhere near fast enough to read novels.  I would just assume <br/>
he was more interested in non-fiction, but he still loves to have novels <br/>
read to him.  (We just finished Goblet of Fire for the second time.)<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

and does (expensive I suppose) testing and therapy.  His description of how his mind functions<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936272731">The head of OT was a real neat gal and we talked about the age thing.  I<br/>
think from those discussions that younger was easier also because with young<br/>
kids it isn&#39;t necessarily viewed as &quot;work&quot; but can be viewed as &quot;play.&quot;<br/>
With older kids, particularly those that have been in kiddy prison, almost<br/>
anything, even help seems to have a negative connotation.<br/>
