&lt;&lt; And I sure don&#39;t miss the humidity down there! People here in Kansas <br/>
actually complain when the humidity here gets to 40%!! Can you imagine?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH yes.<br/>
Eastern Kansas is like a swamp to me.<br/>
Western Kansas not so.<br/>
<br/>
I think Louisiana would kill me.  But I adore the music.  It&#39;s not available <br/>
live in Albuquerque, but at least we don&#39;t have humidity! &lt;g&gt;  I listened to <br/>
the BoneTones (Bontons, but I think they spelled it &quot;in English&quot; &lt;g&gt;) in <br/>
Minneapolis at the Minnesota State Fair for hours one day, turning down all <br/>
offers to see other parts of the fair.  I wasn&#39;t leaving as long as they were <br/>
playing.  <br/>
