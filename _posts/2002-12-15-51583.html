 </span></blockquote>Well it depends what your goal is in journaling. If your goal is to go back<br/>
and be able to see progress then the way you&#39;re doing it isn&#39;t meeting your<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
But if your goal is to release some emotions onto paper and you do feel<br/>
better when you&#39;re done, then you&#39;re meeting your goal.<br/>
<br/>
School is about doing things *the* right way. Real life is about whether<br/>
what we&#39;re doing works or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t talking about journaling so much as suggesting that a strong, <br/>
opinionated early post to this list should be saved for a couple of years and <br/>
looked at again, because the writer would feel differently about it then.<br/>
<br/>
The answer was &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t hurt me; it hurts the person unwilling to keep a sample of early <br/>
thought and work for comparison after she has a few years&#39; experience, and <br/>
older kids, and can look back to see how far she&#39;s come.  <br/>
<br/>
Posts on list like this can become &quot;journalling&quot; when we&#39;re talking about <br/>
what our kids did yesterday.  I&#39;ve lifted several posts and put them in my <br/>
diary whole as a record of a day.  But the way I word things, and my ideas <br/>
about why something happened and the effect it might have are MY thoughts, <br/>
not my childrens&#39; final uses of those experiences.  So years later I look at <br/>
things like that and think &quot;Huh! I wasn&#39;t as confident then,&quot; or &quot;I still saw <br/>
that as worthy of attention because it&#39;s a school thing,&quot; or whatever.<br/>
