<br/>
&gt;Well, we gave our kid a $5 allowance.  They fly with their ability to spend,<br/>
&gt;combine, and save their money.  They learned to count by 2 and 3&#39;s while<br/>
&gt;separating their $5 into piles. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same here.  Five bucks a week.  Two&#39;s are easy, even with very little kids. <br/>
Just get in the habit of counting steps while you walk together, then either<br/>
start skipping the &quot;left&quot; steps (or right if you are left-footed &lt;g&gt;) or<br/>
alternate, you say &quot;one&quot; child says &quot;two&quot; you say &quot;three&quot; child says &quot;four&quot;<br/>
and so on.  It doesn&#39;t have to be lessony--it&#39;s really a very natural<br/>
rhythm.<br/>
