Thanks for sharing you life with us.  My kids are 3 and 1 so we are not <br/>
pressured with any schooling ideas, yet.  I have noticed that when I write in <br/>
my journal about the things that we did during the day that I feel better <br/>
that I am already giving my kids a good start on their education. For <br/>
example, each time we take the dog for a walk and my dd picks flower weeds I <br/>
have to explain why they are going to die, (stems to roots to that is how <br/>
they eat...ect.ect.ect...)<br/>
<br/>
just my thoughts...<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

&quot;It helps me to remember that people are more important than ideas and that <br/>
being kind is more important than being right.&quot; <br/>
