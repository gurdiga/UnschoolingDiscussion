<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055163019">I read but rarely post.  But I think it is time that I do so.  Recently, my son (6) and I were in <br/>
a restaurant with a friend.  He wanted multiple plates of food, since each food was to be <br/>
on a different plate.  I supported and assisted him with that.  He also brought back <br/>
multiple forks, spoons and knives.  At this point I noticed my new friend glancing at all of <br/>
this activity and I began to hear old tapes in my head like she thinks he has too much <br/>
silverware, the restaurant  will not like this, now all of this silverware needs to be washed.  <br/>
At the end of the meal, not thinking, when the waitress came over I picked up my plates <br/>
and scooped up the silverware from next to me on the booth seat.  Retrospectively I I had <br/>
allowed anxiety to develop due to what I was imagining others thought about what was <br/>
going on with my son and then with me that I was not forcing him to stop this behavior.  I <br/>
try to explain to him what people expect in public.  (He frequently likes to pour slat and <br/>
pepper together, mix water in some other things in front of him on the table, etc.  IN <br/>
genreal I delight in his creative exploration.  But when out ion public if I feel that someone <br/>
else is watching, I begin to squirm.  But to continue, after I had picked up the silverware, <br/>
he rightly became upset and went up to where the silverware was and began taking now <br/>
large handfuls of each utensil again.  I was feeling embarrassed and out of control. I know <br/>
I am working and striving not to be in control as I want to honor his decisions even if they <br/>
are not mine.  But I am having trouble when the behavior begins to have others turn and <br/>
stare and my trying to speak to him quietly about my regret of taking his silverware, and <br/>
that the silverware was to be used in the restaurant for multiple people, his behavior got <br/>
more insistent and seemed to grow larger.  I am still so new.  I know I am making a ton of <br/>
mistakes.  I am open to all feedback and I would also appreciate the support of knowing <br/>
others have either been there or are also struggling with something similar.  Joanne O&#39;N.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771570324">The link was very helpful with concrete suggestions for how to communicate well as the <br/>
parent.   It was very funny that the example was about a child playing with sugar cubes.  I <br/>
would recommend it for anyone else who is struggling with a similar challenge.   Thank you!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-352695313">We used to take toys and coloring stuff to restaurants.  What belongs  <br/>
to the restaurant isn&#39;t free to be played with, but what parents  <br/>
bring is.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible for kids to be too young and rambunctious for staid- <br/>
kinds-of public places.  If a parent whose kids NEEDS to touch and  <br/>
run goes to a tablecloth restaurant instead of a Burger King with a  <br/>
playground, that&#39;s a parental misjudgment.  IF a parent doesn&#39;t take  <br/>
things for the child to do and play with, that&#39;s a failure on the  <br/>
part of the parent.<br/>
<br/>
If a chlld wants to play with sugar cubes, buy a box on the way  <br/>
home!  There are cool things to do with them.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants to play with silverware (more than the few settings  <br/>
around him) bring all yours out at the house.  Practice launching  <br/>
forks, or making triangles with table knives or seeing your face in  <br/>
different spoons.<br/>
<br/>
Not everything a child wants to do is okay, not when it involves  <br/>
other people&#39;s stuff, space, and privacy.<br/>
<br/>
When one of our kids left a mess, I left a bigger tip to help  <br/>
compensate for it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
