<div id="ygrps-yiv-900926192">Does anyone have any experience with this? Sarah is interested, having met and talked with a couple girls who participate. I was a cheerleader in school but never did Pop Warner. The local Club is just too expensive as she&#39;d have to take two separate classes, one in cheer and one in tumbling at $65 each. <br/>
 <br/>
Do they follow the local schoolyear schedule or is it summers-only? I know they send home notices through the schools, but that doesn&#39;t help us much!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
My daughter did this years ago.  It wasn&#39;t any more expensive than the rec <br/>
league football, baseball etc.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is on an All-Star National competition squad now.  THAT costs BIG <br/>
money.  About three or four thousand dollars a season, with uniforms, travel <br/>
expenses and gym fees.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness they fund raise a big portion of it They compete in FL, SC, TX <br/>
and of course DC, MD and VA.  So lots of travel adds up quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Tumbling classes are important if she wants to cheerlead competitively later. <br/>
 My girls didn&#39;t do gymnastics and then have had to &quot;learn&quot; to tumble at <br/>
later ages and it seems to take longer than when the younger ones learn it. Guess <br/>
the older you are, the more fear you have about throwing yourself over <br/>
backwards and landing on your feet.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,  have FUN!<br/>
