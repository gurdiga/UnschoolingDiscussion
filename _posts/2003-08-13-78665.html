Ann: Debate about HR 2732/S 1562 is growing. <br/>
<br/>
HSLDA, Virginia, August 11<br/>

Headline:  S. 1562 - Home School Non-Discrimination Act of 2003 (HONDA)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;HSLDA supports S. 1562. There are currently several areas of federal <br/>
law that unfairly impact home education. Congress must pass the <br/>
Homeschool Non-Discrimination Act (HONDA) to remedy this unfair <br/>
treatment.&quot;<br/>

NHEN Forums, Sandi Chelan, August 11<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/forum/post.asp?method=Reply&TOPIC_ID=454&FORUM_ID=31">http://www.nhen.org/forum/post.asp?method=Reply&TOPIC_ID=454&FORUM_ID=31</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;...Though most of us never asked (or paid for) HSLDA to act as our <br/>
legal or political emissary, their self-initiated role as <br/>
representatives of homeschooling, often results in consequences for <br/>
all homeschoolers in terms of political fallout and public <br/>
misconceptions about homeschooling.&quot; <br/>
Sandi sums up her opposition to the bill this way:  &quot;By creating the <br/>
opening for the federal definition of homeschooling through <br/>
legislation such as HR 2732, we would allow for the future <br/>
restriction of homeschooling autonomy by government fiat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ann:  Shouldn&#39;t every homeschooler be worried about political fallout <br/>
and potential backlash against homeschoolers if this legislation <br/>
passes?  Shouldn&#39;t we be looking at those &quot;small, innocent-looking <br/>
steps&quot;* with a jaundiced eye?<br/>

WorldNetDaily.com, Exclusive Commentary By Kyle Williams, August 09<br/>

Headline: Government Butts into Homeschool<br/>
&quot;Generally, government doesn&#39;t outright intrude into the private <br/>
lives of citizens. It takes small, innocent-looking steps.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ann:  In his Commentary, Williams attacks Florida&#39;s mega-contracts <br/>
with K12 and Connections Academy (cited here last week, see <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/02/State/Public_funding_launch.shtml">http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/02/State/Public_funding_launch.shtml</a> ) <br/>
as a violation of &quot;the true spirit of home education.&quot; <br/>

HEM News & Commentary is a weekly report on what&#39;s happening in the <br/>
world of homeschooling. Gleanings from the news media, accolades and <br/>
pans, hot discussions, legal and legislative successes and problems - <br/>
all are fair game, and gathered in one column for your convenience.<br/>
<br/>
And just in case you don&#39;t have the time to read every word in print, <br/>
we will summarize and discuss key news and trends that we think are <br/>
the most provocative or that may have the greatest impact on the <br/>
future of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This service is available free. Archives can be accessed at<br/>

<br/>
The weekly updates will additionally be announced on HEM&#39;s discussion <br/>
lists. You&#39;ll find a print version - the highlights of these reports <br/>
- in a column by the same name in Home Education Magazine.<br/>
