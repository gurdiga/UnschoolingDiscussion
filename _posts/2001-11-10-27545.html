This was very well put.  I&#39;ve avoided posting here because I have too<br/>
much going on, am in too much pain and am too worried and moody to get<br/>
into another discussion.  But while I have a minute . . . <br/>
<br/>
. . . The good news is, after a long and concerted effort here, Wyndham<br/>
is finally learning to police his own TV watching.  He has finally taken<br/>
some control for himself and it is great.  We still have to monitor a<br/>
little bit and force the issue occassionally, but those times are<br/>
becoming fewer and far between.  What do I think changed things?  One<br/>
reason is a friend who does not watch much TV at all.  He saw by example<br/>
how much stuff there is to do. And Two, the constant control by his<br/>
guardians allowed him to see that he could do all that stuff at home too.<br/>
 We didn&#39;t limit TV a lot.  In fact I think he probably watches more than<br/>
anyone else in the family still, but he does get away from it on his own<br/>
occassionally too.  So there are signs of hope, hope that he will get the<br/>
obsession under control himself.<br/>
<br/>
. . . We are walking talking evidence that everyone does not respond to<br/>
the same things in the same ways.  My girls have never had nor needed to<br/>
have their TV limited.  In 6 1/2 years, we&#39;ve no organized schoolwork - I<br/>
just gave them books and workbooks and took them places (Museums and<br/>
science centers are not &quot;schoolwork&quot; they are somethig we all do for<br/>
fun.)   This year for the first time we have set up some real structure<br/>
to the family jobs and they did ask for some changes to it and got them. <br/>
Sorry, I drifted there.  Anyway, they are now taking a chem class with a<br/>
group of homeschoolers (yes they wanted too) and they are doing just as<br/>
well as the others who have had much more structure through the years.<br/>
<br/>
. . . Tara, the only encouragement I can offer is to tell you to trust<br/>
your own feelings.  If you think your child needs help turning of the<br/>
tube, then give it.  Don&#39;t get upset and yell even if you are being<br/>
yelled at, don&#39;t lie about it - but disconnect it if you have to and most<br/>
importantly, be consistent and upfront about it.  Figure out what he<br/>
WANTS to watch and make sure he gets to see those shows.  A big part of<br/>
the problem with Wyndham was that he didn&#39;t know when his shows were<br/>
going to be on, so now we go through the guide and show him and promise<br/>
to remind him.<br/>
