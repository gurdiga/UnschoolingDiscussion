<br/>
&lt;&lt; But boys get their curiosity blocked because there isn&#39;t any<br/>
acceptable &quot;pornography&quot; for boys. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s &quot;acceptable&quot; or not, there is a fair amount of written <br/>
fanfiction involving characters from comic book series, fantasy series, and <br/>
even video games.  Some of it is just adventure/romance, and some is at least <br/>
as graphic as romance novels.   Maybe it&#39;s for and by girls, though, I don&#39;t <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Two nights ago I wanted to play Destruct-o-Match on Neopets.  Both Marty (14) <br/>
and Holly (11) play Neopets, and I have an account (just so I can play that <br/>
pattern-falling cascading game myself without having to ask Marty) and our <br/>
Mac Powerstrip we use to get to recent files, recent programs, recent sites <br/>
was FULL of porn stuff.  I didn&#39;t open any, the titles themselves were gross <br/>
enough.    OH!!  I had wanted to get to Netflix to cancel getting a DVD I had <br/>
just rented (which didn&#39;t work).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, usually I use it to get to Neopets games page.<br/>
<br/>
I called Marty in, and said &quot;Marty, this is a bit much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;Most of it was pop-ups mom, I didn&#39;t really look at it all much.  <br/>
Just some.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked him if he could cover those kinds of trails over so I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
know and so Holly wouldn&#39;t accidently see.  I said he needed to open a bunch <br/>
of CLEAN websites and look at some better stuff so that would be on the <br/>
trail.   He told me he could delete the trail.  I said I didn&#39;t think he <br/>
could, that I had even asked Leon, one of the developers, who said it only <br/>
works on the Mac OSX version, not 9.<br/>
<br/>
But Marty is a teenaged boy, so besides his porn curiosity he has a computer <br/>
facility.  And he figured out a three-step process to erase that list through <br/>
Internet Explorer.<br/>
<br/>
If I say &quot;NO, never ever even look,&quot; I risk losing the communication we have <br/>
within which he will just tell me what he&#39;s seen and knows and where it came <br/>
from.   <br/>
<br/>
But that story has gone two days now.  At first he was embarrassed and &quot;Mom, <br/>
okay, I know, don&#39;t talk to me about it anymore.&quot;  So I said I wanted to talk <br/>
to him one more time the next day, about whether he knows the reasons people <br/>
object to kids looking at porn.  <br/>
<br/>
The next day came and had nearly passed without me remembering, when he came <br/>
and said, &quot;Okay, mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;You wanted to talk to me about porn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh!  Thanks.  I hadn&#39;t remembered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I asked if he knew the objections.  He said no.  I said, &quot;In all your <br/>
reading and listening you haven&#39;t heard objections to porn?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, that its illegal for me to see it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I talked to him about degradation of women, about creating unhealthy and <br/>
unreasonable expectations in marriages, and that normal sex wasn&#39;t like that. <br/>
 He said &quot;Well, DUH, mom!&quot;  I said some people were messed up by WANTING it <br/>
to be.  He seemed surprised that that could happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I told him that some of those who are filmed are not quite volunteers and <br/>
told him two stories, one of the mom of girls his age he&#39;s known his whole <br/>
life, who was photographed as a kid for posed stills which were sold out of <br/>
Oklahoma.  It was shocking for him, and I don&#39;t know much detail, but naming <br/>
a person he knew who had been victimized was effective.    I told him of a <br/>
drug dealer and illegal snake importer my younger half-brother had taken up <br/>
with some years back, who videod him and his then-girlfriend, and used it as <br/>
blackmail (she was from a Mormon family) to get them to deliver drugs for him.<br/>
<br/>
Then I said I didn&#39;t think it was the most horrible thing people could do, to <br/>
look at pictures, but he REALLY needed to be careful because it&#39;s illegal and <br/>
I didn&#39;t want the county coming to talk to me about anything they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
(I had a similar moment with Holly later that evening about going outside in <br/>
a teensy fancy t-shirt and nylon pajama pants, no shoes, in January, while <br/>
she has a sore throat.   &quot;Illegal,&quot; I told her, for parents to allow that, <br/>
and let&#39;s not draw attention to a loose lifestyle by being outside in the <br/>
cold without proper attire.)<br/>
<br/>
I told Marty that women tend to prefer word-porn and so they don&#39;t get <br/>
caught, but pictures were easy to find and more offensive.<br/>
<br/>
I told him one danger was obsession.  I didn&#39;t go into that much, because <br/>
some of the original arguments about obsession were the cost.  I did have a <br/>
friend years ago who had a large collection of porn videos that had cost him <br/>
$60 to $80 apiece.  Had he had the internet, his obsession wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
ruined his finances, nor left a mountain of evidence to shock his mom.   <br/>
(That friend had a sex change operation since then, so I think it was his way <br/>
of dealing with deeper psychological and biological situations, and that was <br/>
way too much to tell Marty.)  <br/>
<br/>
Then I asked him if he had ANY idea how much trouble some other boys his age <br/>
would get into if their parents caught them having looked at that kind of <br/>
stuff on the computer.  He said &quot;Lots?&quot;  I talked about loss of computer <br/>
accesss, grounding, and physical spanking by some big grown man.<br/>
<br/>
He said he had been mostly embarrassed when I first talked to him because he <br/>
had had friends in the house.  They couldn&#39;t hear us, but he had to leave <br/>
where they were, talk to me, and go back in there, and it just embarrassed <br/>
him.  I said in those worst-case situations, the parents would have called <br/>
all of the friends&#39; parents, said to come get them, told them why, and some <br/>
of THEM would have been grounded and in trouble just for hanging out with <br/>
someone who had looked at porn.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt he really fully believes me on those things, or maybe he can&#39;t fathom <br/>
a parent doing that to a child.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind having a kid who can&#39;t readily imagine being hit by an angry, <br/>
grown man or can&#39;t imagine being told &quot;You stay in your room for a month and <br/>
don&#39;t even touch a computer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who has read this far and is offended, I didn&#39;t mean to throw this <br/>
out to offend anyone.  It&#39;s a candid, current situation involving a real teen.<br/>
<br/>
And usually the trail on this real teen&#39;s internet use has Neopets, AoN (a <br/>
role-playing game), humor sites, and in-person friends&#39; journals.   People <br/>
who know Marty wouldn&#39;t think of him as a nasty kid.  He&#39;s not.  He is coming <br/>
into adulthood, though, and he&#39;s curious.  <br/>
<br/>
I think similar to make-up, if it is declared &quot;only for adults,&quot; and a girl <br/>
waits and waits and WAITS until she can use it and is then unlikely to just <br/>
let it go unused, a boy who is slapped away from any glimpse of nudity until <br/>
he&#39;s eighteen is GOING to immerse himself in his newfound access for a while <br/>
the moment he gets a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I were out grocery shopping, and talking about Kirby turning <br/>
seventeen this year.  I said I used to want to have a big eighteenth birthday <br/>
celebration for him, like a graduation, but I no longer want to do that.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want to declare an end to his learning, nor to his living with us if he <br/>
wants to stay.   Keith said he had no ideas either, but that was fine.  Said <br/>
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to get him drunk and take him to a whorehouse, so <br/>
there&#39;s probably going to be no rite of passage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby wouldn&#39;t want any of that anyway.  ANOTHER good thing.  When he turns <br/>
eighteen, he&#39;ll have more legal rights, but there won&#39;t be the effect of huge <br/>
tension released.  He&#39;ll have no restrictions suddenly lifted.  <br/>
<br/>
I know this won&#39;t suit everyone&#39;s belief system, but it is working with us to <br/>
produce mature, calm, considerate, communicative teenaged boys.  They&#39;re not <br/>
angry with us, they&#39;re not reactionary, they&#39;re not sneaky.<br/>

when they are older.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 year old saw someone spank a child on TV.  It didn&#39;t show the spanking <br/>
but showed them getting into position and went to the outside of the house <br/>
and you heard the rest.  It was a sitcom.  He looked at me and said &quot;that&#39;s <br/>
terrible, why would she do that&quot;  There was also laughing in the background <br/>
(supposed to be like the child deserved it) he said &quot;That isn&#39;t funny&quot;  I <br/>
agreed. I like that my boys are shocked and find it hard to imagine those <br/>
situations.  Good opportunity for discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700211269">To Sandra:<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for such a candid and helpful post. I want to share it <br/>
with my son (the gist of it). Same as youwe have excellent <br/>
lines of communication open between us at this point. And I <br/>
want so much for that to remain the case. I&#39;ve shared about the <br/>
demeaning aspects of porn and the dangers of it becoming an <br/>
obsession.<br/>
<br/>
My dh has shared that he believes that when the family is <br/>
unhealthy, porn more likely beomces an addiction to fill a hole. <br/>
For kids from heathly families, it is more likely a form of curiosity. <br/>
The growth of the Internet is what makes it so much more <br/>
accessible and &quot;hardcore&quot; than it was when our husbands <br/>
snuck copies of Playboy with airbrushed centerfolds.<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate hearing how you&#39;ve dealt with so many of the <br/>
issues I&#39;ve raised. Your perspective and style of interaacting with <br/>
your kids is refreshing and gives me hope.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking so much time to write that all out.<br/>

<br/>
The stories are so different from how I was raised and it really is so<br/>
nice to hear<br/>

their children this<br/>
way.    This and a few other places are my only sources.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me toss out a &quot;me, too&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
While I was raised by nice parents who did a lot of discussing, and not<br/>
a lot of controlling, it&#39;s still beneficial for me to hear detailed,<br/>
real stories about parent-child interaction.  I may not be a LONG way<br/>
away from being the parent I want to be, but I&#39;m a little way away from<br/>
it, and don&#39;t run into too many good role models IRL that share my philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
It helped in our house, one late night, when my son wanted more food<br/>
before going to bed.  I think he wanted a cheese stick from the<br/>
refrigerator.  I said &quot;sure, go get it&quot;, but he hemmed and hawed and<br/>
shuffled his feet.  Because we had just been discussing topics like this<br/>
on the list, I asked him &quot;would it taste better if I got it for you?&quot;<br/>
and he said &quot;yes&quot; and seemed pleased and relieved.  Without reminders<br/>
here that it&#39;s okay to indulgently love him and cater to him, I would be<br/>
more inclined to be pushing for &quot;independence&quot;, especially in areas<br/>
where he&#39;s &quot;behind&quot; the average kid.  (e.g. making his own sandwiches<br/>
and cereal.)<br/>

Thank you for sharing your story.  It is helpful to hear other <br/>
unschoolers describe how they handle difficult situations like these.<br/>
<br/>
I always strive to give my kids real information and real reasons for <br/>
why they should act in their own best interests.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they listen, sometimes they don&#39;t, even when they really <br/>
understand the reasons behind my requests.  But I have recently <br/>
realized that sometimes kids rebel against *society*, not their home <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
What does a parent do in *that* situation??!!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  But I have recently <br/>
realized that sometimes kids rebel against *society*, not their home <br/>

<br/>
I guess it depends whether the parents identify with and squarely defend that <br/>
