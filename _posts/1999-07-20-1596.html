 </span></blockquote>Hi.  I am brand new to this list.  I have 4 children, Adam 13, Greg 11, <br/>
Sheila 7 and Amy 5.  This past year was our first year of homeschooling, and <br/>
after some trial and error, I have decided that unschooling is the way for us <br/>
to go this next year.  Edison is my son, Greg&#39;s, hero, and I live in New <br/>
Jersey, but have never heard of the Glenmont estate!  Could you please send <br/>
me some information on this?  We&#39;re probably really close to it and I know it <br/>
would be a thrill for Greg.  Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes,  There&#39;s so much there.... I think 10 and twelve year olds would find<br/>
plenty to love!   On the top floor,  there&#39;s an &#39;exhibit&#39; by Dow,  which<br/>
includes &quot;rock climbing&quot; (You&#39;ve got to sign up EARLY for this....it fills<br/>
up fast!)  You have to be at least 7 - I think - to sign up.<br/>
Usually there&#39;s a moving exhibit on the second floor.  I have found these<br/>
generally geared toward bigger children.<br/>
On the fourth floor,  there&#39;s a place to do an archaeological dig (again you<br/>
must sign up to do it - I think programs run each hour.<br/>
They&#39;ve got a planetarium,  an Omnimax theater...as someone mentioned<br/>
earlier,  the clock in the lobby is absolutely fascinating.  There&#39;s also a<br/>
theater....so there is likely to be some production going on (some focus on<br/>
a younger crowd so check ahead.)......I could go on and on!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Parking&#39;s ok if you go early.  There&#39;s a lot adjacent to the museum as well<br/>
as one acroos the street.  If you end up at the far end of the lot,  you&#39;ve<br/>
got a little trek (if you&#39;re 93 or under 4 yo),  not bad at all if you&#39;ve<br/>
got a wheelchair.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if they have WCs to rent.  There are elevators.  You go up and<br/>
down ramps to the various floors,  but I think it would be a major workout<br/>
to push a wc more than one floor.  I&#39;d reccomend using the elevator.<br/>
As for doing a little bit....that&#39;s a tough one.  I guess would depend on<br/>
the children.  But as you can tell from the excitement in everyone&#39;s<br/>
e-mails....it&#39;s a place you CAN spend LOTS of time!<br/>
Wonder if it might work if you find out what&#39;s going on (i.e., special<br/>
exhibits,  Omnimax, etc.)  and just focus on one or two rooms???  But if you<br/>
even walk around much ,  they&#39;ll see things they may want to check out.<br/>
Good Luck! Susan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739549858">My suggestion on parking is to try to go during the week.  That will make<br/>
it a cinch.  Avoid the weekends if at all possible.<br/>
Other good places to go in Indpls include Conner Prairie, the Eiteljorg<br/>
Museum of Indian History,  The Indiana State Historical Museum, The James<br/>
Whitcomb Riley home in Lockerbie Square, the Indpls Zoo, and the Indpls<br/>
Museum of Art (IMA).  The IMA was a pleasant surprise.  I understand that<br/>
it is the sixth largest art museum in the country.  Our children enjoyed it<br/>
quite a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212503655">Yeah, very well suited for 10-12 yo.  I agree, the Dow science center on the <br/>
top floor would be great. If their interested in history, try the fourth <br/>
floor&#39;s exhibit: Moments in History (I think); sign up early for the <br/>
artifact dig....<br/>
The traveling exhibit on the third floor is mechanical dinosaurs...lots of <br/>
levers & pulleys.<br/>
Pack a lunch/picnic; food is expensive (McDonalds isn&#39;t even cheap; even a <br/>
cup of water costs a quarter)<br/>

Would those who have actualy been say that the museum is welll suited for 10<br/>
and 12 year olds.  I know the Children&#39;s Museum here in Cleveland really<br/>
stinks and my boys outgrew it years ago.  I would like to find a place<br/>
worthwhile that would suit their ages and interest.  and we are about due to<br/>
get out of state here again real soon.<br/>

Gettysburg was incredibly touching and moving for me.  Especially when we<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535493090">(even some week days are packed, with &quot;school groups&quot; & camps)<br/>
Parking:  they have a drop off area right in front.  There&#39;s a huge open <br/>
area-they usually have a tent set up; an anklysaurus to climb on; a pond <br/>
with a bridge and several garden spots.  G-Ma & the older kids can explore <br/>
the outside &quot;exhibits&quot; while you go park.<br/>
<br/>
There are actually two sets of elevators.  They do have wheelchairs and <br/>
strollers for rent; it&#39;s a very wheel friendly place.<br/>
<br/>
If you go for part of the day, I&#39;d recommend having a plan (ck out their <br/>
website-they should have all the exhibits listed).  It&#39;s very overwhelming <br/>
when you first enter.<br/>
<br/>
The Lilly Theater and the Planetarium are now free, but you do need tickets. <br/>
  The booth is also down stairs at the end of the ramp; get them early, as <br/>
the shows do fill up...<br/>
<br/>
The relatively new OmniMax Dome Theater is not cheap.  But it&#39;s always an <br/>
extraordinary show.  Sitting reclined with the screen all around you is an <br/>
amazing experience.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much you see, or how little, or even how often you see <br/>
it...it&#39;s never a dissapointment.  (we&#39;ve had memberships for the past 6 <br/>
years)<br/>

As I recall, the parking is excellent, but kinda far away from the entrance.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know about wheelchairs because we didn&#39;t have any use for them.  <br/>
About doing a little....yes, I guess you could; but then you&#39;ll have unhappy <br/>
kids and a guilty grandma!  I really think this is something you should do <br/>
just for the kids....it would be too much for your grandma, IMO.<br/>
