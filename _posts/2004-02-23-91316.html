My mother has a sign in her house that says &quot;My house was clean <br/>
yesterday.  Sorry you missed it.&quot;</div>

I love this...I think it struck a cord with me because, earilier <br/>
today my DD asked me to play a computer game with her and I told her <br/>
that I &quot;had&quot; to clean the kitchen first.  I got halfway between the <br/>
computer and the kitchen, stopped, turned around, went back, told <br/>
her I was sorry that the kitchen could wait, and played her game <br/>
with her.  She was so happy that I didn&#39;t care if the dishes rotted <br/>
in the sink!  :)  She only played for about 5 minutes but, I know <br/>
that it will stick with her, that I found HER more important than <br/>
the housework.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is so sweet.  Sometimes, at a local play group, we talk about housework. <br/>
 It is so hard for some moms to see that.  I told a Mom yesterday, when she <br/>
said that having fun was way down on her list, that fun needs to be at the top. <br/>
 Her children smiled and agreed.  <br/>
<br/>
That same Mom then turned around and scolded her one daughter for not wanting <br/>
to leave play group and told her she would have to sit time out at play group <br/>
next week for not being fast enough in getting ready to leave this time.<br/>

This reminds me of our last playgroup, nothing like this happened <br/>
though I have seen moms get upset because the child wants to stay <br/>
longer at the park.  My goodness, what difference does in make if we <br/>
stay at the park for another half an hour?  I try to make sure that <br/>
I don&#39;t have any other, pressing, things to do during a play group <br/>
day, just in case Karen wants to stay for a while.<br/>
<br/>
But, on to my point, during the last play group, Karen was at the <br/>
door, with her shoes on yelling &quot;come on mom, it&#39;s time to go to <br/>
Nana and Papa&#39;s house.&quot;  I was the one not wanting to leave, I was <br/>
having a good time drinking coffee and catching up with <br/>
everyone.  :)  Alas, after a minute and her opening the door and <br/>
draging me out, we made it to Nana and Papa&#39;s. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t know what that family may have going.  We have a park day that we<br/>
love.  But with 5 kids, somebody always has something they need to do.  So<br/>
we can go to parkday, but we need to leave by a certain time.  It is all<br/>
agreed upon and discussed ahead of time.  Still, sometimes the kids would<br/>
rather stay and play....all except the one who has something else planned<br/>
afterward.  I can be unfair to the child with something planned.....or I can<br/>
sometimes make a child leave when they agreed to even though they don&#39;t want<br/>
to now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In our case, with four girls, all different ages, it really depends on our <br/>
schedule. We often do have to leave an event at certain time, to get to the <br/>
next event on time.<br/>
<br/>
I let the girls know ahead of time when this is happening, though... &quot;When <br/>
I say we have ten more minutes, that&#39;s ALL we have, so get ready to go at <br/>
that time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re on a looser schedule, I usually give them a 1/2 hour warning, then <br/>
15 minutes, etc. One of my girls, especially, does better when it&#39;s not an <br/>
abrupt &quot;It&#39;s time to go right now&quot; with no warning. Giving her a countdown <br/>
works well for her attitude toward leaving.<br/>
<br/>
And it still usually stretches longer, as gathering my girls is somewhat <br/>
like gathering marbles... by the time you get one together, the others have <br/>
rolled off elsewhere ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I started doing this recently (maybe about 3 or so months ago) with <br/>
my DD.  I started it because she always wants to pet her dog after <br/>
dark which means that the back door is open and it is COLD.  So, I <br/>
give her 5 to 15 minutes (depending on how cold) and count down for <br/>
her.  Before, when I would just tell her to give the dog a kiss and <br/>
close the door, it was always a fight.  Now, as long as I give her <br/>
warning of what is coming and how long she has, I haven&#39;t had a <br/>
problem.  <br/>
<br/>
We were at my in-laws house the other night and she was running <br/>
around like crazy at 10 pm.  I knew that she was just over-tired <br/>
and, as soon as she stopped moving, she would crash (she knew this <br/>
too which is why she just kept moving).  :)  There was a play slide <br/>
she was playing on.  I told her 10 minutes and then we put the slide <br/>
outside.  I counted down for her until her 10 minutes were up and <br/>
then said &quot;ok, mommy&#39;s going to put the slide away now.&quot;  She <br/>
said &quot;ok, mommy and then read.&quot;  My MIL was thunderstruck that she <br/>
didn&#39;t put up any fight at all.  <br/>
<br/>
It has made life soooo much easier without all the butting of heads,<br/>
