<div id="ygrps-yiv-877993008">When I was a kid, I really loved Bach pieces, and we were able to find books <br/>
that had small excerpts (the violin solos) from concertos.  Also Beethoven <br/>
melodies.  I have taken my kids to the music store where they could sample music, <br/>
and let them listen to classics, then searched online or at the music store <br/>
for the sheet music.  For instance, they loved the music from some of the <br/>
Disney movies, which was classical in style, and we were able to find simple <br/>
versions for piano.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
