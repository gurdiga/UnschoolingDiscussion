&lt;&lt;   I recently decided that I was not really comfortable with saying that I <br/>
am <br/>
 a &quot;homeschool&quot; or an &quot;unschooler&quot;  I think the former leads people to think <br/>
 that I &quot;school&quot; at home, which I don&#39;t, and the latter makes them look at me <br/>
 strangely.  I have found myself using the word &quot;home-educater&quot; and then I <br/>
see <br/>
 people actually thinking a moment to try and figure out just what that might <br/>
 be.  But if I really think about it, I am really a &quot; home- education <br/>
 co-creator&quot; because it really is a partnership with my daughter not a <br/>
 teacher-student relationship. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Rofl!!!  Jackie, I usually let my daughters answer the questions about their <br/>
schooling when we&#39;re out.  They usually don&#39;t permit me a word in edgewise, <br/>
anyhow.    When I&#39;m asked directly, I usually say that our family is educated <br/>
at home.  I like the co-creator verbage, though.  Have to think about how to <br/>
use this.<br/>
