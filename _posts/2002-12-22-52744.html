&gt; right now on my calender. I also have a doll of him in my room. The kids<br/>
&gt; want to play with him from time to time, but NO ONE touches my Elvis<br/>
&gt; doll!!!!<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t know you were a big Elvis freak.  Send me an address sometime and<br/>
I&#39;ll send you some pictures from Ray Barracks, Friedberg, Germany.  My dh is<br/>
now stationed where Elvis was stationed when he was in the army.  There&#39;s<br/>
Elvis junk all over this town.  And, in typical army fashion, NOTHING here<br/>
has changed in the least since 20 years before Elvis was here, let alone<br/>
since then!<br/>

Oh Brenda, a walk down memory lane, how nice that would be. I assume you <br/>
didn&#39;t really mean &quot;junk&quot; now did you???!!! That little girl crush I had on <br/>
him never went away.<br/>
And it is about the only one I&#39;ve ever had.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m dating myself, again (and confessing how out-of-touch with the<br/>
world I&#39;ve always been....) but I don&#39;t remember Elvis, let alone had a<br/>
crush on him.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
And actually, Mary, yes, I did mean junk.  Amazing junk.  And some fairly<br/>
nice stuff, I&#39;m sure, but lots of junk, too.  Let&#39;s face it, Friedberg isn&#39;t<br/>
exactly on the tourist route.  Gotta exploit what you got!<br/>
