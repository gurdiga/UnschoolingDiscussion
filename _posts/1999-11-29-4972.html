<div id="ygrps-yiv-598408040">I know this is naggy, but I&#39;d like to remind everyone to &quot;cut out&quot; only<br/>
the portion of the reply that applies directly to their message.  The<br/>
daily digests get so large that juno won&#39;t let me read them, and then I&#39;m<br/>
a day or two behind by the time one is small enough to get through.  Some<br/>
of these replies are really rediculously long, including up to three or<br/>
four of the entire text of previous messages.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
Brooke in OK<br/>
