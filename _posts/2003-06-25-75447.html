<div id="ygrps-yiv-320601082">I like David Albert&#39;s essay on reading - in all the years he&#39;s been homeschooling/talking about HS at conferences, he&#39;s never met a child over 17/18 that did not read.  Some read sooner.  Some later.  Some much later.  It&#39;ll happen!  Trust the child.<br/>
<br/>
 Friends of ours (Unschoolers) trust that their eldest who is nearly 11 will eventually get interested.  In the meantime, his 8 yo brother reads to/for him.  Now that&#39;s coping behaviour!  :O))<br/>

  WHOOOOO was asked her opinion about reading by a panicky mother whose <br/>
  seven year old isn&#39;t reading yet, and wanted to share that post with <br/>
  that panicky mother, along with all the OTHER pearls of wisdom that <br/>
  already fell from my lips. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884431350">You know what convinced me? A paragraph in Gatto&#39;s book Underground <br/>
History of American Education. He says (paraphrase) Sudbury Valley <br/>
school doesn&#39;t have any reading lessons. No one teaches reading, yet <br/>
every kid that attends there, leaves knowing how to read. <br/>
<br/>
That, along with the frustration of watching two kids pick up reading <br/>
with less than one week of phonics, and the third kid NOT pick up <br/>
reading with a half a YEAR of phonics. The first two were ready to <br/>
read, and would have learned, phonics or not. The third is my &quot;late <br/>
starting reader&quot; who hasn&#39;t started reading yet. And this poor mother <br/>
of a seven year old...My main advice to her was &quot;Relax&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
let the experts get all worked up about him, or they could make him <br/>
even more miserable&quot; (he&#39;s already feeling so bad, because he is in <br/>
p.s. and his classmates all read) <br/>
<br/>
I doubt my friend would relax so long as late teens, though! ack. LOL <br/>
I might not be able to do THAT! (working on it...working on it)<br/>
