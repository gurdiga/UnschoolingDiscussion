Hi and welcome!  My sister has been a practical and clinical Pathologist<br/>
for years, but she is in the middle of shifting gears and is getting her<br/>
license as a General Praticioner.  Her husband owns a Veterinary Hospital,<br/>
where he is the head Vet.  I hear that they keep a real menagerie at their<br/>
house, although I have never had occasion to visit in recent years,<br/>
unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
As to the reading, I wanted to add a little story here about my nieces.  I<br/>
have been lamenting about my lack of support from family and friends in<br/>
both the unschooling, and in our pending adoption.  Last night I had a<br/>
really great conversation with my brother online.  He apologized for being<br/>
so crazy/busy lately with his work and said he and his family support us<br/>
100% in whatever we decide to do.  He was interested and asking questions<br/>
about the adoption, but then I started to tell him about Unschooling, and<br/>
WOW!  He was real interested right from the get-go.  His girls and my boys<br/>
are very close, in age and as friends, and I would LOVE to Unschool the<br/>
girls at my home until they get to a place where one of them can afford to<br/>
stay home.  I know that my Sister-in-law wants to homeschool real bad.  I<br/>
told him he needs to move out here (LOL.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I told him I thought his kids were perfect candidates for<br/>
Unschooling.  His older daughter is reading whole books now, writes her<br/>
name, and knows her alphabet backwards and forwards, among many other<br/>
things, and she is not yet 4!!  She has also never been to preschool.  I<br/>
told him she will be bored to tears in ps.  His younger daughter is trying<br/>
hard to follow her sisters example (sibling rivalry) and she does NOT<br/>
submit well at all to authority figures.  I fear for her in school, as she<br/>
is so much like I was.  I told my Kindergarten teacher the first day of<br/>
school &quot;You can&#39;t tell me what to do, YOU&#39;RE not my Mother!!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My sister-in-law has a photographic memory and really loved school, the<br/>
whole way around.  She has almost completed her degree to teach highschool,<br/>
but she told me her &#39;secret&#39; wish and her chief desire has always been to<br/>
just stay home and be a mommy, and to homeschool.  When I spoke to her<br/>
about it, she was also interested.  She told me about how the girls had<br/>
been asking about the Solar System (at 2 and 3!) as in &quot;Mommy, do we live<br/>
in outer space?&quot;  and &quot;What is the sun?&quot;  That kind of thing.  So she was<br/>
getting books on it for them to read and was making a &quot;Solar System&quot; out of<br/>
salt and pepper shakers and other items at breakfast the other day to try<br/>
to explain to them.  She also said that her three year old was asking about<br/>
Mummies, so she was getting her a kit from Barnes and Nobel with hyroglyph<br/>
stamps, stickers, books and other cool Egyptian stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is, when I told my brother all about Unschooling and child<br/>
led learning and how it teaches kids to think for themselves and follow<br/>
their bliss, to make careers out of their passions, he said &quot;Wow, So have<br/>
you already started?&quot;  I said &quot;Yes! and so have you!&quot;  He was speechless!<br/>
(LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Feeling better,<br/>

Thanks so much for listening the other day.  We have found out that our son<br/>
has mono, not cancer as they originally thought.  So we are studying that.<br/>
:-)  Thank you again.  :-)<br/>
