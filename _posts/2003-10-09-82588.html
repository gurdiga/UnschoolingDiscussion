<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307836431">I belong to another list where a lady had been asking for help with disciplining her daughter. She spanks her children because she believes it&#39;s biblical. I and some other ladies emailed her that spanking was not biblical.  She has lightened up a bit but she also emailed the following back to the list. I know that meanings get lost through translations but was wondering if any of you have a way I could explain the following to her so she can understand.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what she wrote and  the proverb she is referring to:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That said, I have been spanking less. Not because I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s biblical. &quot;Apply your heart to <br/>
discipline And your ears to words of knowledge. Do not hold back discipline from the child, Although <br/>
you strike him with the rod, he will not die. You shall strike him with the rod And rescue his soul from <br/>
Sheol.&quot; I don&#39;t know how you can reconcile a belief that spanking is not biblical with this proverb. <br/>
However, for the time being, I am trying to win back my child&#39;s heart by showing mercy. I am not <br/>
spanking except for an obvious rebellious attitude. An then only when I am sure she is not hungry, <br/>
tired, or feeling sick. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841934464">I have read and researched the biblical basis for spanking.  There are ways <br/>
that the scriptures can be interpretted in some places in the bible that <br/>

Spanking Argument #4 - “The bible says &#39;Spare the rod and spoil the child&#39; <br/>
and I must obey God”<br/>
<br/>
Spanking is deeply rooted in the history and culture of the United States. <br/>
The bible is often used to support, even perhaps to require, that parents use <br/>
corporal punishment on children. Many clergy today are speaking out against that <br/>
interpretation of scripture. The Reverend Dr. Thomas E. Sagendorf of Bexley <br/>
United Methodist Church in Columbus, OH says the following “I can find no <br/>
sanction in the teaching of Jesus or the witness of the New Testament to encourage <br/>
the practice of corporal punishment at home, school or anywhere else. A number <br/>
of popular voices take a different view, often quoting Old Testament <br/>
scriptures to prove their point. Those who subscribe to this argument misunderstand <br/>
and misuse scripture. A similar method of selective reading could just as well <br/>
be used to justify slavery, suppression of women, polygamy, incest and <br/>
infanticide”.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kathy, for biblical literalists, helping them dissociate from <br/>
fundamentalist teachings about Christian parenting is a very <br/>
difficult task. What worked for me was the deconstruction of the <br/>
bible itselfrecognizing how many places I don&#39;t operate on the <br/>
literal level with Scripture. A couple examples: I don&#39;t wear a veil <br/>
or head covering, I still wear makeup and gold jewelry, we don&#39;t <br/>
baptize the dead, and we don&#39;t marry our girls off at 14 either. <br/>
There is not clear teaching on parenting. There are inferences <br/>
that moderns use to create these massive parnetal routines and <br/>
structures that probably bear little resemblance to actual <br/>
practices of the ancient world. (I remember that the Ezzos, for <br/>
instance, inferred that Mary must have had Jesus on a schedule <br/>
because she was so busy with first century tasks such as <br/>
getting water from the well.... Ugh! That&#39;s the kind of ignorance <br/>
peddled as biblical parenting that makes me ill.)<br/>
<br/>
The supposed biblical mandate for spanking has always <br/>
seemed suspicious to me because you can be sure that the <br/>
Jews of the OT didn&#39;t take their children into a bathroom with a <br/>
wooden spoon and follow the steps outlined by Dr. Dobson <br/>
when they smacked their chidlren. children were viewed as <br/>
mini-adults until Freud. Seriously. Violence against those who <br/>
didn&#39;t obey was routine for centuries. There was no internal self <br/>
to appeal to. External regulation was all that humans knew. <br/>
Everything has changed since the Enlightenment.<br/>
<br/>
Ross Campbell and Dr. Sears (both Christian authors) helped <br/>
me a lot when I was sorting through these issues.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I like the book by Dr. Michael Bradley _Yes, Your Teen <br/>
is Crazy_ which does a great job explaining why parenting <br/>
methods by necessity have had to change in the 20th century. <br/>
He&#39;s not a Christian though.<br/>
<br/>
As far as spanking being biblical or notthe OT definitely does <br/>
affirm its value. What I like to point to is the NT and how Jesus <br/>
teaches us to treat others. If we insert our children into the <br/>
contexts he speaks of, we have a very different approach than <br/>
spanking. &quot;Turn the other cheek&quot; &quot;Go the extra mile&quot; &quot;Give your <br/>
coat&quot; &quot;Bless and curse not&quot; &quot;Do not judge&quot; Even the story of the <br/>
prodigal son can be read to show that the father is not held <br/>
responsible for the rebellion of the son but that his role is <br/>
forgiver and receiver when the son returns.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few of my thoughts. I&#39;ll do some looking around for other <br/>
resources to help you out.<br/>

Spankers spank because they were spanked.<br/>
It seems in some extreme cases that brawlers and murderers and spouse abusers <br/>
and rapists do all that because they were spanked, too.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that there was a study on violent criminals in penitentiaries, and <br/>
what they had in common was corporal punishment as children.<br/>

in spanking and we spanked. We believed the biblical teaching... <br/>

people of all kinds across the spectrum who grew up with <br/>
<br/>
spanking—respectable citizens and felons. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably not with the same proportions as the felons.<br/>
<br/>
Statistics on who&#39;s in prison indicate all KINDS of things, but lots are not <br/>
easy to track.  One is broken homes, but that covers mothers throw father out, <br/>
mother didn&#39;t know who father was, father ran off, mother ran off.  And there <br/>
are genetic factors.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you&#39;ll find NEARLY the same stats in a group of similarly similar <br/>
people.  Senators are probably more likely to have had intact homes and less <br/>
violence.   &quot;Respectable citizens&quot; (depending how you isolated your group) would <br/>
probably not have the same background similarities as felons.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but defending spanking is an odd use of this list, don&#39;t <br/>
you think?<br/>

&lt;&lt; I always point people to Jesus to see what he thought of children and how <br/>
he<br/>
<br/>
dealt with them. It&#39;s always gentle and loving. And he did say to love your<br/>
<br/>
neighbour as yourself which includes your kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seems some Christians have found Biblical justification for <br/>
self-flaggelation. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Those tended not to have children, generally, but not always!<br/>
The Penitente sect of northern New Mexico is into flailing themownselves some.<br/>
