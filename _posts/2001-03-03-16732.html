&lt;&lt;   Well, my 6 yr old would like to know how large a bit it would take to<br/>
    drill to the core of the earth.  Who knows this??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might be fun to talk to a well driller someday (as you come across one, <br/>
even if it&#39;s years from now) to ask questions.  or someone who has worked in <br/>
a geology lab where they deal with core samples.<br/>
<br/>
The underground of the world is being mapped, gradually, as oil drillers (and <br/>
others, I guess) send in their core.  When they come to mud or water, they <br/>
measure how much pipe went down before they hit rock again, and they pull out <br/>
sections of the layers of rock and those (not from EVERY hole drilled, but <br/>
from those involved in this) are sent to labs for analysis of the layers.  It <br/>
helps the oil workers for future drilling, but also helps to show where <br/>
underground water and other-stuff are.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, drills break.  And there would be easier and harder places to &quot;drill to <br/>
the center of the earth.  It depends what rock is down there, but under ALL <br/>
of it there will eventually be some drill-breaking stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe finding statistics on the deepest holes ever dug would be fun.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also possible to drill at an angle, or to turn a corner down in there.  <br/>
Sometimes mining thieves do that--kind of like rustling oil from the <br/>
neighbor&#39;s mineral-rights claim.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably WAY more than any six-year-old will be interested in, but it <br/>
might be a fun ongoing curiosity for the adults.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, who lives in New Mexico where water is sometimes WAY down below the <br/>
ground, and wells for houses sometimes have to be over a thousand feet deep <br/>
to get clean, drinkable water.  The elevation here is already 5,000 feet, <br/>
generally, and  I haven&#39;t tried those, but I would if I were wanting to look. <br/>

Thanks too everyone.
<br>We got out one of the science books we have...&nbsp; It showed a cut
away.&nbsp; It talked in terms of miles.&nbsp; That was something he could
relate to (That would be like driving to Asheville and back....ect)&nbsp;
He was much impressed.&nbsp; He thought it was neat about the heat and
how it changes the rock, and how small the crust actually is.&nbsp; We
never need dwell on it very long, but when there is an interest we usually
try to drop all we can and find an answer.

<br/>
People in the country do have their own wells.  We had a well when I was <br/>
growing up.  They&#39;re dug by professionals, and there&#39;s an electric pump (most <br/>
commonly) and they work from inside the house just like any city-water <br/>
house--you turn it on and water comes out.  But if the electricity goes off <br/>
the water doesnt work! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people end up getting land where wells can&#39;t be drilled.  Well, wells <br/>
can be drilled but there won&#39;t be any water! &lt;g&gt;  Up on the sides of <br/>
mountains where the water table is way WAY too low, or the rock is way too <br/>
hard or somehow else inaccessible.  Some get a tank and truck water in.  Some <br/>
just find they can&#39;t live on the land they&#39;ve bought.  But often part of <br/>
buying the land is the information about water table.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I&#39;ve heard, the first water they hit is skipped and they go to the <br/>
second or third (for it to be cleaner and less affected by drought).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Albuquerque, on city water.  The purpose of a town seems pretty much <br/>
to share water (in the case of small incorporations who are just getting <br/>
shared well and sewer, instead of individual wells and septic tanks.<br/>

Here in New Zealand a lot of country people have water tanks. They <br/>
*catch* the rain water and use that.  If the tank gets low and there <br/>
is no rain, then the water has to be bought.  These people have <br/>
septic tanks too.  It is quite possible that those who live way out <br/>
in the country could have wells - but I havent heard of it - but I am <br/>
a city girl - unfortunetly.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Marianne,</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;glad to meet you. We have six 
children,Cindy-16, Raymond-14,Michael-10, Julian-9, Gabriel-3, and Victoria-2. 
My niece, Noryanna-10 lives with us also. Our family moved to Tennessee in 
October of 99 to get away from government control and overcrowding in 
Massachusetts. We now have ten beautiful acres. All of the children are 
homeschooled except Raymond who insisted on going to a public school. He is 
presently regretting his decision. We have homeschooled&nbsp;for three years. I 
was originally using mostly textbooks, but the more I read about unschooling the 
more&nbsp;I think it is what our family needs. I have been looking&nbsp;for 
families who have unschooed succesfully to ask some questions so if yours are 
mostly grown and gone, maybe you can help me. My biggest fear is government 
intervention for improper recordkeeping. I know my children are learning every 
day. Do you keep a daily log of activities? How does the school system in New 
Zeland keep track of homeschoolers? This year I have given the children more 
freedom in what they study and learn. I do require bookwork for math and 
language arts. Otherwise what they learn is at their discretion. TV is kept to a 
minimum, unless it has something good to learn. My Michael loves the show Bill 
Nye the Science Guy. Do you use portfolios? we will be going a lot of gardening 
and landscaping this year. Good hands on stuff. My husband is a truck driver and 
gone for two weeks at a time. Sometimes that is really hard. One advantage of 
homeschooling is the kids can go with him sometimes. One on one time with Papi 
all to yourself for a week or two. How many children get that opportunity? 
sometimes it is absurd how ridiculous public schools can be. I have to go into 
my Son Raymond&#39;s school tomorrow. He got in trouble for having a rubber band in 
his hand. Rubber bands are forbidden in the gym room, they can be dangerous you 
know. He wasn&#39;t trying to shoot it or anything, just had it in his hand sort of 
playing with it&nbsp;while waiting for the bus. So now he has to write 100 times 
&quot; I will not have rubber bands in the&nbsp;gym room, ever.&quot; Can anyone believe 
this?!&nbsp; I have a gigantic urge to wear my &quot;Question Authority&quot;&nbsp;pin 
from my youth when I go tomorrow. Is that sarcastic? I think some of the 
administration are so caught up in the rules, they can&#39;t see the forest for the 
trees.&nbsp;Have you had any dealings with public schools? How have they been? 
Do you farm or homestead? We have three dogs, two Great Pyrenees and a German 
Shephard. I am considering getting a few sheep in the future.&nbsp;We also 
want&nbsp;to get a few chickens. I can and bake home made bread. What things 
have fascinated your children?</font></div>

Here in New Zealand you have to apply for a dispensation to h/s your <br/>
children.  Twice a year you have to sign a document to say you are <br/>
still h/s ing.(and to claim the $350 6 monthly *payment* per child <br/>
offered to h/s parents).<br/>
We have ERO (education review officers)who visit h/s ers to asses <br/>
what the children are doing. Actually they asses the parents not the <br/>
children.  Because of a lack of funding, we dont get many visits from <br/>
ERO.  Some h/sers never get a visit - others get 2-3 visits.  I have <br/>
only been h/sing for 10 months and so far have not had a visit, <br/>
though I do expect to be getting one soon.  I suppose we are very <br/>
lucky really.  It is reasonable easy to h/s our children here - the <br/>
children do not have to be tested and we do not have any set <br/>
curiculum to follow as long as the children are taught *as adequetly <br/>
and often* as ps children.<br/>
<br/>
I really envy your country living. We live in a suburb of Auckland. <br/>
The biggest city in NZ.<br/>
