<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307879145">I always use this term in sentences such as &quot;we&quot; don&#39;t really like <br/>
science But what a generallity (that I never realized)!!! I know my <br/>
oldest doesn&#39;t, say, like science but what about the 2yo if I say <br/>
stuff like that now she will evenually think she really doesn&#39;t like <br/>
it and not be able to form her own opinion.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for bringing this piont out.  I thought I was just making <br/>
conversation but I think you are right how will they ever know what <br/>
they like or dislike if I keep &quot;the kids and me&quot; as a we in stead of <br/>
what they are, Individuals, no matter how young<br/>

I did an odd thing, when Kirby was five.  I consciously decided not to  use <br/>
the names of &quot;subject areas,&quot; ever.  Whether he liked something or not,  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to tell him it was &quot;history&quot; or &quot;math&quot; or &quot;science.&quot;  Each  of those <br/>
is made up of dozens, hundreds of interests and unrelated topics.   In school, <br/>
kids decide to declare that they like or hate &quot;science,&quot; when really  geology <br/>
has very little to do with psychology or surgery.    Same  with &quot;geography.&quot;  <br/>
Would someone who &quot;likes geography&quot; because he&#39;s  fascinated by maps and <br/>
mapping necessarily care about the major production of  different regions of the <br/>
world, or traditional costume of Afghanistan?<br/>
 <br/>
But as an unschooling mom, I think it&#39;s important for the parents not to  say <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t like... (maps/science/costume/psychology), because if you have  <br/>
fears and prejudices left over from school, it&#39;s a good thing to do whatever  <br/>
internal work you need to get over that, so you can answer your children&#39;s  <br/>
questions without showing (and maybe passing on) an aversion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-651461314">For awhile now, I have been avoiding mentioning subjects and it has been so<br/>
freeing.  The myriad of things my children explore is nothing less than a<br/>
delight to witness.  It&#39;s doubly delightful not having that nagging<br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; voice in my head going, &quot;Well, that there was math.&quot;  Or, &quot;This<br/>
here is history.&quot;  Occasionally, it comes to haunt me.  The days I just<br/>
forget altogether about school or subjects of any sort are the ones I really<br/>
savor.<br/>
