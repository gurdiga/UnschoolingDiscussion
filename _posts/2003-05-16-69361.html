<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686679821">We LOVE legos here!! My dh has been dying to get them for my son for <br/>
a while--he will be 5 in July.  I kept arguing he was too little.<br/>
I forget the age on the boxes for the tiny legos, but I was folling <br/>
instructions (at elast somewhat).  We finally started buying the <br/>
Harry Potter legos and he LOVES them.  He helps his dad build some, <br/>
built one of the smaller sets himself with a little assistance.  We <br/>
are trying to encourage independent building as well.  Funny thing, <br/>
my ds who just turned 2 last Saturday play with them too!  We kept <br/>
putting them away, but once he got a chance he was as gentle as can <br/>
be!!  So the experts tell you &quot;this&quot; age and up, and it is better to <br/>
listen to your children (as long as they don&#39;t eat them &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Also, we were so excited.  We got the Harry Potter Castle that was <br/>
about $90 for $22 at Target. We have it put aside for his Birthday.  <br/>
Now, I have to get back on track with the spending less thread..LOL!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948088889">OH.. the &quot;recommended age&quot; on toys.. legos in particular.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, someone said thier  younger child is playing with the smaller ( <br/>
recommended for older children) legos.  My boys have been asking for duplos <br/>
so they can make BIGGER stuff.. lol.   We used to have duplos when they were <br/>
younger, but I think we sold them in a yardsale.    When I was little we had <br/>
these HUGE legos.. I swear they were lego brand.. maybe they weren&#39;t.  But <br/>
they were almost brick size.. Like the Mega blocks they have today.  But they <br/>
were that harder plastic like legos.. Anyway, Ethan and JP would LOVE to have <br/>
some of those really big blocks, but I havent found the &quot;old&quot; kind anywhere.. <br/>
May be time to go Ebaying again :-0<br/>

the small ones to make smaller things like automobiles of different types.<br/>

rather than duplo.  Her 2 1/2 year old brother is using lego now.<br/>
