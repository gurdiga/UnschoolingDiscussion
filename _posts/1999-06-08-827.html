Don&#39;t Close the Window on Baking Day<br/>
  ************************************************  (or institutional bread)<br/>
  by Ann Murphy  Wyoming Home Educators&#39; Newsletter  Spring/Summer 1986<br/>
<br/>
Once there was a community in which most people had beenraised on<br/>
  enriched, white, store-bought bread and saw to it that theirchildrenwere<br/>
  fed the same. The hope was that the children would grow to bebig,strong,<br/>
  and well-nourished so they could live productive lives and bea creditto<br/>
  the town. The bread was provided for the children by means ofacommunity<br/>
  tax and was distributed on a regular basis to all communitychildren<br/>
  irrespective of size, shape, or color.<br/>
  In this town there lived a woman named Matilda, who had threechildren.<br/>
  She had given the matter some thought and had done somereading andhad<br/>
  concluded that she could provide better nourishment for herchildrenby<br/>
  making her own whole-wheat or even white bread. After furtherthoughtshe<br/>
  decided she would try it out. Now, Matilda was aware that whatshe was<br/>
  doing was decidedly &quot;odd&quot; and that she might get some flakfrom her<br/>
  neighbors. She was, however, determined to provide what sheviewed asbest<br/>
  for her children.<br/>
  She began to make her own bread and no longer used the BreadDistribution<br/>
  Service. She continued to pay the community tax for bread;and, in<br/>
  addition, bought ingredients for her own homemade bread.Sometimeswhen<br/>
  Matilda and her children were seen in public during the BreadDistribution<br/>
  Hour, people would ask her, &quot;Why aren&#39;t your children eating?&quot;Shetried<br/>
  to explain that she made bread for them and that they ate itwith the<br/>
  family, but found that most people thought that was illegal.She beginto<br/>
  fear that people would think her children weren&#39;t being fed(thoughthey<br/>
  looked well-nourished) and that the City Fathers would thinkshe wasan<br/>
  abusive parent. She began closing the windows on baking day sothearoma<br/>
  wouldn&#39;t get out of the house and having the children eattheir bread<br/>
  during the Bread Distribution Hour so they wouldn&#39;t beconspicuous.She<br/>
  tried to keep a low profile to avoid detection.<br/>
  However, rumor that there were some families making their ownbread<br/>
  reached the offices of the City Fathers. The City Fathersdecided alaw<br/>
  needed to be passed to deal with the situation and define whatwaslegal<br/>
  There arose a great debate. Some said it was basically theparents&#39;<br/>
  responsibility and privilege to provide bread for theirchildren.Others<br/>
  said parents didn&#39;t know how to make bread and it should bemandatorythat<br/>
  they obtain bread from the Bread Distribution Service. Therewas somefear<br/>
  expressed that children might starve if there weren&#39;t someguaranteethat<br/>
  they were receiving bread at home when their parents took themoff the<br/>
  Bread Distribution List.<br/>
  Some wanted the law to require that the parents go to bakers&#39;school;some<br/>
  that they have required ingredients for the homemade bread,some that<br/>
  there be a schedule of baking days and assigned times for theeatingof<br/>
  the bread.  Eventually, it was decided that the parents who chose to <br/>
maketheir<br/>
own  bread needed to submit a recipe card demonstrating that thebread <br/>
theyfed<br/>
  their children would have at least some sort of flour, oil,andliquid.<br/>
  They also needed to be sure to feed their children on aregular basis.<br/>
  Matilda was elated! She had been afraid that the requirementsof thelaw<br/>
  would be much more detailed and demanding. She recognized thattherewere<br/>
  those in the city who were violently opposed to the home-bakedbreadidea<br/>
  and that they would probably seek to have the law changedsometime;but,<br/>
  for the time being, she felt much easier in mind.<br/>
  She was so used by this time to keeping a low profile in herbakingthat<br/>
  it never occurred to her that that should change.<br/>
  This writer how ever thinks that Matilda and other home-breadbakers<br/>
  should let the delicious aroma out to waft over theneighborhood. Ialso<br/>
  believe it would be beneficial if the community at largebecameaccustomed<br/>
  to the idea and began to learn how tasty and nutritioushomemade breadcan<br/>
  be. This would, I believe, help to counter the weight oftradition onthe<br/>
  side of the Bread Distribution Service should opponents ofhome-baked<br/>
  bread try to change the present law. People who bake their ownbreadto<br/>
  feed their children need to work to educate the public as tothebeauties<br/>
  and benefits of bread baking!<br/>
  Author&#39;s Note--Since we lived in North Dakota at the time,where&quot;homemade<br/>
  bread baking&quot; was clearly illegal (until after we had moved<br/>
  away!), I wrote this response:<br/>
  In another community, to the north of Matilda&#39;s, the sadsituation is<br/>
  this: the Bread Distribution Service union is powerful, andfor manyyears<br/>
  has opposed homemade bread baking. Some parents have tried it,anyway,and<br/>
  most would be only too glad to share their recipe cards. Somewould be<br/>
  willing to invite the Bread Distribution Servicesuperintendent intotheir<br/>
  homes on baking day. Some are even willing to submit theirchildren toan<br/>
  annual examination to prove that they are being well-nourishedon<br/>
  home-baked bread.<br/>
  Last year the local Parents&#39; Association of Home-Bakers madevaliant<br/>
  efforts in the city council to get the law changed, but to noavail.The<br/>
  current regulation is that parents cannot bake bread at homefor their<br/>
  children unless they hold a valid certificate from bakers&#39;school--even<br/>
  though Bakers&#39; School concentrates on teaching institutionalbreadbaking,<br/>
  and would be of little value to parents baking bread at home.<br/>
  Parents who persist in making their children&#39;s bread at homeandrefusing<br/>
  to obtain their bread from the Bread Distribution Service arehighly<br/>
  subject to legal prosecution. In fact, five such families wererecently<br/>
  taken to court and convicted. One of those families, like manyothersin<br/>
  the past, has moved to a different community where home-bakedbread is<br/>
  legal. (One frustration is that the communities directly tothe east,west<br/>
  and south allow homemade bread baking.)<br/>
  But at least three of the families are continuing to bakebread athome,<br/>
  and are definitely keeping their windows open on bakingday--in spiteof a<br/>
  threatened jail sentence for doing so. Unfortunately, otherfamilieswho<br/>
  would risk losing their jobs must keep their windows closedandcontinue<br/>
  to bake bread in absolute secrecy.<br/>
  So, I would further encourage those who live in communitieslike<br/>
  Matilda&#39;s where home-baking is possible to keep their windowsopen so<br/>
  that the delicious aromas may waft even outside the communityand<br/>
  influence other less enlightened communities to relieve theoppressionof<br/>
  home-baked bread <br/>
families.---------------------------------------------------<br/>
