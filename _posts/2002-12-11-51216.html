<div id="ygrps-yiv-419834671">***Now she&#39;s 9 year old and <br/>
can&#39;t go to sleepovers because I&#39;m not there to sing to her.***<br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was six we flew to Kansas to take care of my nieces.  Their<br/>
father was mysteriously ill and their mother had gone with him out of<br/>
state to different specialists.   My nieces were 7, 8 and 12 at the time.<br/>
The seven year old always went rocking with her mom at bed time and her<br/>
mother, who has a lovely  voice would sing softly to her.  <br/>
So Emily asked me to rock her an sing.  I knew the song she wanted, and<br/>
although I&#39;m no singer, I figured she&#39;s seven right? How good do I have<br/>
to be?<br/>
After I sang for awhile she gently touched my cheek and said, &quot;That&#39;s ok,<br/>
Tia, you can stop now.&quot;  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
We kept rocking and after a little bit she asked maybe if I could just<br/>
hum...  <br/>
<br/>
She still remembers because when she&#39;s here and we play the piano she<br/>
always reminds me it&#39;s ok if I don&#39;t want to sing.   She&#39;s 11 now, such<br/>
an annoying child.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
