&lt;&lt; What happened to the other mom-in-a-band in Australia, the big Rastafarian <br/>
 rain-forest family who moved to a commune or something? Anyone in touch with <br/>
 her on the side who can update us? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you talking about Neri?<br/>
I miss her!!<br/>

Ren<br/>
&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232583194">Is anyone coming down to the conference from New England that would <br/>
be willing to share a ride? I am looking for a ride for myself and <br/>
my 13-yo daughter. I would share the gas and the driving. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I am looking to room share with someone. I did not reserve a <br/>
room because I did not think we would be able to come but my <br/>
situation changed and now we can go. <br/>

Hi Karol,<br/>
<br/>
My husband, daughter and I just moved from CA in Aug of last year <br/>
(the same weekend as the last Homeschooling conference in <br/>
Sacramento).  I&#39;m not sure about a specific Unschooling conference <br/>
but, there is a Homeschooling conference every Aug.  If you go <br/>
www.hsc.org, you can find out more info on it.<br/>
