<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022977169">Good morning-<br/>
I reading today&#39;s post ( which I do often but don&#39;t often post ) I was<br/>
struck by the strong response to the &quot;Waldorf&quot; method of teaching math -<br/>
i.e. using stories, symbols, jewels, etc to represent and work the four<br/>
math processes. My three children all have benefited greatly from this way<br/>
of presenting math to them - in fact, they &quot;ate it up&quot; and comprehended the<br/>
whole picture in a new and fun way. These same children are now 18, 15 and<br/>
11 and can surely handle advanced and practical math concepts, but all had<br/>
math come alive for them using this (and other) ways of seeing it.<br/>
Sometimes we forget that unschooling can mean so many ways of learning and<br/>
being and doing - different and perfect for each family/child.<br/>
Just another perspective.<br/>
In aloha, Lee<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d like to note that my original email was not about Waldorf, nor about <br/>
mathematical stories which I think are a good way to make math real. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t about using jewels or any other manipulative.<br/>
<br/>
The program materials that had me gagging involve the numerals as characters <br/>
divorced from any mathematical content. For instance, the cue for 4 x4 is the <br/>
sentence &quot;Remember, you have to be 16 to drive a 4 by 4.&quot;  6 x 6 is cued with <br/>
a visual mnemonic of a pair of thirsty sixes (36). <br/>
<br/>
The whole point was to memorize the &quot;facts&quot; without any mathematical thinking <br/>
being involved in any way. I firmly believe such an approach can foster math <br/>
phobia - presenting math as something too difficult to be comprehended so it <br/>
needs to be just memorized in whatever way works, needs to be changed into <br/>
something else. Bah!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s even similar to the Waldorf stories, but if it is then <br/>
I would have the same objections.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, but I love mnemonics! Did they have &quot;I 8 and I 8 and that&#39;s what I<br/>
got sick for (64)&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
IMO, memorizing math facts isn&#39;t about mathematical thinking. Knowing how<br/>
to find the answers to arithmetic problems is - I could also figure 8 x 8<br/>
by knowing that two eights is 16, 16x2 is 32, 32x2 is 64... or by having<br/>
played with binary numbers... but mnemonics are great for things you want<br/>
to recall quickly. I could figure out what the names of the great lakes<br/>
were, with time, or I can say HOMES and have them right away. I make up<br/>
my own mnemonics... our license plate is &quot;3 hens before &#39;64&quot; (3HNB464).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think learning about math should be just a collection of<br/>
mnemonics, but I think they&#39;re awfully useful when memorizing math facts,<br/>
for whatever reason.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, but to most people the times table *is* math. Deb wasn&#39;t venting about<br/>
mnemonics or clever ways of memorizing the tables. She&#39;s venting about<br/>
people&#39;s attitude towards math as something mysterious that must be<br/>
memorized.<br/>
<br/>
I think the 2nd most frequently asked question about math and unschooling --<br/>
after &quot;How will they learn algebra?&quot; -- is &quot;What about the multiplication<br/>
tables?&quot; People don&#39;t seem to care whether their kids understand how numbers<br/>
work. Perhaps many people don&#39;t even realize there is more to math than<br/>
memorizing a bunch of meaningless processes. As long as kids have the table<br/>
memorized for most people it&#39;s irrelevant whether the kids understand that<br/>
multiplication is repeated addition. And as far as schools are concerned,<br/>
it&#39;s difficult to test if something is understood and very easy to test if<br/>
something is memorized so that&#39;s what schools emphasize. And because schools<br/>
emphasize it, most parents assume that&#39;s what&#39;s most important.<br/>
<br/>
In fact under &quot;Does it work?&quot; the whole argument of how good the program is<br/>
is based on it&#39;s success in improved speed on timed tests.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wanted to commit the tables to memory, those mnemonic devies<br/>
might be helpful if their brains worked that way. It is on the order of<br/>
HOMES and ROYGBIV. But how many schools place a huge amount of importance on<br/>
how quickly kids can rattle off the Great Lakes or the spectrum. But they do<br/>
invest a disproportionate amount of time getting the kids to memorize<br/>
various math processes.<br/>

<br/>
Well, see, I think that the effort of &quot;memorizing facts&quot; is one of the <br/>
*prime* causes of math phobia. It puts all the emphasis on the wrong damn <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why this program bothered me so much, when I went to check it out <br/>
after seeing an ad in a homeschooling magazine. It&#39;s an attractively <br/>
packaged, clever, alternative approach to the same old stupidity. <br/>
<br/>
I brought it to this list because math learning and how people become phobic <br/>
about it was being discussed here, and I thought it one more point for Pam to <br/>
ponder.<br/>

Power&quot; -- what a GREAT book!!!! I SO wish I&#39;d written it - it really says <br/>
almost everything I&#39;ve wanted to say. The only thing she sort of skims over <br/>
is the idea of not expecting kids to be at certain levels at certain ages. <br/>
She touches on it - but you can just sense that she doesn&#39;t know what to do <br/>
with that idea - since she&#39;s talking mostly to people with kids in school.<br/>
