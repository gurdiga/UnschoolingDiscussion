<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623100762">Hello Diane,<br/>
<br/>
Part of working with children and adults who have addictive personalities <br/>
and related disorders such as OCD is teaching them how to live with and <br/>
around what causes their problems.  Stripping a child&#39;s home of televisions <br/>
wouldn&#39;t help the child because the rest of the world has televisions.  <br/>
Teaching the child to recognize that they have a problem and then giving <br/>
them tools to work with helps.  Some things have to be limited or controlled <br/>
by the parent until such time as the child is able to recognize the triggers <br/>
and how to use the &quot;tools&quot; to control their &quot;addictions&quot; or compulsions <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In rare cases the answer is the same as with an alcoholic, complete <br/>
abstinance.  However, many alcoholics learn to live with alchol either in <br/>
their homes or in the perivery of their lives and learn to not use it <br/>
themselves.  They also learn to use &quot;tools&quot; to continue to abstain.  <br/>
Fortunately in lots of non-substance addictions, learning to use &quot;tools&quot; <br/>
makes life much easier and definable as being within the parameters known as <br/>
&quot;the norm.&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If I were seriously concerned that a person in my family were actually <br/>
&gt;addicted<br/>
&gt;to something, I don&#39;t think I could in good faith have it in the home, even <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;other family members like it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How could I allow this person to see everyone else in the family enjoying <br/>
&gt;it,<br/>
&gt;and not want it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does this sound cruel to anyone else?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not attacking, just confused. If it&#39;s really an addiction, like alcohol, <br/>
&gt;why the<br/>
&gt;different treatment?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
