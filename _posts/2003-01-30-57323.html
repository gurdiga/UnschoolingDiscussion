<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072635578">I have to share this with you guys.. Jon Phillip has &quot;meltdowns&quot; daily.  <br/>
Well, Ethan does too, actually, but his are not as intense. .. hes grown out <br/>
of the really intense ones.. JP is just starting to have them.   Anyway, it <br/>
is a daily challange.. some days worse than others.. I read with much <br/>
interest Sandra&#39;s observation of &quot;protein lows&quot; triggering these emotional <br/>
meltdowns.  I thought.. hmm, that could be the case here.. JP is a little <br/>
dude and really doesnt eat a lot of high protein foods.. So, I asked him <br/>
while talking one evening.. &quot;you like cheese dont you?,  I mean, you know, <br/>
like little cheese cubes&quot;  He said.. &quot;Oh yeah, I love cheese.. grilled cheese <br/>
sandwiches too&quot;.  I said.. &quot;Yeah, and that string cheese stick thing you used <br/>
to pack in your lunch.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah.. mmmm, I love string cheese too&quot;.  So Anna <br/>
over hears us talking and asks why am I asking him about cheese.  ( and you <br/>
know, I maybe shouldnt even have brought it up to him.. maybe I should have <br/>
just offered him some cheese the next time he started losing it.. but.. I <br/>
guess I was sort of talking it out to him)  So, I tell them, that I read that <br/>
sometimes if your body is not getting enough protien, it makes you feel yucky <br/>
and maybe feel like you just can&#39;t cope.  Like when JP has his meltdowns.. .. <br/>
So, if he is feeling cranky, maybe eating some cheese would help.   They <br/>
thought it was a good idea ..  So, I bought some cheese snacky stuff.. ( <br/>
cubes, string cheese, etc).  And when he started spiraling down, I got him <br/>
some cheese  ( bear with me, I know this is long)..  Actually, it did seem to <br/>
help him gain control.  Maybe it was the act of taking a break to eat a <br/>
snack, or maybe he really was having a low protien moment.. Anyway, hes <br/>
started asking for some cheese when he feels cranky and irritable.  ( which <br/>
is really just about once a day. maybe twice..).. SO, the funny thing.. Ethan <br/>
was getting wound up..  getting upset over his video game or something. .. <br/>
crying and fussing and stomping, generally feeling miserable  I was trying to <br/>
console him and get him interested in something else.  JP just looked at me <br/>
and said, .&quot;Momma, I think Ethan needs some cheese&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>

PS<br/>
Ethan hates cheese.  .. DARN!<br/>

That is funny!! Maybe keep several protein options available, so they don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s just cheese that is the answer (which can actually cause problems <br/>
for anybody with dairy sensitivities). Nuts, protein bars etc....<br/>
My kids get a homeopathic remedy if they are having trouble coping. The sugar <br/>
pill gives that break from what is going on, changes the focus and they like <br/>
to take them.<br/>
So little pills are what we run for lots of times.<br/>
Only if it&#39;s obvious that the child can&#39;t cope and other options aren&#39;t the <br/>
answer.<br/>
Usually a hungry or tired child is going to have a melt down faster.<br/>
Keeping snacky stuff on the table for them to munch on continually is really <br/>
good for younger kids. Keeps their blood sugar more even through out the day.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is so true.  Because I&#39;m hypoglycemic (low blood sugar), I can <br/>
feel when I&#39;m having a problem and need to do something about it right away.  <br/>
I think for very young children they know something is wrong in how they <br/>
feel, but may not know what to do to feel better.  We always have a lot of <br/>
high-fiber and protein foods around for me and the kids to eat.  There are <br/>
many days where they really don&#39;t have a lunch but snack throughout the <br/>
afternoon.  Although being tired, sick, or having fluctuations in their blood <br/>
sugar can cause children to have melt downs, I feel for very young children, <br/>
that changes in their bodies and environment can also affect their behavior.  <br/>
I have been helping my son go through something that I believe started after <br/>
getting his big boy bed.  He wanted a bed and asked for one, but I think it&#39;s <br/>
been an adjustment for him.  I didn&#39;t really put it together until recently, <br/>
yesterday.  He&#39;s always been a child who tells people what he wants and feels <br/>
without losing it.  Now, everything seems to frustrate him and sets him off.  <br/>
There&#39;s no calming him down, talking to him, touching him, or helping him <br/>
when he&#39;s out of control.  I try to see it coming in hopes to help him before <br/>
it starts, but many times I don&#39;t.  I&#39;ve read in many books that when <br/>
children go through changes, or have achieved certain milestones in their <br/>
development, that their behavior may change.  When he&#39;s not out of control <br/>
and the frustration is over, I talk to him about it.  I cuddle with him.  If <br/>
the situation may come up again, I talk to him about it before it comes up. <br/>

&gt; I got diabeties when i had my first child. Went away in between<br/>
pregnancies and trigures when I am stress or dont eat propper. When sugars<br/>
are high or low I get very testy. Low sugars give me bad migranes and I will<br/>
snap at anything! Thankfully I have them undercontrol much better now.I was<br/>
told by the dietician that eating smaller meals snacks all day is better<br/>
than eating really large meals . </span></blockquote></div>
