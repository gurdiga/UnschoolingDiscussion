<div id="ygrps-yiv-566264660">I agree also. I emailed and asked why they didn&#39;t title the story &quot;The Dark <br/>
Side of Parenting.&quot; I believe the story said that they where not even complying <br/>
with the state laws. Not that it matters much but in this case there was a <br/>
history and an abuse trail.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder though, what about the parents who spank when their children do not <br/>
do their work or well enough? I have seen this with traditional Christian <br/>
Homeschoolers. Where is the line? Or the parent that spanks their child in the <br/>
store or beats them in the parking lot or worse behind closed doors where no one <br/>
sees?<br/>
I once herd a Mom tell her daughter as she sat on her lap that she (the Mom) <br/>
liked her daughters hair. The daughter (age 8) said yeah especially when you <br/>
pull me across the room by my hair when you are mad.  I was visiting at their <br/>
home and sitting on the floor with my son. I pretended not to hear what she had <br/>
said but I never forget that statement.  I wonder now what is a front and <br/>
what is real.  I always looked at the family as if we lacked something they had. <br/>
We dont lack a thing that they have as their children may look happy but it is <br/>
really fear of the paddle, spoon, hand and shame that they practice.... Laura<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I also agree with some other posters.  These people were not <br/>
technically homeschoolers.<br/>
