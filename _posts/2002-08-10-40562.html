&gt;&gt;In Massachusetts, there is a homeschooling family whose children are under<br/>
&gt;&gt;the jurisdiction of the state dept of something, not for abuse or neglect of<br/>
&gt;&gt;any kind -- it has never been about inadequate parenting -- but for not<br/>
&gt;&gt;submitting a curriculum to the local school district.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This would be a sensationalist misrepresentation of what happened. It<br/>
&gt;suggests a picture of parents blindsided by the system because of missed<br/>
&gt;paperwork.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Bryants fully realized what they were doing when they refused to submit<br/>
&gt;an education plan. They claimed that the school committee&#39;s process of<br/>
&gt;approval runs counter to their unschooling appraoch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(The paperwork is not at all burdensome.  I use Carol Narigon&#39;s letter of<br/>
&gt;intent and send in a list of subjects and a sentence or two on each for<br/>
&gt;evaluation. Some towns ask for more but the case law says the method of<br/>
&gt;assessment must be approved by the parents.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The committee had no objection to the Bryants homeschooling or even<br/>
&gt;unschooling. They just wanted their paperwork. They had 2 years to work it<br/>
&gt;out. This was a stand on a principle -- Kim Bryant claimed the<br/>
&gt;&quot;Massachusetts Constitution protects her from needing to comply with the<br/>
&gt;state&#39;s home education regulations.&quot; (quote from Nicky Hardenbergh of MHLA,<br/>
&gt;the state HS group) (Kim Bryant discussed her position at *very* great<br/>
&gt;length -- so great it split the state list in 2 -- on the MAHomeschoolers<br/>
&gt;group on Yahoo.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They lost.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The <br/>
        parents&#39; principal contention is that the committee&#39;s process of approval <br/>
        of their home schooling activity runs counter to their &quot;learner-led&quot; approach <br/>
        to education, which they claim permits them to facilitate the child&#39;s <br/>
        exploration of his or her own interests. (/A/) _*As the judge indicates in her <br/>
*_        _*findings on this point, &quot;This educational philosophy militates against <br/>
*_        _*the development of a concrete &#39;curriculum.&#39;*&quot;_ At the same time, the judge <br/>
        found that (/B/) _*the committee had no objection to the &quot;parents using this method <br/>
*_        _*of education,&quot; only that they had to provide the school committee with <br/>
*_        _*a home schooling plan that was sufficiently detailed to allow the committee <br/>
*_        _*to assess**  the children&#39;s educational level and their progress <br/>
*_        _*on the parents&#39; home schooling program.*_ It is settled that &quot;the approval <br/>
        process, under /G. L. c. 76, ยง 1/, ... must not be conditioned on <br/>
        requirements that are not essential to the State interest in insuring <br/>
        that &#39;all the children shall be educated.&#39;&quot; /Care and Protection of <br/>
        Charles, 399 Mass. at 337./  (/C/) _*However, prior approval of the superintendent <br/>
*_        _*or committee is a prerequisite to removal of children from school and <br/>
*_        _*to the commencement of a home schooling program.*_ /Commonwealth v. Renfrew, <br/>
        332 Mass. 492, 494, 126 N.E.2d 109 (1950)/ (interpreting a predecessor <br/>
        statute). Care and Protection of Charles, supra at 330.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With the first part of the finding underscored:<br/>
<br/>
     (/A/) the &quot;Judge&quot; notes that given a learner led approach <br/>
(/unschooling/ ) a curriculum is illogical.<br/>
<br/>
Given the second underscored:<br/>
<br/>
     (/B/) The &quot;Judge&quot; littigated that a committee&#39;s interest in <br/>
illogical persuits is more important<br/>
    than the parents interest in association with family.  Further by <br/>
implication that such an illogical<br/>
    committee is capable of assessment.  (if you will illogical <br/>
paperwork for the state committee)<br/>
<br/>
Given the third underscored:<br/>
<br/>
    (/C/) Unschooling is unrecognized and your family will be <br/>
dissociated (parents from children) if<br/>
    you tresspass.<br/>
<br/>
/So putting it all together/:<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
We will destroy your family if you attempt to unschool.<br/>
We do assure however:<br/>
<br/>
_*the committee*__* had no objection to the &quot;parents using this method <br/>
*__*of education,*_&quot;<br/>
_**_<br/>
<br/>
_**_<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It does strike as being a little more involved than the reading that Luz <br/>
Shosie and Ned Vare gave it.<br/>
It is pretty indicative of the current reguard the various governments <br/>
hold to residents, and<br/>
more and more so the other way around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think pointed jokes work best in an audience well informed about the<br/>
nuances of the topic. Then the over the top generalizations can be see as<br/>
either funnily on the mark or unfunnily off the mark rather than potentially<br/>
misleading and confusing.<br/>
