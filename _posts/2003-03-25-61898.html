<div id="ygrps-yiv-394567983">&lt;&lt;I do think television is addictive-- our<br/>
physiology has no way of dealing with it, because it is so different<br/>
than anything in nature, and believe it or not, we have evolved over<br/>
millenia to be part of nature. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s like saying our physiology has no way of dealing with<br/>
communication.    We evolved as communicators, we&#39;ve developed diverse<br/>
and specialized languages and writing and symbols.  <br/>
Television is another form of our evolving communication.   Surely you<br/>
have a telephone?  A radio?   A CD player?   Surely you&#39;ve read a<br/>
newspaper?  A book?   A road sign?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think of reading as unnatural?   Our ancient ancestors weren&#39;t<br/>
readers.  Do you think human physiology is unequipped to deal with<br/>
reading?<br/>
<br/>
Does your physiology deal with cooked vegetables, because we didn&#39;t<br/>
evolve on cooked foods or baked goods. (hard to believe, isn&#39;t it?  No<br/>
brownies?)    We didn&#39;t evolve with blenders and ovens and computers and<br/>
airplanes and washing machines and hot water on demand and toothbrushes<br/>
and toilet paper and soap.  We DID evolve with thinking brains and the<br/>
ability to imagine and invent what we needed and wanted.   <br/>
<br/>
TV can&#39;t hurt you, only your own ideas about it can.    <br/>
<br/>
Of course not every human invention has been a good idea, (high heels<br/>
come immediately to mind) but I have to tell you I think we can all stand<br/>
a little more communication.   You must secretly think so too or you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be using that unnatural e mail gizmo. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, waiting for someone to invent a cat who changes his own litter<br/>
pan... OH, but my cat DOES watch TV.   Evolution in progress.  (or,<br/>
possibly, just a strange cat)</div>

<br/>
Television covers many traditional, fairly ancient, and non-interactive <br/>
things like theatre and public speaking, concerts to which the peasants are <br/>
invited (if they&#39;re quiet, or if they dance way off to the side), masques (in <br/>
which only the most important guests actually participated).  Mass.  Being in <br/>
a Catholic area, there is always mass on TV, and that&#39;s cool for bedridden <br/>
elderly Catholics.  My neighbor across the street couldn&#39;t get out of her <br/>
house for the last several years of her life, but she loved watching <br/>
religious TV, and mass.<br/>
<br/>
Mass was never really &quot;audience participation&quot; until very lately (and not <br/>
always, even now).<br/>
Theatre needs an audience, but so does TV.  They just don&#39;t &quot;participate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the cool thing about watching a movie at home as opposed to in the <br/>
theatre, or a video of a play as opposed to a live performance is you can <br/>
TALK.  You can ask questions.  You can pause to go to the bathroom or get <br/>
food.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much cool stuff I&#39;ve done with my kids, we could never have <br/>
begun to put on Henry V as well as Kenneth Brannagh did!    We couldn&#39;t have <br/>
come up with Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Spartacus.  Enemy Mine.<br/>

<br/>
I forgot to say...  <br/>
I think watching TV or movies is more natural than reading is.<br/>
But I think people are pretty bright to have developed writing and movies, <br/>
and my kids are pretty bright to have figured out so much from and about both <br/>
of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-932789265">Great post Deb. What more can I say?<br/>
<br/>
  They do have cats that go on the toilet and litter boxes that clean themselves. Gee, what more could you want??<br/>
