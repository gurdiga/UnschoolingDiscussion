<div id="ygrps-yiv-827477900">Hi Annette:<br/>
<br/>
Wow what a handful and a challenge you have.  It&#39;s been a challenge with Zak, <br/>
whose quite energetic, to stick to some ground rules.  One of the first <br/>
things I learned is consistency, consistency, consistency.... We don&#39;t answer <br/>
Zak if he shouts from another room.  We&#39;ve talked about this rule before.  If <br/>
he wants me to do something for him he has to come to me.  We do the same for <br/>
him though, we don&#39;t shout across rooms for him to come to us.  This way we <br/>
model the behavior we want.  Zak has choices and consequences and now he&#39;s 5 <br/>
he understands what that means.  I try to make the consequences natural but <br/>
sometimes there are none.<br/>
<br/>
We use 1-2-3 as well and that has worked very well with him.  If he wants a <br/>
cookie and a baloon when we go to the grocery store then he needs to follow <br/>
the 3 rules for good behavior in the store, which are holding or standing <br/>
next to the cart, no running away and only picking up items when I tell him <br/>
otherwise he doesn&#39;t get the cookie and baloon.  And I stick to it... It only <br/>
took him a couple of times to learn I meant it.<br/>
<br/>
Zak&#39;s just started this PLEASE MUM, PLEASE MUM, PLEASE MUM when I&#39;ve already <br/>
answered the question.  I just ignore the please and change the subject by <br/>
asking him something else to distract him.<br/>
<br/>
Having friends over is a priviledge and mabye some leverage you could use <br/>
with his behavior.  Figure out what you want him to do and then use the <br/>
things he wants as leverage.  I know it sounds manipulating but it&#39;s not.  If <br/>
you want him to clean up his room then it&#39;s simple.  &quot;When you clean up your <br/>
room then BLANK can come over to play&quot;  &quot;When you take the dog for a walk <br/>
then you can BLANK&quot; whatever it is.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that for us it was so much easier to give him what he wanted and then <br/>
we realized we were not doing him any favors.<br/>
<br/>
Calling me or hubbie names is an absolute no, no and then things he loves get <br/>
taken away.  His Thomas Train track has been in a time out for up to 3 days <br/>
at one time, when he was in preschool and called me a name.  That way he knew <br/>
how serious I was.  Soon stopped that behavior.  <br/>
<br/>
I have learned to detach myself from feeling bad for him if he has <br/>
inappropriate behavior because he obviously doesnt&#39; feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
We also do lots and lots of praize... Lots of catching him doing something <br/>
good.  If I walk through the living room and he&#39;s not pushing his baby <br/>
brother over I tell him &quot;Wow you are playing so nicely with Max, you must be <br/>
so proud of yourself&quot;... or &quot;I see how kind you are being to your baby <br/>
brother and I&#39;m very impressed with your behaviour&quot;.  Yes it&#39;s much harder <br/>
work to do that, but in the long run I believe it will payoff.  We are <br/>
already seeing the results with Zak, who would be like your boys if he had <br/>
his way.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t accept that <br/>
 behaviour, it only makes you miserable and makes them brattier <br/>
 every day.  I feel that a child doesn&#39;t just start doing these things <br/>
 without learning it from somewhere, whether it is from television, <br/>
 their Father, a friend, or relative, it had to have come from <br/>
 somewhere.  By accepting it you are enforcing their bad behaviour <br/>
 and turning them into the type of man that no woman should ever <br/>
 have to suffer.  The way a boy treats his Mother is reflected years <br/>
 later in his treatment of his wife and probably his children too. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Sue:  I loved your e-mail with this answer and then when I scrolled down to <br/>
the bottom and saw you were responsible for raising 9 of them, I know you <br/>
know what you are are talking about!!!  My hat is off to you... If you can <br/>
raise 9 successfully, it gives me hope of raising my 2 boys.<br/>
<br/>
I think you hit the nail on the head when you talk about &quot;self-esteem&quot;.. I <br/>
think we do worry too much about that in this day and age and forget that in <br/>
the future and the real world nobody is going to care about their self esteem <br/>
and if they are rude to someone and the other person doesn&#39;t like it, they <br/>
may get shot at, not just told where to go.  Learning to live with others in <br/>
this world is something I want to teach my boys and that not every wish and <br/>
whim of theirs is granted without some kind of consequence (whether that <br/>
consequence be good or bad)...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the wake up call with your e-mail... It made me realize I&#39;m <br/>
doing the right thing by ignoring the requested shouted across the room.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369937566">Just thought I&#39;d point out that &quot;boredom&quot; is anger spread thin.. Whenever I <br/>
see that applied to kids I wonder what they are really angry about.  It&#39;s <br/>
certainly easier to figure it out with adults....Children have to learn that <br/>
word and it just covers up something else that&#39;s festering underneath.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d bring this to people&#39;s attention.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, I hope they were raised successfully, of the grown up <br/>
ones, none are in trouble with the law, they all hold down full time <br/>
jobs [which in Australia is not an easy task for young people, with <br/>
a very high youth unemployment rate], treat thier partners and <br/>
children well and help each other out when problems arise.<br/>
<br/>
I miss these wonderful young people, they are my friends as well <br/>
as my children, however we keep in touch via email and <br/>
occassional phone conversations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think you hit the nail on the head when you talk about &quot;self-esteem&quot;..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read anarticle recently that said that most sociopaths had a high <br/>
self esteem, even though they weren&#39;t held in high esteem by <br/>
anyone else.   While it is important for a child to feel loved and an <br/>
important member of a family they must also learn humility and <br/>
that others are as of much importance as they are.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is so right, no matter how high their self esteem is when they <br/>
one day realize that no-one particularly likes them because they <br/>
have the social skills of Attilla the Hun it will probably be too late to <br/>
change their behaviour.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Dawn, when I wrote that email I was expecting to have <br/>
started a bit of a flame war, I didn&#39;t want that to be the case and <br/>
was pleasantly surprised when it didn&#39;t happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen too many kids turn out bad, that could have turned out <br/>
just fine, young Andrew I spoke of had some wonderful qualities, <br/>
but his Mother could only see the bad in him so eventually it was <br/>
mostly bad that was left behind, the other boy I spoke of who&#39;s <br/>
Mom always had excuses for his bad behaviour learned every <br/>
excuse in the book and probably still blames everyone/everything <br/>
except himself when he beats on someone or steals.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that we are born with our basic temperament, that there <br/>
is little anyone can do to change this [thank heavens for that, I love <br/>
the diversity of human nature] we need to learn to work with our <br/>
children&#39;s personalities not against them.   There is a key to each <br/>
child and unfortunatley we often don&#39;t have enough interaction with <br/>
fellow human beings as children to learn this fact before we have <br/>
children of our own.   With small families isolated from extended <br/>
family, two parents off to work, kids in daycare where they are <br/>
taught from an early age to CONFORM and be alike it is becoming <br/>
more and more difficult for kids to be themselves and to develope <br/>
their unique personality in good ways.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d better stop rambling now, there&#39;s hay to stack in the barn!<br/>
