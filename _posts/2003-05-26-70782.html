<div id="ygrps-yiv-399067030"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&quot;Speaking of families which have begun their mindful parenting early on:<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the absence of a bunch of rules, the space becomes flooded with a bunch of <br/>
thought and good judgment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I felt the need to isolate this brilliant statement. As the mom of three<br/>
teenagers who consistently make great choices it speaks volumes. Go, Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
Similiar in flavor, was one a ways back that was along these lines . . .<br/>
I&#39;d rather have influence on my children forever than control for a short<br/>
time - <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t remember who spoke along those lines, but it was another keeper.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>
