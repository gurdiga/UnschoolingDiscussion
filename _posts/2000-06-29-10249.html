<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578720307">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can shift some of the way we pursue the threads to be more positive and<br/>
productive. My idea is to say what we have found helpful to us in our lives and<br/>
experiences without criticizing or negative comments about how anyone else does<br/>
things. I am not suggesting we stick our heads in the sand, but that we elevate<br/>
our input to constructive rather than destructive. The reason we like this list<br/>
is to connect and learn from others. I&#39;m not saying we cannot speak of anything<br/>
negative. I am saying that if we say what works for us and why, no one can argue<br/>
or feel hurt by that. We can keep the traffic to helping each other rather than<br/>
hurting each other. I don&#39;t expect everyone to agree. I think people can learn<br/>
more by positive example than by feeling defensive. I hope that the positive<br/>
environment can encourage others to contribute as well beyond the cast of<br/>
regulars. Of course life is made of serious emotionally charged issues that we<br/>
don&#39;t want to ignore. I would love to explore all these on a &quot;what works for my<br/>
family&quot; basis without any &quot;and others are wrong because...&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So am I full of it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735485799">No, i think you&#39;re right on... but i do have to say that after 6 years on the <br/>
internet i find that tone is often read into things where none was <br/>
intended... people have often been put off and even incensed by things i&#39;ve <br/>
said... i think sometimes they are coming into the conversation with their <br/>
own personal baggage, if you will, that can trigger defensive emotional <br/>
response... it&#39;s a hard one... happens all the time in email groups from my <br/>
own personal experience... usually it ends up with &quot;rules&quot; which i am averse <br/>
to, or it ends up with someone &quot;unsubscribing,&quot; which is of course their <br/>
choice... i opt for neither... and i think you suggestion of sharing personal <br/>
experiences is a good one... i find that when i am offering my opinion and i <br/>
make it about &quot;me&quot; rather than attacking someone, that it communicates my <br/>
intent far better... unfortunately, some of us over identify with our <br/>
opinions on an emotional level and respond inappropriately... although, as <br/>
yet, i haven&#39;t really seen any of this in the unschooling list... maybe i <br/>
should read on...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     No, Kathy, you&#39;re definitely not full of it!  What you&#39;re saying makes a <br/>
lot of sense because I think a lot of discussions in person are like that.  <br/>
We relate our experiences, problems, successes, and so forth, and we all <br/>
learn from one another about life.  I am sorry if I sounded too argumentive <br/>
myself in my posts. <br/>
      I thought about some of these issues during the past couple of days <br/>
while I was gone and I think I realized what my feelings are.  I believe it <br/>
is normal and appropriate for people to have strong convictions about certain <br/>
issues.  I believe it is far better and more constructive to explain, even <br/>
strongly, why one believes a certain thing is wrong without attacking the <br/>
people themselves or their characters.    This can be so painful (I&#39;ve <br/>
experienced some of it myself in years gone by) and either makes the person <br/>
feel even more down about him/herself or evokes a defensive, angry reaction.<br/>
     I don&#39;t believe we should judge or categorize people themselves as <br/>
selfish, stupid, losers, whatever labels.  We don&#39;t know what is in their <br/>
hearts and it is so easy to then pat ourselves on the back for being BETTER <br/>
than those people.<br/>
     In thinking about what has worked for myself and my family, I can say <br/>
that a simple lifestyle, more time than money, days full of learning and <br/>
growing for every person (including adults) according to his/her passions at <br/>
the time, helping others in whatever ways we can, and communicating with many <br/>
different people...these are all things that have made our lives so much <br/>
better.  I feel that there is still so much to learn and so much room for <br/>
improvement for myself.  <br/>
     Anyway, hope these thoughts aren&#39;t too random to be cohesive....<br/>
<br/>
