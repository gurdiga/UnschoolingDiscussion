<div id="ygrps-yiv-331101056">One thing that has started to shift for me since thinking about  <br/>
unschooling is the idea that all our kids have &quot;too many&quot; toys. This  <br/>
is a conversation my friends have all the time, how our kids have so  <br/>
many toys, so many more than we had, it&#39;s like they just proliferate,  <br/>
what can be done? Even six months ago, I was saying, &quot;The only thing  <br/>
I&#39;d do differently as a mother is be more selective about which toys,  <br/>
and how many, I let into the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I started reading these lists, and a few things started to get  <br/>
clear for me.<br/>
<br/>
First, I realized I was parroting the &quot;too many toys&quot; mantra without  <br/>
really thinking about it. It&#39;s what all my lefty, organic-food- <br/>
eating, Birkie-wearing friends say. Also, we&#39;re Quakers, so there&#39;s  <br/>
the whole burden of the Testimony of Simplicity hanging over our  <br/>
heads. So I was walking around saying, &quot;Too many toys! Too many  <br/>
toys!&quot; without ever thinking about what &quot;too many&quot; might really mean  <br/>
or why I thought there were too many (just because there are more  <br/>
than I had? Wrong answer! I want my kids to have lots more of lots of  <br/>
things than I had in my childhood!)<br/>
<br/>
Second, I realized that I had always had this other voice of regret  <br/>
in my head...like, I would see something and think, &quot;it would be so  <br/>
cool to get that for Eric...but he already has too many toys.&quot; I felt  <br/>
this cognitive dissonance because there were so many things I thought  <br/>
would be valuable and interesting for him that we didn&#39;t have, but I  <br/>
didn&#39;t think we could get because I thought we had too much stuff  <br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>
Third, I visited my friend down the street one day. This is a woman  <br/>
who owns so much stuff it scares me--her daughter has no fewer than  <br/>
six different winter coats, which would be too much for me--I&#39;m not  <br/>
capable of dealing with having to decide every day which coat my kid  <br/>
is going to wear! But she loves buying cute things for her daughter,  <br/>
and making those choices is pleasurable for them both. When I first  <br/>
met this friend, her daughter (an only child at that time) had so  <br/>
many toys, and so many that seemed like duplicates to me (like five  <br/>
different ride-on toys) that I wondered if she had been thinking of  <br/>
opening a day care!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I dropped by one day and her 4-year-old had set up a whole  <br/>
Fisher Price Little People village and was playing with it. Which  <br/>
reminded me of...<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, I remembered that when I was a kid, I never had enough of  <br/>
anything to do anything cool. Like, I&#39;d get a Legos starter set...and  <br/>
then never any more Legos. So I could never build anything cool. If  <br/>
my friend&#39;s daughter had been me, she would have gotten one Little  <br/>
People set...period. And I thought about how rotten that felt to me  <br/>
as a kid. How much I would have liked to have a whole village of  <br/>
Little People, or so many Legos I could build a castle.<br/>
<br/>
I no longer think we have &quot;too many&quot; toys. And I feel free to buy  <br/>
something new for the kids if I think they&#39;d enjoy it. It&#39;s much more  <br/>
pleasant than looking at my kids&#39; toy shelves and feeling sour  <br/>
because they have so much stuff by some arbitrary standard.<br/>

   <br/>
  I remember this same kind of thinking, and I realized that it wasn&#39;t my own thinking at all.  I was responding to similar kinds of peer pressure.  The difference for me was I&#39;m a spender at heart so I would go ahead and buy it anyway much of the time and then beat myself up for it.  Another thing I used to do is I would say to my kids since I bought you this..then you need to do that..fill in the this /that with toy/some chore.  In my mind then I could justify that they somehow &#39;earned&#39; it.  Such crap!  Making them earn something I wanted to buy anyway!!!<br/>
  The other thing that I finally stopped to notice is how much my kids learn from their toys and games.  Why would I want to limit that?  Then one day a school at home mom I know shared that she had just spent $500 on curriculum for the year.  Isn&#39;t it so great to spend that on toys, art supplies, books, games, software and outings rather than text books?<br/>
  I do understand the whole keeping things simple though and sometimes the amount of stuff can be a bit overwhelming.  But then I also realize what a blessing my kids&#39; outgrown stuff has been to other people, so it is truly out of abundance that we can share with others I think.<br/>
  It is just so great to hear about other moms that ENJOY buying stuff for their kids.  I knew I couldn&#39;t be alone out there!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even if you &quot;just&quot; limited it to what you would have spent if they  <br/>
were in school, or on a curriculum, it&#39;s still more justifiable. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I figured when the kids were young that every puzzle and book, globe/ <br/>
map & game was a part of unschooling.  And with three kids, it gets  <br/>
used again in no time, and shared, and seen differently.<br/>
<br/>
When someone wants to unschool because it&#39;s cheaper or free, I  <br/>
bristle some.<br/>
