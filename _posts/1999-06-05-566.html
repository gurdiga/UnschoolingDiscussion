<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334601689"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Most of the people I talk to about homeschooling are shocked when I <br/>
&gt;tell them that my children don&#39;t want to go to college and I&#39;m not going to <br/>
&gt;encourage it. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You make so many important points here -- my brother is 19, and probably the<br/>
smartest person I know, in a lot of different ways. He has musical<br/>
intelligence (he plays guitar in a ska-punk band and writes all their songs),<br/>
test-score intelligence (1420 on the SATs w/out studying at all), computer<br/>
intelligence (started writing manuals for computer games for money when he was<br/>
14), he&#39;s a good writer (had a chapter of a book published when he was 16, and<br/>
that chapter (and only that chapter) was reprinted in a natl games magazine),<br/>
etc, etc, etc... <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want to go to college. He&#39;s working at a job he absolutely adores,<br/>
he has his own apt. and an active life here, plus his band of course. There&#39;s<br/>
no way he&#39;d wanna leave, and he doesn&#39;t have TIME! He&#39;s doing great, but<br/>
people always freak out and talk about how his talents are being &quot;wasted&quot; --<br/>
imagine that, he&#39;s wasting his talents by using them in living his life!!! <br/>
<br/>
Now, I actually do want to go to college. Always have, not because of pushing<br/>
from my family or anything like that, but because I think the college<br/>
environment is one I would absolutely adore -- especially at the specific<br/>
colleges I like, all but one of which are itsy bitsy liberal arts colleges. <br/>
