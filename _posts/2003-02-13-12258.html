<br/>

&gt; {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{Connie}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been lucky so far.  My daughter has taken the things I&#39;ve learned about<br/>
&gt; parenting and gone a few steps farther.  Now I often look to her as a<br/>
&gt; parenting model.  I have no idea what kind of wives my sons will pick.  I<br/>
&gt; can only hope.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Tia.  It is VERY hard - but as we all know our children are on their <br/>
own paths.  Sometimes their journeys are delightful to watch, and sometimes <br/>
it breaks your heart.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Know what you mean.  My older boy is living in a sort of tent-cave and<br/>
survives by scrounging bottles and cans and whatever else he can find in<br/>
dumpsters.  (Good thing - bottle deposits)  He&#39;s the one whose father forced<br/>
me to put back in school after a year and a half of unschooling (or as close<br/>
as I could come under his watchful eyes.  He left again at 16 with his grade<br/>
8 and a belief that he was stupid . . . sigh.<br/>
