 </span></blockquote>Okay.  Someone among you asked my rituals for the season.  Here&#39;s an<br/>
interesting season ritual, though I&#39;ve only done it three times.  A<br/>
therapist would have a field day.<br/>
<br/>
On the evening of Thanksgiving Day, I gather up all the ads for the<br/>
After Thanksgiving Sale -- we don&#39;t celebrate Christmas, but the sales<br/>
are good, I&#39;m told (actually they just mark up the prices on all &quot;winter<br/>
<br/>
goods&quot;, and then take 40% off.)  I decide what I &#39;need&#39; or &#39;want&#39; (when<br/>
I say &quot;I&quot;, it is a &quot;corporate I&quot;, like in family.)  There&#39;s usually one<br/>
or at most two things, scattered around 6 or 7 different stores.  I get<br/>
up at 6:00 a.m., having told my daughters how important it is to arrive<br/>
early, and having convinced them of the superiority of each particular<br/>
item in the store which is our destination.<br/>
<br/>
We arrive at the first store a little before 7.  Stand in line.<br/>
Purchase item.  Then on to the next store, and the next.  Sometimes we<br/>
have to choose among colors, or designs, or what-not.  But no<br/>
tomfoolery.  We stick to the list.  We don&#39;t browse.  We don&#39;t look at<br/>
pants in the store where we buy jackets, or ties where we get<br/>
bedspreads. We don&#39;t get distracted by trinkets.  We avoid &quot;smellville&quot;<br/>
(that&#39;s what we call the cosmetics section.) And we stick to our list<br/>
of  stores. No straying.  By 11:00 A.M. we are home, 14 or 15 items in<br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
By 11:30, after contemplating our booty, I have convinced myself, and<br/>
most of the family members, that at least half the things we have<br/>
purchased we didn&#39;t really need, or they aren&#39;t particular nice, or they<br/>
<br/>
aren&#39;t any superior to the same item we saw for 10% of the price we paid<br/>
<br/>
in the local thrift store.  Over the next 3 days, we will bring at least<br/>
<br/>
half the items back.  I&#39;ll end up sending the extra money to India (or<br/>
to wherever I think it is needed.) -- or, it is true, in some cases,<br/>
I&#39;ll exchange what we bought for different stuff. But I&#39;ll have burned<br/>
up 10 gallons of gas, generated fair quantities of stress, and used up<br/>
good chunks of three days which we could have spent together in more<br/>
life-fulfilling activities in the process.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is about my affirming that I have enough money in my<br/>
pocket, that I can do the mall thing like anyone else (I only do it once<br/>
<br/>
a year!), and that the trappings of middle class America are there to me<br/>
<br/>
for the taking.  And then, after about four hours, nausea sets in, and I<br/>
<br/>
begin retracing my steps.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else suffer from this malady?<br/>
<br/>
David Albert<br/>
<br/>
(I have an abbreviated version of this malady which is specifically<br/>
related to K-Mart, which can occur at any time of the year.  I go there<br/>
to buy underwear -- all right, I&#39;m cheap!  I&#39;ll wheel the cart around,<br/>
finding all kinds of different  stuff I need or might use.  But only for<br/>
<br/>
approximately 7 minutes. It&#39;s always 7 minutes. If they can get me out<br/>
of the store within 7 minutes, they can ring up a big sale.  But it<br/>
never happens.  Nausea sets in at the 7 minute mark.  I start dropping<br/>
items out of my cart randomly throughout the store.  I&#39;m sure they<br/>
wonder how the galoshes ended up next to deoderant.  Until there is<br/>
nothing, or almost nothing left in the cart but the underwear.  If the<br/>
checkout line is more than 5 people long, I am likely to abandon the<br/>
cart and leave.  I have a lot of old underwear.<br/>
<br/>
hmmmm....)<br/>
<br/>
(I have a school/homeschool version of this same disorder, but I think I<br/>
<br/>
have shared enough affliction for one evening.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have the same problem<br/>
BUT it is WALmart<br/>
And I am the sucker who is abandoning and not adpopting these poor homeless<br/>
items and then replacing them for other models....I am in the store for<br/>
several hours and then I return home and find that I do have alot of old<br/>
underwear, but I have a new hair barrette (which feels most uncomfortable if<br/>
attempted to be worn as an undergarment)....I am the silly woman who cannot<br/>
leave the store without purchasing several items that I KNOW will make my<br/>
life easier.....<br/>
That is how I justify my purchases (I have even convinced my husband of<br/>
this!).  I know that I do not lead a life of consumerism--is that the<br/>
correct terminology...BUT I do get caught up in the BUY<br/>
I have aproximately 1,200 worth of silly stuff on LAY away ---why lay<br/>
away--then I can pretend that I am not paying for it...I do think that I was<br/>
living some kind of fantasy as I am not even sure what items I have or NEED<br/>
if any...<br/>
I would not be surprised to pay for it all and come home with a juicer and<br/>
some perfume (I am allergic) and some really silly underwear (finally) that<br/>
rides up my BUTT!<br/>
I hope that I survive my crisis and I do know the trick--you have to pay for<br/>
lay away and then you can RETURN it all<br/>
YAHOOOO--otherwise they charge you some ridiculous fee....BUT maybe they<br/>
should----a &quot;SUCKER fee&quot;<br/>
I am trying hard and each year it seems to get worse---I think it is a<br/>
feeling of self worth that is placed upon these buying items and being the<br/>
best etc..that I am getting caught up in<br/>
And it is so funny because when we get together for the holidays, all the<br/>
kids want to do is go to the playground or chase each other about the house<br/>
BUT leggos<br/>
they are forever!<br/>
Maybe I should make a list of what I want and then donate the rest of the<br/>
items to charity--teach myself something EH?<br/>
BUT I am sure that it would include everything that I have on lay away!<br/>
Geez<br/>
Maybe tomorrow I will pick up one of my lay aways and return it all........<br/>
WAIT now I remember what is on one of them and wait I want that and that AND<br/>
I really need that and that AND that would make my life alot easier<br/>
MAYBE I should drink a beer or some valium--is there some drug for this?<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I gather up all the ads for the After Thanksgiving Sale -- we don&#39;t<br/>

&#39;need&#39; or &#39;want&#39; (when I say &quot;I&quot;, it is a &quot;corporate I&quot;, like in family.)<br/>
 There&#39;s usually one or at most two things, scattered around 6 or 7<br/>
different stores.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	David, I was with you up to this point. I used to have a ritual similar<br/>
to the rest of yours, but somehow I gave it up. Now, when I look at the<br/>
ads, and see the occasional item I &quot;need,&quot; and think about the lines, <br/>
and the parking lot jams, and the stress-induced rudness I may encounter,<br/>
I say to myself, &quot;If I *don&#39;t* buy this item, will I feel a huge lack in<br/>
my life?&quot; The answer is virtually always, &quot;No.&quot; The ads go in the<br/>
recycling bins, and I stay in my jammies, drink tea, and read an<br/>
interesting book I&#39;ve been wanting to finish.<br/>
	After several years of working at it, my family has dropped out of the<br/>
Christmas Frenzy. We don&#39;t celebrate the holiday any more, having<br/>
switched to Solstice/Yule--where the focus is on togetherness, observing<br/>
Nature&#39;s cycles, peace, and forgiveness. We still give a few gifts to<br/>
those closest to us. The great majority of these are self-made, using<br/>
whatever materials currently interest us. This year, it is small clay<br/>
ornaments and bowls.<br/>
	There is so much &quot;pressure&quot; to stay in the Holiday Madness--from the<br/>
psychological barrage of advertisements, to relatives who insist on<br/>
sending stuff you couldn&#39;t care about, just because they *have* to send<br/>
*something*-- it can be  a real challenge to break away from that habit.<br/>
Little by little, we do. Each step away from it brings us closer to a<br/>
meaningful holiday season.<br/>

Oh some other Susan I thought this was hilarious! My thing is books and <br/>
things I print off the web. I have went through 2 packs of paper so far with <br/>
things to read. And books! One of these books is going to change my life <br/>
4-ever if I ever get done printing so I can read it all.ROFL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532019467">I guess my procrastinating ways do me some good, since I never actually <br/>
make it out to any of the sales.  Instead, since all the stray change in the <br/>
house is our Christmas fund, (one way to limit spending), I look at all the <br/>
ads in the paper and get motivated and start frantically digging in the <br/>
crannies of the sofa.  By the time the weekend is over, I should have a <br/>
somewhat cleaner house, and some $50 in coinage but by then the fit will have <br/>
left me and it will be another week or so before I exchange it for bills at <br/>
the bank and blow it.  All rather silly really.  <br/>

unprepared for some crazy lunatice returning (before the holidays--they had<br/>
not even taken their return frenzy classes!)<br/>
Geez, but there is still alot to return and I hope that no one notices!<br/>
I am going to keep some stuff---well it is something I NEED I am sure<br/>
And then I am going to include a note--Like if I give them a game I will<br/>
give them a secret note that says that I will play it with them right then<br/>
or a picure to color or some type of toy and the next night a secret note<br/>
that says we are going to go to the park<br/>
