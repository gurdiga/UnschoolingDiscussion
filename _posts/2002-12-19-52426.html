<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053069201">We don&#39;t define who is and who isn&#39;t homeschooling - we leave it up to <br/>
people to do that for themselves. Common sense would tell us that <br/>
someone who sends their kid to school full time and does homework with <br/>
them in the evening is NOT homeschooling and nobody at NHEN would ever <br/>
consider that homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I know why the statement was made, however. There are people who are <br/>
really concerned that homeschooling,the term itself, should not be used <br/>
to describe anybody who has any involvement with public schools <br/>
whatsoever. They want NHEN to define homeschooling in that way - very <br/>
very specifically so that anybody with any such involvement would be <br/>
defined as NOT a homeschooler. Our problem with this is that, first, <br/>
there is disagreement within the homeschooling community over this very <br/>
issue - in fact it is an EXTREMELY hot topic and has the potential to <br/>
tear the homeschooling community apart. As individuals we NHEN board <br/>
members have our own opinions, of course, but we have to keep our <br/>
specific and rather limited organizational mission in full view - NHEN <br/>
provides information and networking opportunities for anyone with an <br/>
interest in homeschooling (this would include legislators, news media, <br/>
librarians, for example). Our information is available to all, we don&#39;t <br/>
discriminate based on religion, political views, homeschooling style or <br/>
other such choices, including the choice of utilizing some sort of <br/>
public school services. However, NHEN very strongly supports the right <br/>
of parents to take full responsibility for their own children&#39;s <br/>
education free of any government involvement at all. We have a lengthy <br/>
document, for example, which provides strong arguments as to why <br/>
homeschoolers should not be subject to any government regulation or <br/>
oversight. We&#39;ve provided that document to homeschoolers to use when <br/>
they have been faced with threats of increased regulation.<br/>
<br/>
We are very very clearly supportive of parents rights to choose full <br/>
educational independence.<br/>
<br/>
We have no reason to &quot;define&quot; homeschooling, though. Our work doesn&#39;t <br/>
require us to do that - we provide our information to all.<br/>
<br/>
There are those who want us to make some sort of statement that we do <br/>
not support parental choices which involve public school district <br/>
programs such as hybrid homeschooling/classroom schooling or such as <br/>
publically-funded charter schools which support homebased learning or <br/>
public school independent study programs, etc. They wish us to make a <br/>
statement that homeschooling is defined ONLY as parents educating their <br/>
children without any government involvement or oversight. NHEN has <br/>
chosen not to make such a statement - primarily because it is a huge <br/>
gigantic can of worms that we simply do not feel any need to open - we <br/>
feel that our scarce time and energy and resources are better used in <br/>
providing actual support for freedom from oversigh, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, NHEN doesn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; the work that should belong to local and <br/>
state people - we provide backup support for them, we help them get <br/>
connected with people who might be able to provide assistance and with <br/>
information that might help them - but we don&#39;t act FOR them.<br/>
<br/>
So - that&#39;s the long answer.<br/>
The short answer is that there are a few people out there who want NHEN <br/>
to be something it is not - a sort of secular HSLDA - which will define <br/>
who is and who isn&#39;t a legitimate homeschooler. Because we don&#39;t define <br/>
it, they are making up extreme and ridiculous scenarios such as the one <br/>
described in your post. We don&#39;t want to even START down the road of <br/>
saying: &quot;Yes, YOU are a homeschooler and YOU are not and YOU are and <br/>
You aren&#39;t.&quot; Trying to get that right across all states - some with <br/>
legal definitions of homeschooling, some without, some with public <br/>
school home-based learning programs that involve less government <br/>
oversight than other states require in their actual homeschooling laws <br/>
- it is just WAY too much - too difficult - to messy - and we have very <br/>
limited resources. Our time is better spent elsewhere. So we don&#39;t have <br/>
such a statement. Not having a statement about who is a &quot;real&quot; <br/>
homeschooler and who is not - doesn&#39;t mean that ANYBODY is considered a <br/>
homeschooler. If someone says they don&#39;t want to make a statement about <br/>
who is a real Christian, that doesn&#39;t mean she thinks Jews are <br/>
Christians.<br/>

Thank you SO much for that clarification Pam. It fits right in with what I <br/>
felt NHEN does.<br/>
I had posted their information when someone else had mentioned HSLDA and then <br/>
this other person chimed in with why they would not support NHEN.<br/>
Which is too bad. I posted what you wrote and hopefully that will help clear <br/>
things up.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
