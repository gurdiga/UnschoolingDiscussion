 </span></blockquote>Hi Michelle,<br/>
How old is your son?  Mine will be 6 next month.  I would like to hear about <br/>
some of your new ideas for resources.  You can email me personally if you&#39;d <br/>
rather, but I&#39;m others would like to hear, too.  What I did was buy one of <br/>
those plastic stands that has 3 big drawers.  One drawer has markers, <br/>
crayons, chalk, and other writing tools.  The next drawer has all different <br/>
types of paper.  Then there&#39;s one with all sorts of &quot;making materials&quot; like <br/>
those little pom pom balls, pipe cleaners, googly eyes, even bags of clay, <br/>
and playdough.  I have it in the kitchen next to the table where he can <br/>
access it and go for it whenever he feels the need.  Yesterday I had to buy <br/>
another one.  It will be great, as we needed a seperate drawer just for his <br/>
paints.  These drawers are pretty big.  It cost me about $18, it even comes <br/>
with wheels you can attatch.  Hey, you could even roll it outside on a nice <br/>
day!  He&#39;s got a Little Tykes small table that we often take outside in the <br/>
summer for playdough (no clean-up).  Just wanted to share an idea.  :O)<br/>
