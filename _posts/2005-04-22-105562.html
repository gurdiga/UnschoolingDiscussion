<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271963179">Hello everyone,<br/>
I need some advice and encouragement.  Today I received a knock on my door from a Children&#39;s Protective Services officer.  It seems that someone (anonymously) turned me in to CPS for neglect.  The report said that I have a 9yo son that has never been to school (true), that I am not registered to homeschool (not true), and that we live in filth (not true, though I am a packrat, and things are a little cluttered).  <br/>
It also said that I do not teach Richard anything.  I told the officer that I don&#39;t break things down into &quot;subjects,&quot; and that is where someone may have gotten confused.  I told her that at the moment we have about 25 books about Egypt checked out from the library, and with those Richard is learning everything from math and science to language and history.  This is all true.  I did mostly check those books out for my niece, but since then Richard has gotten into them too.  I told her that we do lots of short trips to interesting and historic places, and that learning is everywhere.   When she asked if we &quot;do math,&quot; I told her that we did, though I am sure that my idea of &quot;doing math&quot; and hers are a little different.<br/>
The officer interviewed me and Richard, and will be back next week to tour my house.  I am a little worried, because I tend to freeze up when confronted, I am not very good with words.  I think I explained what we do pretty well though. <br/>
I talked to Richard a little bit about it.  I told him that it may confuse the matter to use the term unschooling, and that he should just say we homeschool.  I hope he doesn&#39;t feel that I am being dishonest.  <br/>
  I am kind of numb at this point, but I cannot believe that someone has done this.  I keep going over and over in my head who could have called, I know that it is not healthy to obsess about it, but I cannot help it.  <br/>
I had to come up with someone to vouch for me, and I had a real hard time because I don&#39;t know who called!  I did finally come up with someone who I know in my heart didn&#39;t call and will have good things to say, but I feel so untrusting of everyone right now.  <br/>
Any advice would be appreciated!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Katy<br/>

Unschooling is homeschooling.<br/>
It really bothers me when anyone says otherwise.<br/>
It&#39;s not dishonest.  <br/>

 <br/>
What I would do is come up with the same kinds of things I would put in a  <br/>
portfolio.  If you have a calendar with records of museum visits,  playgroups, <br/>
camping, whatever--you could make a list.  <br/>
 <br/>
You might want to consider something like these (there are three here, if  <br/>
you follow the links) and make one of your own or at least use it as ideas for  <br/>
things to present or consider:<br/>

Hi, Katy --<br/>
<br/>
What state do you live in?  Are you in touch with groups of homeschoolers in your state?  I ask because education laws vary widely from state to state.  It&#39;s important that you be able to show that you are in compliance with the mandatory education laws in your state.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll get through this.  Hang in there and be calm.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410039002">Katy, I agree that you should find out what the laws are. You know <br/>
you&#39;ve been following the law, however, you should find out what the <br/>
law is. If there are no signs of abuse, then why did they sit and <br/>
talk and want to come back for a tour of the house? You should call <br/>
the board of education and find out about this, then make sure your <br/>
portfolio is in order. <br/>
<br/>
Why did they say they wanted a tour? Did you agree to this? It seems <br/>
to me that they were given too much opportunity to invade your space <br/>
and right to homeschool your child. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, homeschool/unschool - I don&#39;t think you did anything wrong <br/>
in explaining this to your child that he is homeschooled. If you can <br/>
simply explain to him that the thought to some may be shocking and <br/>
seem as if you&#39;re doing nothing. There&#39;s another lesson: how many <br/>
more historical figures were persecuted/ousted/labeled negatively, <br/>
because their thoughts were different from the mainstream, or those <br/>
in power? <br/>
<br/>
I would like to continue to be updated on this, please post your <br/>
findings and results,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23449432">Were I in your place, I would seriously consider contacting a lawyer<br/>
as what has taken place appears to be a violation of your (and your<br/>
son&#39;s) rights under the fourth amendment.<br/>
<br/>
It appears you are in WA, where, in order to be in compliance with the<br/>
law, you need to register, qualify (college credits or qualifying<br/>
course), immunization records, and test annually.  You do not need,<br/>
according to state law, to keep a record of how you do things, and,<br/>
moreover, &quot;all decisions relating to philosophy or doctrine, selection<br/>
of books, teaching materials and curriculum, and methods, timing, and<br/>
place in the provision or evaluation of home-based instruction shall<br/>
be the responsibility of the parent except for matters specifically<br/>
referred to in this chapter.&quot; (RCW Chapter 28A.200.020).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.k12.wa.us/PrivateEd/HomeBasedEd/regulations.aspx">http://www.k12.wa.us/PrivateEd/HomeBasedEd/regulations.aspx</a><br/>
<br/>
Assuming you are in compliance with state law, you have fulfilled the<br/>
compulsory attendance law.  (RCW Chapter 28A.225.010)<br/>
<br/>
I would NOT allow any CPS personnal in my home without a lawyer (mine)<br/>
present, and I would NOT allow CPS to interview my child without<br/>
counsel present.  They rely on people&#39;s fear of their power to go<br/>
beyond their authority (and search homes and take children).  I&#39;d call<br/>
a lawyer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564632711">I have always been told that if they show up at my door to not let <br/>
them in.  I do not have to invite them in my home.  HSLDA will have <br/>
some good advice for you but I think you have to be a member?  I would <br/>
be careful at this point because you did o.k. a home visit and if you <br/>
now say they aren&#39;t allowed they will think you have something to <br/>
hide.  It&#39;s a nervous thing to think about and I hope all turns out <br/>
well for you!<br/>

I&#39;d contact an attorney and my state organization, if there is one.<br/>

99 percent of the time these things are just dropped - I&#39;m surprised <br/>
they even want to come back at all, though, so that&#39;s, in itself, <br/>
unusual.<br/>

Please let us know for sure what state you&#39;re in - you never know, <br/>
