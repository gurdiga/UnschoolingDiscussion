<div id="ygrps-yiv-533567224">Hi Annette,<br/>
<br/>
A sudden change like that would probably indicate some kind of trauma, but<br/>
it might not even be external.  He may just have figured out that everybody<br/>
dies and what that means or seen something on television that frightened<br/>
him.  What does he say to you about it?  My thought would be to let him be<br/>
as clingy as he needs to be, when he feels secure and safe he will be better<br/>
able to express himself to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307859612">Annette, <br/>
My little boy, 9, doesn&#39;t like to be upstairs by himself either.  His<br/>
fear developed quite suddenly also.  We couldn&#39;t figure it out and he was<br/>
reluctant to explain.  Finally he told us about a bad dream he&#39;d had. <br/>
That&#39;s it. A dream, but strange and frightening enough to affect him<br/>
profoundly.  After a lot of thinking and talking we realized his dream<br/>
occurred after a report he&#39;d seen on the news about a child abducted from<br/>
her home.   In this news report they talked about boys being more likely<br/>
to be abducted and gave statistics, etc.  A child should be able to<br/>
believe they are safe at home, and this opened my sons eyes to the<br/>
reality that sometimes you&#39;re not safe anywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
Sudden behavioral changes usually happen for a reason.  Someone may have<br/>
said something that frightened him, or sent his mind thinking about<br/>
frightening possibilities.  It may even have been another child telling a<br/>
story.  He may have over heard a conversation about locking the windows<br/>
at night or home security.  He may have seen, at someone else&#39;s house<br/>
even, something , anything frightening on TV.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can get the wrong idea easily.  My son has always been homeschooled,<br/>
but before we had decided on homeschooling, when my son was 4, an old<br/>
Aunt said:<br/>
&quot; Next year you&#39;ll go off to school and have a teacher and be with other<br/>
kids.&quot;  <br/>
My son took this to mean he would be leaving us for good, never to return<br/>
home again.<br/>
He was a lot younger than your son, but still, you can&#39;t always be sure<br/>
if they have reasoned a situation out in the right way.  <br/>
<br/>
Has your mother ever suggested in front of him that he needs to be away<br/>
from you?<br/>
Could he be thinking there&#39;s a plan developing to send him away? <br/>
<br/>
Then the other more horrible possibility that someone in his life has<br/>
frightened him on purpose.  Make sure he knows you will stop this person<br/>
if he tells you who it is.   Give him examples of ways this person could<br/>
be stopped.  And don&#39;t make him do anything he&#39;s afraid to do until you<br/>
have it figured out.  You may unknowingly be forcing him into the same<br/>
frightening experience all over again.<br/>
 <br/>
Hold on to him and make him feel as safe as possible.  My little guy is<br/>
starting to feel better about things.  Reassurance is an ongoing process.<br/>
 If you talk with him a lot you might get it figured out.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe he had a dream he doesn&#39;t even clearly remember.<br/>
Maybe he just had a thought about what could happen.<br/>
<br/>
Kids get comfortable with their own understanding of the world and then when <br/>
it grows, sometimes they&#39;re afraid for a while until some time passes while<br/>
1) the fears don&#39;t materialize<br/>
2) the thoughts get older<br/>
3) the child rationalizes and processes the fears<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a dream so scary two nights ago that she doesn&#39;t want to tell it.  <br/>
That has never happened.  She was easily frustrated all day yesterday--partly <br/>
waking up badly and partly the thoughts of the dream.  All I knew was it <br/>
involved our back gate, a double metal gate big enough for a car to drive in <br/>
the yard, which opens onto a big vacant lot.  I had asked, at a distance from <br/>
our house, if the gate was open (it looked funny to me, from a couple of <br/>
blocks away where we were).   Holly said &quot;No, I locked it.   No, that was in <br/>
my dream.&quot; but it was locked.<br/>
<br/>
This morning she got up when I did, which is unusual.   I asked if her dream <br/>
was so scary se didn&#39;t want to talk about it.  She said kinda.  I asked if <br/>
there was anything we could do to make her feel safer.  She said keep the <br/>
gate locked.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could ask your son what you could do to make him feel safer.  It <br/>
might get him talking about what he&#39;s thinking (if he even knows).<br/>
<br/>
Can you let him sleep with you for a while, or near you, or can you sleep <br/>
with him?  Maybe music or a story tape going while he&#39;s alone would help.  <br/>
Maybe closing all the closet drawers and closing all things like shower <br/>
curtains would help.  (That&#39;s my personal safety routine.)<br/>
<br/>
He also might be a little sick and not recognizing the changed <br/>
perceptions--things might be tasting funny or sounding funny and making the <br/>
world seem creepy.<br/>

I think the best thing you can do is allow him to have those fears and help <br/>
him with extra time with him and letting him be where he is in the moment.<br/>

right around their 9th birthdays... all of the sudden they seem to feel<br/>
the largeness of the world in a different way, or something. It&#39;s very<br/>
different from the expansiveness and confidence that many 8 yr olds seem<br/>
to have. They all seem to just weather the storm, eventually. The Ames<br/>
and Ilg books are wonderful for some of this developmental stages stuff,<br/>
even though they&#39;re 50 years old and dated in a lot of ways... I was<br/>
skeptical of them for a long time but I kept reading the ones for Cacie&#39;s<br/>
age and they kept resonating with something...<br/>

I have had the same experience with my 8 year old, Jaryd...only it started<br/>
about a year ago.  See, he went to kindergarden in ps and I think that might<br/>
be the cause of it.  But then again...who knows.  I just go with the<br/>
flow...I don&#39;t force either him or my 5 yr old to do anything.  The local<br/>
church has been after me to send them on the church bus on Sunday mornings,<br/>
but they don&#39;t want to go even though my cousin goes to that church.  They<br/>
think it&#39;s silly, but I tell the church that it is up to my boys.  I feel<br/>
that I pushed him by making him go to school and now I regret it.  My<br/>
parents neither one understand.  They feel I should &quot;cut the strings&quot;<br/>
because he&#39;ll be 9 in May...but I don&#39;t agree.  Jaryd likes to sleep on the<br/>
couch if Ty, the 5 yr old doesn&#39;t want to sleep with him in his room, and I<br/>
let him.  The only rule is that as soon as he wakes up and watches his<br/>
cartoons covered up, his pillow and blanket have to be put back in his room.<br/>
Sorry for the long-windedness :) (if that&#39;s a word)  Don&#39;t worry<br/>
<br/>
