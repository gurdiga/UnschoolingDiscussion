<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240834658"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font COLOR="#800080" SIZE="3" FAMILY="SCRIPT" FACE="Fine Hand">In a few days I will be becoming a &quot;foster mom&quot; (not legally) &nbsp;to the 
<br>daughter of a friend. She has just had it with her daughter and is at the 
<br>point where she wants her to go live with her dad who Katey hasn&#39;t seen in 8 
<br>years. A few weeks ago Jesse was ranting on the phone about Katie and I said 
<br>&quot;Then send her here, INSTEAD&quot; and tonight she called me and asked me if the 
<br>offer still stood. I said that of course it did.........I love Katie like my 
<br>own and no way do I want to see her with a dad who beat her when she lived 
<br>w/him and who cares so little that he hasn&#39;t seen her since she was 4 years 
<br>old.
<br>
<br>Anyway.....I am sure you can all guess that I have NO experience with girls 
<br>as far as parenting goes. The point of her coming here (in her mother&#39;s eyes) 
<br>is to have rules and guidelines (and she will have the same responsibilities 
<br>and guidelines as the boys do), her mother can&#39;t get her to listen. (she is 
<br>not consistent) and if Katie gets grounded her mom never follows thru. 
<br>Well....I should say didn&#39;t. She has been trying to change things. Katie will 
<br>have chores here, she will get grounded, she will have to follow the same 
<br>rules as the boys when outside, etc.. Jessie will pay me $ for food for Katie 
<br>and personal items. And I will be homeschooling her. She will be here until 
<br>the 2nd or 3rd week of June. There&#39;s no set day for her to come here....the 
<br>next time she has a fit with her mom, her mom is packing her stuff the next 
<br>day while she is at school and is bringing her here. Katie KNOWS that this 
<br>(coming here) is an option. The MAIN reason I am doing this is because I feel 
<br>that Katie will have a better &quot;home life&quot; HERE (her mother is VERY 
<br>self-centered and it&#39;s all &quot;Jessie, Jessie, Jessie&quot;, she goes out and leaves 
<br>Katie in charge....Jessie stays out until the wee hours of the morning. In 
<br>this state, OH, or at least in this county, if a child has people nearby to 
<br>call in an emergency and if the parent deems them mature enough the age they 
<br>are left home alone does not matter--I called CPS when Katie was 10 and being 
<br>left in charge of her then 8yo sister and they told me that her age did not 
<br>matter if her mother deemed her responsible enough. BTW--Criss was 14 before 
<br>we started going out with &nbsp;him in charge. To me, almost 11 is NOT old 
<br>enough). Her mother gives her only negative attention and no affection (her 
<br>10yo sister is the princess and the one her mother favors. BTW--Ash is also 
<br>the &quot;cute one&quot; of the 2. Her 13yo son lives with his grandparents. All Jesse 
<br>wants is Ash around. And Katie knows this. Ash gets the clothes and toys she 
<br>wants, Ash gets all the hugs and kisses, Ash get everything and Katie and 
<br>Brandon are burdens to Jesse). A true foster home wouldn&#39;t be as good as her 
<br>being here. Jesse will pay for me to take her to counseling....she has been 
<br>thinking about it and I am going to make sure it happens and will take her to 
<br>see a counselor. I will make sure Katie gets the love and affection she 
<br>deserves. While she is here she will be my daughter.
<br>
<br> &nbsp;I know that she has already started her period.....how do you deal with a 
<br>pre-teenage girl to make sure she uses proper hygiene? She just turned 12 in 
<br>March. Can you give a 12yo girl Midol? What types of things do girls like to 
<br>do? Basically...what should I do with her that I do not with the boys because 
<br>of A) her situation and B) her gender???? I am clueless when it comes to 
<br>girls. Any and all help will be much appreciated.
<br>
<br>Also.....I want to school her like I do the boys, in an unschooled manner but 
<br>I know she will need some structure. Can anyone suggest books that are geared 
<br>to girls &nbsp;and ideas for teaching with them? Things that she and I can do 
<br>together and that the boys could jump in with if they so choose? Is there a 
<br>way to use the Dear America and American Girls series as a learning outlet? 
<br>
<br>Legally I believe I need to have Jesse sign papers giving me temporary 
<br>custody. Is this correct? I know that I have to be able to get her medical 
<br>care if something should happen to her.
<br>
<br>Besides paying for food and personal items should I factor anything else in 
<br>to what Jessie should pay me in support?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547639173">Oh, Tracy. You&#39;re taking on a lot here, aren&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter just turned 14. 12 wasn&#39;t easy. I&#39;m trying to put together a lot <br/>
of stuff in my head and come out with what would most help Katie feel like a <br/>
valuable, worthy, lovable person. Can you show her how much it means to you <br/>
to have another woman/girl in your family? Will she have her own space to <br/>
retreat to when she needs that? My daughter was so uncertain of herself at <br/>
this age, wanting to hang onto being a little girl, but getting the message <br/>
from society/culture/her own body that she was becoming a woman. Frightened, <br/>
but not wanting to show fear. She needed more stuffed animals and dolls at <br/>
this time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I know that she has already started her period.....how do you deal with a <br/>
 pre-teenage girl to make sure she uses proper hygiene? She just turned 12 in <br/>
 March. Can you give a 12yo girl Midol? What types of things do girls like to <br/>
 do? Basically...what should I do with her that I do not with the boys <br/>
because <br/>
 of A) her situation and B) her gender???? I am clueless when it comes to <br/>
 girls. Any and all help will be much appreciated. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Hmm. We let preconceived ideas about &quot;proper hygiene&quot; relax. Because my <br/>
daughter was so sensitive to anything that seemed like criticism at this age, <br/>
I would try more for having things available for her to use. For me being <br/>
available if she had questions. Instruction and advice were tricky because <br/>
she was so defensive. I would keep her feminine supplies, and plenty of clean <br/>
underwear, deodorant, etc., where she had access to more than she needed. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mention any extra laundry in the form of sheets or underwear. I&#39;d <br/>
just do the laundry and have clean things available. She had awful periods. <br/>
Migraines and vomiting for at least a day. Yes, we tried Midol, but Exedrine <br/>
Migraine helped my daughter more. Diet (more vegetables and grains, less <br/>
processed food and meat, lots more water) has helped this so much, but this <br/>
had to be her choice, not mine.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What type of things do girls like to do?&quot; Gosh, that really depends on the <br/>
person, doesn&#39;t it? I remember when I was this age, having an aunt that <br/>
seemed to be there just for me. She had a grown son, and called me &quot;her <br/>
girl&quot;. In her eyes, I was (or felt) perfect, loved, valued, interesting. Not <br/>
judged and found wanting. You have the chance to be that person for Katie, to <br/>
really make a difference in her life.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt; Also.....I want to school her like I do the boys, in an unschooled manner <br/>
but <br/>
 I know she will need some structure. Can anyone suggest books that are <br/>
geared <br/>
 to girls  and ideas for teaching with them? Things that she and I can do <br/>
 together and that the boys could jump in with if they so choose? Is there a <br/>
 way to use the Dear America and American Girls series as a learning outlet? <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was the age that we pulled my daughter out of school. She really needed <br/>
that &quot;deschooling&quot; time. How much &quot;schooling&quot; do you expect to get done with <br/>
Katie only living with you until mid-June? Can you talk to her to see what <br/>
her interests are? We rented a lot of videos around this time. It gave us a <br/>
chance to spend time together watching and then discussing the movies. Some <br/>
of them could be called &quot;educational&quot; by people looking for this kind of <br/>
learning, but some that lead to the best discussions would have looked like a <br/>
waste of time to some people.<br/>
<br/>
Tracy, if your post slips through the cracks and you don&#39;t get a reply from <br/>
Sandra or from Lisa, go knock on their doors. They will have valuable <br/>
information for you.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me if I can help or support/encourage you in any way.<br/>

<br>We have covered all of this. Katie is like a sister to them. They have been 
<br>around here for the last 2 years. While we don&#39;t have girls in the house they 
<br>have mostly female friends so they know that wrestling is out, that they 
<br>knock on bathroom doors (they do that anyway), they know that girls have 
<br>periods (they know all about PMS and such having me in the house), etc.. I am 
<br>not worried about curiosity setting in. Criss and Dru have both had 
<br>girlfriends and Criss has chosen a path of abstinence (from sex, looking at 
<br>adult materials, from cigs, from drugs and from alcohol) while Andru also 
<br>feels the same way about sex, drugs, alcohol and cigs but he has looked at

&lt;&lt;   I know that she has already started her period.....how do you deal with <br/>
a <br/>
pre-teenage girl to make sure she uses proper hygiene? She just turned 12 in <br/>
March. Can you give a 12yo girl Midol? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no special hygiene--showers or baths.  She doesn&#39;t need anything up <br/>
inside, unless she&#39;s using tampons.  But douche and like that?  No.  It&#39;s not <br/>
good.    <br/>
<br/>
Midol doesn&#39;t hurt, but if she&#39;s home instead of at school, why medicate?  <br/>
Just let her lie around if she&#39;s cramping or uncomfortable.  For leg aches, <br/>
whatever kind of pain killer (aspirin, tylenol, aleve, whatever) is fine if <br/>
she needs it.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also.....I want to school her like I do the boys, in an unschooled manner <br/>
but <br/>
I know she will need some structure.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She might not need some structure.  She might just need the talkative company <br/>
of an adult woman.  Maybe just let her hang out with you and be with you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is there a <br/>
way to use the Dear America and American Girls series as a learning outlet? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but &quot;using&quot; anything as a learning outlet isn&#39;t unschooling, and unless <br/>
she just happens to love dolls (they&#39;re really expensive too), I wouldn&#39;t go <br/>
there with a girl that age.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Legally I believe I need to have Jesse sign papers giving me temporary <br/>
custody. Is this correct? I know that I have to be able to get her medical <br/>
care if something should happen to her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s the dad?  She can&#39;t sign over anything if there&#39;s another parent with <br/>
custody.  But to allow medical treatment, that&#39;s a lesser form of custody.  <br/>
She just adds you as a &quot;parent&quot; who can approve medical procedures.  (That&#39;s <br/>
probably different state to state.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About money, it depends on too many things for me to guess.  <br/>
<br/>
My parents raised cousins, and there were hardships for me and my sister <br/>
about it.  Maybe the financial benefit (if any, if she&#39;s flush and can afford <br/>
it) should cover some luxuries for all the kids.  Enough to take them all to <br/>
a movie and lunch every week or two, or some such.  That way Katie is a <br/>
benefit to the others in a tangible kid-way, instead of just crowding them, <br/>
taking your attention, changing the routine, disturbing the peace.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been one of the crowded and disturbed, so I know.<br/>

&gt;We have covered all of this. Tracy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great Tracy.  It looks to me like you have all<br/>
the major bases covered.  I think your best bet is to<br/>
rely on your own experience as a former 12 year old<br/>
girl and learn as you go from Katie, since she is<br/>
unique.  <br/>
<br/>
I am so happy to hear that Katie has a place to turn<br/>
for help and would not have to go into the foster care<br/>
system.  How wonderful if every child in a poor home<br/>
situation had a caring adult family friend or relative<br/>
to turn to for assistance.  I wish I had been so<br/>
fortunate.<br/>
<br/>
As to the foster care system, I think foster parents<br/>
are usually wonderful, but the system itself is<br/>
terrible, and there are those few foster parents who<br/>
are....less than wonderful.  Add to that the fact that<br/>
at age 18 the children become &quot;aged out&quot; of the<br/>
system, even if they are still in public school, and<br/>
are not allowed any further assistance.  Some of them<br/>
end up on the street, and it is a terrible problem.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189758502">My best advise would be to have your sons also talk to her when you are not<br/>
around. Let them tell her what its like, what is expected in the household from<br/>
them and the good/bad experiences they&#39;ve had. Watch for all signs of closure. I<br/>
never had any older siblings growing up, so I became very promiscuous (not sure<br/>
on the spelling) early on. My mom never saw this coming, but I can tell from my<br/>
own doings, what to watch out for in my girls as they grow up. She will not be<br/>
in your house very long, so absolutely no real changes may take effect except<br/>
that she may really learn to love a close nit family as such as your sounds. I<br/>
wish you luck<br/>

situation when I was the same age.  If she&#39;s like me, she&#39;ll be<br/>
really clingy for a while.  She probably needs reassurance that she&#39;s<br/>
not a bad person, and all that.  You probably already know this, and<br/>
I really don&#39;t know her situation very well.  She&#39;ll grow out of it,<br/>
though, if she&#39;s allowed to.  Too bad you only get her for such a<br/>
short time.  Then what will she do?<br/>
