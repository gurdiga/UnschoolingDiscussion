<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803337182">&quot;Tag der deutschen Einheit&quot; as they call it in Germany.  Nineteen years ago<br/>
when I went abroad to live in Germany, I would have never thought I would<br/>
witness reunification in my lifetime.  I daresay many of the Germans I met<br/>
felt the same way.  What an amazing sequence of events unfolded before our<br/>
very eyes; a testament to the fact that regimes can fall; that average<br/>
people can make a huge difference.<br/>
<br/>
As we wrap up the 20th century, we can look back at the fall of the Berlin<br/>
Wall in 1989, Perestroika in the former Soviet Union, and the reunification<br/>
of Germany as among the most significant events in our lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
On another note:<br/>
<br/>
My picks for the three most important years of the 20th century are 1918,<br/>
1945, and 1989.<br/>
<br/>
1.  1918     WWI ends, and the excessively punitive Versailles Treaty sows<br/>
the seeds of WWII.<br/>
<br/>
2.  1945     WWII ends, beginning of the Atomic Age, the carving up of<br/>
Germany, and other events which led to the establishment of the &quot;Iron<br/>
Curtain, the Cold War, and the communist takeover of China.<br/>
<br/>
3.  1989     fall of the Berlin Wall, end of the Cold War.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are your picks for the three most important years of the 20th century?<br/>
