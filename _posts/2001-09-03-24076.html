<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180486338">Lynda, <br/>
I&#39;ve had a chance to look into some of the sign language videos you told<br/>
me about and they seem very promising.  I really appreciate  that you<br/>
took the time to help me out. <br/>
(Tami too! I love your idea about tagging things around the house! )<br/>
You made me homesick for the coast.  I used to live in Oregon, not on the<br/>
beach but close enough to hitchhike ( I was young and foolish, not<br/>
recommending hitchhiking to anyone ) there after work and on weekends. <br/>
Must plan a vacation!<br/>
Thanks again, <br/>
Deb L</div>

free things to do between here and Portland!  With kidlets, my most favorite<br/>
things have become the free ones &lt;g&gt;<br/>
