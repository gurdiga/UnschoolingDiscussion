<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045032830">Queens in particular. Or not too far out on Long Island.<br/>
We just moved back to town and we would like to get together for some <br/>
unschooling activities.<br/>
<br/>
We are also working with an action group on Long Island and developing a <br/>
Homeschooling Resource Center and/or democratic unschool. If anyone is <br/>
interested please email me privately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Kolleen</div>
