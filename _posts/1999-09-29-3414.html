<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121921422">it is hard for me to plan a party the way i&#39;d like and with several children <br/>
i knew i could not do it each year (even if i wanted to.)  thats how the <br/>
every 5 yr idea grew.  growing up we actually got just an eleven year old <br/>
&quot;friend&quot; party.   so, yes you remember it!!!  <br/>
<br/>
at five years old is the first, and we have done the theme, etc.  then, they <br/>
&quot;plan&quot; their next party for five more years, ha!!  actually they fantasize <br/>
about it, which is fun.  this saturday is my oldest&#39;s 10 yr old birthday <br/>
party that she has been waiting for for five years!  that sounds silly and it <br/>
really isnt so.  but it has been fun AND it is a great learning project.  you <br/>
get one motivated child when they are planning their own party and she has <br/>
had to do a lot.... working and planning hard-- learning a lot!<br/>
<br/>
okay-- the christmas thing.  just a funny comment/story.  i like to eat and <br/>
breakfast is important to me and feeding the fam is crucial or low blood <br/>
sugar strikes and people get cranky.  yet, nobody wanted to inturrupt the <br/>
christmas morning excitement for food!  so a few years back, i had the bright <br/>
idea of putting breakfast in the stocking.  i froze juice boxes (earlier) and <br/>
put them in, along with fruit bars, fruit, pop tart and some sort of jerky or <br/>
similar.  i of course thought it was brilliant and clever, but i remember a <br/>
lukewarm response-- ha!  i guess i should have seen that no- one else but the <br/>
mother carries the burden of planning meals....  since then we have chosen <br/>
one of those make ahead breakfast casseroles-- one was even a make ahead <br/>
frenchtoast recipe-- and stop to take a break for eating after stockings, <br/>
before presents.  <br/>
<br/>
we too have learned to do what we need to as far as giving to others in our <br/>
family and just hope it is received for what it is: a gift.  we did bring <br/>
back sand from the beach this year and probably each cousin gift will be a <br/>
little bottle with sand, was thinking of adding a little glitter and things, <br/>
too.<br/>
