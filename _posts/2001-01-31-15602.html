&lt;&lt; There ARE official points of view.  How many different pro-life <br/>
organizations <br/>
 are there?  Knights of Columbus (who go STRICTLY by Papal edict) and... any <br/>
 other literature-producing organization? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My point was that there is no *one* official point of view covering all <br/>
prolifers. Equally, the NAACP and the Black Muslims may have official points <br/>
of view and/or policies on affirmative action, but that doesn&#39;t mean they <br/>
speak for all African-Americans. So Operation Rescue or Knights of Columbus <br/>
can have whatever official policy on ectopic pregnancies they want. That <br/>
doesn&#39;t make it &quot;the official pro-life&quot; policy. I&#39;m sure amongst different <br/>
organizations you&#39;ll find lots of different policies, just as you will among <br/>
individuals. <br/>
