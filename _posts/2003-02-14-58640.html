<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075796484"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;If we let our kids have unlimited access to &quot;junk&quot; tv, etc, don&#39;t your <br/>
&gt;&gt;think they will take advantage of it in the same way they will take <br/>
&gt;&gt;advantage of &quot;junk&quot; food, if we stocked our pantry full of an unlimited <br/>
&gt;&gt;supply.  Isn&#39;t it our responsibility to offer a healthy assortment of food <br/>
&gt;&gt;from which to choose, including some not-so-healthy treats, to enjoy on <br/>
&gt;&gt;occasion, and in the same way, isn&#39;t it our responsibility to provide a <br/>
&gt;&gt;healthy assortment of entertainment options.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids have unlimited access to TV and food. This means they can choose <br/>
from what&#39;s available at the moment, and also that I&#39;ll try to keep their <br/>
favorites on hand. This doesn&#39;t mean that they spend 24/7 eating Ho-Ho&#39;s in <br/>
front of Sponge Bob though. They have complete access and therefore have the <br/>
choice to take it or leave it. And quite over they do leave it for other <br/>
activities and different food choices.<br/>
<br/>
I keep the pantry and fridge stocked with a wide variety of breads, meats <br/>
(sorry you veg-heads ;-)), fruits, veggies, treats, drinks etc. We own 2 <br/>
TV&#39;s and have a DISH system that shows an amazingly wide array of <br/>
programming from Shakespeare and opera to CatDog and Looney Toons. I believe <br/>
they all have merit if chosen freely by my kids. I even wrote something <br/>
recently about my dd Casey, then 8, and her comment about cartoon physics. <br/>
The kids kids are always thinking.<br/>
<br/>
My personal experience has been that limiting something makes it very <br/>
special and desired. My kids have unlimited access and it&#39;s no big deal. <br/>
There&#39;s no sneaking or bingeing and they don&#39;t take advantage. They make <br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it probably means that you also have to limit yourself to the use <br/>
of the TV, computer even the freaking toilet because you live in a very <br/>
small apartment and everybody has to take turns. When I read about <br/>
these issue I can just envision you all in a space that, even in the <br/>
smallest of houses, is probably 3 times the size of living space we <br/>
have  --and I don&#39;t even want to think of other peoples spaces here in <br/>
NYC who think ours is big!  Size does matter ...<br/>
<br/>
These past two weeks brought this space issue really well. My father <br/>
died and I literally had to leave the apartment so that I could cry in <br/>
peace. It&#39;s not that my kids did not see me cry but that, there is a <br/>
certain place I go when I grieve where I just have to be left alone <br/>
--being around other people actually does not calm me at all. Now I <br/>
understand the concept of cathedrals --they have nooks and crannies in <br/>
which you can just sit, even hide, cry a little, calm down and even <br/>
meditate in lieu of praying.<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking a lot about spaces and their purposes. Places like <br/>
bedrooms, kitchens, hospitals, morgues, funeral homes, cemeteries, <br/>
birthing rooms, restaurants and fast food joints. I am not an expert in <br/>
Feng Shui but I get the overall premise --that your environment affects <br/>
how you behave.<br/>
<br/>
What I get from a lot of these posts (which seem to come in cycles) is <br/>
that these issues of limiting or not limiting activity do not have so <br/>
much with the activity itself but the kind of energy it generates and <br/>
how that affects the living environment. When I took my computer out of <br/>
my bedroom, not only I could sleep better but I started to write more. <br/>
The energy in the room felt better. We put my old computer in the kids <br/>
bedroom and now they rarely use it (we have to rearrange the old dining <br/>
room area once again to make space for it).<br/>
<br/>
That said, even if we moved to a house (which wont be happening anytime <br/>
soon) I think I would still keep the overall arrangement we have here: <br/>
A room full of gadgetry (computers and TV included), a play room and <br/>
then the rest. I feel that each room or section of the living space <br/>
should be assigned to certain activities so that you can have high and <br/>
low energy spaces to go to. And make it a point to take a few moments <br/>
during the day to stop, breathe, do a little relaxation and if possible <br/>
meditation. Even if it happens once a week. My kids take breaks when <br/>
they see me take a break. When I stretch and do a little of yoga in <br/>
front of them (can&#39;t do a whole routine around my little one for fear <br/>
of him inuring me!) they want to stretch and relax. The point is that, <br/>
if I do it, they do as well.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the issue of emotional spaces.<br/>
<br/>
My father was a man of extremes who, unfortunately, gave in to the ones <br/>
that shortened his life. He knew how to exercise, eat well and relax <br/>
(he had been an Olympic athlete) and he was a man of many skills that <br/>
could have kept himself busy after retiring. His depression exacerbated <br/>
personality traits that made it difficult for anybody to help him. The <br/>
bottom line is that, as a man who had lived a full life he made his <br/>
choices. We as parents can only hope to create an environment in which <br/>
our kids get the best of what they need to reach old age. For all my <br/>
father&#39;s shortcomings, I learned a lot about the mind and body <br/>
connection from him. He taught my brother and I a lot about how he as <br/>
an athlete &#39;read&#39; his body and how he learned how to translate athletic <br/>
endurance into other aspects of life. That&#39;s why seeing crippled by <br/>
aneurisms and dementia was more painful than the knowledge that his <br/>
spirit is free.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lot of battles with him because I felt that with some of his <br/>
actions he was walking away from a  home built with love and trust not <br/>
only for but with my mother, my brother and I. It took me years to <br/>
understand that as he aged and made one choice after another, a lot of <br/>
it was influenced by his dramatically deteriorating mental health. It <br/>
took some heavy dose of medical inquiry, personal growth and compassion <br/>
from my part to understand all of that. I just wished I had a better <br/>
understanding of all of this 7 years ago. Unfortunately, not even his <br/>
doctors understood what was going on. My a-ha! moment came after <br/>
reading AGING WITH GRACE, which came out in 2000.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have kids and think of motherhood as a creative process and <br/>
not just a survival instinct, I cannot help but believe that my kids <br/>
will too have their battles with me one day. What I hope to have that <br/>
is different from my parents is a personal, emotional and spiritual <br/>
place that my children and I can recognize as a common ground for love. <br/>
That, regardless of our physical, emotional or psychological state, <br/>
there is a place where we can all meet and bask in the glow.<br/>
<br/>
TV, treats (we have no junk food at home, just treats), computers, <br/>
games, they are all really inconsequential. The question is, what are <br/>
we all doing now to blaze a path of love with our parenting? How are we <br/>
living the future now?<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<br/>
I agree with you on the space issue.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else posted here that when they moved to a larger space, that things were better.  I think that thread was about siblings and fighting, can&#39;t remember.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we have a relatively small home.  We&#39;re in the process of renovating the garage to make a 4th bedroom so that each of us has a place to go.<br/>
<br/>
I know my husband needs lots of space, so he is either outside (in the summer) or he is in the basement (in the winter) working on things or relaxing in front of the tv. <br/>
<br/>
I tend to use the bathroom (in the tub) for my space.<br/>
