and he ends up talking a lot about the plots. So sometimes my kids hear<br/>
about something the first time because things are switched around in the<br/>
book in an interesting way. In the latest one, Shakespeare has to write<br/>
plays both for the ruling Spanish crown (who rules Britain also) and for the<br/>
British rebels.<br/>
<br/>
Fascinating! One of these days, I&#39;ll read one too &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
