<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914827042">Well, I am a christian and I love Harry Potter. For years I avoided it<br/>
because of the controversy (I know, Shame on me). I finally read it on the<br/>
advice of a dear friend. It is pure fantasy, wonderful, fun fantasy. I grew<br/>
up reading and loving the Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe series, written by<br/>
a christian and pure fantasy. I don&#39;t see much difference. It even has the<br/>
classic good versus evil theme. I have talked with my kids about the<br/>
difference between reality and fantasy, for instance, what it would mean in<br/>
real life if someone claimed to be a witch. The fantasy and reality versions<br/>
would bare little resemblance to each other.  I use everything to teach my<br/>
children discernment and judgment, not just those things I (0r another) deem<br/>
as &quot;worthy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Harry Potter anyone excited about the movie?? We are! I read an<br/>
interview from the author, JK Rowling, and she was adament about it staying<br/>
close to the book. I think it will be good! :)<br/>

school... hmmmm....</div>

I can only guess it&#39;s because it contains a few curse words....maybe &#39;they&#39;<br/>
(those who banned it or challenged it)  though it might inspire children to<br/>
perform horrendous Halloween vandalism....like putting rotten eggs in a<br/>
grumpy guy&#39;s mailbox-?-  guess if you get caught in that you miss the<br/>
overall theme about how it feels to be on the receiving end of teasing and<br/>
ridicule....and how it happens to &#39;normal&#39; children.<br/>
   Or perhaps because it makes schools seem SO ridiculous and promotes<br/>
unschooling....?....<br/>
