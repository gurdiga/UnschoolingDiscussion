<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197743927">Calling all unschoolers in the San Francisco Bay Area<br/>
and beyond!  The SF Bay Unschooling Network (SFBUN)<br/>
recently held its first gathering.  Unschoolers, those<br/>
interested in unschooling, and those who like to hang<br/>
out with unschoolers are invited to join us.  We&#39;ve<br/>
just launched a new Yahoo group to share ideas and<br/>
plan future gatherings and events.  To subscribe to<br/>
SFBUN&#39;s Yahoo group, please go to:<br/>
