<div id="ygrps-yiv-658172868">Speaking of gardening......<br/>
My mom (& dad) have both been very impressed by the kids as they &quot;unschool&quot;. However, mom was under the theory she was too old to learn anything &quot;new&quot;..LOL.<br/>
I ordered the book Lasagna Gardening...and to be honest I have not seen it but for about 5 minutes since its arrival two weeks ago. She already has a compost bin full (thanks to her reading to dad all the wonderful ways compost is made, he found some wire and had her a bin made within a day) ...a 5 gallon bucket of coffee grounds, has recruited the paper guy into giving her left-overpapers, and dad even went and collected some prime cow poopy from the fields....Of course the kidlets have been by their side, guiding thier grandparents through their new found &quot;unschooling&quot;,even picking out Rodale&#39;s Organic Gardening for Grandma at the library...Mom told me I had better just order her a book too.....there was no way she could part with it....a classic case of contagious unschooling if I&#39;ve ever seen one! &lt;BG&gt; Aleasa</div>
