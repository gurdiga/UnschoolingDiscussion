  For me it&#39;s not the place so much as the people.  Once you plant us, we <br/>
take root.  My mother, two sisters, two brothers, son, daughter, grandson.  <br/>
If we packed up our youngest and moved, I&#39;d wither away without my family.   <br/>
So we stay here in PA, crappy laws and all.  Of course my son is only six, <br/>
and we don&#39;t have to report him until he&#39;s eight.  I REALLY hope we have a <br/>
new, less restrictive law in place by then.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree and with me it&#39;s not just my family but our homeschool support<br/>
group. We have great laws here in MO but if they changed we would move<br/>
to KS and still be able to stay with our homeschooling community. We<br/>
hope to never move but that&#39;s the plan if we ever have to. :-) Jane <br/>
