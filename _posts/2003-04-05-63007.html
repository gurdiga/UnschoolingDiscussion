<div id="ygrps-yiv-792342846">Saw this on another list and had to share...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;.........I was due later in the week for an appointment with the<br/>
gynaecologist.  Early one morning, I received a call from the doctor&#39;s<br/>
office to tell me that I had been rescheduled for earlier that morning  at<br/>
9:30am..<br/>
<br/>
 I had only just packed everyone off to work and school and it was already<br/>
around 8:45 am. The trip to his office took about 35 minutes,  so I didn&#39;t<br/>
have any time to spare.<br/>
<br/>
 As most women do, I like to take a little extra effort over hygiene when<br/>
making such visits, but this time I wasn&#39;t going to be able to  make the<br/>
full effort. So, I rushed upstairs, threw off my pyjamas, wet  the washcloth<br/>
that was sitting next to the sink, and gave myself a quick wash in &quot;that<br/>
area&quot; to make sure I was at least presentable. I  threw the washcloth in the<br/>
clothes basket, donned some clothes, hopped  in the car and raced to my<br/>
appointment.<br/>
<br/>
 I was in the waiting room for only a few minutes when I was called in.<br/>
<br/>
 Knowing the procedure, as I&#39;m sure you do, I hopped up on the table, looked<br/>
over at the other side of the room and pretended that I was in Paris or some<br/>
other place a million miles away. I was a little surprised when the doctor<br/>
said, &quot;My, we have made an extra effort this morning haven&#39;t<br/>
we?&quot;..............I didn&#39;t respond.<br/>
<br/>
 After the appointment, I heaved a sigh of relief and went home. The rest of<br/>
the day was normal....some shopping, cleaning, cooking, etc.  After school<br/>
when my six year old daughter was playing, she called out from the bathroom,<br/>
&quot;Mommy, where&#39;s my washcloth?&quot; I told her to get another one from the<br/>
cupboard. She replied, &quot;No, I need the one that  was here by the sink, it<br/>
had all my glitter and sparkles in it.&quot;............<br/>
