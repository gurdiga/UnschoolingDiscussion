<br/>
<br/>
Paul Harvey read this on his radio show.<br/>
<br/>
For the life of me, I can&#39;t understand what could have gone wrong in<br/>
Littleton, Colo. If only the parents had kept their children away from the<br/>
guns, we wouldn&#39;t have had such a tragedy. Yeah, it must have been the guns.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because of half our children being raised in broken<br/>
homes.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because our children get to spend an average of 30<br/>
seconds in meaningful conversation with their parents each day. After all,<br/>
we<br/>
give our children quality time.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because we treat our children as pets and our pets as<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because we place our children in day care centers<br/>
where<br/>
they learn their socialization skills among their peers under the law of the<br/>
jungle while employees who have no vested interest in the children look on<br/>
and<br/>
make sure that no blood is spilled.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because we allow our children to watch, on average,<br/>
seven hours of television a day filled with the glorification of sex and<br/>
violence that isn&#39;t fit for adult consumption.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because we allow (or even encourage) our children to<br/>
enter into virtual worlds in which, to win the game, one must kill as many<br/>
opponents as possible in the most sadistic way possible.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because we have sterilized and contracepted our<br/>
families<br/>
down to sizes so small that the children we do have are so spoiled with<br/>
material things that they come to equate the receiving of the material with<br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because our children, who historically have been seen<br/>
as<br/>
a blessing from God, are now being viewed as either a mistake created when<br/>
contraception fails or inconveniences that parents try to raise in their<br/>
spare<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because we give two-year prison sentences to<br/>
teen-agers<br/>
who kill their newborns.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because our school systems teach the children that<br/>
they<br/>
are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial<br/>
soup of mud . . . .<br/>
<br/>
It couldn&#39;t have been because we teach our children that there are no laws<br/>
of<br/>
morality that transcend us, that everything is relative and that actions<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
have consequences. What the heck, the president gets away with it.<br/>
<br/>
Nah, it must have been the guns.<br/>
