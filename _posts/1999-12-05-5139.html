<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ironically, your children could likely be more skilled &quot;learning people&quot;<br/>
than their cousins.  Unfortunately, all too often our society (at least on<br/>
the surface) doesn&#39;t value or reward real learning.  We worship things like<br/>
credentials, high test scores, and short-term memory.  Real learning is not<br/>
so popular because we can&#39;t easily measure it or quantify it or translate it<br/>
into a high-paying career--our culture&#39;s ultimate success symbol.<br/>
<br/>
No, detecting real learning is not so simple.  Nevertheless, when it has<br/>
happened, it gradually reveals itself in many intangible ways such as the<br/>
quality and breadth of mind, the depth of relationships, and the intensity<br/>
of passion to know.<br/>
<br/>
Such topics don&#39;t easily fit into the type of superficial discussion you<br/>
mentioned above.<br/>

    Thanks John, you are so right. My Dh who did not do well in school is <br/>
amazing. He is now in charge of the 45yro family painting business and he has <br/>
an older brother. He can do ANYTHING with his hands. He just finished <br/>
installing new windows on our house. He will be completely remodeling our <br/>
kitchen over the holiday.<br/>
He has dug and put in sewer lines for the shop he and his dad and brothers <br/>
built for their business. All of their clients love his (and his family), <br/>
they do not advertise, word of mouth has them overbooked year round. This is <br/>
because they are quality craftsmen who know their business and always take <br/>
care of the customer. I can see I&#39;ve gotten a little off topic here. What I <br/>
wanted to say though is that I know very few people who can do the things my <br/>
husband, his father and brothers can do. his kind of smart is not available <br/>
in school to my knowledge. Like I said though you would not believe the <br/>
things my DH can do. The list is endless.<br/>

very, very brave.  ;-)<br/>

    This is the only way he has time. Did I mention he also works very fast? <br/>
He amazes me. He does not waste time. he breaks for lunch to eat and have <br/>
coffee, that&#39;s it, no chit chat. They all work like that every day. H put 4 <br/>
single and 2 double windows in our house alone in one day. I have seen other <br/>
companies like theirs work and they are not the same.<br/>
