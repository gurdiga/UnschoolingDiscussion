This reminded me of a conversation i had with a mom who told <br/>
me &quot;I&#39;m not prejudiced or anything, I just don&#39;t want my children <br/>
making friends with other races because we don&#39;t believe in <br/>
inter-marriage.&quot; I had never heard anyone say this outloud before <br/>
and I was stunned into silence.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I was 15-16, my mother asked which boy in my class I liked. She was <br/>
terribly worried that I might be a lesbian because I wasn&#39;t &quot;boy-crazy&quot;. I said, <br/>
&quot;Michael Perry&quot;. Michael&#39;s black. I got a thirty minute lecture on inter-racial <br/>
marriages.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize the question was REALLY, &quot;Which boy do you plan to marry&quot;. I <br/>
thought it was who was nice and kind and who made me smile and laugh. And I <br/>
was NEVER boy crazy---I was too into horses and dogs. (and yes, Sandra, I know <br/>
it&#39;s illegal in *some* states, but we&#39;re talking SC! &lt;BWG&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So here I was---a potential lesbian who might marry a black boy. <br/>
Maybe I&#39;ve just always liked to mess with my mother&#39;s head.  &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004741900">When I was younger I was a tomboy (that&#39;s what they called it then). Played <br/>
football, climbed trees, played with cars and so one. When I joined the <br/>
military I was given a position as a mechanic due to the test scores. As a child I <br/>
would watch my dad work on our cars and would hand him wrenches etc.<br/>
<br/>
One day I called him to tell him I was pregnant and the phone was silent. He <br/>
says &quot; Kiddo&quot;? &quot;Laura&quot; I said yes dad. He said not in the same words that he <br/>
thought I was a lesbian all those years.  He sounded soo relieved but I <br/>
wondered why he never said anything to me about it sooner. Makes me wonder what <br/>
everyone else thought? Come to think of it my Foster father thought I was also. I <br/>
was just a late bloomer and was interested in other more important things.<br/>
