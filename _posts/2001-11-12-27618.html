<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583409007">Now, suppose you daughter decides to eat nothing <br/>
but celery.  All celery<br/>
ever day.  Absolutely nothing else.  She has lost <br/>
loads of weight and is<br/>
unhealthy.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra responded: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Has anyone ever actually done that?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of young girls every year do that, perhaps<br/>
not celery, but often choose one particular &quot;diet&quot;<br/>
food. Some even quit eating altogether. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is a straw man at all. I think it<br/>
is a great analogy.<br/>

make all the decisions about her life, but a lot of people here are moving <br/>
into unschooling from other paths.  I&#39;d think anorexia would certainly be a <br/>
possibility for a few kids in that case.<br/>
