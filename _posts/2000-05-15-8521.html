<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396570561">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just picked up the following news story about bullying in Japan that I <br/>
thought might of some interest.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most suprising thing about this article for parents in Japan <br/>
-- myself included! -- is that Japan reportedly comes in last place in <br/>
bullying among the countries surveyed. (But then again, whenever Japan&#39;s <br/>
Ministry of Education is involved in research, the results are best <br/>
viewed with some suspicion.)  <br/>
<br/>
Regardless, bullying in Japan remains an *extremely* serious problem for <br/>
schoolkids in Japan, and it&#39;s one of the reasons why Japanese families <br/>
are turning away from school in increasing numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, there are at least two viable choices in Japan: homelearning <br/>
and alternative education.<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of Japanese families are not aware of these choices, <br/>
and the Education Ministry, of course, is in no hurry to inform them. But <br/>
the choices are out there, and where Japanese families are aware of these <br/>
choices, we see more and more families in Japan embracing homelearning <br/>
and alternative education. A positive sign, indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Here, then, is the story....   <br/>

PANEL ON BULLYING ISSUES SURVEY RESULTS, MANUAL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An international research group on bullying recently compiled a report, <br/>
including a bullying prevention manual, for the Education Ministry, The <br/>
Yomiuri Shimbun learned Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
The report is based on survey results from four countries, including <br/>
Japan and Britain.<br/>
<br/>
The report was compiled by a group of university professors from Japan <br/>
and other countries, in addition to officials from the National Institute <br/>
of Educational Research and the National Research Institute of Police <br/>
Science.<br/>
<br/>
With research funds from the Education Ministry, the group surveyed a <br/>
total of 16,000 public school students, teachers and parents around the <br/>
nation in January 1997. A total of 7,000 students ranging from <br/>
fifth-grade primary school level to third-grade middle school pupils were <br/>
surveyed. At almost the same time, students in the same age bracket in <br/>
Britain, Holland and Norway were similarly surveyed.<br/>
<br/>
The results showed that although many children from all four countries <br/>
reported experiencing bullying, their teachers and parents were much less <br/>
aware of the bullying than the bullied children&#39;s peers.<br/>
<br/>
Only 13.9 percent of Japanese students polled had experienced bullying, <br/>
the lowest percentage among the four countries. The survey found that <br/>
39.4 percent of children in Britain and 27 percent in Holland had <br/>
experienced bullying.<br/>
<br/>
However, Japan had the highest percentage of students bullied more than <br/>
once a week, or for a period longer than one academic term. The survey <br/>
also showed that more than 30 percent of the students felt they could not <br/>
report bullying to their teachers or parents because they feared the <br/>
bullies would retaliate.<br/>
<br/>
The report figures suggest a tendency in Japan for the same victim to be <br/>
repeatedly bullied over an extended period. It showed that Japanese <br/>
students, as they grow older, have an increasing tendency to ignore <br/>
incidents of bullying, the report said.<br/>
<br/>
The apathy of onlookers makes the problem of bullying worse, according to <br/>
the report.<br/>
<br/>
It is necessary to involve everyone in tackling the problem of bullying, <br/>
the report said.<br/>
<br/>
The report mentions Australia&#39;s &quot;family group conferencing&quot; as an example <br/>
of a positive approach toward solving bullying issues. The technique <br/>
involves bringing together not only a bully and a victim but also their <br/>
families, a school counselor, local residents and the police.<br/>
<br/>
The report also listed three countermeasures to help bullied children:<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, a teacher or counselor should privately consult with students <br/>
they suspect are being victimized. Slight trembling or irregular eye <br/>
movements may indicate that the student is being bullied, the report said.<br/>
<br/>
During the counseling session, the teacher or counselor has to clearly <br/>
show that they are in a position to protect the victim, the report <br/>
stressed.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, conventional countermeasures by teachers and adults need to be <br/>
reviewed and a new system to help children support each other to <br/>
eradicate bullying must be set up.<br/>
<br/>
As examples, the report proposes the introduction of a program to develop <br/>
the students&#39; abilities to make friends with others, and a <br/>
teacher-supported buddy system between junior and senior students to stop <br/>
bullying.<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, Japanese school principals need to take a more active role. <br/>
School principals in Europe and the United States usually remember the <br/>
names and faces of their students, while principals and vice principals <br/>
in Japan tend to maintain distance between themselves and their students, <br/>
the report observed. The principals should have more contact with the <br/>
children and exercise stronger leadership, the report said.<br/>
