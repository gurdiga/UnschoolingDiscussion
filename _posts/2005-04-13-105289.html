&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m glad this place is here, because this morning, if there were no <br/>
&gt;place to<br/>
&gt;rant and rave, I&#39;d be hauling the kids out of bed (despite their 1 am or<br/>
&gt;later bedtime) and cracking the whip.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m glad you let it out here, rather than on your kids.  I hope that helped <br/>
&gt;you to let it go.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helped SO MUCH. Matter of fact, reminiscing about this 10 year old o&#39;mine <br/>
at age 2 and 3, when she wanted a &quot;lullabye&quot; each night...How Much Is That <br/>
Doggy in the Window? LOL and she also liked other strange songs, like I <br/>
Wanna Hold Your Hand. She&#39;s been a Beatles freak from early on. Well, <br/>
thinking about that stuff helps, too.<br/>
<br/>
When I talk to her about this, I plan on opening up with such reminiscences, <br/>
so she knows I adore her and am on her side, not just all irritated with <br/>
things. And reasserting my efforts to pitch in right along with her, when <br/>
things do need cleaning up.<br/>
<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidiC<br/>
