My boys like the more violent computer games at times.  They like the Duke <br/>
Nukem and Doom CD ROMs.  And the same way... they play for a while and loose <br/>
interest and go back to Age of Mythology, Zoo Tycoon and Civilization.  I <br/>
just think it is a great forum when you can talk about that and not have <br/>
people think you are such an unfit parent for letting your child see such a <br/>
&quot;horrible&quot; thing.  <br/>
