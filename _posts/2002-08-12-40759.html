<br/>
Mary, &quot;life is good,&quot; but it can be a whole lot better. We could be free.<br/>
Imagine that.<br/>
<br/>
For all the years that my last son was educating himself in his own way at<br/>
home or wherever Luz and I went, I kept thinking what it would have been<br/>
like if we lived someplace where we were not permitted that freedom.  It<br/>
often made me cry.<br/>
<br/>
And I am still brought to tears, listening to the people who call us up and<br/>
tell us their stories of how the schools insulted and abused their children<br/>
and intimidated them, the parents, for years until they found a phone number<br/>
and called, only half-believing - after all the lies they had been told by<br/>
the schools - that they were free to take their children out of those holes<br/>
and away from those robots and give then a happy existence if it was still<br/>
possible, worrying that the damage was (is) too severe to mend.<br/>
<br/>
I have two other children, boy and girl twins, now 32, who, before I knew<br/>
about homeschooling, went to those places, and they were noticeably crippled<br/>
by it...still have aversions to the printed word, still have nightmares (the<br/>
girl) about not being allowed to go to the bathroom and having no choice but<br/>
to pee in her seat, and then being forced to sit in it the rest of the day.<br/>
We hear such tales often about how the schools are equal parts prison,<br/>
factory and insane asylum.<br/>
<br/>
 In the last month here, I&#39;ve read about six hours about religions, about<br/>
three hours about Phonics games, at least two hours about Hell,etc. It might<br/>
be a worthwhile exercise to count the ways in which posts have been<br/>
irrelevant to unschooling since I&#39;ve joined. I&#39;ve not heard a word of<br/>
discontent about them. But mention something about how unschooling is<br/>
subject to stupid laws and ignorant politicians and judges who want to make<br/>
it illegal, and WHAP, the fertilizer hits the vent, collectivist<br/>
sensitivities are ruffled, the defenders of the status quo come out snarling<br/>
and demanding silence, go away, yadayada.  Where is the moderator when we<br/>
need one?!<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s get down. Connect the dots. This list is probably the vanguard of<br/>
homeschooling, the storm troops, the elite corps of homeschooling, the first<br/>
team (sorry about all the guy analogies) Unschoolers are the people who have<br/>
tried curriculum-in-a-box and sent it back as useless and controlling, too<br/>
much like what we&#39;re trying to forget. We&#39;re also NOT the people who care a<br/>
lot about hurting anyone&#39;s feelings (check Tia&#39;s tag line) or worrying<br/>
whether we&#39;re politically correct.<br/>
<br/>
HOMESCHOOLING  IS  POLITICALLY  INCORRECT.<br/>
Are you not aware of that?  Is that news to anyone?<br/>
<br/>
and...<br/>
UNSCHOOLING  IS  OFF  THE  CHARTS  INCORRECT,<br/>
even by most homeschoolers. If you&#39;re a newbie, welcome to grad school. This<br/>
is the hard core of the NOT SCHOOL apple.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, this list just might be where homeschooling should be planning its<br/>
national survival, or maybe its great surge to achieve total acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not here, where? And if it&#39;s not us, then who? I want not to cajole<br/>
people, to inspire, to encourage if possible...not to give ideas for daily<br/>
plans, but life-changing insights. Years ago, Holt&#39;s words hit me like an<br/>
avalanche. Gatto is doing it today for thousands.<br/>
<br/>
We are the edge of the fringe; the few. If people get nervous when we talk,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but this is not the place where we need to explain ourselves or<br/>
mince our words. My libertarian principles not mere political expressions,<br/>
they are life-guiding, and they are identical to unschooling principles --<br/>
freedom from outside control, personal responsibility for our individual<br/>
choices, and no violence or the threat of it. Homeschooling is the<br/>
anti-school, the refuge from control by (strange) strangers.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly respond to other people&#39;s posts in the best, most helpful way I<br/>
can, and I&#39;ll admit that most of what I believe will offend some group or<br/>
other, but I won&#39;t apologize, and I need a good reason to go away,<br/>
especially when the listmembers who have expressed interest in what I say<br/>
also seem to be the best-informed and most clear-headed.<br/>
<br/>
Hurray for unschooling. It is leading the way, but it takes courage.<br/>
<br/>
Courage. <br/>

Ned&#39;s often inflammatory rhetoric just delete his messages unread. <br/>
Mine too of course. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The moderator is right here, and so is the listowner.<br/>
<br/>
You seem like an intelligent person, Ned. Many of your posts are <br/>
witty, informative, enlightening and interesting. So it puzzles me <br/>
that you seem unable to distinguish those posts from the merely <br/>
obnoxious political propaganda posts that I and others have objected <br/>
to. And when we do object you try to whitewash the situation by <br/>
claiming nonsense such as what you wrote above. This seems pretty <br/>
disingenuous to me, Ned.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, Militaristic One, where were you when so many of us were saying <br/>
these same things five, ten, fifteen years ago? Why the sudden <br/>
interest in rallying the troops now? Methink thou dost probably have <br/>
something now to sell...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;HOMESCHOOLING  IS  POLITICALLY  INCORRECT.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nice rhetoric, Ned. But what do you really mean? Are you saying <br/>
you&#39;ve finally found a group that - some of us, anyway - understands <br/>
and relates to what you&#39;re trying to say? Did it ever occur to you <br/>
that many of us have been here for many years, saying the same <br/>
things, and your blatherings are nothing we haven&#39;t heard before <br/>
hundreds of times? You seem to have risen up from the ranks of this <br/>
list to seize some crown of virtuosity - King of the Hairy Unwashed <br/>
Unschoolers? Well, if you want to be our Fearless Leader, fine. Lead <br/>
on, McDuff. Some will probably follow you, but I think most will <br/>
probably do what all good unschoolers do, which is take what&#39;s useful <br/>
and pitch the rest and go merrily on their own way.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So if you were reading Holt all those many years ago, why have you <br/>
waited until now to speak up? No, really, I&#39;m interested. I&#39;ve read <br/>
quite a bit of your writings over the years, not here, but in many <br/>
other forums. I&#39;m pretty good at remembering names and I&#39;ve seen <br/>
yours around for many years. But why have you suddenly decided that <br/>
this list is a good place to spend your time and energies?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But your libertarian principles are just exactly that - Yours. Not <br/>
mine, not anyone else&#39;s. I don&#39;t have to clobber this list with my <br/>
personal political persuasions to get my point across, and neither do <br/>
you.<br/>
