<br>bit and her question or intro got swamped by more political discussions. &nbsp;In 
<br>the past on this list I have also had questions go unanswered, perhaps

<br>Like many have expressed, I love the freedom on unschooling.com to discuss

<br>not forget the newcomers, let us listen well, and pause before we write.

&lt;&lt;  In <br/>
the past on this list I have also had questions go unanswered, perhaps <br/>
because no one had an answer, or perhaps because it was not a dramatic <br/>
question.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When someone asks a group of 100 people a question, whose responsibility is <br/>
it to answer, really?  We can&#39;t be chastised for not welcoming each person <br/>
with the same enthusiasm.  The discussion seems like a meeting--if you come <br/>
in late/in progress, you stand in the back or find a seat until you know <br/>
what&#39;s going on and then you join the discussion or not.<br/>
<br/>
This list is a subset of www.unschooling.com, where questions are answered <br/>
just about by the hour.  If there&#39;s anyone who is on this list and not also <br/>
checking the message boards at unschooling.com, please do go there at least a <br/>
couple of times a week.  You can go to the newmessages screen (linked at the <br/>
bottom of the &quot;message boards&quot; screen.<br/>

The first two folders are specifically for newcomers, and people Do get <br/>
greeted, and their questions answered:<br/>
<br/>
Come Sit a Spell and Introduce Yourself February 3 - 07:43 am <br/>
Introduce yourself in this folder and read about others who are here. Folder <br/>
hosted by Karen Mowery. <br/>
<br/>
*   Getting started unschooling February 2 - 11:46 pm <br/>
If you think you want to unschool and want to know what to do first. Discuss <br/>
ways of getting started here. From a legal standpoint, and from the idea of <br/>
how to move from a &quot;school&quot; frame of mind into an unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
The description and purpose of this list is:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling.com&#39;s e-mail list, a hotbed of conversation. No set topics, <br/>
pretty much anything related to unschooling goes- and we all know that means <br/>
just about everything! Another good way to get to know other people, and <br/>
share opinions and information about all sorts of things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t write ANY of that, I don&#39;t work for the forum, I&#39;m just the <br/>
volunteer defender of radical unschooling and of the history of English.  But <br/>
the information is easy to come by, as are the best places for newcomers to <br/>
unschooling.com to break in with intros and questions. <br/>
<br/>
Coming into a discussion list which is sponsored by a specific forum, which <br/>
wasn&#39;t created by its members, and then breaking off a new list isn&#39;t really <br/>
awful, but it&#39;s worth reminding people that this list DOES have a set <br/>
purpose, and policies, and is part of a larger forum.  Anyone here should <br/>
have been able to make that point.<br/>
