I always wonder about the inherent narcisissism in marrying someone who&#39;s so <br/>
much like yourself. &lt;bwg&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
The taboo against marrying siblings and first cousins is justified with all <br/>
kinds of scare stories, but when tracked down few of them besides hemophilia <br/>
seem very scary at all.  It&#39;s just the fancy shroud the taboo is in.  <br/>

Last I heard in anthropology class, the only universal taboo is for a son not <br/>
