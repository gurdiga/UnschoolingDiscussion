&lt;&lt; Has anyone else on this list read it? Actually, someone on this list<br/>
 wrote it! At least Mary has dropped in on the list from time to time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read this book and re-read it every now and again still....I think it&#39;s <br/>
a wonderful book and guide for unschooling.<br/>
