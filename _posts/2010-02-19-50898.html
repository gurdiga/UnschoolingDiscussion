<div id="ygrps-yiv-816896874">&lt;&quot;I reckon I&#39;ll tell her I&#39;ve not seen it before (actually, I think it&#39;s  <br/>
true that I&#39;ve not seen it right through, so am &lt;probably fearing the unknown <br/>
 scenes that I may have missed)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;This sounds like you&#39;re cooking up a  scheme to fool her into watching it <br/>
with you, by telling a half truth, that  &lt;you haven&#39;t seen it, when you have <br/>
seen it, but maybe not every part of  it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I don&#39;t think this is a good way to build trust with her.  Especially <br/>
after telling the story of being deceptive &lt;with her own parents  and ends with: <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I hope that as a family our relationship will be trustful enough that  <br/>
schemes like that will be redundant.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Jennie, Point taken that I should consider things like this more  <br/>
carefully.  Mind you, I wasn&#39;t meaning to deceive her by using a  strategy <br/>
(she&#39;d always see through something like that anyway) - there  genuinely are <br/>
quite large chunks of the film that I&#39;ve not seen and the bits  that were <br/>
making me nervous are the ones I&#39;ve not actually viewed  myself.  Would it be a <br/>
half truth to say I&#39;d not watched it?   Possibly, though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
a half truth to say I&#39;ve not seen  Wagner&#39;s &quot;Ring&quot;, even though I have seen <br/>
and heard quite a lot of  excerpts.  That was what I was getting at, <br/>
although I must say I worded it  in such a way that it looked like a sneaky little <br/>
strategy.<br/>

You watched some of it, but not all.  That&#39;s the truth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204824403">Been offline a few days and just saw this.  Of course I recognized straightaway that you&#39;re spot on.  <br/>
<br/>
Possibly/probably I was deceiving myself.  Possibly I still have the need to follow a programme through to the end (therefore half-read or half-viewed doesn&#39;t equal read or viewed at all).  Either way, it&#39;s not exactly good thinking in terms of deschooling, let alone unschooling, and either is a bad attitude to pass on to one&#39;s family.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I appreciate about this list - you never take the easy, supportive &quot;It&#39;ll all work out fine&quot; route when we need to be told straight to re-think!<br/>
