to answer anyway.<br/>
<br/>
As for helping or not helping an interest or &quot;catching it&quot;---my parents <br/>
weren&#39;t dog- or horse-crazy. They *did* fuel the fire a litle bit, but NOT as much <br/>
as I would have liked, and not as much as some of my friends&#39; parents did <br/>
(buying farms and moving into the country for example! Or buying a RV to travel to <br/>
shows every weekend!). But their seeming lack of interest NEVER deterred me <br/>
from what I loved. I&#39;m a dog judge---and I&#39;ve owned a tack shop!<br/>
<br/>
My lack of interest in skateboarding will never deter Cameron&#39;s. No matter <br/>
how much I &quot;give&quot; to him in skateboarding, it won&#39;t compare to those kids whose <br/>
dads are ex-pro&#39;s or whose moms can &quot;buy & build&quot; skateparks. HE&#39;LL do that on <br/>
his own---HE&#39;LL pursue his own dreams. I&#39;ll do what I can (We just got back <br/>
from a week at Woodward Skate Camp!)---but his dreams are HIS. As an <br/>
unschooler, you&#39;ll have to do what you&#39;re capable of: he&#39;ll do the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Give what you can. If they&#39;re really interested, there&#39;s nothing you can do <br/>
to deter them.<br/>
<br/>
That said, there ARE people who ignore and belittle children to the point <br/>
that they HAVE no interests---but they aren&#39;t unschoolers! Give what you can. <br/>
They&#39;ll find ways to pursue their dreams.<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly--looking forward to seeing you at the conference too! It&#39;ll be an <br/>
eye-opener! These kids are REAL!<br/>
