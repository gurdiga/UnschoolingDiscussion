<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601071366">Dear Parents,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a great way for you and your children to get involved in an issue<br/>
which affects the local community, the nation, and ultimately the planet.<br/>
Now, less than 3 weeks away (Friday, November 24th--the day after<br/>
Thanksgiving) is the annual &quot;Buy Nothing Day.&quot;  All over the world there<br/>
will be events at malls, city centers, and other shopping precincts.  The<br/>
idea is to demonstrate against zombie-like obedience to the directives of<br/>
consumer culture.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you in Portland who would like to demonstrate, please contact<br/>
me privately and we&#39;ll see what we can organize.  For others, be sure to<br/>
read the following message, and go to the Adbusters link.  It will lead you<br/>
to people in your own area who are planning demonstrations on &quot;Buy Nothing<br/>
Day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &#39;TIS THE SEASON TO BUY NOTHING<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Attention, K-Mart shoppers...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Only three weeks remain until the most sacred day of the jamming<br/>
&gt; calendar. Buy Nothing Day 2000 promises to be the biggest<br/>
&gt; consumerism-awareness party ever. In the last two months, 250 Buy<br/>
&gt; Nothing Day organizers from 38 countries have signed on using our<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Spread the word! Over the years, we&#39;ve found the most powerful way to<br/>
&gt; hype the day is to buy airtime for the Buy Nothing Day TV<br/>
&gt; &quot;uncommercial&quot; across North America on CNN Headline News. That<br/>
&gt; burping pig just seems to stoke the fire of everyone involved, and to<br/>
&gt; bring the issues home to the mainstream.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; View the spot in Quicktime at:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can help get the spot into millions of living rooms this year.<br/>
&gt; Any amount you can donate to our airtime fund we&#39;ll put to use buying<br/>
&gt; as many spots as we can, right up until November 24th.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To let the pig out, contact Campaigns Manager Tom Liacas<br/>
