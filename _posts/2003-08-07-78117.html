The Camel&#39;s Nose Enters the Homeschooling Tent<br/>

<br/>
Ann: This week I want to share my thoughts about Section 6 of the <br/>
proposed homeschooling omnibus bill, HR 2732, which has been <br/>
misleadingly dubbed a non-discrimination bill. Several portions of <br/>
the bill are better described as special interest amendments, <br/>
including the Coverdell amendment, the focus of this Commentary.<br/>
<br/>
What it is: The Coverdell Educational Savings Plan offers tax <br/>
advantages to families in high tax brackets. The proposed amendment <br/>
expands the applicability of the Coverdell to &quot;students privately <br/>
educated at home under state law.&quot; Under this plan, funds must be <br/>
used for &quot;qualified elementary and secondary expenses.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have two major objections to this amendment. First, this amendment <br/>
helps a minority of homeschoolers, further entrenching the public <br/>
view that homeschoolers are indeed a special interest group. If <br/>
homeschoolers are seen as a special interest group marching to <br/>
Congress, the deregulation moves in heavily regulated states are <br/>
undermined. One sound argument for deregulation, that homeschoolers <br/>
ask for no special privileges and no tax dollars and thus should be <br/>
left alone, is lost if this amendment passes.<br/>
<br/>
The risks of perpetuating homeschooling as a special interest group <br/>
pale, though, when compared to my second major objection, that of <br/>
inviting the federal camel&#39;s nose into our homeschooling tent. This <br/>
amendment is a generous invitation for federal meddling in issues <br/>
that are best handled on the state or individual levels. That <br/>
invitation will not be turned down.<br/>
<br/>
The invitation is straightforward: the definition of &quot;qualified <br/>
elementary and secondary expenses&quot; will need clarification. The IRS <br/>
definition (under the Coverdell Plan as it now stands) is consistent <br/>
with traditional public and private schooling: tuition, fees, books, <br/>
supplies, equipment, special needs, room and board, even computers <br/>
and software that is predominately educational in nature. <br/>
Homeschoolers&#39; expenses, however, vary widely from those of their <br/>
schooled counterparts. Homeschoolers using the Coverdell will not <br/>
want to be restricted to the limitations of these school-type <br/>
expenses. Therefore, if this amendment passes, the IRS will seek a <br/>
definition of qualified expenses for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You may wonder how the IRS might go about the task of defining <br/>
homeschooling expenses. It is a simple matter, really, for one <br/>
federal agency to ask another agency for information. The Department <br/>
of Education would probably commission a study of homeschooling. Or <br/>
possibly, since homeschooling takes place in the home, the Department <br/>
of Health and Human Services will jump on board with a commissioned <br/>
study to define the type of home and family life that produces <br/>
successful homeschooled students.<br/>
<br/>
Who might carry out such a study? A state university, perhaps the U. <br/>
of Washington or the U. of Michigan, might take on the task. If a <br/>
study of homeschooling were contracted out to private agencies, an <br/>
established homeschooling organization - perhaps one in Pennsylvania, <br/>
Virginia, or Oregon - could win the project. Maybe even a charter <br/>
school curriculum provider such as K12 would put in a bid.<br/>
<br/>
Stop and think about that. An institutional study of homeschooling, <br/>
mandated by the IRS and put up for bid by DOE or DHHS, would take the <br/>
first steps to define legitimate homeschooling practice.<br/>
<br/>
Would information gleaned from such a study be used strictly for its <br/>
intended original purpose? Don&#39;t believe it. Any such study would be <br/>
available to the public, to be used widely for purposes I can only <br/>
imagine. Other studies would surely follow, and the definition of <br/>
homeschooling would become narrower and narrower.<br/>
<br/>
We must also expect mission creep, the idea that many an agency or <br/>
idea starts out small, with good and helpful intentions, and over <br/>
time, grows into a bureaucratic nightmare. Hmm, mission creep <br/>
examples that pop into mind include public schools, standardized <br/>
testing, income tax, the DOE, the DHHS, and Social Security - there <br/>
are many more. Mission creep is inevitable when government involves <br/>
itself in private affairs. Just as the camel&#39;s nose is followed by <br/>
the entire camel, agency expansion follows the poking of the federal <br/>
nose into private matters.<br/>
<br/>
Do we really want to invite the feds into the homeschooling tent? The <br/>
Coverdell amendment is a gold-embossed invitation.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up: The Coverdell amendment, if passed, offers tax benefits to <br/>
a minority of homeschoolers, opening the door for federal agencies to <br/>
take further interest in homeschooling. Once that door is open, our <br/>
historical understanding of how government agencies expand tells us <br/>
that the door will swing wider and it will not close. That the <br/>
Coverdell amendment also casts homeschooling as a special interest <br/>
group exacerbates the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I urge you to read this bill and think through the possible <br/>
ramifications for yourself. The bill is short, eight pages, and can <br/>
be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov</a> If you want to discuss HR <br/>
2732 online or read what others are thinking, there are a number of <br/>
online discussions going on, including the Yahoo group <br/>

When you call or E-mail your Representative:<br/>
If your Representative has co-sponsored HR 2732, ask him/her to <br/>
withdraw support. If you have already written or called in favor of <br/>
the bill, tell your Representative that you&#39;ve changed your mind and <br/>
why. You might point out the following:<br/>
A. Homeschooling is private education and we do not want special <br/>
consideration nor do we want special interest group status.<br/>
B. Helping a few homeschoolers take advantage of the Coverdell <br/>
Amendment compromises private status and is not in the best interest <br/>
of all homeschoolers.<br/>
C. Other issues in this bill are better handled at the state level, <br/>
on the individual level, or by working to improve the law for all <br/>
citizens.<br/>

HEM News & Commentary is a weekly report on what&#39;s happening in the <br/>
world of homeschooling. Gleanings from the news media, accolades and <br/>
pans, hot discussions, legal and legislative successes and problems - <br/>
all are fair game, and gathered in one column for your convenience.<br/>
<br/>
And just in case you don&#39;t have the time to read every word in print, <br/>
we will summarize and discuss key news and trends that we think are <br/>
the most provocative or that may have the greatest impact on the <br/>
future of homeschooling.<br/>
