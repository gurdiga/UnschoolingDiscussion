 </span></blockquote>My kids are 3 and 5 (I also have a 22-year-old--not unschooled--and a <br/>
grandbaby in another state). Some would say we&#39;re ot unschooling yet, as <br/>
unschooling exists only in opposition to forced governmental school, and <br/>
they&#39;re not of mandatory school age yet. Nevertheless, we&#39;ve been <br/>
hanging out on unschooling lists and message boards for about 4 years.<br/>
<br/>
A typical day for us involves trains. We get up and the kids play with <br/>
toy trains, eat, play with trains, go to the park, children&#39;s museum or <br/>
run errands, play with trains, rest, play with trains, eat, play with <br/>
trains, brush teeth and go to bed and read train magazines.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve learned about math, mechanics, geography, physics, fire <br/>
fighting, and many other subjects, as well as socializing with other <br/>
train buffs through their interest in trains.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853365658">I love this! I have a 3 year old and our day is dominated by trains too. I love hearing your description of the &quot;subjects&quot; your kids are learning. I can also add to that literature, history, social studies, geography, and art as we spend much time reading about trains, learning about different kinds of trains in history and around the world, and drawing, painting, and building trains, as well as numerous other activities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429078661">This made me laugh! A typical day for 2 of my kids (5 & 7) involves horses. They get up and play with horses. They build paddocks for their horses with Lego, they make stirrups and reins and ride each other, they look at horse books and ask me to read horse books to them. They draw horses and print out horse pictures from the computer. They know the names of all the different kinds of horses (I was amazed there are so many) and when we are out they are always on the look out for horses. When we see a horse they can name it (that&#39;s a chestnut filly, a leopard spotted appaloosa stallion). They occasionally get to have a horse riding lesson when staying with an unschooled friend.<br/>
<br/>
We all know so much more about horses!<br/>
