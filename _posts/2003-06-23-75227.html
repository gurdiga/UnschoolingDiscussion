<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628481683">In my opinion, I don&#39;t think a logical argument against same-sex marriage goes any further than homosexuality is wrong.  It&#39;s a primae facia belief.  People who oppose same-sex marriage seem to be VERY against children in those families and in our society growing up beliving that homosexuality is OK.  I heard parts of the beginning of CrossC Checkup (at 3 in afternoon  :O))))) and the Alliance critic could not make a real argument becuase he&#39;s relying on &quot;it&#39;s wrong.&quot;  He can&#39;t go further.  Attacked the courts for the rest of the time for giving Parliament a rabbit-punch. <br/>
IMHO, Parl. needed one for being glacially slow on this.  Times change and people don&#39;t want to hate each other.  Get over it.<br/>

I would like to hear or read an honest argument for why it dimiishes <br/>
heterosexual marriage. Personally, I think the more people we have in <br/>
loving unions and declaring that love before society, the better our <br/>
society will be for everyone.<br/>

It is important to remember that freedom of religion is protected under the <br/>
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, so religious groups have the <br/>
freedom to practice according to their doctrine. No religion can be forced <br/>
to marry anyone except whom they determine is marriageable. Catholic <br/>
priests, for example, will not be required to marry a gay couple, just as <br/>
they never have been and never will be required to marry a formerly <br/>
divorced couple.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277940261">Tim T, I&#39;m very sorry you have not met an accepting Christian in your <br/>
entire life.  To me that is almost unbearable to think!  I am a <br/>
Christian, and have know and enjoyed the company of most of the <br/>
people I have ever met.  I have preffered to stay away from some of <br/>
them simply because they were unhealthy people for me (by this I mean <br/>
they were abusive or overly negative), but I have never felt the <br/>
desire to sever ties to anyone based on superficial assumptions.  I <br/>
did have the unfortunate experience of trying to find a church to <br/>
join in my particular faith, and found that most were just as you <br/>
have seen; unaccepting.  They were unaccepting of me, and the only <br/>
thing &quot;wrong&quot; was to have a child as a teenager.  I have since found <br/>
one that will take me as I am, though.  I share your dissappointment <br/>
in the people, but I have never been dissappointed in the faith <br/>
itself.  I just wanted to let you to meet at least one of us that <br/>
loves people just for being people.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I hear what you&#39;re saying and there are many Christians out there who stand<br/>
in judgment on others. I have friends who would fall into that category.<br/>
What I have noticed is that these same people live with a lot of<br/>
condemnation. The burdens they place on themselves is heavy and they live in<br/>
fear of  not measuring up. That has got to cloud your vision with other<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I also think 90% of Christians miss the whole point of the Bible and it ends<br/>
up becoming a book containing the rules of how to live a *good* life. For me<br/>
the Bible is not about morality but God trying to find ways to communicate<br/>
with us because He loves us.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can all learn from one another no matter who we are or what we<br/>
believe. If we would just stop(leave the dogma on the doorstep) and listen<br/>
once in awhile. That sounds a bit naive doesn&#39;t it. Probably is.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I think the differences that exist  in people make life much more<br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Julie, who believes in Jesus but doesn&#39;t really like to use the term<br/>
Christian and Jesus freak has been way overdone!!<br/>

If all he knows about them is that they&#39;re Christian and he knows enough to <br/>
know the likelihood that they will judge him (his spelling, at least),  he&#39;s <br/>
accepting them on prior experience.  Any individual can raise the estimation of <br/>
a whole group.  I know my kids have changed a lot of people&#39;s minds about <br/>
whether unschooling can work.  But if someone said he had never met a homeschooler <br/>
who wasn&#39;t weird my first guess would be he hadn&#39;t met many.<br/>
<br/>
The odds of living in North America and not meeting thousands of Christians <br/>
by the time one is grown is zip.<br/>
<br/>
The arguments against same sex marriage are Christian arguments aren&#39;t they?  <br/>
  Homophobic Bible-reference stuff?  So no matter how many Christians might <br/>
say &quot;I don&#39;t agree with the particulars of that argument,&quot; the opposition still <br/>
takes a God-quoting position.<br/>
<br/>
And the reason it will be shot down hard in the U.S. and the reason the U.S. <br/>
won&#39;t sign off on the U.N.&#39;s rights of the child resolution  and the reason <br/>
the Equal Rights Amendment failed is chiefly because of the Christian position <br/>
on fathers having rights over wives and children.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which makes it sound like all liberals are nonChristian.<br/>
<br/>
Did you say you were in Canada? Are things that different in Canada?<br/>
<br/>
Since you make the distinction between Christian and Buddhist/Taoist I<br/>
assume you mean by Christianity the religion that encompases Presbyterians,<br/>
Lutherans, Methodists and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
And yet you mention their denial of evolution. That belief is only true of<br/>
Bible literalists and they don&#39;t represent the majority of Christians.<br/>
<br/>
In America it&#39;s a fairly safe assumption that everyone we meet is Christian.<br/>
And yet Americans can be anywhere from conservative to liberal. So it&#39;s not<br/>
safe to make the broad statement you did.<br/>
<br/>
*Unless* someone lives in the Bible Belt. *Unless* someone is confining<br/>
their assumptions about Christians to people who *tell* others they&#39;re<br/>
Christian.<br/>
<br/>
In the US people don&#39;t go around telling people they&#39;re Christians. It&#39;s<br/>
just assumed. It&#39;d be like telling people they&#39;re human ;-)<br/>
<br/>
*Unless* what they mean by Christian is fundamentalist Christian. And *then*<br/>
the reason they&#39;re telling you they&#39;re Christian is because they&#39;re<br/>
proselytizing. And proselytizing is part of the package that includes the<br/>
viewpoints you mentioned above. So it&#39;s likely that anyone who proselytizes<br/>
also holds the other beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
So, how do you know the judgemental people you&#39;ve met are Christian? Have<br/>
they told you? Are you aware of their religion because of the cirucmstances<br/>
you&#39;re meeting them in. Christians you meet in a demonstration outside a<br/>
Planned Parenthood clinic are not likely to be a broad spectrum of<br/>
Christians ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699809998">Before this goes down the path that it always goes down, be aware that not<br/>
everyone is using the word Christian the same way.<br/>
<br/>
To the broad spectrum of mainstream America, Christian means not Buddhist,<br/>
not Jewish, not Hindu, not Muslim. Obviously Christian means more than that,<br/>
but it&#39;s a broad religion encompassing a fair slew of beliefs and practices<br/>
centered around Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
But fundamentalist Christians of the most conservative type who resemble the<br/>
description Tim put forth, identify their narrow practice of Christianity as<br/>
Christian. Period. No one is Christian regardless of what you call<br/>
yourselves. Not Lutherans. Not Episcopalians. And very most definitely not<br/>
Mormons or Catholics.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;d be pointless to argue whether the spread of this movement is truth or<br/>
politics, but, regardless, it has a powerful political component. There are<br/>
many practices and beliefs in fundamentalism (of any belief system) that are<br/>
easily encouraged and exploited by those who want to create a movement.<br/>
(Which leads into HSLDA and Reconstructionists and lots else. The Christian<br/>
political movement is huge and you should be aware of it, especially since<br/>
it has an effect on homeschooling laws.)<br/>
<br/>
People who use the word Christian to mean fundamentalist Christian are not<br/>
at fault and shouldn&#39;t be attacked. They are using the word the<br/>
fundamentalists Christians use for themselves. If you want to be angry at<br/>
anyone, be angry at the fundamentalist Christians for appropriating the word<br/>
Christian and turning it into something narrow that doesn&#39;t reflect your<br/>
beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Since most (mainstream) Christians tend to feel their religion is private so<br/>
don¹t discuss it much and the (fundamentalist) Christians are very vocal<br/>
about their beliefs some people do mistakenly equate fundamentalist beliefs<br/>
with all Christians. That is not chance. When fundamentalist Christians<br/>
speak their opinions, they self identify themselves as Christians as though<br/>
they¹re speaking for all (mainstream) Christians but are actually only<br/>
speaking for their narrow definition of Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
It is *not* safe to make assumptions about how someone is using the word<br/>
Christian. If you guess wrong you will be, once again, going down the<br/>
rancorous path we just visited of two people who think they¹re arguing<br/>
different points of view about the same subject, when they aren¹t discussing<br/>
the same subject at all.<br/>
<br/>
Tim, I believe, has mistakenly equated fundamentalist beliefs with<br/>
mainstream Christian beliefs. Sandra (and others?) are using Christian as<br/>
the fundamentalist Christians do.<br/>
<br/>
*Please* read and respond thoughtfully, with all this in mind. If you are<br/>
not aware of the extent of the Christian political movement, then be aware<br/>
that there are people here with a great deal more knowledge on the subject<br/>
of ³Christians² than you have.<br/>
<br/>
This topic is *always* a minefield of misunderstanding. All because the<br/>
political movement of fundamentalist Christians has (deliberately) chosen to<br/>
identify themselves as Christians.<br/>

not at debate.<br/>
<br/>
The Bible does not need defended here. No one is attacking it.<br/>
<br/>
(And, besides, it isn&#39;t unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s naive to not be aware that people -- a whole political movement of<br/>

&quot;other&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
(And the political movement that encourages that does effect homeschooling<br/>
laws and percerptions of who we as homeschoolers are.)<br/>
<br/>
Again, that&#39;s not an attack on the Bible. The Bible is not unique in its<br/>
exploitability as a tool to create fear and to control people. It&#39;s not the<br/>
tool that&#39;s at fault. It&#39;s the people using the tool.<br/>

&lt;&lt; And the reason it will be shot down hard in the U.S. and the reason the <br/>
U.S. <br/>
 won&#39;t sign off on the U.N.&#39;s rights of the child resolution  and the reason <br/>
 the Equal Rights Amendment failed is chiefly because of the Christian <br/>
position <br/>
 on fathers having rights over wives and children.<br/>

Unfortunately.  Even tho these things are seen as constitutionally correct,  <br/>
the Christian majority in this country will have it&#39;s say. It works the same <br/>
for marriage rights.  <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly,  there is an anti sodomy law currently being challenged in <br/>
Texas by two men arrested in their homes. ( It specifically allows hetero sodomy, <br/>
but not homosexual sodomy, if you can believe that!)  If the courts find it <br/>
unconstitutional, the law, which seems to be a legislation of Christian <br/>
morality, may be struck down, and civil rights advocates will be able to use that <br/>
ruling as a base for challenging other laws, like the marriage statutes.  <br/>

And there have been plenty here that have corrected or questioned someone&#39;s <br/>
spelling! And lots of times, it was obvious that it was a typo. All of a sudden <br/>
now it is tacky to correct or ask about someone&#39;s spelling? But Moroon can be <br/>
questioned? Please, lets not be so nit picky.<br/>
<br/>
This was what I said in my post:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; BTW, the proper spelling is Christian ;-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did not put the smile because I didn&#39;t have anything to do, I put it there <br/>
as to show I was not saying it in a mean way.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of like when I say something is good or bad, and everyone knows that I <br/>
am not good with words but they jump on the list and correct me anyway.<br/>
