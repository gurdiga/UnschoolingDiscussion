&gt; the kids do in our little school, she had decided that she needed to make<br/>

This doesn&#39;t make sense.  Even if you WERE delaying their learning (which I<br/>
highly doubt!), neither an IQ test or psychological tests would reflect<br/>
that.  Neither measures educational progress.  And what they do measure is<br/>
really none of her business anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing your husband is accustomed to his mother&#39;s little games, since<br/>
this isn&#39;t the first problem you&#39;ve had with her.  That might account for<br/>
him not getting as angry at her as you are.  But it sounds like he well<br/>
understands your anger.<br/>
<br/>
What a mess -- congrats on not killing her yet.  I might have.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had an IQ test once and I don&#39;t remember filling in any little <br/>
circles.  That sounds more like a standardized test to me.  But then <br/>
again maybe there are IQ tests that I don&#39;t know about. <br/>

in a family of drug addicts doesn&#39;t think that it&#39;s abnormal.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too! Once, my mom asked an elementary teacher friend of hers to <br/>
give her a list of what a child my daughter&#39;s age should be doing in <br/>
different subjects.  She shared the list with me.  I was ticked at <br/>
that because I never asked my mom to ask her teacher friend for <br/>
advice on my behalf.  I remember hoping that she hadn&#39;t shared any of <br/>
her &quot;concerns&quot; about my unschooling with her teacher friend.  But now <br/>
I&#39;m really thankful that I (and my kids!)have never had to go through<br/>
anything like this! <br/>
