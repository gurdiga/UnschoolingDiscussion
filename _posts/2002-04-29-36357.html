&gt; thought very seriously about deleting this entire post before sending it, but<br/>
&gt; then decided that it was worth sending, if for no other purpose then for its<br/>
&gt; entertainment value.  (Forgive me, please, if you are not entertained.  I was<br/>
&gt; very much entertained by the writing of it.)  And, again, I mean no<br/>
&gt; disrespect whatsoever to any of the individual posters on this subject.  I<br/>
&gt; just happen to find the subject itself a most absurd little bird.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you, Kate, for sending this post, because you have definitely<br/>
entertained my family tonight in several fine posts.  &lt;G!!!&gt;<br/>
