&lt;&lt; We use no punishment or rewards, but our 3 y/o <br/>
<br/>
understands that playing his drums while someone is sleeping means <br/>
<br/>
that someone can&#39;t rest.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a three year old can get to a drum while someone&#39;s asleep, maybe the mom <br/>
needs to consider moving the drums.<br/>
<br/>
If a three year old WANTS to play a drum while someone is sleeping, he needs <br/>
some new videos to watch.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion. <br/>
There ARE rewards and punishments, in the form of natural consequences and <br/>
positive regard and gratitude.  If someone wakes up and objects, the <br/>
relationship between those people drops a notch.  When someone is really considerate, it <br/>
makes their next interactions easier.  That&#39;s part of the whole ideal package <br/>
of integrity, conscience, etc. that kids can develop if people encourage them <br/>
instead of limiting and shaming.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It feels great to help, sometimes, does&#39;t it?&quot; or  &quot;I noticed the adults <br/>
were asking your advice,&quot; or &quot;Thanks SO much for letting me sleep!&quot; and such <br/>
other honest, positive messages are worth lots more in the character-development <br/>
arena than the negative warning, shaming, stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you tell someone &quot;be good&quot; and they already meant to, some people might <br/>
want to be bad because it remains the only way to make a decision that&#39;s NOT <br/>
just &quot;doing what mom said.&quot;<br/>
