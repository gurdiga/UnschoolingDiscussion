&lt;&lt; &gt; Sorry, I disagree, there always comes a time, when a young child will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; try out his/or her boundries. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what traditional wisdom says, and so they never test it, because <br/>
they&#39;re afraid.<br/>
<br/>
School and traditional parenting are &quot;truths&quot; without test groups.<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling, we have a test group of people who are willing to see what <br/>
happens without the traditional &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what seems to be happening with my family and several others I know <br/>
personally:<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t limit food, they eat good food voluntarily.  And they don&#39;t eat <br/>
too much of it, the way kids deprived of food will gorge.  There&#39;s no reason <br/>
to gorge if they can have more when they get hungry.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t limit TV, they treat it just like the other resources in the <br/>
house.  They use it if they want to, and they don&#39;t when they&#39;d rather do <br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
If you let them do what they want to do from the time they&#39;re little, like if <br/>
they want to go to the other end of the park you say &quot;okay, let&#39;s go&quot; instead <br/>
of &quot;no, you stay here because I want to just sit,&quot; then they trust you, and <br/>
they are not frustrated and waiting for their moment to get away from you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; Sorry, I disagree, there always comes a time, when a young child will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; try out his/or her boundries.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This &quot;always&quot; seems to be based on experience with children who were put <br/>
where they didn&#39;t want to be and made to do what they didn&#39;t understand or <br/>
agree to or want.<br/>
<br/>
Any sane human would test those boundaries, and the sanest and smartest would <br/>
break them entirely.<br/>
<br/>
I have a teenaged boy without a curfew.  It&#39;s been two years since he came <br/>
home every single night.  He comes home most nights.  Even many nights when <br/>
he&#39;s said &quot;I might stay at Will&#39;s&quot; and I&#39;ve already said &quot;okay,&quot; he often <br/>
comes home to sleep in his own bed. <br/>
<br/>
His home isn&#39;t a place he&#39;s just waiting to escape from.  It&#39;s a place he <br/>
LIKES to be.  He likes it because he&#39;s not made to be here against his will, <br/>
on my schedule.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s had a job for over two years.  Has he &quot;tested the boundaries&quot; at work?  <br/>
Not that I know of.  He&#39;s been sick once.  He&#39;s been late twice, once was my <br/>
fault.  Late by minutes.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s  never so much as taken a soda to pay for it later.  He is scrupulously <br/>
honest and trusted there.  <br/>
<br/>
WHY?<br/>
<br/>
Because people have been scrupulously honest with him and let him be trusted <br/>
and trusting.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about an entirely different model of living with children.   I <br/>
don&#39;t command them, yet they display all the traits &quot;commanding&quot; parents <br/>
would like to see.  Except one.  Obedience.  They don&#39;t respond mindlessly <br/>
and immediately to commands.  If I need something done, I explain what and <br/>
why, and if it makes sense they do it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m careful to make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone who&#39;s not willing to be careful to make sense want other <br/>
humans obeying them without thinking?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, so they don&#39;t get hit by a car.<br/>
<br/>
None of my kids have been hit by cars.<br/>
<br/>
My mom had a third baby, when I was 19 and gone.<br/>
<br/>
He was hit by a car and had a broken thigh.  he was in a bowlegged cast from <br/>
the chest down for most of the time he was six years old.     She spanked him <br/>
LOTS, from the time he was a crib baby.  She certainly  yelled at him a lot <br/>
and told him what to do.  But when he got hit by a car, she was in the bar <br/>
drinking, and he was in the alley outside the bar, trying to cross to go to <br/>
his bicycle.<br/>
<br/>
Being close enough to a child that you can hold his hand, or be the tall <br/>
person the driver sees is infinitely better than training him to obey your <br/>
commands.<br/>

night at his new friends&#39; house last night, an exciting place with all this <br/>
stuff that they have that he doesn&#39;t have.  Yet, when invited to stay a <br/>
second night, he wanted to come home.  The reason why is that he likes <br/>
being home.  He loves visiting friends, and he loves being home.  And he <br/>
knows himself enough to be where he wants to be.  He knows that when an <br/>
invitation comes up for him, he&#39;s not going to get interference from his <br/>
folks.  I&#39;m glad for him.<br/>
