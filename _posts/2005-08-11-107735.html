<div id="ygrps-yiv-976181265">Hello all! I&#39;m working on a webzine/comic/animation/games type site <br/>
for unschoolers. I was curious if there were anyone (especially <br/>
kids) out there who are:<br/>
<br/>
1. Cartoonists<br/>
2. Web Designers<br/>
3. Flash Animators<br/>
4. Musicians (especially whole bands of unschoolers)<br/>
5. Writers<br/>
6. Game Programmers<br/>
7. Other Creative Stuff<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if there is anyone out there interested in LEARNING <br/>
any of those things, let me know. Apart from the music, I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing all those myself, and I just thought it might be better to get <br/>
the POV of the target audience and the site&#39;s characters involved <br/>
rather than just one guy&#39;s ideas.<br/>

 So glad you are doing this!  I have a 13 year old<br/>

4. Musicians (especially whole bands of unschoolers)<br/>
