 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what makes life the journey and not the destination.  It&#39;s like when I <br/>
was a teeenager and I would go out in England in the winter with a thin dress <br/>
on and high heel shoes in 40 degree weather and be freezing my bum off, my <br/>
mum would say &quot;put a coat on your&#39;ll still look good when you get where you <br/>
are going, but you won&#39;t be cold&quot;... Would I listen?  Heck no... I needed to <br/>
experience it myself and then see it was a silly thing so that I can say to <br/>
my son when he&#39;s going out in his underwear to play on the playset in the <br/>
garden in the winter &quot;it&#39;s cold honey don&#39;t you think you need to put some <br/>
clothes on?&quot; and he can say &quot;no it&#39;s not&quot; and on and on and on.... Hopefully  <br/>
I won&#39;t say that to my son and I will be more enlightened, that&#39;s the whole <br/>
idea of unschooling for me... but as I grew up I couldn&#39;t learn by others&#39; <br/>
mistakes and there are very few people who can.  We have to experience those <br/>
things for ourselves and then make decisions about whether a situation works <br/>
or not.<br/>

True, but unless people have the knowledge of the possibility of unschooling <br/>
and the courage to try it, they won&#39;t live long enough to experience it <br/>
themselves.  Kids&#39; lives go quickly, and it&#39;s easy to miss information like <br/>
this out in the wide school-filled world.  Then it&#39;s easy to experiment with <br/>
two or three different curriculae until the kid is too old to experience <br/>
child-like wonder.<br/>
<br/>
It happens.<br/>
