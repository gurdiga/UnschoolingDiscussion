Maybe they have but I will tell you what happened to me.<br/>
<br/>
I try to be organized.  Probably too much so.  So at the beginning of the <br/>
year I set up a nice little log file on my computer.  &quot;I&#39;ll go in every day <br/>
and fill in the appropriate spaces and won&#39;t that be nice at the end of the <br/>
year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Weeeelllll . . <br/>
<br/>
Then real life happened.<br/>
<br/>
Our &quot;projects&quot; and &quot;activiites&quot; don&#39;t fit into nice, neat little categories, <br/>
we don&#39;t do the same thing every day, we drop things and pick up new ones, <br/>
things overlap, great leaps are taken that just don&#39;t translate very well to <br/>
this sort of tracking.<br/>
<br/>
So, at the end of most days I would just write up what we did.  Mostly I <br/>
lumped things under vague headings of math or reading -- if it was math or we <br/>
went to the library this was easy.  Science exp = science heading.  But the <br/>
bulk of what is in my log is narrative.  We went here, we saw this, we talked <br/>
to this person, we did that.  This, that and the other might cover a broad <br/>
range of PE, social studies, science, reading, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I did dedicate a page a day and that was about the best I could think of.<br/>
<br/>
Next year I&#39;m buying a thicker spiral notebook.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions are welcome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705538509">I am also interested in people&#39;s suggestions for portfolios. Unlike some<br/>
hsers I know, we are not rquired to keep or show one, but I&#39;m thinking it<br/>
would be nice to have anyway. Of course, in my usual manner, I&#39;ll prob.<br/>
start out gung ho and then i&#39;ll peter out, but I&#39;ll try.<br/>
