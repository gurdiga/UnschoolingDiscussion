Sounds idyllic!  I&#39;d like to live more &#39;country&#39; but dh <br/>
wouldn&#39;t...  still, gotta love him, he&#39;s really &#39;come <br/>
around&#39; to pro-home-ed now...  <br/>
<br/>
We unschool because we think it&#39;s right that our kids <br/>
have the choice of what to do with their time, within <br/>
whatever time/money restrictions are on our family.  We <br/>
have that choice and struggle to come to terms with it, <br/>
and I for one don&#39;t want that for my children.  <br/>
Educationally, physically and last but by no means <br/>
least emotionally imposing school simply isn&#39;t good <br/>
enough, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you asked ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252703478">We unschool because we want to choose the lives we lead, instead of having<br/>
them decided for us.  We want our children to have the opportunity to do the<br/>
same.  To badly paraphrase Thoreau, there are no philosophers anymore, only<br/>
philosophy teachers.  I think that&#39;s true, and I&#39;d rather be and raise a<br/>
philosopher.<br/>
Do your children currently go to pre-school?  If not, and they&#39;re spending<br/>
their days with you, you are already doing what we do here.  If it feels<br/>
right now, there&#39;s no reason to believe it won&#39;t feel right when they turn<br/>
the magic kindergarten age :).  Good luck!  ~Rue<br/>

&lt;&lt; We&#39;re choosing a different way to live but aside from ideas <br/>

these ideas.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ideas and words are all you get.<br/>
<br/>
If you saw statistics that wouldn&#39;t necessarily apply to your family.  How <br/>
many people live in the situation you do?  The skills and interests you and <br/>
your wife have will interact with your children&#39;s temperaments and interests <br/>
in ways unique on the planet.  <br/>
<br/>
We know lots about the problems of school.  Of unschooling, you will get <br/>
ideas and words.<br/>
<br/>
There are few endeavors which so many people have shared so freely.  I think <br/>
the best resource (perhaps stating the obvious again, but it&#39;s not obvious to <br/>
everyone here) is to read the library and archives at www.unschooling.com, at <br/>
HEM&#39;s site, at NHEN&#39;s site.  There is a wealth of current information added <br/>
to daily.<br/>
<br/>
Read John Holt if you haven&#39;t already.  Teach Your Own is my recommendation <br/>
if you&#39;re only going to read one.  Learning all the Time and Never Too Late <br/>
inspired me too.<br/>

<br/>
When we read about unschooling it was a &quot;Duh&quot; moment, finally I<br/>
understood why all of the &quot;education&quot; methods didn&#39;t fit.  Learning can&#39;t<br/>
be cut up into bits that fit into a curriculum or schedule, it&#39;s like<br/>
breathing and it&#39;s unavoidable.  I don&#39;t think there is anything more<br/>
important that I can give my children than the understanding that they<br/>
have complete control of their learning.  Every time we tell children<br/>
they must learn this or that and assign a &quot;time&quot; to that learning we tell<br/>
them they are not capable of learning on their own or even knowing what<br/>
they need to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215527372">Hi Vincent and Kim,<br/>
I always hesitate a bit before answering this question....here is why....<br/>
I did not choose to nor do I, homeschool for educational reasons.  Ha!  That<br/>
usually gets me some strange looks...<br/>
I remember precisely when I decided I would homeschool.  My oldest son (now8)<br/>
was 2 at the time.  He was running down the hill to the barn laughing and<br/>
laughing.  It suddenly hit me that he would be going to school in 3 short<br/>
years possibly earlier!  My heart just collapsed and I couldn&#39;t even think of<br/>
the possibility of him going away for the whole day.  I would miss him<br/>
terribly, he would miss me, and there is always something interesting to do<br/>
on a farm.  He would miss so much life!  That did it, I started researching<br/>
right then.  I read and read and read ect....  I read John Holt, old Growing<br/>
Without Schooling Magazines, Old Home Education Magazines, and every book I<br/>
saw mentioned in the back of other books.  I specifically drawn to John Holt<br/>
and Grace Llewellyn.  I learned from everything I read though.  It made me<br/>
see how diverse homeschooling can be.<br/>
I also researched the laws for my state during this time.<br/>
I also looked into support groups, and made contact with a local one.  It was<br/>
interesting to talk to everyone but my sons (we had added one during this<br/>
time) were much too young to do much.  I then renewed contact later when all<br/>
three of my kids were older.<br/>
I still read and read....  I still talk and talk....  It helps to share.<br/>
I hope this helps you...and enjoy your family.  That is what we do mostly.<br/>
