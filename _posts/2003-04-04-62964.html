<div id="ygrps-yiv-767676823">&lt;I think lots of people don&#39;t really feel that way. Gee, maybe <br/>
it is 13 years of schooling in which the only way to be content and <br/>
happy was to NOT strain against the many rules and to accept it that <br/>
much of life means not having any choices.&gt;                        I have a big sign on our refrigerator that sits right in that way of everything in our kitchen that reads - life is the result of choices that I make everyday. I love that saying. It has come in to play this week while I&#39;ve been thinking alot about this group and what I may gain from listening to all of your many writings (I dont know how some of you keep up there are so many posts on this list!) and I was with my ten year old thinking thinking thinking about choices and letting go and what is &quot;my issue&quot; vs her issues ect and she was doing her homework and I was doing the dishes and the two little ones were in bed an she looked at me and said, &quot;Oh I forgot my spelling words again.&quot; Some history here: Molly, my ten year old, has been in school her whole life. She has struggled like crazy, been diagnosed with ADD, NLD and God knows what else. Teachers have spent the last five years critisizing her and I have had to go in to school on so many occasions just to try to calmly and politely try to educate those &quot;educators&quot; about education... She is the main reason that we are looking in to homeschooling and next year we are thinking of taking her out of school and starting. The two little ones will never go to school, they will be homeschooled... so back to the story... my normal response is a sigh, or some sort of disapproval (because I think that I never thought enough about this and I feel like this must be some general thing about me as a mother and person) So I looked at her, looked at the sign and said, Oh well, that gives us so much extra time tonight, what shall we do? I smiled at her and we had a great ole time, playing with her saxophone, reading and just being together. So, I guess I am learning here... Thanks Kelli<br/>
