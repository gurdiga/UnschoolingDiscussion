<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943608957">My mom used to pull all my teeth out just as they got loose.  I have really <br/>
crooked teeth.  I don&#39;t know that she caused any of that, but I honestly do <br/>
suspect it.  Because there used to be quite a bit of blood, I think she pulled <br/>
them way before they would have come out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
She said I could choke on one.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
So because that was SO dumb and awful, I never even offered to help one of my <br/>
kids, and they didn&#39;t want it. Each of them just let the teeth come out at <br/>
their own speed, gently, no blood, happily.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty can also leave a zit alone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m impressed.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom created a frenzied feeling about splinters, loose teeth, zits.  They <br/>
had to be out NOW!! NOW!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have internal frenzy sometimes, but I keep it to myself as much as I can.<br/>

I doubt it, too.  When Abby lost her first tooth, she swallowed it.  She<br/>
used to like to wiggle it around with her tongue.  And I think it just<br/>
slipped away when it was ready to come out.  They are so tiny,  I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine anyone choking on them!<br/>

ones. I want to hold him down and pop them, but I don&#39;t. It is very hard not <br/>
to.<br/>
