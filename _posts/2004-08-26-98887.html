<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022684050">Hello! I am new to this list, have been reading for several weeks and <br/>
enjoying the conversation and information.  I am Shannon, dh Paul, and ds <br/>
Logan who will be 6 in November. And we have a baby girl due any day now! <br/>
We live in northwest NJ, very close to Easton, PA.  My greatest challenge <br/>
so far has been to &quot;unschool myself&quot; and trust that learning will happen.<br/>
<br/>
We do not receive any support from our extended family in our unschooling <br/>
decision. We are constantly asked &quot;are you still planning to homeschool?&quot; <br/>
(Forget about even discussing unschooling - &quot;home&quot;schooling is tough enough <br/>
for them to accept.)<br/>
<br/>
My son is quite attached to Mom & Dad. He has no interest in participating <br/>
in any type of class, sport team, instruction, etc, unless I am right by <br/>
his side. We have tried a couple trial classes (in things that he seems to <br/>
truly enjoy such as tae kwon do and gymanstics), and he typically lays on <br/>
the floor and cries. He will not &quot;line up&quot; or do what the other kids are <br/>
doing or follow the instructor.<br/>
<br/>
My family tells me it is &quot;unhealthy&quot; for him to be with me (or Dad) all the <br/>
time and he needs to be able to interact with others and follow instruction <br/>
from others.  I do not agree with this, but on some level it does eat away <br/>
at me deep inside. I was in every class imaginable as a child and I think <br/>
it is hard for me to understand how he could not want to participate in <br/>
these types of things. But I have realized that I need to accept his <br/>
personality and find ways to work WITH it, not against it.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is - does anyone have any advice on how to work with this <br/>
personality style?  I can see clearly what he is interested in, but quite <br/>
often I just don&#39;t know how to further his learning without looking for <br/>
&quot;outside&quot; help (class, etc.)  For example, he is extremely interested in <br/>
medieval living, especially the fighting. (And I have read with great <br/>
interest the recent thread on SCA.) I suggested a fencing class or getting <br/>
involved in a Ren Faire. He tells me very bluntly that he will only do it <br/>
if I do it with him.  OK, but it&#39;s not that easy to find this type of <br/>
scenario. Most will expect the children to participate with other children <br/>
- not adults.  Am I just looking in the wrong places?<br/>
<br/>
I know that he will not be &quot;hanging on my leg&quot; when he is 16 years old. I <br/>
cherish the fact that he wants to be with me now. But the part of me that <br/>
is &quot;schooled&quot; is concerned that he may be missing his chance for many <br/>
things. For example, the typical schooled child will begin on a T-ball or <br/>
little league team (my son also loves baseball, when played by *his* rules <br/>
with Mom & Dad) at, what, age 5 or 6? So if my son is not comfortable <br/>
participating on a team until he&#39;s 10 - how will we find a &quot;place&quot; for him <br/>
since he has not started on the same level?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening/reading. Looking forward to chatting with you all!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534519079">** We do not receive any support from our extended family in our <br/>
unschooling<br/>
decision. We are constantly asked &quot;are you still planning to homeschool?&quot;<br/>
(Forget about even discussing unschooling - &quot;home&quot;schooling is tough enough<br/>
for them to accept.)**<br/>
<br/>
(My son is 10.)<br/>
<br/>
When my son was &quot;kindergarden age&quot; I nearly avoided in-laws for an <br/>
entire year.  So, it appears that fear of criticism is an issue that <br/>
even mouthy and outspoken people like me can have a problem with.  You <br/>
are not alone.   (I stopped hiding after the first year.  I stress to <br/>
the grandparents the advantages of having a kid who is free to spend a <br/>
day with relatives any time they are in town.  And I&#39;ll shamelessly tell <br/>
them that I think having time to be with extended family is more <br/>
valuable than being in school.  One can learn a lot about history, <br/>
culture, and any other special interests from family members.)<br/>
<br/>
** My son is quite attached to Mom & Dad. He has no interest in <br/>
participating<br/>
in any type of class, sport team, instruction, etc, unless I am right by<br/>
his side. We have tried a couple trial classes (in things that he seems to<br/>
truly enjoy such as tae kwon do and gymanstics), and he typically lays on<br/>
the floor and cries.**<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big variation in how much kids like group activites.  I did <br/>
some Kindermusik when my son was three, and even though the mom or dad <br/>
is there sitting on the floor doing the musical activities with the kid <br/>
and dancing around in circles with them, there were some kids that <br/>
declined to participate most of the time.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to <br/>
force it.  I won&#39;t insist that my son do an activity that he is opposed to.<br/>
<br/>
I have an only child, and sometimes I borrow a more enthusiastic child <br/>
when we are going some place with activities.  (I volunteered my husband <br/>
to supervise an extra kid at the Sacramento conference so the boys could <br/>
play on the game deck and go do the climbing wall together.)<br/>
<br/>
** My family tells me it is &quot;unhealthy&quot; for him to be with me (or Dad) <br/>
all the<br/>
time...**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that this is true.  I think it&#39;s a leftover from <br/>
old-fashioned, Germanic parenting that was reinforced by Freud.  The <br/>
underlying belief is that a boy who spends a lot of time being close to <br/>
his mom will be a &quot;girlie-man&quot; (as Ahnold calls it) and won&#39;t be hard <br/>
and cold enough to be a valuable member of the Prussian army.  Let&#39;s <br/>
think about goals here! &lt;g&gt;  We&#39;re not trying to raise relentless <br/>
killing machines &lt;g&gt;, so let&#39;s throw out the tactics that were developed <br/>
for that.<br/>
<br/>
** I do not agree with this, but on some level it does eat away<br/>
at me deep inside.**<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;m always more comfortable when other people agree with me.<br/>
<br/>
**I was in every class imaginable as a child and I think<br/>
it is hard for me to understand how he could not want to participate in<br/>
these types of things. But I have realized that I need to accept his<br/>
personality and find ways to work WITH it, not against it.**<br/>
<br/>
Right.  People are different.  My mom was really extroverted and really <br/>
needed to get out of the house, and as a kid I ended up feeling that I <br/>
was inferior because I wasn&#39;t as &quot;brave&quot; and good with people as she <br/>
was.  (Yes, she got impatient with my shyness a lot.)  (I&#39;m not saying <br/>
you are the same, it&#39;s just the first thing that springs into my mind <br/>
when I try to visualize a kid that doesn&#39;t want to be in class.)<br/>
<br/>
** So my question is - does anyone have any advice on how to work with this<br/>
personality style? **<br/>
<br/>
Do you go to a local unschooling or homeschooling park day?  (That&#39;s my <br/>
knee jerk &quot;solution&quot; to every social problem.)  It might be great to <br/>
find another kid that has a really similar temperament and then do stuff <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
And keep repeating the quote about education not being &quot;filling a <br/>
pail&quot;.  Teaching doesn&#39;t always cause good learning.  The teaching can <br/>
be confusing, or too slow, etc.  Kids who just mess around with stuff <br/>
can often learn more that way than through a class.<br/>
<br/>
I think you will be going through a process where you change from thinking:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;how can we learn more about this; I know there must be a class <br/>
somewhere?&quot; <br/>
to<br/>
&quot;how can we learn about this without taking a class?&quot;<br/>
to<br/>
&quot;how can we have fun with this?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not at all surprising that classes might be your first idea if you <br/>
yourself loved taking classes.  (My first idea is to always find a book <br/>
about something, and that&#39;s not what works with my kid.)  You&#39;re <br/>
branching out from your normal pattern of thinking to include wider and <br/>
wider possibilities.  It&#39;ll take practice.<br/>
<br/>
I wish more classes let kids watch first.  If all the local parks and <br/>
rec classes had video clips on their website, there&#39;s a chance that I <br/>
could get my kid to take more classes.<br/>
<br/>
**So if my son is not comfortable<br/>
participating on a team until he&#39;s 10 - how will we find a &quot;place&quot; for him<br/>
since he has not started on the same level?**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  My son is 10 and doesn&#39;t play team sports.  My husband <br/>
wanted to sign him up at 6, but I thought he was too tender and too <br/>
likely to burst into tears to play a game with a lot of rules with a lot <br/>
of kids he didn&#39;t know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806512625">Hi Shannon,<br/>
Your little guy sounds like mine and so does your extended family.  Ben is 5.5 and really only wants to do things if I am with him, or his dad.  He&#39;ll go to a friend&#39;s house to play without me, for a few hours and he has a teenage sitter that he really likes, so he is able to be without us, but he prefers to be with me or his dad.  Which works out well because we prefer it when he&#39;s with us.<br/>
<br/>
My mom and dad are so overly concerned that he is not with other people.  &quot;he really needs to be away from you some of the time, this is not normal or healthy for him to be so dependent on you.&quot;  Blah, blah blah.  It makes them crazy that they have friends whose grandkids come and stay most of the summer when they are only 4-5, and he won&#39;t even stay overnight.  My dad is a huge grouch and a ball of stress, that probably has more to do with it than anything with them.  He doesn&#39;t like to be there without me.<br/>
<br/>
He also won&#39;t take any classes unless I stay.  We have great science classes at museums and zoos, when I suggested one that he could go alone for an hour and a half, he said no way!  So, I go with him.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as it lasting forever, one of my fellow LLL leaders told me this when I asked her about it.  Her son never left her side, was homeschooled, co-sleeping, extended nursing, basically similar to us.  She thought he&#39;d never become dependent.  At the time I asked her about it, he was traveling through Europe alone, and she hadn&#39;t talked with him in 2 weeks because he has no cell phone with him, and very little money.  He is 23.  <br/>
So it does happen eventually.<br/>
<br/>
My ds hasn&#39;t really showed an interest in sports, he&#39;s small for his age and not very athletic (if there is such a thing at 5).  I guess I&#39;m just going to let him go at his own pace for things.  I don&#39;t have any advice or help, but just wanted to let you know, you are not alone.  <br/>

are his parent and know what is best for him.  Whether<br/>
you are a christian or not, in my mind you are the<br/>
parent that God chose for him and you are the best<br/>

<h4>Carmen McFarlin</h4>
<time>26 Aug 2004, at 12:09pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897913941">Dear Betsy and Elizabeth,<br/>
<br/>
First, let me introduce myself.  My name is Carmen and I live in <br/>
Austin, Texas, with my husband Michael, and our three daughters, <br/>
ages 5, 2.5, and 15 months.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, Eva, is very cautious and does not like to <br/>
participate in large groups of anything.  Sometimes, even meeting <br/>
ONE new person can overwhelm her and send her into my lap (as <br/>
happened last week when we tried to meet with a piano teacher).  We <br/>
tried dance class...lasted a month, with me in the room the whole <br/>
time so that she could check in with me whenever she needed to.  We <br/>
did do a year of pre-school for three hours four times a week.  She <br/>
hid behind me at the door or would go slowly toward an acitivity <br/>
area, avoiding eye contact with any of the teachers or kids.  She <br/>
enjoys people, just on HER terms, which usually means small groups <br/>
and knowing where I am at all times.  She went to vacation bible <br/>
school for the firt time this past June, but her grandmother (who <br/>
she&#39;s very close to) was with her the whole time and it was at a <br/>
church that she has gone to since she was two (but this is the first <br/>
year she would try vbs).<br/>
<br/>
I used to be really bothered by all of this and wondered if I needed <br/>
to &quot;toughen&quot; her up.  But I realized that this was because I had <br/>
been forced to develop a false bravado as a child as a defense <br/>
mechanism.  My parents divorced when I was two and I was shuffled <br/>
between relatives/friends/daycare as my mom had to work.  She <br/>
remarried when I was six and looking back, I realized that I was <br/>
really miserable but tried my darndest to hide it.  I acted out a <br/>
lot and became very sarcastic and snotty and tried to pretend <br/>
nothing bothered me(STILL working on that!). <br/>
<br/>
I think Betsy is very right when she talks about that old-school <br/>
mentality of forcing kids into situations to &quot;toughen them up&quot;.  I <br/>
remember telling another pre-school mom that if Eva didn&#39;t want to <br/>
go to pre-school, she didn&#39;t have to...and the mom was just <br/>
flabbergasted.  &quot;How will she EVER learn that she HAS to do things, <br/>
especially those things she doesn&#39;t want to?&quot; she gasped.  How, <br/>
indeed?!  What if she learned instead that she could stay at home <br/>
and play with mom and her two younger sisters and be happy and safe <br/>
and that her mom and dad would never force her into a room full of <br/>
strangers and then walk away, telling her all the while that &quot;it&#39;ll <br/>
be okay, honey&quot;?  Yes, it might turn out to be fun, IF she stopped <br/>
crying or hiding in the corner.  What about the damage I had done to <br/>
her trust of us?  How much better if EVA chose to go into that room <br/>
of her own accord?  And if that never happens, so be it.  Life is <br/>
full of other things, other riches, that aren&#39;t exclusive to a dance <br/>
class, an art class, an acting class...all of those things that I&#39;ve <br/>
tried and that we now, SHOCK, do at home!<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s been the biggest challenge for me in my unschooling <br/>
journey...learning to let go of expectations and just following my <br/>
daughters&#39; lead.  I know in the long run that each of my daughters <br/>
will have a true sense of themselves since they were never forced to <br/>
be someone they were not, or never allowed to be who they truly <br/>
were.  And I, in the process, am getting to know myself all over <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you for sharing your experiences, doubts, fears, <br/>
victories, and advice.  Life is so exciting and overwhelming at <br/>
times, but I always come away from reading these posts with a <br/>
renewed sense of purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

Study done on homeschoolers shows the average homeschooler is in 5.2 <br/>
activies per kid.  (4-H, Boy Scouts, church, volley ball, etc.)<br/>

At a young age you can take him to the zoo, museums, parks, library, <br/>

(Forget about even discussing unschooling - &quot;home&quot;schooling is tough enough <br/>
for them to accept.) <br/>
 <br/>
----------------------<br/>
 <br/>
I only discuss unschooling with people who I feel have a valid interest or<br/>
who I feel will support it, if that&#39;s an issue.  It&#39;s hard sometimes to find<br/>
like-minded  people, but I&#39;d encourage you to keep searching through<br/>
attending homeschool events (or setting up your own, like a game of wiffle<br/>
ball at the park)  until you find a family or two that both you and your son<br/>
hit it off with.  <br/>
 <br/>
Having that support is very valuable to me.  I actively searched for a<br/>
friend who would understand unschooling.  It&#39;s not my nature to seek people<br/>
out, generally, but I felt we had a need and so I kept my antennae up,<br/>
looking for someone that might fit the bill.  My girls were invited to a<br/>
birthday party a year and a half ago and I  chatted with another mom whose<br/>
dd was also at the party and had a dd the same age as my oldest. Our lives<br/>
had a lot of parallels and I just had a feeling that we could all be good<br/>
friends.  It isn&#39;t my tendency to call up people I&#39;ve just met and ask them<br/>
to visit, but after the party I got her email address from the lady who<br/>
hosted the party and emailed and asked her if she wanted to get together for<br/>
a play date.  I am so glad I did.  She and her dd are now our unschooling<br/>
support and best friends.<br/>
 <br/>
Keep looking and maybe you will find the support you need.<br/>

My girls are just like that.  For a while I felt like attending group things<br/>
was something we *should* do.  &lt;got to have well rounded kids, you<br/>
know...ack!&gt;  I finally accepted that my kids were just happier staying home<br/>
or visiting with friends.  (Glad it didn&#39;t take me too long to learn that!)<br/>
I stopped trying to get them to go to different events.  I still offer to<br/>
take them to things that come up, if I think they are interested, but if<br/>
they decline then I drop it. Life is better this way.  They are happier and<br/>
I am less stressed.  It&#39;s no fun anyway to go to a group event and have your<br/>
kids clinging to your legs.  He&#39;ll begin to go to things that interest him<br/>
when HE is ready.  <br/>

Try not to let their questioning of you make you question yourself.  No one<br/>
becomes more outgoing by being forced to interact with other people.  If<br/>
anything it will make them withdraw further into themselves.  He just needs<br/>
time and space to develop at his own pace.  <br/>
 <br/>
My VERY shy dd (9) (never could have imagined this a couple years ago and<br/>
it&#39;s still hard to believe a year later) entered her cat in a pet show last<br/>
fall and stood up in front of a dozen or 20 people and read some notes about<br/>
her pet.  (same kid who wouldn&#39;t read in front of anyone for several years.)<br/>
Then she answered questions from the group.  I read about the show on a<br/>
local homeschool list. I mentioned it to the girls.  Both wanted to go.  We<br/>
wrote up some notes together and typed them up and both girls followed<br/>
through with the presentation. (at the last minute I wasn&#39;t sure it was<br/>
going to work and the cat shit in the crate in the van and got some on him,<br/>
but hey.  LOL!)   It was a homeschool event, but we knew NO ONE there.  I<br/>
was so proud of them for stepping outside their comfort zone and both girls<br/>
were very proud of themselves.  It is a fond memory to them and they hope<br/>
someone makes another pet show this fall.  If no one does, maybe we will<br/>
host the event.<br/>

 <br/>
I would suggest books (look for some historically based novels for kids on<br/>
the era that interests him.)  or going to events that you can watch instead<br/>
of being forced to participate in.   My kids like historical things but<br/>
still don&#39;t want to participate in most things.  This weekend we went to a<br/>
Native American Pow Wow and we just observed the music and dancing and<br/>
looked in all the little booths that were selling things.  They had a dance<br/>
for children where they threw candy and toys in a big circle and the kids<br/>
were suppose to dance until the music stopped and then they could pick up<br/>
candy.  The kids enjoyed watching, but didn&#39;t want to participate.  That was<br/>
fine with me. <br/>
 <br/>
You could also try to make homemade period items or find out how kids lived<br/>
in those times.<br/>

things.  <br/>
 <br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, he will be missing things.  He&#39;ll miss being forced to participate in<br/>
things that he doesn&#39;t want to, for his own good.  Don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>
Really!<br/>

 For example, the typical schooled child will begin on a T-ball or <br/>
little league team (my son also loves baseball, when played by *his* rules <br/>
with Mom & Dad) at, what, age 5 or 6? So if my son is not comfortable <br/>
participating on a team until he&#39;s 10 - how will we find a &quot;place&quot; for him <br/>
since he has not started on the same level? <br/>
--------------------------------------- <br/>
 <br/>
My kids like to play wiffle ball and for the last couple of springs we&#39;ve<br/>
written a note to a local homeschool list that we will be at the park with<br/>
balls, bats, and plates at such and such a time, if anyone wants to join us.<br/>
We&#39;ve had good luck with this and everyone has like playing with our relaxed<br/>
rules  (OK, no rules)  The kids hit the ball and run the bases and field<br/>
balls, if there are enough kids.    It&#39;s fun. <br/>
 <br/>
Relax and enjoy your little boy.  :0)<br/>

things: fly tying, flint knapping, archery, lapidary, traditional story<br/>
telling, metal working, SCA, trapping (boy, I look back and cringe at<br/>
how violent I seem to have been!)  Somehow, my parents managed to find<br/>
people willing to relate to this random kid (me) about most of these<br/>
things.  My dad found a blacksmith that was willing to let me come see<br/>
his forge and taught me some basics of using one.  Also found an old guy<br/>
in the area that was a fur trapper who let me come over and see how it<br/>
worked and stuff, got me going on that for awhile.  A friends dad took<br/>
us both to learn sword and dagger fighting from an SCA guy, and found a<br/>
cool teenage juggler who we learned juggling stuff from.  My aunt and<br/>
uncle found someone who chipped arrowheads that I got to learn that<br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
My point is, none of these were classes, just finding people with the<br/>
right skills who were willing to share.  In that kind of situation it&#39;s<br/>
much less &quot;weird&quot; for you and your son to learn them together.  And if<br/>
your son can form a real relationship (not just a teacher/student one)<br/>
with the expert then maybe he would ultimately feel more comfortable<br/>
working with them alone?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really know how my parents did it; I&#39;m not that good at finding<br/>
and befriending random strangers.  But it sure made my life cool that my<br/>
parents could!<br/>

Good luck,<br/>

Why not pick up some fantasy roleplaying games for your computer, some neat related library books and videos, some middle ages looking stuff  (swords, armour) in the halloween aisles, some related toys and anything else he can explore on his own or with you? I was like him as a young child. Going to school, pushing me into lessons, all it did as far as I&#39;m concerned was help delay my social development until I was out of high school where I could finally aproach things on my own terms. Pushing someone into something they don&#39;t want to do just causes them to dig in their heels. Let him decide when he&#39;s ready. He&#39;s obviously not yet. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-598751746">You&#39;ve already gotten a lot of great advice, but I<br/>
couldn&#39;t resist!<br/>
<br/>
I have a 5.5 year old daughter who has been raised<br/>
*very* attached.  Still co-sleeping, nursed for years,<br/>
etc.  About six months ago, all on her own, she went<br/>
from being by my side 24/7 to sleepovers at Grandma&#39;s<br/>
and friend&#39;s houses.  I am so happy when I see her<br/>
smiling as she goes off into new territory.  I am<br/>
happy because it has been on her terms and she&#39;s<br/>
proud.<br/>
<br/>
We tried T-ball for one (half) day.  We tried it<br/>
because we had moved to a new neighborhood, and the<br/>
park is a block from our house.  Sophia wanted to take<br/>
it...just for the outfit.  Before the coach even<br/>
started to make it fun, he listed all the rules.  It<br/>
was awful.  It would have been awful for me, and it<br/>
definitely was for her.  She was done after batting<br/>
once and we never looked back.  Classes don&#39;t make<br/>
things fun.  She, by the way, likes to play ball in<br/>
our backyard once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is important to remember, too, that there<br/>
is not much *real* interacting in a social way at<br/>
those types of classes.  There is one teacher who<br/>
cannot by available in a real one-on-one relationship<br/>
with each child, and there are a bunch of kids who are<br/>
not allowed to talk to each other.  &quot;We are here to<br/>
play ball!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On another note, though, maybe you could invite<br/>
someone to your home, as a dinner guest, who shares<br/>
interests with your son.  It is not a class.  But I&#39;m<br/>
sure a lot (more) could be learned that way.  Also, a<br/>
lot of teachers would let you sit in on a class, if<br/>
there&#39;s a class your son wants, especially if you<br/>
volunteer to help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488686975">Gosh, I live in such a bubble, I think, LOL! It&#39;s hard for me to imagine kids of this age running out wanting to do things away from parents (though I&#39;m sure some do).  I just think it is so completely normal for kids that are 5-6-7 yrs old to be hesitant to do classes, group activites, ect. without mom (or even with sometimes). Especially the oldest child.<br/>
 <br/>
My 7 yo just started dance last year, and really loves it. She waited until she felt comfortable going &quot;to a class&quot; (as she says) even though she talked about &quot;dance class&quot; since she was 4 or 5. <br/>
 <br/>
My 5 (almost 5.5) yr old son says he wants to try soccer this fall. He&#39;s not a group kid at all, and is not sure about all of the rules. I assured him if he wasn&#39;t comfortable, for whatever reason, then he doesn&#39;t have to go. We&#39;ll see what he thinks of it, but honestly I&#39;m surprised he&#39;s wanting to do it. I think seeing his sister go to &quot;classes&quot; is pushing him along a bit sooner.<br/>
 <br/>
So, anyway, it all sounds very normal to me...for whatever that&#39;s worth ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357156120">My son (now 10) was similar to your son when he was younger.  He watched <br/>
for a long time as other kids joined classes and away-from-home<br/>
activities like swimming lessons, soccer, gymnastics & baseball.<br/>
He just wasn&#39;t interested.  He preferred playing with friends or doing<br/>
family activities.  So we found things we could do together:<br/>
<br/>
Playtime with friends<br/>
Children&#39;s theater performances<br/>
Visits to the zoo, science center, children&#39;s museums<br/>
Family swims at the local pool<br/>
Family whale watching trips<br/>
Building model rockets and setting up an annual &quot;rocket day&quot; event<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until my son was seven that he was interested in a gymnastics<br/>
class, but only after watching two friends in this class for about a<br/>
year.  He started with a once a week class and then added another when<br/>
he was ready.  Quite a while later we joined a family unicycling club.<br/>
<br/>
He loved playing baseball at the park, but didn&#39;t want to play on a<br/>
team until he was nine years old.  Then he was ready, and he loved it.<br/>
It didn&#39;t take very long to learn the basic team skills because he was<br/>
really interested and serious about playing ball.   The coach really<br/>
liked his hard work and good attitude.  Many of the other kids seemed<br/>
bored and not very motivated to learn to play the game well.  I think it<br/>
was just one more activity among many for them to attend.  If your son<br/>
is interested in these types of activities, he&#39;ll come to them in his<br/>
own good time.<br/>
<br/>
Happy mothering,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255762696">When you think of all the little ones that prefer not to do things in classes or groups of &quot;strangers&quot;-( In my own and own extended family this is  pretty common -<br/>
Just think of all those little 5 yr old Kindergarten kids that are made to go off to school every day. Mine included. Which is why we smartened up with our ggd&#39;s and took them out of Kindergarten  half way thru the year. <br/>
They however  did ask for and enjoy some group sports (very laid back small  fun groups ) when  we were always there.This was at about age 6.<br/>
They have always been free to come back to us  or leave if they werent in the mood.<br/>
Their schooled cousins  never wanted to do other  activitys at that age. School was enough for them  then.<br/>
We took their mother to playschool because  we thought she need to &quot;play&quot; with other kids. She was so shy and only played  near them. We thought we were doing the best thing for her. How stupid was that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853123038">&quot;I am Shannon, dh Paul, and ds<br/>
Logan who will be 6 in November. And we have a baby girl due any day <br/>
now!<br/>
We live in northwest NJ, very close to Easton, PA.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Shannon. :)  I am just a little bit less than 2 hours from <br/>
Easton.  I have 2 unschooled boys, ages 5 and 7 (as well as an 11 yo <br/>
daughter).  If you would like to get together with an unschooling <br/>
family sometime, I&#39;d love to do that.  Email me privately if you&#39;re <br/>
interested. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sheran@...">sheran@...</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;My son is quite attached to Mom & Dad. He has no interest in <br/>
participating<br/>
in any type of class, sport team, instruction, etc, unless I am right <br/>
by<br/>
his side.  We have tried a couple trial classes (in things that he <br/>
seems to<br/>
truly enjoy such as tae kwon do and gymanstics), and he typically <br/>
lays on<br/>
the floor and cries. He will not &quot;line up&quot; or do what the other kids <br/>
are<br/>
doing or follow the instructor.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are like that too.  At 5 my oldest boy did swimming lessons <br/>
(his older sister was doing them, so I asked if he wanted to try a <br/>
class too).  He wouldn&#39;t go in the water without me, which was <br/>
accepted by the swimming class at that age.  But even with me, he <br/>
refused to participate with the rest of the class (especially when it <br/>
involved the instructor trying to get him to go with her!)  So Matt <br/>
and I went off to our own little section of the pool each day and <br/>
played around in the water by ourselves.  At 6 he signed up for <br/>
soccer (his idea) because he thought it looked fun.  Then we got <br/>
there and he realized that I wouldn&#39;t be playing &quot;with&quot; him.  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t a mom and son soccer team and he wouldn&#39;t do it.  He wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even go out on the field for practices unless I did it with him.  He <br/>
quit soccer.  Then at 7 he became interested in karate.  I called <br/>
around to all the martial arts schools within a reasonable distance <br/>
to see if they offer any type of family class where parents/siblings <br/>
can take together but the closest I could find was a school that said <br/>
parents can be right there watching.  We went to a trial lesson.  He <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go out on the floor and wasn&#39;t interested in going back <br/>
there again because he didn&#39;t like that they kept encouraging him to <br/>
go out on the floor and try it out.  He hasn&#39;t tried anything else in <br/>
the way of organized classes and activities, but even at park dates <br/>
with other homeschoolers, we&#39;re not often the family with the mom <br/>
sitting talking to other parents watching the kids play.  We&#39;re the <br/>
family with the mom playing with the kids because my kids don&#39;t want <br/>
to go over to the slide or the swings unless I&#39;m *right* there with <br/>
them.   <br/>
<br/>
My daughter was/is like this too, and at 11 she&#39;s starting to not <br/>
need me so much.  She IS very discriminating as far as what <br/>
activities she chooses to participate in but when she really wants to <br/>
do something, she&#39;s okay leaving me.  So that gives me some comfort <br/>
with my boys because I&#39;m seeing first hand that it really doesn&#39;t <br/>
last forever. :) <br/>

the other kids in the class were doing everything just the way it was <br/>

looked at kids running around doing whatever little dance they were <br/>
supposed to be doing and thought, &quot;Well, yeah, I guess it is kind of <br/>
stupid!&quot;   When the kindermusik teacher says, &quot;March to the music <br/>

question marching to the music while waving their scarves in the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too.  Yikes!  I&#39;m not really extroverted but I do like to get out <br/>
much more than my boys do...as I read your post I got to thinking...I <br/>
think I need to be extra careful that I&#39;m accepting of their desire <br/>
to not leave the house a whole lot.  I certainly don&#39;t want to make <br/>
them feel bad about it.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband has the exact same personality.  He&#39;s most happy at home, <br/>
and doesn&#39;t even like going shopping.  But it&#39;s easy to accept him--<br/>
if I want to go somewhere and he doesn&#39;t, I just go without him.  <br/>
It&#39;s not so easy with little boys who cry, &quot;But I don&#39;t want you to <br/>
leave me&quot; at the mention of me going somewhere. <br/>
<br/>
For our family too, I think that the &quot;not going anywhere&quot; has maybe <br/>
been part of the deschooling process.  I used to do school at home <br/>
with Alisha, and although we didn&#39;t do lots of textbook/workbook <br/>
stuff, I controlled what we did VERY much.  Lots of hands-on, trip <br/>
type stuff that she *had* to do because of unit studies I had <br/>
designed.  And even though Matt was little, he got drug to a lot of <br/>
that stuff.  The feeling of &quot;we have to go on another educational <br/>
trip&quot; was in the air all too often in those days. :(  So now, freedom <br/>
to my daughter means being free to stay home.  Classes just don&#39;t <br/>
seem appealing to her--and she&#39;s been free for several years now.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; And keep repeating the quote about education not being &quot;filling a <br/>
&gt; pail&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s not the lighting of a fire either.  The fire&#39;s <br/>
already lit.  We just need to make sure nothing does anything to put <br/>
the fire out. <br/>

<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just too soon for him to feel safe without you nearby. You are<br/>
doing the right thing by honoring his needs and fears. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn started a loving, gentle modern dance class when she was 3. For the<br/>
first year I pretty much had to sit in view of her at the top of the stairs.<br/>
I tried to honor the teacher&#39;s idea that there be no audience - to encourage<br/>
free expression - by reading a book with my back to the class, but I was<br/>
still there for Jayn to run over and get a kissy at will. This year we have<br/>
progressed to me being downstairs in the living room, again contrary to the<br/>
teacher&#39;s preference for her home not to be a waiting room - but she sees<br/>
that Jayn needs to know I am accessible to her so that she will dance<br/>
happily. This teacher really is a treasure, and the kids just adore her.<br/>
Finding the right teacher is one part of the equation. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that Jayn was very sensitive to was large, echo filled indoor<br/>
spaces with crowds of noisy people, especially if she was &quot;required&quot; to be<br/>
sitting (egs: cinemas, theaters, halls, churches) - she would become very<br/>
scared and clingy, and would cry to leave. She seems to have gotten over<br/>
that to a great degree - I believe in part because I never pushed her to<br/>
stay in any of these types of places when she was nervous. I always left<br/>
immediately with her. Perhaps your son has some of the same reactions to the<br/>
sound of crowds.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My family tells me it is &quot;unhealthy&quot; for him to be with me (or Dad) all<br/>
the time and he needs to be able to interact with others and follow<br/>
instruction from others.  I do not agree with this, but on some level it<br/>
does eat away at me deep inside. I was in every class imaginable as a child<br/>
and I think it is hard for me to understand how he could not want to<br/>
participate in these types of things. But I have realized that I need to<br/>
accept his personality and find ways to work WITH it, not against it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes. The little drips of poison that our other family members sometimes<br/>
manage to insert into our thinking at times. Flush them out if you can. Here<br/>
you are surrounded metaphorically by people who totally reject that notion<br/>
of it being &quot;unhealthy&quot; to meet your little child&#39;s needs for parental<br/>
contact. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Following Instructions&quot; is a schoolthink criterion of success. In a few<br/>
years your boy will be playing PS2 games with the best of them, and<br/>
following all the instructions he needs to in order to advance up the<br/>
levels, or solve the puzzle or whatever game type excites him. Consider that<br/>
he is learning to trust his own judgment and to be discerning in his choice<br/>
of leaders and mentors - an ability that may save his life one day.<br/>
<br/>
My mother does the &quot;poison zinger&quot; sometimes - she doesn&#39;t see it as a<br/>
negative action. She believes she is trying to help, but lives by a whole<br/>
different paradigm of parenting and love relationships.<br/>
<br/>
What works with my mother is to find some article, usually on the internet,<br/>
written by a source that she respects, and send it to her. My mother<br/>
respects authority, especially medical doctors. Therefore for her I will<br/>
send information from the American Academy of Pediatrics website, rather<br/>
than say, Mothering Magazine. Many times the information is essentially the<br/>
same. Perhaps you can find a source that your relatives will respect for<br/>
some Attachment Parenting information, and that will quiet them down on this<br/>
pushing independence issue. <br/>
<br/>
Further to your own spiritual growth as a parent, you might re-examine<br/>
whether you truly wanted to be in all the classes you were in as a child,<br/>
and what function they served for you.  Maybe you were looking for approval<br/>
or validation. In my case, being somewhere other than with my mother was my<br/>
goal in many of the extra classes and after-school clubs I did when young.<br/>
Did you really have a choice about the extra classes? Maybe you really did<br/>
want to be there and thrived on them - were you not quite 6 years old at<br/>
that time, or are you recalling your feelings at a later age? Are you having<br/>
regrets that your son seems temperamentally very different from you or from<br/>
your expectations? Sometimes having an expectation is the surest way to a<br/>
disappointment. I&#39;m NOT looking for a report here, unless you have some<br/>
epiphany you want to share, just suggesting some ideas to help you find more<br/>
empathy for your son&#39;s emotional reactions to the places you have tried. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So my question is - does anyone have any advice on how to work with this<br/>
<br/>
personality style?  I can see clearly what he is interested in, but quite <br/>
often I just don&#39;t know how to further his learning without looking for <br/>
&quot;outside&quot; help (class, etc.)  For example, he is extremely interested in <br/>
medieval living, especially the fighting. (And I have read with great <br/>
interest the recent thread on SCA.) I suggested a fencing class or getting <br/>
involved in a Ren Faire. He tells me very bluntly that he will only do it <br/>
if I do it with him.  OK, but it&#39;s not that easy to find this type of <br/>
scenario. Most will expect the children to participate with other children <br/>
- not adults.  Am I just looking in the wrong places?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have done fencing as part of an acting class, and I really enjoyed it -<br/>
but I was an adult. The teacher was formerly the coach of the Australian<br/>
Olympic fencing team. It was very physically demanding, very intense and<br/>
there are mesh masks and padding to be worn that *could* be intimidating or<br/>
claustrophobic for a little fellow. For beginners it can be very formalized.<br/>
I think first watch some classes from a safe distance, to discover if he<br/>
wants to pursue this. <br/>
<br/>
My first thoughts when I read he is interested in medieval living are:<br/>
movies, the History Channel, computer games, the internet, local museums and<br/>
picture books. So immediately assuming a class or group activity is the<br/>
FIRST option does suggest to me that yes you are looking in the wrong places<br/>
- and making more work for yourself. With Jayn, I usually start slowly when<br/>
she starts expressing some interest. Rather than &quot;getting involved&quot; with a<br/>
Ren. Faire, what about just attending one in your area. I would suggest to<br/>
you that you release this emphasis on &quot;working&quot; with his personality (you<br/>
use that word more than once), and just enjoy yourselves as much as possible<br/>
doing anything you both find fun.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I know that he will not be &quot;hanging on my leg&quot; when he is 16 years old.<br/>
I cherish the fact that he wants to be with me now. But the part of me that <br/>
is &quot;schooled&quot; is concerned that he may be missing his chance for many <br/>
things. For example, the typical schooled child will begin on a T-ball or <br/>
little league team (my son also loves baseball, when played by *his* rules <br/>
with Mom & Dad) at, what, age 5 or 6? So if my son is not comfortable <br/>
participating on a team until he&#39;s 10 - how will we find a &quot;place&quot; for him <br/>
since he has not started on the same level?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your son may never want to participate in a team sport. It is not a<br/>
mandatory rite of passage. Really. If he is enjoying the physical games with<br/>
you and dh, then that is great. He will come to want other friends too. He<br/>
really will.<br/>
<br/>
There are &quot;play for fun&quot; groups for different sports, and homeschool teams<br/>
all over the place with different levels of commitment asked that start at<br/>
all kinds of ages. Some, but not all, are serious competitive teams moving<br/>
in the same leagues as school teams. Someone at a local University in my<br/>
area has a semi-organized soccer playing session once a week for little<br/>
kids, with the emphasis on enjoyment well attended by members of my<br/>
homeschool group. Jayn sometimes expresses an interest, but not enough to<br/>
overcome the unfortunate scheduling of the event at 10AM.<br/>
<br/>
As for missing his chance, it is true that there are some things that *seem*<br/>
to require a very young start to reach the absolute pinnacle of it. Olympic<br/>
gymnastics for girls and being a prima ballerina come to mind at once. There<br/>
seems, and maybe I&#39;m wrong, to be a lot more age leeway for boys in the same<br/>
sports - possibly because many of the sports for boys place more emphasis on<br/>
strength and less on suppleness, and boys just keep getting bigger and<br/>
stronger as they age and do their sport. <br/>
<br/>
However watching the Olympics, and some of the historical sports shows<br/>
around them, I notice there are plenty of stories of successful athletes who<br/>
&quot;beat the odds&quot; starting in their sport in their early teens, or after some<br/>
injury or illness pushed them out of some other sport. And this is at the<br/>
top levels of these sports, a long way from neighborhood leagues or the<br/>
office team getting together to noodle around with a basketball for fun on<br/>
the weekend. <br/>
<br/>
I would guess that enthusiasm and willingness to practice probably go a long<br/>
way with most coaches. Other people will have more experience than I do. I<br/>
wonder how many of these little schooled boys would rather be playing a<br/>
loving, happy game using their own rules with Mom and Dad, instead of the<br/>
high pressure of Little League.<br/>
