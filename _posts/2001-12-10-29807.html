<br/>
I just used it, the Boston accent thing, because it best describes the letters he didn&#39;t pronounce and others that he pronounced in his own way. He might have said &quot;bued&quot; instead of &quot;bird&quot; or &quot;muver&quot; instead of &quot;mother&quot;, that kind of thing. This made it impossible for him to use phonics to learn how to read words. He speaks clearly now, he&#39;s 12, and has almost lost the&quot;accent&quot; completely. He can read well but he still has some trouble working out a new word phonetically. He uses a variety of other clues including letter blends and sounds to decode language on his own. I always give him the word immediately if he asks for it, I never push him to work it out, assuming that he&#39;s tried it and that by the time he&#39;s asking me he&#39;s anxious to get the information. The same with spelling, if they ask for a word spelled correctly, I give it to them, I don&#39;t insist on watching them grope for it or making them work for it. I find that this approach, far from slowing they&#39;re development, encourages them to read and write more. If I put them through their paces with, &quot;sound it out&quot;, or &quot;look it up&quot;, the next thing I know their watching TV or doing something else.<br/>
