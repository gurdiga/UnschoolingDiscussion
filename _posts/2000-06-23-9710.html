With looking at bringing a school age child home by the end of the summer, I am going to have to kick my but in gear as far as academics.  With the fact that DSHS will be scrutinizing her progress and that she is coming from the PS Institutions I will probably need to begin more formally with her and ease into more Unschooling as she is ready and the system backs off.<br/>

Starting off with a unit studies approach would probably be a good<br/>
start.<br/>
Least offensive/stressful to the child and it keeps DSHS happy because<br/>
......... * it looks structured and full of routines*.<br/>
We started out this way our first year of hs&#39;ing because our kids were<br/>
used to the PS way of doing things. Within a year we were starting to<br/>
become unschoolers.<br/>
