<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858801982">Hi Becky,<br/>
My children are 7 and 3.  Unschooling for us is just an extension of how<br/>
were were/are when they are preschoolers.  I tried some sit-at-the-table<br/>
kind of stuff last year with my 7yr old, he hated it.<br/>
<br/>
I used Ruth Beechick&#39;s little books and BOB books to get us started when he<br/>
was learning to read.  Once he grasped some of it I moved on to more<br/>
interesting books.  He picks his own books now and reads at about 4th grade<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
We cook together, interact in the grocery store (which is<br/>
cheapest/largest/best buy...what&#39;s the good date on that yogurt...etc),<br/>
paint, color, walk in the woods, play, play, play.  My kids love any game in<br/>
which they use their imaginations and/or dressing up.  Imaginative play is<br/>
everything, even when they are playing playmobile or building with blocks.<br/>
<br/>
We do watch some tv, some educational, some just for fun, but it&#39;s not the<br/>
focus of our day.  We also do chores together and have a weekly playgroup<br/>
with a few other families.  We garden, do yardwork, shop.  Just daily stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you have specific questions/concerns, please ask.   Hope this gets you<br/>
started!<br/>
