<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005050615">.  Can people be creative enough to come<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; up with a better kind of discipline if they really love their children?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Better as in how?  Usually when one wants something better it is because the<br/>
old method doesn&#39;t work.  Spanking does work when it is applied with love.<br/>
Spanking because the parent is angry and it is the last resort does not<br/>
work.  I have found that spanking works very well for young children.  You<br/>
can take any type of correction and make it abusive if the motive is wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193841518">Welcome Vivian. I quite agree with you. I learned that spanking just made me feel guilty and my daughter more rebellious. What I do now is revoke priveleges when she does misbehave after several warnings. So far...I think she is still testing herself more than me since she has only been out of ps for 12 weeks.<br/>

  Chris, <br/>
  I consider myself pro-life, but wrestle with the spanking issue.  <br/>
<br/>
  As I understand those who espouse what they believe to be &quot;Biblical&quot; spanking, it resembles NOTHING of the spanking I&#39;ve heard described on this list.  It is not used carte blanche for any perceived transgression or innocent childhood mishap such as spilling milk.  For those who practice Biblical spanking as I&#39;ve heard described, the result is not the same as for those who spank in anger (which seems to be the common experience of those on the list who were spanked).<br/>
<br/>
  Back to your comments.  Although I consider myself pro-life, I respect that the laws in the U.S. allow choice to others. It would be my sincere hope that others would choose life for the unborn, vice termination of life.   <br/>
<br/>
  I hope we can have meaningful and respectful dialoge on this topic as I have the same curiosity as you.  May we all learn something from each other the ensuing discussion.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718862161">I used to spank mine, wish I never did, but I did. At the time it seemed <br/>
like the thing to do as I was raised that way. I started reading book after <br/>
book and found new and better ways (for us), to raise our children.<br/>
I feel everyone is different and everyone has a different view on <br/>
everything. I respect all life. I dont condemn or ridcule or judge anyones <br/>
choices, I am not in thier shoes and do not know thier circumstances so how <br/>
can I say what they should or should not do. Raising children can be very <br/>
complicated, but I do so enjoy mine immensely!! I have no label I put upon <br/>
myself, and I dont put labels on people. We are complicated and our ideas <br/>
and thoughts are our own, no one needs to agree but should try to respect <br/>
our individualism.<br/>
Hope this makes sense and if not well I am good at that :) (confusing the <br/>
heck outta people,I have a hard time expressing my words).<br/>

&gt;to determine which violent acts are acceptable and which ones are not?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For those who are Christians, the answers would seem pretty easy; all<br/>
&gt;life is to be respected and violent acts of any kind are<br/>
&gt;unacceptable.  For non-Christians, I&#39;m not quite sure what<br/>
&gt;the &quot;guidelines&quot; may be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m hoping that many of you will continue to enlighten me with a<br/>
&gt;bigger picture of what you find acceptable and why.  I know that<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759290904">I don&#39;t understand the lines you draw here.  I know a<br/>
lot of pro-choice christians.  Even pro-choice<br/>
christian ministers.  Not all christians agree that a<br/>
zygote, for instance, has a soul...<br/>
<br/>
And certainly many christians feel justified in<br/>
committing violence, even doing so supposedly in the<br/>
name of God.  The examples are numerous and obvious. <br/>
<br/>
So you can&#39;t make the *assumption* that the two<br/>
automatically go together. Which doesn&#39;t mean that you<br/>
can&#39;t make a logical argument that they *should*.  I<br/>
can, of course, understand perfectly if you are<br/>
assuming a more &#39;in a perfect world, following the<br/>
teachings of Christ, respect for all life should be<br/>
strictly adhered to, and I and the Pope agree that<br/>
this includes non-born life, and that is why I am a<br/>
fruitarian&#39; point of view.  And of course an<br/>
anti-spanking philosophy would be in keeping with that<br/>
philosophy... <br/>
<br/>
Most Jewish people I know are both pro-choice and<br/>
extremely respectful of life... their definition of<br/>
&#39;life&#39; as being &#39;born&#39; has to do with their<br/>
interpretation of sacred text, having to do with the<br/>
moment the soul enters the body.  I think<br/>
Scientologists have a belief on this score, and I&#39;m<br/>
sure other religions (and cultures) have their various<br/>
interpretations of when a person is a person.<br/>
<br/>
As is my common annoying practice, I tend to get<br/>
frustrated with the black and white, winner take all<br/>
attitude that so frequently dominates nearly all<br/>
discussions on the subject of abortion.  I understand<br/>
that there is an inherent dichotomy between the belief<br/>
that *all* life (or perhaps all human life, includint<br/>
the unborn) is sacred and therefore deserving of<br/>
protected status, and the belief that human life does<br/>
not start until a certain point of gestation and that<br/>
up until that point it is *not* protected.  What<br/>
frustrates me is the disrespectful attitudes that each<br/>
side takes towards the other, as though there is no<br/>
way in which the other side could possibly *sincerely*<br/>
hold their opinion and so all discussion tends to<br/>
devolve to name calling and snorting and rolling of<br/>
eyes at best, and projectiles at worst.  I think that<br/>
it should be at least possible to come to some sort of<br/>
compromise legislatively, such as is often hammered<br/>
out in custody cases, in which nobody is happy but<br/>
nobody is totally miserable either... but I<br/>
unfortunately think it&#39;s unlikely that will happen. <br/>

&gt;   Chris, <br/>
&gt;   I consider myself pro-life, but wrestle with the<br/>
&gt; spanking issue.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   As I understand those who espouse what they<br/>
&gt; believe to be &quot;Biblical&quot; spanking, it resembles<br/>
&gt; NOTHING of the spanking I&#39;ve heard described on this<br/>
&gt; list.  It is not used carte blanche for any<br/>
&gt; perceived transgression or innocent childhood mishap<br/>
&gt; such as spilling milk.  For those who practice<br/>
&gt; Biblical spanking as I&#39;ve heard described, the<br/>
&gt; result is not the same as for those who spank in<br/>
&gt; anger (which seems to be the common experience of<br/>
&gt; those on the list who were spanked).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Back to your comments.  Although I consider myself<br/>
&gt; pro-life, I respect that the laws in the U.S. allow<br/>
&gt; choice to others. It would be my sincere hope that<br/>
&gt; others would choose life for the unborn, vice<br/>
&gt; termination of life.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I hope we can have meaningful and respectful<br/>
&gt; dialoge on this topic as I have the same curiosity<br/>
&gt; as you.  May we all learn something from each other<br/>
&gt; the ensuing discussion.<br/>

&gt; Could you list the states please? I think there are &gt;some of us who would want<br/>
to know.<br/>
<br/>
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,<br/>
Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North<br/>
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,<br/>
Wyoming.<br/>
<br/>
Within these states, some districts may prohibit corporal punishment as a local<br/>
option.   It is my understanding that even in states that prohibit corporal<br/>
punishment in public schools,  that private schools are still permitted to use<br/>
instruments to discipline students......the assumption being that parents<br/>
approve when they enroll the child.<br/>

Many folks here feel strongly that spanking is truly against unschooling.<br/>
Perhaps you disagree, but I hope that you will read with an open mind and<br/>
open heart.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Christian, and have never felt that being spanked made it any easier for<br/>
me to obey God.  There are other options.  You might be truly thrilled at<br/>
what you could have -- your child&#39;s trust, not fear.  There&#39;s a big<br/>
difference between obedience and trust.<br/>

  From: Valerie <br/>
  I didn&#39;t think there would be a person here that agreed that hitting <br/>
  your child to make him obey (or for any other reason) wasn&#39;t abusive <br/>
  or hurtful. Unschoolers distinguish themselves from the majority in <br/>
  many ways. My hopes are that they will be seen as peaceful and <br/>
  nonviolent parents. Nipping spanking in the bud as an acceptable <br/>
  aspect of parenting is high on the list of unschoolers that I&#39;ve <br/>
  been in contact with. As many have said, there is a better and more <br/>
  respectful way to treat a child. <br/>
<br/>
  love, Valerie<br/>

Tonight I accidently got into the June 2000 archives and found the <br/>
exchange below.  In addition to posts like the recent one above, I <br/>
now have a better idea why the long-termers on this list sound so <br/>
blunt about the topic of spanking.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;As far as who is disrupting the list, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the people <br/>
 who are brave enough to stick up for their right to discipline their <br/>
 children according to their own consciences, I think it&#39;s the handful <br/>
 of people who reply with cold meanness.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Brave? It&#39;s sure brave to hit a helpless child. Yeah sure.<br/>
<br/>
Cold meanness? Like hitting a child? Hmmmm.....<br/>

You can show us how YOU get your point across then.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re trying to show people how we don&#39;t spank and still have great, <br/>
cooperative kids.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m showing how I voluntarily help other people figure out what <br/>
unschooling is and how it works.  And if you or anyone wants to tell me <br/>
exactly how to do that, I guess you need to offer me some money and have me <br/>
sign a contract that says that your money is worth me changing my &quot;tune&quot; <br/>
(melody, rhythm or volume).  As long as I&#39;m a volunteer, I&#39;ll volunteer the <br/>
way I want to. <br/>
<br/>
We could be so gentle that it takes people ten years to understand <br/>
unschooling, but kid are growing up quickly all around us, and even <br/>
school-at-home has to be overcome and undone before unschooling will work.  <br/>
So time is important.  <br/>

tonight doing some girl time and she has been reading with me. And we have <br/>
been talking about all the spanking posts and our own issues with it, in the <br/>
past. She says she will send you her $7.34 if it will help you keep on doing <br/>
what you do, just the way you do it. &lt;g&gt; (gonna have to have a talk about <br/>
*literal* with the girl!)<br/>

drugs, etc., etc., is because of too much spanking. All those kids learned <br/>
their parents couldn&#39;t be trusted to accept and help with the small stuff <br/>
when they were kids. And since they were spanked for the small stuff, what <br/>
are Mom and Dad gonna do now that drugs and sex are in the mix? Ship them off <br/>
to one of those wilderness boot camps? <br/>
