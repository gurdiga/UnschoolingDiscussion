That was my hope; that I could help save some other people some time.  I have <br/>
enough experience filling out REAL Financial Aid forms, going to the library <br/>
(ahhh, yes, we used to have to do that) combing through the many manuals that <br/>
listed various scholarships based on various needs, ethnic backgrounds, <br/>
interests, etc.) that I KNOW this is a rip off.  NEVER, EVER PAY FOR what IS FREE!  <br/>
Glad to have helped.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone needs help w/this, please give me a holler!  I&#39;m VERY EXPERIENCED <br/>
(more than I want to be) in this area; and, LOL, I won&#39;t charge you a thing!  <br/>

As I was reading your post, I was thinking boy would I like to pick her<br/>
brain and get some tips!!! Then you volunteered!!<br/>
If you could e-mail me privately with any info I would be so appreciative.<br/>
This whole college thing is so new and confusing to me as far as what has to<br/>
be done. Not at all like when I was going. I feel ancient. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
