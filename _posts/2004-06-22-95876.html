<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100412829">Glena&#39;s example of a new baseball glove made me think of the old song &quot;Cat&#39;s<br/>
in the Cradle&quot; by Harry Chapin.  The dad bought the boy a new baseball<br/>
glove, but then never had time to play catch with him - too busy making<br/>
money.  That song has always made me cry, even before I had kids.  Over the<br/>
years I&#39;ve tried to keep its message in mind, so have bought special things<br/>
or classes  for the kids when we had the money but also tried hard to spend<br/>
much time with them.  Really that&#39;s the reason we began homeschooling - to<br/>
have  more time with our children so that they wouldn&#39;t become grown and<br/>
gone, strangers to us.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion also reminded me of the poem about &quot;Handprints on the Wall.&quot;<br/>
Same idea - other things can become so important to parents that they stop<br/>
seeing their children.  A clean house becomes priority over the spending<br/>
time together and having fun, enjoying our children while they&#39;re home with<br/>
us (or later when they come back to visit).<br/>

Just back from a five day visit to MIL.  We stayed at a hotel.  Half hour <br/>
away.  Too much trouble for all of us to be at her house.  For HER.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to have to clean up after any one.  She wants her house to look perfect <br/>
in case someone drops by... HELLO, we are dropping by... about once a year <br/>
lately is all...<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t want anyone to eat there because a meal for that MANY makes too <br/>
much of a mess, so &quot;try to get something to eat before you come over&quot; is what <br/>
we hear.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad.  I would be APPALLED if my children ever came home to visit from a <br/>
many hours drive and stayed in a hotel.  I would be shocked if they ate <br/>
elsewhere while home visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago or so we visited and when we got over there, the kids saw piles <br/>
and piles of pretty pink and yellow and blue cupcakes sitting all over the <br/>
counters.  Of course they ask their Granny if they can have one.  She said NO, <br/>
they are for my Sunday School class tomorrow, I like to spoil them.<br/>
<br/>
I had to try to come up with an explanation as to why Granny doesn&#39;t like to <br/>
spoil them.  There were more than enough cupcakes btw, I think she just wanted <br/>
even the very young of the family to know their place in her life.<br/>
<br/>
Now they know it well.  She&#39;s taught them they don&#39;t matter to her.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter so much to them after twenty some years or so of being taught that.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s very sad.  Things being more important than people.   <br/>
<br/>
I figure one day I&#39;ll have plenty of time to clean and paint and redo the <br/>
house if that&#39;s what I really want to do, right now time with my children is <br/>
limited.  One day they will have SO that occupy their world full time.  Now I&#39;m <br/>
just happy they choose to be with me and around me.<br/>
