&lt;&lt; wow!that sounds great!we&#39;d love to do things like that but we  don&#39;t have <br/>
a farm or know anybody with animals.maybe that&#39;s why unschooling would be <br/>
harder for me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, if that were true I&#39;d be in big trouble since I&#39;m in the middle of <br/>
Chicago! <br/>

&lt;last night the girls & i were putting sea salt on each others feet & inside <br/>
the jar was a seashell & they wanted to know all about them,so i said we&#39;d <br/>
got to the library to get books on them,but if i could go to a beach & they <br/>
could see seashells,i think they would learn much more than from a book.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably some day they will go to the beach. It doesn&#39;t have to be an <br/>
immediate connection to be of use. There&#39;s all kinds of learning, some is <br/>
hands-on, some comes from books - it&#39;s all good.<br/>
