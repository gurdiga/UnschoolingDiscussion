<div><font size="2">GM ingredients, are Genetically modified ingredients.....which 
means . I &#39;m not talking scientifically or anything, a gene of some other plant, 
animal, bacteria, or chemical has been spliced into the genes of a food plant, 
such as corn, wheat, rice,usually a mass, produced staple item.&nbsp; The 
purpose, (is what I found to be questioneable), is to prevent certain crop 
eating bugs from devouring a crop.&nbsp; (But from what I&#39;ve learned in Organic 
gardening studies is that bugs usual eat the weak plants in an environment, they 
prefer these less energy consuming foods, which is a benefit to the environment 
not to be wasting it&#39;s energy growing weaker plants, that are not likely to 
survive for generations to come..like a biological safeguard.)&nbsp; SO things 
such as BT, a chemical sprayed on crops to kill these bugs, rather than spray it 
on they splice it right into the genetics of a plant.&nbsp; They don&#39;t even 
bother to tell YOU it&#39;s safe...they just pass it on to the consumers.&nbsp; 
Never knowing , really, what will occur genetically, down the road....to the 
plants, bugs , or people.&nbsp; They figure this research, and study , and 
splicing and diceing is for the benefit of the environment, people, whomever, 
cause it allows us to mass produce,( even though we could already do 
that.)..bigger better, resistant foods, with MOre vitamins and MInerals, (and 
weird chalky tomatoes, Now have you ever seen a chalky</font><font size="2"> 
Roma...I never did..not before&nbsp; too long ago.)&nbsp; I am of the phylosophy 
that all that we need is all amoung us, their is an abundance of foods, ways to 
grow medicine for every person.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s that the resources have been 
seeped out of the earth in one place or another, and now there is little or 
nothing to live on while other parts of the globe, continue to experience, and 
abundance of foodsand resources, and continue to go about the use of them 
irresponsibly.&nbsp; Now ,I believe it is two ways of looking at things....the 
predominant way..in &quot;How&nbsp;can I control this, and make it do what I 
want?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the exchange way&nbsp; &quot;I will take only what I need, and 
I will leave&nbsp;enough to grow&quot;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What can I give you in 
exchange for your service,my time&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &quot;What can I give&nbsp;&quot;, 
where one party&#39;s efforts are a direct exchange of energy, and the use of that 
energy&nbsp;, such as food in a thankful way, after all , you would be likely to 
know where you got it from, and the time it took to become what it was, Was that 
time crammed ina small barn, poked and prodded for 2 years, and then sent all 
packaged , nicely to you...or did it roam ina field , grazing, with it&#39;s 
young?&nbsp; Which would I want to eat?&nbsp; The seed born out of lab , spliced 
witha gene, from something , totally foreign to it&#39;s natural state...or the 
grown from the seeds that have worked just dandy with Mother Nature for all 
these years , before this became some craze of control over the natural 
world.&nbsp; How can we use the resources wisely, instead of always needing to 
manipulate things?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, I&#39;m 
going on forever , now.....well the least they could do was inform me, of this 
altering of food genes, so I could decide for myself what I would or would not 
eat, not assuming for me that I would choose what they choose.I think it the 
responsibilty of those that offer products to the public of providing the 
knowledge of it&#39;s source, and any information, concerning it&#39;s manipulatiuon or 
altering from a natural state, all things I would Not know by looking at 
it.&nbsp; When I make something....it is the spirit inwhich it was 
created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle</font></div></html></div>
