<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948968252">Well, my daughter&#39;s off on her big solo adventure around the country. We took her to the Amtrak train depot last night to see her off--destination, Vancouver, BC.  Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
We were all brave and cheerful waiting in the depot. When the train arrived and she got on board, we remained brave and cheerful. It was a bit more difficult 10 minutes later when the doors closed and the whistle blew and her face in the window got smaller and smaller. I think if I let myself worry at all it would consume me, so I just keep projecting good, strong thoughts when I think about her.<br/>
