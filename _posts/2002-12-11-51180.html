<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993717046">We are fortunate to have wonderful family members who are very <br/>
supportive of our homeschooling. They even get unschooling, for <br/>
the most part. Occasionally my mom will say, &quot;How is Nick&#39;s <br/>
schoolwork going?&quot;, and I&#39;ll say, &quot;We don&#39;t do it that way.&quot; She <br/>
says, &quot;Oh, whatever. He&#39;s smart.&quot; However, I do have one SIL <br/>
who is very, shall we say, opinionated and pushy. We only see <br/>
one another about once a year, and I was dreading the day I was <br/>
going to have tell her we were homeschooling. I tried to imagine <br/>
all her many objections, thought about what to say, how to <br/>
handle her, etc. The day finally came; I was nervous. She looks <br/>
at Nick and says, &quot;Where do you go to school.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t; I <br/>
homeschool.&quot; OK, I&#39;m ready for her. She looks at me and says, <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s cheaper than private. Soooo, how&#39;s your sex life?&quot; WHOA! <br/>
Didn&#39;t see that one coming!<br/>
<br/>
We do have one phrase we use whenever people start to annoy <br/>
us with their unasked for opinions, courtesy of Larry from the <br/>
Three Stooges: &quot;I&#39;ll make a note of it.&quot; (I&#39;ve never had the nerve to <br/>
use Nick&#39;s favorite comeback to criticism: &quot;We can&#39;t help it; we&#39;re <br/>
morons.&quot;)<br/>

Marty has said (usually to homeschoolers, so far) &quot;How should I know?  I&#39;m <br/>
homeschooled.&quot;<br/>
