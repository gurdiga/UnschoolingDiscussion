I just spoke to Ken Ivey in Sales. There ARE rooms available! There are even <br/>
a few suites still available---but we didn&#39;t include them in the Live & Learn <br/>
block. If you WANT a suite, you must tell them that KEN said it was OK--to <br/>
include it in our block. If you have ANY trouble getting a reservation, <br/>
please ask to speak directly to Ken Ivey.<br/>

I just called and reserved a suite.  I was wondering what everyone was going<br/>
to do who had not yet reserved a room.  It didn&#39;t seem possible that they<br/>
would be out of rooms already.<br/>
