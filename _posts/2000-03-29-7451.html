&gt;i am just surprised that he is not right there with you doing these.  my <br/>
&gt;seven year old cooks and cleans with me (plus on her own when i am busy with <br/>
&gt;other things!  she has required chores and cooks for fun.)  to me it gives <br/>
&gt;the wrong message if one is sitting vegging while someone else is work, work, <br/>
&gt;working...  we are all a team, we have work to do, we can talk about what <br/>
&gt;game to play afterwards while we wash and dry these dishes.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, amazingly he has never been interested in anything around the house<br/>
like cleaning or cooking, even though he has seen his dad doing his share.<br/>
Even as a toddler, I tried to engage him in some of my household activities<br/>
but he never wanted to help, not even in food preparation. I have tried to<br/>
stress that everyone in the house has to take part in household upkeep,<br/>
even if it is just picking up one&#39;s own things, but without success. I just<br/>
keep working at it with different strategies. I&#39;m just having one of those<br/>
weeks when everyone else&#39;s parenting style looks better than mine. Does<br/>
anyone else ever feel like that? <br/>

April. The plugs came out of the TV today!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933003070">Olivia,  Not only have I experienced a less than wonderful week as a parent, <br/>
but it has been a rather bumpy month  for my oldest , & it has been difficult <br/>
at times to handle him.  As he nears his 6th b-day, he is becoming more <br/>
likely to challenge rules, and has begun being smart-alec at times,too.  He <br/>
does play with neighborhood kids, and I know he is &quot;trying on&quot; some other <br/>
peer behavior; I feel, however, I must remain consistent in what <br/>
is/isn&#39;tacceptable.  So, it is a &quot;rough patch&quot; that we are working through, <br/>
and it can be tiring.  That is partly why I sought out a list such as this, <br/>
because my confidence has been shaken at times, and it helps to know that you <br/>
are not &quot;the only one&quot; when dealing with something.  Hope next week is better <br/>
for you.                                                            Goodnight <br/>
all--   time to put the baby to bed.                                            <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947645753">karen and carol talked about finding moments for ourselves thruout the day, <br/>
this is true for me, too--  and susan said<br/>
&lt;&lt; imo when your lifestyle naturally<br/>
<br/>
makes you happy then you are naturally recharged. &gt;&gt;<br/>
i just wanted to agree that being happy with your lifestyle and direction <br/>
includes meeting your own needs as well as those around you.  what a relief <br/>
that not only are my kids and hubby&#39;s needs valid, but mine are too and we <br/>
all will flex for each other!!  that to me is what makes hmschling a <br/>
lifestyle choice.<br/>
