<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040766670">I hate to sound stupid but what are the GM ingredients?<br/>
I&#39;ll be stupid with you....   Yeah, what are they?<br/>
<br/>
GM is genetically modified.  I had heard that Frito-Lay was considering<br/>
not using GM foods in their products, so I contacted them and this was<br/>
their response.  Sus<br/>

Thank you for contacting Frito-Lay. We are always pleased when our<br/>
consumers<br/>
take the time to share their thoughts with us.<br/>
Now that there is a renewed interest in biotechnology by regulatory<br/>
agencies<br/>
and some consumer concern exists, we did not feel it appropriate to ask<br/>
our growers to include bt crops in what they sell us.<br/>
Just like other food companies, Frito-Lay relies on and supports the<br/>
regulatory<br/>
agencies charged with safeguarding our food supply when sourcing<br/>
ingredients<br/>
for our products. These agencies continue to report that genetically<br/>
modified<br/>
ingredients are perfectly safe.<br/>
Since we are also a large buyer of agricultural commodities, and more<br/>
than a<br/>
quarter of the North American crop is derived from biotechnology, just<br/>
like other food companies, we could have biotechnology ingredients in<br/>
our products.<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to contact Frito-Lay. We hope this<br/>
information<br/>
is helpful.<br/>
