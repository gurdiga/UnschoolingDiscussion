   &quot; I&#39;m remembering now that I had more than one friend who grew up to<br/>
embrace homosexuality (not unschoolers because I&#39;d never heard of unschoolers<br/>
back then - lol - just lesbians! Does that makes unschooling the more <br/>
extreme of<br/>
the two?)<br/>

        I know of nothing in the way they were parented or schooled that<br/>
either caused -- or would have prevented -- it.&quot;<br/>

One doesn&#39;t *embrace* homosexuality, unless you mean coming to terms with <br/>
the sexuality one has been born with. There is nothing a parent can do to <br/>
cause or prevent homosexuality.<br/>

I read this to mean that, beyong accepting it, they were enthusiastic. LOL<br/>
