&gt; LOL....got this off another list.<br/>
&gt; Lisa in Austin<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  A homeschooling Dad was being interviewed by a reporter<br/>
&gt; for a local<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  newspaper about homeschooling, and, of course, he was<br/>
&gt; asked what<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  providing socialization for his child, just like the<br/>
&gt; public schools<br/>
&gt; do?  <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  The Dad replied, &quot;That&#39;s not a problem.  Once a week, I<br/>
&gt; take him<br/>
&gt; into the<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  bathroom, beat him up, and steal his lunch money!&quot;<br/>
