&lt;&lt; I have always <br/>
 encouraged my children to speak their minds, even if what is <br/>
 coming out of their mouths may be insulting to me.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I encourage my oldest, and will with the youngest, to say what&#39;s going on <br/>
with them including their feelings and thoughts.  However that does not <br/>
include calling me names (which is unproductive and rude), shouting requests <br/>
across the room or generally not listening to me when I ask something of him <br/>
(eventually then).<br/>
<br/>
I believe it&#39;s important that Zak tells me what he&#39;s feeling and why and I <br/>
help him with that stuff.  When I see him frustrated I name that for him and <br/>
say &quot;looks like your feeling frustrated do you need my help&quot;  or &quot;how does <br/>
that make you feel&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes that&#39;s the difference between Zak saying &quot;but you told Debra that Grandma <br/>
would never go on a diet&quot; (in front of Grandma) (this is not something he&#39;s <br/>
actually said, I&#39;m just pulling something out of the air) in which case I <br/>
ought not to be gossiping and he&#39;s just caught me out.  That&#39;s sassy to me.  <br/>
As opposed to &quot;Your a pig and I&#39;m not doing anything you say because your an <br/>
idiot&quot;  that he&#39;s never said either and he would have had to hear that from <br/>
someone else to say that.  As Zak watches minimal TV (pretty much PBS and <br/>
Discovery, or tapes) he doesn&#39;t get that from the media... My husband never <br/>
speaks to me in that way and I don&#39;t associate with parents who are spoken to <br/>
like that and then their kids repeat it.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess the above is a very good definition of the difference between <br/>
being sassy and being rude.<br/>
