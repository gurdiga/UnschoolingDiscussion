<div id="ygrps-yiv-564774480">If you get anything with the words &quot;Snow White&quot; in either the subject line<br/>
or the attachment, DO NOT open/download it.  Someone who sends me email (I<br/>
don&#39;t know who it is yet) has this virus and inadvertently sends it to<br/>
everyone in the address book every time the email program(OE or Netscape) is<br/>
activated.  Fortunately, my virus scan caught this before it could do any<br/>
harm. The &quot;From&quot; line came only as &quot;Hahaha&quot;, which is why I can&#39;t tell who<br/>
it came from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048351602">I received this email. I have a mac so was not able to open it. I thought it<br/>
was an unsolicited sex<br/>
email. Is it? or is it a real virus containing email. Carol<br/>
