Do you enjoy the city? Is it cheaper to live? Is your house/appartment big <br/>
enough?<br/>
I have lived in both places so I can understand both.<br/>
What I wanted to say is if you don&#39;t like the city and if it is expensive can <br/>
you move?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love the big city, but I would also love to have a small farm and raise <br/>
goats some day.  (It&#39;s the suburbs I can&#39;t stand.)  Some cities, like Pittsburgh, <br/>
are very inexpensive, others, like DC or NYC, are ridiculously expensive.  <br/>
Within one region, living in a rowhouse and taking public transportation is <br/>
certainly cheaper than moving to some expensive suburb and buying an SUV for every <br/>
driver in the family.  But your question really needs to be a little more <br/>
specific.  Where would you like to move to?  What things are stopping you?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is just like something I would say.  Except that I love my particular <br/>
suburb.  It&#39;s a close in one, laid out in a city like fashion.  38 kids (we&#39;ll <br/>
add one in January) that all know each other on the block.  We are a real <br/>
community.  We can walk or ride our bikes almost anywhere in town, although we rely <br/>
on the car to get to outings and such.<br/>
<br/>
That said, the kids and I have asthma and are affected by ozone alert days.  <br/>
I&#39;d move just to get away from this.  I keep thinking that if the house <br/>
becomes too much for us we can move away from the city, the other direction from my <br/>
husband&#39;s job, live peacefully and make a mint off our home investment.  But <br/>
then I&#39;d give up my block..<br/>
<br/>
Guess I&#39;m a fence sitter.  there&#39;s always something more attractive somewhere <br/>
else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Elizabeth, think long and hard about it.  We did what you are thinking <br/>
about...except we move way the heck out in the boonies from Los Angeles County, CA.  <br/>
We have no immediate neighbors.  We left a block a lot like yours.  It was a <br/>
very mixed neighborhood, kids of every race imaginable, wonderfully diverse.  <br/>
TONS of kids.  We moved here about 5 years ago and although there are a lot of <br/>
plusses, we miss the whole &quot;neighborhood&quot; thing terribly.  I also miss that <br/>
there was SO MUCH to do in a city.  Everything is right at your fingertips.  <br/>
Here, we have to drive an hour to the nearest mall, 45 minutes to a movie <br/>
theater, and forget about museums and such.  The closest is probably 2 1/2 hours <br/>
away.  The kids also went through a big period of lonliness.  <br/>
<br/>
We love our life now, and have happily settled into it and can&#39;t imagine <br/>
pulling up roots again....but that being said, if I had it to do over again, <br/>
knowing what I know now, I probably would have stayed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-957944968">Don&#39;t forget smallish cities.  Our city of about 100,000 is halfway<br/>
between L.A. and San Jose, no big cities nearby.  Not a suburb, not the<br/>
boonies.  I love it!  We are within 10 minutes of the beach, lakes,<br/>
rivers, mountains, waterfalls, hot springs, forests.  We have libraries,<br/>
bookstores, arcades, mini-golf with go-carts, waterslides, skate parks,<br/>
roller rinks, the best professional theater this side of the country,<br/>
...  Did I mention mild weather all year long - lows in the 50s, highs<br/>
in the 80s, both are rare.  I love this area!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s really in the day dreaming phase right now.  those of you who live in <br/>
the country know better than I can imagine that a &quot;little farm&quot; with goats, <br/>
veggies, a kiln and a weaving room is a lot more work than sitting happily in an <br/>
urban environment!  <br/>
<br/>
Leaving our block would be horrible on us, even if we moved just a few blocks <br/>
down.  Leaving the area would be very difficult.  We went to the Field Museum <br/>
on a whim yesterday because my almost 4 wanted to see Sue!  (I mostly wanted <br/>
to go for the great a/c.)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the house across the street from me is being painted a <br/>
garrish yellow.  I&#39;ll get over it.  My senses are much more sensitive (?) when <br/>
I&#39;m pregnant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666530514">Well, I don&#39;t want to mention my specific city, but it&#39;s the Central<br/>
Coast area - San Luis Obispo, the 5 Cities, Santa Maria, Orcutt.  I<br/>
absolutely love it here.  Jobs are a little more scarce than in big<br/>
cities of course, but cost of living is much lower than the Bay Area for<br/>
sure.  Santa Maria is the cheapest, with houses in the 200s still,<br/>
though some people are snobbish about Santa Maria because it&#39;s more<br/>
agricultural (read: &quot;worse&quot; schools because of language issues, plenty<br/>
of field workers).  San Luis is more expensive, cheapest houses are<br/>
probably in the 500s.  It&#39;s a university town and people that live there<br/>
love it.  There&#39;s a very cute downtown, with a big ole Farmer&#39;s Market<br/>
every week that shuts down the area.  The 5 Cities are in between, beach<br/>
towns such as Shell Beach, Pismo Beach, Grover Beach, Oceano and Arroyo<br/>
Grande.  They are in between in price range also, and are right at the<br/>
beach.  They get pretty crowded during tourist attacks, especially<br/>
Pismo.<br/>
