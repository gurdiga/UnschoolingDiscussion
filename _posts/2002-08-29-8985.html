&gt; &gt;I found it an interesting site, but doubt I would participate :::shrug::: <br/>
&gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt;seemed (to me) to be a tad over the top. Although it was interesting to <br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt;there are scholarships specifically for the homeschooled student. I just<br/>
&gt; &gt;seems to be tailored for the traditional school-at-homer and specifically <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;religious school-at-homer. But then, I could have read the site in the <br/>
&gt; wrong<br/>
&gt; &gt;light.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well they certainly exclude gay people and anyone who isn&#39;t anti-gay, from <br/>
&gt; what I can tell.  That would be enough to keep this live-and-let-live <br/>
&gt; heterosexual from being involved.<br/>

I was getting tired of being oppressed anyway.  Hey, anything to help Julian <br/>
qualify for scholarships!<br/>
