I haven&#39;t met anybody IRL who speaks of having had them when &quot;older&quot;, so I<br/>
have no experience that it is harder, or easier, to deal with then.  And do<br/>
you mean harder for the parent or for the child?  Certainly it is harder for<br/>
parents of school age or daycare kids, because the parents miss work until<br/>
the child is better.<br/>

I had them when I was almost 30. Horrible, horrible! I don&#39;t remember ever <br/>
feeling so incredibly sick, totally apart from the itching.<br/>
