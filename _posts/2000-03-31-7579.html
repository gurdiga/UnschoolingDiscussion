 You mentioned trying to get pregnant for 7 years.  Though I know of<br/>
 several mild conditions that go undiagnosed and can affect fertility, I<br/>
 thought I&#39;d share a quick and easy experiment with you.  It took us 3<br/>
 years of solidly trying and being devoted to the calendar and cycles<br/>
 etc. for me to get pregnant.  A tip that a specialist offered me, as it<br/>
 had just appeared in a study documented in the Journal of Medicine, was<br/>
 taking a daily low-dose of Aspirin.  Heck, it can&#39;t really hurt to try,<br/>
 can it?  Apparently, there are many women who actually are conceiving<br/>
 but the uterine wall is hostile to implantation.  Either too thin or too<br/>
 thick for the newly-developing fetus to nestle in.  Aspirin, with its<br/>
 recognized blood-thinning abilities, can apparently solve a lot of those<br/>
 problems.  Meanwhile, many women don&#39;t even know they&#39;re pregnant<br/>
 because we miscarry so early we just assume it&#39;s a usual period.  As<br/>
 well, aspirin can also help keep the fallopian tubes free-flowing for<br/>
 the same reason.  There can be irregularities or inconsistencies that<br/>
 impede the process of ovulation.  Since I&#39;ve learned a bit about this<br/>
 and shared my info with others, 2 acquaintances have become pregnant. <br/>
 (I like to think this idea helped.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sonia, we had a very similar situation.  I had 4  miscarriages between my 2 <br/>
older daughters.  They found some ANA irregularities as well as a hormonal <br/>
imbalance.  I was on baby aspirin, progesterone and Clomid when I got <br/>
pregnant with my almost 7 year old.<br/>
<br/>
And then, out of the blue, we had a surprise baby at age 43!  :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434946855">Dear Jackie,                                                                    <br/>
    I was just reading the posts regarding infertility, and I want to share <br/>
that after I got married I was on the pill for about 6mos, but did not like <br/>
some aspects about it, so went off-- for the next 10 yrs, we never got <br/>
pregnant!  We adopted our oldest child in 1994, after going through the <br/>
pregnancy with the birth-mom.  We were not on a list or anything.  My husband <br/>
is a police officer;  One winter night while on duty he was flagged down by <br/>
this young girl whose car was broken down.  Unable to restart her car, he got <br/>
permission from his sgt. to drive her to her home .  On the way to her home <br/>
she explained that she was pregnant, and that she was planning on an <br/>
abortion.  She asked him if he was married, and if so, if we had children.  <br/>
He told her that we didn&#39;t, and she asked him if we would consider adopting <br/>
her baby, as she really didn&#39;t think she could really go through an abortion <br/>
(Thank God).  So, from that point, we went to all the prenatal appts., etc... <br/>
and we were in the delivery room on the big day!                                <br/>
                                        Seventeen mos later, I became <br/>
pregnant, and I was 31 years old, and married for over 10 yrs.  I firmly <br/>
believe God had a plan, and that I was not to become pregnant until my <br/>
adopted son came into my life first.  I still tear up as I relive all the <br/>
memories of how all this came to be.  It is such a blessing to become <br/>
parents, however it happens.  Well, anyway, I got to experience nursing with <br/>
my 2nd child, and he ended up nursing for about 2 yrs.  A month after he was <br/>
completely weaned, I got pregnant again!  Now I have my daughter, who is 6 <br/>
1/2 mos old.  I cannot express the gratitude I feel for being blessed so, and <br/>
who would have guessed this was to be for me-- the one who seemingly could <br/>
not become pregnant.  Please know that there is a plan for you ,too, and <br/>
while I&#39;m not trying to preach , I would like to say that place your faith in <br/>
God, and trust Him to take care of your needs.  He knows and loves you very <br/>
much!                                                           Karen -- <br/>
Grateful mom of 3  (My life changed so much-- we were duel-income-no-kids <br/>
&quot;dinks&quot;, then in 5 yrs. became parents 3 times over.  When it rains, it <br/>
pours!)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681240742">Sonia,<br/>
       Thank-you so much for taking the time to write!  I really appreciate <br/>
it.  It&#39;s funny, I have tried so many things, and then 4 months ago, I <br/>
decided I had had enough, and my dh and I started adoption proceedings!  <br/>
Well, since then,  I have gotten so much  new advice on enhancing fertility!  <br/>
It is almost funny!  Don&#39;t they say,  &quot;the minute you stop looking for <br/>
something, it finds you &quot;?  And, after some of the things I&#39;ve done, an <br/>
asprin-a-day is a walk in the park!  Thanks~~ jackie  <br/>
        [ We have decided to continue to try to conceive and continue the <br/>
adoption and see which one comes first!]</div>
