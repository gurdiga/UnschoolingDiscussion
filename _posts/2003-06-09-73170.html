time that they need.  Our neighbors babysat one for their friends, and they <br/>
REALLY need a lot of space and/or attention (like taking them out running on a <br/>
leash) to be happy.  <br/>

This is one reason I&#39;ve always liked mutts....they don&#39;t have one certain <br/>
characteristic bred into them that makes specialized care so necessary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not any more than any other breed really.  Out in the yard our Grey is a <br/>
&quot;fur blur&quot; when he first gets out there, but he&#39;s just as happy to lay <br/>
in a hole he dig in the middle of my lilies.   In the house..... snore <br/>
city.  In Greyhound circles they&#39;re called &quot;40 MPH Couch Potatoes&quot;. <br/>
 They don&#39;t need &quot;more&quot; room or exercise than other dogs though that&#39;s a <br/>
common misconception.<br/>

Retired and rescued Greyhounds don&#39;t really &quot;need&quot; to go out and run. They<br/>
are very happy couch potatoes who just like a walk every day.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yep. Mary&#39;s right.<br/>
&gt; They are big, lazy dogs that love to rest on a large pillow quite often. <br/>
&gt; Calm, clean and sweet, the perfect breed for us.<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t want to walk them EVER without a good leash though. If they see a <br/>
&gt; rabbit or squirrel.....well, I&#39;m sure you can imagine.  They&#39;ll run right in <br/>
&gt; front of a car without seeing it. <br/>
