 <br/>
After your last post, Julie, I was going to write back how MUCH you should  <br/>
have attended this year&#39;s conference. Teetering right there on the edge, you  <br/>
would have gotten a HUGE shove in the right direction. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you&#39;ll be able to make 2005. It&#39;ll be hosted by Ren Allen in  <br/>
Pensacola, FL. In October---not sure of the dates yet. Ren&#39;s signing contracts  as <br/>
soon as Frances blows over.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad for your breakthrough! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Now that so many people are interested in hosting the L&L conference, and<br/>
the fact that Kelly&#39;s missing her &quot;baby&quot; and wants to run another one, it<br/>
may not be in Columbus any time really soon, but I&#39;d still love to host one<br/>
some time.  Family Fun magazine&#39;s October issue just arrived (although I<br/>
don&#39;t know why, I never subscribed to it!) and they have an article about<br/>
Columbus, Ohio and what a great place it is for families.  They state that<br/>
half of the population of the United States lives within a 550 mile radius<br/>
of Columbus.  That would be very convenient for all those traveling<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Would people make two trips a year if there were spring and fall<br/>
conferences?  Hmmmmm.....<br/>
<br/>
Sang, are you on UnschoolersNetworkOhio or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:oh-homeschool@yahoogroups.com">oh-homeschool@yahoogroups.com</a> ?<br/>
We have monthly or bimonthly unschoolers&#39; get togethers here in Columbus and<br/>
announce them on these lists, as well as the local Columbus unschoolers<br/>
list.  Maybe you could make it to one sometime.<br/>

 <br/>
We&#39;re in the middle of this discussion right now----and may be for a while  <br/>
yet.<br/>
 <br/>
If I could wave my magic wand and set everything up &quot;just so&quot;, I would have  <br/>
the L&L appear every September or so (Aug to Nov) and to move around the  <br/>
country from east to west. That way everyone has a chance to &quot;get away&quot; with a  <br/>
relatively short trip/lower expenses at least every three-four years.<br/>
 <br/>
THEN, I would wave another wand to have mini-conferences show up all over  <br/>
the US in the spring, as a kind of shot in the arm half-way through the  year. <br/>
Pam Genant has pulled together a min-conference in Nov in NC----the  kind I&#39;m <br/>
talking about. One or two main speakers, with some locals taking on  their own <br/>
specialties. Funshops for the adults and kids, who should be  included, as <br/>
they are the reason we&#39;re doing this. Lots of time for socializing  and fun. (to <br/>
check this out, go to _www.NCUnschoolers.com_ (http://www.NCUnschoolers.com) )<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
THAT would be my ideal way for things to play out. <br/>
 <br/>
Things are a bit up in the air right now for 2005, as I haven&#39;t heard from  <br/>
Ren about the state of things in P&#39;cola. We&#39;ll let y&#39;all know as soon as we <br/>
know  something. We may be shaking things around if the news is bad. <br/>
 <br/>
I love the idea of more than one conference---and the bigger the L&L  gets, <br/>
the better breaking it up sounds! 573 is A LOT of people! But I&#39;m not yet  <br/>
willing to split in two. I think one big one and many little ones is good for  <br/>
right now. <br/>
 <br/>
What do y&#39;all think?<br/>

For my family, I had resigned myself eeking out enough money for one<br/>
vacation a year ~ Southern California to visit the in-laws.  This year, they<br/>
planned to visit us, so I took my vacation as the L&L conference.  We&#39;ve now<br/>
decided we NEED two vacations per year: one to the in-laws and a second to<br/>
L&L &lt;bwg&gt;  The best part of having one, big, national conference is the wide<br/>
variety of people who come from all over the country (& canada!!).  It&#39;s<br/>
worth every single mile in the van and every single peanut butter sammich to<br/>
afford it!!<br/>

We post the details on ColumbusMetroUnschoolers.  You can join the list even<br/>
if you don&#39;t live in Columbus.  It&#39;s pretty low volume.  We generally meet<br/>
once or twice a month at a coffee shop or restaurant just to talk<br/>
unschooling, which we&#39;ve found covers pretty much everything!<br/>

Too many lists. I think we discussed this on the L&L list. <br/>
 <br/>
But I think it would be a great idea if local groups would hold  <br/>
mini-conferences each spring and let the big L&L be in the late  summer/fall.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m hosting a funshop at next year&#39;s conference on hosting  conferences---all <br/>
the &quot;how to&#39;s&quot; and &quot;what to avoids&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
With 573 attendees this year, I worry that it might get TOOOO big.  Maybe we <br/>
will have to break it into two---but not yet.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m happy to discuss by phone how to get one off the ground. Just call me  to <br/>
walk you through and hold your hand.<br/>

Coast and I haven&#39;t been able to afford to travel that far yet.  I&#39;m in CA.<br/>
Yeah, we have the conference in Sacramento.  But so far it has always<br/>
conflicted with some engagement that I can&#39;t miss :(<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m totally in favor of having an East/West coast split on odd/even<br/>
years, and then I&#39;d love to see little events pop up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658508973">We love maps here too. I imagine you could do that on a website, <br/>
we&#39;re on a swap list for homeschoolers where we do a swap with a <br/>

nature walks, maps and a few brochures from the tourist information <br/>
place, and other little interesting things we think of. The whole <br/>
deal, including postage is supposed to cost no more than about $5. <br/>
It&#39;s fun, and we are learning where the states are on the big map <br/>
hanging in our living room as we get packages from different people. <br/>
We&#39;re all learning geography, just from having fun, and the kids love <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330332142">Unschooling in difficult states - we don&#39;t want to get too bogged down <br/>
with details of state laws, here, but I need some information from <br/>
people who are unschooling in states where regulation would seem to <br/>
require curriculum or other more traditional approaches.   I&#39;d like to <br/>
find out more about how you manage to unschool and still meet state <br/>
requirements.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you brought that up, I am curious about this myself.  This will be <br/>
our 1st &quot;official&quot; home/unschooling year.  We have always been at home except <br/>
for DS&#39;s small stint in daycare while I worked there as well and the same DS <br/>
was in Kindergarten last year, which was a pure waste of precious time and <br/>
energy.  Our 2 DS&#39;s (6 and 3) are happily home now and learning tons every day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in VA, which seems relatively strict.  We sent our Letter of Intent and <br/>
got a Letter of Approval.  I have a degree so that was all I really needed <br/>
there.  But I did have to provide a list of curriculum stuff that we&#39;d use.  I <br/>
have heard others say they will invalidate their results for the SOL&#39;s (I&#39;m not <br/>
sure how to do that) or take the tests for their kids or they take them <br/>
together and make it fun.  As for being assessed by a certified school teacher and <br/>
handing in portfolios, who knows?  I wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin finding a <br/>
teacher willing to &quot;assess&quot; an unschooled child and find anything positive.  <br/>
Portfolios of your child&#39;s work or journals made up in &quot;teacher lingo&quot; sounds <br/>
long, tedious, and highly &quot;schooly&quot;.  So I don&#39;t know how we&#39;ll meet the VA <br/>
requirements.  I have to choose a method, so it will be the testing.  It seems <br/>
the least intrusive (we can test at home with CAT and turn in only the Language <br/>
and Math results) but I don&#39;t know what to do about the actual testing.  I&#39;m <br/>
not big on being dishonest with it but I really don&#39;t want him to have to sit <br/>
and color in little dots for hours at the kitchen table either.  <br/>

  requirements.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; snip....<br/>
  ***** I live in PA, I know there are a few here in PA also. Compulsary age is 8-17, my oldest is 9 and this is our 2nd year to comply. You have to file a notarized affidavit and objectives. My objectives are very open and vague and state as interests the child numerous times.We are required to cover certain subjects in Elementary and Secondary years, and at least 180 days or 900/990 hours. We are to keep a log, a portfolio of samples and have an evaluation at the end of the year. The evaluator signs a letter that you put in your port to give to your district. There is testing in grades 3, 5 and 8. How I comply... I keep my &quot;log&quot; as a list of materials used, I write down websites, books, brochures, maps, cd-roms, games etc. that my son has used. He does generate a few writings here and there and pictures, I keep everything in a folder and then pick out a few to turn in. I do not require him to do anything, he knows the law and he knows if we missed something that we will just do something for the port. That hasn&#39;t happened yet, he has a broad range of interests and activites that could cover any subject. My son is not in a grade so we haven&#39;t tested, they haven&#39;t asked me yet but it&#39;s only our 2nd year. I tried not to be too long so if anyone has a question I&#39;ll try to answer. One more thing, all of the districts are not the same, some are friendly and some cause trouble it&#39;s very scary for some people.<br/>
