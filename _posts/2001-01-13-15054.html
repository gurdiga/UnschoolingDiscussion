&lt;&lt; I am currently waiting for 3 books by John Holt that I ordered this week.  <br/>
Anything by him and everything by him I understand is a must especially once <br/>
you have committed to the ideal. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Except, for friends who are still school-committed, the early Holt books <br/>
might give them the (dated, 1960s) hope that schools can be reformed.    So <br/>
go with the later Holt books if you&#39;re only going to recommend one or two.  <br/>
Teach Your Own, or Learning All the Time maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Men seem to like the Gutterson book, because of the tone in which it&#39;s <br/>
written.<br/>
The first John Taylor Gatto book is good for its shock value, in giving <br/>
people the idea about how bad schools can be.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer things written by homeschooling moms, myself.  Linda Dobson&#39;s <br/>
Homeschool Book of Answers is easy reading because you can skip all around, <br/>
and it has lots of homeschooling moms in there.  But I do know that <br/>
intellectual snobbery can make it way-beyond-easy to ignore &quot;housewives&quot; in <br/>
favor of certified teachers!  So for elitists with only ten minutes to <br/>
invest, I&#39;d go with Gatto.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d give them several online sites:  HEM&#39;s, Unschooling.com and the NHEN <br/>
intro page for sure.<br/>
