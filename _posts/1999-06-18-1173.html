<div id="ygrps-yiv-474890505">Hi, I&#39;m new to this on-line business, but I have kept up on the reading for<br/>
5 days!  I have hsed my two daughters for 5 years (that excluded 3 years in<br/>
Germany where hs is definitely illegal, but that&#39;s another story). They are<br/>
now aged 12 and 14.<br/>
<br/>
I left my wonderful hs support group last week feeling very discouraged and<br/>
numb. So many of the kids who are my oldest girl&#39;s age are going back to<br/>
school. If they are not returning to school they are becoming much more<br/>
structured in their learning in preparation for &quot;real life&quot; (as in<br/>
university or jobs).<br/>
<br/>
I rebel against that while at the same time I second-guess my gut reaction<br/>
that there has got to be a way to continue the way we have learned for 5<br/>
years (mostly unschooling with a little structure for math). I know that<br/>
there are others out there that have unschooled all they way through and<br/>
still &quot;made it&quot; in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone out there that can help an anxious mother over another<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are your kids wanting the structure too. if not then dont worry. They may<br/>
not be intersted in it at all. And if they really want to. well isnt that<br/>
the point of homeschooling. to me it is. the kids get to choose too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155659645">Hi Kathy,<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of teen unschoolers, as well as some who are adults or almost.<br/>
One of my best friends, Margaret, has been an unschooler for years and has<br/>
decided she&#39;d like to travel to various places of the world (she just got<br/>
back from France). Another person I know has been unschooled all his life<br/>
and is now doing professional webpage designing.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do believe there are ways to get a high school diploma and still<br/>
stick to the unschooling thing. I&#39;ve heard good things about clonlara (sp?),<br/>
which is a school that&#39;s supportive of the home/unschooling style -- I<br/>
believe you can get a diploma through there. Also, if your kids want to get<br/>
into college, they could take a GED test, which would be the equivalent of a<br/>
diploma.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since when is the school system like the real world?  How many people find<br/>
themselves in similar social situations in their adult life?  Even<br/>
university life is very unlike ps.  The people in universities range in<br/>
ages and life conditions (parents, working, fresh out of ps, etc) and are<br/>
there mostly because they want to be.  They have to pay for the privelege,<br/>
and the instructors are, for the most part, aware of this and treat their<br/>
students in an adult and respectful manner.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a job, or know of anyone who does, that is even remotely like<br/>
the situation in ps?  I don&#39;t think there are very many, if any at all.<br/>
Unless you are talking about people who hate their jobs and/or have bosses<br/>
who treat them as sub-human, (a line of conversation that is also currently<br/>
being bandied about here,) and do we really want our kids preparing for<br/>
THAT?  <br/>
<br/>
Still, that only covers parent-student relations, which as we all know are<br/>
only a fraction of the ps social curriculum.  How many people eat lunch<br/>
every day in a really bad cafateria with hundereds (or thousands) of<br/>
others, given a choice?  How many people even interact with those size<br/>
crowds on a daily basis if they are not celebrities, politicians, public<br/>
speakers or other minorities who make their living in the public eye?<br/>
Those professions are chosen, and they work with crowds because they love<br/>
the work, or because it is a symptom of the job that is unavoiable, and ps<br/>
cannot prepare you for that kind of exposure anyway.  Many people in those<br/>
professions (most of whom were educated in ps) crack under the pressure, or<br/>
are crucified by the public for their human failings.  <br/>
<br/>
I have heard the same arguments from friends about ps preparing you for<br/>
&quot;real life,&quot; and I would like to know HOW exactly it accomplishes this.<br/>
Does anyone know in what ways ps prepares you for the &quot;real world&quot;???  I<br/>
have a problem with those phrases too, &quot;real life&quot; and &quot;real world.&quot;<br/>
Public School, for almost everyone, even successful students, is one of the<br/>
hardest things they will ever do.  It is more stressful, degrading,<br/>
tiresome, tortuous, and emotionally battering than most things you will do<br/>
in life.  Is this supposed to be a trial by fire for our young, fragile and<br/>
impressionable kids?  Or are they supposed to come to expect this from the<br/>
rest of their &quot;real lives??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Please excuse the tirade, but we are in the middle of our adoption<br/>
homestudy paperwork and they keep asking us for essay answers on what our<br/>
philosphy and beliefs are on child rearing, education, and culture.  These<br/>
issues, while always important, are close to the surface for me right now,<br/>
and come welling up readily with the least provocation!  ;-)<br/>

My oldest daughters are almost 11 and 14.  I too believe strongly in <br/>
unschooling, but I understand what you&#39;re saying.  I also think &quot;outside <br/>
pressure&quot; increases at the high school level.  Most people I think accept <br/>
homeschooling in the early years but at high school most I think assume <br/>
&quot;well, of course you&#39;ll send them to school.&quot;  Again I believe that your <br/>
heart/intuition is telling you you&#39;re doing the right thing.  I know I am.  <br/>
My girls and I love being together (I have three younger kids, too) and this <br/>
time together will come to an end only too soon.  I hope this has helped.  <br/>
Maybe your girls would like penpals?  My girls I know would love to <br/>
correspond.  Let me know.  By the way, where are you from?  Have you ever <br/>
been to a Clonlara or GWS conference?  They are very affirming and <br/>
empowering.  Also Cafi Cohen&#39;s web site talks a lot about older kids.  Kimme</div>

<br/>
I think that your experience, with not finding many high school<br/>
aged homeschoolers much less unschoolers, is common.  There are<br/>
many reasons for this.  As phone contact for high school<br/>
homeschooling for my local support group (and mother of two high<br/>
school aged unschoolers myself) I have heard a lot of them.  One<br/>
thing that seems to loom largely in some parents mind in my<br/>
experience which no one else has touched on here is the issue of<br/>
high school credits.  Up until high school, parents can feel that<br/>
homeschooling is a year by year decision; if it doesn&#39;t work out,<br/>
they can always go back to school.  In my state, and I suspect<br/>
it&#39;s true in most states, high school is different.  The state<br/>
says they have to have a certain number of credits to graduate.<br/>
So, if there is any chance that the child might enter high school<br/>
at some point, there has to be some way to account for credits<br/>
earned or they will end up repeating the missed grades.  So,<br/>
parents may opt to send their kids to high school to avoid that<br/>
problem.  Or, they may chose to work with an umbrella school such<br/>
as Clonlara, Oak Meadow, and all the rest  to have documentation<br/>
of their child&#39;s work.  This generally leads to more structure.<br/>
Each family has to do what is right for them.<br/>
<br/>
But, you are not alone and there are others of us out here who<br/>
continue to successful unschool throughout the high school<br/>
years.  However, you are also not alone in finding it<br/>
increasingly difficult to find local, compatible families with<br/>
kids near your kids ages.  And we live in the middle of 5 million<br/>
people....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another issue no one has mentioned is college entrance.  There are quite a<br/>
number of colleges that also look at highschool GPA&#39;s to guage student<br/>
entrance qualifications.  There is also the fact that better highschools<br/>
have a number of sports and extra cirricular activities that kids may not<br/>
be able to participate in elsewhere.  For example:  School Newspapers,<br/>
Student Body government, Fencing Teams, School Dances, Use of lab<br/>
facitlities for Science projects, Photography Darkroom facilities, Drama<br/>
Club stage productions, Cheerleading Teams and competitions, Gymnastics<br/>
teams and competitions, Debate Teams, Football teams, Basketball teams, and<br/>
others I can&#39;t think of right now.  I realize that many of these might be<br/>
available in forms outside of school for those who live in larger areas.<br/>
But for those of you who, like me, live in a town of 40-50,000 or less the<br/>
options are limited and the one your child is interested in may not be<br/>
available anywhere besides school.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when my kids reach highschool we may be living in a larger city,<br/>
or there may be other options available here at that time, or they may not<br/>
be interested in any of the activities that they do not have access to.  So<br/>
I can&#39;t spend too much energy worrying about that now.  However, I am<br/>
wondering something.  I heard that kids are allowed to participate in<br/>
certain school activites in their district even if they are not enrolled in<br/>
the school system.  Anyone know some examples of what types of activities<br/>
kids are allowed to partake in?  Does this extend to the highschool level?<br/>
Obviously they could not be in Student Government, but what about School<br/>
Sports Teams, Cheerleading and dances?  It seems that these in particular<br/>
would be focused on the student body only.  I know that there are many<br/>
schools that do not allow non-students to go to dances at all, even as a<br/>
student&#39;s date, and I also know there there are some schools that do not<br/>
allow non-students on the school campus at all.  Anyone have any<br/>
information about this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t think high school GPAs are that important anymore,<br/>
unless they are going to a school that the particular college admission office<br/>
is familiar with.  Grade inflation and multiple grading systems (4 point<br/>
system? or 5 or 6 point system that they use around here?) makes GPAs often<br/>
meaningless for admissions folks.  DH serves on some admission committees for<br/>
professional students (post bachelor&#39;s degree) and they don&#39;t give too much<br/>
weight to GPAs because they really aren&#39;t comparable from school to school. The<br/>
board scores make more of an impact.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, my daughter was admitted to her first choice college on the<br/>
very day she took the SATs, so her scores weren&#39;t considered at all.  However,<br/>
she had interviewed and they knew she was a homeschooler.  The other colleges<br/>
that accepted her waited for her SAT scores.  But then she decided not to go to<br/>
college, but that&#39;s another story.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I work in an umbrella homeschool organization and we have enrollees from all <br/>
over the country (and world) for what is essentially a correspondence course <br/>
in our high school program.  Some of my students do take classes or <br/>
participate in activities at their local ps.  As far as I can tell, it&#39;s <br/>
entirely up to each district to decide whether they&#39;re going to allow it and <br/>
what exactly they&#39;ll allow.<br/>
<br/>
As to the other part of the discussion, I can tell you the reasons I hear <br/>
most often from parents who previously hs&#39;d entirely on their own (but they <br/>
are almost always hser&#39;s not unschoolers) as to why they decided to enroll <br/>
with us for high school:<br/>
1.  Wanting a transcript/grades from an outside source of classes (for <br/>
college)<br/>
2.  Feeling that their child(ren) need to be accountable to someone outside <br/>
the family<br/>
3.  Feeling unable to teach one or more classes (we don&#39;t teach in a <br/>
day-to-day sense, but we do evaluate work)<br/>
4.  Wanting a diploma (sometimes for college, but sometimes just because the <br/>
student wants a formal recognition)<br/>
<br/>
As to what colleges look for, that also seems to vary.  When parents ask me <br/>
about this, I always tell them to contact the colleges they&#39;re interested in <br/>
and ask.  <br/>
