<div id="ygrps-yiv-915469020">A connecting moment for me. I went to ask jeeves and entered science of <br/>
cake, found a link with a fun experiment suggesting you cook 4 cakes leaving <br/>
1 important ingredient out of 3 of them, then compare. Here is what the site <br/>
said about the science of baking:<br/>
<br/>
Heat helps some chemical reactions to occur as the cake bakes:<br/>
It helps baking powder produce tiny bubbles of gas making the cake light and <br/>
fluffy (this is called leavening).<br/>
<br/>
It causes protein from the egg to change and make the cake firm.<br/>
<br/>
Oil keeps the heat from drying out the cake.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know the answers, yet I can ask the question so the idea may be <br/>
pondered. Answers are just a fragment of what learning is about. Cooking, <br/>
experiencing, watching powder get wet, heating, seeing change, these <br/>
experiences are rich. Knowing why adds to the richness.<br/>
