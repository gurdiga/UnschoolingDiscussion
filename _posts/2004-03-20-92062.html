<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>19 Mar 2004, at  7:26pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216922419">I went through this with my daughter when she was 10.  (She is now 12, next week).  Then she read Heather&#39;s Hiking Hiatus and other neat things from that site, and suddenly she had a completely different idea of how she could spend her time.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I asked her if she still felt &quot;behind&quot; her friends.  She said &quot;a little, but I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;m enjoying myself&quot;. LOL.<br/>
<br/>
And just yesterday, one of her friends was over, who is 2 years younger.  When the friend couldn&#39;t figure out where &quot;half way between 1min and 2 min&quot; was on the microwave dial, my daughter was again affirmed that she wasn&#39;t missing anything by not being in school.<br/>
<br/>
My son, who is 15 went through it too.  For him it was around 12, 13.  Now at 15, he could care less about school.  Both of them say they&#39;d like to go to school, but only to &quot;hang out with their friends&quot;, not to learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
And its rubbing off on my youngest who will be 9 (thank goodness!!!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157242047">I definitely know about the &quot;hatred&quot; by 10th grade. My<br/>
oldest 2 are there -- and just like you said -- they<br/>
hate us, their teachers, the work, learning, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I have to tell them sometimes, when they have tons of<br/>
homework & projects, that most of it is busywork and<br/>
unnecessary. They want to know why I don&#39;t know some<br/>
of the answers to their problems -- I just tell them I<br/>
once learned it, but never had to use it so it went<br/>
away. <br/>
<br/>
They say &quot;Then why do we have to learn it, if we&#39;ll<br/>
never use it?&quot; I tell them &quot;that&#39;s public education<br/>
for you&quot; <br/>

<br/>
Holly has moments like that a lot, when she&#39;s relieved and kinda shocked at <br/>
what schoolkids DON&#39;T know, or are unwilling to even try to figure out.  &quot;They <br/>
haven&#39;t taught us that yet&quot; is just not a thought my kids have ever had. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We were at a birthday party at an arcade here called Nickel City.  All the <br/>
games use nickels and some of them give paper tickets the kids can trade in for <br/>
cheap prizes.   Holly brought her tickets over to the mom-table, where we were <br/>
hanging out talking, and I asked her if she wanted me to fold them.  She said <br/>
no, she&#39;d do it.  I would&#39;ve folded them by tens, and cut off by hundreds.  <br/>
Holly folded by sixes, and didn&#39;t cut off.   She can &quot;do sixes&quot; as easily as <br/>
she can do fives or tens.  &quot;Sixes&quot; were not a thing to do for me, when I was in <br/>
school.   Sixes were hard. But they&#39;re not for Holly, and that&#39;s good!  She&#39;ll <br/>
have dozens and a gross and all the angles of circles just as quick in her <br/>
head as I have tens and hundreds.  Probably quicker.  <br/>
<br/>
Nobody told her not to.<br/>
