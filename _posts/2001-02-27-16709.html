<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040351746">This sounds wonderful!  How depressing I&#39;m in Nebraska.  The only conference here is put on by the statement of faith-homeschooling organization who would never dream of bringing in anyone other than their own.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone experienced this where they live and how does one go about changing it?<br/>
