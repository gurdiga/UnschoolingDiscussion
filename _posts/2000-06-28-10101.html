<div id="ygrps-yiv-892043612">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just had to write and tell you all about our afternoon art project today!  <br/>
It is pouring out raining here so I decided for todays art project we would <br/>
try some &quot;rain painting&quot;.  To rain paint you put drops of food coloring on a <br/>
paper plate and go out into the rain with it and it supposedly makes a <br/>
beautiful picture.   WELL......we did end up with beautiful pictures and we <br/>
had fun too.  But leave it to me to pick a day when it is REALLY raining to <br/>
try this project.  Lili and I did our food coloring drops and headed out <br/>
into the downpour only to have the rain SPLASH food coloring all over <br/>
us!!!!!  Oh well, C&#39;est la vie.  &lt;grin&gt;  We had a lot of fun doing it but I <br/>
just thought you might be warned that if you should ever try this project to <br/>
wear clothes that you don&#39;t really care that much about and to be prepared <br/>
to do some scrubbing on your  skin when you are done!   Lili and I both look <br/>
like we caught some weird polkadot skin virus!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Holly<br/>
<br/>
ps....Just thought I&#39;d add that even though I ruined my favorite pair of <br/>
shorts....the ruined clothes were worth it!  Lili had so much fun!<br/>
