DRIVE YOUR KARMA -- CURB YOUR DOGMA<br/>
| Swami Beyondananada&#39;s Ten Guidelines for Enlightenment<br/>
|<br/>
| 1. Be a Fundamentalist -- ensure that the Fun always comes<br/>
| before the Mental. Realize that life is a situation comedy that<br/>
| will never be canceled.  A laugh track has been provided and<br/>
| the reason we are put in the material world is to get more<br/>
| material.  Have a good laughsitive twice a day, which will<br/>
| ensure regularity.<br/>
|<br/>
| 2. Remember that each of us has been given a special gift<br/>
| just for entering, so you are already a winner!<br/>
|<br/>
| 3. The most powerful tool on the planet today is Tell-A-Vision.<br/>
| That&#39;s where I tell a vision to you and you tell a vision to me.<br/>
| That way, if we don&#39;t like the programming we&#39;re getting, we<br/>
| can change the channel.<br/>
|<br/>
| 4. Life is like photography -- you use the negative to develop.<br/>
| No matter what adversity you face, be reassured: --The positive aspects<br/>
will be<br/>
| revealed with the BIG picture.<br/>
|<br/>
| 5. It is true: As we go through life thinking heavy thoughts,<br/>
| thought particles tend to get caught between the ears and<br/>
| cause a condition called &quot;truth decay&quot;. Be sure to use mental<br/>
| floss twice a day, and when you&#39;re tempted to practice &#39;tantrum<br/>
| yoga&#39;, remember what we teach in the Swami&#39;s Absurdiveness<br/>
| Training Class:  DON&#39;T GET EVEN, GET ODD.<br/>
|<br/>
| 6. If we want world peace, we must let go of our attachments<br/>
| and truly live like nomads. That&#39;s where I no mad at you and you<br/>
| no mad at me.  That way there&#39;ll surely be nomadness on the<br/>
| planet. Peace begins with each of us.  A little peace here, a little<br/>
| peace there. Pretty soon all the peaces will fit together to make<br/>
| one big peace everywhere.<br/>
|<br/>
| 7. I know great earth changes have been predicted for the<br/>
| future, so if you&#39;re looking to avoid earthquakes my advice is<br/>
| simple:  When you find a fault don&#39;t dwell on it.<br/>
|<br/>
| 8. There&#39;s no need to change the world. All we have to do is<br/>
| toilet train the world and we&#39;ll never have to change it again.<br/>
|<br/>
| 9. If you&#39;re looking for the key to the Universe I&#39;ve got some<br/>
| good news and some bad news. The bad news:  There is no<br/>
| key to the Universe.  The good news:   It was never locked.<br/>
|<br/>
| 10. Finally, everything I&#39;ve told you is channeled. That way, if<br/>
| you don&#39;t like it it&#39;s not my fault. But remember: Enlightenment<br/>
| is not a bureaucracy, so you don&#39;t have to go through channels.</div>
