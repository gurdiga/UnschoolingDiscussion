Yep!   Us too!<br/>
<br/>
I love candles, so we are always lighting them.   And they love <br/>
blowing them out.  So then we have to light them again.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 We were sitting out by the fire the other night and were discussing <br/>
the colors of the fire,  totally cool discussion!  Blues,  reds, <br/>
oranges.  Different levels of temperature.<br/>
<br/>
Yes,  we are pyros!<br/>

more &quot;stuff&quot; its burning up.  Blue flame is the most pure.. like from natural <br/>
gas.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we are pyros too.  :-)  My kids just about worship the flames.<br/>

<br/>
Yes,  we are pyros!&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Us too, My husabnd and I were always attracted to fire, and our kids like to go out and have their own little fires with sticks and stuff {and play with the candle wax}. Husband and I check on them at a distance yet give them all the freedom they need to feel independent and they tend to be exceptionally safety minded as a result.<br/>
Now my youngest abosolutely has to blow out ANY candle she sees. Not because she is scared, but because she sings her own happy birthday song and then blows it out. {this includes matches but we light one and then light the one she is holding-she doesn&#39;t like to light them}<br/>
Her version sung very fast<br/>
&quot;Happy Birthday to you, You look like a monkey and look like one too.&quot; &lt;blows out candle&gt; &quot;There&quot;  then &quot;I want to do another one&quot; LOL<br/>
Yes the whole family is pyromaniacs &lt;eg&gt; But I think since it wasn&#39;t forbidden there is no reason to hide {like my husband and I felt the need to do} and they are upfront and very safe when &quot;playing&quot; with fire.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076290168">Same here.  I&#39;ve always helped them play with fire and both, while little,<br/>
did NOT want to light the matches themselves.  Lanora, 12, has been lighting<br/>
matches for the past couple of years but Jonathan is still &quot;no way&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
They both know how fire works, how hot it is and how fast things burn.   I<br/>
did keep matches up high when Jonathan was tiny but don&#39;t anymore.  If I<br/>
forget to put them away he reminds me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738498443">We recently did the same thing. The kids just love lighting the candles and<br/>
especially putting the warm wax on their fingers. My kids even sat at the<br/>
table roasting marshmallows and deli meat over the candles.lol<br/>
