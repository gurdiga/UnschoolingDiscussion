<br/>
Once the baby is hooked on formula and the mother has lost her milk, she<br/>
will *have* to buy at least some formula.  She can&#39;t afford to buy enough,<br/>
but at least it means sales for the company.  They have to make up for the<br/>
increasing number of first world babies who are breastfed rather than bottle<br/>
fed.  It&#39;s much like targetting kids for cigarrette advertising to make up<br/>
for the older smokers quitting or dying of lung cancer  ..<br/>

<br/>
Tax breaks, payments from programs, someone else pays to get the formula <br/>
there?  <br/>
Government programs and tax money.    They don&#39;t make longterm money, they <br/>
take short-term benefit without regard to whether the moms made dependent on <br/>
formula can get enough to see them through or not.<br/>
<br/>
One story is about them shipping 50 lb sacks of powdered milk (I don&#39;t think <br/>
it was formula but might&#39;ve been) to someplace in Africa where people are <br/>
generally lactose intolerant anyway, and they used the powder to whitewash houses. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope they didn&#39;t end up with extra bugs or ants or environmental problems <br/>
because of that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150432122">For instance in the US you can use WIC if you are poor or not. One family can <br/>
make 40,000 a year and still qualify and wala formula free but paid to the <br/>
companies. They still make money poor or not in the US. <br/>
I have received free formula with all three of my children.  I was given <br/>
diaper bags at the hospital, medicine feeders with formula manufactures names on <br/>
them and cups.  The first baby I had the hospital pushed the formula and finger <br/>
geed my son without my permission. Nursing was very hard after that. With my <br/>
daughter they did the same while I slept. Both times they sent home formula <br/>
with me.<br/>
They dont push as much now and I actually choose a hospital that does not <br/>
push formula at all. They have someone come in twice a day to assist, they offer <br/>
creams, breast pads and even a foot massage its heaven to have a baby there.<br/>
<br/>
Im babbling but my point is that in the US WIC is offered to Moms with <br/>
children under 5 and if the child is under or over weight they qualify at times no <br/>
matter what the income.<br/>

<br/>
Me too.   One was a pretty gift box with a ribbon and everything.<br/>
I was given a full case of liquid formula once, like bottles you can just <br/>
screw the lid on and go.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly and I were going through some stuff to give away.  She has a <br/>
little diaper bag that had been in the bottom of my closet, and she looked at <br/>
it and decided to keep it.  It has an elasticized bottle-holding pocket on <br/>
the side, and we talked about what nursing moms can keep in those instead of <br/>
bottles.  As she messed with the fastener, I noticed the logo inside the bag:  <br/>
Enfamil.<br/>
