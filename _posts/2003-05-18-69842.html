<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380222335">With all the talk about those who don&#39;t post, I thought I&#39;d introduce myself as one of those non-posters, there-by removing myself from that catigory.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for about a month now and enjoy the list, though occationally do mass deletes to catch up.  That is the reason for my lack of posting.  I feel like I should be reading everything to make an informed decision before putting my 2 bits out there, but just don&#39;t always find the time to get through them all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m mom to a 5 year old and have intended not to send her to school nor do school at home sense she was about 2 and I discovered unschooling.  I first discovered Taking Children Seriously, which, while I think it&#39;s a nice ideal, I have some trouble with it.  My problem is if I&#39;m not meeting an ideal, I feel like a failure.  Anyway, I try my best to be respectful and thoughful toward Davan and try not to beat myself up too much.  Where I was trying to go with that was to say, it lead me toward unschooling, which is something I can work with and is a great way of life.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, though, that lately I&#39;ve been feeling like I am not patient and creative enough with problem solving with Davan.  We ended up having quite a bad seance at a store today.  I think Davan was hungry, which led to some of the difficulties, but it gets me so down when she ends up crying and angry and I end up angry and not the nicest of people in return.  Do any of you ever feel like you don&#39;t have enough patience for this job?  Sometimes I wonder about myself....<br/>
<br/>
So, here I am, and I imagine that now I&#39;ve broken the ice with my first post, there will be more to follow.  :)<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely!<br/>
Probably mostly.<br/>
I occasionally get it right, and it feels so good.<br/>
But, I really don&#39;t feel I meet my standards of what I &#39;should&#39; be, <br/>
too much of the time.   <br/>
Amazingly, my kids think I&#39;m awsome.  Amazingly, others think I&#39;m a <br/>
good mom.  <br/>
I&#39;m thinking, &quot;if they only knew....!&quot;<br/>
I just keep striving to be better.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you had a scene, not a seance, but hey... I better be careful <br/>
what I write! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have very often felt like I didn&#39;t have enough patience to be the kind of <br/>
mom I wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
But it turned out I had enough desire to be the kind of mom I wanted to be <br/>
that when I lost my patience I apologized and checked to see whether maybe <br/>
*I* was hungry  (often true) and tired and maybe getting sick.  When I had <br/>
three kids and the oldest was six, sometimes I didn&#39;t go too many hours in a <br/>
row without feeling like I wouldn&#39;t survive the day, or the night, or the <br/>
hour.  And here I am, in calmer waters, nobody in diapers, everybody can <br/>
read.  How did THAT happen??  One moment at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
Each moment has the potential to be better than the one before.  Some moments <br/>
aren&#39;t.  If most ARE, you&#39;re winning!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097381963">Re: One Lurker Says Hi<br/>
<br/>
Hi Lurker! :)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do any of you ever feel like you don&#39;t<br/>
have enough patience for this job?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh heavens yes!  This could not have come at a better time.  We are down to <br/>
the wire in finding a house.  The fridge AND the ac went out this week.  My <br/>
children learned how to unlock the front door and I don&#39;t have a way to get <br/>
to the store to get a Houdini-proof lock.  Yesterday, the kids and I walked <br/>
to McDonalds for a cool indoor break and a *cold* drink.  My dear sweet <br/>
Ethan decided to strip naked, including his dirty diaper, in the play-gym <br/>
and appeared from the slide in his birthday suit in front of about 20 <br/>
people.  I&#39;m trying to pack, find a house, give my husband directions in <br/>
Columbia, SC while being in Texas and not seeing all the streets he&#39;s seeing <br/>
on the map so feeling hopelessly lost even though I&#39;m the one at home, <br/>
reading the dang map!  I hate being hot.  Hot makes me incredibly cranky.  <br/>
Chloe has been screaming all day and the carpet in THREE rooms is soaking <br/>
wet because the ac flooded.  My husband will be home in three hours and the <br/>
house is a wreck.<br/>
<br/>
If it isn&#39;t obvious, I&#39;m feeling quite sorry for myself.   &lt;pitiful grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BUT, it&#39;s Sunday.   Nicholette got a phonics turbo blaster for her birthday <br/>
and she has been spelling words for me all day.  Lauren learned how to spell <br/>
ON and OFF and wrote it on a piece of paper, along with her name and a <br/>
beautiful picture and presented it to me as a gift.  I found myself thinking <br/>
how wonderful it is that we are unschoolers.  We had Nic&#39;s birthday party <br/>
today and my cousin was griping because tomorrow is a school day.  She&#39;s <br/>
been at camp all weekend and feels too tired to go back to school in the <br/>
morning.  She didn&#39;t feel like going home and reading for homework.  My kids <br/>
were doing it for fun!  For the excitement and joy of learning!  How blessed <br/>
we truly are!<br/>
<br/>
While cleaning out the laundry room cabinets (the equivilant of most <br/>
peoples&#39; &#39;junk drawers&#39; only 80 times as big) I found newborn pictures of <br/>
Chloe and the cutest picture of all the kids on hands and knees crawling <br/>
away from the camera in a long side-by-side line.  I hung my gift from <br/>
Laurie on the fridge to help me smile while going about my dreary business <br/>
at hand.  Instead of packing away the pictures of Chloe and the kids, I <br/>
grabbed a coke and took a break to remember the joy and peace of her birth <br/>
and what a fun day we had that day.  When I came in the house, Ethan was <br/>
sitting in the kitchen floor with empty cupcake papers and the salt and <br/>
pepper, making &#39;birthday cakes&#39;.  I had just mopped the kitchen floor.  I <br/>
just wanted to scream and cry.  Instead, I grabbed him and carried him off <br/>
to bed.  I sang him a soft song and rubbed his beautiful face until he fell <br/>
asleep.  For an hour, I went from room to room, carressing my sleeping <br/>
little angels.  Little by little my patience returned.  A wave of peace <br/>
washed over me.<br/>
<br/>
Our sheets still haven&#39;t made it into the washer.  The house is still a <br/>
mess.  But my kids are all sleeping peacefully.  I have a beautful picture <br/>
hanging on my fridge that no professional artist nor writer could ever <br/>
compare with.   There are no alarm clocks set, no homework due.  When the <br/>
kids wake up their Daddy will be home and they will scream with joy to see <br/>
him again.  And they will have all day to be with him and catch up on the <br/>
latest lost tooth, the birthday party he missed and tell him all the new <br/>
words they learned to spell.  He&#39;ll get to hear Chloe say Dada for the first <br/>
time with his own ears as the girls all sit around praising her as if she <br/>
were the smartest baby ever born.  He&#39;ll be gone again before week&#39;s end so <br/>
we have precious little time to savor with him.  I am thankful they are <br/>
home, were they belong, for if they were in school, they would miss these <br/>
beautiful moments.<br/>
<br/>
I can only say, look for every shining light in every day.  If there were no <br/>
sour, trying moments, what need would we have for patience?   Through trial <br/>
and error, we become better parents.  Better people.  If we can see the <br/>
light in the face of darkness we become more loving, patient and giving <br/>
individuals.   This job we women hold as mothers (among so many others) <br/>
makes us better people.  We are changing the world, not just for our <br/>
children but by them and through them.  Every life they touch is a <br/>
reflection of our own.    We are held accountable for every mistake we make <br/>
and thanked for far less than we deserve.  It IS the hardest job a woman <br/>
could ever have.   It is also the most rewarding.  If we can stop and find <br/>
even the smallest particle of hope, the slightest little reward, we somehow <br/>
find the patience to move on and in the process, we find new solutions, <br/>
better choices, and create happier lives.  We learn that our job pays better <br/>
than any check ever written.  We are paid in love, smiles, hugs and kisses, <br/>
and bright little eyes that sparkle with each new discovery.  But perhaps <br/>
even more valueable, our children look into *our* eyes for comfort and find <br/>
peace after a skinned toe, a broken toy or a love-torn heart.  It is a hard <br/>
job, but it is priceless.  Sometimes, we just need to reach out for a little <br/>
reminder. :)<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could offer you a cup overflowing with patience, but I haven&#39;t <br/>
found a vendor! LOL  Just breath, take that moment to find your shining <br/>
light and your cup will overflow!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, of course! Though my faults lie more with slothfulness. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps to not look at unschooling as the ideal we should be but as<br/>
the goal we should keep focused on. Rather than looking at a mistake and<br/>
beating ourselves up for what we should have done, we can look at it and<br/>
figure out how we could handle it better next time. It also helps to look at<br/>
the bigger picture. Rather than focusing on the scene and what you could<br/>
have done with the melt down, look at what you could have done to prevent<br/>
the melt down. Like maybe taking snacks with you, or give yourself<br/>
permission to stop and take a mall food break, or do smaller shopping trips,<br/>
or only shop when she can stay with someone else.<br/>
<br/>
It also helps to look at things through your children&#39;s eyes. A shopping<br/>
trip, though seemingly necessary and something *you* have to put up with, is<br/>
like being dragged by your husband to a stock car race where you have to sit<br/>
and &quot;behave&quot; for hours and hours. And you can&#39;t take a book. You can&#39;t<br/>
wander around. You need to just wait until he&#39;s done. And maybe he&#39;ll get<br/>
you a snack if he thinks you need it. And maybe he&#39;ll leave early if you<br/>
burst into tears. But maybe he&#39;ll just get angry.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what happened. But to our kids it can look that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449348802">Do I ever understand!! My kids are the same age and my 2 yo is my <br/>
challange.  I have realized alot since joining the list and have made <br/>
a few changes that have helped me.  He has a heck of a temper and <br/>
when he is mad he starts throwing his body around, throwing things of <br/>
tables, will NOT let you hold or console him and usually ends up <br/>
getting hurt in the process &lt;sigh&gt;.  I have made a huge effort lately <br/>
to really pay attention to his cues so things do not escalate and <br/>
that is helping alot.  I am also much more flexible with his <br/>
demands.  The other day he wanted juice, so I got a juice, still <br/>
moaning.  DO you want milk? okay, than a change of mind.  After a few <br/>
minutes of struggle he wanted a regular cup with ice tea like a big <br/>
boy..LOL!  Of course he spilled it a minute later..LOL!  I never <br/>
would have continued to figure out the problem in the past.  It took <br/>
less time then one of his tantrums and left an overall feeling of <br/>
peace.  Anyway, we still have some really difficult moments and I <br/>
feel tears come because I don&#39;t feel I handled it in the best way.  <br/>
At least our consciousness of the problem and desire to change are a <br/>
step in the right direction!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are older now, but I remember those days with great <br/>
affection.  I think little kids are amazing...older kids are cool, <br/>
too...but birth to 5 years old is probably my favorite &quot;fun&quot; time.  <br/>
That was the age when my girls thought it was so fabulous to have a <br/>
shopping list and a crayon to check off items, to give the cashier <br/>
the money, to put coins in a slot, to order the &quot;one pound of <br/>
virginia ham sliced thin&quot; - all in a rush - at the deli counter, <br/>
because she had been practicing it diligently on the way to the <br/>
supermarket, to seriously hand the bank teller the check and deposit <br/>
slip and tell him that we&#39;d like $100.00 in tens and a lollipop, <br/>
please.<br/>
<br/>
This was a fascinating world to my kids, and everything could be made <br/>
into an adventure for them.  I miss those days.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I tried to involve our kids in everything we did.  <br/>
Sometimes it meant that errands or chores took us twice as long, but <br/>
better that time spent enjoyably engaged with your child than dealing <br/>
with an frustrated, irascible child who will scream &quot;Noooooooooooo&quot; <br/>
in a piercing shriek that could shatter glass.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, though...we tried to make our young children feel that <br/>
they mattered; that their feelings and thoughts and needs were <br/>
important to us; that they were part of a wonderful thing called a <br/>
family.  This involvement, this partnership, we nurtured in as many <br/>
ways as possible...to the bewilderment of family and neighbors.  Just <br/>
a few years ago, when he was 6 years old, my now 10-year old son was <br/>
fascinated by planes and airports.  He thought the guys who guide the <br/>
planes waving those flags were just the coolest thing; so whenever we <br/>
were coming home and getting ready to drive the car into the <br/>
driveway, Robert would jump out of the car with his flags (from a <br/>
dollars store) and his headset (old clunky headset from my first <br/>
walkman), and would *guide* us into the driveway, flourishing his <br/>
flags in a mysterious hand signal that my husband intuitively <br/>
understood.  The neighbors would pause in their yard chores to <br/>
stare.  Honestly...I just miss those days so much.<br/>

  I have very often felt like I didn&#39;t have enough patience to be the kind of <br/>
  mom I wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
  But it turned out I had enough desire to be the kind of mom I wanted to be <br/>
  that when I lost my patience I apologized and checked to see whether maybe <br/>
  *I* was hungry  (often true) and tired and maybe getting sick.  When I had <br/>
  three kids and the oldest was six, sometimes I didn&#39;t go too many hours in a <br/>
  row without feeling like I wouldn&#39;t survive the day, or the night, or the <br/>
  hour.  And here I am, in calmer waters, nobody in diapers, everybody can <br/>
  read.  How did THAT happen??  One moment at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
  Each moment has the potential to be better than the one before.  Some moments <br/>
  aren&#39;t.  If most ARE, you&#39;re winning!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome Nicholina,<br/>
I&#39;m sure that all of us can relate to your post and to the situation. It<br/>
helps me to remember that even if I plan things well and try to account for<br/>
kids who are tired and hungry and bring along fun things for them to do,<br/>
sometimes for whatever reason, my kid or kids are just going to have a tough<br/>
time of things. Heck, sometimes even though my life is pretty darn good, *I*<br/>
have a tough time and do stupid things like pick a fight with my husband<br/>
over something silly. It doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t love him, it means I was<br/>
having  a hard day and didn&#39;t process is well. Same thing with my kids, and<br/>
I try to use forgiveness, both in their direction and in my own.<br/>
Patience is a tough one. I wasn&#39;t known as a patient person before having<br/>
kids, and it&#39;s been a work in progress over the years for me (I have a 6.and<br/>
a 3 year old). Right now when they&#39;re both fairly young and the littlest one<br/>
is still in that phase where things like &quot;I want yogurt to eat, no a<br/>
sandwich, no YOGURT, I said YOGURT!! No, I want to get MY OWN SPOON!!!!&quot; are<br/>
a minute-by-minute experience, my patience gets taken down to it&#39;s very end<br/>
at times. I&#39;m learning as we go to breathe deeply and let go, but there are<br/>
times when it all just mounts up. Of course, trying to get something done<br/>
like grocery shopping can really be a challenge.<br/>
Hang in there, none of us is perfect. We are all on the road to being more<br/>
patient, more trusting, more of the parents we want to be.<br/>
One thing that sometimes works for me when we go shopping is to have the<br/>
kids each bring along one thing, something small they can hold on to. I went<br/>
shopping with my 6 year old last night and he brought along one of his Lego<br/>
people, &quot;Cam&quot;. Well, the whole way through the store, Cam told me stories of<br/>
her adventures-- the time she fought the giant transforming Allosaurus, the<br/>
time she teamed up with the Bionicles to defeat the evil Makuta, the time<br/>
she and her partner (named &quot;Water&quot;) built a trap for the Skeletors, etc. I<br/>
don&#39;t think my son took a breath for the hour we were in the store. After<br/>
awhile, I looked up and realized that the people around us were smiling at<br/>
us, just to hear his enthusiasm and the stories he was telling, the detail,<br/>
how excited he was. It felt really good to just be there with my amazing,<br/>
inventive kid and have him bringing smiles not only to me, but to everyone<br/>
around us. To him, it was not another drudgery of a shopping trip, but an<br/>
hour where he got to talk to me for the whole time. He loved it! And I loved<br/>
the little things he did like asking the checkout lady for some stickers for<br/>
his little sister. Very thoughtful. So just that one act of suggesting he<br/>
bring a Lego person along transformed a trip from possibly dreadful to<br/>
magical.<br/>
Of course, some days nothing works, everything falls apart, the center<br/>
cannot hold, etc. and then we just have to practice forgiveness--to our<br/>
kids, to ourselves--and move on, hopefully learning something for next time.<br/>
<br/>

What &quot;job&quot; are speaking of? Being a mom or being a mom to unschooled kids?<br/>
Well either way, the wording of &quot;feel like I don&#39;t have enough patience&quot;<br/>
makes me feel like someone just wanted to call it a day and not go on<br/>
anymore. (with the job) I have never felt like that. I haven&#39;t felt like I<br/>
don&#39;t have &quot;enough&quot; patience. What I do feel at times is that I want and<br/>
need to be better at what I do. No, actually I always feel like I want to do<br/>
better. But I have never questioned why I do this or feel like I bit off<br/>
more than I can chew.<br/>

that they had set the alarm and that they don&#39;t just go back to sleep.  But <br/>
more and more, I keep secret that I&#39;m up or checking (I just listen for the <br/>
shower or for movement), and more and more I don&#39;t need to help at all!<br/>
<br/>
It probably sounds like science fiction, Maggy, but it&#39;s just RIGHT up the <br/>
road! (five and ten years...)<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I have very often felt like I didn&#39;t have enough patience to be the kind of <br/>
mom I wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
But it turned out I had enough desire to be the kind of mom I wanted to be <br/>
that when I lost my patience I apologized and checked to see whether maybe <br/>
*I* was hungry  (often true) and tired and maybe getting sick.  When I had <br/>
three kids and the oldest was six, sometimes I didn&#39;t go too many hours in a <br/>
row without feeling like I wouldn&#39;t survive the day, or the night, or the <br/>
hour.  And here I am, in calmer waters, nobody in diapers, everybody can <br/>
read.  How did THAT happen??  One moment at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
Each moment has the potential to be better than the one before.  Some moments <br/>
aren&#39;t.  If most ARE, you&#39;re winning!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that this really hit home for me. Jaiden and Avery are sick, I&#39;m getting sick, and Jason is in the middle of finals and about to start two more classes, so that hopefully he&#39;ll be able to go back to work in Aug. Patience has been in short supply around here. <br/>
<br/>
I just try to remember that if I&#39;m running out of patience with the kids, they must be running out of patience with me. And that I&#39;ve had many more years of experience dealing with loss of patience, so it&#39;s up to me to bring us all back to an okay place.<br/>
<br/>
Jaiden and I have started deep breathing when one or both of us is getting upset, tired, or unable to cope with the situation. It kinda like a signal to the others around us that we are trying to maintain and that we all need to work and changing the situation/environment. Maybe it time for a snack, or a walk, whatever we need to get us all back to a better place.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not perfect yet, It may never be perfect, but it is better than the meltdowns we were all going through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862700738">**I can&#39;t wait to meet you at the conference, anyone who can<br/>
manage 7 children and still be so calm and happy is worth meeting :)**<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Olga (and Kelly &lt;g&gt;)!  I can&#39;t wait to meet everyone, too!<br/>
<br/>
I hate to burst your bubble &lt;beg&gt; but I&#39;m NOT always calm.  A lot of times, <br/>
far from it.  But I am happy.  One of the hardest things I&#39;ve had to learn <br/>
as a mother is self-forgiveness.  When I began to give myself permission to <br/>
make mistakes and learned to forgive myself, I found it so much easier to <br/>
see those little moments that really are there everyday.  Life has been <br/>
throwing us some serious curve balls lately and we have all been pretty <br/>
miserable.  The only thing that has saved my sanity is that I remind myself <br/>
that this will pass.  Someday, we will have a house and everything will work <br/>
and we will use that time to fill ourselves with happiness and make it <br/>
through the next bump in the road.  Sometimes, they&#39;re mountains, sometimes <br/>
just a pebble or two. :)<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t be half the person or mother I am without self-forgiveness.  <br/>
Being here to know I&#39;m not alone is worth more than I could possibly put <br/>
into words!<br/>
<br/>

the way.  All boys.  I&#39;m in the &quot;Am I really gonna make it?&quot; stage.  Plus I<br/>
only dimly remember what it is like to have more than 10 minutes alone with<br/>
my husband.  Uhm, he&#39;s the tallest of the men in the house, right??  -sigh-<br/>
<br/>
I was once told by my step mom that life starts being &quot;normal&quot; again when<br/>
the kid is around 3.5 or 4.  I found that to be true with the first one, so<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that we hit that point when little no name is about that.  So,<br/>
say 4 years from now.  When they can all talk, go to the bathroom, put on<br/>
their own clothes, etc....<br/>

Oh, but some days that sounds soooooo far away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044864237">Hi Jennifer!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I snipped just a piece of your post (below) about your current stresses (and, boy, do I feel for you!) and I noticed that, even when you didn&#39;t feel very patient, you acted in a patient way.  With all that is going on in your life just now, I wanted to say kudos to you for not blowing up!<br/>
<br/>

  Hi Lurker! :)<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Do any of you ever feel like you don&#39;t<br/>
  have enough patience for this job?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  (snip) When I came in the house, Ethan was <br/>
  sitting in the kitchen floor with empty cupcake papers and the salt and <br/>
  pepper, making &#39;birthday cakes&#39;.  I had just mopped the kitchen floor.  I <br/>
  just wanted to scream and cry.  Instead, I grabbed him and carried him off <br/>
  to bed.  I sang him a soft song and rubbed his beautiful face until he fell <br/>
  asleep.  For an hour, I went from room to room, carressing my sleeping <br/>
  little angels.  Little by little my patience returned.  A wave of peace <br/>
  washed over me.  (snip)<br/>

&gt;&gt; Sometimes I wonder about myself....<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Yes, of course! Though my faults lie more with slothfulness. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I think it helps to not look at unschooling as the ideal we should be but as<br/>
&gt;the goal we should keep focused on. Rather than looking at a mistake and<br/>
&gt;beating ourselves up for what we should have done, we can look at it and<br/>
&gt;figure out how we could handle it better next time. It also helps to look at<br/>
&gt;the bigger picture. Rather than focusing on the scene and what you could<br/>
&gt;have done with the melt down, look at what you could have done to prevent<br/>
&gt;the melt down. Like maybe taking snacks with you, or give yourself<br/>
&gt;permission to stop and take a mall food break, or do smaller shopping trips,<br/>
&gt;or only shop when she can stay with someone else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!  This is deffinitly a piece of the puzzle.  Davan doesn&#39;t really like stores unless she has money to spend (and who can blame her) and can look only at things she&#39;s interested in.  I usually try to do store trips when she can stay at home.  I even had a feeling it was going to turn out badly, but thought, it&#39;ll be quick, we&#39;re already out, the whole family is doing something together instead of a couple staying at home, we are picking up one thing for her, so that&#39;s catch her interest....sigh.  Prevention is the best medicine.<br/>

Everyone&#39;s responses have been great in helping me remember that everyone else isn&#39;t perfect while I&#39;m the only one making mistakes.  Which, when something goes wrong, I have a tendency to feel that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879778">Mary,<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying you have never had a moment where your patience ran thin?  <br/>
Where you felt frustrated and overwhelmed?  I read her post in the <br/>
figurative sense.  That there are days when the *thought* of throwing the <br/>
towel in comes to mind.  I saw nothing to suggest she was actually making <br/>
that a serious consideration.  I read a post by a mother needing <br/>
reassurance, a friendly smile and a nudge back in the right direction.  What <br/>
I don&#39;t understand about your reply is why you want to do better. (?)  What <br/>
did you handle incorrectly that you might like to change?  Did you handle <br/>
them all with patience and understanding?  If so, where is the need for <br/>
improvement in your reactions??<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but I have a hard time believing that you have never once felt a <br/>
lack of patience as a mother.  I could see having a lack of patience but <br/>
still being understanding and gentle in your approach.  To put the word job <br/>
in stars seemed snarky to me.  I don&#39;t see how a *job* is a bad thing!  <br/>
Weren&#39;t you the one who spoke of listing mother on a form of some sort in <br/>
the *job* blank?  Either that or you were the one who shared the essay it <br/>
stemmed from.  Yet you put it in stars as if it were condecending to <br/>
consider our life work a job.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh, this is irritating.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it would be one thing to say that, no, you have never felt that way <br/>
and given ways you handle daily stress in your life.  But you left it at, <br/>
no, I never feel that way about my *job*.  How was that in any way helpful <br/>
and did you honestly think your response was helpful to her in *any* way?  <br/>
Or was it an attempt to come here and tout your perfect righteousness and <br/>
possibly make someone feel like shit?<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m confused by this. The people that commented on this gave a resounding<br/>
yes answer. My first thought at reading it was definitely no.<br/>
What &quot;job&quot; are speaking of? Being a mom or being a mom to unschooled kids?<br/>
Well either way, the wording of &quot;feel like I don&#39;t have enough patience&quot;<br/>
makes me feel like someone just wanted to call it a day and not go on<br/>
anymore. (with the job) I have never felt like that. I haven&#39;t felt like I<br/>
don&#39;t have &quot;enough&quot; patience. What I do feel at times is that I want and<br/>
need to be better at what I do. No, actually I always feel like I want to do<br/>
better. But I have never questioned why I do this or feel like I bit off<br/>
more than I can chew.<br/>
