<div id="ygrps-yiv-133275862">First, to every one who offered advice on books and words to help convince <br/>
my dh to give unschooling more then a sideways glance, thank you.  <br/>
Suprisingly (or maybe not), much of what was said are things I already have <br/>
done or read- I guess I am better armed then I thought I was ;)  The <br/>
Unschooling Handbook has had the esteemed &quot;coffee table spot&quot; since it has <br/>
entered the house some 6 months ago.  I did manage to get dh to read some of <br/>
it, but he tends to fall asleep reading most everything in his hands (left <br/>
over reflex from college). On the suggestion og some of the people here, I <br/>
am going to order David Gutterson&#39;s book- what&#39;s it called again? from <br/>
Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
So, I will continue what I have been doing, quoting others, reading snipits <br/>
from here and there, and keeping the household in a state of interesting <br/>
chaos. Most likely, we&#39;ll blink one day and the kids will be 18 and 20 and <br/>
he will say, &quot;huh? it went by so fast! and we forgot to write a curriculum <br/>
and teach them long division!&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
On another note: we got 26 inches of snow last night.  Sage, my older at <br/>
4.5, was outside digging a hole into the side of a huge pile of snow at the <br/>
end of the driveway.  She was trying to make an igloo, and had been working <br/>
on this for almost 2 hours without much progress, although she did <br/>
eventually realize that she needed to pack the snow in for more stability <br/>
and working with an ice &quot;shovel&quot; was more effective then mittens... I went <br/>
inside for a coffee refill and was watching her from the window.  Some guy <br/>
walked up to her, said something and then walked on down the street.  Sage <br/>
semed upset, so I poked my head out the door. First she said, &quot;he wanted to <br/>
say hi&quot; then  she told me that he had said that she better not dig anymore <br/>
because the snow would fall on her head and she would get trapped in it and <br/>
not be able to breathe.  She started to cry and came in the house.<br/>
<br/>
She was SO happy making the igloo!  I used to make all kinds of forts and <br/>
igloos when I was a kid.  I was quite peeved that some stranger could <br/>
destroy something so wonderful, not the igloo, but the desire to make it. <br/>
tomorrow, I will suit up and show her how I used to do it (if I can remember <br/>
how) and to protect her from all those people who would squash igloo <br/>
building attempts...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401297607">Here&#39;s a page that might get her back in the spirit:<br/>

0100coldhouse.html .  It&#39;s not an igloo, but it&#39;s a fun snow fort.   We<br/>
bought cheap rectangular molds for our igloo making.  Nothing&#39;s caved in<br/>
on us yet.  Once she gets it made you can stock it with snowballs that<br/>
might accidently hit unsuspecting dream squashers as they walk by :0).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976604558">I&#39;m sorry that guy wrecked the fun and made your girl cry. <br/>
That guy was right though, as far as the facts. And I&#39;m sure he <br/>
really meant well. That does happen and kids have suffocated and died <br/>
in forts of that design. I knew a kid in school whose cousin died in <br/>
one that collapsed on him. (It&#39;s the first place I remember hearing <br/>
the phrase &quot;freak accident&quot;.) Just one shovel full of snow is dang <br/>
heavy. Imagine half a fort&#39;s worth of snow on top of a little kid.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that, we make them in snow piles by digging a hole down in <br/>
from the top, sort of volcano style. Then we make little short <br/>
tunnels going out of it closer, to the top...usually a very short  <br/>
sliding tunnel is what they like to make. It&#39;s not the same but it&#39;s <br/>
still really fun! They also dig little cubby holes on the inside <br/>
walls for &quot;storing food&quot; and to put jar candles in if they want to. <br/>
Painting the outside with colored water is one more way to enjoy <br/>
their new home too. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If there was an adult nearby, then this man was out of line. But a mound<br/>
of snow caving in and suffocating a small child is a very real concern,<br/>
and IMO the man was just being thoughtful, seeing a young child doing<br/>
something potentially dangerous without an adult near, most likely not<br/>
knowing that you were watching out the window. <br/>
<br/>
Last summer my dd&#39;s 7yo neighbor friend was playing out in a newly tilled<br/>
farmers field after a few days of rain. They often play adventure games<br/>
and stuff, like pretending to be stuck and such, and when I looked out at<br/>
the field (about 900 feet away) dd&#39;s friend was waving her arms in the<br/>
air. I wasn&#39;t sure what to think, and I surely didn&#39;t want to disturb<br/>
them in the midst of their imaginary game, but I wasn&#39;t comfortable with<br/>
what I saw. At the risk of destroying their game, I ran over to see what<br/>
was up. Thank God I did, because Jace was up to her waist in mud, the dog<br/>
was stuck, and my dd was trying to pull her out only to get herself<br/>
stuck. I got everybody out, lost a shoe, and learned an important lesson<br/>
about mud. If I wasn&#39;t there, I surely would have hoped that an adult<br/>
passing by would have aided them, or better yet, said, &quot;Hi girls, you<br/>
know that mud gets like quicksand after a day of rain. Be careful.&quot;<br/>
before it happened.<br/>
