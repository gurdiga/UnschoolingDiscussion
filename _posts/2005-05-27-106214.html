 </span></blockquote>I hope Sandra will re-post her reply to this question where she shared<br/>
about how she handled porn/sexuality with Kirby (just wanted to remind<br/>
you of it, Sandra, because it was so helpful to me at the time).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve not monitored our kids&#39; use of the computer/Internet. But we<br/>
have talked about the dangers and have given them ideas for how to<br/>
protect themselves. Our kids don&#39;t post phone numbers or addresses and<br/>
use usually first names or screen names.<br/>
<br/>
That said, my daughter has made real friends all over the world<br/>
through the Internet and these friends do have our address because<br/>
they send her gifts, letters and packages often! We&#39;ve had gifts from<br/>
as far away as Latvia and Australia. :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also met a couple of her online friends when we&#39;ve traveled. She<br/>
is now 15.<br/>
<br/>
As far as porn goes, if someone wants to find it, he will. To me, it&#39;s<br/>
similar to drugs, sex, and cigarettes - the bigger the taboo, the<br/>
stronger the appeal for some kids. I remember seeing a 14 year-ish old<br/>
boy at the library with a screen size of two inches scrolling up and<br/>
down a breast. &lt;bg&gt; He was in public! Not deterred.<br/>
<br/>
So while we&#39;ve talked about it with them, it isn&#39;t a focus of our<br/>
Internet preoccupation.<br/>

Something really interesting has happened recently. Roxana is involved <br/>
in an online role-playing activity where people interact on Live <br/>
Journal in the roles of famous literary characters. So you have <br/>
Sherlock Holmes chatting with Ender Wiggins and so on. Very cool. She <br/>
LOVES it. Is spending 5 or 6 hours per day on it, lately.<br/>
<br/>
So - what&#39;s funny is that some of them have started writing real <br/>
LETTERS to each other - in long-hand, I mean, putting them in envelopes <br/>
and MAILING them to each other. For some of them, it just seems to be a <br/>
natural part of their character to want to write letters, so they&#39;re <br/>
doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE it - seeing these in the mailbox - addressed to Rox&#39;s character <br/>
names!<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was in school, in 4th grade, they did an activity <br/>
called, &quot;Hot Seat,&quot; where one person sat on a chair and the other kids <br/>
sat on the floor around him/her. The person on the chair was supposed <br/>
to pretend to be a character from a book the whole class was reading <br/>
and the other kids must ask that &quot;character&quot; questions and he/she would <br/>
answer (in character). Some kids - maybe 2 or 3 kids - really liked it <br/>
and got into it. The others went through the motions - they asked every <br/>
character the same few questions and they always gave the same rote <br/>
answers. Did their time.<br/>
<br/>
Now there are all these people - hundreds, I think -  spending hours <br/>
and hours pretending to be characters from literature and having <br/>
fascinating interactions with each other. Nobody&#39;s making them do it. <br/>
Roxana is regularly staying up until 3 am because she&#39;s enjoying it SO <br/>
much that she just can&#39;t make herself stop and go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
This is HER thing - she loves literary stuff - character analysis and <br/>
so on. She&#39;s absolutely totally completely THRILLED to have discovered <br/>
all these other people who share this passion with her. I&#39;m SO glad <br/>
she&#39;s not in school, being forced to do anything like this with people <br/>
who are NOT interested and just going through the motions, doing their <br/>
time!!!<br/>

============================================<br/>
 <br/>
Anyone who read that should really think for a long while (half an hour, or  <br/>
the rest of your lives &lt;g&gt;) what it would mean to have &quot;made any judgments  <br/>
about it.&quot;  &quot;Judgment&quot; like whether you think it&#39;s a good or bad  idea?  <br/>
Judgment like taking the computer away?<br/>
 <br/>
Someone asked me to post what I had written about Kirby, but I think it&#39;s  <br/>
probably something I wrote on this list about Marty a couple of years ago.   It <br/>
just so happens someone asked me for this two days ago, so it&#39;s handy  (and <br/>
has the message number there too in case anyone wants to go back into the  <br/>
archives and read more of that discussion).<br/>
 <br/>
Oh!  And just before that, I&#39;m going to put here what I wrote when  that mom <br/>
thanked me:<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m criticized by people saying I&#39;m disrespectful to my children  <br/>
for sharing these kinds of stories, and every year or two I ask tell my kids  <br/>
someone said such a thing, or ask if they mind, and they really don&#39;t.   Their <br/>
whole lives started up in and around La Leche League, where moms are  openly <br/>
nursing in front of each other AND working to share and learn about how  to be <br/>
sweet to one&#39;s children.  They understand what&#39;s going on with all  this and <br/>
why, and  (a big one)  they are not ashamed of their  lives.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; But boys get their curiosity blocked because there isn&#39;t  any<br/>
acceptable &quot;pornography&quot; for boys. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s  &quot;acceptable&quot; or not, there is a fair amount of written<br/>
fanfiction involving  characters from comic book series, fantasy series, and<br/>
even video games. Some  of it is just adventure/romance, and some is at least<br/>
as graphic as romance  novels. Maybe it&#39;s for and by girls, though, I don&#39;t<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Two nights  ago I wanted to play Destruct-o-Match on Neopets. Both Marty (14)<br/>
and Holly  (11) play Neopets, and I have an account (just so I can play  that<br/>
pattern-falling cascading game myself without having to ask Marty) and  our<br/>
Mac Powerstrip we use to get to recent files, recent programs, recent  sites<br/>
was FULL of porn stuff. I didn&#39;t open any, the titles themselves were  gross<br/>
enough. OH!! I had wanted to get to Netflix to cancel getting a DVD I  had<br/>
just rented (which didn&#39;t work).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, usually I use it  to get to Neopets games page.<br/>
<br/>
I called Marty in, and said &quot;Marty, this is  a bit much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;Most of it was pop-ups mom, I didn&#39;t really look at  it all much.<br/>
Just some.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked him if he could cover those kinds of  trails over so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
know and so Holly wouldn&#39;t accidently see. I  said he needed to open a bunch<br/>
of CLEAN websites and look at some better  stuff so that would be on the<br/>
trail. He told me he could delete the trail. I  said I didn&#39;t think he<br/>
could, that I had even asked Leon, one of the  developers, who said it only<br/>
works on the Mac OSX version, not 9.<br/>
<br/>
But  Marty is a teenaged boy, so besides his porn curiosity he has a  computer<br/>
facility. And he figured out a three-step process to erase that list  through<br/>
Internet Explorer.<br/>
<br/>
If I say &quot;NO, never ever even look,&quot; I risk  losing the communication we have<br/>
within which he will just tell me what he&#39;s  seen and knows and where it came<br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
But that story has gone two  days now. At first he was embarrassed and &quot;Mom,<br/>
okay, I know, don&#39;t talk to  me about it anymore.&quot; So I said I wanted to talk<br/>
to him one more time the  next day, about whether he knows the reasons people<br/>
object to kids looking at  porn.<br/>
<br/>
The next day came and had nearly passed without me remembering,  when he came<br/>
and said, &quot;Okay, mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You wanted to talk  to me about porn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh! Thanks. I hadn&#39;t remembered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I asked  if he knew the objections. He said no. I said, &quot;In all your<br/>
reading and  listening you haven&#39;t heard objections to porn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, that its illegal  for me to see it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I talked to him about degradation of women, about  creating unhealthy and<br/>
unreasonable expectations in marriages, and that  normal sex wasn&#39;t like that.<br/>
He said &quot;Well, DUH, mom!&quot; I said some people  were messed up by WANTING it<br/>
to be. He seemed surprised that that could  happen.<br/>
<br/>
I told him that some of those who are filmed are not quite  volunteers and<br/>
told him two stories, one of the mom of girls his age he&#39;s  known his whole<br/>
life, who was photographed as a kid for posed stills which  were sold out of<br/>
Oklahoma. It was shocking for him, and I don&#39;t know much  detail, but naming<br/>
a person he knew who had been victimized was effective. I  told him of a<br/>
drug dealer and illegal snake importer my younger half-brother  had taken up<br/>
with some years back, who videod him and his then-girlfriend,  and used it as<br/>
blackmail (she was from a Mormon family) to get them to  deliver drugs for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Then I said I didn&#39;t think it was the most  horrible thing people could do, to<br/>
look at pictures, but he REALLY needed to  be careful because it&#39;s illegal and<br/>
I didn&#39;t want the county coming to talk  to me about anything they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
(I had a similar moment with Holly  later that evening about going outside in<br/>
a teensy fancy t-shirt and nylon  pajama pants, no shoes, in January, while<br/>
she has a sore throat. &quot;Illegal,&quot; I  told her, for parents to allow that,<br/>
and let&#39;s not draw attention to a loose  lifestyle by being outside in the<br/>
cold without proper attire.)<br/>
<br/>
I told  Marty that women tend to prefer word-porn and so they don&#39;t get<br/>
caught, but  pictures were easy to find and more offensive.<br/>
<br/>
I told him one danger was  obsession. I didn&#39;t go into that much, because<br/>
some of the original arguments  about obsession were the cost. I did have a<br/>
friend years ago who had a large  collection of porn videos that had cost him<br/>
$60 to $80 apiece. Had he had the  internet, his obsession wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
ruined his finances, nor left a  mountain of evidence to shock his mom.<br/>
(That friend had a sex change  operation since then, so I think it was his way<br/>
of dealing with deeper  psychological and biological situations, and that was<br/>
way too much to tell  Marty.)<br/>
<br/>
Then I asked him if he had ANY idea how much trouble some other  boys his age<br/>
would get into if their parents caught them having looked at  that kind of<br/>
stuff on the computer. He said &quot;Lots?&quot; I talked about loss of  computer<br/>
accesss, grounding, and physical spanking by some big grown  man.<br/>
<br/>
He said he had been mostly embarrassed when I first talked to him  because he<br/>
had had friends in the house. They couldn&#39;t hear us, but he had to  leave<br/>
where they were, talk to me, and go back in there, and it just  embarrassed<br/>
him. I said in those worst-case situations, the parents would  have called<br/>
all of the friends&#39; parents, said to come get them, told them  why, and some<br/>
of THEM would have been grounded and in trouble just for  hanging out with<br/>
someone who had looked at porn.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt he really  fully believes me on those things, or maybe he can&#39;t fathom<br/>
a parent doing  that to a child.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind having a kid who can&#39;t readily imagine  being hit by an angry,<br/>
grown man or can&#39;t imagine being told &quot;You stay in  your room for a month and<br/>
don&#39;t even touch a computer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who  has read this far and is offended, I didn&#39;t mean to throw this<br/>
out to offend  anyone. It&#39;s a candid, current situation involving a real teen.<br/>
<br/>
And  usually the trail on this real teen&#39;s internet use has Neopets, AoN  (a<br/>
role-playing game), humor sites, and in-person friends&#39; journals.  People<br/>
who know Marty wouldn&#39;t think of him as a nasty kid. He&#39;s not. He is  coming<br/>
into adulthood, though, and he&#39;s curious.<br/>
<br/>
I think similar to  make-up, if it is declared &quot;only for adults,&quot; and a girl<br/>
waits and waits and  WAITS until she can use it and is then unlikely to just<br/>
let it go unused, a  boy who is slapped away from any glimpse of nudity until<br/>
he&#39;s eighteen is  GOING to immerse himself in his newfound access for a while<br/>
the moment he  gets a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I were out grocery shopping, and talking about  Kirby turning<br/>
seventeen this year. I said I used to want to have a big  eighteenth birthday<br/>
celebration for him, like a graduation, but I no longer  want to do that. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to declare an end to his learning, nor to his  living with us if he<br/>
wants to stay. Keith said he had no ideas either, but  that was fine. Said<br/>
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to get him drunk and take him to a  whorehouse, so<br/>
there&#39;s probably going to be no rite of passage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby  wouldn&#39;t want any of that anyway. ANOTHER good thing. When he turns<br/>
eighteen,  he&#39;ll have more legal rights, but there won&#39;t be the effect of huge<br/>
tension  released. He&#39;ll have no restrictions suddenly lifted.<br/>
<br/>
I know this won&#39;t  suit everyone&#39;s belief system, but it is working with us to<br/>
produce mature,  calm, considerate, communicative teenaged boys. They&#39;re not<br/>
angry with us,  they&#39;re not reactionary, they&#39;re not  sneaky.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My dh has shared that he  believes that when the family is<br/>
<br/>
unhealthy, porn more likely beomces an  addiction to fill a hole. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree. I think it&#39;s the same as  other &quot;internet dangers.&quot; If a child has<br/>
nothing else to do and no  affirmation of wholeness, the internet can be an<br/>
escape from what seems a  lack of life. But when life is big and real and<br/>
happy, the child will be  there, in his own real life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<br/>
issues I&#39;ve raised. Your perspective and style  of interaacting with<br/>
<br/>
your kids is refreshing and gives me  hope.&gt;&gt;<br/>

I just noticed the juxtaposition of those. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby&#39;s been playing World of Warcraft obsessively the last few days, and I  <br/>
just talked to Holly, who says Darwin (the six year old whose family she&#39;s  <br/>
staying with) has been playing it a lot.<br/>
 <br/>
Holly never has played World of Warcraft, but she said their first stop in  <br/>
France was a rest stop, which was closed, but they saw bikers having sex  <br/>
there.  &quot;Just minding their own business,&quot; she said.  Then today they  went to <br/>
Normandy, and to Omaha Beach, where the kids played in the German  bunkers, heard <br/>
the story of the Allied landing and the casualties, and saw  people having sex <br/>
on the beach.<br/>
 <br/>
So I&#39;m thinking at the moment that kids are WAY safer from seeing other  <br/>
folks having sex if they&#39;re  looking for more World of Warcraft hints than  if <br/>
they&#39;re visiting France.  (And honestly, it&#39;s not like Holly went to a  peep <br/>
show, or the participants were showing her any details or inviting her to  join.  <br/>
As she says, they were minding their own business.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I need to go and the change the itinerary to reflect what I just learned  <br/>
from Holly, but even though some of the details are not up to date (they ended  <br/>
up going by boat instead of Eurotunnel), there are some good photos of Holly  <br/>
very muddy (as muddy as a kid can get, I think) here:<br/>

Great Britain made it something I could not keep up with, so I bowed <br/>
out. It was fun while it lasted and I try to still keep up with the <br/>
story lines when I can.<br/>

might start clicking on those smutty banner ads at sometime, but he got <br/>
a nasty browser hijacker a few months ago and has gotten real careful <br/>
about what he clicks on and which sites he visits. Right now our <br/>
computers are in the living room so there is less chance of lots of <br/>
viewing time---I think he wants to turn his closet into his &quot;computer <br/>
spot&quot; in his room now that I mentioned about Sandra&#39;s son so he may have <br/>
the computer in his room in the future.<br/>
I&#39;m of two minds; I know he is a guy and at some point will look at smut <br/>
and I know that at his age I was curious and looked at my dad&#39;s <br/>
porn.Also read a lot of those soft core romance novels like &quot; The Flame <br/>
and The Flower&quot;. I guess I&#39;d rather he not, but I think (and its not a <br/>
bridge I&#39;ve crossed yet) that if he does surf those sites I&#39;ll just <br/>
remind him why viewing porn is not the best way to spend his time and <br/>
that basically its illegal.<br/>
I&#39;ll feel like a hypocrite, since I read way too much smutty fanfiction <br/>

It&#39;s really not fair that girls can get away with reading &quot;romance novels&quot;  <br/>

smile because they&#39;re reading books, but a boy can get caught with a copy of  <br/>

It isn&#39;t fair, and it isn&#39;t healthy.  (Not that the romance novels are  <br/>
healthy, but I have read pretty many, and will probably read a few more before I  <br/>
go.)<br/>

It&#39;s  illegal to look at porn?  Are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kiddie porn is illegal.  I don&#39;t think other porn is illegal, they  sell the <br/>
magazines almost anywhere.<br/>
 <br/>
Just like with anything in life, I think if you just flat out tell your  <br/>
child NO, because I said so, it&#39;s going to make it much more attractive to them  <br/>
and then the nasty chain of keeping things from the parents begins.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not saying that a parent needs to know EVERYTHING a teen age  child/young <br/>
adult does or have them tell the parent either.  Lord knows  there are many <br/>
things I could have done without hearing about from my kids at  that age.  But <br/>
now that I look back, I&#39;m grateful they felt like they COULD  share those <br/>
things with me and be open and honest and look for honest answers  and not <br/>
judgements.<br/>
 <br/>
Sex is a part of life and no parents is ever going to stop a child/young  <br/>
adults interest in it, no matter what you do or say, if they are interested  <br/>
enough, they will find a way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tell you the truth, I&#39;m not sure. I know it illegal to sell to a minor.<br/>
On the Internet it is harder to deal with since different countries have <br/>
different ages at which kids are no longer minors or over the &quot;age of <br/>
consent&quot;. Most of the fanfiction archives that I frequent, (those would <br/>
be ones where the ratings of stories go up to NC-17) like The Restricted <br/>
Section or Sycophant Hex, have disclaimers and say no one under 18 is <br/>
allowed to read. Now that just depends on the honesty of the reader. I <br/>
would assume these are more of a CYA action then any worry of folks over <br/>
say 16 reading smutty slash stories.<br/>

Dh and I just discussed this. I was asking him if he would freak out if <br/>
Josh ended up looking at porn online and Jim was like &quot;I&#39;m surprised he <br/>
hasn&#39;t yet.&quot;<br/>
He did also state that he felt looking at Playboy and reading Penthouse <br/>
letters created unrealistic expectations in him when he was younger, but <br/>
we are not going to punish the boy if we find out he&#39;s been trying to <br/>
access porn online.<br/>
If I find charges on my phone bill or credit card I would be a tad upset.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603206249">The first nude photo of people I had ever seen was not porn.  It was a  bunch <br/>
of nude sunbathers on a beach (probably France, where Holly has personal  <br/>
experience suggesting people are going at it everywhere, and yet these people  <br/>
were NOT going at it whatsoever).  Mostly men, mostly older, just being  there, <br/>
lying in the sun with their eyes closed, and it was a distance shot  so they <br/>
were ...  If a computer screen were the whole photo, the people  were about the <br/>
size of a person&#39;s finger, and about 15 of them showed, and then  there was <br/>
some beach, and some cliff.<br/>
 <br/>
Not detailed.  We were all 12/13 (early 8th grade) and one of the boys  <br/>
brought it.  We were taking turns looking at it and then folding it quietly  back <br/>
and passing it on.  What was the big buzz will probably seem stupid to  some of <br/>
the people here.<br/>
 <br/>
This was a little town in northern New Mexico.  Almost all of us (over  99%) <br/>
had dark brown hair, or black hair (some of the Indian kids, and  half-Indian, <br/>
some of them brown hair too).  Few of us had much public hair  yet.  Even the <br/>
two redheaded kids (one strawberry blonde, a girl from  Texas; one <br/>
dark-red-haired boy of a really old local Hispanic family) had  dark-haired parents.   <br/>
There had been a blonde girl in our class  (larger class; 300 kids or so in 8th <br/>
grade that year) but she wasn&#39;t there that  year for some reason I don&#39;t <br/>
remember (Martha-Ellen something; went to my  church, I sold her my piano when I <br/>
was 22 or so).<br/>
 <br/>
We were all looking at the red and blonde pubic hair. The discussion was  <br/>
that we hadn&#39;t realized people with light-colored hair on their heads would also  <br/>
have that color of public hair. I was surprised at how much pubic hair a man  <br/>
could have, and chest hair.   My only prior experience was of men  having <br/>
beards that didn&#39;t necessarily match the hair on their heads.<br/>
 <br/>
I just realized that it was that same physical classroom we passed that  <br/>
nude-beach photo around in that was my classroom when I was teaching sex ed to  my <br/>
class, and Judy K&#39;s class, and Alice Prather&#39;s class, because the other two  <br/>
of them were too shy and clueless to begin to discuss it with them.  Never  in <br/>
all those years have I connected those two incidents.  Room A-9, of a  school <br/>
building that was built by the WPA and is no longer classrooms.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think kids (even boys who are touching themselves) look at porn the  <br/>
way adults do.  I don&#39;t think our guesses of what they&#39;re thinking are  likely <br/>
to be entirely on target.  I DO know parental reaction can screw  kids up and <br/>
parents won&#39;t get the reaction they&#39;d hoped for (if they&#39;d thought  about <br/>
what they thought their rules or shaming would get them).<br/>
