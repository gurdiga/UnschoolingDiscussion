&gt; someone&#39;s happy day, I might as well have a lobotomy and put my kids back in<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve known you now for about 5+ years.  I may not always agree with some things you say or philosophies you expound, but you ALWAYS make me think about things and look at things in other ways.  Some of your posts I have saved and printed to reread<br/>
over the years. One that really made me think was when you posted about your sister&#39;s kids going to school and how she complained about school.  You commented that if your kids wanted to go to school you would let them, even though you wanted them<br/>
home, so you would not play the school &quot;game&quot; with them.  The schools would have to do whatever they could to keep your kids there, to make it better, or something to that effect, because they had the option to come home and you would welcome them<br/>
home..  Homework would be your kids responsibility and you wouldn&#39;t be making sure they got it done, and stuff like that.  Anyway, it was really interesting and I hope it&#39;s in your book!<br/>
<br/>
My biggest thanks to you is that you constantly challenge me to &quot;think outside the box&quot;. I love when there is real unschooling talk here and you respond to people when they ask things like, &quot;But don&#39;t they have to do math?, What if they just want<br/>
to play Nintendo all day and NEVER pick up books to read or do anything academic?, How will they get into college if they haven&#39;t had courses and credits?, etc. etc.&quot;  I hope stuff like this is in your book too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being around and being patient with me and others! You&#39;re truly unique.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, has Helen Hegener ever thought of writing a book as well, do you know? She&#39;s a radical unschooler too!  Are you no longer writing a column in HEM?  I miss reading them!<br/>

&quot;What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for<br/>
children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than<br/>
the schools,but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.&quot;<br/>

I got behind, had some personal upheavals, and (embarrassingly) didn&#39;t get <br/>
back to it.  I screwed it up.  Some are online, though, I think (some of the <br/>
essays).<br/>
