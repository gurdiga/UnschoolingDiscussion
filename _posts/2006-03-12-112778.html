Wow!  I still haven&#39;t seen the actual article.  I have only seen it on<br/>
the Tribune website.  I can&#39;t seem to find a copy of the Chicago Tribune<br/>
anywhere near where we live.  My mom is getting some copies for me in<br/>
Phoenix, AZ.  I am wondering if they included pictures of my family.  <br/>

<h4>Deanne Brown</h4>
<p><small><time>12 Mar 2006, at  8:42pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126528909"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;What did you think of how it turned out, Deanne?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am happy that the reporter displayed unschooling in a positive light.<br/>
Basically, I felt that it was a good article.<br/>
 <br/>
I was happy that he chose to print the following quote:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I think the one reason that stands out from the rest is that I felt<br/>
that my kids were losing that incredible spark they had before they<br/>
entered school,&quot; Deanne Brown said. &quot;After being in school for a few<br/>
years I saw their natural curiosity, imagination and love for learning<br/>
being crushed by rules and conditioning. Learning became a task.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, he also left out a lot of information that I originally wrote<br/>
to him.  I would have liked to see the reporter include more of the<br/>
details that I sent him.  He had a tendency of summarizing some of my<br/>
comments.  For example, my kids do a lot more with other kids than just<br/>
park day and team sports. I think that the details are really important<br/>
when attempting to explain unschooling.  <br/>
 <br/>
He also treated my children very politely and quite fairly especially<br/>
when choosing Riley&#39;s quotes.  And, I laughed out loud at Riley&#39;s last<br/>
comment:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;My schooled friends&#39; opening question is usually, `What grade are you<br/>
in?&#39;&quot; said Riley Brown. &quot;I tell them that I would be in the 7th grade,<br/>
but it really doesn&#39;t matter. I don&#39;t usually try to explain because<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t get it if I did.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Sadly, my son Casey was a little disappointed that they didn&#39;t print<br/>
anything that he said and he said some great stuff.  <br/>
 <br/>
Also, I wasn&#39;t impressed with the quotes he chose in opposition to<br/>
unschooling.  They were pretty silly arguments especially the one about<br/>
Amelia Earhart and Harriet Tubman. I am not sure that some of the people<br/>
he chose to quote in opposition to unschooling really understand<br/>
unschooling.  But, I am also not surprised that he couldn&#39;t find a truly<br/>
viable argument.   <br/>
 <br/>
Also, since I still haven&#39;t actually seen the article, I am very curious<br/>
which pictures they chose to print.  Originally, they wanted &quot;schooly&quot;<br/>
pictures.  The photographer spent four hours with us.  She learned quite<br/>
quickly that she wasn&#39;t going to get &quot;schooly pictures (except of my<br/>
kids reading).  She truly respected and seemed to understand why that<br/>
would not make sense.  <br/>
 <br/>
There are so many people out there in the world that have never even<br/>
heard the term unschooling so the reporter truly was faced with a<br/>
challenge.  Basically, I think that he made a good attempt to rise to<br/>
the challenge.  Maybe he missed a few things but for a newspaper<br/>
article, I was happy with it.  To truly understand unschooling, one<br/>
little article is not going to do it.  But, maybe, just maybe, this<br/>
article introduced a concept just enough to get a few people interested.<br/>
I think you need lots of books, experience, discussion lists, and time<br/>
before anyone can truly understand unschooling.  I know that I did.  It<br/>
surely didn&#39;t happen with one article.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544090622">Hi Deanne,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if you got your copy of the Trib yet, but  <br/>
congratulations are in order!<br/>
<br/>
Not only did they put a picture of you and your older(?) son and  <br/>
daughter (playing guitar), but it was on the FRONT PAGE!<br/>
<br/>
We were pleased to see the article, which also includes a picture and  <br/>
quotes from the local Haun-Parke family (Wini and her family were  <br/>
featured on the CNN Anderson Cooper show recently too).<br/>
<br/>
We wondered how the article began with a California family, but Wini  <br/>
said that it began with research by a CA affiliate of the Trib - is  <br/>
that true Deanne?  Was there a particular reason they cited for  <br/>
covering unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Hope you get your copies soon!<br/>

 <br/>
Wow!  The Front Page!  OK.  I still haven&#39;t seen the actual paper or any<br/>
of the pictures, but I have several people working on it.  I am going<br/>
camping today for the week, so it seems I will have to wait until we<br/>
return.<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, I have always wanted to play guitar.  I took lessons when I<br/>
was young but quit.  Riley is now helping me learn.<br/>

 <br/>
Kay Alina, the family from Dana Point on the CNN Anderson Cooper Show<br/>
forwarded a note to our local homeschooling group from Vince, the<br/>
reporter that did this article.  He was looking for an unschooling<br/>
family in the area.  I decided to take a chance and jump in.  I was<br/>
nervous about it but I felt that I had something to say.  I also had<br/>
complete trust in my kids. And, yes, Vince is a West Coast reporter for<br/>
the Tribune.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Kelly for the inside view from Chicago.<br/>
