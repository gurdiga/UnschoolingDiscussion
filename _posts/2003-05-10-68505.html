&gt; of Australian girls trying to escape from a similar boarding school<br/>
&gt; situation.  My husband drew the conclusion that rape of servant<br/>
&gt; girls/women was an intentional part of the government&#39;s plan of diluting<br/>
&gt; racial characteristics.  I wonder if other people who saw the movie,<br/>
&gt; read the book, or know the real history would agree with that inference.<br/>

watching the movie!<br/>
