<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929908179">~What we learned in the original post (which I don&#39;t<br/>
have and which had another subject line) was a little<br/>
boy was called a satan worshipper for being pagan. <br/>
Was he in school?  Then perhaps our own<br/>
proper/allowable <br/>
response was &quot;Take him out and homeschool him to avoid<br/>
this in the future.&quot;~<br/>
<br/>
Im sorry but were not Pagan, were Cherokee and follow<br/>
the teachings of our ancestors.  Theres a big<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
Yes he was in school and I pulled him for that reason.<br/>
 I wasnt going to allow him to be subjugated to<br/>
teachers telling him he was wrong about his own<br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
I didnt realize the hailstorm my intro would set off. <br/>
I hope no one takes offense but thats all it was, an<br/>
intro.  Ive enjoyed finding out there are other<br/>
Traditional homeschooling moms out there and hope to<br/>
be able to share more with them in the future.<br/>

Robin, Don&#39;t worry. These things tend to take on a life of their own. It can<br/>
be a good thing because we can all learn from whatever direction it goes.<br/>
Welcome again.<br/>
