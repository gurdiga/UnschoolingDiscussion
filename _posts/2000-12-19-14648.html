<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887701197"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: Amy Spang &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aspang1@...">aspang1@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since the subject of nursing has come up, I wonder if anyone else is<br/>
&gt; having a problem with very frequent night time nursing?  My 16 mo. old<br/>
&gt; wakes up to nurse every 2-3 hours every night like clockwork , and I am<br/>
&gt; getting so tired I&#39;m afraid to get behind the wheel to drive anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, my heart goes out to you because I have *SO* been there! I remember once<br/>
I drove past my own house several times, I was in such a state of confusion.<br/>
There were times I felt out of my mind because of lack of sleep. My son woke<br/>
up about every 45 minutes to an hour for the first couple of years. All I<br/>
can tell you is that this *will* pass. This age - 12 months to about 18<br/>
months - seems to be one of the hardest for night nursings. A lot of growth,<br/>
2 year molars, a ton of cognitive development, I think these things all<br/>
combine to make babies of this age more wakeful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t keep him in our bed because we get even less sleep (our bed is<br/>
&gt; small) and I have talked to people who say, &quot;Let him nurse as much as he<br/>
&gt; wants at night,&quot; and others (like the pediatrician) who say, &quot; Cut him<br/>
&gt; off right now or he will never learn to get to sleep on his own&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I have to say that I disagree with the latter. I think especially as<br/>
unschoolers, we probably all are struggling to realize that we really don&#39;t<br/>
have to &quot;teach&quot; our kids much at all, they *will* learn it or do it when<br/>
they are ready, no matter what society or the &quot;experts&quot; say. My son sleeps a<br/>
solid 9 hours straight now and he was the worst nighttime waker of all time!<br/>
I remember well the day he asked for his own bed in his own room. I was<br/>
amazed, proud, sad, happy. Of course, he still comes in at about 6:30 am to<br/>
snuggle in our family bed. As others have suggested, you might consider<br/>
going to the mattress-on-the-floor model of sleeping. That&#39;s what we did,<br/>
that way you can add and subtract other mattresses as needed to accomodate<br/>
other bodies.<br/>
<br/>
I know this advice *never* sounds right at the time, but it really is true<br/>
that &quot;this too shall pass&quot;. Some things I found helpful to me were to<br/>
practice breathing or meditation during night-time nursings and that helped<br/>
keep me in a relaxed state so that I could more easily go back to sleep. I<br/>
also found that taking all clocks out of the bedroom had a very beneficial<br/>
effect. When I knew exactly how long it had been since the last nursing, I<br/>
just got more and more frustrated. Without the clock, I found it easier to<br/>
be relaxed about it.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you!!<br/>
