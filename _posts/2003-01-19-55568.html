Vonnegut at 80<br/>
By David Hoppe, NUVO<br/>
January 10, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Asked how he&#39;s doing, Kurt Vonnegut says, &quot;I&#39;m mad about being old<br/>
and I&#39;m mad about being American. Apart from that, OK.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Vonnegut has just turned 80. Although he claims he&#39;s retired from<br/>
writing, he has just finished an introduction for a book of anti-war<br/>
posters by artist Micah Ian Wright. Vonnegut continues to be a<br/>
cultural presence, speaking out against war with Iraq to 10,000<br/>
protestors at a rally in New York&#39;s Central Park and making a<br/>
spoken-word contribution to the new multimedia world music<br/>
production, One Giant Leap. <br/>
<br/>
While Vonnegut has always owned his Indianapolis sense of place, he<br/>
has seemed less interested in grounding himself to a particular<br/>
locale than in using place as a portal to some greater, universal<br/>
understanding of life. Vonnegut has long argued that we are,<br/>
ultimately, planetary citizens -- whether we realize it or not. <br/>
<br/>
As extraordinarily popular as Vonnegut&#39;s work has proved to be -<br/>
virtually everything he&#39;s written is still in print -- he&#39;s hardly a<br/>
bringer of reassuring tidings. History, he seems to suggest, is<br/>
important not, as per Santyana, so that we can avoid past mistakes,<br/>
but as a predictor of what we corrupt souls are likely to do to one<br/>
another. <br/>
<br/>
Vonnegut, after all, is an avant-garde artist, whose &quot;aggressively<br/>
unconventional&quot; (his words) approach to storytelling would likely<br/>
put readers off if it weren&#39;t for the wryly aphoristic,<br/>
conversational tone of his voice. He has said he learned to<br/>
effectively write the way he talked by having to phone in stories<br/>
during his days as a reporter for the Chicago News Bureau. <br/>
<br/>
Kurt Vonnegut recently took some time to talk from his home in New<br/>
York City about how he thinks things are going these days: <br/>
<br/>
In 1991, you spoke to the Wordstruck Festival in Indianapolis right<br/>
after the end of the Gulf War against Iraq. During your speech you<br/>
remarked on television footage you&#39;d seen of Iraqi soldiers who&#39;d<br/>
been taken prisoner and said, &quot;Those men are my brothers.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Vonnegut: All soldiers are. <br/>
<br/>
And here we are on the brink of another war with Iraq. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to belong to a country that attacks little countries. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to belong to that kind of a country. I wrote a piece for<br/>
7 Stories Press here in New York. They&#39;re about to publish a book of<br/>
anti-war posters by a guy nobody&#39;s heard of before -- he&#39;s a pretty<br/>
good artist and so I was asked to write a piece for it. Would you<br/>
like me to read it? <br/>
<br/>
Please. <br/>
<br/>
(Reading) &quot;These anti-war posters by Micah Ian Wright are<br/>
reminiscent in spirit of works by artists like Kathe Kollwitz and<br/>
Georg Grosz and on and on during the 1920s, when it was becoming<br/>
ever more evident that the infant German democracy was about to be<br/>
murdered by psychopathic personalities -- hereinafter P.P.s -- the<br/>
medical term for smart, personable people who have no conscience.<br/>
P.P.s are fully aware of how much suffering their actions will<br/>
inflict on others but do not care. They cannot care. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The classic medical text about how such attractive leaders bring us<br/>
into unspeakable calamities is The Mask of Sanity by Dr. Hervey<br/>
Cleckley. An American P.P. at the head of a corporation, for<br/>
example, could enrich himself by ruining his employees and investors<br/>
and still feel as pure as the driven snow. A P.P., should he attain<br/>
a post near the top of our federal government, might feel that<br/>
taking the country into an endless war with casualties in the<br/>
millions was simply something decisive to do today. So to bed. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;With a P.P., decisiveness is all. Or, to put it another way, we now<br/>
have a Reichstag fire of our own.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s become of conscience? <br/>
<br/>
Again, as Cleckley says, these people are around and do rise. Women<br/>
are attracted to them. I mean, this is a defect, but women are<br/>
attracted to them because they are so confident. They really don&#39;t<br/>
give a fuck what happens - not even to themselves. But this is a<br/>
serious defect and, no, we haven&#39;t been invaded and conquered by<br/>
Martians. We have been conquered by psychopathic personalities who<br/>
are attractive. <br/>
<br/>
Has television played a part in this? <br/>
<br/>
We have no idea what technology has done to us. Last night I went to<br/>
a party for Gordon Parks, a black genius. Walter Cronkite was there.<br/>
Cronkite&#39;s an old friend. I said to him, &quot;You know, the country you<br/>
did so much to shape seems so shapeless now.&quot; One thing about TV is<br/>
you don&#39;t have to do anything ... <br/>
<br/>
We become spectators. <br/>
<br/>
Yes. And that&#39;s enough. We&#39;re thanked for that: &quot;Thank You For<br/>
Watching ...&quot; (laughs) <br/>
<br/>
Ratings are becoming more important than votes. <br/>
<br/>
Well, technology has fucked us up in many ways. What I&#39;ve said about<br/>
the computer revolution is that it&#39;s allowed white collar criminals<br/>
to do what the Mob would have loved to do -- put a pawn shop and a<br/>
loan shark in every home! <br/>
<br/>
Technology changes us, yet it&#39;s very difficult for us to recognize<br/>
the changes because we&#39;re in their midst. <br/>
<br/>
Of course it does. Life asks us for this and asks us for that: Go<br/>
get yourself some food. You have tasks, it turns out, in order to<br/>
get satisfied. But you don&#39;t have to do them now. You can sit at<br/>
home and it&#39;s simply done to you. So we&#39;re not terribly interesting<br/>
animals anymore. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve talked about how the Bush Administration seems driven by<br/>
revenge. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a story to tell. He&#39;s in the same business I&#39;m in. He&#39;s telling<br/>
stories. It turns out this is the simplest of all stories to tell. I<br/>
mean, I want to hold attention when I write something. What he wants<br/>
to be is interesting. And revenge is interesting. I&#39;ve said there<br/>
are two radical ideas that have been introduced into human thought.<br/>
One of them is that energy and matter are pretty much the same sort<br/>
of stuff. That&#39;s Einstein. The other is that revenge is a bad idea.<br/>
It&#39;s an enormously popular idea but, of course, Jesus came along<br/>
with the radical idea of forgiveness. That was radical. If you&#39;re<br/>
insulted, you have to square accounts. So this invention by Jesus is<br/>
as radical as Einstein&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve placed a high premium on what you call decency. <br/>
<br/>
One kid said he had the key to all my books and he put it in a<br/>
sentence. He said, &quot;Love may fail but courtesy will prevail.&quot; Love<br/>
does fail all the time, you know, and it makes people vicious. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s interesting because it seems that psychopathic personalities<br/>
tend to give courtesy a bad rap. They find it weak. <br/>
<br/>
They are decisive. They are gonna do something every fuckin&#39; day and<br/>
they are not afraid. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve used satire as a tool to defend against the world&#39;s insanity.<br/>
Can it also work to change things? <br/>
<br/>
I guess it works some. Just telling people, &quot;You are not alone.<br/>
There are a lot of others who feel as you do.&quot; We&#39;re a terribly<br/>
lonesome society. For all I know, all societies are. You can make a<br/>
few new friends, that&#39;s all. You can&#39;t change history. History is<br/>
happening to us now. George Bush has hydrogen bombs if he needs<br/>
them. It really matters who&#39;s around and who&#39;s holding attention. I<br/>
don&#39;t think television will let anybody else hold attention. <br/>
<br/>
Why is that? <br/>
<br/>
During the Vietnam War, which lasted longer than any war we&#39;ve ever<br/>
been in -- and which we lost -- every respectable artist in this<br/>
country was against the war. It was like a laser beam. We were all<br/>
aimed in the same direction. The power of this weapon turns out to<br/>
be that of a custard pie dropped from a stepladder six feet high.<br/>
(laughs) <br/>
<br/>
Powers Hapgood was an internationally known Indianapolis radical and<br/>
socialist. You met him didn&#39;t you? <br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes. He was an official of the CIO then. He was a typical<br/>
Hoosier idealist. Socialism is idealistic. Think of Eugene Debs from<br/>
Terre Haute. What Debs said echoes the Sermon on the Mount: &quot;As long<br/>
as there&#39;s a lower class I am in it. As long as there is a criminal<br/>
element, I am of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not<br/>
free.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Now why can&#39;t the religious right recognize that as a paraphrase of<br/>
the Sermon on the Mount? Hapgood and Debs were both middle-class<br/>
people who thought there could be more economic justice in this<br/>
country. They wanted a better country, that&#39;s all. Hapgood&#39;s family<br/>
owned a successful cannery in Indianapolis<br/>
and Hapgood turned it over to the employees, who ruined it. He led<br/>
the pickets against the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. Hapgood was<br/>
testifying in court in Indianapolis about some picket-line dust-up<br/>
connected with the CIO and the judge stops everything. He says, &quot;Mr.<br/>
Hapgood, here you are, you&#39;re a graduate of Harvard and you own a<br/>
successful business. Why would anyone with your advantages choose to<br/>
live as you have?&quot; Powers Hapgood actually became a coal miner for a<br/>
while. His answer to the judge was great: &quot;The Sermon on the Mount,<br/>
sir.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My God, the religious right will not acknowledge what a merciful<br/>
person Jesus was. <br/>
<br/>
Why are they so intent on making god a punisher? <br/>
<br/>
Because they enjoy punishment. It&#39;s a form of entertainment. The<br/>
reason we still have the death penalty in this country is because<br/>
it&#39;s a major form of entertainment -- a way of holding attention. <br/>
<br/>
You left Indianapolis for the East Coast. But you&#39;ve also said<br/>
there&#39;s good reason for staying put. <br/>
<br/>
You leave home because of lonesomeness, no spiritual reason. You&#39;re<br/>
not going to be able to have shop talk. So you&#39;re going to be<br/>
terribly lonesome. So yes, you go to Greenwich Village or somewhere<br/>
else where people are talking all the time. The turning point in my<br/>
life, even though I was an established writer, was when I went to<br/>
the Writer&#39;s Workshop at the University of Iowa. We were talking<br/>
about literature all the time! On Cape Cod there was nobody for me<br/>
to talk to. It&#39;s a very simple social reason. Of course, I&#39;ve also<br/>
said the more provincial a story is, the more universal it becomes.<br/>
That just happens to be true. <br/>
<br/>
Why is that? Attention to detail? <br/>
<br/>
Yes. It&#39;s going to be a totally human story which people are going<br/>
to recognize as such and so they&#39;ll resonate with it. I mean: Madame<br/>
Bovary - how provincial can you get? <br/>
<br/>
Your work moves people across generations. How do you account for<br/>
that? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to. All I know is it happened. <br/>
