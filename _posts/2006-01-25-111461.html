<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228103800">Here&#39;s the deal  my just turned 6 and 4 year old boys are big time<br/>
into gaming.  I kid you not when I say they spend their morning, noon<br/>
and nights bopping back and forth between the pc, Gameboy and their<br/>
newly acquired holiday gift  Gamecube.  <br/>
<br/>
The house is filled laughter, as well as frustration, when the games<br/>
just don&#39;t cooperate for their desired outcome.  I see how much they<br/>
are gaining from their fun, which dh and I participate in as well. <br/>
(Their skill has far surpassed mine!)  Their interactions with one<br/>
another, as well as navigating the games, in terms of cooperating,<br/>
problem solving, critical thinking amaze me.  The questions that are<br/>
sparked from requesting I pull up a cheat or walkthrough to assist in<br/>
getting to the next level or yesterdays inquiry of &quot;Mom, what&#39;s<br/>
four-three-triple three&quot;? (43333) which was a score across the screen.<br/>
 He&#39;s become quite interested in numbers and words (constant &quot;what&#39;s<br/>
that say).   This week has been about 12-hours/day of games.  I cringe<br/>
when I write that, yet I see it being about so much more.  Am I<br/>
blinded?  Cuz I keep telling myself it&#39;s all good.  Please talk to me<br/>
people.  Help me regain may sanity!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds wonderful to me!  Oh wait...sounds like my house!  At least<br/>
when we get a new game or two.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve found it goes in spurts.  New games bring about marathon<br/>
playing, then there is that wonderful feeling of &quot;Done!&quot; that comes<br/>
when the credits role and the last boss has been defeated, and a sigh<br/>
of contentment escapes and the games are put down for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you are in the middle of a &quot;spurt&quot;.  Bet when the weather<br/>
warms up and the games aren&#39;t so new, they will move on to other things.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe if you are getting cabin fever, take an afternoon and go to<br/>
the zoo or the playground.  The games will still be there when they<br/>
get home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005622020">If it&#39;s a problem, we&#39;ve got the same one;-)<br/>
<br/>
My Dh and Ds will spend pretty much all day playing video games <br/>
sometimes for long stretches on end. Right now they aren&#39;t because <br/>
they&#39;re spending most of their days with BrikWars. And we just found <br/>
a game called Battle Ball (board type game with dice and ugly <br/>
looking figures and &#39;carnage markers&#39; that is sort of like football <br/>
or rugby but not exactly) that is likely to become a big time <br/>
occupation (I like it too which is nice, I can&#39;t do videogames, I <br/>
get motion sick with most of the ones they like). BTW DS is 7 1/2. <br/>
He&#39;s been playing gameboy and videogames since he was 5, smack in <br/>
the middle of the same age group as your boys. Sometimes he did/does <br/>
play for hours on end. Other times not. They also like Age of <br/>
Empires 1,2,3 and StarCraft and can play them (and the scenario <br/>
editors that come with them) for hours. <br/>
<br/>
So far as I can see, when they&#39;ve had enough they do something else. <br/>
Kind of like hot dogs - sometimes DS eats 4 at a sitting, sometimes <br/>
he opts to just have a salad instead. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not insane (okay well maybe you are but this isn&#39;t a symptom <br/>
of it! lol)<br/>

It won&#39;t be forever.<br/>
<br/>
If they were reading that much, or playing soccer that much, you&#39;d  <br/>
probably be proud and not worried.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119234651">I asked on the Always Unschooled list some weeks ago for advice about  <br/>
helping my 4 y.o., who was interested in video games but not skilled,  <br/>
get skilled. We ended up buying a Game Cube in the post-Christmas  <br/>
glut of old video game systems on eBay. Eric&#39;s skill with the  <br/>
controller improved immensely in one morning with his Daddy and a kid- <br/>
appropriate game. Now he&#39;s really into Animal Crossing and plays  <br/>
several sessions a day. I think it&#39;s great because:<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s wanting to be a homebody lately and this is one more option for  <br/>
the days we&#39;re spending at home.<br/>
<br/>
He and his dad are having sweet times together. My partner is so  <br/>
patient with Eric when he just wants to wander around digging holes,  <br/>
or go in and out of his house, or try on all  his outfits one after  <br/>
another. I need to work on gaining more patience with this kind of  <br/>
stuff myself. But we&#39;ve all been enjoying our time together playing  <br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
He is also using the game to gain all kinds of skills, including:<br/>
<br/>
map reading<br/>
<br/>
reading (already he can recognize some of the repetitive words and  <br/>
phrases that show up in the dialogues. We read the rest to him.)<br/>
<br/>
problem-solving<br/>
<br/>
making plans and strategizing (the other day he said to me as I was  <br/>
playing, &quot;If you go over the bridge instead, you can drop the comic  <br/>
book off at Candi&#39;s on your way to Doc&#39;s,&quot; or some such)<br/>
<br/>
finances (he&#39;s got a mortgage to pay off on his little house!)<br/>
<br/>
number recognition; dealing with different magnitudes of numbers (in  <br/>
the hundreds and thousands)<br/>
<br/>
The conventions of video games<br/>
<br/>
He has also brought from the game into the real world:<br/>
<br/>
A complex game with his little brother of delivering things to  <br/>
imaginary friends all over the house.<br/>
<br/>
Wanting to write and receive notes (characters in the game write  <br/>
letters to each other)<br/>
<br/>
An interest in going to a real museum like the one in the game.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, it&#39;s all good.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not blinded--you&#39;ve managed to let go of ideas that aren&#39;t  <br/>
useful for you. You can see what is right in front of you--that your  <br/>
kids are having a great time and doing great. Good for you.<br/>
