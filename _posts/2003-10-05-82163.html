<div id="ygrps-yiv-810669403">My 10yod is interested in doing on-line chatting.  Are there any unschool kid chats?  Or even relaxed homeschool kid chats?  She tried Homeschool Kids Around the World, but most of the kids there are heavily &quot;curriculumated&quot;.  I don&#39;t know if she would qualify for the new unschool teen list, as she isn&#39;t quite a teen.<br/>

btw.  He&#39;s always looking for new chat buddies, maybe they could get together <br/>
online.  Email me off list?  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and he likes the Unschooling Message Board, she could meet people there.  <br/>
There&#39;s a kid page.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948822412">my son, Erik is 10, if she would like to talk. I am a believer in <br/>
unschooling, but he asks for &quot;lessons&#39; all the time. so I bought an online program to use <br/>
when he wants his history or science lesson. i dont know if that makes him an <br/>
schooler and me an unschooler.??? when he asks to make up his own lesson, i <br/>
always back away. i figure he will give up his lessons eventually, or take them <br/>
over himself some day.<br/>

Has she tried the kids&#39; message boards at unschooling.com?  Dagny&#39;s 10, and<br/>
she likes them.  If she&#39;d like to talk to Dagny, let me know. She&#39;s always<br/>

And Moly is nine, almost ten, and she is always looking for other kids to <br/>
chat or email with. She often emails Sandra&#39;s daughter, who has never met Moly <br/>
IRL, but always responds, and Moly loves that! So if she wants, I will post <br/>
Moly&#39;s email too.<br/>

If she has AOL or AIM, and if she wants to pick a time, others could probably <br/>
join her.  Marty and Holly might be interested.  They can both get on at the <br/>
same time.  She would need to have the addresses of the people (or they would <br/>
need hers) so she could invite them into a private chatroom.<br/>
<br/>
As to online chats in pre-existing places, outside AOL I don&#39;t know how it <br/>
works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819861292">I told Lisa that some kids with parents on the unschoolingdiscussion list were interested in chatting or IMing, and she is really excited.<br/>
<br/>
We are usually home on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday mornings, so she could be on-line anytime during 9-12 am Pacific time.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone else like to choose an hour or so from that window, and those interested could do a chat this week?<br/>
<br/>
I will need to do some research on how AOL interacts with other chats.  We have a &quot;trial&quot; with AOL, so that would work for her.  Can folks outside of AOL join in too?<br/>
<br/>
I can help her set it up if even one other person is interested in that time frame, but more could be even more fun.<br/>

If you don&#39;t cancel out before the month is over, they&#39;ll charge you, I <br/>
think.  <br/>
<br/>
Others can get a free AIM account if they want. I&#39;ve set them up when <br/>
visiting friends and its pretty easy to do!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s at aol.com.<br/>
