<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758785588">Hi!<br/>
I was one of those moms who complained about my 13 yo son&#39;s interest <br/>
in computer games.  Well, now that I am into the unschooling mode, I <br/>
decided to take the time to find out what they were about.  Man, they <br/>
are not easy to play! OK..no complaints from me anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe people who have gamers in their house can post some of their <br/>
favorite games. I&#39;d like to get a few for Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hey Deana,<br/>
<br/>
The games are pretty challenging, aren&#39;t they!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
To give you a good answer could you tell us what system(s) you guys have?  Just the computer, or does he have video game systems as well?  Sorry if I missed that bit of info somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
For the computer my son just loved Age of Mythology, which lead to Age of Empires, to a lesser extent.  He&#39;s much more into video games though so I could have lots of RPG suggestions if you have any Nintendo systems.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035563451">Marty says &quot;Morrowind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not such an RPG, more shoot&#39;em up he says, but Battlefield 1942.<br/>
Has real WWII scenarios, though, he says.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s the best first-person shooter out right now, in my opinion.<br/>
If you find a car, you can jump in and drive it.<br/>
If you find a plane, you can fly it.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23351356">Marty says all this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Diablo and Diablo II.<br/>
<br/>
By a company called Blizzard.  <br/>
They make Starcraft, Warcraft and BLizzard.<br/>
<br/>
They have free online play.  You can play other people online and you don&#39;t <br/>
have to pay for it.  You get online and go to multiplayer, and it will go by <br/>
itself to battle.net.   But if he&#39;s into RPGs, Diablo would probably be the <br/>
best.  Diablo II is a separate game, and it also has an expansion.  You have to <br/>
have Diablo II to play the Diablo expansion, but you don&#39;t need Diablo to play <br/>
Diablo II.  (They&#39;re separate games.)<br/>
