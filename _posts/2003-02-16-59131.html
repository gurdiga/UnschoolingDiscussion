&lt;&lt;There don&#39;t need to be a million rules, just-----what&#39;s the word???? (I&#39;m <br/>
tired, forgive me!)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Principles involving courtesy and respect.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s from a January post I just came to as I was pulling to save the <br/>
spanking discussions (good parts, not every word).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling involves the principle of trusting kids to learn and to make <br/>
decisions.  <br/>
Living with other people without rules involves the principles of courtesy <br/>
and respect.<br/>
<br/>
Removing the rules without replacing them with a set of workable and working <br/>
principles won&#39;t benefit a family.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Instead of one day announcing that *you can now watch<br/>
all the TV you want*, we gradually loosened the strings by saying yes if<br/>
they *asked* to watch more. (They didn&#39;t ask often because they were used to<br/>
watching their favorite shows and turning it off.)  While occasionally they<br/>
will spend the better part of  the day watching TV, most of the time they<br/>
watch little and often none. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That was from today.  <br/>
<br/>
Same at our house, but we were dealing with toddlers.  It was healing for me, <br/>
after a regulated childhood with punishments and spankings and such, to say <br/>
yes.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby would ask to do something my first response deep inside was to <br/>
figure out how to say no, just to keep my own butt at rest.  I hated that <br/>
first response!!  It was a reflection of every lazy-ass cigarette smoking and <br/>
beer drinking west Texas mom I had ever seen or been related to when I was <br/>
Kirby&#39;s age.   There was truly a lot of memory-flash of being little when I <br/>
had little kids.<br/>
<br/>
There are good and bad points of having vivid emotional memories.<br/>
<br/>
So I would say &quot;NO&quot; to that lazy internal mom-dialog, and yes to Kirby.<br/>
Unless there was a real safety consideration or something was impossible, I <br/>
would say yes.  And even sometimes the safety consideration is just that the <br/>
kid can&#39;t do the desired thing alone, but needs an adult to hold them, or <br/>
hold the scissors, or plug something in, or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I made it my priority to provide him with a rich and happy life.  That turned <br/>
into unschooling easily.  And it made MY life richer and happier than it <br/>
would have been if I&#39;d just sat at a table doing whatever I wanted to do, <br/>
telling my kids no, shut up, get out of here, I said no, because I said so.<br/>
<br/>
And even in parents who have never been that way, and never experienced that <br/>
(you&#39;re lucky if you&#39;re not quite believing me that there are moms like <br/>
that), another version of all that is saying &quot;eat this now, right here, all <br/>
of it; now watch your one half hour of TV; now read the book I chose for you; <br/>
now go to sleep.&quot;  It&#39;s sweeter and more socially acceptable, but it&#39;s still <br/>
a lot of &quot;no&quot; to them doing something different.<br/>
<br/>
Kids probably get more thrill from a mom saying &quot;yes&quot; 100 times and them <br/>
gradually figuring out that it&#39;s probably going to be yes the next time than <br/>
they would get from one big &quot;Yes&quot; all of a sudden.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can GUARANTEE there are at least four moms like that---my three <br/>
sisters-in-law and my mother-in-law---and I witnessed three of them AGAIN <br/>
today! :-(  <br/>
<br/>
No, because I said so. I said, &quot;NO!&quot; You can have the red cake AFTER you <br/>
clean you plate. No, eat every bite! OK, Three more beans, two more hams, and <br/>
a spoonful of rice (bigger than the child&#39;s MOUTH!). Don&#39;t do that. Because I <br/>
don&#39;t like it. On & on & on & on & on & on & on...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m home. My children are happy. And they&#39;re happy I&#39;m their mom! &lt;G&gt; <br/>

I was &quot;zenning&quot; all day trying to get through without blowing up. I was a <br/>
good girl. :-PPPP~~~~<br/>
