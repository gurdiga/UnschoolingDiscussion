<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718835199">** What if I came new to this list and said &quot;Okay, my kids are lazy<br/>
brats  and IF they stop talking back to me**<br/>
<br/>
(continuing hypothetical)<br/>
<br/>
And if I said &quot;Why do you call your kids brats?&quot; and &quot;Couldn&#39;t you think<br/>
about them in a more sympathetic and affectionate way?&quot; I&#39;d probably be<br/>
told that that was a slap in the face and a vicious attack.  But,<br/>
honestly, I can&#39;t think of a more gentle way to say it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else is welcome to try.  But I think some torqued up and guilty<br/>
feeling mom&#39;s have to be tip-tip-tippytoed around like a shallowly<br/>
buried mine field.<br/>
