very quickly. I guess capitals are just easier for younger kids to write.<br/>

     My 7 yod writes all in capitals too.  She gets very frustrated if I want <br/>
her to use lower-case letters.  She doesn&#39;t read yet either, but she loves to <br/>
sit and write stories.  She just constantly has to ask me how to spell each <br/>
word&lt;g&gt;  At least she doesn&#39;t have to then stop and say &quot;Mom, what does a B <br/>
look Like?&#39; like she used to do.  LOL Those were some very long stories (for <br/>
me at least).<br/>
      By the way, my husband still writes all in capitals and he went to <br/>
public school!  Who knows, maybe it is genetic?<br/>

My son not only writes in all capitals but doesn&#39;t reconize lowercase <br/>
letters. My question is; is this a problem?  I figure he will get it soon, <br/>
but does it matter?<br/>

     My daughter doesn&#39;t recognize all the lowercase letters either.  She <br/>
recognizes a few (like c, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, s, t, u, v, w, x, <br/>
y, z, which as you can see are very similar to their uppercase twins (except <br/>
for e and g which she has learned recently)).<br/>
My 13 year old son went to public school until 3rd grade.  He had trouble <br/>
with his letters even in 3rd grade.  He was still asking me how to make <br/>
certain letters when he wrote things, and his reading was terrible!  His <br/>
older brother had no problems with this, and his younger brother was reading <br/>
when he started Kindergarten---he taught himself---so I was really concerned <br/>
about him.  At that time, I had not read any of John Holts materials, or GWS, <br/>
I had never even heard of homeschooling (except for people that lived in the <br/>
Arctic!)<br/>
In the middle of 4th  grade, we pulled all of the kids out of school.  For a <br/>
few months we did school-at-home, which we quickly burned out on.  I spent <br/>
the summer reading anything I could on homeschooling, and found some books on <br/>
John Holt.  A strange thing was that my 4th grader found some books during <br/>
the summer also (the Boxcar Children, Animorphs, and others) and suddenly <br/>
took off reading.  Now he reads great, just like his two brothers.  Of <br/>
course, I never had one wait as long as my daughter is (she will be 8 in <br/>
October), but since I witnessed her brothers become strong readers on their <br/>
own, I am more calm and relaxed waiting for her to learn to read, then I <br/>
would have been with them.  (Except when my ps teacher parents begin to worry <br/>
out loud about how old she is and not reading!!!!&lt;g&gt;But that is just my old <br/>
insecurities popping up)<br/>
     I really think that your son will learn the lower case letters in time, <br/>
as he matures.  I don&#39;t think that you have anything to worry about.  Just <br/>
relax and enjoy your summer and go to the library and read alot together!<br/>
