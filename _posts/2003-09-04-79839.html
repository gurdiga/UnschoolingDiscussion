<div id="ygrps-yiv-302962963">It&#39;s my birthday today. I&#39;m 33 and I discovered 4 more gray hairs. Oh well, I can be philosophical about it. In the past eight months I have made so many changes in so many areas of my life and life has never been better. <br/>
<br/>
The best birthday present has been that my whole family has been more excited about my birthday than I have. Every night for the past week, Mia has been counting down the &#39;sleeps&#39; till the day arrives and talking about what we can do and what do I want.... This morning I woke up to three little faces beaming at me with presents and homemade cards and lots of hugs and kisses.  I realized how good my life is and how thankful I am to have pushed past the fear and discomfort of change.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone hear for the lively discussion that has helped me to do that. <br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s hard to show people the BIG indicators than unschooling works without <br/>
them looking like they think we don&#39;t know what &quot;education&quot; is all about <br/>
sometimes.  So unschoolers know the significance of what you&#39;re content about, but <br/>
outsiders might just wonder why you thought &quot;contentment&quot; was enough!<br/>
