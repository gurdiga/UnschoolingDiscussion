Petition to the US Supreme Court: We Are Outraged!!! <br/>
<br/>
To the US Supreme Court: We, the People, are outraged that you have <br/>
stopped the recount of uncounted votes in Florida. We will never accept a <br/>
President who is chosen by an incomplete count stopped by a partisan <br/>
Supreme Court decision led by judges appointed by the father of George W. <br/>
Bush. The eyes of the Nation and the World are on you. Count Every Vote!!! <br/>
Sign our petition and spread the word! <br/>
