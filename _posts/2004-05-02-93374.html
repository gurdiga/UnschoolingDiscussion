<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092301354">&quot;Yes we are in Florida.  We live in Jupiter which is in Palm Beach County.  <br/>
Who is Ren?  And where&#39;s the party :)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am Ren and the party is in Pensacola, October 7-9th of 2005 (subject to change until a venue is secured).<br/>
Did I miss a thread? I didn&#39;t see anything about a discussion of the beach party.<br/>

A new-ish poster mentioned living in Florida, and I (not so helpfully) <br/>
told her to mark her calendar for the beach party, but I didn&#39;t supply <br/>
the date.  (Didn&#39;t remember it.)<br/>
