<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834494216">If one is a truely independent thinker, then the answer is yes.  All<br/>
thought is influenced to some degree by ones surroundings and to a true<br/>
independent thinker, main stream life would only be something that one<br/>
takes what one needs from it and then tosses the rest aside.<br/>
<br/>
You can only &quot;encourage,&quot; not force.  So, if a child has the type of<br/>
personality that is not comfortable being a truely independent thinker,<br/>
then they won&#39;t.  We  can hope all we want but each child is an individual<br/>
and only so much of their growth and development is within our powers to<br/>
help or harm.  They have a core personality that is simply them and no<br/>
amount of outside influence, be it good or bad, is going to change the<br/>
essential them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-899993883">Attending the Gordon Neufeld parenting course has reinforced many observations we<br/>
have had about children generally.  He is absolutely intense about the need for<br/>
restricting peer interaction especially at younger ages but absolutely at older<br/>
ages too if need be.<br/>
<br/>
He describes the process of &quot;wooing&quot; children who have drifted from their<br/>
parents.  He took his adolescent daughter to a geographically isolated &quot;favorite&quot;<br/>
place, made sure the TV was broken, and lived with her bitter complaints of<br/>
boredom for about three days before he was able to reconnect with her.  They<br/>
reestablished the connection they had when she was a child and have never allowed<br/>
it to be broken again.  She is 27 now, studying music in Salzburg and still has a<br/>
&quot;special&quot; time with her father once a week by phone.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon believes that even with adolescents there is a need to restrict peer<br/>
interaction.  He believes in taking a proactive stance of organizing activity for<br/>
families which brings them together.<br/>
<br/>
It is of course complicated when the children in question are &quot;defended&quot;.<br/>
Meaning that they have hardened, lost their sensitivities and resist attachment<br/>
driven relationships (except for the primarily sterile substitutes they have<br/>
found with peers).<br/>
<br/>
I think if I found myself with teenagers who were being absorbed by peer culture<br/>
I would do whatever was necessary to break the cycle. This would include moving<br/>
if that is what it took.  Spending lots of time with them is a key.  If they are<br/>
peer identified this of course is the last thing they want to do.  It has to be a<br/>
process of wooing with the velvet glove being foremost with iron resolve beneath<br/>
but not a fist.  If I am not mangling metaphors too badly.<br/>
<br/>
Defendedness occurs when attachment has been used as a weapon to manipulate<br/>
behaviour.  Separation, time-outs, &quot;consequences&quot; these result in emotional<br/>
desensitivty and take a lot of effort to undo.<br/>
<br/>
Children follow the lead of their parents naturally if parents understand the<br/>
developmental needs of their children.  Most people are terribly confused.<br/>
<br/>
People have come to accept &quot;typical&quot; behaviour as &quot;normal&quot; which is absolutely<br/>
not the case.<br/>
<br/>
Much of this language reflects Gordon Neufeld&#39;s approach. For us it is again<br/>
reinforcement for that which we hold true already.<br/>
<br/>
Being proactive and defining your families &quot;life&quot; to reflect your values is<br/>
crucial.  It must be done with sensitivity and respect but with insistence.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;wooing&quot; which comes automatically with infants cannot be abandoned with<br/>
older children.  I have first hand experienced this change in my own<br/>
relationships with my children. If I bring the same &#39;focus&#39; to bear with my six<br/>
and ten year olds that I had when they were babies we do great.  It is a kind of<br/>
enthusiasm and willingness to accommodate their needs, listen to them with<br/>
enormous sensitivity and spend lots of voluntary time with them.<br/>
<br/>
People are fooled by the superficial independence of peer identified children.<br/>
They have less &quot;work&quot; as parents because their kids seem to &quot;take care&quot; of<br/>
themselves.  It is, of course, a lie.  They don&#39;t take care of themselves they<br/>
try to meet their attachment needs with peers which is an empty pursuit which<br/>
leaves them hungry and addicted to peer interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the economic smoke and mirrors we live in doesn&#39;t help.  The fact that<br/>
it now takes two incomes to maintain what we have come to expect as a normal<br/>
lifestyle further erodes home life.  We are told we live in boom times but North<br/>
Americans work more hours than any industrialized country.  We are blind to the<br/>
enormous decline in our standard of living as we revel in the booming economy.<br/>
The rich continue to become richer, democracy wilts, and in the midst of this<br/>
people try to have a &quot;home&quot;.  It is not a wonder that it is hard to create a home<br/>
in the midst of intellectual and ethical poverty.<br/>
<br/>
So spare no expense. Do what it takes. Challenge those assumptions that keep<br/>
things the same....employment, location, &quot;friends in the neighborhood&quot;, whatever<br/>
keeps a person from exercising the freedom that they still have.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I am on topic or not any more.<br/>

   <br/>
    My oldest is 15 and it has made a HUGE difference.  He is a much more <br/>
independent thinker than I was at his age and than other highschoolers I know <br/>
are.  Also, we helped take my niece out of school a year and a half ago when <br/>
she was almost 17 and she has really changed a lot since then.  At that time, <br/>
she used drugs, saw herself as a totally non-academic &quot;dumb&quot; (her word) <br/>
person, and had a lot of friends in gangs.  Since then, she has become a <br/>
person who stays home a lot, reads things that she finds interesting, doesn&#39;t <br/>
do drugs, and has stopped hanging out with her gang friends because she just <br/>
feels like she doesn&#39;t relate to them very well now.  She&#39;s in her last year <br/>
of unschooling high school and she&#39;s actually enjoying it.<br/>
    A lot of our relatives were ready to write her off and when she first <br/>
stayed with us, I would sometimes wonder if it was too late, but she proved <br/>
everyone wrong.  She is still finding her way in life but I believe she has a <br/>
much better chance for happiness now.  <br/>
    I&#39;m sure your kids are not in the deep trouble she was in so I think <br/>
their chances of becoming free independent thinkers are excellent.  It is <br/>
easy to have doubts and I&#39;ve had many of them myself over the years (and many <br/>
more to come, I&#39;m sure) but just let the time go by, do the best you can, and <br/>
I know you&#39;ll come to a point where you realize how far you&#39;ve all come.  <br/>
Take care...<br/>

    Well, if your not on topic I&#39;ll be off with you. This is a subject near <br/>
and dear to my heart at the moment. I wrote earlier that my dh had agreed to <br/>
let me take an extended vacation, possibly in Fla. since I have a friend down <br/>
there. We had discussed the possibility of pulling the 16yro out of school to <br/>
go. Florida mainly because I&#39;m not sure much else would tempt him to leave <br/>
all behind. I feel this desperate to remove him from what I consider a <br/>
depressing, hopeless school environment. He won&#39;t willingly homeschool  but I <br/>
had hoped I could get him to agree to American school or something so he <br/>
would know he could possible go back if he wanted next fall.<br/>
    My hope is that he would get beyond that though. He doesn&#39;t need many <br/>
more credits for a diploma. (we&#39;re talking diploma not an education, he is <br/>
NOT being educated at present in ps, just warehoused). I know this is a long <br/>
shot but I really don&#39;t know what else to do. <br/>
    Not even sure this is doable, dh worries that something will happen to us <br/>
and I would worry too in his place. I would call this forced helplessness.<br/>
    I am very glad for your post. I needed the encouragement to believe that <br/>
I can still possibly do something. Where do I find more info about the <br/>
workshop you attended? Has he wrote a book?<br/>
Sorry so long.<br/>

<br/>
Can you please elaborate on what you mean when you say that &quot;separation,<br/>
time out, and consequences result in emotional desensitivity&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I have three children, ages 11, 7, 4, and one on the way.  I always thought<br/>
I was ahead of the game by not spanking my children, but instead talking<br/>
with them a lot about and modeling what behavior was expected.  I think I<br/>
might be able to understand how &quot;time out&quot; can be damaging, but I cannot<br/>
fathom how consequences can be detrimental, other than overuse, and as I am<br/>
sometimes guilty of, using a consequence as a punishment even while calling<br/>
it a consequence.<br/>
<br/>
How can we possibly raise our children to be responsible adults without<br/>
offering them some consequences for their behavior?  How can we teach our<br/>
children without relying on their need to please us?  I never before<br/>
considered that manipulative.  But something about your statements struck<br/>
me, so I assume I must feel I can do a better job than I am currently doing.<br/>
I would love to hear more details on this subject.<br/>
<br/>
I have been intrigued by so much of what I have read since joining this list<br/>
about two weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
By way of introduction, we have always homeschooled, but this is the first<br/>
year that I have considered unschooling.  My children are greatly enjoying<br/>
the varied choices available to them with the extra time afforded by<br/>
skipping the &quot;busy work&quot; I felt compelled to give them up until this point.<br/>
We are not true unschoolers yet, but I am comfortable with the changes I<br/>
have made so far!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>

a home<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112855317">Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like you are on the right track to me but I will expand on what<br/>
I think Gordon Neufeld is talking about it with the proviso that I could be off<br/>
base and not know it.<br/>
<br/>
He believes that we have the power and influence because of instinctual<br/>
attachment on the part of our children.  He believes that if attachment needs<br/>
are used to manipulate behaviour it causes children to experience enormous<br/>
anxiety which they of necessity desensitize themselves to feeling.  Examples<br/>
would be separation. &quot;You go to your room.&quot; I don&#39;t want to see you around here<br/>
until..... If you go on behaving that way I am just going to ......  Don&#39;t talk<br/>
to me.....  Things which involve withdrawal of affection.  He is of course<br/>
advocating something hard to do namely don&#39;t let your emotions get the better of<br/>
you.  He also talks of the necessity for lots of proximity, generously given<br/>
time, expressions of delight in our children not when they are &quot;being good&#39; or<br/>
when they accomplish something but when they are just being.<br/>
<br/>
It is the punitive edge of &quot;consequences&quot; to which I believe he is referring.<br/>
If there are natural consequences to someone&#39;s behaviour and they are able to<br/>
handle the consequences it is fine.  You don&#39;t let the 18 month old tumble down<br/>
the hillside to learn about the consequences of going too far from their<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
You of course are &quot;way ahead&quot; by not spanking and talking lots and modeling what<br/>
you believe.<br/>
<br/>
As for teaching our children we do in fact rely on their desire to please us but<br/>
always with the utmost care, respect and thoughtfulness.  We have enormous power<br/>
and if we use it to manipulate our kids behaviour simply to get our way we will<br/>
lose it.<br/>
<br/>
People use to (and probably many still do) use threats of fearful things to get<br/>
behaviour they want from their children.  The bogeyman et. al. were used in many<br/>
circles as what was considered a valid form of childrearing.  You scared the<br/>
children into obedience.  Of course eventually they weren&#39;t scared anymore and<br/>
told you to bugger off not to mention feeling more than a little angry and at<br/>
being lied to and frightened.<br/>
<br/>
Gordon Neufeld is really quite big on adults &quot;taking charge&quot;.  More than I am<br/>
comfortable with but I understand his rationale.  He believes that we must<br/>
engage our children&#39;s attachment needs and meet them or they will attach to<br/>
others (usually peers) and will be lost to us.<br/>
<br/>
He maintains that emergent behaviours (independence and individuality) come in<br/>
their own sweet time and we are generally in much too great of a rush for such<br/>
things.  We value a great deal of superficial sociability in the place of real<br/>
intimacy and connectedness.  Peer interaction comes naturally at its own pace<br/>
and always within the context of a solid home base never as a substitute.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much material that has been covered I am hard pressed to do it<br/>
justice.  I just know that bunches of it are of great use to me.<br/>
<br/>
I will continue try and get the stuff onto a web site and give people access to<br/>
it that way.  It provides a much needed antidote to so much patently crazy stuff<br/>
being suggested for parents.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the folks on this list seem to have already come to grips with many of<br/>
these concepts and know that to simply rely on experts instead of their own gut<br/>
feelings is an iffy proposition at best.<br/>
<br/>
I am tired and have to go to work early so I must close though I have not said<br/>
half of what I mean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335230775">Thanks Joel, for the clarification.  Can&#39;t wait for the website to be up and<br/>
running.   It is much nicer to have a professional back up what we already<br/>
do as parents, especially when we are taking an uncharted course, rather<br/>
than follow the so called &quot;parenting experts&quot;.<br/>

Joel...<br/>
By &quot;taking charge&quot; here, do you mean Neufeld thinks parents should be the one <br/>
to set the agenda...to set the stage, so to speak?   Or are you talking about <br/>
the adult taking the responsibility to &quot;be there&quot; as much as possible?  Or <br/>
maybe neither of those two things.  If you don&#39;t mind, I would love you to <br/>
clarify this.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Gordon Neufeld is really quite big on adults &quot;taking charge&quot;.  More than I <br/>
am<br/>
 comfortable with but I understand his rationale. &gt;&gt;<br/>
You also wrote:<br/>
&lt;&lt; He believes that we must<br/>

 others (usually peers) and will be lost to us. &gt;&gt;<br/>
This makes a whole lot of sense to me because I see it in my own life.  I <br/>
still, at age 38, am seeking approval and acceptance from my mother that I <br/>
desperately want, and feel like I have to go everywhere else to get it.  And <br/>
this feeling of longing to be noticed is very implanted in me.<br/>
I was involved in many dangerous activities as a college student and older <br/>
teen and looking back, all those things scream out...PAY ATTENTION.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I was seeking attention from the wrong people.<br/>
Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to get off on such an self-analytical bent, but these <br/>
theories fascinate me.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re putting into words, things that I&#39;ve <br/>
always intuited!<br/>
Thanks again, Joel!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343521444">I think that  Neufeld is referring both to setting agendas, defining things and<br/>
being there.  You really have a much harder time doing the defining sorts of<br/>
things if you are not there more often than not.  He returns to this theme quite<br/>
a bit.  It really also has to do with being proactive towards children.  Not just<br/>
reacting to what they do but to their &quot;just being&quot;.  It involves making a big<br/>
deal over them and engaging them.  We do this automatically with babies but have<br/>
more trouble doing it as they get older.  Just remember that feeling you have<br/>
towards babies.... focus, total wonderment, etc. and find it with your kids when<br/>
they are older.  That seems to be the heart of it.<br/>
<br/>
He talks about &quot;passing the attachment baton&quot; when leaving your kids in the care<br/>
of someone else.  By this he means introductions and orientation. e.g. This Betty<br/>
who is going to be looking after you. Betty this is Olivia who you will be<br/>
looking after. Olivia, Betty will be showing you what you need to do here and if<br/>
you have any questions you will ask Betty.  Words to that effect.  It requires<br/>
the adult caregiver to make an effort to get to know the child and pay direct<br/>
attention to that child.  Some people do this well and intuitively others are<br/>
thick as bricks and just don&#39;t get it.  If it is done successfully the child has<br/>
much less anxiety and knows who to orient themselves around.<br/>
<br/>
It is so hard to do this stuff justice.  We are going to session #8 tomorrow<br/>
(tonight really).  That will make 16 hours of material and he is always behind<br/>
where he wants to be.  Really what he is talking about could be a degree program<br/>
as far as I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
Our experience in this class is very much one of having someone put into words<br/>
and a theoretical model much of which we know intuitively.  It is nice to have<br/>
&quot;academic&quot;  and &quot;professional&quot; support for what we know.  Though at this point in<br/>
our lives we don&#39;t really care what the experts think because they are so<br/>
confused on so many issues.  The fact that there are a few who aren&#39;t is nice but<br/>
really just frosting on the cake.<br/>
Got to go.<br/>
