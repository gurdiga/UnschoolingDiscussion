&gt; helping women to see they do have choices. It sounds like what your focus <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; fits so well in with unschooling. Do you have the opportunity to turn <br/>
&gt; people <br/>
&gt; on to unschooling/homeschooling with  what you do?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes I do mary and constantly... When I&#39;m talking to clients and they have <br/>
children I always ask them what they are hoping to achieve by putting their <br/>
children in institutions?  It&#39;s interesting to hear the answers and then to <br/>
give them information about homeschooling/unschooling and hear their fears <br/>
(which is basically about having no control).... I usually tell them, it&#39;s <br/>
just something to think about.  I remember that movie with Billy Crystal and <br/>
Meg Ryan where he said &quot;it&#39;s out there, you&#39;ve already said it, you can&#39;t <br/>
take it back, because it&#39;s out there&quot;... That&#39;s the way I feel about giving <br/>
information out.  My clients may chose not to do anything about the <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling but now they know about it and can&#39;t forget that I <br/>
said it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep I see what you mean. . . I had a situation where I thought my BIL & SIL <br/>
might be thinking about homeschooling, so I sent some links to them. They <br/>
have two year old twins.  Turns out they are now in &quot;pre-school&quot;. But, here <br/>
is the key . . . the mom has some serious mental illness problems, and I <br/>
think it is probably better that these kids do go to school. The very sad <br/>
thing is that BIL does not need to work. . . they have a trust fund that <br/>
supports them, but he does work. . . doing church work for inner city kids, a <br/>
very noble thing, but meanwhile his own kids are in emotional neglect, and <br/>
sometime physical neglect. Anyway, my point is, the information is given, <br/>
with no attachments to the results. <br/>
