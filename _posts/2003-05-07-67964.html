<div id="ygrps-yiv-437413422">Oooooooh....   <br/>
Cold, but not even a stretch.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The other has three girls, all in public school.   When she would start<br/>
with the &quot;aren&#39;t you afraid he won&#39;t know how to talk to kids his own<br/>
age&quot;  stuff I would say, in a most sympathetic and concerned way, that<br/>
I&#39;d just seen where two kids killed a classmate and a teacher was<br/>
arrested for sexual abuse of a student and a school had slime mold<br/>
contamination and how about that head lice out break and how sad her<br/>
middle daughter was being teased for being heavy and that must make her<br/>
feel sad as a parent, sending her off to school to be tortured and<br/>
humiliated everyday... and now I don&#39;t hear so much about what Dylan is<br/>
missing in public school.   Now I hear about what a happy kid I have and<br/>
how curious he is and how interested he seems in everything. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope her girls are given some slack and freedom to some degree because of <br/>
Dylan&#39;s example.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was Holly&#39;s last night at her modelling school.   I went in to <br/>
pick her up after their little party.  I wasn&#39;t sure what room they were in, <br/>
as it&#39;s a little warren of hallways and rooms, but I heard people saying <br/>
&quot;Bye, Holly!    Bye, Holly!&quot; and followed their voices. <br/>
<br/>
When I got in there she was engrossed in a conversation with the teacher and <br/>
wasn&#39;t even hearing people say bye, so I nudged her and indicated she was <br/>
ignoring people (irritating mom behavior) and she said bye.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher gushed and gushed (as usual, but with more feeling) and I told <br/>
her Holly would really like to babysit sometime or even just get to hang out <br/>
with her kid (who&#39;s just two) and she lit up,  which made Holly feel great, <br/>
because she likes that teacher and loves to be around kids, and she had <br/>
forgotten to ask for  a babysitting consideration (though she had told me she <br/>
was going to).<br/>
<br/>
Holly had made little business cards, by hand, on the halves of cardboard <br/>
backing that come from vending machine stickers.  She bought more stickers <br/>
just to get more cardboard.  So she had given out her webpage, e-mail address <br/>
and phone number to every kid in class, and the teacher.    That was entirely <br/>
her idea.  And she had taken one of my business cards to give the teacher, <br/>
who has expressed an interest in homeschooling, just because of Holly, and <br/>
because of materials I gave them to read when Holly was first there and they <br/>
said and did some things I wasn&#39;t comfortable with, when Holly wasn&#39;t reading <br/>
well and didn&#39;t have school experiences the other kids had.<br/>
<br/>
She almost forgot about her cards, she said, but they were doing a game in <br/>
which each kid said something nice about each other kid, and when one boy <br/>
told a girl that he liked her because she had given him her phone number and <br/>
now he could tell the boys at school that he had a girl&#39;s phone number (!!), <br/>
Holly said &quot;Oh!  A girl&#39;s phone number?  Here, have mine too&quot; and passed them <br/>
out all around.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the bad thing that happened that night.  I heard it from Holly and <br/>
the teacher separately so I have a more 3-d picture than Holly has, though <br/>
Holly experienced it directly.  <br/>
<br/>
The manager of the site (school and agency) saw Holly&#39;s wild sculpted haircut <br/>
(which now has the front right corner shaved to the skin--Holly&#39;s doing), and <br/>
was NOT nice about it.  Asked Holly WHAT she had done to her HAIR and told <br/>
her that if she wanted them to get her work she couldn&#39;t do things like that <br/>
to her hair, and to let it grow out.  To the teacher she had said that they <br/>
couldn&#39;t place Holly unless she had natural little girl hair, and she needed <br/>
to get a good haircut, a headshot, and then KEEP her hair that way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not even NEARLY going to tell Holly to keep her hair to suit the cranky <br/>
manager of a pissant modelling agency which has more disorganization in one <br/>
day than Holly sees in a month at home, which did NOT have any interest (as a <br/>
school) in bending anything to suit a homeschooler, and blah blah, I&#39;ll quit.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wasn&#39;t upset.  She was amused and confident.<br/>
<br/>
So how can someone REALLY think that being in a classroom where there are <br/>
small, lame right answers and where kids aren&#39;t even allowed to &quot;socialize&quot; <br/>
with kids one grade up or down from them would have an easier time &quot;talking <br/>
to kids their own age&quot;?  Those are the only kids they ever GET to talk to, <br/>
and WHEN they&#39;re allowed to talk, much of what they say isn&#39;t very nice <br/>
because they&#39;re cooped up together agains their will with no escape.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile Holly and thousands of unschoolers are interacting with people who <br/>
are younger, and older, who go to school, who don&#39;t, who are clueless and <br/>
not, and so talking to kids who happen to be their own age is a snap, AND <br/>
they actually have something to talk about besides &quot;what grade are you in?&quot; <br/>
and &quot;what math are you doing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She can stand up to being criticized by a shrill and twitchy talent agent, <br/>
and come away smiling and shaking her head at how little an adult can really <br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
Marty stood calmly while a twitchy two-year military vet criticized him for <br/>
wearing camouflage pants, in a thrift store.  Came away smiling and shaking <br/>
his head.<br/>
<br/>
These kids are FINE.  They are more than fine.  They&#39;re real and they&#39;re <br/>
confident.  They&#39;re living outside the little box, with its fifteen <br/>
chit-chatty dialogs (fifteen?  Maybe, including &quot;what are you going to make <br/>
with that?  that&#39;s a lot of cloth&quot; which I was asked at the cutting table at <br/>
the fabric store, and because I didn&#39;t like the tone, which implied I was an <br/>
idiot to want 12 yards of something, I just looked at the girl until she <br/>
looked and then looked away.  Sometimes I&#39;m glad to tell someone what I&#39;m <br/>
going to make, but I&#39;m not answerable to her.  What I said was &quot;Is there 18 <br/>
yards?&quot;  (I had asked for all that was left on a sale bolt.)  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, 12 and a half.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well I wish it were 18, but I can use it anyway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re making tents.  But she was unworthy to know that. &lt;bwg&gt;  She can&#39;t get <br/>
from the box she&#39;s in to where our tents are, or WHY we care how those tents <br/>
are constructed.  <br/>
<br/>
If Holly had been with me, she would probably have chattered away about <br/>
center-pole tents and Viking tents with two oars and ropes.   And the woman <br/>
would have gazed at her as though she were uttering Czechoslovakian recipes, <br/>
in Czech.<br/>

Sometimes it&#39;s like being on another plane of existence.<br/>

My children are still in the younger category. (Oldest is Katy, 11)  But<br/>
&quot;another plane of existence&quot; is something zI say frequently to describe<br/>
how I feel about the way my family lives.  I have to try to remember<br/>
when and find ways to interact with the different planes&quot;...or maybe<br/>
I&#39;ll just keep being who I am and growing how we are and maybe somebody<br/>
around here (meaning geographically) will want to join us!<br/>

Was she the clerk, or the person behind you in line?<br/>
Sometimes standing in line is boring and the chatty among us want to<br/>
talk, or (in my case) amuse ourselves by speculating about what the<br/>
person in front of us is buying.<br/>
<br/>
On one memorable occasion, in college, the person in front of us who was<br/>
buying an entire cartload of salt claimed it was to perform taxidermy on<br/>
a gorilla.  That was startling!<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe I&#39;m ridiculously gullible.  Any taxidermists on this list?)<br/>

The clerk who was cutting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had some great long conversations with people about costuming and other <br/>
uses for swimsuit material and corn bags and all kinds of stuff, but her tone <br/>
of voice and demeanor were more like I was clueless and she was bored with <br/>
having to deal with the clueless cloth-buying public.<br/>

Maybe I could adapt that line next time I&#39;m buying a bunch of cloth.  <br/>
&quot;Do you have salt and a coathanger too?  I&#39;m going to mummify a gorilla.&quot;<br/>
