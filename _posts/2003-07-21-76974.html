<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214017341">Has anyone else who&#39;s signed on to the other lists notice how little traffic <br/>
they&#39;ve gotten? I don&#39;t have one post for any of my new secondary lists in <br/>
days. <br/>
<br/>
I think this list is *by far* THE list left for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just disappointed it has a new name. Now I can&#39;t use <br/>
&quot;unschoolingdotcomedians&quot;. :-(<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, sorry to have the splits</div>

Oh, you mean the lists!<br/>
<br/>
If there are options and people only use one of them is that the same as<br/>
only having one option?<br/>
<br/>
If the other lists aren&#39;t used and this one still is then it does say<br/>
something about this list. One thing that it perhaps says is that the things<br/>
people dislike the most about this list are the same things that are<br/>
responsible for the things people do like.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s been a pretty obvious conclusion to come to to anyone who has<br/>
followed the saga of the &quot;kinder gentler&quot; lists that have been started over<br/>
the years as a reaction to this list.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s summer. Maybe the traffic on all the HEM lists<br/>
is down. <br/>
