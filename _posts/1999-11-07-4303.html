<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054194062"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Rambling it may be, but I really liked what you had to say. I have had<br/>
&gt;squirmy feelings about unit studies. In some ways they are better than some<br/>
&gt;other types of &#39;school&#39; work but they always feel somewhat contrived to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes...I hear you! I have forked out some fairly hefty Canadian dollars on<br/>
unit studies that sound fabulous but the girls get turned off very quickly<br/>
by these now. I think that perhaps it is the fact that they are getting<br/>
older and realize that they can self-direct their learning. I am happy<br/>
about that ...so I am organizing a Used Curriculum Fair and will sell<br/>
everything &#39;unit-study-ish&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Before I got smart and figured this all out I purchased Beyond Five in a<br/>
ROw. The girls had loved Five in a ROw when they were younger so I just<br/>
figured they would love Beyond...<br/>
But things had changed. There were eye-rolls all around when I started in<br/>
with the Beyond Five in a Row. They had outgrown that type of adult-led<br/>
learning. They enjoy it when I facilitate, they don&#39;t mind when I suggest,<br/>
but they clearly don&#39;t like being led. <br/>
Book closed.  <br/>
