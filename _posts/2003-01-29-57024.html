<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55876079">I need a creative idea for storing boots and shoes in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
WHen the kids come inside, they often come in through the kitchen.  I don&#39;t have a lot of room and I &#39;d like to be able to put their wet shoes somewhere that doesn&#39;t look like a pile of muck in the middle of the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have some easy ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

it.  In principle, mittens, scarves and soft stuff goes into the<br/>

I have an old Coke soda crate in my kitchen by the door. It is divided<br/>
into twelve sections, which  hold shoes up to size 4 neatly upright. On<br/>
particularly slushy days (like today) I throw a towel under the crate,<br/>
and the snow just melts through the planks onto the towel.<br/>

could put it on a mat to catch the water, and hang the shoes upside down<br/>
to dry out.  You could also make it whatever shape would fit best in<br/>
your space.  ~Rue<br/>

 How about some sort of bookshelf or maybe 1 or more of those little <br/>
stacking shelf unit things that come in different sizes? You know the <br/>
kind...with the white laminate or possibly some kind of wood look. <br/>
Maybe put some kind of sealer on the shelves first so the water <br/>
doesn&#39;t wreck them? Then an old towel on each shelf to help soak up <br/>
the yuck. <br/>
 I saw the idea with using pegs on a board and liked it but I was <br/>
thinking with kids around someone could fall on it and be hurt. And <br/>
at our house, the kids often have mud dripping so upside down would <br/>
spread the mess. <br/>
 What about a plastic (milk) crate for each persons boots? They could <br/>
even be stacked, tied together some cute way (um, fabric strips that <br/>
match your kitchen?) and anchored to the wall somehow to make it <br/>
safe. Again, lining the bottoms with old towels. <br/>
<br/>
Winter is so darn messy!! <br/>
