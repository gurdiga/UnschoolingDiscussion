<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104946207">A member of one of the e-mail lists to which I subscribe sent a message this<br/>
morning alerting me of the appearance of the latest edition of<br/>
&quot;Self-University Newsletter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let me strongly urge you to subscribe to this free quarterly web-based<br/>
newsletter (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.autodidactic.com/selfnews.htm)">http://www.autodidactic.com/selfnews.htm)</a>.  Charles Hayes and I<br/>
have been corresponding for some time now.  Hayes is perhaps our country&#39;s<br/>
best thinker on the subject of self-education.<br/>
<br/>
Try this morsel from his review of Morris Berman&#39;s new book &quot;The Twilight of<br/>
American Culture&quot; (New York: W.W. Norton, 2000)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;...[Berman]  points out that out of 158 countries we are 49th in literacy,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that 60 percent of our population has never read a book of any kind, that<br/>
the number of truly educated individuals in America may amount to less than<br/>
5 million people, and that liberal education is being commodified at the<br/>
university level into little more than another means of entertainment.<br/>
Indeed, at times it seems to me that the genuine end of history will find<br/>
America&#39;s epitaph amounting to little more than having become a colossal<br/>
theme park.<br/>
<br/>
Berman reminds us that &quot;&#39;consciousness&#39; gurus declare that we are in the<br/>
midst of a &#39;paradigm shift,&#39; and millions, who never managed to understand<br/>
the present paradigm, grunt the phrase like a mantra.&quot; As for remedy he puts<br/>
it this way, &quot;In terms of a future renewal, much of it will depend on a<br/>
commitment to individualism, something that has been much maligned in recent<br/>
years. We hear so much trendy, tedious talk today of how bad individualism<br/>
is, and how we need to think in terms of &#39;the group.&#39; The problem is that<br/>
the group usually offers conformity, not genuine community.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t miss this latest intellectual feast which Hayes has so freely served<br/>
up.  I promise you won&#39;t go away hungry.<br/>
