<div id="ygrps-yiv-172169268">Well, I for one am glad that you two can discuss this in such an open way. <br/>
It is not uncommon for some men to be uncomfortable with the whole nursing<br/>
thing.  AND, it is not uncommon for them to adjust to the idea once the<br/>
little one arrives.  So, his opinion may change once the major disruption<br/>
and all the changes that a pregnancy brings about are behind you and your<br/>
little bundle is actually here and not just a vision.  The concept is quite<br/>
different from the reality.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes and happy parenthood to you both!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; breastfeeding. We have talked about positives/negatives of it, and he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>knows<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all the feelings expressed here. I truly feel that he would be more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>confused<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; by this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>
&gt; feelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH<br/>
 </span></blockquote>would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>
&gt; thing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I just<br/>
&gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he may<br/>
&gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire<br/>
 </span></blockquote>process<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant<br/>
 </span></blockquote>without a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has been a<br/>
&gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>
&gt; feeding? I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that this<br/>
&gt; would now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in our<br/>
&gt; home.<br/>
&gt; Thank you for all your opinions-<br/>
