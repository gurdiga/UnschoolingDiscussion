<div id="ygrps-yiv-439748439">We are at a crossroads and not sure which way to go here.<br/>
<br/>
A little history: My 11yo has been in a private school since <br/>
kindergarten, has always had trouble dealing with homework and <br/>
worksheets and being told what to do. I think that&#39;s understandable. <br/>
We have offered him homeschooling/unschooling in the past but he has <br/>
been resistant to leave his school because of his friends. He blames <br/>
a lot of his problems on his private school and has been campaigning <br/>
to be allowed to attend public school. He doesn&#39;t take responsibility <br/>
for his role in his trouble (giving up at the first sign of <br/>
difficulty, etc.) We believe that public school will be at best a <br/>
waste of time, at worst a meat grinder which will grind him up and <br/>
spit him out in little pieces (pardon the disgusting analogy). (Of <br/>
course we would pull him from public school if any hint if the meat <br/>
grinder scenario became apparent.)<br/>
<br/>
He was SO upset last night about doing homework. He says he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to do ANYTHING, he just wants to sleep and read all the time and <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to be pushed into anything. He wants to spend his days <br/>
in the library. Frankly, that sounds FANTASTIC to me, I have no <br/>
problem with it. But he is still resistant to leaving school all <br/>
together. He actually said he&#39;s scared of not going to school now <br/>
because he&#39;ll end up flipping burgers some day. I just don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s right for an 11yo of his intelligence to be worrying about that <br/>
right now.....<br/>
<br/>
We told him that he can either stay in school and do what&#39;s expected, <br/>
in which case he can try public school in the fall, or he can leave <br/>
school now and commit to a year of unstructured learning, after which <br/>
he can return to school if he wants. I&#39;m hoping that he will make an <br/>
active decision, but I&#39;m worried that he is going to just let others <br/>
make the decision for him, which seems so disempowering......<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m looking for feedback here. Has anyone else dealt with a <br/>
kid who is miserable in school, but resistant to leaving school? Am I <br/>
dealing with Stockholm Syndrome here? (where kidnapped people begin <br/>
to sympathize with their captors)<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate any feedback, I&#39;m having a hard time here, I want <br/>
to do right by my incredible smart wonderful boy!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks--Margaret</div>

There are stories there that might help him.<br/>
You might also get a copy of The Teenage Liberation Handbook to read  <br/>
yourself or read good parts to him, or leave out where he might find  <br/>
it.  It doesn&#39;t need to be read front to back to be helpful.<br/>

<br/>
That sounds altogether harsh.<br/>
Why should he decide NOW what he has to do next fall?  If he leaves  <br/>
school, why should he have to commit to a year?<br/>
You&#39;re scaring him  unnecessarily.<br/>

Give him a gentle, honest, OPEN choice.<br/>

If he knows that he could come home tomorrow, school will be better  <br/>
for him.  In the meantime, you would do well to read more about  <br/>
unschooling in general.  The links above lead to lots of other links.<br/>

<br/>
Oh.  I wouldn&#39;t ask for a full year commitment for *either* public <br/>
school *or* for being at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be inclined to take an approach like this --<br/>
<br/>
   &quot;Yes, I think your private school gives too much homework.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think this is a good way for you to learn.  (optional: I believe you can <br/>
learn a lot going places with me and watching TV and reading and having <br/>
fun.)  I encourage you to take a vacation from school, starting now.  <br/>
Yes, if you want to try public school in September, you can try that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then I hope he takes your offer to be on vacation now, and I hope he <br/>
will chose to extend it indefinitely.  After the whole decompression <br/>
period of crashing on the couch, if he finds engrossing things to do and <br/>
people to do these things with, he will be more likely to chose to stay <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
Do discuss your thoughts about public school with him, but save it for a <br/>
few months from now when he&#39;s under less stress.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and maybe go to the unschooling conference with him if you are <br/>
anywhere within traveling distance of New Mexico.  Otherwise see if you <br/>
can meet some fascinating and accomplished unschoolers nearer to home.  <br/>
(Let them impress him with their knowledge and competence.  It&#39;ll scare <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596009933">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We told him that he can either stay in school and do what&#39;s expected, <br/>

make the decision for him, which seems so disempowering......&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t he go to public school at once? Maybe what is left of the year<br/>
(after Spring break) will enough to show him that public school is not what<br/>
he wants (or maybe it will be :/ ) but there is summer to look forward to so<br/>
very soon.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that way this coming summer vacation will last &quot;forever&quot; and this idea<br/>
of a new thing, a new place that he evidently expects might solve his<br/>
problems, will not be tainting what should be a wonderful time of relaxation<br/>
over summer.<br/>
<br/>
BTW one year (or any arbitrary time frame) of any kind of &quot;learning&quot; if it<br/>
has been constructed as a &quot;commitment&quot; that he is making to you could be a<br/>
barrier to actually getting to Unschooling with joy. <br/>
<br/>
Most children who have been in school need to decompress (&quot;Deschool&quot; as it<br/>
is called) for (approximately) one month per year of school attendance<br/>
before the *child* starts to show any kind of lively interest in anything<br/>
that looks remotely like learning to an adult.<br/>
<br/>
I think that you would be better removing any of the time pressures and<br/>
living in the present moment with him. What about just quietly fulfilling<br/>
the legal obligations for home schooling in your state (if possible) so that<br/>
you are then free to ask him each day if he wants to go to school &quot;today&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this &quot;do what&#39;s expected&quot; dictum is feeling like an ultimatum or<br/>
even abandonment to him. How could you support him being in a school where<br/>
he has his friends, but not enforce or support the &quot;do what&#39;s expected&quot;<br/>
part? (I don&#39;t have an answer to this question, I&#39;m putting out there as an<br/>
thinking tool).<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons to home school, let alone Unschool, is to avoid having to<br/>
answer to some one else&#39;s idea of what is &quot;expected&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
As for answering his fears for the future, you might get him Life Learning<br/>
magazine where Peter Kowalke publishes a column about the adult successes<br/>
(and challenges but they seem good) of formerly Unschooled kids or the book<br/>
&quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;. For a glimpse of his possible future you<br/>
could all come to the Conference in September:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558685236">&lt;&lt;&lt; We believe that public school will be at best a <br/>
waste of time &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here is another concept/hidden assumption that bears investigating if<br/>
Unschooling is going to blossom.<br/>
<br/>
Yes childhood is fleeting, but the idea that time spent by a child<br/>
investigating something they have asked for is &quot;wasted&quot;, because the<br/>
activity turns out to be later rejected, is one that could be a barrier to<br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It also implies a goal that public school will not be meeting. I&#39;m guessing<br/>
that your goal is having ds home, so from your pov, no PS won&#39;t be meeting<br/>
it. However it might meet your son&#39;s goals, temporarily, and might be easier<br/>
to walk away from too!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say that there are times Jayn is not going to stick with<br/>
something that she has started, but then I tried to think of an example and<br/>
couldn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know if she simply has stuck with everything, or if our<br/>
whole life and all our projects are so seamlessly &quot;ongoing&quot; that the concept<br/>
of wasted time is just not in existence.<br/>
<br/>
Ah! I&#39;ve remembered one.<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago Jayn did a couple of sessions of ice skating. We stopped going<br/>
half way through the second session (despite the $$$) because Jayn stopped<br/>
liking it. I don&#39;t consider the time wasted - and we will probably go again<br/>
soon too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498069389">I am very very grateful for the responses so far. Lots to think <br/>
about. I am really torn up by this whole thing--I just don&#39;t know <br/>
what&#39;s the right thing to do, and maybe I CAN&#39;T know, and that&#39;s hard <br/>
to accept when it&#39;s my boy we&#39;re talking about......<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I have and continue to read Teenage Liberation Handbook--I love <br/>
it. I&#39;ve given it to my son but I don&#39;t know how much he&#39;s read. It <br/>
might help him make a decision......<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of specific concerns. One is that he not feel like <br/>
he &quot;failed&quot; at school, because he is very down on himself in terms of <br/>
ability. He frequently says he &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do assignments which are <br/>
certainly within his capabilities, and he seems to really believe <br/>
that he &quot;can&#39;t.&quot; But he stops before he even tries. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
end up with him even more down on himself than he is, by not <br/>
finishing the year.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we are also worried about him being rewarded for rolling over <br/>
on some of the stuff that&#39;s been expected of him. It sounds silly, <br/>
given that some of what&#39;s been expected has been in his eyes a waste <br/>
of time. But I don&#39;t want him to feel like everything is so loosey-<br/>

&quot;I&#39;m completely unmotivated.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way: If someone were to decide for you that you must<br/>
learn a language you have absolutely no interest in, what would it<br/>
take to sustain you through fulfilling what is essentially someone<br/>
else&#39;s requirement of you?  There is an assumption resting in<br/>
expectations especially when applied to children-- children can&#39;t<br/>
think for themselves and have to be told, cajoled, or shown what is<br/>
good for them.  In your opinion, is that correct?  Or are your<br/>
expectations about something or someone else?  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Challenged to do what?  It&#39;s not necessary to set up challenges or<br/>
obstacles.  Sometimes challenges aren&#39;t scary... just about jumping<br/>
through hoops.  You probably *will* learn *something* but you have a<br/>
greater chance of feeling failure or annoyance when being challenged.<br/>
  Of course the intelligent thing is to avoid challenges when you&#39;re<br/>
already feeling challenged enough just attending school. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing is a sure success.  But connections have meaning and are a<br/>
better guarantee of success in many things, enjoyment, excitement,<br/>
learning, making friends, having interests, doing new things... <br/>
Unschooling is about providing an environment that encourages kids to<br/>
make connections about all they encounter throughout life.   It will<br/>
only be loosey goosey if the parents don&#39;t provide an exciting<br/>
environment.<br/>

I think each kid is a better judge of what he can and can&#39;t do than his <br/>
parent or his teacher is.  That&#39;s maybe hard to believe if you have a <br/>
kid who hangs back cautiously from new experiences, as I do, but on some <br/>
level, at least, I do believe it. <br/>
<br/>
It can be attractive to think that pushing and encouraging and noodging <br/>
can improve a kid&#39;s performance.  (Eep!)  But, I have seen kids come up <br/>
with wildly imaginative and varied ways to challenge themselves.  The <br/>
tasks that they freely chose for themselves can be so creative that they <br/>
put &quot;lesson plans&quot; of a teacher to shame.  It is really really hard to <br/>
flog ourselves thru a series of hoops or tasks set up by others.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think learning has to be this hard.  (And I&#39;m a morning person, so <br/>
plowing through homework in the evening when my brain is fried is <br/>
especially hard.)<br/>
<br/>
(I wish I could think of some of these creative challenge examples, but <br/>
my brain isn&#39;t retrieving them right now.  I hope others will post some.)<br/>
<br/>
A kid who struggles with a difficult task, say homework, doesn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily have a sense of elation or accomplishment when the paper <br/>
comes back with an &quot;A&quot; on it. (Even if we expect him to, or think we <br/>
would in his place.) And even if he did feel happy and satisfied for <br/>
many minutes, the satisfaction from completion or from his grade might <br/>
still not be strong enough to wipe out whatever self-talk and <br/>
self-perception was happening while struggling with the task.  A kid <br/>
could carve a very long lasting memory (meme?) into his brain like &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
terrible at handwriting&quot; or &quot;Sentence diagramming stinks&quot; or &quot;I stink at <br/>
fractions&quot;.  (Doing a math assignment without understanding the concept <br/>
being practiced strikes me as an especially bad idea.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some good stuff written by Frank Smith that talks about the fact <br/>
that we can&#39;t really learn when we are confused or frightened.  And I <br/>
think grades and competition can increase how frightened we feel.  <br/>
Sometimes our self-esteem is on the line.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236976089">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; Why can&#39;t he go to public school at once?<br/>
<br/>
She was writing about someone who&#39;s already in school. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone currently in private school who is agitating to go to public school.<br/>
He apparently believes it will make a difference to his happiness level. I&#39;m<br/>
reading that his parents doubt it would be a better situation.<br/>
<br/>
My intention was to promote the idea of not using some externally imposed<br/>
time line as a reason to delay giving a kid what they are asking for,<br/>
reportedly repeatedly. <br/>
<br/>
Some private schools promote themselves as being more academically rigorous<br/>
than public schools. I wonder if he wants to go to a new place in order to<br/>
make a fresh start, without being pigeon holed in whatever role he currently<br/>
is in at his current school. Possibly the role of &quot;gifted&quot; or &quot;brainy&quot; is<br/>
becoming too pressured. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling frees us from needing to label our children, or to buy into the<br/>
limiting roles that schoolish thinking may impose on them. <br/>
<br/>
However it is the deschooling process that lets these ideas be purged from<br/>
inside the child - and the adult. It is the deschooling process that will<br/>
allow our own innate knowledge of our authentic &quot;capabilities&quot;, to use the<br/>
schoolish word that has been applied, to become restored. <br/>
<br/>
The parents need to deschool their thinking too. It isn&#39;t just &quot;we aren&#39;t in<br/>
school&quot;; it is also &quot;school isn&#39;t in us today&quot;. The ideas are insidious,<br/>
sometimes buried. I&#39;m still deschooling myself and rediscovering my joys.<br/>
The sooner that process begins the sooner the joy can enter your lives.<br/>

You think kids in public school are mean spirited, you try going to <br/>
a private school.  Private schools tend to attract the more wealthy <br/>
kids who come from homes that DO look down on others because of <br/>
their affluence.  Even if you go to a nice private school that has a <br/>
good diverse population, which I have yet to see, you still have <br/>
that other set to deal with.  Cliques are terrible in private <br/>
school, the amount of peers to choose from are limited even more <br/>
than a public school.  If you get ostracized for something, <br/>
anything, it stays FOREVER simply because you can&#39;t get away from <br/>
those people.  Everyone knows everyone, everyone&#39;s parents know <br/>
everyone else&#39;s parents.  There is no escaping, no sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
Public schools have all kinds of kids from all kinds of <br/>
backgrounds.  So, even if the schools themselves stink, it <br/>
inherently might be more interesting than what the private school <br/>
offers with all the uniforms and the uniformity of all the kids and <br/>
people there.  <br/>
<br/>
After I had a taste of the public school, I really wanted not part <br/>
in school at all, but that wasn&#39;t a choice for me.  It could be for <br/>
the kid in question here though.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205231327">I never had academic pressure, challenge or anything in any school,<br/>
private or public.  I went to private school but it was too expensive<br/>
for my parents so I mostly went to public school.  What jenstar said<br/>
was my experience also.  The silliest snobbery I&#39;ve come in contact<br/>
with.  Public school wasn&#39;t much better.  There&#39;s plenty classism and<br/>
bigotry there too.  I didn&#39;t want to be there.  Looking back on it, I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine I would have liked homeschool either but I wasn&#39;t given<br/>
the choice.  Never knew it existed until way after hs.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563423474">I really appreciate the thought that you all have put into my dilemma.<br/>
Here&#39;s an update:<br/>
<br/>
I decided that I agree with you about being harsh in all the<br/>
requirements we were imposing on my son. We don&#39;t see a purpose in<br/>
continued torment on ANY front! <br/>
<br/>
So I told him that he can choose to stop attending the private school<br/>
now, and that if he does, he can still choose to go to public school<br/>
if he wants. Or he can go to public school now. Or he can not go back<br/>
to school at all. He was SO relieved, and even though he had been<br/>
feeling like he didn&#39;t want to go back, now that he has the choice,<br/>
he&#39;s thinking he WILL go back to the private school until the end of<br/>
the year. I told him he is free to change his mind if he wants.<br/>
<br/>
He seems very grateful for having his wishes listened to and<br/>
respected. I continue to be skeptical and a bit frightened of public<br/>
middle school, but unless I find something actually dangerous, I&#39;m<br/>
going to let him give it a try if it is what he really wants. We&#39;re<br/>
all going to go meet with the principal to talk over a few things next<br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
His school is closed for ten days during Passover, and during that<br/>
time I&#39;m going to try to spend a lot of time with unschooling groups<br/>
in town so he can get a look at what that&#39;s really like.<br/>
<br/>
I am realizing that part of my insecurity has to do with lack of faith<br/>
in my ability to provide a stimulating unschooling environment. There<br/>
are SOME things that he does enjoy at school, which I don&#39;t think I<br/>
would have even thought of to offer as an opportunity. For example, he<br/>
learned several poetry genres and had fun putting together various<br/>
forms of poetry. That being said, I don&#39;t think that lesson was worth<br/>
the angst and agony of the other subjects which he has suffered through.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to continue to try to leave as much in his hands as<br/>
possible while providing a loving and steady hand to hold if he wants<br/>
to. But oy, it ain&#39;t easy!!!!!!! (As you all know.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you thank you thank you for all your help and support on this. I<br/>
appreciate your bearing with me as we went &quot;off-topic!&quot;<br/>

there, too.<br/>

of things as he&#39;d be exposed to in school. That&#39;s unlikely. But  <br/>
poetry exists outside of school and, in fact, if he likes poetry,  <br/>
he&#39;ll find it and he&#39;ll have a LOT more fun with it outside of  <br/>
school. My older daughter writes lots of poetry - over the years  <br/>
she&#39;s watched and participated in &quot;poetry slams,&quot; got lots and lots  <br/>
of books of poetry of all kinds from the library, engaged in &quot;writing  <br/>
marathons&quot; with online friends, created a lot of &#39;zines that included  <br/>
her own and other people&#39;s poetry,  utilized an online writing course  <br/>
called &quot;Ringer&#39;s Secret School of Writing&quot; (secretschool.com), and  <br/>
even ran writing workshops at Not Back to School Camp.<br/>
<br/>
My middle daughter reads a lot of poetry, doesn&#39;t write it as far as  <br/>
I know (she might be keeping it private).<br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter occasionally reads a bit of poetry.<br/>
<br/>
None of them have any hint of negative attitudes about &quot;poetry.&quot;  <br/>
That&#39;s more than can be said about most kids who&#39;ve been &quot;exposed&quot; to  <br/>
it in school.<br/>
