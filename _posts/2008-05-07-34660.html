<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765095651">I&#39;ve been having this problem with my DS (6) for about 2 years now.  He<br/>
seems very grumpy all the time and has taken on a sort of pessimist attitude<br/>
about the world.  For example, today DS did not want to go swimming.  He<br/>
didn&#39;t have an option to stay home, because DD (4) was looking forward to<br/>
going and we were meeting friends there.  There was no one to watch DS while<br/>
we went.  I told him he did not have to swim, or even get his bathing suit<br/>
on, but he did have to go, because there were no other options.<br/>
<br/>
In the car, he told me that he wished I would kill him, so he could start<br/>
his life over.  We talked about how horrible his life was, because he &quot;never<br/>
gets to do anything fun,&quot; and he&#39;s &quot;ugly, because his head is shaped funny&quot;<br/>
(it&#39;s not).  I tried to sympathize with him and find out why he thought<br/>
these things, but he just said, &quot;It&#39;s just how I feel.&quot;  I asked him what<br/>
sort of things he would consider fun (he listed things we already do a<br/>
lot).  He grumbled the whole way to the pool.<br/>
<br/>
When we got there, DS happily put on his bathing suit, with no mention of<br/>
the feelings he had in the car ride.  He swam and had a blast.  We ended up<br/>
staying there for 4 hours!  When we got in the car, I asked both kids,<br/>
casually &quot;So was that pretty fun?  Should we do that again sometime?&quot;  Of<br/>
course, DS answered, &quot;No, it sucked!&quot;  AHHH!<br/>
<br/>
It really bothers me when he thinks his life sucks, because it makes me feel<br/>
like I&#39;m doing something wrong.  It was actually one of the clues that led<br/>
me to unschooling in the first place, because I took it as a sign that what<br/>
we were doing wasn&#39;t working.  It&#39;s not like we were a spanking,<br/>
inconsiderate family before unschooling.  We did use occasional time outs or<br/>
taking away of privileges.  But generally, I&#39;ve always considered myself an<br/>
AP parent.  We&#39;ve always had pretty open communication.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know what to do.  I feel like the &quot;unschooling&quot; approach would<br/>
be to embrace him for who he is.  But OTOH, I feel like pessimism isn&#39;t who<br/>
someone is, it&#39;s a clue that someone is not truly happy with themselves or<br/>
with their place in the world.  How do I help him feel better about<br/>
himself?  Could our brief encounter with punishment and bedtime/food<br/>
limitations really be the cause of all this negative energy?  Will it go<br/>
away as we get more into the unschooling mindset?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051197049">If I&#39;ve calculated correctly, your son has only been out of school for about 1 1/2 months.  <br/>
I&#39;d say he needs more time to deschool.  I would keep doing what you&#39;re doing--trying to <br/>
find the activities that he&#39;ll enjoy--keep enlisting his help in that.  It could be that even <br/>
though he loves to swim and play with friends, the need to choose those activities for <br/>
himself is more important right now.  My son LOVED to stay at home at that age, maybe <br/>
your son really wants to have all of his time to himself--ask him what he wants to do.  <br/>
Perhaps you could arrange for your daughter to have playdates with friends while you stay <br/>
with your son.<br/>
<br/>
One of the consistent features of life with my kids is their desire for choice.  My dd has <br/>
recently surprised me by requiring a whole new level of choice about things that she just <br/>
wasn&#39;t aware of enough to care about just two weeks ago.  Now the things she was happy <br/>
to have me plan for her are making her terribly unhappy because she didn&#39;t have a say.  <br/>
I&#39;m having to adjust, yet again, to a new set of variables--and they do make sense to her.  <br/>
Come to think of it, my son shifted in his awareness of our calendar about a month ago-<br/>
and that had me hopping.  I have an overwhelmed feeling right now about it, but trust that <br/>
will fade as I get used my new job description!<br/>

Hopefully you can try and find other options next time.  A way for him not to go.  I have a couple of kids who love to be at home.  And to make them go with to things when they would rather be home would not be good.<br/>
<br/>
He might change with time,  he may not.  He may be content to be home more than you or his sister.  It can be challenging some times to find a way to find happiness for everyone but it&#39;s sure worth the work in the long run. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there&#39;s a balance of give and take but hopefully he doesn&#39;t have to do what he doesn&#39;t want to do, too much.   I would be grumpy too if I had to go out and see people when I didn&#39;t feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll be amazed at a turn about in attitude when he gets to be in control of what he&#39;s doing.  It may take some time, but it will happen. :)<br/>

<br/>
Everyone&#39;s choices are limited.  Part of maturity is that we learn to  <br/>
be realistic.  I don&#39;t wake up crying because I&#39;m not living in  <br/>
England.  And I&#39;m too old to move to England now, to immigrate.  And  <br/>
I COULD visit every year, until Keith divorced me for spending that  <br/>
much money on just me or something.  The choices I&#39;ve made weren&#39;t  <br/>
bad choices, they just couldn&#39;t possibly lead everywhere on the  <br/>
planet all at once.<br/>
<br/>
To couch his choices as<br/>
<br/>
a) go and swim<br/>
<br/>
b) go and not swim<br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t as good as<br/>
<br/>
a) take your Gameboy and books and we&#39;ll buy you a new game on the way<br/>
<br/>
b) go and hang out and watch watch their DVDs<br/>
<br/>
c) come out and swim if you want to<br/>
<br/>
Once people start seeing more happiness and generosity, it&#39;s  <br/>
everywhere.  When they&#39;re used to seeing &quot;have to&quot; and &quot;lame option,&quot;  <br/>
then that&#39;s everywhere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213223929">I am having a problem coming to terms with this idea, because on occasion I<br/>
have taken my son places where he did not want to go on the condition that<br/>
he &quot;try&quot; it or at least observe, and if he did not want to participate or<br/>
return, that was OK.  Many times he did not want to go, but we went and he<br/>
usually had a good time and wanted to go back.  I often feel it is just<br/>
getting him out of his comfort zone, to try something new.  We adults<br/>
frequently have problems with that also, and know what it is like, and<br/>
usually are glad we did.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t know how to blend this with consensual living for our kids.<br/>
<br/>
If it is something that he is already familiar with and isn&#39;t interested in,<br/>
then I have no problem leaving him home.<br/>
<br/>
At the L&L last year, for instance. He did not leave the room for the first<br/>
24 hours but when he finally did, we barely saw him for 3 days.  He cant<br/>
wait to return this year.  In that instance, I did not coerce him at all,<br/>
just waited.  But if I had nudged, he would have had another entire fun<br/>
filled day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832779207">I&#39;ve had that same dilemma myself.  The way I see it now, though, is that the act of <br/>
choosing is so very important, that when possible that&#39;s what we ultimately honor.  I may <br/>
cajole a little, and try to sell an idea, offer ways for it to work, etc., but if they aren&#39;t going <br/>
for it for whatever reason, I try to honor that.  <br/>
<br/>
When someone has done something because of my urging, and it didn&#39;t go well, then it <br/>
was all my fault--and it was.  I decided that I didn&#39;t want to be in the position of taking <br/>
responsibility for the time they had, so now if someone wants to stay home, they do, even <br/>
though it makes me sad sometimes, or I think they would&#39;ve had a good time.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;In that instance, I did not coerce him at all,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just waited.  But if I had nudged, he would have had another entire fun<br/>
&gt; filled day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or there might have been a disaster because he really wasn&#39;t ready to handle all the <br/>
stimulation yet--we&#39;ve had it go both ways, and when it goes the other way it was sooo <br/>
not worth it!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly the reason I finally bit the bullet and pulled my <br/>
oldest ds out of school. He was 12 at the time and about halfway <br/>
through 7th grade. The last straw for me was when we were headed <br/>
home after a parent/teacher conference and my ds said if he had a <br/>
gun, he would shoot the prinicipal and then himself. I drove him <br/>
straight to the ER because I&#39;ve had problems with depression myself <br/>
and I was very afraid. He was evaluated and I was told he was not a <br/>
danger to himself or others. I never took him back to school. This <br/>
kind of talk did continue for a while. I don&#39;t really know how long. <br/>
He did eventually stop talking about wanting to be dead but the <br/>
negativity continued for many years. He&#39;s 17 now and just recently <br/>
started to say he was stupid but stopped himself and instead said he <br/>
was smart but just doesn&#39;t really apply himself (still thinking in <br/>
terms of school, I guess). We did go to counseling but it was family <br/>
focused, not focused on him as a problem that needed to be fixed. I <br/>
am actually the primary patient and my family comes when they can. <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s real depression, it won&#39;t just go away. However, it may be <br/>
that he just needs more time to deschool. My ds used to say that <br/>
school took all the pride out of him. He&#39;s still recovering from it.<br/>
