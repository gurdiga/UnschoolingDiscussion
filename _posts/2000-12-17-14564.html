This probably doesn&#39;t help you any Tracy, but you aren&#39;t alone!  I have<br/>
the books and cassette tape program to go with Liberated Parents,<br/>
Liberated Children and the How to Talk...  When I am in the middle of<br/>
reading it, I can do a better job.  Have thought about doing a workshop<br/>
locally.  I wonder if it could be done on-line.   Hmmm, something to<br/>
think about after the holidays....<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of support, I enjoy hearing all the views on this list, as I<br/>
also need frequent reminders that unschooling really does work! <br/>
Sometimes I worry that I&#39;m not doing enough&quot;teaching&quot; or whatever, then<br/>
my kids will do something that shows me how they are learning sooo much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001026547">Yes, in-person support is the best.  Several of us in our homeschool<br/>
playgroup have had days where we told the kids we HAVE to go to park day<br/>
because I (the mom) need to spend time with my friends!<br/>
<br/>
I coerced dd #1 to wean and wish I&#39;d done it differently.  Now I&#39;m<br/>
getting a second chance!  I can tell dd #2 is nearly done and I am ready<br/>
to move beyond this stage too.  But it really is another trust issue -<br/>
trusting that our children will walk, talk, read, wean, etc, when they<br/>
are ready.  We can push them to do these things sooner, but what is<br/>
gained by forcing them?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so true that the process of nursing and weaning is more important<br/>
than the age.  In our society, any baby who is breastfed to the first<br/>
birthday is a lucky baby indeed!  It is also a relationship between mom<br/>
and child.  I think it&#39;s fine for a mom to set limits with an older<br/>
nursling as long as you are willing to be flexible in order to meet the<br/>
child&#39;s needs.  Some nusing sessions are as much habit as need, such as<br/>
nursing during the bedtime stories in our house.  As with any other<br/>
habit, it may take a change in routines.  When dh reads the bedtime<br/>
stories, dd often falls asleep without nursing.<br/>

<br/>
I agree, as when I was weaning my dd, she would,<br/>
whenever she got stressed or upset in any way, start<br/>
like she was going to lay down in my lap and have<br/>
nummies and then catch herself and it realize she<br/>
didn&#39;t actually WANT them right then but was just<br/>
doing it out of habit.<br/>
(&quot;oh. (giggle) I don&#39;t want nummies.&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
Also, I found nursing her to sleep actually a HELP in<br/>
weaning her, cuz alot of the times, when she was<br/>
really tired, &quot;nummies&quot; would just knock her out as<br/>
though it was spiked with valium. Well, becuz my kids<br/>
have inherited my insomnia/distaste for sleep (going<br/>
away as I get older, &lt;g&gt;), in weaning her, we worked<br/>
our way down to only bedtime nursing and then she<br/>
would eventually refuse nummies when I offered,<br/>
thinking she would get more awake time that way. Not<br/>
slyly planned at all on my part, but convenient,<br/>
nonetheless, cuz then she felt it was her own decision<br/>
and during the day was just too busy for that sort of<br/>
thing. :)<br/>
<br/>
over and snout,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886857693">I actually feel rather bad posting this, because I hate spamming people, but<br/>
this is for a good cause and I really need some help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This a random plea that I&#39;m going to be posting in several different places,<br/>
and I&#39;m sorry if this doesn&#39;t completely fit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I run a blog (which is like an online journal thing) located at<br/>
www.un-creatively.net/taciturn. This year, I plan on participating in the<br/>
blogathon for the first time ever. The main idea behind the blogathon is<br/>
that each blogger picks a charity or cause of their choice, gathers<br/>
sponsors, and then on July 26, posts in their blog every 30 minutes for 24<br/>
hours straight. Once the event is over, sponsors send their donations to the<br/>
charity/cause of the bloggers&#39; choice. You can find out more about the<br/>
blogathon at www.blogathon.org. This year, I hope to raise money for the<br/>
Self Education Foundation (www.selfeducation.org), which is located in my<br/>
hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I&#39;m looking for people who are able<br/>
and willing to sponsor me for the event. Any and all donations will be<br/>
accepted and appreciated - even if you can only afford $1 for the entire 24<br/>
hours. If you can sponsor me, please fill out the form at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blogathon.org/Pledge.php?p=190.">http://www.blogathon.org/Pledge.php?p=190.</a> If you have any questions or<br/>
comments, please feel free to contact me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an incentive to get people to pledge, I am offering gifts/surprises to<br/>
the person who pledges the most money.<br/>
