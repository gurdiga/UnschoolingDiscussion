<div id="ygrps-yiv-698589544">Just have to jump in here on this tv/teethbrushing debate.<br/>
Funny how those two topics always seem to go hand in hand..!!<br/>
<br/>
I used to sound a lot like you Ari.<br/>
I was raised in a house with no tv and I can tell you firsthand what happens <br/>
when you are raised that way. You become ADDICTED to it when you finally get <br/>
control of your own life. It was after I got married that I had to <br/>
&quot;deprogram&quot;. Went through a phase of not being able to turn it off for quite <br/>
a long time (years) before I gained self control.<br/>
Why not give your kids the ability to gain control from day one? Your kids <br/>
WILL have control of all their own choices one day whether you like it or not.<br/>
Why not let them learn self control in their own home, a safe environment, <br/>
before being on their own and not knowing what to do with the freedom?<br/>
Same with food.<br/>
Only the things that are limited and controlled become objects of obsession.<br/>
I am a health freak. My kids will hear my opinion on certain additives and <br/>
sugars.<br/>
And then they will decide for themselves what to do with that information.<br/>
I keep a wide variety of foods available to them and they choose a lot of the <br/>
groceries.<br/>
They just asked me to do another &quot;food as art&quot; day with them and the first <br/>
food they requested was broccoli. Yes, broccoli. <br/>
They sometimes eat a sweet muffin or other &quot;unhealthy food&quot; before a meal and <br/>
you know what? It&#39;s never affected their appetite. They still eat vegetables, <br/>
pasta or whatever else is available.<br/>
The went through a huge binge of ice cream when I finally started relaxing. I <br/>
still have to buy them their OWN foods (still fearful that someone else will <br/>
eat it and they won&#39;t get more of the cherished item) but they are starting <br/>
to relax too. Because they know it is available and not controlled by me...if <br/>
they want a food they ask me to pick it up at the store. No big deal.<br/>
I have a nephew that hardly EVER brushes his teeth. I was horrified when I <br/>
saw the scum on them last summer. Once a week his Mom can&#39;t stand it anymore <br/>
and brushes them for him. He is Nine and just saw the dentist last week. Not <br/>
a single cavity in his little head! Seems he has inherited the ability to <br/>
keep healthy teeth through sugar and not brushing.<br/>
If you are going to live in a society that uses sugar, tv etc... you better <br/>
prepare your kids for that society. Not some society in which those things <br/>
are not an option. If you don&#39;t want them to have access to tv or sugar, you <br/>
best not live in this country.<br/>
How long will you control access to those items? Until they are teens and <br/>
hating the control you try to exert? At which point it won&#39;t matter, because <br/>
you will no longer have control anyway.<br/>
Better that they don&#39;t obsess with those things to start with. That they <br/>
become just another option. They won&#39;t be acting like addicts when they visit <br/>
a friend or when your control is no longer an option.<br/>
You can&#39;t control your children, they are not objects to be owned. The <br/>
control will only last a short time, teach them to sneak behind your back and <br/>
eventually cause them to not confide in you. The feeling that we can control <br/>
them is false. We can only open or shut doors in the relationship. They will <br/>
choose their own path, with or without your approval.<br/>

control of your own life. It was after I got married that I had to <br/>
&quot;deprogram&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of something.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere, I think on unschooling.com, someone described a kind of autism, <br/>
sort of, where people only process the written word, and can&#39;t really learn <br/>
from pictures, and have a hard time with the spoken word or human interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone remember what that was called?<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who is just that way.  So TV, to her, is stupid.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
make sense.<br/>
<br/>
And she prefers books without photos.  I used to think it was purest <br/>
snobbishness and kneejerk pride in having read early--reading picture books <br/>
should evolve to the point where the reader doesn&#39;t need pictures.  Therefor <br/>
pictures are for babies or non-readers.<br/>
<br/>
Well after I read the description of that learning style, mental illness, <br/>
whatever it was described as, I thought that was it!  That was her!<br/>
<br/>
So she married someone who loves movies.  Not a TV addict, by any means, but <br/>
someone who knows tons of cool detail about obscure movies and actors and <br/>
directors.  And when they were  married she made him put his TV and VCR in <br/>
the unfinished, cold, ugly, yucky basement, because, she says with <br/>
conviction, TV is stupid.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, maybe more important, I find TV ugly. Most of the stuff shown is<br/>
&gt; esthetically offensive. Does anyone else think that? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the opposite. There is just so much WONDERFUL and beautiful stuff on <br/>
tv - it is amazing. I have all of Sister Wendy&#39;s programs on tape -- hours <br/>
and hours of them. Have you ever watched &quot;This Old House&quot; or that Yankee&#39;s <br/>
Workshop show - whatever it is called? Even the cooking shows - they can be <br/>
so lovely to watch!!! How about the show about the castles of England? The <br/>
railroads of the world? Nature? National Geographic specials? I mean - <br/>
seriously - if you&#39;re just looking for pure BEAUTY -- there is so MUCH there. <br/>
We watched a show about Bob Fosse the other night - the dancing was just <br/>
gorgeous!!! What more could you want? My daughter loves opera -- where else <br/>
is she going to be able to hear Pavarotti and the other opera greats and see <br/>
productions of full-length operas?<br/>
<br/>
Ugly? Well - there&#39;s the Simpsons...I guess that qualifies in a way &lt;g&gt;. But <br/>
it is hysterically funny social commentary and I can&#39;t think of it as &quot;ugly.&quot;<br/>

one&#39;s personal choice, and it can be a very positive one, at that.  Burning down<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;...and that people who unschool are more likely to wean<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Wean&quot; as in stop drinking breastmilk?<br/>
Bad choice of words.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wean&quot; as in stop using heroin gradually instead of cold turkey?<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone want to stop using a tool?<br/>
<br/>
Should unschoolers wean themselves of using scissors and tape?  Magazines?  <br/>
Videos?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be a weaner anyway.  I want to be a provider.<br/>
