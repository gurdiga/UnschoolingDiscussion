<div id="ygrps-yiv-541881324">Ren, I think it was you who I told about the book. I now have the correct <br/>
title and author&#39;s name.<br/>
&quot;Behaving As If The God In All Life Mattered&quot;, by MacHaelle Small Wright<br/>
I found it on Amazon. IT is a little &quot;out there&quot; for some folks, but very <br/>
interesting and I found it particularly poignant for myself and my <br/>
experiences with animals.<br/>
