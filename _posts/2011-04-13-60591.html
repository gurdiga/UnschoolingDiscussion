<div id="ygrps-yiv-517197661">I am in need of some help.  I have been schooling my son since he was 4 years old.  He is now 6.  He is an only child and now after offically registering our home as a school with the state my husband feels he should be enrolled in a charter school here in Alamance county. This is because he feels he is spending too much time alone during the week.  My son gets along with people of all ages very well.  I don&#39;t want to place him in a school, specially because my son doesn&#39;t want to go to a regular school.  I have sought out groups here in Alamance county of other home schooling families; however all the ones I find are &quot;Christian&quot; based and everything they do is based on their chirsitan ethics, morals and idea.  I do not have anything against that, but I do not want to subject my son to such rigid systems of thought.  Are their groups of people who are not strictly christian in nature that meet in Alamance county?  We do not have much income and can not travel very far.  Can someone please help me appease my husband desires of our son being involved with other child on a somewhat regular basis and yet still be able to allow him to be homeschooled like he wishes.<br/>
<br/>
He has plyed Tball and I am trying to get him on a local baseball team for his age with no luck so far.  Any other suggestions or families int his area that owuld like to get together and meet on a regular basis?<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Cristina</div>

Look for locals here:<br/>

The list has readers from several continents.  You might be able to find locals on local or regional lists.<br/>

Schooling?<br/>
Are you considering unschooling?<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps you could find something to do with your son that gets you both out into the community.  Perhaps there is volunteer work, or clubs or projects, maybe with retirees/pensioners.  <br/>
<br/>
Would the charter school *be* &quot;a regular school&quot;?  <br/>

<br/>
If your son would rather be with those children than not, then is it possible you are &quot;subjecting him&quot; to being alone?    If you think of it as wholly your own doing (&quot; I do not want to subject my son to...&quot;), how much choice does he have?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If he were to go back to school and it went well, that would be good for your marriage and for your son too, if he liked it.<br/>
If he went to school and it didn&#39;t go well, it would give your husband a different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your husband haven&#39;t agreed about homeschooling, it&#39;s not time to do it yet.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re talking about next school year?<br/>
