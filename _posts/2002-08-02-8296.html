&gt;If you have to take the kids with you why not let them pick cereals from a <br/>
&gt;certain company or store brand only?  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had a rule that it had to be something that I had eaten when I was a <br/>
kid, and then the smallest, try-out size, box.  Will was always falling <br/>
for the snazzy commercials of the newest cereal, and every week he would <br/>
want another, different kind, while we still had the others in the <br/>
cabinet.  That rule kind of short-circuited that desire process.  It <br/>
allowed me to display my disdain for the sales manipulation, which was <br/>
really the message I was trying to get across--because he was falling <br/>
victim to it.  <br/>
<br/>
If it was a snazzy commercial for an old cereal, I made good and bought <br/>
him the cereal anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently we picked up a box of Fruity Pebbles attached to something else <br/>
at Sam&#39;s Club.  He was surprised when I said, &quot;Okay&quot; with a shrug.  He <br/>
said, &quot;Fruity Pebbles were around when YOU were a kid!?&quot;  He thinks the <br/>
Flintstones are a recent invention.  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Kinda like when, on Oprah, I heard a 22-ish woman say she didn&#39;t believe <br/>
vibrators were even invented when her mother was a young woman!  rofl.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152487070">&#39;welcome. :)  I remember watching and liking it pretty well too.  I think it<br/>
got pretty scathing reviews at the time.<br/>
