 I like sewing too.  Doll quilts are a lot of fun, bc they are small and<br/>
 can be finished in a reasonable amount of time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw a first quilting kit for children that included enough materials <br/>
to make a couple of  items, one being the perfect size for a doll quilt.<br/>
I was actually going to get it for myself!  <br/>

quilt and that sounds like an unintimidating way to start.  Like I don&#39;t<br/>
have enough on my plate already that I am barely keeping up with, but HEY!<br/>
I just can&#39;t help myself.<br/>

I thought it was through Hearthsong, but I just checked the catalog (they <br/>
do have some other nice kits, knitting, looms, basket making etc).  So now<br/>
I am thinking it might have been in this catalog I can&#39;t find, something about<br/>
log cabin dolls?  I will look around some more later and post if I find it.<br/>
