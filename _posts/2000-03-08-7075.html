 </span></blockquote>I really like the Miquon books. They are open-ended and encourage kids to<br/>
find their own ways of discovering math. My boys don&#39;t use the rods much for<br/>
the workbook pages, but they do play with them in other ways. I recommend<br/>
getting the Annotations book. You can buy the books from the publisher but<br/>
they are in many homeschool catalogs for a better price. Lots of times you<br/>
can pick them up on eBay or Vegsource.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure about the above resources though I have heard good things about them....but I thought you might want to check out a couple of books...&quot;Family Math&quot; and &quot;A Gebra Named Al&quot;.  If I remember correctly chemistry used mostly algebra.  Personally I loved algebra so the high school and college textbooks worked fine for me....Trig was another story though.  Also my husband bought a softwared program called mathematics deluxe that has everything from pre-algebra to calc and statistics.  I haven&#39;t tried it out yet so it may be to &quot;drillish&quot;, but no one says you have to do all the problems.  I do believe though that learning the math as it comes up in chemistry may be better because then it has &quot;real world&quot; concept behind it.  Just an idea.<br/>
