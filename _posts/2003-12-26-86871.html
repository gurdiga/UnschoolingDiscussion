<div id="ygrps-yiv-655585884"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My world&#39;s pretty cool.  It has become gradually cooler since I had kids and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have tried to figure out how to make THEIR worlds cooler.  Mine got the side <br/>
benefit of what I learned about how to help keep them happy.<br/>
<br/>
This is another keeper, Sandra!<br/>
Somehow, I have managed to collect a dozen or so short quotes of yours<br/>
which just distill it for me!<br/>
Often, people comment on how &#39;easy&#39; things seem in our family, how much<br/>
&#39;fun&#39; we have, how it &#39;flows&#39; pretty well. With school out of the way,<br/>
control out of the way, and love and mutual respect in the forefront, my<br/>
world is pretty cool, too.<br/>
And I don&#39;t &#39;have to&#39; do anything, but be grateful!<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>
