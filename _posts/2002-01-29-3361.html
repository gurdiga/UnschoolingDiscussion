<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111100550">Don&#39;t you know that some of us have full time jobs! And moonlight <br/>
occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
Here I sit with 15 minutes to look over AlwaysLearning and find there <br/>
are 260 new post since the 30 minutes I had yesterday to look it over. <br/>
And most seem to be about TV, a subject I care passionately about. But <br/>
with this posting volume I CAN&#39;T EVEN BE A RESPONSIBLE LURKER!  &lt;G&gt;      <br/>
I&#39;m sure Pam and Pam and Sandra have covered beautifully, my pro TV <br/>
without limits opinion. I&#39;ll have to wait till I have time to look it <br/>
over to find out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Himn... lots of posts from Sandra. She must have spoke her view far too <br/>
clearly and succinctly for the quasi unschoolers or newbies to stomach.  <br/>
I&#39;m sure when I read these posts at the end of the week (when the show <br/>
I&#39;m currently working on opens) I will be thanking you.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to find out.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll ask my LTW for a recap...<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday I was playing Pokemon with my four year old and reading and<br/>
writing posts. &lt;g&gt; Then I would catalog books (71 new entries yesterday) and<br/>
read and write posts. Then I was calling all my girl scout parents (thank<br/>
goodness for DSL, always on! &lt;g&gt;) to get their cookie counts for the<br/>
pre-order, and reading and writing posts. Then I was talking to Brit about<br/>
why the light bulb in her battery-operated Mike (from Monsters Inc) necklace<br/>
wasn&#39;t necessarily green, it might be a filter in there somewhere, and<br/>
reading and writing posts. And then Wally took her off with a lamp and a<br/>
pile of filters-on-the-go (clothes, mostly &lt;g&gt;) to make light change color,<br/>
and I continued reading and writing posts.<br/>
<br/>
Some days, we&#39;re out of the house all day. Just luck. :)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, this time in two weeks we&#39;ll probably be getting people posting<br/>
notes saying, &quot;Is this thing working? I haven&#39;t got a post all day!&quot; The<br/>
nature of mailing lists.<br/>
