I read your Living Unschooling interview today in Life Learning, and <br/>
what you said about 9-12yo unschoolers going through a &quot;rough hump&quot; <br/>
where they can appear to be behind their schooled peers jumped out <br/>
at me.  My middle son (10) seems to be going through this right <br/>
now.  I&#39;m not at all worried about how things will turn out in the <br/>
end- I couldn&#39;t be more proud of my children or more confident about <br/>
the future.  But I *am* a little concerned about getting through <br/>
awkward moments in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
For example... one thing that all three of my boys, but my 10yo in <br/>
particular, would be considered &quot;behind&quot; in is <br/>
handwriting/spelling.  I hesitate to use that word, even in quotes, <br/>
but sometimes it&#39;s unexpectedly glaring.  For example... he was sick <br/>
with chicken pox not long ago, and his dear schooled friend from <br/>
down the street, knowing my son was cooped up and itchy, came over <br/>
with Mad Libs to cheer him up.  Mad Libs are nothing new here, but <br/>
when we&#39;re playing amongst ourselves I generally do the writing, <br/>
which is the way my kids prefer it.  When they *do* write they <br/>
almost always ask me how to spell the words.  Anyway, when our <br/>
little friend (9) was doing the writing and my son was choosing the <br/>
words, the friend dashed the words off quickly and effortlessly.  I <br/>
could see the tension in my son&#39;s face because he knew what was <br/>
coming was &quot;now you write for me,&quot; and those obvious comparisons <br/>
(even if they&#39;re just in his own mind) make him uncomfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
To my son&#39;s relief, I suggested doing the writing myself so that <br/>
both boys could come up with funny words together.  But lately he&#39;s <br/>
spending more and more time going off with other families and doing <br/>
sleepovers and such, and I won&#39;t always be there to &quot;cover&quot; for him <br/>
this way.  Similar situations have happened with reading as he&#39;s not <br/>
yet fluent and virtually all of his schooled friends are, even those <br/>
considerably younger than him.  The worst part is that *he* feels <br/>
inferior when these situations come up, despite the fact that he&#39;s <br/>
got all sorts of knowledge and experience and perspective that <br/>
others his age don&#39;t have, and he knows it, and I know it, and we&#39;ve <br/>
talked about it all before.   I honestly never expected my <br/>
unschooled son to care so deeply about such comparisons, and I&#39;m <br/>
trying to strike a balance between wanting him to *not* care about <br/>
what others think and at the same time wanting to honor and validate <br/>
his feelings whatever they are. <br/>
<br/>
It also bothers me on some level that there are many people in our <br/>
lives who would jump on such &quot;evidence&quot; (seen through their school <br/>
glasses) to conclude that our unconventional choices don&#39;t &quot;work.&quot;<br/>
I know that the answer, both for my son and vicariously for me, is <br/>
patience and clarity.  It&#39;s just hard sometimes, this hump...<br/>
at least when it comes to Mad Libs and such.  It&#39;s so much easier to <br/>
see the bigger picture when he&#39;s playing his guitar, or surfing, or <br/>
doing one of the many other things that make him gloriously himself.<br/>

<br/>
In any classroom in any school there are kids who are behind the others, who <br/>
don&#39;t feel they can do what the others can do (or who have been tested and <br/>
tutored and certified &quot;not able to do&quot;), but they blend into the wallpaper of <br/>
school, at least in the perceptions of others.   And school has a constant &quot;If <br/>
you just work harder, &quot; and &quot;maybe next year&quot; so there&#39;s no one big examination <br/>
by which the outside judges a schoolkid in the way that someone meeting <br/>
his/her first unschooled kid will form an impression for all time from one meeting.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a problem, but there&#39;s not a lot we can do, except maybe be calmer by <br/>
not being surprised and by knowing others have been there, and will be there.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people&#39;s rough place comes from late puberty, or not finding a <br/>
job when their other young-adult friends do, or not being married when their <br/>
friends are, etc.     It&#39;s just that those things are government mandated, as <br/>
&quot;education&quot; is.    And really, lots of states revised their wording so it&#39;s no <br/>
longer compulsory education, but compulsory attendance.   I guess some were <br/>
sued for having failed to educate.   Now the compulsion is on the families and <br/>
children, not on the state.   <br/>
<br/>
But as to learning curves, few have &quot;the perfect curve&quot; with no slumps their <br/>
whole lives.<br/>

<br/>
My eleven year old (boy) would be very behind schooled kids his age in <br/>
writing, and probably has holes in what he knows about math, but I think <br/>
would &quot;catch up&quot; to math very quickly.  Although he reads mostly only <br/>
cartoon books, he has an impressive vocabulary from spending so much <br/>
time with talkative adults and sophisticated TV and movies.  He&#39;s <br/>
interested in &quot;science&quot; and has lots of points of contact with &quot;history&quot; <br/>
to hang future information on.  It&#39;s possible to imagine him becoming <br/>
deeply informed about other pieces of history and science, even though <br/>
he doesn&#39;t learn about them formally.<br/>
<br/>
His negotiation skills are highly advanced. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
