<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070599218">This is an online newsletter from Swami Beyondananda, one of my favorite ever <br/>
comedians.  But this comedy has turned more serious, and that&#39;s not a bad <br/>
thing.  If you&#39;re curious and want to read things more in color on a prettier <br/>
website, look here:<br/>

I have four tapes of his and a book.  It&#39;s fun and profound all at once.  <br/>

<br/>
Dear Friends:<br/>
<br/>
 Happy New Year!  And not a moment too soon ...  Yes, 2002 was a<br/>
pretty heavy year for many folks, and let&#39;s face it.  A couple of<br/>
heavy years in a row, and you&#39;re bound to gain weightiness.  That is <br/>
why we invite you to start the new year off by becoming a charter <br/>
member of the Laughmore Society, to help you overcome gravity by<br/>
taking a vow of levity.  Yes, these are serious times.  And serious <br/>
times call for serious laughter.  Why?<br/>
<br/>
  . Laughter actually and literally heals by releasing toxins and<br/>
unwanted memories from our cells.<br/>
 .  Laughter releases emotion, and paves the way for clarity and<br/>
forgiveness.<br/>
 .  Laughter is a political act;  it helps us overcome our irony<br/>
deficiency and political powerlessness, and encourages us to handle<br/>
the underlying imbalance instead of fussing about the symptoms.  Or,<br/>
as Swami would say, &quot;Here is my simple alternative to the war on<br/>
drugs:  Improve Reality!&quot;<br/>
 .  Laughter is a learning tool.  It exposes the foolish nonsense we<br/>
have been tricked into believing, and opens the mind to new<br/>
possibilities.<br/>
 .  Laughter helps heal the spirit. It opens the clown chakra to <br/>
remind us that indeed we are all cosmic comic clowns under the same<br/>
Big Top. Find out more about how you can join us ..<br/>

 Michael Mears, writer, producer (Sesame Street, the WiseZenHeimers)<br/>
and Steve (Swami Beyondananda) Bhaerman have &quot;joined farces&quot; to<br/>
empower you to create farce fields of your own, and in so doing raise <br/>
the laugh force -- and overall happiness -- on planet Earth.  Can we <br/>
actually use laughter to heal the planet?  Well, we can at least have <br/>
some fun finding out.<br/>
<br/>
 As members of the Laughmore Society, you will receive:<br/>
<br/>
 .   A handsome certificate of Absurdification, suitable for framing<br/>
-- or at least to remind you to &quot;enlighten up.&quot;<br/>
 .   A Wake Up Laughing laughter tape to play any time you need a<br/>
reminder that there is indeed a laugh track out there.<br/>
 .   The official Laughmore Society button with the motto, &quot;Overcome<br/>
With Laughter.&quot;<br/>
 .   Specials and discounts on books, tapes, CDs and other cosmic <br/>
comedy products, including those of the Swami.<br/>
 .   The monthly Wake Up Laughing E-zine, featuring not just funny<br/>
stuff, but tips on applying the art of &quot;situational comedy&quot; to just<br/>
about any situation.<br/>
<br/>
 You get all of this for the laughable sum of $21.95 per year ... tax<br/>
deductible, of course.  You get to support the cause of transformation<br/>
through comedy, and nourish yourself and those around you with healing<br/>
laughter.  Talk about feeding two birds with one scone!<br/>
<br/>
 But wait ... there&#39;s more.  If you are among the first 1,000 Charter<br/>
Members of Laughmore, you will receive Swami&#39;s groundbreaking music<br/>
and comedy CD, Drive Your Karma, Curb Your Dogma ... a $16 value. <br/>
Even if you already own the CD, you can certainly think of someone <br/>
who&#39;d love to laugh at Steve and Swami&#39;s enlightening humor.<br/>
