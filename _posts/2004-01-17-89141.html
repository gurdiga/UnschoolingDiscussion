<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912579084">I know that most of you are way further along at unschooling than we are, <br/>
about 3 months now, but we are having our first true unschooling moment.  My son <br/>
who reads and plays video games 16 hours a day, today has spent the majority <br/>
of the day designing a wooden board to play the Magic Card game on.  He drew it <br/>
out and then this afternoon made a model out of paper.  When his dad got home <br/>
he showed him the model and presented the idea. My husband suggested that he <br/>
draw it to scale on graft paper, that took about an hour.  My husband was very <br/>
pleased and thought that it was a very workable project.  They then looked at <br/>
a woodworking book that we had sitting around the house, and they have now <br/>
gone to Lowes to scope out supplies.<br/>
<br/>
This is so great.  It is so neat to have all the time needed to truly follow <br/>
what you are interested in.  It is also great to see a lot of father/son <br/>
bonding going on.<br/>
<br/>
Why do males all like power tools?  lol<br/>
<br/>
A happy mama,<br/>

I think the power tools thing is well..it&#39;s power, but it&#39;s also the open possibilities of what can be done with it. At least, that&#39;s why I like power tools, and my FIL agrees with me about them! <br/>
 <br/>
The game board sounds like a great idea! If you can, take a pic to share with us! I&#39;d love to see how it turns out to be!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-891459773">Hey, why should they have all the fun?!?  ;)  I love power tools and I <br/>
don&#39;t have nearly enough of them.  LOL  For xmas a few years back my <br/>
husband got me a great cordless drill and the next year I got a small <br/>
sander.  When my friends and family ask what I got from DH for xmas <br/>
they&#39;re  usually baffled as to why I&#39;m not furious that he bought <br/>
something for me that obviously for him (i.e. Homer giving Marge a <br/>
bowling ball with *his* name engraved on it ;&#39;).  When I explain that <br/>
I&#39;m thrilled with the gift they sometimes give me a &quot;well, if you say <br/>
so&quot; look.  A la Tim Allen, Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!  More power!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hey, why should they have all the fun?!?  ;)  I love power tools and I <br/>
don&#39;t have nearly enough of them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love power KITCHEN tools!  <br/>
I don&#39;t love the juicer because it&#39;s a pain to use and clean (but that&#39;s <br/>
Keith&#39;s anyway, for working at Honeywell 15 years, poor guy).<br/>
<br/>
I love the bread machine, the mixer, the food processor, the crock pot <br/>
(low-power tool, but still...) and I love the microwave, but the <br/>
power-hot-spray-things I love the most are the dishwasher and the washing machine.   (Not quite a <br/>
kitchen tool, but then again I use rags and dishtowels to pick up yucko <br/>
spills and the next time I touch them they&#39;re dry and clean.   Woohoo!!!<br/>
<br/>
But electric saws are likewise glorious.   Cordless drill.   That&#39;s a <br/>
miracle.  <br/>
<br/>
I like hand tools, too.  I have a really nice hatchet my husband gave me for <br/>
Christmas when we first moved here.  Our old house didn&#39;t have a fireplace.   <br/>
I bought an electric grindstone just to sharpen my hatchet, for $15 at a <br/>
garage sale, but that scares the heck out of me (scary old cord and plug), so I&#39;ve <br/>
done it by hand.<br/>
<br/>
I have a solid steel hammer with a wrapped handle that&#39;s really beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Keith fixed the rake he&#39;s had since before I knew him yesterday.   He was <br/>
drilling on the handle and getting it to fit in *just right.*   It&#39;s no special <br/>
rake, just that we know it well.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in England I picked up some &quot;spanners&quot; (wrenches without moving <br/>
parts) and a couple of screwdrivers just because they were different from our <br/>
hand tools.  Some I gave away.<br/>
<br/>
I REALLY really wish I had kept my dad&#39;s hand-crank drill.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope one of my kids ends up with my hatchet and remembers it fondly from <br/>
their childhood.<br/>
