In the upper right hand area, you can click on &quot;thread&quot;.  It will group all of the conversation together, except for the very first post, but when you read the &quot;second&quot; post (the first in the group), I think it has a link to the first one.  I&#39;m not sure.<br/>

You can maybe go to the page at yahoogroups and use a search, or scroll back <br/>
a few days until you see the subject line without a &quot;re:&quot; in front of it.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think it&#39;s easier for new people to just let the river of information <br/>
flow.  Generally, topics will come back around in a month or two anyway.   <br/>
