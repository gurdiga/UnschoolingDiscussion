 </span></blockquote>Ned agrees. They&#39;ve sold millions, so surely there are used ones available.<br/>
Maybe your support group can buy it together, if you want it new. Otherwise,<br/>
try advertising your need in classifieds or a radio swap program. Those have<br/>
been helpful to us at times.<br/>
PLUS, if you get it from a former user, they might give you tips about it.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of books available, from libraries too, that show us the<br/>
basics of phonics. You can create your own games once you know what phonics<br/>
is about, and how simple it is...up, pup, cup, cut,  etc.</div>
