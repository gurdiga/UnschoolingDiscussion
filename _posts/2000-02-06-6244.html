<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049584395">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this list - and although I&#39;m *sure* there are people I know<br/>
here, I&#39;m sending my intro too soon to know for sure...<br/>
<br/>
My name is Paula Long, and I live in Dickinson, Texas, which is just a tad<br/>
south of Houston and the Clear Lake (NASA) area, with my husband Scott. We<br/>
have a daughter Alexandria, who turned 4 in November. We also have a son,<br/>
Kadin, who was born still July of 1998.<br/>
<br/>
We parent in the style of attachment parenting, and I&#39;ve known I would<br/>
homeschool since before I ever had children. It wasn&#39;t until about 3.5<br/>
years ago that I learned of unschooling - and I knew the moment I heard of<br/>
it that that would be perfect for our family as it&#39;s just an extention of<br/>
what we were doing already.<br/>
<br/>
I recently became a member of a Houston unschooling group, but I wanted to<br/>
join together with more unschooling families as we continue our journey.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876667722">Hi Paula,<br/>
I wanted to welcome you I am a newbie too and also lost a child at birth the<br/>
day I became a mother I lost my first born twin due to a cord accident.. I<br/>
know that the impact of this loss has probably changed you forever and like<br/>
myself has encouraged me to search for alternatives to letting others have<br/>
control over my surviving children.I have found this list a lot of fun and<br/>
also meeting some wonderful like minded people in just a few short weeks.<br/>
and have even learned how to not get my books wet when I read to relax in<br/>
the bathtub! I look forward to hearing more about your unschooling<br/>
adventures with your daughter Alexandria.<br/>
