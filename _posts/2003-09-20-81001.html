<div id="ygrps-yiv-7037376">This thread about beliefs prompts me to remind you all about the <br/>
posting policies. In particular, please remember that this list is FOR <br/>
the purpose of critical thinking, analyzing, and examining our ideas. <br/>
That is why the posting policies include these:<br/>
<br/>
2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity <br/>
to<br/>
critically examine your own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to <br/>
public<br/>
examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
To read all the posting policies, go to the files area of this <br/>
yahoogroups list. They were posted here a couple of weeks ago and are <br/>
automatically sent to all new subscribers.<br/>
