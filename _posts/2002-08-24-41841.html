In my case it&#39;s not hatred of changing houses, but I really, really like New <br/>

Me too.  If New Mexico got crazy and homeschooling laws became oppressive I&#39;d <br/>
be willing to move to Texas, even!!! &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>

Being fresh from the HSC conference, I have the slight urge to live in <br/>

Minnesota was nice, when Keith was working there, except for the weather!!  <br/>
Too cold, too hot, too many bugs.  Socially, musically, I liked it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The state&#39;s official position is that homeschooling by becoming a private<br/>
school (the R-4 affadavit) is illegal. OTOH, that&#39;s been the state&#39;s<br/>
official position for years now, and they haven&#39;t bothered us (although<br/>
some individual districts have bothered some individual homeschooling<br/>
families, but we&#39;ve always won in the end). There were some changes this<br/>
year and some people were worried, but now it sounds like it won&#39;t be a<br/>
problem.<br/>

<br/>
Harrassment but not really legal trouble.<br/>
The smoke without any fire.<br/>
<br/>
Some counties sent &quot;booga booga&quot; letters but HSC&#39;s legal team already met <br/>
with state people (and people register at state level) and have reassurances <br/>
that the districts have been directed to back off, and that there was nothing <br/>
the districts could have done.<br/>
<br/>
There are SO many homeschoolers in California it&#39;s not a stoppable thing at <br/>
this point.<br/>
<br/>
If you have California friends with concerns, get them to join the HSC list <br/>
and look in the archives for August 20 and 21 and thereabout, for posts from <br/>
HSC legal (I&#39;m just doing this from memory) and tell them not to worry.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848590858">Its nice to hear you, Sandra, mention Minnesota.  That&#39;s where I live and frequently I think I would really like some of the more western states,on points of being more openminded, especially when it comes to unschooling.  Although there are few enough people around us so its easier to do what you feel is best for your family.  If we could only get certain conservative ideas out of our minds!  <br/>
