&lt;&lt;  Jerry Kosinski&#39;s The Painted Bird will take you inside and shake you up <br/>

<br/>
Of all the books I&#39;ve ever read that I wished I hadn&#39;t, that&#39;s top of the <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always preferred non-fiction since I can remember, definitely from <br/>
fourth grade when I became a chain reader, and one of my favorite books when I was <br/>
seven was a paperback book of science projects.  My dad built me a periscope <br/>
with two paper quart milk cartons and two little mirrors and masking tape that <br/>
I kept for YEARS.<br/>
<br/>
I own thousands of books, and of those not over 100 are novels,  I think.  <br/>
Maybe not over 50.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t begin to feel guilty.<br/>
<br/>
But when I like fiction I like it because it &quot;has ideas&quot; (Vonnegut), or <br/>
historical details (Austin, Dickens), or something.   <br/>
<br/>
I never get brain freeze from ice cream (my husband and all my kids do) but I <br/>
get brain freeze from modern fiction.   <br/>
<br/>
My husband like fantasy novels and space stuff and though I see why, I can&#39;t <br/>
get into it much.<br/>

No.<br/>
I called Keith and he hadn&#39;t either.  We looked at the website.  <br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s spoken at Bubonicon in Albuquerque sometimes (friends of mine <br/>
were involved in that from the 70&#39;s, and Kirby goes now to help run the anime <br/>
room).<br/>

If you have Cracker Barrel restaurant near you, they have buy-and-return  BOA <br/>
in their stores.  You buy the cd or tape, and then you can return it  any <br/>
time to any Cracker Barrel for a refund minus $3.50 per week (it just went  up 50 <br/>
cents).  The books rotate in and out of the various Cracker Barrel&#39;s,  so you <br/>
never know what you&#39;re going to get.  We use it whenever we&#39;re  travelling.  <br/>
We just got through listening to &quot;Holes&quot; on a trip to  Memphis.<br/>
 <br/>
They don&#39;t usually have a huge selection of kids stuff--Hardy Boys and  Nancy <br/>
Drew and Lemony Snicket.  The adult books are usually the latest  <br/>
bestsellers, though I can&#39;t listen to most of them because I&#39;m usually with my  son.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t rely on Cracker Barrel to get all my listening done, but  it&#39;s good <br/>
for travelling and they have clean restrooms.<br/>

One and the same.<br/>

Sure, I could&#39;ve put the book down, but it had been highly recommended by <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314447600">I&#39;ve actually read quite a few exceptional fiction works lately, <br/>
including all of Tracy Chevalier&#39;s novels (her Girl with the Pearl <br/>
Earring was made into a movie).  Ursula Hegi&#39;s Stones from the River <br/>
was also an excellent read and explored a number of interesting <br/>
themes that were relevant to my own experience.  I&#39;m an avid reader <br/>
of both fiction and non-fiction, but I&#39;d have to say my preference is <br/>
for literary fiction.  <br/>

that 5th (most recent) book, Shelters of Stone, IMO wasn&#39;t very good.  <br/>
It almost seemed like a new author tried to pick up the story and write <br/>

the Needle!) then pick up some Jack Higgins books.  I like The Eagle <br/>
Has Landed, The Eagle Has Flown, Eye of the Storm, Thunder Point, etc.  <br/>
Look up the books at Amazon and see if they sound interesting.  :)<br/>
