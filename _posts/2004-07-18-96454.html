<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115941585">&lt;&lt;&lt;Here in Detroit &quot;taggers&quot; are graffiti artists who leave their mark and <br/>
not necessarily gang related.  Many of the tags have political <br/>
connotations.  I love search for graffiti of turtles -- sometimes <br/>
accompanied by the word &quot;turdle&quot; -- indicating buildings and areas <br/>
where the artist feels that the City of Detroit is &quot;slow to change&quot;.  <br/>
Buildings needing demolition, crappy roads or city services, etc.  <br/>
Another more well known local artist tags abandoned buildings and burnt <br/>
out homes with a very large pink dot to make it known to city officials <br/>
that THIS needs to go.  There are others in the area too and if you <br/>
drive around the city often you begin to recognize different tagger&#39;s <br/>
calling cards.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In Australia there is a group called BUGA-UP - Billboard Using Graffitists<br/>
Against Unhealthy Promotions. They use often humorous and very clever<br/>
graffiti on billboards advertising cigarettes and alcohol mostly - sometimes<br/>
pointing out falsehoods inherent in the visuals, like yellowing the model&#39;s<br/>
teeth.<br/>
