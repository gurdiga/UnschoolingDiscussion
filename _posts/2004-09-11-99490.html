<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381336193">The kids have really been interested in Vikings lately (I&#39;m  reading a book <br/>
aloud to the kids about Leif Erickson) and this has really  sparked some <br/>
interest to find out more about them.  Are there any good  fiction/non-fiction <br/>
movies out there about vikings?  I just couldn&#39;t come  up with one...<br/>

Does &quot;Erik the Viking&quot; count?<br/>
<br/>
Do you get the History Channel? They have a whole series called &quot;Barbarians&quot;<br/>
which includes a Viking episode. I would think that it&#39;s on DVD from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872015873"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;There is also a movie called just &quot;The Vikings&quot; staring Kirk Douglas and <br/>
&gt;Tony Curtis that I have been told by Norse religion reconstructionists is <br/>
&gt;pretty true to the historys.  Surprisingly so, given the era.  I caught a <br/>
&gt;few minutes of it recently and it looked good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039673389">There&#39;s an English series of books called Horrible Histories and one<br/>
of the books is titled _The Vicious Vikings_ by Terry Deary, published<br/>
by Scholastic Inc. My son loves all of them: _The Awesome Egyptians_,<br/>
_The Groovy Greeks_, _The Measly Middle Ages_ and _The Rotten Romans.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953595540">Just wanted to second this.  My son is currently immersing himself <br/>
in Ancient Greek and Ancient Egyptian cultures and loves this <br/>
series.  We also have his _Cruel Kings and Mean Queens_, as well as <br/>
_Top Ten Greek Legends_ and _Top Ten Shakespeare Stories_.  Really, <br/>
anything by Terry Deary is worth getting.  Half.com and Ebay are <br/>
good places to find his books.  <br/>
