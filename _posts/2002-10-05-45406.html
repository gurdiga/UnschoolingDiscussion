&lt;&lt; The big glitch - she doesn&#39;t really want to give up her current lessons <br/>
and <br/>
 there is no WAY we can pay for both private lessons and the 4-H program.<br/>
 <br/>
 So - this is a difficult decision for her. Any thought-provoking insight or <br/>
 ideas or comments or whatever -- would be appreciated. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don&#39;t think this is hugely insightful or anything...but did you know <br/>
you can register your family as a 4-H club?<br/>
Then you could get their &quot;curriculum&quot; for free and do the program (with the <br/>
lessons she&#39;s already doing) all  on your own and she&#39;d get 4-H awards for it.<br/>
