<div id="ygrps-yiv-308603224">&quot;Now I have to deal with having a baby in a foreign country. I don&#39;t even know<br/>
 how to get a midwife plus I&#39;ve heard horror stories about forced caesareans (I<br/>
 want a VBAC) and forced vaccinations and circumcision. I&#39;m tempted to fly home<br/>
 where its all familiar!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, now Shyrley...we ARE a free country. You honestly don&#39;t think the people at this list would put up with forced anything do you?!!! :)<br/>
I&#39;ve given birth at home, I&#39;ve had three hospital births and nothing happened in the hospital that I did not allow to happen. It was a choice to be there, so I had accepted that a certain amount of monitoring would be required, other than that, I was in control of my birth. Choosing a good hospital would be necessary of course. <br/>
Or finding a lay midwife if you are going to have a home birth.<br/>
If you&#39;re considered higher risk and a midwife won&#39;t take you, you could always seek out a nurse midwife, which makes a hospital birth much more empowering.<br/>
No one can vaccinate your baby or circumsize them without your consent. Keep your baby with you and they won&#39;t have any choice about it! I never had any problems with that stuff though. And I have two totally unvaccinated kids, one that started and I stopped them, the other got the full round before I had researched it enough. :( poor guy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, about the age difference....<br/>
I have 11 years between my oldest and youngest and it&#39;s great. Sure, the legos and other small items were a worry for a while. But the kids adapted and learned to help me with that and Trevor is a fabulous babysitter, something I wouldn&#39;t have if there was less of an age gap.<br/>
Jalen loves his older siblings dearly. I think a big age gap can provide opportunities you don&#39;t get with kids closer in age. Greater maturity and less reason for conflict is a big one!!<br/>
It is exhausting sometimes though, that I will admit!<br/>
