<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We had our son&#39;s 5th birthday party on Saturday, 
and it was a hoot....a feww families couldn&#39;tmake it, but we had a wonderful 
time....we had childrens aged babies to teenagers, and I really like the idea of 
mixed age parties, the interaction between the children is great.&nbsp; One 13 
year old boy holding a small baby, while the 14 month old just laughs , and 
laughs , and laughs , one of those real , joyous laughs, that gets ya happy on 
the inside...the magician was great.....he magickly made a dove a ppear, name d 
spirit..he even made her cage appear...and he granted Zain with some wonderful 
lifetime wishes for his special day.....to have many many many more birthdays, 
to always have someone to love, and alwyas have someone who loves him...he was 
wonderful, I would reccommend his spirited magick to anyone in the Seattle, or 
Snohomish COunty area.....the parents all got along well......people from all 
different ethnicity, schooling methods, jobs, and backgrounds....it was nice I 
think for the adults to relax, while the kids all had a good time...we did 
potluck to cut back on the costs, and it worked out well, especially for people 
with alllergies, and such, as thye are not left out of eating some good foods as 
well.&nbsp; Over all we had a wonderful time, and were Blessed with the 
presenceof friends and family(our friends)....and our son is now the Big 
FIVE..Just thought I&#39;d share all that with ya..Many Blessings.
