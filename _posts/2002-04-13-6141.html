Are there schools that really let you go when you want and do what you<br/>
want?<br/>

Once I looked up &quot;open classroom&quot; looking for a book from years back, and <br/>
found there are a dozen or so schools using that format!! Three or so were in <br/>
Minnesota, I think.<br/>

I doubt these are that loose, but they might be worth visiting for using the <br/>
1960&#39;s school-reform theories Holt and others were proposing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sudbury Valley has a list of schools that are based on their model on their<br/>
webpage at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sudval.org">http://www.sudval.org</a><br/>
<br/>
As far as I know the philsophy would allow kids to show up only when they<br/>
wanted to but the state laws may require mandatory attendence.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640467600">Hi Carolyn,<br/>
<br/>
Check out Sudbury Valley School, Framingham, Mass, and schools modelled after them.  No curriculum. Their website appears to be down right this minute, but it&#39;s at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sudval.org/.">http://www.sudval.org/.</a><br/>
