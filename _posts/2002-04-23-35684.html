&lt;&lt; He said, &quot;Oh, that means it&#39;s Earth Day today. What does Earth Day mean?&quot;<br/>
 I told him it&#39;s a day about remembering to keep the earth alive and healthy <br/>
and growing, planting things, etc. <br/>
 And he said &quot;Well, shouldn&#39;t you do that every day?&quot;<br/>
 I said, &quot;yeah, you&#39;re right! We *should* do that every day.&quot;<br/>
 LOL! I thought it was funny. :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the other unschoolers was just saying last week that Earth Day really <br/>
irked her because we should be conscious of caring for the Earth every day!!!<br/>
How true.<br/>
Tell him it&#39;s to bring awareness to people that might not be thinking about <br/>
it every day, that&#39;s the only explanation I could  come up with .....??<br/>
