I wrote a response, but when I tried to paste in the text from this webpage, <br/>
it gummed up the e-mail totally.   Sorry.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s self explanatory in the file, and it&#39;s something I wrote because someone <br/>
on a homeschooling list talked about boredom as an emotion, and it really <br/>
change my point of view a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
The good thing about going to the page, too, is there&#39;s a link at the bottom <br/>
with other people&#39;s responses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476012797">&lt;&lt;&lt;How do you respond or not respond to boredom in your home?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was a common occurance when the kids were de-schooling.  It is quite rare<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I think boredom is a catch phrase for &quot;I feel emotionally itchy and I can&#39;t<br/>
figure out how to scratch it.&quot;  It could mean anything from &quot;I&#39;ve stopped a<br/>
project and not sure what I want to do next&quot; to &quot;My period is due any day<br/>
now&quot; to &quot;Marsie got the big cookie instead of me&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t make a big deal out of boredom.  We don&#39;t see it as &quot;something you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be.&quot;  We acknowledge it as an emotional state and how we handle it<br/>
depends on the kids, the time of day, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I might suggest reading a book together, or some other activity.  I might<br/>
just give a hug and scratch their back.  I might make a joke.  Depends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075149694">***How do you respond or not respond to boredom in your home?***<br/>
<br/>
I always respond to boredom, because I feel like my time with Dylan is<br/>
short enough we should make the most of it. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Really, we&#39;re rarely bored, but sometimes someone feels restless and the<br/>
best thing for that is a change of scenery.  <br/>
<br/>
We go.  We jump in the car and go for a drive.  We make some sandwiches<br/>
and go for a picnic.  We grab our day packs and go for a hike.  We pick<br/>
up some corn and go to the park to feed the geese. <br/>
<br/>
We live in a small town that until just recently didn&#39;t even have a<br/>
bookstore.   Lots of the interesting things we do are in other towns.  <br/>
Sometimes we just drive to an art gallery or museum we&#39;ve never been to,<br/>
or haven&#39;t been to in a long time.   Sometimes we find a used book store<br/>
we&#39;ve never been to.  Sometimes we go to a restaurant we&#39;ve never been to<br/>
before and order the weirdest sounding thing from the menu.  <br/>
<br/>
Once we stopped in place where they make neon signs and asked for a tour.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
Sometimes we go to the greenhouse and play in the earthworm beds. <br/>
Sometimes we go to the cemetery and do gravestone rubbings.   <br/>
<br/>
In the winter we can go to the sledding hill, just two blocks away.  <br/>
It&#39;s snowing here today, that&#39;s what made me think of sledding. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago we went to look for sapphires.  <br/>
<br/>
I think parents need to be open to all the possibilities.  There was<br/>
recently a post, asking if the child really understood he could do<br/>
anything.  That&#39;s important but what&#39;s more important (because often kids<br/>
can&#39;t drive themselves to interesting places) is that the parents are<br/>
aware that the world is bigger than their own house or yard or library.  <br/>
Parents need to be imaginative, spontaneous and excitable. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Asking a kid who&#39;s bored what he wants to do really doesn&#39;t help.   If he<br/>
knew what he wanted he could do it.  Getting active and doing something<br/>
new revives creativity.   I always think of those times as an opportunity<br/>
for us to step out of the box and make discoveries.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Get in the car and go somewhere.  Drive with the windows down and <br/>
good music playing loud.  Look at things.  If you see something or <br/>
someplace interesting while out, stop and check it out.  Go for a <br/>
walk.  Library, bookstore (the bookstore works for us sometimes <br/>
because my son - 7 - just enjoys playing with the train and toys <br/>
they have set up in the children&#39;s section while my daughters can <br/>
spend hours browsing, and I get latte.  &lt;wink&gt;)  <br/>
<br/>
Shingle the dog house.  Paint the shed.  Plant a tree.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there a community college or community center where you are that <br/>
offers classes that he&#39;d be interested in?  We&#39;ve done T-ball, art, <br/>
dancing... whatever they&#39;re into when the schedule comes out, if <br/>
anything.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re doing the park days, right?  We have one main park day that <br/>
we absolutely don&#39;t miss!  We&#39;ve added a second one because my son <br/>
wanted to do more with kids at the park - once a week wasn&#39;t enough <br/>
for him.    <br/>
<br/>
Field trips - animal shelter, museums, auto body shop.  What&#39;s he <br/>
into?  There are lots of places that aren&#39;t really seen as field <br/>
trip opportunities - auto body shop for example.  :) What kind of <br/>
place would he be interested in?  Just call the places.  Somebody <br/>
will usually be willing to show you around.  If not, call another.  <br/>
<br/>
Plan a day trip together.  I don&#39;t know where you are, so can&#39;t come <br/>
up with specific ideas.  One thing that we liked to do, and havent&#39; <br/>
in a while (I&#39;ll need to consult with the kids and see if they&#39;re <br/>
game) was to get up before sunrise and hit the beach ...then sit <br/>
there and watch the sun come up.  Cold but really great.  We&#39;d bring <br/>
bagels, etc. to eat... and the little birds that run back and forth <br/>
with the tide... hysterical.<br/>
<br/>
Would he be interested in volunteer work?  Many of the people here <br/>
volunteer at the homeless shelter... Others volunteer at the <br/>
community theater. There are bound to be opportunities of some <br/>
nature wherever you are.  <br/>
<br/>
How about watching a TV show being taped?  Even if you&#39;re not near <br/>
LA or NY or whatnot, surely there are smaller local shows <br/>
everywhere... (this was one of ours!  The kids are chomping at the <br/>
bit to do it again.)<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s nothing at home to alleviate the boredom, leave.  The <br/>
laundry can wait.<br/>

As I read this it occurred to me that I don&#39;t often hear the kids saying<br/>
they are bored anymore. So maybe it is a part of  the deschooling process<br/>
and learning how to be self-directed.<br/>
When they do come to me saying they are bored,  often they want me-either a<br/>
hug or just to do something with me.<br/>

Cameron went through a bored stage---just after leaving school. Duncan, <br/>
always unschooled, has never used the word. Cameron hasn&#39;t been bored in a couple <br/>
of years. I think you&#39;re spot-on, there!<br/>
