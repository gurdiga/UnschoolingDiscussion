<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682843928">what about this? I&#39;ve been clicking all over the place through this <br/>
list in the past few days heh heh my kids got a definite unschooling <br/>
day TODAY! Watched movies and played puter games,and read. We girls <br/>
exercised together, and Robby helped with the bread. Oh. They cleaned <br/>
their rooms, too. <br/>
<br/>
Okay. I&#39;ve been clicking all over the place and reading about not <br/>
making the kids do things that aren&#39;t interesting to them. Cool. <br/>
Should I quit doing the checkbook? <br/>
<br/>
The checking account BORES ME TO TEARS!!!!!!!!! I HATE it! I never <br/>
want to do it, and never once have I balanced it. Not once. But in <br/>
our family, I am the bookkeeper, because my husband has short term <br/>
memory loss and Severe Procrastinitis (the first, from a bad car <br/>
crash w/head injuries, the second...LOL )<br/>
<br/>
If I didn&#39;t do it, we&#39;d be in deep trouble. In fact, I took over when <br/>
his mismanagement GOT US into deep trouble with the bank, as well as <br/>
lots of local merchants, and I&#39;ve been digging us out for a year or <br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
You see my point? Sometimes life hands you things that you 1)don&#39;t <br/>
like 2) aren&#39;t any good at and 3) find extremely stressing, boring, <br/>
and futile...but you HAVE TO DO IT ANYWAY. Mind you, I don&#39;t believe <br/>
that children should have a steady diet of this kind of thing, but <br/>
isn&#39;t there some value in giving the kids things to do, that they <br/>
don&#39;t want to do? Doesn&#39;t it build character or something? <br/>
<br/>
Someone&#39;s website (sandra dodd?) has Calvin (of Calvin & <br/>
Hobbes)...well, it shows the poor kid sitting all bored at his school <br/>
desk, but there was no picture of him coming away from his comic book <br/>
reading with a twitch, or his eyeballs spinning out of his head from <br/>
watching so much TV. These are also classic Calvin and Hobbes images. <br/>
Hmmm, I think I know the answer, and it, too, comes from C&H...his <br/>
dad, handing him a snow shovel, showing him a vast expanse to shovel, <br/>
and telling him it builds character.<br/>
<br/>
Oh my word. I&#39;m coming up with questions and answers SIMULTANEOUSLY! <br/>
I think I understand this unschooling thing and it&#39;s scaring me! LOL<br/>
<br/>
still brewing things in the ole cranium<br/>

But unschooling isn&#39;t about always doing what you totally enjoy.  I do the <br/>
checkbook as well.  And for the same reasons as you.  But I don&#39;t do it <br/>
because someone is telling me that I have to.  I do it because the <br/>
consequences of me not doing it would be terrible.  And I enjoy knowing how <br/>
much money I have or do not have and not being overdrawn and paying those <br/>
consequences.  And unschooling isn&#39;t about making kids do anything, <br/>
interesting or not it should be their choice.<br/>

<br/>
My children are not always doing what they enjoy.  They clean their room <br/>
because they want to find something.  They don&#39;t enjoy it.  And they aren&#39;t <br/>
doing it because I am making them, they do it for a reason all their own.  My <br/>
son reads the gaming book not because he totally enjoys it but because he <br/>
needs the information inside to go further with the game.  Unschooling is <br/>
about making your own choices not being told what to do and when and how.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854181852">This is my dad&#39;s biggest complaint about my homeschooling (he does not know that I am <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; but he knows me well enough to know that I am not going to be overly<br/>
structured about it. He thinks that I am making a big mistake by not requiring Jason (6 yo)<br/>
to practice writing or other things that he does not like. We had a huge discussion and <br/>
he thinks that Jason needs to learn that sometimes you have to do things that you do not<br/>
like to do.<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about that and I realize that there are tons of ways that Jason will<br/>
learn this on his own and I don&#39;t have to &quot;teach&quot; him this lesson by forcing him to <br/>
do things. He has a little brother, so sometimes he does not get to do what he wants<br/>
to do. And you know where I have seen him really learn this? Computer games! Jason gets<br/>
*so* upset at not being able to complete the game on the first try. He hates playing and<br/>
losing. But he also has practiced and mastered games before, so he has learned the <br/>
joy of getting better at something. He has learned that sometimes you have to do<br/>
something (deal with the frustration of losing) to get a reward (winning the game).<br/>
<br/>
I have to also imagine that somewhere down the line there will be a time when Jason has<br/>
to do or learn something that he does not want to do in order to get something he does<br/>
want. That is life, right? And when that time comes, because it is his choice, he will<br/>
do it and learn from it. My dad keeps talking about the self-discipline that is learned<br/>
in school...is it really self-discipline if it is imposed by a teacher? I guess that if<br/>
you buy into the working for grades (like my dad and I both did) then yes, you can<br/>
develop good discipline...but what if you don&#39;t care about doing well? I doubt that<br/>
you would learn about self-discipline. BUT if there is something that you care about<br/>
and want to achieve, *that* is where you will learn self-discipline. So making Jason <br/>
do writing every day will not teach him self-discipline...it will teach him (if I am <br/>
lucky) that he can make me happy by doing what I want him to do (or if I am not lucky)<br/>
it will teach him to hate writing.<br/>
<br/>
Why does this stuff make so much sense to me but has my dad shaking his head?<br/>

<br/>
You could if you really hate it.   I know someone who cashes his paycheck<br/>
and pays all his bills in cash or postal money order.   He&#39;s never had a<br/>
checking account and he&#39;s 43 years old.<br/>
Who is *making* you use a checkbook?    Checking accounts are not<br/>
mandatory and in fact, by the time our children are grown they may even<br/>
be obsolete.   <br/>
<br/>
***If I didn&#39;t do it, we&#39;d be in deep trouble. In fact, I took over when <br/>
his mismanagement GOT US into deep trouble with the bank, as well as <br/>
lots of local merchants, and I&#39;ve been digging us out for a year or <br/>
so.***<br/>
<br/>
Even if you don&#39;t have an interest in balancing the checkbook it sounds<br/>
like you have an interest in keeping your finances straight.   It<br/>
benefits you in some way to know how much money you have to spend on<br/>
groceries every week.   The check book *is* a choice.   For that matter,<br/>
maintaining a home that requires you to pay utilities is a choice.  <br/>
Buying on credit is a choice.   Purchasing *anything* is a choice.   We<br/>
make these choices because they make our lives better or easier.  We make<br/>
them because the alternative is less appealing.  But it is all choice.   <br/>
At any time we can make different ones. <br/>
<br/>
***You see my point? Sometimes life hands you things that you 1)don&#39;t <br/>
like 2) aren&#39;t any good at and 3) find extremely stressing, boring, <br/>

<br/>
My mom used to burn our toast every morning.   She&#39;d give us black toast,<br/>
(not to be mean, just because we had a wonky toaster) and tell us it<br/>
would build character.   I was pleased, many years later, to send her an<br/>
article about research claiming charcoal was carcinogenic. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of anything about burnt toast that helped me be a better<br/>
person. <br/>
<br/>
If your mother had you balance her checkbook can you be sure that would<br/>
make you like doing it now?    What would the value of that preparation<br/>
be?    To just start your suffering a little sooner?<br/>
<br/>
Talking about things we might have to do or face even if we don&#39;t want<br/>
to; some women become victims of spousal abuse.  Should we beat our girl<br/>
children so they know what to look out for?   Someday our children may<br/>
need surgery.   Do we set them up for a nose job in preparation for a<br/>
maybe, someday kidney transplant?    Do you give them medicine when they<br/>
don&#39;t need it to get them ready for when they might?<br/>
<br/>
Our kids will end up doing all kinds of things that might not be wildly<br/>
interesting to them.   They will clean their toilets because they want<br/>
their dog to have fresh drinking water.   They will get dressed because<br/>
they don&#39;t want to shock their bosses.   They will pay for items because<br/>
they don&#39;t want to get arrested for stealing. <br/>
Just like us they will make choices about the things that will make their<br/>
lives better or easier and they will do what it takes to accomplish that.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is it really worth it to have kids unhappy about doing dishes, or<br/>
dusting?   Joyce asked that question I think.   Are clean dishes  more<br/>
important than a happy child?    Really.   In thirty years will you be<br/>
more pleased to remember a clean house or happy kids?   In thirty years<br/>
which will matter more?<br/>

Well no you really don&#39;t HAVE to do it. So why do you? Because it&#39;s <br/>
important for you to have it done so that you know you won&#39;t get into <br/>
financial trouble. So you can either do it and not like it but not like the <br/>
outcome of not doing it even more. OR, you could find an easier way to deal <br/>
with doing something you want done but don&#39;t like. Hire someone to do it for <br/>
you. Know someone good with numbers who would enjoy the challenge and some <br/>
extra money? You could do something on the computer. Not familiar with the <br/>
programs as I refuse to do any finances anything but the good old pen and <br/>
paper way. You could find maybe an easier way to manage it. I round <br/>
everything off higher than what was spent in $5.00 increments. That way <br/>
there is extra in the bank for mistakes and if there are not missed checks <br/>
or withdrawals, I take out the extra to save.<br/>
<br/>
Point being no one really has to do anything but die when it&#39;s their time. <br/>
We all have choices and if the choices we make disappoint us, we have <br/>
choices to fix that. Find another way or do something else. I don&#39;t want my <br/>
kids stuck in a job, relationship or situation that they don&#39;t like and stay <br/>
there because they feel like they HAVE to. I want them to have the freedom <br/>
to figure other ways and take other choices and take chances to find what <br/>
makes them happy. THAT builds character.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you want your checkbook to be mismanaged?  Then take care of it.  <br/>
Do your kids want their rooms cleaned?  Then they&#39;ll do it.  If they <br/>
don&#39;t care, they won&#39;t.  If you care that their rooms get cleaned but <br/>
they don&#39;t, then you should do it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make beds.  I think it&#39;s a waste of time.  For other people, <br/>
it&#39;s really important.  If someone came to my house and asked me why <br/>
my beds weren&#39;t made, I&#39;d say because I don&#39;t care enough about <br/>
having them made to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got the concept down.  I see the wisdom in it. I&#39;m really, <br/>
really trying to make it work.  But sometimes when the house looks <br/>
like it does right now, and I am facing a few hours of cleaning in <br/>
order to shape it up, I get frustrated.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh doesn&#39;t necessarily agree with me either.  He kind of does, but a <br/>
messy house bothers him more than it bothers me.  Today he came home <br/>
and said that if he has to clean the house when he gets home, don&#39;t <br/>
expect him to do anything else. He is in a grumpy mood because he has <br/>
a bachache and didn&#39;t sleep well last night, but it still made me <br/>
feel bad.  I felt guilty that I wasn&#39;t keeping up enough.  And I felt <br/>
overwhelmed, because I want to help take care of his needs too, and <br/>
he obviously needs the house to be neater than it is.  But if I have <br/>
3 kids messing up faster than I can clean up, and they need me to do <br/>
things with them instead of cleaning up, well...you&#39;re going to have <br/>
a messy house.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids attempted to make a pinata and left the mess behind.  Dd made <br/>
up her own cake recipe on her own, wrote down all the ingredients, <br/>
stapled the two papers together, and made the cake.  She did no <br/>
dishes and didn&#39;t clean up at all.  She dropped a bag of cornflour <br/>
while she was getting stuff out of the cupboard.  The bag ripped and <br/>
spilled on the floor and she just left it there.  Dd played with <br/>
balloons, vinegar and baking soda on the diningroom floor. The three <br/>
year old has been into filling balloons with water (not full enough <br/>
to break) and asking people to tie them for him.   There are balloons <br/>
all over the floor in several rooms of the house.  No one cleaned up <br/>
their messes on the kitchen table from any food they got themselves <br/>
all day.  Someone got him or her self a drink, spilled it on the <br/>
table, and it never got cleaned up.  There are toys all over the <br/>
playroom floor and all over the bedrooms.  The sink is stacked with <br/>
dishes.  Now I have to go work on cleaning for several hours instead <br/>
of resting before bed, and that stresses me out.  I guess it is good <br/>
that they cleaned the livingroom up without being told because they <br/>
wanted it to be their &quot;house&quot;.  But the rest of the house is going to <br/>
take some work--at least 3 or 4 hours.  And what will really get me <br/>
stressed is if they say, &quot;Mommy, can&#39;t you play a game with <br/>
me?&quot;  &quot;Mommy, help me with my computer game&quot;.  And I&#39;m trying to <br/>
finally get some semblence of order to the house. <br/>
<br/>
I was VERY frustrated today.  But then I thought about dd&#39;s <br/>
experiment today.  She put a balloon around the rim of the vinegar <br/>
and dumped some vinegar in it.  Then she put baking soda in an old <br/>
shampoo bottle and put the balloon around the rim of the shampoo <br/>
bottle and it blew the balloon up.  She figured that out all on her <br/>
own, with no experiment books or anyone putting any ideas in her <br/>
head.  And I thought that it was so cool that she lived in a house <br/>
where she could make a mess.  <br/>
<br/>
And they DID clean the livingroom up, all on their own.  They put all <br/>
their toys away, folded all the blankets, arranged the pillows on the <br/>
couch, AND put away all of the laundry I had started to fold.  <br/>
<br/>
But the house is still a mess and I&#39;m still frustrated and tired and <br/>
stressed.  I REALLy need to work on just getting more joy from <br/>
serving my family.  It is not an easy thing for me to do.  <br/>
<br/>
 I bought that new Hoover hard floor cleaner, and I&#39;m going to go try <br/>
it out. Imagine not having to mop or scrub on hands and knees <br/>
anymore!  I&#39;m going to go make myself have fun with this. :)<br/>

<br/>
and I didn&#39;t find any animations besides that one.<br/>
But comic books aren&#39;t school.<br/>
And television isn&#39;t school.<br/>
And using an anti-school animation which involves Calvin & Hobbes doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean I subscribe to a Calvin & Hobbe&#39;s religion.<br/>

Okay. I&#39;ve been clicking all over the place and reading about not <br/>

<br/>
Nobody is making you do that checkbook.  You&#39;re doing it because the natural <br/>
consequences irritate you.<br/>
<br/>
You could deal only in cash, or credit cards.<br/>
You could switch to a debit card and keep a running total on an envelope, and <br/>
check that against the account each month.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids can&#39;t find their stuff, they&#39;ll find better ways to take care of <br/>
it.  If they never return their friends&#39; phone calls, their friends will stop <br/>
calling them (or maybe get grumpy and yell at them).<br/>
<br/>
Children will learn and develop character because of what happens because of <br/>
what they do and don&#39;t do.   <br/>
<br/>
By the checkbook question, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re imagining that if parents <br/>
don&#39;t make kids do things, that kids will slowly grind to a halt.  But that&#39;s <br/>
not how it is.<br/>
<br/>
People say if unschoolers don&#39;t get up at a certain time they&#39;ll never be <br/>
able to get up to go to work if they get a job.  That makes no sense.  <br/>
Getting up at 6:30 every day for years doesn&#39;t make someone want to get up at <br/>
6:30 for the rest of their lives.  It more likely will make them want to <br/>
sleep in.   When Ninja Turtles was on at 7:00 a.m. or whenever, years ago, <br/>
Kirby got up every morning with his own alarm clock to tape it and watch it.  <br/>
 When he has to go to work at 11:30 or 9:30 or when he has worked the crazy <br/>
shifts at conventions, he sets an alarm for an hour before he has to be <br/>
there, and he takes a shower and he gets there.   <br/>
<br/>
Practice wouldn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The checking account BORES ME TO TEARS!!!!!!!!! I HATE it! I never <br/>
want to do it, and never once have I balanced it. Not once. But in <br/>
our family, I am the bookkeeper,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a kid who might be interested in helping you, and maybe taking it <br/>
over (or doing it sometimes)?<br/>

&quot;Get to&quot; or &quot;have to&quot;?<br/>
There&#39;s a profound difference, isn&#39;t there?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;d like to see them be <br/>
good. By that, I mean, morally upright, with something of a work <br/>
ethic, kind, gentle, respectful, humble, with hearts full of <br/>
gratitude, capable of serving others, giving, patient, self-<br/>

<br/>
Probably your definition of &quot;morally upright&quot; would be narrower than mine, <br/>
but my children have all the traits you have listed above, and they are <br/>
already happy.  Happiness isn&#39;t something I expect them to have when they&#39;re <br/>
grown up, if they&#39;re good now.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some of it...it&#39;s gonna come from myself and <br/>
their father, period. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You believe that, and so you act accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
But what if you met my children and saw them have all those traits you named?<br/>
Would you say &quot;Well obviously, they got those things from their mother and <br/>
father making them do things&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I would also say that, in the midst of our training them to be <br/>
obedient,....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t train our children to be obedient, but they don&#39;t ignore us.  They <br/>
really care about what we feel about what they do.  That transfers to other <br/>
relationships.  Obedience doesn&#39;t transfer.  (Or when it does, it can have <br/>
some bad effects.  Some children are told to obey all adults.  VERY bad <br/>
advice.  Some are told to obey all priests and nuns.   Not as many as USED to <br/>
be told that!)<br/>

either, but no one threatens us with taking away cherished things or <br/>
not allowing us to come and go freely if we don&#39;t do them.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone is feeling mean inside of their hearts, but you won&#39;t <br/>
allow them to &quot;be unkind&quot;, are they really learning how to be kind, <br/>
or are they learning how to put on a false face to mask their <br/>
feelings? <br/>
<br/>
Is it really self control if they are only doing it because they <br/>
don&#39;t want to get punished or because they think their mom will love <br/>
them more if they do it?  I think self control comes when one learns <br/>
how to truly control one&#39;s self.  And you can&#39;t control yourself if <br/>
you have someone else controlling you. <br/>

<br/>
Are these qualities important enough to you that you model them to your<br/>
children?  Are you respectful to them?  Humble in their presence?  Is<br/>
your heart full of gratitude toward them?  Do you serve them, are you<br/>
giving, and patient with them and self controlled?   Have you<br/>
demonstrated a good work ethic? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking because I think if a parent is frustrated or agitated or anal<br/>
about keeping house and requires other to help, that&#39;s not the best<br/>
demonstration of work ethic, serving others, or respect.<br/>
<br/>
***Each one of them does what chores I <br/>
assign...without complaining. Really, they do. Because I have trained <br/>
them to do so. ***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t doubt this, I&#39;m sure you have things running the way you like.  <br/>
But there are others here, myself included who have not assigned chores<br/>
to children, and who have not *trained* them, and the children still<br/>
help.    They help willingly, happily even.<br/>
<br/>
***I would say that, none of those qualities listed above will come to <br/>
children naturally.***<br/>
<br/>
This hasn&#39;t been my experience.   My son has been very naturally<br/>
demonstrating all those things you mentioned for many years.  <br/>
<br/>
***Some of it...it&#39;s gonna come from myself and <br/>
their father, period.***<br/>
<br/>
I like to tell myself that Dylan is the person he is because his father<br/>
and I have modeled it for him.  Maybe he would be this way no matter who<br/>
his parents were, but I believe he is kind because we have been kind to<br/>
him.   I believe he&#39;s respectful because we show him respect.    I<br/>
believe he&#39;s patient and humble and moral and giving and self controlled<br/>
because we have tried to be all these things with him, to give him a good<br/>
model.    But even more than that I think he has all these qualities<br/>
because they are natural human qualities, present in every baby from the<br/>
start and only need love and nurturing to blossom.   <br/>
<br/>
My son is ten and he has several jobs.  He feeds and plays with the<br/>
neighbors dog on the weekends when they are gone.  He lets her in and out<br/>
of their house.  He&#39;s very responsible about it and he&#39;s done it now for<br/>
over a year.    He feeds another neighbor&#39;s fish when they&#39;re not home,<br/>
and they travel for their work so he&#39;s at their house at least every<br/>
other week for several days.    Last year he was invited to the Green<br/>
Party convention in our state... a personal invitation from the<br/>
coordinating chairman.   He was invited because he had collected<br/>
signatures for ballot initiatives in our area.   He really wanted to go,<br/>
but by the time he heard about it he had already committed himself to<br/>
feeding the fish.   There was no way to do both, because the fish needed<br/>
to be fed twice a day and the convention was far enough away that we<br/>
would have to stay overnight  to attend the meetings.    His father<br/>
offered to take over fish duty so he could go, but Dylan refused.   He<br/>
said it was his responsibility and he wanted Gail to know she could count<br/>
on him.   He was nine years old.<br/>
 <br/>
I have never required him to do chores, but he did dishes twice today<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t feeling well, and just now when I was coughing he<br/>
brought me some peppermint tea.   I didn&#39;t ask him to do the dishes.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t ask him to bring me tea, he just did it because he knew it would<br/>
help me.    He thanked me for taking him to his karate class.   So here<br/>
are demonstrations of several of the things you mention in a child who<br/>
has never been required to do chores, who has never been required to do<br/>
&quot;school work&quot;, who  has never been spanked or punished or threatened.   <br/>
<br/>
***And I would also say that, in the midst of our training them to be <br/>
obedient, and giving them chores that they DON&#39;T WANT TO DO, my <br/>
children are happy.***<br/>
<br/>
I believe you have happy children.   I&#39;m sad that you think of children<br/>
as things that need to be trained and obedient.   In *my* perfect world<br/>
of moral uprightness parents would respect their children as perfect<br/>
learning individuals and training and obedience would never be used in a<br/>
sentence about children. <br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s happiness is all important  and I work every day to ensure it.  <br/>
Someday he may be a parent and I hope I will have demonstrated how well<br/>
love and respect can nourish a family.   <br/>

can seize that opportunity to brainstorm other solutions. Quicken? Not only<br/>
does it balance your checkbook, but it can write out the checks for you :-)<br/>

Credit cards with a low monthly credit limit? Maybe one that has a limit you<br/>
feel comfortable with and another for those times when you need that extra.<br/>
<br/>
We can also realize that we&#39;re *choosing* to do the disliked thing because<br/>
we want to avoid the consequences of not doing it. We don&#39;t *have to*. It&#39;s<br/>
a choice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With all due respect, Heidi, I would ask you to consider this one <br/>
thing.  Can you let go of the idea that *you have trained them* to do <br/>
anything?  Can you see it more that they have chosen to behave in a certain <br/>
way that made sense to them at the time (i.e., not behaving in the way that <br/>
you were attempting to &quot;train&quot; them to would have yielded unacceptable <br/>
consequences to them).  They could have just as easily gone the other way, <br/>
as many children do, or they could have become passive-aggressive (let you <br/>
*think* they&#39;re doing what you say but going against you behind your <br/>
back).  I really think it&#39;s important for us to remember that we have the <br/>
choice to behave in the most reasonable way to us at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Because of their angry and violent reactions, my parents were very scary <br/>
and threatening to me when I was little.  My best response to them at the <br/>
time was not to be honest with them; this was my way of protecting myself <br/>
when I was a little girl, and it was a reasonable choice to make at the <br/>
time, and although I felt badly about it as a little girl, I understand it <br/>
now.  But, another kid might have toed the line under the same <br/>
circumstances; that would just have been their most reasonable reaction to <br/>
the set of circumstances.  My reaction was the most sensible to me at the <br/>
time.  I was afraid of my parents!  Now, my parents may have thought that <br/>
they were &quot;training me up&quot; to be some ideal of theirs; I&#39;m pretty sure that <br/>
my reaction was not their desired outcome.  We had a lot of nasty scenes <br/>
when I was young because of my not being able to be trusted by them, but I <br/>
can see now that in my eyes, they were really the ones who could not be <br/>
trusted and I responded accordingly.  I was not able to articulate that at <br/>
all or even understand it when I was little, and, of course, I bought into <br/>
their version of the whole thing.  But, in retrospect I can see that my <br/>
choices were a reasonable response to the perceived threat they posed to me.<br/>
<br/>
I think our relationships with our children require a lot more empathy and <br/>
thought.  I really think we have to let go of the notion that we can push <br/>
our children to perform in some way that WE chose.<br/>
<br/>
I really liked this T shirt I saw at a LLL conference when my son was very <br/>
little.  It said, &quot;You have to be what you want your children to <br/>
become.&quot;  But now, I think it is important to realize that our children <br/>
will make their own best choices that make the most sense to them.  Trying <br/>
to push them in a particular direction may not yield the kinds of results <br/>
we anticipate or desire.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this makes sense.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know Heidi, this is how I was taught to think. There is a <br/>
strange aversion to the idea of happiness in many Christian <br/>
circles. Happiness is often pitted against joy and joy is seen as <br/>
some kind of experience of living that is not happy, but willing to <br/>
be content in spite of negative circumstances. This has always <br/>
puzzled me.<br/>
<br/>
Recently i realized that it is a method for keeping a person from <br/>
evaluating whether or not his/her life is indeed happy. A person <br/>
can always say, &quot;Well, the goal wasn&#39;t to be happy, it was to be <br/>
joyful in spite of horrible or hard or dull circumstances. So I&#39;ll just <br/>
say I&#39;m joyful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But what is the point of an emotion that you don&#39;t experience? <br/>
And why is happiness something we wouldn&#39;t aim for?<br/>
<br/>
I know.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s because deep down we fear the experience of pleasure. We <br/>
wee pleasure as leading us into selfish, sinful behaviors. We <br/>
think that pleasure and selfishness go together.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since willingness to serve others (for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; instance) is one of the things I want to see in my children, they <br/>
 </span></blockquote>get <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to practice serving in our family. In order to keep the household <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them to do so. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last night I shaed with my dh about the chores ideas explained <br/>
here on this list. We, too, have chores that the kids have learned <br/>
to do as part of our family. Since there is no one rebelling <br/>
against the idea and we are late comers to a total unschooling <br/>
view, we&#39;ve decided not to rock that boat at this time. But we also <br/>
realized last night that there is a danger is assigning kids to <br/>
&quot;serve&quot; each other. <br/>
<br/>
They may learn how to fulfill their duties, but is that the same as <br/>
service? Yesterday my middle child saw me cleaning up the <br/>
kitchen (I didn&#39;t ask for help, I was just doing it while they played <br/>
on the X box). He got off the game he was playing and said, &quot;Hey <br/>
mom. You&#39;re doing all the work. I&#39;ve played all morning. Can I <br/>
help you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, THAT is service! and I stood there stunned. We&#39;ve been at <br/>
this one week.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I would say that, none of those qualities listed above will come <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children naturally. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I staunchly disagree with this statement. Some of the most kind <br/>
actions I&#39;ve ever seen have been offered by two year olds. I <br/>
remember when my daughter was a newborn, my 2 yos got his <br/>
favorite toy truck (yes it was all metal) and dragged a chair to the <br/>
moses basket on the table. He dropped it into the basket with <br/>
her as a gift.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see: kind, capable of serving others, gentle (okay the truck <br/>
WAS metal, but...), humble...<br/>
<br/>
What usually happens with kids is that they are somewhat <br/>
ego-centered. What they really need is some loving guidance, <br/>
not the assumption that they are never going to be good until we <br/>
teach and require it of them. So when my 2 yos puts a big metal <br/>
truck in a newborn&#39;s bed, I can see immediately the good heart <br/>
behind the action. Then I can show him what she&#39;d really like <br/>
from himback pats, strokes on her furry head, and a kiss on <br/>
the cheek.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is now 15. I&#39;ve never required him to teach his younger <br/>
siblings or to play with them. Yet he chooses to do these things <br/>
every sinlge day. He teaches computer games to his brothers, <br/>
puts the 6yog in his lap and reads to her, talks to his next sister <br/>
in line late into the night after &quot;bedtime&quot; and plays chess with our <br/>
other son. And he&#39;s generous to a fault.<br/>
<br/>
I have not taught or required any of these behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ve lived them in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
(I singled him out because he&#39;s the oldest... but I have examples <br/>
from all four other kids too).<br/>
<br/>
Some of them will come by way of natural <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; consequences, and they&#39;ll adjust their behavior in order to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>avoid the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; same mistake next time. Some of it...it&#39;s gonna come from <br/>
 </span></blockquote>myself and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their father, period. (we being such paragons of moral <br/>
 </span></blockquote>uprightness! <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; LOL)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good point. We don&#39;t even live up to our own ideals. I think it&#39;s a <br/>
crime to expect that children will or can all the time. Better to let <br/>
them come to the point we&#39;re atdesiring to do good because <br/>
good is good to do, not because good is required of you.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And I would also say that, in the midst of our training them to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; obedient, and giving them chores that they DON&#39;T WANT TO <br/>
 </span></blockquote>DO, my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children are happy. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not doubting that your kids are happy in their lives. Most <br/>
loving homes have happy kids. And I don&#39;t think chores that are <br/>
required equate disgruntled children.<br/>
<br/>
What I now realize is that our kids are amazingly able to absorb <br/>
other people&#39;s expectations for them. And over time those <br/>
accumulate. So if we keep piling it on, keep taking advantage of <br/>
their good will and short memories, there will be a price to pay at <br/>
some time. It may not be during chores, but it will show itself. <br/>
Mark it down.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Actually, one of my goals isn&#39;t NECESSARILY that my kids be happy. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bummer. For you and the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I &gt; pray that they will, but more than happy, I&#39;d like to see them be <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; good. By that, I mean, morally upright, with something of a work <br/>
&gt; ethic, kind, gentle, respectful, humble, with hearts full of <br/>
&gt; gratitude, capable of serving others, giving, patient, self-<br/>
&gt; controlled. Now, my firm belief is, if they have these character <br/>
&gt; qualities, they will be happy. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How &#39;bout: if they are HAPPY, they will have all these character qualities? <br/>
When you&#39;re happy, it&#39;s SO much easier to BE kind and gentle and giving and <br/>
self-controlled, etc. I think you&#39;re looking at it bass ackwards.<br/>
<br/>
Since willingness to serve others (for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; instance) is one of the things I want to see in my children, they get <br/>
&gt; to practice serving in our family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Slaves were &quot;started early&quot; too. It&#39;s easier to &quot;accept&quot; slavery if you never <br/>
know any other life. And it can KEEP you in a state of servitude. A child who <br/>
grows up FREE is not as likely to be forced into servitude (I&#39;m thinking more <br/>
of women marrying controlling husbands here or people taking unfulfilling <br/>
jobs).<br/>
<br/>
 In order to keep the household <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; running, they each have chores. Each one of them does what chores I <br/>
&gt; assign...without complaining. Really, they do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what are their choices? What IF they complain?<br/>
<br/>
 Because I have trained &gt; them to do so. <br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re telling you ad nauseum that it&#39;s unnecessary to train children. If <br/>
you LIVE WITH them in a partnership, Kindness and Giving come naturally.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would say that, none of those qualities listed above will come to <br/>
&gt; children naturally. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course they do!<br/>
<br/>
Some of them will come by way of natural <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; consequences, and they&#39;ll adjust their behavior in order to avoid the <br/>
&gt; same mistake next time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is your idea of a &quot;natural&quot; consequence?<br/>
<br/>
 Some of it...it&#39;s gonna come from myself and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their father, period. (we being such paragons of moral uprightness! <br/>
&gt; LOL)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;ll learn how to avoid things and to lie, to blame and to control others. <br/>
THOSE are &quot;natural consequences&quot; of &quot;training&quot; children. Get comfortable with <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I would also say that, in the midst of our training them to be <br/>
&gt; obedient, and giving them chores that they DON&#39;T WANT TO DO, my <br/>
&gt; children are happy. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one will here will say they aren&#39;t. You know your children. What WE&#39;RE <br/>
saying is that they could be SO much happier and kinder and gentler and more <br/>
giving and respectful and so on if you were to show the same to THEM. <br/>
<br/>
Forget chores. Forget training. Forget obedience. <br/>
<br/>
Giving TO children models giving. Making them give to YOU models TAKING.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702127931">Hi Marji<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think our relationships with our children require a lot more <br/>
 </span></blockquote>empathy and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thought.  I really think we have to let go of the notion that we <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; our children to perform in some way that WE chose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1) THE LOVELY ON THE OUTSIDE, UGLY INSIDE SCENARIO: Recently there <br/>
was a situation at my best friend&#39;s church, where a man had gotten <br/>
his girlfriend pregnant and had made no steps toward marrying her. <br/>
This grieved my girlfriend&#39;s heart, partly because she loved the <br/>
woman who was PG and was sad for her, and partly because the man had <br/>
been homeschooled under a strict, structured, scheduled system. He <br/>
knew right from wrong; the man&#39;s parents were flabbergasted, the <br/>
church was hurting from all of this, and he continued in his stubborn <br/>
refusal to do the right thing. (By the Bible, marrying the woman you <br/>
bed IS the right thing.) I think a brother of his committed suicide, <br/>
too. There was probably some weird garbage going on in that family, <br/>
right? (Oh, he did end up marrying her, and has turned out to be a <br/>
fantastic husband and father)<br/>
<br/>
Well, close friends of that family, with 9 kids I think, and <br/>
homeschooling with a similar method, and with a BEAUTIFUL classical <br/>
music ministry...one of their boys tried to strangle himself. I <br/>
wondered then...is it a &quot;step on all signs of different thinking&quot; <br/>
that comes with strict, scheduled, structured childhoods? Other <br/>
families in this little group of Principle Approach-ers have missed <br/>
the mark terribly, with lies and deception amongst the adults, and <br/>
symptoms of stress in the children.<br/>
<br/>
2) THE UGLY ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT LOVELY INSIDE SCENARIO: Fast forward <br/>
to one of my dearest friends, a woman with three boys, who didn&#39;t <br/>
homeschool, but whose childrearing philosophy is fitting in with what <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading here very well. &quot;Let em be and love em.&quot; Her house <br/>
was ALWAYS trashed, her boys are confident and sure of themselves. <br/>
Into gaming and SCA, like Sandra&#39;s boys. I don&#39;t think their group is <br/>
actually SCA, though. They emphasize more the battling than the <br/>
chivalry. Hagerdaaz? Daagerhaz? something like that. They&#39;re grown <br/>
now, and each of those boys works just as much as they need to, to <br/>
fund their hobby. Still living at home, at 22 and 19, and the <br/>
youngest is 17 I think in his senior year. My friend divorced and <br/>
moved out, but the boys still live with their dad.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from having minimal work ethic, these guys are very cool kids. <br/>
They&#39;re funny and enjoy each other&#39;s company, and none of them has <br/>
ever committed a crime, impregnated a girl (the oldest just now <br/>
started dating), gotten into a *real* fight...etc. <br/>
<br/>
So, what you had to say does make sense. Controlling them outwardly <br/>
doesn&#39;t always lead to upstanding citizens or healthy people; leaving <br/>
them to their own devices doesn&#39;t always create monsters.<br/>
<br/>
3) THE WONDERFUL ALL AROUND SCENARIO: Now, to my best friend. She is <br/>
a strict mother, one who pushes her kids to achieve. She, herself, is <br/>
an achiever, doing with excellence everything she sets out to do. Her <br/>
oldest daughter has won oratory awards, taken first place in every <br/>
4-H competition she ever entered, now married and managing a Curves <br/>
workout center and moving up in Mary Kay. She is happy, along with <br/>
being kind, gentle, capable of serving others, funny, self-confident, <br/>
patient, etc. She and her mom are good friends with a loving, open <br/>
relationship. When my friend gets too opinionated about how her <br/>
daughter is doing things, the daughter doesn&#39;t hesitate to tell her <br/>
to chill...ehem, now that the daughter is an adult with her own home <br/>
and husband. It wouldn&#39;t have happened while she was under her mom&#39;s <br/>
roof! My friend brooks no disrespect.<br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s son is 18. He also has excelled, having both the marks of <br/>
success that &quot;the system&quot; has to offer (awards, leadership positions <br/>
in the community, etc) and the marks of an upright human being. When <br/>
I went to spend the afternoon with my friend, he came into the room <br/>
and told me I looked great. This, an 18 year old kid, complimenting <br/>
his mom&#39;s friend. He also compliments his mom, having said to her in <br/>
public &quot;I&#39;d rather spend time with you, anyway&quot; when he couldn&#39;t get <br/>
ahold of a friend to hang with. I heard him say it, and so did half <br/>
the crowd at a church thingy. He has friends who make bad choices, <br/>
and he doesn&#39;t go along with them.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the 11 year old. So far, not a lot of outward <br/>
achievement award type activity, but what awards are available to a <br/>
younger child, she has earned. She also shines as a person, being a <br/>
good conversationalist, fun to be with, intelligent. Not long ago, <br/>
while my friend and I chatted on the phone, the child got going on <br/>
cleaning out the fridge...not because she was asked to. But she also <br/>
does do the things her mom asks or tells her to do.<br/>
<br/>
Could the difference be, not the amount of controlling or the <br/>
expectations we place upon our children, but the relationships we <br/>
develop with them? I don&#39;t know the families in the first (ugly) <br/>
scenario I described, but I do know that the man who got his woman <br/>
pregnant and wouldn&#39;t marry her, has a lot of bitterness towards his <br/>
dad. Did the families in scenario 1 apply controlling methods without <br/>
developing a warm, sincere bond with their kids? My friend with the <br/>
trashed house and the cool kids...not a whole lot of &quot;discipline&quot; or <br/>
pushing going on there, but she loves them, and they love her. She <br/>
poured herself into them, since her husband didn&#39;t love her. And <br/>
their overall &quot;coolness&quot; shows it. Same with my best friend&#39;s family. <br/>
She is 100% into them, just like she is 100% into anything she does. <br/>
And they know it, and can grow well in the strong love she has for <br/>
them, even though she demands things of them and pushes them.<br/>
<br/>
My folks didn&#39;t push me, didn&#39;t place hardly any expectations on me, <br/>
let me choose for the most part...and I went completely nuts at age <br/>
15, got into drugs and sex, dropped out of high school, and was angry <br/>
and bitter at them for years. Why? I think it&#39;s because they never <br/>
bothered to develop an open, trusting, loving relationship with me. I <br/>
think basically, underneath it, their love for me won out, because as <br/>
an adult, I&#39;m confident and capable, and my mom and I get along fine <br/>
now. We enjoy each other. Same with my dad. And my sister and brother <br/>
and I are all friends. But it was shaky for a decade in there!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I hope this makes sense.<br/>
<br/>

thinking aloud. thanks for your insightful reply<br/>

the books off the floor!&quot; once she&#39;s started with the books, I head <br/>
for the boy&#39;s room &quot;dirty laundry pile, here!&quot; and throw a few things <br/>
in the pile, to get HIM started. Then back to Katie&#39;s room &quot;Okay, now <br/>
it&#39;s time to strip the bed!&quot; or whatever. I help them both, but also <br/>
expect them to follow through independently. Abbie, 15, knows how to <br/>
do it, when I ask her to clean her room...because I did it with her <br/>
when she was little. And she cleans to her own standards (which is <br/>
pretty cluttered). <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The checking account BORES ME TO TEARS!!!!!!!!! I HATE it! I never <br/>
&gt; want to do it, and never once have I balanced it. Not once. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Figure out what you hate about it and eliminate that.  Computerize it as much <br/>
as possible so it&#39;s always as right as it can be.  <br/>
<br/>
I only write checks for bills that come in the mail.  I use my debit card <br/>
everywhere else.  I download my transactions every day, so I know if <br/>
something might bounce before the bank knows.  Every day when I get the mail, <br/>
I throw out all the junk and then sit right down at the computer and write <br/>
the checks and put them in the envelope.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if I don&#39;t have the money at that point, because my banking <br/>
program (Quicken) will line it up just right anyway.  Then I enter the checks <br/>
in the computer, stuff the envelope and write the date the bill is due on the <br/>
envelope where the stamp would go.  Then I put all the bills in a SACRED <br/>
place on my desk.  &lt;g&gt; (My desk is always piled up with mine and everyone <br/>
else&#39;s SHTUFF, except for this one little envelope sized area that is SACRED <br/>
I tell ya!)  <br/>
<br/>
So every day when I download the last night&#39;s transactions, I pick up the <br/>
envelopes and see if any need to be mailed that day.  I put stamps on those.  <br/>
A stamp in my mind is like a red flag!  If it has a stamp, it MUST go in the <br/>
mailbox that day, or disaster might occur.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to be just like you.  I would avoid the task until it became <br/>
overwhelming.  But doing a little every day makes it manageable, and it also <br/>
gives me the security of knowing exactly what our money situation is at every <br/>
moment.  That makes me feel really HAPPY and secure.  I can get really <br/>
depressed over the bills if I feel out of control.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you start over completely.  Look for a couple of days when it will <br/>
be likely that you can go without using the bank account at all (this helps <br/>
you not have to deal with straggling transactions that might bite you).  Then <br/>
set up Quicken (or Money or whathaveyou) with an opening balance of what the <br/>
bank shows.  Then, spend 2 months doing what I described (adapting it to your <br/>
situation, of course).  At the end of two statement cycles, if you&#39;ve <br/>
balanced every day online through your bank, it will be apparent what the $$ <br/>
difference is between your old checkbook and the bank.  Not that it will <br/>
matter, because you will be all balanced up!  But I&#39;m the curious sort and <br/>
would want to know what the difference is.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s harder to get started when every dime is critical, because the cash flow <br/>
really needs to be halted for a while so you can be absolutely sure.  It <br/>
costs a little money to have online access.  I pay about $15 a month ($5.95 <br/>
plus .50 for every dl over 10 in a month) to download every day, and they <br/>
wave the normal service charge because we have direct deposit of dh&#39;s <br/>
paychecks.  But I could just go view them online and it would be much <br/>
cheaper.  So, I understand if this seems impossible for some.  But my peace <br/>
of mind is so worth it.<br/>

commercial though.  <br/>
<br/>
It is awesome!<br/>

<br/>
My dh uses the computer to pay bills now anyway and I rarely <br/>
write a check. We just look at our account online to see what <br/>
money we have available.<br/>

also hate doing the bills.  Because of this, my checking account is never <br/>
balanced too, and I put off doing the bills until I am in a pinch.  I don&#39;t <br/>
have anyone to tell me when to do them because my husband is a lot like me.  <br/>
I do my best, and I usually feel so much better when I&#39;ve sent out the bills <br/>
and have at least come close in balancing my checkbook.  There&#39;s no one that <br/>
forces me to do it.  I just know if I never do it, our electric and water <br/>
will be turned off.<br/>

for bed and are in bed between 8:00 and 9:00.  I have let my daughter and son <br/>
stay up later because they wanted to several times, but the next day is <br/>
usually a disaster.  They are 3 and 4 years old and don&#39;t seem to understand <br/>
or care that when they stay up late at night it makes them feel terrible the <br/>
next day.  I have decided to wait until they are little older for them to <br/>
decide when to go to bed.<br/>
