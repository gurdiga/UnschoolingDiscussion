I know other have given mushy feedback, but I honestly can&#39;t imagine why a <br/>
child would POUR a soda into a cup holder. Spill accidentally and say &quot;OOOPS!  <br/>
HELP!&quot; yes, but pour?  That&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
And I would have just told my neighbor not to GO on blind dates with someone <br/>
who wouldn&#39;t come where she was.  Honestly.  Help your children learn to be <br/>
responsible and considerate by being responsible and considerate to your <br/>
children.  Maybe you could tell your neighbor that you need to consider homeschooling <br/>
a fulltime job and she&#39;ll have to find other support.<br/>
<br/>
When things seem overwhelming, breathe several deep breaths, slow breaths, <br/>
get yourself still inside, and then put the next few bits of energy directly <br/>
toward one or more of your children, connecting with them by touch and smelling <br/>
them, saying something loving to them, before you get up and zoom back to the <br/>
busy-ness of the day.<br/>

life no matter who they are.  My advice?  Hang your clothes to dry and don&#39;t <br/>
drive her anywhere, make a clean break and move on.  You know she&#39;s moving, don&#39;t <br/>
wait until then.  You wouldn&#39;t drink bleach, so don&#39;t spend time with her.  <br/>
Focus on your concerns, not hers.  No one can make you a doormat without your <br/>
permission, or so said Dear ABby.<br/>

and has very litttle impulse control at 5, and Marsie (not now at 7 but<br/>
certainly at 3) who is extremely tactile.<br/>

<br/>
You said &quot;I know other have given mushy feedback, but I honestly can&#39;t imagine why a child would POUR a soda into a cup holder. Spill accidentally and say &quot;OOOPS!  <br/>
HELP!&quot; yes, but pour?  That&#39;s a problem.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To me, he was just interested in seeing what would happen if he poured it in there. Would it fill it up? Would it hold it? Can I drink it if it&#39;s there and not in the can anymore? <br/>
<br/>
Logan is very much an experimenter...he loves to figure out why and what something does/is for/can do/is about, etc. He questions EVERYTHING. <br/>
<br/>
Paul&#39;s mother tells me Paul was the same way, always into something, making &quot;inappropriate&quot; messes trying to figure things out. He is mechanically inclined in ways I am totally hopeless. <br/>
<br/>
It would never occur to me personally to pour out a drink into something like that, but I can see where it would to Logan. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, it could have been a better place and a better moment than in my van as I was driving along. But that&#39;s where it happened. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m looking at it wrong, I don&#39;t know. He is  3 years old. He&#39;ll be 4 in April, if that helps with perspective.<br/>
