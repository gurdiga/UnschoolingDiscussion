<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210708972">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i just want to say i&#39;m sorry my emailer seems to have a mind of its <br/>
own  from time to time.  it&#39;s a beta version of green (a french <br/>
program for the mac - i&#39;m trying to move away from the big commerial <br/>
programs) and it is a bit quirky as is the nature of beta programs:)  <br/>
for example friday it sent my message-  RE: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] <br/>
spanking - while i was still typing it, so i didn&#39;t get a chance to <br/>
sign my name or spell ck.  and sometimes it double or even triple <br/>
sends my messages.  i hope they have the finished version available <br/>
soon&lt;g&gt; sorry for the inconvince.<br/>
