<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029891994">**Sometimes it&#39;s like being on another plane of existence.**<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh, yes,  but today I got to be with another unschooling family, and it<br/>
was WONDERFUL!   Sorry,  but I had to yell it.<br/>
<br/>
It was my first visit with another unschooling family,   it was great,  and<br/>
it was worth the 1 1/2-2  hour drive.   We were on our &quot;planes&quot; together.<br/>
What a nice afternoon!<br/>

<br/>
When: June 28, 2003<br/>
Where: Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, New Jersey<br/>
What: The Unschoolers Network, 26th Anniversary Conference<br/>
<br/>
Since 1977, the Unschoolers Network has provided homeschoolers with the<br/>
opportunity to hear some of the most important and influential people in the<br/>
homeschooling community. This year, the Unschoolers Network is pleased to<br/>
present Linda Dobson as the keynote speaker. Linda is the author of many<br/>
books on homeschooling, including &quot;The Art of Education&quot;, &quot;The Homeschooling<br/>
Book of Answers&quot;, and &quot;The Ultimate Book of Homeschooling Ideas.&quot; Her<br/>
keynote speech is entitled &quot;The Wonder Years . . . Loving & Learning From<br/>
the Homeschooling Journey&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a great keynote speaker, the conference will also offer a<br/>
wide variety of wonderful workshops covering topics for new homeschoolers<br/>
and veterans as well as those with younger or older children. There will be<br/>
something for everyone!<br/>
A variety of vendors will also be present, including FUN Books<br/>
(www.FUN-Books.com). If you will be at the conference, you can place your<br/>
FUN Books order in advance for pick-up at the conference as a way to avoid<br/>
shipping costs and to make sure what you want is available. You can also let<br/>
us know if there are any items you would like us to bring for you to look<br/>
at.<br/>
