&lt;&lt; I think that I will plan on mentioning to my friends (the moms of the two <br/>
boys who<br/>
 are invited) to not feel like they need to invite Jason to their party the <br/>
next year.<br/>
 Really the only reason that Jason is invited is because we parents are <br/>
friends. That<br/>
 at least will simplify that aspect. We&#39;ll have to see how things go with <br/>
Samantha this <br/>
 year and if they stay friends I guess. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re agonizing entirely too much over this!!<br/>
Let him choose who to invite, it&#39;s his day, not yours. That is fairly simple.<br/>
Now to avoid any hurt feelings, all you have to do is explain that you&#39;re <br/>
having a very small get together and not inviting a bunch of friends this <br/>
year. <br/>
Then maybe have some cupcakes and have Samantha and the other girl over for a <br/>
little post-Birthday celebration.<br/>
And don&#39;t let your guilt keep your son from their Birthdays. They should <br/>
invite whom they wish also.<br/>

It very much sounds like a school thing biting you in the butt!  It still <br/>
happens to me and I just scratch my head and wonder if I&#39;ll EVER get it all <br/>
out of my brain.<br/>
Anyway, no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s rude to not invite someone you&#39;ve always <br/>
invited.<br/>
I&#39;d just tell her he&#39;s at the age that he&#39;d like to have a formal party with <br/>
just boys and ask if they&#39;d like to do a mini celebration all their own.<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Stephanie --<br/>
<br/>
I can see that it&#39;s a little awkward.  However, it happens and I can<br/>
accept it.<br/>
<br/>
I got to go through this the easier way.  In my tiny social circle the<br/>
girls started excluding the boys before the boys started excluding the<br/>
girls.  (I have a boy and we still have mixed parties at our house<br/>
because I wouldn&#39;t disinvite siblings.)  In my case the first friend who<br/>
dropped my son out of her party had a very sensitive daughter and lived<br/>
in a very small house.  Her previous years party had been noisy enough<br/>
to make her cry.  It was easy to understand why she wanted to have a<br/>
smaller party and to leave the boys off of the list.  It&#39;s possible that<br/>
even her brother was banished to an alternate activity that day.<br/>
<br/>
So, once the pattern of &quot;everyone inviting everybody&quot; was broken it no<br/>
longer seemed very rude to leave people out.  But it would be rude to<br/>
talk about the party in front of them.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s more of an issue for a kid that doesn&#39;t get to go to very<br/>
many parties.  With my attachment parenting friends all the adults tend<br/>
to stay at the parties, too, and as far as I am concerned we go to<br/>
plenty of parties now and I wouldn&#39;t mind cutting back a bit every year.<br/>
 (Yes, I AM the birthday Grinch.)  I think park days, judging by the<br/>
smiles, are as much fun as bday parties and my son gets to do that every week.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134064197">When we have the &quot;do I have to invite so-and-so&quot;, the first answer is <br/>
no, you don&#39;t and then the following discussion is how to handle it. <br/>
These are two separate issues. First, is the right to ask who you want <br/>
to spend time with. To me, anyway, this is a spiritual issue - we should <br/>
spend time with the people we enjoy being with. Both of my girls have <br/>
had instances of having difficulty breaking away from toxic, possessive <br/>
friends. Secondly, older dd does not like large gatherings. We have <br/>
allowed her to have a couple of small parties instead, she likes to only <br/>
have two or three friends over at a time. As for &quot;explaining&quot;, if it <br/>
comes up, there are many polite ways to explain - and btw, most of us <br/>
explain far more than we need. Most of the time, the issue never comes <br/>
up anyway.<br/>
<br/>
As for parties, we have lots of small ones all year round. The kids do <br/>
everything, so I don&#39;t worry about it much. I think when they have to do <br/>
all the planning and preparation, it&#39;s a good experience for them. I <br/>
don&#39;t feel that it is my job to entertain them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The answer to just about every question in the world is &quot;It depends.&quot;  So if <br/>
you make a rule like &quot;everyone who has ever invited you to a party must be <br/>
invited to every party you have,&quot; that&#39;s too much rule for this earth!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids have big parties.  Sometimes their parents can&#39;t even afford a <br/>
little party, and so let them have a sleepover with two guests or something.  <br/>
 And there&#39;s always next year&#39;s birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could have a New Year&#39;s Day party with some kids, just an afternoon <br/>
snacks and play-day stuff.  Then you could satisfy your urge to create a <br/>
guest list and that one could be YOUR kid-party!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is so true!  Mine are still really young - 3 and 4, but lately they have <br/>
been driving me a bit crazy at night.  OK, I broke my ankle and am sleeping <br/>
in the living room.  My husband has been out of town for three weeks, so the <br/>
kids are sleeping on the couches in here with me.  They get all riled up at 9 <br/>
p.m. and don&#39;t want to sleep.  Even if they are really tired.  Even when they <br/>
say they are tired.  Even after I turn out the lights they are still <br/>
yammering away at me.  And I want to read my book (Palace Walk by Naghib <br/>
Mafouz - highly recommend it) or watch the news.<br/>
<br/>
Well, OF COURSE, they get all excited.  They are camping in the living room <br/>
with Mommy!  Their whole life is topsy turvy, they have a nanny and a mommy, <br/>
they haven&#39;t gone out as much as normal, they have a friend and her 2 year <br/>
old staying with us.  9 p.m. is their favorite time of day.  Just the three <br/>
of us.  And why wouldn&#39;t it be?  It took me a couple of weeks to figure out <br/>
that the problem was with my reaction to their joy at being just with me.  <br/>
Guess I&#39;m pretty slow.  Plus, I tend to wallow in my misery over my ankle too <br/>
much...<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to agree with you here.  Hope it doesn&#39;t take me a couple of <br/>
weeks to figure it out the next time...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s so cool that you figured it out at all!!<br/>
<br/>
I just blew up big-time at Liam today.  Very briefly, but very big.  I <br/>
caught myself immediately afterward and apologized to him and told him this <br/>
was not a good time to talk, that we should talk later when both of us feel <br/>
calmer.   In my musing afterwards, my thoughts went quickly to the Peaceful <br/>
Parenting tape from the HSC conference earlier this year that Sandra did <br/>
with Richard P...... (sorry, Richard, wherever you are; I don&#39;t have the <br/>
tape in front of me to get your name right).  I remembered the part that <br/>
Richard said about when you&#39;re kind of out of your practice you may say <br/>
something and wish you hadn&#39;t and realize it a while later and go and <br/>
apologize.  When you&#39;re a little more in your practice, you may say <br/>
something and then realize it right away and then apologize right <br/>
away.  And, when you&#39;re really in your practice, you catch the thing before <br/>
it leaks out of your mouth.  Then, I think about how long I allowed Liam to <br/>
languish in that school (a full year and a half of being really unhappy) <br/>
before I realized that he had to be taken out that very minute.  Being <br/>
conscious and mindful is so tricky for me!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my long way of saying, &quot;I know what you mean, Elizabeth.&quot;  But.  I <br/>
really think that having the awareness that we&#39;re not getting it so fast is <br/>
one of the steps towards getting it faster.  We just have to hang in there.<br/>

being mad was not going to change things at all and actually made them worse.<br/>

the primary cause....<br/>
