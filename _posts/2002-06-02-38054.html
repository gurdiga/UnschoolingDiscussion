 </span></blockquote>I really do!  There is a great group of eclectic homeschoolers that <br/>
meets weekly.  Many of them are unschoolers.  I know of one that is <br/>
an atheist and another that is a bhuddist.  Most of them are <br/>
vegetarian.  It is a great group that I miss desperately.  If you <br/>
are insterested, I will call my friend in Michigan and ask how you <br/>
can contact the group.<br/>
