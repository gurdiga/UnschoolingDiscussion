<div id="ygrps-yiv-663984722">We&#39;ve started a Friday night classic movies tradition. So far we&#39;ve  <br/>
done The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  <br/>
(where Spain stands in for New Mexico :-) so we&#39;re not too far into  <br/>
it yet ;-).<br/>
<br/>
Since Kat doesn&#39;t have a head full of classic movies to choose from  <br/>
that we haven&#39;t all watched already, she said she wanted to pick a  <br/>
light hearted heist or caper movie like The Sting or The Italian Job.  <br/>
Anyone have favorites to share?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385516734">By caper will sleuth do?<br/>
<br/>
I like the Thin Man series - they really are light hearted - William Powell<br/>
and Myrna Loy.<br/>
<br/>
The Edward G. Robinson movie &quot;Larceny Inc&quot; (1942) is light hearted.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034965/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034965/</a><br/>
<br/>
For a more offbeat story about criminals that is a sweet holiday film the<br/>
Humphrey Bogart film &quot;We&#39;re No Angels&quot; (1955) is also cute. Beware of the<br/>
recent film of the same title (de Niro, Sean Penn) which is not a remake<br/>
(and I hear was a turkey).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513051841">CONFIDENCE!!!  It&#39;s a great, GREAT movie!!  And I love Edward  Burns.  Great <br/>
twists and turns, surprises, and wonderful acting (Andy  Garcia, Dustin <br/>
Hoffman, Rachel Weisz, Edward Burns, Paul Giamatti)  It does  have some <br/>
nudity/sexuality, not sure if that&#39;s a problem.  <br/>

those guys are in it :-)  It&#39;s a fun book.  A couple of my favorites <br/>
aren&#39;t in it, because they&#39;ve become too well known: William H. Macy <br/>

Christmas, when he performed with Aimee Mann; stood right next to the <br/>

<br/>
His performance in Sideways was soooo good. There is one scene, where <br/>
he runs into his ex-wife (whom he thinks he has a chance of getting <br/>
back together with)and she says she&#39;s pg by her new guy<br/>
(husband?)...and his expression changes ever so slightly. He <br/>
congratulates her, but for just a second you can tell he is totally <br/>
crushed. Really good actor. <br/>

more Western than heist, but I remember seeing it at the Dundee movie <br/>

and loving Richard Farnsworth. But I haven&#39;t seen it since, and I don&#39;t know <br/>

<br/>
I really love the movie Snatch, directed by Guy Ritchie. Some of it&#39;s pretty<br/>
intense (bare knuckle boxing, dog fighting), but it&#39;s equally, intensely<br/>
hilarious (lots of folks looking for the same diamond and bizarre<br/>
coincidences) - not for the sensitive folk. Subtitles are a must!  Brad Pitt<br/>
is especially wonderful in this one.<br/>
