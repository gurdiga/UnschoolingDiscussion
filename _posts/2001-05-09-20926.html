<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602951132"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m curious to find out how many of those who are so<br/>
&gt;opposed to spanking also call themselves<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;pro-&gt;choice&quot;.....  Can you be both?  Chris<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think the two topics are related at<br/>
all, although I see how you are linking them.  After<br/>
years of thought over this issue (which for personal<br/>
reasons is very important to me) I have come to the<br/>
conclusion that I can be neither &quot;pro-choice&quot;, nor<br/>
&quot;pro-life&quot;.  I don&#39;t believe that this issue, being<br/>
very personal by nature, can be decided based on a<br/>
political stance.  I believe it is a purely indiviual<br/>
and deeply life changing decision, no matter what a<br/>
person decides to do in a difficult situation.  I will<br/>
stand behind any decision a loved one makes<br/>
thoughtfully, and be supportive to the furthest extent<br/>
of my abilities.  I would encourage others NOT to<br/>
abort, and do my best to help them make other options<br/>
feasible, but I also am in favor of the law allowing<br/>
the option.  I just continue to hope that few people<br/>
choose that road.<br/>
