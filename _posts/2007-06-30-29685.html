<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068229889">I&#39;ve brought this from e-mail.  Please share ideas!<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
  I didn&#39;t know if you wanted this on the group, you<br/>
are welcome to put it there, if you desire. Remember not too long ago<br/>
i wrote that my son was always asking me to play with him?<br/>
<br/>
You suggested getting him a friend. I did. The boy is a few years<br/>
older than my son who is 5yo. When i have my son&#39;s friend over it is<br/>
hectic! My son wants him over but doesn&#39;t treat him nice all the time.<br/>
He will push him, throw something at him, try to make him fall. I am<br/>
constantly saying Stop it! Taking my son aside and telling him that&#39;s<br/>
not a good way to keep friends or You hurt him! I get madder and feel<br/>
like yelling, i am constantly playing referee.<br/>
<br/>
I ask my son why he treats his friend that way, i say we don&#39;t treat<br/>
him like that and if he wants to keep his friend he can&#39;t do that. The<br/>
friend has been very patient with my son&#39;s behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot what age kids don&#39;t mine sharing...i think 6yo? So, The boy<br/>
has been bringing some of his own toys because my son will not share.<br/>
My son even takes the boys toy and won&#39;t give it back! Argh!<br/>
<br/>
What to do? Any and all advice would be welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Everything that the boy is playing with, my son wants to take away<br/>
from him. Now, there are nice times when they are looking at a book<br/>
together or watching a video but the peace doesn&#39;t last long,lol<br/>

<br/>
Is he really your son&#39;s friend, or a kid you set him up with?<br/>
Would they like each other if they  met in a park?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe meeting in a park would be really helpful, where there are  <br/>
things to do and play with and on but nobody&#39;s personal toys.  Maybe  <br/>
they  need neutral territory.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re &quot;constantly&quot; saying something, it&#39;s not working.  Don&#39;t  <br/>
repeat yourself.  Say something each time that you&#39;ve never said before.<br/>
<br/>
Parents sometimes get into scripted little plays, almost, saying  <br/>
things they&#39;ve said before.  If he ignored you the last two or three  <br/>
times, it will be even easier to ignore the next time.<br/>
<br/>
COMMUNICATE, don&#39;t just speak.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I ask my son why he treats his friend that way,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think he knows?<br/>
You don&#39;t know, and you&#39;re way older than five.<br/>
<br/>
-=- i say we don&#39;t treat<br/>
him like that and if he wants to keep his friend he can&#39;t do that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&quot; ?<br/>
Do you really say &quot;We don&#39;t treat him like that&quot;?<br/>
Would you say that to your husband or an adult friend?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re baby-talking him, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Everything that the boy is playing with, my son wants to take away<br/>
from him.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you asked the older boy for ideas?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s likely that for a while you need to be very close or even right  <br/>
in the play.  I know you&#39;re looking for a way not to have to play  <br/>
with your son, but maybe you don&#39;t have that option for a while.<br/>
<br/>
When a mom&#39;s frustrated with the time and direct contact it&#39;s taking  <br/>
to have a child, sometimes I&#39;ve reminded her that if he can walk and  <br/>
feed himself and wipe his own butt, she&#39;s got it easy compared to  <br/>
moms whose kids are not hale and whole, who REALLY need constant  <br/>
attention and will for years, for life maybe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>time.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not used to playing with other kids regularly, he&#39;s still <br/>
learning a whole bunch of social skills and probably needs some help <br/>
with that. <br/>
<br/>
By &quot;not all the time&quot; do you mean sometimes he&#39;s nice and sometimes <br/>
not? Any patterns there? Morgan will take a while to get comfortable <br/>
with a friend, especially if the friend is very social/ in a very <br/>
chatty mood. So I often have to run interferrence for the first <br/>
fifteen minutes or so. If I don&#39;t she&#39;s cranky and unsettled and <br/>
doesn&#39;t get along with her friend until we or they leave, so that <br/>
first fifteen minutes is pretty important to *her* - no matter how <br/>
much I may be jonesing for some &quot;mommy time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH one of Mo&#39;s friends is really easygoing unless she&#39;s hungry or <br/>
tired, so *her* mom has to check in with her more later on during a <br/>
playdate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He will push him, throw something at him, try to make him fall. I <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; constantly saying Stop it! Taking my son aside and telling him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not a good way to keep friends or You hurt him!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find it more helpful to think in terms of helping kids communicate <br/>
with each other, rather than policing their interactions. As Sandra <br/>
pointed out, you may have to be right there with them for awhile to <br/>
help them figure out how to communicate with each other *before* <br/>
things get to the pushing/hitting/throwing stage. It may also be <br/>
helpful to talk with your ds before the playdate and decide then <br/>
which toys he&#39;s comfortable sharing *this time* - with many <br/>
reassurances, if necessary, that the other child isn&#39;t going to be <br/>
taking those toys home. That&#39;s something Mo worries about, when <br/>
friends come over - especially with her favorite cat. <br/>
<br/>
I do encourage Mo and her playmates to say &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t like <br/>
that&quot; as clearly as possible. When the kids can remember to do that, <br/>
it gives me a little more freedom to be farther away, in another <br/>
room, or whatever. That can take some time and practice, though - <br/>
and occasional backup on my part &quot;I heard a stop!&quot; or &quot;stop means <br/>
stop&quot;. Sound kind of silly, when I write it down, but when Mo or one <br/>
of her pals really gets wound up, they don&#39;t always notice the other <br/>
child&#39;s reaction. So that&#39;s something to look at wrt your ds - is he <br/>
so wrapped up in his own feelings that he&#39;s just not aware of how <br/>
he&#39;s effecting the other child? <br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is that he&#39;s noticing, but lacks impulse <br/>
control. Then its even more important for you to be present and help <br/>
mediate things *before* he gets to that point. Not the respite you <br/>
may have been looking for!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>treat<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; him like that and if he wants to keep his friend he can&#39;t do that. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think its better to assume your ds is doing the best he can with <br/>
the skills and resources he has *right now*. Skills take some time <br/>
and modelling and practice. Resources include enough food, rest, <br/>
sense of security, and Mom (there are others, like maturity, but <br/>
those are the resources you can affect). Can the other mom help out? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143855252">-He would play with him at the park, that&#39;s how they met. Steven looks<br/>
forward to coming over to play with Lukas and vice versa. They have<br/>
played at the park many times and i agree it is better there. Steven<br/>
and Lukas both enjoy the pool we have. I am right there with them when<br/>
the screaming and arguing breaks out. I say alot of STOP IT&#39;s.i only<br/>
said &quot;we&quot; don&#39;t treat him like that once. I see what you mean about it<br/>
being baby talk tho.I love playing with my son but i was also looking<br/>
for a little &quot;break&quot; and for him to play with kids. We play most of<br/>
the time and i enjoy him. Ijust have this...he should play with<br/>
kids...idea in me. Of course my husband says he acts that way because<br/>
he&#39;s not around alot of kids or in school.Is it okay if he has no<br/>
friends at this time?<br/>
You say to communicate not talk to him...how? What can isay, ineed<br/>
some tools. I asked the boys&#39; mom to bring some of his own toys, he<br/>
did but Lukas takes those too and the boy cries and Lukas will not<br/>
give it back. I don&#39;t know if he needs more socialization or less.<br/>
what do you all think?-- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra<br/>
