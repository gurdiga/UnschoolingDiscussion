4.8. Re: Freedom of Choice - Multiple children<br/>
<br/>
One of the meanest things my mom ever used to say to me was &quot;that&#39;s<br/>
life.&quot;  It was never said sympathetically, and often the frustration<br/>
was clearly of her own creation, and not &quot;life.&quot;  It was MY life,<br/>
because I was stuck with her, but every time she said it I was more<br/>
determined to be far from her when I could be.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One of the meanest things I heard was &quot;Well, Life&#39;s not fair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even before unschooling, I figured *my* job was to make my HOME as <br/>
*fair* a place to be as I could.<br/>
<br/>
I realize life may not be fair, but that didn&#39;t mean I should make our <br/>
lives that way too. If I made our home a fair and comfy spot to land <br/>
after an *unfair* day at school (or whereeever), Cameron might know <br/>
that we were always there for him---even when the world is unfair.<br/>
<br/>
I want my kids to know that I am always here to right what I can and to <br/>
make things as fair as I can for them. Home should be a *safe* place!<br/>
