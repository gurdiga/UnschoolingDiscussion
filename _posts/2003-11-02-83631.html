<div id="ygrps-yiv-442243932">As I sit here watching the snow fall (yes, snow, melting as it hits the<br/>
ground, but snow) Im thinking about our day yesterday.  I was watching<br/>
natural learning happen with Jonathan and it was so fun.<br/>
<br/>
He was adding numbers together and telling me the answers, for him its a<br/>
game, as fun as any other NON-academic game.  Later he was playing Pokemon<br/>
on the gameboy, when he would catch a new Pokemon he would have to name it.<br/>
He would ask for the letters for the name he had chosen, after the first two<br/>
he was picking out some of the letters himself by sounding them out.<br/>
<br/>
When he uses the computer he has several favorite web sites like cartoon<br/>
network, Disney and nickelodeon.  He types the urls in himself with help<br/>
from me or Lanora, already hes learning how some of the words are spelled.<br/>
<br/>
None of this surprises me anymore but it always thrills me to see the kids<br/>
experience learning as pure fun.<br/>

We got snow on Thursday, then the roads melted ... Friday night it snowed <br/>
some more (FUN drive home from the halloween party ~ yuck!), no snow yesterday, <br/>
but my lawn is still covered ~ streets and walks are clear.  I&#39;m supposed to be <br/>
in the banana belt of South Dakota (Rapid City) ~ though it doesn&#39;t much feel <br/>
that way right now!  <br/>
