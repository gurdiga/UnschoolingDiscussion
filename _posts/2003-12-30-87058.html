 </span></blockquote>It seems to change every time I have to refill, BUT, it mostly consists<br/>
of vinegar, a few drops of shampoo(natural and a nice scent is<br/>
preferred) MAYBE some borax or baking soda and a few drops of whatever<br/>
essential oil I am into that day! <br/>
<br/>
The one I have going now is SUPER Simple (I am about 38 week pregnant<br/>
and not feeling anything too much!!LOL) Vinegar and cinnamon leaf e.o.<br/>
Smells AWESOME (hubby thinks too strong) but for me its holiday-ish and<br/>
clean. No toxic garbage for my kids to pick up on their feet or in<br/>
something they drop and then put in their mouths. <br/>
