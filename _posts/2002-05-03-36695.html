&lt;&lt; One more thing, we never call them chores.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have never &quot;done a chore,&quot; but they have helped lots of ways around <br/>
the house.<br/>
<br/>
Today I had done a lot of housecleaning because he had a little birthday <br/>
party here tonight (adults mostly) and I was dusty and tired, so an hour <br/>
before &quot;time,&quot; I went to the back to find clean clothes and shower.  Holly <br/>
(10) came back to do something, and as she left she said, &quot;Have a fun shower, <br/>
mom!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Showers have never been considered &quot;a chore,&quot; either, here.  Showers and <br/>
baths are fun.  Kids haven&#39;t been &quot;made&quot; to wash--they do it to play with <br/>
toys, or to relax when they&#39;re really tired, or in Marty&#39;s case to shave his <br/>
head, or in Kirby&#39;s to wake up before he has to go to work.<br/>
<br/>
Showers are taken for real reasons, not because it&#39;s time, or because they&#39;ve <br/>
avoided it until mom made them take one.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when they boys were twelvish I might say &quot;Marty, when&#39;s the last <br/>
time you had a shower?&quot;  (meaning I smelled him.)  He&#39;d tell me when, and I <br/>
might say &quot;Well since you&#39;re going to Logan&#39;s, could you take one before you <br/>
leave?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I could say &quot;You&#39;re not going to Logan&#39;s if you don&#39;t take a shower.&quot;<br/>
I could say &quot;You stink, Marty!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But as they got a bit older they became more self-conscious (in a good way) <br/>
about clean clothes and clean bodies, and smelling in the <br/>
neutral-to-attractive range.<br/>
<br/>
There are days when there have been other teen boys around all weekend and <br/>
they&#39;ve been in Kirby&#39;s room playing video games, sleeping here and there, no <br/>
girls around and none expected, and they do begin to smell locker-roomish.<br/>
<br/>
But the sentiment &quot;Have a fun shower!&quot; is common, and I&#39;ve said to Holly and <br/>
others (including my husband and adult company) LOTS of times things about <br/>
showers.  &quot;Feels good, huh?&quot; about showers on hot, dry, summer days.  &quot;I feel <br/>
SO much better!&quot; when I come out with wet hair.  Or competitions, when kids <br/>
were younger, humorous claims of &quot;I&#39;m the cleanest person in this house!&quot; and <br/>
the next person to bathe got to brag after that.  <br/>
<br/>
I see around me, though, enforced, scheduled baths and showers which involve <br/>
some pressure, some shaming, some impatience, and I can&#39;t imagine those kids <br/>
saying to their moms, or hearing from their moms, &quot;Have a fun shower!&quot;<br/>
