&lt;&lt; So, tomorrow we are going to make catapults to throw water balloons at <br/>
each <br/>
 other...Nic&#39;s idea &lt;bg&gt;.  I suspect there will be an &#39;un-lesson&#39; in that as <br/>
 well! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Fun! Thanks for sharing a wonderful series of moments...that was really cool.<br/>
You could tell them the point at which the thing balancing the object meets <br/>
the object is  called a fulcrum. :)<br/>
They might not care though, balancing is more fun than terminology!<br/>

Jalen watched about penguins on Mr. Rogers yesterday, he seemed especially <br/>
interested.  Lat night as we were getting headed to bed, he was squatting <br/>
down by a pile of papers I had on the floor.  I didn&#39;t pay much attention, <br/>
but he was just sitting quietly and staring at one particular paper.<br/>
After a minute, he came with me to go lay down.<br/>
This morning, I noticed it was a picture with many penguins on it. He was <br/>
making two year old connections. :)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cool how the tv enhances so many things we do!<br/>

spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020351250">Don&#39;t you just LOVE those moments??  A few months ago, Caeleb (22 months) <br/>
was watching one of those Baby Einstien movies and saw a baby.  I said, <br/>
&#39;aww, look at the baby Caeleb!&#39;  He sat there for a moment and turned to <br/>
point to Chloe, his baby sister.  His little eyes lit up like he had it all <br/>
figured out!  For days, when he saw a baby, he would point to Chloe and the <br/>
tv, making the connection.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing how much we miss sometimes.  I find that I have become so much <br/>
more aware of these little moments now that we are unschooling.  I seriously <br/>
doubt a few years ago, I would have thought of the fork balancing act as <br/>
anything educational.  Which is sad because I&#39;m quite sure I missed many <br/>
natural lessons life was teaching us.  Live and Learn!<br/>
