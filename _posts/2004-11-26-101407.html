don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s *just for  kids* at all!  It is the best resource for HTML <br/>
that I have found for  myself and my 16 yo daughter agrees.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606227882">There are other &quot;how to&quot; sites too, so sometimes if one site&#39;s explanation is <br/>
confusing, try another.  But I&#39;ve used Lissa&#39;s too sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to do is to lift the code of a page you like, and learn to find <br/>
elements.  I&#39;ve swiped formats (indents, columns, etc.).  The box I use on <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/life">http://sandradodd.com/life</a> and some of those directly connected to it came from a <br/>
site for recovering Mormons.  I changed the colors and added backgrounds, and it <br/>
works better on some of the pages than others.  Sometimes I go in and make <br/>
repairs and sometimes I just let things remain funky until I&#39;m in to add new <br/>
info.<br/>
<br/>
To see the code of a page, you can go to the page and hold the mouse down.  I <br/>
have a Mac, so I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s right or left for a PC, but a box <br/>
comes up and one of the options is &quot;view source.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That will show the HTML of that page.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s way long and confusing, but if you look at some simple pages, <br/>
and after doing a bit, you learn to see which parts you can ignore and which <br/>
are the thing you&#39;re after. <br/>
<br/>
You can copy and paste that code into a word file and delete what you don&#39;t <br/>
need, and when you want to use it, cut and paste it from your file and fill in <br/>
the text, change the colors, whatever.<br/>

Once you&#39;ve got the pages written in html, you need to upload them to a server.  My ISP includes web hosting in our monthly fees.  They now have a built in uploader, but when I first published my pages I used an FTP that I downloaded free from the Internet.<br/>

With geocities.com (subset of yahoo), there&#39;s an online editor.  That&#39;s where <br/>
I do mine.  I don&#39;t know how to upload pages to servers.  Lame, huh?  (But I <br/>
do have a bunch of pages, anyway. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
With the editor, they have &quot;save and continue,&quot; so you can save what you have <br/>
so far but stay in the editor.  And there&#39;s &quot;preview&quot; so you can keep looking <br/>
at it bit by bit as you make changes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262089379">It&#39;s more than that.  The creative process is the same if you&#39;re <br/>
using an old data processor or Word.  This is more like the <br/>
difference between paint by number with 6 little pots of paint and a <br/>
clean canvass with tubes and tubes of paints to mix.  <br/>
<br/>
Most adults want a page to get information across.  Yours is a good <br/>
example.  There&#39;s lots of info there laid out in a very logical way.  <br/>
My sites are the same way.  For people looking for unschooling info, <br/>
they&#39;re perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Teens are generally looking for a more creative outlet.  The web <br/>
pages designed by them don&#39;t have a lot of info but they represent <br/>
who they are and what they like.  Kate changes her web site on a <br/>
regular basis (and I really hate the one she has now but it&#39;s a good <br/>
example of what she and her peers are doing) taking a lot time <br/>
manipulating graphics and setting evrything just perfectly while <br/>
showing off new code yet there&#39;s not much there in the way of <br/>
content.  Of course, she uses CSS and Java too but it all started <br/>
with HTML.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-276155841">Thanks for all the suggestions!  Chloe will be thrilled to see them, she&#39;s <br/>
already playing around with color and fonts and likes to import what she <br/>
calls &quot;screenies&quot; to her sites at Neopets.  She also loves to write, so I <br/>
think her site will be very creatively done with her own poems and stories <br/>
and lots of color.  I don&#39;t know anything at all about HTML so it&#39;s the <br/>
perfect example of unschooling.  She&#39;s been teaching herself this for about <br/>
4 months- since we moved and she got her own computer.  In fact, she spends <br/>
most of the day on the computer figuring things out- time which most of her <br/>
friends who are not homeschoolers would never to be allowed to spend in <br/>
front of a computer.   My brother is a web designer and hosts our email on <br/>
his domain name so we are hoping we can use that server for Chloe&#39;s <br/>
website.<br/>

Roxana also started on Neopets when she was a young teen. She suggests <br/>
that getting a site on geocities, using their website development <br/>
tools, can be a good way to get more familiar with html. She also <br/>
worked the same way Sandra suggested - finding things she liked on <br/>
other websites, looking at their source code, and fooling with it to <br/>
make it do what she wanted. She got a little html dictionary - just a <br/>
list of html tags and what each does - to make it easy to find what she <br/>
wanted. Then she played with it a lot, over years, and is now really <br/>
good at writing html code from scratch. Her website is typical of teens <br/>
- lots of color and graphics - creativity being the focus.<br/>
