<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862418939">Since living things in compost bins, and rotting squirrels have been<br/>
discussed, I feel comfortable on bringing up this one...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading &quot;Stiff:  The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers&quot; by Mary<br/>
Roach.  It is a hilarious look at what happens to cadavers that have been<br/>
donated to science.  Some chapters include:  <br/>
<br/>
A Head is a Terrible Thing to Waste (practicing neurosurgery and plastic<br/>
surgery on the dead)<br/>
<br/>
Crimes of Anatomy (body snatching and other sordid tales from the dawn of<br/>
human dissection)<br/>
<br/>
Life After Death (human decay and what can be done about it)<br/>
<br/>
Dead Man Driving (the ghastly, necessary science of impact tolerance)<br/>
<br/>
And so on.  It covers airline crash stories, army cadavers, crucifixion<br/>
experiments, cannibalism, and a few more hilariously approached gruesome<br/>
topics.  <br/>
<br/>
Now in paperback, a NYT best seller, and at your local bookstore...<br/>

===============<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a pretty interesting book along these lines called _Murdering to <br/>
Dissect: Grave-robbing, Frankenstein and the anatomy literature_ by Tim <br/>
Marshall. It&#39;s a cool historical literary/cultural studies book on early <br/>
medicine and Mary Shelley&#39;s novel _Frankenstein_.<br/>
