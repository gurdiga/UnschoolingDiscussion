<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788237021">This thread reminded me of the TCS list too.  I recall a discussion on <br/>
knives.  Someone posted about being in the kitchen and a 5 month old child <br/>
was interested in a large, sharp knife.  The recommendation was to allow the <br/>
baby to explore the knife with her own hands rather than redirect her <br/>
attention or put it away.  It got really freaky and scary after that.  I <br/>
stuck out the entire thread just to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing something.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry but I would not allow my 5 month old child to &#39;handle&#39; a huge, <br/>
sharp knife whether I was holding her or not.  Babies have very fast <br/>
reactions and I don&#39;t see how it would even be possible to safely allow a <br/>
child to hold such a thing.  Someone even said that if she happened to cut <br/>
herself, she would learn &#39;respect&#39; for the knife.  YIKES!  I ran and never <br/>
looked back.<br/>
<br/>
Another time an 11 year old had a 16 year old boyfriend and was having sex.  <br/>
There were actually people who said they should be left alone to make their <br/>
own &#39;informed&#39; decisions.  That it would be coercive to interfere.  She <br/>
ended up pregnant.  Call me coercive, but I wouldn&#39;t stand idly by and end <br/>
up with a pregnant 11 year old daughter, that&#39;s for sure!   There is no way <br/>
an 11 year old girl is capable of truly understanding the emotional <br/>
ramifications of sex and pregnancy, much less have the ability to be a <br/>
mother.  That poor child *needed* a mother herself!<br/>
<br/>
Not every situation was as bad but I left that list after 6-8 months or so <br/>
feeling frightened, appalled and scared for some of the children.  It seemed <br/>
rather fishy to me, also, that everything was hypothetical.  That was <br/>
strange.<br/>
<br/>
I did come away with a few bits of knowledge and insight, but overall, it <br/>
was an incredibly negative experience.  I always wonder if I just hit that <br/>
list at a &#39;bad&#39; time or if it is always like that....<br/>

<br/>
The TCS stuff has sounded to me as though it were written by the kind of <br/>
people who have zero social skills whatsoever.   Those logician types who are good <br/>
programmers but haven&#39;t figured out how to offer someone a seat and a glass <br/>
of water, and will never figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
After forming that theory, I never did read anything in their writing that <br/>
lead me to think differently.<br/>
<br/>
So if they see human reactions and relations as something you could apply a <br/>
political theory to, across the board, then maybe their stuff would start to <br/>
work.  But if their principle overrides all human considerations, it&#39;s not a <br/>
good thing to apply to humans.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling might work about the same way (if you squint at them both from a <br/>
distance) but with unschooling, what ends up NOT working with humans is <br/>
dumped.  We&#39;re giving freedom not because freedom is somehow valuable in a vacuum, <br/>
but because a human who makes decisions in a safe but open situation, with <br/>
advice and suggestions, comes to learn<br/>
a) how to make decisions<br/>
b) how to ask for advice (as well as when to ask and whom to ask)<br/>
c) how to extend that to others, naturally.<br/>
<br/>
TCS doesn&#39;t seem to apply to others.  I gather that they&#39;re to protect their <br/>
children&#39;s rights at the expense of infidels who need to protect their own <br/>
rights, or suffer the consequences.  (I could be wrong on that, I&#39;m only <br/>
remembering one discussion where that was a factor, but I remember it wasn&#39;t being <br/>
promoted so much as something to spread to all manking, but something almost to <br/>
use against those outside their fold.<br/>

such, my daughter has gotten the most help there for what really seems to be<br/>
the kind of parenting we try to do here.  I&#39;m not sure why it resonates with<br/>
her, but it does.  And her parenting, which was already awesome, has gotten<br/>
even better since she&#39;s been there.  All I can conclude from that is<br/>
&quot;different strokes&quot;, because we find it easy to discuss parenting now, me<br/>
from this point of view, and she from the TCS point of view.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d like to highlight that.  My feelings exactly.  I keep finding myself <br/>
wanting to rejoin that list just to obseve for a while.  It&#39;s really awful <br/>
that I have such negative feelings about a philosophy intending to honor and <br/>
respect children, but I just can&#39;t seem to shake it.  I scared the hell out <br/>
of my aunt back when I was on that list and told her some of the stories I <br/>
had read there.  She was terrified that I was going to agree.  She felt so <br/>
many of the &#39;parents&#39; on that list were neglectful.  I&#39;d love to actually <br/>
meet someone who follows TCS that isn&#39;t because I left feeling much the <br/>
same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057306742">I agree. Most restaurant kitchens are worked by men here in NYC. When I <br/>
apprenticed at one of them here, the first thing they asked me was, <br/>
&quot;Where&#39;s your knife?&quot; (I had forgotten to bring it with me, ugh!) Then <br/>
my chef proceeded to share with me some horror stories about unattended <br/>
knives, blunt knives, etc. etc. Given my own accidents in the kitchen, <br/>
I would never, EVER let a 5 month old play with a knife. It&#39;s just too <br/>
dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Which takes me to the distinction between a rule and a safety measure: <br/>
A rule can be haphazard. A safety measure is based on fact --a 5 month <br/>
old does not have the motor skills to handle a knife.<br/>
