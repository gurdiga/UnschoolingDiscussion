<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460222174">If you have to keep records, I think it is nice to keep track of stuff in <br/>
more &quot;real&quot; terms - rather than schoolish terms. If you keep your records <br/>
this way, you don&#39;t have to be thinking all the time in terms of school <br/>
subjects, you just have to go to your records once a month and translate a <br/>
few things into the subjects you need.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to upload a file for recordkeeping into the files area of this <br/>
list - or ask Joyce to do it if it doesn&#39;t let nonmoderators.  It is called <br/>
&quot;Recordkeeping for Unschoolers&quot;.<br/>
