&lt;&lt;Well, I think most of us love when someone else does the cooking.  It<br/>
is a different enjoyment all together.  Maybe, it makes you feel like<br/>
a kid again when you were always taken care of or maybe it is the<br/>
pleasure of not doing the work!  Either way, I love when someone<br/>
cooks for me, so I can see why kids love when we pamper them a little.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Yeah it is nice. Maybe that&#39;s why some women just love to go out to eat, no<br/>
one at home will do it for them!!! Then there&#39;s the other side of it and<br/>
people like me who also enjoy cooking for others too. I just love having a<br/>
house full and making a homemade dinner for everyone that they enjoy. I<br/>
especially enjoy Christmas for that reason. Not just that reason but it&#39;s<br/>
one of them.<br/>
