Hard Thinking Made Easy - Sandra Dodd (Backorder)<br/>
Sometimes people fear to think. Have you had many unauthorized thoughts? <br/>
Would you like to have many more? Think where no thoughts have gone before. <br/>
Changing the World- Sandra Dodd (Backorder)<br/>
Now what? Look where you are and look what you&#39;re doing! Changing the world. <br/>
Eyewitness to Unschooling - Sandra Dodd and Pam Sorooshian<br/>
It can seem that your own family&#39;s unschooling might be a lucky fluke, until <br/>
you see it working in another family. Pam and Sandra have known each other <br/>
(and kids and husbands) since 1996. Each will tell tales of the other&#39;s kids at <br/>
various stages and ages from five to eighteen years old, having seen them in <br/>
many different places and situations over the years. <br/>
The Journey of a Lifetime - Mary Gold<br/>
Unschooling is as much about us as it is about our children. In choosing the <br/>
unschooling path we have the opportunity to join in our children&#39;s journey of <br/>
discovery; and in doing so, to let go of our preconceived notions of learning. <br/>
Join Mary as she shares the experience of her family&#39;s trek from schooling to <br/>
unschooling and discusses how they learned to embrace this journey of a <br/>
lifetime.<br/>
Making Connections - Anne Ohman<br/>
Making conscious connections is vital in our unschooling lives, for our <br/>
children and for ourselves. Join Anne as she discusses the importance of making <br/>
connections with the world around us, with each other in our relationships, and <br/>
with our true Selves. She&#39;ll explore the many ways our children learn through <br/>
making connections, and offer practical suggestions for facilitating their <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
Joy of Math - Pam Sorooshian <br/>
Relax! It is human nature to observe, organize, categorize, sort, compare, <br/>
contrast, combine, separate, and otherwise play around with math. Learning is <br/>
intrinsically joyful and learning math is no exception. You don&#39;t need to <br/>
&quot;unschool everything but math!&quot; Even if you, yourself, suffer from math anxiety, you <br/>
can avoid passing that on to your kids and you can have a good time <br/>
supporting them as they gain competency and confidence in mathematics. What do they <br/>
need to learn? How will they learn it? What about algebra? Get your questions <br/>
answered and be inspired!<br/>
Rules vs Principles - Ben Lovejoy<br/>
Ben Lovejoy explores the definition differences between &quot;rules&quot; and <br/>
&quot;principles&quot; and bridges that to a discussion of family rules vs. family principles. He <br/>
will list some family rules and facilitate an exercise to turn these rules <br/>
into principles. Finally, he will state his family&#39;s own guiding <br/>
principles.<br/>
Unschooling the Highly Sensitive / Out of Sync Child - Anne Ohman and Mary <br/>
Gold<br/>
Join Anne and Mary as they discuss the traits of highly sensitive / out of <br/>
sync children and the blessings they bring into the world, as well as the <br/>
challenges that accompany them. They&#39;ll talk about their journey with their own <br/>
children and how unschooling has freed their spirit, minimized the challenges, and <br/>
allowed their true Selves to shine.<br/>
Unschooling to Harvard - Maureen Carey <br/>
Maureen Carey will share the experience of the final phase of sixteen years <br/>
of unschooling, supporting her daughter Aidin through the process of applying <br/>
to college. And how they survived the only crisis of confidence in all those <br/>
years, waiting for &quot;the big envelope or the small envelope,&quot; that indicates <br/>
admission or rejection. She will explain what the Harvard Dean of Admissions told <br/>
her was the reason Aidin was admitted and given a scholarship that will pay <br/>
for all of her tuition and fees.<br/>
2002 Conference Program (contains all speakers notes) $4<br/>
2002 Conference Cassette Tapes Available $6 <br/>
Learning, Yes. Schooling, No Thank You - Luz Shosie and Ned Vare <br/>
We&#39;ll talk about how we unlearned years of schooling and trusted our son to <br/>
direct his own education. And we&#39;ll answer your questions about how unschooling <br/>
really works.<br/>
My Parents Trusted me - Fiona Hutchison<br/>
My parents trusted me to live on my own in New York City as young as 13 years <br/>
old. My &quot;schooling&quot; was extremely limited and relatively ignored (my father <br/>
used to say, &quot;F is for fantastic, my dear!&quot;), but my &quot;education&quot; was rich and <br/>
colorful and intense. I will give a brief account of my unschooling life and <br/>
then be happy to answer any questions you may have about a teen on her own. I <br/>
certainly don&#39;t have all the answers to how unschooling works, but I can tell <br/>
you what worked for me when I was given the freedom to pursue my dreams<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling as Mindful Living - Anne Ohman<br/>
As an educational choice, unschooling has infinite benefits. Yet unschooling <br/>
can also bring so much more into our family&#39;s lives when we allow it to be <br/>
used on a greater scale - as a path to more mindful living. Come explore Mindful <br/>
Unschooling with Anne Ohman, and we&#39;ll discuss how to not only free and <br/>
empower your children through unschooling, but also bless your own life in rewarding <br/>
and enlightening ways. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Changes - Lisa Bugg<br/>
The old adage, &quot;nothing remains constant but change&quot;, should be the maxim for <br/>
all unschoolers. Unschooling demands that we challenge our long held beliefs <br/>
about children and education. The changes we move through, while welcome, are <br/>
at times very stressful. And then, just when we think we have our educational <br/>
philosophy pinned down, the children change! Many adolescents have sent their <br/>
unschooling parents scurrying for support when they come in and demand A PLAN. <br/>
Your budding 8 year old, who still wants to be a firefighter, turns around; <br/>
and you discover a 17 year old who wants to work in the matter-antimatter lab <br/>
over at NASA. Let&#39;s talk about how unschooling changes us, as we move through <br/>
our ever-changing lives.<br/>
Out of Sync Child - Lisa Bugg and Anne Ohman&#39;s <br/>
In this open discussion/funshop, we&#39;re going to talk about how unschooling is <br/>
so perfect for your *out of sync* child. Together, we&#39;ll share our <br/>
experiences with our children, and we&#39;ll do our best to answer each other&#39;s questions, <br/>
too. <br/>
Why You Can&#39;t Let Go - Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
Do you secretly lust after the perfect math program? Do you dog ear all the <br/>
pages in homeschooling catalogs and end up feeling guilty for not doing enough? <br/>
Do you sometimes envy the school at homers because they have it all planned <br/>
out for them? Let&#39;s talk about why packaged learning is so appealing and <br/>
explore some ways that may help you let go. <br/>
Reluctant Husbands/Reluctant Fathers - Ben Lovejoy<br/>
Ben Lovejoy, recently an unschooling father and husband, facilitates a <br/>
roundtable discussion about the unique opportunities and challenges which face <br/>
fathers and husbands in an unschooling home. Topics intended for discussion <br/>
include: 1) Why unschooling?, 2) &quot;You&#39;re doing WHAT?&quot; and numerous other questions <br/>
from family and friends, 3) What about sports, college, and other &quot;organized&quot; <br/>
rites of passage into adulthood? 4) What do I have to offer when their mom does <br/>
all the fun things with the kids? and 5) Whose life is it anyway? This <br/>
discussion isn&#39;t just for fathers, husbands, or males; nor is it intended to anwer <br/>
all of our questions. It&#39;s merely a discussion to help us all along our <br/>
unschooling journey.<br/>
