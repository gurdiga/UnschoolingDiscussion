<div id="ygrps-yiv-433939857">Interesting how the only people that are taking this to a personal <br/>
level in a very mean way are the ones that accuse any debateful types <br/>
of meanness!!<br/>
Attacking someone&#39;s marriage? That&#39;s down and dirty imo.<br/>
And to attribute abuse in a marriage with personality types that <br/>
enjoy deep, thoughtful debate? How do you come up with that? Strong <br/>
minded people are usually not the type to tolerate abuse! Sheesh, <br/>
that was just rude.<br/>
Marriage problems happen to a LOT of people. That doesn&#39;t equal abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m reading that shoving views down a person&#39;s throat is the <br/>
issue. I believe I questioned the belief that an Unschooling child <br/>
could &quot;get behind.&quot;<br/>
So how was that shoving views down anyone&#39;s throat?<br/>
Tell me, in this &quot;oh so nice&quot; group, how would one of you point out <br/>
the flaw in that line of thinking?<br/>
Or do statements like that just get ignored?<br/>

I think the people involved in that discussion are no longer part of the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900057586">But isn&#39;t that the crux of the whole matter--how each person defines things.<br/>
Others defined the argumentative types (I don&#39;t think debateful is a word)<br/>
as being mean and taking it to a personal level.  Obviously, you don&#39;t.<br/>
Different strokes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And others certainly don&#39;t define in-your-face/stuff-it-down-your throat<br/>
styles as deep (I won&#39;t touch that with a ten foot pole &lt;g&gt;), thoughtful<br/>
debates.  Again, you don&#39;t agree.  And again, different strokes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you have lumped several posters and various threads all into one lump.<br/>
So, unless you were the person who said some people enjoy being whacked up<br/>
along side the head verbally, then the post wasn&#39;t &quot;all about you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And this is how I would point out the flaws in your line of thinking, since<br/>
you asked.  And, no I didn&#39;t ignore the post.<br/>
