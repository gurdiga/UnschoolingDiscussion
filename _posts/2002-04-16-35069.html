<br/>
Worth Quoting<br/>
<br/>
       At a time when the stated goal of social policy in this country <br/>
is a tractable workforce and good team players, the goal of <br/>
homeschooling is strong competent individuals.<br/>
       At a time when schools teach kids to throw off parental <br/>
authority and family values in favor of peer group values and the <br/>
authority of experts and professionals, homeschooling teaches kids <br/>
the true meaning of love and trust and being able to rely on those <br/>
who care about you.<br/>
       When I think about the people in my life who have already <br/>
passed on, and who are growing old now, I think about the memories <br/>
that have made their eyes light up. It&#39;s not the academic <br/>
achievements. Not the schoolish things. It&#39;s all the small things we <br/>
did together long ago that are still the most important things to <br/>
them, and to me.<br/>
	-Mark Hegener, keynote speech, 1999<br/>

In Memoriam<br/>
<br/>
       Dorothy Lucille Moore, one of the early pioneers of <br/>
homeschooling in the United States, died on Thursday morning, <br/>
February 21, in Honolulu, Hawaii. Born in 1915, on a farm in South <br/>
Dakota, she later married Raymond Moore and spent many years working <br/>
to establish and upgrade educational programs in post-war Japan. A <br/>
Seventh-day Adventist, she worked to establish Adventist school <br/>
systems in Japan and Okinawa.<br/>
       After years of service in education and ministry, Dorothy, <br/>
beginning in 1983, helped to establish the Moore Academy. Through the <br/>
Academy, she helped hundreds of families find resources and create <br/>
personalized studies so they could successfully homeschool their <br/>
children. She helped co-author one of the earliest, and best, books <br/>
on homeschooling, Better Late Than Early: A New Approach to Your <br/>
Child&#39;s Education.<br/>
       Dorothy&#39;s loving presence will be missed in the homeschooling <br/>
community. For a more in-depth memorial please go to the Moore <br/>
Foundation&#39;s website at:<br/>

The Quaqua Society, Inc.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.quaqua.org">http://www.quaqua.org</a><br/>
<br/>
       Dan Witte, a home-educated attorney who has assisted in <br/>
litigation directed towards preserving home education and parental <br/>
rights, wrote in April to tell us about a scholarship foundation he <br/>
has created called the Quaqua Society, Incorporated. Dan writes: <br/>
&quot;Quaqua was formed as part of a pro-bono project to provide <br/>
scholarships to outstanding home-educated graduates of diverse <br/>
backgrounds who are headed to college or some other institution of <br/>
advanced learning, as an attempt to give back to home education what <br/>
home education has given to me. Quaqua is a non-profit, <br/>
non-denominational charity that exacts no membership fees, has no <br/>
paid staff, and does not promote or sell any particular curriculum, <br/>
merchandise or pedagogy.&quot;<br/>
       The Quaqua website illustrates Dan&#39;s commitment to excellence. <br/>
Dan wrote: &quot;Quaqua is carefully structured to involve different <br/>
segments of the home-education community and to address their unique <br/>
needs to the greatest degree possible. We cooperate with existing <br/>
home-education organizations, publications, events, students, <br/>
families, and communities to render our service. Award events are <br/>
designed to rotate and occur at conventions around the country <br/>
sponsored by different interest groups of diverse backgrounds.&quot;<br/>
       Dan requested that we &quot;caution people that we are still trying <br/>
to recruit and finalize preparations, and as a result we would <br/>
appreciate people leaving the lines of communication open at this <br/>
juncture for those (people or companies or organizations) who 1) wish <br/>
to volunteer or know of other exceptional potential volunteers <br/>
(particularly accountants, tax attorneys, financial investment <br/>
managers, computer experts, others who can help Quaqua manage <br/>
scholarship funds, address IRS filings each year, maintain computer <br/>
operations in the most professional manner possible; or volunteers <br/>
who fill the tougher-to-fill niches in the Selection Committee <br/>
diversity requirement of the By-Laws; or people who can help expand <br/>
the acceptance and reach of Quaqua to new audiences), 2) wish to <br/>
raise funds or donate to the scholarship fund (I submitted the <br/>
tax-exempt application to the IRS, and donations now will be <br/>
retroactively covered); or 3) are from the media or other <br/>
organizations.  The web site is fairly thorough, but once I get <br/>
things fully up and running I will be happy to field questions from <br/>
people who wish to apply for scholarships next year.&quot;<br/>

AHA FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about the American Homeschool Association<br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s behind the American Homeschool Association?<br/>
       The publishers of Home Education Magazine founded the AHA in <br/>
1995, and have maintained it since that time as a free services <br/>
organization for homeschoolers, working online to provide <br/>
information, resources, networking opportunities and more.<br/>
<br/>
How can we join your program?<br/>
       The American Homeschool Association does not offer a program of <br/>
study, only free information and networking with homeschoolers <br/>
online. The name of the organization is similar to a well-known <br/>
correspondence program, The American School, but there is no <br/>
connection between the two.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you offer any publications or materials in print?<br/>
       For the first few years of the AHA&#39;s existence we did provide a <br/>
published (print) newsletter, informational brochures, etc., but now <br/>
the Internet provides a much faster, more convenient, and totally <br/>
free way to do the work we want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Other Homeschooling FAQ&#39;s and Q&A&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
       The AHA website offers a collection of FAQ&#39;s (Frequently Asked <br/>
Questions) and Q&A&#39;s (Questions and Answers) from some of the best <br/>
homeschooling sites on the web, including the sites for Home <br/>
Education Magazine, the National Home Education Network, <br/>
Unschooling.com, Ann Zeise&#39;s A to Z Home&#39;s Cool, and Holt Associates.<br/>
