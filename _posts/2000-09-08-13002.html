<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327373712">We have rattlers here in KS too. When we first moved to this house, which is <br/>
in the country, we often would find a prairie rattlers or two in the yard. <br/>
One night I was walking down a dirt road with our St Bernard pup. I wide <br/>
stepped over a rarrler who was on the road. I would have went around it but I <br/>
did not see it in time. The pup ran right up to it and stuffed her nose down <br/>
on it to see what it was. And of course it bit her, in the neck. We rushed <br/>
her to a vet and she survived. As the years went by the rattlers decided we <br/>
were no fun to live with I guess because we no longer find them in the yard. <br/>
But a small child was bit by a rattler 20 miles from here and he lived in <br/>
town. I hear he is going to be ok. What a frightning experience. <br/>
