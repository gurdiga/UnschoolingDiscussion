<div id="ygrps-yiv-6093811">Hi all! I wanted to share this web site I found today. I was looking for a <br/>
recipe today, (my Grandma used to make and couldn&#39;t find it here at home in <br/>
her old books and cards) and searched and searched online. I found this place <br/>
while googling and this guy is amazing!!! I searched the archives and <br/>
couldn&#39;t find the recipe so I emailed my question about 8pm, I already got a <br/>
response! He finds other things besides recipes too. So if you need to know <br/>
how to convert yards to gallons (yes it is possible! &lt;g&gt;) or who said <br/>
something... This seems to be the guy to go to! His site is:<br/>

We *do* have the money she knows that while we&#39;re not filthy rich, we <br/>
definitely aren&#39;t hurting.<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe to buy something fun for the boy and send a little note <br/>
that we&#39;re homeschooling and don&#39;t donate to schools, and that we wanted <br/>
the boy to have something for himself...<br/>
Hmmmm, and maybe a book by John Holt for the mom/cousin? (sly grin)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the answer...<br/>
If I can only decide which book...<br/>
and what to get the little minx...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57296020">So - why is this different than kids walking up to adults and asking them <br/>
for money?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t contribute to school fundraising, in general, unless they are <br/>
selling something that I actually can use and selling it at a reasonable <br/>
price. I don&#39;t ask other people to pay for my kids&#39; activities and don&#39;t <br/>
expect to help pay for other peoples kids&#39; activities (other than through <br/>
taxes, of course), but I will let them work for reasonable pay and I let my <br/>
kids stand in front of stores and sell girl scout cookies because people <br/>
can walk right on by and many do, but others act like they&#39;re THRILLED to <br/>
see the girls there and are super happy to buy those Thin Mints. I&#39;m super <br/>
super careful to not let my kids approach people under circumstances where <br/>
the people feel at all pressured to contribute. I think it is wrong to ask <br/>
other people to support our own children, financially.<br/>

for public schools.  I always bristled when my kids came home from school <br/>
with the giftwrap brochure or whatever.  This was supposed to be about a FREE <br/>

The difference is that Camp Fire and Girl Scouts and all those other <br/>

government grants, which usually don&#39;t go directly to clubs anyway, <br/>
notwithstanding).  They are only supported by membership fees and what people <br/>
will give them.  I think fundraising is an honorable thing for kids to do for <br/>
a specific cause.  It teaches kids that if the things they want to do cost <br/>
money and best way to get that money is to earn it.  It teaches them the <br/>
value of hard work, too.  It also teaches them to be charitable and have <br/>
sympathy for good causes.  My own kid has learned so much self-confidence and <br/>
courtesy by attending these sales!  We have also witnessed some very selfless <br/>
and inspiring giving and had lots of encouragement by total strangers, too.  <br/>
This is why I am fully on board with kids in groups who aren&#39;t funded by <br/>
taxes having the experience of working for the money they need.  <br/>

But man-o-man, schools shouldn&#39;t have to do that.  Private schools should <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207058396">I think fund-raising can be good for the kids too, depending on how it is <br/>
done. I have no problem with kids in front of stores OFFERING a product or <br/>
making fliers and offering to walk dogs or do car washes or yard work, etc.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - as I said - I don&#39;t feel that it is RIGHT to put even the smallest <br/>
amount of pressure on anybody else to help pay for MY kids&#39; activities and <br/>
I very much resent ever feeling that pressure applied by other parents for <br/>
me to help pay for THEIR kids&#39; activities.<br/>
<br/>
Fundraising is ONLY okay in my mind if the product or service offered is <br/>
actually WORTH what is being charged AND if the people paying for it feel <br/>
like they are making a fully free choice.<br/>
<br/>
I resent it when other people&#39;s kids come up to me and beg me to buy things <br/>
from them that I don&#39;t even want, just so THEY can go do some cool activity <br/>
or participate in some group. I don&#39;t think kids should be allowed to put <br/>
their parents friends, relatives, and neighbors &quot;on the spot&quot; where they <br/>
feel like they have to give the kid money or look like a cheapskate and I <br/>
do NOT let my kids do that.<br/>
<br/>
I am totally absolutely FINE with the kids letting people know - &quot;We&#39;re <br/>
selling magazine subscriptions - we have a HUGE selection of magazines, you <br/>
can renew your existing subscriptions with us, and our prices are very <br/>
good. So let me know if you&#39;d like a catalog or want to order <br/>
something.&quot;  THEN walk away and let it go. Don&#39;t try to talk me into it. I <br/>
don&#39;t think it is remotely cute for kids to be learning to beg other people <br/>
to support their fun --- &quot;You should buy it because we really want to go on <br/>
this trip and we can&#39;t afford it without your help.&quot; So I should buy <br/>
something overpriced that I don&#39;t even really want so that somebody else&#39;s <br/>
kid can do something that their family can&#39;t afford? I really don&#39;t see <br/>
that as anything except begging. Again - offer goods or services - good <br/>
quality, low price - if people want them let them buy them -- I&#39;m talking <br/>
about kids putting friends and relatives on the spot to buy things they do <br/>
NOT want and don&#39;t value.<br/>
<br/>
If you expect me to buy something I don&#39;t even want, just to give your kids <br/>
a little money to do something -- I don&#39;t see that as any different AT ALL <br/>
then the little girl begging for a quarter to buy herself a candy.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will learn good lessons from fund-raising where they offer people a <br/>
real product that they want or a real service -- but to expect all their <br/>
friends to buy something whether they want it or not - to put pressure on <br/>
friends like that- is teaching them a whole different lesson, imo.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I haven&#39;t even asked any of my friends to buy candy.  I don&#39;t want to <br/>
be like the insurance salesman that everyone avoids!<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for us, we had a couple of really outgoing kids in the group last <br/>
year.  Their parents gave them a script to sell the candy and they were bold <br/>
enough to execute it.  The script is simple:  &quot;Hi (or good afternoon), would <br/>
you like to buy some CF candy?&quot;  If the answer is no, then they say &quot;okay, <br/>
thank you!&quot;.  If it&#39;s yes, then they bring the person to the table where the <br/>
adults basically just make the transaction.  Most of the kids are good at <br/>
saying thank you when the folks are leaving with their candy, too.  My son <br/>
learned to sell this way, and their example was invaluable.  Now those two <br/>
kids are gone and my son and others who learned from them is passing it down <br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
We have a philosophy that we can&#39;t claim credit for, but has been very <br/>
useful.  We code it SW-SW-SW....it means, &quot;some will, some won&#39;t, so what?&quot;  <br/>
The kids have really grasped that and it gives them just the umph to keep on <br/>
asking in the face of many rejections.<br/>
<br/>
Today a very nice thing happened.  First sale of the day.  My son asked the <br/>
question of a woman coming out of the store, and she stopped and said, &quot;Of <br/>
course I will!  But you have to do one thing for me.  I will buy the candy, <br/>
but you have to give it to someone who would like it, but can&#39;t really afford <br/>
it.&quot;  Then she said, &quot;Do you know why I bought candy from you?  Because you <br/>
ASKED me to.  I&#39;m in sales, and that&#39;s the really only way to sell anything!  <br/>
Ask for it!&quot;    :))))<br/>
<br/>
Later in the day Will gave that box to a mom with children who was really <br/>
having a tough time.  He told her it was a gift that someone else had <br/>
purchased for her.  I thought the whole thing was very sweet.  <br/>
