<div id="ygrps-yiv-624168817">OMG!  That made me laugh.  Loudly.<br/>
<br/>
They never said boo about constipation or brown pills  I hadn&#39;t eaten in days <br/>
though...<br/>
<br/>
My mother in law is the most nonjudgmental person I&#39;ve ever met.  She&#39;s <br/>
conservative and opinionated, but overwhelmingly respectful.  My father in <br/>
law was a UCC minister, yet they never asked why the kids weren&#39;t baptized, <br/>
they respected and didn&#39;t question our judgment.  About hsing (we haven&#39;t <br/>
tried to explain unschooling), she thinks its great.  She&#39;s a retired <br/>
schoolteacher - 1st grade.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;d rather she empty my commode than my own <br/>
mum!<br/>
<br/>
The whole concept of losing one&#39;s self-consciousness is an interesting one.  <br/>
I think a lot of us are more comfortable taking care of someone else than <br/>
being taken care of...<br/>
