<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533869689">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I like to chew ideas over a lot before swallowing, and reading stuff<br/>
that stretches my thinking about things helps me immeasurably.  If<br/>
anyone here has had their eyes opened in any new and exciting ways by<br/>
books they&#39;ve read in regards to parenting/education/relating to people,<br/>
I would appreciate pointers from them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go first ;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our Babies, Ourselves&quot; by Meredith Small<br/>
When my wife and I were burning through our midwife&#39;s library during her<br/>
pregnancy we borrowed and read &quot;The Continuum Concept.&quot;  I was<br/>
fascinated, but almost constantly irritated by what felt like<br/>
unsupported leaps of inference and much Freudian baggage.  In googling<br/>
around we came across OBO and got it from the library.  It&#39;s written<br/>
from an anthropology/socio-biology perspective, and explores<br/>
infant/toddler care across cultures.  I spent lots of time feeling<br/>
annoyed by it, but it made me consider all sorts of stuff that I hadn&#39;t<br/>
thought of before, and had a huge long term impact on the range of<br/>
options we could see in how to relate to our child.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Child&#39;s Work&quot; by Nancy Wallace<br/>
I read this a few years before my wife and I were even thinking about<br/>
having children.  At the time it felt fairly radical to me, although<br/>
after reading this list for awhile it might feel pretty &quot;school at<br/>
home&quot;ish.  Although I did OK from an academic perspective I never<br/>
enjoyed or felt safe in school.  Reading the Wallace&#39;s account of doing<br/>
it differently got me to really consider, for the first time in my life,<br/>
how one might get away from the structural problems built into our<br/>
concept of school.  It brought up lots of strong emotions from my time<br/>
in school, and got me crying many times reading it and seeing for the<br/>
first time practical solutions to the pain that school was causing for<br/>
someones child.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn<br/>
I think something on this list made me look up Alfie Kohn, and after<br/>
reading a few of the articles on his website I got this book from the<br/>
library.  It&#39;s too long, both in just using too many words to say most<br/>
things, and in repeating itself alot in different sections, but has been<br/>
great to read regardless.  As I mentioned in another post recently, it&#39;s<br/>
mostly a critique of behaviorist inspired methods of interacting with<br/>
people, with the focus on the problems with positive reinforcement<br/>
(since punishment is just too easy a target?)  He cites *lots* of<br/>
research in this, and I haven&#39;t gotten down to reading any of it yet,<br/>
although I would like to.  It&#39;s helped me think about how to structure<br/>
responses to friends/family that are more skeptical of the more<br/>
non-traditional directions we want to go as parents.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dumbing us Down&quot; by John Gatto<br/>
I also read this when I was closer to being in the school system than<br/>
the parent of someone in it.  Gatto strikes me as a bit strident at<br/>
times, but it also helped me to see the more &quot;medium is the message&quot;<br/>
problem with school at a time when I was waffling more about it.<br/>
Reading Gatto is sort of like reading the works of a religious convert;<br/>
he spent so much time as a &quot;model&quot; teacher, and clearly now looks back<br/>
on it with shame and horror.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No Greater Joy&quot; newsletter by the Pearls<br/>
Many months ago, when the Pearls were going to be giving a seminar in<br/>
Eugene Oregon, I saw a post by someone asking for advice with strategies<br/>
for making their displeasure known.  (The Pearls advocate *extremely*<br/>
controlling and conservative parenting from a rigid religious<br/>
perspective, lots of spanking and guilt and molding of blank slates.)  I<br/>
found their website while looking for more info, and saw that you can<br/>
subscribe to the newsletter for free.  It&#39;s been a disturbing and<br/>
enlightening sort of &quot;how the other half lives&quot; view (although I kind of<br/>
worry what our mail carrier will think of us!)  What&#39;s been hardest for<br/>
me is seeing how clearly the people writing for it are motivated by the<br/>
desire to do the right thing for their children.  Don&#39;t get it if you<br/>
have high blood pressure ;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Finite and Infinite Games&quot; by James Carse<br/>
I liked this one better when I was younger; I just re-read it and it<br/>
seems like it has lots more holes in it&#39;s reasoning and is more reliant<br/>
on cute/clever turns of phrase than when I read it the first time.  It&#39;s<br/>
not really about education or parenting except insofar as it&#39;s sort of<br/>
all about intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation, power dynamics, and why<br/>
and how one chooses to live life.  But it is kinda fun, and might give<br/>
you a new way to look at things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people recommend &quot;How To Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So<br/>
Kids Will Talk&quot; and &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; on the list before.  Any<br/>
comments on what made you like them?  Other book/author recommendations?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
