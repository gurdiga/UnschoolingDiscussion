<div id="ygrps-yiv-817778034">I think there is a vast area of difference between the topic of<br/>
Homeschooling legal freedoms and unschooling our children (personal not<br/>
collective). Since3 this is a list that describes itself as an unschooling<br/>
list, can we please discuss it?<br/>
<br/>
Here is a new thread,<br/>
A local mom and I were discussing how as we have gotten deeper into<br/>
unschooling, HOMEschooling issues have begun to mean less to us. For<br/>
example, certain words are gone from our vocabulary - field trips,<br/>
homeschooling groups, and of course the typical ones, curriculum, language<br/>
arts, etc. We both have noticed that we feel disconnected to the<br/>
&quot;Homeschooling Community&quot; since *education* is not something we really think<br/>
about, we are now able to see that learning doesn&#39;t need quite so much<br/>
discussion and debate. The disconnection doesn&#39;t really bother us. In fact,<br/>
for me, it is a good thoing because I tend to get caught up with all the<br/>
pretty flashy ads for math books or reading programs even knowing it&#39;s not<br/>
good for the kids. (Just like Pop-tarts come in brightly colored boxes<br/>
designed to attract)<br/>
So, that&#39;s just an observation I&#39;ve had.<br/>
Question:<br/>
DD is 8 1/2 and just starting to read. She is interested in easy books but<br/>
our problem is the subject matter of said books. They are all about little<br/>
kid topics, starting kindegarten, babyish pictures, etc. Does anyone have<br/>
ideas on easy readers that are a little more interesting for tweens? (That<br/>
would inolve babysitting, horses or Mary Kate and Ashley? LOL )<br/>

learned to read with them....<br/>
<br/>
There is a Mary Kate and Ashley series written at 2nd grade level or so,<br/>
maybe for down the road a bit..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7477513">Thanks Dar, I didn&#39;t even THINK of comic books!<br/>
She loves them!<br/>
I did find a new magazine called Kid Power. It hg=ighlights all the popular<br/>
cartoon characters and has articles related to them that delve into pretty<br/>
interesting subjects (Ginger talking about geology)<br/>
When she handed it to me at teh store and said &quot;Does this say Kid Power?&quot; I<br/>
breathed that sigh of relief!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Magic Tree House series (very easy readers)<br/>
Magic School Bus chapter books<br/>
Mary-Kate and Ashley Detective series (the other series aren&#39;t good for<br/>
early readers IMO, but the detective stories are quite fun)<br/>
