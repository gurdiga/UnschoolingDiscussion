<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912289355">This tread could not have coome at a better time!! thank you  thank you<br/>
thank you!!! I was thinking about how much tv we watch around here and<br/>
kind of justifing cable because we have a big screen tv (DH X-mas gift)<br/>
but since we just moved we haven&#39;t had cable for about a week and life is<br/>
so much calmer! So last night as we were watching The 1900 House I<br/>
casually made the suggestion that we not get cable again, Dh agreed right<br/>
away (I never in a million years thought that would happen) and the boys<br/>
argued untill I explained that with the money we saved on cable we could<br/>
get a membership to the Zoo, then they agreed too. So yeah... my house is<br/>
now cable free!!<br/>
<br/>
And since I just posted that novel maybe I should introduce myself, I&#39;ve<br/>
been lurking since I signed up.<br/>
I&#39;m Beth, married with 2 wild boys ages 6 and 8, we started homeschooling<br/>
in Jan when they wanted to put my kindergarden son in anger management<br/>
classes because he would not sit in his chair after he had finished his<br/>
work and was bored.  I pulled the other one 3 weeks later after I saw the<br/>
improvement in the younger one. Soon after that I found &quot;the Unschooling<br/>
Handbook&quot; (thank you Mary) and knew that was the way for us. Let&#39;s see...<br/>
anything else?? I work from home (Creative Memories, yes I do a LOT of<br/>
scrabpbooking! &lt;g&gt; ) and We live in D/FW Texas<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! I&#39;m new myself to this list. I&#39;m Amy and have a one-year-old daughter (tomorrow!) named Accalia. That&#39;s wonderful that your dh agreed to get rid of the cable. I honestly can&#39;t see mine agreeing to that right now. He&#39;d much rather have cable than Internet and I&#39;m the other way around. Oh well!<br>
