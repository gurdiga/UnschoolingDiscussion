<div id="ygrps-yiv-807918692">We have 5 children and have been unschooling for about 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Adriane (11) is big into her animals.  Her goat is due to kid any<br/>
day now and we have all learned the signs of impending labor...and are<br/>
making the poor goat extremely paranoid by following her around, staring at<br/>
her all the time  :)  Adriane and Zach (8) spent most of yesterday making<br/>
decorative signs for all the bedroom doors.<br/>
<br/>
Zach is big into objects in motion through space.  He golfs, shoots a BB<br/>
gun, rides a scooter and bike off ramps, etc..  We found an injured bird the<br/>
other day and he spent a morning making toys to put in the cage with it.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie (5) is trying to learn to read and figured out several sight words<br/>
and is able to recognize those words within other words, like &quot;no&quot; is in<br/>
&quot;nothing&quot;.  She likes to paint, play dress up, make huge messes, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Danny (3) and Michelle (2) are more into television than the other kids.<br/>
They like Dora the Explorer and Veggie Tales, etc..<br/>
<br/>
We have very few rules around here.  The kids watch all and any television<br/>
they want.  Currently all the kids are upstairs playing together.  They eat<br/>
whatever they want.  For lunch today, they requested yogurt and fruit.  Only<br/>
one takes a nap or has a quiet time and he says he &quot;loves naps&quot;.  Later<br/>
today some homeschool kids are coming over to play, then we are off to<br/>
gymnastics and baseball.  After dinner, Adriane and Zach will finish their<br/>
sewing projects that they entered in the county fair where they are also<br/>
showing their rabbits.<br/>
