<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490117018">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Since I am very new to this you will have to excuse the immense <br/>
amount of questions you will probably be getting from me!  I was <br/>
wondering what books/magazines related to unschooling that everyone <br/>
could suggest.  So far, I have read some of Holt&#39;s books, Linda <br/>
Dobson, and just subscribed to lifelong learning.  Very slim thus far <br/>
so I would love to start getting suggestions.  I have already ordered <br/>
some of the books you guys have mentioned in passing!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Olga</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168599147">Olga,<br/>
David Albert&#39;s two books are great.  I just finished the new one.  <br/>
They are:  And the skylark sings with me and Homeschooling and the <br/>
Voyage of Self Discovery.  I also liked Nancy Wallace&#39;s books though <br/>
it&#39;s been a while and I&#39;m not sure if they are <br/>
completely &quot;unschooly&quot;.  They are: Better Than School and Child&#39;s <br/>
Work.  Might have to check the library for them.  Grace Lewellyn&#39;s <br/>
Real Lives gave me a hint of what to expect when the kids are older.<br/>

;-) but the message boards of Unschooling.com :-) It&#39;s hearing real people<br/>
talk about their real experiences and feelings and thoughts that helped me<br/>
get unschooling!<br/>
