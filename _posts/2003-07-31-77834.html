<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958932276">Tia, Nancy, Tim!! and anyone else in BC.<br/>
<br/>
My question is how does one get a job in BC?  I have wanted to move to BC<br/>
since I went there in oooh &#39;91.  Our big problem is debt , me not working,<br/>
and my husbands lack of a degree.  He&#39;s amazingly smart and learns quickly<br/>
and has a few years in University.  But with four kids and homeschooling we<br/>
can&#39;t see getting him back in school.<br/>
<br/>
I love every bit of BC that I&#39;ve seen.  Lived in Kamloops for 8 months.  I<br/>
really would just like to have the view and the air.  It was so soul<br/>
refreshing to stand on my balcony in Kamloops half way up the mountain and<br/>
look down and around the valley.  I would feel the stress melt away it was<br/>
amazing.  If you could just put that in a bottle and send me some on a<br/>
regular basis that would be splendid. 8-D  I have heard that parts of the<br/>
mainland are very heavily sprayed Penticton-Okanogan areas specifically is<br/>
the Nelson area as bad?  It&#39;s too late for me to try and articulate what I<br/>
want any ideas or what ever are appreciated.  Thanks<br/>

&gt; &gt; How cold does Canada get? Which part of Canada are we talking about?<br/>
We&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; be moving w/ in 12-18 months. I&#39;ve narrowed it down to North America or<br/>
&gt; &gt; Italy.  Can anyone recommend web sites I can check out?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Canada is a huge country.  Where I live (Vancouver Island) the weather is<br/>
&gt; much like the Seattle area, lots of rain in winter, fairly dry but<br/>
&gt; unpredictable in summer, and an average of a few days of snow each winter.<br/>
&gt; Moving into the interior of BC and on to the prairies, it gets very cold<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; winter and very hot in the summer.  Move way up north into the<br/>
territories,<br/>
&gt; and you have very long winters that are extremely cold, and very short<br/>
&gt; summers with very long days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could google on Canada plus whatever thing you&#39;re concerned about,<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; weather.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175900030">As any where, work is tough to find until you get into the community and meet people.  You need enough cash to feed everyone while you look.  Friends moved to Nelson a few years ago, tried to find work, left again back up here because everyone in Vanc. etc. also want to live in Nelson - there&#39;s even a New York hair stylist living there who gave up the very $$ scene and moved to Nelson.  Employers can be choosers.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest your husband do Myers-Briggs testing at www.humanmetrics.com (here I go again) to focus on what he likes and does well.  Then make a list of all the projects he&#39;s down in that area.  Then make a list of BC employers who need that skill regardless of degrees.  Example: If he loves to manage building houses (ENTJ?) and he can show &quot;Challenge, Action taken, and Results&quot; in a functional resume, they will overlook the university-mouth-breathers like me and get the practical guy.  Unless they have a mouth-breather HR department.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and once he gets nibbles and an interview, but is still not hired, use LOTS of phone calls to get to know the community.<br/>
<br/>
Use vacation time to go visit these folks, just &quot;to see how they are doing.&quot;  Poeple usually hire those that they know - well.<br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s my thots...<br/>
