<br/>
I&#39;m sitting in a cool room playing high-points NeoPets game, and watching Man <br/>
of La Mancha (listening anyway) because I couldn&#39;t find Joseph and the <br/>
Amazing...la la<br/>
<br/>
And I wanted to point out that much of Holly&#39;s introduction to adult <br/>
sexuality  came from her questions about characters in musicals.   Maria and Tony.  <br/>
Potiphar&#39;s wife and Joseph.   Dulcinea singing &quot;born on a dung heap to die on a <br/>
dung heap, a strumpet men use and forget,&quot; then undergoing a transformation <br/>
because of the nobility modelled for her and shown to her by Don Quixote and <br/>
Sancho Panza.  They&#39;re just characters, and characters made up by another <br/>
character, at that.  A play within a play as it were, yet effective for stirring real <br/>
emotions in the audience.  Grease. Jesus Christ, Superstar.  Little Shop of <br/>
Horrors.  Issues of love, loyalty, kindness, sexual attraction and stories <br/>
about people NOT pressing the sexual issue (most of the show above, in one aspect <br/>
or another) are good vehicles for bringing those topics out for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
My kids will still listen to music designed for little kids--Raffi, Sesame <br/>
Street--but they&#39;ve also been analytical for years about more sophisticated <br/>
things.  Marty and Holly have both separately commented on how out of place <br/>
&quot;Little Bird&quot; seems, in that musical, musically and emotionally.   <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think of those things when we were discussing sex ed, and if this <br/>
wasn&#39;t the right group/location, I guess I should cut and paste this over to <br/>
wherever it belongs.<br/>
