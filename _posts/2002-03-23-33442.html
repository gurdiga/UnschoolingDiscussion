 </span></blockquote>They have made movies out of a couple of Koontz&#39;s books.  Big <br/>
mistake.  The reason the books are so great is the way he lets you <br/>
inside the thoughts of the characters.  Movies just can&#39;t do that as <br/>
well.<br/>

I like they way he put his words together. I wish he would get all those<br/>
poems that are attributed to &quot;The Book of Counted Sorrows&quot; and publish them.<br/>
He actually wrote them.<br/>
