I made myself a snowball<br/>
As perfect as could be.<br/>
I thought I&#39;d keep it as a pet<br/>
And let it sleep with me.<br/>
I made it some pajamas<br/>
And a pillow for its head.<br/>

But first - it wet the bed.<br/>
<br/>
And what kind of thing is this, that he said?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Instead of tug o&#39; war, let&#39;s play hug o&#39; war.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sex and pacifism.  He&#39;s a perverted peacenik.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote &quot;Queen of the Silver Dollar,&quot; which was recorded by various people <br/>
(Emmylou Harris notably), and it&#39;s about a bar.  It&#39;s a country and western <br/>
song, which might give him points with Baptists, but it&#39;s about a bar, which <br/>
is sinful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186406394">Actually our church homeschooling group is doing the art for the<br/>
walls of the new parish school - as part of a parish commitment<br/>
to making sure that each option is equally honored.   Our 6 y.o.<br/>
happily put a unicorn outside of the ark in her Noah picture.<br/>
Our pastor looking at the picture said &quot;and, sure as you&#39;re, born<br/>
you ain&#39;t gonna see no unicorn...&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152138143">I was at Costco last October when a young boy asked his mom to buy him a<br/>
unicorn costume.  She said no, because only girls are unicorns.  I said<br/>
maybe that is why the unicorns died out, because they were all female.  She<br/>
wasn&#39;t amused.<br/>
<br/>
I hate it when people tell kids they can&#39;t do something because they are a<br/>
boy or because they are a girl.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444376036">A couple of nights ago, after this discussion started, I was reading to Holly <br/>
from Falling Up, Marty&#39;s very favorite Shel Silverstein book, and though she <br/>
liked the ones which were just purely tight poetry, which would sound good <br/>
even if you didn&#39;t understand English, she started to be uncomfortable with <br/>
some of the meanness.  She said &quot;He&#39;s not very nice sometimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I saw her point, and read other stuff that night.<br/>
<br/>
I told Marty and he was aghast that Holly wouldn&#39;t LOVE Shel Silverstein.  So <br/>
I&#39;m planning to get Marty some Dr. Hook and The Medicine Show CDs with songs <br/>
by Shel Silverstein.  He&#39;ll be very happy.  He loves stuff like South Park <br/>
music, Beavis and Butt-head parody stuff, and he isn&#39;t aware how much Shel <br/>
Silverstein there is.<br/>
