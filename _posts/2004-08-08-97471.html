so what  if this kid eats only organic vegetarian, there is no way in <br/>
the world i  would let my kid eat your fast food!! lol there is no way <br/>
my kid would be  drinking a coke filled with all those chemicals <br/>
supporting a company that  kills their employees to keep them quiet <br/>
and rules our  marketplace&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
And when he&#39;s ten or 12 or 15 and DOES these things---eat fast food  and <br/>
drink a Coke----how will you treat him then? HE may feel incredible  guilt in <br/>
letting YOU down. Then it becomes a psychological problem. He may hide  it because <br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to hurt you. He may NOT hide it and totally rebel  against <br/>
what he feels has been a controlled childhood and eat ONLY fast  food.<br/>
 <br/>
He may NOT, but thinking about how limiting and controlling what he  eats as <br/>
a child can be interpreted by the child as he grows and finds out more  about <br/>
the world and about his trust in YOU is very important for  unschoolers.<br/>

My oldest son will be 22 next Tuesday.  He&#39;s been married for a  year.  By <br/>
Christmas he&#39;ll be in Iraq serving with the Army.  He&#39;s a  grown-up.  <br/>
 <br/>
On Father&#39;s Day he called me.  He said, &quot;Mom, I have a confession to  make.&quot;  <br/>
Thinking he was going to tell me something I probably already knew,  or <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be surprised about, (or that his wife is pregnant &lt;g&gt;), I  laughed and <br/>
said, &quot;yeah, what?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Mandy and I bought handguns.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Not what I was expecting to hear.  He rushed on, &quot;I know how you feel  about <br/>
guns in the house, but I just want you to know that the Army says I can  have <br/>
one in addition to my weapon in Iraq. And Mandy&#39;s going to be living alone  <br/>
the whole time I&#39;m gone and she&#39;s going to keep it in the bedroom.  And  when I <br/>
was buying it I felt so *guilty* like I was betraying everything you  taught <br/>
me.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I said, &quot;The better armed you are in Iraq, the happier I will be.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
He was glad to hear it, and relieved.  And he went on to say how he  thought <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t really be upset because I know he&#39;s grown up now, but that he  <br/>
still felt guilty about it.  We talked a bit more, and he wanted to make  sure <br/>
that he knew if Will was around their house he&#39;d have to keep them locked  in the <br/>
container, and that sometimes when they come to our house they&#39;ll be in  the <br/>
trunk of the car, but that he&#39;d never bring it into my house.  <br/>
 <br/>
His father and I have been divorced since he was 4.  His father hunts  and <br/>
has lots of guns in the house.  Jake has grown up hunting and shooting  target <br/>
whenever he was with his dad.  I would often reiterate  about gun safety with <br/>
him and his brother, and I know their father did,  too.  I was in the Army <br/>
National Guard for 10 years, and I was trained to  shoot rifles and repair all <br/>
kinds of weapons, but I still wouldn&#39;t have one in  my house.  I *never* would <br/>
have guessed that he&#39;d feel like he  &quot;betrayed&quot; me or guilty about buying a gun <br/>
for himself as a married adult  man.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have to say that I felt incredibly honored that he took me into such  <br/>
consideration before making a decision about his very own life, but I didn&#39;t  <br/>
expect it at all.  I would have felt horible if he had considered how  I feel about <br/>
it and then NOT bought the guns because of that.  <br/>
 <br/>
I guess my point is that we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to sink  in with our <br/>
kids.  The choices we make today and the things we  tell them can have long <br/>
lasting effects, and they can be grown before  you know about it.   I say choose <br/>
wisely how strongly to voice your  opinions about your kids&#39; choices.  <br/>

Right. It&#39;s about your opinion and their choices. It&#39;s NOT about  food or <br/>
guns or tv or video games.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the best realizations I have had in my life is that I don&#39;t really <br/>
know anything for sure. I have strong opinions about certain things, but I <br/>
accept that I may be wrong. Even about the ideas that are most dear to me: <br/>
breastfeeding, unschooling, healthy living, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Once I realized this, I also realized I did not have to be absolutely <br/>
certain about something to believe in it, to adopt it and to promote it, <br/>
nor did I have to reject other people&#39;s beliefs if they were different from <br/>
mine. I don&#39;t fight against anything, I only fight for the ideas I feel <br/>
strongly about.<br/>
<br/>
This has been good for unschooling. My children are not me. They will make <br/>
choices I would not make. That&#39;s okay, even if their choices are completely <br/>
opposite to mine.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I could be wrong.<br/>

me.&quot;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who grew up in an apartment up high in Manhatten, just <br/>
himself and one sister, and his very Jewish mother who worked as a nurse.    He <br/>
moved to Arizona to go to college.   He moved there to be as far away as he could <br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
I met him through the SCA and mutual friends.  He was a good fencer, but his <br/>
mom wouldn&#39;t have approved of that sword nonsense.   <br/>
<br/>
He moved to Albuquerque and I hung out with him some.  He used our family as <br/>
a &quot;See mom?  I have respectable friends&quot; when she came to visit.  We went over <br/>
with our cute little children and talked to her about respectable things, and <br/>
bragged her son up to her.<br/>
<br/>
He was finishing a PhD in physics AND on the side for fun, getting a master&#39;s <br/>
degree in early English literature, studying Jacobean theatre mostly.   He <br/>
bought a jeep and he bought a handgun, and used to go with friends to a target <br/>
range.  Never hunting, he didn&#39;t hike so he wouldn&#39;t even have shot a snake.  <br/>
It wasn&#39;t for self defense, even, it was target shooting.<br/>
<br/>
When he went to visit his mom, the receipt fell out of his backpack (&quot;fell <br/>
out of his backpack&quot; is the official pronouncement) and she found it.  Not the <br/>
gun, that was in New Mexico. The receipt for the purchase of a gun.    <br/>
<br/>
He was probably 28 at the time.  She freaked out totally.   Beyond all <br/>
reasonable behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Result?  He married someone from here and moved to Nevada, and if she wants <br/>
to see him she can go to Nevada, knowing he has a jeep (she was also big on <br/>
using public transportation and not owning a vehicle, but she was also a lifelong <br/>
apartment dwelling resident of Manhattan) and a gun.    <br/>
<br/>
Their relationship was built on him doing what she said and being a good <br/>
student.  He was  a surpassingly &quot;good student,&quot; and taught physics for a while <br/>
after he got his PhD and now works for the government.   Being a success, <br/>
though, didn&#39;t earn him any manhood points with her.   Because his mother couldn&#39;t <br/>
control him into his adult life, she has lost him as a companion and confidant. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Karen&#39;s story about her son&#39;s gun is much more positive.<br/>
<br/>
The same principles can apply to religion, politics, hobbies, diet...<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah.  And Jake wasn&#39;t unschooled at all.  He was homeschooled  one year, and <br/>
I was attempting to let him deschool, but he resisted.  He  went back to <br/>
school but I suggested he live with his father nearby to do  it, which helped us <br/>
not mess up the unschooling life we had developed.  <br/>
 <br/>
However, he was *different* when he got back to school.  He saw it as  a <br/>
system to be worked, and work it he did.  Even though he was never  unschooled, he <br/>
has benefitted from the change unschooling made in *me*, and the  years I <br/>
spent putting my authoritarian parenting in the trash can.  As the  oldest, he <br/>
suffered the most, but there are many many things that are different  for him <br/>
now because of unschooling that weren&#39;t even on my radar when he was  little.<br/>

I saw  a<br/>
post that said, well you are letting your child choose<br/>
now, but what  about in the future.  Assuming or<br/>
implying that parent will fail at  unschooling in the<br/>
future. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
No, not assuming a parent will fail at unschooling, but assuming that  a <br/>
parent will fail to allow a child *choice* in the future if she is unwilling  to <br/>
allow *choice* NOW.<br/>
 <br/>
The sooner a child is allowed to chose, the sooner he will make mistakes  <br/>
that will cause him to rethink his earlier choice. Making small decisions  now is <br/>
an easy way to make wiser ones the next time. Making a bad decision with  <br/>
five dollars is really nothing compared to a bad decision with $50,000.<br/>
 <br/>
Too often, parents will make all their children&#39;s decisions FOR them  because <br/>
the parents &quot;know better&quot;. Because the parents have more &quot;life  experiences&quot;. <br/>
But making those mistakes (or making wise decisions the first  <br/>
time----thinking them through to logical consequences) is a HUGE part of the  learning <br/>
experience----and therefore, gained life experiences that the parent  feels so <br/>
adamant about. The child needs his own.<br/>
 <br/>
LET the kid have them! He may surprise you!<br/>
 <br/>
A parent who is controlling NOW with a toddler will have a harder time  <br/>
letting go as the child grows. By teenhood, the child will be tired of being  <br/>
controlled and rebel----or WORSE!----fall right into the rut of allowing others  to <br/>
make all decisions as far as he&#39;s concerned and be unable to logically make  <br/>
*any* decision.<br/>
 <br/>
Assuming a child will make bad choices/decisions is a mainstream/schoolish  <br/>
idea. Many of us have noticed that it&#39;s NOT true. If he&#39;s allowed to think it  <br/>
through, a child will learn quickly what&#39;s best for *him*. Not for you,  <br/>
necessarily; you may have to bite your tongue! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yes.  And the child learns *much* more from doing than from being told <br/>
what to do.<br/>
<br/>
I would estimate that a parental lecture or warning is only about 5% <br/>
effective in creating real learning.  Trying something yourself and <br/>
screwing up or falling down is more than 90% effective in creating new <br/>
understanding and probably different future behavior.<br/>

<br/>
On the other hand, about warnings, the way people come to have faith in <br/>
another person&#39;s advice is that they don&#39;t take it and then they wish they had.  <br/>
Better for a pre-pubescent kid to have REAL faith in parent&#39;s ideas, and <br/>
theories, and advice, than for the parent to wait until a kid is 14 or 15 and in the <br/>
throes of the biological change leading to going out on his own, and THEN give <br/>
them practice making choices.  <br/>
<br/>
As my  kids have been making lots of their own choices since before <br/>
homeschooling was a thought, and they&#39;re 12, 15 and 18 and making really good choices, <br/>
I feel qualified at at least the anecdotal level to say so.<br/>

This reminded me of a conversatation Liam and I had the other day.  My kids<br/>
love to tease me (now that they&#39;re 19 and 16, respectively) about how I may<br/>
have never spanked or grounded them, but I punished them inhumanely,<br/>
nonetheless, by talking them to death.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I kept the discussions short, sweet, to the point -- which was to<br/>
help them learn to talk to one another effectively and to work out the<br/>
problem on their own -- and ALWAYS followed it up directly with a hug and a<br/>
kiss, no matter how mad I might have been when we started (although there<br/>
might have been some quiet, alone time at the begining to allow all parties<br/>
to chill...)  My big thing was to teach the kids how to really listen to one<br/>
another, how to respect each others&#39; perspectives, etc.  We rarely talked<br/>
for longer than five or ten minutes, max, and that was only when they were<br/>
quite a bit older.  I know it just seemd like forever to them.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, that&#39;s their perception, and I can&#39;t convince them otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Well, a couple of months ago, Liam spent the weekend away with friends<br/>
playing D&D.  They were with one of the boys&#39; family at a retreat center of<br/>
some kind, and were more or less stuck with each other for the duration.<br/>
First time they&#39;d tried this.  Sure enough, a disagreement broke out and<br/>
soon two of the boys weren&#39;t speaking to each other.  It was threatening the<br/>
entire weekend, not to mention the continuity of the game.  &lt;gasp&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Liam, he just got around to telling me in this discussion recently, stayed<br/>
out of it as long as he could, then finally intervened and said, &#39;Look, if<br/>
you guys can&#39;t get this settled, why don&#39;t you try something that used to wo<br/>
rk for my sister and me.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Yep, you guessed it.  He put them in separate places until they&#39;d each<br/>
calmed down, then called them together and helped them to listen to one<br/>
another, speaking calmly, and behaving respectfully to one another.  The<br/>
spat was settled quickly, and they enjoyed the rest of the weekend with no<br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
I punched Liam in the arm when he told me this story.  The little rat.  And<br/>
I thought he hadn&#39;t been paying attention all those years.  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
