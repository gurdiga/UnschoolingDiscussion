&lt;&lt; Peer pressure carries a LOT of weight with kids.  That&#39;s another thing to <br/>
be grateful for home/unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son Marty has a friend who was in school until earlier this year.  He had <br/>
been homeschooled in third grade, then gone back to school, and mid-year his <br/>
mom took him out again.  He&#39;s 14 now, so maybe 8th grade (give or take a <br/>
year).  <br/>
<br/>
When he was in school, he would come over here with black nail polish, his <br/>
hair some color or another, freakish clothes, shocking t-shirts (all <br/>
expensive), etc.  He HAD to be noticed, in public.  He HAD to do something <br/>
worthy of scorn or irritation or comment.<br/>
<br/>
He never influenced my boys to want to be that way.  If anything, it <br/>
reassured them that school was a bad influence on people who needed attention.<br/>
<br/>
Once he started homeschooling, he dropped most of the weirdness totally.  <br/>
Because the group he was trying to impress and live in now was homeschoolers <br/>
who were NOT impressed with money spent to stand out, nor with <br/>
self-agrrandizing stunts.   And so although he&#39;s still interested in fashion, <br/>
he&#39;s buying plainer, higher-quality things instead of garish shock-stuff.  <br/>
And he doesn&#39;t always have to be the center of attention when he&#39;s with these <br/>
kids.   They wouldn&#39;t let him be, and unlike the kids at school, these guys <br/>
don&#39;t HAVE to hang out with him.   So he changed!<br/>

&lt;&lt;   My point exactly.  The influence of home life will override the negative <br/>
influence.  BUT if your children were exposed to 8 hrs per day, 5 days a week <br/>
(or more, depending on what they&#39;re involved in in PS)of the kind of peer <br/>
pressure they would be subjected to in PS , would they still react the same <br/>
as now??  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH no. <br/>
I was agreeing with you.<br/>
<br/>
The benefit of making decisions based on what THEY really like instead of <br/>
what will impress the ever-changing mutitudes is a big advantage to <br/>
unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying &quot;unschooling&quot; instead of &quot;homeschooling,&quot; because there are some <br/>
pretty regimented homeschoolers whose clothing options are limited for <br/>
cultural and religious reasons, and there are inter-group pressures for some <br/>
of those kids too.<br/>

That&#39;s what I was refering to.  IF my child was exposed to it I don&#39;t think that he would think the way he does NOW, because his thinking is GREATLY influenced by how he lives at home and by how we as a famnily live daily.  We spend 24 hrs a day together (give or take a few now and then) and that has a GREAT deal to do with how he thinks.  AGREE?? <br/>
   I hope this doesn&#39;t sound like I have no confidence in my son, I&#39;m just being realistic.  I&#39;ve seen children (whom I thought were so solid in their values), change drastically because of PS influence.<br/>
  Hey, I&#39;m just thankful daily that we are at home. Learning up a storm!!!  I don&#39;t intend to find out what PS would or would not do to or for us!<br/>
  Betty- Happy at home, yes, Mary, life is GOOD!!!<br/>
