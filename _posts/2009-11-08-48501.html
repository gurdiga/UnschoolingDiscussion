So Jayn and I were watching tv together yesterday, when one of those community service announcements came on encouraging parents to talk to their children about electrical safety in the home, mentioning a couple of dangers.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn and I have never had that kind of talk, although various electrical safety things have come up in passing in the course of activities (like pretty much everything!), but I somewhat lightly asked Jayn if she knew what the ad was talking about. <br/>
<br/>
Her answer (with only a small eye roll), &quot;Of course I know that Mom. I watch Family Guy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For those unfamiliar with the show, you would think that the satire Family Guy would be the last place to learn about electrical safety in the home, but Jayn was able to rattle off a bunch of episodes where Peter was doing something so monumentally stupid and unsafe (because he&#39;s a comic idiot) that Jayn learnt to do the opposite - like the time he was babysitting the kids in the bath and gave them a boom box plugged in to listen to and then left. Keeping electronics away from the bath was one of the specific safety issues in the community service ad.<br/>

<br/>
That is why I have been able to assume the veracity of the people on this list and some others whom talked about trusting children to draw what they &#39;&#39;need&#39;&#39; from a show they like.<br/>
Their comprehension in very complete.My three year old only gets into simple shows like Spot partly because she is pulling some suggestions of how the dog moves and talks, and also bacause some of those very simple adventures she has experienced herself or would like to experience (like the picnic and the hiding). While other muppet shows bore her because their adventures are less interesting to her. Too &#39;&#39;educational&#39;&#39; not because she is too young to understand but because she does not care about where they are at.<br/>

<br/>
Margaux has been on a tv marathon lately.  She&#39;s watched every episode of Xena, the Warrior Princess, That&#39;s So Raven, a huge amount of Legend of the Seeker, more than a few Arthur episodes, dozens of movies, Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew tv series from the 70&#39;s, and now we are all working on 30 Rock, and when we get bored and need a stand by, it&#39;s South Park.<br/>
<br/>
Every show has something of value that she learns from.  Yesterday we had a conversation about the Hardy Boys and how they were hotties from the 70&#39;s.  Margaux was just beside herself with trying to wrap her head around the fact that they were hotties.  She figured out the formula pretty early on, Joe gets the cute girl in the show, always the blonde one, and Frank is more likely to help the old lady, but sometimes he gets a cute brunette.  Her dad added to the conversation by telling her that those guys were on a lot of magazine covers, just like the Jonas Brothers.<br/>
<br/>
It was a small bit of history of pop culture, that replicates itself.  She&#39;s paying attention to all of it, every bit of social and pop culture.  Prior to that, when she was on the Xena marathon, she was learning a ton of mythology.  And just now on 30 Rock they made reference to a bar drink called the Nancy Drew for girls and Hardy Boys for guys, which she smiled and laughed at.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568455552">We recently adopted a kitten for Annalise.  She&#39;s friendly and thriving, but she&#39;s snotty...really snotty.  Annalise heard about a cat with swine flu, and theorizes that&#39;s what Thumbelina has, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I started to talk with them about immunity, and Jeremiah did that exact eye-roll, and said &quot;Iknow, Mom...and told usabout immunity, antibodies, that there is a shot, that there are lots of kinds of flu... he DID know!<br/>
<br/>
And when I opened my mouth, he  said, &quot;From Sid the Science Kid!&quot; a la Radar O&#39;Reilly, before I could get a word out.<br/>

That was just after all the discussion of Elvis songs and alien social workers during Lilo and Stitch, and just before Frank Sinatra Jr. on Family Guy...<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t regretted the choice to -at long last- get cable for even a second!  And I am wondering why I ever wanted to control what and how often they watched....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182102181">Jayn watches a lot of tv in bed, but I sleep with earplugs anyway, and dh <br/>
likes some background sound to sleep also. She is usually watching tv <br/>
because she is *not* ready to sleep but I am. It works for us because I get <br/>
to sleep that way. It wouldn&#39;t work if I were being kept awake, as seems to <br/>
be happening at Valentine&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the routine you had before with the reading and falling <br/>
asleep in five minutes was really nice and worked very well. He has a lot of <br/>
choices about watching tv and still gets the most important thing - some <br/>
close time with Mommy before gently going to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
This process made going to bed with Mommy really special and nice.<br/>
<br/>
Was he complaining that he wanted to watch more TV, or did you fix something <br/>
that wasn&#39;t broken?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not necessarily good to impose freedom on the household if the result <br/>
is discarding things that are peaceful and nice.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other night, it may have been that he was having so much fun with <br/>
the playing that he was using tv as a tool to stay awake and have more (I do <br/>
that too.) I would work on bringing the play energy down gradually starting <br/>
a little earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has written a lot about winding down the atmosphere in the living <br/>
room, with cosy blankets and such.<br/>
