<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child to pick it up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps the role model for introductions, but not the role model for <br/>
saying thank you to compliments, nor the role model for looking at <br/>
the person I&#39;m speaking to, nor the role model for shaking hands and <br/>
congratulating the Honoree. Introductions? I&#39;m pretty clueless (which <br/>
also gives me some empathy for my son&#39;s cluelessness...because I have <br/>
my moments, too) But simple, polite give-and-take? THAT, I do okay <br/>
with. My 15 yo and my 8 yo girls do this well, too. But the boys? LOL <br/>
urg.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, as a little girl, I was forced to introduce my friends, even <br/>
though I felt stupid and foolish and awkward doing so. It didn&#39;t help <br/>
me &quot;know&quot; to do it. But then again, my mom and I never had a Faux Pas <br/>
Party to &quot;practice&quot; such things. Hmmm, I also saw my mother modeling <br/>
this proper social behavior ALL the time: at church, at receptions, <br/>
parties, social gatherings of all kinds. And I never learned it. She <br/>
introduced me to many people, and I never picked up on it. <br/>
<br/>
What about that? Why would the consistently modeled, outgoing and <br/>
socially adept &quot;style&quot; of a mother, not get picked up by the child? <br/>
My dad is much more introverted than my mom...and I take after him <br/>
more than I do my mom, in more than just social style. For instance, <br/>
clutter gets on my nerves, which is more like my dad than my mom. So, <br/>
some of my son&#39;s Social Cluelessness may just be that he has parents <br/>
that lean that way. <br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean he shouldn&#39;t know about polite give-and-take.<br/>
<br/>

after him Introversion-wise...IOW, I learned &quot;through osmosis&quot; what <br/>
both parents were modeling. But I take after my retreating dad not my <br/>
outgoing mom, and so in social interactions I retain some <br/>
cluelessness. <br/>

&lt;&lt; As conference coordinator---for one weekend---I&#39;ll be the &quot;ranking guy&quot;. <br/>
But <br/>
I will defer to my illustrious speakers, who (I feel) out-rank me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the &quot;honored guest&quot; status.<br/>
As a speaker, though, I wouldn&#39;t want to do anything the coordinator/hostess <br/>
did NOT want me to do, because it&#39;s her &quot;house,&quot; and I&#39;m a guest.<br/>
<br/>
When I was thinking about the relative rank, I had a picture of the pope in a <br/>
traffic accident, and EMTs have come. If I&#39;m there and I&#39;m mobile and <br/>
involved, do I introduce the EMT to the Pope?  &lt;g&gt;  Depends if the Pope&#39;s conscious.  <br/>
EMTs tend to introduce themselves.  And should I identify the unconcious Pope <br/>
for them?  I think they&#39;ll figure it out &#39;cause he dresses distinctively.<br/>
<br/>
All these things are &quot;it depends,&quot; and all these things involve the intent <br/>
and purpose of the person making the decisions too.  Sometimes people WANT to <br/>
make a social point by breaking the rules.  Sometimes that works out well for <br/>
them.  Sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  Sometimes &quot;working out well&quot; means they get fired, <br/>
arrested, or make the paper as a troublemaker.<br/>

<br/>
I think this is evidence of Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligences model.<br/>
<br/>
Someone (here?  on on the forum, I think--not here) wrote yesterday or so <br/>
that kids who aren&#39;t good at social interactions (might have been in an <br/>
Asperger&#39;s discussion) could learn them the way the rest of us learn to play piano.  <br/>
(NOT a quote, and might even miss essence.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought WHAT!?  Some people walk up to a piano and figure it out and just <br/>
play songs.  Others, with lessons for years, can&#39;t do anything EXCEPT follow <br/>
the dots on the paper, with no musicality, no feel for it, purely mechanical.   <br/>
<br/>
And while pure mechanics is better than nothing, it&#39;s not how everyone learns <br/>
manners or piano.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s not big in the interpersonal, intrapersonal, they&#39;re not going <br/>
to be paying attention to how their mom introduces people.  Those who ARE will <br/>
notice who she addresses first, and what kind of information she offers.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who&#39;s not very musically talented can be in a house full of music, <br/>
musicians, live music and lessons all around them and STILL never harmonize by <br/>
ear.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading about Martha Stewart this morning, when I first woke up, and TV <br/>
was previewing something about Jack LaLanne.<br/>
<br/>
I thought  WOW!!!   <br/>
And I don&#39;t want to say what all I next thought. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Martha Stewart can&#39;t teach people how to be her.  She can show them her <br/>
thought processes and sell them some pillow cases and mixing bowls, but if they <br/>
don&#39;t have the talent already, it won&#39;t really help.  (Those are talents I don&#39;t <br/>
have, so I know.)<br/>
<br/>
Jack LaLanne is a happy freak of nature who could have been a circus <br/>
strongman if television hadn&#39;t given him a medium and an outlet.  YES people can do <br/>
those exercises and eat right, but they can&#39;t be Jack LaLanne, not a single one <br/>
of them.   Most of what he has is genetics, physical and tempermental both.<br/>
<br/>
But this is interesting:  An interview in &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; magazine:<br/>
<br/>
Although an interview with Jack LaLanne about enlightenment and its <br/>
relationship to self-mastery may seem incongruous to some, the remarkable thing about <br/>
this extraordinary man is that he may indeed embody many of the unusual <br/>
qualities of those throughout history who are presumed to have been enlightened. <br/>
Although he had no concept of what is usually meant by the word &quot;enlightenment,&quot; <br/>
and always reduced the solution to every human problem to his perennial <br/>
prescription of diet and exercise, his ferocious and unwavering single-pointedness of <br/>
mind seems to have produced in him that one human quality that speaks louder <br/>
than a thousand wordsjoy! A true yogi in the classical sense of the word, Jack <br/>
LaLanne might have impressed even Patanjali as a rare example of <br/>
concentration, self-discipline, and integrity. Renunciation and self-control, the pillars <br/>
of any real practice of yoga, are Jack&#39;s intimate friends, and while he <br/>
appeared to be at a loss whenever asked about spiritual depth, lightness of being <br/>
seems to be his natural state. So, is Jack LaLanne enlightened?&quot;<br/>

walks up to The Piano of Social Interaction and just starts playing. <br/>
A natural, so to speak, with charm, looks, grace, wit. Everything for <br/>
a very good First Impression. And where DID he get it, for his dad <br/>
(my ex) isn&#39;t a super dooper socializer, either.<br/>
<br/>
so, what to do? Some of my kids are adept at social interactions; <br/>
some are not. Is it intruding on who &quot;they&quot; are, to remind them to <br/>
look at people when they talk to you? Or say &quot;thanks&quot; when given a <br/>
compliment? I&#39;m thinking, some rudiments of manners is not out of <br/>
order. If someone with no music in em doesn&#39;t learn to play piano, it <br/>
isn&#39;t going to do him any harm in life. But someone with low social <br/>
ability could be hampered. I think. The scientist someone <br/>
mentioned ... hmm.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also having some thoughts about the rest of the post (Jack <br/>
LaLanne) but not ready to do anything with them, yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718781582">I have to remind myself alllll the time that children must solve their own frustrations and I have to help, maybe, but mostly accept their solutions (within a broad interpretation of &quot;reasonable&quot; behavior).<br/>
<br/>
In this case, what if your ds decided never to be social.  He would sometimes be frustrated.  For example, let&#39;s say he lived with the &quot;shortcoming&quot; until he was 21. Then got so frustrated that it was unbearable.  THEN he is open to &quot;how to shake hands&quot; or &quot;how to play nice.&quot; At least then he knows that Mom is there to be his first source of contact for that learning (not some mal-adjusted post-teen like the ones I relied on &#39;cause Mom and Dad we dictators and I wasn&#39;t going there!).  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
say a person could be trained to correct responses in social <br/>
<br/>
interactions, even if they never did &quot;get it&quot;? ie show a real talent <br/>
<br/>
for it?<br/>
<br/>

But not all pianists learned the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, an internal set of options and canned speeches can be developed within a <br/>
child.  Not inserted by someone else, but developed by him if he wants to <br/>
learn them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Is it intruding on who &quot;they&quot; are, to remind them to <br/>
<br/>
look at people when they talk to you? Or say &quot;thanks&quot; when given a <br/>
<br/>
compliment? I&#39;m thinking, some rudiments of manners is not out of <br/>
<br/>
order.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If someone with no music in em doesn&#39;t learn to play piano, it <br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t going to do him any harm in life. But someone with low social <br/>
<br/>
ability could be hampered. I think. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True.  Piano playing isn&#39;t required to get a job or seal a deal, but knowing <br/>
how and when to shake hands IS pretty important.<br/>

Hi Tim thanks for your &quot;thots&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking, too, ever since posting that bit about my <br/>
charming, socially intelligent oldest boy. My oldest boy is <br/>
connected; my youngest boy is not, as much. It isn&#39;t about Robby <br/>
being rude. It&#39;s about his being an introvert and not coming <br/>
naturally to social niceties. It&#39;s still something that would stand <br/>
him in good stead, to know some of these things. But I also think he <br/>
might be &quot;reading&quot; my friend more than I realize. At gramma&#39;s, there <br/>
could be an element of &quot;tut-tut, isn&#39;t he going to say hello even?&quot; <br/>
which could also bring about the retreat mode...hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
He isn&#39;t just automatically charming, and so my friend isn&#39;t charmed, <br/>
and that comes across, even though she has never said so to him. <br/>
Never been anything but polite and kind to him, gave him a big, <br/>
cheerful hug and lots of encouragement about his running when we were <br/>
there, but...if she is translating his awkwardness to rudeness, and <br/>
he&#39;s picking that up, it might just prove to be a situation that <br/>
causes him to shut down, thus exacerbating the awkwardness. <br/>

your heels up, just in time&quot; LOL ;) (which is how I used to sing it <br/>
