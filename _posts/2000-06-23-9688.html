<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646456940">Dill pickles<br/>
<br/>
5 cups water (preferably non chlorinated bottled water )<br/>
1/2 cup cider vinegar<br/>
1/4 cup pickling/kosher or sea salt<br/>
1 tablespoon brown sugar<br/>
8 grape leaves (optional I&#39;ve never used them )<br/>
2 quarts small cucumbers ( I&#39;ve used large ones sliced )<br/>
8 heads and stems of fresh dill<br/>
2 cloves of garlic crushed ( I put one clove in each jar )<br/>
2 tsp. horseradish (1/2 tsp. for each jar )<br/>
2 tsp. mustard seeds (1/2 tsp. for each jar )<br/>
<br/>
Have 4 quart jars and their lids sterilized ready to go.<br/>
Wash all the cucumbers and cut lengthways in half (or quarters if large<br/>
)<br/>
<br/>
make a brine of the water, vinegar, salt, sugar by boiling them together<br/>
.. keep hot.<br/>
<br/>
Line jar with grape leaves if using them.<br/>
Place  mustard seed, garlic and horseradish in the bottom of the jars<br/>
and fill jars with cucumbers leaving room for 2 heads of dill in each<br/>
jar. I crush up the dill into a compact ball so I can get more cucumbers<br/>
in ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Bring brine back to the boil.<br/>
Pour hot boiling brine over the cucumbers and seal immediately ( I have<br/>
hot water bathed mine for 10 minutes but it makes the pickles softer ...<br/>
use your own judgement but just sealing them right away has never given<br/>
me a bad/spoiled jar of pickles).<br/>
<br/>
Put away in a dark place for 5-6 weeks before indulging.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done 36 quarts in an afternoon on my own. Now with the MS I have to<br/>
conscript some help ;-)<br/>
