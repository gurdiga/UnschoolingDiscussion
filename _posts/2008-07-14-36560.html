<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183306663">I have an article that I need to submit in about... 7 hours but I need a  bit <br/>
of help with editing. It&#39;s too wordy, I need some punctuation help and just  <br/>
general input. I&#39;m heading out for a couple hours, but will be back in about 4 <br/>
 hours. Please let me know if you are willing and able to help. <br/>
