With my own kids, I&#39;ve always preferred using the sling for the toddler<br/>
years. I always have my sling with me, and when in a parking lot or near a<br/>
dangerous street, I put my toddler into the sling and carry her until it is<br/>
safe for her to get down and walk or run again. She can nurse in the sling<br/>
and it is a comforting thing for her. The sling is small and fits easily<br/>
into a backpack or gets thrown into the shopping cart, stroller, or bike<br/>
trailer when I&#39;m not using it. My son wasn&#39;t as big of a fan of the sling,<br/>
and he hated having his hand held. He always had the option of holding<br/>
hands, but if he didn&#39;t want to I would just pick him up (even if<br/>
struggling) and carry him until it was safe. This was a very difficult thing<br/>
for him for awhile, so we tried to get creative and get errands taken care<br/>
of without having to put him into that situation. As with all other phases,<br/>
this one passed and now he loves to go shopping with me and hold my hand.<br/>
<br/>
There are always options, other than violence (and yes, I define hitting a<br/>

lesson&quot;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549207460">I also used a sling, but I think the main thing that made her listen <br/>
to me about danger was that we did not have a plethora of rules. She <br/>
had one rule to follow... Do not hurt yourself or anyone else. <br/>
Without all of the rules to clutter our lives, when I told her about <br/>
cars or any other danger, she listened and respected what I was <br/>
saying. We stood on the sidewalk, me kneeling beside her. I told <br/>
her, &quot;Watch how fast the cars go.&quot; I then pointed out a small branch <br/>
on the road and told her to watch and see if the car hit it, and see <br/>
what happens to the branch if it gets hit. We watched and it happened <br/>
and her eyes got big and she said, &quot;I&#39;m staying on the sidewalk and <br/>
holding your hand Mommy.&quot;  She wasn&#39;t two years old yet.  I did what <br/>
Robin did. Laurie was my priority and thus her safety was too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643127153">I would never smack my child for being in danger, (running in front <br/>
of a car). I did, at the begining occasional smack for being <br/>
naughty.  A very light smack on the butt.  I soon learned that this <br/>
was not the thing to do.  I hate physical violence of any kind. So I <br/>
learned to communicate with my children about what was and was not <br/>
accepted. It worked most of the times.  (Would smacking  work ALL of <br/>
the time?)<br/>

one of those words. The GOD I know is a loving forgiving GOD.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134897992">Thank you, Lynda.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to judge other people when you don&#39;t have to<br/>
live with the consequences of their following the<br/>
dictates of your *personal* opinions, and when you<br/>
don&#39;t know the individual peculiarities of their<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
Sweeping generalities, like &quot;there is NEVER any excuse<br/>
for hitting a child&quot;, don&#39;t take into account the fact<br/>
that children are not little generalities.  They are<br/>
highly individual and unique, and so are their needs. <br/>
You cannot look at a parent and child on the street<br/>
and in five seconds (or minutes) pass a reasonable<br/>
judgment on how that child should be raised or<br/>
educated or disciplined or loved.  The same type of<br/>
sweeping generality, for instance, would be that all<br/>
children benefit from breast feeding in their infancy,<br/>
or that all children should be held by their parents<br/>
as much as possible, or that all children should be<br/>
raised by both a mother and a father.  But there are<br/>
children who for one reason or another would be<br/>
harmed, even seriously endangered, were they and their<br/>
parents held to those standards.<br/>
<br/>
Our experience with hitting, for instance, follows. <br/>
Delete here if you aren&#39;t interested... it&#39;s a tad<br/>
long, because our situation is complex.  Which is the<br/>
point.  <br/>
<br/>
My son has Aspergers Syndrome and ADHD, and could run<br/>
like the wind at 10 months old.  I am physically<br/>
challenged, which he took advantage of during<br/>
&#39;transitions&#39;, such as when I took him out of his<br/>
carseat or walked out a door (and believe me, there<br/>
wasn&#39;t a stroller or harness that has been designed<br/>
that could hold him for more than two seconds if he<br/>
wanted to escape... we tried *dozens*).  The first<br/>
thing he&#39;d do is squirm away and run directly in front<br/>
of any moving vehicle available.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people, perhaps, could stay isolated inside for<br/>
two or three years in order to avoid ever risking that<br/>
situation, but I didn&#39;t have that option. I had to go<br/>
to the bank, grocery store, doctors&#39; offices, park,<br/>
etc, and those places are in parking lots or on<br/>
streets... usually busy ones.  <br/>
 <br/>
Our son wasn&#39;t interested in cars or in streets; he<br/>
wasn&#39;t running to them out of curiosity or impulsive<br/>
experimental zeal.  He never ran out into a quiet<br/>
street...  that wasn&#39;t fun.  It wasn&#39;t the street he<br/>
was interested in.  It was my reaction to his danger<br/>
that he was going for.  He didn&#39;t understand the<br/>
feeling behind my terrorized expression; he just<br/>
thought that the faces and voice I used were *funny*,<br/>
and enjoyed being chased and swooped up; he&#39;d figured<br/>
out that running in front of moving vehicles would<br/>
guarantee those reactions.<br/>
<br/>
The problem being that a 10 month old child the size<br/>
of a doll(and a small one, at that... he had growth<br/>
retardation) is not a size that is easily seen by a<br/>
driver going through a parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
And a 10 month old, particularly one with ADHD *and*<br/>
on the autistic spectrum, is not going to understand a<br/>
lesson, or fifty, in cause and effect... especially an<br/>
abstract one.  He could not cognitively connect a<br/>
squished traffic cone or doll to a squished him. <br/>
{There is a reason his first word was &quot;Hot!&quot;}  I tried<br/>
all sorts of gentle options before resorting to that<br/>
swat on the bottom.  He found being &#39;gently led&#39; to be<br/>
*torture*; he felt caged and hated being held or<br/>
touched for any length of time, and he didn&#39;t connect<br/>
that torture to the escape behavior, so it wasn&#39;t<br/>
effective in any case.  <br/>
<br/>
One swat on the diapered bottom was less traumatic,<br/>
for him, than many of the &#39;gentler&#39; options I&#39;ve seen<br/>
suggested on this list (most of which we tried before<br/>
that in any case... *I* didn&#39;t want to hit my child,<br/>
and only did so when nothing else worked); I<br/>
understand my kid better than anyone else in the<br/>
world, and I am absolutely sure of that.  In the end<br/>
it came to this... give him one immediate negative<br/>
consequence that he would connect to the deed, or end<br/>
up with a dead child.  <br/>
If the choice is (by the definition of a lot of posts<br/>
onlist) a mildly traumatized child or a severely<br/>
injured or dead one, I am okay with the one that cried<br/>
for five seconds and then didn&#39;t run out in front of<br/>
cars any more.<br/>
<br/>
And my autistic spectrum child is more affectionate,<br/>
sunny, connected, open and trusting of me than most of<br/>
his &#39;normal&#39; companions are with their parents... the<br/>
only anxiety and &#39;damaged&#39; behavior he exhibits takes<br/>
place during the school year and is clearly connected<br/>
with that.  *Schooling* him is the only abuse I am<br/>
guilty of inflicting on him, and that I did<br/>
unknowingly... and am taking the steps I can to<br/>
rectify the situation asap!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t smack my child for being in danger.  That<br/>
would be ineffective, and stupid as well IMO.  It is<br/>
also totally ineffective to sit down and try to reason<br/>
with a ten month old child, expecting that he will<br/>
understand and agree with you that he should give up a<br/>
fun activity because of your abstract reasoning.  I<br/>
swatted his bottom once to make him see that there was<br/>
an an immediate and unpleasant consequence to the<br/>
repeated choice he was making that put his life at<br/>
terrible risk.  He had, until then, refused to see<br/>
that I was *serious*... the swat let him know that I<br/>
was *very* serious.  <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that the swat hurt... he was well diapered,<br/>
and he had reacted to firmer and more numerous swats<br/>
in the same area when we played &#39;baby drums&#39; with<br/>
roars of laughter.  It was the shock of the timing and<br/>
the tone of my voice that made him sit for a moment<br/>
and roar with indignation... because I had never<br/>
touched him in anything but a playful or cuddly manner<br/>
before, and it was a very unpleasant surprise.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t enjoy it, and neither did he, but it saved us<br/>
both from much worse possibilities in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
Every child is different, of course, and other mothers<br/>
may find other tactics more effective.  I would<br/>
encourage them to try less unpleasant methods of<br/>
instruction first, as I did.<br/>

<br/>
You are speaking of *your* child.  She was older.  She<br/>
was not (as far as I can tell from your description<br/>
and her posts) neurologically challenged.  My child at<br/>
eleven years old *still* has trouble making<br/>
cause-and-effect connections, even though he has a<br/>
high IQ... at ten months old it was not within his<br/>
cognitive capabilities.  He was still at the stage<br/>
where he&#39;d walk off a table ledge or launch himself<br/>
from the top of the stairs if the opportunity<br/>
presented itself because he didn&#39;t realize that<br/>
landing would *hurt*.<br/>
He wouldn&#39;t look at anyone&#39;s face, much less look<br/>
somewhere you pointed.  What he *could* do, at ten<br/>
months, is climb like a monkey and run like a<br/>
squirrel.<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying that spanking or swatting is<br/>
desirable, I am not saying that it is the best option,<br/>
I am not saying that everyone should do it or that<br/>
most people should do it, or that *anyone* should<br/>
choose that as an easy method of childrearing.  I am<br/>
saying that sometimes it is the lesser of two or more<br/>
evils, and sometimes the only effective option<br/>
*certain parents* of *certain children* have available<br/>
at *certain times*.  And that people should not<br/>
generalize from their own experience... your<br/>
experience with your child just will never apply to my<br/>
child in all areas, because she is a completely<br/>
different person than mine is, her personality and<br/>
learning style (and learning curve) is completely<br/>
different.  And I cannot use my experience with my<br/>
child to judge what another parent should do with<br/>
theirs. <br/>
<br/>
Not that I *don&#39;t* judge, mind you.  I&#39;m not perfect,<br/>
so I do.  But I&#39;m wrong when I do that.  Probably.  ;)<br/>

What I wrote had nothing to do with your post.  I am sorry if it <br/>
sounded that way. I was just making a statement.<br/>
As I said I have smacked my children. <br/>
I also bit my son once - I posted this on another board just last <br/>
week. I am sure you are all sat there going &quot;What!!&quot;<br/>
My 2 yr old son bit his baby brother on the arm. I immediatly bit my <br/>
sons arm. I wanted him to know how this hurt  his baby brother.  he <br/>
never bite again.  Low and behold the baby was 2 yrs old when he did <br/>
the same to the new baby.  I bit him on his arm too - and he never <br/>
bit again.......  I, like you, did what I thought would hit home<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178848496">Ah!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going &quot;What?!&quot; at all; I&#39;m not proud of it,<br/>
but I did the biting thing with my son, too.  He bit<br/>
me several times a day for months, and would actually<br/>
draw blood... he bit *hard*, and then he&#39;d laugh<br/>
hysterically if I reacted at all.  He was trying to<br/>
get a reaction, so if I *didn&#39;t* react, he bit<br/>
*harder*.  We tried tobasco sauce and sour apple and<br/>
everything, it didn&#39;t work... I even tried keeping the<br/>
bitten area forced into his jaws, trying to make it<br/>
uncomfortable.  Nope, no good.  He started biting his<br/>
grandmother and smaller cousins.  Hard.  His<br/>
outrageously doting grandmother started fearing that<br/>
there was something seriously wrong with him... he<br/>
really got an extremely evil grin on his face.<br/>
<br/>
I finally, in desperation and in spite of my own<br/>
beliefs about it, bit him back.  He didn&#39;t seem upset<br/>
in the least, or even surprised, but he did stop<br/>
biting. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it took a while before I could get him<br/>
to stop coming up to me and trying to force his finger<br/>
between *my* teeth!   Maybe that&#39;s what he was wanting<br/>
all along, was for *me* to bite *him*?<br/>

posts on this subject. We all draw lines in the sand - I&#39;m sure if I said it<br/>
was necessary for me to pour boiling water on my child&#39;s hand to teach him<br/>
about &quot;hot&quot; that no-one here would be saying &quot;Well, each child is an<br/>
individual, and that might be necessary to get through to some&quot;. There would<br/>
be a line being crossed there that was absolutely unacceptable and I doubt<br/>
anyone would apologize for drawing that particular line. The question is,<br/>
where is each person&#39;s line in the sand drawn? If you draw your line at &quot;no<br/>
violence, never hitting a child&quot; then you will be as creative as you need to<br/>
be to avoid doing that. So at this point it becomes a matter of opinion and<br/>
of where each person draws their line, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to<br/>
argue that there aren&#39;t lines to be drawn at all. It is possible to<br/>
understand that some folks feel that a small amount of violence is not<br/>
harmful to their kids. It is also possible to understand that others feel<br/>
quite strongly that any amount of violence is too much for any child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691559889">Okay, this is my last say on the matter, because after<br/>
this post I am probably going to leave the list. <br/>
Stress effects my condition (see parallel post &quot;My<br/>
Moccasins&quot;), and getting comments from strangers who<br/>
tell me that as a non-violent alternative to a mild<br/>
swat on a protected bottom I should throw cold water<br/>
in the face of a ten month old autistic child is<br/>
stressing me out.  It *hurts* to bite my tongue that<br/>
hard.<br/>
<br/>
What is difficult for me to understand is that so many<br/>
people on this *particular* list feel perfectly<br/>
comfortable in telling others where the line should be<br/>
drawn, and that any other than *their* line is wrong,<br/>
abusive, that it will permanently damage our<br/>
children... not that it could possibly do so, or<br/>
potentially do so, but that it *will*.  Robin, at<br/>
least, is TRYING to be fair and impartial.  Sort of.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is possible to<br/>

&gt; understand that others feel<br/>
&gt; quite strongly that any amount of violence is too<br/>
&gt; much for any child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My, my...  What an unusual, and apparantly<br/>
irresistable, position for homeschoolers to be in. <br/>
You have managed to become a Moral Majority!  The<br/>
decision to &quot;draw your line at &#39;no violence, never<br/>
hitting a child&#39;&quot; is held up as the gold standard<br/>
which should not be set aside for any reason, even if<br/>
the &#39;creative&#39; lengths to which one must go in order<br/>
to avoid doing so are effectively more abusive and<br/>
damaging to the psyche of a particular child than the<br/>
hitting itself.  The theory, in effect, becomes more<br/>
important than the child.  <br/>
<br/>
And who can blame you for taking such a seemingly<br/>
reasonable position?  To do otherwise, after all,<br/>
would be to take the icky position that it is okay to<br/>
do violence to your child.  THAT wouldn&#39;t be... well,<br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be nice.  It wouldn&#39;t be morally<br/>
unassailable.  It wouldn&#39;t be Superior.  It would<br/>
leave room for self-doubt and discomfort and even<br/>
pain.<br/>
<br/>
By your framing of the argument, you would have me<br/>
taking the position that a small amount of violence is<br/>
not harmful to my, or any, child.  That is not a<br/>
position that I could, or would ever wish to, defend.<br/>
My position, my experience, my observation, is that a<br/>
small amount of violence is unavoidable in many...<br/>
probably most... children&#39;s lives, and that most<br/>
parents have to make a choice between one kind and<br/>
another on occasion.  We are forced by circumstances<br/>
beyond our control to estimate the potential level of<br/>
violence and/or damage inherent in each option and<br/>
choose the one that, to the best they can measure,<br/>
will do the least damage or can most reasonably be<br/>
mitigated. <br/>
<br/>
Most of you have done so already.  You have assessed<br/>
the risks in either immunizing or not immunizing your<br/>
children; if your risk pays off, you go on your way<br/>
happy and carefree... but if you assessed incorrectly,<br/>
you have done irreparable harm to your children and<br/>
possibly to your community. <br/>
<br/>
If you chose to immunize your child, that needle was<br/>
far more violent than my swat of my son&#39;s bottom...<br/>
few of us whose child has been stuck with a big ol&#39;<br/>
needle can claim that we are ignorant of the vast<br/>
sense of betrayal and personal offense our children<br/>
feel at that moment.  It is projected directly at you,<br/>
in great big (loud!) Offront Waves.  You chose to do<br/>
violence to your child because your assessment of the<br/>
situation led you to believe that it was a *smaller*<br/>
and mitigatable damage compared to the possible<br/>
alternative.  But what if your child later is<br/>
diagnosed with a neurological disorder... will you<br/>
ever be sure that that small violence didn&#39;t have far<br/>
reaching consequences? <br/>
<br/>
Ah, perhaps you chose not to immunize!  You were able<br/>
to virtuously avoid that small violence *and* avoid<br/>
the whiff of insidious long-term damage that seems to<br/>
be floating into connection with the immunizations. <br/>
THAT is definitely the Right choice.<br/>
<br/>
But what if they get the disease because they were<br/>
left unprotected?  What if they are rendered impotent<br/>
and are never able to have children of their own? <br/>
What if they are left paralyzed or deaf or blind? <br/>
What if they are left unable to speak or recognize us<br/>
or feed themselves, what if they *die*?  I personally<br/>
have seen the last two happen, right here in the<br/>
Metropolitan area in which I live.  What if our<br/>
beloved children, and similarly unimmunized<br/>
compatriots, are responsible for the spreading of a<br/>
devastating epidemic?  What violence have you done<br/>
them and your neighbors, in the name of avoiding the<br/>
smaller violence?  <br/>
<br/>
Can *any* of you guarantee that you haven&#39;t done some<br/>
unknown violence or irreparable damage to your child&#39;s<br/>
future by any action or decision you have made?  Would<br/>
you want a Majority to tell you that you have<br/>
ignorantly and callously played Russian Roulette with<br/>
your child&#39;s life?  Would you feel comfortable in<br/>
saying that very thing to other people on this list<br/>
about the immunization, educational, religious,<br/>
sexual, tv/computer, Ritalin issues, among others?<br/>
<br/>
Probably not.  You are too vulnerable that way.  BUT<br/>
you *are* comfortable in applying an inflexible,<br/>
simplistic and virtuous-sounding generality in judging<br/>
a small minority who are un-PC or independent enough<br/>
to see things differently than the Majority.  You are<br/>
comfortable with applying that one-size-fits-all<br/>
measuring stick for &#39;violence&#39; to all children and<br/>
families, no matter how different *their* experience<br/>
might be from your own.<br/>
<br/>
Must be comfy.<br/>

     Eileen, this will probably be my last post on this issue as well because <br/>
I&#39;m leaving tomorrow for two weeks to see my sister and her twin babies in <br/>
Minnesota.  I apologize again if there is anything I have said that has <br/>
offended you; that was not my intention.  I don&#39;t believe (not positive about <br/>
this) that you were even the one who brought up the spanking issue.  I think <br/>
a couple of people felt that it was a parent&#39;s Biblical obligation to <br/>
physically punish their children and quoted certain scriptures to support <br/>
this view.  I believe that most people initially responded to that.  <br/>
     I have known a lot of people over the years, including many who spanked <br/>
their kids, and it has not been my experience that those spankings were <br/>
unavoidable.  I don&#39;t think those parents are horrible people; some of them <br/>
have been my relatives and friends.  But I believe that in the cases I <br/>
observed, there were better ways.  And I believe there are many ways I have <br/>
been with my kids in the past that could have been so much better.  <br/>
     What you have experienced is much different and much harder than most of <br/>
us will ever have to deal with, as you well know.  You sound like an <br/>
incredibly strong, intelligent, brave person and I appreciate reading all <br/>
that you have shared.  I do hope that you don&#39;t quit the list.  That is the <br/>
problem when things like this come up. Whatever you decide, I wish you and <br/>
your son the best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355568506">Wow  Eileen!!  I have been sitting back reading all of these posts thinking how judgmental and extreeme people can be and wondering how long the posting over spanking wich is a very personal choice would last , as I did with the breast feeding and abortion  threads just reading and skimming deleting and not responding, figuring my opinion really didn&#39;t matter much so why bother speaking,<br/>
however you have said everything I have been thinking and I thank you for it, I did read your last post and am very sorry you have had to endure such tough times.<br/>
I  am a  pro life person but I wouldn&#39;t take someone down for choosing otherwise or engage in a lenthy conversation over it as I would know that it is everyones right to choose what they want to beleive<br/>
I also breast feed, but wouldn&#39;t ever tell someone else they are bad for not breastfeeding their child because each  one of my children got  varied amounts of breastfeeding, while I am enjoying it now, I struggled with it with my older children, but I don&#39;t feel that makes me less of a mother, I have also spanked my children, I get no pleasure from it and don&#39;t feel the need now , but I might again some day each day brings something different into my life and I am with you that it is wrong to tell other people how to live their life<br/>
I also have a daughter who is ADD while I do not promote schools drugging children for compliance, I also do not criticize those who have kids on meds because my life would be a living hell without meds for my daughter!<br/>
so please take compfort in knowing you are not alone in feeling that people are being judgmental and harsh when a touchy subject comes up!<br/>

<br/>
  Okay, this is my last say on the matter, because after<br/>
  this post I am probably going to leave the list. <br/>
  Stress effects my condition (see parallel post &quot;My<br/>
  Moccasins&quot;), and getting comments from strangers who<br/>
  tell me that as a non-violent alternative to a mild<br/>
  swat on a protected bottom I should throw cold water<br/>
  in the face of a ten month old autistic child is<br/>
  stressing me out.  It *hurts* to bite my tongue that<br/>
  hard.<br/>
<br/>
  What is difficult for me to understand is that so many<br/>
  people on this *particular* list feel perfectly<br/>
  comfortable in telling others where the line should be<br/>
  drawn, and that any other than *their* line is wrong,<br/>
  abusive, that it will permanently damage our<br/>
  children... not that it could possibly do so, or<br/>
  potentially do so, but that it *will*.  Robin, at<br/>
  least, is TRYING to be fair and impartial.  Sort of.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;It<br/>
  &gt; is possible to<br/>
  &gt; understand that some folks feel that a small amount<br/>
  &gt; of violence is not<br/>
  &gt; harmful to their kids. It is also possible to<br/>
  &gt; understand that others feel<br/>
  &gt; quite strongly that any amount of violence is too<br/>
  &gt; much for any child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  My, my...  What an unusual, and apparantly<br/>
  irresistable, position for homeschoolers to be in. <br/>
  You have managed to become a Moral Majority!  The<br/>
  decision to &quot;draw your line at &#39;no violence, never<br/>
  hitting a child&#39;&quot; is held up as the gold standard<br/>
  which should not be set aside for any reason, even if<br/>
  the &#39;creative&#39; lengths to which one must go in order<br/>
  to avoid doing so are effectively more abusive and<br/>
  damaging to the psyche of a particular child than the<br/>
  hitting itself.  The theory, in effect, becomes more<br/>
  important than the child.  <br/>
<br/>
  And who can blame you for taking such a seemingly<br/>
  reasonable position?  To do otherwise, after all,<br/>
  would be to take the icky position that it is okay to<br/>
  do violence to your child.  THAT wouldn&#39;t be... well,<br/>
  it wouldn&#39;t be nice.  It wouldn&#39;t be morally<br/>
  unassailable.  It wouldn&#39;t be Superior.  It would<br/>
  leave room for self-doubt and discomfort and even<br/>
  pain.<br/>
<br/>
  By your framing of the argument, you would have me<br/>
  taking the position that a small amount of violence is<br/>
  not harmful to my, or any, child.  That is not a<br/>
  position that I could, or would ever wish to, defend.<br/>
  My position, my experience, my observation, is that a<br/>
  small amount of violence is unavoidable in many...<br/>
  probably most... children&#39;s lives, and that most<br/>
  parents have to make a choice between one kind and<br/>
  another on occasion.  We are forced by circumstances<br/>
  beyond our control to estimate the potential level of<br/>
  violence and/or damage inherent in each option and<br/>
  choose the one that, to the best they can measure,<br/>
  will do the least damage or can most reasonably be<br/>
  mitigated. <br/>
<br/>
  Most of you have done so already.  You have assessed<br/>
  the risks in either immunizing or not immunizing your<br/>
  children; if your risk pays off, you go on your way<br/>
  happy and carefree... but if you assessed incorrectly,<br/>
  you have done irreparable harm to your children and<br/>
  possibly to your community. <br/>
<br/>
  If you chose to immunize your child, that needle was<br/>
  far more violent than my swat of my son&#39;s bottom...<br/>
  few of us whose child has been stuck with a big ol&#39;<br/>
  needle can claim that we are ignorant of the vast<br/>
  sense of betrayal and personal offense our children<br/>
  feel at that moment.  It is projected directly at you,<br/>
  in great big (loud!) Offront Waves.  You chose to do<br/>
  violence to your child because your assessment of the<br/>
  situation led you to believe that it was a *smaller*<br/>
  and mitigatable damage compared to the possible<br/>
  alternative.  But what if your child later is<br/>
  diagnosed with a neurological disorder... will you<br/>
  ever be sure that that small violence didn&#39;t have far<br/>
  reaching consequences? <br/>
<br/>
  Ah, perhaps you chose not to immunize!  You were able<br/>
  to virtuously avoid that small violence *and* avoid<br/>
  the whiff of insidious long-term damage that seems to<br/>
  be floating into connection with the immunizations. <br/>
  THAT is definitely the Right choice.<br/>
<br/>
  But what if they get the disease because they were<br/>
  left unprotected?  What if they are rendered impotent<br/>
  and are never able to have children of their own? <br/>
  What if they are left paralyzed or deaf or blind? <br/>
  What if they are left unable to speak or recognize us<br/>
  or feed themselves, what if they *die*?  I personally<br/>
  have seen the last two happen, right here in the<br/>
  Metropolitan area in which I live.  What if our<br/>
  beloved children, and similarly unimmunized<br/>
  compatriots, are responsible for the spreading of a<br/>
  devastating epidemic?  What violence have you done<br/>
  them and your neighbors, in the name of avoiding the<br/>
  smaller violence?  <br/>
<br/>
  Can *any* of you guarantee that you haven&#39;t done some<br/>
  unknown violence or irreparable damage to your child&#39;s<br/>
  future by any action or decision you have made?  Would<br/>
  you want a Majority to tell you that you have<br/>
  ignorantly and callously played Russian Roulette with<br/>
  your child&#39;s life?  Would you feel comfortable in<br/>
  saying that very thing to other people on this list<br/>
  about the immunization, educational, religious,<br/>
  sexual, tv/computer, Ritalin issues, among others?<br/>
<br/>
  Probably not.  You are too vulnerable that way.  BUT<br/>
  you *are* comfortable in applying an inflexible,<br/>
  simplistic and virtuous-sounding generality in judging<br/>
  a small minority who are un-PC or independent enough<br/>
  to see things differently than the Majority.  You are<br/>
  comfortable with applying that one-size-fits-all<br/>
  measuring stick for &#39;violence&#39; to all children and<br/>
  families, no matter how different *their* experience<br/>
  might be from your own.<br/>
<br/>
  Must be comfy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527607354">I usually stay out of these discussions but it never ceases to amaze me that<br/>
unschoolers can be so rigid!  Folks who get up in arms over schools pigeon<br/>
holing students and the news media and government/politicians stereotyping<br/>
homeschooling should perhaps be a little more careful since quite a few seem<br/>
to be hypocrits and proponents of &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; when it comes to child<br/>
rearing!<br/>
<br/>
For starters, a swat on the diapered fanny of a child only falls under one<br/>
definition of the word violent and it isn&#39;t the definition that most folks<br/>
are referring to, so maybe some old-fashioned ps homework is in order!<br/>
<br/>
The definition that applies is #4:  &quot;caused by or showing strong feeling&quot;<br/>
And that only applies in the example given because any mother would have<br/>
strong feelings caused by fear that their child would possibly be injured or<br/>
killed.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for all those that take the hand of their child and stop them from<br/>
doing those actions that may cause them harm AND are throwing around words<br/>
such as violent and violence to describe swatting/spanking, etc, again, I<br/>
would suggest that you put your computers Thesaurus to work!  Under the word<br/>
&quot;violence: syn  compulsion, *coercion*, duress, *constraint*, *restraint.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But then, I&#39;m betting that most folks don&#39;t even really know what the<br/>
definition of &quot;violence&quot; really is, it has become such a catch phrase for<br/>
everything and anything that folks don&#39;t like.  I mean, one can &quot;shop<br/>
around&quot; for a definition that will fill the bill if one wants to really play<br/>
word games but the most commonly shown definition is &quot;exertion of physical<br/>
force(s) so as to INJURE&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can just as easily find as many ways to define that sicky sweet voice some<br/>
folks use to &quot;talk&quot; to their children when they are young and they &quot;explain&quot;<br/>
things to them as abuse, brainwashing, coercion, duress . . .  Hey, whadda<br/>
ya know, little bit of hypocrisy going on here since those are all synonyms<br/>
for *violence.*<br/>
<br/>
And, just a note.  Kids hate being talked to that way!<br/>
<br/>
So here is the line I am drawing ____________________ in the sand.  On one<br/>
side are the folks that understand that everyone is an individual, that<br/>
every child is an individual, that not any single method works for all<br/>
children, or in all situtations AND have the decency to allow those in a<br/>
position of first hand knowledge to know what is best for their child.  On<br/>
that side of the line are folks that take off those glasses that tint<br/>
everything in absolutes and folks who realise that to get from point A to<br/>
point B is not always a straight line.  That&#39;s the side of the line I&#39;m<br/>
staying on!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to the side of the line that refuses to acknowledge that one<br/>
size does not fit all; that justice is portrayed with a blindfold for a<br/>
reason; that no one appointed them judge and jury; that contrary to their<br/>
belief there isn&#39;t a one right way to raise a child; that they and their<br/>
methods are not perfect and that a swat does not an Ezzo make.<br/>

included, to hear dissenting views.  I don&#39;t feel like<br/>
there are many (any?) subjects on which I am so<br/>

give me new insight or understanding.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I mentioned on another post? Anyway, I think<br/>
abortion is a good example... people tend to be pretty<br/>
polarized on that issue, and I think that&#39;s<br/>
understandable.  Murder and the right to control over<br/>
what happens to your own body are pretty important<br/>
issues, and people feel strongly about them.  You and<br/>
I stand on opposing sides of that line, and were we to<br/>
discuss the issue, we would disagree with each other<br/>
to that degree, and it is unlikely that either one of<br/>
us would change our minds about which side of the line<br/>
we stand on... but we *might* reach a better<br/>
understanding of how people come to stand over there<br/>
on the other side, about how sincere and loving and<br/>
well intentioned they are.  And *that* is an important<br/>
thing to learn and understand.  We will never come to<br/>
that understanding if we take a stance that the other<br/>
*by the nature of their position* is ignorant,<br/>
uncaring, unethical, or (worst of all) inhuman.  We<br/>
reduce ourselves when we reduce others...<br/>
<br/>
I did read your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; last post and am very sorry you have had to endure<br/>
&gt; such tough times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about that.  Being sorry, I mean.  I<br/>
*very* much appreciate the empathy you show in your<br/>
response... but I don&#39;t know that I should be sorry<br/>
that I&#39;ve had those times (even as I sometimes resent<br/>
tough times as they are happening, and fear ones to<br/>
come).  I can&#39;t say &#39;Gee, I&#39;d like to do *that*<br/>
again&#39;, or &#39;Boy, this pain is *fun*!&#39;  But all the<br/>
painful experiences in my life are a part of who I<br/>
am... they taught me, changed me, brought amazing<br/>
people and insights into my life that I otherwise<br/>
might have missed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also have a daughter who is ADD while I do not<br/>
&gt; promote schools drugging children for compliance, I<br/>
&gt; also do not criticize those who have kids on meds<br/>
&gt; because my life would be a living hell without meds<br/>
&gt; for my daughter!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I relate to that!  I have taken the choice to not<br/>
medicate, but respect my SIL&#39;s decision to medicate<br/>
her son.  I have different concerns than she does, my<br/>
son is different than hers is, our living and family<br/>
situations are not identical, and our personalities<br/>
are *certainly* different.  How can I feel qualified<br/>
to tell her what she should do?  My son&#39;s thinking<br/>
processes are effected, his focus is effected, but he<br/>
isn&#39;t oppositional or overtly destructive, he (now)<br/>
has enough control over his impulses to avoid taking<br/>
*unreasonable* physical risks... I have decided to<br/>
pull him from school rather than trying to medicate<br/>
him so that he can function there.  I know I can<br/>
easily tolerate and accomodate (at the moment) his<br/>
non-medicated behavior at home.  My SIL has a very<br/>
different situation, as do you.  It would be<br/>
ridiculous in me to try to force you to do what is<br/>
best for my son in *your* home, where he does not<br/>
live!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your kind words, and your insights. <br/>
Your opinion is interesting and very valuable!<br/>

<br/>
I guess I should post on this thread, since I<br/>
inadvertantly started it with my thread on dubious<br/>
&quot;expert advice&quot;.  Many of you know that I have an<br/>
eldest son with many challenges that make him a daily<br/>
struggle to raise.  I am not certain from whence all<br/>
his problems stem, but we know that he has agression<br/>
and anger management issues, patience and attention<br/>
span limitations, self control problems and explosive<br/>
emotions, multiple severe allergies, asthma, eczema,<br/>
and other issues.  He is a bright child, and a joy<br/>
sometimes, with a hyperactive imagination and a<br/>
charming sense of humor.  Most folks tell us that we<br/>
are models of patience (which I often feel the<br/>
opposite of) and that we are wonderful parents doing<br/>
our best with a difficult child (when I often feel<br/>
like the worst kind of miserable failure with him). <br/>
My son right now is four and a half years old and we<br/>
are struggling daily with the issue of potty training.<br/>
<br/>
I can sympathise with Eileen, in her quest to deal<br/>
with a child with no fear of danger, as I had one too.<br/>
 He has, thankfully, finally learned some fear of<br/>
danger situations and I don&#39;t have to worry about him<br/>
running in the street anymore, much.  But believe me,<br/>
he used to.  He is also very, VERY physically active,<br/>
and was crawling at 4 months (!) and walking (well<br/>
running) at 8 months.  At the time he was walking, I<br/>
was several months into a complicated, extremely<br/>
problematic pregnancy.  I was sick a lot, and could<br/>
not carry him near as much as I would have liked.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas has no fear of strangers and goes with anyone. <br/>
Thomas likes to run and hide from us in public places,<br/>
or just run from us period.  Thomas likes to<br/>
constantly challenge and push his limits, and reverify<br/>
the rules, over and over and over.  Thomas imitates<br/>
what he sees on tv and what other people say and do,<br/>
with uncanny precision, including innappropriate<br/>
behavior.  Thomas LOVES girls, and likes to chase and<br/>
pester them in public places, taking innappropriate<br/>
liberties with touching, etc, with people he doesn&#39;t<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
When Thomas was a toddler, he was not allowed to walk<br/>
anywhere in public, as he always ran away from us. <br/>
Since I could not carry him, he was always strapped<br/>
tightly into his stroller or a shopping cart.  Those<br/>
were the rules, period.  If he didn&#39;t want to be in a<br/>
cart or his stroller (and believe me, we had plenty of<br/>
battles over it) we didn&#39;t go.  I spent a lot of time<br/>
at home his first three years, particularly when his<br/>
brother was born (Thomas was 15 months old) and I was<br/>
recovering from the pregnancy from hell with no<br/>
friends or relatives in a three state radius.  I am<br/>
not a proponent of leashes or harnesses and will not<br/>
use them.  Thomas DID run in the streets, parking<br/>
lots, towards rivers, stray animals, hot stoves, etc. <br/>
The times I was not able to catch him we were able to<br/>
get away with just a few scars to remember the<br/>
incident, thankfully.  But I had many heartstopping<br/>
moments in his &quot;running boy&quot; days.<br/>
<br/>
He is FINALLY old enough to stay (mostly) with us when<br/>
we go out, and we have been able to get rid of the<br/>
hated strollers.  Now we have challenges with him in<br/>
other areas, and I struggle daily with MY OWN anger<br/>
management and controlling the urge to hit.  He&#39;s the<br/>
type of kid that can be a pure joy at times, and at<br/>
other times, makes childless people thank their lucky<br/>
stars that they never had kids.  I am thankful every<br/>
day that I can get through with him that I keep my<br/>
temper, and I am miserable every day that I lose my<br/>
temper.  Even though it might get his attention where<br/>
many, many other methods have failed, I will never<br/>
feel that hitting my child is an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Eileen, I am not attacking you, so don&#39;t feel like you<br/>
have to defend yourself.  I am just sharing my<br/>
personal experience as the Mother of a boy who sounds<br/>
similar to yours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542948737">I don&#39;t feel attacked at all... and your son does<br/>
sound very like mine was at the time, at least in some<br/>
respects.  You were lucky that you *could* restrain<br/>
your son to a stroller etc... mine could get out of<br/>
everything; they simply aren&#39;t designed to restrain a<br/>
child who is barely two feet tall and weighs less than<br/>
fifteen pounds.  And staying home was not a<br/>
possibility; we HAD to go to the doctor&#39;s office, and<br/>
the parking lots there were the problematic area.  <br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that it is at least possible that<br/>
things will get better... at 11 my son is very sweet<br/>
and cooperative and bright, though still very active<br/>
and unfocussed!<br/>

&gt; My, my...  What an unusual, and apparantly<br/>
&gt; irresistable, position for homeschoolers to be in.<br/>
&gt; You have managed to become a Moral Majority!  The<br/>
&gt; decision to &quot;draw your line at &#39;no violence, never<br/>
&gt; hitting a child&#39;&quot; is held up as the gold standard<br/>
&gt; which should not be set aside for any reason, even if<br/>
&gt; the &#39;creative&#39; lengths to which one must go in order<br/>
&gt; to avoid doing so are effectively more abusive and<br/>
&gt; damaging to the psyche of a particular child than the<br/>
&gt; hitting itself.  The theory, in effect, becomes more<br/>
&gt; important than the child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you wildly misunderstood my post, as I can think of no other reason<br/>
for the above paragraph and the long diatribe that follows it. What I<br/>
stated, and what I stand by (which was, incidentally, in response to Lynda&#39;s<br/>
post and not yours) is that there is no such position as &quot;live and let live&quot;<br/>
and &quot;whatever works for you&quot; with regards to this subject. Whether or not<br/>
they want to admit it, everyone has a line somewhere in their head that they<br/>
have drawn. That line might be &quot;No violence, no coercion, no restraint,<br/>
ever&quot; or that line might be &quot;No physical violence&quot; or it might be &quot;a light<br/>
smack on the bottom is OK&quot; or that line might be &quot;A spanking with my hand<br/>
but not with anything else&quot; or it might be &quot;A good whipping does a child<br/>
good&quot;, but *everyone* has a line. I must sincerely doubt that anyone on this<br/>
list would say &quot;Well, whatever works for you&quot; to a parent who insisted (as<br/>
in my previous example) that scalding a child with hot water was necessary<br/>
to teach them about stove safety. This is a ridiculous example of course<br/>
(though sadly, probably not one that some parent somewhere has not done),<br/>
but it is to illustrate the point - we all have our boundaries. Arguing that<br/>
one person is superior to another because they are more open-minded about<br/>
spanking is IMHO misguided. We all have our boundaries, they are just in<br/>
different places. Given that we have boundaries, and given that we all judge<br/>
the *acts* that other parents might take (I, for instance, wouldn&#39;t hesitate<br/>
to call CPS on a parent I thought was truly abusing their child, if I<br/>
thought it was in the child&#39;s best interests), I think the best we can do is<br/>
try not to judge other *people* though we may judge their actions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By your framing of the argument, you would have me<br/>
&gt; taking the position that a small amount of violence is<br/>
&gt; not harmful to my, or any, child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t have you take any position. I would have you hold to your own<br/>
beliefs and I to mine and each freely have the right to state what we<br/>
believe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That is not a<br/>
&gt; position that I could, or would ever wish to, defend.<br/>
&gt; My position, my experience, my observation, is that a<br/>
&gt; small amount of violence is unavoidable in many...<br/>
&gt; probably most... children&#39;s lives<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is probably true. But I thought the issue at hand is whether or not the<br/>
parent inflicts that violence. I think there&#39;s most likely a big difference<br/>
in a child&#39;s mind between something happening to them and their parents<br/>
doing something to them. I was hit by a baseball bat and knocked unconscious<br/>
as a child, but that is an entirely different issue in my mind than the<br/>
times my parents spanked me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;long rant about immunizations snipped&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can *any* of you guarantee that you haven&#39;t done some<br/>
&gt; unknown violence or irreparable damage to your child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; future by any action or decision you have made?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure none of us can, life doesn&#39;t work that way. But again that seems<br/>
sort of irrelevant to this discussion. The discussion was about whether or<br/>
not specific corporal punishment was a) effective, b) caused psychological<br/>
harm, and c) was necessary, and in fact, you yourself asked for input,<br/>
saying &quot;what is your solution for it...?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would<br/>
&gt; you want a Majority to tell you that you have<br/>
&gt; ignorantly and callously played Russian Roulette with<br/>
&gt; your child&#39;s life?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh heck, they do it all the time. Any parent who breastfeeds a toddler or<br/>
sleeps with their kids or homeschools for that matter has probably heard<br/>
these things a million times. If you really believe that what you are doing<br/>
is right, why would it matter what random other people think?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Would you feel comfortable in<br/>
&gt; saying that very thing to other people on this list<br/>
&gt; about the immunization, educational, religious,<br/>
&gt; sexual, tv/computer, Ritalin issues, among others?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d definitely feel comfortable stating my opinion on any of these subjects<br/>
if I had one.  And I&#39;d hope to feel comfortable listening to other people&#39;s<br/>
opinions, even if I didn&#39;t agree with them, just to see if I could glean<br/>
some bit that would be useful and/or applicable in my own life.<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone on this list has stated that anyone else has<br/>
&quot;ignorantly and callously played Russian Roulette with your child&#39;s life&quot;<br/>
about *any* subject that I&#39;ve read about here. I think people have talked<br/>
about their opinions about actions, unless I missed something, no-one has<br/>
directly accused anyone else of such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You are too vulnerable that way.  BUT<br/>
&gt; you *are* comfortable in applying an inflexible,<br/>
&gt; simplistic and virtuous-sounding generality in judging<br/>
&gt; a small minority who are un-PC or independent enough<br/>
&gt; to see things differently than the Majority.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm, I&#39;m wondering here if the &quot;you&quot; who you are speaking to is<br/>
specifically me, as the post seems to be directed at me (with my post in<br/>
quotes) or if this is a more generic &quot;you&quot;. If it is the former, I&#39;d<br/>
challenge you to find any post in this thread where I personally judged any<br/>
*person* for something I disagreed with. Yes, I strongly disagree with<br/>
hitting children and I said &quot;There are always options, other than violence&quot;<br/>
which I believe to be a true statement. I dislike the act and that is where<br/>
my own personal line is drawn. I don&#39;t judge other people however. Heaven<br/>
knows, I&#39;ve made enough mistakes in my own relatively short parenting career<br/>
to know that everyone does things they wish they hadn&#39;t done and says things<br/>
they wish they hadn&#39;t said. I don&#39;t, however, defend them as being the right<br/>
thing to do. I should hope that on this list we can always discuss *actions*<br/>
without getting down to specific judgements on *people* as you seem to have<br/>
done here in this post (by repeated use of the word &quot;you&quot; followed by all<br/>
sorts of outrageous statements.).<br/>

escape artist from day one!  The emergency rooms know him by name!  17<br/>
stitches in one foot, almost lost a finger to an ax, teeth busted out,<br/>
walking the top rail of a 6&#39; fence at under 2 years of age, climbing to the<br/>
top of a closet at a cousin&#39;s house and eating a bottle of aspirin (no one<br/>
knows how and we can only figure that he actually climbed up clothes like a<br/>
monkey) at 18 months, back injury, hip injury, you name it it has happened<br/>
to him.  He, however, was too fast and too slick to ever catch before the<br/>
accidents happened.<br/>
<br/>
Now, No. 2 son was the perfect baby, never cried, always a joy BUT, he lived<br/>
in his own world.  You could talk until you were blue in the face, show by<br/>
example, time out, use patience, physically restrain (your example of the<br/>
strollers) and it didn&#39;t phase him!  When he was in his world, you didn&#39;t<br/>
get through and even when he wasn&#39;t, reality never seemed to intrude when it<br/>
came to some things.  Shock was the only thing that worked!  He got two<br/>
swats and 1 spanking (he set fire to our bedroom drapes).  He is 21 now and<br/>
has said, &quot;Mom you were right&quot; and has said that maybe he needed more<br/>
shocks!  He thinks his life would have been easier if I had disciplined him<br/>
more and he hadn&#39;t had to learn quite so many things the hard way (his<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;One size doesn&#39;t fit all.  &gt;Every child is an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;individual and there are children that only<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;shocked&quot; gets through to.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I think I disagree, and still do respectfully,<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;after reading Eileen&#39;s posts on this subject. We<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;draw lines in the sand - ......The question is,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;where is each person&#39;s line in the sand drawn?<br/>
&gt; &gt; -Robin-<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess I should post on this thread, since I<br/>
&gt; &gt; inadvertantly started it with my thread on dubious<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;expert advice&quot;.  Many of you know that I have an<br/>
&gt; &gt; eldest son with many challenges that make him a<br/>
&gt; daily<br/>
&gt; &gt; struggle to raise.  I am not certain from whence<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; his problems stem, but we know that he has<br/>
&gt; agression<br/>
&gt; &gt; and anger management issues, patience and<br/>
&gt; attention<br/>
&gt; &gt; span limitations, self control problems and<br/>
&gt; explosive<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotions, multiple severe allergies, asthma,<br/>
&gt; eczema,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and other issues.  He is a bright child, and a joy<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes, with a hyperactive imagination and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; charming sense of humor.  Most folks tell us that<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; are models of patience (which I often feel the<br/>
&gt; &gt; opposite of) and that we are wonderful parents<br/>
&gt; doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; our best with a difficult child (when I often feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; like the worst kind of miserable failure with<br/>
&gt; him).<br/>
&gt; &gt; My son right now is four and a half years old and<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; are struggling daily with the issue of potty<br/>
&gt; training.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can sympathise with Eileen, in her quest to deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a child with no fear of danger, as I had one<br/>
&gt; too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  He has, thankfully, finally learned some fear of<br/>
&gt; &gt; danger situations and I don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; running in the street anymore, much.  But believe<br/>
&gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; he used to.  He is also very, VERY physically<br/>
&gt; active,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and was crawling at 4 months (!) and walking (well<br/>
&gt; &gt; running) at 8 months.  At the time he was walking,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was several months into a complicated, extremely<br/>
&gt; &gt; problematic pregnancy.  I was sick a lot, and<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; not carry him near as much as I would have liked.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thomas has no fear of strangers and goes with<br/>
&gt; anyone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thomas likes to run and hide from us in public<br/>
&gt; places,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or just run from us period.  Thomas likes to<br/>
&gt; &gt; constantly challenge and push his limits, and<br/>
&gt; reverify<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rules, over and over and over.  Thomas<br/>
&gt; imitates<br/>
&gt; &gt; what he sees on tv and what other people say and<br/>
&gt; do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; with uncanny precision, including innappropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; behavior.  Thomas LOVES girls, and likes to chase<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; pester them in public places, taking<br/>
&gt; innappropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; liberties with touching, etc, with people he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When Thomas was a toddler, he was not allowed to<br/>
&gt; walk<br/>
&gt; &gt; anywhere in public, as he always ran away from us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since I could not carry him, he was always<br/>
&gt; strapped<br/>
&gt; &gt; tightly into his stroller or a shopping cart. <br/>
&gt; Those<br/>
&gt; &gt; were the rules, period.  If he didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
&gt; in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; cart or his stroller (and believe me, we had<br/>
&gt; plenty of<br/>
&gt; &gt; battles over it) we didn&#39;t go.  I spent a lot of<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; at home his first three years, particularly when<br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; &gt; brother was born (Thomas was 15 months old) and I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; recovering from the pregnancy from hell with no<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends or relatives in a three state radius.  I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; &gt; not a proponent of leashes or harnesses and will<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; use them.  Thomas DID run in the streets, parking<br/>
&gt; &gt; lots, towards rivers, stray animals, hot stoves,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The times I was not able to catch him we were able<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get away with just a few scars to remember the<br/>
&gt; &gt; incident, thankfully.  But I had many<br/>
&gt; heartstopping<br/>
&gt; &gt; moments in his &quot;running boy&quot; days.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; He is FINALLY old enough to stay (mostly) with us<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; we go out, and we have been able to get rid of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hated strollers.  Now we have challenges with him<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472554532">With all the talk about to swat or not to swat, to restrain or not to<br/>
restrain, I think the proof is in the pudding.  My sports nut who has given<br/>
me all the gray hairs never leaves the house, the mall, the car, a<br/>
restaurant without giving &quot;mamma&quot; a hug, a kiss and saying &quot;I love you.&quot;  He<br/>
is 17 and he does this infront of his friends, in front of girlfriends and<br/>
in the middle of the mall.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;perfect&quot; baby who needed the swats, calls just to ask how I am and to<br/>
say &quot;I love you, Mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eldest son calls on a regular basis for childrearing advise and always<br/>
remembers all the &quot;little things&quot; because &quot;I want my mother to be happy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets all collect &quot;orphans&quot; and &quot;walking wounded&quot; and bring them home.<br/>
<br/>
So, like I said, they are all individuals, no pigeon holes and the proof is<br/>
in the pudding.<br/>
<br/>
You and your kidlet are going to do fine!  The love comes through your posts<br/>
and I&#39;m sure he knows and that is the most important thing!!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; and anger management issues, patience and<br/>
&gt; &gt; attention<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; span limitations, self control problems and<br/>
&gt; &gt; explosive<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; emotions, multiple severe allergies, asthma,<br/>
&gt; &gt; eczema,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and other issues.  He is a bright child, and a joy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes, with a hyperactive imagination and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; charming sense of humor.  Most folks tell us that<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are models of patience (which I often feel the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; opposite of) and that we are wonderful parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our best with a difficult child (when I often feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like the worst kind of miserable failure with<br/>
&gt; &gt; him).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My son right now is four and a half years old and<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are struggling daily with the issue of potty<br/>
&gt; &gt; training.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can sympathise with Eileen, in her quest to deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a child with no fear of danger, as I had one<br/>
&gt; &gt; too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  He has, thankfully, finally learned some fear of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; danger situations and I don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>
&gt; &gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; running in the street anymore, much.  But believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he used to.  He is also very, VERY physically<br/>
&gt; &gt; active,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and was crawling at 4 months (!) and walking (well<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; running) at 8 months.  At the time he was walking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was several months into a complicated, extremely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problematic pregnancy.  I was sick a lot, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not carry him near as much as I would have liked.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thomas has no fear of strangers and goes with<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thomas likes to run and hide from us in public<br/>
&gt; &gt; places,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or just run from us period.  Thomas likes to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; constantly challenge and push his limits, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; reverify<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the rules, over and over and over.  Thomas<br/>
&gt; &gt; imitates<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what he sees on tv and what other people say and<br/>
&gt; &gt; do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with uncanny precision, including innappropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; behavior.  Thomas LOVES girls, and likes to chase<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pester them in public places, taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; innappropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; liberties with touching, etc, with people he<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When Thomas was a toddler, he was not allowed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; walk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anywhere in public, as he always ran away from us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since I could not carry him, he was always<br/>
&gt; &gt; strapped<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tightly into his stroller or a shopping cart.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were the rules, period.  If he didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cart or his stroller (and believe me, we had<br/>
&gt; &gt; plenty of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; battles over it) we didn&#39;t go.  I spent a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at home his first three years, particularly when<br/>
&gt; &gt; his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; brother was born (Thomas was 15 months old) and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recovering from the pregnancy from hell with no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; friends or relatives in a three state radius.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not a proponent of leashes or harnesses and will<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; use them.  Thomas DID run in the streets, parking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lots, towards rivers, stray animals, hot stoves,<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The times I was not able to catch him we were able<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get away with just a few scars to remember the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; incident, thankfully.  But I had many<br/>
&gt; &gt; heartstopping<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; moments in his &quot;running boy&quot; days.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He is FINALLY old enough to stay (mostly) with us<br/>
&gt; &gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we go out, and we have been able to get rid of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hated strollers.  Now we have challenges with him<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other areas, and I struggle daily with MY OWN<br/>
&gt; &gt; anger<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; management and controlling the urge to hit.  He&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; type of kid that can be a pure joy at times, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other times, makes childless people thank their<br/>
&gt; &gt; lucky<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stars that they never had kids.  I am thankful<br/>
&gt; &gt; every<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; day that I can get through with him that I keep my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; temper, and I am miserable every day that I lose<br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; temper.  Even though it might get his attention<br/>
&gt; &gt; where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; many, many other methods have failed, I will never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feel that hitting my child is an answer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Eileen, I am not attacking you, so don&#39;t feel like<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to defend yourself.  I am just sharing my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; personal experience as the Mother of a boy who<br/>
&gt; &gt; sounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; similar to yours.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
