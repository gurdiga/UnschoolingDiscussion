<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413549005">Since there is all this BF talk, I was wondering if anyone could help me with weaning ideas. My daughter is almost 27 months and I feel the time to wean is growing closer. But I have no idea how to go about it.

 </span></blockquote>This is just me, (and I never once attended a LLL meeting. I don&#39;t think we <br/>
even have one here) but I let my kids wean themselves. I know that there is <br/>
pressure to stop after a time. And boy do I remember the looks I got when I <br/>
was tandem nursing a 28 mo. old and a newborn, the looks got even nastier <br/>
when Moly was three and Jack was 8 mos. Once we were all at the zoo, and we <br/>
had to stop for Jack who was about 5mos, to nurse, then Moly climbed up and <br/>
lifted the blanket to nurse too. A woman walked by just as Darin took Jack so <br/>
I could finish with Moly and she laid in to me about how the baby was old <br/>
enough for a cup and the fact that I was still letting *the girl* nurse was <br/>
just sick. I thought Darin looked like he was going to explode! (when Jack <br/>
was almost three and still nursing, Darin was slightly uncomfortable with it, <br/>
and even made noises about quitting. which was funny because he didn&#39;t have a <br/>
problem with Moly nursing that long, but then maybe he was just ready to have <br/>
them all to himself again! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
Moly stopped right around three and Jack was just past three, although he <br/>
would comfort nurse every now and then. I would have loved to continue. <br/>
Again, just me, but don&#39;t be in too much of a hurry to stop. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-483580799">I think it&#39;s more than just believing it&#39;s literal, it&#39;s believing <br/>
that it is accurate historically.  There have been people who have <br/>
counted the generations (and how old each person was at death in each <br/>
generation) and figured out historically how many years are between <br/>
Adam and Jesus, and we know from more recent historical records how <br/>
many years there are between Jesus and now.  <br/>
<br/>
My point in this is not to argue the creation/evolution point but to <br/>
point out that evolutionary arguments aren&#39;t going to be effective <br/>
arguments in convincing someone to breastfeed past the toothless baby <br/>
stage.  I think breastfeeding babies with teeth is a good idea.  I <br/>
breastfed my babies with teeth and never had a problem.  But you&#39;re <br/>
not going to convince young earth creationists (and there are a lot <br/>
of homeschoolers in that category) to breastfeed using that <br/>
argument.  <br/>

she knew better.  Recently a friend told me that she had weaned her almost 2<br/>
year old son on the dentist&#39;s advice for the same reason.  She was quite<br/>
upset about it because she hadn&#39;t been able to nurse her daughter at all and<br/>
wanted to continue longer with her son.  I only wish she had brought it up<br/>
before weaning him.  All I could do was tell her to check out even medical<br/>
people&#39;s advice.  They don&#39;t always know what they&#39;re talking about.<br/>

thousands of years breast milk was it. <br/>
It isn&#39;t breast milk that damages babys teeth. But a Bottle with formula left <br/>
in a crib at night, so baby won&#39;t cry, or so baby can fall asleep will. <br/>
Bottle=wrong shaped plastic nipples, Formula=sugar=bad teeth (cavities and <br/>
misformed teeth) Breastmilk=natural mommy stuff. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913442264">OK, taking a plunge here....I absolutely respect and to a great degree <br/>
agree with most of the responses so far with regard to child-led <br/>
weaning. I was devoted to the idea when my child was young. However, in <br/>
the end I did initiate weaning, and since I haven&#39;t seen anyone actually <br/>
offer the ideas requested, I&#39;ll give a quick synopsis of what worked for <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Around 22-24 months, the process of nursing became problematic for me <br/>
when I realized my daughter was not really nursing, but rather chewing, <br/>
biting and generally playing, but not truly nursing (during the day). I <br/>
tried for several weeks to refocus the experience with gentle prompting <br/>
and being sure that *I* was really *there*, to no avail. Finally, I <br/>
began a two-pronged approach to gently wean from the frequent, <br/>
NON-feeding daytime sessions (we still had long, relaxed FEEDING <br/>
sessions in the morning, at night, and perhaps once, sometimes twice <br/>
during the night).<br/>
<br/>
First, I began delaying my response to the request; instead of instantly <br/>
dropping what I was doing, I would ask her to wait 10 minutes. Often, <br/>
she would go to whatever she was doing while waiting, and forget all <br/>
about it. Secondly, when she would either insist she couldn&#39;t wait, or <br/>
come back after a few minutes, I would begin to nurse, but if she was <br/>
not feeding, but merely (and PAINFULLY) playing/chewing/hanging out, I <br/>
would explain that it was uncomfortable for me, and that if all she <br/>
wanted was a cuddle, we could cuddle. Often we would just sit or lay <br/>
together, skin to skin, and talk or coo for a bit. After a time, she <br/>
would get up and proclaim she was done. After a few weeks, she stopped <br/>
asking for *ma-ma* during the day, still occasionally asking for a <br/>
cuddle, and we continued to have true nursing sessions first thing in <br/>
the morning and before/during sleep for a few more months, then she just <br/>
sort of tapered off. One day she hadn&#39;t nursed overnight, or in the <br/>
morning (just crawled out of bed and started the day without me), and <br/>
when sleep time came, I asked if she wanted to nurse, and she simply <br/>
said *no, I think I&#39;m not going to do that anymore, ok?*<br/>
<br/>
Now, i know many feel it should be completely left to the child, and <br/>
more power to you. Also, I&#39;m not sure I would have initiated weaning if <br/>
she was still *feeding a lot* as you&#39;ve indicated your daughter is. But <br/>
if, for whatever reason (and I&#39;m not clear on yours, so it&#39;s hard to <br/>
say) you do decide to wean, my suggestion is to be slow, gentle and <br/>
honest, and be sure to remember that a huge part of nursing,especially <br/>
in older ones, is about the time and connection.....physical and <br/>
emotional. Please be sure to leave a nice, wide open door to that aspect <br/>
for your child. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-515922079">these are all wonderful suggestions- and many more like them can be <br/>
found in the book I mentioned.<br/>
Mothering Your Nursing Toddler<br/>
and How Weaning Happens- is a good one, too.<br/>
I know lots of moms who do exactly this- wean during the daytime- or <br/>
conversly-wean during the night time.<br/>
It *is* a two way street. Mom has be comfortable, too.<br/>

&gt; when sleep time came, I asked if she wanted to nurse, and she simply<br/>
&gt; said *no, I think I&#39;m not going to do that anymore, ok?*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, i know many feel it should be completely left to the child, and<br/>
&gt; more power to you. Also, I&#39;m not sure I would have initiated weaning if<br/>
&gt; she was still *feeding a lot* as you&#39;ve indicated your daughter is. But<br/>
&gt; if, for whatever reason (and I&#39;m not clear on yours, so it&#39;s hard to<br/>
&gt; say) you do decide to wean, my suggestion is to be slow, gentle and<br/>
&gt; honest, and be sure to remember that a huge part of nursing,especially<br/>
&gt; in older ones, is about the time and connection.....physical and<br/>
&gt; emotional. Please be sure to leave a nice, wide open door to that aspect<br/>
&gt; for your child. :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; She feeds a lot - during the day and even through the night, since<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515481994">No!  lol It doesn&#39;t say when babies started teething.  We do know <br/>
historically that many people in Biblical periods of history nursed <br/>
for several years.  Jesus himself was probably nursed for several <br/>
years. <br/>
<br/>
I was just pointing out that arguments for evolution won&#39;t sway <br/>
Christians who believe the Bible literally, as many homeschoolers <br/>
do.  The book the continuum concept itself uses evolution as its very <br/>
basis.  I love the ideas in that book and I think it could have been <br/>
written with a creationist view, but a lot of Christians wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even read it because of its evolutionary basis.  Also, use of terms <br/>
like &quot;we&#39;ve been doing this for 90,000 years&quot; or millions of years or <br/>
whatever won&#39;t be accepted.  Neither will arguments that teeth are <br/>
things that we&#39;ve developed through time, because we believe the <br/>
first humans  were created perfect, with a perfect set of teeth.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I think it&#39;s more than just believing it&#39;s literal, it&#39;s believing <br/>
that it is accurate historically.  There have been people who have <br/>
counted the generations (and how old each person was at death in each <br/>
generation) and figured out historically how many years are between <br/>
Adam and Jesus, and we know from more recent historical records how <br/>
many years there are between Jesus and now.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then you have to believe Adam was really the first person.<br/>
<br/>
If it is historically accurate it might as well be literal.<br/>
It can&#39;t be literal without being historically accurate.<br/>
<br/>
If that is important to you, it doesn&#39;t need to matter whether your <br/>
children&#39;s teeth are good because in heaven their teeth will be good and <br/>
that&#39;s the only important thing.   Jesus is late.  If he&#39;s still coming, it <br/>
should be soon.  Then teeth won&#39;t matter for anybody.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240376226">According to Jewish law mother is obligated to nurse, barring health problems either way, if the mil or her mother nursed.<br/>
<br/>
A nursing mother is not suppose to marry until the child is 2yrs, because there was the fear that the new dh would want a child and that would interfere with nursing the older child.<br/>
<br/>
A woman who is nursing can use birth control for 2yrs (there are other reasons for using birth control, mostly to do with mom&#39;s health).  <br/>
<br/>
Nursing can continue till age 4 according to what I learned, if the child is healthy, and until 5 if the child is ill.  There is something about giving breast milk by cup but I forget...<br/>
<br/>
When I first had a child, when I was pregnant, I asked my Rabbi if I could nurse publically..not the norm for most Orthdox women.  He said yes, if necessary. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, according to Jewish law, be fruitful and multiply applies<br/>
1)to a man, not a woman...it is his obligation<br/>
2)her health takes precedence, including pyschological health.<br/>
3)really is fulfilled when the man has one child of each sex or two boys according to some authorites(most hold one child of either sex.)  It becomes easier to use birth control after that.<br/>
<br/>
but of fundamental importance is the mother&#39;s physical and psychological health.<br/>
<br/>
probably more than you wanted to know<br/>

And then some other things I lifted from other people&#39;s lists of evidence of <br/>
the same subject, that Jesus is late; he said he&#39;d be here during the lives <br/>
of those he was speaking to.<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 16 <br/>
27  For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; <br/>
and then he shall reward every man according to his works. <br/>
28  Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which <br/>
shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. <br/>
<br/>
Hebrews 10:37    For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, <br/>
and will not tarry. <br/>
<br/>
Revelations 22 verses 7, 12, 20  [but I think Revelations is crack-smoking <br/>
nonsense, so I&#39;m not bothering to quote those; of course only those who DO <br/>
want to hope that book is as literal as God stopping the sun in the sky are <br/>
eager for Jesus to come back right now and smite me]<br/>
<br/>
1John 2:18   Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard <br/>
that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we <br/>
know that it is the last time. <br/>

Every mention of &quot;the last days&quot; or equivalents [last times, last hour] in <br/>
the New Testament refers to the 1st Century. There are no exceptions. Check: <br/>
Hebrews 1:2; Acts 2:17; 1 timothy 4:1; 2 Timothy 3:1; James 5:3; 2 Peter 3:3; <br/>
Jude 18; 1 John 2:18.  <br/>

<br/>
Do you know what the Bible says about an &quot;end of the world?&quot; NOTHING. What do <br/>
the historic creeds say? Again, NOTHING. What the Bible actually says is:  <br/>
*   World without end, Amen -- Ephesians 3:21 KJV <br/>
*   The earth remains forever -- Ecclesiastes 1:4 <br/>
*   End of the age -- Matthew 13:39, 49; 24:3 <br/>

BUYING INTO A NEW TEACHING IN CHURCH HISTORY [LAST 150 YEARS] OF AN ESCAPE <br/>
FROM THIS PLANET, FROM THIS LIFE&#39;S TRIBULATIONS AND FROM KINGDOM <br/>
RESPONSIBILITIES. <br/>
 <br/>
The relatively new teaching of a &quot;rapture-removal&quot; from planet Earth is a <br/>
distortion of key scriptures historically interpreted to refer to a general <br/>
resurrection. Jesus specifically prayed against the human weakness for <br/>
removal (John 17:15). And His prayer is still in effect. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The following quotes confirm that Jesus deliberately lead his followers into <br/>
false expectations.<br/>
Matthew 10:23 - When giving instructions to his apostles as to just how they <br/>
are to go about spreading his message Jesus says, .&quot; . . for truly I say unto <br/>
you, you shall not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of <br/>
Man comes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 16:28 - Jesus says to his disciples, &quot;There are some of those <br/>
standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming <br/>
in his kingdom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 24:33-34 - After prophesying a wide assortment of events including <br/>
the second coming, Jesus said to his disciples, .&quot; . . when you shall see all <br/>
these things, know that it (the 2nd coming) is near, even at the door. This <br/>
generation shall not pass till these things be fulfilled.&quot; He was obviously <br/>
referring to the contemporary generation.<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 26:64 - When brought before Caiaphas, the Chief Priest, Jesus said to <br/>
him, &quot;I tell you, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man . . . coming on the <br/>
clouds of heaven.&quot; According to this the second coming was to happen during <br/>
Caiaphas&#39; lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Mark 9:1 - Jesus said to the people and to his disciples, ”Verily I say unto <br/>
you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of <br/>
death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.<br/>
<br/>
Luke 21:27-28 -Jesus said to the rich people, “And then shall they see the <br/>
Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these <br/>
things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your <br/>
redemption draweth nigh.”<br/>
<br/>
Luke 21:32 - Jesus said, again to the rich people, “This generation shall not <br/>
pass away, till all be fulfilled.”<br/>
<br/>
I Thessalonians 4:15-17 - In his first Epistle to the Thessalonians Paul <br/>
assures the congregation that the second coming is very near. .&quot; . . we who <br/>
are alive, . . . shall not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord <br/>
Himself will descend from heaven . . . and the dead in Christ shall rise <br/>
first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together . . .&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Revelation 22:7 - Jesus says, &quot;Behold, I come quickly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Revelation 22:12 - Again Jesus says, “Behold, I come quickly.”<br/>
<br/>
Revelation 22:20 - Jesus says, &quot;Surely I come quickly.&quot;</div>
