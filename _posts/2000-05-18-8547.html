<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968059642">Hi Renee!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list, and to homeschooling.  My name is Liz, and I just<br/>
started this myself as well.  I haven&#39;t even started teaching my kids yet,<br/>
that will take place next beginning in the fall.  However, I can fully<br/>
relate to you.  When a person decides to take that step to homeschool, they<br/>
ARE stepping into uncharted territory (at least for themselves).  I also<br/>
thought the same thing, that there was no &quot;welcoming&quot; committee....it would<br/>
have helped to have someone take me by the hand and &quot;show&quot; me what to do.<br/>
But, of course, there&#39;s no such thing.  However, I have found this email<br/>
list to be very beneficial, and things seem to be falling into place.  I get<br/>
bits and pieces of information to put together, but basically it&#39;s a &quot;figure<br/>
it out for yourself&quot; thing, because only you know what is best for your<br/>
individual child.<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 children ages 4,5,10 and 12 that I will begin homeschooling next<br/>
year.  I have just decided that I&#39;ve had enough of school violence.  Also my<br/>
oldest son is ahead of his grade.  In the second grade, he could do algebra<br/>
in his head.  He is now in the sixth grade, and after 4 years of talking to<br/>
teachers (and others), I can&#39;t get anyone to advance and challenge him.  My<br/>
5 year old is NOT ready for socialization with other kids.  She thinks<br/>
EVERYTHING should be her way.  So these are my reasons for deciding to<br/>
homeschool, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the right choice for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to let it over-whelm you.  I&#39;ve been doing the same thing myself,<br/>
and I find it difficult to concentrate and put things together myself when I<br/>
stress out....I lose all focus, and make things worse.  And it&#39;s not that<br/>
bad at all.  If you need someone to talk to, feel free to contact me.  I<br/>
wish you all the best!<br/>
<br/>
Liz<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi everyone.  I just subbed to this list yesterday.  I am very<br/>
&gt; new to homeschooling, and don&#39;t really feel like I have a &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>
&gt; I probably have come to this in a different way from a lot of<br/>
&gt; people.  We have a son, almost 7, with a unique combination of<br/>
&gt; challenges and gifts.  We have tried to find the right placement for<br/>
&gt; him in school.  There isn&#39;t one.  He learns best on his own, in his own<br/>
&gt; time and way--which often involves climbing all over the place while<br/>
&gt; he is learning.  Whenever he is under stress he acts out behaviorally,<br/>
&gt; and at school he does that a lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were having so many problems that we met with the school and had<br/>
&gt; him officially switched to half days.  Things seemed to be better for<br/>
&gt; a while, and then he couldn&#39;t make the transition back to school<br/>
&gt; after spring break.  So actually we are not even officially homeschooling<br/>
&gt; yet, we are on &quot;home instruction&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My head is spinning!  I went from thinking about maybe homeschooling him<br/>
&gt; next year, to having him home full time *now* without having time to<br/>
&gt; get my bearings, develop a support network, etc.  I have found out<br/>
&gt; where the groups are and have attended a couple of meetings.  The<br/>
&gt; thing is, when my son was starting school, it was somebody&#39;s *job*<br/>
&gt; to help me out, show me the ropes, etc.  Homeschooling by nature is<br/>
&gt; a lot of people doing their own thing for their own reasons, and they<br/>
&gt; get together and form friendships, plan activities, etc.  But there<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot;   I am not saying that people<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t been nice, it is just a rough transition into uncharted<br/>
territories,<br/>
&gt; and I am really feeling &quot;on my own&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So anyway, there are lots of issues.  I was not *planning* to do this,<br/>
&gt; but it became apparent to me that it was the only choice.  I need to<br/>
&gt; find a way to do this and still get my own needs for solitude and self-<br/>
&gt; determination met.  And I need a peer group.  Or something.  I also<br/>
&gt; feel like an &quot;outsider&quot; among homeschoolers because I *do* hope that<br/>
&gt; my other child can go to school, as I hoped that my son would.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just that I knew when it was time to take him out for the benefit<br/>
&gt; of everyone involved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rambling, I guess, but also hoping that someone can relate...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, maybe we&#39;ll be your peer group.  Or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, a lot of hsers have children in ps.  And in and out of ps and private <br/>
school and all sorts of other arrangements over the years, so maybe your not <br/>
so strange after all!  <br/>
<br/>
I keep checking on the ps near us that was supposed to have a program I <br/>
thought would suit my son.  It was supposed to start in 3rd grade but now I <br/>
find out it starts in 4th.  And he is in 1st grade officially so . . . by <br/>
that time we may be so spoiled as to have completely given up on any thought <br/>
of ps but who knows . . . the beauty of hsing!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, welcome!! My son is also 7 yo (his birthday is today!) and my <br/>
daughter is 5 1/2 yo.  They are both very bright and basically that is the <br/>
reason we hs.  The curric at the ps was pathetic and the accommodations <br/>
available were completely inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
We do a mixed bag of lots of library visits, gardening, beaching, outside <br/>
lessons (piano and dance and Tae Kwon Do), science stuff, reading, reading, <br/>
reading, and then some more playing.  I guess we are unschooling but some <br/>
days do seem pretty structured -- some not at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure as you browse aound the web and the library you will gets lots of <br/>
info (probably too much!) on the different approaches to hsing.  But, I <br/>
think, you basically have to figure it out for yourself -- find out what <br/>
suits you and yours.  You are right -- there is no welcoming committee and <br/>
set of instructions!  :)  But that&#39;s really a good thing once you get used to <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Ask lots of questions!  We are pretty new to all of this but someone on this <br/>
or another list will be able to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with everything!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Renee and everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list as well.  I have been homeschooling now about 2 1/2 years<br/>
and like you I felt the same way starting out.  The local support group in my<br/>
area wasn&#39;t very welcoming in that...making friends or arranging play dates or<br/>
one on one with another homeschooling family didn&#39;t happen for me and many other<br/>
new homeschoolers.  I found the greatest amount of support and information<br/>
online.  I joined email lists, lurked and learned, and if I felt comfortable I<br/>
joined in.  You may have to do this also.  It takes a while to find<br/>
yourself...knowing what style suits you for your own home learning situation.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel bad about wanting your other child to continue in school.  Many<br/>
parents do both for various reasons.  It may end up that your other child may<br/>
want to home educate and or you will want to have them home, but only time will<br/>
tell.<br/>
<br/>
What is wonderful is the fact you recognize your son&#39;s unique ways and that you<br/>
are willing to help facilitate him on his own learning adventure.  Good luck to<br/>
you both!<br/>

some very real issues in or out of school.  Even though he has<br/>

the only way to do this is to be on &quot;home instruction&quot; rather <br/>

a week.  But of course my fear is that I would be back in<br/>
the position of trying to get my son to do homework that someone<br/>

through the county board of developmental disabilities that we<br/>
do not need to have the school involved.  <br/>

I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d be interested; but I know a woman here who has an <br/>
autistic son.  She has become a home-schooler for reasons similar to yours.  <br/>
The local schools basically cannot handle the uniqueness of individuals like <br/>
her son.  What I was thinking was that I could get her address for you and <br/>
you two could write or call one another and offer support.  She&#39;s a terrific <br/>
lady.  I&#39;ve enjoyed talking with her.  I imagine you might also, especially <br/>
since your situations are so similar.  If you&#39;re interested, let me know.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think she&#39;s online; but maybe we could work something out in that way. <br/>
  Let me know what ya think.  Take care!<br/>

&gt; ideas, like the rain painting. So hello :)<br/>

I am Amy, unschooling mom to 3 girls, ages 7, 4, and 2 in MA. We too, live a<br/>
very natural lifestyle. Vegitarian, unitarian, and as my dh says<br/>
homeschoolitarian. We believe in the family bed and extended breastfeeding<br/>
(still nursing my 2 1/2 yo). Welcome to the list and the wonderful world of<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hello everybody.  I am new to this list and want to introduce myself.  My<br/>
&gt; name is Kandice and I have a total of 7 children between mine, his, and<br/>
&gt; ours.  They range in ages from 24 down to my 9 month old baby.<br/>
&gt; My four year old is very slow to grasp what seem like basic ideas so she<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; going to be quite a challenge for me.  I believe she is somewhat autistic<br/>
&gt; possibly.  My 13 and 11 year olds are much quicker.  In fact, the 11 year<br/>
&gt; old is gifted.<br/>
&gt; We started home-schooling last year and it has been a hard adjustment<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; years of public school.  I started out by having them do school type work<br/>
&gt; two - four hours a day and then freedom the rest of the day.  Through the<br/>
&gt; summer, we have only been doing two hours of subject work.  I just wanted<br/>
&gt; them to have the basic knowledge for the yearly testing and for their own<br/>
&gt; personal knowledge.<br/>
&gt; Now, I am strongly leaning towards the unschooling approach and am like a<br/>
&gt; fish out of water here.  I didn&#39;t even know home-school was an option<br/>
until<br/>
&gt; last year and felt like I was going so far against mainstream already.<br/>
But<br/>
&gt; I want to go even further!<br/>
&gt; Mainstream has just not been my thing.  I had the baby at home with a<br/>
&gt; midwife and choose not to vaccinate the kids after much research into it.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; am breastfeeding the 9 month old with no plans to stop any time soon.  And<br/>
&gt; we prefer a naturopath to a pediatritian any time!<br/>
&gt; I would very much enjoy being a midwife in the future when the young ones<br/>
&gt; are older and don&#39;t need me here so much.  Until then, I am not willing to<br/>
&gt; be on call to attend births and be away from the baby for who knows how<br/>
&gt; long.<br/>
&gt; I have a fantastic husband who backs me up in all of this natural living,<br/>
&gt; thankfully.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking forward to meeting you all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blessings to you,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kandice<br/>
&gt; If I could show you how to make $300-$800+ mo. part-time at home with no<br/>
selling, inventory,or huge<br/>
&gt; start-up cost, would you like to hear about it?   NOT Amway!  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458230879">Hi Kandice. Welcome to the list. You have definately come to  the right <br/>
place to learn about unschooling. This is a great list, lots of good people <br/>
who are out of that mainstream-I guess I much prefer floating along and <br/>
taking the time to watch the frogs and turtles than rowing like crazy to <br/>
keep up with all the other boats!<br/>
<br/>
I have 5 kids-ages 3 to 15, and we have been out of public school for 2 <br/>
years. It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out that we are unschoolers at <br/>
heart. This lifestyle has worked out wonderfully for us, we wouldn&#39;t have it <br/>
any other way.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
