<br/>
finally i&#39;m getting to respond to your email sorry it took me so long.<br/>
<br/>
they really wanted to have their kid be &quot;perfect&quot;.  OY OY OY.<br/>
i find the thoughts and judgments of others to be very loud and invasive<br/>
and i&#39;ve struggled with the expectations of others.  i  found it hard to<br/>
respond to situations the way i wanted to with this &#39;yammering&#39; in my<br/>
ears.  finally i just made a hard personal stand to let the judgments be<br/>
and just ignore them - this was very difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you mean play in general, not play to find a way to make<br/>
them give up their toys!  :)<br/>
absolutely as tempting as coercion maybe in the long run i believe it<br/>
undermines the child&#39;s ability to be trusting and honest - the ends<br/>
don&#39;t justify the means.<br/>
<br/>
A man at our Ethical culture meeting recently told a story about how he<br/>
found a little boy throwing rocks at a squirrel in a tree.  He was<br/>
internally appalled but then he asked the little boy *why* he was doing<br/>
it. The boy replied &quot;so I can get the squirrel to come down and I can<br/>
take care of him and have him as a pet.&quot;  Man.  That story has stayed<br/>
with me.  I always try to ask Annie (even at her age--I hope that it<br/>
will rub off) what she&#39;s trying to do when something happens that<br/>
surprises me.<br/>
<br/>
this is a great example of just how differently a child perceives his<br/>
own actions.  it&#39;s our responsibility to understand the perspective of<br/>
the child to help them learn to act and communicate just what they<br/>
intend.  it&#39;s not that we should let the child continue to &#39;throw rocks<br/>
at a squirrel in a tree&#39; but to help them find ways in which their goal<br/>
will be achieved (bring some food and water out and give the squirrel<br/>
some distance)<br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s a recent experience we&#39;ve had.   rene&#39; (4) is very physical.  he<br/>
likes to &#39;boink and be boinked :)  he&#39;s extremely exuberant and vocal<br/>
and we&#39;ve been &#39;struggling&#39; with getting him to understand that most<br/>
people are different from him and don&#39;t like being &#39;boinked&#39;.<br/>
intellectually he comprehends but he has yet to make this an instinctive<br/>
thing, so he spends lots of time saying he&#39;s sorry.   we&#39;ve tried<br/>
everything,  holding him, talking to him, removing him, spanking<br/>
him-nothing works.  so now i&#39;ve been asking him what he would need for<br/>
him to stop and he said, after sometime, that i needed to teach him<br/>
manners and that was my job.   i said i&#39;ve been trying but nothing seems<br/>
to work.  his reply was &#39; you need to be in my brain and stop me before<br/>
i do it&#39;.   my conclusion is that we all have our struggles and for some<br/>
fitting in and conforming to what is considered acceptable behavior is<br/>
their big hurdle.  so my job is not to force conformity but to point out<br/>
options and alternatives he could choose and be patient and loving - but<br/>
diligent.  for myself i needed to understand that often the answer is<br/>
not immediate or simple but developes over time.<br/>
<br/>
i realized his behavior was merely a reflection of his relationship to<br/>
the world and that that relationship was facilitated not only by me but<br/>
by his age and every other relationship he had.  what i needed to do was<br/>
to interpret what he was communication.<br/>
<br/>
This end-part sounds kind of like the ethical culture story...but I&#39;d<br/>
really appreciate it if you would say more on &quot;his behavior was a<br/>
reflection of his relationship to the world&quot;, either on- or off-list.<br/>
<br/>
 i find in my own life that if i&#39;m always being corrected or questioned<br/>
i spend most of my time and energy being defensive and virtually no<br/>
time  or energy becoming the kind of person that i want to be.  i think<br/>
we, culturally, size kids up (and their parents &#39;good kid=good<br/>
parent/bad kid=bad parent) and this, though often unspoken, is very much<br/>
felt and evokes a defensive attitude or perspective which detracts from<br/>
all relationships including the one we have with ourselves.   children<br/>
need to learn to understand and communicate what is happening inside<br/>
them so they can develop compassion and understanding for themselves and<br/>
others but if conformity is all we want then the individual is lost.<br/>
it&#39;s important for children to learn that they are part of something<br/>
bigger than themselves but that the self is the vehicle for the<br/>
manifestation of this understanding.   children need to separate<br/>
themselves and create an identity in a loving and compassionate<br/>
environment so that later they can be compassionate, understanding and<br/>
dynamic members of society.<br/>
<br/>
if a child experiences constant judgment and correction they begin to<br/>
see the world as merely a place of power - who has it and who doesn&#39;t.<br/>
but if we reflect a different sort of world - one where their desires<br/>
and opinions matter (i don&#39;t want to share) then later they will ask and<br/>
care what is happening to others (since their own needs were recognized)<br/>
and for me this is the basic component of community.<br/>
<br/>
my son knows that i have &#39;ultimate veto power&#39;  though he also knows i<br/>
never exercise this without completely hearing him out and if i do<br/>
&#39;veto&#39; something we discuss the reasons.  yes this process is long and<br/>
involved and i&#39;ve begun a discussion completely against something and<br/>
his stance has been compelling and i&#39;ve changed my position.  this<br/>
relationship is very fluid and though i do maintain a position of<br/>
authority, it is always in the context of trust and understanding.  if<br/>
he does not feel understood he will never trust me and then my authority<br/>
would be merely power and that, in my opinion, would not help him<br/>
develop into a strong contributing member of society nor a happy and<br/>
satisfied individual.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a very instructive story, especially in the health-situation I&#39;m<br/>
in right now. Thanks.<br/>
would you elaborate on your health situation.  i came down with an<br/>
autoimmune disease, still&#39;s disease (believed to be vaccine related),<br/>
when rene&#39; was 20 months old and it has radically changed our lives.<br/>
