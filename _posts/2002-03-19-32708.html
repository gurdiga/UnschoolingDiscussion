<div id="ygrps-yiv-68756308">I have been getting a sensation that there was something about the Holt <br/>
discussion on definitions of unschooling that I was really uncomfortable <br/>
with. I just realized what it is. John Holt was a terrific advocate for <br/>
unschooling and wrote some great books, but ultimately I don&#39;t look to his <br/>
work as an authority on what unschooling is. It seems to me that focusing on <br/>
what John did or did not say in his works as a mantra or dogma we should <br/>
follow is giving away our own power. I may be fumbling my words here. . . but <br/>
let me try again. I have read probably just about everything written on <br/>
unschooling. .. from a variety of authors. I have participated in many <br/>
discussions in real life and online about unschooling. John&#39;s words and books <br/>
have great value but so do many other sources. To rely too heavily on what he <br/>
said or didn&#39;t say seems to fly in the face of what he himself would <br/>
advocate. The simplest definition would be the best. I like Lynda&#39;s idea of <br/>
asking the young people. Because we have such a tremendous influence on them <br/>
as parents, we will probably find some of our words coming back at us in ways <br/>
we never thought of saying them. I think most of us would probably agree that <br/>
individual(child) led learning is unschooling in its purest or simplest form. <br/>
Anthing beyond that is individuals putting their own interpretation of what <br/>
that might look like in their own family. Anyway, just some ramblings while I <br/>
can&#39;t sleep. I would be anxious to hear what all of the other young people in <br/>
your families would say to the question of &quot;what does unschooling mean to <br/>
you&quot;?<br/>

I walked into the dining room, where the three young people in our family were busy illustrating and cutting out all sorts of different puzzles they created...and I asked them &quot;what does unschooling mean to you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Reply:  &quot;Not DOING school!  An unleashing...like when you take a leash off a dog...we&#39;re FREE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even the youngest person said,&quot;FWEE!!!&quot; and giggled. ;-)<br/>

&quot;We could learn a lot from crayons...some are sharp, some are dull, some are pretty, some have weird names, and they are all different colors, but they all have to learn to live in the same box.&quot;<br/>
