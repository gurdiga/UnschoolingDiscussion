It is a gathering of some of the folks on the leading edge of educational<br/>
thought and action. . . like Joseph Chilton Pearce, Peggy O&#39;Mara, Jerry<br/>
Mintz, and many many more. SPIRIT OF LEARNING - SOUL IN EDUCATION The goal<br/>

soul on such a deep level. Maybe I&#39;ll see some of you here on Kauai in<br/>
October!<br/>
Sending much aloha,<br/>
