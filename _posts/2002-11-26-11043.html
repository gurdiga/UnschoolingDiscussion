&lt;&lt; (  What is on Oprah tomorrow? Rather, why are Mary and her daughter <br/>
 going to be on? Unschooling on Oprah?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wish it was on unschooling!! :)<br/>
Nah, it&#39;s about body image and self esteem and such. There is supposed to be <br/>
a two minute segment that they shot in Mary&#39;s home. So we&#39;ll get to meet her <br/>
up close and in person...sorta.<br/>
I wonder if homeschooling will even get mentioned?  Don&#39;t forget to check out <br/>
the Oxygen channel for after the show stuff.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
