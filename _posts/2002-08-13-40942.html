&gt; Subject: Re: Ned&#39;s recent unschooling post<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks Ned, for a post that was (mostly) about unschooling and (partly)<br/>
&gt; tactful.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one has ever accused me of being tactful before . . . :-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; There&#39;s not much to unschooling, really. Until a kid is about seven, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; parenting, anyway, it&#39;s not even un-anything.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mean the following question seriously, and I&#39;m not being nasty.  But<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s so special about seven?  Why 7?  Why not 9 or 5 or 14?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>C&#39;mon, I said &quot;about seven.&quot;  I agree.  Why any age, really. I agree that<br/>
unschooling begins as parents prepare to have a child, and continues for<br/>
life. Unschooling is another way, perhaps, of saying &quot;self-governing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;About seven&quot; is when most children&#39;s cognitive senses are fairly well<br/>
coordinated with their physical abilities. I took a course in child<br/>
development in which it was told that many children simply are not able to<br/>
coordinate their eyes with their hands and their brains until they are about<br/>
8.  Before that age, for instance, they might actually &quot;write&quot; by drawing in<br/>
small circular motions in one spot on a page because they have no concept of<br/>
what writing is for yet, but see it only as making marks on paper, and have<br/>
no real sense about reading yet, either. (Nature does not program those<br/>
skills into them, they need to be learned, or acquired through their<br/>
intellect)<br/>
<br/>
The lesson was that many children are simply not physically capable of doing<br/>
&quot;schoolwork&quot; until their bodies catch up with their minds. The obvious<br/>
question comes to mind then is, Why do we put them in schools (now at 3 or 4<br/>
! !) and force them to do what many are physically incapable of doing, and,<br/>
incidentally but equally important, what most have no interest in or need<br/>
for? The answer is that those activities provide jobs for adults, and<br/>
baby-sitting for working parents. Evidence points to NO benefits for the<br/>
kids. Kids still need, at those early stages, to explore the world on their<br/>
own terms as much as possible. That means free play and interaction with as<br/>
little interference as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, this state (CT) considered school-age to be 6 - 17. I suppose<br/>
the reason was that most people used to believe that children did not need<br/>
schooling until they were physically and emotionally ready to do school<br/>
stuff. That has changed, unfortunately for many kids, because the kids have<br/>
not. Early schooling can damage them in two ways: it puts them in an<br/>
unnatural setting doing unnatural things, and it deprives them of what they<br/>
truly need in order to develop well.<br/>
<br/>
When kids get to be about seven, they often find their own reasons to read,<br/>
write, and cipher. Those things help them get a life of their own -- some<br/>
independence -- they understand that those concepts are tools they can use,<br/>
and they are excited by what they can do with them. Conversely, if they<br/>
don&#39;t acquire those skills, their parents become anxious, and start fretting<br/>
and cajoling, even teaching.  It takes an unusually relaxed parent (a<br/>
supremely confident unschooler) to simply wait until a child shows an<br/>
interest in reading and calculating, especially after the child reaches<br/>
&quot;school-age&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 I agree with you, Brenda, that there is no certain age that should<br/>
determine anything when it comes to child development. Age-grading is what<br/>
schools do entirely for the convenience and purposes of the school -- they<br/>
are cutting cookies, not educating individuals. Parents need simply to be<br/>
watchful, engaged - but not to an extreme, available to help in the way it<br/>
is requested - but not hovering, and with lots of assurances for the child<br/>
that s/he is OK exactly the way s/he is.  Disney&#39;s key is providing exactly<br/>
that for  people -- REASSURANCE.<br/>

much freer we could be, and my question was, Can you imagine that?<br/>
