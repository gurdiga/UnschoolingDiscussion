WILL AND JADA OPT TO HOMESCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN  <br/>
<br/>
Hollywood couple WILL and JADA PINKETT SMITH have<br/>
decided to<br/>
homeschool their children, because they&#39;re unimpressed<br/>
with<br/>
America&#39;s educational system.<br/>
<br/>
The ALI co-stars have six-year-old son JADEN, daughter<br/>
WILLOW, four,<br/>
TREY, 12, Will&#39;s son from his first marriage and<br/>
Will&#39;s nephew KYLE,<br/>
15, in their care. And all children but Trey are<br/>
currently<br/>
homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Jada tells ESSENCE magazine, &quot;(They are homeschooled)<br/>
for<br/>
flexibility, so they can stay with us when we travel,<br/>
and also<br/>
because the school system in this country - public and<br/>
private is<br/>
designed for the industrial age.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re in a technological age. We don&#39;t want our kids<br/>
to memorize.<br/>
We want them to learn.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000712108">Do you think they&#39;re homeschooled, or privately tutored?  It&#39;s<br/>
Picket-Smith&#39;s pharsing that made me think this.<br/>
