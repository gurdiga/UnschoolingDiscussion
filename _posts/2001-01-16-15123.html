<div id="ygrps-yiv-935629180">Hello,<br/>
I am pretty new here.  I have been lurking for a couple of weeks.  My <br/>
husband and I have 5 children.  We have been home schooling about 8 <br/>
years now.  Our two older daughters are 17 and 15.  They were in <br/>
public school through 2nd and 4th grades.  They are our daughters by <br/>
birth.  We have 3 young children who we adopted.  Our son was 4 in <br/>
November.  He came home at 11 days old, our youngest daughter will be <br/>
4 next month she came home at 2 weeks old - she has Downs syndrome, <br/>
our youngest son came home at 15 days old and he is now 2 1/2 he has <br/>
Downs was born crack addicted and has FAS.  <br/>
<br/>
Our older daughters have done more of a traditional curriculum with <br/>
books and tests and such.  It just seemed easier to do it that way <br/>
since that was what they were used too.  It has worked out well.  I <br/>
am looking at options for schooling our youngest ones.  Our son who <br/>
is 4 seems to be very bright.  He does not have any special needs but <br/>
the younger two have Downs and are very delayed.  <br/>
<br/>
Can I unschool with these children?  How do I do it?  Is anyone else <br/>
unschooling a child with the kinds of special needs my two children <br/>
have?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

Welcome! I have no BTDT with schooling special needs children, but I&#39;m sure<br/>
you&#39;ll find plenty of wisdom and ideas here. I think unschooling will be a<br/>
perfect fit for your two youngest children since it&#39;ll give them the freedom<br/>
to learn and explore in a supportive, relaxed environment which is something<br/>
they may have a hard time finding in ps.<br/>

<br/>
My son is also 4 yrs. old, he would be considered special needs, he didn&#39;t<br/>
really talk until he was about 3 1/2 y.o., and he has hypotonia &<br/>
hypermobile joints causing motor delays.  He appears to be bright and<br/>
creative, but he has been labeled &#39;slow&#39; and &#39;clumsy&#39;, and severely delayed<br/>
by so called experts.  Fortunately we found new experts who were more open<br/>
minded, and we followed our intuition which now appears to be paying off.<br/>
I&#39;m obviously new to this too, so I don&#39;t have any advice.  We do most of<br/>
the PT/OT therapy at home (or at the Y) ourselves, though we did start<br/>
working with a speech therapy program at the local University when Graham<br/>
started to talk- he enjoys it very much, so it has worked out well, it&#39;s a<br/>
group situation working in a &#39;natural&#39; setting instead of the typical<br/>
therapy sessions.  At this point we are concentrating on incorporating<br/>
ST/PT/OT type work in play settings that he is interested in.  We do a<br/>
special needs swim class at the Y, and open gym time, both of which he<br/>
loves.  We also plan to try hippotherapy this Spring instead of more<br/>
traditional OT work.  So far this is working for us, and I wish you the best<br/>
with your family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800374863">Just thought I would poke my head in here and say hello.  Our tribe <br/>
lives on 40 acres in the hill country of TX. We are a working farm <br/>
with sheep, goats, milk cow, chickens, geese, turkeys ect.  We raise <br/>
the majority of our own food. <br/>
We have two children 2  and 4 years old.<br/>
WE are just beginning to think about schooling at all.  But I am very <br/>
attracted to unschooling. There are so many natural opportunities for <br/>
the kids to learn as they watch and help us that it seems ridiculous <br/>
to sit them down and &#39;do&#39; projects.  Anyway I look forward to hearing <br/>
and sharing ideas that work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233861095">Hi everyone,<br/>
I joined your list today and am amazed by the variety of things I have come across here already :)<br/>
I am a new to homeschooling, this is the first year for us. The more I read the more I think unschooling is the way to go. I am very interested to hear more about it as I eavesdrop on your conversations here.<br/>
Looking forward to getting to know you all,<br/>

  &gt; We were never talking about &quot;a fundamental Christian view.&quot;  We <br/>
  were talking <br/>
  &gt; about fundamentalist Christians.  If you&#39;re unsure of the <br/>
  difference, please <br/>
  &gt; take a time out and familiarize yourself.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &quot;Fundamentalist Christian&quot; does mean fanatic, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
<br/>
  If a fundamentalist Christian is someone who adheres to the <br/>
  fundamentals of Christianity, then I am a fundamentalist.  If a <br/>
  Christian fanatic is someone who is a big fan of Christ, I don&#39;t mind <br/>
  being a fanatic.  I do mind being called a fanatic if by fanatic you <br/>
  mean someone who is irrational.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; It&#39;s not hard to go online, using www.google.com if you want, or <br/>
  just poke <br/>
  &gt; from one Christian homeschooling site to another for a while, and <br/>
  find that <br/>
  &gt; unschooling will be characterized as neglect, as leaving children <br/>
  to be <br/>
  &gt; raised by themselves, as giving children the rule in the home (a <br/>
  sin), and so <br/>
  &gt; forth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I think that many Christians just don&#39;t understand completely what <br/>
  unschooling is.  I think that Christians (and people in general) <br/>
  think that unschoolers just don&#39;t do anything with their kids all day <br/>
  and let their kids run wild.  They don&#39;t understand that we spend a <br/>
  lot of time doing stuff with them all day long and have a huge <br/>
  influence in their lives because we are so close to them.  <br/>
<br/>
  But just because Abeka and Bob Jones are more popular than <br/>
  unschooling among fundamental Christians doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>
  unschooling is something that fundamentalist Christians can&#39;t do.  I <br/>
  am a fundamentalist Christian and an unschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
  It is very possible to believe in a young earth, in a literal 6 24 <br/>
  hour day creation, and to believe in salvation only Jesus Christ and <br/>
  still unschool.  <br/>
