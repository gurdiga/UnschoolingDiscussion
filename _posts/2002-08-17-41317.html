<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bob,  and others :-),  have you read any of C.S. Lewis? . Lewis uses  logic, <br/>
&gt; similar to the above,  to explain Christianity - not  necessarily religion <br/>
&gt; - in his book &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. Lewis was C of E and definitely not <br/>
&gt; Fundamentalist. His book is  a compilation of his understandings as a <br/>
&gt; Christian, using logic and clear simple terms..Leonie<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminded me of my entrance into &quot;homeschooling&quot;. I went to the first <br/>
meeting of the neighborhood homeschool group, &quot;Southeast Area Family <br/>
Educators&quot;---sounds &quot;SAFE&quot; enough, huh?<br/>
<br/>
At this &quot;meeting of the moms&quot;, we discussed field trips, curricula, and other <br/>
yawners. Then we had a &quot;test&quot;. Hmmmmm. We were asked how long we had <br/>
homeschooled, how many children we had, their ages, our favorite color, etc. <br/>
Then we were asked to name our favorite Christian author and our favorite <br/>
Christian artist.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if the light were dim earlier, it was shining brightly now!  <br/>
<br/>
So I feebly wrote in CS Lewis for my Favorite Christian author (as he is the <br/>
ONLY one I knew!). I had to leave the favorite Christian artist blank because <br/>
I couldn&#39;t even think of a ONE---Picasso? Michelangelo? Van Gogh? Chagall? <br/>
Warhol? Peter Max??? I left it blank. Little did I know they meant MUSICAL <br/>
artist!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Had to draw the line at the request to sign a statement of faith.<br/>
