and respect you all have for your kids (as I do with mine).<br/>

&lt;&lt;I read a lot and <br/>
lately keep coming across blog posts and  articles and pictures that are <br/>
so disrespectful to children that I&#39;m  rendered speechless.&gt;&gt;<br/>
This reminds me of something I saw recently.  I sometimes  browse freebie <br/>
boards (for anyone who is unfamiliar, these are blogs/boards  where people post <br/>
links to free samples of products, etc.)  Anyhoo, there  was a freebie listing <br/>
recently for a bumper sticker that read &quot;Please Don&#39;t  Spank.&quot;  I&#39;ll have you <br/>
know that there were pages and pages on this blog  about all of the spoiled, <br/>
rotten children that would be running around if people  listened to this <br/>
advice.  People actually got so hostile that they were  angry with the original <br/>
poster for even listing the item.  All these moms  could talk about was how proud <br/>
they were that they spanked their kids.   Sad.  And you know, the kids <br/>
probably think very little of it.  I was  regularly spanked as a child.  I wasn&#39;t <br/>
beaten, and I truly believe that my  parents&#39; intention was to raise me right.  I <br/>
think that they did what they  thought parents should do for the welfare of <br/>
their children.  I can&#39;t  recall the number of times that my father said that <br/>
if he didn&#39;t love me, he  would never spank me, because he wouldn&#39;t care what I <br/>
did.  Spanking was a  sign of love in their minds.  Sigh.  I actually <br/>
believed that as a  child.  I hated spankings, but understood them to be a loving  <br/>
gesture.  What a crock!!!  I am so glad that I have chosen to follow  my <br/>
instincts and show my son &quot;love&quot; by &quot;loving&quot; him, not hitting him.  It&#39;s  really <br/>
great to be able to connect with like-minded parents who put their  children <br/>
first, who aren&#39;t afraid to challenge conventional thinking.   Thank you to <br/>
everyone who makes this list so nice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977989190">Hi, Janet<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have to say I love this group even though, strictly speaking, <br/>
I&#39;m not a radical unschooler myself.<br/>
<br/>
You might be interested in my online newsletter Parental Intelligence. <br/>
www.parental-intelligence.com<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s free for anyone to read, highly idiosyncratic and on the side of <br/>
real parenting not that child management cr*p.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the free e-books &#39;Guiding Stars of the New Parenting Movement&#39; <br/>
(scroll down a little way on the left side of the home page for the <br/>
links). <br/>
