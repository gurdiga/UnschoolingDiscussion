<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s the rule of fate. If something goes wrong, then you are a bad parent <br/>
and you will be charged. If nothing goes wrong, you won&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
- RICHARD WEXLER, director a children&#39;s advocacy group, who has compiled<br/>
research on children left home alone.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
From the story: <br/>
       . . .The Child Trends researchers found that higher-income children <br/>
between 6 and 9 were actually more likely than poor children to be left <br/>
unsupervised for several hours, even after controlling for the fact that the <br/>
better-off parents were more likely to have jobs. <br/>
<br/>
       The authors of the report, &quot;Left Unsupervised: A Look at the Most <br/>
Vulnerable Children,&quot; warned that leaving children under 13 routinely on their own <br/>
may put them at risk for injuries and developmental problems. But they also <br/>
hedged, writing: &quot;Self care is not always harmful. Children typically become <br/>
more independent as they mature, gradually spending more and more time alone and <br/>
taking increasing amounts of responsibility.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       When unsupervised children become notorious, the legal system may feel <br/>
<br/>
extra pressure to hold parents accountable, even when the case did not end in <br/>
tragedy. . .Yet in other strikingly similar cases, parents were not <br/>
prosecuted. . . <br/>
<br/>
       Professor Lareau said that among the well-off families she followed <br/>
for her new book, &quot;Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race and Family Life (University <br/>
of California Press, 2003), were a pair on an out-of-town trip to a soccer <br/>
championship who left two 10-year-olds, two 8-year-olds and a 5-year-old alone in <br/>
a hotel room while the two sets of parents went out to dinner a mile away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       They left the kids with cell phones, pizzas and videos saying to each <br/>
other, `They&#39;ll turn us in,&#39; &quot; she recalled. The children did not turn them <br/>
in, however, and no fire broke out. <br/>
