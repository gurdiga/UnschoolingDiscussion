<div id="ygrps-yiv-72107567">We moved to the Kentucky side of the Cincinnati area<br/>
last year, from SE Missouri, but I grew up in St.<br/>
Louis and have lived in five states now.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;ve never allowed my girls to do anything<br/>
to their hair except keep it healthy.  Not even<br/>
pony-tails, or metal barrettes because they break the<br/>
hair.  We stick to braids and plastic clipped buns. At<br/>
18 they can do as they wish, so now my 23-yr-old has<br/>
bleached and permed hair.  I do her hair to keep her<br/>
from going to someone else who may not be as careful. <br/>
The 13-yr-old has hair so long I have to trim it now<br/>
and then to keep her from sitting on it.  My reasoning<br/>
for the avoidance of perms, especially at a young age,<br/>
is the effect of the chemicals on skin, hair, and<br/>
possibly eyes and lungs.  Young hair is more delicate<br/>
than on a mature person, the perm chemicals burn it<br/>
more easily.  Long hair doesn&#39;t take a perm well,<br/>
anyway, because it ends up so thick on the curlers. <br/>
If you ruin short hair with a perm, a severe trim<br/>
isn&#39;t so traumatic as with long hair.  For a little<br/>
thrill you might just try curling her hair with a<br/>
gentler method, like sponge rollers.  It&#39;s so much<br/>
trouble, though, she might just appreciate her own<br/>
look a little more.     <br/>
