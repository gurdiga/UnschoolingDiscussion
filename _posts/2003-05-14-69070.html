<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126610">Last night, after a long tiring day trip and a few tense family <br/>
moments, I was laying in bed with my 8 and 10 yo sons. At the <br/>
moment when my oldest was about to fall asleep he had an interesting <br/>
thing to say out of the blue. Something like &quot;sometimes I wish you <br/>
just put me in school when I was 5 like everyone else, and we never <br/>
even knew about homeschooling, and then I&#39;d be normal.&quot; <br/>
My first reaction was heart-sinking panic (these words have been my <br/>
worst homeschooling-related nightmare since he was five and didn&#39;t <br/>
go to school), but I covered it up pretty well and tried to respond <br/>
rationally and explore with him why he felt that way.<br/>
We talked about how he&#39;s free to try school any time he wants to, <br/>
but that didn&#39;t satisfy him much since a.) he&#39;s already tasted <br/>
comlete freedom and knows that it&#39;s a hard act to follow, and b.) he <br/>
feels like it&#39;s a culture he doesn&#39;t understand and would stick out <br/>
like a sore thumb if he did go. My 8yo then piped up and said that <br/>
he *wants* to go to school but he&#39;s afraid that he&#39;ll look stupid <br/>
since he can&#39;t really read yet and struggles with handwriting. <br/>
(He&#39;s aware that he knows more than other kids in *other* areas but <br/>
this doesn&#39;t help much when he pictures himself in a school setting.)<br/>
<br/>
We left the conversation open, but I&#39;m sure it will come up again <br/>
today, and I&#39;m trying very hard to not get too emotional and <br/>
override their opinions and desires with my own. I&#39;m also trying <br/>
not to let my pride get in the way. (Oh my God, the &quot;I told you <br/>
so&quot;s that would fly if certain family members overheard that <br/>
conversation!)<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else gone through this? I should point out that we live <br/>
in a small town where everyone goes to school, including their best <br/>
friends. Philosophically I&#39;m an unschooler at heart, so it pains me <br/>
to even be thinking about these things.<br/>
I&#39;m totally okay with not being &quot;normal&quot;, but apparently it&#39;s <br/>
something that bothers my children sometimes. Their drive to be <br/>
part of their immediate community is strong enough to override all <br/>
of the &quot;you&#39;re so lucky&quot; comments they get from schooled friends. <br/>
I need some new insights here.<br/>
