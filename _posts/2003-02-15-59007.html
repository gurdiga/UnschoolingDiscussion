<div id="ygrps-yiv-34117479">I&#39;d really like to come to the conference this year, and I&#39;m hoping<br/>
ya&#39;ll can give me some info that&#39;ll help get me there :0).  Jon&#39;s been<br/>
out of work since last April, so going would be a big splurge.  He&#39;s<br/>
said it&#39;s up to me, and he&#39;ll go happily if I decide we&#39;re going (we<br/>
travel as a pack :0)) but I don&#39;t want to bring him and have him<br/>
miserable the whole weekend.  So, what I need to know is, did spouses<br/>
who have no idea who you all are have a good time at the conference too?<br/>
He completely &#39;gets&#39; unschooling and he&#39;s not shy - I think he&#39;d have<br/>
fun.  What say ye? ~Rue<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.&quot;<br/>

inclusive, fun group.<br/>

while I spent more time listening to speakers but he did get to talk with <br/>
other dads and watch the boys interact with other children that think like <br/>
they do.  He wants to go again.<br/>

<br/>
Second weekend in September, as close as I know.    When it&#39;s wholly <br/>
announced I&#39;ll bring the lnk here.   But for now, there are photos of the intended <br/>
site and of things around there (with Holly and Marty in for scale &lt;g&gt;), and also <br/>
links to people&#39;s photos from the conference in St. Louis.<br/>

<br/>
ABQ is the airline code for Albuquerque, which is why I used abq.   It&#39;s the <br/>
quickest-to-write abbreviation.<br/>
