<div id="ygrps-yiv-411892617">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I have an explore as well.  He&#39;s also a builder.  He&#39;s done food<br/>
coloring, baking soda & vinegar and numerous cardbourd box constructions<br/>
(fortunately we have a basement to put them {pile them}).  I have a<br/>
messy house.  Our &quot;rule&quot; is pick some things up before you take out<br/>
others.  We also will do a ten minute pick up.  Of late we&#39;ve decided<br/>
that the parent who is home with our son is in &quot;charge&quot; of making sure<br/>
&quot;everything&quot; is picked up before the other one comes home.   The actual<br/>
bottem line is - enough has to be picked up so you don&#39;t trip over it.<br/>
All of us our pack rats all well, which came in handy this Yule while<br/>
making presents.   Instead of buying many things we try and make it -<br/>
and usually have what we need at home.  With friends with cat allergies<br/>
and my own home based business with monthly meetings we are force to<br/>
clean (vacumn) at least a couple times a month.  LET&#39;S HEAR IT FOR MESSY<br/>
CREATIVE HOUSES!<br/>
