*This program has perfomed and illegal operation*<br/>
It only happens on this Group - but happens 2-3 times during the time <br/>
it takes me to read all the messages.  <br/>

TV.  As a child I was an avid Tv watcher - but it did not dull my <br/>
imagination.  We would go out and play *Wagon Train*  *The <br/>
Buccaneers* and *Brave Eagle* - now that IS giving away my age!!!<br/>

***The only time this happens to me is when I have too much junk stored. I<br/>
delete all messages (sent, received, etc) and dump my deleted file. That<br/>
usually clears it up. (oh, then I shut the machine down and start<br/>
over...this helps for some reason)<br/>

Dh went to see Hannibal with a friend the other week.  <br/>
Said friend told dh that he&#39;d have to have a chat with <br/>
his son (9 or 10yo) cos he&#39;d found him watching <br/>
American Pie...  Dh told me this while we were watching <br/>
American Pie...  &#39;Umm,&#39; I said, &#39;good on &#39;im!&#39;  At <br/>
least he&#39;ll know it&#39;s not a one-way street *grin*<br/>
