<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889731239">&quot;I was trying to<br/>
discuss the idea of grading, and the futility of being upset about grades<br/>
once you decide to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&quot;<br/>
I had just been deleting the whole subject.  I&#39;m glad I stop to see this<br/>
one. Okay, My own sons have never gone through grades and tests. For them<br/>
learning does not require these degrading  process.  But I, and DH and the<br/>
grandparents, Aunts, uncle etc... were all conditioned from this placement<br/>
system. I look at my sons and see how much less negative baggage they carry<br/>
with them (two are 15, one is 10). So I understand easily that unschooling<br/>
has been beneficial.  But how do I explain to the rest of the world?  How do<br/>
YOU do it? ( It&#39;s an open question by the way)<br/>
