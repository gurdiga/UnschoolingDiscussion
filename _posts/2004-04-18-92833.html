But what about discipline?What most people mean when they ask about <br/>
discipline is not the external system of punishment and rewards, but of an internal <br/>
understanding of self discipline. Jumping through onerous academic hoops will not <br/>
necessarily lead to self discipline. Our children gain a sense of how <br/>
important self discipline is by watching us. Our ability to model a self disciplined <br/>
life is much more powerful than handing in book reports in time. Helping <br/>
children reach their own goals will mean there will be plenty of opportunities to <br/>
discuss stick-to-itiveness, follow through, and how sometimes it&#39;s worth doing <br/>
the things that are no fun in order to reach the desired goal. These lessons <br/>
have much more meaning when they are in conjuction with goals the children set <br/>
for themselves. <br/>
