<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240852738">He has green marker all over his face, brown in his hair.<br/>
He has serious garlic breath going on.<br/>
He has watched his Dr. Seuss&#39;s ABC video at least 53 times today.<br/>
He has made me read the book at least 54 times.<br/>
He is now reading it to himself.<br/>
He has abandoned the Animal ABC video THANK GOD THANK GOD.<br/>
He managed to run around outside all day without getting any splinters.<br/>
He is dog tired and I know he&#39;s going straight to sleep tonight.<br/>
He has eaten all the croutons out of my salad.<br/>
He never stops trying to catch bugs, even after hours of failure.<br/>
He likes our yard better, even though the neighbors have a sandbox.<br/>
He painted my shins today.<br/>
He fed the goldfish way too much today.<br/>
He fed the dog, one kibble at a time, with many trips, straight into its <br/>
mouth.<br/>
He drank half a cup of abandoned coffee when I wasn&#39;t looking, then <br/>
immediately went down for a nap.<br/>
He has no idea that I have anything else to do in a day except play.<br/>
He sings &quot;Q-R-S&quot; extra high, with eyebrows raised.<br/>
He said please a few times today.<br/>
<br/>
Is it normal to have this feeling that if the child changes at all, even one <br/>
little bit, you&#39;ll just die of sorrow, because you&#39;re so completely <br/>
infatuated with the way they are this very minute? Today was almost <br/>
painfully great. He is learning so much, every second, it&#39;s all I can do to <br/>
just keep up, let alone push. I can see the brain changing every day -- I <br/>
feel like his baby clock is ticking down and I&#39;m going to wake up and find <br/>
he&#39;s a little boy. Nooooo!!!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
LILY<br/>

Me too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll preface a story with &quot;One time Baby Marty...&quot; to a full group or to <br/>
Holly or someone, instead of &quot;When Marty were little,&quot; especially if Marty&#39;s <br/>
in the group.<br/>
<br/>
When they&#39;re sick, especially, they&#39;ve all liked to hear stories of when they <br/>
were little--things they&#39;ve forgotten or were to little to catch a memory of. <br/>
 And I&#39;ll tell them how much I loved this or that about them, but from my <br/>
point of view it IS like a different person.  And at that moment I&#39;m loving <br/>
the baby Kirby AND the Kirby who is bigger than I am.<br/>
<br/>
My half brother is not a nice adult at all.  But he was an angelic baby and <br/>
toddler, and I still remember very, very fondly being with him and helping <br/>
him then.  I was 19 through early 20&#39;s during those years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197740629">Yeah. :)<br/>
<br/>
I love my kids just the way they are right this very minute. But I really <br/>
really miss some of the kids that used to live here.  :-/  There was a 2yo <br/>
boy who would happily dig in the dirt for what seemed like hours and then <br/>
suddenly, realizing his hands were dirty, scream to get them washed.  There <br/>
was a 4yo girl who could spend hours oh so carefully applying paint to paper. <br/>
A 12yo boy who would happily capture the garter snakes that kept getting into <br/>
the house and release them in the hills. A 5yo girl who spent whole <br/>
afternoons dancing and singing up and down the sidewalk, entertaining the <br/>
neighbors. :) And many more....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to see the end of my very last little girl (almost 10), she&#39;s <br/>
being pushed out by hips and breasts and a sudden height increase that&#39;s made <br/>
her significantly taller than her twin brother for the first time in their <br/>
lives. She&#39;s not entirely thrilled about it yet. She&#39;s spent a lot of time <br/>
telling me she doesn&#39;t want to be a grownup yet and being reassured that her <br/>
changing body doesn&#39;t mean she has to change anything else she doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to. And my big girl (17) is going to be off on her own in Manhattan for most <br/>
of the summer, so it seems to be a year of big changes for all us girls.<br/>
