<div id="ygrps-yiv-482537142">Just an aside as I was passin&#39; through on the whole stifle ourselves vs. <br/>
shock society quibble...<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were in public doing something I didn&#39;t mind, but that most <br/>
folks would find unsettling, I&#39;d quietly tell them, &quot;Honey, That&#39;s not <br/>
socially appropriate.  I need you to not do that right now, okay?&quot;  Actual <br/>
canned words they heard from toddlerhood on up.<br/>
<br/>
They knew that the phrase meant I could care less if they were (for <br/>
example) peeing on a tree (at age 4 after having come back from camping <br/>
back-country), but that the other parents and kids at the playground might <br/>
not be able to handle seeing it and that peeing on trees is something <br/>
generally not done in polite company.  They figured out what was/not <br/>
socially acceptable without impacting their ability to continue the actions <br/>
in appropriate circumstances or when the public wasn&#39;t around to be shocked.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out to be a nice way to let the kid know about immediate social <br/>
niceties without making them feel an eedjit.<br/>
Worked for us.<br/>

<br/>
Our canned phrase here was &quot;Some people don&#39;t like it when you do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then they got a real explanation.   Because it&#39;s illegal when adults do <br/>
it (like peeing on a tree or running in the front yard naked), or they think <br/>
it&#39;s a sin (bad words), or they will think you&#39;re not a nice person (various).   <br/>
<br/>
Those are some really good discussions.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve known since they knew anything that there are places to pee and <br/>
places NOT to pee.  Same with nose picking, penis-touching, dirty-joke telling, <br/>
dirty-song singing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It surprises me to read here that some adults seem not to understanding it, <br/>
since my kids never had any trouble seeing it clearly and simply.<br/>

I think this is all great advice. I just spoke with Joseph about something<br/>
he was doing when he would get frustrated with someone. Told him how it&#39;s<br/>
not that big of a deal to us, but friends will probably not want to be<br/>
around someone who seems like they get so annoyed with them. He understood<br/>
and didn&#39;t get upset about it. I try to point things out like that to my<br/>
kids whenever it comes up. I think it&#39;s important for  people to understand<br/>
how others feel about things as well as them being in touch with their own<br/>
feelings.<br/>
