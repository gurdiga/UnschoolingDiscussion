<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391600793">I&#39;m so behind.  I have a couple hundred e-mails to read so forgive me<br/>
addressing something that&#39;s long gone.<br/>
I&#39;ve had a little wine too and so whatever I say probably won&#39;t make any<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was wondering about kids and chores and how it all fits into<br/>
unschooling.   I think you can compare it to the way kids learn to read.<br/>
They see us reading for pleasure and for information.   We read to them<br/>
when they want us to.   We make sure we provide lots of reading materials<br/>
for them to mess around with.  <br/>
<br/>
What if they see us taking care of our homes for pleasure ( because a<br/>
clean kitchen is more peaceful than a messy one)  and for necessity. ( we<br/>
need clean clothes)   What if we do things for them, pick up toys, find<br/>
missing shoes, etc.   What if we let them help when they&#39;re little and<br/>
interested, letting them do just as much as they want and not expecting<br/>
more?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it really the same?<br/>
<br/>
I think a kid would be pretty stupid to jump up and clean joyously if a<br/>
parent has made it well known that cleaning is an unpleasant and<br/>
miserable chore.    I think, however hard it might be, we need to do<br/>
things for our family happily if we hope for them to do things happily<br/>
for us.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a perfect house keeper.  I let a lot of things wait.   But when I<br/>
clean I try to be pleasant about it, to think of it as a benefit to my<br/>
family and not as a hardship for me.   If I really hate a thing and can&#39;t<br/>
do it happily I wait until everyone&#39;s outside or at the store somewhere<br/>
and do it then and grumble if I have to.   I wouldn&#39;t ever expect my kid<br/>
to be happily willing to do some job I was forever bitching about.  <br/>
<br/>
So, you shouldn&#39;t eat off my floor, and I almost always have cob webs<br/>
somewhere or other, but I also have a child who will take the garbage out<br/>
when he notices it&#39;s full and sometimes does dishes just because they&#39;re<br/>
there.   I think that&#39;s better than a perfectly clean house with a kid<br/>
who has assigned chores.   Yes, there is a world of possibilities between<br/>
those two scenarios, but this one fits easily with my other thoughts on<br/>
unschooling.   For the same reasons I don&#39;t assign reading or math I<br/>
don&#39;t assign dishes or laundry.  <br/>
<br/>
I know not everyone agrees on this.  The truth is kids who have reading<br/>
lessons mostly do learn how to read.  Kids who have math lessons do learn<br/>
how to add and subtract.   Kids who are made to do chores do know how to<br/>
wash toilets and mop.    It comes down to which is the natural way for<br/>
kids to learn and grow.<br/>
If you happen to think natural learning is healthier it seems only<br/>
reasonable to look at all of life as natural learning.<br/>

You said some of this stuff in a different way than I&#39;ve heard it (read it) <br/>
before.  I&#39;m saving it.  I should start a page of justifications for <br/>
loosening up on chores and related matters.  I&#39;ll quote all the wisest moms <br/>
around.<br/>

very right about not asking others to do what you wouldn&#39;t do!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This post made wonderful sense.  The subject of chores has come up on <br/>
the Canadian list again, and even among the unschoolers there, chores <br/>
seem to be a given.  Your post says it so well, would you mind my <br/>
forwarding it to that list for discussion?  I could leave your name <br/>
on or off, as you prefer.<br/>

I don&#39;t mind at all.  Use it however you like.  I&#39;ll trust your judgement<br/>
about that list whether they&#39;d find the wine slurping part adds to the<br/>
credibility or not. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

rakes and shovels......because it&#39;s FUN!!!  It&#39;s chores that suck.<br/>
