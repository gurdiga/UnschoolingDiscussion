<div id="ygrps-yiv-3698845">What if the list was set under GROUP SETTINGS : RELPIES GO TO THE AUTHOR<br/>
OF THE MESSAGE.<br/>
That way the bantering is kept to a very low. Those who care to have<br/>
heated &quot;discussions&quot; can do so without involving the entire list?<br/>
I have been out of town and I&#39;m new to the list. I&#39;m trying to filter<br/>
though to find the good stuff to help me with my unschooling decision,<br/>
but I&#39;ve discovered that over half of the emails are replies back and<br/>
forth on several different agreements! It&#39;s wearing me out. <br/>
I joined this list over a week ago and found that I had to clear away<br/>
quite a bit each day.<br/>
With 690 people on here, it might be a good idea to do &quot;replies go to<br/>
the author.&quot;<br/>
I am a busy mom and I&#39;m trying to figure out if this list is really<br/>
going to be overly time consuming or if it&#39;s going to weigh my heart<br/>
down with bickering back and forth? I&#39;m thinking of leaving.<br/>
I don&#39;t find the exposure to arguing, nit picking and intolerance of<br/>
each other enlightening at all,<br/>
Some are forgetting to change the subject lines to what the topic has<br/>
morphed into. I can safely say almost 1/3 haven&#39;t been faithful in this<br/>
area so far. It&#39;s exhausting!<br/>
I feel sorry for those that do &quot;digest&quot; what a mess it would be.<br/>
I&#39;m on a list that does &quot;replies go to the author of the message&quot; and<br/>
there are virtually NO REPEATS.<br/>
You may change the To on your email to address the group when it is<br/>
needed, and if you feel that the group will benefit by something you say<br/>
in reply to someone&#39;s post, then that&#39;s great too, but at least this<br/>
airing out will be kept to a minimum. Most people will not post to the<br/>
list something they know should have gone to a specific person, most<br/>
people are reluctant to post to someone&#39;s box something that is<br/>
offensive or rude in any way. <br/>
I don&#39;t sit at my PC all day, so I can&#39;t keep up with this. <br/>
I wish members would  keep the subject line as detailed as possible.<br/>
Moderator: Can you email me privately as to why the list can&#39;t be set at<br/>
&quot;replies go to author?&quot;<br/>
I have met a lady in my hsing group that was on this list and couldn&#39;t<br/>
keep up either. It looks like it will happen to me if things continue as<br/>
they are.<br/>
Some of folks have been on here a long time and obviously feel this is<br/>
their territory. It doesn&#39;t seem that there is a lot of friendliness to<br/>
new comers. (Though I have seen some nice people here too! Please don&#39;t<br/>
misunderstand me.)<br/>
As I can see, USing is just now getting a lot of recognition, many<br/>
families will be checking into it, it&#39;d be nice to have a non-hostile<br/>
environment to converse in. I would like to refer people here, but I<br/>
feel I&#39;d be complicating their lives if do it now.<br/>
I&#39;m saying this is love<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<br/>
What are your goals for your kids?<br/>
<br/>
What do you fear most as far as homeschooling your kids is concerned?<br/>
<br/>
Do you want unschooling in a nutshell? Just ask and people will try to<br/>
define the undefinable in a few sentences. You won&#39;t &quot;get&quot; unschooling from<br/>
them but it might be enough to give you a better idea.<br/>
<br/>
But you might also try the Unschooling.com message boards.<br/>
(http://www.unschooling.com) I find them much easier to read because the<br/>
messages tend to stick to the topics and you can see all the messages<br/>
together for that topic.<br/>
<br/>
And there are also some books, recommended at Unschooling.com and<br/>
http://www.home-ed-magazine.com They&#39;re easier to grab in the brief minutes<br/>
of busy motherhood :-) It&#39;s tought to take the computer into the bathroom<br/>
;-) Books do lack that indefinable quality of discussion that sparks the<br/>
brain cells. But they might be enough to help you be able to filter faster.<br/>
You&#39;ll be able to see what you need to pay attention to more easily.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because only a tiny portion of getting unschooling will come from direct<br/>
answers to the questions we ask. Most will come from the questions that<br/>
other people ask, from serendipitous posts, from having read something that<br/>
didn&#39;t seem relevant that later pops up in life.<br/>
<br/>
Getting unschooling, like understanding life, involves having the whole<br/>
world thrown at you and learning what to pay attention to at anyone time<br/>
while still letting the rest wash over you. If you had just concentrated on<br/>
the words your child wanted to know (milk, up, juice, for instance) without<br/>
immersing him in a sea of the English language, he wouldn&#39;t realize there<br/>
was more to English than what he could immediately grasp. He couldn&#39;t<br/>
realize that he needed to ask about sentences if he didn&#39;t know they<br/>
existed.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe picture trying to learn how to sail, one factoid at a time. Which<br/>
factoids would you choose to learn? In order to learn to sail, you need to<br/>
immerse yourself in it so you can experience the whole big picture. The same<br/>
is basically true of any new endeavor, especially something as huge as<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The list does go through periods of great activity and periods where you<br/>
wonder if you&#39;re still subscribed ;-) Right now it is very active. And<br/>
usually it is fairly active.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not insensitive to this concern that a number of people have brought up.<br/>
But it might be like asking a Mack Truck to be a sports car. This list is an<br/>
ongoing messy dialog about changing thinking. It isn&#39;t easy for most people<br/>
to understand how learning can happen without teaching, especially because<br/>
unschooling needs to look different for every family because it is centered<br/>
around each unique child.<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned about the bickering. There&#39;s no reason to waste people&#39;s time<br/>
with nasty personal notes back and forth. But some people see debate as<br/>
bickering and debate does need to happen in order for many people (all<br/>
people?) to get unschooling.<br/>

where there isn&#39;t much to learn from answers to other people&#39;s questions.<br/>
(I&#39;m not sure I can imagine a scenario the second fits but I guess it isn&#39;t<br/>
impossible.)<br/>
<br/>
But if I try to imagine learning what I have about unschooling reading a<br/>
list without the freewheeling questions and answers and discussions I&#39;ve<br/>
experienced on lists and message boards over the past 7 years, I think I&#39;d<br/>
be doing eclectic! That&#39;s at least easy to understand without a major<br/>
paradigm shift.<br/>
<br/>
I hope people remembering to change subjects will help. I hope the mail<br/>
clogging bickering can end. But other than what I suggested to Valerie, and<br/>
suggesting a list with fewer people, perhaps *don&#39;t* try to keep up. Just<br/>
let whatever you can wash over you. We&#39;re awash in information in this<br/>
society anyway so learning how to let a lot of it slide could be a useful<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for your feedback and serious consideration of my dilemma. <br/>
The thing is: there is also &quot;information overload.&quot; I can easily throw a<br/>
question out there. <br/>
Also, doing the &quot;replies to author&quot; doesn&#39;t completely annul any online<br/>
conversations, it only limits the &quot;yeah okay&quot; and &quot;I simply agree&quot; type<br/>
thing that can fill up a box quickly.<br/>
Suppose I post, and I get 4 people from that one post that is interested<br/>
in what I&#39;ve said.<br/>
Then there are 5 posts automatically from that one post (including<br/>
mine.) That&#39;s only ONE topic.<br/>
I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m getting the big picture on this list because too many<br/>
things are jumping out at me at one time, like the &quot;yeah okay&quot; stuff<br/>
that could have been sent to the author of the original posts. <br/>
I believe that the bantering back and forth would come to a halt almost<br/>
completely. Someone who is intolerant to another is less likely to<br/>
attack a through a personal email and that &quot;he said, she said&quot; and<br/>
sticking up for one another ends too because there isn&#39;t an audience to<br/>
it.<br/>
If I go and set myself with the message board, then I&#39;m not able to<br/>
interact as freely and because many of the posts aren&#39;t up to date on<br/>
the subject line I would end up clicking them to see if they are<br/>
accurately posted. If I go to digest I&#39;d be sitting here having to<br/>
filter through the back and forth anyway. <br/>
I just think it&#39;s worth a try to do the &quot;replies go to the author&quot; for a<br/>
day or two and see how it works. <br/>
I was curious as to how many did digest on this list and went to the<br/>
webpage. I found that about 166 of the 690 are &quot;bouncing&quot; members. I&#39;m<br/>
not able to get the digest info.<br/>
I&#39;m on a list that has over 450 members that use &quot;replies go to author&quot;<br/>
and it runs smoothly and there is plenty of discussion, and it&#39;s not<br/>
overwhelming. It remains interesting without redundancy. <br/>
Those who are seasoned in USing can simply send emails in that they<br/>
think will help others.<br/>
Sorry to be long winded, I really want to stay here. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470993366"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m trying to filter<br/>
&gt; though to find the good stuff to help me with my unschooling decision,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about asking some questions. :-)<br/>
Well, I really don&#39;t have but one at this moment and it is, Do any of<br/>
you teach your Teen children algebra?<br/>
 <br/>
I mean in the form of &quot;solving for variables&quot; or the like. The reason<br/>
I&#39;m asking is; I did a PayPal transaction and a percentage was taken out<br/>
because I received a refund and the other person used a credit card.<br/>
PayPal charged a fee for this transaction.<br/>
My Teen had been doing Saxon math. She learned some of the formulas for<br/>
algebra. She figured out how much the percentage was by rewording the<br/>
problem and finding the right formula. I taught her this with Saxon,<br/>
meaning, she didn&#39;t come up with wanting to learn this herself. She<br/>
really didn&#39;t want to know much about math at all. But I insisted that<br/>
she at least &quot;try&quot; and to not allow the math to intimidate her. I talked<br/>
her into doing it by calling the math &quot;puzzles to solve.&quot; It lightened<br/>
the mood considerably. She wasn&#39;t gun-ho, but she did it. I think to<br/>
please me. (This is BEFORE I looked into USing.) Anyway, she was so<br/>
happy when she solved the PayPal problem and was able to find that they<br/>
took 6.5% Now she has a skill to use. Same with learning parameters, she<br/>
can figure on her own how much carpet in her bedroom she wants right<br/>
away. I think that she learned that maybe I do have some educational<br/>
things to impart to her because I know she is ready for them and she<br/>
will be alert as when to use the new techniques as situations arise.<br/>
Rather than me just waiting to ask the magic question, &quot;Mom, may I learn<br/>
such and such?&quot; Can she possibly know what she really wants? What I mean<br/>
is do USer&#39;s just strike the match for the child and see if it burns and<br/>
if not, then stop or do you wait for your child to ask for the match? Is<br/>
not considered USing if I introduce things for them to do, like math,<br/>
and maybe nudge them to see if they are ready. That&#39;s what I do anyway.<br/>
My middle daughter loves to use her Saxon math book. <br/>
She enjoys it so much, (she&#39;s an sequential type), it would break her<br/>
heart if I took it away and hurt her feelings that I don&#39;t consider it<br/>
valuable anymore. Does that make sense?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are your goals for your kids?<br/>
I would like for them to have &quot;original thought.&quot; I want them to be<br/>
creative and individuals who are not afraid to go against the grain if<br/>
that&#39;s what it takes to do right. I want them to find what they would<br/>
love to do for a living and do it. My worst thought is that they would<br/>
be stuck into a job they hated and would live a stoic existence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you fear most as far as homeschooling your kids is concerned?<br/>
That one day the government with produce laws forbidding homeschooling.<br/>
I have no fear of homeschooling otherwise. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you want unschooling in a nutshell? Just ask and people will try to<br/>
define the undefinable in a few sentences. You won&#39;t &quot;get&quot; unschooling<br/>
from<br/>
them but it might be enough to give you a better idea.<br/>
I get the idea what it is, sometimes it seems like &quot;more work&quot; for those<br/>
that aren&#39;t ultra creative.<br/>
I&#39;m a reader by heart and I listen to a lot of music. I&#39;m about to do<br/>
some gardening. I&#39;m not super artsy though I encourage my kids to do<br/>
art. My son has a volcano lab that we are going to get into tomorrow. <br/>
I talk to my children about current events etc. We spend a lot of time<br/>
on the beach too. <br/>
But when it comes to math and grammar. I don&#39;t know, I think that it&#39;s<br/>
important to be direct about those things. I don&#39;t mean &quot;stuffing it&quot;<br/>
but just exposing them to it. <br/>
We are making a homophone chart. I just handed them a Scholastic book<br/>
(similar to a short dictionary) and I asked them to look up three words,<br/>
even it they didn&#39;t know what they meant, but liked the way that they<br/>
sounded. We made up fun sentences verbally with them. I am particular<br/>
about handwriting. I think that children should have good handwriting<br/>
skills, (when they are completely ready). My children all have beautiful<br/>
handwriting because of a program I&#39;ve taught them. They love to make<br/>
beautiful letters. So they do that with the homophone chart. It&#39;s fun<br/>
and it&#39;s like a game. Even my Teen enjoys it! <br/>
But some here may not think that this is USing?<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t post the entire message due to time constraints. But thank you<br/>
for letting me share! :O)<br/>
I&#39;m long winded, sorry. too much to think about in one day!<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do any of<br/>
&gt; you teach your Teen children algebra?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The unschooling philosophy is that people will learn what they need to learn<br/>
by living life freely and joyfully in an environment that&#39;s rich enough for<br/>
them to both explore their interests and stumble across new interests.<br/>
<br/>
People actually do use algebra in their daily lives. Algebra is just finding<br/>
out what you don&#39;t know from what you do. When kids are exposed to math by<br/>
using it in the real world they develop an understanding of how numbers work<br/>
that most kids who learn math formally usually don&#39;t get.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the difference between learning Spanish formally in a classroom and<br/>
learning it by going to Spain and having to use it to get what you need.<br/>
Someone in a classroom may appear to know more because they are learning<br/>
what they&#39;ll be tested on. Someone learning through immersion is learning<br/>
how to *use* the language, they&#39;re using great big huge concepts without<br/>
totally understanding them and getting feedback on how well they&#39;re using<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I taught her this with Saxon,<br/>
&gt; meaning, she didn&#39;t come up with wanting to learn this herself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we teach them something that we are certain they will need to know and<br/>
they&#39;re happy we did it, it does reinforce the fear that they would never<br/>
have learned that on their own and what other things aren&#39;t they learning<br/>
that we should be teaching?<br/>
<br/>
It helps a great deal to become conscious of what they are learning<br/>
*without* being taught. That&#39;s the huge part of the puzzle that&#39;s missing.<br/>
We really only see what we&#39;ve taught them and we don&#39;t see the far greater<br/>
number of things they&#39;ve learned on their own. And we tend not to value<br/>
those things too, because if they learned them without being taught then it<br/>
seems they weren&#39;t all that difficult to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I talked<br/>
&gt; her into doing it by calling the math &quot;puzzles to solve.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Eeverything* in life can be approached as a puzzle to solve.<br/>
<br/>
In an unschooling way the PayPal problem might have been presented as a<br/>
problem that you wanted a sounding board for. You could have explained the<br/>
problem and walked through it. She might have asked questions to help<br/>
you/her understand what was going on.<br/>
<br/>
She might not have the same understanding after watching you but she would<br/>
have a foundation of understanding to build on so the next time percentages<br/>
came up she&#39;d have something to relate them to, another part to add to the<br/>
piece of the puzzle that was already in place.<br/>
<br/>
If she had opportunities like the PayPal with her own money, she might have<br/>
brought the problem to you and you could have puzzled it out together.<br/>
<br/>
The things we learn on our own because we need the information or skill is<br/>
where the profound learning happens. Unfortunately it&#39;s quiet so we parents<br/>
don&#39;t get as much feedback from it as we do when we teach.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Rather than me just waiting to ask the magic question, &quot;Mom, may I learn<br/>
&gt; such and such?&quot; Can she possibly know what she really wants? What I mean<br/>
&gt; is do USer&#39;s just strike the match for the child and see if it burns and<br/>
&gt; if not, then stop or do you wait for your child to ask for the match?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the hard parts of unschooling, I think, is in turning our thinking<br/>
around from thinking in terms of subjects to thinking in terms of exploring<br/>
interests. The &quot;subjects&quot; should be the *tools* we reach for to make sense<br/>
of what we do, not the goal themselves. History is meaningless unless we<br/>
have the questions we want answered that history can provide. (Like being<br/>
interested in the Little House series and being curious about why Laura&#39;s<br/>
life was as it was.)<br/>
<br/>
The point in life is the bird house, not the hammer. As a side-effect of<br/>
building a bird house we learn how to use a hammer. The hammer is<br/>
meaningless without the uses it gets put to. And learning how to use a<br/>
hammer is even more useless if it&#39;s learned for the sake of learning how to<br/>
hammer &quot;just in case&quot;. Learning that way in fact limits someone&#39;s concept of<br/>
a hammer because it then becomes a tool for pounding nails. It won&#39;t be a<br/>
tool for cracking nuts or a paperweight or to whack a wrench to loosen a<br/>
bolt or a prop to test center of balance.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s inadequate but, like a problem in percentages you&#39;ve walked through<br/>
for your daughter out loud, it is a foundation, a beginning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is<br/>
&gt; not considered USing if I introduce things for them to do, like math,<br/>
&gt; and maybe nudge them to see if they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is providing what the child needs today in order to achieve what<br/>
he&#39;s trying to do. He needs to have what he might need in reach and<br/>
accessible.<br/>
<br/>
When your kids were learning to speak, did you speak to them as an adult,<br/>
concerned that they had to learn words like corporate takeover, radio<br/>
astronomy, medulla oblongata, cartesian coordinates or they&#39;d never make it<br/>
in the world? Or did you talk about the things they were interested in,<br/>
naturally immersing those words and subjects in the proper context of<br/>
language even if they didn&#39;t totally grasp every word you were saying and<br/>
yet naturally at a level that wouldn&#39;t confound them totally?<br/>
<br/>
So an unschooler doesn&#39;t think in terms of *leading* a child to what he<br/>
needs to know so much as making the opportunities to need those things<br/>
available. That can sound like an impossible task! How can we possibly<br/>
surround them with everything that&#39;s in a 9th grade science book? Well you<br/>
can and you can&#39;t ;-) That science book is just a distillation, just a tiny<br/>
portion of what is in your child&#39;s life right now. The chapter on astronomy<br/>
may go in and trickle out unless the child has looked up with a wondering<br/>
parent and looked for constellations or given the time to notice stars come<br/>
in different colors or asked about the first &quot;star&quot; that appears at sunset<br/>
or tried to find the various faces in the moon that other cultures have<br/>
found. It really doesn&#39;t need to go further than that (though, of course,<br/>
some kids may). It will create a sense of wonder and curiosity and good<br/>
feelings about the night sky that will be a foundation for learning more. A<br/>
textbook chapter the child has no interest in initially might spark an<br/>
interest that would have been sparked by the night sky but it&#39;s as likely to<br/>
leave another child with no desire to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
What you supply them with isn&#39;t the information, but the sense of wonder --<br/>
you&#39;ll need to recapture this too :-) -- and the resources to explore<br/>
wherever their interests lead them. It doesn&#39;t mean you need every<br/>
educational product on the market. It can be just a mom who can say &quot;Let&#39;s<br/>
go look it up with Google.&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My middle daughter loves to use her Saxon math book.<br/>
&gt; She enjoys it so much, (she&#39;s an sequential type), it would break her<br/>
&gt; heart if I took it away and hurt her feelings that I don&#39;t consider it<br/>
&gt; valuable anymore. Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s nothing valueless in anything a child is interested in. (Though<br/>
sometimes it helps to come ask for some perspective when they&#39;ve been<br/>
playing a computer game for 3 weeks straight ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with textbooks if that&#39;s what the child likes. I think<br/>
it can be comforting for adults if kids like textbooks and workbooks and we<br/>
can feel satisified they&#39;re &quot;doing math&quot; but that comfort can make us stop<br/>
there. We will be less likely to feel the need to supply the real world<br/>
contexts we would for a non-textbook child that will make math meaningful:<br/>
allowance, games, Nintendo, cooking, counting and sorting, and so on and so<br/>
forth.<br/>
<br/>
So in a way, yes, you should see it as less valuable because Saxon shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be the center of math but just one small aspect of math. (Saxon seems to<br/>
work best at teaching kids how to take math tests.) But you should also see<br/>
it as valuable because it is valuable to your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
The really tricky part is to learn to see things that same way when they<br/>
value learning all 251+ Pokemon names! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
When you think of the people who are &quot;original thinkers&quot; do you imagine them<br/>
as having been fed what they need to know by well meaning experts who know<br/>
what they needed to know or having reached out for what they needed to know?<br/>
<br/>

exclusively jobs available to college graduates? Did those jobs come from<br/>
what they were given, or from what they sought out for themselves?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, creativity has less to do with it than cultivating a sense of curiosity<br/>
and wonder. Creativity implies that you need to make the world entertaining<br/>
so the kids want to know what you&#39;re sure they need to. No, all that&#39;s<br/>
necessary is being curious about life yourself. Share how happy you are over<br/>
something you&#39;ve found or done. (Imagine how pleased you are when your child<br/>
does this around you.) Stop and smell the roses. And wonder how the grapes<br/>
got all the way from Chili and what other movie did that actor play in and<br/>
what happens when you type two random words into Google and are there any<br/>
clues in the personal ads that tell you what kind of people they are and so<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m a reader by heart and I listen to a lot of music. I&#39;m about to do<br/>
&gt; some gardening. I&#39;m not super artsy though I encourage my kids to do<br/>
&gt; art. My son has a volcano lab that we are going to get into tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; I talk to my children about current events etc. We spend a lot of time<br/>
&gt; on the beach too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sounds great :-)<br/>
<br/>
Do you share favorite passages or tell them of your favorite books? (That&#39;s<br/>
not one of my skills so it&#39;t just an idea for those who might find it<br/>
natural.)<br/>
<br/>
Do you talk about why you like certain songs? Do you listen to music beyond<br/>
your &quot;comfort zone&quot; or explore some world music?<br/>
<br/>
Have you planted things in the garden that kids might enjoy? (Their<br/>
appreciation isn&#39;t a necessary part of the deal. Wanting to create an<br/>
environment that provides them with things to stumble across is though.)<br/>
Have you asked them if they&#39;d like you to plant something for them? Or given<br/>
them a section of the yard that belongs to them to do with as they please?<br/>
(Plant flowers, vegetables, turn it into a mud pit ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Do they collect things at the beach? Do you look them up and observe them?<br/>
Be curious yourself :-) It&#39;s not necessary for the kids to pursue it if they<br/>
aren&#39;t interested, but it is important that they see you being curious.<br/>
(Don&#39;t force yourself. Just find natural opportunities to be curious. You<br/>
might need to give yourself a little shove if you haven&#39;t learned something<br/>
just for the sake of curiosity in a while! But it can be infectious :-) To<br/>
you and the kids.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But when it comes to math and grammar. I don&#39;t know, I think that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; important to be direct about those things. I don&#39;t mean &quot;stuffing it&quot;<br/>
&gt; but just exposing them to it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can guarantee they know grammar. They may not have the formal language<br/>
that goes with it, but they do know it. (Mad Libs are good. Ruth Heller&#39;s<br/>
books are goregous.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the greatest &quot;teacher&quot; is needing to write for a personally<br/>
meaningful reason. Email, IMs, letters, poems, stories, comic books, game<br/>
walkthroughs, webpages. The *need* has to come from them. But you need to<br/>
make sure the opportunities are there and available.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We are making a homophone chart. I just handed them a Scholastic book<br/>
&gt; (similar to a short dictionary) and I asked them to look up three words,<br/>
&gt; even it they didn&#39;t know what they meant, but liked the way that they<br/>
&gt; sounded. We made up fun sentences verbally with them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sounds like it could be fun. :-) And this isn&#39;t meant to discourage you<br/>
if they are having fun at it. *Anything* they enjoy they will learn<br/>
something from. Just ask yourself why you feel they need to know homophones.<br/>
What use are they? They are like surprises hidden in English and there&#39;s a<br/>
great deal of learning that can happen around stumbling on such things --<br/>
like *why* do two totally differently spelled words sound alike and *why* do<br/>
two words spelled alike have different pronounciations -- or bringing them<br/>
up like a puzzle to ponder over. But the only &quot;need&quot; of them in kids<br/>
learning is when teachers are teaching reading and spelling and making sure<br/>
the kids don&#39;t mix up the spellings of two, to and too so the teacher can<br/>
check off that they &quot;learned&quot; those to provide feedback to parents,<br/>
administrators and the state.<br/>
<br/>
Kids *can* learn to read and spell without ever dealing with homophones<br/>
formally. They&#39;ll just absorb them. Just as they accept without even<br/>
thinking about it that spoken English is a great deal different in formality<br/>
of structure than written English. But it&#39;s fun to point them out and talk<br/>
about them when they or you stumble on them :-) Or even if you think, &quot;Gee,<br/>
they might be interested in this because it&#39;s interesting so I&#39;ll get this<br/>
book and run it by whoever is interested.&quot; (Which is a rather poor excuse<br/>
for a sentence in a discussion of grammar learned through writing ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am particular<br/>
&gt; about handwriting. I think that children should have good handwriting<br/>
&gt; skills, (when they are completely ready).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why? I don&#39;t mean that question in an attacking way. I mean, stop and ask<br/>
yourself why. Usually when we ask ourselves why and we get irritated that<br/>
someone&#39;s asking it&#39;s because the answer is &quot;just because it&#39;s important&quot;<br/>
but we can&#39;t really pinpoint why.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s another one of the hard parts about unschooling. It&#39;s digging<br/>
deep and figuring out why it is we think such and such is important. And<br/>
there are often so *many* things that are important &quot;just because&quot;! In a way<br/>
it&#39;s easier just to do the things we think are important even if the doing<br/>
might be rough (in terms of kid resistance) or need creativity (to make it<br/>
fun so the kids don&#39;t resist so much). It&#39;s tough to let go of that little<br/>
piece of the world we thought we had control over. (But there *are* rewards<br/>
in terms of kids learning and being and becoming who they are.)<br/>
<br/>
Doctors have horrible handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
Calligraphers need very nice writing. But do calligraphers come from having<br/>
been made to practice until their handwriting was nice or is the nice<br/>
handwriting an indication that someone might enjoy a book on calligraphy?<br/>
<br/>
What are the consequences of having bad handwriting? How about not being<br/>
able to fill out a job application so someone else can read it? But if it&#39;s<br/>
a job the person wants, isn&#39;t that a huge motivator to learn? Do we really<br/>
think that our kids would not self-improve for something they want? Haven&#39;t<br/>
they *always* done that? The only difference is we have a mental block about<br/>
self-improving over something &quot;academic&quot;. And probably the reason is because<br/>
academics gets force fed through dull lectures and hours of dull practice so<br/>
the various subjects -- and often learning itself --- becomes a huge<br/>
mountain to climb.<br/>
<br/>
But an unschooled child doesn&#39;t have the weight of those years of dull<br/>
practice tied to his concept of learning. Improving handwriting is like<br/>
improving skateboarding -- except easier on the knees and elbows ;-) All it<br/>
takes is some greater attentiveness, perhaps asking some questions on letter<br/>
formation, perhaps going through a book. Anything learned for personally<br/>
meaningful reasons is learned almost effortlessly, because the effort has<br/>
meaning and can often be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, all of this digging deep and asking ourselves to reexamine what we<br/>
think is important and why we think it&#39;s important takes a lot of time and<br/>
work! :-) But to those who are trying to achieve the goals that unschooling<br/>
is best suited for it&#39;s more than worth it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My children all have beautiful<br/>
&gt; handwriting because of a program I&#39;ve taught them. They love to make<br/>
&gt; beautiful letters. So they do that with the homophone chart. It&#39;s fun<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s like a game. Even my Teen enjoys it!<br/>
&gt; But some here may not think that this is USing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they love to make beautiful letters great :-) If it&#39;s fun and a game<br/>
great :-) Scatter some calligraphy books around the house. Point out<br/>
interesting handwriting. Read about the development of writing. (*If* they<br/>
want to.) Try out some Chinese brushes and some Chinese calligraphy. Look at<br/>
the Book of Kells and other illuminated manuscripts. (If they want to. Or do<br/>
it for yourself.)<br/>
<br/>
But your pride in their having accomplished what you hoped they would will<br/>
get in the way of &quot;getting&quot; unschooling. Unschooling won&#39;t be about you and<br/>
what you can do but about them and what they can and want to do for<br/>
themselves. Again, that&#39;s not meant as a criticism. Only as an indicator of<br/>
where you are from where an unschooler is. And it only needs to concern you<br/>
as important if you want to get from where you are to where the unschooler<br/>
is. If you&#39;re happy where you are and your kids are leading joyfilled lives<br/>
then forcing yourself to do something different may be more trouble than<br/>
it&#39;s worth. But if there are parts that aren&#39;t working, then it&#39;s worth<br/>
sitting back and wondering why and how it could be different.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling could end up looking almost exactly like what you&#39;re doing,<br/>
offering fun activities. The only difference is in the expectation that they<br/>
must learn such and such. If they can say &quot;No, thanks, I&#39;d rather go play<br/>
Nintendo,&quot; and you can carry on with the kids who are interested or just on<br/>
your own then it&#39;s probably unschooling. :-)<br/>

This is a very good point.  I know a lot of the reason this worked for <br/>
us so well and we fell into it so naturally before we even knew there <br/>
was a name for it, is because my dh and I both have a sense of wonder <br/>
about things.  We can both find interest and learning in watching a <br/>
bug or playing with bubbles or a slew of other things.  So the kidlets <br/>
kind of picked that up naturally too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614790609">&lt;&lt;Well, I really don&#39;t have but one at this moment and it is, Do any of<br/>
you teach your Teen children algebra?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; my children anything. I explain, offer, remark upon, show. I<br/>
know that it just is s difference of wording but that&#39;s important to me.<br/>
Once I moved away from school like words it was easier for me to grasp the<br/>
core of unschooling. As to Algebra, (or history or health or the other ) I<br/>
find that it comes along with life. You saw and your daughter saw algebra in<br/>
use with the PayPal questions. What a wonderful time to point out a neat way<br/>
that numbers work. I wouldn&#39;t have found it helpful to teach her algebra<br/>
ahead of time because I have found that when I tried &quot;teaching&quot; my children<br/>
were no longer interested. My kids would have said &quot;That&#39;s nnice mom&quot;, and<br/>
walked away. The long, boring repetitive &quot;schoolwork&quot; would have caused the<br/>
love of numbers and puzzles to disappear.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, she was so<br/>
happy when she solved the PayPal problem and was able to find that they<br/>
took 6.5% Now she has a skill to use.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think she may have been able to learn the same skill at the time the<br/>
PayPal problem came up. That is how I have found unschooling to work.<br/>
Learning the skill as the opportunity arises, rather than &quot;in school because<br/>
she may one day need it&quot; (institutional school or home school)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Rather than me just waiting to ask the magic question, &quot;Mom, may I learn<br/>
such and such?&quot; Can she possibly know what she really wants? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before I &quot;got&quot; unschooling, I thought that I would leave my kids alone, they<br/>
would de-school and when they were done, they would come to me and say, &quot;I<br/>
wan&#39;t to learn about X&quot;<br/>
I doesn&#39;t work like that! Unschooling children are not typically doing<br/>
bookreports, or spontaneously making up science fair projects, or solving<br/>
math problems for fun. Some may, but most will be learning about different<br/>
things in more subtle ways. Watching TV, movies, reading books and<br/>
magazines, playing with dirt and rocks, talking with others, shopping,<br/>
onlince surfing, PLAYING. Learning will cease to look like what it does in<br/>
school and begin to look more like how adults learn something new.<br/>
<br/>
s<br/>
&lt;&lt;not considered USing if I introduce things for them to do, like math,<br/>
and maybe nudge them to see if they are ready. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
TO ME, it is not unschooling to wait for them to learn &quot;Math&quot; It is<br/>
unschooling to see them learn about how numbers work together, how to manage<br/>
an allowance, how to make the most economical purchase, to see them open<br/>
their own bank account, to triple a recipe or to halve one, and to put<br/>
together a huge lego structure that is perfectly proportioned (not like<br/>
mine)<br/>
.<br/>
&lt;&lt;My middle daughter loves to use her Saxon math book.<br/>
She enjoys it so much, (she&#39;s an sequential type), it would break her<br/>
heart if I took it away and hurt her feelings that I don&#39;t consider it<br/>
valuable anymore. Does that make sense?&gt;&gt;<br/>
Of course, this is how your DD has learned up until now. It takes time for<br/>
them to understand and move away from the beliefs that school and school<br/>
methods is how one learns.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My worst thought is that they would<br/>
be stuck into a job they hated and would live a stoic existence.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Slightly off the thread comment on this. Life today has changed from getting<br/>
your first job and staying until retirement. Jobs change,  careers change,<br/>
people change. They never have to be &quot;stuck in a job they hate&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I get the idea what it is, sometimes it seems like &quot;more work&quot; for those<br/>
that aren&#39;t ultra creative.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most unschoolers are not ultra creative and finding new ways to get our<br/>
children to learn what we feel is important as they go through thier &quot;School<br/>
years&quot;.<br/>
We are trusting that our children are able to learn things that *they* need<br/>
to know, when *they* need to know it. Many of us believe that there is no<br/>
&quot;body of knowledge&quot; that must be imparted to our children, they will learn,<br/>
just as we do. I strive to show my children that whatever they want to know<br/>
about is out there for them to grab onto, when they need it. My goal is not<br/>
to give them knowledge, it&#39;s to show them how to find that knowledge for<br/>
themselves.<br/>
.<br/>
&lt;&lt;But when it comes to math and grammar. I don&#39;t know, I think that it&#39;s<br/>
important to be direct about those things. I don&#39;t mean &quot;stuffing it&quot;<br/>
but just exposing them to it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How could anyone NOT be exposed to math or grammar? It&#39;s all around us, not<br/>
just found in Saxon Algebra 1/2 or Little-Brown&#39;s grammar text. It&#39;s on the<br/>
PayPal site, or Goosebumps books or War& Peace or Stephen King&#39;s On Writing<br/>
or balancing a checkbook. Like art and gardening and feeding the pets,<br/>
learning is EVERYWHERE. It is impossible NOT to do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We are making a homophone chart.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is a homophone?<br/>
My children all have beautiful<br/>
handwriting because of a program I&#39;ve taught them.<br/>
My oldest has terrible handwriting and he propbably used a program similar<br/>
to yours. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They love to make<br/>
beautiful letters.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which is probably WHY they have beautiful handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So they do that with the homophone chart. It&#39;s fun<br/>
and it&#39;s like a game. Even my Teen enjoys it!<br/>
But some here may not think that this is USing?&gt;&gt;<br/>
There may be many who feel that way. But just because someone says &quot;IMO,<br/>
that is not really unschooling&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you are wrong.<br/>
I did some things in school that were fun and like a game. but what other<br/>
choice did I have? and it wasn&#39;t a game.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The unschooling philosophy is that people will learn what they need to <br/>
&gt; learn<br/>
&gt; by living life freely and joyfully in an environment that&#39;s rich enough for<br/>
&gt; them to both explore their interests and stumble across new interests.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the other hand - I have been teaching Algebra to my 14 yo and her 15 yo <br/>
friend. It started because they wanted to take music, computer, drama, and <br/>
art courses at the local community college. They can do that without a high <br/>
school diploma (they&#39;re doing it now) - but it requires a bit of running <br/>
around getting signatures for permission. They can avoid unit limits and <br/>
other hassles by having a high school diploma. One easy way to get that, in <br/>
California, is to pass the California High School Proficiency Exam (CHSPE). <br/>
So - that&#39;s what they&#39;ve decided to do. It also gives them the ability to <br/>
work without having to get a work permit - which can ALSO be a hassle since <br/>
they are only given out by schools. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway - wanting to take the CHSPE led to them wanting some tutoring in math. <br/>
Neither had ever done a single minute of any formal math program - we started <br/>
from ground zero with simple arithmetic and moved very quickly through <br/>
adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing of whole numbers and then <br/>
through fractions and decimals and percentages and exponents and roots. Also <br/>
threw in some basic geometry and some consumer math - like figuring out <br/>
compound interest. Then they were ready for algebra. They could probably pass <br/>
the test without algebra - they don&#39;t have to score all that high on the test <br/>
to pass it - but they wanted to be really prepared so we looked around at <br/>
different algebra materials and picked one out. They have had no trouble <br/>
learning it- at a very very fast pace - probably 10 times faster than in a <br/>
college classroom situation. We&#39;ve taken a hiatus for the past couple of <br/>
months because their college classes were taking a lot of their time (my <br/>
daughter is taking Beginning Voice, JavaScript programming, and History of <br/>
Opera). But they did enjoy doing the algebra and plan to get back to it soon. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The thing that interests me is that they pick up the techniques VERY quickly <br/>
- they have no math anxiety at all - zero. If they don&#39;t understand <br/>
something, it doesn&#39;t bother them, they just ask questions and try to see it <br/>
another way, etc. Very calm, very natural, very happy.<br/>
<br/>
They read the material in the book on their own and work some problems. I sit <br/>
with them once or twice a week and mostly chat with them about what they&#39;re <br/>
working on - they ask me if there is something they don&#39;t understand. Often <br/>
what they want to talk about is some idea of theirs that goes beyond the <br/>
textbook - some idea about how the stuff might be used or something funny <br/>
they noticed, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I feel SO validated that not doing any formal math was a good idea. <br/>
<br/>
BUT - remember - we did a LOT of math in our everyday natural lives. I notice <br/>
math and like it. We play a LOT of games and we do a lot of &quot;math-talk&quot; in <br/>
our regular lives. For example, I remember eating M&Ms in the front seat of <br/>
the car one day, with one kid sitting with me, waiting for something. I casua<br/>
lly, just out of curiosity, wondered aloud, &quot;Wonder what the probability is <br/>
of randomly picking a red M&M out of the bag.&quot; My daughter dumped the bag in <br/>
her lap and started sorting and counting. We went on from there -- after <br/>
figuring out the probability of picking one red M&M, I asked her, jokingly, <br/>
&quot;What&#39;s the probability of picking either a red or green or brown or ... &quot;-- <br/>
listing all the colors. It is a probability of 1 or 100 percent which led to <br/>
a little discussion about what 100 percent of something means. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you&#39;re going to unschool math, you owe it to the kids to be <br/>
willing to have some mathy types of conversations and to make yourself learn <br/>
to enjoy them and get over your own math anxiety IF you have any. Don&#39;t blame <br/>
yourself - school did it to you. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the other hand - I have been teaching Algebra to my 14 yo and her 15<br/>
yo <br/>
friend. It started because they wanted to take music, computer, drama,<br/>
and <br/>
art courses at the local community college. They can do that without a<br/>
high <br/>
school diploma (they&#39;re doing it now) - but it requires a bit of running<br/>
<br/>
around getting signatures for permission. They can avoid unit limits and<br/>
<br/>
other hassles by having a high school diploma. One easy way to get that,<br/>
in <br/>
California, is to pass the California High School Proficiency Exam<br/>
(CHSPE). <br/>
So - that&#39;s what they&#39;ve decided to do. It also gives them the ability<br/>
to <br/>
work without having to get a work permit - which can ALSO be a hassle<br/>
since <br/>
they are only given out by schools. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway - wanting to take the CHSPE led to them wanting some tutoring in<br/>
math. <br/>
Neither had ever done a single minute of any formal math program - we<br/>
started <br/>
from ground zero with simple arithmetic and moved very quickly through <br/>
adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing of whole numbers and then <br/>
through fractions and decimals and percentages and exponents and roots.<br/>
Also <br/>
threw in some basic geometry and some consumer math - like figuring out <br/>
compound interest. Then they were ready for algebra. They could probably<br/>
pass <br/>
the test without algebra - they don&#39;t have to score all that high on the<br/>
test <br/>
to pass it - but they wanted to be really prepared so we looked around<br/>
at <br/>
different algebra materials and picked one out. They have had no trouble<br/>
<br/>
learning it- at a very very fast pace - probably 10 times faster than in<br/>
a <br/>
college classroom situation. We&#39;ve taken a hiatus for the past couple of<br/>
<br/>
months because their college classes were taking a lot of their time (my<br/>
<br/>
daughter is taking Beginning Voice, JavaScript programming, and History<br/>
of <br/>
Opera). But they did enjoy doing the algebra and plan to get back to it<br/>
soon. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The thing that interests me is that they pick up the techniques VERY<br/>
quickly <br/>
- they have no math anxiety at all - zero. If they don&#39;t understand <br/>
something, it doesn&#39;t bother them, they just ask questions and try to<br/>
see it <br/>
another way, etc. Very calm, very natural, very happy.<br/>
<br/>
