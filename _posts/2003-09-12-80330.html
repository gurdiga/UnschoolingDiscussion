<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002357733">&lt;&lt;Still there are no school aged kids on the playground&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the ages of your children but we have something of the same<br/>
problem here in semi-rural Texas.  Lots and lots of homeschoolers but all<br/>
are sitting at the kitchen table until 3 or 4 with a stack of workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
What has worked for us is the kids simply following their passions.  They<br/>
find people of all varying ages who share their interests and it has led to<br/>
lots of friendships.  Adriane is in gymnastics about 9 hours a week and her<br/>
best friend right now is 2 years younger than herself.  Zach is only 10 but<br/>
is really into skeet shooting with 4-H.  Most of the kids he hangs out with<br/>
are much older.  We also do utilize the local &quot;school at home&quot; support group<br/>
for the kids to meet more kids their own age.  I figure if the kids find<br/>
people they like to spend time with, it isn&#39;t particularly important that<br/>
all the parents agree on educational philosophy.<br/>

homeschoolers but 99.9% of them at school-at-home and Christian. I gave <br/>
up phoning people due to the fact that even on a nice non-humid day they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t come play cos of &#39;lessons&#39; or &#39;tests&#39; or the child had showed <br/>
disrespect that morning and was grounded all day until they &#39;learned&#39;.<br/>
We now only see 2 people and the kids are very lonely :-(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hate to copy all of what Julie said.. but, I just wanted to say DITTO to <br/>
all of it.  The situation is much the same here in NC.  Homeschooling is growing <br/>
by leaps and bounds, unschooling is a bit slower :-)     We just have to make <br/>
adjustments for the school at home crowd.. Play group is in the afternoon... <br/>
it seems they limit a lot of &quot;field trips&quot; ( we just call them &quot;going to so <br/>
and so&quot;..lol)  ..There is usually some curriculum, testing, grade level talk <br/>
among the mothers, but Pam and I just kind of tune it out or nod and smile..   <br/>
Until unschooling becomes more popular around here, I guess she and I will just <br/>
continue to be the wierd ones.. LOL.  It&#39;s funny though, because we think THEY <br/>
are wierd..  Yesterday, a gorgeous day at the park..perfect weather.. One <br/>
mother said they had to go home because her daughter didn&#39;t finish her school <br/>
work that morning.   And another mother promised her son a &quot;mega reward&quot; for <br/>
reciting the American&#39;s Creed.  Our kids were watching a soccer game and eating <br/>
cow tails.. lol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know what Shyrley, I have to agree with you. It did not even <br/>
occurred to me, while writing my original post. So in the end, it all <br/>
ends up being a result of the schooling mentality. It&#39;s amazing to me <br/>
how much of a stronghold it has in our society.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, even more so than homeschooling, is definitely a way of <br/>
life.<br/>
