<div id="ygrps-yiv-15188027">I just wanted to add a site for folks to check<br/>
re&quot; vision therapy, and that&#39;s PAVE--parents<br/>
active in vision education, or something close to<br/>
that.  we found the site helpful when we were<br/>
looing into it for my grand daughter.  She did<br/>
therapy for awhile once a month, with us doing it<br/>
daily at home.  It was much cheaper that way and<br/>
really helped her a lot!  She was away from it<br/>
for some time and we noticed she was beginning to<br/>
struggle again.  So we found another therapist<br/>
near us and started her back on weekly visits for<br/>
a &quot;tune-up&quot;  The Dr. said kids who hit puberty<br/>
often have changes (other than the hormones!!&lt;G&gt;)<br/>
and a few visits will get them right back on<br/>
track!  It sure worked for us!!  I am so plased<br/>
with the results.  We were given weekly homework<br/>
and also suggestions for how to stay &quot;tuned up&quot;<br/>
after we stopped going due to a move.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned the cost--by all means, talk<br/>
about options with the Dr.  Often there are ways<br/>
to make it affordable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-855657669">I also want to elaborate on the reading issue...my<br/>
number two boy had a very different learning style<br/>
than number one...he would not attempt reading until<br/>
he was absolutely sure he could do it &quot;perfectly&quot;.It<br/>
was like when he learned to ride a bike...he had to be<br/>
able to balance while standing still(!!!) before he<br/>
would try it moving forward. When he was seven, his<br/>
dad and I sat with him through a reading of a &quot;Bob&quot;<br/>
book. It took about 20 painful minutes, while he<br/>
sounded out each word. Then he wanted to do it again.<br/>
Dad and I stifled our groans (trying to be<br/>
supportive), but he read it all straight through in 30<br/>
seconds. <br/>
<br/>
Well, we didn&#39;t do that much more (ds just never<br/>
wanted to) but over the next 5-6 months, he would<br/>
browse endless Garfield and Archie comics, and lo and<br/>
behold! he was reading, with no assistance from us. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, he&#39;s now nine, and he&#39;s &quot;decided&quot; he likes<br/>
writing, because he can now spell. (And boy #3, who<br/>
refuses to be left behind, picked up reading at age<br/>
four) So that&#39;s three boys who learned to read on<br/>
their own. It&#39;s a great reminder to me...because it<br/>
was the one area where I never &quot;persuaded&quot; (pushed,<br/>
coerced, cajoled, etc LOL) and they did just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, <br/>

definitely doesn&#39;t like to attempt things publicly until he&#39;s sure he can <br/>
do them.<br/>
