<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453729970">-=-but the rest are all brits, right?-=-<br/>
<br/>
did I say that?<br/>
<br/>
I forgot Denzel Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, who watched Crimson Tide AGAIN this week.  That is a phenomenal movie.<br/>
<br/>
If the church of Alan Rickman is English, then &quot;mea culpa&quot; must be translated <br/>
into the language of the day.  I don&#39;t know what it is in England.  In the <br/>
U.S. it would be  maybe &quot;my bad&quot; or &quot;I suck.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Our American friend who is 12 and has lived in England for four years, nearly <br/>
now, said she got in trouble in school for telling another kid to &quot;bug off.&quot;  <br/>
 In the U.S. that&#39;s mild.  In the U.K. it&#39;s WAY too much like &quot;bugger off&quot; <br/>
and that has to do with nasty, illicit contact of private parts.  Not  here.</div>

That was a big surprise to me moving to Canada.  I remember calling someone<br/>
a little bugger and having people look at me askance.  I had no idea what I<br/>
had done wrong until someone explained to me what buggery is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Guess I scandalise people on two continents then. I say &#39;you little <br/>
bugger&#39; and &#39;bugger off&#39; far too often. In fact, I&#39;ve taken to saying it <br/>
instead of &#39;feck&#39; because people here mishear me and think I&#39;ve <br/>
said the naughty F word.<br/>

&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different. I laugh at you because you are all the same.&quot;</div>
