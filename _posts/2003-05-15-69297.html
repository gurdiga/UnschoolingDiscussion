&lt;&lt; Exactly - when men became the force in tyhe medical profession. If women <br/>
had that choice - well - that couldn&#39;t be good.<br/>
You&#39;d have women choosing all sorts of things....<br/>
but abortion has been around forever.<br/>
herbs, falls..... &gt;&gt;<br/>

A friend is pregnant and doesn&#39;t want to be.  I feel so bad for her.  She&#39;s <br/>
had several miscarriages, and her second birth was uber-preemie, 30 weeks or <br/>
something and he was tubed IVd and she just does NOT want to go through <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
The day she first thought she was pregnant, she went and rode her horse, hard <br/>
and fast.<br/>
<br/>
I fell bad for her, for sure.  Other times she was SO careful.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish everyone who wanted a baby could have one safely and sweetly and <br/>
anyone who didn&#39;t want one was magically just by that desire (or lack <br/>
thereof) unable to conceive under any circumstances.   That would be a good <br/>
wish to wish, if someone caught one of those wishing fairies.<br/>
