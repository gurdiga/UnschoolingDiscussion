<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795404540">Patti, I wish I had answers for you. I do feel like I know exactly what <br/>
you&#39;re going through. Today I had to take my two boys, 5 and 9, home from <br/>
the pool early because they wouldn&#39;t stop fighting, chasing and teasing each <br/>
other. It was that same kind of thing: &quot;He LOOKED at me!&quot; &quot;He TOUCHED me!&quot; <br/>
followed by glass-splintering screams from the younger guy. The other <br/>
parents at the pool were politely ignoring them, or being sympathetic, but <br/>
the other kids were starting to shoot us some annoyed looks. I was feeling <br/>
like a bad mom and a bad pool member!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, though I don&#39;t have any answers to this situation, I&#39;ll be looking <br/>
at the discussion with great interest to see if anyone else does.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have heard is that sibling rivalry is really a way that kids <br/>
compete for our attention. So therefore time alone with each child on a <br/>
regular basis should help. I try to do that. I don&#39;t know how much good it <br/>
does, other than it&#39;s good to get them apart for a while, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think the fighting around here was particularly bad today because <br/>
both boys were very tired. They&#39;d both had sleepovers last night and stayed <br/>
up very late. I find that when they&#39;re tired or hungry, the fighting is a <br/>
lot worse.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents. Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Annette<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it can be, but my kids know full well that there are better ways<br/>
to get my attention if they want it right then and there.  I&#39;ve said to<br/>
both of them, together and alone, that any time they want my attention<br/>
and don&#39;t have it they just need to ask me.  I also *offer* my full<br/>
attention quite often- as in &quot;I&#39;ll be done with this in a minute...would<br/>
you like to read a book/play a game with me?&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m about to bake<br/>
cookies would you like to help?&quot; etc etc.  The answer is &quot;no thanks&quot; as<br/>
often as it is &quot;yes,&quot; so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my plain old attention that<br/>
they&#39;re craving so much - they seem to be more interested in  the type<br/>
of attention where I&#39;m &quot;on their side&quot; at the expense of their sibling.<br/>
Not that I take sides- I try very hard to see both sides, but they each<br/>
try just as hard to get me to take theirs.<br/>
I&#39;m also afraid there might be a little bit of an adrenaline addiction<br/>
going on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  Our worst days are when the factors all combine... sleep<br/>
deprivation (I dread those days following unusually late nights), too<br/>
much crappy food, especially with food dye, and the worst of all-<br/>
isolation.  They don&#39;t usually have a problem with each other when<br/>
they&#39;re in the midst of other children or playing in the neigborhood-<br/>
but those times are an exception in our often lonely unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
Summers are much better, as their friends aren&#39;t in school all day, and<br/>
we do more with other people and spend lots of time at the beach.<br/>
So hopefully things will be looking up soon- at least temporarily.<br/>
