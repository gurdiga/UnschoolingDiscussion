<div id="ygrps-yiv-577001716">For those of you who worry about your children reading late because <br/>
you unschool and don&#39;t force them to learn, this is our experience: <br/>
Naomi, my dd, now age 11, was in day care from 3 months to <br/>
Kindergarten (I worked full time) where they started teaching them <br/>
letters/sounds at age 2. She then went to public school until the <br/>
end of 1st grade. We schooled at home (we are just now turning to <br/>
unschooling) and she STILL didn&#39;t read fluently until she was 9! At <br/>
9 she could read whatever she wanted and she tested above grade <br/>
level on her first state mandated test after third grade.<br/>
<br/>
As for socialization: Wills, my almost 13 ds, was also in the above <br/>
situation. Day care, preschool, kindergarten, public schooled until <br/>
the end of 2nd grade. He has always been a square peg in a round <br/>
hole, but not because he was homeschooled! The experts had him for <br/>
all those years and couldn&#39;t make him fit (thank God!). <br/>
<br/>
After four years of home schooling (which has not been unschooling, <br/>
but has been fairly relaxed) Naomi does not love to read, but she <br/>
can read whatever she needs/wants to read. She reads well and with <br/>
excellent comprehension. Wills no longer seems like a round peg, now <br/>
that he can choose his own companions. He is comfortable in any <br/>
situation and makes friends *everywhere*. At the store he talks to <br/>
the kids in the toy aisle and is well known by the clerks in home <br/>
electronics. While waiting for us to check into a hotel he <br/>
befriended the security guard and the bellman who took up our bags. <br/>
He also learned the history of the hotel and had a list of fun <br/>
things we could do in the surrounding area. While watching fireworks <br/>
the other night I was amazed once again at how kids of all ages <br/>
gravitate toward him. He kept them so entertained with his <br/>
impressions that they missed the fireworks finale!<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve been reading about unschooling and all the posts here, I <br/>
keep thinking, &quot;My kids have come so far since their institutional <br/>
days. How far might they go if truly left to themselves?&quot; I can&#39;t <br/>
wait to see! <br/>
