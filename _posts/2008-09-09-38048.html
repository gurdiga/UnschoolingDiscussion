<div id="ygrps-yiv-146002565">Like I&#39;ve always said - there&#39;s no use having an opinion if you&#39;re not<br/>
prepared, or willing, to defend it & I&#39;m happy to see strong opinions<br/>
- it makes for much more in-depth discussions & I&#39;m totally happy to<br/>
reveal how I came to my conclusions.  I respect everyone on this list<br/>
& I think I&#39;m safe to say that most of us are unconventional, even<br/>
visionary thinkers - even if some have &#39;had&#39; to un-unschool their<br/>
children based on pressure from people or circumstances, the fact that<br/>
they&#39;re on this list means that many more people are, at least,<br/>
exposed to the concept. Of course, some may be here to make judgments<br/>
& use this list&#39;s attitudes & revelations as a way to formulate<br/>
arguments against unschooling.  I&#39;m not so naive as to believe this is<br/>
impossible.<br/>
<br/>
My opinions are not based on some heinous happenings, bad memories<br/>
(although I was teased for wearing glasses, being a bookworm and my<br/>
religious beliefs) or vendetta - in fact I was taught in 3rd grade by<br/>
grandmother! - I used to walk to school with her - some of my best<br/>
memories ever! - However, she was old-school strict & retired early,<br/>
regretfully, due to parental interference - although she&#39;d have past<br/>
students come visit her at least once a week, telling the class that<br/>
she was their favorite teacher ever!  My uncle is/was a principal (not<br/>
sure if he&#39;s retired) & there were many educators in my family -<br/>
All-in-all, I  had a rather good, successful, school experience - did<br/>
well, had a good rep, graduated with honors & was offered a 4-yr<br/>
scholarship to LSU based on my ACT score.  So, I really have no axe to<br/>
grind.  I didn&#39;t know anyone who was home-schooled whilst growing up,<br/>
but I did know quite a few people who left as soon as they reached the<br/>
&#39;legal&#39; age to do so & who had the truant officer tracking them down<br/>
before they reached the appropriate age.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - I didn&#39;t come up with that appellation, however, I did 13 years<br/>
in it - so based on personal experience  I thought it a clever<br/>
catch-all phrase - remember - almost EVERYBODY from politicians to<br/>
criminals (is there a difference?...) came from a public school system<br/>
- except for those small percentage who got private<br/>
schooling/tutoring, obviously.  Whatever was &quot;good&quot; about the system<br/>
is mostly gone & as was pointed out several times by others - it&#39;s<br/>
more for social interaction or the so-called &#39;socialization&#39; which<br/>
DOES NOT mean acquiring more social graces (so parents think) although<br/>
it definitely teaches A LOT about human nature & competition - it<br/>
means becoming more acclimated to a certain/particular controlled<br/>
environment (&#39;official&#39; definition(s) at the end of the email)  - And<br/>
did anyone know that in some states, parents can actually GO TO JAIL<br/>
if their kids miss too much school - I&#39;m serious!  (Again, I know of<br/>
someone who really experienced this scenario.)<br/>
<br/>
I find it rather interesting & sorta humorous that some are taking<br/>
issue with my apparent intolerance for public schooling - I&#39;m not the<br/>
intolerant one - below is the govt&#39;s idea (pretty recent, I might add,<br/>
and chilling...) please note that it does not mention the 3 R&#39;s,<br/>
critical thinking, career skills, etc as the primary purpose, which<br/>
makes them, at the highest, secondary, I&#39;m looking for the whole<br/>
decision, to see if these aspects are mentioned at all:<br/>

The Purpose of Public Schooling<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A primary purpose of the educational system is to train school<br/>
children in good citizenship, patriotism and loyalty to the state and<br/>
the nation as a means of protecting the public welfare.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Justice H. Walter Croskey, in the opinion holding that California<br/>
parents do not have the right to home school their children.<br/>
<br/>
The term &quot;fascist&quot; has been overused, and in any case I know nothing<br/>
about Croskey&#39;s views on economics. But I find it extraordinary that<br/>
he would be willing to explicitly argue that public schools exist<br/>
largely to indoctrinate children in views the government approves of,<br/>
with or without the consent of their parents.<br/>
<br/>
I came across the quote in a webbed essay on the decision. It reminded<br/>
me of an old academic article by John Lott in which he conjectured<br/>
that the reason schooling was so widely provided by governments was as<br/>
a way of reducing the cost of controlling their populations, and<br/>
offered some statistical evidence in support. One version of the paper<br/>
is available online. (A: I put the link following:)<br/>

Public Schooling, Indoctrination, and Totalitarianism<br/>

Abstract:     <br/>
Governments use public education and public ownership of schools and<br/>
the media to control the information that their citizens receive. More<br/>
totalitarian governments as well as those with larger wealth transfers<br/>
make greater investments in publicly controlled information. This<br/>
finding is borne out from cross sectional time-series evidence across<br/>
countries, and is confirmed when specifically examining the recent<br/>
fall of communism. My results reject the standard public good&#39;s view<br/>
linking education and democracy, and I find evidence that public<br/>
educational expenditures vary in similar ways to government ownership<br/>
of television stations.<br/>

&quot;Leslie Heimov, executive director of the Children&#39;s Law Center of Los<br/>
Angeles, which represented the Longs&#39; two children in the case, said<br/>
the ruling did not change the law.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They just affirmed that the current California law, which has been<br/>
unchanged since the last time it was ruled on in the 1950s, is that<br/>
children have to be educated in a public school, an accredited private<br/>
school, or with an accredited tutor,&quot; she said. &quot;If they want to send<br/>
them to a private Christian school, they can, but they have to<br/>
actually go to the school and be taught by teachers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heimov said her organization&#39;s chief concern was not the quality of<br/>
the children&#39;s education, but their &quot;being in a place daily where they<br/>
would be observed by people who had a duty to ensure their ongoing<br/>
safety.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(A:  Seems this lawyer thinks that parents don&#39;t feel the &#39;duty&#39; to<br/>
ensure their children&#39;s &#39;ongoing safety,&#39; or else, that someone else<br/>
can do a better job.)<br/>

AGAINST SCHOOL How public education cripples our kids, and why By John<br/>
Taylor Gatto<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.spinninglobe.net/againstschool.htm">http://www.spinninglobe.net/againstschool.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;Inglis breaks down the purpose - the actual purpose - of modem<br/>
schooling into six basic functions, any one of which is enough to curl<br/>
the hair of those innocent enough to believe the three traditional<br/>
goals listed earlier:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
    1) The adjustive or adaptive function. Schools are to establish<br/>
fixed habits of reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes<br/>
critical judgment completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea<br/>
that useful or interesting material should be taught, because you<br/>
can&#39;t test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make<br/>
kids learn, and do, foolish and boring things. <br/>
     <br/>
    2) The integrating function. This might well be called &quot;the<br/>
conformity function,&quot; because its intention is to make children as<br/>
alike as possible. People who conform are predictable, and this is of<br/>
great use to those who wish to harness and manipulate a large labor<br/>
force. <br/>
     <br/>
    3) The diagnostic and directive function. School is meant to<br/>
determine each student&#39;s proper social role. This is done by logging<br/>
evidence mathematically and anecdotally on cumulative records. As in<br/>
&quot;your permanent record.&quot; Yes, you do have one. <br/>
 <br/>
    4) The differentiating function. Once their social role has been<br/>
&quot;diagnosed,&quot; children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far<br/>
as their destination in the social machine merits - and not one step<br/>
further. So much for making kids their personal best.<br/>
<br/>
    5) The selective function. This refers not to human choice at all<br/>
but to Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection as applied to what he<br/>
called &quot;the favored races.&quot; In short, the idea is to help things along<br/>
by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are<br/>
meant to tag the unfit - with poor grades, remedial placement, and<br/>
other punishments - clearly enough that their peers will accept them<br/>
as inferior and effectively bar them from the reproductive<br/>
sweepstakes. That&#39;s what all those little humiliations from first<br/>
grade onward were intended to do: wash the dirt down the drain.<br/>
<br/>
    6) The propaedeutic function. The societal system implied by these<br/>
rules will require an elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small<br/>
fraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this<br/>
continuing project, how to watch over and control a population<br/>
deliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might<br/>
proceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient<br/>
labor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But there is some hope:<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who may be facing legal challenges - but bear in mind that<br/>
these are circa 2003:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would unschoolers support public schooling? You missed the point.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s making decisions for their children based on their own  <br/>
negative opinions about something -- eg, preventing kids from going  <br/>
to school because the parent thinks it&#39;s a bad place -- that&#39;s not  <br/>
going to move that person closer to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s loads of things to fear in this world. There are high trees  <br/>
with slippery branches. There are cars on the road not able to stop  <br/>
for a child. There are commercials on TV working hard at manipulating  <br/>
kids into buying. There&#39;s sugar everywhere that will make kids mean  <br/>
and bounce off the walls. There&#39;s schools ready to indoctrinate our  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
If we stand between our kids and what we fear, we draw more attention  <br/>
to it and often make it more attractive in its forbiddenness. While  <br/>
we parents intend our stance to say &quot;I&#39;m willing to defend you  <br/>
against anything!&quot; what it says to the child is &quot;I don&#39;t trust that  <br/>
you&#39;re stronger than this.&quot; Some kids will take that message to heart  <br/>
and believe they&#39;re weak and need protected. Some kids will see it as  <br/>
a challenge and want to test themselves against it.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping kids from school because you fear its effects is no clearer  <br/>
thinking than sending kids to school because you fear inadequacy in  <br/>
teaching them.<br/>
<br/>
A better mindset for unschooling is to *invite* kids home because you  <br/>
feel it&#39;s a better place. *Make* it a better place. But if kids get  <br/>
curious about school, the way to make them want school more is to say  <br/>
&quot;No, I won&#39;t let you go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Staying home without a choice is no better than going to school  <br/>
without a choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577350182">No, I did not miss the point - I understand very much that the more<br/>
forbidden fruit is perceived as sweeter - I did &#39;grow up&#39; with Adam &<br/>
Eve, as such ;)  <br/>
<br/>
That being said - My children have never made an issue about going to<br/>
school, even my 14yo, so you can call this more of a mental exercise<br/>
on my part.  In fact, my 8yo went to school with her 7yo cousin & saw<br/>
what it was like first hand & my 14yo went to school with her 12yo<br/>
cousin, ditto.  Because of our lifestyle, my children are free to<br/>
spend several weeks at a time with my family 500 miles away, they vie<br/>
for the privilege to go/stay, however they end up there, brought or<br/>
picked up.  My oldest son was stuck there for 6 weeks+ due to Katrina,<br/>
but I didn&#39;t overly worry about him because I trust my & DH&#39;s family<br/>
(& I could chirp my family via Nextel & communicate).<br/>
<br/>
As to my oldest, she&#39;s mostly silent - she wakes up early for church<br/>
every Sunday to see her friends & has a very active myspace presence -<br/>
most of her family & friends are on there - so she keeps more in touch<br/>
with them than ever possible in the past <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t attribute all of her seeming & occasional resentment &<br/>
brooding to my so-called &#39;forbidding&#39; public school - that&#39;s her<br/>
personality - opposite of mine in many respects - I&#39;m talkative (no<br/>
kidding, huh) she&#39;s more silent - I&#39;m &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; as my DH told<br/>
me, she&#39;s more reserved & solemn & somber & very discreet (totally not<br/>
frivolous) - & so forth - she&#39;s been this way since toddlerhood -<br/>
she&#39;s always had a lot of personal freedom since she could make<br/>
choices - picked out her own clothes (my sisters used to frown on her<br/>
&quot;hoochie mama&quot; outfits but now she&#39;s totally conservative), went to<br/>
bed when she fell asleep, time to herself, watched videos/TV, played<br/>
mostly unlimited on the computer & video games, chooses her own music<br/>
& loads it on her ipod, is a whiz at pretty much all things computer<br/>
(from hooking it up to troubleshooting) calls whomever she wants to,<br/>
etc - she has had a jealous nature & has been very mean to her younger<br/>
sibs in the past, especially her brother 3.5 years younger, & her<br/>
first, first cousin, 2 years younger, whom she&#39;s made cry on several<br/>
occasions (of course, they love each other very much & her behavior<br/>
has improved) but let me put it this way, she has been used as a<br/>
reason to NOT allow a child &#39;too&#39; much freedom in my family, sad to<br/>
say - perhaps, I haven&#39;t been able to relate to her, perhaps, I<br/>
haven&#39;t understood her - I&#39;m sorry for that but it isn&#39;t for lack of<br/>
trying...&lt;sigh&gt; & I&#39;ve learned from my mistakes - we do have<br/>
discussions at times & I&#39;m relieved that she is very sensible & has<br/>
pretty good critical thinking skills.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, as toddlers & a little older, they expressed interest mostly when<br/>
we were near a school yard with lots of children playing outside &<br/>
lots of cool outside toys - I would tell them that the children didn&#39;t<br/>
play outside all the time - they had to go inside & that a lot of<br/>
parents had to work so put their children in pre-k or school because<br/>
they didn&#39;t know what else to do or didn&#39;t have any nearby family to<br/>
take care of their children & that the fun & games pretty much stopped<br/>
once they reached a certain age (kindergarten is not really a fair<br/>
indication of the rest of school) - I told them that you had to get up<br/>
really early (haha that&#39;s a big deterrent here) you could only go to<br/>
the bathroom at certain times (recess, or asking permission, rarely<br/>
granted) you have to eat when you were scheduled to eat, lack of<br/>
freedom of movement, etc. (just matters of fact) oh yeah, and that<br/>
most kids in school REALLY HATED being there (even if it was because<br/>
they missed their favorite soap operas)- longed for eternal recess &<br/>
summer vacation.<br/>
<br/>
I told them the goods things that I could remember - like I could go<br/>
to the library at school, I enjoyed learning, I was able to be in the<br/>
talented & gifted program, great fun, although I mostly saw school as<br/>
an interruption of my reading - lol, I even enjoyed P.E., walked in<br/>
the Prom Court (which was pretty open of my parents - against the<br/>
prevailing thought of most in our congregation) & represented my<br/>
school on TV on a varsity quiz show & at those school competitions<br/>
(again pretty open of my parents, but, boy, did I feel ignorant<br/>
compared to a lot of these kids) Most of the social activities didn&#39;t<br/>
happen until about 15 or so (whatever age 10th grade).  So, I didn&#39;t<br/>
paint a terribly, totally bad picture of school - but it &#39;ain&#39;t&#39; the<br/>
same anymore - like the schools I went to are now requiring uniforms!<br/>
 unheard of!  & the even more restrictions & monitoring are unreal...<br/>
<br/>
Then we have family & friends who insist on putting their kids in<br/>
school no matter what their child wants, even when the mom is a SAHM.<br/>
 My children saw that they couldn&#39;t visit us & their whole lives<br/>
revolved around the school&#39;s schedule for the better part of the year<br/>
(as you may have picked up, I&#39;m from Louisiana, so it has been very<br/>
prominent in our lives as a reason why their aunts, mostly,(adults w/o<br/>
fulltime jobs) & cousins can&#39;t visit since it&#39;s a 500 mile trip) well,<br/>
the offshoot of these discussions is that they would call schools &quot;kid<br/>
jails&quot; & that was that - pretty much all I told them were my experiences.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do think you missed my point, or perhaps I left it too<br/>
vague - the subject line states &quot;Why I call it &quot;the public fool<br/>
system&quot; NOT &quot;Why I don&#39;t put my kids in school&quot; or &quot;My opinion as to<br/>
the motive for public schooling&quot; - I call it the public fool system<br/>
because it&#39;s stated intent was to &#39;dumb down&#39; the nation&#39;s children,<br/>
to make fools of the public as those who pose no threat or challenge<br/>
to the &#39;establishment.&#39; But, please, don&#39;t believe me, look it up<br/>
yourself, blame the creators, not the victims or the whistle-blowers,<br/>
I didn&#39;t write the Communist Manifesto. I haven&#39;t tried to destroy<br/>
individual sovereignty. I haven&#39;t tried to divide the family or<br/>
trample parental rights. I don&#39;t profit off of ignorance &/or the lack<br/>
of critical thinking skills.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just calling it, more like pointing out, what it is/has been<br/>
revealed to be - not out of fear - sort of like a pinkish animal with<br/>
a snout who grunts & squeals with a curly tail & squinty eyes, is a<br/>
pig (usually) it&#39;s not a judgment - it&#39;s a pig - even though calling<br/>
someone a pig is (usually) an insult or meant as such - calling an<br/>
actual pig a pig is neutral, not a &#39;negative opinion.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
While we parents intend our stance to say &quot;I&#39;m willing to defend you  <br/>
against anything!&quot; what it says to the child is &quot;I don&#39;t trust that  <br/>
you&#39;re stronger than this.&quot; Some kids will take that message to heart<br/>
and believe they&#39;re weak and need protected. Some kids will see it as<br/>
a challenge and want to test themselves against it.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True, true, but our parental obligation IS to protect our children -<br/>
until they&#39;re old enough to make, & take the consequences of, their<br/>
decisions, preferably without harming anyone or their property ;) <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t &#39;defend&#39; a child against everything but our children do have<br/>
to believe that we will fight the battles they are unable to fight<br/>
until such time as they can (if ever) - let&#39;s face it - babies don&#39;t<br/>
make a choice whether to be breastfed or formula fed - that&#39;s usually<br/>
a convenience or comfort choice (yes, I&#39;m aware that not all can<br/>
breastfeed or be breastfed, as such) but the benefits of breastfeeding<br/>
far, far, far outweigh formula & babies who nurse benefit immensely<br/>
from this &#39;non-choice.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Staying home without a choice is no better than going to school  <br/>
without a choice.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I totally disagree, staying home is almost always a better<br/>
&quot;non-choice&quot; (yes, I&#39;ve learned that I have to qualify everything I<br/>
say here - hence why my emails are so long) by leaps & bounds - kids<br/>
aren&#39;t traumatized by &quot;first-day-at-home&quot; illnesses and panic attacks<br/>
& a home/family is FAR more likely to put the child&#39;s individual<br/>
interest(s) & protection first - I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d say that,<br/>
really & what about the parent&#39;s choice, is that a non-issue?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to &#39;invite&#39; my children, as such, as self-paced,<br/>
home-learning is all they&#39;ve ever known - they are totally fine with<br/>
it :) We all want to know what&#39;s on the other side of the fence, we<br/>
all want to know how other people live, it&#39;s just natural curiosity,<br/>
until we &#39;walk a mile in their moccasins, then we decide our own life<br/>
was quite fine - as I tell people - I&#39;ve never stopped learning - I<br/>
learn something everyday - even from my own children - imagine that -<br/>
to me you have an obligation to educate yourself - and as I&#39;ve always<br/>
said - ignorance isn&#39;t bliss - it&#39;s what you don&#39;t know that can kill you.<br/>

Calling it that, and information such as &quot;the offshoot of these  <br/>

fear or hatred of formula.  And they nursed whenever they wanted to.   <br/>
So that was a choice every moment that they suckled and ever moment  <br/>
that I made it easy for them to do so.  Choices, choices, choices, by  <br/>
the moment, all day and all night.  I wasn&#39;t fighting a battle for  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, my take on it is this... I can pretty much agree with much of what<br/>
you said about public school.  I&#39;ve done the reading and really &quot;get&quot;<br/>
it.  I keep that knowledge of what I don&#39;t like about school and the<br/>
school system tucked away in a brain fold in the back of my head.<br/>
<br/>
What I absolutely came to realize, is that it can&#39;t be front and center.<br/>
I have to keep that space for creating a happy home and life for my<br/>
family, mainly my kids.  It&#39;s a bit like yin/yang for me, the existence<br/>
of what I run from, figuratively of course, and what I run towards,<br/>
which is significantly more wonderful than what I run away from!<br/>
<br/>
My husband and my older daughter know why I dislike school, it&#39;s not<br/>
like I keep my feelings and ideas a secret.  They are free to make their<br/>
own conclusions about it.  It&#39;s not something that I talk about all the<br/>
time even, it comes up in conversation here and there since school is<br/>
pretty pervasive in our culture.  I try very hard to be objective about<br/>
it, especially when talking with my children.<br/>
<br/>
My own experience, is that school was ok, but, in general a waste of<br/>
time, that is how it felt for years and years for me.  One of my<br/>
favorite friends in the neighborhood was homeschooled.  She had time and<br/>
freedom to make and create, which is what I desperately wanted to be<br/>
able to do.  That feeling of time wasted with knowing that it could be<br/>
different, was a piece of the whole of what made us choose to<br/>
homeschool.  The other piece was what I really disliked about school,<br/>
the loss of individuality, the cookie cutter, number/money thing. <br/>
Again, the running towards and away.  Always though, I try to run<br/>
towards something much much better than what I am getting away from.<br/>

I tried to keep some balance - I wanted my kids to know why we didn&#39;t  <br/>

something happened and they had to go. I wanted them to know that they  <br/>

them because they&#39;ve chosen school!  Occasionally we will meet people<br/>
that really don&#39;t like many o&#39; things about school, but don&#39;t know<br/>
anything different.  For those people, it&#39;s even better to set an<br/>
example, through words and actions, that shows how wonderful it &quot;could&quot;<br/>
be!<br/>
<br/>
One reason that started me in that direction was my mother in law.  She<br/>
works for the public school system and is highly invested in it.  Yet,<br/>
she is extremely accepting of our choices.  It would be futile to rant<br/>
to her about school, she doesn&#39;t see the ugliness that school can be. <br/>
It is sooo much better for her to see and hear about how awesome<br/>
unschooling or homeschooling is!  So that is what we share, all the<br/>
wonderful things we are doing, it just sort of overflowed into other<br/>
conversations with people, so much so, that it became the primary way of<br/>
how we convey unschooling.</div>

steps is for people to turn their backs on school. Your post was all  <br/>
too much about looking at school in minute detail. So, no, I didn&#39;t  <br/>
miss it. I ignored the parts that weren&#39;t relevant to helping parents  <br/>
face their kids rather than face school.<br/>
<br/>
This current post is way too defensive about your and your children&#39;s  <br/>
interactions with school. The discussion should be about ideas  <br/>
not ... all that thrashing about defending what you&#39;ve done about  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Really, it&#39;s lots more useful for people trying to unschool to not  <br/>
pay so much attention to school. I&#39;ve got a school that borders two  <br/>
sides of my yard. My daughter goes over there for x-country (and went  <br/>
for 2 classes last year.) I don&#39;t give it anywhere near as much  <br/>
thought as you&#39;ve spilled into two humongously long posts!<br/>

what&#39;s behind us. Come up to the front of the bus and talk about  <br/>
where we&#39;re going and better ways to not be tempted to look out the  <br/>

<br/>
Children also want the freedom to explore.<br/>
<br/>
We can support them by helping them find safe and respectful ways to  <br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
But  &quot;our parental obligation IS to protect our children&quot; is stated  <br/>
too much like a rule. The most controlling parent could say the exact  <br/>
same thing as they turn off the TV set and toss out the candy bar.  <br/>

parent made the child.<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s better for a parent to make a child stay home  <br/>
than allowing a child to choose to try school?<br/>
<br/>
 From my point of view, it&#39;s only &quot;better&quot; in the eyes of someone who  <br/>
fears school.<br/>

whenever they want, suffer first day illnesses and panic attacks?  <br/>
Those are reactions to having no choice.<br/>
<br/>
If a child from an unschooling home wanted not to go to school one  <br/>
day, they&#39;d stay home. No reason to resort to an illness!<br/>
<br/>
But I can very easily imagine similar &quot;illnesses&quot; in kids who are  <br/>
forced to stay home against their will.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I can protect my daughter much better if she never goes to a  <br/>
camp, never visits a friend, never gets in a car with someone who  <br/>
isn&#39;t me driving (but I let Sandra drive her and Kat survived despite  <br/>
Sandra&#39;s fears ;-), never walks through the doors of the school.<br/>
<br/>
It helps unschooling a whole lot more to discuss how we can support  <br/>
our children&#39;s explorations, even into areas that make us nervous.  <br/>
TV, non-organic food, sugar, school. Those are all things parents  <br/>
might want to protect their kids from. (And there have been  huge  <br/>
posts full of expert excerpts from fearful parents trying to  <br/>
enlighten us on our apparent ignorance of all of those.) But we don&#39;t  <br/>
help parents unschool better by supporting their need to hold onto  <br/>
their kids. We help by helping parents look objectively at their  <br/>
fears, look for ways to deal with the real problems and breathe  <br/>
through the fears.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what about the parent&#39;s choice, is that a non-issue?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Parent&#39;s choice about what? It&#39;s not the parent&#39;s childhood. It&#39;s the  <br/>
child&#39;s. To help our kids grow we help them find ways to explore in  <br/>
safe and respectful ways. Sometimes they&#39;ll want to explore things  <br/>
that make us uncomfortable, that we&#39;d rather they didn&#39;t. If a parent  <br/>
can&#39;t see past their fears, it useful to post here to gain some  <br/>
clarity. Others can often more readily see what are real problems and  <br/>
what are imagined problems and help find ways to deal with the real  <br/>
problems to support the child&#39;s exploration.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To educate myself about school? Just because I don&#39;t read all the  <br/>
negative things about school doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m blind to what it is.  <br/>
But I *also* trust that my daughter is intelligent and perceptive and  <br/>
can see school a whole lot more clearly than the kids who are  <br/>
required to be there.<br/>
<br/>
I think a huge and common mistake people make in relating to others  <br/>
is in assuming that just because someone isn&#39;t responding with  <br/>
protection to a fear that they must be ignorant. It&#39;s *hard* stepping  <br/>
back and looking at situations objectively. It&#39;s *hard* to set aside  <br/>
nagging fears and *hard* to trust the contingencies set up for the  <br/>
more likely real possibilities.<br/>

college in Detroit. Carl drove her out from Boston, she spent two  <br/>
weeks there and flew back home on her own. She&#39;d never been away for  <br/>
more than 2 nights to a friend&#39;s house. *Don&#39;t* think that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
hard for the two of us. But we did what we could to support her  <br/>
*despite* our fears.<br/>
<br/>
This summer she wanted to visit a girl in Chicago she met through  <br/>
Deviantart and had been talking to on the phone for 6 months. *Don&#39;t*  <br/>
think that wasn&#39;t hard and fearful for us just because we helped her  <br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
Now she wants to go to Poland after Christmas. (You new unschoolers  <br/>
think about that next time your child wants to ride beyond the block  <br/>
on their bike. It *doesn&#39;t* get easier! ;-) How many parents would  <br/>
say flat out no? But just because we&#39;ve said yes doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s  <br/>
not hard and all sorts of fears aren&#39;t popping up. But what do we  <br/>
gain by saying no? A more peaceful life? If we want a peaceful life,  <br/>
it&#39;s *way* better not to have kids! What does she gain? A missed  <br/>
opportunity? A demonstration that it&#39;s better to choose easy over  <br/>
adventure? Much better to help her expand her world in safe ways than  <br/>
to pull back in fear.<br/>

When someone describes school in a positive way and STILL makes  <br/>
homeschooling way more alluring, that&#39;s going to easily be a better  <br/>
homeschooling situation than one where school has been described as a  <br/>
hellhole, and anything seems better than that.<br/>

You can unschool your children without thinking of school as evil or<br/>

To the degree that unschooling is a reaction against school, that&#39;s just<br/>

camp, never visits a friend, never gets in a car with someone who<br/>
isn&#39;t me driving (but I let Sandra drive her and Kat survived despite<br/>
Sandra&#39;s fears ;-), never walks through the doors of the school.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a little twinge of fearful awareness when I&#39;m transporting  <br/>
someone&#39;s only child.  Okay, big twinge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But by those protection arguments, we shouldn&#39;t have trees in our  <br/>
yard.  Kids might climb them, or the trees might fall on kids.  (One  <br/>
of our trees is leaning right now.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe beds should have sidebars like in hospitals.  They must be safe  <br/>
and helpful, or hospitals wouldn&#39;t have them.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is riding in a jeep without doors.  Keith is riding a  <br/>
motorcycle.  Either I don&#39;t love them at all, or I&#39;m willing to go  <br/>
along with their dangerous choices knowing they&#39;re intelligent and  <br/>
aware of the risks.  I do love them.  I could rant and rail and show  <br/>
them photos of people who&#39;ve been in accidents and make them really  <br/>
unhappy, make them like me less, and not make them any safer at all,  <br/>
but I&#39;ve decided not to do that.   People have died under the safest  <br/>
of conditions.  People have lived through some of the worst.<br/>
<br/>
Every moment we choose where to be, what to do, what to talk about,  <br/>
what to write or what to think, we&#39;re moving toward or away from our  <br/>
goals.  If the goal is clear, the choices are easier.<br/>

too much school no matter whether the thoughts are positive, negative  <br/>

&gt; whenever they want, suffer first day illnesses and panic attacks?  <br/>
&gt; Those are reactions to having no choice.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
There have been some very interesting threads these last few days. <br/>
Especially interesting to me because Lydia, 11 has decided to give<br/>
school a try this year. <br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t want to try to keep her home by scaring her.  Yes, I&#39;ve<br/>
read Gatto and to be honest, all that conspiracy talk just is too much<br/>
negativity to have in my life. <br/>
<br/>
Lydia went to school because most of her close friends go there and I<br/>
believe she really needed to find out for herself what it is like.  I<br/>
kept her very busy here at home and we had a lot of fun.  But she<br/>
really wanted more socially and she thinks that school is the answer. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re 3 weeks in and it&#39;s going ok for her.  She believes me (now)<br/>
about all the boring, rote memorization, worthless work they do in<br/>
school.  She learned that for herself though.  AND I appreciate that<br/>
she even questions... me!<br/>
She wasn&#39;t nervous at all about going to school, she was excited and<br/>
she has made a lot of friends already.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were laying in bed reading and talking and she asked me<br/>
if I wished she was still at home.  I told her yea, but more<br/>
importantly was that I want her to be happy.  And if school makes her<br/>
happy than I&#39;m glad she&#39;s trying it.  I then asked her if she wished<br/>
she would have started school earlier and she said, &quot;no way, being<br/>
home is way better!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
School has provided a chance to talk about public school and<br/>
standardized test and memorizing and all the things about school that<br/>
are reasons I decided not to send mine.  I&#39;m sure quite a few people<br/>
have gone to public school and are still able to think critically and<br/>
look outside the box.  Not everyone there gets brainwashed!  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter has even watched Disney (on a regular basis) and doesn&#39;t<br/>
own a Hannah Montana or Jonas brothers item at all!  <br/>
<br/>
Letting Lydia go has improved our relationship.  She&#39;s learned to<br/>
trust me and more importantly she learned that I really trust her (I<br/>
let her do something that I wouldn&#39;t chose for her). I think she was<br/>
questioning what we were doing here at home, wondering if we were<br/>
normal and wondering if she fit in (academically and socially).  She&#39;s<br/>
finding out (for herself) that we are a pretty cool family, even if we<br/>
do things differently and she&#39;s finding out that she fits in and is<br/>
able to make friends where ever she goes.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope she comes home and back to our unschooling lives.  But I still<br/>
consider her an unschooler who has just decided to check out the way<br/>
the other half (or 90%) live.  If she does come home, she&#39;ll never<br/>
have to question it/herself again!<br/>
<br/>
So, no I guess I&#39;m not an unschooler anymore, but Lydia sure has the<br/>
outlook of a kid who&#39;s been unschooled.  It&#39;s amazing actually!! <br/>
She&#39;s light years ahead of where I was at 11!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; -pam<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES!  Thank you for this - it really resonated because it describes<br/>
exactly what I&#39;ve been forgetting lately.  Years ago, when my oldest<br/>
was a baby, unschooling &quot;caught my imagination&quot; too, and something in<br/>
me just knew instinctively the truth of what a sweet lifestyle it<br/>
would be, and how deeply I too wanted it for my family.  I am very<br/>
much prone to emotional ups and downs, and sometimes I lose sight of<br/>
the beauty of what can happen when I actually allow it to catch my<br/>
imagination again instead of getting caught up in day to day issues.  <br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;sparkly&quot; has been catching my attention in a number of<br/>
posts, too.  I love this metaphor but it is making me painfully aware<br/>
of how much sparkle we seem to have lost in recent years.  Anybody<br/>
have suggestions on how they keep sweetness and sparkle in their<br/>
unschooling life? Is it just a matter of attitude, do you think, or<br/>
are there actual, concrete things you do to increase the odds of<br/>
experiencing life that way?  Have other people experienced &quot;valleys&quot;<br/>
in their unschool journey?  I have three kids ages 13, 10 and 5 who&#39;ve<br/>
always been unschooled.  <br/>

I&#39;m not sure what this is good for except another data point:  Holly  <br/>

<br/>
I wasn&#39;t, except for being dazzled by my own good grades.  But one of  <br/>
the worst cases of brainwashing I&#39;ve seen, or of balking resistence  <br/>
rather, was someone who objected to being asked to use critical  <br/>
thinking, because that sounded like school to her, and she didn&#39;t  <br/>
want to do anything that was like school.   That&#39;s totally throwing  <br/>
out the baby with the bathwater.<br/>
<br/>
At school I used to read and go to the bathroom and write notes to my  <br/>
friends.  I still do those things.  I used to sing; I still do.  I  <br/>
used to be analytical about writing and research; I still am.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-She&#39;s light years ahead of where I was at 11!-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly, me, 16.<br/>
<br/>
Today I was having impatient thoughts about something she was doing,  <br/>
and I thought she should realize blah blah blah, and then I  <br/>
thought... when I was her age I would have reacted WAY more  <br/>
dramatically, and the realizations I was thinking she should have  <br/>
were things I learned in my 30&#39;s.  She&#39;s nearly there, though--nearly  <br/>
as aware as I was in my 30&#39;s. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a 24 year old boyfriend who has said a couple of times in  <br/>
one context or another that he was an adult.  Technically he is, but  <br/>
there are many ways in which Holly is more experienced and centered  <br/>
and aware than he is.  There are things he knows and has done too,  <br/>
which is great, but he&#39;s still got the parental guilt-hooks in him  <br/>
pretty deeply.  He&#39;s been overly-controlled and shamed for a long  <br/>
time (24 years).<br/>
