<br/>
My 9yr old, who really isn&#39;t reading, started carrying a notebook around<br/>
with him. For a month, he drew pictures. The other day, he told me he was<br/>
writing stories. Yesterday, he said spontaneously, &quot;I love writing!.&quot; And,<br/>
best of all, this perfectionist also said, &quot;I&#39;m spelling everything wrong,<br/>
but I don&#39;t care.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what he&#39;s writing about because he&#39;s firmly told me that all<br/>
his stories are private. Ah well..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is very cool! And what  great idea to illustrate it that way. I&#39;ll have<br/>
to tell my son about that. His internal world of characters and conflicts<br/>
revolves around the Lego guys and he&#39;s always telling stories about them.<br/>
He&#39;d love to make a visual story about them that way.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing about writing. My son (6) will say that he can&#39;t read, but he<br/>
just wrote a 8-page book called &quot;Battl in Spase&quot;. It&#39;s totally spelled<br/>
phonetically, but he wrote out a whole story on his own and illustrated it.<br/>
I love the different paths they can find.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great that you have conquered that particular fear (and it&#39;s such a<br/>
strong one in our culture) and allowed him to find this passion in his own<br/>
way! His story sounds marvelous.<br/>
