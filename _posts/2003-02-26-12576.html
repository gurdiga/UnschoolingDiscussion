<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; It strikes me as a somewhat rash judgement to critize an entire group of<br/>
&gt; people without spending some serious time there considering their position,<br/>
&gt; and such.  Especially since many of the people here regular posters there.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, I&#39;ve left some parties quickly because they seemed<br/>
&gt; dangerous or stupid, and more often than that I&#39;ve stayed and regretted it.<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  But did you denounce them in another public forum for the<br/>
impression you got in your short time there?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what bothered me.<br/>
