&gt;&gt; Ned, many of us have said we enjoyed your posts on your family&#39;s unschooling<br/>
&gt;&gt; journey. Maybe we could get back to those?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes please.  I&#39;ve really found your unschooling posts useful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ned, not wanting to intrude, says:<br/>
Thank you so much. For those who don&#39;t know, Luz and I have been given<br/>
permission to post several articles  on a website: the name/page is as<br/>
fillows:<br/>
www.borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>
<br/>
For anecdotes about our unschooling/raising our kid, I thought I&#39;d save<br/>
space here by not including that. As some of you have noticed, I am a<br/>
candidate for the support group called &quot;On-anon-anon&quot; even without bragging<br/>
about our son and my children by my four previous wives. OOOOOooooooo<br/>
<br/>
Some people like some of the things I write, and some don&#39;t. It&#39;s hard to<br/>
tell what to write. Unschooling, for Luz and me, was ANYTHING BUT SCHOOLING<br/>
unless the kid begs for it, so I reckoned that this group is sophisticated<br/>
and could handle some topics that relate to our homeschooling rights. But<br/>
no, that is not to some people&#39;s liking because that would mean talking<br/>
about the  politics or economics behind those rights.<br/>
<br/>
 Should I repeat myself by posting the same articles here?  No.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not much to unschooling, really. Until a kid is about seven, it&#39;s<br/>
parenting, anyway, it&#39;s not even un-anything. Parenting is a huge<br/>
responsibility. Of course, we are constantly teaching our kids even when<br/>
we&#39;re trying not to. All those ideas get kicked around, all the prejudices,<br/>
opinions, all that information from living to adulthood. We even pass along<br/>
our conviction that we got from going to school...that we&#39;re not good<br/>
learners. <br/>
<br/>
If we get our kid to, say age 7, without turning him/her into a school-type<br/>
idiot (intellectual dependent) day-care zombie, we can say we&#39;ve been<br/>
unschooling all along, and we see that our kid has already learned a great<br/>
deal, and we have no idea how s/he did it.<br/>
<br/>
The trick at that time is to try to continue the same exact approach, and<br/>
the only thing that changes might be the actual activities you do. It&#39;s<br/>
always a good practice for parents to be deeply interested in things of<br/>
their own instead of being interested in making sure that the kids are<br/>
&quot;interested in&quot; stuff. Let the kids find their own stuff so they&#39;ll come and<br/>
tell you about them.<br/>
<br/>
Rich people have always been interested in seeing that their children<br/>
learned several skills of survival. That&#39;s what animals teach their kids,<br/>
too, so it just might make some sense in an evolutionary sense. The rich are<br/>
out sailing boats, or riding horses -- those take critical skills and an<br/>
urgency and self-dependency that people need when their taxes are due for an<br/>
audit, or when a young person applies for a job. Life is challenges. Kids<br/>
need to be prepared. It&#39;s what school can&#39;t do, because sitting in those<br/>
rows and being told about life by someone who has never lived (really) is an<br/>
artificial, second-hand, worthless waste of time.<br/>
<br/>
Shooting is a big deal now. There&#39;s hardly a stronger sense of urgency than<br/>
pulling a trigger and feeling the jolt of a bullet being kicked out by the<br/>
explosion and seeing what that bullet does to a wooden crate. If it is a<br/>
shotgun, all the more sensational and a giddy sense of accomplishment.<br/>
Don&#39;t like guns, archery teaches all sorts of important things. Kids need to<br/>
see something when they&#39;re done, so crafts are great. Anything.<br/>
<br/>
When I taught school (just 3 yrs, mercifully) I believed that the most<br/>
important thing was art. All 3 years, I had my classes (2nd grade, 3rd, 5+6<br/>
together) write books and illustrate it themselves, too. It took about two<br/>
months, maybe three. First, tell a story. Next write an outline and that<br/>
would be a list of chapter titles, so that each part of the outline would be<br/>
a short story inside the big one. Then, write a chapter every week. If you<br/>
can tell it, but can&#39;t write fast, I&#39;ll write it down as you tell it, and<br/>
then you copy it.<br/>
<br/>
So each week, every kid wrote a chapter, printed it out in various ways, and<br/>
made an illustration with paint or collage or pastels -- no crayons, no<br/>
markers -- too slap-dash most of the time...not sensual.  In Florida, the<br/>
5-6 grade books were placed on the big tables in the children&#39;s section of<br/>
the public library for all the town&#39;s children to read them. They were there<br/>
for several weeks and were well taken care of by the children. They loved<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
For homeschooling, it just might be the parent who needs to write the book<br/>
and let the kid see that you like writing your book, and illustrating it and<br/>
printing it and binding it with a beautiful cover, and putting it in a<br/>
special place. Kids like to be proud of what their parents do, even if they<br/>
don&#39;t show it. They brag to their friends.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of friends, they only need one. If they get more, and they want<br/>
them, fine, but they do need one. That is urgent business for a parent, in<br/>
case your child is lonely. Take your kid to places where there are kids --<br/>
craft centers, kid museums, playgrounds...until s/he finds a good friend,<br/>
someone to relate to in ways that are impossible for adults.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing a decent job of parenting, the kid comes into contact with a<br/>
variety of things, and is curious about some of them. If s/he trusts you<br/>
with his/her thoughts and doesn&#39;t expect a &quot;teaching moment&quot; from you every<br/>
time s/he asks you something, than maybe you&#39;ll discover what makes his/her<br/>
boat float, and you can actually do something to help out.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not about getting &#39;teaching&quot; ideas from other people. That&#39;s<br/>
school. Parents who are at a loss about how to unschool their kid and<br/>
believe that if they aren&#39;t unschooling them, the kid is &quot;wasting time.&quot;<br/>
Such a parent needs to discover his/her own interests and follow those, and<br/>
not try to get the kids to &quot;do stuff that&#39;s educational.&quot; Unschooling has<br/>
nothing at all to do with schooling. It has to do with living. The two are<br/>
not the same. Schooling has nothing to do with learning, either. If there&#39;s<br/>
any connection, it&#39;s coincidental.<br/>
<br/>
What schools teach has never had anything to do with what kids are<br/>
interested in. There&#39;s another one of those crazy absolutes for which some<br/>
of you will give exceptions. Fine.<br/>
<br/>
Kids mostly need to go out an play -- all the time. Let them invent their<br/>
own games, dig a hole, climb a tree -- all indispensible activities. The<br/>
more the better. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the Powerglide/HOP/&quot;teacher store&quot; discussion folks might do better,<br/>
and might be with more compatible/friendly people, if they went to a more<br/>
wussy list where such things are the usual fare -- the school-at-home crowd<br/>
instead of squirming in your chairs when somebody says &quot;school budget&quot; or<br/>
&quot;libertarian&quot; or &quot;Unalienable Rights.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And excuse me, but where is it carved that we need a thorough discussion,<br/>
or five, about whether or not there&#39;s a hell. Or a heaven. If ever there<br/>
were topics that don&#39;t teach anything, I would say those are prime examples.<br/>
Maybe those are candidates for &quot;moving to another list,&quot; as has been told to<br/>
me, making room for &quot;unschooling&quot; posts, whatever those are.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well what do you know, I found something to disagree with you about! <br/>
lol If people are interested in a discussion on heaven and hell, then <br/>
it does teach something.  What it teaches depends on where the <br/>
conversation leads and what the posters needed to get out of it.  <br/>
Then again, I didn&#39;t have a problem with political discussions <br/>
either. <br/>
<br/>
Another interesting aspect of the heaven/hell discussion is what to <br/>
do if you are firmly convicted that you have a responsibility to God <br/>
to teach your children about God and the Bible.  How do you do that <br/>
with unschooling?  <br/>

Probably the same way I &quot;teach&quot; my children about my concerns for our<br/>
environment, respect for others differences, etc. By example, through<br/>
stories and festivals, explaining WHY i do things, etc.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be Sunday school curriculum and church doctrine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ned, <br/>
I for one am one of those wussy folk questioning the merits of Powerglide. My <br/>
daughter wants to learn Spanish. She asked for something more in depth than <br/>
watching &quot;Standard Deviant&quot; or &quot;MUZZY&quot; videos. Having heard about the <br/>
Powerglide program, I wanted to get feedback. Of course exposure to native <br/>
speakers would be wonderful, if one has that option. I received great <br/>
feedback about Spanish language channels, internet sites, and other avenues <br/>
for learning. I also found out that Powerglide can be a wonderful option for <br/>
someone motivated to learn the language. This would not be a forced <br/>
curriculum. GAG! This is seeking recommendations from veteran unschoolers <br/>
about how their children have gone about learning a foreign language when <br/>
they were interested.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume though that those of us asking about such programs are not also <br/>
interested in the more heated discussions concerning unschooling. It is all <br/>
relevant to my learning about unschooling -- from the inflammatory debates to <br/>
the wussy inquiries. They all go together to help me provide an unschooling <br/>
environment for my family. <br/>
<br/>
I agree. The parents need to unschool before they can unschool their <br/>
children. All the way through graduate school, most of what I learned was on <br/>
my own. I can&#39;t say that it took long for me to discard the boxed curriculum <br/>
after I rescued my children from the horrors of public school (Ned, the <br/>
bathroom incident that you described brought back painful memories of what my <br/>
son endured). My children said it best, &quot;If we&#39;re going to do this, then send <br/>
us back to school. At least there we have some other kids to play with.&quot; I <br/>
knew that they were right. I just had to trust them to learn what they needed <br/>
or wanted. They are staunch defenders of homeschool now. &quot;We get to touch <br/>
things; no boring homework; are own schedule; whatever we want to do.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If you think those of us who ask questions about Powerglide, etc. are wussy <br/>
about unschooling, you&#39;ve never seen me on my soapbox when someone questions <br/>
homeschooling in general and unschooling specifically. Nowadays, you&#39;ll find <br/>
me on it frequently. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m not going anywhere. <br/>

If you read through the archives, you&#39;ll get a better feel for what people<br/>
mean by &quot;discussing unschooling.&quot; It&#39;s often a very busy list *just* with<br/>
the unschooling discussion.<br/>

<br/>
Reread what you wrote and think about it this way. You walk in on a bunch of<br/>
kids playing and try to teach them something. The kids say &quot;We don&#39;t want to<br/>
learn that. We want to play like we came here to do.&quot; Does an unschooling<br/>
parent say or think:<br/>
<br/>
1) &quot;No, this is really important and you *need* to know this,&quot; or<br/>
2) &quot;I thought you were sophisticated enough to handle it, but I guess not,&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
3) &quot;Oh, okay, you&#39;ll learn it if you ever find a need for it&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are some &quot;kids&quot; saying they do want to learn and it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
fair that the other kids are preventing that. That&#39;s perhaps a reason why<br/>
Helen wants this to play out here.<br/>
<br/>
So. Stopping with the insults will help. It fills up a lot of mailbox space<br/>
with people responding to them. And angry people write more than calm<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
My personal objection to your posts isn&#39;t the politics per se but to the<br/>
misinformation, the opinons phrased as facts and the inflammatory language.<br/>
Misinformation left unquestioned on the list makes good information look<br/>
questionable and makes the list look bad and makes me as a poster appear<br/>
less trustworthy.<br/>

too. I think most listmembers know me as being more interested in <br/>
discussing ideas, politics, policies, etc. than discussing resources <br/>
or what happened at the park last week. My youngest is 17 - my kids <br/>
are grown (unschooled all the way), and while my five granddaughters <br/>
are darling and all, the day-to-day concerns of unschooling aren&#39;t <br/>
where my interests generally lie. So maybe I&#39;m the one doing the list <br/>
a disservice here by not just unsubbing Mr. Vare and his rants?<br/>
