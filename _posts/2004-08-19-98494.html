<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133116599">I was forced to sit at the table every night until I fell asleep in my food.<br/>
Probably why I weighed 85 lbs. when I was 27 years old.  I&#39;m only 5 foot,<br/>
but I was very underweight.  I don&#39;t think I had an actual eating disorder,<br/>
but easily could have.  Forcing kids to eat is a power play.  I learned<br/>
every trick in the book to hide food or feed it to the dog.  My parents try<br/>
that garbage with my son, and I tell them that he eats what he wants.  They<br/>
don&#39;t try to force him like they did me, but they try all of those<br/>
manipulative tricks on him.  He tells them &quot;I&#39;M DONE, LEAVE ME ALONE&quot;.<br/>
Whenever they would take him somewhere or watch him for a few hours, the<br/>
first thing she tells me is what he ate.  It makes me crazy.  He is also<br/>
very small for his age and skinny.  My mom was so obsessed about his weight<br/>
when he was a baby.  Granted, he was a preemie and was very very small, so<br/>
it was hard not to.  It drove her crazy that he was breastfed and I couldn&#39;t<br/>
measure the amount he was getting.  Then, it drove her crazy that I let him<br/>
nurse whenever he cried.   They were so into the power struggles for<br/>
everything, sleeping, eating, potty training (hate that word).  We went in<br/>
the complete opposite direction with everything.  Craziness does not have to<br/>
heredity!<br/>
