I must say that I agree with you from my experience. Perhaps it <br/>
would have been different if I had gone to a less expensive school <br/>
or actually been encouraged to try lots of different classes &quot;on for <br/>
size&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I went to CWRU, an expensive private school that ran about $22,000 a <br/>
year. When I chose the school, many things factored in, including <br/>
majors offered, college size, etc., but mostly I went because it was <br/>
close, my brother was already there, and I did not know I had other <br/>
options. I enrolled having earned many scholarships based on my high <br/>
school record and test scores. <br/>
<br/>
UNfortunately, you need to keep a certain GPA to maintain <br/>
scholarships. This made me too afraid to take some of the classes I <br/>
would have found interesting and led me to seek out any class I <br/>
thought would be &quot;easy&quot; enough to get an &quot;A&quot; to balance out <br/>
any &quot;B&quot;&#39;s to keep my scholarship. (3.6 GPA required to keep the <br/>
money)I wound up having the largest scholarsip amount lowered after <br/>
the second year when my GPA fell to a 3.4 and lost a science <br/>
scholarship completely when the government cut the funding. I piled <br/>
on the classes and earned the BS in 3 years so I could get out <br/>
before having to pay tuition for the next year. This schedule cut <br/>
out any chance of exploring classes. <br/>
<br/>
I would recommend very seriously looking at less expensive college <br/>
choices and trying classes a few at a time (or even 1 at a time) <br/>
before putting up the money for a degree program.<br/>
<br/>
I would also be wary of scholarship benefits that are not promised <br/>
for the duration of the program or have standards set very high.<br/>
This really makes it hard to enjoy the work.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I LOVED college, but it was NOT for the classes. <br/>
It was all about the relationships I made while there.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, as far as that which is included in the college<br/>
system and the career choices it supports. My current<br/>
work is in a field that I didn&#39;t even know existed in<br/>
college. And the vast majority of my interests<br/>
(including academic ones) were not found through<br/>
attending college. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or maybe a different type of school. My first college experience was <br/>
at Antioch, a 4 yr liberal arts college in Yellow Springs Ohio. The <br/>
basis of their &quot;program&quot; is the co-op, and students spend half of <br/>
their college experience in far-flung locations ranging from organic <br/>
farms and animal sactuaries, to democratic elementary schools, to <br/>
researching endangered species in the rainforest. Unfortunately i got <br/>
too homesick to even be away at college, so i dropped out before <br/>
going on co-op. Yes, its an extremely expensive school, but i got <br/>
lots of financial aid when i went there, the bulk of which was just <br/>
&quot;forgiven&quot; tuition (not a scholarship in which i would have to <br/>
maintain a certain GPA or take specific classes.) My family was <br/>
pretty solidly middle class and i know that kids in &quot;poorer&quot; families <br/>
got more financial aid. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the important thing is to find a college that is the right <br/>
fit for what you are looking for. And &quot;going to college&quot; doesnt have <br/>
to mean packing all your stuff, moving halfway across the country, <br/>
and signing on for the 4 yr degree program. Going to college can mean <br/>
taking a class or two in the evening at the local community college, <br/>
or even the local university. (I know this depends on where you live. <br/>
Where i live in Michigan there are tons of 4 yr universities within <br/>
commuting distance.) That&#39;s why i suggested the teenager look over <br/>
some college classes and see what sparks her interest. One of the <br/>
best college classes i ever took was one called Evolution and <br/>
Behavior, and was about how animals&#39; genes influence their behavior <br/>
(including humans). It was at the local CC, and the professor LOVED <br/>
his subject. I mean he was obsessed with it, and you couldnt help but <br/>
love it along with him. I would never have thought that psychobiology <br/>
was a field i&#39;d get into until this class. <br/>
<br/>
One thing i wasnt prepared for when i went back to school (community <br/>
college)as an adult, was how distracting and immature alot of the <br/>
other students were, who had come straight from high school and didnt <br/>
seem to want to be there.  I found that evening or saturday classes, <br/>
in which there were more working adults who were trying to balance a <br/>
job and/or family obligations, and who really wanted to *be* there, <br/>
were more satisfying to me at the time. Just a caution for an <br/>
unschooled teenager who might not be so accustomed to being <br/>
surrounding by others for whom &quot;compulsory education&quot; extends into <br/>
college due to pressures from family/society. <br/>
