<div id="ygrps-yiv-490732391">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;She likes math, but has little desire to sit down and do<br/>
worksheets.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	Sounds just like my dd. She will do real life math almost always. At the<br/>
grocery store, I ask her, &quot;This item is $1.99, and I have a coupon for<br/>
$.35, which the store will double. What will be the final price I pay?&quot;<br/>
(Soon, I&#39;ll start asking her to figure the tax, too.) At the printer, &quot;I<br/>
made 27 copies, at $.05 each. What do we pay?&quot; I tell her to write it on<br/>
the form, too. <br/>
	Fractions, we do by doubling the muffin recipe, divvying up the pizza,<br/>
etc.<br/>
	We also began going to a &quot;Fun With Real Math&quot; club, which uses a lot of<br/>
material from &quot;Family Math.&quot; She is enjoying it very much.<br/>
