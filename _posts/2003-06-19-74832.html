<div id="ygrps-yiv-279210463">&lt; Just wondering, if anyone on the list HAS any natural remedies or ideas <br/>
&lt;for <br/>
&lt;helping with &quot;lows&quot; in life.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Exercise!  I find when I exercise regularly I have fewer lows, especially premenstrually.  It also helps reduce the severity and frequency of my migraines.  If I am having a particularly bad day, and can force myself to go for a long walk or lift some weights it lifts my mood.  I know it sounds too simple but it really works. <br/>
<br/>
Also re: defooding.  I am in the process of losing weight.  (we&#39;re talking 20lbs down 60 to go).  What really helped me was eating more often.  I eat healthy snacks (small piece of fruit,1 oz. of cheese 4 almonds - or a fruit bottom yogurt - or a zone bar)  twice a day (between meals) so I&#39;m generally not really hungry at meal times.  This helps me reduce portions at meals.  Since I started eating healthy snacks I&#39;ve reduced my cravings for unhealthy snacks(chips, cookies, popcorn).  We&#39;re not talking overnight here but over time it&#39;s working.  Also I try to take note of why I&#39;m craving unhealthy food.  If I&#39;m actually hungry - I&#39;ll go eat something healthy.  If I&#39;m just bored I&#39;ll change my activity, this usually means I&#39;ll turn off the TV and go do something.  I&#39;ve figured out lately that TV is often boring and therefore my mind/body demands something &quot;more&quot; to entertain it - food is a quick and easily available fix.  Better to change your activity than to add food just to &quot;spice up&quot; a boring activity. Oh and back to the mood thing - if I eat too many carbs. I get those sugar highs and lows which can make me tired and moody.  Reducing caffeine intake also helps my mood.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554260039">Exercise got me out of the depression I suffered from for about 6  <br/>
months. I go to Curves - almost every day - and really love it. I feel  <br/>
a thousand times better and have way more energy - physical and mental.<br/>
