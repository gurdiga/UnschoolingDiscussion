<div id="ygrps-yiv-509350376">The kidlets made one a few years back.  They bought a piece of pvc pipe<br/>
(18&quot;) and found the middle.  Dad drilled a hole through it and they put a<br/>
dole through that which they set on some books.  They drilled two pie tins<br/>
(old fashioned metal ones that they found at Goodwill) and they had the<br/>
butcher weight them and the bolts they fixed them on with (o.k., so middle<br/>
child is perfectionist &lt;g&gt;) until they found a match for as close to exact<br/>
weight as they could find.  They then used pennies for their counter<br/>
balance.  I don&#39;t remember what the number is (but I&#39;ll bet someone on the<br/>
list does) but I think it is about 3 or 4 pennies is an ounce.<br/>
<br/>
The also made a hanging one using the same method.<br/>

&gt; Hi all!  Anyone out there with any ideas or instructions for making your<br/>
&gt; own balancing scale?  We&#39;re about to delve into the Guinness Book of<br/>
&gt; World Records for awhile and it has set off an interest in measuring<br/>
&gt; around here.  We thought it would be fun to compare weights and volumes<br/>
&gt; until we checked into how much a brand new balance and weights costs! <br/>
&gt; WHEW!!  So any and all ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
