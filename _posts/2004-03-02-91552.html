&lt;&lt; Anyways, I&#39;m just looking for encouragement <br/>
<br/>
as I roll back into getting our life in order. I&#39;ve always been VERY <br/>

eclectic in my style of homeschooling, but I&#39;m really trying to just <br/>
<br/>
let my kids be kids.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;We&#39;ve since moved and school has been totally on hold. No plans, no <br/>
schedule, NADA...just unpacking boxes and organizing. I&#39;m learning <br/>
to lighten up a little (ok a TON) now that I&#39;m parenting 100% on my <br/>
own.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I went through a situation very much like yours...where I went to being a <br/>
single parent of 5 almost over night.  I also had been an eclectic/relaxed <br/>
homeschooler and found myself heading to unschooling after the separation from my <br/>
exhusband.  It was definitely the right path for us!  I let go of controlling my <br/>
children (not only academics, but chores, food, bedtimes, and media use), and <br/>
it has led to a dramatic improvement in our family life and my stress levels <br/>
&lt;g&gt;.  It has been nearly 5 yrs. now, and although it&#39;s not always easy for us, <br/>
unschooling was definitely the way to go!  We are now five wonderful <br/>
individuals who live together helping and supporting each other in a mutually <br/>
respectful manner instead of me being the boss who has to control and train the rest <br/>
who, of course, would resent it.  Good luck to you on your journey!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am not a single parent, but know one......I believe she manages it with <br/>
creativity, finesse, a flexible work schedule, and a helping grandparent.  And I <br/>
think all three of them (mom, 9 year old daughter, grandmother) are <br/>
*extremely* fortunate.  I am not sure I could manage it, and I have great respect for <br/>
those who attempt it.  Oh, and the single parent I know began college classes <br/>
this winter to get a better job.<br/>

I&#39;m a single mother, but I do receive child support from my exhusband.  It&#39;s <br/>
not a lot, but by living extremely frugally and living in low-income housing, <br/>
we can make ends meet &lt;g&gt;.  I also earn a bit of extra money taking care of 2 <br/>
girls before school in the morning and putting them on their school bus.  In <br/>
the past, I&#39;ve done tutoring, and I worked for the Census Bureau for 6 wks. <br/>
back in 2000 which gave me some savings for emergencies.  My oldest daughter and <br/>
a couple of friends took care of my children while I was working.<br/>

<br/>
I was wondering this same thing myself.  It&#39;s really interesting to <br/>
hear the different ways in which single parents are able to unschool <br/>
their kids.  I guess it goes to show that, with a little creativity <br/>
and hard work (and sometimes help from family members), you really <br/>
can do anything you put your mind to.  :)<br/>

&gt; stupid question - how do single mothers (sole earners for the family)<br/>
&gt; manage to keep their kids out of school?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Remember, especially on a discussion like this, no question is stupid :o) <br/>
If you don&#39;t ask, how are you going to learn hehehehehehe<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am a single parent of one child and if my son was anything like<br/>
most of his friends, I would not be able to do it.  My son is VERY<br/>
trustworthy and I can leave him home and know that the house will still be<br/>
standing when I get back.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Granted, you do not have as much time as a 2 parent family but we do it. <br/>
You just learn to take advantage of special moments more.  <br/>
<br/>
I refuse to send my child back to school...My son got really hurt by people<br/>
that were supposed to be his teachers.  He has learned more about living<br/>
and caring since being home.  He knows now that learning can be fun...his<br/>
self esteem is back and he enjoys life again...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a single mom of a 7 yo boy. I quit my job, and moved closer to <br/>
family primarily so i could HS, and also to help my sister with my <br/>
disabled mother. We are fortunate enough that my mother can afford to <br/>
pay for caregivers, and that she is willing to pay *us* (my sister <br/>
and me)to do the job. This week was my first week, it was actually <br/>
pretty nice being there with my mom after four years living in <br/>
another state. My son and I share a 2 bd apartment with my brother, <br/>
which means my expenses are fairly low, but we don&#39;t have alot of <br/>
space. For the past two years we&#39;ve had a terrific woman come from <br/>
Lithiunia from Sept until March to take care of my mom (she&#39;s <br/>
become like extended family now), if we invite her back in sept. i <br/>
won&#39;t have a job so will have to come up with other plans until the <br/>
following March. <br/>
<br/>
If my son&#39;s father wouldve just agreed to work evenings (like he had <br/>
the entire time i&#39;d known him, up until it was actually beneficial <br/>
for him to!grrrrr...)i couldve kept my job in Ohio, and we couldve <br/>
swung HSing there. But our lives here are much better, so much more <br/>
free time, more relaxed, not so many bills to fret over. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say the number one benefit to being a single mom HS&#39;er is that i <br/>
don&#39;t have to convince a dh that unschooling is the best way, or deal <br/>
with any of the husband issues i often read about (&quot;my dh thinks we <br/>
arent doing enough school&quot; or &quot;my dh keeps quizzing the kids!&quot;)...and <br/>
luckily since my son&#39;s father and i are so far on terrific terms i <br/>
havent had to worry about him dragging me into court to challenge <br/>
HSing. I wouldnt mind having a husband around to support me (both <br/>
emotionally AND financially), and be able to have a bunch more kids <br/>
though! <br/>
