<div id="ygrps-yiv-281050619">We too, have chickens just for fun.  I don&#39;t think I could kill them.  I<br/>
have thought about maybe raising some broilers because it would be nice<br/>
to have home raised chicken.  But, I&#39;m not sure I could do it.  We<br/>
probably will try though.<br/>
Yes, it is nice to have fresh eggs all the time, but they aren&#39;t free.<br/>
lol  If you only knew what we have spent in fencing, time energy and<br/>
food for our chickens.  lol.  I do like them to have a nice life<br/>
though.  I can&#39;t help it.  I feel responsible for them.<br/>
Just my thoughts on my chickens.<br/>

That&#39;s where we usually got out chickens.  Even if you can&#39;t raise chickens where you live, the catalogue is really beautiful and worth getting.<br/>

I have ordered chicks from them several times. There are two or three <br/>
other hatcheries but they don&#39;t have the selection Murry does.</div>
