 </span></blockquote>Hi Jackie,<br/>
I&#39;m on the wrong side of Canada to help you up close, but if you want to <br/>
meet some local people here are some suggestions.<br/>
The main Canadian homeschooling list is hs-ca.  You can join it by sending <br/>
a message to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hs-ca-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">hs-ca-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>  We tend to be more &quot;off <br/>
topic&quot; than &quot;on&quot;, but it&#39;s a good group.  If you post a message looking for <br/>
local people, you&#39;ll probably get at least some answers.  I&#39;m not sure just <br/>
where Richmond Hill is, so I can&#39;t point you directly at nearby <br/>
people.  There&#39;s also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling_Canada-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling_Canada-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>  That&#39;s <br/>
a group of just unschoolers that isn&#39;t very high traffic.<br/>
You should also explore www.flora.org/homeschool-ca/  Check out the Ontario <br/>
section, and definitely get in touch with the OFTP.<br/>
I know of a woman in Port Colburne (I think that&#39;s it - near Niagra Falls) <br/>
who has weathered some big problems with Children&#39;s Aid over <br/>
homeschooling.  She&#39;s not on the list right now, but if you want, I could <br/>
ask her about sending you her addy.  I think she may have started a group <br/>
for people having Children&#39;s Aid problems over homeschooling.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725160698">Hello Jackie,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in the east end of Toronto.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a Toronto list at  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Torhschool/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Torhschool/</a><br/>
and I know that at some informal get togethers we&#39;ve run into folks <br/>
from Richmond Hill. There are a few unschoolers out here.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a group at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hs-ontrips/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hs-ontrips/</a><br/>
This list is for posting trip and outings in Ontario and there&#39;s<br/>
often <br/>
information about events around Toronto.<br/>
<br/>
As Tia suggested, you might consider OFTP.  The website is at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ontariohomeschool.org/">http://www.ontariohomeschool.org/</a><br/>
There are no support groups listed in Richmond Hill, but if you call <br/>
the OFTP Hotline, at 416-410-5218, this month&#39;s volunteer may be able <br/>
to rustle up a few nearby members.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Thank you I didn&#39;t think of the different subjects that it could be I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820304909">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in the group for about a month now and I really think you are a <br/>
great bunch of people! I just wanted to thank everybody who have shared their <br/>
lives with us. It helps so much to read what everybody else is/has gone <br/>
through. I get so many great ideas from all of you! Now for the introduction. <br/>
My name is Lori and we live in Michigan. We&#39;ve got two wonderful boys, <br/>
Christopher (7) & Colt (2). They are the joy of our lives! Christopher <br/>
actually went to school until the 2nd grade and it was a nightmare. We had <br/>
sent him to a private kindergarten that my friend was the teacher in. I felt <br/>
really better about it because she was there to watch over him. Kindergarten <br/>
went great for him. He really enjoyed it and did so well they thought he <br/>
should be tested for the GT program ( Gifted & Talented). Of course at the <br/>
time I thought this has great. To me GT meant having the time and space to <br/>
learn at their own pace and more of an artistic attitude. Boy was I wrong! He <br/>
got excepted and then the nightmare began. They had so much paper work to do <br/>
and sitting quite it was terrible. Of course Christopher was having trouble <br/>
sitting and doing page after page of problems. How can they except a 5 year <br/>
old to just sit all day? Anyway, this went on for a while. The teacher was <br/>
the worst. Each day I would take Chris to class and help him get ready for <br/>
the day by taking him in the classroom and getting him settled. After a while <br/>
he started crying about having to stay and it broke my heart. This teacher <br/>
had the gall to tell me that I shouldn&#39;t come in and help him settle in <br/>
(helping him change from boot&#39;s to shoes and hanging the back pack up, things <br/>
like that). I should just drop him at the door and if he started to cry to <br/>
just leave him and SHE&#39;D take care of him! NO WAY! That was the end of that <br/>
class! We took him out and they put him and regular 1st grade. Now that half <br/>
to the year he really enjoyed. The teacher he had was wonderful! He never had <br/>
any problems with her. She didn&#39;t believe in homework and the kids could sit <br/>
where they wanted. A very relaxed place. But then 2nd grade came along. <br/>
Another nightmare teacher. They had just started school and on the SECOND day <br/>
she sends home a note and Chris was having trouble sitting in class. We had <br/>
to sign the slip and take it back in. My husband did it that day and when he <br/>
talked to her she said we might have to think about a &quot;behavior program&quot; for <br/>
him. When my husband told me that I was furious! This is only the SECOND day <br/>
of school and she hasn&#39;t even gotten to know Chris yet. He was all excited <br/>
about seeing the kids and talking. She couldn&#39;t cut the kids and slack for it <br/>
being the start of school and their being excited about everything. That was <br/>
the last straw. I had been reading about homeschooling since he was in the <br/>
1st grade. It was something I really wanted to do for him. My husband wasn&#39;t <br/>
connived at that time but after the 2nd grade teacher he was totally on <br/>
board. So long story short(even thought this letter ended up being long) we <br/>
pulled him out and he&#39;s been home ever since and it&#39;s been wonderful. We can <br/>
see the joy coming back into his eye&#39;s and he went from having stomachaches <br/>
and a mouth on him to being our happy little boy again! The first year we did <br/>
worksheets and such but by this year we went unschooling and it&#39;s been the <br/>
best thing we did. Doing a lot of field trip and what ever else he wants to <br/>
do. <br/>
I guess this went on longer then I thought. I can see why other post end up <br/>
so long. You start typing and before you know it all kinds of stuff flows <br/>
out. I&#39;ve just really enjoyed all the post and the information this group has <br/>
to offer. Thanks for sharing!<br/>
