<br/>
Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice is for you to go to www.unschooling.com and read in the <br/>
library (there are some essays and article easy to get to), and then to the <br/>
message boards and read anything that strikes your fancy.  There are lots of <br/>
ideas there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just unit studies, although any interest will lead to more of the <br/>
same until the mood passes.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew at nine what I wanted to do when I grew up and I did it (for a while <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), but if &quot;vet&quot; is going to be the only right answer, then anything else <br/>
she might want to do is going to seem like failure.  Maybe not pushing so <br/>
hard in that direction would be helpful for all.  I wish I had had more <br/>
suggestions made, or more avenues encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
 I heard about a kid once who was going to be an Olympic swimmer.  That was <br/>
it.  Nothing else to the left or the right.  And his schedules and goals were <br/>
all out on the wall in his bedroom.  Anything not leading to that one goal <br/>
was a wasteful wrong thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I never heard if he made it or not, but what are the odds?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710072568">Hi Vicki!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list!<br/>
I&#39;m curious what made you consider unschooling?<br/>
What did you read or hear about it that appeals to you?<br/>
<br/>
From what you described, it sounds like you could easily switch to<br/>
unschooling, but that all depends on your mindset.<br/>
Unschooling is mostly doing what you are already doing (with the beach &<br/>
library trips, raising and breeding animals, etc.) minus the book work. We<br/>
used to do math, grammar, spelling, etc. out of books when we were<br/>
homeschooling, but since unschooling, we have totally stopped.<br/>
<br/>
A typical day looks different in individual families.<br/>
It would also look different from day to day, IMO.<br/>
Some of our days are spent &quot;in&quot; and would be considered lazy, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
Those days involve playing computer games and gameboys, watching TV, playing<br/>
board games, playing outside, watching movies and not doing much<br/>
&quot;productive&quot;.<br/>
Other days we are incredibly busy with seemingly non-stop activities from<br/>
morning &#39;till night, usually away from home.<br/>
We value both kinds of days and know that it all counts. My boys (9 & 11)<br/>
ask questions about this or that every single day - I know they&#39;re learning<br/>
even if it&#39;s not book work or documented on paper or graded on.<br/>
<br/>
When I discovered unschooling, it sounded so appealing, especially since we<br/>
were all frustrated with homeschooling for the past 5 years. Even though I<br/>
wanted to unschool and started pretty soon after I learned about it, I still<br/>
had much learning or UNlearning to do about true learning and how it<br/>
happens. I read and read at unschooling.com and soaked it all up like a<br/>
sponge. The most important message I received was that to unschool, I needed<br/>
to put my full TRUST in my kids. That was a little foreign to me, but I<br/>
gradually let go of the reigns more and more, and I&#39;ve been so pleasantly<br/>
surprised by my boys and how they&#39;ve handled their new-found freedom. We are<br/>
all so much happier since unschooling, including my husband. I can now say<br/>
that even he recognizes the benefits of unschooling, at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading, learning and asking and maybe you&#39;ll discover the joys of<br/>
unschooling, too. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216483582">&lt;&lt;raising bunnies....to learn about running a small business&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the biggest difference between unschooling and what you<br/>
are doing now isn&#39;t WHAT you are doing so much but rather WHY you are doing<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane (11) raises bunnies and goats.  Not because she wants to be a vet<br/>
(although I wouldn&#39;t be surprised) or to learn anything in particular.  She<br/>
raises them because she loves it.  She does it simply for the pure joy.<br/>
<br/>
Now she has learned many things along the way.  She can discuss reproduction<br/>
with a pro... she medicates her animals, raises them holistically, deals<br/>
independently with the vet...she keeps records of milk production and<br/>
sales...uses profits to buy her own clothes and open a savings<br/>
account...etc..<br/>
<br/>
But none of that was the point.  Fun and enjoyment were and are the point.<br/>
Learning is just icing on the cake.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417727399">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We had an experience yesterday that somewhat affirmed for me how well <br/>
the approach of unschooling is  working (we have only very recently <br/>
given up the workbooks.)  The girls are in a homeschool phys ed class at <br/>
the YMCA -- their choice, btw.  The teacher, who is wonderful, but after <br/>
thirty years in the public school system, he still doesn&#39;t entirely <br/>
&quot;get&quot; homeschooling. So he gives them a quiz on tennis. The last <br/>
question is worded &quot;tennis courts are made of all of the following <br/>
except: a. grass, b. clay, c. asphalt, d. mud&quot;  My 8 yo dd and one boy <br/>
in the class thought that mud was an acceptable way to make a tennis <br/>
court. The teacher was appalled at this -- he was very much in the <br/>
right/wrong, no discussion mindset. Both dd and the boy reasoned that <br/>
since you can make houses (adobe) out of mud, and it hardens, this would <br/>
also be a good surface for making a tennis court. Seemed like good <br/>
reasoning to me. The teacher was somewhat exasperated ( not angry, just <br/>
that he didn&#39;t quite know how to respond to kids who reason like this.)  <br/>
Three things came out of this at home. First, I have a background in <br/>
statistics and test making, so we discussed the proper wording of <br/>
questions (note the question does not say &quot;regulation tennis courts&quot;) <br/>
and how a good test is made, items evaluated to see if they actually ask <br/>
what they&#39;re supposed to and so on. Secondly, she had never received a <br/>
grade before. This led to a discussion on fractions (she loves math) and <br/>
how a grade is simply a fraction, converted to a decimal and then to a <br/>
percent, which is then placed on a scale with letters. She found that <br/>
interesting. Next, we are going to go searching on the internet to see <br/>
if anyone has in fact ever made a tennis court out of mud.<br/>
<br/>
And all of this out of getting the &quot;wrong&quot; answer on a test. :-)<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t ya just love unschooling. ;-)<br/>

we found it -- an old british sports club in India, named Kodaikanal <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463047504">well, yes, but that was on the quiz as a choice.. a poorly thought out <br/>
question. We wanted to find an example of just plain old mud, besides <br/>
clay.<br/>
<br/>
the moral is, for the teacher, trying to get a group of homeschoolers <br/>
too accept an answer because &quot;I, the Teacher, say so&quot; just won&#39;t work.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you do units?or just check out<br/>
&gt; books on what they like & read,read,read to them/with them ect....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t quite so formal or so goal directed. Unschooling isn&#39;t about<br/>
raising their competence to a satisfactory level but helping them acheive<br/>
whatever level they feel necessary. The motives behind helping them are more<br/>
akin to the motives behind helping your husband with his hobby. You might<br/>
notice a book or a movie or an event and point it out. With kids you need to<br/>
do more since they can&#39;t access the world as easily as adults but the<br/>
connection between adult and child in terms of their interests is similar.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My 9 year old is college bound as she wants to be a vet how will<br/>
&gt; unschooling effect her chances?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As someone suggested if you focus on that as a goal, she will have devoted<br/>
so much of her young life to it that she won&#39;t be able to change her mind if<br/>
she loses interest. She has loads of time and she has loads of animal<br/>
related opportunities to explore.<br/>
<br/>
On another list, vets came up recently and one ex-vet said that her motive<br/>
for being a vet was love of animals. But being a vet is very little about<br/>
being with cute and cuddly animals. To be a vet the first love should really<br/>
be the science and medical side, investigating disease and dealing with pet<br/>
owners. If someone loves animals there are loads of careers that will bring<br/>
them incontact with healthy happy animals like zoo worker, groomer, dog<br/>
trainer, breeder, pet shop owner, naturalist, even Jane Goodall&#39;s successor<br/>
:-) So she should be exploring all sorts of animal related opportunities,<br/>
whatever interests her, regardless of whether it lies on the path to<br/>
vethood.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is a typical day?We start out with household chores,animal<br/>
&gt; chores,then bible usually prayer & a reading from our family<br/>
&gt; bible,then math,we do units for history&science usually hands on<br/>
&gt; stuff.We do our language with our journals & spelling from misspelled<br/>
&gt; words.We do weekly/daily trips to our local beach&libary.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A typical day is like most people&#39;s typical weekend or summer days. I tend<br/>
to need force myself into doing things and steering things into our lives<br/>
than just living life would do because I tend to be, uh, low energy ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All my guys are animal buffs so we are about to start breeding<br/>
&gt; bunnies next year.Also hopefully chicks.The children will learn all<br/>
&gt; about raising them & will be selling them as a unit on running a<br/>
&gt; business.Would it be hard for me to  switch to unschooling????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it would depend what you want from unschooling. If you want<br/>
academics with less work, you&#39;re going to be disappointed. If you want them<br/>
to explore what interests them to discover more about who they are, then it<br/>
will work fine. :-)<br/>
