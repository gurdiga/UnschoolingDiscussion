On another list, an adpotive mother in Panama found that the legalitites of<br/>
the adoptions meant that the daughters couldn&#39;t get visas when the family<br/>
were due to return to the US.  After a very lengthy letter-writing campaign,<br/>
she got the visas and is now living in Arizona, looking forward to the<br/>
girls&#39; first Christmas with grandparents.  Perhaps similar techniques will<br/>
have an effect for your nephew, and make folk have a long hard look at the<br/>
system over there.  I guess I&#39;ll have to go ask her what she did, or can I<br/>
give her your email addy and she can tell you what she did!  Anyone in<br/>
Arizona who&#39;s watched Good Morning Arizona may know what and who I&#39;m talking<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you want her to get in touch.<br/>

    That sounds interesting.  Things are looking a little better but I still <br/>
feel that the things going on in that area are out of hand.  I would like to <br/>
find out more about what the mom with the adopted daughters.  Thanks...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443726999">Debbie is the one with the adopted daughters from Panama. She is on another <br/>
Onelist list with me. I know that she went thru all kinds of heck to get <br/>
those girls here (to the states). they are a great family and looking into a <br/>
pot bellied pig right now. She is a homeschooler, too. I can get you a <br/>
synopsis of what happened if you want....<br/>

May the love of God surround you this season!<br/>
