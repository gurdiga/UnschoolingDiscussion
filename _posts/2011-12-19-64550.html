A week or so back, someone left this discussion in a defensive huff, assuring me on the way out that I clearly knew NOTHING about Buddhism.   Buddhism isn&#39;t going to be on the test.  It&#39;s trivia.  What I know is that being where you are, in a mindful way, with the potential and the tools to be still and know it, is the portal to a better life.  Call it what you want to, finding yourself with your children will put you in a good place. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389372522">I have seen many religious seekers over the years in my life.  It seems<br/>
that sometimes when a person finds what he/she believes will provide &quot;The<br/>
Answer&quot; or &quot;Inner Peace&quot; or whatever it is that she thinks she will find<br/>
when a religious or spiritual path is right for her/him, then they often<br/>
want rules and scripts for how they should &quot;Be&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Oftentimes a new convert will work really hard to follow all of the rules<br/>
to prove to themselves, and maybe others as well, that they really are on<br/>
the right path and have found the right answer.... to whatever the<br/>
questions might be, even if they aren&#39;t really sure of the question.  When<br/>
someone seems to question their choices or to just point out that there are<br/>
other possible choices, this new believer often becomes angry and<br/>
defensive.<br/>
<br/>
I think that in an unschooling context, one of things that I learned<br/>
slowly, sometimes painfully slowly, is to be comfortable with a lack of<br/>
&quot;Knowing&quot; and rather to work cultivating my faith and trust in the<br/>
indomitable will of my children to explore and learn and grow (in all<br/>
senses of the word), sometimes in spite of myself and my fears.  As an<br/>
unschooler, I learned to be comfortable with the fact that I may not have a<br/>
lot of answers when I want them.  I learned to ask different questions,<br/>
such as:<br/>
Are my children happy?<br/>
Are the individuals in our family connected and engaged with each other,<br/>
with the world?<br/>
Do my children still have that innate curiosity that drove them to pull<br/>
themselves up off of the floor and walk so that they could climb up on the<br/>
chair and see what was in the top of the cabinet in the kitchen?<br/>
How can I help maintain that curiosity and cultivate it in myself?<br/>
When I sit back and look at where we have been and where we are, do my<br/>
children have a wealth of experiences that add up to a knowledge of<br/>
themselves and the world around them?<br/>
<br/>
Do my children feel that they are capable of anything that they put their<br/>
mind to?<br/>
When my daughter wanted to make a vegetarian bacon substitute she looked up<br/>
some things on the internet and proceeded to practice alchemy in my<br/>
kitchen.  She then took some tofu out of the fridge and marinated it in her<br/>
concoction.  The next morning, she cooked it and it actually tasted like<br/>
bacon!  The best part is that she has never eaten real bacon, but still<br/>
managed to make tofu taste like bacon!!!  Oh, she also wrote down her<br/>
recipe so that she could repeat her success, and we have done so several<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
I find it hard to remember when she couldn&#39;t write, it was something that<br/>
she took to, we always had pens, pencils, crayons, paints, markers and lots<br/>
of paper around and I had some &#39;copy books&#39; laying around (something that I<br/>
bought before I had a better clue).  One day, I saw her playing and writing<br/>
in the copy books.  I watched with fascination because she was actually<br/>
tracing the letters. I thought that she would be drawing in the pages<br/>
(equally as good) like she had in the past with coloring books, but this<br/>
time she was tracing letters.  She asked what the letters were and I<br/>
recited for her what they were.  I think that she was three.  I have<br/>
spelled hundreds of words for her and was a little sad once she learned how<br/>
to use spell check.  I have always spelled words for my children without<br/>
trying to make them &#39;sound it out&#39;.  I have explained why the words are<br/>
spelled the way they are, when I knew the information.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the other question that I asked often, once I realized how<br/>
important a question it was, is, &quot;Am I being helpful and facilitative of my<br/>
children&#39;s learning and not an obstacle with what I think are good ideas?&quot;<br/>
I am still de-schooling and I have been doing this for 10 years.  It has<br/>
gotten easier, but I am stubborn and perhaps think a little too much of my<br/>
own ideas.  Now though, my kids tell me when I am being too schoolish,<br/>
usually with a look like I have hit my head a little too hard.  :)  Though<br/>
sometimes, my ideas are good ones and we go off on an adventure that I<br/>
actually dreamed up, usually this is a trip to some nifty place that we all<br/>
find interesting or some cooking project.  I am happy that my children feel<br/>
that they are free to express their opinions to me about my ideas.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was not reading by himself at the age of ten, I took a lot of<br/>
deep breaths and read other people&#39;s stories about their sons and daughters<br/>
and how one day they just started reading; all without pain and bad<br/>
feelings because they were &#39;late&#39; to read.  And one day, my son did read<br/>
and now he reads everything he wants to and then often he will tell me all<br/>
about some subject that I would have never read about myself, and I feel<br/>
enriched and blessed.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, the upshot is that having faith in my children&#39;s drive and desire<br/>
to learn and re-kindling my own love of learning and interest in things has<br/>
been a work in progress.  Realizing that learning is process and not<br/>
product (or papers or dioramas or some other schoolish thing) came to me<br/>
one day when I was discussing my own school experience with a friend.  She<br/>
was going on about &#39;demonstration of skills and knowledge&#39; and the<br/>
importance of homework.  I realized that one the things that made me hate<br/>
most of my school days was this inane &#39;demonstration&#39; business and the busy<br/>
work.  I loved learning about things and I loved creating real<br/>
things--clothes, crochet projects, dances, singing in chorus, performing in<br/>
plays, fixing a flat tire, things that were real in the world and useful or<br/>
somehow brought joy (or maybe some relief in the case of the flat tire),<br/>
not some stupid canned &#39;lesson&#39; that had some pre-determined product in<br/>
mind, or just discussing what I had learned and how it fit with other<br/>
things that I already knew or how it challenged what I thought that I<br/>
knew.<br/>
<br/>
Homework made me hate math until I was in college.  Hundreds of problems to<br/>
complete, even after I got the concept and was able to do whatever<br/>
operation that we were studying, all just to be able to show that we were<br/>
&#39;productive&#39;....<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids are learning algebra, because they find it interesting.  I<br/>
bought some curriculum and books about algebra and manipulatives and<br/>
calculators and they are there when they are interested.  I am here to<br/>
answer questions or discuss things as they wish to engage.  We have gone<br/>
through curriculum a couple of days in a row and then haven&#39;t touched it<br/>
for weeks and then one of the kids says &#39;lets do some math&#39; and we get the<br/>
books out and read and &#39;do math&#39;.  The funny thing is that they always seem<br/>
to remember the concepts and how to do whatever we learned the last time<br/>
and pick up where we left off.<br/>
<br/>
A friend who is a teacher in public schools insists that my children can&#39;t<br/>
actually be remembering the concepts and operations weeks later.  I<br/>
explained that they remember because they have actually learned because we<br/>
study the stuff as long as they want and discuss and pull apart each<br/>
concept until we are satisfied that we know as much as we want to know<br/>
before we move on (I say &#39;we&#39; because I really am learning this stuff all<br/>
over again).  I used the term &quot;Socratic method&quot; to try to explain what we<br/>
do when we &#39;do math&#39;.  She insisted that the Socratic method could only<br/>
apply to philosophy.... I smiled and told her that we must do something<br/>
different then and we all were happy with our learning, so it really didn&#39;t<br/>
matter what it was called.  I didn&#39;t even bother to tell her that we only<br/>
did a few of the problems from each unit, if we do any for a particular<br/>
lesson from the books that we use.  I didn&#39;t want to shake her view of<br/>
reality too badly, mostly because I no longer have a desire to prove that I<br/>
am providing my children with a good education and because she didn&#39;t seem<br/>
ready to hear that there are other options out there.<br/>

I don&#39;t think having copy books or workbooks around is a clueless thing, as long as the mom isn&#39;t looking at what&#39;s been done in the book instead of looking at her child.  And clearly, from your REALLY great list of questions, you were looking at your child!<br/>

OH!<br/>
From the beginning of your post I was thinking about philosophy.  People &quot;study philosophy&quot; or &quot;read philosophy&quot; without ever gaining the least benefit from it.  All the time I see people &quot;studying philosophy&quot; or talking about it, and not applying one iota of an idea to their own decisionmaking real lives.<br/>
<br/>
I bet your kids are learning to ask their own questions, gradually but solidly, in ways they won&#39;t forget, about whether they&#39;re learning, and how, and what.<br/>
<br/>
School operates on the idea that kids forget what they&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; each summer vacation, and winter break.  Partly it&#39;s because the kids weren&#39;t learning at all, and mostly because kids pretend not to know because they&#39;re prefer a repeat to new information.  The better to zone out, and the easier to get good grades.  School has taught them that it&#39;s the grades and test scores that really matter, so if the kids can do easy, reviewed things instead of new information, that&#39;s where they head.<br/>

house so that our kids could make pizza together.  My kids taught her (same<br/>
age) kids how to spread the dough and put the toppings on.  The other mom<br/>
and I just got to sit and marvel at how well kids can get along without<br/>
interference.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!! We actually enjoy math theory (hubby and I were math geeks) and I<br/>
found a curriculum that talks about how algebraic equations can be found in<br/>
real life.  My daughter (and husband) actually enjoys what I call plug and<br/>
chug math--lots of equations.  They both get some sort of satisfaction from<br/>
completing a bunch of math equations.  I think it is sort of like<br/>
meditation to them.   This is not how my son and I relate to numbers.  We<br/>
also have a bunch of books that talk about math and how it applies to life,<br/>
and art, not to mention all of the websites that show nifty math in<br/>
action.  We are very booky people that love running to the internet or<br/>
books for whatever question pops into our heads.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a computer guy for a living and almost majored in math in<br/>
college.  When I discovered math theory and geometry, I discovered that I<br/>
am actually very good at thinking mathematically, but find plug numbers<br/>
into equations very tedious.  I like math that you can build with...<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t touch any kind of math curriculum until I hit a road block when<br/>
trying to answer my kid&#39;s questions about math.  We have a bunch of<br/>
textbooks (mostly college level) and some curriculum that we use as<br/>
reference material.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so true.  I only took one class in college that I would not have<br/>
taken if I weren&#39;t required to do so to complete my degree.  It was my only<br/>
&#39;c&#39; on my transcript.  I loved essay tests and discussion.  Friends of mine<br/>
took only classes that they knew they could get an &#39;a&#39; in and tried to<br/>
avoid writing any papers as well.  I had placed myself in true poverty to<br/>
pursue my college education, so I wanted to get my money&#39;s worth.  My GPA<br/>
probably suffered a bit because I didn&#39;t just take easy classes, but I<br/>
enjoyed every class I took except for that one.  :)<br/>

ask questions and we have some amazing discussions.  Anything that they<br/>
learn, they really learn and rarely forget.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This, in my opinion is one really good reason to homeschool, even if you<br/>
don&#39;t unschool.  What really flabbergasts me is when a homeschooled child<br/>
is forced to adhere to some kind of schedule and testing, instead of being<br/>
given the freedom to learn a subject (even if it is one that they are<br/>
assigned) and go through the material until they actually know it.  Why<br/>
homeschool if you aren&#39;t actually allowing your child to learn in a genuine<br/>
way?<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to say that I feel that unschooling can lead to a person who<br/>
is a better citizen because most of the unschooled kids that I have met<br/>
actually know how to absorb information and assess that information better<br/>
than many other young people their same age.  This is my opinion, but my<br/>
observations support the supposition.<br/>
