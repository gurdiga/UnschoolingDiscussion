Many Sent to Summer School in Error<br/>
<br/>

NEW YORK (AP) - As many as 3,000 public school children in New York City may<br/>
have been sent to summer school this year or held back a grade because of a<br/>
scoring error by a testing company.<br/>
<br/>
CTBMcGraw-Hill, a Monterey, Calif.-based company that has tested millions of<br/>
students across the nation in its 72 years, notified the Board of Education<br/>
about the mistake this week. Nine other school jurisdictions were affected <br/>
as<br/>
well, but the company refused to name them.<br/>
<br/>
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew called for an independent audit of the testing<br/>
company, which received more than $2 million from the school board in 1998,<br/>
and demanded company officials attend a board meeting Wednesday to explain<br/>
how the error occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Student test scores were incorrectly lowered because of a mathematical <br/>
error,<br/>
said CTBMcGraw-Hill spokesman Steven Weiss. He said scores would rise<br/>
``modestly upward&#39;&#39; with the use of new calibrations.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation did little to mollify angry school officials, parents and<br/>
student advocacy groups as the board scrambled to identify the students and<br/>
figure out the extent of the mistake.<br/>
<br/>
The tests, given last spring to 300,000 students in grades three, five, six<br/>
and seven, weighed heavily in determining that 35,000 students needed to<br/>
attend summer school.<br/>
<br/>
Crew, who spearheaded the effort to end the system&#39;s longtime practice of<br/>
promoting students with failing grades, said in August that there were<br/>
initial indications that most of the summer schoolers would pass on to the<br/>
next grade.<br/>
<br/>
But he revised that estimate this month, announcing that 60 percent of <br/>
summer<br/>
school students would have to repeat their current grade because about <br/>
14,000<br/>
students didn&#39;t show up at summer school or didn&#39;t bother to take the final<br/>
test.<br/>
<br/>
The test problem was just another example to some that the city rushed its<br/>
new no-social-promotion agenda this summer without much thought or planning.<br/>
<br/>
``It&#39;s another indication of how hurried and slapdash this whole process has<br/>
been,&#39;&#39; said Jill Chaifetz, executive director of the Brooklyn based<br/>
Advocates for Children, which sued the Board of Education on behalf of<br/>
parents whose children would be held back.<br/>
