<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141217118">For those of you who have AOL and have been having problems getting mail<br/>
from yahoogroups, this is the message that was sent to some yahoo list<br/>
owners.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>
&gt; ====<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure that you have heard by now that AOL is not sending mail that<br/>
&gt; comes from Yahoogroups.  They consider Yahoogroups mail as being spam.<br/>
&gt; Until this problem is solved, those who have AOL will not receive any<br/>
&gt; mail from Yahoogroups.  If you know anyone with an AOL address, please<br/>
&gt; tell them why they are not receiving messages from any of their Yahoo!<br/>
&gt; lists that they are on. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98761558">Thanks, Lynda!<br/>
<br/>
This is the first unschooling-dotcom group mail I&#39;ve gotten in days. I wonder <br/>
if AOL has a vanity filter that lets through messages with its name in it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758868102">I have missed it all. I haven&#39;t been getting my e-mail for a different<br/>
reason. I had a yahoo! account and didn&#39;t like the interface so I closed by<br/>
groups and haven&#39;t logged in for a while. evidently i missed one group and<br/>
it started bouncing mail. Because it was linked to my home account, it also<br/>
bounced all that mail too. I thought it was exceptionally quiet for a few<br/>
weeks, then realized I had received nothing fron unschooling dotcom. I&#39;m<br/>
glad to be back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070417511">Well, this is truly strange.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am getting some mail from some yahoogroups lists -- see, unschooling is <br/>
special!!<br/>
<br/>
I also went to the AOL help desk to see what else they could tell me.  They <br/>
said just now (Tuesday AM) that they are not blocking yahoogroups email lists <br/>
because of spam but that there is a &quot;system difficulty&quot; on AOL&#39;s side of <br/>
things due to &quot;system upgrades and maintenance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now that&#39;s what I call spam! :)<br/>
