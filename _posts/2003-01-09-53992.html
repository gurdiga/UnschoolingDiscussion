<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080116871">Joyce, <br/>
Is there a website for beginners to buddhism? Some very simple, plain spoken <br/>
books to read? We started read some books by, OMG what&#39;s that name? Thin Nuch <br/>
That or something? Being Peace and a walking meditation book. Also a coffee <br/>
table style book containing beautiful photos from Tibet and India and various <br/>
talks given by the Dalai Lama. I&#39;m looking for an overall kind of book, maybe <br/>
an idiots guide or similar.<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855875090">It is so tongue in cheek!  If the book is good, why not get it?  I get the<br/>
impression that it is a slam against the often pedantic style of writing so<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love the idea of Buddhism. But all that high order thinking keeps getting<br/>
in my way of reading about it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And the varieties (Mahayana, Therevada, Buddhist) and subvarieties (Zen)<br/>
make it a daunting task. There are Western Buddhists (which some consider<br/>
legitimately another branch of Buddhism and some don&#39;t) who have stripped<br/>
away the mystical stuff and gotten to the heart of things, from a western<br/>
point of view anyway. Like Sylvia Boorstein (I found the one book of hers<br/>
that I read very down to earth and practical) and Jon Kabat-Zinn.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had good luck with the About.com sites. If you&#39;ve never been there,<br/>
they have hundreds of subject areas, with one person being an expert on one<br/>
subject area. They are usually people with a passion for the subjects so<br/>
they do a great job combing the web for great sites. (They have pages on<br/>
Plastics, Sandra ;-) As well as Boston, Webdesign, Physics, Basenjis,<br/>
Gardening, Video games, Japanese ...)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more than one for Buddhism but the one I checked had a Beginners<br/>
Guide: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buddhism.about.com/">http://buddhism.about.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I had a website of books on religions for kids and adults at one time. It<br/>
was fun collecting, but maintaining was more than I had time for. :-/ The<br/>
design isn&#39;t anything to brag about, but the information is pretty well<br/>
organized. I think the China one links back to my defunct AOL account and a<br/>
few sites I suspect are dead by now. But the list of books should still be<br/>
useful. (They link to Amazon. I scoured Amazon for what appeared to be<br/>
highly recommended *and* easy to read.) I *think* I did a credible job of<br/>
summarizing Buddhism and the varieties on the main Buddhism page.<br/>

<br/>
(It seems to be case sensitive for some reason.)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I love the Dummies and Complete Idiot&#39;s books. Frankly I don&#39;t know how<br/>
well the stuff sticks. But I love the concept and I keep reading them.<br/>
(Though some are much better than others.) Perhaps I was lucky at never<br/>
having to take seriously anyone&#39;s thoughts that I was dumb so I see the Dumb<br/>
titles as a way of saying that they understand that I&#39;m looking for a book<br/>
that won&#39;t assume I know anything about the subject. I&#39;ve never had a book<br/>
make me feel dumb. I&#39;ve only felt the author had no clue on how to write for<br/>
complete beginners ;-)<br/>
