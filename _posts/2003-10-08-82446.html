<div id="ygrps-yiv-935442068">I am saying good-bye to this group; not because its obvious that I have a <br/>
much different opinion about the safety of my daughter (who, btw, contrary to <br/>
popular belief here is not a sheltered kid in any way shape, or form) on-line <br/>
than do most of you.  <br/>
<br/>
She comes from an EXTREMELY OPEN lesbian family who has always let her either <br/>
make her own decisions or (when younger be part of the decision making <br/>
process) concerning ALL areas of her life!  As I&#39;ve said MANY TIMES in my posts, the <br/>
decision to ask for help from the parent whose child owns that list (and, <br/>
yes, I am 100% sure of which parent that is now, and they do come from this <br/>
list), was not mine, but hers.  She was/is the one that came to me w/concerns that <br/>
this may not have been an appropriate post; she asked me to track down where I <br/>
found out about the list, and ask that parent to at least take a look into <br/>
the matter.<br/>
<br/>
But, like I said, this isn&#39;t the reason I am not feeling comfortable here; <br/>
hey--I&#39;m always up for a good debate :-).  But, there are several parenting <br/>
issues that I just can&#39;t agree w/here, that most of you seem very into that I <br/>
honestly cannot relate to.  It&#39;s not that I feel that I am right & you are wrong; <br/>
everyone can make their own decisions about how the want to raise their <br/>
families.  We just differ.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ll be moving on to a much more comfortable setting for me.  I was <br/>
hoping to get some good Unschooling ideas from here, but, for the most part, as I <br/>
said, I just can&#39;t relate to most of your experiences.  LOL, my one and only <br/>
daughter is 17, so we are well over the issues that a lot of you seem to be <br/>
dealing w/at the moment (i.e., the issues dealing w/younger kids).  <br/>
<br/>
I do want to thank you for the ideas I was able to glean from some of the <br/>
discussions.  They were very helpful.  I hope you ALL have as wonderful <br/>
experiences and successes as I have had w/my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Good Bye!<br/>

I dont recall anyone saying that the issue was with the teen telling the Mom <br/>
(you) what took place.  I dont think anyone is attacking you as a parent or <br/>
questioning your skills as a parent. <br/>
-<br/>
I dont think the topics on the this list are all geared at younger children <br/>
mostly they are general.<br/>
-<br/>
I do think that a parent to one may tend to think different from a parent of <br/>
2,3,4,5,6 children. <br/>
-<br/>
I am however wondering what parental choices that you cannot agree with?<br/>
