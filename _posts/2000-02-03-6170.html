<br/>
i&#39;m responding off list in the hopes that you will feel more inclined to be<br/>
specific without hurting anyone&#39;s feeling - personally i enjoy your &#39;blunt&#39;<br/>
approach and wish more people would cotton to that sort of style but<br/>
unfortunately people often take things personal before they think.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i&#39;m curious what in particular was it that prompted this email.  i&#39;m<br/>
not as well read as i would like to be.    i&#39;m new at this though i&#39;m 40 my<br/>
oldest is only 4.  i feel i&#39;m an unschooler by nature ( i read a few holt<br/>
books in my 20&#39;s for no reason other than i ran across them) so haven&#39;t done<br/>
much homework to know if there are strict views or guidelines as to what<br/>
constitutes an unschoolers.  i&#39;ve always done whatever it is i wanted and<br/>
never really consulted with others (much to my in laws dismay - ps teachers)<br/>
but i would value your perspective.<br/>

thanks,<br/>
