&lt;&lt; Also, there is a fairly popular philosophy that kids do better when <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; pushed to perform (think of the strict teacher or the intense <br/>
 &gt; football coach, or the passionate and demanding theater <br/>
 &gt; director).  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the thing to remember is number one, many people that are pushed have <br/>
horrible relationships with their parents. If an Olympic Gold medalist was my <br/>
priority, not a peaceful, happy relationship, then maybe that would be a good <br/>
approach.<br/>
Secondly, when the pushing is actually useful and helpful, it HAS to be <br/>
because the person being pushed wants it.<br/>
Training for triathlon means I need some pushing. But I love triathlon, I <br/>
enjoy the competition and I ask dh to &quot;push&quot; me (in the form of working out <br/>
with me, or timing my runs or encouraging me to work out more). We push each <br/>
other.<br/>
When I&#39;m timing a run for him I ride along on my bike and shout &quot;good job, <br/>
keep it going&quot; when his time is right on. If he needs to speed up I tell him. <br/>
He does the same for me and our times improve because of this &quot;pushing&quot;.<br/>
But if I pushed him when he said &quot;enough&quot;...that would be a bad thing.<br/>
Pushing can work. But it still has to be the desire of the one that is <br/>
receiving the pushing, and it has to be up to them when the pushing should <br/>
stop.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
