<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tim, my dh, and I were enjoying a cup of coffee this morning.   We are <br/>
&gt; sitting just off our kitchen, next to our screen porch.  (Couldn&#39;t go out in the <br/>
&gt; porch this a.m., too cool)   Anyway,,, I take a sip of coffee and lookup,  <br/>
&gt; here, a hummingbird has flown right into the screen.   <br/>
&gt; Ya see, last summer we hadn&#39;t finished the screen and they would fly right <br/>
&gt; through.  We kept saying, &quot;oohh,  that porch is going to be a rude awakening <br/>
&gt; for the hummingbirds!&quot;   <br/>
&gt; He was stuck for maybe 20 seconds and visions of Flit (I think that was his <br/>
&gt; name of the hummingbird in the movie Pocahontas) stuck in the canoe, came to <br/>
&gt; mind.     It was pretty funny,  he&#39;s fine, went and drank from the feeder.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know my tune would probably be different if he would have gotten hurt,  <br/>
&gt; but he was so darn cute flying there,  then backing out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; I love watching those little birds!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a week behind---OOT and all that. <br/>
<br/>
We get hummmingbirds stuck on the inside of our back porch all the time. This <br/>
is the ONLY way to catch them! &lt;G&gt;  But catch them I do---and call the boys <br/>
so we can look &quot;up close&quot;---before we set them free.<br/>
<br/>
Such cool little creatures!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We got one on our back porch last year, and I got panicked. They can starve <br/>
to death so quickly, they need to eat like every ten minutes?  I learned this <br/>
after reading that the red emergency pull handle for my garage door opener can <br/>
attract hummingbirds into getting stuck in the garage, and they can die <br/>
quickly. It was recommended painting the red handle a different color, or keeping <br/>
the garage closed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440689448">I stepped out on my porch yesterday and was face to face with a hummingbird.<br/>
He was very bold and acted as though I wasn&#39;t even there.  He even perched<br/>
on a branch for a few seconds, even though he was within easy reach.<br/>
Beautiful little thing.<br/>
<br/>
I remember watching a female raise her brood from a friend&#39;s living room<br/>
window several years ago.  The nest was just below her window and you could<br/>
see directly into it and see the eggs, then babies.  I visited several times<br/>
a week so I got to see the whole process.  I&#39;ve never seen a hummingbird<br/>
nest before or since.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420578103">Aren&#39;t their feathers just the coolest!  The colors and the way it looks<br/>
psychedelic when they&#39;re all together.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never caught one but we found a dead one once and looked and looked<br/>
and looked at it,  very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Kelli~  remembering she has to go fill the feeder.<br/>
