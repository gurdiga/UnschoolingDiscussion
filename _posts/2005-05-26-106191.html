<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240783339">Hello, my name is Jenny and this is my first post to this group. I <br/>
have two girls, ages four and two, and have been reading about <br/>
unschooling for about three years now. A couple of you may know me <br/>
from one of the Christian lists.<br/>
<br/>
We have always been fairly easy-going about food, but a couple <br/>
months ago I really tried to let them make almost all food choices <br/>
themselves. I really want my girls to not have weird food hang-ups <br/>
and stuff. I don&#39;t want them to eat mindlessly wihout being hungry, <br/>
or have to &quot;clean their plates.&quot; I don&#39;t want them to think of <br/>
sweets as a &quot;reward&quot; or fruit as a &quot;requirement&quot; that needs to be <br/>
choked down, ya know, that kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, I was punished by &quot;no desserts for a week.&quot; One <br/>
time when I was about seven my parents hosted some sort of party and <br/>
I ate so much I threw up. When I was in college, a friend actually <br/>
sat down with me and said, &quot;You know, when someone offers you <br/>
cookies, they don&#39;t mean, Eat the whole bag.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway! I&#39;m wondering if, in my quest for them making choices, I&#39;m <br/>
being too passive. The concerns I have are mostly with my four year <br/>
old, although my two year does similar things to a lesser extent.<br/>
<br/>
She/they seem to want to eat all day long! For the four year old, <br/>
breakfast might be two bowls of oatmeal, or maybe something like <br/>
rice chex, and/or a couple eggs. They both often help themselves <br/>
to &quot;stick cheese&quot; sometimes several times a day. They also both like <br/>
to have &quot;snack bowls&quot; of dry cereal throughout the day, usually <br/>
Froot Loops or maybe Chex or Cheerios.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest does not like fruit much; she might eat some once or twice <br/>
a week. If I serve peas, corn, or potatoes at dinner, she&#39;ll usually <br/>
have some. <br/>
<br/>
I guess now that I&#39;m typing it doesn&#39;t sound too bad. My main <br/>
concerns are that they are just eating too much or having &quot;bad <br/>
habits.&quot; They like to eat snack bowls while they watch TV or when I <br/>
read to them, or even during short car rides, isn&#39;t that something <br/>
pediatricians say not to allow? They eat *several* times a day; <br/>
maybe like eight, but I couldn&#39;t even know. It seems like all day I <br/>
hear &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; or &quot;I want a snack&quot; or see them reaching for more <br/>
cheese. I&#39;m just afraid that kind of Eating Continually will lead to <br/>
overeating.<br/>
<br/>
My other concern is them eating things like Froot Loops and candy.  <br/>
The obvious answer would be, Don&#39;t buy those things ... but I don&#39;t <br/>
want any one food, really, to be &quot;forbidden&quot; or something &quot;we don&#39;t <br/>
keep in our house,&quot; so when they&#39;re in the store with me and ask for <br/>
those chewy, sugary fruit snacks, or whatever, I let them get it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve talked with my four year old about things like listening to <br/>
your tummy, when it says it&#39;s empty or filled up. We&#39;ve also talked <br/>
about eating a variety of different foods, which I guess she does to <br/>
some extent. I have noticed that she *will* announce, &quot;I&#39;m done&quot; <br/>
herself and leave even things like ice cream or cake and walk away <br/>
from them. On one hand, I&#39;m glad *she* is the one making that <br/>
decision, instead of me telling her when she&#39;s had enough. But I&#39;m <br/>
wondering if she&#39;s eating too much before she stops.<br/>
<br/>
So I can&#39;t tell, even as I&#39;m writing this, if I&#39;m &quot;worrying about <br/>
nothing&quot; or if I need to guide her a little more in her choices, or <br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947531010">One thing is that we&#39;re trained to &quot;3 square meals&quot; which is totally <br/>
wrong for kids, and most adults too. If you check with any reputable <br/>
dietician, they&#39;re likely to tell people should eat 5 or 6 times per <br/>
day in smaller quantities (like crackers and cheese, a piece of <br/>
fruit, yogurt, etc - not 6 &quot;meals&quot;). My 7 yr old DS (he&#39;ll be 7 in <br/>
exactly one week) will eat 6 to 8 &quot;times&quot; on average in a day. <br/>
Keeping a consistent blood sugar level is the thing - the 3 big <br/>
square meals thing causes big highs and lows and that&#39;s not a good <br/>
thing. Regular input of proteins, complex carbs, etc keeps things <br/>
way more level and healthy. There&#39;s no way you can know what is &quot;too <br/>
much&quot; for a growing child. My DS can (and did last night) eat 7 <br/>
pancakes at a sitting (I ate 3 and was comfortable). He can eat an <br/>
entire personal-size watermelon or an average sized canteloupe over <br/>
the course of a day (we cut it up and make it easily accessible). He <br/>
also tends to be on a 36 hr eating schedule - sometimes he eats the <br/>
bulk of his intake between rising and about 1 pm, other times it&#39;s <br/>
between noon and 5, and other times it&#39;s late afternoon into <br/>
evening. By not forcing his natural rhythms to match &quot;breakfast <br/>
time, lunchtime, dinnertime&quot;, he eats as he gets hungry, not simply <br/>
because the clock says so. I&#39;m not going to stop him - in some <br/>
cases, I might double check with him about what it is he wants. We <br/>
have a list of protein foods and another of potassium foods on our <br/>
kitchen chalkboard because DS often chooses based on whether he <br/>
feels a need for protein or something else. His favorite thing is to <br/>
pick something that combines protein, complex carbs, and potassium <br/>
(he latched onto that one in a discussion of potassium and sodium <br/>
and blood pressure because DH is hyprertensive). PBJ on whole grain <br/>
bread with strawberry jam fits that, for example. Or he&#39;ll have <br/>
cheese and crackers and fruit juice.<br/>
<br/>
Anecdotal evidence: he fell in love with a particular kind of snack <br/>
cake last fall. We&#39;d pick up a box at the grocery when we shopped. <br/>
One week, they were on sale 5 boxes for $5 - so we got 5 boxes. He <br/>
ate a bunch from the first box, some from the second box, I used <br/>
most of the 5th box for sack lunches for work. When they were gone, <br/>
we were in that aisle at the market, I asked if he wanted to grab <br/>
more. He said &quot;No. Where&#39;s the cottage cheese at?&quot; Another time, we <br/>
were in the dairy aisle and I asked him if we should get ice cream, <br/>
he said &quot;No, we&#39;ve still got some in the freezer&quot;. He&#39;s not needy <br/>
about food, and he understands the trade offs involved in budgeting <br/>
as well - x and y both cost $3, we can only afford $3 this week. <br/>
Which should we get? And, over time, casual discussions as we shop <br/>
over things like sugar, sodium, price, nutrients, etc he&#39;s <br/>
developing his own personal choices - for instance, he just will not <br/>
eat &#39;pancake syrup&#39; which is just dyed corn syrup, it&#39;s gotta be <br/>
actual maple from an actual tree type syrup.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about snacks and car rides, I think (never heard that one <br/>
personally) is more about the risks of choking than about the actual <br/>
food intake, I would guess.<br/>

<br/>
That is SO natural and healthy!!<br/>
<br/>
Good job!!<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I&#39;d change would be to have some more variety of foods <br/>
cut up into small bits and sitting ready and available.<br/>
<br/>
Cut up little bits of fruit and put them on toothpicks. Or little bits <br/>
of leftover meat. Or whatever.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Baby Bel cheeses are a current favorite at our house - mild flavor, <br/>
perfectly kid sized, wrapped in fun-to-play-with red wax. Also, you <br/>
can make slices of whatever cheeses they like (cheddar, swiss, <br/>
american, etc) and use mini-cookie cutters to make shapes then store <br/>
the shape-cheese in small zip lock bags, 4 or 6 shapes per bag so it <br/>
is &quot;single serving size&quot;. Way cheaper and fresher and bigger variety <br/>
of shapes and types than the store bought shape cheese. String <br/>
cheese (aka &quot;stick cheese&quot; in our house) was a big favorite until DS <br/>
was about 3 or 4, then his range of cheeses grew and today it <br/>
includes things like parmesan, romano, provolone, ricotta, feta, and <br/>
raclette (and Velveeta for the &#39;perfect&#39; grilled cheese) plus the <br/>
usual cheddars and Monterey Jack and all.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476825351">When our kids were little, sometimes I&#39;d make sandwiches, cut the middles  <br/>
out with cookie cutters, and while they ate the &quot;ooh, ah!&quot; fun ones, Keith and I <br/>
 ate &quot;the negatives.&quot;  Works with egg salad, tuna, peanut butter or grilled  <br/>
cheese.  Doesn&#39;t work as well with lunchmeat or lettuce in there.<br/>
 <br/>
But other than fun suggestions, I think limiting and expressing (however  <br/>
non-verbally) worry and disapproval is likely to cause MORE eating, not less (if  <br/>
not now, years from now).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah - lettuce, tomato, other &quot;slidy&quot; things on top of things would be <br/>
tough but lunchmeats and cheeses can be cut to shape as well. We&#39;ve <br/>
used a cut&#39;n&#39;seal thing many times too -it removes crusts and crimps <br/>
the bread so it forms a sealed pocket with the tuna or PBJ or whatever <br/>
inside. Also tortilla rollups cut into hors d&#39;ouevre sizes work well <br/>
too - cream cheese, ham, and dill pickle spear roll ups are a favorite <br/>
at our house and at family gatherings. For Christmas, I used plain, <br/>
tomato/basil, and spinach tortillas so I had &quot;festive holiday colors&quot; <br/>
too.</div>

read to them, or even during short car rides, isn&#39;t that something <br/>

<br/>
I think that pediatricians in general are more likely to offer strategies<br/>
that support traditional coercive parenting with ideas about the worst case<br/>
scenario in mind (the choking reference). In traditional parenting the focus<br/>
is on increasing and maintaining controls, which pretty much means making<br/>
rules that exclude more and more scenarios. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  They eat *several* times a day; <br/>
maybe like eight, but I couldn&#39;t even know. It seems like all day I <br/>
hear &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; or &quot;I want a snack&quot; or see them reaching for more <br/>
cheese. I&#39;m just afraid that kind of Eating Continually will lead to <br/>
overeating. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See the Gessell Institute books on child development for a good explanation<br/>
of different body types - ectomorph etc - and the eating styles that go with<br/>
them. Ignore the &quot;help them at school&quot; related stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I seem to remember Jayn being a consumer of greater apparent volume when she<br/>
was younger at different times. Generally it would seem to be preparation<br/>
for a growth spurt either physical or cognitive. Recently she couldn&#39;t get<br/>
enough pasta or mashed potatoes. Suddenly her vocabulary and the<br/>
sophistication of her manner and way of speaking matured, as did her<br/>
willingness for (insistence on!) separation from me.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve talked with my four year old about things like listening to <br/>
your tummy, when it says it&#39;s empty or filled up.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had that conversation with Jayn. It would be like saying &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
forget to breathe&quot; to her - unnecessary and likely to have her wonder if she<br/>
was &quot;breathing wrongly&quot;. But we have never had any food restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; So I can&#39;t tell, even as I&#39;m writing this, if I&#39;m &quot;worrying about <br/>
nothing&quot; or if I need to guide her a little more in her choices, or <br/>
something else.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok I will pick up the gauntlet. You *are* worrying about *nothing*. If you<br/>
start trying to guide her choices, you will cause her to start doubting<br/>
herself, a much worse scenario than anything you have described in your<br/>
delightful sounding life. <br/>

little sandwich baggies full of Cheerios &lt;G&gt;.I think that&#39;s just smart <br/>
and supportive and sensible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go way out on a limb, though, and say to the mom who <br/>
started this - beware of finding things to worry about - there are <br/>
people who want to fuss over their kids just because it makes them feel <br/>
good as a parent - like by &quot;worrying&quot; about something, they&#39;re better <br/>
parents. But they don&#39;t do their kids any favors that way.<br/>

<br/>
I realized that I *have* suggested to Jayn to take a deep breath sometimes<br/>
when she is getting distressed and breathing fast and shallow. I was<br/>
referring to continual ordinary &quot;unconscious-of-it&quot; breathing when I used<br/>
that as a parallel natural process to eating. Maybe someone can think of a<br/>
better one.<br/>

you so clearly answer your own worry before you even state it.<br/>
<br/>
She stops.  Cake, ice cream, the typical &quot;kid magnet&quot; foods, and she<br/>
walks away.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s not walking away when she&#39;s full, then why else would she be<br/>
walking away when there&#39;s still some left?<br/>
<br/>
You have nothing to worry about. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
