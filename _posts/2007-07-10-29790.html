there?  (He&#39;s moving to Austin in six weeks, to work, and it&#39;s a 15  <br/>

feet deep or so, and has racks.)<br/>

<br/>
What&#39;s been forgotten that people wish they had brought from home?<br/>
<br/>
This might seem off the topic of unschooling, but moving from one  <br/>
place to another is another of those things people learn naturally,  <br/>
from experience, pretty much, or observation, or asking.   (Though if  <br/>
anyone knows of websites or online checklists that would be great.  A  <br/>
year or some ago there was one in the USAA insurance magazine, but  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411790258">Okay...this may sound silly and I&#39;m not sure this is the type of answer you are looking for..<br/>
The first things that came to my mind were A TOASTER and CAN OPENER.  The first time I moved away from home (moved two states away)...I got everything (which was not much) unpacked and felt settled in and wanted to eat something that I made in my very own kitchen.  I didn&#39;t have a can opener to even open a can of soup.  Had a pan, bowl, spoon and can of soup...no opener.  Okay...I&#39;ll make an egg sandwich on toasted bread...no toaster.  I had scrambeled eggs.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to Kirby on his move...how exciting!  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get lots of updates on his journey and how things unfold for him.<br/>

Austin vs. Albuquerque?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d take everything he can fit that he already owns and buy stuff  <br/>
there that he doesn&#39;t unless it&#39;s way more expensive there.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the essentials would be: clothes he loves, any work things he  <br/>
needs, a basic set of pots/pans/dishes/knives, a computer, a cell  <br/>
phone, a bicycle if he rides one, and a lamp.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I like to pack light &lt;gg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting something that will make me say &quot;duh,&quot; but  <br/>

 <br/>
With a $1500 moving allowance and not much to move, he might want to check  <br/>
online with U-Pack. _www.upack.com_ (http://www.upack.com)    They  will bring <br/>
a small pod to your house.  You pack it and they pick it up and  deliver it <br/>
your destination. We found out to actually be cheaper than the times  we did it <br/>
ourselves and certainly much more convenient.<br/>
 <br/>
We have used both the U-Haul method (once with a trailer behind our car  <br/>
right out of college) and another time driving a U-Haul truck as well as the  <br/>
U-Pack.  Recently, my children&#39;s dad just moved from Austin to here  (Florida) and <br/>
he used 3 of the pods for all his stuff.  <br/>
 <br/>
Of course, Albuquerque to Austin isn&#39;t as far as we  were moving (you can <br/>
make it in 13 hours easily..&lt;g&gt;)  I  don&#39;t have much advice for what to bring but <br/>
I can offer some Austin  recommendations after living there for 14 years and <br/>
still missing it after 10  here in Florida.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My questions would be these: Is the $1500 for moving costs that <br/>
the company needs a receipt for and will reimburse? Or is it <br/>
$1500 that the company will give directly to Kirby? Also, is it <br/>
$1500 for each of the young men? <br/>
<br/>
I moved six times, each times more than 300 miles, while I was <br/>
single. Since I&#39;ve been married, I&#39;ve moved to different cities four <br/>
different times. One of those moves was nearly 2,000 miles; the <br/>
other two were each about 80 miles.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that it unless he has special furniture that he really <br/>
wants to bring or special electronic equipment, I would try to <br/>
avoid the whole trailer set-up. <br/>
<br/>
If he has a lot of special electronic equipment that won&#39;t fit in the <br/>
vehicle he travels in, I&#39;d probably price a moving company -- <br/>
which can be less expensive than you&#39;d think. Particularly if Kirby <br/>
gets together with his friend, it might be a better deal and <br/>
considerably less hassle -- particularly since this is a funded <br/>
move.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Austin is a huge college town, and there are <br/>
likely a lot of second-hand stores that cater to the student market <br/>
and who get their stock from the student market. There&#39;s also an <br/>
Ikea store, in addition to many Targets, which will have the same <br/>
prices as the Targets in Albuquerque. Ikea will be a great way to <br/>
furnish a first apartment; it has well-designed, inexpensive <br/>
kitchen supplies as well as furniture (I&#39;m not a huge fan of the <br/>
furniture, but it&#39;s inexpensive. It does require assembly.)<br/>
<br/>
I made a huge mistake when I moved from Albuquerque to <br/>
South Bend, Ind., when I was 18 because I imagined that a) I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to get off campus to find things and b) the <br/>
things I needed wouldn&#39;t be available in Indiana (at the time, <br/>
good salsa and green chile *were* hard to find, but those things <br/>
soon arrived). So I overpacked. Big time. Plus, I then needed <br/>
things that I hadn&#39;t anticipated. Fortunately, South Bend did <br/>
indeed have stores!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I would encourage Kirby to bring what he knows he <br/>
wants to bring and not try too hard to anticipate needs.<br/>

No, that&#39;s great.   Thank you.<br/>
That&#39;s part of what we were wondering is what have people forgotten  <br/>
and wished they had.<br/>
<br/>
But the suggestions of the pod-shipping or moving company are great,  <br/>
too.<br/>
I thought he should just take what will fit in his car and take a  <br/>
futon to sleep on and decide when he gets there what he needs and  <br/>
wants and get it later, but I&#39;m passing all these things to him and  <br/>
THANK YOU ALL.<br/>
<br/>
Any little thing anyone thinks of would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
We will face the difficult decisions about which DVDs he takes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Music is easier now, with iTunes and Mp3 players, at least.<br/>
<br/>
And HOW WONDERFUL that his cell phone number will be the same and we  <br/>
can all IM and e-mail.  It&#39;s not as bad as it would&#39;ve been in  <br/>
earlier decades.<br/>

For each.<br/>
They give them the money.  If they stay less than a year, they owe  <br/>
some of  it back (I assume they wouldn&#39;t get their last two checks,  <br/>
or whatever--it would be pro-rated for however many months they were  <br/>
there).<br/>

pop tops :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say a toaster oven is more versatile than a toaster (got one for a<br/>
wedding present ten years ago and never went back to a toaster).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also make sure to pack some toilet paper, and a bath towel and all<br/>
applicable toiletries. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe have a bag (with a few changes of clothes and toiletries as if<br/>
he were going on a weekend trip) easily accessible so he doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to search for stuff right when he gets there.<br/>
<br/>
Sheets for the futon. Pillows. Light bulbs. Does he already have an<br/>
apartment arranged, or does he have to find something once he is there?  <br/>
<br/>
He probably has to pay taxes on the 1500.00.<br/>
<br/>
Quarters for laundry.<br/>
<br/>
All right, I&#39;ll stop now :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895647862">Moving things is almost more expensive than acquiring them.  (Esp.<br/>
things like light bulbs and coat hangers).<br/>
<br/>
My first post-college move I did via airplane, with the knowledge that<br/>
I might have to walk as much as 4 miles on the other end.  I had a<br/>
duffel bag and two boxes.  In the bottom of the duffel bad were a thin<br/>
pillow, a quilt, a sheet, one setting of silverware, one paring knife,<br/>
a small sauce pan, a partial roll of toilet paper, a second pair of<br/>
shoes, and sweater.  The rest was clothes.  In one of the boxes was my<br/>
computer, and in the other important papers and books.<br/>
<br/>
I acquired a few things here and there, but until we had the first<br/>
baby, no move occupied more than one car (Subaru) load.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341885424">Warning:42 year old women remembering her youth up ahead...kinda OT<br/>
<br/>
Oh Boy I moved alot after college...it was such a great adventure. The <br/>
first really big one was from SC to what I tought was gonna be <br/>
California ;-) My VW Rabbit didn&#39;t fair to well in the Rocky Mountains <br/>
and this was after some break down in Kansas (can&#39;t even remember <br/>
now...too old &lt;g&gt;) Anyhoo, I just desided to call a friend of a friend <br/>
in Breckenridge and ask if I could stay on her floor until I found a <br/>
place to live. Thats what I did...I found a place to live in a couple <br/>
of days, got a job and had the best time all winter long, skiing, silk <br/>
screening t-shirts and meeting boys ;-) The last boy I met ended up to <br/>
be my husband that is right upstairs now! I guess I was meant to have a <br/>
broken down old car in Colorado with out even a place to live, a can <br/>
opener or a Toaster and I wouldn&#39;t trade it for the world. So I guess <br/>
my recommendation to Kirby is go and start the next big adventure...who <br/>
knows what you&#39;ll need...but one thing is for sure with the love and <br/>
support of friends and family you&#39;ll always be fine. Have Fun and good <br/>
luck! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350368175">The one thing that I remember specifically was that my Mom bought me a<br/>
brand new set of towels. There were plenty of old grubby ones I could<br/>
have packed, but my Mom was insistent that I have new towels -<br/>
something she herself considered a luxury! They were green and I still<br/>
have them 20 years later. I did appreciate the sentiment.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the moving allowance goes I would do all I could to keep the<br/>
costs of the physical move low because there will be plenty of little<br/>
expenses that will add up when setting up in a new home- especially<br/>
for the first time, i.e., a broom, mop, toilet plunger, toilet brush,<br/>
trash cans, lightbulbs, and pantry supplies like spices and such.<br/>
Although I know I ate a lot of rice cakes and peanutbutter and pizza<br/>
bought by the slice!- Alyse<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568636873">I have never lived at a single address for more than two years until I <br/>
married and have been here for 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I did when I moved from Australia to Texas was to pack up <br/>
all my books into boxes and leave them with my best friend. When I was <br/>
settled in Los Angeles, she shipped them to me (on a pallet). But the key <br/>
point is that they were pre-packed into liftable sized boxes.<br/>
<br/>
When I travelled in Australia, I always took those things that had personal <br/>
meaning to me - my books and my sewing machine. How quickly is Kirby to <br/>
report for work upon arrival? Perhaps he would need an iron if he has to <br/>
iron his work shirt. I would pack a towel for the shower and my personal <br/>
toiletries.<br/>
<br/>
If Austin is anything like where I live (close to a college) Kirby might be <br/>
able to furnish a lot of his apartment via the back alleys of apartment <br/>
buildings. We are constantly noticing very nice furniture put out back for <br/>
every room, and indeed have done the same ourselves. One day I saw a <br/>
distinctively shaped sofa in one alley, while the matching loveseat was in <br/>
another alley - I imagine that the set was originally put out together but <br/>
has been split up and recycled around different apartments over time. When I <br/>
put out our old dining set, someone approached me even as I was carrying it <br/>
out and wanted it. It&#39;s better than Craig&#39;s List, our alley!<br/>
<br/>
Austin has plenty of thrift stores as I recall as well as an artsy vibe. I <br/>
remember one slightly shady character who nonetheless could tell me where I <br/>
could find just about anything I needed for the film I was working on, <br/>
including a stuffed armadillo for very little money - Virgil Borders at All <br/>
American Recycling. He had a junk yard that was one of the exterior <br/>
locations for &quot;Love and a .45&quot;. Everyone was extremely helpful to the film. <br/>
The Department of Roads (or whatever it was called) made up a bunch of <br/>
custom road signs for me, and when I went to ask how much they cost, were <br/>
surprised and said they were free! Now that doesn&#39;t happen in Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
I would always say to have a microwave, but sometimes (rarely) they are <br/>
included in apartments. It is not something I would haul, but buy locally. <br/>
It&#39;s not like he&#39;s moving to the back of beyond. He&#39;s moving to a fairly <br/>
cosmopolitan little city.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079309804">My first thought was an electric rice steamer and 2 lamps. One for the <br/>
bedroom and one for the living room, just in case there&#39;s no overhead <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476269981">Ooooh, moving is so exciting, and I&#39;m so happy for Kirby.  I&#39;ve <br/>
heard Austin is way cool. (Not weather cool, but groovy cool.) <br/>
<br/>
How is Mom holding up? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the &quot;pack what you absoutely need to get through the <br/>
day, buy the rest there&quot; crowd. <br/>
<br/>
Also seconding the very good idea to have one box or bag with the <br/>
stuff you are going to want right away like toilet paper, soap, <br/>
shampoo, toothbrush, towel/washcloth, light bulbs, sheets (if there <br/>
is a mattress to put them on!) pajamas.  Be sure to label this and <br/>
all boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The last time we moved we got a book (I think it was put out by a <br/>
real estate company) that went through the best way to pack.  It <br/>
will cover more than Kirby needs, as it talks about moving <br/>
appliances and all that stuff, but very good tips nevertheless. <br/>
(Like have cleaning supplies in a caddy nearby as you pack, and <br/>
clean your stuff before you pack it.  It&#39;s so much nicer having <br/>
clean stuff in a new apartment!) Lots of realtor websites have <br/>
packing tips.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374185740">On our last move, we were in our house for several weeks before our  <br/>
belongings arrived.  We didn&#39;t have beds and what worked for us was to buy  a couple <br/>
of queen size air mattresses.  If it&#39;s going to take a while  to find beds, <br/>
they come in very handy. <br/>
 <br/>
Then they can be stored in a closet and when mom comes to visit, Kirby  can <br/>
sleep on an air mattress and she can have his bed! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s very odd.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve seen friends and acquaintances and relatives push their 18 year  <br/>
olds out (or start pushing when they&#39;re sixteen, with pressure to  <br/>
apply to college or investigate military opportunities), and then  <br/>
either say &quot;bye bye&quot; or &quot;pay rent&quot; on the should-be-happy 18th birthday.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t do that.  I didn&#39;t really know what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby turns 21 July 29 and has to be at work in Austin August 27.<br/>
<br/>
I feel excited and afraid and happy and sad.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s balancing out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962307547">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m normally a lurker but being a Navy brat, I do have a little <br/>
experience moving, so I thought I&#39;d share!  Often when we moved it would <br/>
take a day or two for the electricity to actually get turned on so pack <br/>
like your camping (flashlights, cooler for food, coleman stove, <br/>
utensils, toilet paper, stuff like that).<br/>
<br/>
As far as packing goes, my dad was a great packer!  He&#39;s an engineer so <br/>
he has great spatial abilities!  Always good to find someone like that <br/>
to help out!  That can make a huge difference at how much you fit in the <br/>
van/u-haul!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard Austin is a great city!  There&#39;s a cool bat bridge <br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m hoping I can have that excited and happy feeling when my kids  leave.  I <br/>
know already that I&#39;ll have the afraid and sad.  Brenna is  almost 18 and <br/>
plans to go somewhere away from home for college next fall.<br/>
 <br/>
While trying to figure out best ways for her to apply to colleges, I asked  <br/>
her yesterday how important it was for her to go next fall on a scale of 1 -  <br/>
10.  She said a 9.  I wish that it was not so soon but she is so  excited about <br/>
a new phase in her life and for her that means not so close to  home.  <br/>
 <br/>
It will be different than Kirby going because she will probably come home  <br/>
during breaks but still...I&#39;m not ready yet.  I&#39;ll do everything I can,  though, <br/>
to help her make it happen.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad that you are having those balanced feelings and hope as the year  <br/>
goes on that I can get to that point.  I remember when I left New Mexico  with a <br/>
U-Haul behind me and such a feeling of adventure.  I don&#39;t remember  giving <br/>
my parents much thought at all and only now do I realize how  difficult it must <br/>
have been for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952277234"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But the suggestions of the pod-shipping or moving company are great,<br/>
&gt; too.<br/>
&gt; I thought he should just take what will fit in his car and take a<br/>
&gt; futon to sleep on and decide when he gets there what he needs and<br/>
&gt; wants and get it later, but I&#39;m passing all these things to him and<br/>
&gt; THANK YOU ALL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any little thing anyone thinks of would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We will face the difficult decisions about which DVDs he takes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; Music is easier now, with iTunes and Mp3 players, at least.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The pod company we used was Smart Move www.gosmartmove.com  We were <br/>
happy with them for our (much larger!) move last summer. <br/>
<br/>
If he can fit his basic electronic needs, clothing, and spare items from <br/>
the family home into his car he could probably get everything else <br/>
cheaply at yard sales or thrift stores or Ikea, thus saving any other <br/>
moving costs. Or if the family homes have extra stuff the young men can <br/>
take, they could split a moving container.  I wouldn&#39;t take the trailer <br/>
or van unless someone is going with them to bring it back.<br/>
<br/>
I like thinking about this kind of thing, so after thinking about my <br/>
first apartment, here&#39;s my list of first apartment basics:<br/>
<br/>
Stock pot w/removable strainer, 2qt pot, large skillet, stirfry pan, <br/>
9x11 pan, pizza pan, spatula, cooking spoon(s), tongs, potholder, dish <br/>
towels, set of 4+ dishes and cutlery and glasses and mugs, dish drainer, <br/>
large and small mixing/serving bowl, large and small sharp knife, bread <br/>
knife, large cutting board, vegetable peeler, grater, can opener, <br/>
toaster, blender or food processor/blender combo, coffee making <br/>
equipment of choice, covered pyrex casserole, microwave (if not in <br/>
apartment)<br/>
Futon or air mattress, pillows, sheets, duvet, lamp, clothing, hangers, <br/>
sleep mask in case there are no curtains (voice of experience), ear <br/>
plugs in case it&#39;s a party complex (voice of experience again!), laundry <br/>
basket<br/>
Toiletries, plunger, towels, bath mat<br/>
Swiffer sweep&vac for hard floors (can use w/o vac for sweeping, w/vac <br/>
for crumbs, and w/wet cloth for mopping), vacuum for carpet<br/>
computer, television, stereo, dvd player, game console<br/>
couch, chair(s), side table(s), dining room table&chairs, bookshelves, <br/>
tv stand, dresser, bed, shower curtain, window coverings (half the <br/>
places I&#39;ve rented had none)<br/>
100-hour+ DVR and/or Netflix subscription so he doesn&#39;t take your dvds ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to Kirby as he steps into this new adventure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709026448">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The one thing that I remember specifically was that my Mom bought me a<br/>
brand new set of towels. There were plenty of old grubby ones I could<br/>
have packed, but my Mom was insistent that I have new towels -<br/>
something she herself considered a luxury! They were green and I still<br/>
have them 20 years later. I did appreciate the sentiment.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
My mom loaded me up with lots of her old dishes and cookware.  I <br/>
still have lots of it 28 years later, and being the sentimental fool <br/>
I am, I really liked that the things I used every day were things <br/>
that had been in the family and had some history.  This was when I <br/>
went away to college and moved to my first apartment .  My parents <br/>
drove the car that pulled the little trailer.   Then they took me to <br/>
the grocery store and helped me load my refrigerator and cabinets <br/>
with staples.  I remember feeling a little eager to get rid of them <br/>
and start life on my own but extremely grateful for their <br/>
help.  Somehow the material things gave me an emotional cushion to <br/>
land on while being on my own for the first time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-985335099">Take what you&#39;d need if you were camping and anything you absolutely love.<br/>
Sell the rest at a yard sale and buy what you need (maybe at yard sales)<br/>
when you get there.  Living on the minimum temporarily is a good way to<br/>
figure out what you really like to have.  You may find that you don&#39;t want<br/>
to replace the stuff you left behind but instead want to decorate your life<br/>
with different stuff.  You can always have your mom send you something you<br/>
miss.  In fact, if it seems like too much trouble to have someone send it to<br/>
you it is probably not worth bringing.<br/>
 <br/>
FWIW, my husband has a completely different take.  He likes to bring as much<br/>
as possible on the company&#39;s dime cuz &quot;They&#39;ll pay to move you but they<br/>
won&#39;t pay to buy you new stuff.&quot;  We actually live somewhere between these<br/>
two philosophies.  Good luck and have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708237042">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel excited and afraid and happy and sad.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that feeling. I have 4 sons and all but one have left home. <br/>
Fortunately for me, they all live close - the furtherest lives 2 1/2 <br/>
hours away. My eldest son did do a 2 year stint at the bottom of the <br/>
South Island of New Zealand at one stage (Winton, near Invercargil, for <br/>
those who love to pull out the maps and follow things) and that was hard.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it is exciting and happy - and scary and sad. Such a mix of <br/>
feelings. But because you have been the sort of mother you have, they <br/>
will keep in touch, and visit and you will be welcome at their place. <br/>
Phones and e-mails and msm and texting and even an occasional snail mail <br/>
letter - all keep me close to mine.<br/>
<br/>
My #2 son Steve (23), moved 2 1/2 hours away at the beginning of the <br/>
year to start a degree in Performance Jazz (saxophone, and also now <br/>
taking up flute). One of his best friends, James (21) (homeschooled) has <br/>
gone too, and they are living together, along with Steve&#39;s partner, <br/>
Heidi (also home/unschooled). Last week my youngest son Jeff (17), had <br/>
to perform in the New Zealand Brass Band National competitions near <br/>
where the kids are living. It&#39;s a tiny flat but we were welcome to stay. <br/>
We had been very very busy for the previous month, and I had not been <br/>
looking forward to this trip. We got to the flat just after lunch and my <br/>
son and his girlfriend weren&#39;t there but Jeff and I just spent the <br/>
afternoon hanging out with James and his visiting girlfriend. By the <br/>
time Jeff had had his 2 hour band practice, Steve and Heidi were home <br/>
and all 6 of us went to the movies together (Blades of Glory). The next <br/>
morning was the competition (or Jeff&#39;s part of it) and then we went back <br/>
to the flat to get our things and say goodbye. Except it was a grey, <br/>
rainy day outside and inside we were so welcome, and the talk was good. <br/>
I spent a couple of hours talking to Steve, a couple more with Heidi, <br/>
James tore himself away from his girlfriend (schooled) a couple of times <br/>
to come sit next to me and have a hug (the schooled girlfriend seemed a <br/>
little stunned but was ok about it!) - so eventually we got away about <br/>
5.30. It was the most relaxing, lovely two days!<br/>
<br/>
So what I discovered is that though I have &#39;lost&#39; a son and 2 friends - <br/>
I have gained an extra home. I felt completely welcome and at home in <br/>
their flat (apartment?) How many 55yo women can say that? And it&#39;s <br/>
because of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Last night all three arrived here, refugees from the storms in the north <br/>
- they had no power water or heating up there so all three came here. <br/>
They chose to come here rather than to the homes of either of the <br/>
others. I am soooooooo lucky :-)<br/>
<br/>
I reckon that&#39;s the way it will be for you. And you know, although I <br/>
miss them so very much, at times like these, when they choose me over <br/>
other options, that just fills me with such joy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719610817">One more vote for taking the minimum--electronics, clothes, bedding,<br/>
personal items that he&#39;ll need for it to feel like home--and buying<br/>
the rest in Austin.<br/>
<br/>
I would specifically caution against moving anything really bulky,<br/>
like a massive sofa or entertainment unit. I&#39;ve known more than one<br/>
person who was thrilled to get something like that free from a family<br/>
member, only to discover there was no way to get it up the stairs/in<br/>
the elevator/through the door of the new apartment.<br/>
<br/>
$1500 may sound like a lot, but getting set up can be expensive, so I<br/>
would spend as little of it on the actual getting-there as possible.<br/>
Utilities often require a deposit for first-timers and have turn-on<br/>
fees, there will be a deposit and first month&#39;s rent on the apartment,<br/>
and there may be a fee for a new driver&#39;s license/vehicle registration<br/>
(which he&#39;ll likely be required to get, by law). He&#39;ll need to make an<br/>
epic trip to the grocery store and Target for things like dish soap,<br/>
laundry detergent, sponges, kitchen towels, other cleaning supplies,<br/>
salt, pepper, other basic spices... Bear in mind, too, that his first<br/>
paycheck likely won&#39;t come for 3-4 weeks after his start date,<br/>
depending on the payroll cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, though, I&#39;d say have fun with it! He can&#39;t possibly leave<br/>
anything behind that couldn&#39;t be replaced, mailed, or retrieved on a<br/>
Cannonball Run trip home. If he finds himself late at night with a can<br/>
of refrieds and no can opener, well, time to hit the 24-hour Walmart.<br/>
