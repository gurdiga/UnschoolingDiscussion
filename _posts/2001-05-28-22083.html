I hope that doesn&#39;t mean that I won&#39;t finish most of what I start....that&#39;s <br/>
a bad trait I have already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually Terri, that&#39;s what kept me quilting &lt;G&gt;.  I hand pieced my first <br/>
quilt (took 2 years) and then just couldn&#39;t get the hang of hand quilting to <br/>
went to the machine.  I was pretty happy when I finished it, I don&#39;t think I <br/>
had ever finished ANY project before that quilt!  But I love quilts and I <br/>
want them in my house and I can&#39;t afford to buy them either.  At least if <br/>
you make them yourself, they are cheaper, they mean more to you and you can <br/>
spread the cost out.  I&#39;ve since finished a quilt for each of my kids <br/>
(simple block quilts, but got a little fancier on the quilting for my <br/>
daughter&#39;s) and a memory quilt for my mil.  I have FOUR wedding to attend <br/>
this year, the first one today and two others in June.  I have one top <br/>
pieced (I use the machine for everything now) and am ready to start cutting <br/>
the second.  In addition, my sister is having her first baby in August and <br/>
my mom was jealous of my mil&#39;s quilt, so I&#39;m trying to do a memory quilt for <br/>
her for Xmas this year!  I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I love it and <br/>
what a special gift I can give to others.  My family really doesn&#39;t have <br/>
much of what you would call heirlooms (jewelry, etc.) but now they will!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I do everything by machine and am getting pretty good at machine <br/>
quilting.  So far, I mainly stick to patterns in the many books that I have. <br/>
  My favorite book is Quilt&#39;s from The Quiltmaker&#39;s Gifts.  I&#39;ve used the <br/>
Double Irish Chain from that, the Lover&#39;s Knot and my next one is Around the <br/>
World.  They have great patters and are very easy to understand.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry so long, like you, it is my passion.<br/>
<br/>
