<div id="ygrps-yiv-944967818">&lt;I&#39;m still trying to learn how to not be stressed and not feel like <br/>
&lt;&#39;m neglecting the kids when I have to clean before company, but I&#39;m <br/>
&lt;getting better I think.  I&#39;ve been trying to make a conscious effort <br/>
&lt;to tell myself that this is who I am and that I don&#39;t need to put a <br/>
&lt;front on for other people (as in staying up until 4 am trying to get <br/>
&lt;the house presentable).  <br/>

Don&#39;t feel bad I am EXACTLY the same way! It&#39;s actually kinda nice knowing <br/>
I&#39;m not the only one that stays up till the wee hrs. of the morning before <br/>
company comes over. The scary part where I start crying is when someone calls <br/>
and says, &quot;I&#39;ll be right over.&quot; That really stresses me out espeacialy if <br/>
it&#39;s my husbands family! I live in an apartment with 3 children it&#39;s not that <br/>
easy keeping everything clean. The way I see it is why take time to wash <br/>
every few dishes that fall in the sink when I can load up the dishasher once <br/>
a day (hopefully). When I have extra energy days every now and then I&#39;m happy <br/>
to do a thorough job of cleaning.  We eat, we are clean, have clothes to <br/>
wear, and are happily enjoying life. Until someone comes over! hehe:-) I too <br/>
have to work on not stressing so much.<br/>
<br/>
warmly,<br/>
