<div id="ygrps-yiv-164615257">HI! I have been lurking for quite sometime, and thouroughly enjoying your<br/>
lively conversations!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sheri and I have five great kids, Mike is 13 (and 6&#39;1&quot;...can you<br/>
believe it? I can&#39;t, teehee),David is 8 1/2 (and the best speller in the<br/>
house), Andrew is 7 (and has beautiful  handwriting already), Joshua is 5<br/>
(and my future athlete), and  then there is my only girl Tirzah&#39; she is 3<br/>
(and very dramatic). I am married, to Dale and unfortunatly he isn&#39;t very<br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest didn&#39;t learn to read until he was 10 and is only now getting<br/>
interested in actually doing it. His spelling is terrible, but since he<br/>
found the internet and has some YIM friends, he is learning. Of course now I<br/>
have to &quot;fight&quot; for the computer....LOL. David is the opposite, he taught<br/>
himself to read at age 6 and hasn&#39;t stopped. Life is never boring around<br/>
here! :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, I live in Maine, at least for a few more months. My husband is in<br/>
the Coast Guard, so we move everything 3 years or so. We are due to move<br/>
soon. Most of the family considers moves as adventures, but my oldest is<br/>
having a harder time of it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t mean to write a novella. hahhahaha.... I will end it here. I<br/>
look forward to getting to know you all better. :)<br/>
<br/>
