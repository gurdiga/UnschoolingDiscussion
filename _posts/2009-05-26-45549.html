<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207843637">per the recent thread here, i thought i would post this link to an interview that just got published.  it&#39;s with me and my friend emily, and it&#39;s about connection and teenagers - not specifically about unschooling, because the audience is far broader than that, but you can certainly see all the &quot;unschooliness&quot; in our responses. <br/>
