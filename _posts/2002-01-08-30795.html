<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624796553">Sarah, that is funny you should tell me to think outside the box.  We joke about that at our house.  My 12 yo dd and dh are true outside the box thinkers.  My dd some times is way out there :-)  I am so inside the box it makes me mad.  Here is an embarrassing example:  I wanted to write better thank you notes so I had to go and get a book on it.  I always have to follow instructions or see an example first.  No free thinking here!  Maybe I&#39;ll get better at it the longer we unschool.  Hope so.<br/>

Hello again Pat,<br/>
Think of it like a commune. Everybody has freedoms but you also have to<br/>
respect your fellow munies :-) (is that a word?)  If you are used to the<br/>
kids being in bed at, say 10, then what you do now is tell them that they do<br/>
not have to adhere to a certain bedtime *but* they still have to respect<br/>
your privacy and your need for quiet time.  This has nothing to do with<br/>
unschooling.. it has to do with them learning how to live under the same<br/>
roof with others. <br/>
If it&#39;s quiet time you need, tell the kids that at 10:00, you plan on blah<br/>
blah blahing (reading?) and they are free to do something quietly in their<br/>
rooms or in the basement. If they choose not to, then *you* might just have<br/>
to choose to get up at 6a.m, playing that army wake-up call &lt;g&gt; and show<br/>
them what disrespect for others&#39; needs feels like.  I mean, tell them once<br/>
what is expected of them. If they don&#39;t do whatever it is, don&#39;t nag.. just<br/>
show them how it feels if the shoe were on the other foot.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re coming along great, Pat. Just think outside the box ;-)!<br/>

After giving my children the freedom to decide their own bedtime a few days<br/>
ago, I am beginning to miss my few hours of quiet time.  This is very hard. <br/>
How does everyone else get a moments piece?<br/>
