<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796180213">Hi everyone,<br/>
 I was wondering if maybe someone out there had advice regarding helping my 13 yr old brother relax and let learning happen.<br/>
 I have custody of my two brothers, Gabe, 13, and Matt, 11. While they have both been homeschooled for the last couple of years, this is our first time attempting unschooling. It is a learning process for all of us. <br/>
 Matt is starting to realize that everything he does is a learning activity, and is learning German, because he wants to, and reading books of his choice. He is having a blast with the pressure to pass to the next grade level removed.<br/>
 Gabe comes to me with tears in his eyes, saying, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m not DOING anything&quot; and &quot;What would an eight grader be learning right now?&quot; We have provided him with things he shows interest in, and he IS reading books that he loves. He is concerned he won&#39;t be able to get into college. He is worried that if he does manage to get in, that he will be unable to keep up intellectually with everyone else. He has seen the local public school curriculum, and realizes that he is way ahead of where they say he should be. (We live in a state that does not require testing.) He remembers public school vividly, and does NOT want to go back, because he felt bored and unchallenged all the time.    <br/>
 Are there any books we could read that might ease his fears? What else can I do to help him feel ok about the learning he IS doing? I have never been a parent before, and I&#39;m just learning, too! :-)<br/>
 Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Shari<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384877913">Hi Shari,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have much in the way of specific advice but if he wouldlike to<br/>
talk to others his own age in a similar schooling environment, you could<br/>
direct him to EclecticTeen @ Yahoo.  It&#39;s my daughters group.  Pretty<br/>
small and quiet but he could at least meet others.<br/>
<br/>
As for advice, all I can say is that he could probably start college<br/>
today and be academically advanced.  I&#39;ve been there as recently as five<br/>
years ago and I am astounded at what is comingout of our public high<br/>
schools.<br/>

They post some free text of his, and of course, sell his books.<br/>

Depending on your financial situation, you might want to also let him <br/>
know he has a choice of purchasing a cirriculum from one of the <br/>
homeschooling resource schools. I&#39;ve seen them range from $150 - $600. I <br/>
suppose it depends on how much paperwork and support for state regs one <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118553132">It will take him a while to feel comfortable learning by using.<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and<br/>
Get a Real Life and Education (1998 edition) should be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Also if he didn&#39;t think of college looming in 4 years, it would help. He<br/>
*can* wait. In fact colleges love older students because they&#39;re more<br/>
focused, generally have a better idea what they want from college rather<br/>
than as just the next step you&#39;re supposed to do after high school.<br/>
<br/>
Help him think of this time not as time to prepare for college and<br/>
adulthood, but as time to explore who he is and what he loves. Then college<br/>
isn&#39;t the next step of molding, it isn&#39;t just harder and more advanced high<br/>
school. It can be one of many ways of exploring things that interest him.<br/>
(Apprenticeships, volunteer work, independent study, job, and so on are some<br/>
other options.)<br/>
<br/>
He could also take community college courses at some point (if your state<br/>
allows it). Just out of interest. It might ease his mind about being able to<br/>
do college work if he&#39;s already started.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756121207">Hi, Shari!<br/>
<br/>
Someone else has already mentioned Grace Llewellyns The Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook. Be sure to get the revised edition  though I havent seen it, I<br/>
ve heard the changes are important. Id also recommend her second book, Real<br/>
Lives, in which unschooling teenagers describe how they spend their time.<br/>
She also organizes a summer Not Back to School Camp and another residential<br/>
unprogram that runs during the school year. Theres a website  do a<br/>
search on her name.<br/>
<br/>
I agree (with whoever made this comment) that it might be helpful to point<br/>
out to Gabe that college is a place he might want to go sometime, but not<br/>
necessarily, and that theres nothing magical about the age of 18. There was<br/>
an article in the New York Times some months back about the fact that many<br/>
colleges, including some of the most selective ones, now prefer applicants<br/>
who have been out in the world doing something for a year or two, over those<br/>
fresh out of high school. Ill try to find a link to that article for you.<br/>
<br/>
One book that questions the need for college (or college right away) is<br/>
The Question Is College. Another book, The Sheepskin Psychosis (which may be<br/>
out of print), gets deeply into the myths about college tuition being a good<br/>
investment in purely financial terms. A book that might get Gabe thinking<br/>
about the fact that even adults with degrees are not necessarily satisfied<br/>
with their lives is Michael Foglers Unjobbing. If Gabe is concerned about<br/>
making a living, have him try You Money Or Your Life, by Joe (?) Dominguez.<br/>
The voluntary simplicity and frugality movements (which have websites,<br/>
and meetings all over the country) are good places to look for information<br/>
on living well on less, and thus being able to work at what you love. Check<br/>
out the Tightwad Gazette books by Amy Dacyczyn (at least three volumes).<br/>
.             .<br/>
<br/>
But if Gabe wont be satisfied with anything less than an assurance that he<br/>
will be able to get into college if he does decide he wants to, there are<br/>
several books on how homeschoolers get in. One is Judy Gelners College<br/>
Admissions: A Guide for Homeschoolers. Another is And What About College?,<br/>
by David and Micki Colfax. (Three of the Colfax kids got into Harvard  the<br/>
parents have also written two other books, Homeschooling for Excellence and<br/>
Hard Times in Paradise.) Holt Associates has a pamphlet titled Life After<br/>
Homeschooling, excerpted from Growing Without Schooling.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like Gabe is already critical of the school system. Build on<br/>
this - suggest he read John Holts books, beginning either with How Children<br/>
Fail (revised edition only!) or with Instead Of Education. John had a very<br/>
straightforward, accessible style, and wrote about what really goes on in<br/>
the classroom every day (and in the latter book, about what can go on<br/>
outside of it).<br/>
<br/>
Some of the materials Im suggesting can be found by going to the Holt<br/>
Associates website at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holt/gws.com">http://www.holt/gws.com</a> . You may have to link from<br/>
there to F.U.N. Books, which is the company that recently bought out most of<br/>
the Holt Associates book business. (If you have trouble finding any of the<br/>
things Im recommending, please let me know because I recommend them all the<br/>
time.)<br/>
<br/>
Im just realizing that the most useful reference I can probably give you is<br/>
to the Grown Homeschoolers category in the 2002 Directory, which is<br/>
contained in the last issue of the (very recently defunct) magazine, Growing<br/>
Without Schooling. Ive just looked at it  there are about seventy names<br/>
listed, all of grown homeschoolers who are now in college, working, or<br/>
otherwise out in the world, and all with contact information and a brief<br/>
description of what theyre doing. They all agreed to be listed, in order to<br/>
answer questions and give advice. Again, go to the Holt Associates website<br/>
to order it.<br/>
<br/>
I love to brainstorm on possibilities for teens who are thinking about<br/>
leaving school. Unfortunately, the last two times I did this, nothing came<br/>
of it, as the kids were already 16, and in the end too worried about their<br/>
futures to make any big changes, rather than just going along with it for a<br/>
couple more years. One had parental support and the other didnt. With your<br/>
support, and at his relatively young age, theres absolutely no doubt in my<br/>
mind that if Gabe focuses on doing interesting things in the here and now,<br/>
the future will largely take care of itself.<br/>
<br/>
But you might ask him, since he seems very upset about it, just exactly what<br/>
he envisions when he thinks about what might happen to him if he didnt get<br/>
into college. Does he picture himself on the streets, begging? Or just stuck<br/>
in a boring or low-wage job? Or unable to hold his own in social situations<br/>
(marry the right girl, etc.)? Does the fact that you have custody, rather<br/>
than his parents, figure into it? Encourage him to be as specific as he can<br/>
in talking to you about his fears.<br/>
<br/>
He may be looking around at adults he knows and not wanting to end up like<br/>
them. Which adults are these? Maybe some of these unhappy or unfortunate<br/>
people actually have college degrees - and maybe the ones he assume do,<br/>
actually dont. Maybe Gabe is worried about you  the work you do or dont<br/>
do, how much you earn, whether you are happy or whether you can support him<br/>
and his brother. Its important to speak honestly about this.<br/>
<br/>
People tend to assume I have a college degree, but I dont (I left after<br/>
three years to work for Holt Associates, John Holts organization). Among<br/>
other things, Ive translated four books for major art book publishers;<br/>
proofread the Spanish in a fifth book; worked as an interpreter in the court<br/>
system in Spain; published a front-page article in the Education section of<br/>
what was then Spains largest newspaper (El Pais); been on TV and radio in<br/>
Spain (promoting unschooling); taught English to adults for nine years in<br/>
Spain; and been asked to interview for a job teaching Spanish in the grade<br/>
school I went to as a kid in NY (I turned this down, of course!) Ive also<br/>
been a naturalist-guide in a New York State Park (leading school groups<br/>
around, for one thing) and have taught workshops in solar oven construction<br/>
at that Park and at a City Park.<br/>
<br/>
Before all this, I traveled widely and had a lot of interesting experiences<br/>
involving alternative play therapy for kids under stress (London), organic<br/>
farming (Maine), rock climbing (France and Spain), spelunking (France), and<br/>
so on. Some of these things, I did while a teenager, when I should have<br/>
been in school, or as a young adult, when I should have been finishing up<br/>
my degree.<br/>
<br/>
The educational chronology is this: two years of normal high school; one<br/>
year with the Audubon Expedition Institute, which is a traveling school;<br/>
one year on my own at 16, though with occasional financial support from my<br/>
parents, doing weird things like the organic farming apprenticeship and<br/>
being a mothers helper, etc.; off to college at 17 through early<br/>
admissions. After the three years of college, I left and have hardly looked<br/>
back. (Im thirty-five now, and busy with our two-year-old son and writing a<br/>
book on attachment parenting.)<br/>
<br/>
I have known poverty, but it has never been because of the lack of a degree.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like Gabe might be at the age to do local volunteer work, if not<br/>
to spend long periods away from home. This will give him a lot more<br/>
confidence than completing any distance learning course (though if he did<br/>
want to consider enrolling somewhere, Id recommend Clonlaras extremely<br/>
flexible program, which can include as much volunteer work for grade<br/>
school/high school credit as you want).<br/>
<br/>
If youre in this area (New York City), Id be happy to talk with Gabe or<br/>
with you. If youre not, why dont you post your general location? With<br/>
several hundred people on this list, theres likely to be someone in your<br/>
area who could help. Actually, it just so happens that I have a couple free<br/>
phone cards I wouldnt mind using up, so if he wants to talk I could call<br/>
him, or I could call you. Sometimes it helps to have a real conversation,<br/>
not just an on-screen one. So email me your phone number and Ill call.<br/>
<br/>
You indicated that Gabe is interested in things, and is reading books he<br/>
loves. What things and books are these (if he doesnt mind your posting<br/>
this)? And what are the types of things hes definitely NOT interested in?<br/>
By thirteen a lot of kids have general leanings (hands-on, literary,<br/>
artistic, natural science, etc.), if not defined interests. I wouldnt<br/>
pressure him to specialize, but it helps to know a little more. Why dont<br/>
you hand over the messages youve gotten so far to Gabe and ask him whether<br/>
he wants to post his own? There is nothing that says this has to be an<br/>
adults-only forum.<br/>
<br/>
If you send me a mailing address, I can send you a copy of an article I<br/>
wrote for a nationwide teaching magazine when I was 12, titled A Student<br/>
Speaks Out (I was paid $200 for it  maybe this fact would inspire him to do<br/>
some writing of his own). Im much more radical now than I was then, of<br/>
course, but it could give Gabe another kids perspective.<br/>

Hi everyone,<br/>
I was wondering if maybe someone out there had advice regarding helping my<br/>
13 yr old brother relax and let learning happen.<br/>
I have custody of my two brothers, Gabe, 13, and Matt, 11. While they have<br/>

was so bored by my high school. It helped me to discover that college <br/>
level work was not that intimidating after all. I hope that if my kids <br/>
want to go to college, they&#39;ll take a few courses &quot;early&quot; if they find <br/>
an interest. <br/>
<br/>
I also really liked the suggestion of entering college later when you <br/>
have explored your ideas and options to decide if you even want college <br/>
classroom style learning. I see college as a tool to get specific <br/>
skills/diploma, or place to explore other topics in a college setting. <br/>
<br/>
Like you said some other careers come from practical experience and <br/>
apprenticships. <br/>
<br/>
The freedom can be overwhelming at first, after years of being in the <br/>
system, and being told what&#39;s best for them. It&#39;s great that your <br/>
brothers have you to help them on their way.<br/>

<br/>
My advice about the college fears is for him to think about what he <br/>
might like to study, and where. Then he can get the college catalog(s) <br/>
online, or at a library maybe, and research the actual requirements and <br/>
courses. He can talk to others who have careers in fields is interested <br/>
in, and ask them what they felt was important to prepare with. None of <br/>
this has to be a commitment to study a specific field forever, just <br/>
gathering ideas and information. If we don&#39;t know our choices we don&#39;t <br/>
have any.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever he&#39;s afraid of/concerned about can maybe be deflated with <br/>
research. Even the act of researching is empowering. Finding your own <br/>
answers. Taking action about something that bothers you. Problem <br/>
solving.<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the great work!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532636625">I have to say, I would discourage a curriculum.  If he understands that<br/>
he is bored with school, he would be bored with it too, I suspect.  I<br/>
have heard that the World Book Website has a good guideline, maybe he<br/>
scould use it for reference and it would make him feel better to have<br/>
verification that he isn&#39;t missing something.<br/>
<br/>
At 13, he could maybe start taking or auditing classes at some colleges. <br/>
Rachel is 16 and she will be going either in January of in September of<br/>
2002.  It&#39;s her choice, not mine.  My bigger problem with colleges these<br/>
days is that many of the professors and administrators don&#39;t seem to<br/>
understand that they are there to provide a service.  The students are<br/>
not there to provide their salaries.  So, if he chooses to research<br/>
colleges early, at least make him aware of that concern.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t list his interests, but if he is into some specific field,<br/>
help him find ways to explore it.<br/>

so well. And we can&#39;t ignore the fact that *some* people need the <br/>
validation of having a curriculum and/or enjoy *grades*.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of one of the founders of a Sudbury Model school in CA. An <br/>
Ivy League school graduate with years in the business world. He founded <br/>
the school for his son to attend. YET, he himself acknowledges the fact <br/>
that that kind of unschooling would not of worked for him.<br/>
<br/>
Its all about laying out as many choices that we can come up with, so <br/>
that sis can present them to brother. His opinion will decide what should <br/>
be discouraged or not.<br/>
<br/>
When a person hears/reads/sees something that *sings* to the depth of <br/>
their being - its right for them - and it will allay their fears.<br/>
<br/>
I thouroughly enjoyed Joyce&#39;s response, which pointed out many options, <br/>
especially the idea of  &quot;Help him think of this time not as time to <br/>
prepare for college and adulthood, but as time to explore who he is and <br/>
what he loves.&quot; (Joyce)<br/>

Recent example:  PS friend and her daughter attended a pre-college <br/>
visit-the-school thing.  The daughter thought she was headed for medicine.  <br/>
She&#39;s a junior in high school.  Now, though, after hearing more options <br/>
during the visit, she&#39;s thinking chemistry as a major.<br/>

From what I understand of this situation involving a child who felt <br/>
frustrated, was that he <br/>
*was* apparently &#39;raised&#39; in the public school system. You can&#39;t take a <br/>
person who *might* need the security of grades and rip it out from them <br/>
because they were in the wrong system many years ago.<br/>

If this child were unschooled and unparented *smile* for his entire life, <br/>
I HIGHLY doubt that this situation would be happening now.<br/>

Sure you can. It just takes lots of patience, freedom and encouragement. I certainly hope that the idea that a grade is needed can be re-taught to be that learning is needed.<br/>
Sometimes you have to rip the security blanket off and shake up life a bit. Drive to the store the long way around, go to a movie at a different theater, go to the library across town.<br/>
