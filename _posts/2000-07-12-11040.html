<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392139924">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i was wondering if anyone has heard anything about the group Council <br/>
for National Policy (CNP)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.berkshire.net/~ifas/cnp/index.ht">http://www.berkshire.net/~ifas/cnp/index.ht</a><br/>
ml  i just happened to run across this org in a book about media <br/>
censureship and it does not make me comfortable.  i&#39;ve never really <br/>
involved myself w/ politics so i thought someone else  could help me <br/>
get a broader understanding of what this group&#39;s impact might be on <br/>
our individual freedoms. <br/>
