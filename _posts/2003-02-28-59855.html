<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222489137"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;We have always had personality clashes, and it was a really hard decision <br/>
&gt;&gt;to bring her home from school when her going to school meant a break from <br/>
&gt;&gt;a defiant child. Isn&#39;t that awful? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s understandable in light of the relationship you used to have and the <br/>
parenting skills you had to work with at the time. That was then, this is <br/>
now. It&#39;s okay to forgive yourself and move up into this moment, where life <br/>
is unfolding.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am not trying to whine, but being around someone all day long who fights <br/>
&gt;&gt;me, would disagree the sky was blue just because mom said it...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>...is like being around a hormonal teenager, a feisty 3 year old, a PMS mom? <br/>
;-) I DO understand and am not trying to dismiss your feelings. But you&#39;ve <br/>
got to remember that it&#39;s really not so much about you as it is about your <br/>
daughter. It&#39;s about where she is and her moods and her natural disposition.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;gets emotional and blames me for all her problems,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would be open to what seem to be reasonable complaints and let the rest <br/>
just flow on by.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;says she hates homeschooling just to try to hurt me&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah. Maybe she does hate homeschooling right now, but I&#39;d suspect she&#39;s <br/>
trying to get a reaction or venting, not trying to hurt you. It&#39;s not about <br/>
you. It&#39;s about your daughter reacting to something new and different. <br/>
Change is hard, even a change for the better. She sounds like she just needs <br/>
more room than most to figure it all out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I subject myself to this daily for a kid who doesn&#39;t appreciate it!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard sometimes, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to expect kids to <br/>
show appreciation for our parenting. For them, it&#39;s just life. They don&#39;t <br/>
have the awful parenting we know about to compare it to. I think it&#39;s a good <br/>
thing that they take our goodness for granted sometimes. It means we <br/>
preparing them to expect goodness.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I told her yesterday after she screamed she hated me, that I am not the <br/>
&gt;&gt;perfect parent, I make mistakes, and I don&#39;t think she will ever meet <br/>
&gt;&gt;someone who loves her more and will try harder to learn and change for the <br/>
&gt;&gt;better.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm...that kind of limits her expectations for relationships in the future <br/>
don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;She exhausts me, to say the least.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take it day by day and moment by moment. Try to focus on the parts of her <br/>
that you like right now. Keep that as your focus.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We have two younger children and I feel guilty that I can&#39;t be more for <br/>
&gt;&gt;her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guilt is a useless emotion. It does nothing to move us towards a better <br/>
life. Do what you can, live each moment as you are able. Be your best self. <br/>
It&#39;s all we can ask of anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

parts that don&#39;t feel too good :0)<br/>
