<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883082322">Okay. I&#39;ve read all the posts and have made a decision.<br/>
<br/>
Ned has been a major disruption on this list for about a month now, <br/>
and he shows no signs of listening to anyone&#39;s pleas to stop being <br/>
disruptive. He seems quite content in his role, so I&#39;m going to ban <br/>
him from posting to this list for a while. He can read posts, but he <br/>
won&#39;t be able to post replies. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll go off now and tell <br/>
anyone who&#39;ll listen on other lists about how controlling and <br/>
coercive and manipulative and unfair I&#39;m being, but so be it.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to discuss this decision with me my address is <br/>
