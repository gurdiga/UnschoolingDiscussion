<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447751965">Resending this because my mail seems to be messed up. Hope I&#39;m not <br/>
cloging your boxes. :) <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.... First- yes, food for thought, I might have gone about it <br/>
wrong- true. But, I don&#39;t think you understood-she&#39;s the OLDEST and <br/>
she didn&#39;t pay ME, she paid her brothers. THe reason I choose the <br/>
money route is because she cares about money. Her brothers DO give <br/>
her their toys- but, thinking they will be returned within their <br/>
lifetime.. When I give them their toys back, it&#39;s like Christmas to <br/>
them! At any rate- yes, I will sit all three of them down, and if <br/>
they say they do not mind- END IT- I will!! :) No hard feelings <br/>
about what you said... THat&#39;s kinda why I wrote it- to get other&#39;s <br/>
opinion if I was going at it right or what... :) Thanks, Pam <br/>

<br/>
Ok, at the risk of upsetting someone else, this sounds pretty <br/>
disturbing <br/>
to me. I also have questions about the brother&#39;s reactions. Do they <br/>
care? Do they feel as though they are being manipulative? Does it <br/>
really matter if she&#39;s playing with them? It&#39;s hard to be the <br/>
youngest, <br/>
maybe she perceives they have all the good toys. If the two boys are <br/>
OK <br/>
with her coaxing the toys away, then it might be a game the kids <br/>
play <br/>
together. At any rate, I think that I might sit down with the three <br/>
kids together and have a conversation about how this concerns you. <br/>
If <br/>
the three kids are all OK with the situation, then you have <br/>
expressed <br/>
your concerns and that should be the end of it. If the boys don&#39;t <br/>
like <br/>
it, then everyone needs to talk about how to deal with it <br/>
differently. <br/>
But I don&#39;t think making her pay you (they aren&#39;t YOUR toys) is <br/>
anything <br/>
but coercive. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416239936">She&#39;s fine with giving the toys back. I had her pay the fine because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nice to &quot;borrow&quot; something and never return it.. I say borrow- because when her brothers give her things, they do want it back.......... SOMETIME....... I guess it just irritates me because we&#39;ll buy toys and they just don&#39;t seem like they&#39;re getting played with.. to shove them in the closet in the box to be forgotten. Pretty lame of me, I guess..<br/>
 Anyways, I&#39;ve dropped it with them. I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll just treat it like most other disagreements they have--- When they come to me, telling me so and so did this or that to them... I say well, go tell that person how you feel! Tell him/her that, that hurt you or you didn&#39;t like that.. ect. That usually works good. Another thing, when they fight, sometimes I have them hold hands until THEY can work it out. I DO want them to know how to figure things out on their own, ya know? I&#39;m not trying to be lazy- I just think that that is a good skill to have. To be able to work out the wrong in a relationship- and to tell others how you feel, instead of telling everyone EXCEPT that person who caused those feelings. I don&#39;t want them to feel like they have to hold things in. As long as they say how they feel in a decent way- there&#39;s ways of telling someone they hurt you w/o hurting them back. It always ends up with them laughing and then they go off and play! :)<br/>

I only buy Jayn toys she specifically asks for - she&#39;s seen them on TV or in<br/>
catalogues, or sometimes we just troll around the toy store. Sometimes she<br/>
says something like &quot;I wish there was a such-and-such figure&quot; (eg Princess<br/>
Fiona from Shrek) and we look around for one. My experience has been that<br/>
Jayn doesn&#39;t play much with toys or instruments that she hasn&#39;t asked for.<br/>
Once exception - the Sit and Spin she was given for x&#39;mas one year.<br/>
