<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371608137">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
So many of you out there have XBoxes, Playstations and whatnot that I thought you&#39;d be a good resource for this question.  What is the best unit to get?  I&#39;m thinking of getting one for DH for Father&#39;s Day, but it would really be for the whole family.  I don&#39;t know what makes one better than another or pretty much anything about them.  Input would be greatly appriciated.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if this is enough info to help you decide or not, but we picked <br/>
PS2 because it plays DVDs as well as the games. For us it was a two-in-one <br/>
thing. (BTW, it plays PS AND PS2 Games!)   Lara..........</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403408532">X-Box plays DVDs also with a $24 accessory, as well as music CDs.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this very question was asked sometime last year. The answer<br/>
boiled down to that it depends on what your priority is. I gather that<br/>
PS has the greater number of games, but the X-Box has the capacity for<br/>
higher quality of visuals, and can do a High Definition output. My DH<br/>
plays a lot of X-box live games on the internet and uses his unit as a<br/>
server for other people.<br/>
<br/>
If you do get the X-Box it is very worthwhile to also get a subscription<br/>
to X-Box Magazine. They send playable samples and demos of games with<br/>
each monthly issue, and it is a great resource for deciding which games<br/>
to buy or rent. I enjoy reading the comprehensive reviews of games, even<br/>
though I rarely try the machine. Jayn has just gotten the Finding Nemo<br/>
game, and we got her a small sized controller for her little 3 ½ year<br/>
old hands. She calls it Mighty Emo.<br/>

Well, we just bought a Nintendo Game Cube for Alex&#39;s birthday, more games for <br/>
his age group than the PS2, I thought.  Btw, he&#39;s nine.  Then my BIL bought <br/>
him Zurok, a bloody shooter game that my husband plays more than Alex does, <br/>
hehehe.  <br/>
<br/>
The PS2 plays DVD&#39;s which is cool, so you if you don&#39;t have a DVD player that <br/>
might make it worth the buy.<br/>
<br/>
I would look at the games at the store, and see which system has more games <br/>
your family would enjoy.  Nintendo Game Cube has all the Mario games, which <br/>
Alex loves.  Alot of the games are made for all systems, btw, and then some are <br/>
exclusive.  We&#39;re a big gaming family, so I&#39;m sure eventually we&#39;ll get the PS2 <br/>
as well, but the Game Cube was cheaper.  Keep in mind you&#39;ve gotta buy <br/>
controllers, memory cards, and most of the games are $50( some of the Game Cube ones <br/>
are down to $30), just to play that system you just bought!  <br/>

So far it seems to be a great system. Playstation has more games. I think a <br/>
lot has to do with what games the kids and DH like. The second DVD player <br/>
worked out well for us.  We buy lots of our games on Ebay and Half.com so when you <br/>
do decide that&#39;s a good place to get xtra games.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-316330212">We decided on the game cube because all the mario games and many &quot;kid&quot; type<br/>
games are more available for it.  Our kids are 7, 2 and not due until<br/>
August.  We figured since they would be spending the most time on them, best<br/>
to get the most &quot;kid friendly&quot; system.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to use, you can get used games easily and it&#39;s tiny.  I think it&#39;s<br/>
been a big success here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612373449">This thread is a bit old now, but thanks to all who responded.  We ended up getting a Playstation2.  I invited dh along for the shopping so he could help pick out what we wanted for sure.  We&#39;ve been having a lot of fun with it.  Davan&#39;s mostly just enjoyed watching.  She says it&#39;s like a movie.  She has played a bit, but mostly not.<br/>
<br/>
So, thanks for all the input!<br/>
