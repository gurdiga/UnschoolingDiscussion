<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633513748">Lisps are quite common until about 7 or so.  Dh went to speech therapy when<br/>
he was little because of a lisp.  It consisted of practicing tongue twisters<br/>
full of &quot;s&quot; sounds.  You could probably do it at home if it became a<br/>
problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Mine is 5.5 and has trouble with &#39;r&#39; and sometimes &#39;th&#39;. It&#39;s much improved over just a year ago however and I can sometimes catch her sounding things out on her own, when she thinks no one is listening, trying to get the words right. I&#39;m not worried (most of the time anyway). We&#39;ve all made the effort to understand her and if outsiders find it hard I&#39;m usually there to help out. It just takes some a little longer to work it out. Your child doesn&#39;t have a teacher that needs to understand her or a room of kids who might tease her so why bother now?<br/>

Jayn is 4. She has a bit of a lisp, and also says �w� instead of �L� a lot<br/>
of the time. Nothing would induce me to send her speech therapy. I�m<br/>
convinced it is a non-problem that she will grow out of and then we will<br/>
miss her endearing �I wuv you�. In fact it is clearly better than it was<br/>
even just a few months ago. Is Grace being asked stupid �quizzing� questions<br/>
by the adults? Jayn always clams up in that kind of situation. We always<br/>
tell people she won�t be a performing monkey. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think you may have plenty of time to seek speech therapy if she<br/>
lets you know she is very unhappy with her own progress. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109246901">My oldest is currently in speech therapy under an IEP with the local school. We&#39;re trying to get out of it. She has a mild articulation problem, and an unusual prosody, but I&#39;ve come to realize that neither of these keeps her from communicating effectively with anyone, nor interferes with her forming friendships with people of various ages. So I no longer see her delay or prosody as a problem needing fixing. It&#39;s just the way she is. As it so happens, Sarah is interested in the theater and plans to take classes at the local Junior Theatre next year if we&#39;re still here (or we&#39;ll find one when we move). Having been there, I think she&#39;ll learn more about speaking well and clearly from those activities and through her participation in AWANAs where she&#39;s speaking in front of strangers than sitting in a little room once a week for 45 minutes saying certain sounds over and over. <br/>
 <br/>
If it&#39;s not affecting her relationships with others, or keeping her from communicating clearly, I&#39;d just maybe at most work with her at home if it bothers her. <br/>
 <br/>
Good luck whatever your choice!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4576377">Max is 5.5 and still has problems with a good portion of his sounds.  S, Th, R, F, L...etc.  He&#39;s getting better with age and recently we went to the zoo and he said &quot;I love the ZZZZooo.&quot;  The z sound vibrated.<br/>
<br/>
My husband had a problem with stuttering until his mom took him out of school in the 3rd grade.<br/>

I really think most kids with will outgrow it unless there is a physical deformity in the mouth.  <br/>

DD also had trouble with TH until she was 5.5.  <br/>

Give her some time and don&#39;t put too much pressure on her to &quot;do it right&quot;...that may make her more conscious of it.<br/>

<br/>
And keep in mind that in school 1) the school would be putting pressure on <br/>
her to &quot;do it right&quot; and 2) peers in school might &quot;encourage&quot; her (in a bad way) <br/>
to change sooner.<br/>
<br/>
In her own time, she&#39;ll &quot;hear&quot; the differences and make the changes herself, <br/>
with no damage to her Self. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d second this.  I&#39;m a lurker and only post occasionally on the message <br/>
boards.  I&#39;m also a speech therapist. Speech sounds are developmental.  The th, l, <br/>
s, and r  are most commonly  misarticulated.  It is not unusual for the s and <br/>
r to be distorted until even 7 or 8.    Speech therapy will help those sounds <br/>
come in by that time also!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Unless, a child&#39;s speech is unintelligible and causing a great deal of <br/>
frustration for the child  (not the parent) I would just wait awhile.  Enjoy their <br/>
speech as it develops and it won&#39;t be long until you will be missing that lisp <br/>
or their cute way of saying &quot;Mr. Piss&quot; instead of&quot;Mr. Smith.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not good for my business of course....but really the best thing for your <br/>
child.<br/>

<br/>
The difference (besides the possible expense and the definite time <br/>
involvement) is that with speech therapy, you tell the child there&#39;s something wrong <br/>
with her.   How much money and time would it be worth if a child who has been <br/>
assured she&#39;s faulty could feel whole?<br/>
<br/>
Keep them as whole as you can from the beginning and other things will go <br/>
better down the line.<br/>

<br/>
DON&#39;T DO IT!  RUN AWAY! lol<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, it created more trauma for my son (at the time <br/>
5yo) than not being understood.  He believed something was &#39;wrong&#39; <br/>
with him, that he needed to be &#39;fixed&#39; by this lady.  He went for 2 <br/>
years.  Yeah, she helped all right.  I found out later that when he <br/>
didn&#39;t say things right she would bop him on his head with her book!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 12 and speaks fine now.<br/>
<br/>
With my youngest son, we have been doing speech therapy in our home, <br/>
and once I ironed out the troubles I had with the therapist&#39;s <br/>
methods, things have been much smoother.  I had to explain to her I <br/>
didn&#39;t want her to teach him to read while doing therapy, that I had <br/>
a specific way I wanted to teach him (ha ha ha) and that I would <br/>
rather she use picture clues and games rather than phonics cards.She <br/>
was disinclined to acquiesce to my request, until I pointed out that <br/>
*I* was paying her, not the other way around.  (BTW, it was $2K for <br/>
in-home speech therapy for one year)<br/>
<br/>
Still, I would suggest that {if your child} is frustrated by her <br/>
lisp and {if your child} wants to do something about it, go online <br/>
to www.nathhan.com and order their homeschool speech therapy program <br/>
called Straight Talk.   I think it is like $45 or something for the <br/>
complete program...much more doable than $2,000!!<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I suggest that one is that you are in charge of the <br/>
whole thing.  When your daughter is bored or tired or not <br/>
interested, you don&#39;t have to do anything.  When she wants to do it, <br/>
you can.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I have learned about this program, I have ordered it but it <br/>
has not come yet.  If I find it will work with my son, and he is <br/>
interested, we&#39;ll do that instead of having the speech therapist <br/>
come.  After a year of watching her work with him, though, I could <br/>
easily just use the same games and techniques myself with him <br/>
without any program at all.  Hmmm....now THERE&#39;S a thought!<br/>
