First, the director isn&#39;t a jerk, lol.  She is really nice and though I<br/>
don&#39;t know her well, I know her well enough to know that she has reasons for<br/>
what she did(whether I would agree with them or not would be a matter of<br/>
discussions)<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about talking to her, but I am worried that if I talk to her<br/>
she will think that we are complaining.  I don&#39;t want to be seen as a<br/>
complainer, and I don&#39;t want my daughter to think that we can always<br/>
complain about things and get them changed.  Do you know what I am saying?<br/>
I have also thought about emailing the director, and starting out by saying<br/>
that I don&#39;t want her to just give my daughter the part, but do want to know<br/>
what we could have done differently.  But still I was worried that this<br/>
would be perceived as complaining.  (I have been the director of bible<br/>
classes and VBS and have had to deal a lot with difficult parents.  I do not<br/>
want to be one of them, lol.)  So, I don&#39;t know . . .<br/>
