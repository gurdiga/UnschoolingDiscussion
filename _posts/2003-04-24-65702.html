<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839523201"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;Just wondering if any of you had a late talker and how things turned out! <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m reminded of the story of the child who was six years old and never spoke. <br/>
The parents worried all the time, and thought something must be very wrong. <br/>
One morning at breakfast, he suddenly said, &quot;Mom, these eggs are cold and <br/>
rubbery. Could you make another batch for me, please?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The mother was astonished, and said, &quot;You can talk!!!  Why haven&#39;t you <br/>
before?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He shrugged and replied, &quot;Everything&#39;s been okay up to now.&quot;<br/>
