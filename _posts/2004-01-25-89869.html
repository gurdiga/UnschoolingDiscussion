<div id="ygrps-yiv-516496153">But before that question, I just wanted to add (regarding the praise <br/>
question) that sometimes I only say, &quot;Those lines are interesting,&quot; because <br/>
all that is on the paper IS lines.  And lots of them.  lol<br/>
<br/>
But on to my cleaning room question.  Again, my children are ages 3 and 4.  <br/>
I want to know what you guys do when it comes to keeping your children&#39;s <br/>
room clean (and the rest of the house of their toys).  It seems that my <br/>
children can produce a mess (to them it is all exploration and play, of <br/>
course) within about 10 minutes time.  For example, they love their closet.  <br/>
Sometimes if left alone in their room, they will completely dismantle the <br/>
entire thing, taking all their clothes off the hangers so they have a monkey <br/>
bar, taking apart boxes to make ladders, etc.  Honestly, I am (almost - ha) <br/>
always really happy to see them happy and having fun making their closet <br/>
into some great land of monkeys.  However, when the game is over, what is <br/>
left is this disastorous closet.  (I have explained that they can move their <br/>
clothes over to make room for the monkey bar, and that they can ask me to <br/>
help them make a ladder, etc).  What my question is, is that when kids DO <br/>
make a mess, do you guys feel it is important to &quot;make&quot; them help you clean <br/>
it up with you?  Or do you just clean it up yourself in good nature?  I know <br/>
all about making cleaning fun, etc., but what if they both say, &quot;no, we are <br/>
going to go play,&quot; and the job is left to you?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what about the overall standards of their bedrooms?  I know rotten <br/>
food is one thing that HAS to be dealt with, but other than that do you just <br/>
let them keep their rooms in the state they want to keep them in?  I would <br/>
not think about it if my children were older, because I would know they had <br/>
the ability to clean their room if they wanted to.  But I am not really sure <br/>
at what point I should just stop cleaning their room and let them handle it? <br/>
  Right now I usually clean their room everyday and don&#39;t expect them to <br/>
help me.  Or should I?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I am rambling here, but I am sure you get my point.  From reading the <br/>
past threads, I have gotten the sense that most of you tend to just let your <br/>
kids pitch in when they want to, and that tends to happen when they reach an <br/>
older age...?<br/>
<br/>
All advice is greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Why not just give over? Put their clothes in your closet or another one? I moved my daughter&#39;s dresser into our room because she always emptied it onto her floor. She still gets clothes from our room but doesn&#39;t create the same mess. If there&#39;s always a mess that&#39;s an indication it&#39;s not working so make their closet into what they want and find room for what&#39;s there now in some other place.<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Then I ask them to do it when they&#39;re done or do it myself. It&#39;s their room and if the mess isn&#39;t their top priority you guys can negotiate a better time. If not, If it&#39;s your priority then I&#39;d say you do it. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Work to avoid the messes. My daughter&#39;s (now my son&#39;s as well) is really too small for too much so that was creating horrible messes. I moved out most of the toys to a part of the living room, made sure they were well organized with their own containers (the key to messes for me is always make sure there&#39;s a spot for everything, a basic organization beneath the mess so even if the house is a disaster I&#39;ve got a starting point and it doesn&#39;t take that long to clean). Now my daughter has books, a spring horse, CD player and a change table with CD&#39;s and cassettes in the drawer and stuffed animals filling it up. And that&#39;s it besides the bunk beds (wonderful purchase, for $150C online at Ikea my daughter has a private play area that her brother can&#39;t get to...and I never have to notice the never made bed). They play in the living room. <br/>
<br/>
  Ok, I think I&#39;ll share my newly thought of philosophy of housework here. It started when my sister was over and chasing the kids around. I was straightening up the livingroom and had just finished piling up blocks (Big cardboard ones. We have, in all, 10 or eleven different kinds of wood, plastic and cardboard blocks. I feel so wealthy. :) ) when my son (2) ran into the room, saw the blocks and immediatly tore down the pile. I smiled and shook my head. My sister, who&#39;d arrived in time to see this, sternly said, &quot;Harry! Your mother just finished putting those away!&quot; When she said that I felt offended. Didn&#39;t she know I only pile those blocks so that Harry can knock them down? And there was the Aha! I looked around the room at the clean living room and realized that was why I did any cleaning. <br/>
      We don&#39;t clean up messes to have a clean house. We clean up messes so there is room for more mess!<br/>
      Now I think of cleaning up after my kids as replacing a canvas. I do it with the thought that by giving them room again and a bare floor and organized toys to pick from I&#39;m handing them the tools to write another mess onto our house. It&#39;s meant that at the end of a day, or sometimes a few days in a row, I just let the mess stay, because really, it&#39;s a work of art or a story. Maybe it isn&#39;t finished. Maybe it&#39;s too interesting to be gotten rid of so soon. It also clears up my feelings of resentment about doing the bulk of it. I like being the one to reset the house so that we all can live another, different mess the next day.<br/>
      Anyway, thought I&#39;d share since it&#39;s really helped me bring more joy into the housework!<br/>

boys would love that.  A smaller one that would fit the length of their room.  <br/>
ladders on each end and a support in the middle.  I bet we could make that.  Oh <br/>
the boys will go crazy when I mention that idea.  Thanks for the idea.<br/>

will help me tremendously!!  <br/>

Clean canvas..... My son does have more bursts of<br/>
creativity when his stuff is organized,  but I have<br/>
been getting a tad resentful lately. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me get to that different<br/>
perspective I KNEW I needed, but couldn&#39;t quite get to<br/>
on my own! <br/>

Part of teaching art or cooking (or anything messy) is cleaning up before the <br/>
next session.  Even if other participants help (or are made to) clean, it&#39;s <br/>
really the responsibility of the teacher to prepare the area for the next <br/>
session.<br/>
<br/>
And when a parent chooses to homeschool, it doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable to me <br/>
for part of that duty to involve making sure kids have opportunities, and part <br/>
of opportunity is space, equipment, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I straighten up around video games sometimes, even if I hadn&#39;t played and am <br/>
not going to.  I&#39;ll straight out cords, roll up unused extra controllers, <br/>
re-file games, dust things off.  I could &quot;make them&quot; but they&#39;re probably off <br/>
doing something else that involves learning and being happy, and so I do it as a <br/>
secret gift to them because I love them and I&#39;m glad I&#39;m home.<br/>

Yes, I do this. My dd is 4, and we all share the one bedroom, as well as the<br/>
living room of the apartment.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn sometimes helps, but her real love is scrubbing the kitchen surfaces.<br/>
