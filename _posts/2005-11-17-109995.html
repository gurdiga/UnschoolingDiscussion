The lastest Geographic has a feature about longevity. <br/>
 <br/>
There ARE some similarities between populations who tend to live a long  <br/>
time--some Okinawans, some Seventh-Day Adventists, etc., all had  <br/>
similarities...but they had really divergent lifestyles and cultures.<br/>
 <br/>
One of the things I thought was most interesting is that they all had very,  <br/>
very active social lives.  They were out of the house every day or they had  <br/>
people in every single day.  <br/>
 <br/>
My grandmother just turned 100 and Charles&#39; Aunt Susie did, too, both in  the <br/>
same week.  Maw is in the nursing home, and while she&#39;s not exactly a  <br/>
vegetable, she doesn&#39;t know anyone.  She came to her party at a far away  church.  <br/>
She can still meet her own needs with help, and has very distinct  ideas about <br/>
what her needs are and makes them known.  <br/>
 <br/>
Aunt Susie on the other hand, still lives in her home, by herself, and has  a <br/>
garden where she tends her collards.  I have a picture of her on my  fridge, <br/>
out there with her walker, watering the collards and something else,  <br/>
tomatoes, maybe.  The garden is gorgeous and lush, but she lives in Florida  so that <br/>
helps.  Aunt Susie dips snuff and chews tobacco.  In fact,  Beechnut sent her a <br/>
year&#39;s supply of chewing tobacco when they heard about her  100th birthday!  <br/>
(I think that&#39;s just gross, but she&#39;s from another  time.)   She remembered <br/>
almost *everyone* at her birthday party, and  lots of us flew in from many <br/>
states to attend.  She has a wicked sense of  humor and is always the life of the <br/>
party.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think you can ever tell what leads to longevity or not.   Everyone&#39;s <br/>
circumstances are different.<br/>

Hi Karen!<br/>
<br/>
I was going to mention this article, but you beat me to it. What stood <br/>
out to me was that one of the key habits they said all groups studied <br/>
had was &quot;put[ting] family first.&quot; I think as unschoolers we do a <br/>
pretty good job at that one, huh? Maybe we will all live into our 100s <br/>
and they&#39;ll be studying unschoolers (or at least trying to) to figure <br/>
out our secrets someday!&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823703102">I don&#39;t think I realized anybody cooked meat outside of a cast iron skillet or used an oven for anything but biscuits and pie until I was a teenager. Except for when grandma made homemade chicken and noodles, but there was nothing low fat about those, just delicious.:0) My grandparents did garden and can some, more on a hobby type basis though.  They would make a relish or a jam just because they liked it better than what they could buy.  Some of my relatives smoked, some didn&#39;t.  They all lived into their 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s anyway, but the ones who didn&#39;t smoke did seem to be healthier and more active.<br/>
   <br/>
  My mother still eats spam:0)  It&#39;s one of her favorite meals, spam, eggs and biscutis.  I never buy it, had too much of it as a kid.<br/>
  One interesting thing, they all ate the same stuff, none were obese, some were a bit heavier than others, but weight was of no particular issue.  None of them lived on farms or did farm work.  Conventional wisdom says they should have died young or fat, but they didn&#39;t.  <br/>
  The main difference I notice is portions today are different.  I have my grandparents&#39; juice glasses, and they are quite small.  The bowls and saucers in the set of dishes I have are smaller than what you would get if you bought new ones.  I&#39;ve often thought that these smaller dishers did cause them to eat less at a time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243564089">Then you&#39;re lucky and have a set of genes in the family which <br/>
probably mean you can eat things like saturated fat and not have any <br/>
problems. Most people don&#39;t have those genes.<br/>
<br/>
 Some have ones that make them prone to things. Most of my partner&#39;s <br/>
family were dead before 60. His dad has just had a bypass. My <br/>
partner has to watch his cholesterol now and make sure he has plenty <br/>
of exercise etc<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother died in her 70s but for a long time her quality of <br/>
life was not good as she had been a smoker.  My aunty ( died at age <br/>
63 from lung cancer, my cousin died at age 40 from lung cancer. Mu <br/>
ucnle died of brain tumour,he didn&#39;t smoke but he breathed their <br/>
smoke for years and years. My grandfather although he had a long <br/>
life died from cancer of the oesophagus and lung caused by smoking. <br/>
Non of them but my aunty and cousin were related by blood as there <br/>
are stepfamilies and adoptions in my family.<br/>
<br/>
 My ex husband&#39;s grandmother died of cancer of the bronchials (can&#39;t <br/>
remember the right term) caused by smoking.  His dad literally <br/>
dropped dead at home from a massive coronary at age 56, he smoked <br/>
and ate too much saturated and trans fat. My stepfather has liver <br/>
disease and a cancer called Waldenstrom&#39;s macroglobulin anaemia. He <br/>
drank too much and smoked,he didn&#39;t even make retirement he had to <br/>
be retired on health grounds.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who can get away with smoking, drinking and living <br/>
on lard, same as some people get away with not maintaining the <br/>
brakes on their car, but most people are not or will not be so lucky.<br/>
<br/>
There are exceptions to the rule but I firmly believe that a healthy <br/>
diet and not smoking is best for most people. That doesn&#39;t mean a <br/>
little of what you fancy now and again is a bad thing. I like the <br/>
ocassional icecream, pizza, cheese, chocolate or cake. I don&#39;t eat <br/>
them all the time though.<br/>
<br/>
My cousin was dead at 40 from lung cancer. I gave up smoking, I&#39;m <br/>
glad I did. I&#39;m now 41, I wish my cousin was still here. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716735167">The following rant is not personal, just about the whole overall topic of how <br/>
much we can control life, health and death:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-Some have ones that make them prone to things. Most of my partner&#39;s<br/>
&gt; family were dead before 60. His dad has just had a bypass.-==-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So is it possibly more likely that nothing one eats or does will overcome <br/>
genetics?<br/>
<br/>
My whole life, doctors have said that being hopeful and happy and less <br/>
stressed is good for health, and yet there is more stress and unhappiness over diet <br/>
in some people&#39;s lives than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all heard stories of or seen ourselves some mom shrilly and in a panic <br/>
snatch a lollipop out of a kid&#39;s hand or mouth with an expression of imminent <br/>
death that might should be saved for rattlesnakes and explosives.   I <br/>
personally think that does the child more damage (and the mom too) than half a dozen <br/>
lollipops.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My grandmother died in her 70s but for a long time her quality of<br/>
life was not good as she had been a smoker.-=-<br/>
<br/>
WHY is long life better?   How many people in nursing homes might rather be <br/>
healthy, or dead, but not sickly and warehoused?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Mu ucnle died of brain tumour,he didn&#39;t smoke but he breathed their<br/>
smoke for years and years.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think smoke causes brain tumors?   I don&#39;t think so, or the days when <br/>
people had indoor fires as their only sources of heat and cooking would&#39;ve <br/>
been braintumor seasons for sure.<br/>
<br/>
-=- His dad literally dropped dead at home from a massive coronary at age 56, <br/>
he smoked<br/>
and ate too much saturated and trans fat.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Or lived with too much stress and negativity from relatives telling him not <br/>
to smoke and to eat better.    Shame and guilt aren&#39;t health-food or <br/>
health-air.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There are people who can get away with smoking, drinking and living<br/>
on lard, same as some people get away with not maintaining the<br/>
brakes on their car, but most people are not or will not be so lucky.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And if luck is a factor, then dispensing with some of the tone of &quot;I KNOW <br/>
EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO&quot; would be better for all involved, I think.    If it <br/>
is possible for someone to know exactly what another person should <br/>
think/do/ingest/know, then unschooling does have it wrong.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I like the<br/>
ocassional icecream, pizza, cheese, chocolate or cake. I don&#39;t eat<br/>
them all the time though.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nor does anyone do anything all the time.   And the less pressure or <br/>
deprivation, the less likely they are to crave something, as so many of us have seen <br/>
with TV and foods and even, from nursing on demand days, to crave breastfeeding <br/>
or time with mom.   It&#39;s the kids who are told no who want it, want it, want <br/>
it.   From Freud days it&#39;s been shown that those who didn&#39;t get enough of <br/>
something might spend the rest of their lives in pursuit of that thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There are exceptions to the rule but I firmly believe that a healthy<br/>
diet and not smoking is best for most people.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;best&quot; for ALL people, but it&#39;s only one factor of many, and in some <br/>
people it might not even be a significant factor.    Those who die in car wrecks <br/>
or are hit by trains or are in airplanes that somehow suddenly fail to be in <br/>
the sky---It Did Not MATTER at that point what they ate, or smoked or thought.<br/>
<br/>
Health food concerns can become the most horrible part of some people&#39;s <br/>
lives, I&#39;m absolutely sure.   They can obsess about molecules to the point that <br/>
they&#39;re living in a frightening twilight world of nightmare and ignorance.    <br/>
<br/>
Balance is better than imagined purity, especially if the imagined purity <br/>
comes with enough stress to choke a horse.<br/>

You can prevent quite a lot of damage even in the susceptible by <br/>
having a sensible diet. His diet was awful, with far too much salt, <br/>

I did not say anything about becoming obsessed by diet? I think <br/>
people who become obsessed by diet are going to get obsessed about <br/>
something whether it&#39;s diet or something else. The problem isn&#39;t <br/>
diet it&#39;s their psychology.<br/>

lung is still a problem in some societies,it aint nice. The life <br/>

done either. I think there is a connection between breathing or <br/>
consuming carcinogens over a long period of time and getting cancer.<br/>

unschooling does have it wrong.<br/>

information about diet is important. Witholding information about <br/>
probable diet and lifestyle effects is as bad as trying to control <br/>
diet. <br/>
<br/>
I am not advocating people going overboard, obsessions are <br/>
psychological problems.  if someone is obsessed by diet then they <br/>
have a problem.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the same as saying..don&#39;t maintain the brakes on your car as <br/>
you might get run over, hit by a bus etc so then it won&#39;t matter if <br/>
you never maintained your brakes. So go ahead and let your brakes <br/>
fall apart. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Health food concerns can become the most horrible part of some <br/>

twilight world of nightmare and ignorance.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a bit like blaming movies, music or TV for &#39;making&#39; kids go <br/>
out and kill people. Information itself can&#39;t harm it&#39;s how people <br/>
take it on board. Dont shoot the messenger! <br/>
<br/>
I never advocated &#39;health&#39; foods anyway it&#39;s just another industry <br/>
making a living out of gullible people.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Balance is better than imagined purity, especially if the imagined <br/>
&gt;purity &gt; comes with enough stress to choke a horse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again the stress and ideas of purity are from within their own <br/>
heads. It is their ideas that make the difference and no sensible <br/>
information about diet is going to make a bit of difference to them <br/>
as they are obsessive and beyond reason.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Balance is better than imagined purity, especially if the imagined <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sandra<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. I didn&#39;t say a word about purity. A balanced healthy diet <br/>
is a good thing with plenty of fruit and veggies. It doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
be organic. Organic is better for the environment but there&#39;s only a <br/>
small amount of studies done that say it is a small amount healthier <br/>
as it &#39;can&#39; contain more nutrients. <br/>
<br/>
The main thing it appears is a balanced healthy diet and that can <br/>
include some junk food, sugar, salt, pizza and cake. It can also be <br/>
very cheap, conventional and you don&#39;t have to go anywhere near a <br/>
health food shop ever if you don&#39;t want.<br/>

life are not as powerful as they think.   <br/>
<br/>
This comes right back to the whole unschooling and choices area, though.   <br/>
<br/>
If a mom says &quot;TV is bad because before TV people read books, and books are <br/>
good,&quot; she is simplifying the world AND villifying something that is no more <br/>
good or bad than the books are.   And so what she will do is to prevent her <br/>
children from choosing books OR TV without an added coating of how it will make <br/>
mom feel, and a glaze of guilt about having chosen the BAD thing.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;There is good food that will extend your life and save the <br/>
planet, and then there is crap and junk,&quot; that doesn&#39;t help children decide, <br/>
and it injects too much of mom and too much guilt.<br/>
<br/>
If these things are true, that one is clearly and absolutely better than the <br/>
other, then a child free to choose should naturally gravitate toward the <br/>
clearly better thing.<br/>
<br/>
Moms who declare some books and activities and TV shows educationa and others <br/>
&quot;crap&quot; are going to lose out on a joyful relationship with their children, <br/>
AND they will embue those programs, books and activities with guilt and <br/>
antagonism and fear and doubt when they would otherwise have been just plain open <br/>
choices, and the child would have chosen good things instead of choosing what mom <br/>
says, or against what mom says, or being sneaky because of what mom *will* <br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I have been eating<br/>
everything conventional. I personally feel better when<br/>
I eat a certain way. That is my two cents .-=-<br/>
<br/>
I feel better when I feel better.<br/>
Food alone doesn&#39;t make or break life.<br/>
Fear of foods probably could; fear can make or break life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489062198">Right at the top of my post I said it wasn&#39;t personal, it was about the <br/>
topic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; yet there is more stress and<br/>
&gt; unhappiness over diet &gt; in some people&#39;s lives than anything else.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I did not say anything about becoming obsessed by diet?-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t personal, it wasn&#39;t about you or about your post. It was about the <br/>
fact that some people stress about diet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-No where did I advocate being a maniac diet monitor.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t personal.     I said we have all heard stories or seen people who <br/>
did X.   I didn&#39;t say that you did it or advocated it.   There are six billion <br/>
people on the planet.   I&#39;m talking about some of them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think there is a connection between breathing or<br/>
consuming carcinogens over a long period of time and getting cancer.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well yes, but that&#39;s because &quot;carcinogen&quot; means &quot;cancer-causing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-You appeared to be implying that smoking, drinking and eating plenty<br/>
of junk food did not affect people negatively. I felt I had to<br/>
answer that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m not saying that.   I&#39;m saying that the stress and fear and guilt and <br/>
criticism are worse than the &quot;evil substances&quot; themselves.   (And I&#39;ve asked <br/>
for a long time for people to try not to use &quot;junk food&quot; in unschooling <br/>
discussions, because it&#39;s too much like dividing the world into educational and <br/>
non-educational.   It hampers clear thought to label some things &quot;stupid&quot; or <br/>
&quot;worthless&quot; or &quot;junk.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never smoked, I occasionally have one single drink, and when I eat meat <br/>
it&#39;s usually chicken, white-meat, and never fried.   I&#39;m not defending evil <br/>
habits of my own at all; I&#39;m questioning the assertions of those who seem to <br/>
believe they can control their own and other people&#39;s fates in the life-and-death <br/>
category.    Living in the &quot;when you&#39;re 90&quot; future instead of in the moment <br/>
is not helpful to good relationships with our children now.   In the absence of <br/>
good relationships with our children now, unschooling doesn&#39;t work as well as <br/>
it could.<br/>
<br/>
Living peacefully and fully in the moment is more important than almost any <br/>
other factor for learning, health or peace.   (I don&#39;t know why I said &quot;almost <br/>
any other&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>

There&#39;s a collection of some of the best things written about food on this <br/>
list and related exchanges over the past few years.    Mostly, it&#39;s about kids <br/>
and choices and parents letting go of fears and controls.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same kind of message unschoolers share and benefit from in areas of <br/>
TV and music, movies and video games, reading, writing...   <br/>

Yes.   And incrementally better is doable for anyone, no matter how rich or <br/>
poor or knowledgeable or nervous.   Making the best choice in the moment, being <br/>
mindful and present--that&#39;s what will help unschooling unfold richly and <br/>
fully.<br/>

have the best cheesecake there, really huge piece. I knew the pizza <br/>
would take awhile, and knew we wanted to share a piece of <br/>
cheesecake, so i asked the waiter to bring it first. I figured if we <br/>
got full, we could always take the pizza home. <br/>
<br/>
There is the quote &quot;Life is short, eat dessert first!&quot; but yet <br/>
parents don&#39;t like to apply that to kids. Maybe they think kids have <br/>
all the time in the world. I think they should remember there is no <br/>
guarantee that they&#39;ll grow up. <br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to something else i&#39;ve been thinking about. Why does <br/>
it bother me so much when newbies come here and want assurances that <br/>
their child WILL go to college, WILL be &quot;successful&quot;, WILL get a <br/>
good job? I think its because, for us, we just dont live in the <br/>
future so much anymore. I rarely ask my son anymore what he wants to <br/>
be when he grows up. It seems rather silly to decide on that now, or <br/>
to worry about it now. Even if i knew that unschooling would make it <br/>
*more* difficult for my child in the future, i would still unschool, <br/>
because that is what is causing him maximum happiness right now. Why <br/>
ruin the present for a future that isnt guaranteed? That&#39;s why i <br/>
couldnt wrap my mind around the need for scientific proof that <br/>
unschooling works, or why anyone would need more proof than just <br/>
looking at their kid and seeing how happy they are. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152222513">&lt;&lt;&lt;Is it possible not to use the word &quot;crap&quot; in reference to food, <br/>
please?<br/>
It&#39;s a cheap and easy way for parents to condemn foods and make their <br/>
kids<br/>
feel, well... like crap.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I have to admit that I thought this was a little nit picky BUT <br/>
it has caused me to turn over in my mind some of my attitudes about <br/>
food and how that DOES effect my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom died a few years ago, from cancer.  It was a sad and ugly way <br/>
to die.  Since then I have read countless books on health, sickness, <br/>
nutrition deficiency, toxicity, etc.  I actually became a vegetarian <br/>
when my mom was first diagnosed with metasticized cancer ten years <br/>
ago.  I was realizing this morning, after reading all of Sandras great <br/>
posts, that I do push my paranoia of disease and sickness on my kids, <br/>
sometimes in subtle ways and sometimes in not so subtle ways.  And <br/>
shame is definitely a factor sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just wanted to say thank you to all of you at these e-lists <br/>
that make us think about our choices and help make us all more mindful <br/>
of how we live.  Unschooling is about living in the moment in a <br/>
joyful, peaceful way and I realize I still have some work to do!!  I <br/>
think I spend far too much time worrying about the future and not <br/>
living in the moment.  I am going to stop right now, this very <br/>
minute.  I don&#39;t have a guarantee of tomorrow so today my kids and <br/>
myself are going to live JOYFULLY and I am going to sip on my triple <br/>
shot latte and enjoy every minute of it without an ounce of guilt (I <br/>
drink them everyday but worry all the time about what it is doing to <br/>
my body).  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for understanding, and for thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
I still tell Marty sometimes that rap music leads to a life of crime, as does <br/>
wearing pants really low.   He listens to the music, but he doesn&#39;t wear his <br/>
pants low, so he&#39;s only MAYBE on a path to prison (by my stated estimations).  <br/>
 I say it as a joke, but he knows I don&#39;t like rap, and so he makes a joke in <br/>
return and arranges for different music when the song&#39;s over, or whatever, as <br/>
appropriate.    <br/>
<br/>
He knows I&#39;m just expressing &quot;I don&#39;t like that music much&quot; in a light-ish <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
My cousin, who grew up with me, did exactly to her kids what was done to us.  <br/>
 She condemned their music, and them and said &quot;That&#39;s not music.&quot;   It puts a <br/>
giant wedge between parents and children at best, and a stake in the heart of <br/>
the child&#39;s joy at worst.   Somewhere in there, though, big chunks of <br/>
metaphorical wood are being stuck where they don&#39;t need to be. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-My mom died a few years ago, from cancer.  It was a sad and ugly way<br/>
to die.  Since then I have read countless books on health, sickness,<br/>
nutrition deficiency, toxicity, etc.  I actually became a vegetarian<br/>
when my mom was first diagnosed with metasticized cancer ten years<br/>
ago.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows more details of this case, which is maybe too old to find, <br/>
I&#39;d be interested.   But in a psychology class long ago we were told, in the <br/>
area of any substance being dangerous in sufficient amounts, that a young woman&#39;s <br/>
father died, and she started drinking water.   She drank and drank until she <br/>
died a few days later.   Her kidneys weren&#39;t working and there was water in <br/>
her lungs.   She drowned herself from the inside, overloaded her system--even <br/>
water, we were told, can kill you if you don&#39;t balance things out.<br/>
<br/>
Reactions to death and disease are interesting, but the attempted magic <br/>
doesn&#39;t bring the people back.   There&#39;s a movie--I would not have been able to <br/>
watch it if I still had very young children, so beware--but it involves a young <br/>
boy trying to bring some people back from death or exile during the German <br/>
occupation of Poland.   Only the strong of heart (and no nursing mothers, I think) <br/>
should watch it, but it&#39;s called Edges of the Lord and is on DVD. IMBD says <br/>
right up top: &quot; Powerful, haunting, emotionally draining.&quot;   It has Haley Joel <br/>
Osment, Willem Dafoe, Liam Hess (a little boy who&#39;s on TV in the U.K. but <br/>
unknown outside of that, I think) and lots of Poles.   Another review said &quot;as <br/>
powerful and memorable as Schindler&#39;s List or the Pianist, and is certainly not <br/>
for young children.&quot;   <br/>

There&#39;s a fraternity hazing case from Chico State that&#39;s going to trial <br/>
right now (?), at least I glimpsed it on the news recently.  Pushing a <br/>
person to drink too much water can kill them, and did in this case, by <br/>
lowering sodium levels so much that some kind of systemic failure occured.<br/>

<br/>
So true!!  And neither does making my kids feel bad about non-<br/>
nutritious food choices make them eat more nutritious food!!  <br/>
Something else I am coming to realize is that emotional and <br/>
psychological health is just as or more important than physical <br/>
health!!<br/>
<br/>
A couple years ago when Ren and I were having a discussion on health <br/>
and my coffee habit she mentioned that there IS something to emotional <br/>
health and that if I enjoyed coffee that much and it made me feel good <br/>
then I shouldn&#39;t feel bad about drinking it because it was possibly <br/>
good for my emotional health.  I think she is very right and it is all <br/>
part of the process of getting rid of black and white thinking!!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This just made me think of our societies general thinking on how <br/>
certain actions bring certain results.  Kind of like what we have been <br/>
discussing, &quot;If you do _____, then _______will happen.&quot;  Consequently <br/>
people start thinking well if _______will happen when I do ______ well <br/>
then A LOT of _______will happen when I do A LOT of______.<br/>
<br/>
It got me thinking about traditional parenting thinking.....If you do <br/>
______, then ______will happen, as if kids are computers or <br/>
something.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why this got me thinking about the following but.....in <br/>
our newspaper yesterday there was a picture of a girl standing out by <br/>
the highway holding a big sign that said &quot;I don&#39;t do my homework and I <br/>
act up in school, so my parents are preparing me for my future.&quot;  It <br/>
happened in Oklahoma somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I was so sickened by it but I was glad that some people had called in <br/>
to social services and reported psychological abuse, troopers <br/>
responded and made her leave (her mom was with her too).  One woman <br/>
said &quot;The parents of that girl need more education than she does if <br/>
they can&#39;t see that the worst scenario in this case is to kill their <br/>
daughter psychologically.&quot;  A psychologist made the comment that such <br/>
punishment could do extreme emotional damage, he thought maybe they <br/>
should try and catch her when she was being good!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I thought this was another case of extreme thinking on the <br/>
action/results thing.<br/>

<br/>
Whether it&#39;s worse than psychological death or not, another scenario is <br/>
suicide. <br/>
Charles Montoya and Alice Law killed themselves at 14 and 15, when we were <br/>
kids--one in 8th grade and the other in 9th.   <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t judge myself harshly when my mom said her stupid things, I just <br/>
decide early on that SHE wasn&#39;t very nice or very smart, and not worth me worrying <br/>
so hard about.   I didn&#39;t trust her opinion a bit.   But when she would say <br/>
&quot;If you do that, you&#39;ll get hurt,&quot; she said it with such an edge that I started <br/>
to know she WANTED me to get hurt so she could say &quot;I told you so.&quot;    Her <br/>
warnings were more like threats, or curses.   She didn&#39;t intend it, but her <br/>
emotions were so raw and wrong it just came out that way.   She was a wad of <br/>
jealousy and resentment and vague confusion.   I don&#39;t want to do things that my <br/>
kids will carry around and take out on their kids.   Casual cruelty and weird <br/>
little threats needed to end with me.<br/>

I also can vaguely, hauntingly, remember something talking about an<br/>
immediate health boost to smoking such that if you started smoking at<br/>
80 you would have greater longevity than those who were 80 and never<br/>
smoked. Something about the sssociated increase in blood pressure,<br/>

Not that I&#39;m arguing that people should start smoking to avoid<br/>
Alzheimers, but there is some evidence that even smoking isn&#39;t<br/>
completely devoid of positive effects.  <br/>

repeatedly to keep themselves hydrated and some have gone to such an  <br/>
extreme that they drink too much.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something from the New York Road Runners site:<br/>

&gt; cause a dangerous condition known as hyponatremia (water  <br/>
&gt; intoxication). This drop in the body�s sodium levels can cause  <br/>
&gt; nausea, fatigue, vomiting, weakness, and in the most severe cases,  <br/>
&gt; seizures, coma, and death. To avoid hyponatremia, do not overdrink,  <br/>
&gt; include pretzels or a salted bagel in your pre-run meal, and use a  <br/>
&gt; sports drink that contains sodium. During exercise, drink no more  <br/>
&gt; than a cup of fluid every 15 to 20 minutes.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The big problem for the runners is that the medical people don&#39;t  <br/>
recognize hyponatremia and think from the symptoms its dehydration so  <br/>
they tell them to drink water. Ironically they say no one has died in  <br/>
a race from dehydration but there have been several deaths from  <br/>
hyponatremia.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe because the parents&#39; emotions are all in a twist.   They&#39;re needy, of <br/>
attention and power and spotlight and credit.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is by giving that you receive&quot; some guy said (St. Francis, Jesus, Santa <br/>
Claus...    some or all of them).<br/>
<br/>
Some parents want to be thought great parents by their friends and relatives. <br/>
  They do what they think great parents do, which is limit and say no and <br/>
control and then as a reward they talk about the kids as though they&#39;re not in <br/>
the room.    And like the parade watchers in The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes, the <br/>
other parents say &quot;Oooh, you&#39;re a great parent,&quot; because then they want to hear <br/>
the same thing back.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier and more honest to just BE attentive to kids than to put up an <br/>
elaborate screen of pretending to really care.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess it&#39;s not pretending, to just define the world in such a way that <br/>
children are small and stupid and parents are wise and knowledgeable.   It&#39;s <br/>
