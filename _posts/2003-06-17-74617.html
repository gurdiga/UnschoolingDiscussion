lines you are responding to and then your answer. Try reading in digest mode<br/>
for a few days and you&#39;ll see what I mean. I often just cannot weed through<br/>
all the massive quotes and yahoo footers to get to what counts. I know I&#39;m<br/>
missing lots of good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you just hit reply without cutting and pasting, the post contains<br/>
EVERYTHING that was in the post you&#39;re replying to - sometimes it&#39;s four or<br/>
five previous messages. I&#39;m finding myself getting mad at those who pay no<br/>
attention to this.<br/>
<br/>
So, again, please......<br/>
