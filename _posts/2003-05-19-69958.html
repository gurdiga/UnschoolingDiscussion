him too!<br/>

&lt;BG&gt;  THanks Kelly!  He probably would have really appreciated that!  I <br/>
should have posted this earlier!  He&#39;s home now!!  Well, actually he&#39;s now <br/>
at work but he made it back.  I am truly hopeless when it comes to reading a <br/>
map.  I&#39;m getting better though so maybe there&#39;s a ray of hope there <br/>
somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The good thing about him getting lost is he now knows EXACTLY where the <br/>
conference and the hotel are! LOL  And I could probably navigate Columbia <br/>
having never even been there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
