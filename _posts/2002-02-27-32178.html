 </span></blockquote>Maybe cleaning up the many typos would help, too ;-) I did that... and<br/>
don&#39;t feel stupid, this is just my area of interest - start a thread<br/>
about recent movies and I&#39;ll be clueless.<br/>
<br/>
Prescriptive grammarians, people like college English teachers, are<br/>
focused on correct vs. incorrect, and they think things should be done<br/>
correctly.  They *prescribe* the &quot;right&quot; way to say things or write<br/>
things. This is a fairly new idea, by the way.... <br/>
<br/>
Linguists are concerned with describing the ways people communicate. They<br/>
don&#39;t judge, and they don&#39;t consider one way more correct than another.<br/>
One caveat - this is applied to groups of people, not individuals. A ten<br/>
yr old born and raised in Tucson who said /y/ for /l/ would be considered<br/>
to have a speech problem. However, in some regions people say &quot;yellow&quot; as<br/>
yell-oh, other places it&#39;s pronounced yah-ler. Linguistically speaking,<br/>
this is all equally correct and fine and good.<br/>
<br/>
So, my 21 year old sister  is taking both a linguistics class and an<br/>
English class this semester. In her linguistics class one day, they<br/>
learned about phonology (basically, the study of a language&#39;s sounds and<br/>
the pronounciation of words), and about the regional differences in the<br/>
pronounciation of some phonemes. Then she went straight to English class,<br/>
where the teacher told them they&#39;d be tested on their ablity to use<br/>
standard symbols and letters to write the pronounciation of words (like<br/>
in a dictionary). Of course, my sister had just learned that there were<br/>
regional variations in pronounciation, so she told the teacher that she<br/>
couldn&#39;t ask them to do that, because some people pronounced things<br/>
differently and it was okay to do so, and any way someone pronounced a<br/>
word was right.<br/>
<br/>
Then the teacher blew her off, which wasn&#39;t  good but my sister had  been<br/>
pretty rude, as I heard it. So she stopped going to that class, which is<br/>
why after 4 years of college she&#39;s a sophomore still. I did try to<br/>
explain the whole thing to her, but she&#39;d already decided that the<br/>
English teacher didn&#39;t know anything so I didn&#39;t make much of a dent.<br/>
