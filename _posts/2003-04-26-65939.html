 </span></blockquote>Someone else brought the idea of another one up on the message boards after <br/>
last year&#39;s conference. <br/>
<br/>
The main thing is that SOMEONE has to take responsibility---especially <br/>
financially. It&#39;s very scary to start, but---&quot;if you plan it, they will <br/>
come!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There has to be someone willing to step up and agree to be the contact <br/>
person/coordinator and &quot;take the fall&quot; if things don&#39;t go as planned and you <br/>
lose money. People and hotels and stuff STILL must be paid, whether you make <br/>
$$ or not. SOS made $300 last year (which went to pay the web designer, who <br/>
donated her time & services)---but ONLY because Sandra was hurt and the hotel <br/>
didn&#39;t charge us for everything. I would&#39;ve LOST $1200! (thanks, Sandra!)<br/>
<br/>
Be organized. Be anal! Give yourself at least a year to get organized. <br/>
<br/>
The bigger cities have more to offer, but can also be more expensive. Weigh <br/>
that carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Check out EVERYTHING that is scheduled in town that weekend---you don&#39;t want <br/>
a hotel with three weddings going on the same weekend---or a bunch of family <br/>
reunions---or a huge plumber&#39;s convention. Off-season is best---they&#39;re <br/>
LOOKING for business then! You want the hotel to be DEAD that weekend, so <br/>
that you can demand more (and pay less!).<br/>
<br/>
Shop around for hotels. Be picky (within reason) and demand EVERYTHING---they <br/>
won&#39;t give it all to you--but the more you ask for, the more you&#39;ll <br/>
eventually get! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Call in every favor ever owed you! And then beg for more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Come to the SC conference for ideas! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You CAN do it---but you must be committed. <br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, who SHOULD be committed! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; Texas would be good, we&#39;re smack dab in the middle! ;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There has been a conference in D/FW area but it got very strange and I think <br/>
it&#39;s dead now, but like a volcano, it could still spew a bit later.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke in Houston last fall but a few things went wrong.  That was sad <br/>
because it had potential, but for one thing, the website listed the wrong <br/>
hotel (the one from the year before).  I don&#39;t actually know whether anyone <br/>
went to the wrong hotel or not.  There were a dozen other problems with <br/>
scheduling and physical plant and conflicts, but biggest was the hurricane <br/>
which did miss Houston, but did some trashing of Louisiana.  Very near.<br/>
<br/>
To anyone with websites (including me; I need to go do another pass), <br/>
especially TIMELY websites, go in there ever few days and click every <br/>
possible link to make sure they not only work but they&#39;re not pointing to <br/>
last year&#39;s hotel.<br/>
<br/>
One thing Texas has is lots of group camping sites, owned by clubs like Li<br/>
ons, Kiwanis, etc.  &quot;Camps,&quot; often with a building (kitchen, bathrooms, big <br/>
area) and lots of little shelters and picnic places.  That could be a <br/>
conference site.  Reasons AGAINST:  vendors.  Vendors want modern <br/>
convenience, 6&#39; conference tables, carpet, etc.   Reasons FOR:  cheap, kids <br/>
can play.  <br/>
<br/>
The advantage of a hotel is hotels provide lockable rooms for storage of Much <br/>
Paper, they have overhead projectors, PA systems, lots of chairs, food, tons <br/>
of toilet paper, many beds.  Shuttles to airports.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the middle kind of conference.   At a church or similar <br/>
building, Friday night and all day Saturday.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spoken at all three kinds (not camping, on the camp, just an all day <br/>
picnic situation).  <br/>
<br/>
Something I like which is none of the above is people just having a speaker <br/>
in for one day or evening.  People can pay $8 or $12 apiece and it can cover <br/>
the fee and transportation of the speaker.  No huge risk.<br/>
<br/>
But the benefits of a full-blown, sleep and wake up and still be there <br/>
conference are the same kinds of benefits as fundamentalist revivals, where <br/>
people preach and sing for three days or a week.  You all get caught up in <br/>
the fervor of everyone else&#39;s upliftedness and it does something biochemical <br/>
to people which can last months (or if you&#39;re lucky, a year).<br/>

even offering free admission for grandparents.  I wouldn&#39;t call it an<br/>

<br/>
How about we grab a place - off season - kind of a small-ish place and take over the whoole place?<br/>
<br/>
If we go to Cape Cod on fall - there aren&#39;t anywhere near so may folks. Perhaps we can find a town - perhaps around the Boston -Providence area (airports).....<br/>

Please believe me - I know this can be done - outside - using tents. We do it often.<br/>
also, there are places that have shelter - Frances Farm in Rehoboth comes to mind -we pow wow there w/ one of the tribes -  it has a large roofed, open space, a good sized indoor space - we usually use it for pot luck on Sat. night, a kitchen and another area that&#39;s roofed, but thin and long.<br/>
<br/>
And we use the Old Farmers Almanac to help us make choices. - it&#39;s often right!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Michigan they have a women&#39;s fest every year.  Thousands turn out for that <br/>
one.  Of course they have their own grounds for it but they have camping.  <br/>
Tents, everyone brings their own.  They have showers etc.  And a &quot;mess hall&quot; <br/>
everyone pitches in to do a &quot;chore&quot;.  They have a vendor type tent.  I <br/>
personally like the hotels.  Easier to keep track of my boys.  Not as easy to <br/>
wander off, no poison ivy.  Easier to take children to the bathroom in the <br/>
middle of the night etc.  But it can be done.  They have a web site. &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.michfest.com/home.htm&quot;">http://www.michfest.com/home.htm&quot;</a>&gt;Michigan <br/>

&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s talk.<br/>
&gt; &gt; When do you think we should have it??<br/>
&gt; &gt; Where would you like to have it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; How long would it be??<br/>
&gt; &gt; Janis<br/>
&gt; &gt; 401-438-7678<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone else brought the idea of another one up on the message boards<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; last year&#39;s conference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The main thing is that SOMEONE has to take responsibility---especially<br/>
&gt; financially. It&#39;s very scary to start, but---&quot;if you plan it, they will<br/>
&gt; come!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There has to be someone willing to step up and agree to be the contact<br/>
&gt; person/coordinator and &quot;take the fall&quot; if things don&#39;t go as planned and<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; lose money. People and hotels and stuff STILL must be paid, whether you<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; $$ or not. SOS made $300 last year (which went to pay the web designer,<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; donated her time & services)---but ONLY because Sandra was hurt and the<br/>
hotel<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t charge us for everything. I would&#39;ve LOST $1200! (thanks, Sandra!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be organized. Be anal! Give yourself at least a year to get organized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The bigger cities have more to offer, but can also be more expensive.<br/>
Weigh<br/>
&gt; that carefully.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Check out EVERYTHING that is scheduled in town that weekend---you don&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; a hotel with three weddings going on the same weekend---or a bunch of<br/>
family<br/>
&gt; reunions---or a huge plumber&#39;s convention. Off-season is best---they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; LOOKING for business then! You want the hotel to be DEAD that weekend, so<br/>
&gt; that you can demand more (and pay less!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shop around for hotels. Be picky (within reason) and demand<br/>
EVERYTHING---they<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t give it all to you--but the more you ask for, the more you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; eventually get! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Call in every favor ever owed you! And then beg for more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Come to the SC conference for ideas! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You CAN do it---but you must be committed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ~Kelly, who SHOULD be committed! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

CHN is having a con in Riverside in June of this year. It&#39;s not to expensive, and grandparents get in free, the free may apply to other family memebers, I&#39;m not sure, but I do know grandparents are free. <br/>

The conference in Sacramento is heavily unschooling, but not exclusively.<br/>

It&#39;s not like there are unschooling conferences all over the place, and there <br/>
probably never will be.  There&#39;s no money to be had.  What do vendors sell to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101166333">Hi,<br/>
Okay, before I say anything....<br/>
Let me preface this by saying I am a vendor.<br/>
<br/>
We work primarily at powwows.<br/>
We also set up at a few feasts, state fairs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We sell blankets, ponchos, books, tapes, essential oils, oil accessories, bumper stickers, posters, decals, drums, drum accessories, t-shirts, sweatshirts, books, toys, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We sell items that are from other small businesses.<br/>
What we sell is universal.<br/>
<br/>
There should be a variety of vendors; a couple of pagan vendors, book vendors, ethnic vendors, why not?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all educational, it&#39;s all good!<br/>
