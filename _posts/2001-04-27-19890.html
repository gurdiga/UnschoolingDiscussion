&lt;&lt; His cousin might do the actually marrying part...the<br/>
 official part...being a notary and all, but instead of<br/>
 having her, or one specific person give a speech of<br/>
 some sort, we were thinking of having each person in<br/>
 our wedding party come up and say a few words about<br/>
 marriage or love. Just short ones, and not about US,<br/>
 but about love or marriage in general. Then his cousin<br/>
 come up and do the official part. <br/>
 Any ideas along those lines? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I like the concept but beware of length. We had a JP and a friend of the <br/>
family do a bit part. I do not remember a word he said. I was sweltering in <br/>
the sun and about to topple off the stone wall embankment we were upon. <br/>
Granted we got married 4th of July weekend in PA. At least I was barefoot and <br/>
the grass felt cooler. <br/>
<br/>
    Many people still talk of our wedding as the coolest they have been to <br/>
but I can&#39;t remember much of it. We made the rounds and didn&#39;t even get half <br/>
of our dinner. The damn photographer kept stealing us. I loathed him,we never <br/>
did buy any photos.<br/>
<br/>
   Our men wore white shirts and blue shorts and Tevas the girls wore blue <br/>
dress w/ white flowers, something they could wear to another gathering <br/>
easily. Any shoes they wanted any jewlery they wanted and so on. Guests were <br/>
invited to wear shorts or whatever. It was a semi formal outdoor wedding on <br/>
my parents farm. The JP said an Indian Prayer and we were married. Oh and one <br/>
of the guys was stung by a bee while standing there. All our pics have him w/ <br/>
a giant welt on his forehead.<br/>
<br/>
    If I had to do it over again I would pick somewhere special to us and <br/>
casually invite those who wanted to attend. No stress, no fuss, and all fun. <br/>
Actually I&#39;d go w/ dh and get married alone on some awesome singletrack. I <br/>
have tried to tell all of my cousins to run away but no one listens. they are <br/>
spending gobs and are stressing big time and family tiffs are popping up all <br/>
around. Not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
    OK sorry about that :o) Can you tell I am still a bit miffed about my <br/>
wedding? Although we still call my dh assy from time to time&lt;that is what my <br/>
Grandmother called him that day&gt;. UGH!<br/>
<br/>
   NICKI~ happily married to the greatest guy I  personally know.</div>
