When I read your post, my heart broke and tears welled up into my eyes.  I cannot even begin to comprehend the agony of what you have been through.  I cannot believe God wanted these things to happen to you, but I do believe that all things happen for a reason and are part of a greater plan that we can only hope to comprehend one day.<br/>
 <br/>
To the person that hurt you this badly I say, There is nothing worse than someone who commits atrocities and claims to be a Godly person.  To me this is perversion in it&#39;s worst form.<br/>
 <br/>
To you I say, You are not and never were useless, and I know that God loved you the whole time.  I cannot explain why you were allowed to be abused or why millions are hurt and suffer and starve etc.  I have also gone through things, (not a severe as yours, but pretty awful) that I don&#39;t understand.  But, you know what?  God is using my hurtful experiences, even now, to reach out with compassion to others, because I&#39;ve been there and I can relate to them.<br/>
 <br/>
I may have way overstepped  my bounds here, but I felt so moved by what you said, I had to say something.  Thanks for listening.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Hi Keith,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in the christian god either, he let me down when as a small<br/>
child I did believe in him, he lets hundreds of children down each day, if<br/>
he was all powerful why does he allow children to die and suffer at the<br/>
hands of abusers?   At the age of five after having a cigarette stubbed out<br/>
in the palm of my hand by a &quot;gentleman&quot; who loved quoting the bible, and<br/>
after being beaten for being stupid and falling off a swing and splitting<br/>
my head open, after having it stitched with no anesthetic, then being sent<br/>
to bed with no food and blood all through my hair.  These were just two of<br/>
the too many incidents which told me that either I was a worthless nothing<br/>
who god cared nothing for or god didn&#39;t exist.  I chose the latter.</div>

Thankyou for your sensitive email.<br/>
<br/>
You did not overstep any bounds, you expressed compassion from what I<br/>
perceive to be a Christian viewpoint, and that is fine with me.  I have no<br/>
problems with anyone elses faith or convictions.  What I do have problems<br/>
is with the way some try to force their beliefs down the throats of others<br/>
and by doing so they devalue the beliefs of others.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone&#39;s own beliefs are very important and very personal and should not<br/>
be belittled by others.  I know many fine Chrisitians and like their<br/>
company, they are able to accept that I do not believe what they do and<br/>
just get on with our relationship, whatever that may be.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I suffered at the hands of more than one person, for some strange<br/>
reason working in a children&#39;s home seems to dehumanize people, or maybe it<br/>
attracts the type of people who feel powerless in their own lives and<br/>
realize that when in control of a group of orphans, unwanted children etc<br/>
they are all powerfull.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m mostly over it now, it took me over 30 years before I could<br/>
talk about it, and only then could the healing really start to take effect.<br/>
 In some ways I do think a difficult childhood can lead to increased<br/>
compassion for others, but I think it more often goes the other way and<br/>
produces people who pass the suffering on to their own children.<br/>
