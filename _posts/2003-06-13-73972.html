Get some others and have them professionally dyed, or paint them with crafts <br/>
paints.<br/>
<br/>
I won a pair of handmade shoes once (my husband won a tournament and that was <br/>
the prize).  I knew the artist, a guy  named Richard from Kansas.<br/>
<br/>
I told him I wanted low gold shoes that tied.  He said he couldn&#39;t really do <br/>
gold.<br/>
<br/>
Here is why guys think that:  They use leather dye.  Leather dye is nasty,  <br/>
old-timey stuff.<br/>
I said &quot;Okay, just make them tan then.  Thanks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Every couple of years I get another 59 cent bottle of gold metallic crafts <br/>
paint from a crafts or sewing store, and I paint them again.  Eventually it <br/>
cracks, but it&#39;s a shoe polish situation.  It&#39;s always GREAT for the first use, <br/>
and passable for the next few.<br/>
<br/>
But if the purple boots you need would need to be dyed for sure and not <br/>
painted, then take some light-color boots to a shoe shop or leather-worker and get <br/>
them to dye them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600974603">Instead of using craft paints, spray-paint the boots/shoes!<br/>
We&#39;d do that for plays when we needed other-color footwear and it works <br/>
beautifully.  It doesn&#39;t crack like thicker paints and it&#39;s easier (to my <br/>
way of thinking, anyway) if a bit messier (cover the ground with newspapers!)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
