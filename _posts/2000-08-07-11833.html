I missed the earlier message, but my response is that unschooling IS about following your children&#39;s lead.  If they want structure, classes, or whatever, then that&#39;s what you should do.  Unschooling is not about the what, but about who&#39;s making the choices and why.  Why wouldn&#39;t you let them be in the clubs they want?  What was the<br/>
original post?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153294827">i couldn&#39;t find the original post either so am only responding to <br/>
these posts. first i agree completely w/ sandi and i would like to add <br/>
that your children being  upset about your decision made think of some <br/>
story i read in holt&#39;s book &lt;teach your own&gt; a woman was talking about <br/>
starting a &#39;school&#39; out in the woods.  there were a few teens who had <br/>
been schooled.  over the summer they had a great time and did all <br/>
kinds of things which were interesting and learned a lot but when it <br/>
was time for regular school to begin the teen suddenly were bored and <br/>
lost all imagination which they had been using all summer.  so maybe <br/>
some of the reason your children want the classes and clubs is because <br/>
they need to deschool.  i&#39;m sure others could recommend some good <br/>
books on the subject.  deschooling is a really important step for the <br/>
whole family and really aids in unschooling.<br/>
