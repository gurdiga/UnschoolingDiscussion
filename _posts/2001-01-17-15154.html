<div id="ygrps-yiv-508126984">Well I thought I&#39;d introduce myself.  I subscribed to this group a few<br/>
days ago and have been following the conversations with interest.  A<br/>
little about my self...<br/>
My name is Arlene but I usually go by Mara (or Mara Arlene).  I&#39;m about<br/>
to turn 23 (tomorrow) and have two children, Cleopatra who is almost<br/>
three and Thony (Anthony) who is three months old.  I&#39;ve always felt<br/>
that education was a personal endeavor.  Personally I went to about 12<br/>
different schools while I was young (public, and various private schools<br/>
ranging from Montessori to fancier versions of public schools to non<br/>
denominational christian schools)  I went to about a year and a half of<br/>
college and got my GED when I was 19/20.  I consider myself to be an<br/>
unschooling college student. (I actually would like to become a<br/>
certified teacher so in a few months I&#39;m thinking of taking<br/>
correspondence classes to get started)<br/>
	I hope everyone will forgive me for merging topics but I&#39;ve been sick<br/>
this week and while I&#39;ve got a few thoughts on some of the current<br/>
conversations I haven&#39;t had the energy to reply to them individually.<br/>
	on co-sleeping and bedtimes<br/>
My parents didn&#39;t really co sleep with me, I knew I had the option to<br/>
climb into bed with them if I wanted to but I usually didn&#39;t.  After my<br/>
father died when I was twelve I found it was more comforting to sleep<br/>
with my mom (for her as well).  While I always had my own room and bed I<br/>
usually spent half the week sleeping with my mom (until I was 17 when I<br/>
decided I wanted to spend most of my nights awake)<br/>
I have never given Cleo a bedtime,  I found the few times she went to<br/>
bed around 7 she would wake up at four and then try to get me to wake up<br/>
too.  At the moment she usually goes to bed around 10 and even then she<br/>
wakes up around 6 or 7 in the morning (which isn&#39;t too bad).<br/>
	husbands that aren&#39;t very supportive of unschooling<br/>
My situation is a little different and because Cleo isn&#39;t &quot;school age&quot;<br/>
yet I haven&#39;t had to worry too much.  The times I&#39;ve tried to talk to my<br/>
husband about &quot;homeschooling&quot; we have just ended up arguing.  He was<br/>
homeschooled for a couple years and didn&#39;t like it, he thinks I don&#39;t<br/>
have the right educational background, that she wouldn&#39;t get enough<br/>
socialization, that it would &quot;harm&quot; her in some way. (most of the usual<br/>
arguments against homeschooling.  Then last night I asked him what he<br/>
thought of unschooling.  He asked me what it was because he hadn&#39;t heard<br/>
of it.  I don&#39;t remember my exact words but I basically told him that it<br/>
was the belief that everyone is learning at all times and to allow a<br/>
child to study the subjects that they are interested in at the time. <br/>
His response?  &quot;Oh, you mean the way I educated myself!&quot;  He then told<br/>
me to &quot;go for it&quot; and see how it works.  (I should have just told him<br/>
about unschooling to start with and dispensed with the arguments)  Cleo<br/>
on the other hand is all for going to school (she wants to ride the<br/>
yellow school bus that goes by our house every day)  She is also the<br/>
type of child that needs lots of interaction every day so I&#39;ve been<br/>
thinking of finding a small loosely structured Montessori preschool so<br/>
she could go and play for a while every day.  I have a little while to<br/>
decide though because she isn&#39;t potty trained yet (and shows no interest<br/>
in becoming so)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640381939">Welcome, Mara, and happy birthday! What a great conversation with your<br/>
husband about unschooling. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be extremely supportive.<br/>
