  And yet we still watch them.  I think it has to be<br/>
  that we enjoy the verbal sparring that goes on, as<br/>
  people in our family are quite quick-witted and enjoy<br/>
  playing on each other&#39;s words.  <br/>
=============================================================<br/>
One of the things I did in my literature classes was to have the kids watch the movie _Clueless_ and then read _Emma_. Clueless is a rewrite of Austen&#39;s novel set in a rich California highschool world. It was lots of fun to see how the same kinds of mannerly issues played out in today&#39;s world.<br/>
<br/>
Would be very interesting to watch from an unschooling perspective! <br/>

--danielle, who hated Austen for a long time, but now I really enjoy most literature from that time period (and I&#39;ve read tons!) I love Radcliffe and lots of the other potboiler gothic writers<br/>
<br/>
PS--check out her _Northanger Abbey_, a parody of all the gothic novels being written at the time and very different from her other novels<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Those books drive me crazy too, and my daughter too. We yell <br/>
at the PBS shows&#39; characters as well, telling them to just TALK to <br/>
each other honestly.  <br/>
<br/>
One of Sarah&#39;s favorite &quot;insults&quot; to hurl at someoneis to call <br/>
them &quot;a Mr. Darcy&quot;.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Madelyn was about 7 I went on an Austen kick.  Checked out all <br/>
the books-on-tape that the library had and listened to them while <br/>
housecleaning.  Madelyn, unbeknownst to me, me listened to them as <br/>
well while doing whatever (Legos or Barbies or something - this was <br/>
before we had TV).  One day she asked me why Mr. Knightly and Emma <br/>
took so long to get together, it was obvious that&#39;s what was going to <br/>
happen. . . .  <br/>
<br/>
(wheels turning in Mercedes&#39; head - hmmmm - this unschooling is <br/>
really cool. . . . . )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Not in the mean-spirited way it can be done in Austen&#39;s works, <br/>
though.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh, the way those Brits can just cut to the bone . . . . .  gotta <br/>
love `em.<br/>

Madelyn and I  watched both Clueless and the Gwyneth Paltrow version <br/>
of Emma.  We liked them. I can&#39;t remember what scene it was but there <br/>
was this one look Emma (Gwyneth) gives the camera - I remember <br/>
laughing out loud - guess I&#39;ll have to watch it again. . . . .<br/>

<br/>
This was the only Jane Austen work not available on tape at our <br/>
library. I&#39;ll have to check again.<br/>
<br/>
Mercedes<br/>
who prefers to listen to those books read with that lovely Brit <br/>
accent. . . .</div>
