&lt;&lt; Hmm, OK.. I was thinking about giving the kids those $5 disposable cameras <br/>
 and taking pix of &quot;stuff&quot; .. generally not considered beautiful.. . Then of <br/>
 course,  re examining the pictures to find the beauty. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ooh, I really like this idea!  I think photography is a fabulous way to look <br/>
at the world through a different lense, literally.<br/>
And there are photo ops at the most unlikely places.....old buildings can be <br/>
wonderful.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>

complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

drab the world was with nothing but shades of grey and brown. And Kathryn<br/>
piped up &quot;Aren&#39;t the trees beautiful?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they were :-)<br/>
