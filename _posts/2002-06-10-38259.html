<div id="ygrps-yiv-415815899">I think that with all the talk about tv and real life and books, I can <br/>
possibly prioritize my preferences. How do you rank the following? And <br/>
could/would you add another way of learning?<br/>
Let&#39;s take Nepal, since Marc did.<br/>
<br/>
To learn about Nepal, you could:<br/>
<br/>
1) travel there. Expensive, but TRULY the best way to learn about a <br/>
culture/country<br/>
<br/>
2) talk with someone who&#39;s been there. Now here you could speak to a native <br/>
or a visitor. Each would have a different take on the place. The native could <br/>
<br/>
tell you, first hand, the history, traditions, etc. But a recent visitor <br/>
could give you info/perspective that a native wouldn&#39;t think necessarily <br/>
important to you. Both may have local items for &quot;show & tell&quot;. Direct Q & A. <br/>
Limited availability/possible language limitations.<br/>
<br/>
3) tv/video. Shows with footage from wars, scenery, traditions, art, <br/>
festivals, etc. Interviews with natives (with dubbing/subtitles if <br/>
necessary). Often available in libraries or by chance on tv.<br/>
<br/>
4) the internet. Unlimited info at your fingertips 24/7. Possible moving <br/>
pictures, sound. Possibility of emailing a local to find out even more.<br/>
<br/>
5) books. Beautiful photos (from most places) and almost always available <br/>
from libraries/book stores.<br/>
<br/>
This is how I&#39;d prioritize my learning of a country, for example. And I&#39;m a <br/>
book freak.</div>

<br/>
I realized that I use all those resources when learning about something new,<br/>
yet none of them are prioritized higher thatn another. They are all just<br/>
different ways.<br/>
When we recently thought about moving to Albuquerque, NM I read articles in<br/>
NM magazine that I found at our local border&#39;s (in MD!) I scoured the<br/>
internet, I talked to Sandra, joined an email list for ABQ families, went to<br/>
the library, watched a show on TV about the Balloon festival held every<br/>
October. And finally went there to actually see it. None of these were any<br/>
better than another excluding the actual trip and seeing with my own eyes.<br/>
Today,I can&#39;t afford to Safari in Africa but I can do everything else to<br/>
learn about it for tomorrow.<br/>
Max is downstairs watching Between the Lions. It&#39;s not a substitute for<br/>
reading books or learning about wild lions, just another source to help him<br/>
learn about letter sounds. And learning he is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t mean for it to sound like that! Sorry. They ARE all different ways. <br/>
But some of the earlier discussion was that tv wasn&#39;t nearly as good as <br/>
actually being out there. Of course not. Probably most things aren&#39;t as good <br/>
as really BEING there(---well, The Crocodile Hunter is probably better on tv <br/>
than being there, though! &lt;g&gt;). I was trying to show that there ARE different <br/>
ways. <br/>
<br/>
Each of us has different ways of learning. Some may get more out of reading a <br/>
book; some, watching a movie; some, doing; some, talking. My older son&#39;s a <br/>
watcher---he hates to read, so that would be at the bottom for him (schooled <br/>
for 8 years). He also likes to listen and gets a lot from interaction from <br/>
others. I LOVE to read, but given the other choices, reading still wouldn&#39;t <br/>
rank as the MOST bang for my buck.<br/>
<br/>
We can talk with (or email) people who unschool.<br/>
We can read books about unschoolers/by John Holt.<br/>
We can watch Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off.<br/>
We can actually unschool.<br/>
<br/>
ALL are great learning experiences that explain unschooling. We can use all <br/>
of them in learning about unschooling. Some may work BETTER than others for <br/>
each individual.<br/>
