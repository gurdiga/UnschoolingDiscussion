<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767524746"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;(snip)Their family is Christian and spanks<br/>
&gt;as they say that the bible says so.  (snippity)<br/>

&gt;biblical?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Smacking kids is not biblical and she does NOT have a point.<br/>
<br/>
Spare the Rod and Spoil the Child (which I am assuming is the biblical <br/>
reference at issue here) speaks about GUIDING those for whom one is <br/>
responsible, not smacking &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
The Rod spoken of, is the shepherds rod, their crook (think Mary Go Peep <br/>
with her sheep sort-of-a-thing.)  Remember, the bible is set in a <br/>
shepherding-rich society!  Their sheep are their livelihood!  No sheep, no <br/>
riches and no food for the family!  Shepherds used their rods to GENTLY <br/>
nudge the sheep on the side to keep them on the path to the fields/market, <br/>
to lever them out from gullies, to defend the flock against predators, <br/>
etc.  Spare the rod and not only don&#39;t have any sheep at market, but you&#39;ve <br/>
got a whole bunch of them stuck in the bottom of gullies and eaten by <br/>
sharp-toothed critters!<br/>
<br/>
So, the next time someone uses the rod reference as a defense for smackin&#39; <br/>
kids,  you&#39;ll be able to guide them into a more Christ-like pathway.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Spare the Guidance and Spoil the Child, not Spare the Smackin&#39; and <br/>
Spoil the Child!<br/>
<br/>
This info brought to you by the grand-daughter of a Reverend, who went and <br/>
decided she was Athiest after all.  I can still speak the lingo when called <br/>
upon, though.<br/>

Well, I don&#39;t think I could always use this analogy.  We have sheep, and <br/>
believe me, using the rod is not always a &quot;gentle&quot; affair.  We don&#39;t hit them in <br/>
any way, shape, or form, but catching one in the crook of your rod usually <br/>
makes them kick, struggle and fight violently (most of them) to try and get free.  <br/>
LOL!  I wonder what sort of analogy we could make out of that?...<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know that the ones I bottle fed (mom sheep aren&#39;t able to &quot;count&quot; how <br/>
many babies they have, and sometimes if they have more than 2 (only 2 teats) <br/>
the 3rd will die of starvation) are very tame, sweet, will follow me anywhere. <br/>
 Attachment parenting?  I know we are also always very quiet and calm around <br/>
the sheep, and they respond best to gentleness.<br/>
