<div id="ygrps-yiv-673476343">If you send a message to this group and get back a &quot;bounced message notice,&quot; saying that the group doesn&#39;t exist, it most likely means you have left the &quot;dash&quot; in the group name. The name has been changed to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> WITHOUT a dash between Unschooling and Discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Hitting &quot;reply&quot; to a message will not work if it is a message that was sent before the list name was changed and you&#39;ll need to go up to your &quot;To&quot; or &quot;Send&quot; box and manually take out the &quot;dash&quot; in the name.<br/>
<br/>
Yahoogroups seems to be working again, it was very very uncooperative overnight, so I hope we don&#39;t lose much of the momentum of the discussion due to the name change. If you tried to send mail before and it bounced, please resend it now with the new name in the &quot;Send to&quot; box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
