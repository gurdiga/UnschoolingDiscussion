Sandra, I apologize to you the most. I admire you and understand now <br/>

thank-you for sharing all that you know just to help others.<br/>

Tim, I was tacky with what I said to you. I apologize. I was taking<br/>
my horrible experience with mom out on you. It should be her that I<br/>
spoke up to not you. I apologize.<br/>

Barb, You were right, I was tacky sad to say. Thank-you for making me <br/>

with me and putting you down.<br/>

I can&#39;t remember everyone that I spoke to or stuck my 2 cents in when <br/>
it was not wanted. I apologize to all of you also. Unschooling has <br/>
caused me to change with our son and now I guess it is causing me to <br/>
see that I need to change also. Something mom has not shown me but <br/>
this list has. Thanks<br/>

I don&#39;t being cranky and defensive is just part of dealing with things which <br/>
touch deep emotional roots.  Nearly all of us have school memories we don&#39;t <br/>
want to stir up, and mom-memories of the same sort too, and so whenever really <br/>
deep whys and whats are being discussed, some part of the group is likely to <br/>
feel raw about it.<br/>
<br/>
The answer isn&#39;t to stop discussing those issues, though, I don&#39;t think, but <br/>
to realize that moving toward giving our kids what we didn&#39;t have is going to <br/>
stir up old stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Kim, I&#39;m looking forward to opportunities to work along with you and others <br/>
here to help  people who maybe haven&#39;t even found this list yet, and those who <br/>
are here but haven&#39;t asked any questions yet.  <br/>
<br/>
[and just for general information, my computer is having a serious problem, <br/>
and we have houseguests, and I&#39;m going to be less active and available for the <br/>
next several days.  Sorry.]<br/>

    I&#39;m sorry to hear about your childhood. Sounds like a really hard<br/>

Actually we are moving out of state as we speak. We will be<br/>
completely <br/>
moved and gone by the end of this month so things are starting to <br/>
change, on my part at least. Mom, is another story! <br/>

    That is good news. Distance does help and I really didn&#39;t have $$ for<br/>
too many phone calls either. Both my dh and I have family living far far<br/>
away. LOL! Are you the ones moving to NH? I have a hard time remembering,<br/>
sorry.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    I keep a folder for quotes. The ones I really really like go into my<br/>
signature files. This one is my favorite quote. It&#39;s my standard quote. I<br/>
was glad to see the completed quote posted on Unschooling Cafe after someone<br/>
had picked up the shortened version.<br/>
    Now the tips are another story. I have to clear folders out<br/>
occasionally. I hate to do it but I&#39;m not into web pages and the like. I<br/>
really like Kellys&#39; idea of printing it out but I&#39;ve done that before with<br/>
another list and then don&#39;t read it again either. So clearing out works for<br/>
this slow old Mac. Good luck.<br/>

covers two topics. At least the move would be smoother!  &lt;g&gt; Then you could <br/>
hang them all over the house when you&#39;re settled! Unschooling wallpaper!<br/>
