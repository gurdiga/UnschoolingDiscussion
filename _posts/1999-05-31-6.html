<div id="ygrps-yiv-697441779">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just signed up on here yesterday, so I didn&#39;t get your introductory<br/>
message. Anyway, I&#39;m Eryn. I&#39;m fifteen years old and have been homeschooled<br/>
all my life -- I&#39;ve been unschooling for about a year. I have many<br/>
interests, which you&#39;ll probably find at my webpage:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/">http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/</a> and my views on unschooling can be found at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/Unschooling/">http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/Unschooling/</a><br/>
Anyway, who else is on here? ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523551166">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I know it said to read for a few weeks, but of course I have to jump <br/>
in with a question. That said, thanks for having me.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my story, in brief: my son Andrew (8/4th grade) has been <br/>
labeled since Kindergarten. Now he is at the point where he thinks <br/>
he&#39;s &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t change&quot;. (Bet you&#39;ve heard this story before..) <br/>
At any rate, I am sick to death of this. My child can go anywhere and <br/>
be complimented on his manners and kind attitude, except that one <br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
So here we are. (In CT, by the way.) My problem now is a notice of <br/>
intent. I wrote a letter to the superintendant, whom I know, and the <br/>
principal, whom I&#39;ve worked with. It said something like, &quot;We&#39;ll be <br/>
home schooling Andrew starting on this date.. We feel this is the <br/>
most positive enviornment for him.. You are welcome to review my <br/>
portfolio at any time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told I don&#39;t have to notify, I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s very <br/>
important to notify. I realize I&#39;m opening myself up if I offer my <br/>
portfolio but in all honesty, I&#39;d rather go by the books the first <br/>
year and see what happens. Worst comes to worse, they start citing <br/>
laws and threaten to take my child, I&#39;ll get a lawyer. Best case <br/>
scenario, they ignore me.<br/>
<br/>
The letter I wrote doesn&#39;t ask for a reply, however. Do they need to <br/>
acknowledge me?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, all, for any input. Very glad to be here, and again, please <br/>
excuse me jumping right in!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760563822">Hi Fiona,  I don&#39;t know how much help I can be, I&#39;m in MN, but when I started hs I also notified my district and didn&#39;t hear a peep from them.  Now this year I havn&#39;t done a thing and again I havn&#39;t heard a peep from them.  Now, I don&#39;t know if its too early to know, meaning its only Sept. still.  Or that they, the school district, is too busy with other things to bother with me?  I&#39;m sure there are others on this list that will know what to tell you,  I just don&#39;t know where everyone is right now.  <br/>
<br/>
Usually I get up in the morning and I have like 30 e-mails, today I had 1?  hmmmmm<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m sure someone will have some suggestions, and welcome to the world of unschooling!  We are loving it.  I also have a son who would be in 4th grade.  And he is why we are homeschooling also.<br/>

My big obstacle is my own schooling ideas.  My kids always seem to know the right thing, I just have to trust my kids instincts.  This is a great group, you&#39;ll find a wealth of info here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774449087">Hi Fiona,<br/>
<br/>
This is not just to you but to all that post to the list. When asking <br/>
about homeschooling compliance, please always, ALWAYS tell us what is <br/>
your state of residency. There are a few of us here that can help but <br/>
that is the most important piece of information we need.<br/>
<br/>
That said, everybody would do well to check their state&#39;s <br/>
homeschooling laws. The National Home Educators Network <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org">http://www.nhen.org</a>&gt;www.nhen.org has a wonderful website with all <br/>
the state&#39;s homeschooling laws and/or regulations.<br/>
<br/>
Most states have compulsory education laws that are supposed to <br/>
ensure all children in the state receive &quot;equivalent instruction&quot;; <br/>
meaning an education comparable to the one they would receive at a <br/>
public school. Here in NY, one of the state&#39;s with the worst <br/>
homeschooling regulations in the nation, we have very specific <br/>
curriculum guidelines that, even though we are supposed to start <br/>
complying with by first grade, they are really retroactive to <br/>
kindergarten. Yes, NY kids are supposed to have knowledge of certain <br/>
topics subjects by the time they enter 1st grade.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, unschooling is something that we would not announce <br/>
to the district nor would we mention on the quarterly reports we are <br/>
supposed to submit for the next 12 years of homeschooling <br/>
&quot;instruction&quot;. Why? Because unschooling, technically (and I am saying <br/>
technically because there are no laws that I know of that refer <br/>
specifically to unschooling) would not be allowed in most states with <br/>
compulsory and equivalency laws.<br/>
<br/>
So arm yourself ALWAYS with the exact wording of your state&#39;s laws or <br/>
regulations and NEVER and I mean, NEVER give them more than what they <br/>
ask. You are doing yourself and all homeschoolers in your state a <br/>
disservice. As it is, homeschooling should be off-limits to public <br/>
schools. Why would I want to give my child an education equivalent to <br/>
a public school if I am not put under the same grind if I were to pay <br/>
$16,000 for private education? And no, in NY the SED does not have <br/>
any say on how private (or in our case &quot;non-public&quot;) schools are run. <br/>
They have guidelines only --not even regulations.<br/>
<br/>
So check out nhen.org.  They are a wonderful resource.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a mom of five, but only two are left to homeschool...currently they are both watching different t.v.s .  My eight year old (going on 9) loves a varity of shows and I have found she really learns from them... between the lions helped her read, she is a cyber chase fan, and loves all the animal shows I think...zaboomafoo, stanley etc.  Not to mention all the animes...<br/>
<br/>
She has also just started getting involved in Neopets.  Anyone else do these?  I just signed parental consent so she can do email...She is starting to really like the games and has completed her first quest.   The whole thing really looks fun...I&#39;m tempted to get my own pets..if only I was younger!<br/>
<br/>
We are Orthodox Jews...getting ready for Succot...got to finish cooking, but I&#39;m here, avoiding work... Soup stil to go, chicken for us... If I wait long unless it will cook itself, right? Someone agree..<br/>

Welcome Rachel. <br/>
In celebrating Succot, do you do the whole outside natural tent thing? Or am <br/>
I thinking of another Jewish celebration? It seems that Succot was the one <br/>
where you build a little family tent outside, very earthy. Sounds really neat.<br/>

I&#39;ve done most of the cooking!  Feeling rather proud...soups up and cooking, gefilte fish is done, rice cooked...just one more thing to go and that I think I&#39;m going to do tomorrow.

  where you build a little family tent outside, very earthy. Sounds really neat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280348956">Hi Fiona,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is your child  interested in becoming penpals with my daughter?  I do the typing or she would never write...it takes her too long to find the keys, and it sort of takes the fun out of writing... If you think she might, write to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hindar@...">hindar@...</a>  later, I&#39;ll have her account set up and ready...<br/>
<br/>
Just let your daughter? son?  know if s/he is interested that it will be Sunday night or Monday before Esther can write back to her...<br/>
<br/>
be well, and welcome to you too!<br/>
Rachel Ann<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819320691">Thanks Todd &gt; : ) It was more of &quot;Hey we&#39;re taking our child out of your <br/>
grasp! Heh!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Actually, Andrew went to school so excited yesterday, he ended up getting in <br/>
trouble again. The principal pulled my husband aside and he told her and she <br/>
was very supportive. One hurdle crossed!<br/>
<br/>
I am going to go check out your site. Are you a designer? <br/>
