<br/>
2nd Annual Nevada Homeschool Network Convention<br/>
June 18 and 19, 2004<br/>
Calvary Community, 2900 N. Torrey Pines Dr.<br/>
<br/>
Not an unschooling conference, a variety show of homeschooling topics.  The <br/>
way it&#39;s set up (seems to be) is that each particular homeschooling group there <br/>
is sponsoring a speaker.   I&#39;m sponsored by Las Vegas Life Learners, a new <br/>
unschooling group there.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/</a><br/>
<br/>
Other people I know to be on the unschooling side of life are Connie Colten;<br/>
and Elissa Wahl who&#39;s one of the authors of Christian unschooling; and <br/>
Steve and Kimberly Patrow who used to live in Albuquerque and were active in <br/>
The Goof Group, a weekly unschooling group we used to have here when Kirby and <br/>
Marty were younger.<br/>
<br/>
Other workshop and presentation descriptions are about control and biblical <br/>
mandates and other things I have no interest in.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an HSLDA guy.<br/>
The main speaker is Reb Bradley, who seems to be a preacher more than <br/>
anything else. <br/>
<br/>
There are some things Holly might like, though.   I hope she has fun.  <br/>
<br/>
And then on Sunday the unschooling group is going to get together for a <br/>
picnic or barbecue and then we can REALLY talk about unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
The arrangements for this were fairly recent, but I wish I had put a notice <br/>
here sooner.  I kept forgetting.  And it&#39;s not a conference to really invite <br/>
doubting spouses or parents to.  I could be in for some flak or criticism, and <br/>
no doubt there will be a room full of revisionist propaganda and advice for <br/>
keeping kids down and small.   I will be a threat to the idea that of course <br/>
parents have to make kids learn  (etc.)<br/>
<br/>
-=- at the door it will be $25/single and $35/family-=-<br/>
<br/>
Too much just to hear the unschoolers, I think. But I&#39;m glad to get to meet <br/>
more unschoolers and maybe help them out.<br/>
