<div id="ygrps-yiv-352562413">Dear List,<br/>
I really feel bad for going off the other day. I let my emotions run ahead of <br/>
my brain. I don&#39;t know how many times I have cautioned others to avoid <br/>
getting too involved or personal with their posts. (not that that is always a <br/>
bad thing, but not often a good thing either.) I am very sorry, especially <br/>
for my closing statement of &quot;Good-bye to the nastiness. Good-bye to all.&quot; <br/>
Very melodramatic, Scarlet O&#39;Harish, on my part. I really should have taken a <br/>
day or more to cool off, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have even felt the need to <br/>
respond to that particular post. Most times, I do just that. I read a post <br/>
that angers me, I put it aside and come back later to reread it and look at <br/>
it more objectively. In this case I haven&#39;t reread the (inferred) post, I <br/>
reread my own. It was, in short, crap. Sure, we all get our feelings hurt, <br/>
but we don&#39;t all act like I did, and for that I am very sorry. I still think <br/>
I need to take a break, and I will. Many of you have written (very nicely and <br/>
I thank you all for your kind words.) to ask me to reconsider unsubscribing. <br/>
I haven&#39;t, but I will remain on lurking status for awhile, for my own good. &lt;g<br/>
