<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182814091">***That maybe one thing that was good about public school is that kids<br/>
have to work things out with kids they don&#39;t get along with and that<br/>
prepares them for getting along with co-workers they don&#39;t like later.<br/>
***<br/>
 <br/>
How?<br/>
<br/>
Adults don&#39;t  (successfully) use five year old skills to solve a problem<br/>
with a nasty co-worker.   ( &quot;Oh, yeah? Well you&#39;re UGLY!&quot;)   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just silly.   <br/>
<br/>
And, for your childs sake I hope she comes to adulthood believing with<br/>
all her heart that she never *has* to put up with stupid people, that she<br/>
*always* has a choice about which people will be in her life and which<br/>
won&#39;t and that she knows no one ever has the right to make her miserable.<br/>
<br/>
The best way for a child to learn to cope with nasty people is to help<br/>
them understand they don&#39;t have to.<br/>
Nasty people never have to have a minute of your time if you don&#39;t let<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
School prepares children to accept mistreatment as normal.   That&#39;s some<br/>
seriously twisted psychology and doesn&#39;t need to happen to kids who don&#39;t<br/>
go to school. <br/>

&quot;They have to learn about the real world,&quot; crap.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s code for, &quot; Children have to learn that they are powerless, I was <br/>
powerless as a child, and I turned out ok.&quot;  No, they didn&#39;t, not really, but <br/>
that&#39;s besides the point, right?  <br/>
<br/>
ARGH!!!  <br/>
<br/>
And then people wonder why they&#39;re NOT HAPPY!?!  <br/>
<br/>
End of rant. <br/>
