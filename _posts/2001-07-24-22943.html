<div id="ygrps-yiv-601877534">But who was that message FROM? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on several yahoogroups lists.  Sometimes a piece of mail doesn&#39;t make it <br/>
through (not just to AOL, to various people spottily), but it does seem to be <br/>
working out okay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; For those of you who have AOL and have been having problems getting mail<br/>
from yahoogroups, this is the message that was sent to some yahoo list<br/>
owners.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sure that you have heard by now that AOL is not sending mail that<br/>
&gt; comes from Yahoogroups.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292251163">I have a Yahoo addy.....no mail at all yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
Mixed up chronologically mixed up posts other days. I<br/>
unsubbed from some lists and went to digest here and<br/>
there tring to smooth it out.  Still a mess. Once or<br/>
twice I clicked on &quot;save draft&quot; and had a personal<br/>
letter, that was in the composition stage, posted! But<br/>
not  on this list, I don&#39;t think.  <br/>
<br/>
Still, Yahoo is good about filtering spam.<br/>
<br/>
I have McAffee virus vurus protection.<br/>
