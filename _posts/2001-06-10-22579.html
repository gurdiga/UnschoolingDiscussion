<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270711956">Thanks to all who cleared up my confusion on the extra letters popping up in <br/>
my email! (seriously I thought I might have to get the puter checked) As a <br/>
lover of books, book stores and libraries, I am so jealous of those of you <br/>
that have a choice of libraries in your towns! We just have the one <br/>
city/county library and some outreach half buses, half RVs that carry books <br/>
too local small towns and communities called Bookmobiles.  I went over to <br/>
Hobby Lobby and picked up some fairly large canvas bags (unbleached about <br/>
20&quot;x30&quot; i guess) and brought them home, painted them all up with fabric <br/>
paints. I put my kids library cards in them and their books. We take them to <br/>
the library with us, and the books are supposedly to go back in the bags as <br/>
soon as the child is done reading. This works as long as i am the one to find <br/>
and pick up the books! For me, I carry a nice sized hemp basket but am <br/>
looking for something a bit more oblong... (another excuse for me to visit <br/>
Hobby Lobby! Oh and while I am here I think I will just pick up some more <br/>
scrapbooking supplies, and look at these brushes, I do so need some new paint <br/>
brushes, OHOHOH!!! and lookie! fabric is on sale!....) ~Nancy who has lost <br/>
her mind at the thought of going to the local craft store! :o)<br/>
