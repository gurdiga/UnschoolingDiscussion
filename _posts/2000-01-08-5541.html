<div id="ygrps-yiv-128586332">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago, we as a family returned home from a car journey which took us<br/>
from Portland, Oregon to Madison, Wisconsin and back.  We left the day after<br/>
Christmas.  The trip took us through the desert of Eastern Oregon, the<br/>
mountains of Northern Idaho and Montana, the Little Bighorn Battlefield<br/>
(site of Custer&#39;s Last Stand), Mt Rushmore, South Dakota and Southern<br/>
Minnesota.<br/>
<br/>
We met people, had many hours of interesting conversation, and enjoyed<br/>
unexpectedly good driving conditions.  We we&#39;re truly fortunate!!!!  I&#39;m<br/>
glad we drove, because if we had flown, we would have missed all of those<br/>
hours together and all of that beautiful scenery.  My younger brother who<br/>
lives in Wisconsin, and travels a lot for business, was most generous in<br/>
providing vouchers for us to stay in comfortable, warm, and clean motels<br/>
along the way.  Thank goodness for people like him.<br/>
<br/>
This experience helped me to imagine living on the road for more than just a<br/>
two week vacation.  At some point, I&#39;d like to take to the road for an<br/>
extended period of time.  The idea of becoming a hobo intrigues me<br/>
(http://www.hobo.com).   Actually, for the right person, at the right stage<br/>
of life, hoboism could be the perfect career.  It could be an ideal way to<br/>
learn while earning your keep; to broaden the mind by seeing the world and<br/>
making a living at the same time.  People who love to write or create works<br/>
of art could thrive in such an experience-rich lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
If learning and life experiences mean significantly more to you than<br/>
community status, a permanent address, or a mainstream level of creature<br/>
comforts, becoming a hobo could be a good career move.  There are plenty of<br/>
employers who are always looking for reliable seasonal workers.  Plus, some<br/>
people have skills which they can take anywhere and easily find a job.  For<br/>
instance, I&#39;m a professional cleaner by trade.  I&#39;m certain I could go<br/>
anywhere and get a job cleaning dirty toilets, or soiled carpets.    Perhaps<br/>
the pay wouldn&#39;t put me in the upper middle class income brackets, but after<br/>
the children are on their own, and we have substantial savings accumulated,<br/>
I&#39;m sure there would be a way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
One day while on our way home from Wisconsin, we listened to a fascinating<br/>
interview on a public radio station with the author Errol Lincoln Uys about<br/>
his new book &quot;Riding the Rails: Teenagers on the Move During the Great<br/>
Depression&quot;  (http://www.erroluys.com/frontpage.htm).   I&#39;m going to order<br/>
the book from the library.  Uys pointed out how many teenagers rode the<br/>
rails in search of work during the Depression.  On the whole, at that time<br/>
it wasn&#39;t a glamorous lifestyle, even though the element of adventure was<br/>
certainly an important factor.  For many of those young people, however,<br/>
their adolescent hoboism became the defining experience of their lives.<br/>
(Note:  I&#39;m not recommending this for teenagers of today.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one other site to look at (http://www.workersonwheels.com/wisdom.htm).<br/>
This is a great site about &quot;Workers on Wheels.&quot;  Be sure to read some of the<br/>
profiles.  For me all of this highlights just how many options there are<br/>
outside of the 9-5 work-a-day, teamplayer world into which society<br/>
conditions us to fit.<br/>
