<div id="ygrps-yiv-39339820">Oh, I am sooo glad that someone besides me has ranted about the non-playing<br/>
of this song.  There are several songs out there that are about violence<br/>
that haven&#39;t been silenced (Aerosmith&#39;s Janey&#39;s Got a Gun, the Martina<br/>
McBride song and many other&#39;s including the one about child abuse whose<br/>
name I can&#39;t remember) and none of them have been kept off the air.  This<br/>
drives me crazy!<br/>
<br/>
Particularly after the raising of the awareness level after &quot;Burning Bed&quot;<br/>
and the number of women it helped to wake up and claim control of their own<br/>
lives!<br/>
