I don&#39;t live in the U.K., but had a similar problem.  My son recently rode a<br/>
ski lift with some high schooled boys who were off school for a snow day.<br/>
(We go skiing every Tuesday, because every day is a snow day!)  Afterwards<br/>
he started asking me if he was going to go to high school (they told him he<br/>
Should).  Then he said he thought we should do more &quot;school&quot; because he&#39;s<br/>
worried about being uneducated!  The most helpful thing I could think of to<br/>
do was to try to explain certain aspects of unschooling to him.  We<br/>
discussed how memorizing facts for a test wasn&#39;t really education, and how<br/>
he&#39;s learning all the time-when we watch t.v. shows, read or listen to<br/>
books, have discussions about all kinds of topics and through play.  I<br/>
explained to him that some people think learing isn&#39;t really learning unless<br/>
there is a schedule involved, a teacher and a student, testing, grading,<br/>
etc.  Fortunately he knew better! We then discussed the fact that these boys<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to &quot;approve&quot; of homeschooling!  Could it be that they didn&#39;t<br/>
approve because they know nothing about homeschooling?  It&#39;s hard to form an<br/>
accurate opinion without all the facts.  Could it be that they were jealous?<br/>
They can&#39;t take off school and go skiing whenever they want.  And lastly we<br/>
discussed the question-Does it matter to us what they think?  (We think<br/>
not!)<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167267921">Why don&#39;t you just do school with him.  If he wants to keep it up, it is<br/>
what he wants. So you don&#39;t unschool him...is this a philosophy you are<br/>
commmited to regardless of how your child your child feels? (Rhetorical, I<br/>
know you aren&#39;t). Hunt down a few workbooks or textbooks, they can serve as<br/>
reference later if (and I say most likely when) he decides he prefers<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Voila...problem solved.<br/>
<br/>
Workbooks can be purchased fairly cheap, and some kids do enjoy them...try<br/>
ebay, half.com, amazon z shops etc. <br/>

be well,<br/>

I would just reassure him that the advertisements are directed at families <br/>
where the children are sneaking away from school and their parents are too <br/>
busy to know, and at families where there&#39;s nobody home when the kids come <br/>
home, so they could be dishonest and stay home instead of going to school.<br/>
<br/>
Tell him school is NOT very fun, and so lots of kids try to sneak away <br/>
(whatever your local term is for what at our school was called &quot;ditching&quot;).  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not talking about homeschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe show him some of the online stuff about homeschoolers in the UK so <br/>
he&#39;ll know there are LOTS of really busy homeschoolers and those aren&#39;t the <br/>
kids the government is trying to lure back to school.<br/>

<h4>Mom of All Seasons</h4>
<p><small><time>20 May 2005, at 11:10am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959923676">Hi everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Jamie, mom to nearly 10 year old DS. We&#39;re new to this RU lifestyle (2<br/>
1/2 years of school at home after PS-2nd gr in a private school) and I&#39;m in<br/>
need of some advice. <br/>
<br/>
My DS has clothes strewn about his room to the point that he&#39;s often runs<br/>
out of clothes. Some clothes are clean, some are dirty. I have always done<br/>
the laundry and don&#39;t in the least mind doing it (and no one is begging for<br/>
the job). I wash, dry, fold and put them in a pile on the dryer. We all take<br/>
our clothes and put them away (theoretically) as the need/desire suits us.<br/>
The problem is the inevitable &quot;I don&#39;t have any ***.&quot; So far, I&#39;ve been<br/>
saying, &quot;I did all the laundry that was in the laundry room yesterday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I should just pick up the dirty clothes as I do the laundry or<br/>
just leave it be. He often has some interesting outfits (shorts on very cold<br/>
days), and ends up stealing my socks, but in general doesn&#39;t seem bothered<br/>
by the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Advice?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
I just ask Will (11) to bring me his laundry.  I also provided a  really <br/>
large trash-can laundry vessel for his room (it had a Razorback on  it, and that&#39;s <br/>
the motif of his room).  We cut a hole in the top so he can  slam dunk the <br/>
laundry.  The laundry stays in there for the most  part.  <br/>
 <br/>
When his room gets really messy with laundry and legos and what-not on the  <br/>
floor, I&#39;ll ask him to go in and pick up *just* the laundry and it makes a  <br/>
difference in the way the room looks and feels.  He has a really tiny room,  just <br/>
9&#39; x 9&#39;, so picking it up once in a while is imperative, and it takes just  a <br/>
few minutes, too.  He recognizes that just picking up the laundry and  <br/>
dumping the trash-can laundry vessel down the stairs will help me and help him  get <br/>
his room back to a manageable existence.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s a problem to expect kids under, say, 14 to remember to put  <br/>
their laundry in the laundry room without being reminded.  (We don&#39;t have a  <br/>
laundry room.)  Eliminate the problem by making sure he has a cool and  convenient <br/>
place to put his dirty clothes, and then just ask him to bring it  down when <br/>
you need it.<br/>

<br/>
If you knew your husband needed something for the next day and you did <br/>
laundry and it wasn&#39;t there, would you just do the laundry without it?  If you had a <br/>
friend visiting and you knew she needed some particular thing washed, or that <br/>
she was out of the clean clothes she had brought, would you go and solicit <br/>
clothes to wash?  Without that extra step, it seems to me entrapment.  (Or <br/>
rather if I were to do that knowing that something important wasn&#39;t there, I would <br/>
be doing it with a spiteful or hostile air, and I just don&#39;t do it.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wonder if I should just pick up the dirty clothes as I do the laundry or<br/>

<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two choices.<br/>
You could say &quot;I need black clothes for this load,&quot; or &quot;Bring your socks and <br/>
underwear so I can wash them.&quot;   If you say it in the same happy voice you&#39;d <br/>
use if you were saying &quot;Come and help me eat this ice cream,&quot; won&#39;t he bring <br/>
you some clothes?  (Not if he&#39;s in the middle of a non-pausable game, or has a <br/>
friend over and they&#39;re in mid-hilarity.)<br/>
<br/>
-= He often has some interesting outfits (shorts on very cold<br/>
days)-=-<br/>
<br/>
How old his he?<br/>
What is the purpose of clothes? <br/>
What are your priorities?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me if it&#39;s cold and he doesn&#39;t have clean, warm clothes, that&#39;s a <br/>
problem.<br/>

Seems like the real problem is on the other end. What if you put his folded<br/>
clean clothes into his chest of drawers or closet so that the mixing up<br/>
didn&#39;t occur? Then hopefully putting the dirty stuff from the floor into the<br/>
hamper will be less onerous for whoever does it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166896610">What worked for us was to put a hamper in each boy&#39;s bedroom.  Actually, they&#39;re tall kitchen-size trashcans without lids.  It took a few weeks to get used to for the boys, and Dan (4) still doesn&#39;t always get his clothes in the hamper.  Then again, he doesn&#39;t always change clothes every day so he seldom runs out! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I would talk to your son about it.  Tell him you&#39;ve noticed that he sometimes runs out of clean clothes and you&#39;d like to help him find a solution.  Would it help him to have a hamper, or some other routine that gets his clothes in a place or container where you can find them for washing?  It may be that it just never occurred to him.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Jamie!  How nice to see someone I know IRL on this list -- wow!<br/>
<br/>
What would your son like you to do?  Have you asked him?<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I&#39;d pick up the clothes (unless my child didn&#39;t want me<br/>
to, for some reason).  If your son is in the room at the time, it&#39;s a<br/>
nice time to chat for a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
In my house, I also put away the clothes (well, and sometimes we dress<br/>
ourselves out of a laundry basket &lt;G&gt;).  I know I love the feeling of<br/>
opening a drawer and seeing a pile of clean folded shirts -- all my<br/>
choices in one place.  <br/>
<br/>
For my son (who doesn&#39;t get dressed even close to every day), I know<br/>
that it&#39;s a satisfying feeling for him, too, to have all his favorite<br/>
clothes clean and available in one place so that he can choose what<br/>
will make him feel really spiffy for that day.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re asking this because you&#39;re wondering if your<br/>
son should be expected to do some of the work or not.  I do think that<br/>
if we want our kids to learn how it can be pleasant to have some<br/>
orderliness in our household and in our lives, then we can model that<br/>
for them, and give that to them as a gift.  But kids really don&#39;t see<br/>
the messes and the dirty laundry in the same way that we do -- they<br/>
can appreciate the gift of a freshly vacuumed floor as a great place<br/>
to get out the Legos, but not until they&#39;re a bit older are they going<br/>
to make the connections as to the hows and whys of getting the floor<br/>
clean in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Yes, I meant to add that my 7-year-old son has a hamper in his room<br/>
(and loves to make baskets).  When I still find clothes on his floor,<br/>
it usually means that he wasn&#39;t sure if they were clean enough to wear<br/>
again or not, and he put them there out of indecision.  So I look them<br/>
over and sniff them, and if he&#39;s there, he sees what I&#39;m looking for<br/>
and has that information.<br/>

Open bins?  Smallish ones, and then you might just lay clothes in<br/>
there instead of folding them?  Hooks on the wall for favorite shirts,<br/>
pants, etc., or on the wall of the closet?<br/>

 <br/>
Someone around here or AOL posted once that their clothes never leave the  <br/>
laundry room unless they&#39;re on someone&#39;s back.  IOW, they put their clothes  <br/>
storage in the laundry room, and everyone changes in there, so no one ever has  <br/>
clothes in their room at all, except what they&#39;re wearing.<br/>
 <br/>
I think that&#39;s an excellent idea, if you have a laundry room.  That  doesn&#39;t <br/>
really answer your question, though.<br/>
 <br/>
One thing I do is limit the amount of clothes Will has to what will fit in  <br/>
his drawer.  (Since kids grow so fast, it&#39;s easy to cull out the too-smalls  <br/>
when you buy new undies.)  So there&#39;s one small drawer with his boxers  stacked <br/>
on top of each other, not folded, just laid out flat.  And then  there&#39;s only <br/>
the socks that can fit in the other small drawer.  Shorts in  the next drawer, <br/>
and his shorts are much longer now so I can only fit 4 or 5 in  there, and I <br/>
don&#39;t fold them small...just lay them out folded in half.   (The last drawer <br/>
holds all his baseball uniform shirts and hats from the 8  previous <br/>
seasons--we&#39;re saving them for his Hall of Fame display.   lol.)  His t-shirts are <br/>
hanging on hangers in the closet.  He has many  more t-shirts than anything else.  <br/>
Some are sentimental so we can&#39;t get rid  of them.  When he was smaller, he <br/>
could pull t-shirts off the hanger just  by yanking on the t-shirt.  <br/>
 <br/>
Pants are another matter.  I hang them on hangers because there&#39;s no  other <br/>
place.  But I still have to go dig them out of the closet for him  like I did <br/>
when he was short, because they get swallowed up by the  t-shirts.  If it were <br/>
my closet, I would have all the pants on one side and  all the t-shirts on <br/>
another.  But, he puts his own clothes away now and I&#39;m  not going to enforce <br/>
that for him.  So, when he needs a particular pair of  pants, I go upstairs and <br/>
dig them out.  I don&#39;t mind.  <br/>
 <br/>
My middle son could never stay organized.  He just had a big dresser  with <br/>
nothing folded at all.  I sorted his socks, undies, t-shirts and what  have you <br/>
into piles, and he just dumped them into the appropriate drawers.   It was <br/>
okay with him, so it was okay with me.  Ironically, his pants were  always hung <br/>
up neatly in the closet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I so wish my laundry room was big enough.<br/>
Here ds and I have a habit of just leaving the clean clothes in the <br/>
laundry baskets (we have a lot of them) until we need them.<br/>
Drives dh crazy.<br/>
Of course I leave clothes in the dryer and washing machine too long for <br/>
him to. He does his own laundry.<br/>
A few times a month I will feel the need to hang my clothes up because I <br/>
can&#39;t find something that I know is clean.<br/>
Once a month I&#39;ll go into Josh&#39;s room and help him put away his clothes <br/>
so I can see what he has. That is if dh has not freaked out on the boy <br/>
and made him put all his clothes away.<br/>
<br/>
The fabric clutter on the floor gets to me too and if I ask ds to pick <br/>
up his room (lots of times I&#39;ll just pick it up) he pretty much knows <br/>
that I would be happier if his clothes/blankets  went back in the <br/>
appropriate dirty clothes hamper or clothes basket or drawer or on his bed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sitting on a chair in my living room - looking at clean laundry -- <br/>
on the couch, on the coffee table, on the floor, on the ironing board <br/>
that is still up, on the back of the chair I&quot;m sitting in, in a laundry <br/>
basket on the dining table.  Looks like about 2/3 of it is folded.<br/>
<br/>
I think my family really would prefer to live in a nice big one-room <br/>
house. Apparently that now includes preferring to keep their laundry <br/>
out here, too, along with everything else.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m not recommending this as a storage system, but it IS an <br/>
option and I guess I should be open-minded about considering it. Let&#39;s <br/>
see - maybe we could assign areas of the room to different family <br/>
members?<br/>

That must be how people evolved from one room sod houses to multi-bedroom  <br/>
mansions?<br/>
 <br/>
I frankly try to create fail proof systems that keep things like this a  <br/>
no-brainer.  My mind works in these ways.  I live in a house full of  boys/men, <br/>
and if I can just tell them exactly what their next step is (If  I have clean <br/>
socks in my hand, then they must go in the drawer), they are  happier.  <br/>
 <br/>
I just wish they could learn the one that says, &quot;if the vacuum cleaner is  in <br/>
the middle of the floor, then turn it on and push it around the room&quot;.   lol.<br/>

<br/>
Our clean laundry stays in the dryer a long time and stays in the &quot;clean&quot; basket (tucked away in a not very conspicuous spot in our bedroom) for a really really long time.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s socks are the leading indicator for when we are about to run out of clean clothing.  Being small, they seem to work their way to the bottom of the hamper and seem to fall off the bottom of the armloads of clean laundry (back on to the laundry room floor where they disguise themselves as dirty laundry).<br/>
<br/>
Our clothes are not crisply unrumpled, um, ever, but we don&#39;t rise above the level of T-shirts and khakis, um, ever, either.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I watched CBS Sunday Morning like I try to do every week, and there was a  <br/>
story about a Hub Cap Annie in Denver, I think it was (there&#39;s a Hub Cap Annie  <br/>
place in lots of cities).  She just collects hub caps and sells them, and  <br/>
then there were people who just collected them and hung them on the fence or  <br/>
whatever.<br/>
 <br/>
I began to wonder if I could become a Lost Sock Annie?  What if  you could <br/>
gather up all the unmatched socks in the world and make a ramshackle  store <br/>
where people could buy mates to their socks?  What else could you  collect?<br/>
