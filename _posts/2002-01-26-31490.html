<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754707877">&lt;&lt;Is this &quot;lame&quot; or cool&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would think &quot;cool&quot;.  You talked with your kids and they are calling the<br/>
shots.  Of course, what happens if game time goes up and the kids get grumpy<br/>
again?  Do you gently point out that last time, the kids thought it was too<br/>
much game time, or do you march in and snatch the joystick out of their<br/>
hands?  That I think is the key.<br/>
<br/>
I finally came to my senses about TV about a year ago.  For months, the<br/>
oldest sat on her fanny and watched re-runs.  Drove me insane but I bit my<br/>
lip.  Then the fighting and arguing started.  We had a talk and oldest said<br/>
she feels better when she doesn&#39;t watch so much TV.  She monitors herself.<br/>
This morning, she and the 8yo spent Saturday morning cartoon time playing<br/>
chess in another room.  Still, sometimes she spends an entire day on the<br/>
couch, primarily when she is tired and needs to refresh herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563261299">&lt;&lt;I like to be the bad guy :) It makes me feel like I&#39;m doing my job&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I realize that this was a rather flippant remark, but I think it is very<br/>
crucial to the success of unschooling.  How do we see our &quot;job&quot;?  Are we<br/>
supporters and facilitators?  Are we co-conspirators in the joy of living?<br/>
Or are we on another team than our kids are on?  Are we working against them<br/>
rather than with them?  Who is in charge of us? of the kids?  Vital<br/>
questions.<br/>
