<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495450434">Hi,<br/>
My name is Mark, I&#39;m a 39 year old divorced father of 2, and I am <br/>
homeschooling my 11 year old son this year. His mother is a Waldorf <br/>
School teacher, and he&#39;s been in the school since Kindergarten. His <br/>
class no longer has a teacher, so I am pursuing my ideal of <br/>
homeschooling. His mother is stuck on the Waldorf thing, and I value a <br/>
lot of what it has given to him. But I&#39;m curious about the unschooling <br/>
concept. Does anyone out there have any experience with Waldorf <br/>
Education, and the comparison between the two approaches?<br/>
<br/>
I expect that I would not be able to convince his mother to allow me <br/>
to completely abandon the school approach. Any suggestions as to how <br/>
to &#39;undermine&#39; it?</div>

<br/>
I read a book recently called _Coloring Outside the Lines (by Roger Schenk,<br/>
I think), that talked about how to have well-educated children in spite of<br/>
sending them to school.  However, it doesn&#39;t address how to have *free*<br/>
children.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But I <br/>
 think it would be virtually impossible to do in a healthy way without at <br/>
 least some agreement and cooperation from the other parent (in my family&#39;s <br/>
 case, two other parents) AND the child.<br/>
