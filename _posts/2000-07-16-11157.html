My mother grew up on a dair farm. Her family was<br/>
finacially strapped, but because of their business<br/>
they had fresh milk every morning and home grown steak<br/>
for dinner almost every night. Today the meat  you buy<br/>
at the store has who knows what in it and may not even<br/>
be the type of meat you think you are paying for. But<br/>
a few years ago my mom decided to raise her own cow<br/>
for slauter. I am telling  you that meat was the best<br/>
meat I have ever tasted and there wasn&#39;t one ounce of<br/>
fat on it. You actually had to put some greese in the<br/>
pan to keep the  meat from sticking. I buy the leanest<br/>
meat I can find, around 92%, and I don&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about the meat sticking. I guess what I&#39;m saying is<br/>
that you can eat meat and still go natural just buy<br/>
raising your own beef. I think mom said it cost her<br/>
about $1.50/lb for the meat she got off the cow, abt<br/>
400lb. That included the cost of raising and<br/>
slautering it. Oh and don&#39;t forget the meat you buy at<br/>
the store if full of steroids.   Corallyn<br/>

<br/>
If you were eating 75% raw and one day you felt like a chicken salad, you <br/>
would of course cook your chicken (no salmonella for me thanks &lt;gg&gt;) and<br/>
toss a couple of ounces into you greens and veggies.  The rest of your day <br/>
would probably have consisted of fruits and other vegetables.  I have not<br/>
nor do I think I could ever be 100% raw.  Same goes for if I want a <br/>
vegetable sandwich.  The grains would be baked and the uncooked veggies<br/>
would go in the middle.  Same with beans, they are also processed.  The<br/>
only thing you could eat raw would be fruit, veggie and nuts.  Am I making<br/>
more sense?  oh it just dawned on me, raw cow or goat milk is acceptable<br/>
also if you are not vegan.  Of course you either have your own goat/cow<br/>
or have a very trustworthy source.  There was a guy who wrote several<br/>
juicing books, raw foodist, and he also incorporated raw goat milk into his<br/>
diet.  Wonderful man, can&#39;t think of his name, lived to be 106 or something<br/>
like that, in good health up until his death.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689899598">We moved out to the country late last year. One of the<br/>
things I plan to do on our 6acres is to raise a beef<br/>
cow. 400lb is a lota meat...and much cheaper and<br/>
better for you. I also want to have an herb garden and<br/>
a veggie garden. I would like to keep a milk cow for 1<br/>
year just so I can say that I know how to care for a<br/>
milk cow. From what I have heard it is a big<br/>
responsability, I think the kids would enjoy it.<br/>

independant, though.   Corallyn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570297519">I would suggest that the reporter go back to school.  Most ground beef is a<br/>
combination of Australian bull meat (nice red color and little or no fat)<br/>
and scraps or trimmings from breaking a beef.  For example, it is no longer<br/>
popular to leave the &quot;tail&quot; on a t-bone steak.  The tail goes in the<br/>
hamburger.  When you break a beef (cut it into smaller sections from the<br/>
1/4&#39;s it arrives in), there are parts to the round, chuck, neck, and<br/>
sirloin tip area that are not sold as steaks or used as stew meat or the<br/>
old fashioned &quot;cube&quot; steak.  That is your hamburger.  Beef is much cheaper<br/>
to buy than pork.   You can buy utility grade fores for about 1/4 to 1/2<br/>
the price of a hanging half or whole carcass hog.  If you added a &quot;white&quot;<br/>
meat (pork or turkey) to your hamburger you would get an anemic looking<br/>
hamburger.  Also, hamburger is sent through the grinder twice, something<br/>
you can&#39;t do with pork unless you want a real nasty greasy looking mess.<br/>
<br/>
The only way there could have been a problem is if the grinder was used<br/>
without a complete breakdown after the buther made his sausage or ground<br/>
pork.  Had he allowed it to sit around or did not clean it properly, then<br/>
you would have a problem.  But, if you read your papers, you will find that<br/>
most, if not all of the food poisoning cases come from ground beef that is<br/>
mass produced and all the recalls have come from these mass production<br/>
folks, as have all the deaths from e-coli.<br/>
<br/>
As to name brands being &quot;what you pay for,&quot; that is a myth.  It is the big<br/>
names that just finished paying back bucko bucks in fines because they were<br/>
selling utility grade beef as prime, who were using special lights and food<br/>
coloring to make the cuts of meat appealing and who were watering their<br/>
hamburger inorder to get more money.  It is also the major brands that were<br/>
putting kangaroo meat in their hamburger.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to trichinosis.  The symptoms are not even vaguely like e-coli<br/>
(Symptoms:Âdiarrhea that is acute, bloody and severe Âvomiting (although<br/>
rare) Âloss of appetite Âabdominal pain so severe it is compared with<br/>
labor.)  In fact, there are no symptoms until usually 8 to 15 days after<br/>
eating the meat with the earliest being 5 days and the outside being 45<br/>
days.  The symptoms usually start with fever, muscle soreness, pain and<br/>
swelling around the eyes. Thirst, profuse sweating, chills, weakness and<br/>
tiredness may develop. Chest pain may be experienced since the parasite may<br/>
become imbedded in the diaphragm (the thin muscle separating the lungs from<br/>
abdominal organs.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, for the unschooling tidbit for the day, in California (and probably the<br/>
rest of the states since it is all the same union), a butcher has to go to<br/>
school and learn all about disease that may be transmitted to humans from<br/>
meat, sterilization techniques and then must apprentise with a journeyman<br/>
butcher.  However, the folks that do the slaughtering and the mass<br/>
producing are only &quot;helpers&quot; and do not need to go to school.<br/>

&gt; There was a story in the news here a few years ago<br/>
&gt; about a man who had a bar-b-q and cooked his hamberger<br/>
&gt; med rare. Well, he got extremely ill. Come to find out<br/>
&gt; it wasn&#39;t the beaf that made him ill but the rare pork<br/>
&gt; and other meats that the store had mixed in with the<br/>
&gt; beef and sold as beef. The reporter went on to say<br/>
&gt; that this is usually only aproblem that local, i.e.<br/>
&gt; stores that grind their own meat, butchers do to save<br/>
&gt; money and that if you buy the name brand you are most<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644518670">This is something I&#39;ve thought about, not in terms of caring for one <br/>
myself, but would it be feasible to milk cows more often than the <br/>
usual dawn and dusk scenario?  As someone interested in <br/>
breastfeeding and therefore lactation generally, I wonder if it would <br/>
make more milk/ creamier milk?  and whether it would be practical <br/>
to round up the cows three times a day instead of two.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some farmers do just that, mainly big farms that have enough <br/>
animals to be able to afford to employ people.   It does increase <br/>
their production therefore increases $$$$$ but for these poor <br/>
animals that are just a factory to the farmers it may not make life <br/>
any better.   I have seen a farm locally where they remove the <br/>
calves tails so that the cows aren&#39;t as likely to splatter you-know-<br/>
what all over the place in the milking parlor.<br/>
<br/>
Most cows don&#39;t need to be rounded up, they just head for the <br/>
barn, and in big dairy operations they are often not far from the barn <br/>
anyway, they are often kept in small muddy crappy areas with no <br/>
access to pasture.<br/>
<br/>
Our cattle live on a pile of grass, wood chips & leaves which is <br/>
about 100&#39; long 30&#39; wide and up to 15&#39; high, this is all dumped here <br/>
by local gardeners and tree trimmers.   In winter they would prefer <br/>
to be on the pile than in the barn as it heats from the composting <br/>
action.  In spring, summer and fall [except in really wet weather] <br/>
they have access  to several acres of pasture but seem to prefer to <br/>
be up in the yard waiting for people to bring them fresh grass <br/>
clippings.<br/>
<br/>
Small is beautiful in farming, the bigger a farm gets the more <br/>
inhumane the treatment of the animals often becomes.  They are <br/>
no longer animals, just machines there to produce a product.  Last <br/>
year when the power went out after a big storm a pig factory near <br/>
here lost hundreds of animals, without the huge fans going to <br/>
remove the stale air toxic gasses built up and killed all the pigs in <br/>
the confinement housing.<br/>
<br/>
To see pigs living in these places is sickening, to know that these <br/>
are intelligent creatures and being kept in small prison cells with <br/>
nothing to do is very sad.  I love to watch our two sows as they go <br/>
about their days, rooting through the ground in search of some <br/>
buried treasure, digging mud puddles with those amazing noses, <br/>
loafing in the pond on hot days and building thick straw nests for <br/>
themselves when the weather turns cool.   Just yesterday we gave <br/>
our two five week old piglets a whole bale of hay to play with, they <br/>
have been busily going through it, eating the oats and making a <br/>
bed with some of the straw, it was cool last night, and they <br/>
probably made themselves very cosy. <br/>

&gt; $30 for it. She got it as a new born, I think it was<br/>
&gt; no more than a week old. I plan to do something<br/>
&gt; simmilar for my beef cow. Later I plan to have the<br/>
&gt; milk cow. I have never had goats milk and have heard<br/>
&gt; opposing views on the flavor. I have considered a goat<br/>
&gt; instead but don&#39;t know much about them. Are there<br/>
&gt; stores that sell goats milk so I could try it before I<br/>
&gt; make a decission on an animal?   Corallyn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>$30 is a good price for a calf, we wouldn&#39;t let one go under $120, <br/>
that is if we were selling.   We buy holstien calves at the sales <br/>
barn and pay between $15 [new-born and very shaky looking so no-<br/>
one else bid on him] to $145.   You can get bargain basement <br/>
calves, and sometimes they thrive.     <br/>
If you are raising a beef animal, why not raise the daisy heifer at <br/>
the same time, by the time she has a calf two years will have <br/>
passed and your children will be older, but you may not want to <br/>
give her up after raising her.   You can always plan to dry up your <br/>
cow before going on vacation, that way she won&#39;t have to be milked <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
On goats I find that the milk is quite palatable, but if you want to try <br/>
goat milk befoer getting a goat, do NOT buy canned or powdered <br/>
milk, they are both disgusting and will turn you right off goat milk.   <br/>
Maybe you could find someone with goats and buy some fresh <br/>
milk to get an even better idea of what your goat&#39;s milk would taste <br/>
like, any processing at all changes the taste.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003250247">Here is the info about brucillosis:<br/>
&lt;&lt;Brucella, the bacterium, and brucellosis, the disease, are serious<br/>
problems<br/>
to people who eat meat, drink milk, and handle animals.<br/>
<br/>
Bovine brucella (in cattle) causes undulant fever in humans.<br/>
You can get this from drinking milk which has not been pasturized, getting<br/>
blood or other body fluids from infected cattle into wounds, or by handling<br/>
or eating raw meat or improperly cooked meat from an infected animal.<br/>
<br/>
Caprine brucella (in goats) causes, according to my local veterinarian,<br/>
death in humans. The mother of one of his friends died from drinking<br/>
unpasturized goat&#39;s milk.<br/>
<br/>
This same vet got brucellosis from an infected bovine while he was serving<br/>
as a USDA meat inspector. He said he was fine when he went to work, started<br/>
to drive home that afternoon and pulled over to the side of the road sick<br/>
as could be. He had to wait for someone to help him home because he was too<br/>
weak to drive.<br/>
<br/>
Brucellosis can kill. It usually just makes you feel sick enough to wish<br/>
you were dead! ;-) A friend of mine contracted brucellosis while on a tour<br/>
of Russia. He presumes he drank unpasturized milk.<br/>
<br/>
Brucellosis can be treated with antibiotics and supportive nursing.<br/>
<br/>
My state, South Carolina, has been brucella free for decades. There are<br/>
stringent rules about any chattel (goats included) having to be blood<br/>
tested for brucella before being transported into the state. The<br/>
neighboring state, Georgia and Florida, were not brucella free when I was<br/>
still in the dairy business. All milk sold in stores is pasturized<br/>
sufficiently to kill the bacteria. Every load of milk leaving a dairy farm<br/>
in a commercial truck is tested for brucella, as well as several other<br/>
infectious conditions, like campylobacter, tb, and others.<br/>
<br/>
If you are buying unpasturized milk, I would know my supplier. If you are<br/>
drinking your own cow&#39;s or goat&#39;s unpasturized milk, a blood test is not<br/>
expensive and is worthwhile for peace of mind. We had our animals tested,<br/>
even though the state is brucella free, once. Then we did not test again<br/>
unless we brought new animals on the farm.<br/>
<br/>
Symptoms in humans: fever which rises and falls through the day<br/>
weakness including shaking<br/>
muscle and joint pain<br/>
headache<br/>
<br/>
Under a microscope, the bacteria can be seen in the blood.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560945037">The disease is referred to as Bangs amonst cattlemen.  It is also known as<br/>
contagious spontanious or epizoodic abortion.  In humans it was also known<br/>
as Mediterranean or Malta (where it was first recognized) fever.<br/>
<br/>
It affects all ruminants--cattle, swine, bison, reindeer, cariboo, deer.  It<br/>
has also been reported in dogs and coyotes.  44 states are disease free and<br/>
the other six have a less than .25% rate on tested herds.  There use to be<br/>
100s of thousands of infected herds but as of 2000 there were only 6<br/>
infected herds left.<br/>
<br/>
There is a vaccination for bangs that has been very successful in helping to<br/>
eliminate this disease.<br/>
<br/>
Brucellosis in humans is rarely fatal with less than 2% of UNTREATED cases<br/>
resulting in death.  Most cases (80%) are cured within a year.  Some become<br/>
chronic.<br/>
<br/>
There are only about 100 cases a year in the U.S. and a lot of those were<br/>
acquired while folks were traveling, particularly to Mexico where they sell<br/>
unpasterized goat milk and cheese.<br/>
<br/>
Now, TB is a whole other story with about 18,000 cases a year but those are<br/>
rarely from milk but brought here by refugees.<br/>
<br/>
As to testing, the blood test for animals is one way but for milk you do a<br/>
ring test.  If I were going to drink raw milk from animals I raised, I do<br/>
both tests.<br/>
