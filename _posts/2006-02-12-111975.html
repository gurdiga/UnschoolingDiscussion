<div id="ygrps-yiv-163191798">This &quot;teach one word&quot; discussion reminds me of when my<br/>
son was learning to recognize numbers.<br/>
<br/>
We went for a walk and he noticed the numbers on<br/>
houses. He was amazed that a 2 could have a loop or<br/>
not and still be a 2, or that a 3 could have a pointy<br/>
bit or be all curved and still be a 3. And a 4, my<br/>
goodness! It could look like a triangle or not, and<br/>
still be a 4! Wow! <br/>
<br/>
We ended up talking about what was the essential (and<br/>
yes, I defined that word for him and we used it in our<br/>
discussion) shape of each number and how much<br/>
variation could take place and yet we could still<br/>
recognize it as that number.<br/>
<br/>
And that led to noticing differences in cars, dogs,<br/>
chairs, but we still knew that they were, in fact,<br/>
cars, dogs and chairs. Then I told him about a<br/>
philosopher named Plato who wondered about this very<br/>
same thing--the Pure Form of a thing. <br/>
<br/>
We came home and looked at different fonts on the<br/>
computer. He saw that letters could be played with<br/>
this way, too.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool discussion to have with a 3yo!<br/>

least, right?<br/>
<br/>
But, no. When I was first learning some Farsi, my husband showed me  <br/>
letters and numbers - and I got frustrated that other people&#39;s  <br/>
letters and numbers didn&#39;t look like HIS! I remember saying, &quot;But you  <br/>
said it looked like THIS!&quot; &lt;G&gt; And I also had to figure out what the  <br/>
&quot;essence&quot; of each letter and number was, in order to recognize them  <br/>
when they didn&#39;t look just like his. So - I have had that experience  <br/>
as an adult and it makes me all the more amazed at how easily kid&#39;s  <br/>
brains sort through all that (usually) without even being consciously  <br/>
aware of it.<br/>

collection of good parts from this discussion, and found some  <br/>
illustrations for Meg&#39;s writing about the different-appearances of  <br/>
numerals.<br/>

There&#39;s a book a book called Philosophy and the Young Child.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not a long book, and it&#39;s not hoity or difficult at all.  The word  <br/>
&quot;philosophy&quot; scares people away sometimes, but most of what we  <br/>
discuss on this list is philosophy.  &quot;To study philosophy&quot; in school  <br/>
is to study names and dates and to maybe learn to read German.  It&#39;s  <br/>
the history of &quot;professional&quot; philosophers, not the study of what  <br/>
philosophy itself is in everyday life.  Probably  most people  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t think their everyday lives have anything to do with  <br/>
philosophy, and so the book can be VERY very world opening for parents.<br/>
