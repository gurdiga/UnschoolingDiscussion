Not if it were something the child(ren) wanted to see. What image (that  <br/>
they <br/>
would want to watch) would be so &quot;unpeaceful&quot; that I would need to  <br/>
censor? <br/>
and justify?<br/>

<br/>
Sex, blood, gore, violence, murdering folks, raping folks, porn etc...  Of course, I am thinking on young child terms (lets say under 10).  This is part of my concern in allowing my daughter to watch whatever she wants.  It is not that I shelter her from the knowledge that these things exist, but I limit her exposure to what she can understand and emotionally handle.<br/>
<br/>
I can remember the first time I saw a movie where a woman got raped in front of her son and I had to ask what &quot;rape&quot; meant.  I vomited, and to this very day it is emotionally disturbing to me.  I still have images of violent porn that I was exposed to (or &quot;allowed&quot; to decide to watch) at young ages in my head.  I loved alien stuff, but watched/read so much that it freaks me out now.  I don&#39;t know how that can be considered &quot;healthy&quot;, and often wish that my mother or someone would have paid enough attention to me to step in and monitor what I was reading and seeing.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you do about that?  What do you do if your child sees or hears about something like that and wants to see it for themselves?<br/>
<br/>
Curious...  <br/>

Alert! Alert! That last sentence was the most telling!<br/>
 <br/>
No one here is suggesting that your child watch tv in a vacuum. We suggest  <br/>
that you be there WITH your child. Pay ATTENTION to your child. Be with her,  <br/>
watch with her, answer her questions, ask her questions.<br/>
 <br/>
Even YOU wish for that same thing.<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m there. And he knows he can turn it off if he wants to. He knows we can  <br/>
talk about it before, during, and after and after and after.<br/>
 <br/>
Big difference.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is part of my concern in allowing my daughter to watch whatever she<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you&#39;re saying she wants to see &quot;Sex, blood, gore, violence, murdering<br/>
folks, raping folks, porn&quot; and that you are preventing her? How does she<br/>
know she wants to see those things?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I limit her exposure to what she can understand and emotionally<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you want to be exposed to things you find upsetting and can&#39;t emotionally<br/>
handle? Would you want to be sitting watching a movie and have your husband<br/>
keep silent about an upcoming scene he knew would upset you?<br/>
<br/>
If there were a movie you&#39;d heard good things about and wanted to see would<br/>
you want your husband to say &quot;No, you can&#39;t see that,&quot; and stop you from<br/>
watching it or &quot;I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a violent rape scene and I know you don&#39;t<br/>
like such scenes,&quot; and then let you decide? The first removes control from<br/>
you, puts the decision power in his hands. The second gives you some<br/>
information to help make your own decision or to find out more.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not advocating giving kids information and then shrugging your<br/>
shoulders when they make a different decision than you&#39;d want them to.<br/>
They&#39;re going to want to want to test their personal boundaries to see what<br/>
they&#39;re capable of handling and we need them to know we&#39;ll be there to<br/>
support them while they explore.)<br/>
<br/>
If we give our kids the idea we&#39;re trying to protect them from the world and<br/>
protect them from their own under-developed powers of judgement, they&#39;ll<br/>
resent being told &quot;No, you don&#39;t want to see that,&quot; since it means you&#39;re<br/>
taking the power to decide away from them. But if we build a sense of trust<br/>
in them that they understand we&#39;re trying to help them see what they want to<br/>
see and avoid what they want to avoid, they&#39;ll hear &quot;No, you don&#39;t want to<br/>
see that,&quot; as trusted advice. I&#39;d also tell my daughter why, but I&#39;d leave<br/>
the decision up to her. If she decided to watch anyway, I&#39;d be there with<br/>
her to pause or fast forward or talk about it or turn it off and find<br/>
something else to do, or whatever would help her tackle something that might<br/>
be a little difficult for her. If she decides she&#39;s ready to test her wings,<br/>
I&#39;ll happily stand under her with a net. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve knee jerk said &quot;No you have to go to class,&quot; when she doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
see the afternoon spent on a lot of driving for a 1 hour class. And she then<br/>
*really* doesn&#39;t want to go. But when I realize what I&#39;ve said and tell her<br/>
of course she doesn&#39;t have to go, she thinks about it and generally decides<br/>
she&#39;ll go. She doesn&#39;t want to do the things she &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot;. (Not going to<br/>
a class isn&#39;t a good example of a &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; but I can&#39;t think of a better<br/>
one at the moment.) What she does want is to have the choice.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t want to do things that are bad for them. But they often will do<br/>
things they don&#39;t want to do because they aren&#39;t given the choice. Kids have<br/>
been known to sit through a horror movie that disturbs them if they think<br/>
that this is the only chance they&#39;ll ever get to watch it, that if they turn<br/>
it off or if they end up with nightmares, mom will say she was right to not<br/>
want them to watch it and she&#39;ll never let them see something she feels<br/>
uncomfortable about again.<br/>
<br/>
But if they know they can watch whatever they want, that mom will do her<br/>
best to give them information if she knows something might be disturbing,<br/>
and they know they can turn it off at any time, and that mom will be there<br/>
to help them, they&#39;ll learn to listen to what their feelings are inside of<br/>
them to help them make decisions. It&#39;s way better than basing decisions on<br/>
what someone else says they are feeling or will feel.<br/>
