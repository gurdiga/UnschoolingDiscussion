&lt;&lt; We as a nation can bomb the heck out of women and children, but we can <br/>
 neither hear, read, speak or write &quot;fuck.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Amen to that!<br/>
And it seems the people that are most supportive of bombing other folks are <br/>
the ones most upset by cuss words.<br/>
I admit to cringing when I hear certain cuss words. I KNOW it&#39;s a societal <br/>
thing, I KNOW it&#39;s my upbringing, but it bugs me.<br/>
I don&#39;t punish my kids for using them, I don&#39;t act all hypersensitive, but it <br/>
does bug me.<br/>
Trevor told me yesterday that he loves to cuss around his friends cuz he <br/>
knows I don&#39;t like it much.<br/>
He&#39;ll say Ass and Damn and Hell here, but I always say &quot;do you HAVE to use <br/>
those words in front of Sierra and Jalen?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, if my sensibilities can handle a DISCUSSION of words (it&#39;s not like <br/>
anybody was getting cussed AT) I just don&#39;t see what the big deal is.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find this whole line of discussion so very fascinating.  Wow, the <br/>
power of words!  That really hits home how powerful is language.  <br/>
It&#39;s really just so amazing what words do to us.  It seems to me <br/>
that it is one thing if someone shouts a distasteful word at you.  <br/>
In that case, the power behind the word is also that person&#39;s energy <br/>
propelling the word at you.  Often just that alone will cause you to <br/>
react.  I mean, if someone says f*** you, and means it, they usually <br/>
have a lot of energy and emotion packed into that and it hits you <br/>
hard.  But here, on this e-mail list, we have simply been pointing <br/>
out words, in e-mail format, no less.  No sound bites or anything.  <br/>
Just a list of words.  Where&#39;s the energy?  Email is getting very <br/>
powerful, isn&#39;t it?  In this case, with the cuss words, no one was <br/>
actually directing them at a single soul.  Just pointing out words <br/>
that, if someone were new to this planet, or in this case, new to <br/>
this country, they might consider with care before directing at <br/>
anyone.  I found it to be pretty much like a guide book -- &quot;when in <br/>
America, do not say this&quot; type thing.  Not offensive in the least.  <br/>
In a very real way, it&#39;s the same kind of recommendation we would <br/>
offer to a child -- &quot;here are a list of words that are out there, <br/>
that you might consider carefully before using.  In all likelihood <br/>
you would very much offend someone if you directed any one of them <br/>
at someone personally.&quot;  Not actually commanding them not to say <br/>
something.  Just pointing out what is.  You can find pretty much all <br/>
of the words I saw listed here in an unabridged dictionary, can&#39;t <br/>
you?  Or at least a dictionary that includes American slang.  <br/>
There&#39;s no emotion packed behind them.  Why would someone react so <br/>
strongly to a written word that is simply within a whole list of <br/>
words?  That, I find very curious.  If language is such that it can <br/>
cause people to get all in a hullaballoo, there is power!  Imagine <br/>
what you can do with your words!  You can write stuff down and <br/>
really affect people.  Even in just a list form, it appears.  It <br/>
occurs to me that email has become as real as saying something to <br/>
someone in person.  Maybe even more so, if people can get so <br/>
aggitated by words not even spoken aloud.  They are imagining the <br/>
words out loud!  THAT is powerful.  Wow!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this particular thread, for the above reasons, was rather <br/>
enlightening for me.  I feel I got a little bit of learning there.  <br/>
Rather than condemn the folks who brought it forth, I&#39;d like to say <br/>
thanks.  That was cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235404131">When my sweet Grammy was alive, she would play poker every Wednesday night<br/>
with her sisters and cronies.  I would sometimes go over as a young teen to<br/>
keep their drinks full.  (cheap coffee brandy or wine) One of my great<br/>
aunts, in her 90&#39;s now, once said when she had to go pee, &quot;I have to go<br/>
water my horse!&quot;  I remember hearing it that first time and wondering what<br/>
the heck she was talking about.  Then they got talking about cancer and all<br/>
the things that you can get cancer from.  My lovely grammy, who I never even<br/>
heard cuss before said, &quot;Pretty soon you won&#39;t even be able to powder your<br/>
p*ssy without getting cancer.&quot;  I almost died laughing right there.  It was<br/>
a side of my Grammy that I am glad I got a peak at before she died.  <br/>

LOL!!! That&#39;s too funny. I think that&#39;s one of the funniest things. When <br/>
someone older and unexpected or really too young to understand comes out <br/>
with a word like that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is funny, thanks for sharing.  My Grammy who was the light of my <br/>
horrible childhood used swear words just like every day words as if THAT WAS <br/>
THE WORD that everyone else used and if they looked at her funny it was THEIR <br/>
problem.  She didn&#39;t use the &quot;really bad&quot; F one as she called it, but others <br/>
came spilling out of her mouth and for some reason it didn&#39;t even seem in an <br/>
ugly way, they were only words to her and not meant to be distasteful or <br/>
mean.  She was 89 when she died three years ago and she did get some looks in <br/>
the store or doctors office or even the hospital when she had &quot;normal&quot; (to <br/>
her) conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Of course my mother the &quot;saint&quot; who would go balistic if we said &quot;butt&quot; has <br/>
quite the mouth on her but it&#39;s in a mean nasty type of way and not at all <br/>
cute... but she&#39;s like that in every aspect of life, mean nasty, so I guess <br/>
it&#39;s got something to do with more than just the actual WORD?<br/>
