The list of things Americans don&#39;t say did get too rough.  Sorry.  <br/>
I&#39;d like to blame Shyrley because she&#39;s English and she asked the question, <br/>
but <br/>
I didn&#39;t tone down my response.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
But this is proof that even among adults, even when answering another <br/>
person&#39;s question about what is and isn&#39;t acceptable, there are Americans who <br/>
can&#39;t abide those words AT ALL, not even a little.  One of the worst crimes <br/>
in the United States is bad language, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
That means the South Park Movie is profoundly right in their message.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Joyce, is this acceptable?<br/>
I cannot believe this is on unschooling. com.  <br/>
I need to verification that this is acceptable here.&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just intrigued as too why. Part of our unschooling adventure has been learning why the Americans and British are so wildly different. My kids spent ages reading up on the American flag cos it seems<br/>
so important here. Our flag ain&#39;t.<br/>
