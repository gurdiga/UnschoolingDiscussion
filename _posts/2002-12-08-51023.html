Why not start now?  You sound like unschooling has a lot of appeal to you,<br/>
and the school is good and nice, but your son doesn&#39;t like going there.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t require you to set up a classroom, prepare your space,<br/>
or anything like that.  You could start tomorrow (although your son might<br/>
like waiting until after the holiday parties at school are over!)  The<br/>
longer you spend in school, the longer you&#39;ll de-school.  If you start now,<br/>
he won&#39;t wonder all summer if you&#39;ll actually send him back in the fall,<br/>
too.  He&#39;ll know this is for real!<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My column in the upcoming issue of Home Education Magazine [everyone go buy a<br/>
&gt; copy or subscribe! plug-moment] is about abundance, and that children who are<br/>
&gt; given respect and freedom can afford to give respect and freedom away to<br/>
&gt; others.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Somewhere in one of the many we have around this place, I remember an image<br/>
about this sort of thing that I still think of regularly.<br/>
<br/>
The author asks us to imagine that every person has a bucket.  Happy<br/>
children have buckets that are regularly filled, ladleful by ladleful with<br/>
good feelings, respect, love -- positive stuff.  If their buckets get<br/>
&quot;bumped&quot; and some sloshes out, like when bad things happen, or Mom<br/>
absolutely loses it, or they&#39;re treated poorly, it&#39;s ok in the long run,<br/>
because there was quite a bit there, and the children expect that more will<br/>
be given, in time.  These children are also mightily able to give, because<br/>
they know they have plenty, and a steady source.<br/>
<br/>
Children who aren&#39;t regularly ladled out good stuff, whose buckets aren&#39;t<br/>
full or regularly filled aren&#39;t going to want to ladle any out to someone<br/>
else because they fear scarcity.  And when their buckets get bumped, it<br/>
could be a catastrophe, because they could easily lost the little bit they<br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
I like this image, because it reassures me when I lose it (and apologize but<br/>
still feel bad), and also because it reminds me to consider whether I&#39;m<br/>
filling my son&#39;s bucket, and anyone else&#39;s I might have a chance to, as<br/>
well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179928169">I have considered it and I may talk to my dh about him not going back after Christmas break. But we will still owe for the tuition and the curriculum for the year at the school and I think dh wants more time to get ready to this idea. But ds will be out of school for almost 3 weeks so maybe we can &quot;practice&quot; and when the holidays are over dh will decide not to take him back to school. <br/>

Depends on the contract!<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who called last night VERY unhappy with a small private <br/>
school his kids go to.  I told him if they decide to withdraw them, just walk <br/>
and forget the cost.  I said if you buy 18 donuts and only want three, the <br/>
loss is constant whether you eat more donuts or not.  And if the school&#39;s <br/>
harmful,  no sense leaving them in one more hour just because it&#39;s already <br/>
paid for.<br/>

Mu oldest goes to a private school down the street. One with a very good <br/>
reputation not just in our area. My daughter tells me all the time all the <br/>
kids that come and go there. Kids who leave because they can&#39;t afford <br/>
tuition only to come back 2 weeks or a month later. Everything at the school <br/>
is itemized right from the beginning. Most people there pay monthly and the <br/>
school seems very good at handling the revolving door system some have. I <br/>
would imagine any private school could do the same if they were willing to.<br/>
