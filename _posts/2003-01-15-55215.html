<div id="ygrps-yiv-682573713"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You know all this talk about junk food has sent me into a binge. I have<br/>
&gt; ingested two doughnuts, a bowl of ice cream and a bag of doritos (just a<br/>
&gt; small bag, lol).  My husband cooked pork chops and potatoes, but I chose <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; doughnuts and ice cream.  I hope this &quot;de-schooling&quot; food doesn&#39;t last<br/>
&gt; forever!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA!!  I&#39;m the only person I know who could make a candy bar last a week, <br/>
because I only want a &quot;taste of&quot; chocolate occasionally.  After all these <br/>
posts, I poured a bowl  full of m&ms just to see what would happen!<br/>
