I mean to sound prudish, but, my DD, 17, came to me tonight w/concerns over a <br/>
couple of posts that she really thought were/are inappropriate; I have to <br/>
agree.  I have cut/pasted them to this group ONLY for the purpose that I am <br/>
HOPING the parent of the teen who started this group will read it.  I KNOW <br/>
the <br/>
teens like their privacy and all, BUT, I do think this needs to be moderated <br/>
a <br/>
bit.  Anyway, following are the post(s):<br/>
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what the talk about the group being a parrot group meant, I <br/>
wondered if they all have parrots or if it is some slang I don&#39;t know. But that <br/>
wasn&#39;t your concern was it? &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t have teens, yet, but in my experience <br/>
teens talk about sex. And while we all have varying degrees of comfort levels <br/>
on that subject, talking about sex is a good way for teens to explore and <br/>
discover. I don&#39;t know that I would want MY kids going around saying that they <br/>
are *free to have sex* in public forums, but I certainly do want them to feel <br/>
free to talk with their peers and Darin and I about their sexuality in a safe, <br/>
excepting environment. It is important to me that my kids know who they are and <br/>
that includes who they are sexually. I think that if they (any child) can <br/>
talk about sex and what they want in life, then they are more likely to have <br/>
meaningful encounters in all areas including their sexual encounters. I am happy <br/>
to see that your daughter feels comfortable enough to come to you with her own <br/>
concerns. I hope that you both can talk about how you and she feel about these <br/>
discussions, but moderating the group would be, IMHO, a violation of the very <br/>
trust we build our lives with them on. <br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>

<br/>
She said it once and then talked about parrots.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a 13 year old whose parents don&#39;t want to know that sex exists, <br/>
why are they on the internet?   If a 13 year old DOES know that sex exists, and <br/>
then knows that some older kids are having sex without being sneaky or hiding <br/>
it from their parents, that doesn&#39;t seem earth-shattering to me, personally.<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of teens are having sex.  The vast majority of them are lying about it.<br/>
It has been proven over the centuries that children don&#39;t NEED &quot;permission&quot; <br/>
from their parents to perform this act.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 11, 14 and 17.<br/>
<br/>
When they&#39;re in groups of kids, sometimes they talk about sex.  Most often, <br/>
it&#39;s about someone having claimed to have had sex who probably didn&#39;t.  Light, <br/>
humorous, glancing reference.  Once was about a girl Kirby had been with (his f<br/>
irst, but he wasn&#39;t HER first, they were saying).   <br/>
<br/>
So Kirby&#39;s brother and sister figure he&#39;s had sex, from passing comments.  <br/>
He&#39;s not bragging.  He&#39;s not even stating outright.  But when kids know each <br/>
other well, you don&#39;t need outright statements.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s healthier to accept that kids will discuss such things than for <br/>
us to pretend we think they won&#39;t, or to ask our kids to pretend they&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
Why encourage secrecy instead of openness?   <br/>
<br/>
If the girl had been telling nasty detailed stories, or saying &quot;I don&#39;t want <br/>
to talk about parrots, I want to talk about SEX! Then I&#39;d be grumpy.   <br/>
<br/>
Lots of 17 year olds are married or in committed relationships.<br/>
Many more are parents and some aren&#39;t entirely sure how they got that way.<br/>
<br/>
This culture tried forbidding and secrecy.  Didn&#39;t work out so well.<br/>
In my high school it seemed the more controlling a parent was (controlling of <br/>
movement and of information) the more likely a child was to get pregnant.  <br/>
The least controlling of movement and information had kids who knew how to use <br/>
birthcontrol, and who were unlikely to get in a situation where they couldn&#39;t <br/>
bail out, call home, get help.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kids who have snuck around who can&#39;t call and say &quot;Daddy, come get me, <br/>
this guy&#39;s being a jerk.&quot;  And once they&#39;re in the sneaky place and have lied <br/>
and said they&#39;re spending the night with a girlfriend, the guy KNOWS the girl <br/>
is out until the next day and he&#39;s more in control.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I just noticed why this might have struck me so sharply. <br/>
<br/>
When I was 17 I was at college, and when I was 17 3/4, I was having sex with <br/>
a 21 year old, who was my boyfriend for the rest of our college years, who was <br/>
responsible and bright and honest and all those good things.  There was <br/>
nothing evil or dangerous in the whole long relationship.   My parents knew him and <br/>
knew we were having sex.<br/>

How will you determind if parents need to be aware?<br/>

<br/>
Do you want to censor the list?<br/>
I don&#39;t even know who started the list or advertised it.<br/>

read HER mail unless SHE comes to me.  She did.  And, LOL, we are NOT even <br/>
close to being a non-open, censorship, concervative family.  In this case, SHE was <br/>
not comfortable w/this particular e-mail, SHE ASKED ME to post to this list <br/>
(where, I believe the e-mail list started) because SHE was NOT comfortable and <br/>
felt it was not appropriate.  There are no boogymen in our house.  We have <br/>
always discussed a lot of issues including sex at age appropriate levels, using <br/>
age appropriate terms, (except, LOL, the time my partner-n-love-n-life decided <br/>
to tell a 7 year old that you don&#39;t believe boys even if they tell you that <br/>
they&#39;ll get blue balls--I then made HER explain that one; tehe!).<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, we&#39;ve discussed it all in our family.  I only posted as she was <br/>
concerned that this list may be getting out of hand!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203806280">Well, I read the discussions re this issue, and what bothers me is not <br/>
the topic of sex, but the issue of posting the teen&#39;s original message <br/>
here in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 13 yo dd on the list. I trust her to handle the situation, or <br/>
to decide that she&#39;s uncomfortable with a discussion and either skip the <br/>
thread or leave the list.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I don&#39;t need another parent telling me what I &quot;NEED TO BE MADE <br/>
AWARE OF&quot;. Please don&#39;t parent for me. I trust my daughter. When she <br/>
needs to talk to me, she will. When she can handle it on her own, she <br/>
will. IF I need to be aware, she will make me aware.<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, the original post, from the teens list was posted here, <br/>
including the poster&#39;s name and email address. Unless this was done with <br/>
her permission, this is a violation of this teen&#39;s privacy. Regardless <br/>
of whether or not you approve. It isn&#39;t your place to approve. It&#39;s an <br/>
unmoderated list.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I&#39;m more concerned that a parent is snooping on the teen list. <br/>
If you and your child would be more comfortable with her being on a <br/>
moderated list, join one or start one. But don&#39;t snoop (even if your <br/>
daughter asked you to)  on an unmoderated teen list and then &quot;report&quot; on <br/>
what you find. I knew my 13 yo daughter was on an unmoderated list. I <br/>
trust her to handle it, or leave if she doesn&#39;t like it or it makes her <br/>
uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
You may have meant no disrespect, but you have disrespected the teen <br/>
whose post you forwarded, the teens on the list who *thought* they were <br/>
having private discussions, and those of us who trust our teens to <br/>
handle the discussions. Do the kids on the list know that you have <br/>
forwarded a post from their list to here? How do you think they would <br/>
feel if they knew that other kids&#39; moms were reading posts and <br/>
forwarding to here ones they didn&#39;t like? Might put a little damper on <br/>
the conversations.<br/>
<br/>
Funny, it&#39;s an ongoing discussion here (in real life) about moms who <br/>
trust their kids, and ones who feel a need to snoop and control. My <br/>
daughter prefers to be around moms who respect the kids. My daughter has <br/>
two friends whose mothers closely monitor their email. One simply rarely <br/>
uses email. The other one goes to great lengths to send emails w/out her <br/>
mother&#39;s knowledge. In neither case does the control work. Of course a <br/>
teen list is going to include discussions about sex. And  movies and <br/>
books and food and friends and whatever else kids talk about. It&#39;s an <br/>
unmoderated list, and they can talk about what they want. imho, the <br/>
teens will be able to moderate it just fine on their own, much as we do <br/>
here, by talking about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913802894">The person who made the first complain exchanged instant messages with me <br/>
about this.  I didn&#39;t save them.  But part of her concern stems from the daughter <br/>
of someone at her church having flown to another state to meet a guy she met <br/>
on the internet who turned out to be older than and not look like he had <br/>
claimed.  The parents had exchanged e-mail with what they thought were his parents.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why I don&#39;t think the situation applies to other situations:<br/>
<br/>
That stuff has gone on in other ways other places, for hundreds of years.  <br/>
It&#39;s not an internet problem.  Anyone who&#39;s done much reading about the <br/>
Renaissance knows there were marriages arranged using miniature paintings of the <br/>
people and recommendations of friends.  In the 19th century and early 20th, letter <br/>
writing was a big deal and there were courtships on paper, following intros by <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, an e-mail list isn&#39;t as likely a meeting place as chatrooms, and <br/>
chatrooms abound where more people are lying than telling the truth.<br/>
<br/>
AND... the way to woo someone to another state is not to start talking about <br/>
how you&#39;re having sex with your boyfriend and your parents know.   How <br/>
alluring is THAT!?  She&#39;s already partnered up.<br/>
<br/>
The way luring someone works is you find someone needy, lonely, unattended <br/>
to, and you tell her she&#39;s the only one who really understands you.  If she&#39;s <br/>
frustrated with her family you spin fantasy yarns about how she shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
restricted and ignored like that, and it&#39;s too bad her parents don&#39;t love her.<br/>
<br/>
It takes an initial neediness to be victimized by such things, and it&#39;s not <br/>
sex talk that lures young girls out of their homes.  It&#39;s &quot;oh I understand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone want to propose being alarmed if kids teens discuss home <br/>
situations and restrictions and levels of happiness?  (I sure don&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
The sky is not falling.<br/>
Needy kids ARE on the internet.  Always will be.<br/>
<br/>
If we make sure our kids aren&#39;t needy, it won&#39;t matter what &quot;enticements&quot; are <br/>
put before them, they&#39;ll know what they don&#39;t need.   <br/>
<br/>
So I still don&#39;t understand the original concern, but I propose <br/>

OK...look folks, if I made a mistake in assuming that the parents of the kid <br/>
(and, YES, a 13 and 15 yr old are still kids...NOT adults, and NOT quite <br/>
children) was ON THIS LIST, then I MADE THE MISTAKE!  I forwarded ONLY as a warning <br/>
that there was a POTENTIAL situation on the UNSCHOOLINGTEENS (see the <br/>
connection here) that possibly should be looked into.  I DID NOT forward this to HARM <br/>
the kids.  I KNOW they need their privacy, but at what expense here?<br/>
<br/>
I DID NOT, WILL NOT, send this to the other numerous lists I am on.  I MAY <br/>
HAVE ASSUMED WRONG that the parent IS on THIS LIST.  However, the reason I <br/>
ASSUMED the parent is/was/could be, is that a couple of weeks ago I DID receive a <br/>
post that a kid wanted to start a list for UNSCHOOLING TEENS (anyone see the <br/>
connection yet?).  THIS IS the ONLY Unschooling list I am on, so this would make <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for starting trouble....never meant for that....and, where I DID <br/>
make the mistake is that I did accidentally include names/e-mail addresses.  I <br/>
DID mean to take this out, however, before I could, I hit the send button and <br/>
then remember what I intended to do.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I will NOT apologize for my feelings that an adult should <br/>
at least take a look at questionable posts.  YES, I DO trust MY KID (17), BUT, <br/>
I DO NOT TRUST STRANGERS on the Internet.  For all you know, I COULD (to <br/>
borrow from a conversation I had w/another parent on the list today) be an 80 yr. <br/>
old man.  Same reasoning goes for the kids list...this COULD BE AN ADULT <br/>
&quot;acting&quot; as a kid.  <br/>
<br/>
I think all of you have valid thoughts, reasons, whatever for not wanting to <br/>
limit your kids.  Frankly, I&#39;VE NEVER had to moderate my daughter on the <br/>
Internet (because, as in this situation, SHE CAME TO ME.)  But, I&#39;m not going to be <br/>
blinded by the fact that somebody calls this an &quot;UNSCHOOLINGTEENS&quot; list, and <br/>
ASSUME that inappropriate people might join the list.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I DO apologize for the mistakes I made.  All I wanted to do was to make <br/>
the parent of the list aware to at least ASK their kids about it.<br/>

<br/>
If you had taken it out, how would someone here have known whether it was <br/>
their child or not?   It doesn&#39;t make sense to have sent it anonymously in case <br/>
the parents were here.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;On the other hand, I will NOT apologize for my feelings that an adult <br/>

You were an adult and you took a look, and some people think you overreacted.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Same reasoning goes for the kids list...this COULD BE AN ADULT <br/>
&quot;acting&quot; as a kid.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  And still it&#39;s just words on a screen, and they didn&#39;t seem harmful.<br/>
<br/>
If I were an 80 year old man and still giving good unschooling advice, what <br/>
would it matter?  I&#39;m not sneaking into anyone&#39;s house at night and slashing up <br/>
workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Reading online isn&#39;t personal danger.  Misjudgement about where to go when <br/>
one leaves the house isn&#39;t a chatroom, either.<br/>

Landon is almost 17, although I can&#39;t imagine him being engaged,but,  I know <br/>
it&#39;s very likely he could be having sex.  Actually, I know he&#39;s not, because <br/>
he has often lamented that he is &quot;not getting any&quot; and , well, he&#39;s a 17 yo <br/>
boy.. LOL.     I fully expect that when he does start having sex, I will know <br/>
about it.. Not all the details, but I will know, just like my Mom knew when I had <br/>
sex <br/>

me. (Unschoolers beware - if you think this age difference is a <br/>

themselves. Big surprise! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>

Second - 17 year olds have sex. Its not uncommon. Parents know about <br/>
it. Its not the worst thing in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Third - maybe its true and maybe its not - its an email list, for <br/>
goodness sakes. (Anybody remember the episode of Cheers where the <br/>
customer pretends to be a spy and Diane goes overboard in unmasking <br/>
him. Sam says something like, &quot;What! You&#39;re shocked and upset that a <br/>
guy comes into a bar and puts us all on - pretends to be something he&#39;s <br/>
not?&quot;) The kid could be just bragging a little - or not. So what?<br/>
<br/>
Fourth - where was there any danger? Nobody was soliciting somebody to <br/>
meet them. Nobody was talking suggestively to the teens there.<br/>
<br/>
This seems so overblown. I&#39;m thinking that a teenager who freaked out <br/>

Maybe a 12 year old, not being a teen, shouldn&#39;t have been on a teen list in <br/>
the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was invited to the local teen homeschooler group, just for next week <br/>
maybe, because it&#39;s something special at someone&#39;s house, and the mom invited <br/>
her.  But I had not pressed for them to let her go and I wouldn&#39;t have.  She <br/>
won&#39;t be going all the time.  She turns twelve next month, and although she&#39;s a <br/>
mature kid, they asked for teens and she&#39;s not one.<br/>
<br/>
Marty goes.  Fourteen is definitely teen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699770738">Pam, what you said was my point.  I think moms who worry about teens <br/>
talking about sex don&#39;t get that teens will talk about sex regardless.  <br/>
In my experience the parents that try to control their children end up <br/>
having the most out of control kids.  When I was a teen, it was the <br/>
ultra controled kids that were having the most sex, drinking the most, <br/>
etc. The kids like me, who could have a glass of wine with my parents <br/>
and whose parents spoke openly with me about sex, those things were not <br/>
forbidden and therefore not so desirable.<br/>
