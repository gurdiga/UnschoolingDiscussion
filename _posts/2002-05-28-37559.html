<div id="ygrps-yiv-617294619">I pasted the wrong quote.<br/>
<br/>
This was supposed to be in response to Sandra&#39;s experiences not enjoying<br/>
rebuilding an engine with her dad.  Ignore the other quote, it was<br/>
leftover from a previous post.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the confusion.<br/>

**********************************************************<br/>
**I&#39;m not sure that I like the whole &quot;strew&quot; paradigm, or maybe it&#39;s<br/>
just<br/>
the terminology. It does feel manipulative to me, like placing things on<br/>
<br/>
a child&#39;s path and hoping that she&#39;ll &quot;discover&quot; them. I&#39;m much more<br/>
inclined to get something, say,&quot;This is a cool book about cat mummies in<br/>
<br/>
Egypt, if you ever want to read it - it&#39;s going right here on the<br/>
bookshelf.&quot; and that&#39;s it. As she&#39;s gotten older, sometimes I&#39;ve pulled<br/>
stuff out and said &quot;Here, I think you might like this now&quot; and she<br/>
either<br/>
does or doesn&#39;t.**<br/>
<br/>
Yet more proof that it&#39;s a big waste to try to teach people things when<br/>
they aren&#39;t interested.  If this had been something you wanted to do,<br/>
I&#39;m sure your responses and level of enthusiasm would have been<br/>
completely different.<br/>
