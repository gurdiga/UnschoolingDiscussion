We were planning my wedding. My uncle was doing the ceremony.  My cousins,<br/>
both girls, were just 3 and 5 1/2.  The 5 yo asked if they could pop the<br/>
balloons we had for them to play with. Her sister pipes up, &quot;let&#39;s twist<br/>
them into people first, THEN pop them!&quot;  It did make us all take note and<br/>
wonder ... LOL<br/>
